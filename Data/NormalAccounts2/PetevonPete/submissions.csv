Today, I watched the men's individual all-around on the CBC stream, which featured 24 gymnasts. However, if you judged by the coverage, it only featured 2. It's no wonder Uchimura won, because he's apparently the only one who did all the apparatus. They showed literally one routine by 7th place Mikulak, as opposed to several by gymnasts several places lower. There was literally *none* of the Dutch, French, Belarussian, or Azerbaijani gymnasts shown. They barely showed any of the Brazilians and this is their games.

I know, in gymnastics, all apparatus are used at once, so it's impossible to show everything live. However, there's so much dead air in a standard gymnastics broadcast that I have no doubt they could get almost everything in, certainly more than they currently do.

Yes, you should probably show every Uchimura routine. You do *not*, however, need to show him sitting on the bench for five straight minutes while the crowd cheers for something offscreen that I'll never get to see. There was one shot of Verniaiev sitting with his hood up that literally lasted over a full minute. I swear I've spent twice as much time watching gymnasts wrap tape and look at the scoreboard than I have seen them perform routines. They've somehow made arguably the most impressive sport on Earth *boring.*

The BBC is guilty of the same thing. They showed only half of Team USA's routines, but you can bet that they lingered for a few minutes after the ones that they did cover, showing nothing but the gymnast anxiously watching the scoreboard nstead of more, ya know, actual gymnastics.",olympics,Dear Broadcasters: I'd like more gymnastics with my gymnastics coverage.,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/4x5tsj/dear_broadcasters_id_like_more_gymnastics_with_my/

Some people say that nobody cares about international baseball tournaments and that they're a waste of time. It's true that the prestige of national teams never really became part of the sport's culture like it did in others, but I think that has to change going forward in order to preserve the long-term health of the sport, even if it doesn't help short-term profits or performance.

Baseball has [a demographics problem](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/which-sports-have-the-whitest-richest-oldest-fans/283626/). A full half of its fans are over the age of 55. It also has the most predominantly white fanbase, which won't be good for it as immigration continues. If you look at the fastest-growing sports among young people, you'll see sports like soccer and rugby, sports where national teams are considered far more important than clubs. The NBA and NHL also receive a noticeable increase in young fans after every Olympics. It seems that sports are how young people express patriotism. And at events where they're *supposed* to express patriotism, not the highly militaristic displays of patriotism at MLB games, where 1/4 of the players aren't even American. For many sports, clubs are how the sports keep their fans, but national teams is how they get new ones.

And that's just the United States. The demographics gap and slipping interest is even worse in some other baseball playing countries. MLB owners might not care if other countries play baseball, but they should. More of the world playing baseball as kids produces more players, the best of which will make their way to MLB, the highest-paying league, and more baseball fans, wherever they are, means more MLB fans. The vast majority of FC Barcelona fans have never even been to Barcelona. The NBA has made huge profits from the popularity of basketball in China.

However, even if baseball returned to the Olympics, there's no reason to assume it would a bigger deal than the last time, because nothing really has changed. The entire point of a national team is to combine the best a country has to offer. The Olympics are during the professional season, and there's no reason to think MLB owners would be willing to release their players, or that MLB players would be eager to leave their clubs anyway, since again, club is more important than country in this sport's culture. They simply don't want to risk injury or a club's performance for games that don't *directly* benefit the club. And besides, the Olympics is still only once every four years, the same problem as the WBC. In order to reap the benefits and exposure that international competition brings, it has to happen more often.

But there may be a solution to this. There's already a time every year where players play a game that doesn't directly benefit the club: The All-Star Break.

My club plays in the AL, but I can't say that I feel any kind of attachment to the American League in the All-Star Game. Do the two leagues have actual ""fans"" beyond hoping the individuals from your club put on a big show? The only reason anyone has to care about the result of the game is the World Series home advantage aspect, but in my opinion that shouldn't be the case anyway, it should be decided by regular season record. If something is supposed to be a fun exhibition, then it can't have serious implications, and that still isn't a reason to care unless your team is a realistic World Series contender.

I think replacing the ASG with a series of international games would have multiple benefits:

1. It will have *more games,* since there's more than two countries that can field a team. Who doesn't want to watch a triple header with USA vs Japan, DR vs PR, and Mexico vs Canada?

2. It will give fans a reason to care about the outcome of games

3. It will give casual fans and even non-fans, both here and abroad, a reason to tune into the game and maybe become more consistent fans, and helps erase the stigma of baseball just being American.

4. It will mean national teams play more often than once every four years. Even if the games are one-offs that don't actually win any titles or trophies, it will make international play more routine and accepted and not some weird hiccup in business as usual. This might lead to MLB realizing that national teams don't hurt their interests, but that it's a symbiotic relationship.

The one major obstacle is that it would require MLB to cooperate with other leagues, since most countries couldn't fill a gameday roster *just* with MLB players (I figure only USA, DR, and Venezuela could).

Now I know some people probably downvoted this without reading it, because the ASG has a lot of history behind it, and this sport doesn't like change very much. But for most of the ASG's history, interleague play wasn't a thing, the only times NL and AL teams played each other was during the World Series, and ASG. The ASG gets more obsolete every year. Yes it's been around since 1933, but it's not 1933 anymore. I think the fact that an international exhibition makes more sense shows how much this sport has grown, changed, and evolved over the past 80 years.",baseball,Crazy Idea: replace the All-Star Break with an International Break,https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/4vv5fm/crazy_idea_replace_the_allstar_break_with_an/

This is actually two problems because if it's only the offense in the pile and no defense players bound on, then a ruck *has not formed,* and it would be legal for the defense to go around and pick up the ball, but a ref will always call that offside.

A problem in this sport is that different referees will straight up ignore different rules and even make up their own in order to force the game into a style of play that they're more comfortable with, and I think the most common example of this is refs not liking rucks and scrums to be actual proactive contests for possession, instead they prefer it when the defense goes through the motions and waits for the offense to get a knock on.

Now, there's something to be said to that strategy, it's the low-risk-low-reward approach of spreading out the defense instead of committing to counter-rucking, but it's a decision that *the team* should make instead of the refs steering them there by ignoring huge chunks of the rulebook.",rugbyunion,Have you ever seen Off Feet called on the offense?,https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/4iwf48/have_you_ever_seen_off_feet_called_on_the_offense/

Contrast that to how it's been in the 4th season, when every single time the team encounters bad guys, even Samaritan agents, they always manage to shoot them in the kneecaps, which very conveniently renders all of them unconscious, preventing from shooting back, using coms, screaming, alerting other bad guys, or doing anything else to inconvenience the heroes. It just makes the fight scenes lose their former tension and weight.

Vigilante characters who adhere to the ""Batman rule"" are a dime a dozen, I feel like the show has been losing what made Reese truly unique, and more generally shying away from the moral ambiguity that defined the early seasons. It's one thing for a character to not believe in executing unarmed prisoners, but simply denying the existence of kill-or-be-killed situations is contrived writing. The [convenient kneecapping](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kneecapping) trope doesn't seem like intentional character progression, it just comes across as plain censorship to make the show less confusing for a mainstream audience.

It was absurdly early in the series to bring in Doomsday. The film didn't earn Superman's death at all. But what bothers me is that in the movie series, Superman's death could have been permanent, so it could have actually meant something much more than in the comics. Everything that the movie did well is made meaningless by the fact that we know there will be many more movies.

I've noticed a trend in comic book movies that studios (and many fans) think that you can counter a flaw in a movie by saying ""it happend that way in the comics."" There have been tons of bad writing in comics, and there tons of things you can do in movies that you can't do in comics, yet *no one is taking advantage of that.* Comic book movies shouldn't bring in the *bad* aspects of comic books.

The biggest advantage that movies have over comics is that movies are allowed *to end.* Comics have to be kept going by contrived writing. I still think the Dark Knight trilogy are the best superhero movies ever because they were the only superhero story that was allowed to have *an arc.* They had a beginning, middle, and end. 

If the end of this movie were in the final movie then Superman's sacrifice could have been *real.* But I couldn't bring myself to care because I knew that that dirt was going to start floating.",superman,My biggest problem with BvS is also my biggest problem with comic book movies in general.

And that's pretty much exactly what he ends up doing.

The characters mainly talk about Anger being the emotion that fuels Dark Side power, but I think the emotion that made Anakin so powerful was fear. It's established that from the start of his training, he's always afraid in the back of his mind of his mother that he left alone on Tatooine. Then he's afraid of the Jedi finding out about his marriage, then he's afraid of losing his wife like his mother.

Vader in the OT clearly doesn't demonstrate the kind of power Anakin does in the prequels. Now, obviously the real explanation for this is because of special affects, and part of it might be how crippled he is, but he also seems to take a step back with his Force powers, not just flashy lightsaber moves. One way to explain this is that the moment he committed himself to the Dark Side, he lost the very thing that made him such a powerful Dark Side user, because he had nothing left to lose.

When Kylo Ren gets bad news, he throws a tantrum and destroys a computer console in rage. *That's* what you would expect from a Sith. Vader on the other hand is cold, calculating, rational, *emotionless.* Sure he kills people who have failed him, but it's more like calmly removing faulty components from the equation. It's still evil, but it's still a lot more Jedi-like than Sith-like. The difference between Jedi and Sith is more than one does good stuff and one does evil stuff.

By ANH, Vader and Sidious have been in the same master-student relationship for something like 20 years. That's a *long* time by Sith standards. One of them should have killed the other by now when the apprentice tried to take over. That's because after ROTS, all of his reasons for joining the Dark Side are dead, so we don't see the greed and ambition that we saw in the prequels. The only thing he has left is to follow orders, and suppress emotion to avoid feeling guilt. Like the good Jedi he's become.",StarWars,"From a certain point of view, Anakin turning to the Dark Side actually made him a better Jedi.",https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/49lucp/from_a_certain_point_of_view_anakin_turning_to/

I'm not really a fan of the MLS adopting the European style of just calling teams the name of the city followed by ""FC,"" one reason being that I assume it could make bringing it up in conversation a little awkward. NYCFC is easy to type, but ""Let's watch the NYCFC game"" doesn't roll off the tongue nearly as well as ""Let's watch the Mets game."" In England you can just say ""Liverpool"" because sports conversations aren't split up into 5 different sports like it is here.

So I'm just curious what Orlando, Dallas, Toronto, LAFC etc fans verbally call their team, do you spell out the acronym, or just say ""the soccer"" and assume they'll know you mean the MLS team?",MLS,"What do fans of teams called ""[City Name] FC"" call their team in conversation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/40u144/what_do_fans_of_teams_called_city_name_fc_call/

It's a good movie. I'm going to see it at least once again in the theater. I want to make that clear before painting a target on my back.

But it plays it very, very safe. It gives you exactly what you expect going in and not much else. There are zero surprises in this movie. A good movie gives an audience exactly what they want, a great movie gives an audience something they never knew they wanted.

There's literally a checklist of recycled stuff from the originals that start off endearing, but end up being tiresome by the credits.

We've got the cute beeping robot who's given a macguffin on ~~Tatooine~~ Jakku that's vital to the ~~Rebellion~~ Resistance, and is then found by a mechanically savvy and skilled pilot Force user.

We've got the guy with the deep voice in a mask who reports to an ~~Empero~~r Supreme Leader

We've got the big reveal that multiple characters are related to each other (because Ray is totally somebody's daughter).

We've got the whole ""There's still good in him!"" dialogue.

And, of course, we've got a THIRD. FUCKING. DEATH STAR. That is again taken out by an extremely convenient design flaw. Where the hell are they getting these things

I feel like a just watched a remake, not a sequel. It's basically a New Hope just with lots of the names changed. I think it's weird that when the prequels rather conveniently bring all the characters from the original together again, people call it forced and contrived, but people like it here. My favorite part of the movie by far is the beginning when it's just Fin and Ray. I didn't see any of Han Solo here, I saw Harrison Ford in his old costume. But I can't say I'm angry with him about that, Harrison Ford ran out of fucks to give some time in the Clinton administration, everybody knows that.

Going into this movie, I had this fear that this would be a movie defined by what it's not. That it's only goal would be to not be the prequels, but not have much direction or ambition beyond that. And I think that's true to an extent. There thankfully wasn't the wink-wink-nudge-nudge ""subtle"" jabs at the prequels like I was afraid there would be, but it did seem like they were afraid of angering the nastier portion of this fanbase. You know, the crowd that sent hate mail to a 10 year old. Say what you want about the prequels, but at least they had the ambition to try to tell a bigger, grander story than a ragtag group of rebels blowing a big bad thing up yet again. So what's better, a different, ambitious story executed lukewarmly or a completely standard and recycled story executed perectly?

Edit: I also would have liked it if they addressed the fact that Anakin was prophecized to bring balance to the Force once and for all but the Dark Side and the Sith are just as around as ever. I wouldn't even have really cared if it was a good explanation, hell they could have just copied a few of the explanations this sub has come up with, I just would have liked them to acknowledge that the contradiction exists.",StarWars,[Spoiler] The Difference Between a Good Movie and a Great Movie.,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/3xbk5i/spoiler_the_difference_between_a_good_movie_and_a/

I know that I'm *way* overthinking this. They changed Skye's name to Daisy because that's what she's called in the comics, and they want to make the comic fans happy, it's as simple as that, and is ultimately harmless. But just because something follows the comics doesn't automatically make it good (an unpopular opinion on the internet), and having Skye choose to change her name not only goes against how Season 2 ended, I think it undoes all the character development Skye has gone through since the beginning.

At the beginning of the series, Skye was a lost rebel whose only goal was to find her birth parents and find out who she is. And her character arc since then has been *getting over* that. Finding her *own* family in the team, building her *own* identity, and the finale of Season 2 was kind of when all that came to a head. Her choosing the name that her crazy science experiment of a father and genocidal psychopath of a mother gave her seems to do a complete 180 from how Season 2 ended.

Every character in fiction has two things: a Want and a Need. Every character arc involves the character looking for the Want and finding the Need. Think of every pirate movie you've seen, the whole point of the movie is finding out that the treasure doesn't actually matter. Think of every sports movie you've seen, it's never *actually* about winning the championship, it's about the characters realizing there are more important things. These might sound cliche, but they're necessary, because a character simply looking for something and then finding it is not an interesting story. At the start of the series, what Sky/Daisy *Wants* is to find her parents and where she's from, what she *Needs* is a family, identity, and purpose in life.

Permanently having her go by Daisy says that the most important part of her identity isn't who she is, or what she does, or the choices she makes, or the people she shares her life with, it's the circumstances of her birth. Not only is that a terrible message, but from a writing standpoint, it's a creative dead end. A character can't develop and change from there.

That's my five-paragraph over-analysis of a completely meaningless decision solely meant to tie back into the comics.",shield,[SPOILER S3E2] Why I think changing Skye's name to Daisy is a bad idea,https://www.reddit.com/r/shield/comments/3p2qqn/spoiler_s3e2_why_i_think_changing_skyes_name_to/

India was eliminated today with [a 3-0 away loss to Oman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV8Fj5pCmdY).

Cambodia were eliminated with a [1-2 loss in Singapore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc6-x9THqFA), an improvement from when they were beaten 0-4 by Singapore in Phnom Penh this June. This was the first goal that they scored in this World Cup campaign.

An early controversial penalty goal put North Korea ahead, and Yemen failed to equalize as their goalless streak in this qualifying campaign continued.

But we weren't any of those things today. We were lazy. We didn't care. Everyone on the field wrote off the game before kickoff and played every minute as if it was minute 79. Every time the boks got close to our try line, we just let them walk in. We knew they were going to score anyway so we just wanted to get it over with. We all but forfeited that game. You can't possibly say it's just because South Africa is just that good, no one who watched can say the springboks played their best. They were playing a mile below their potential and still completely embarrassed us.

After every blowout like this, the same batch of patronizing condolences get thrown around. ""They're just amateurs. They're getting better. They played with heart."" We can't even use any of those. The amateurism is no excuse, the other amateur teams made us look like children this tournament. We're not getting better. Today I saw the exact same thing I was watching back in 2005. Every time we think we're taking one step forward, it's two steps back. And we certainly didn't play with heart. We were terrified out there.

Lots of people have said that it’s no big deal since they can easily change the WC slots for 2019, but I will be very disappointed in World Rugby if they take this route, because

1. Changing the rules to benefit the established rugby nations is arbitrary and unprofessional

2. It’s unfair to the Asian and European nations who have a chance now that Japan and Georgia get the automatic qualification.

3. It actively hinders the growth of rugby in developing nations

The entire system of the automatic qualifications is based on the assumption that the teams that would make it are never going to change. That’s a terrible attitude to have and is a self-fulfilling prophecy. They go down that road, they might end up taking a page from the ICC’s book and shrinking the WC to just the Six Nations and Rugby Championship. More WC qualifying matches are the best possible tool for the global growth of the sport.

Instead, I think WR would benefit from taking a few pages from FIFA’s book. As evil as FIFA are, no one can deny they’ve been ridiculously successful at growing soccer at the grassroots level and spreading soccer to all corners of the globe.

Allocate a set number of WC slots to each continent, in my opinion:

1.5 slots to North America

1.5 slots to South America

1.5 slots to Asia

2.5 slots to Africa

4.5 slots to Oceania

7.5 slots to Europe

Each continent gets to decide how they set up their qualification process, like FIFA, but no country gets an automatic berth straight to the WC. They can get byes to later rounds based on their world ranking, but you have to earn the spot in some way.

The 2nd place teams in NA, SA and Asia, the 3rd place team in Africa, the 5th place team in Oceania, and the 8th place team in Europe play in inter-federation playoffs, the winners of which go to the World Cup. The losers play a final repechage and the winner becomes the 20th and final team in the World Cup.

And also, do the fucking draw the year of the WC so we don’t have another stupid Group A.

Do you think the automatic qualifiers are still necessary? How would you set up a qualification system?

A few quick things to know about it

1. MLB isn't involved in organizing the event. I think that where the WBC is organized by the IBAF and MLB, the Premier 12 will be organized by the IBAF and NPB.

2. [MLB has agreed to make non 40-man roster players available to participate.](https://twitter.com/MLB_PR/status/638460780233494530)

3. Instead of qualifying tournaments, the participants are decided by the 12 highest ranked teams in the world rankings.

4. If baseball is added back into the olympics, the Premier 12 will be the qualifying tournament for the olympics.

Are you at all interested in this thing? Does baseball have room for a world championship every two years? Do you hope MLB eventually lets their star players in it? Or do you not think international play has any place in baseball at all and you only care about your MLB team?
