45,"I would suggest you go to as many tastings as possible to develop your pallette.  Take plenty of notes! I cannot stress this enough! Then narrow down your preferred wines. 

Take what you learn from vendors with a grain of salt.  Sometimes they spew bullshit and don't know what they are talking about.  Ask them how long they have been serving, where they previously served, and what wine is their preference and why.

Sometimes I will downplay certain wines that others have tried and not liked.  Even though it's one of seven that I may be serving - if a vendor serves bad tasting wine (even though it may be perfectly fine and is just not a taste many prefer) it will ruin how you profile the rest of my wine.  Ask them which wine they want to sell and want to downplay.

Sometimes I change the line up of how I serve my wine so that I can sell the one that I want.  Ask the server WHY they are serving in the order they are, it could determine your future preference for everything that you are tasting.

Be concerned about pallette fatigue - trying too many wines without water or food will skew how you taste.


Don't feel bad about questioning the vendor - THEY SHOULD KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SELLING AND IF THEY DON'T... well sucks for them you should probably try someone else's wine.  They are getting paid to pour wine and make conversation.  Make them do their job.

If you have any questions let me know and PM me.
