21,"That person thinking inside of your head is you. It can be easy to get psyched out by questions like that. Sounds like you could maybe be experiencing DP. No, you should not worry about it unless it started impacting your well-being enough that you think you should seek medical help. Personally, I got DP/DR over a year ago from a panic attack on weed. Felt like mental shit for maybe a month, then I was ok with a few ""episodes"" here and there for months after. Nowadays, I feel just like how I did before DP/DR other than just being aware of what my mind can go through. A few months after it started, when I was doing fine, I had an episode triggered by simply inhaling helium from a balloon with a friend for fun times. I didn't even inhale it correctly but it brought be back to the feeling of smoking weed and I felt completely dream-like and spaced out the rest of the day - I was just watching myself go about my way even though I was acting normal. After about a year and a half, I can drink booze and even smoke a cigarette with zero problems and that's a hell of a lot closer than inhaling fucking helium. I'd suggest distracting yourself with hobbies and people until you feel fine - that's what worked for me. Stay away from drinking if it makes you feel weird.

131,"Where I go to college, it seems that the standards for black people are super low to get enough scholarships to pay for everything and still get $1000+ refund checks every semester. My roommate for my freshman year said he only had to maintain a 2.0 GPA to keep his scholarships, and he was receiving enough to actually get refund checks, which were mostly spent on weed, making our room smell horrible. This guy couldn't even join the fraternity he wanted because of how low his high school GPA was (&gt;2.0). 

I'm not basing all of my prejudice on one guy, I'm just stating what I experienced personally. A very large number of the black people at my university end up getting kicked out or drop out their first year, and the next year cleans up the rest. The black guy who lived in the room next to me, who used to keep me up with music blasting through his speakers ended up getting kicked out of the residence hall due to domestic violence. There are experiences similar to mine shared by several across campus. They waste scholarship money. They bother those who are on campus to better their future. They have a bad attitude. Of course, they're not all bad, it's just that 90% of them here are the ""ghetto"" type.

Anyway, I read that rates of alcohol-related incidents in those aged 18-20 did not decrease after the drinking age was changed to 21 in 1984. In that case, why was the drinking age changed?

1241,"There's no standard treatment to my knowledge. There's a lot of people selling a book/dvd/etc. on how to be ""cured"" of it online. I haven't looked into them, but they seem to be in it for personal gain. All of the genuine advice I see on the internet from other sufferers is to meditate, ignore the condition, accept that it is real and just caused by anxiety, and other ways to feel ""connected"" to your old self like that. Sometimes, antidepressants work.

All that matters is that when a person develops/starts having dpdr episodes is that they know exactly what is happening. Not a lot of people know about it, and if someone experiences dpdr for the first time, they might think that they're losing their mind or experiencing some form of psychosis. That's what I thought was happening to me until I had done enough research.

1245,"It's a feeling of confusion and extreme anxiety. The derealization part of it makes the world around you look different in an indescribable way, as if it's put through a filter or feels as if you're in a dream. Made me feel robotic, like I was watching myself go through the motions of life.

It lasted a few weeks until I googled my symptoms and found out it's dpdr, which is a relatively uncommon anxiety disorder to my knowledge. I'm pretty much normal now, but it sometimes creeps up on me, but I can keep control because I know now it's just anxiety. I can sometimes forcibly ""push myself over"" into the feeling by just thinking about it, but I haven't had a full blown ""episode"" in a while.
