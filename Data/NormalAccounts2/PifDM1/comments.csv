9,"Flow will come with picking the right name.

Case isn't super important...but it is...if that makes sense. There's no rule against different cases but it effects the structure and flow of the tag, throw, piece whatever",2016-05-12 02:43:28+00:00,d327q31,1,t3_4iyhge,2005,graffhelp

15,"everyone starts at square 1, no need to be a dick. Anyway, the best advice I got about throwing your tag with style is to first practice it with no style at all. Practice writing just the letters over and over until you beging to find a rhythm, then figure out spacing and flow. Its an art of repetition that is learned a letter at a time. Try strating off by jist writing you letters plainly and adding style to maybe only 1 or 2 letters, alot of times bew writers want to wild style every last thing they get up. Keep it simple and flowing",2016-04-01 11:35:12+00:00,d1lnk18,1,t3_4ctbo0,34498,graffhelp
