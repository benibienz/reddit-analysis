0,"Hi, I'm very sorry for your loss.
I lost my cat on Saturday morning and this subreddit really helped me deal with the pain so far.

Don't be afraid to cry your soul out when you need to. The first day will be hard on you and you need to let it all out. Even if you're a tough guy !
(Tough cookie girl here, went to the forest to ""express myself"", first time in my life and it was liberating).

Try to focus on the goods times too. Write some memories with him, it helps too to reminisce this.

And if you need to talk, fell free to mp me.

Have strength my friend and know that you are not alone *big internet stranger hug*",2015-06-22 13:02:51+00:00,csephub,1,t3_3aor2k,21325,Petloss
1,"Yeah, I understand that. My man put away some of her things this morning, it was awful... But it has to be done, one way or the other. 

I just had my father on the phone and told him and he reacted very kindly. He adores pet, he used to have birds and dogs and cats, all of them were rescued so he is a very sensitive person with animals. We chatted and laughed about Kim, what she used to do, when I got her in the first place. It was good to talk about that with him (yeah I'm teary right now, those fucking onions are all around me).

If you want to share some happy memories of her, fell free to share.",2015-06-21 14:28:08+00:00,csdszqe,4,t1_csdp0sx,15032,Petloss
2,"What a cute one !
I just love the 5th photo, where she is looking at the calendar ! And the 8th one ""wait, you're on MY spot now, I can extend my kindness and allow you to stand there, but if you mess up, I'M GONNA SHRED YOUR MUSTACHES OFF! ""

She seemed really nice, and loved !
I'm very sorry for your loss...",2015-06-21 09:12:38+00:00,csdo8t0,1,t3_3akjzr,23378,Petloss
3,"I'm sorry you had to go through that... It only last 2 days with Kim, with no pain at all, and it was hard, can't imagine what you went through...

What's tearing me right now is the loss, her absence. Seeing her little bed, the cardboard she used to sleep in these days, checking if everything's alright before going to bed and kiss goodnight but she is just not there.
That's the hard part now.",2015-06-21 09:02:10+00:00,csdo4a5,2,t1_csdn1jj,4734,Petloss
