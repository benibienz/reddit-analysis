So, let's begin with Kim, my Persian cat. As a kitten, she was supposed to go with my sister's friend, but when we checked on her, my mother and I found the tiny kitty locked in a minuscule bathroom. So... as huge animal lovers as we are, we took the cat back.
I was 11, I called my Dad to implore him to buy her for me (it was that or she was going to a kitties farm, to get pregnant again again and again... as she was a ""toy"", she wouldn't have last 2 pregnancies).

So here we begin our long journey, Kim and I. We shared a lot, my life has never been nice and simple and she was with me.
6 years ago, after a big break-up, I decided to leave my town and begin something new. I couldn't take her with me at the time, so I let her in the good care of my Mum.
Last year, my Mum had to move out of her place and the new one wouldn't permit a cat so I got her back.
I was terrified she couldn't do the trip (1000km), but she did ! And I was so happy to have her back with me.

It has been a year now. Not an easy one as she was diagnosed with ""hyperthyroidism"" (not sure if the English is correct on that one), and she didn't react well to the medication. Well, she also had some mental issues... yeah cats are crazy, and she was a really good example of it ! But she also used to sing us the song of her people three-six times at nights !
And she believed she was a wolf... not a cat. So ""ahouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"" in a guttural voice ! (the neighbor is deaf so everything was fine, I didn't mind too much).

On Monday, I had a bit of money coming up so I decided to have her checked at a veterinarian and have a shave. At 19 years old, she didn't care much of licking herself, and she had build up a strong aversion with everything related to brushes.

I was warned that considering her age and condition, she might not wake up, and I guess I only think of it as ""black or white"", no grays. She needed to be shaved, and I believed that everything would be fine when she'd wake up, or there would have been some accident and she wouldn't wake up at all. But she wouldn't suffer.

When I brought her home on Tueday, she was groggy and foggy, which was normal.
On Wednesday and Thursday, she was not going well. She refused eating, drank just a lit bit, and refused any form of heat. Blankets and heater she fled from.
I brought her back to the veterinarian yesterday early and she was in hypothermia, dehydrated...

He tried many things but when I got there this morning, she barely recognized me, she couldn't stand up.
There was no choice really, keeping on with drips and all was only keeping her alive, but not well, so the veterinarian put her to her final rest.

I'm not sad for it, as I said, it was not a decision it was as simple for me as to put a rain jacket when going out and it's pouring.


Do I feel guilty ? Hell yeah. If I haven't had this brilliant idea of putting her through a shave she would still be there.
I knew the fucking risks, but I didn't think for one minute that she could wake up yet not be well.

That's one part I would have to deal with, overcome one way or the other.

The other part is the loss. That is the bigger part. I'm 31, I lived 19 years with her and gosh the loss.
I went into the woods right after getting out of the veterinarian, I drove and drove and there I just stopped in the middle of the road to cry my heart out, and yell. It was not a furious yell, I was not angry, it was the loss. The fucking big hole in me.

When I went back home, I felt numb. 
and now, hours later, I gently go from one state to the other... Numb... than completely torn and I cry my eyes out, and I feel like yelling my pain... than again numb where I don't feel a thing, I don't give a shit to nothing.

I stumbled onto this subreddit and in a way it feels good not being alone. Even if it is sad to share that kind of feelings with people, I would largely prefer sharing a beer and a laugh.
For now, I don't know what to do with myself. The last lost I suffered was my grand-mother 10 years ago, I was angry.

Now I just feel... torn.",Petloss,"I had to have my cat put down this morning, I'm torn",http://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/3ai636/i_had_to_have_my_cat_put_down_this_morning_im_torn/
