To go around telling people not to run towards police during such a situation is dumb. If any of these two things are gonna get someone killed - staying in a building with an active shooter instead of running for the police is exactly what is going to get you killed.

The cops aren't there to kill you. Yes, a lot of people die from cops, but for fucks sake.

23,"For controllers, you should use CRUD.
Some people adhere strictly to that, and have ONLY those methods in any controller.

`index()`, `create()`, `store()`, `show()`, `edit()`, `update()` and `destroy()`

If say you have a `PostController` and you need to add tags, consider, creating a TagController that also uses the same methods. Any time you feel ""I need to add a `doThis()` method"", that should probably go in another CRUD controller.

When it comes to emails, you should make Mailable classes, or even use Notifications with Events and whatnot.

A lot of people also try to keep the controllers as clean as possible, as you mentioned. Using Request classes to handle validation, and various other service classes and repositories. Often the Model itself can be utilized for a lot of the processing. For example, I handle all user registrations through the User class.

All networks give the same air time to every party. If they show a 30 second ad for Clinton - they show a 30 second ad for Gary Johnson within the same 12 hours.

65,"All we can do is compare it to what match fixing we know is going on in other sports.

Whenever there's gambling involved, you can be sure as fuck that someone is going to be trying to tilt the results in their favor. Be it the  casinos giving out free drinks to get people drunk when they are on a roll, or the player counting cards.

Sports betting is even worse, because there's not one localized casino to play in. There are betting sites, bookies and local pubs where you can put money on anything and everything. Especially in Europe and the former soviet union there are major match fixing syndicates who make billions fixing matches. They are extremely careful and know exactly how to go after players.

Say you're a footballer in a polish top tier football club. There's almost a guaranteed chance that you are being followed. They see that you go into a gay bar, and a few days later you get a message with a photograph and some instructions. The week after, you miss a penalty.

This isn't just speculation. They prey on your weaknesses. Take Tim Donaghy, a NBA ref. He loved to gamble. Not on basketball mind you - but he did get involved with some shady bookies and mafia types. He of course got into debt. And did he get out of debt? Yup, he match fixed NBA games....

NBA is on a massive scale. The payout for the match fixing is huge, but it's also very risky - which lead to the inevitable discovery and arrest only a few years after it started.

Imagine what happens in lower tier basketball. The basketball being played in Europe. Not the top tier, but the second top tier. There's betting there as well you know. Like in CSGO, the players there don't have as much to lose, and the scrutiny is way lower. So why not make money. It's not like you make a lot of money playing in front of 400 people in a school gym.

Match fixing is a huge problem, and you only need to google it to realize. But hard proof is hard to come by, since there are so much secrecy and motivation to keep quiet from all sides. I did a quick search for tennis betting, since that's an easy one to throw, but since it's not a team sport - statistics are much more accurate to analyze predicted wins:

http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/09/study-shows-unusual-betting-patterns-almost-two-dozen-matches-year/52644/

**next one is buzzfeed, but it's a legitimate report. honest**
https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/how-we-used-data-to-investigate-match-fixing-in-tennis

So I kind of went too long with this, and probably 3 people will read it but fuck it. Anyway, the point is... if it's that prevalent in sports, CSGO is even more vulnerable. It's new, and especially in low tier competitions the ability to influence players and ""turn them"" is so much greater because if you're a 16 year old kid in school being offered real hard cash to throw a match you'd take it.

I had something similar a year ago after I changed my office chair. Turns out the pain wasn't actually in my testicles, I only got a friend who's a doctor to take a look and he found nothing wrong.

Again, not a doctor, but take some time and examine your testicle. It should be smooth all the way around (except for the veins feeding it of course). If you notice any lumps or the veins feel big and swollen (compare it to the side where your testicle doesn't hurt), you should definitely get it checked out.

But if you're still worried you should go see your primary care physician. They'll fondle you a bit and tell you if it's all okay down there. Some times just the assurance from a doctor can go a long way in making things better :P",2016-08-12 02:18:45+00:00,d6e0mcr,1,t3_4x9jgo,27843,AskDocs

126,"The reason for this is simple, but also a major oversight by the developers. Since Pokemon Go's is based on Niantics other game Ingress, it's underlying code is designed for a science fiction game. Part of Ingress was to collect something called ""XM"" (as seen here: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EvPWfHdVo5s/UYqgOsGEncI/AAAAAAAAA7g/GUfFf95VVVE/s1600/ingress+3.png). Apparently, Pokemon spawns and XM locations are tied together. I can bike about 10 minutes from my house to a major apartment complex and suddenly 5-6 pokemon will just spawn in the middle of it. Ingress map shows there's an abundance of XM there as well. Around my house there are 2 XM spots, with just a tiny sliver of XM shown. Once or twice a day, a pokemon will spawn near my house with two tracks and I can calmly walk to one of those two spots to collect it. There is no chance of it being anywhere other than either of those two xm locations.

XM locations are apparently based on cellphone usage in that area, which for rural areas... well you get it. So it's an inherent flaw in the underlying system, and depending on how tied together the Pokemon Go and Ingress systems are, it could be very easy or extremely hard to change the underlying pokemon spawn mechanics of Pokemon Go.

So rural players are shafted. Not only by pokestops, but because the underlying code is designed for a science fiction game where cell phone usage is key. If your area has few people, few pokemon will spawn. Which of course is contrary to the entire lore of Pokemon.",2016-07-14 14:49:42+00:00,d5bzoh1,1,t3_4st95m,4788,pokemongo

Will these people return when/if the conflict ends? If not, they aren't refugees any more.

Are they actually Syrian, or actually persecuted or in danger? A lot of people coming to Europe right now are economic migrants blending in with actual refugees.

Also, should they be allowed to pick and choose where they should be safe? Say they enter Europe in Greece. If they continue going north with the intention of settling in Sweden, they can also no longer be considered refugees, but again economic migrants. If they are escaping persecution and danger, they should be happy with any country willing to take them in.

Unless you have something valuable to contribute to the country you are immigrating to, and you're not a legitimate refugee, then you can stay in your own country.

217,"&gt; There was NO, NONE, SIP, NADA situational reason to pull a trigger, yet here you are defending that while making it sound like ""Cops have a need to draw their guns, for their own safety."".

Firstly. Yes, that's exactly what they need. Unless you want to argue that police should never draw their gun until the suspect draws a weapon first. If it was a routine traffic stop, of course they should have their guns holstered. But here they are arresting a drug dealer. Drug dealers are known to be violent. So yes, I fully support having guns ready when arresting drug dealers. You can argue the validity of the laws all you want, but the fact remains there is currently a law that prohibits the sale of narcotics.


&gt; Cowboys, one and all, with only the most minimal of accountability. Is that the SIM simulation YOU would have set up had you been afforded the honor of sitting in Philadelphia with Messrs. Franklin, Jefferson and Adams?


Have you even READ the discussion? I FULLY AGREE that cops in the US are way to trigger happy. But I also recognize they have a dangerous profession where weapons are commonly encountered. I also recognize that most cops are good decent people who risk their lives to serve their community. Others are assholes, like in any other profession. Only here they have a gun.

But you and your kin seem to have taken this absolutist stance against the police. Since a large minority of them are dicks, they must all be dicks, and nothing anyone says can ever stray you from the path. What you fail to understand is your hostile attitude is only helping to grow this endless circle of ""us vs. them"". 

When you vilify the police like you've done with your assumptions, do you think the police will be more inclined to change? No, it will be the opposite. Why would a cop be nice to you if he'd read what you wrote in your post? That he, like every other cop, were guarantee to let anyone not being a police officer bleed to death. As I said, most cops are decent and hard working, and don't appreciate you calling them murderers.",2016-04-03 13:21:42+00:00,d1o163v,6,t1_d1nurmw,23877,news
218,"&gt; No, I'm saying that people who sign up to enforce victimless crime and show disregard for human life are amoral authoritarians who are only causing harm to society.

Even if it is a victimless crime, I'm sure you won't deny that drug dealers are much more likely, not only to own, but use, weapons against those that threaten their income. Which is why, in drug related incidents - police go in with weapons drawn. I don't think this is strange or unexpected at all.

&gt; Lol, k. ""I don't like that thing you're choosing to put in your body so now you must listen to me and submit to my authority or die.""

You're arguing like a child. The police don't set the laws. They enforce them. If you want - vote to change the laws (when you're old enough). A democratic society decides for itself what should, and shouldn't, be legal. You can disagree with the law, but those that enforce it aren't the ones you need to blame.

&gt; Yeah, I do think that American cops over use force, both non-lethal and lethal. The rest of Western nations seem to be able to keep their police trained and under control, US cops, not so much.


I do as well, but there's a reason for it as well, which is easy to overlook. How often do UK, Norwegian, French, Swiss and German cops, for example, encounter weapons? Not even close to the amount of weapons in the hands of criminals in the US, even when accounting for per capita statistics. Police violence is a symptom of the culture where the police have been taught to treat everyone as someone who can and will kill you given the chance. It's futile and illogical to place the blame solely on the officers who, in most part serve their communities well. No one questions the military when they conduct house searches in Afghani villages with their weapons drawn.

Relevant page 19 of the document documents the United Nations Human Rights Council findings on illegal weapons.

There are dozens of other attacks most countries are highly confident were carried out by the Syrian regime. Russia always refutes Assad's involvement of course, and blames the rebels - which makes it very hard to get a security council resolution assigning blame. However, individual countries place the blame on the majority of these attacks on Assad's government.

They are only meant to serve as visible security, ""manpower"" and ceremonial reasons. The primary guard duty falls to the ""Royal police escort"", who are the guys in the black suits always close. These are more like the secret service, and the royal guard are more like the presidential marines.

Another duty of the royal guards are the military tattoo. The Royal guards are one of the worlds foremost tattoo units. Again, it's especially impressive seeing as they are conscripted 18-20 year olds who have to learn their routines and coordination in months, not years which most units do.

318,"Nothing to do with the Norse religion.

&gt; In 1180 there was great activity in Borgund: they were going have a new church. The trees had been felled and the great logs hauled to the site. The old wooden church had to be replaced because the timbers were rotting, especially the roof-bearing posts where they were set in the ground. In the new church the timber framework would not be in contact with the damp earth: it would be raised up on stone foundations, a great improvement that would lengthen the life of the building. Skilled and experienced craftsmen arrived and set to work trimming the logs and planks and timbers-perhaps as many as 2,000 pieces in all.
With the help of the local people, the great posts or ‘staves’ – were slotted into the ground frame and hauled upright to form the main structure. The rest was relatively easy and soon the local community was planning the consecration of their fine new church. The service was conducted by the bishop himself. He first went round the building three times, then knocked thrice on the closed door with his bishop’s crook before he entered and led the parishioners in mass, **consecrating the building in the name of Christ**, conqueror of all evil and Lord of the Church.
Five crosses were carved in the altar and five more in the walls. They were sprinkled with holy water and consecrated with oil. The nave was full, the men and boys standing to the south of the aisle, the women and girls to the north. The only benches were along the walls and these were reserved for the old and the crippled.

332,"We rarely see when the NSA actually DOES stop attacks though. During the Syria debate in the UK parliament, the PM hinted to 7 attacks being stopped by intelligence services in the last 6 months.

I assume US intelligence agencies have stopped as many is not many more, that we will never know about.

It's impossible to stop all attacks, even with full access to every private correspondence from every person in the entire world. Not only will the amount be overwhelming and impossible to verify in time - there will always be the lone gunman who doesn't communicate, or those who communicate using low-tech methods impossible to intercept.

We need intelligence services. Their reach is of course up for debate and many people have strong views. But the fact is they stop attacks. And the public **shouldn't** know exactly how they do it. However, the public should be safe knowing they are not being targeted for no reason.

But to your point. US intelligence wouldn't have stopped this attack even if they had 10x more surveillance reach, nor would they with 10x less surveillance reach. It would be interesting to see how many people currently living in the US intelligence services have listed as ""showing support for terrorism"". I'm sure the number is in the hundreds, if not thousands. Regardless of surveillance reach, some of these are going to be put on a lower priority, and some of those deemed as lower priority are going to carry out attacks.

It's difficult, and my post ended up much longer than I imagined. But my point, through all of this, is that we need intelligence services, and although we should be careful of the power we give them, we can't assume that they will stop every attack.

It's definitely not an overreaction if the allegations are true. It's every countries right to take military action if another country's MILITARY FORCES are crossing your border without permission. No country is going to be happy about that. 

Russian planes in the North, around Norway and Britain, like to ""skirt the edges"" of borders, flying as close as they can to measure the response.

If you miss the checkin, there's no way any airline will let you on the flight. This isn't specific to Norwegian. And seeing as you need a boarding pass to pass security, I'm assuming you missed the checkin. Again, NO AIRLINE would let you board their plane if you miss checkin.

If you miss boarding, they look for you. But since you aren't checked in, they don't know you're supposed to be on the flight.

The reason why checkin is so important is because it finalizes the flight manifest. Once checkin closes, the lists of passengers, and weight caluclations are sent to the governing airspace authorities, pilots and ground crew so they can calucate a whole bunch of stuff including how much fuel there is. Suddenly a bunch of people come and demand to be checked in? That's never going to happen, not with any airline. You missed your flight. The FAA don't have a record of you on the plane.

Since cross country skiing is by far the most physically challenging, up to 40% of the best athletes are diagnosed with Asthma. However, it's the same for hockey players whose asthma statistics are nearly identical. Because of chlorine, many Olympic swimmers also have asthma.

Kingstein's implication of his post is that the Norwegian cross-country skiing team are using fake diagnosis so they will be allowed to use asthma medicine and get an illegal advantage. Which is ironic, because every study done on asthma medicine shows no improvement. There is no advantage, and WADA has been petitioned multiple times to remove it as a banned substance, which is likely they will do in the near future.

So just so everyone knows. Norwegian cross-country skiers don't suddenly develop fake asthma when they are drafted to the national team.
