* There's a guy who scavenges technology from a debris field where aliens used to live. For some reason their entire civilization got destroyed. There are several scavengers and at one point he finds a data core of some kind. At one point another group of scavengers try to kill him.

* There's a space station/city where all the scavengers return to sell their findings, usually in auctions where the highest bidder gets the technology. However, for our main character, his discovery is purchased by the space stations AI who has reserved its right to purchase any technology found in the debris field regardless of other bids.

* The station has a ""queen"" or ""princess"" of some sort. A young girl who lives in the space station and uses the AI as her proxy. No one knows she's as powerful as she is. She takes the scavenger guy as a lover and later reveals her identity to him, and later to the entire station.

* There are aliens living on the station as part of a research team. The research team are as interested as the humans as to why the alien race from the debris field met their doom. From what I remember one of the alien races are kind of elephant looking. The queen/princess lady takes a fondness to the child of one of the alien couples and plays with it a lot.

* There is some guy who lives at the station as well, who has some kind of power - though I can't remember what kind. He befriends a nomad/mysic girl who makes him take some kind of drug to try and convert him to a religion. He tries to be a good guy, but he gets corrupted by his father or something at one point and shit goes down.

I know I'll feel dumb as soon as one of you points directly to the book, but for some insane reason I just can't remember any important details like names that would make it easier to google.

1. Sean straight up lied: he said ""close to zero"" chances of meeting another player and intended us to think that it was still possible, but there truly is absolutely no netcode in the game to support that.

2. Sean was telling the truth: something is wrong/broken with the servers right now, and these two players should've been instanced together, but were not. Or, maybe HG hasn't quite finished work on the netcode because they didn't expect any players to meet each other quite so soon, and it will be implemented in the very near future. In this case I'd expect Sean to make a public statement once he sees this.

3. Sean was telling the truth, with a caveat: so Sean kept saying chances are almost zero, almost zero, almost zero, right? We all assumed that chances are almost zero because the game's universe is so massive, right? What if the actual reason for chances being so slim is that the netcode specifically doesn't always instance players together when close by? So, your chances of meeting someone are very small already, and on top of that, if you do run into another player somewhere, you only have a 1 in 5 chance of getting instanced together, or something like that. If this is true, that would lead to a whole slew of other questions, like is the universe as big as Sean says? If so, why the need for an artificial limitation on players meeting up?

So what is more likely? With no word from the devs, I don't get why so many people are insisting that option 1 is correct. If anything, option 2 is much more simple and requires a lot less assumptions that the devs were intentionally lying.

This is from October 2015 when Sean Murray visited The Late Show with Steven Colbert, which is the latest I can find of them confirming the feature.

So why can't we just assume this is a bug? Why are we instantly assuming it's a lie? I'm visiting submissions that try and discuss this, and posts like ""they lied"" gets a ton of upvotes, but the ""just wait for word, maybe it's a bug?"" actually gets downvoted..... That's just silly.

I'm currently residing in a pretty rural area, 90 minute walk from the nearest city. The nearest gym is a 60 minute walk away. And I had to drive to even find these gyms. I wasn't able to look at the map for them, because they don't appear. If I rotate my map around, all I see is one pokestop.

This one pokestop fairly close, but it's still a 6 minute walk and it usually gives me only 3 items, one of which consistently is a potion or a crystal. On my way there, I'm lucky if I can find one pokemon. At the time I'm writing this, there is one pokemon, three tracks away.

I don't have time to spend 3 hours going to a gym. I don't have a bike here, and I don't plan on buying one for pokemon.

At first I was concerned, but everyone told me it was not dangerous. But now I've had the chance to plug the laptop into other outlets at ground level and the second floor, and there is no buzzing, or in some outlets a very very faint buzzing feeling.

Obviously something is different with the power going to the basement. Is this something I should be concerned about? Should I get an electrician in to check it out? I have little to no knowledge of anything of this nature - so I was hoping you guys could help out.

So I have a few questions below, and excuse my lack of knowledge - but it's been quite a while since I read up on the game and the over-saturation of info right now just makes it easier to ask it here :)

* Would it be possible to play casually (~10 hours a week) and still feel like my character is progressing?
* How single player friendly is it. Would I be able to, theoretically, get all the best gear while never teaming up with anyone online?
* If the above is not possible, is my ""noob gear"" going to make it feel like I'm being carried through everything, or will I be able to actually make a difference until I get ""geared""
* Would it be fun playing alone, jumping into random groups? Or are friends ""required""?

Basically I'm asking if it's worth it. I know this might be the wrong place to ask, but combined with the questions above, maybe it will help with an unbiased recommendation :)

They are just way too slow. They seriously need to get some more people to work on the vods. It seems like every time they put up vods, they have to aplologize for how long it takes. If that's the case, it's time to start bringing in help.

But I'm wondering if there's another place that I can get spoiler free VODS. I know finding the videos isn't a problem, but one of the things I love about the reddit VOD subreddits, like LOLEventVods and CSEventVods is that it's spoiler free. When a BO3 only has two links, it's a huge spoiler. That means there's no point watching game 3. 

So I'm looking for alternatives (must be spoiler free though). I'm sure there's a better service than CSeventVODs out there, and hopefully someone here knows what it is.",GlobalOffensive,/r/CSeventVODs alternative?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3mx51b/rcseventvods_alternative/

I've been looking at the [X550JX](https://www.asus.com/Notebooks/X550JX/) but I'm not sure if I want something so ""designy"". I need something with a durable and comfortable keyboard, and a good quality screen.

I'm planning on mostly using it as a work laptop writing code. I'll run dual boot windows and ubuntu. I have a desktop I use for gaming, but it would be nice to have a laptop that could be used for gaming when traveling or not at home.

I have a budget of around $1000 (Around 8000,- Norwegian Kroner)

Any help would be appreciated. There are so much to chose from and maybe someone has been through the same and have some tips to offer.

I put them in groups, like Games, Adobe, Office, etc. I also make most of them small, as I don't really want to scroll, and for some programs it looks better. Though I have some tiles wide and medium as well.

But after restart, it suddenly becomes jumbled up, and _almost_ every tile resets to medium size instead of the small size I set it to previously. Some tiles stay in their groups, while others either jump into another group or in a previously unset group.

I have no idea what's causing this, but it's by far the most annoying thing I've noticed.
