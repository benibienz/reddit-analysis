4,"How to separate the ""little people"" trying to get by from the ""investor class"" has always been the problem with Airbnb. It's not just an Asheville problem, it's actually an international problem. Governments are slow and not particularly nimble. The investor class/Airbnb has thrown a LOT of cash around, lobbying cities and states to let them keep their sweet thing. Like I feel for the people getting medical treatments based on Airbnb income, but there's a lot of people here who don't own a house let alone 2, don't hope to ever own a house here due to how high prices are, and are not getting medical treatments they need. 

What you aren't really seeing is how many people are suffering in Asheville with our insane housing crisis. The city council people have to answer to those who actually live here too, not just visitors. That said, who did you talk to? They all have wildly different personalities. In case you aren't aware, last time there were city council elections, anyone who was seen as being too friendly with the bougie/investor class/Airbnb/hotel was voted out of office.

26,"Animal welfare is considered to be the more moderate position. It's where animals can be used for things like companionship, therapy animals, food, physical labor, fur, skin, testing for medications, but the idea is that the animals live as high a quality of life in those capacities as possible. So they're given at least adequate housing, clean water, plenty of food, health care if they need it, etc., as they provide these services to humans. This concept is compatible with farming and with many people.

Obviously in a lot of cases, animals do not yet have much in the way of animal welfare, so it seems like a goal to work on. Animals used in dogfighting, for instance, are kept in very inhumane conditions and the bait animals are literally torn apart while alive and screaming. Dogfighting occurs even here in the US, and animals are tortured every day here (unwanted litters of kittens left in bags to drown in rivers, freeze to death outdoors, etc.) so it's not like the US is some sort of world leader on animal welfare or anything.

Animal rights gets into much trickier territory, particularly since we still haven't actually achieved animal welfare yet. It believes that people who support animal welfare, while meaning well, still view animals as property, and that is unacceptable. Animal rights proponents believe that animals should not be used by humans for any reason whatsoever - no companionship (no pets), no food, no animal testing, no help with labor, no clothing, nothing. This is obviously a pretty radical stance, and not likely to go over well in r/farming, where animals are used for companionship, for security, for herding animals, for the herd animals themselves that are turned into food, etc.

It's commonly known in the industry that dairy cows live lives of luxury. Compared to even other domesticated animas, they get really pampered, because it aids their milk production. Happy cows = healthy cows = good milk. The dairy farmers in r/farming have some really high tech milk parlors that cost gobs and gobs of money, the animals are clean and well-cared for, while they are alive and serving a purpose to the farmers. [Some lucky cows get these brush things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AM1kDBPfcs). And as for the all the animals sent to slaughter, there's been a revolution in the industry thanks to [Temple Grandin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Grandin). She has single-handedly changed the way that animals are thought about, are treated, and has redesigned animal slaughter houses to be far more humane and peaceful.

I mention the dairy farmers specifically because right now they're going through a very tough time. And farmers, by occupation, actually top the list of professions most likely to commit suicide in the US, alongside fishing and forestry [Source-CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6525a1.htm). They are also the group being targeted for bullying in the article. 

Now, are there farmers or farm workers out there who hurt their animals? Sure. Are they idiots? Fuck yes, since that's how they make their money. Are they hated by the rest of the farm community? Yep, for the same reasons that anyone who cares about animals isn't too wild about the crazies breaking domesticated animals out of farms and then leave them to die. Crazies make the sane people look bad, even if nominally they're on the ""same"" side.

Wellllll, as I understand it... the thing is, if we want to save the planet, we're going to have to enact carbon taxes.

49,"&gt; Telling people that they were wrong for voting for someone who represented them best is the same as telling them that democracy is bad.

That misses the point that we're in a first past the post system. You can vote your conscience in the primaries, but the actual election will always be about voting for the lesser evil. It's not about democracy, it's about voting math, how we tally our votes. There's other methods out there. Our current system forces us into a binary. It's why the US elections for hundreds of years have always had two major parties.

Keep hoping that better use of technology will be able to shrink staffing sizes and that virtually identical programs run under different government groups can be combined, but everyone has their fiefdom...

Both parties hand out jobs and contracts as rewards, and both the government/military work as job programs, so there's a lot of reasons why the gov't is as big as it is, and little party incentive to truly shrink it.

69,"There's a lot of words here that don't fit with reality, but let's start out with one example: minimum wage. Bernie moved the DNC platform and Hill on that one. It wasn't enough for the far left, since they don't seem to understand compromise, so they spent several months dragging her ass, depressing support for her.

Meanwhile, Trump/Pence have talked about getting rid of the minimum wage entirely, and they're heading to office with a Repub Congress. Shittalking her was such a brilliant strategy for those on the left.

You're also forgetting a few things. The DNC is political too. Bernie could've been a Dem for decades too, forming relationships, going to meetings, shaking hands, kissing babies, putting in his time for the party. He didn't. Instead he was an Independent. Meanwhile, Hillary did all that stuff, she put in her dues, made allies. That's not corruption, that's not stealing, that's how the world works in every single organization that involves humans. So Bernie, who was a Dem for what, a year? comes in there with these ideas that are going to freak out a lot of more conservative Dems who HATE the idea of higher taxes. The DNC scooted left, in an attempt to hold onto the Bernie voters who incidentally did not show up for him in the primaries. What those on the far left fail to see in their enthusiasm is that for every step the party makes to the left, they might gain young supporters, but historically, young supporters don't fucking show up to vote. And as they move left, the lose people on the right end of the spectrum, who tend to be older, and also way more likely to show up to vote.

And I get why the young would be extremely frustrated and feel like they have no representation. Because effectively, they don't. But it's because they can't be bothered to show up to vote. Sure, voter suppression is very real, and a very successful long game the Republicans have been running. That easily takes out thousands of voters. But there's millions and millions of eligible voters who couldn't be bothered to get off their asses for the primaries and for the general. If a few million had (out of general population of over 330 million), we'd be having a very different conversation.

Calling progressives names has got to be the weirdest damn part of the election. Is someone calling you a name on the internet really going to stop you from going to exercise your constitutional right to vote? Are you more offended being called a name from a Clinton person than from a Trump person? You'd think 30 seconds of watching a Trump rally would convince the far left to vote for Clinton, you know for their own self interest, but perhaps not.

See the thing is Sanders did not have a chance in hell of getting his ideas through Congress. Obama, who is center right, hasn't been able to. I'm not sure why some Bernie supporters think a Democratic Socialist could've done better. I mean the man was in Congress for decades and got *nothing* of the sort accomplished. You don't have to be President to get legislation through that would fund college education or single payer health care.

As for taking corporate money, that's what happens when you have insanely long election cycles like we do in the US, but more than that, you can thank the Republicans for Citizens United. Which, again, thanks to low Dem turnout in this election, isn't going anywhere. It's going to get a lot worse. Until you realize that the person who holds the views closest to yours is *not* your enemy, the left will continue to fucking destroy itself. The perfect is the enemy of the good. All candidates are flawed, even Bernie. Moderate Dems still hold views closer to yours than the Republicans. 

Your overly dramatic language does a disservice to anyone who has faced literal violence, including guns held to heads and sexual assault, btw.

2) Find your [county extension service](http://www.clemson.edu/extension/).

Ask them any questions you may have, if they don't know the answer, they can point you in the right direction. Part of the reason they can be so valuable is that they'll have access to local knowledge and research. There's a lot to homesteading that has a local aspect to it, and SC will be different from FL. They can do all sorts of things from helping to hook you up with high quality but affordable soil testing to making recommendations as to what kinds of plants will grow well on the property.

Before you use anything in your garden, it's good to read up on it, just so you're aware of the pros and cons.

The active ingredient in Preen is Trifluralin.

It's banned in the EU, but widely used in the US. Here's some info from [Cornell](http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/pyrethrins-ziram/trifluralin-ext.html)

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluralin)

[Toxipedia](http://www.toxipedia.org/display/toxipedia/Trifluralin)

If you want to use the Preen, you still have to do the heavy weeding first, it won't get rid of all of that biomass. The reason why people keep recommending using a tarp is that the tarp method means you can get away with just chopping the weeds back - not full on weeding - and then putting the tarp over it.

258,"Baked garlic seitan:

Preheat oven to 375F

In one bowl:
2 C vital wheat gluten (which is 75% protein!!!)


5 Tbsp garlic powder

1 Tbsp dried onion

(or sub out the above 6 Tbsp for whatever dried flavorings you prefer - gluten takes all kinds of flavors well)


Bowl 2:

1 3/4 C water

1 1/4 Tbsp light soy sauce

2 Tbsp oil (I use canola, EVOO works if you're going with mediterranean spicing)


Mix dry with dry. Mix wet with wet. Pour wet into dry, stir in only a little. Take pan, pour some oil on it, and smear over the sheet with fingers. Then take now-oily fingers and use it to mix and massage all the ingredients in the bowl. Too much mixing and they don't ""gel"" well, but too much and it'll turn rubbery (also heat will make it turn more rubbery more quickly). Form into patties, place on pan, smoosh onto pan firmly. 1 batch = 1 pan of seitan patties. Throw in oven for 15-17 minutes. Pull out and flip. Return to oven and add tray #2 if you're doing bulk production. Throw in for another 15-17 minutes. Remove from tray and let it cool. Can be eaten immediately, or chopped into smaller pieces, or just thrown in the freezer. Can be added to sandwiches, soups, whatever.

Ebay is your friend for [cheap bulk vital wheat gluten](http://www.ebay.com/p/Large-BULK-Buy-Vital-Wheat-Gluten-50-Lbs-Royal-Lion-Ingredients-Superior-Holland/1263576141).

Clean up: use COLD water to get all the goopy stuff off. Hot water will turn in remnants on dishes into a thick rubbery substance that's a PITA to remove. Also, use plastic bowls and utensils, they're much easier to clean than metal for the same reason.

Once you get the hang of the techniques it's super easy to make.

The thing is, your hamster was never properly socialized. That's not your hamster's fault.

284,"I'm not trying to be a smartass, but the devil is really in the details here. It depends a great deal on where you are located, for one. You can grow year round in a tropical climate. You can grow for 4 months in Alaska. There's huge amounts of variability in the growing season. It's far easier to feed a family of vegans than to feed a family that eats beef at every meal. Once you have your garden infrastructure set up and your rhythms down, it's a lot less work than the beginning, when you're still setting up those sorts of things. It takes years for fruit trees to become productive, unless you're buying older trees, which are more expensive. It takes years to build good soil, unless you're buying high grade agricultural land, which again is expensive. Money will buy you time. You can always just purchase someone else's homestead that is already set up, it will save you years of labor, but it will cost far more than raw land. Projects always take longer than you think.

Buying food from stores: I buy bananas at the store all the time b/c I fucking love bananas. Currently we aren't set up to grow bananas, and even if we were, they would be very seasonal. So I'm always buying bananas. Same with coconut milk. We make huge amounts of soup that we freeze with the coconut milk, but I'm not growing coconut trees. There are homesteaders in Hawaii who do though. I'm not growing exotic spice trees for my cinnamon and nutmeg and chocolate, but my friends homesteading in Florida experiment with it. Location location location. And everyone homesteads differently. I'm just one person, even among the mods we're doing things differently. Jack has a herd of fiber animals.

Humans have selectively bred plants, yes, but that has nothing to do with ""foreign DNA segments"". The only things with ""foreign DNA segments"" are GMOs. If saving seeds from a particular plant and then planting them the next year counts as genetic modification then we've been genetically modifying for thousands of years.

If the cat is in such poor health, you've forfeited your right to ""ownership"".

For bonus change, enable them to keep private savings accounts / have access to microloans, so they can be financially independent of men. On the whole, when women around the world when given access to these kinds of things - literacy, reproductive freedom, access to capital - they choose to have smaller families, and provide their children with a better life than they had. 

Another thing that helps is social stability. One response women in 3rd world countries give for having large families is that they want to be sure that they have kids who survive into adulthood. In more stable environments, that means they're more comfortable choosing to have a smaller family size.

A garden drip system (still need to put that in)

Silicon tape (love that stuff)

I used a z-wave outdoor module to power a 120vac-24vac adapter. Then drilled through my wall (sealed it) and used two wire nuts to lock everything in (Its all low voltage so not SUPER worried about fires).

Added the module to my network and using PLEG (need to buy a license though...but I don't wanna :(.....) And a virtual rain sensor and the weather plugin, I'll be able to control the watering based on the day, temperature, amount of rain expected and almost any other variable.

There's also 7 billion mouths to feed (not to mention things like growing animal feed and biofuels). We're already losing arable land and our population keeps growing, so we're going to have to figure out something.

Gardeners and small specialty farms already do this. Take a raised bed, where they can fill it with bags or even small truckloads of good soil and compost. The raised bed itself can be plopped atop asphalt. But it's not a cost-effective way of growing food, especially cereals/grains/legumes, which is the second largest use of our arable land (the biggest is grazing animals). It's not tomatoes that is tricky here, because people will actually pay money for those, it's stuff like corn and wheat and soy.

""Please RSVP to this facebook event or to dfrankel@ashevillenc.gov if you plan to attend!

The City of Asheville is working with Nelson Nygaard Consulting Associates on a study to examine downtown parking conditions and identify strategies for improvement. One strategy to consider as part of this effort is the introduction of a circulator or shuttle system. A circulator or shuttle system is a short and frequent transit route that provides access to destinations that are just a bit too far to walk to. Circulator and shuttle routes have carefully chosen stops at centers of activity, memorable, frequent schedules, and a brand identity consistent with the areas they serve. 


Representatives from Nelson Nygaard will be facilitating a public workshop on August 17 to get feedback on interest and priorities to consider for this type of service. Possible routes, frequencies and vehicle types will be discussed. 

We are looking forward to hearing your input and ideas!

I don't think it is so simple in that staff is fired or prices increase that dramatically. It hasn't happened in localities where they have been increasing the minimum wage to $15/hr.

Poorer people don't have as many needs met as richer people, so while the rich people put away their excess funds as savings or investments, poorer people are out there buying things.

410,"You're going about it all wrong. Find out what your local market needs and wants and what they're willing to pay for it, and see if you can still cover your costs at what they're willing to pay. You don't just create something and then see if someone wants it, you find out if they want it in the first place.

I live in a local farming mecca. Around here, people either make it to the 5 year point and they're able to pay off loans and bills at that point - or they don't make it at all. Unless you're inheriting or just happen to have a boatloat of cash laying around, you'll be destitute and living on government handouts, at least in the beginning and quite possibly afterwards. It's hard work and you're depending on things you can't control, like the weather, which can make or break you.

Your best bet is to specialize to something unique that your local area doesn't yet produce. Figure out how to make something unique and awesome and market the ever living hell out of it. Don't try to do chickens and cattle and hops, it'll require too much money to set up the infrastructure, get the animals, and get the necessary equipment. Once you have your first niche product down, you can look into either ramping up production of that niche product, or expanding into something related. For instance, raise goats, sell goat milk, then goat cheese and goat soaps and goat meat or something. Don't scrimp on your marketing, it matters at least as much as your actual product. 

Hang out on business subreddits, because in the end, farming is a business. 

I know a guy who sells organically certified microgreens at all the big grocery stores around here and has access to beautiful soil. He's very smart and business savvy, and is a picture of small local farming success. In reality, he and his wife can barely support themselves and their one kid.

418,"&gt; inserting replication timers such that the plant will not continue to breed true after a number of generations

I think you're confused on a few concepts. GMOs are based off of hybrids. There's no ""replication timers"", hybrids just don't breed true. That's also why your statement re: the patent license thing doesn't make much sense, because the seeds are only *designed* to be good for one season.

Farmers are free to buy their seeds from whomever, no one is forcing them to use GMOs or hybrids. There is no guarantee that heirloom seed sellers (which unlike hybrids, DO breed true) won't raise their prices in the future either - and most farmers would rather purchase their seeds rather than to have to deal with owning the equipment for seed harvesting and worrying about seed storage themselves.

A lot of what farmers grow today isn't for human food, not directly. Commodity farmers are growing things like animal feed and biofuels, or plants that will be converted to oils or sugars. We're in a globalized economy now, it's a different game from traditional farming.

Here's an old,  ~11 minute video that might help clear some things up.

422,"Well, frankly, it's not any of your business what women are doing with their bodies. If you don't want to be an OBGYN then by all means, don't go into that field of medicine.

6 abortions is abnormal, most medical providers will only perform up to 3, as the risks to maternal health increase afterwards. Abortions are expensive, at least in the US, so the vast majority of women will do what they can to avoid being in that situation if they can help it. However, at least in the US, as funding is being shut down in various places for Planned Parenthood, as state laws make it harder for medical providers to perform abortions by requiring hospital admitting privileges (this is hard b/c many hospitals - esp in rural areas - have religious affiliation, and therefore won't give such Drs admitting privileges), as not every corner drugstore carries Plan B, the prevalence of shitty abstinence education, and then of course there's a weird culture of sex shaming which makes people esp the young reluctant to do things like buy condoms, none of this works out well in preventing pregnancy. In the US, 50% of pregnancies are unintentional, it's a big public health issue. I've met men who don't know how to properly put on a condom, that's nuts. It's a total failure of our health care system.

Maybe it's different where you are, maybe people are better informed, have better access, and shit isn't so expensive. But this is a complicated and deeply personal matter that goes beyond judging other people for being too stupid. People will always be horny, they will always make some bad decisions in the heat of the moment. Better to help inform them than condemn them, you know?

426,"Welcome to Appalachia! Poverty is a Thing here, despite what glossy brochures may lead one to believe. We do better here in Asheville than in other places, but it's still not easy. We have a housing crisis here, and while new apartments are being built right now, they're aimed at people making a lot more money than minimum wage. I'm actually not sure who they think are going to fill those apartments b/c we have a ton of minimum wage jobs, some trades, and a few managerial white collar jobs and not much in between. But I digress.

We have a *lot* of transient gutterpunks. Most of the actual homeless are too ashamed to make eye contact let alone harass people. In addition to wealthy tourists who are sometimes generous, Asheville is the center for social services in the Western North Carolina region, which further attracts individuals to the downtown region.

Hoteliers have been trying to move social services out of downtown, because they fear that other tourists will have experiences and impressions like yours. There was a big stink about it just this year. We also have had a big controversy around benches in downtown, which elderly residents and tourists enjoy but businesses complained that the homeless were sleeping on - so most of them were removed, or spikes and uncomfortable things were added.

If the business people had their way, there would be zero homeless people downtown, they would be hidden away from the eyes of tourists. If the poorer or socially-minded residents had their way, there would be fewer hotels for wealthy tourists and far more affordable housing built in their place instead so maybe we wouldn't have so many homeless people.

If OP had said that these guys were threatening her in some particular way, if they were going out of their way to make contact and it was menacing, this would be an entirely different conversation.

459,"Hey before you buy any land I highly recommend doing some more reading first. LOTS more reading. And then some in-the-soil experience. You want to be at a point that you can evaluate land yourself, and to get to that point you don't want to rely on strangers on the internet, you want your own research and experience to guide that decision.

[This book is a good starting point](https://www.amazon.com/Soil-Science-Simplified-Helmut-Kohnke/dp/0881338133)

Have you ever grown plants for seeds? It's kind of a niche thing, with special techniques and whatnot. Your best bet is to actually work for a company that is doing what you want to do, at least for a little bit.

The USDA has a soil map of most land in the US. The soils are rated. I wouldn't buy any land without studying the [soil survey](http://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/HomePage.htm) closely. Good agricultural soils will cost you more upfront, but they'll require less work/money/time.

Not all plants grow well in all places. Some regions have endemic diseases that will wipe out your crop. Research will help you here, start googling stuff like ""extension tennessee .edu"" or ""extension ncsu .edu"" to find out what will grow well in the places you are considering. The Extension Service - every state has one - does taxpayer-funded research on how best to grow what where and when. You can also directly ask them questions at extension.org - it's a great resource, don't be afraid to use it.

A lot of seed companies don't actually grow all - or even most - of their own seeds, they contract it out and basically act as a middleman. I have two local seed companies, and both of them consist of warehouses with store fronts and online websites. No land. That's not to say that you can't both grow the seeds and handle the marketing / packaging / distribution yourself, of course. But most seed farmers focus on growing en masse the things that they can grow well. Seed companies pick up their massive variety by contracting with more and more seed farmers.

Go with raised beds, but you can make them hugels (put the logs in the bottom), also recommend looking into lasagna gardening. Start with a small section but with plans to expand. It's easy to go overboard and do to much, then to get overwhelmed later on. But first things first, set up a compost area, so you can be making that black gold! Plain brown corrugated cardboard (tape / staples removed) makes a great and free weedblock. Mulch everything as if your life depended on it. Depending on where you live, in case you're in the USA some counties/municipalities have free mulch or compost.

If you make a basic sketch of your property, including the cardinal directions, r/gardening will be able to give you a lot of suggestions. Also if you share where you're located on the planet (roughly) and/or hardiness/heat zone they can help make specific plant suggestions, since gardening has a pretty local aspect to it. What to plant and when to plant it depends on local conditions/climate.

The real trick with small spaces is to go vertical, so look into raised garden bed designs that incorporate/support trellising somehow.

Last and not least, see if you can't make some local homesteading/gardening friends, maybe through a gardening club or something. Folks can be generous with their seeds and plant cuttings, which can be extremely helpful when getting started.

[We have a section of our FAQ/wiki dedicated to home building/retrofitting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homesteading/wiki/index). My best suggestion is to learn all about passive solar design. It's the fundamental basis for energy efficient structures, regardless of if they're build of mud or wood or concrete or whatever. You have to think about air flow and water flow in relation to the land, which means it's hard to think or plan a structure before you have a piece of land in mind. The most successful structures are designed in situ.

My second best suggestion is to actually visit some nearby natural homes in your area. You may find that if you're in a humid climate they aren't very comfortable at all - fun enough to camp in or something but not agreeable enough for year round living. 

The biggest issue with natural earth built homes is the labor. Somewhere in there, people run out of time, they run out of friends willing to donate time, and they have a half-built mud home out in the middle nowhere. To create even a small, one-room structure takes many hundreds of man hours - no joke. There's lots of threads on the internet of people bitching about their unfinished earthen homes, realizing that they got in over their heads and now don't know what to do with the property. That's not to say that none of them are completed, but the failure rate is pretty high. I actually live not too far from an ecovillage, where they have group land and help each other out and a decent system of governance - i.e., a well run place - and even they have a lot of unfinished structures because it takes years to finish these things, especially when you live and work elsewhere.

The only ""fast"" way to get into homesteading is to buy someone else's homestead or be lucky enough to inherit. Many homesteaders don't get their own property until they're in their 30s - or older.

If you have any free time right now, I'd recommend volunteering with your nearest habitat for humanity, or similar project where you could get experience in building structures meant for human habitation. It'll give you great practical experience with which to inform your house designs and general life plans.

Good luck and keep us updated.

508,"&gt; I have a list of people who are 'almost' willing to come on out and make it work in a communish style. 

Even if they are helping to purchase the land, do not count on them or their labor. Tons of homesteaders have been promised by good friends and family the same thing, only to be let down. If they aren't serious enough to make the move in the first place, don't expect them to spend their precious vacation time doing unfamiliar manual labor out in a rural location somewhere. 

There's tons of dreamers out there, but very few doers.

That said, IME you're better off going with a smaller but higher quality tract of land. You'll save tons of money if you do the land clearing yourself, which is something actually doable on a smaller chunk of land. Same with building of the soil, which as you acknowledge will take years. Unless you're just looking to burn money I'd go smaller. 

Remember that everything is more expensive that you think and takes longer than you think. Equipment will fail, bad weather will happen, no one will show up when they say they will because it turns out city life is damn convenient and comfortable and you can order pizza there for delivery, etc. ",2016-07-16 01:00:22+00:00,d5e1vdj,3.0,t1_d5dt4z3,14375.0,homestead

518,"We never did get water officially on site (they still don't, actually). We ended up doing several things:

1) Built a (unpermitted) pond. It was dug by hand, lined with a used billboard. Used billboards are made of the same stuff that fancy pondliners are made out of, just at a fraction of a price. They're huge though, and not exactly inexpensive - just cheaper. It collected rainwater and in times of desperation, we'd bucket it out. Home Depot has a little pond that is very high quality for ~$35 last I checked. There's also summer pools meant for kids or dogs, though those will degrade over time from UV exposure. Ponds are awesome and attract all kinds of wildlife, if nothing else.

2) Rainwater. We managed to get some rain barrels through the city parks department community garden program. You can really just use a garbage can though, if you can affix a spigot near the bottom, and put a mesh screen on the top/put in a goldfish. Again, UV likes to destroy things, so you might want to get a tougher garbage can if you can manage it. If you're lucky you can find a structure with gutters (like your neighboring house?) and just put the rain barrel under the gutter. Or you can build a basic structure and use metal roofing - that stuff is the best for collecting rainwater - and aim the slope to the barrel. You might be able to find gutters around your neighborhood or at your nearest metal recycling facility.

3) We also had a little creek at the bottom of the hill. At one point we had some volunteers and were planting fruit trees, so we had the volunteers lug buckets of water out of the creek.

4) Mulch will help hold in any water you are able to provide.

519,"Off the top of my head:

1) Decide if you're going to guerrilla garden or go legit. The latter may require wading through bureaucracy or finding helpful people who know how to navigate the system. If you're going to go guerrilla, check out r/guerrillagardening and past posts there. Guerrilla is easier to start, but those gardens have a far more precarious future and you may have difficulty getting grants.

2) Find nearby like-minded people who are willing to actually do work. This is hard. It helps tremendously if they have gardening experience and/or grant writing experience. Grants will help you get projects funded in your garden.

3) Choose your space well. Do you have any way of getting water? Are there working street lights nearby? Good sunlight? Is it flat? How much garbage are you going to have to clean up? How convenient is the location for you and those who will form the labor backbone of your garden?

4) All urban community gardens have to find a balance between being welcoming, and surviving. There are bored people who will destroy things for the hell of it, there are people who will steal anything they can get their hands of if they think it is worth something. Our tomato thefts went down when we installed a fence and gate around the beds (the fence was more psychological than anything else, it was only 3' high). 

5. Think carefully about what you choose to grow. Large tomatoes will be stolen right off the vine, so we switched to cherry tomatoes and had plentiful harvests. Growing more unusual edible plants also deters theft. Flowers are a good way to attract pollinators and help beautify things. You can buy black oil sunflower seeds - usually sold as bird feed - for incredibly cheap. 

6. As for dealing with urban soils, you can either contact your extension service about what tests they recommend or garden using raised and lined beds for edible foods only. You can use the sunflowers for some bioremediation, but it means that at the end of the season to not eat them, not harvest their seeds, but to toss them in the garbage.

See if you can find any resources in your area. Are there other nearby community gardens and community gardeners? Does your city or county offer free compost or mulch (or does anyone nearby)? Can you befriend an arborist to drop off mulch at your garden? Is there free mulch on Craigslist or Freecycle? Does the Detroit parks department have any sort of community gardening programs? This may be helpful - http://msue.anr.msu.edu/topic/info/community_gardening

If you can, visit nearby community gardens. Study how they do things, talk to them, find out what works and what doesn't. How often do they have work days, how many people actually show up, how much do they charge for a plot, where do they get their materials, etc. Some may be friendlier than others. 

Clover makes an excellent groundcover and will attract pollinators. It can be tricky to start, and may require seeding a bit every year until you get a nice thick stand. You might consider doing your garden paths with a layer of plain brown corrugated cardboard (tape and staples removed), a layer of mulch, and eventually some white clover on top. 

Ok I know that's a wall of text but I just found something awesome for you, here's a PDF from Detroit on their program for acquiring land for a project like yours - https://www.law.msu.edu/clinics/food/Powersfact.pdf

521,"I used to run a community garden, before I moved. The garden gave some kids in the section 8/HUD housing next door a sense of purpose, a place they could be that they were invested in / felt like it belonged to them. Hauling watering cans around, weeding, and then eating fresh fruit from the plants afterwards were all activities that gave them some educational fun and a sense of self respect as they reaped the rewards of their labor. There were hiccups, of course - like one kid who cut off the blooming rose to give to his mom - but this was a new and weird thing being created just beyond their fence. Gardening itself was new and novel. 

What you're missing is that community gardens are actually more about community than gardening.

As for entitlement making people inclined to disrespect other people's property, that's not my experience at all. People alienated from nature, from their community, do not give a shit about such things. Why should they? If they think no one gives a shit about them or their things, why should they care about others? 

Our biggest problem in the garden was certain bougie ass white people automatically saw all black people - including children - as there to do harm, and overreacted to the fantasies playing out in their heads. That was wholly counterproductive. And the most entitled person involved in the whole project was the very rich neighbor - a medical doctor - who stripped all the tomatoes off the vine, because she thought all those plants were grown for her or some bullshit.

I'm sure it's different everywhere, but I wouldn't discount what happens when you create - or at least try to create - a local community space meant for all people.

[Paraquat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraquat), mentioned in the SI link, requires a specialized license to use in the USA, the average homeowner can't get their hands on it. It's been widely known to be toxic since at least the early 80s - [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1650884/?page=1)

There was a panic when it came out that cannabis in Mexico had been sprayed with it, in an attempt to kill it - yet that Cannabis ended up in being smoked by Americans.

The [Rotenone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotenone) is interesting, it's approved for organic use since it comes from plants and has a long history of being used for catching fish. But yes, it's toxic, even the WHO agrees on that. Currently it is mainly used to kill exotic invasive fish in ponds...

The third thing mentioned by name is [Benomyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benomyl), a fungicide made by Dupont. They were sued a LOT for it over the years - it was blamed for some terrible birth defects - and they eventually stopped producing it although other companies still do. It doesn't really work anymore anyway, the critters evolved past it.

There's enough documentation of various chemicals used over the years being toxic to human health that we don't have to exaggerate how bad things can be. Agent Orange is a 50/50 combo of 2,4,5 T and 2,4 D. [2,4,5 T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic_acid) was discontinued in the 1970s. [2,4D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic_acid) is still around and in use - I personally know folks who use it. When something becomes glyphosate/roundup resistant, farmers reach for 2,4D, which is def more toxic than glyphosate.

Of note the WHO views 2,4D as less carcinogenic than eating processed meat, but after reading a bunch of toxicology reports I suspect it's a lot worse than that (although to be fair I don't eat processed meat either). ",2016-06-22 20:58:11+00:00,d4jwymj,4.0,t1_d4jr5np,7018.0,science
568,"This is a crappy, alarmist article on a complicated issue, and they cribbed from Inquistr who cribbed from mlive. The Michigan Right to Farm legislation was originally intended to protect farmers in rural areas. Urban folks started showing up in rural areas, and then didn't like living next to farms, and started to create a ruckus. The legislation was designed to legally protect those rural farmers. It was never meant to protect anyone in suburban or urban areas. There's a whole bunch of parts to it, including things like how manure runoff and odor is managed and how to set up a cranberry farm. IF a farmer is compliant with these guidelines, then they are insulated from nuisance lawsuits.

As I read it, the new legislation leaves things up to local Michigan gov'ts as to how they want to handle things, and it's all based on zoning. So if you're in a dense urban area zoned residential and you decide you want to set up a serious livestock operation, you're not legally protected against your neighbors challenging you - which is the case in most areas anyway.

Tourism, the biggest industry here, generally pays shit as I'm sure you're aware. Asheville also has the highest cost of living in NC.

""Of the insecticides, neonicotinoids and pyrethroids were the most common in the pollen samples and pose the highest risks to bees, Krupke said. While both are toxic to bees, they differ in their relative risk levels. Neonicotinoids are more poisonous to bees but are primarily used on agricultural land. Conversely, **pyrethroids are typically used where pollinators are likely to be - near homes and gardens with a diversity of flowering plants** - potentially exposing bees to higher levels of chemicals and on a more frequent basis. The study showed distinct spikes of pyrethroids in August and September, months when many homeowners spray these chemicals to knock out mosquitoes, hornets and other nuisance pests.

[It's even happened here in the US, back in the early 70s.](http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe70s/money_03.html) 

As it is, we're running out of topsoil due to erosion and tillage, sprawl means that we keep turning farmland into residential areas, we're running out of freshwater in many parts of the world, the #1 loss of forests globally is for agriculture (usually for growing animal feed or spaces for herd animals to graze) and no one really knows what the hell is going to happen regarding global climate change. Farms just can't move north if they feel like it, a lot of those more northern soils are thin and don't support much life, let alone agriculture.

In the meantime, the population keeps growing and as people become richer they want to eat more meat... one way to look at this is that farmers are just producing what we want. If one doesn't want to support monoculture, that's fine, they can support [their local farmers](http://www.localharvest.org/).

714,"The basic wood frame you can still work with, but if you want to go vertical I'd recommend ripping out the metal mesh and small containers, and instead using either more wood or even gutters to build horizontal beds within the frame itself. Small containers are extremely high maintenance because they dry out quickly, and therefore require such frequent watering to be impractical in most climates. The more you can pool the soil together in one place, the more water it will hold. Bigger containers = less watering, less maintenance.

You could them attach an irrigation line to the very top and let it drip down, or integrate it into the horizontal beds attached to the frame that you build. 

Another thing to consider is how much root space and general space the plants will want. Some plants that can take small root / vertical growing are: lettuces, strawberries, chives, thyme, nasturtiums, and marigolds. 

I'd save the metal mesh, it'll work great for any climbing plants. But whoever designed this didn't do so for practicality reasons.

733,"So the deal with clay is that it's subsoil. You can till it, but unless you're adding something coarse in there like mulch, it won't get you very far, especially not in the short term. The easiest way to deal with clay soil is to just build raised beds on top of it - no tilling necessary, just build up as you had planned with cardboard and soil/compost on top. Don't worry about compaction at this point - clay is the smallest soil particle size and you're going to compact it anyway. The goal is to create a nice place with the compost and the cardboard that microbial life and earthworms will do the un-compacting for you in the future.

IF you keep tilling it, you'll further pulverize it, and destroy what little organic matter remains in it. Some people will till once to establish a bed, but know that repeated tilling is incredibly destructive to soil health. Personally I've only gardened on clay soils but never tilled. Building up is so much easier. I'd just build the beds directly where you want them, clumpy soil or no clumpy soil, and just start building. You might have the smooth out the paths though it sounds like - water will make that very easy.",2016-04-09 15:58:34+00:00,d1w8keh,1.0,t3_4e1ojz,1374.0,gardening

* He was the popular and moderate mayor of Charlotte for 14 years, earning a reputation as someone who worked well with others regardless of party and generally got stuff done. He also ran as a moderate, it's just that when he hit the gov office he's been anything but. A lot of centrists / independents / pragmatists voted for him and have been horrified ever since.

* The dems didn't have anyone decent to run against him. They really fucked it up. I think the dem party was overconfident (Obama won the state in 2008) and also a poorly run mess. Dem party leadership has been in a tailspin for quite a few years. 

* The old gov was a dem and people were just pretty tired of her. She never really inspired a lot of passion in people anyway and then Mcrory showed up with his record of accomplishing good things, so he just seemed like the obvious candidate to pick.

781,"It's actually an old gardening trick to just buy a bag of soil (with fertilizer included) and just to shove seedlings in them. It's low effort, as long as you can keep the soil adequately moist (which may mean living in a wet area, or having a way to get water to where your sacks of plants are). 

However, the plastic bag that the soil comes in will degrade and become brittle, so you can end up making a mess of garbage if there's too much UV exposure. How long that process will take depends on where you're located, what climate, bag thickness, etc.

Another thing to consider: 5 gallon buckets, with a few holes drilled near the base for drainage. See if you can find some with good handles so if you want to transport them you can (though note a 5 gallon bucket with moist soil and plants can get pretty heavy). General rule of thumb is you can get one good sized tomato or pepper plant per bucket. I recommend cherry/small-fruited tomatoes if you go this route.

If you can't find a good place to straight up guerrilla garden, you might try a swap, you'll give the landowner some fresh food/flowers/herbs/whatever in exchange for letting you grow on their land and access to their water. 

You might be able to scrounge up the buckets for free, but buying the bags of soil can get expensive, so definitely consider what your budget will be for this project. If you're in the US, check to see if your city or county offers free compost - you can always cut the bags of soil with some compost.

Most recently the process for growing and harvesting hemp for cannabinoid extraction has been through intensive management of individual plants in a greenhouse environment. The scientist grows the plant, harvests the parts they want, hangs it upside to dry and then individually processes each plant.

Things to consider: how will you make money, the more remote you are the harder this can be. There's fewer jobs in rural areas, and the jobs that are here tend to be lower paying. Water water water and growing season. Idaho has a crap growing season. Also, make certain your Australian partner is happy living year round in cold northern climates.

It's a lot easier to make good money in the city though, unless you can do full-time telecommuting. So you might start thinking about looking around for land+communities that seem desirable, maybe start picking up some DIY skills on the side (come hang out on /r/homesteading!), as you put away more of a nest egg.

To be friendly with a cat, don't stare with with wide open eyes, rather look at them with heavy-lidded eyes and slowly blink. Sometimes if they like you, they'll blink back. 

Oh and meowing is a thing they do only with humans, because they realize that we're too stupid to read their body language effectively. 

A lot of people get confused about cats because they don't have that many facial muscles, and we're kind of used to looking at faces for signals of what other lifeforms might be thinking or feeling.

The permafrost soils that characterize the Arctic and sub-Arctic tundra cover roughly 8 percent of the global land surface but hold half of Earth’s underground organic carbon and twice as much carbon as is currently in the atmosphere.

Arctic tundra stores carbon during the summer and releases some of it during the winter. But a new study shows that carbon released during the winter now outweighs the summertime gains, resulting in a net loss of carbon to the atmosphere.

According to the study’s authors, these results suggest the northern tundra may be shifting from its historical role as a carbon sink to a carbon source. To date, the Arctic has warmed more than any other region globally and researchers expect this warming to continue in the coming decades. If the tundra becomes a carbon source, it could amplify global warming and accelerate climate change, according to the authors.""",2016-02-12 18:15:00+00:00,czxk777,1.0,t3_45fzsn,293.0,collapse

The only successful passive solar (not electrically heated) greenhouses I know of in zone 6ish are out in Colorado - http://www.pennandcordsgarden.com/greenhouses.html - check out all the earth + black barrels filled with water they use for thermal mass. Their windows are likely double-paned as well, at least double-walled polycarbonate for the lower roof. Even indoors, they still use cloches (the plastic bottles over the plants) for additional warmth and protection. There is some geometric math involved in these designs, based on latitude, and note that the wall of black barrels is always on the north side of the building. 

We had a geodesic greenhouse and we found it to be a cool idea in theory, but it turned out to be not so practical for use in practice.

One thing that you might consider if you're adamant about a geodesic design with light coming through every window is just heating the aquaponic beds with electric water heat things, like the ones for aquariums.

So then people presented you - I think - with various pro-GMO stuff and you said you don't know enough about the science or technology to evaluate their claims. I'm not certain what kind of evidence you are looking for here, then. Do you want to learn more about the science behind it? Or do you want to focus on the patent system that these companies did not in fact create but do benefit from, thanks to part to activists wanting extensive regulation?

The thing is, as I think has been mentioned to you prior, this whole patent thing is not new in agriculture. [It started in 1930](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_Patent_Act_of_1930), thanks in part to Luther Burbank who developed a TON of useful edible plants (some of which we still eat today). The 1930s are also around when hybrids were invented. Hybrids were developed through plant breeding. They took (and continue to take) years to develop, but they offer better characteristics than the old heirloom varieties - things like better disease resistance and higher yields. The patents are a way of reimbursing the seed developers who took the time to develop them. Same things happen with fruit trees too, those things take decades to breed and develop, so hell yes they want that patent. That's how they recoup the cost of their investment. It is deeply unfortunate that the whole GMO ""debate"" became conflated with things that protect plant breeders that have been around for ages. 

There used to be tons more people involved with plant breeding, but it's very expensive, takes forever, and there's more regulatory hoops (yet more time and money) to get through than ever. Most GMOs aka biotech are actually tiny genetic tweaks to hybrids, that must be tested extensively. That's how we've ended up with fewer and fewer biotech companies, it became too expensive for most universities, who previously also did this kind of research. Yet, there's still seeds being sold, there's still new fruit trees being developed, and if you want heirlooms there's tons of small seed companies out there doing great business (they won't sell you fancy biotech agricorn, but then most people aren't looking to grow animal feed/biofuels).

""Now more than ever, America is a Nation of meat eaters. In 2000, total meat consumption (red meat, poultry, and fish) reached 195 pounds (boneless, trimmed-weight equivalent) per person, 57 pounds above average annual consumption in the 1950s (table 2-1). Each American consumed an average of 7 pounds more red meat than in the 1950s, 46 pounds more poultry, and 4 pounds more fish and shellfish. Rising consumer incomes, especially with the increase in two-income households, and meat prices in the
1990s that were often at 50-year lows, when adjusted for inflation, explain much  of the increase in meat consumption. In addition, the meat industry has provided scores of new brand-name, val-
ue-added products processed for consumers’ convenience, as well as a host of products for foodservice operators""

""As for the Greek oligarchs, their misrule long predates the crisis.

As one eminent Greek economist told me last week: “These guys have avoided paying tax through the Metaxas dictatorship, the Nazi occupation, a civil war and a military junta.” They had no intention of paying taxes as the troika began demanding Greece balance the books after 2010, which is why the burden fell on those Greeks trapped in the PAYE system – a workforce of 3.5 million that fell during the crisis to just 2.5 million.""

1164,"This is where the permaculture concept of zones is helpful. You want multiple beds, and to grow multiple things in each bed. The beds furthest from the house should be the ones that require the least maintenance and care, usually your perennials. The ones that require more care and/or are more frequently harvested, you'll want those near as possible. The problem with figuring out what plants to grow together is that there's a lot of horseshit masquerading as knowledge around the topic, so to a certain extent you'll just have to figure out what works where you are. What you want to avoid doing is planting things that are closely related next to each other, so be sure to look at the latin names of things. By mixing the plants up (and throw in some flowers too, to attract pollinators), you can significantly decrease your pest pressures.

Multiple beds opens things up, you can do stuff like alter a particular bed to be particularly alkaline to grow plants that prefer alkaline conditions, or particularly acidic to grow plants that prefer acidic conditions. You can set up a bed to really well draining for plants that want that, you can set up a bed in a boggy area for plants that prefer those conditions.

1179,"A financial game plan. A social game plan if you're moving to a drastically different area, especially culturally. A romantic game plan (do you have a partner yet? if you want one it's much easier to find them in areas with population density than before moving to some place rural). A water plan, including long term projections for the region (drought? how much precip per year on average? can you legally collect the water? can you get water on site? how is the health of the aquifer?). 

Consider instead of building from scratch, finding some place that needs some TLC. It's still a ton of work, but less work - you can save a lot of time and money via rehabbing/retrofitting. Overall, there's still more people leaving rural areas than moving in, so there are some deals to be had.

Also, I recommend checking out our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homesteading/wiki/index) and the sidebar. Growing season in Montana is shit, California and Oregon are known for being total PITA re: regulations. Think where you want to locate yourself strategically. You want water, sun, good soil, and I'd recommend at least USDA zone 6 if not higher. The lower zones tend to mean shorter growing seasons, which can dramatically decrease your ability to be self-sufficient.

I also recommend building as many skills as possible where you are right now. You might learn that you're really amazing at something, and it pulls you in a particular direction, like say working with fiber rabbits and handspinning their fur or something. Or it turns out that you can't fucking stand dealing with chickens. You'll want to know things like these BEFORE throwing down a lot of money on some strange land and money on animals and money on building their infrastructure. Pick up skills and find people in your area who are doing what you want to do, even if they're only doing it on a very small scale.

1184,"I've never grown in a tropical place, but in order to prevent erosion it's good to have something covering your soil, be it mulch or an easy-to-deal-with-grass or a cover crop that enriches the soil. If you repeatedly cut your grass, you can actually build your soil that way by using it as a mulch. You could save using the glyphosate on only the really hard to kill weeds, which would save you money on chemicals. If you're only managing an acre, then cutting sounds doable. Good soil grows good plants.

Once the coconuts are more mature, you might consider intercropping with something else, and there's probably some good leguminous (pea and bean) cover crops you could put down at that point. I'm not sure what would work in your area, but here's some suggestions from [India](http://www.coconutboard.nic.in/package1.htm) and [Sri Lanka under ""cover crops in coconut lands""](http://www.cri.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=90&amp;lang=en).

1193,"It really depends on a lot of factors, which is why this is /r/homesteading instead of /r/smallfarming. Homesteading is much more attainable for the average individual. There's self-sufficiency, as in growing or creating a lot of what you eat/DIY lifestyle/etc., maybe selling a few value added products on the side (homesteading), and then there's earning a living by running a full time on-site business (farming), and that's a whole 'nother level (these are just my rough personal definitions). 

It all depends on your business savvy and market conditions: can you produce something that your local market demands, at a price that you actually profit from? Can you get access to capital in the form of loans to build the business, or expand the business? If you aren't near your market, how far are you willing or able to commute? How solid is your marketing and outreach? How much labor will be required to make these products, and can you afford to hire employees at a living wage? How much competition is there already in your local market, can you fill a niche? If you're already selling online, then you have some idea of how all of this works. Start working on a business plan and doing local market research to see if it's viable. If you're in the US, you can reach out to your local Extension Service for assistance.

Even a lot of large scale farmers work ""normal"" jobs just to keep the lights on. Most homesteaders work a variety of jobs, not all of them on them homestead.

You can get (or borrow, maybe) one of those [kill-o-watt meter](http://www.amazon.com/P3-International-P4460-Electricity-Monitor/dp/B000RGF29Q)s, to figure out what you're running in your house that might be using so much.

And deep freezers these days are extremely energy efficient. You can also look into thermal solar for your hot water, can be a complicated system to create but they can seriously bring down electrical bills.

1238,"Depending on how far along the plant is with bud development and blooming, you're looking at crop failure for the upcoming season when seasonal cold temperatures come roaring back a few weeks later. Same reason why late frosts are dreaded. There's some tweaks you can use for late frosts but they only help for a few degrees of F, they won't help you through actual winter. Once a flower has bloomed, it won't bloom again that season.

There's a chart on this for blooms, let me see if I can dig it up for you.... http://www.hrt.msu.edu/faculty/langg/Fruit_Bud_Hardiness.html

One thing people don't mention much is the amount of arable land on the planet. Per capita, the USA still has the most in the world. That means that if nothing else, there will be food here, it can be grown here, and you can grow it too if you're so interested. Depending on where you are in the US, you can find areas with plentiful water (and Canada has tons). 

If you don't think there's much future for you in the US, def look at Canada. They have much better social services. Both can support their populations from what they can grow on their land. Not all countries can.

Remember that not that long ago Europe was a war-filled mess and has a history as such, whereas no one is invading the US.

Go ahead and expect that you'll kill a lot of plants in this process. We all kill plants. Just accept it, and keep planting, try to learn from mistakes.

Blue collar work is available, but know that many blue collar workers cannot afford to actually live in Asheville proper. The mountains and river + the city's money troubles in the last century means that we're behind in various kinds of infrastructure b/c it's extra expensive to build things here. There's a big backlog on things like sidewalks.

What separates Asheville from other nearby similarly beautiful towns through this part of Appalachia is that it was pretty much created by wealthy people who weren't from here. It was a playground for wealthy New Yorkers back in the day; tourism has been a thing here for over a hundred years.

The state government *loathes* Asheville - it may be similar to Austin in that regard - and the state gov't pretty much tries to screw the city over any chance it can, which really holds things back.

I recommend reading over our giant FAQ on the sidebar, it gives some idea of what this place is like. You might also consider Knoxville or Chattanooga.

How much experience do you or your SO have with homesteading? Do y'all have a lot of skills already? Will her job transfer to NH? Will she be okay socially with living on 10 acres in cold ass NH? Is she okay with scrounging with less than ideal, as a tradeoff to start sooner rather than later? Is she joining you in this tent? If she  changes her mind at any point in this process, where does that leave you?

Are you looking for raw land, or something already set up? If you have found land that you already like, can you get internet or cell reception there (if you want either of those things?). Satellite sucks ass.

None of us got to where we are quickly. This is a long term game, and even once you get your property, it's still a long term game unless you buying something already set up (and even then, it's still a long term game - never-ending maintenance, repairs, and fruit trees will teach you this, if nothing else). 

Also that MEKA thing is pretty but it looks hella inefficient. In NH I'd go full on passive solar design. [Here's an old but pretty good PDF on it](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/old/17257.pdf).

1313,"""In Paris, Vilsack will moderate a panel as part of the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture, of which the U.S. is a founding member last year. The alliance's goal is to get more focused efforts by governments and private groups to work globally on reducing agricultural emissions and improve adaptation strategies for farmers.

""So it gives us a chance to sort of contribute to the conversation, to put a marker down that climate is going to impact agriculture and that, in turn, is going to impact global food security,"" Vilsack said. ""That could slow down the progress that we have seen in the last decade or so in reducing the amount of global food insecurity.""

...

""Through agricultural practices, farms sequester or prevent the emissions amounting to about 60 million tons of carbon annually. Vilsack and the administration will also commit the U.S. to double U.S. agriculture's sequestration or emission reductions to 120 million tons saved annually over the next decade.

If those numbers are realized, Vilsack said agriculture would effectively factor into roughly 2% of the 26 to 28% of emission reductions the administration seeks to achieve by 2025.""

...

""The reason we are going to COP 21 is because we want agriculture to be recognized for what they bring to the table,"" Yoder said at a recent forum in Minneapolis. ""Instead of looking at agriculture and farmers as the culprit for all of these different things, we think there are solutions in agriculture.""

The alliance is championing intensified agricultural production on land already in use as a way to avoid putting more environmentally sensitive lands into production.

""Farmers have to do things in a way they can produce food, feed, fiber and energy, and do it in a way that is efficient so they can farm another day,"" Yoder said.

...

""""If you want a driver for change, then there it is,"" Sadler said. ""Because the reality is every other (industry) sector is doing something about it.""

Sadler said he believes U.S. farmers are increasingly changing their perspectives on climate change. He joked that just a few years ago, bringing up the topic at a farm meeting in the Midwest would get a guy run out of the meeting. ""Now, everyone is nodding and the farmer is saying, 'yeah, what are we doing about that?'"" he said.

""But we have to get away from the emotional rhetoric that is just clogging that conversation,"" Sadler said.

Sadler also said the world food map is going to look very different in 2050 and beyond. U.S. agriculture is going to see the effects of warmer temperatures and long-term depletion of groundwater in parts of the country. ""The U.S. won't be exporting 35% of global grains in 2050. You are running out of water. You are so far over your own regional boundaries, you won't be there,"" Sadler said.

1377,"A couple of books to read around the house aren't a bad idea - you might be able to find them at your local library (if not, ask the librarian for help, maybe they can hook you up). We've got some highly regarded ones in the wiki ( [the one on soil science is affordable and I've found it invaluable](http://www.amazon.com/Soil-Science-Simplified-Helmut-Kohnke/dp/0881338133) ), although I pull most of my information for free from the internet via university/extension websites. 

The US has this taxpayer-funded program called the Extension Service, every state has one, and most counties have a local office. Depending on how well they're funded, they offer all kinds of locally-based research, info, and advice to help people grow food, raise animals, and generally be more self-sufficient. Their audience ranges from small homeowners to large farmers. Some of them also offer affordable but high quality soil tests, some offer local classes, it just depends. You can always ask questions via extension.org and they'll know about things that'll work well in your area. For instance, I asked my local extension for suggestions on disease-resistant low acid yellow tomatoes that would do well here, and they sent me a list of varieties to plant. 

One thing to consider is that instead of raising your own pig, maybe you can grow/hunt something else desirable and trade with your neighbors, or maybe chip in with friends/neighbors to buy a whole butchered animal of choice, and then everyone divides it up. That way you still get fresh local meat, but it saves you the hassle, cost, vet care, social needs (herd animals get neurotic if they don't have a good herd), and land that the animal requires to be healthy and happy instead of trying to raise it yourself. 

We have a large, energy-efficient deep freezer and I love the thing. My partner was hesitant to get one so large, thought it would be overkill, but has since realized the genius of my decision. 

Anyway, aside from extension.org, you can also google something like 'topicofinterest extension .edu' - there's tons and tons of free info out there, just requires digging to find it. A lot of books use the extension as their source, so it can be better to just go directly TO the source.

The biggest issue with books and even articles that you can randomly find on the internet is that there are authors out there telling people how to do things when they haven't done them themselves, and they just spew really unrealistic crap. There's downsides to everything, even in homesteading, so be wary of anybody who promises something that sounds too good to be true. Hope this helps!

1378,"Sounds like you're looking in a pretty good area for your goals. The steep slopes with erosion are going to be *very* limiting, animals there would just compound that unless you're into smaller things like chickens and bees. Goats might be okay, depending on some things. Pigs can really wreck land, I personally wouldn't have them on anything sloping that has erosion problems. Based on that description, I'd assume it's basically 2 acres of land, and you might be able to get some timber out of the woods if the trees there are any good. If there's any slope to the land, start checking out topo maps and bing and google earth, so you can really see it in 3D. 

The other thing with steep slopes is you can't get much equipment back there. But if they're mentioning erosion issues I'd definitely reconsider the property, b/c that's just another big issue to fix, and it may impact the house too.

You can always share photos of potential properties here (you can share their links directly, or upload them on [imgur](https://imgur.com/) ) and get opinions from the community as well.

There's damaged flat land, and then there's damaged sloping land - which is a whole other game entirely. Flat land is much much much easier to fix (and even then, it takes years). Sloping land you start get into retaining wall or landslide territory.

Also if you're trying to fence off for deer, that can get expensive really quick (they can easily jump over 6' fences - 8' is recommended), so don't underestimate the cost of materials there. 2 acres could give you a large veggie garden, fruit trees, chickens, chicken run, small greenhouse, small pond, bees. I wouldn't give up any of the land for hay, you'll get way more bang for your buck with the other things. $0.02",2015-11-12 21:37:04+00:00,cwy5mz1,5.0,t1_cwy1ei2,6117.0,Homesteading
1379,"&gt;is there a way to rehabilitate the soil or alter it to make it so we can use it? 

Yes, but it can take YEARS to fix - time, money, effort - so know that upfront. Don't expect good yields at first. What some people do is grow plants on the best soil, but let their livestock live on the lesser-quality soil. Stocking rates for animals vary on the land itself though, so the better the land, the more animals it can support.

I actually recommend getting smaller pieces of high quality land than getting a lot of not-great land, but that's just me. We looked at several properties that were 20+ acres but the land was basically unusable for anything but timber, so we opted instead for 5 better acres that also put us in range of things we care about like high speed internet access and a not-terrible commute into town. 

Everyone handles it differently.

1415,"I don't know how bad she really is, so I'm going to spell out a pretty bad scenario in general. It may or may not apply to your situation:

I wouldn't text if you're upset. You want to be calm and clear-headed, especially when you're interacting with her. The thing is she probably knows how to push all your buttons, and what you want is to avoid that *entirely*. You don't want to be upset, you don't want to fly off the handle, you don't want to play her shitty games. She may not know anything else than these shitty games, but you don't want to be dragged down with her.

Instead I'd just think over things a bit, take some deep breaths, think about what kind of relationship you'd like to have with her - what does the realistic best case scenario look like? There's probably some great subreddits or websites full of specific advice for this sort of thing. You can also write some paper drafts of the text to consider sending her. You want to keep things factual, so she has less room to argue. She'll probably want to make this all about the hamster or how you're overreacting, you'll want to point out how her behavior is not only incredibly disrespectful, but now you cannot trust her around your pets or in your home, because she's demonstrated by her own behavior that she isn't trustworthy. Actions speak so much louder than words. 

Don't give her keys to your place and if you have, change the locks. It sounds crazy, but what she said and then how she acted behind your back are NOT good signs. You want to be as independent from her as possible. She is not entitled to access your home, she is not entitled access to your pets or family, she is not entitled to break your rules. Until she respects you - and she may never, she may not even know how to respect - you'll have to keep your guard up.

You'll want to not just tell her about your feelings, but enforce boundaries. 

Imagine that this wasn't your hamster, but your newborn infant. How would you respond?

Just remember, your house, your rules. It's her responsibility to obey the rules, it's your responsibility to enforce your own rules. If she's sneaking behind you to do shit you don't want to your pets, can you imagine how she's going to be in the future? I'd nip this behavior in the bud.

Homesteading involves a huge range of activities, so I think most people can find some part of it they'd find interesting and/or enjoyable, if they'd only just look.

Familial opinion is less important IME. We have a little space set aside for guests, and as our home and land develop, they're all coming around and understanding that what looked like a batshit crazy idea was actually pretty smart.

And then you can make a special planted tank with plants, where they can come in and eat and tear things up. This way you aren't exposing your hamster to all the light and water during their daily life, since Syrians hamsters are nocturnal creatures from desert environments.

This is my favorite hamster home of all time - http://www.ikeahackers.net/2009/12/expedit-hamster-home.html

This is my favorite rat home of all time, which includes a removable planted space - http://plantyhamchuk.tumblr.com/post/116046172306/luxury-oasis-for-pet-rats-critter-nation-mod-by

In the first link, they mention that hamsters can't see red, in which case you might consider using red LEDs to grow the plants. But in general I'd be very careful about water in a tank, some hamsters can get into a lot of trouble, and being wet can make them very ill. Since you mention you won't be around much, I'd really take that into account. And yes, I'd expect them to tear things up, they'll probably want to eat and burrow underneath. Incidentally, this will likely make them very happy.

These guys went out of their way to pressure vulnerable women to have sex with them, and then wrote about it graphically.

OP: ""Thanks for the answer. What size community should I be looking at if I'm extremely interested in bartering? Is 200+ acceptable?

My plan is to live off grid, and do beekeeping, chickens, vegetables, hunting, and maybe fishing if the area supports it. Then I'm just going to trade away my extra for other peoples extra.""

my response:
Some cash money somewhere is helpful, to cover things like property taxes, vehicle repair, vehicle insurance, vehicle taxes, gas, home insurance, health insurance, medications for yourself and animals, etc. I know some people will barter the things they produce, but they still have cash coming in somewhere, even if it's just gig work or odd jobs here and there. Maybe someone else can chime in with a different experience, but I don't personally know anyone who has managed to survive for any real length of time on bartering alone, because there's only so much interest in what you have, or other people only have so much to barter with.

I have a friend who is getting rid of the rabbits he raised for meat, b/c he couldn't find anyone actually interested in them, and he discovered that he was only interested in eating so much rabbit meat. He's kind of sick of it now, so he's selling them and trying pigs (note that he didn't do any research before getting the rabbits... nor the pigs). You'll definitely want to get to know the community, and what the community needs/would like, be it bartering or setting up an actual business. The more members to the community, the more people you can potentially barter with, but the flip side is the more people who are potentially your competition (who have the same thing as you do to barter with). Hope that makes some sense.

1629,"No one really knows, to be honest. People are organizing, but I'm not certain how effective it will be. You have this issue where the police are not run by the feds, they're run on the local level, but then they have that giant police union that protects them. The real issue is that this has been going on for a long time, they have built this giant system for a long time, and it's probably going to take a long time to dismantle it. The usual answer is to apply political pressure at the local level to change things so that there's genuine oversight and investigations into these incidences. There's already citizen review boards in various places though and they're already ignored by the cops, by the system that put them in place. They need independent/outsider oversight that has actual power to punish. This doesn't really exist right now, closest thing is the feds, but they can't watch over every department that has questionable practices - there's just too many of them.

The bright side of this is that now so many people have smart phones and can film what is going on. There are some theories running around that it's always been this bad... we're just now getting video footage of it all. At this point, all of these different locations with police killing people need the local public who put the mayor/council in office to contact the mayor and local council members to demand that something be done. At least put *someone's* ass on the line.

1635,"Another resident of WNC here, agreeing with the others. This place is wet, unless you're up at some of the very highest elevations. There's basically two kinds of soil here, heavily eroded clay filled with rocks that is considered unsuitable for agriculture, and the fertile flood plains that are good agricultural land and will therefore be priced accordingly. Before you purchase any piece of land look up the soil survey to find out what you're looking at. Land prices vary tremendously, depending on how close you are to a resort town or somebody's mega mountain mansion or trailer park.

You might see if you can find a local credit union, they might help provide you with decent loans.

Earthships are a terrible idea here as others have covered, however a lot of their design is based on passive solar principles, which you can definitely use in whatever you end up constructing.

Local food is pretty hot, especially in the Asheville area there's tons of restaurants that do the locally-supplied thing. The problem is that land in the area is pricey and there's already lots of competition. If you're going to go with a purely rural market, one thing you'll discover is that quite a few Appalachians already have their own homesteads and already provide a bit of their own food, so you're going to have to be able produce things that they can't already. Oh and the fact that this area is traditionally very poor, so think very carefully about where you locate and who you want your market to be and how you're going to market yourselves.

People will sell you native plants and green energy but no one's handing them out for free. 

One of the easier routes is to find a good piece of land that already has something ugly on it, something like an old mobile home, where it already has well, septic, and power. You can live in the mobile home while figuring out where to put your new small, energy efficient home, and either get rid of the mobile home or convert it to guest worker housing or an office or something. Unlike stick-built homes, mobile homes do not appreciate in value over time, so this helps comes property tax time. Getting property this way also saves you the hassle and cost of putting in all of that infrastructure.

In case you need or want high speed internet access to run your business or telecommute or whatever, you'll want to take that into account when looking into land. If you go rural enough, it's unavailable. The mountains can make cell phone reception nonexistent as well. Take your time finding the right piece of land.  

My best advice is to really think this through, economically. Look at your savings, look at your income, consider what kind of money you need to be happy with life, and how much of a cushion do you have if one or both of you unexpectedly lose jobs before or early on through this process? I know people who would move the hell out of here if they could, but they're too broke. There's a lot of ways your plan can go wrong, and this place can be unforgiving.

Overall, it's very difficult, which is why most people in this day and age don't do it, although money makes everything easier.

The best way to answer this is to start picking up skills that you'll need and see if you actually enjoy (or at least don't mind) doing them. Then ask yourself do you really want to fill your days doing this? Personally I find some tasks unbearably boring, so I listen to music and audiobooks I download from the internet, but that doesn't sound like that's an option in your scenario. But maybe you don't need those things, and are happy without them.

Laboratory and animal studies have shown that cannabinoids may be able to kill cancer cells while protecting normal cells.

* A study in mice showed that cannabinoids may protect against inflammation of the colon and may have potential in reducing the risk of colon cancer, and possibly in its treatment.

The same study of delta-9-THC in mouse models of liver cancer showed that it had antitumor effects. Delta-9-THC has been shown to cause these effects by acting on molecules that may also be found in non-small cell lung cancer cells and breast cancer cells.

* A laboratory study of cannabidiol (CBD) in estrogen receptor positive and estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cells showed that it caused cancer cell death while having little effect on normal breast cells. Studies in mouse models of metastatic breast cancer showed that cannabinoids may lessen the growth, number, and spread of tumors.

* A laboratory study of cannabidiol (CBD) in human glioma cells showed that when given along with chemotherapy, CBD may make chemotherapy more effective and increase cancer cell death without harming normal cells.

1714,"""Mostly because these subreddits have made me feel like we know what's coming.""

Well, see, that's the thing. Feelings are liars. And thoughts are tricky too, b/c you can easily end up in the trap of confirmation bias (or as reddit more crudely refers to it, 'circle jerks' where everyone agrees with each other, and weirdly in that sort of echo chamber, tend to come up with ever more extreme positions).

These subreddits are challenging to mental health, b/c they don't tend to offer people any optimism whatsoever and **hope is damn important** in life. They also don't tend to offer people with substantive steps that they can use to make a difference. Part of that is the medium, b/c all this place really does is pepper you with negative, apocalyptic stuff without much social or emotional support to work through it. A very dark future is presented here. 

Personally, I just stop by from time to time, I'm not even subscribed, b/c it's just relentless, and after a certain point, you're not really being informed, you're just being badgered, you know? You don't have to feel guilty about your consumption, it's better to think through it with a calm, clear mind if at all possible. To a certain extent, you're in control of how much you consume, but to also participate in the modern world as we know it, it does require consuming. We all do it, it's okay (not great, but okay), it's part of being a member of our civilization currently. Life is short and full of stress, and if audio recording and gaming are what bring you happiness in life, then I recommend sticking with those. You can look to see if your power company offers those green energy programs, where you pay a little bit more, but it goes to help purchase green energy for the grid. If reading all of this material is bringing out thought-behaviors that aren't helping you to lead your life better, then I really would walk away for a bit. The thing about fear and obsessing is that they *feel* like you're accomplishing things, and you spend a lot of mental energy that way, but it's actually not the most efficient way to *achieving* your goals, whatever they might be. It's the mind playing tricks on you.

You might check out /r/gardening in case you aren't there already, friendly and support folks. /r/meditation has a [fantastic wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/wiki/faq) full of sources to help get your mind a bit more on track. And if you think you might have an issue with obsessing, I recommend talking with a good trained professional. Let's say things do start to go really crazy on the earth, then the best way to prepare is by having a healthy mind, to be able to think clearly under stress, to have a healthy body, to be physically active and moving, to be strong and flexible in body and thought. If you can move yourself away from obsessing and more towards truly adapting, I think you'll find a good middle ground. Whatever habits your mind may have have adopted, you can retrain it. It's not fast, it's not fun, but it can help you lead a more rewarding life.",2015-08-07 17:36:25+00:00,ctv0cn9,7.0,t1_ctuphyi,18377.0,climate
1715,"What's your physical activity like? Prior to running across global climate change, did you tend to obsess over things, or is this a new thought-behavior?

Sometimes it can be helpful to examine how you're framing things in your mind. We're all going to die anyway at some unknown time in an unknown way. There's a lot of things in life we can't control. But there are some things we can control, like our behaviors, our actions, and we can channel our thoughts towards more effective behaviors and actions.

I think part of what makes this a difficult topic for our brain is that there isn't a thing you can do and then achieve a sense of accomplishment. For the individual, it's usually looked at in terms of sacrifice, of what you can give up, and for most people they don't feel that solid sense of accomplishment. So say you stopped eating all beef. Assuming you ate beef prior, this is actually a significant way to cut down on your personal carbon emissions. But not eating beef may not give you that sense of ""YEAH THAT WAS AWESOME I'M AWESOME"" sense of reward we've come to associate with accomplishment. Until someone can create a CO2 app or something that gives us anime gold stars for reducing emissions I think it will continue to feel... empty.

If it's the only thing you think about, I'd actually step away from this subreddit and any other related subreddits or media you might consume that relates to this for a bit, until your mind has gotten over the shock a bit. What you describe isn't uncommon, but these kinds of revelations can be very difficult to work through. So go ahead and give yourself some space from the screaming hysterical media and work through the fact that maybe some of your expectations for your future may be different than what you expected, but it doesn't mean that you have no future, nor are you damned to a hellacious future. No one actually knows what the future holds.

I always recommend anyone who can to garden, be it containers on a deck or a community garden, b/c it builds skills (growing food is awesome and you never know when you might need to), it gets you in contact with the earth, it can get you in the sun, it can help you become physically stronger, and it can be therapeutic.

It's horribly cynical and destructive, b/c there really are programs that are bloated, we have multiple agencies that are basically doing the same thing and don't even know about each other, we have crap that the government purchases that is manufactured in all these states, so even if the government doesn't need said crap everyone loves the jobs and money it brings in... yeah that's wasteful pork and actually needs to go. But as long as one major party is all ""the government is bad big brother HAR HAR"" you don't get meaningful change or reform.

If that doesn't work, go hit the gym to burn off that frantic sort of feeling.

* what brought you there? 
* are you looking for an excuse to drop out of college anyway? 
* are you homesick/lonely at college?

Bullshit. It's a new strain spread by wild birds. The USDA has tons of info on this.

""USDA AVIAN INFLUENZA FACT SHEET
Updated: April 2015
There are two types of avian influenza (AI) that are identified as H5N1. A difference exists in the virus classification; one is low
pathogenic (LPAI) and the other is highly pathogenic (HPAI). Pathogenicity refers to the ability of the virus to produce disease. HPAI H5N1, often referred to as the “Asian” H5N1, is the type causing worldwide concern.  LPAI H5N1, often referred to as the “North American” H5N1, is of less concern. 

Recently, on January 16, 2015, USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed a finding of a novel avian influenza virus in a wild green winged teal (a wild duck) in Washington State (new H5N1).  This particular strain had not been identified in an animal or human host before.""

I would NOT get family or friends involved. That sounds particularly messy, especially since they may be part of the content you're working through. You want space from other people that you know on a personal level to work through your mind.

1801,"Ok, the fact that you are living with them is *very* important social context. Who is paying for the food in the household? Who prepares the food in the household? Can you purchase your own vegan products and prepare them? Do you have any cooking experience? They shouldn't be making you anything, they're omni, they'll fuck it up even if they don't mean to, b/c as someone that is choosing to eat a special diet, it's your responsibility to make certain that your food conforms to your special diet. This isn't on them, it's on you. To be a healthy vegan means eating a lot of food you've prepared from scratch, it's a time commitment, both to gaining the skills to do so, and to the actual cooking. 

There's nothing like finally living in line with your deeply-held values, but it's one thing to do that when you're living solo, it's another when you're in a household with omnis.

I recommend learning to cook, picking up some veg*n cooking skills. Maybe you can mention that you want to try meatless mondays or something, and let them know ahead of time that you're going without meat. You can let them know that even normal omnis do meatless mondays, and on those days, you can refrain or better yet, cook something yourself for yourself with a little extra to share. Get them used to this first before going any further. This does several things, it allows you to share new foods with them, it gives you the space to eat differently from them, and it gives you a chance to learn new things.

I don't know your background, but it sounds like you come from a place where you haven't been supported generally. This means that you probably have some internal work to do in terms of self-respect, self-love, and setting boundaries. One of the best ways to handle these things is by building concrete skills (like cooking! fermenting! etc.), so you can build the self-confidence that I suspect has been undermined for years. We can't fight your battles for you but we're *always* here if you need support.

1831,"Hey I'm sorry to hear about all of this. Would renting a chipper for the tree to turn it into mulch for the garden work at all? This subreddit + /r/diy + youtube + contractor's forums might have some suggestions for fixing some of the various house issues, like maybe the plumbing (especially if you take lots of photos showing the problems, and host them on imgur for redditors to see and provide input). Even if you don't want to live in the house for much longer, it might help it sell and/or help make it more pleasant for the remaining time y'all are there. For our large projects that can get overwhelming, we break them down into smaller doable chunks (for our homestead, we bought an extreme fixer upper, so we've definitely had to do a lot of plumbing work, among other things). Just some ideas, it sounds like a pretty stressful situation.

Also, if you get those blueberry bushes going well, you can always [try to take cuttings](http://www.extension.org/pages/29211/blueberry-propagation#.VaiDx0UagUQ) of them before you move.

* What's your budget

* What's the site like, is it sloped, is it flat, how deep to bedrock, are there any sort of geological or hydrological considerations to take into account with the design (water pooling during rainstorms, etc.)

* What sq footage do you want

* What features do you want, electrical, running water, etc.

* How do you plan to heat it, passive solar, active solar, gas, electrical/on-grid

* How much of this can you do yourself or are you looking to hire someone to do all of the above, and consider that in your budget. Skilled labor is expensive. Designing and building this takes lots of skill.

Lastly, Victorian-style conservatories are beautiful but they are anything but energy-efficient. Something to consider when you're talking about heating a structure with shitty R values.

That building is at a bare minimum, $250,000 structure, probably more in the $400,000 ballpark. That's some high-end shit right there, there's a reason that level of structure is seen only at botanical gardens or the uber wealthy. Maybe you're uber wealthy? IDK.

I actually make baked seitan b/c it's so much easier. 


**Baked Seitan:**

Two Bowls, one dry, one wet. Preheat oven to 375F.

*Dry bowl:*

* 2 Cups vital wheat gluten

* 6 Tbsp preferred powder spices (any combo of garlic, onion, thyme, red pepper flakes, rosemary, sage, cumin, cinnamon, whatever. My preferred default is mostly garlic+onion but I'm a garlic fiend)

*Wet bowl:*

* 2 Tbsp light soy sauce

* 2 Tbsp oil (EVOO, Canola, etc.)

* 1 3/4 Cups water


Mix bowls separately, then pour wet into dry. Mix together. The more you mix, the stickier it will get, and the tougher it will be in the end. Humidity and temperature also play a role, so experiment to see what works best. What I do is mix is partially. Then I lightly oil up a cookie sheet with my fingers, then take oily fingers to mix up the rest seitan by hand. Tug and pull it into the shape that you want. The smaller, the quicker they'll cook. I put them on the tray and smush down on them to help them stretch out a bit.

Bake 17 minutes. Flip, bake another 10-15 minutes depending on their size. They can be eaten fresh, last in the fridge for a week or so, last in the freezer for months. 

Cleanup: use COLD water, hot water will cause the gluten to turn into rubber! 

Nutrition: just doing the vital wheat gluten, this will make you a batch of patties containing a total of **354 grams of protein**.

Hope this helps! Feel free to alter and share! It's cheaper than any source of protein I've found anywhere, hands down, vegan or not.

Look at all harvest festivals, like Thanksgiving, they're a big deal b/c that's when even the peasants would celebrate the harvest coming in by slaughtering an entire animal an eating it - that was an unimaginable luxury. 

Meat has a cycle too, just like plants. We've become unhinged from it now. Just as you can find food in supermarkets from around teh world, ""fresh"" tomatoes, you can also find meat there year round, due to the way we have set up our industrial food system.

Back in the day, people just had chickens and these same chickens would be used for eggs AND for meat (nowadays, different breeds are used for each). That's why it was a big deal to slaughter one of your animals, b/c you were giving up the eggs or milk (in the case of goats or cows) they would otherwise produce for you semi-consistently instead of a one time giant feast.

The drawback being, that it's not worth it, or in some cases legal, to seed save.

As I mentioned before, GMOs are based off of hybrids. GMOs cost way more money to develop than a hybrid; plant development isn't free that's why there's plant scientists working on making these things in the first place. So farmers are free to buy older seeds, that is those that breed true, those that you can seed save, they're commonly called ""heirloom"". Farmers can still use those, they just won't get all the benefits of hybrid vigor, or the last oh, 100 years of seed development and technology.
