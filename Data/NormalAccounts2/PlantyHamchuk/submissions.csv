""Show Your Support for Democracy on Main Street Weaverville - There have been reports of voter intimidation and intimidation of Democratic volunteers on Main Street in Weaverville. These reports include stories of voters who left without voting. There was also a request from one of our volunteers that suggested we shut down our GOTV efforts for a time due to harassment. Some of us feel that we should not retreat when faced with this type of behavior. Our right to peacefully express our political views is basic. 

Myself and others will be on Main Street this afternoon, tomorrow and Saturday simply to show our support for all voters and volunteers. Please join us as your schedule permits...

Most of the incidents mentioned above have been reported to our party leadership and to the Voter Protection Hotline at 919-432-4419.""
