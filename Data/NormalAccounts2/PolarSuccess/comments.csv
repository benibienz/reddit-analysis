0,"Why ""cucks""? I accept you're insulting them, and it's a shitty picture, but why that insult? It's meaning is so specific to one problem, and this has nothing to do with that. I'm not attacking you, I'm sincerely curious why that specific insult has become so commonly used.",2016-09-13 11:25:11+00:00,d7ku4ue,2,t1_d7krt8z,7970,Art
1,"I used my boost on a warlock, super eager to check out the new Demonology spec, and was thoroughly disapointed. It looks good on paper, running around with a bunch of demons and sending a horde of them at baddies, but it falls flat at execution. The demons don't last all that long, so you need to keep summoning them a lot. That would be fine on its own, if it weren't for the fact that every time you summon a new demon, you have to also cast ""Empower Demons"". This is a short cast time spell that you will cast constantly, and it feels really unsatisfying to summon a demon, give it a pat on the back, summon a demon, give it a pat on the back, repeat.",2016-09-12 12:46:36+00:00,d7jgwq1,2,t1_d7jgozx,448,wow
2,"Did your group move beyond The Wheel at all? I'm about to run this module for my players and I would love to know how your GM brought that location to life well enough for you to specifically praise it. Can you recall any details of what he did, which characters were present and how he presented them, how did the action go down, that sort of thing? I love player accounts of sessions.

Also, OP, I think Jewel of Yavin is the coolest that I've checked out. It's a Cloud City Jewel Heist, really neat. But it isn't recommended for starting groups. ",2016-08-31 11:50:24+00:00,d73v2sw,2,t1_d73tqz3,3598,swrpg
3,"I don't know anyone who's up for GMing, no. I'm actually looking to join a group for regular play, so I've been looking around and haven't found anything yet. 

I'll absolutely have a character prepared, but I assume if we can't find a GM we won't be playing, right?",2016-08-25 20:05:29+00:00,d6wjp3h,3,t1_d6wi5ip,1931,lfg

6,"Did you find that your characters enjoyed Mask of the Pirate Queen? It's looking combat heavy, and my group is /not/ very good in a fight. I'm worried they'll get themselves killed, seriously.",2016-08-18 00:51:11+00:00,d6lzay8,2,t1_d6lt0nd,9182,swrpg
7,"Thanks so much for the feedback! I think I might just do this, incorporating the Hutt as a long term character. I might swap it for Teemo, who they escaped from in the beginner box, though.

8,"This is something I've been wondering, too! In the Campaign Podcast, they reference them as tiny golden bars. They appeared that way in one of the movies. Is there no equivalent of a debit card? Or maybe they work like pre-loaded gift cards? So there can be denominations of credit-chip cards, that can then be individually depleted? ",2016-08-16 19:44:55+00:00,d6k4vrj,1,t3_4y17ye,2493,swrpg
9,"They have a Smuggler with the Scoundrel specialization. He's the group pilot, and enjoys it, but I wouldn't say he's defined by that as a character the same way that an Ace or something would be. ",2016-08-01 19:50:44+00:00,d6011o8,2,t1_d600l7p,552,swrpg
10,"I've got a three part plan here, ha!
1) the ship is terrible, I'm going to really play up that it is just awful. It's rusted, it stinks, it handles horribly, it's ugly, etc
2)The NPC contact will expect it as a trade for the other ship, at least for scrap value
3)I'll just destroy it somehow",2016-08-01 16:55:13+00:00,d5zslh5,2,t1_d5zqloy,2596,swrpg
11,"This is fantastic input, thank you! 

Can you speak more about giving the group incentive to upgrade ships? I had that thought, too, but I figure the ship is likely to be a central character, I feel like the PC's would be reluctant to part with it. Might as well start them off with a strong option. Does anyone have experience with their groups upgrading ships?",2016-08-01 15:32:39+00:00,d5zoua2,2,t1_d5zntvv,1431,swrpg
