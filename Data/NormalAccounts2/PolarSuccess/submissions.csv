What can I offer them in this? Obviously, one option is for Reom to say he couldn't get his hands on one, but I feel that would be unsatisfying.

My plan is to run them through;


1. Trouble Brewing (Back of the core rulebook, replacing Formos with Ord Mantell)


2. Beyone the Rim


3. Mask of the Pirate Queen


4. Jewel of Yavin



I'd like to crowdsource some ideas on how to make these stories more than unrelated adventures. Have you run one or more of these before? How did you go about getting them from one to the next? Can any NPC's from one adventure carry over into the others? I'm considering, for instance, that Bandin Dobah from Trouble Brewing might be a former member of the Veiled Sorority from Mask of the Pirate Queen, thus providing a link between the two stories. 


If it helps, these are the PC's;


1. A human smuggler, former Imperial TIE pilot. He defected during the chaos of the first Death Star's destruction.


2. A human doctor, from the core worlds. Down deep he's goodhearted, but has a twisted, obsessive side.


3. A rodian slicer, originally from Coruscant. He has a contact on Ord Mantell, a fellow slicer, who owes him a favor. This is how I'm hooking the PC's up with their first ship.


4. A Chiss Big Game Hunter. She's lost contact with her old partner, a Duros hunter. I'm considering having the partner currently stranded on Cholganna, and the player group will run into him during Beyond the Rim.


There is also a ""big bad"", in the form of Captain Allen, a human female Star Destroyer captain who has taken a vague, personal interest in the party. I'd like Allen to make occasional appearances, perhaps not in person. After the adventures are finished, I will write a custom adventure of the PC's dealing with her. 

Any help would be immensely appreciated! I hope other GM's could make use of this thread to tie the pre-written modules together.",swrpg,"Tying Trouble Brewing, Beyond the Rim, Mask of the Pirate Queen, and Jewel of Yavin together",https://www.reddit.com/r/swrpg/comments/4y0ytr/tying_trouble_brewing_beyond_the_rim_mask_of_the/

I've begun writing up my first mini-adventure for the following session, and would love some feedback and help!

The purpose of this mini-adventure is for the crew to get their hands on a ship. I don't want them keeping the Krayt Fang. So, our Rodian Slicer hits up a recluse slicer contract of his, who owes the PC a favor and is currently holed up on Ord Mantell, doing work for the local smuggling and pirate crews. In exchange for this work, the NPC is occasionally paid in beat up, direlict ship hulks. He'll part with one of these to the player party, after a series of little side quests to 1) get the required parts around Ord Mantell 2) clear out the creature currently using the ship as a den 3) set it up with a new transponder code, name, etc.

I want there to be three or more direlicts for the group to choose from. My current shortlist includes a YT-2400, a VCX-100, a HT-2200, and a HWK-1000. I have a few questions!

1) Are these good ship selections? Are they /too/ good? I know that the HWK-1000 is an impressively statted ship, I'm thinking of the NPC slicer contact being very reluctant to part with that one, as he considers it a collectors item. 
2) I'm missing the stats for the VCX-100. I've purchased the books I need most, but not the book with that ship. Would anyone mind providing me with its stats, and if you're feeling extra generous, the books' write up of it?
3) I would love any ideas you might have of things that could be wrong with the ships, encounters based around fixing one up, or any other suggestions! ",swrpg,Acquiring a ship.,https://www.reddit.com/r/swrpg/comments/4vmp21/acquiring_a_ship/
