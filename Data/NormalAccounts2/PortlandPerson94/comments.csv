Well, despite the other response, I don't think any word is definitionally tied to a number in the same way it's tied to a particular animal. If we had one word for it (Like they apparently do in Turkish), then all you have to grow up knowing (I'm assuming anyway) is the approximate sizes for different groups.

The other driver's insurance company reminded me that I have the right to go to that shop anyway but because they weren't on the list of approved shops, I would not have the insurance company behind me if something went wrong and boy did something go wrong. I dropped my car off and was promised a call later with an estimated time. Thank god the other driver's insurance was paying for it so I was able to get a rental car and everything. I would get a couple calls a week explaining new delays, ever increasing costs, and apologies. I wasn't stuck with the bill but I was stuck with not having my car for nearly 6 months because of the delays. It got so ridiculous that the rental car company started harassing me. I told them it was out of my control and I almost got a heaping bill from them as well. When I got the car back, I found several issues with the paint job that no one wanted to take responsibility for and the adjuster just played dumb and said that he didn't see it. I was there with the adjuster and pointed to the problem areas. He simply toggled his glasses around and still acted as if it was flawless. Moreover, I asked the shop for a timeline of what the car was doing for 6 months that I was promised and never got even though I stopped by an extra few times after picking up my car. Instead, I was given a warranty paper that isn't worth the paper it's printed on. When I called them to act on the warranty, I got no response.  It's a mechanically sound repair, I will give them that much, but that, and the free coffee in their lobby are the ONLY good things I can say about my experience with that shop.

1) He's not Hilary (in that he isn't a corrupt political/criminal.)  

2) The people in his inner circle that he has managed to not alienate are positioned to be extremely influential in the roles that they are in line for when Trump delegates and for better or for worse, would probably do more than a Clinton administration could manage.  

3) As far as economic issues are concerned,  a candidate with a business background is hugely more attractive than one with a political background.  

4) For all the outlandish, bigoted, wrong, or 'not PC' things he has said, at least sooome of the time, you can say that a lot of people were thinking it and he is only getting the heat for being the one to say it into a microphone. Not a defense of what he says, not a justification, just an observation.  

5) Both candidates have been on the record on both sides of many issues over the years. You can look up the compilation videos on YouTube if you don't know what I'm talking about.

173,"Are you talking about the book or my paraphrasing it? Here is the real text verbatim.  

""No. Jews are definitely not a race, because human races do not exist. In terms of biology, there is only one race: the human race. The idea that Jews comprised a separate race was instrumental to the occurrence of the Holocaust. The notion was based on a theory that Jews the world over had a number of racial characteristics in common; features that had been determined biologically or genetically and were therefor unvarying. This theory is unsound. Racial doctrine and race classification appeared in the eighteenth century on the heels of the classifications that were created for plants and animals by the Swedish biologist Linnaeus (1707-1778). Based on external characteristics such as hair color, hair structure, or the shape of a person's nose, all sorts of characterizations were making their rounds then - one even more far-reaching than the next. Racial classification always divided people into four basic categories: ""the White race"", the Black race"", ""the Yellow race"", and ""the Red race"". To distinguish the races from each other, all different human characteristics were ascribed to people. In addition, a concept of inequality was instituted right from the start: influential European scientists were interested in proving the superiority of their own race - the white race. In Europe, particularly in the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century,  race classification was very popular. Almost everybody - rich or poor, conservative or socialist, Christian or Jew - refereed to groups of people as races.  This word race was also frequently used without any reference of bias, meaning nothing more than sort of blood relationship. Pseudo-scientists attached a huge amount of significance to race classification. Scores of personality traits were connected to different races, which resulted in a variety of bizarre and dangerous ideas. Many people considered Jews a 'pure race', given that they had managed to survive for centuries as a separate group, a ""nation apart"". Race classification became very controversial because of the way in which the Nazis used it in the 1930s and 1940s to distinguish the Aryan race from the Semitic race. Following WWII, scientists conclusively established the irrelevance of race classifications. There is no such thing as a Jew-gene; you cannot identify 'real Jews' by examining their genes "" -Fifty Questions on Antisemetism by Jaap Tanja and the Anne Frank House ",2016-08-16 22:50:17+00:00,d6kd8fl,3.0,t1_d6k2tb0,13665.0,NoStupidQuestions

353," *I think* single issue voters should still have their voices heard. Yes that introduces challenges, and point taken, the test shouldn't alienate anyone or be too rigorous. Would it not be appropriate to draw an analogy to a driving test and calling voting a responsibility as well as a right? Not the impossibly tricky written test but actually driving. I've never written a test before. I'm not going to pretend like I have a grand vision for this. But, like mentioned before in response to earlier comments, I imagine the test drafters would have their work cut out for them.
As to your point on the constitutionality, I would want to see that actually play out in court. Voting rights in a democracy are recognized almost globally as one of the fundamental humans rights but there still are *reasonable* restrictions that disbar non-citizens, convicts, etc. from voting. Those factors are much more black and white than the bar-setting challenge of figuring out who is too ""stupid"" to make an informed decision but let’s not give anyone with agendas the benefit of the doubt. Let's question every standard. I don't think that will be a dead end. I think that'll bring us closer to getting people involved in the democratic process.
