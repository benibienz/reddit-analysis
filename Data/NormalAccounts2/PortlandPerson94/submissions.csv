I was honestly set back because I thought that I was really courteous with this person but apparently not courteous enough. It was pointed out to me toward the beginning of an interaction in the day that went on for another 30 minutes or so and a lot of that was sheer silence because my behavior immediately transitioned from normal to walking on egg shells. This post came after that because I've been looking for some ideas for how to continue interacting with this person. It's just an inevitability. 

Edit 2: I've become really self conscious about how courteous I am and have started inserting please and thank you in as often as possible. So, appropriately, a thank you is in order for all the commenters.

I, being a college student, took this message in wholeheartedly. But not just from taking John's word for it. Let me tell you a story.  

I started my college career at a community college right out of high school. I stayed at home, commuted to class daily, saw a lot of familiar faces from high school, made some friends, and did some soul searching via taking classes from several departments to hone in on a major I'd be happy with. Well last year, one of those familiar faces runs into me, we catch up, and he tells me that he is doing some sort of work/mentor/understudy program that he had a really hard time describing for me. I was intrigued but brushed it off and the conversation organically moved on. In a follow up, he invites me to meet his mentor and I did. I got the hunch that there was a catch but upon first impressions, he said nothing disagreeable. Then began a long cat and mouse game of what I eventually realized was an attempt to recruit me into what some people would call a pyramid scheme. (My mother was some people. Mother is always right. I'm glad I listened to mother.) 

Anyway, the friend's mentor called himself just that and suggested that it was the key to success. I didn't disagree but I also didn't feel like taking the bait. (It's at this point I wanna pause and iterate that I'm not going to hate on the friend or his mentor or the company. Every person I met in that organization was genuine and good. I just didn't feel like it was for me.)  Well fast forward a couple months and [Tai Lopez](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2v93u7/who_is_this_guy_that_just_bought_a_new/) started making his rounds in front of YouTube videos and, I gotta admit, I took the bait once or twice and heard him out through to the end of the ad. It sounded kind of like the same, inflated, too-good-to-be-true story telling and I was waiting for the pitch. Well, if you listen to Tai's speeches (in particular, I just watched his TedTalk), he also brings up that a mentor is key to success. 

Now, I'm not one to believe in coincidences like that. Maybe mentors are a common denominator for successful people, maybe telling people to go get mentors is the key. I don't know yet, I'm not successful by most metrics. But there is a pattern cropping up here. And here is the kicker. Here is the great thing.  

The great thing is that John and Hank built a community. They do what they do because they want to be doing it. Nerdfighteria isn't a sales pitch. Crash Course is practically a high school education for free. I didn't recognize it at the time but the Green brothers are some wonderful people with a lot to offer the world.

For the last two weeks, not one of my matches has saved. I'm talking about getting the notification, opting to message later instead of message now so I can take a second look at the profile, and then the match disapears entirely into thin air. (Which is just beautifully madening considering a friend changed some things about my profile and I finally started getting a good amount of matches.) So like any normal person, I logged out and back in, I force restarted the app, I restarted my phone, I even deleted some old matches that went nowhere, all the meanwhile, checking new matches between the steps with no success. So okay, I have already lost a lot of matches, what have I got to lose? I try something different, hit message now THEN go into the profile and hit the back button. That works!

Problem is that after all of the major changes, I went with one more at the 11th hour and have been wierdly selective about who I tell about the new one but default to the previous one and just feel guilty about the lie. Its almost completely unwaranted but I got the idea from a friend of mine who changed so many times that they felt unaccomplished every time the switch was brought up. That's at least the impression I got. Anyway, what to do? How do I break out from this hole I've dug for myself?
