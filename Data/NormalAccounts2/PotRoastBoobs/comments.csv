0,"&gt;“It was,” Fisher said. “When you’re at home and you’re up by 10, and you got a chance to go up by 13, and you’re playing defense the way you’re playing it, you should just go ahead and just finish the game; capture the game, capture the win. Yeah, it was disappointing ––in particular the two defensive drives considering the way the defense played throughout the game. Miami had won four straight going into this thing, and Ryan [Tannehill] had been playing well. They had multiple 200[-yard] rush games with Jay [Ajayi]. With the exception of the one long run he had, which we overcame, this is a game we should have won.”

&gt;Fisher said he’s giving no consideration to changing play callers after another sluggish offensive performance, and he had praise for rookie quarterback Jared Goff in his first career start.

&gt;“I was impressed with what he did,” Fisher said. “I thought he managed things well — no delay of games, he was in complete control, he was composed, and he got us in and out of a lot of really good things. We didn’t take our shots down the field, that in retrospect we probably needed to do. But he knew where to go with the football and I was proud of his first outing. We get a stop or intercept a pass — one of the two or three that we had our hands on — we win the game and we’re talking about Jared right now and nothing else.”

2,"Some good stuff from the article:

- Miscues have been the constant cloud following Mudiay during much of his first two seasons in the NBA. He’s hoping the last three games signal a permanent change for the better. Mudiay’s committed just five turnovers in the last three Nuggets contests, and doubled down on the good feelings by dishing out 23 assists in the same span. It’s been a huge departure from what happened in the first 10 games of the season, where Mudiay committed 46 (4.6 per) and didn’t balance that out with high assist totals, only dishing out 32 in that time.

- “I’m not trying to make the home run play, I’m just trying to make the easy, simple play,” he said. “We said we wanted to play fast; I think early on I was playing too fast, even for myself. I figured out if I don’t have anybody in transition just bring it back out or if I see something I can take it myself.”

- Told that Nuggets coach Michael Malone praised his recent ability to take care of the ball, Mudiay smiled. “That’s a good thing for coach. I’m happy he’s happy,” Mudiay said. “It’s always good seeing your coach happy and proud. But now it’s trying to do it the next game.”

- “He has to continue that,” Malone said. “Slow down, take what the defense gives you. Don’t leave your feet. That’s not just him, that’s everybody. The defense will always tell you what to do. Sometimes when people try to predetermine, premeditate…you can’t do that. The defense will tell what to do, they’ll tell you what the right play is out there.”

- Mudiay has removed the high degree of difficulty from his passing game, and Malone’s not so sure it needs to ever return. “I don’t know if we need fancy stuff,” Malone said. “Does fancy stuff win you games? I’m a simple-minded guy: do the things that you need to do. How do you win in the NBA? You don’t beat yourself. That starts with your point guard. Move the ball. We have a saying: Early pass, easy pass. If the early pass is there, just make it.”

- As a team, there is indisputable value to sharing the ball. The Nuggets are 2-1 this season when they’ve racked up 30 or more dimes. Sharing is caring. And, Malone said, it’s also part of the glue that keeps a team bonded. “I think nothing divides a team more than selfish basketball,” Malone said. “When you’re playing together, teams come together. They feel a part of it. They dig in that much deeper on defense. (Sunday) night was good example of that.”",2016-11-22 02:06:42+00:00,daaeqxm,1.0,t3_5e84sb,176,denvernuggets

- Cornerback Aqib Talib, who missed the last three games with a back injury, also returned to practice to full and appears to be on track to start Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs. “I’m feeling great, like even better,” Talib said. “I got a three-week break, so my legs feel legs feel extra fresh. I just feel super fresh right now.”

- But center Matt Paradis again did not practice. Paradis has played every offensive snap since the start of last season, but has been dealing with hip soreness. Kubiak said his absence will be a regular sight for the rest of the season to try to preserve his health.

- ""I am back!"" roared Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib on Monday at his locker. After a three-game absence due to a lower back injury, the Broncos star returned with vengeance and passion. He believes his absence has left him in position to make a strong push, not unlike DeMarcus Ware last season. Talib stayed in Colorado during the bye week to ramp up his conditioning. He has delivered his best season as a Bronco, putting himself squarely in the argument for All-Pro honors. Talib owns three interceptions, and returned one for a touchdown to seal the Broncos' win over Indianapolis on Sept. 18.

- ""I feel great, like I am going to finish great. My legs feel extra fresh,"" Talib said. ""I have been watching Kansas City for two weeks. They know what we're going to do and we know what they are going to do so it will be a good fight.""

- Defensive end Derek Wolfe joined Talib at practice. He suffered a hairline fracture in his right elbow against the Oakland Raiders. He told Denver7 he hoped to return against the Chiefs. His goal remains realistic.

- ""It felt good,"" said Wolfe, who will wear a brace for the remainder of the year. ""I was able to move around pretty good."" Wolfe limited interviews Monday because he was under the weather.

- “You can see that they’re really fresh mentally more than anything—just getting away from football for a little bit,” Broncos’ head coach Gary Kubiak said. “There was a lot of enthusiasm out here today, guys bouncing around.”

- Before the break, Denver’s injury report featured an eye-popping 15 players. Only two sat out of practice Monday—center Matt Paradis with a scheduled rest day, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, whose wife is expecting a baby in the very near future.

- “Any time you play 10 weeks in a row in this business you’re going to be beat up, you’re going to have things going on with your team,” Kubiak said. “It’s kind of a chance to regroup your football team. We’re at full strength in practice today for the first time in probably 10 weeks, other than Matt not being out here. That’s a good thing, and you can just tell. We’re competitive. We weren’t trying to rest 10 guys and get through a Wednesday or a Thursday practice, we were back at it in a competitive situation. Hopefully, we can stay healthy and stay that way the last six weeks.”

- “I look at it [the schedule] and I think we can do better,” Kubiak said. “We could have had a few balls bounce against us and we could have been worse. We’re right there in our division with Oakland playing tonight. There are a lot of good teams in our division and a lot of wins in our division. You look around this league and it’s going to be so competitive these last six weeks. A lot of football are in races and we all play each other.

We need to improve up front at that spot. We need more consistency at that spot. We’ll see what happens.

&gt;“I believe that’s a discussion that needs to be had,” Tomlin said. “But more than the discussions, I think that it needs to move in that direction and move relatively quickly. But there are politics and so forth involved in that, labor and so forth involved in that. I get it, but it’d be nice if that process gets going.”

20,"Some good stuff from the article:

- “We’re right there,’’ cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. “Nobody has won anything yet -- that comes later. So everything we want to get done is still there.’’

- It is indeed, and to win their sixth consecutive division title and get themselves into the postseason, including possibly gaining home-field advantage, the Broncos must do five things:

- **Block better** The Broncos had plenty of issues in the offensive line in 2015. The players bristled at the criticism last season (even though it often was spot-on), and in the end they mustered their best football down the stretch and had their best game in Super Bowl 50. Despite spending additional free-agency money and draft capital on the position, they have had many of the same problems this year. For whatever reason, the system taught for decades with great success by coach Gary Kubiak and his staff isn’t sinking in -- either because of the delivery or because those receiving it aren’t executing. But the bottom line is that quarterback Trevor Siemian gets hit too much -- 19 sacks in 291 attempts in addition to the pounding he’s taken at times even when he’s gotten the ball away -- and the Broncos’ 3.7 yards per carry trailed all but five teams entering this past weekend’s games.

- **Tackle better** The Broncos' defense has had moments when it looks like it could be every bit the dominating group that powered the team’s run to a championship a year ago. But then the Broncos have a night like they did in Oakland -- 11 missed tackles -- or like they did in San Diego. The Broncos have surrendered too many receiving yards to opposing backs and tight ends, while opponents also repeatedly have found some big plays in the run game -- the Broncos have surrendered at least 6 yards per carry on runs over both the opposing left guard and left tackle. The Broncos have a chance to have all of their defensive mainstays in place Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs, which would be the first time that's happened since Week 2.

- **Move the ball** What Siemian has done thus far, with spotty protection and a largely ornamental running game, has been underrated for a first-year starter. That said, he has to improve his tempo to where it was early in the season. Since he suffered a left shoulder injury in Week 4 at Tampa Bay, his delivery has been compromised a bit -- at times he doesn’t fully rotate his upper body or follow through enough -- and his accuracy has been affected. As a result, he has started to hold the ball too long. He has to get it out, even if it will be an incompletion. The Broncos plod on offense at times, so Siemian needs to give them better tempo. Opposing defensive coordinators have said they feel like they can settle in and rush extra players from off the ball because the Broncos' line has struggled with those looks.

- **Get more from their stars** The Broncos need their best players to be brightest. And linebacker Von Miller put himself at the front of the line. “I’ve got to be better,’’ he said. “I’ve got to make big-time, game-changing plays. If I can do that, I can put my teammates and my team in a better situation to win.’’ But Miller isn’t alone, and he should be helped by DeMarcus Ware’s increased playing time in the coming weeks. The Broncos need Demaryius Thomas to dominate, they need Emmanuel Sanders to dominate and they need all of their other notable players on defense -- including Harris, Aqib Talib and T.J. Ward -- to be at their best.

- **Find their attitude** What made the 2015 team different was that it played its best in the big moments, didn’t grouse about officials and penalties and didn’t let one group’s struggles in a particular week affect what they did overall. Perhaps it’s natural in the wake of a Super Bowl win, but the Broncos have worn their frustrations on their sleeves more this year. They have six games remaining -- three in the division to go with another against the New England Patriots -- and will return to work as healthy as they have been since September. As Talib put it, “Everybody has to be ready to do what needs to be done.’’",2016-11-21 16:11:46+00:00,da9mqge,1.0,t3_5e4sbp,213,DenverBroncos

22,"Some good stuff from the article:

- Phillips’ ribs are still a bit sore but considerably improved. “They say it’ll take (three) more weeks before they completely heal but I can at least sleep at night,’’ said Phillips, the Denver Broncos’ defensive coordinator. “It was hard to sleep because I couldn’t move around.’’

- “Obviously, we’d like to be first in the league like we were last year,’’ Phillips said. “I think we’re fifth now but we’re No. 1 in pass defense. The run game we haven’t played as well but we’ve played some awfully good offensive teams this year. We’ve played a lot of high scoring teams, the highest-scoring teams in the league and a lot of the top quarterbacks. It’s pretty amazing where we are pass defense-wise with the quarterbacks we’ve played against. We’re probably ahead of where we were last year in that area. But we’ve got to shore up the run.’’

- Denver’s D last year: No. 1 in total defense, allowing 283.1 yards per game and No. 4 in points allowed at 18.5.

- Denver’s D this year: No. 5 in total defense, allowing 318.0 yards per game and No. 9 in points allowed at 18.9.

- The scoring defense is slightly misleading as it compares to last year because this year’s Broncos’ offense has been more cooperative. Trevor Siemian’s unit has allowed but 8 points through 10 games this year on a safety and pick six. The 2015 Broncos’ offense was responsible for 22 points allowed on three Peyton Manning sixes (all within the first six games) and a safety. Then again, this year’s defense has been more active in helping its offense. The Broncos are second in the NFL with 20 tackeaways, or 2.0 per game. Last year’s defense was tied for 7th in the league with 1.69 takeaways per game.

- The Broncos last year: No. 1 in pass defense (199.6 yards per game), No. 3 against the run (83.6).

- This year: No. 1 in pass defense (194.3 yards per game), No. 28 against the run (123.7).

- The 5.3-yard per game improvement against the pass is impressive considering, as Phillips pointed out, the Broncos have played against six of the NFL’s seven-most prolific passers this year in Drew Brees, Matt Ryan, Philip Rivers, Andrew Luck, Andy Dalton and Derek Carr.

- “I think so. We played almost a flawless game in the first half [vs. Saints] ,’’ Phillips said. “I mean it was unbelievable how good we are playing against a really good offense, a really good team. They had rushed for 248 yards (against San Francisco the week before). We had been hurt in the running game (giving up 218 yards against Oakland) and we really shut down their running game so that’s part of the swarm that’s coming back, too, which is what’s good.’’

- It may be a coincidence but the Broncos’ defense played much better against the Saints when Phillips was coaching from the sideline than it did the week before when he and his painful ribs tried coordinating from the Oakland coaches’ box.

- “Yeah, because you can communicate with people,’’ he said. “I’m kind of a people person, anyway. I can talk to the secondary if there’s a bad play – or a good play. I can talk to them and then the coaches are right there, too, so I can relate easier. We’re still on the phone upstairs, but we can make adjustments easier.’’

- So why can Denver’s defense improve? Because its best defensive back, Aqib Talib, and defensive lineman, Derek Wolfe, are expected to return from their injuries this week. “We coach better with good players that’s for sure,’’ Phillips said. “Especially great players. Those two are really great players.’’

Some good stuff from the article:

- In his usual soft tone, Denver’s coach answered the often repetitive inquiries about changes on the offensive line and the reliance on young up-and-coming players. “I’m excited about what they can become if they’ll just stay the course and keep going,” Kubiak said

- He spoke about the Broncos’ inconsistent running game and about the performance at quarterback: “We need to protect the ball better. Between he and I, we’ve got to do a better job of that.”

- He spoke of the plan for the bye week that included mostly evaluation, but a lot of rest too. And he spoke of his hopes for when the players and coaches returned: “When they walk out of here today, they kind of know what to expect when they’re coming back.”

- With a backloaded schedule in arguably the NFL’s toughest division, the 7-3 Broncos face a steep climb to the finish — one that leaves little room for missteps. The respite this past week was used for rest and evaluation. “I think you always feel like you can be better. Probably some things could have happened that could have put us in worse shape too,” Kubiak said. “But to be 10 weeks into it with some of the changes that we’ve had, playing a first- year quarterback, losing C.J. (Anderson), defensively the guys that we’ve had down, we’re right there.”

**On The Offensive**

- “I’ve seen us do some good stuff at times. I go back three weeks ago against Houston and I watched us come off the ball and run the ball as well as we have in the last two years,” Kubiak said. “Then, I watch us struggle for a couple of weeks. I’m driven to find a way to get it more consistent.”

- “The bottom line, we’re approaching our group (and) we have to improve,” Kubiak said. “It’s not just them, it’s everybody, but Ty deserves to get on the field some more. Donald has to play better along with other guys up front and we need to be more consistent up front in what we’re doing.”

- “(It’s on) the running backs. It’s on us right now,” said Denver running back Kapri Bibbs, a former Colorado State star. “Guys went out and blocked their butts off in that game against New Orleans. (We have to) turn those 10-yard runs into 20-yard runs and turn those 11-yard runs into 30-yard runs and maybe even house calls.”

- Siemian, who won the starting the job in an open competition during the preseason, has shown progress and promise but is making persistent mistakes too, most notably taking too many hard hits. Kubiak has cited Siemian dropping too far behind the line that has made it harder for the tackles to protect him. Siemian cited the two interceptions last Sunday, as well as past ones, that were born of poor decisions. “I think it’s just not seeing them right or feeling a little pressure and getting the ball out early,” he said. “It’s different every time, but no doubt (I) have to take care of the ball.”

- Kubiak has reiterated his faith in Siemian as the starter but is demanding more. “I want Trevor to play at the highest level he can possibly play at down the stretch because that’s important for our team,” Kubiak said.

**Defensive Holes**

- The Broncos lead the league with 93 points scored off takeaways, accounting for 38.9 percent of their overall point total. What has changed is the run defense. Denver, which lost defensive end Malik Jackson and inside linebacker Danny Trevathan to free agency in March. has allowed an average of 123.7 yards rushing per game, a nearly 50 percent increase over last year to rank 28th in the 32-team league.

- Injuries have been played a big role in the problems on defense, dating to training camp, with the loss of defensive end Vance Walker, and including the in-season injuries to DeMarcus Ware (forearm), Derek Wolfe (elbow) and cornerback Aqib Talib (back). Kubiak is hopeful both Wolfe and Talib will be ready after the bye and expects Ware to increase his workload to around 50 snaps a game.

- The stakes are high, but the expectations are higher. “We all know we’re hard on ourselves and know we can get better,” Kubiak said. “We’re getting some guys back. It’s going to be a tough stretch, but it’s going to be a fun stretch. That’s why you coach. That’s why you play.”

24,"Some good stuff from the article:

- “I’m glad I got one tonight,” he said after Colorado’s 3-2 loss at Dallas. “I feel like more should be going in. I have to do a better job of finishing them. The positive thing is I’m getting chances and have a ton of shots on net this season. I’ve been known to be streaky in my career, and I want to be more consistent, but I feel pretty good.”

- MacKinnon brought up his rookie year, when he had three goals in his first 23 games and two in his last 24 games, yet finished with 24 goals. That meant that in the middle, he had 19 goals in 35 games.

- “So that was streaky,” he said. “I’ve been like that my first few years, unfortunately. It’s good and bad. When you get hot, you get hot. I want to have a more consistent season and that starts with being prepared every night and hopefully, I can do it.”

- “He’s been kept off the scoresheet as far as goal-scoring goes, as of late,” Bednar said after the game in Dallas. “He has to go back to the basics, to the work ethic, to shooting pucks and getting to the high-traffic areas, the areas where you can score. He did that again (against Dallas). I didn’t love his first period, just like the rest of our team, but he came hard in the last two periods. He was around the net, he was hanging on to pucks and it wasn’t fancy plays. He was driving his legs and using his legs and doing the right things and sometimes that’s just throwing it on net.”

- After playing wing much of the time in his first three seasons, MacKinnon seems locked in at center under Bednar, and that will be the case again when the Avalanche faces the Minnesota Wild on Saturday night on the second stop of the three-game road trip.

- “I feel good there,” MacKinnon said. “I feel like my faceoffs have come a long way and I’m more consistent at winning those. It’s definitely getting the puck low and with speed, versus at wing you’re kind of stuck on the wall sometimes. I like it. I played it in junior and I’m glad I made the switch.”

- “It stinks, but we can’t fill the void of two of our best players, two of the leaders on our team,” MacKinnon said. “It’s unfortunate that we lost those two guys, but at the same time, we had guys step up (at Dallas).” He went on to note that Mikhail Grigorenko had the other goal, the Russian forward’s first of the season, and that Greer had an assist for his first NHL point.

- “We have to play all the time like we did for the last 40 minutes,” MacKinnon said. “We hounded pucks, we were good defensively and only gave up 22 shots, almost doubling them. We just have to keep shooting pucks on net, retrieving them and playing desperate. We don’t have the most skilled team in the world, especially with those two guys out, so we need to play simple. We’re still a fast team, so we have to use our strengths.”",2016-11-19 00:47:47+00:00,da6f4i7,1.0,t3_5dpy87,170,ColoradoAvalanche

-  For any NFL quarterback, the alpha of athletic alphas, there seems to be two sides to master. There’s simply having the job, being the guy out front, the face of criticism or praise, the one who must carry expectations, hopes and then answer for the results. And there’s doing the job, the actual Xs and Os, making the right decisions in real time against defenses constructed to try to make you fail.

- And in his first year as the guy who followed Peyton Manning into the Broncos’ huddle, Denver Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian has shown he has what it takes to have the job, that combination of unshakable confidence, level head and late-game chops to be the quarterback for a team constructed by a Hall of Fame quarterback and coached by a former NFL quarterback. Siemian has had moments when he looks to be everything an NFL starter needs to be and he’s had moments when he has felt the sting of the growing pains. But one of the biggest things the Broncos like about Siemian is he has shown the mental toughness to be the quarterback for a team with plenty of expectations, with a fan base with plenty of expectations, and be the quarterback who works for two former quarterbacks in John Elway and Gary Kubiak.

- And that’s no small matter, especially because, as former Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer has said, ""Being a quarterback is hard in the league, being the Denver Broncos' quarterback, man, you can’t really get ready for that until you do it."" Not that Siemian would let those thoughts creep too far into his day.

- “I don’t really worry about those kinds of things,” Siemian said. “I feel like we’ve got a lot to do each week and I’m just trying to get better.”

- To that end, Kubiak and his staff sent each of the team’s players into this week’s bye with a specific set of directives. Each player was given, in a series of meetings Tuesday, a specific breakdown of his work over the season’s first 10 weeks, the good and the not so good. That included Siemian, whose directive from Kubiak included that Siemian needed “to play big” the rest of the way and that Kubiak wants Siemian “to be great fast.”

- “We tried to present to the players [Tuesday] -- ‘Here are some things that you do well and here are some things that we don’t do well. As coaches, we have to improve it and you have to improve it.’ They’re walking out of here on their break knowing where they stand.”

- “Things just not seeing them right or feeling a little pressure and getting the ball out a little early, it’s different every time,” Siemian said. “No doubt have to take care of the ball. ... I’ve coughed it up last two weeks, so you can’t do that.”

- Along with his composure overall, Kubiak likes Siemian’s willingness to hang in to make a play -- he called it “great” -- but it’s also clear Siemian’s play has suffered at times with the left shoulder injury he suffered in Week 4 and some of the hits he has taken on the shoulder since. Still, Kubiak has gone as far as to say that “even when you’re getting hit, you’re still in charge of the football.”

- “I think a lot of it is on me,” Siemian said. “A lot of times I’m holding the ball for too long. I get what I deserve in that sense, but it’s a team deal and a team effort. It’s an 11-man operation.""

- “I want Trevor to play at the highest level he can possibly play at down the stretch because that’s important for our team,” Kubiak said. “ ... It’s time to be at your best. That’s what we’re trying to get to.”",2016-11-18 17:33:58+00:00,da5w2ag,1.0,t3_5dnnc6,213,DenverBroncos
26,"Some good stuff from the article:

- It was the first ever game-winning, blocked extra-point, defensive conversion. And it started with a simple question. “Joe D. was like, ‘I heard you can jump?'” Simmons said of Broncos special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis. “And I said, ‘Yeah.’ ”

- Simmons’ block was the logical conclusion to a series of small changes in the NFL. But it remains rare. It requires a perfect storm of events. First, let’s go back to the beginning. Over time, NFL teams decided to specialize by hiring a long-snapper. His only job is to snap the ball on kicking plays. On regular offensive plays the center is a lineman. He’s required to snap the ball and block defenders. But on field goals and punts, because the role is so specialized, the snapper looks through his own legs, back to the holder or punter, instead of forward at the defense. That leaves him vulnerable to taking a massive hit from a defensive lineman. So the NFL made it illegal to rush a long-snapper. And, defenders cannot be within a yard of the center at the snap. It gives him time to look up and defend himself.

- “The only way to get a field goal blocked, against certain teams, is to go over the top,” DeCamillis said.

- So why don’t teams do this on every kick? The risk-reward ratio is often too great. The leaper is not allowed to propel himself off another player. And he can’t even touch the center. If Simmons had landed on top of the Saints long-snapper, the Broncos would have been penalized 15 yards. Early in games, that penalty can be significant. But the Broncos had nothing to gamble. Either they blocked the kick or lost the game. The penalty was toothless. Timing was crucial. But there was more involved than circumstantial timing. Simmons needed to know how to time his jump. He did it by memorizing the Saints snap count.

- “I was creeping up all game, coming up and going back,” Simmons said. “When I was creeping, I was getting a feel for it.”

- Simmons was helped by Denver’s defensive ends, Jared Crick and Adam Gotsis, who, after the snap, pinned the Saints center to the ground, making Simmon’s leap easier. “We just put our hands on him and made sure he didn’t get up,” Crick said. “As far as I know, it’s legal. If it’s not, they didn’t call it.”

- The NFL’s vice president of officiating, Dean Blandino, recognized the confusion. He published a video this week explaining why it was a legal play. “He’s going to get his hands up top on the snapper and push him towards the ground. That’s legal,” Blandino said. “Open-hand push. If there was a grab and a pull that would be defensive holding.”

- DeCamillis, who talked about the possibility of a Broncos blocked kick last month, saw the perfect storm coming. “You try to play the team that you are playing. If it’s there, sometimes you work it and sometimes you don’t,” he said. “We’ll see how it goes from there.”

**Keys to the leap**

Blocking a kick by leaping over the long-snapper remains rare in the NFL because it requires a perfect storm of circumstance and rules. How it happens:

1. The risk-reward ratio is steep. If a team messes it up, it can be penalized. It’s best to wait until there’s nothing left to lose.

2. The rules are specific and difficult. No defensive player can be within one yard of the center at the moment of the snap. He’s in a bubble.

3. The leaper is alone. He cannot touch the center with his hands or feet and no other player can help propel the leaper into the air.

4. Help is limited. Defensive linemen can pounce on the long-snapper, but only within limits. They cannot pull on the center or knock him back. They can only pin him down.

5. Two points are a nice carrot. The NFL in 2015 changed its rules on extra points, giving the defensive team two points if they return a turnover to the opposite end zone. Before then, a blocked kick was called dead.",2016-11-18 17:27:39+00:00,da5vr2m,1.0,t3_5dnlkh,351,DenverBroncos
27,"Some good stuff from the article:

- Before the Denver Broncos had played a single down this season, before they had made a tackle or returned a kick, coach Gary Kubiak had already gotten a glimpse of the future. ""I always say the one thing about last year’s team that I’ll always remember is it got everything it had out of itself, it gave everything it had,"" Kubiak said. ""We’ll see what this team can do, but one thing I know is we have a lot of young guys who are going to grow up fast because they're going to have to play.""

- ""When you get here you just want to be a part of it, be with the team,"" Simmons said. ""And then you’re around these guys who’ve done a lot in this league -- I mean, they won it all last year -- and you want to make a play, make some plays that make a difference, so to be able to do that feels pretty good. You want to make more.""

- Time will ultimately tell, but if you lump the 24-year-old Siemian into the group, the Broncos’ 2016 rookie class has the potential to be a foundation-builder like the 2006 and 2011 draft classes were. The Broncos pulled five future starters out of the ’06 draft, including Jay Cutler, Elvis Dumervil and wide receiver Brandon Marshall. And the Broncos picked seven players who eventually started games for the team in the ’11 draft, which will always be led by linebacker Von Miller.

- ""I think when you come here you notice a lot of the guys here are guys they picked,"" Parks said. ""They pick them and play them ... so, yeah, you always hope you show them you can be one of those guys.""

- ""I want to see Book improve,"" Kubiak said. ""... Book’s reads have to improve. The biggest thing, too, is he has open-field ability when you get him out in space. We need to get him in space, but sometimes as a back you have to get yourself in space. It’s kind of like when I’m talking about the quarterback, it’s being hard on Book and saying, ‘Hey Book, you’re the guy. Let’s play big time these last six weeks. Let’s take it up another notch.'""

- ""I feel like I can be,"" Booker said when asked if he can be the lead back. ""I’ve had a couple fumbles that were my fault and some mistakes, but I feel more comfortable in the offense and I’m trying to get better every week. ... I want to help.""

- Fullback Andy Janovich, the sixth-round pick, has been a starter and until he suffered a hand injury -- he’s been playing with a cast of late -- he had some personnel executives in the league saying he had Pro Bowl-potential at the position.

- Rookie punter Riley Dixon, the Broncos’ seventh-round pick this past April, was awarded the job at the end of training camp.

- Also, first-round pick Paxton Lynch made one start -- Week 5 against Atlanta -- in place of an injured Siemian, second-round pick Adam Gotsis has been in the defensive line rotation and both Parks and Simmons have played plenty on special teams to go with some situational work on defense.

- ""I tell those guys all the time, they’re however many weeks we’re in now, they can’t be like rookies anymore,"" said cornerback Chris Harris Jr. ""When we get back, we need everybody.""",2016-11-18 17:18:01+00:00,da5v9xg,1.0,t3_5dnk5c,185,DenverBroncos

- ""I think we would have taken it if we said in Week 10 we were going to be 7-3, with what's happened,"" Elway said Tuesday. ""We haven't played our best football yet, which I think is the encouraging thing, but we've played hard week in and week out. I'm excited about the possibilities of what we can do.""

- ""We feel like we can get better on the offensive side. We've got a lot of room for improvement there,"" Elway said. ""But we've figured out ways to win, and that's what you have to do. So we're excited about the last six [games].""

- Elway also answered questions about his new role as honorary chairman of the 2018 U.S. Senior Open, to be held from June 25 through July 1 that year at the Broadmoor East Golf Course in Colorado Springs. Elway, a 1.9-handicap golfer, first took up the sport in earnest after joining the Broncos in 1983 and plays regularly, although the frequency of his rounds dropped after he became the team's Executive Vice President of Football Operations in 2011. ""I wouldn't say it came quickly, but I worked hard at it,"" Elway said.

- Some of the best golfers among his former teammates include quarterback Brian Griese, offensive linemen Keith Kartz and Dave Studdard. The golf bug has also bitten fellow Ring of Famer Terrell Davis.

- People don't often get to see it. He doesn't pound his chest or search for a camera to scream into. His facial expression is often one of a guy who's checking the mailbox. ""I just play, I try to make every play, every time,"" Thomas said. ""(The Saints) game, I think it was my best overall this year. I can be better, do more things, but so far with everything I think it was my best game.""

- And for one emotion-field moment in the fourth quarter Sunday, Thomas flashed the whole package. When quarterback Trevor Siemian took a big hit to stand in and loft a pass toward the left corner of the end zone, he did what he said he has do to more of to close out this season -- ""I have to just put the ball out there and give [Thomas] and (wide receiver) Emmanuel [Sanders] a chance to make a play.""

- Then Thomas showed a side he rarely shows after touchdowns, spiking the ball like he wanted to put it 12 feet below the Superdome. ""When he gets his motor going like that, after the (touchdown) catch he was really good (Sunday), to me, and he made a couple of great catches on third downs,"" Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. ""He is a captain of this football team and when he plays with that type of emotion and that type of fire and he's making those plays, usually good things are happening for our team.""

- Thomas finished the Broncos' 25-23 win over the Saints with eight receptions for 87 yards and that touchdown. While the eight catches were a single-game best this season, he's had more receiving yards in three games. But it was the feel, the vibe in his outing this past Sunday that got noticed. There was a one-handed effort for a key first down, his blocking on some of the run plays and the gimme-that touchdown catch with the exclamation point at the end.

- Thomas was voted a captain by his teammates this season and many of them have seen him pile up the yards, catches and touchdowns with his trademark mild-mannered demeanor. But several of those same teammates said this past Sunday following the win that they liked seeing Thomas wear a little more emotion on his sleeve. They liked the ferocity which he snatched the touchdown pass out of the air and really liked how he pounded the ball into the turf to celebrate it. If the Broncos can iron out the wrinkles in their offense, especially their passing offense, Thomas has to be a big part of that.

- ""I always think I want to get the ball into their hands more,"" Siemian said. ""That's when we're going to be at our best.""

- ""I think DT has been very consistent and he's capable of taking the team on his shoulders,"" Kubiak said. ""And you can see some of that in him (Sunday). He played really well.""

- When the Broncos return from their bye to prepare for the Nov. 27 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, it might finally happen. The Broncos might, for the first time since their Week 2 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, have all of their defensive starters available to play.

- “We’ve shown what we can do with some of our young guys and other guys coming in,"" cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. “And I think we played some good football in there. But we want to be at our best for these games coming up and get into that playoff mode.""

- Since outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware fractured his right forearm just before halftime of that win over the Colts, the Broncos have been forced into some roster juggling they didn’t really have to deal with in 2015, when the group finished at, or near, the top of every major defensive category on the way to a dominant postseason run. But this time around, Ware missed five games after his injury, Pro Bowl cornerback Aqib Talib has missed the past three games with a back injury and defensive end Derek Wolfe has missed a game with a fracture near his right elbow. Linebacker Brandon Marshall has started nine of Denver's 10 games, but he has been slowed at times with a hamstring injury.

- “We have had guys come in and do the job,"" said linebacker Shane Ray, who started the five games Ware missed. “But I think everybody knows what we can do with everybody back.""

- Talib practiced Tuesday for the first time since Oct. 28 and has said he will be ready to play next week. Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said Wolfe likely would be back at practice by the Wednesday after they return from the bye, and that if expectations hold, he could be ready for at least some duty in the defensive-line rotation. And while Ware has played in the Broncos' past three games -- going 26, 28 and 30 plays, respectively -- Kubiak said this week he believes Ware is ready for “50 plays a game"" when the Broncos return to the practice field. “I think so -- I feel really good,’’ Ware said. “Ready to go for this run we want to be on.""

- Despite those injuries and some lapses in run defense, the Broncos did arrive at the bye week fifth in total defense, tied for eighth in scoring defense, tied for second in sacks and No. 1 in pass defense. That’s a quality résumé for a team that was missing Talib (who was playing at an All-Pro level before the injury) and was without Ware and Wolfe, all three key figures in the team’s scheme.

- Miller still has battled his way to 9.5 sacks, third best in the league. But he had four of those sacks in the two games both Ware and Talib played in this season and has just two in the past four games against protection schemes built to shift blockers his way and against quarterbacks looking to get the ball out quickly. “I think I should get sacks all the time,"" Miller said. “I need to make more game-changing plays -- that’s my job, that’s what I’m supposed to do. But with DeMarcus back, Wolfe, Talib, offenses have to play us different. And if they want to keep double-teaming me, or whatever, those other guys are going to get there.""

- “I’m proud of the team,"" Kubiak said. “I’m proud of how hard we worked to get in the position that we’re in. We all know we’re hard on ourselves and know we can get better. We’re getting some guys back. It’s going to be a tough stretch, but it’s going to be a fun stretch. That’s why you coach. That’s why you play.”

- Said Ray: “I think everybody’s locked in. We’ll take the break and the rest that we need and we’ll be ready to go when we come back.”",2016-11-17 17:01:14+00:00,da4e7tv,1.0,t3_5dgvpu,153,DenverBroncos

- Seven months ago, Simmons and Parks were the eighth and eighteenth safeties selected in the NFL Draft, joining a team with the league’s best secondary. They knew their chances of becoming an immediate starter were almost nil.

- “Ninety percent of me was thinking I’m going to have to earn my playtime. These dudes have a lot of talent,” said Simmons, the Broncos’ third round pick. “I remember watching the Super Bowl thinking, man, they’re making the best offense in the NFL look terrible. So when I got drafted my first thought was I have to show these guys I can ball too.”

- Simmons did that Sunday and it earned him an AFC special teams player of the week honor for his block of what could have been the game winning PAT by New Orleans.

- Parks, a sixth-round pick, wasn’t as worried about the secondary’s talent, knowing he would have to fight to just make the roster, but he has been surprised at how supportive the veterans have been.

- “I came into the best situation possible,” Parks said. “I came into a group of guys who aren’t stingy. They want you to eat just as well as they do, if not eat more than they do.”

- Parks has developed a special connection with veteran safety T.J. Ward, whom he backs up on defense. Despite the natural competition, Parks said Ward has been more than just a mentor to the rookies.

- “They play hard. They got instincts. They got talent,” Ward said. “The best part is they listen. It’s good having those young guys on the team.”

- They’ve made plays on defense as well as special teams. Parks had an interception against Cincinnati and Simmons had a sack against San Diego. They’ve seamlessly merged themselves into a talented secondary high on attitude and talent, but low on tolerance for rookie mistakes. It’s that accountability level that has kept them on their toes. 

- “I know there’s a hungry kid that’s in middle school, high school, college who wants to be in the same position that I am,” Parks said. “So I gotta make sure there ain’t a hungrier dog on the field than me, especially on the other side of the ball.”

- The rookie off-season roommates aren’t worried about their future roles. They’re soaking in the present. They study tape, hang out, and dream of making more big plays.

- “If you surround yourself with people that are just like you then you won’t have anything to worry about,” Parks said. “We expect to make plays.”

- “He’s capable of taking the team on his shoulders, and you could see some of that in him,” Kubiak said. “He is a captain, and when he plays with that type of emotion and that type of fire and he’s making those plays, usually good things are happening for our team.”

- “I like to see D.T. bring that spark, not just from his playmaking ability but from emotional boost,” Sanders said. “We work off each other. We’re trying to be the catalysts of the offense. We want to do more than what people think we’re capable of.”",2016-11-15 21:06:42+00:00,da1sp78,1.0,t3_5d3ydp,11095,DenverBroncos
46,"Some good stuff from the article:

- Broncos starting quarterback Trevor Siemian got a rest day Tuesday in an attempt to get his banged up left shoulder better ahead of the bye week. That meant Broncos rookie quarterback Paxton Lynch took all of the Broncos’ team practice reps, a rare opportunity for the young quarterback to work with the starting offense.

- Asked about Lynch, Kubiak said: “Paxton shows amazing talent throwing the ball and makes plays. Then there’s inconsistency in doing the right thing — keying coverage right. That’s why he’s young. Good work for him today. He was in control of the football team for the most part.”

- Kubiak said several starters didn’t practice Tuesday so it was a good opportunity to give young players such as Lynch extended reps. Nowhere is the Broncos’ youth more apparent than at quarterback where they have a first-year starter, Siemian, and and Lynch backing him up.

- “They’ve done really well. The thing I’m excited about is I see growth every day,” Kubiak said. “I see growth every game from Trevor and I watched Paxton run our team today. The future is very bright for our organization because we have two good young players. We want them to be great quick(ly).”

- Cornerback Aqib Talib returned to practice Tuesday. He has missed the Broncos’ last three games with a lower back injury that required him to get an injection a couple of weeks ago. Tuesday, he returned to Broncos’ practice.

- “He’s feeling good. The injection was a successful thing that they did,” Kubiak said. “And I know how excited he is about the last six weeks. Good to see him get some work in and we’ll pick it up again next week.” Talib expects to return for the Broncos’ next game, Nov. 27 against Kansas City. He leads the team with three interceptions and the Broncos’ pass defense has suffered in his absence.

- “It’s attitude. He’s such a positive, playmaking, energy guy,” Kubiak said. “Aqib is a loud guy, we all know that, but it’s all about football when he’s out here. He’s very bright. We missed him and it’s great to have him back. It’s great to know that he’s feeling well.”

- Outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected as the Broncos nominee for the Art Rooney Sportsmanship Award Tuesday. The finalists will be trimmed to eight in December and a winner will be chosen in February. … Safety Justin Simmons, who blocked the late extra point against the Saints, was nominated for clutch performer and rookie of the week.",2016-11-15 20:58:50+00:00,da1sb62,1.0,t3_5d508n,142,DenverBroncos
47,"Some good stuff from the article:

- When the Broncos return to work next week, their embattled offensive line will feature a new wrinkle. Former Colorado State standout Ty Sambrailo has earned additional playing time at right tackle. Coach Gary Kubiak didn't name him the starter when asked by Denver7, but spoke Tuesday as if Sambrailo will take over for the slumping Donald Stephenson.

- ""I think Ty deserves to play more and he's gonna play,"" Kubiak said. ""Are we going to play six or seven guys? That's what (line coach) Clancy (Barone), (assistant Oline coach) James (Cregg), (offensive coordinator) Rick (Dennison) and I are trying to figure out right now. But Ty is fixing to play a lot more football. He's worked his way back. Yes, he's going to play more.""

- ""It's about getting more consistent,"" Sambrailo told Denver7. ""For those who haven't played line, it looks simple, but it's not. There's a lot that goes into (the line playing well together).""

- Kubiak and the coaching staff studied the film Monday night and presented to the linemen Tuesday what they have done well and what requires improvement. Kubiak reiterated that the coaches and players must improve in this area, which has been defined by puzzling highs and lows.  The Broncos rank in the bottom third in rushing yards per game and yards per carry.

- ""They are walking out of here on their break knowing where they stand,"" Kubiak said. ""We need to play better upfront and we have at times.""",2016-11-15 20:55:28+00:00,da1s50g,1.0,t3_5d4zfq,157,DenverBroncos

65,"**3. Donald Stephenson, T, Denver Broncos**

For the second week running, Stephenson was a walking trainwreck for the Broncos offense in their close win over New Orleans. This week he was bad enough that he lasted 53 snaps before being sat down for the remainder of the game, but in that time, he managed to surrender six total pressures and get beat repeatedly in the run game. Stephenson has been the single biggest issue in Denver’s offense in each of the past two weeks, but the problem is they have no better option in personnel terms, so they need to start to come up with ways to give him help, rather than replace him.

**9. Ty Sambrailo, T, Denver Broncos**

This is why Denver is in trouble at the right tackle spot. After finally tiring of Donald Stephenson’s revolving door performance art, the Broncos benched him in favor of Ty Sambrailo, who in just 17 pass-blocking snaps surrendered four hurries, for the worst pass-blocking efficiency score of the week at his position. It’s a close competition, but Sambrailo is – if anything – worse than Stephenson, and whichever the team turns to they have no viable right tackle.

- Darian Stewart had a feeling Sunday was going to be a special day for him. A lot of his family members made the 450-mile trip from Huntsville, Ala. to New Orleans to watch his Broncos play the Saints. A couple of his nieces who had never seen him play were among them. The Broncos’ safety even wore one of his best suits to and from the game.

- “I’m just trying to get AFC defensive player of the week. That’s my goal right there,” Stewart said. “I’m just trying to continue the trend.”

- The Broncos’ veteran safety has a strong chance of being the third Broncos player to win AFC defensive player of the week honor. Von Miller versus Indianapolis and Bradley Roby versus San Diego won previously this season.

- Stewart is the first Bronco in 15 years (Deltha O’Neal, 2001) and the first NFL player this season with three takeaways in a game. He joined cornerback Aqib Talib as the only Broncos with two interceptions in a game this season. Stewart struggled to recall a better personal performance. “Not since high school,” Stewart said. “That ball was finding me today.”

- The Broncos safeties were unsafe to the Saints Sunday. Safety T.J. Ward recovered a Saints fumble. Rookie safety Justin Simmons blocked an extra-point attempt  and rookie safety Will Parks ran it back for two points, the winning margin. Cornerback Bradley Roby had a hand in two of the Broncos’ four takeaways. He tipped a pass that Stewart intercepted and forced a fumble.

- “Stew called out almost every Saints play during practice. You could tell he knew them well,” Parks said. “He was always around the ball. It translated on the field. He’s playing on a Pro-Bowl level right now.”

- Ward added: “I’ve had a day. Bradley had a day. Stew had a day. As long as somebody has a day, we’ll be alright.”",2016-11-14 13:42:35+00:00,d9zrlo2,1.0,t3_5cvza4,150,DenverBroncos

- “We didn’t let them run, that’s what it was,’’ said Broncos safety Darian Stewart. “That was the key. (Strong safety) T.J. (Ward) went down and moved closer to the box.’’

- “Coming off not our best game and knowing New Orleans were coming off a real good rushing game, we knew stopping the run was going to be a big emphasis,’’ said defensive end Jared Crick, who tied Ward and linebacker Todd Davis with a team-most six tackles. “We’ve got a good game plan going in and we executed today.’’

- The Broncos could return from their bye week with a later start for their next game Nov. 27 against the Kansas City Chiefs at soon-to-be-renamed Sports Authority Field at Mile High. NBC Sunday Night Football currently has the on-paper mismatch of the 7-1 New England Patriots playing at the 3-7 New York Jets that night. Don’t be surprised if NBC flexes out of that game and instead moves the Broncos-Chiefs game to its Sunday night slot. The 7-3 Broncos and 7-2 Chiefs figure to be far more competitive than the Patriots-Jets both on the field and in the TV ratings. The Broncos already have the maximum five prime time games on their schedule this season. They’ve played four and have a fifth on Christmas night at Kansas City. The NFL allows for a sixth game to be flexed to Sunday night.

- In the third quarter of the Broncos’ win at New Orleans, Sambrailo replaced Stephenson. The move was made in large part because Stephenson has not played well upon his return. “All I can say is it looked like Donald struggled at times, but we went into the game saying Ty was going to play some,’’ Kubiak said. “That’s nothing against Donald, it’s probably more Ty working his tail off and getting himself in position to contribute to the team.’’

- Billy Winn got his first start of the season at the defensive end position normally occupied by Derek Wolfe, who was out with a fractured elbow. …

- The Broncos went with only two running backs as Juwan Thompson was inactive. So was cornerback Taurean Nixon, who was disappointed because he played his college ball here at Tulane University. Dressing instead were receiver Cody Latimer and defensive tackle Darius Kilgo.

- Will “White Shoes” Parks has a nice ring to it. The Broncos’ rookie safety did a tight-rope dance down the sideline, saying he didn’t step out-of-bounds, making the play of the game to score after fellow rookie safety Justin Simmons blocked a New Orleans extra-point attempt at the Superdome on Sunday. Parks said his white shoes never touched out of bounds on the play and officials didn’t rule otherwise.

- “I did ballerina when I was 5 years old, so I know I had the balance to stay in. They couldn’t tell me I was out,” said Parks, a sixth-round pick by the Broncos from Arizona in April. “I was thinking run like somebody’s chasing you with a big ol’ gun. Just run. That’s what I did. I was running so fast I really couldn’t control my feet. I was just moving.”

- Broncos special teams coach Joe DeCamillis ordered the “leaper” call for Simmons in a last-ditch effort to save a game that was slipping away. Simmons is the team’s best leaper and maybe its most athletic player and had practiced to play several times last week.

- “That’s a call you use if you need a big block to win a game,” Simmons said. “It’s all or nothing. It’s all about timing it up. It felt great. I knew I was going to clear him, but I wasn’t sure how quick their operation would be as far as getting the ball off. It all worked out.”

- Simmons, a third-round pick in April from Boston College, said he would have knock Parks out if he hadn’t scored. The rookie safeties and summer roommates are tight and both have come up big in reserve roles. They saw flaws in the New Orleans field-goal unit’s protection and its cohesiveness with kicker Wil Lutz. They exploited that vulnerability.

- As for those white shoes, Parks said he practiced in them all week and they felt good. He decided to stick with them come game time on Sunday. “I’m keeping them on every game now,” Parks said.

Cornerback Chris Harris’ smile grew even wider: “And ‘lib back, like he said. To be able to get him back adds even more impact players to our team.”

- The Broncos all-pro cornerback received good news after getting a second opinion on his back injury in California the week of Denver’s loss to Oakland.

- “We talked all last night; I just want to see them fight,” head coach Gary Kubiak told KOA after the game. “Obviously we’re missing a couple of guys, and we’ve been struggling a bit. I asked them to come in here and just lay it all on the line, and that’s what we did as a football team. It didn’t look good there at the end but we found a way to make a big, big play and that’s what this league is all about. Very proud of our guys.”

- “It’s a desperation type play in a lot of ways because all you have to do is touch one guy and it’s illegal,” the head coach added of the miraculous block. “But the kid did a great job of timing it and getting over the top. Joe works with them all the time, and there’s just certain situations where you give it a shot, we gave it a shot, and it wins the game for us.”

- One of the redeeming attributes of this Denver squad is their ability to ‘never say die.’ In fact, rather than putting his head down before the play, Parks was already planning on running it back. “I knew it was coming,” the rookie told reporters. “As soon as I heard [the play call] I said, ‘Get back, watch the ball.'”

- “I knew he had hops in practice,” Parks added of his training camp roommate who made the block. “He went about 45 [inches in the air]there to get the block, and I was just sitting there, I grabbed the ball, and I was just thinking, “Man, run like somebody’s chasing you with a big ol’ gun. Just run.'”

- “It was very tough man, but those guys, man,” Stewart said to KOA, at a loss for words for his team’s relentlessness. “Last week’s outing wasn’t good enough, and we knew we needed to come back and be big again this week.”

80,"Some good stuff from the article:

- The Raiders’ 218 rushing yards are the most the Broncos have given up in the past four years. Coaches yelled and challenges were delivered in the locker room.

- “As linebackers, as defensive linemen, we take pride, that’s what we do – we stop the run. It’s a passing league, but you gotta run to win. And we have to stop the run to win,” Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall said. “It’s an insult when teams line up and say we’re going to run the ball down your throats. We’re tired of it, but at the same time we gotta stop it. If we don’t stop it, they’re going to keep talking about it and doing it.”

- Denver’s run defense ranks 29th in the 32-team NFL, giving up 128.6 yards a game. It also is in the bottom-10 in rushing yards allowed per carry (4.4), rushing touchdowns allowed (nine), 20+ yard rushes (eight) and 40+ yard rushes (three). Last season, it allowed 45 yards less rushing yards per game and a league-best 3.3 yards per carry. It also had fewer 20-plus (five) and 40-plus yard (one) rushes.

- “It’s coaching probably. I always blame myself first. I think that’s where you start,” defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said. “Sometimes it’s not working enough on it in training camp, working in the preseason or utilizing the talent we have. We don’t have great size inside, so we have to do some things to help us there.”

- Many Broncos defenders are adamant it isn’t a scheme problem, pointing toward their success last season with the same defense. Phillips said they ran more blitzes against Oakland than they have against other teams over the past two seasons. Oakland went with big personnel packages using a sixth offensive lineman to control the running game. It also used two and three tight ends with single back and fullback formations.

- Former Broncos’ defensive lineman Alfred Williams said offenses are challenging players who aren’t used to tackling consistently in the running game, such as cornerback Chris Harris. Linebackers and defensive backs have struggled to fill gaps. “In football, the only way you get embarrassed is when somebody runs the ball on you. It’s the ultimate slap in the face,” said Williams, who said the Broncos should call more zone coverage in short-yardage situations.

- “It’s a pride thing, it’s an effort thing and it’s a want to,” said Broncos outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware, a leader in the locker room.  “Stopping the run when you know they are going to use 13, 12 personnel, bring a big offensive tackle in there, it’s a grit thing,” Ware said. “It’s saying that no matter how many guys you bring in, we’re still going to be able to stop the run.”

- “People underestimated the loss of Vance Walker,” Marshall said. “He’s stout in there. Malik, too. We lost some good guys.”

- “They’re telling us get off the block, stay in your gap, get to the ball with an attitude, don’t accept being blocked,” Marshall said. “It’s echoing loud enough because we don’t want to be the Achilles’ heel of this defense, and right now that’s what it is.”

- “Especially being down early in the second quarter, you want to be the guy to make the play,” linebacker Todd Davis said. “And if you miss by one gap, you’re out of place and then a big play happens.”

84,"Some good stuff from the article:

- Gotsis is  learning the nuances of the NFL game. The 6-foot-4, 287-pound Australian is modeling his game after defensive end Derek Wolfe, the Broncos’ longest-tenured and best defensive lineman.

- “He’s always watching. I can feel him watching. It’s kind of creepy,” Wolfe said. “He’s always watching everything I eat, watching me period. It’s like a little puppy following me around.”

- Wolfe said he did a similar thing as a rookie, following former Broncos defensive linemen Elvis Dumervil and Justin Bannan.

- Gotsis, or veteran defensive end Billy Winn, are the most likely options to get the start Sunday in place Wolfe who will miss 2-4 weeks with a hairline right elbow fracture he suffered when the Broncos lost at Oakland on Sunday. Winn has played 29-percent of the Broncos’ defensive snaps this season. Gotsis has played 14-percent. Backup nose tackle Darius Kilgo may also see time at defensive end. Both Winn and Gotsis are more traditional run stoppers. Winn, who has 21 starts over five seasons, said he feels no pressure in taking a larger role and he’s ready to “carry the flag.”

- “He’s got a long way to go,” Kollar said. “It’s almost like that for every rookie on the defensive line. It takes guys a long time to get used to it – the technique. You’re playing against guys that weigh 320-350 every week. He might’ve been playing at Georgia Tech against a kid that’s 17 years old and 230 pounds. It just takes time. He’s got a ways to go to get where we want him to be.”",2016-11-13 16:25:07+00:00,d9yjhcn,1.0,t3_5cqmmh,107,DenverBroncos

- New Orleans’ coach Sean Payton went through similar challenges with his team in 2010. The Saints won it all in 2009, beating Peyton Manning’s Indianapolis Colts in the Super Bowl, but settled for a wild-card spot and 11-5 record the following season. New Orleans then lost to the Brandon Stokley/Tyler Polumbus/7-9 Seattle Seahawks in a first-round playoff game.

- “The one thing that’s obvious is you play longer so your offseason is shorter, it’s reduced,’’ Payton said after the year-after-Super Bowl-challenges in a conference call with the Denver media this week. “When you really look at the amount of games you play all the way through the championship game and then the Super Bowl, your time is different with that calendar than it would be normally. It’s a good problem to have.’’

-  “I think No. 1 our league seems to be year-to-year with each team,’’ Payton said. “We try to look at it that way. With free agency there’s always an attrition in the offseason to players you lose, players that you sign. And then I think each week you’re playing teams that are certainly going to play their best knowing that they’re playing last year’s Super Bowl winner.’’",2016-11-10 18:25:33+00:00,d9unkdl,1.0,t3_5c9eng,90,DenverBroncos

- After a rough start that saw him go 0-for-16 from the field in his first four games, Murray is looking much more like the player the Nuggets were certain they were getting when they selected him seventh overall in this year’s NBA Draft. In his last three games (19.3 minutes per), Murray is averaging 9.3 points on 45.8 percent shooting overall and, most importantly, 41.7 percent from the 3-point line. He scored 10 points on 4-of-7 shooting, including making two of his four 3-point attempts.

- “I’m a lot more comfortable,” said Murray, who looks to build on his recent success tonight in the Nuggets game against Golden State. “I just feel good out there. I just had to get that first bucket out of the way. After that, it was just play the game. They give me the green light to shoot the ball, so I’ve been shooting it with confidence and not think twice about it.”

- “And not just for me, but for everybody,” Murray said. “For Malik (Beasley), for Juancho (Hernangomez), for a lot of the rookies. It was good for us to get out there and get experience running the plays against live talent in an actual game.

Some good stuff from the article:

- “Man, he’s disruptive. I mean, he has no weaknesses,” quarterback Drew Brees said.

- “He’s elite. And you would say probably -- no, you would say clearly -- I think the best pass-rusher in our game right now,” coach Sean Payton said.

- But offensive tackle Zach Strief, who will have the pleasure of facing Miller for most of the game Sunday when the Saints host Denver, may have had the best description of all. “He has a really rare combination of power and speed, get-off, anticipation. He’s kinda got everything,” Strief said. “If you made a list of the perfect pass rusher ... when kids create a player on Madden, they give him all the attributes that Von Miller has.”

- “He’s so explosive,” Brees said. “He’s such a great athlete. Even when he drops in coverage, he can flip his hips and run and do some things that you say for a guy that big and strong and powerful, that’s pretty incredible. And then obviously when he rushes the passer, the first thing you notice is his get-off. The minute that ball’s snapped, he is upfield and wreaking havoc. He’s got all kinds of variety when it comes to his pass-rush moves. He’s got power, he’s got speed, quickness, spin. I mean, he can do it all. So you’ve obviously gotta have a plan for a guy like that. And also for me, there’s gotta be a clock in my head. You can’t be holding that ball when he’s rushing that passer.”

- “Clearly you have to have a plan for Von. And the bigger problem now is DeMarcus Ware is healthy,” Payton said, referring to Ware returning to the lineup two weeks ago from a broken arm. “So you see him getting his legs back and getting the pressure. Look, it’s what made these guys so good a year ago. So we’ve gotta have a plan and be ready for how they rush and be ready to get rid of it on time.”

- Unfortunately the Saints’ stellar left tackle, Terron Armstead, has been dealing with a lingering knee issue that has his status in jeopardy this week. Armstead has been fighting through the injury in recent weeks, but he left last Sunday’s game at San Francisco early and did not return. The good news is that second-year pro Andrus Peat has been solid as the backup left tackle this year. And Strief is having an excellent season at age 33. Pro Football Focus rated him as the best right tackle in the NFL at the midseason point. “As long as the Saints keep rating me as the No. 1 right tackle on this team and I can keep playing, I’ll take that,” Strief said when asked about the rating. “Look, there’s a lot more that goes into it than an individual’s performance. Obviously being balanced helps a ton, and this offense has been effective, and Drew’s been getting the ball out. All those things factor into it.”",2016-11-10 17:06:12+00:00,d9ujdtt,1.0,t3_5c8xga,141,DenverBroncos
106,"Some good stuff from the article:

- “It’s every week, man,"" said Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib. “Every week, we face those guys who know what to do and where to go with the ball. ... We face the ballers.""

- In fact, when the Broncos face the New Orleans Saints and quarterback Drew Brees on Sunday, it will mean a Denver pass defense rated No. 1 in the league will have faced the league's top five quarterbacks in passing yardage within a 10-week span. Brees is second in passing yards, and the Broncos have already faced Matt Ryan (No. 1), Andrew Luck (No. 3), Philip Rivers (No. 4) and Derek Carr (No. 5). Toss in Cincinnati’s Andy Dalton (No. 8), and the Broncos will have faced six of the top eight passers in the league in their first 10 games, with Tom Brady waiting in December as well as another game against Carr to close out the regular season.

- Against those previous five quarterbacks, including Dalton, the Broncos have not surrendered as much as a 270-yard passing game. And along with the five touchdown passes they've given up, they have five interceptions in those six games -- the Broncos have faced Rivers twice. Rivers, in the second meeting between the teams, had the most passing yards, 267, but the Broncos intercepted him three times in that game. The Broncos are 3-3 in those games, with a split with Rivers to go with wins over Luck and Dalton. Ryan, Rivers and Carr have won games against the Broncos, with the most recent being the Raiders’ win this past Sunday night. Oakland pounded out 218 rushing yards, and Carr finished with 184 passing yards and no touchdowns.

- “We’re tested,’’ said Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. “We have played the best.’’

- “We talked about that [Wednesday] morning,"" said Broncos coach Gary Kubiak. “We’ve faced a lot of good quarterbacks, and this one’s got to be on top of the list. He’s exceptional, one of the finest players I’ve ever seen, from being a quarterback guy and watching that position. This guy’s been exceptional for years and years. Really at the top of his game right now.""

- Kubiak, a former NFL quarterback who has coached quarterbacks for well over two decades as a head coach and NFL assistant, called Brees' ability “brilliant.’’ “Drew can throw to spots with his eyes closed,"" Kubiak said. “He goes out and plays, boom, boom, boom. That’s the way you teach guys to play quarterback. That’s what he does. He knows all the spots on the field, he knows where everybody’s supposed to be, plays the game extremely fast with a great tempo. Just a great leader.""

- “It’s Drew Brees,"" said Broncos linebacker Shane Ray. “He’s been in the league 15 years. I look at him as one of the legendary quarterbacks. When you think about Peyton [Manning] and [Steelers quarterback] ""Big Ben"" [Roethlisberger] and that group of quarterbacks, he’s right up there, too. The amount of yards that he’s put up passing, everything speaks for itself and who he is.""",2016-11-10 16:19:04+00:00,d9ugz4z,1.0,t3_5c8nvo,126,DenverBroncos

- Both he and Broncos coach Gary Kubiak say the pain remains, but it’s “part of the deal” at Week 10 in the NFL. “He’s sore. He needs this break we got coming next week,” Kubiak said, referring to a bye week that will follow Sunday’s game at New Orleans. “He’s pushed through it. Obviously a good break will help, too. But he’s OK.”

- Siemian practiced fully Wednesday in preparation for Sunday’s game. He said he believes his shoulder is improving, despite the hard hits he has taken. “I feel like I’m getting better,” he said. “I’m not the only one playing with a few dings. It’s just part of the deal.”

- “You can’t argue with the couple big plays (Siemian) makes,” offensive coordinator Rick Dennison said. “Like everybody else, the other 10 that are on the field, it’s a consistency issue. That’ll come with experience. We just need it to happen fast.”

- Improvement is needed across the board, and Siemian, sore or not, is not exempt. “Playing quarterback — any position in the NFL — there’s a lot of pressure,” he said. “But that’s kind of the deal, and you embrace it. (Saints quarterback) Drew Brees is a heck of a player, and he’s going to find a way to score a ton of points. So, not thinking too much on the other side — we know we have a good group over there — but it’s our job to hold up our end of the bargain and score some points and hold onto the ball.”",2016-11-10 16:14:06+00:00,d9ugq8h,1.0,t3_5c8mzi,95,DenverBroncos

- ""That's kind of the job, to search our every opportunity within our means to add talent to the process,"" Bridich said.

- The Broncos running back, one of Denver’s few bright spots in a gloomy 30-20 loss at Oakland on Sunday night, held his first career touchdown ball close to his chest Monday as though he were ready to take on an oncoming linebacker. Bibbs will put the ball in a frame and hang it up in his apartment. It’s now a prized possession. “A Tecmo Bowl run,” one friend texted, referring to the 1980s-era video game.

- Bibbs said he had 200 text messages after his career-best performance, highlighted by his 69-yard touchdown reception on a screen pass on which he made seven defenders miss.

- “That was just a little bit of what they’re about to experience,” said Bibbs, who fulfilled his mother’s early birthday wish with his showing Sunday. “The more I get the ball, the more successful we’ll be. And that’s not me tooting my own horn, I think I’m a home run hitter, and I think I can do that all the time.”

- “Kid’s been working his tail off, doing some good stuff. We want to give him opportunities. He had a big run on a third-and-1 that I’m thinking of,” said Kubiak, referring to Bibbs’ 10-yard rush on a pitch play that led to Jordan Norwood’s 36-yard touchdown reception one play later.  “(Kapri) makes a play, and then I look up and he jumps out there to cover the kick. That’s the kind of players you need, so I’m proud of him. He’s done a good job. He deserves some more (playing time).”

- “I thought it was going to come last year, but it’s now. God won’t let anything happen a second sooner or a second later,” Bibbs said. “When I know a coach trusts in me and believes in me, I don’t want to let them down.”

- “Once you get one run and you don’t get anything until later on in the drive, or the next series, you’re not really into a rhythm,” Booker said. “You’re getting a couple of yards, 4 or 5 yards, and they give you another carry and get 10. You start getting into a rhythm quickly. I wasn’t really able to get into a rhythm just based on how the game was being played.”

- “Those are our two guys here down the stretch,” Kubiak said. “They have to play well, and we have to trust both of them to play.”",2016-11-09 16:58:35+00:00,d9t17fy,1.0,t3_5c27ib,171,DenverBroncos

- Tuesday night, Arenado won another Gold Glove, becoming the first third baseman in major-league history to win four consecutive Gold Gloves to begin his career. The only other third baseman to begin his career with three Gold Gloves in a row was the Red Sox’s Frank Malzone, who won from 1957-59.

- “Yeah, It’s an amazing thing,” Arenado said. “I have worked really hard at my defense. This is something I take a lot of pride in that. I have to thank God that I have been able to stay healthy, for the most part. It’s a good feeling that your hard work pays off.”

- Arenado was the only Rockies player to strike gold. Second baseman DJ LeMahieu was a finalist,  but he lost out to Joe Panik of the San Francisco Giants. LeMahieu, who captured the National League batting crown this season with a .348 average, won a Gold Glove in 2014.

- Slugging right fielder Carlos Gonzalez also was a finalist, hoping to win his fourth Gold Glove, but he was beaten out by the Chicago Cubs’ Jason Heyward. Gonzalez previously won in 2010, 2012 and 2013.

- Arenado’s expertise is illustrated not only by the jaw-dropping plays he makes at third base, but defensive metrics. According to Fangraphs, the runaway National League leader in defensive runs saved with 20. Last month, won his second consecutive Fielding Bible Award, which picks the top player at each position regardless of league. The awards, given by ACTA Sports, were decided by a 12-person panel of experts, who awarded the third baseman all but one first-place vote. 

- “I love playing defense,” Arenado said. “Hitting is just so hard sometimes. But I want to impact the game someway, somehow. So defense is something I take a lot of pride in. I will never forget what Tulo (Troy Tulowitzki) told me. He always said you have to take pride in your defense, because it can change games.”",2016-11-09 03:26:14+00:00,d9s5gf6,1.0,t3_5by0qw,265,ColoradoRockies

**POUNDED ON THE GROUND**

When opponents gash you on the ground, as teams have to the Broncos' defense in recent weeks, it takes a toll on the pride of a unit. That's especially true for a defense that just nine months ago dismantled the explosive Panthers and league MVP Cam Newton in Super Bowl 50 by taking away their ground game first, and doing so flawlessly.

No one in the locker room expected the Broncos to reach Week 9 ranking 29th in rushing yardage allowed per game (128.6), 22nd in yardage per carry (4.40) or allowing more rushing first downs per game than more than nearly two-thirds of the league (6.22 per game, tied for 20th).

""A lot of big plays are short yardage,"" Head Coach Gary Kubiak said. ""We’re gapped out and we think we’re there to make a play. We didn’t tackle well last night. We had a lot of guys in position to make tackles.""

And when those cracks in the run defense lead to chasms through which the Raiders romped for 218 yards and the most possession time against the Broncos in a 60-minute game in at least a quarter-century ... well, that's going to gnaw at the pride of a defense that isn't accustomed to anything resembling its performance Sunday night.

""Yeah, absolutely,"" Crick said. ""But we just didn't execute. And we're a bunch that, when we do execute, we play good football and are good against the run, and we know we're capable of that.""

But any improvement appears likely to come without Derek Wolfe. He received ""encouraging"" news on his elbow injury, but the Broncos appear set to face the Saints without him.

“Everybody just has to do their job a little bit more. Losing Wolfe, that’s going to hurt. We don’t know how long he is going to be out for,"" Crick said. ""He’s a tough guy. He’ll be back before anybody expects.

""Until then, we just have to go out and do our individual jobs. If we can all do that, and do it just a little bit more, we’ll be in good shape.”

**DOES SHORING UP THE RUN DEFENSE MEAN SACRIFICING AGAINST THE PASS?**

It doesn't necessarily have to, but with rare exceptions, fortifying one aspect of defense can mean sacrificing elsewhere -- e.g. using eight men in the box, attacking the run, leaves you vulnerable over the top. The nature of modern football, a product of evolving rules that generally favor the offense, usually means you can't plug every hole in a dam.

Denver's defense was one of those exceptions last year, but that's in the past. So can the Broncos improve their work against the run without creating a vulnerability?

""It's tough to say,"" Marshall said. ""We were really good against the run last year. It's tough to say what might be compromised for us to do better.""

But he and the Broncos know where improvement must start: in the front seven.

""We've just got to be stouter up front,"" he said. ""We've got to get off blocks and make plays.

""Man on man, we've got to make plays, and if we can't, then I think it becomes a tactical issue.""

Added Crick: ""There are a lot of plays where we’re getting double-teamed up front and we’re either losing our footing or not being strong at the point. It’s an easy fix. We just have to practice it.""

**THE SEARCH FOR CONSISTENT PRODUCTION**

In their 27-9 win over Houston two weeks ago, it looked as if the offense had found the consistency it lacked. The Broncos' longest play was 31 yards, but over one-third of their plays (21 of 59, not counting the final-play kneeldown) gained eight or more yards, allowing Denver to gash the Texans repeatedly and set up second- or third-and-short scenarios.

Sunday night, the Broncos averaged more yardage per play (5.9) than they did in that win over Houston (5.8); that pace was the Broncos' best since September. But the Broncos' yardage game in spurts and clumps, including the 69-yard catch and run by Kapri Bibbsthat was more than twice as long as any single gain two weeks earlier.

Against Houston, 35.6 percent of the Broncos' snaps picked up eight or more yards. That dropped to 24.2 percent against San Diego six days later and 23.5 percent in Oakland last night.

The Broncos also sputtered in the first and third quarters Sunday. They averaged 1.0 yards per play in the first quarter and 4.6 yards in the third quarter; those averages were 7.2 in the second quarter and 9.4 in the fourth.

“We have to find some consistency. [That] is what we have to do,"" Kubiak said. ""We ran 50 plays [Sunday] night. Six yards a play, you would think that’s good when you look at football statistics, but the problem is there’s no consistency through the course of the game.

""It’s consistency, staying on the field. You look early in the game, a couple of drops, a couple of things going on that we just have to find a way to stay on the football field. They ran 80 plays—we ran 50 in the game. That doesn’t bode well for your football team.”

**FIRST-DOWN WOES CONTINUE**

The lack of consistency also bore itself out on first downs, which set the Broncos up in long-yardage situations for most of the night.

If you looked only at yardage per play, the Broncos flourished on first downs, racking up 9.94 yards per pass play and 8.35 yards per play overall.

But nine of those 23 first-down plays resulted in either no gain or a loss of yardage. Just 12 of 23 (52.2 percent) saw the Broncos gain more than two yards.

Despite the per-play average, Sunday night's first-down performance was actually much less effective than the Broncos' output against Houston, when they averaged 4.43 fewer yards per first-down pass and 2.28 fewer yards per first-down play, but gained positive yardage on 18 of 23 first-down plays and gained three or more yards on 17 of 28 plays (60.7 percent).

**MORE WORK FOR BIBBS?**

The explosion and open-field shiftiness shown by Kapri Bibbs on his 69-yard journey through Oakland's defense evoked memories of C.J. Anderson's similar jaunt through the Raiders two years ago, and could earn Bibbs a greater share of the workload as he splits time with Devontae Booker while Anderson rehabilitates from knee surgery.

“I think we’re gaining confidence in him,"" Kubiak said. ""Booker is not doing anything wrong. We have to get him some room. He’s got 12 carries for 2.2, so we have to find somebody some room, whoever is in there.

""Kapri came in and made a big play on third and short, made a big run for us. He almost busted that out of there. Those are our two guys here down the stretch. They have to play well and we have to trust both of them to play.""",2016-11-08 17:49:06+00:00,d9rcnq1,1.0,t3_5buoy2,137,DenverBroncos

A $20 donation puts a pair of glasses on a child's face, and on Monday night, Miller and Co. hoped to raise enough money for many, many pairs.

- ""I just feel blessed,"" Miller said. ""I never started out to create all of this. I was trying to help one or two children, and to see Von's Vision's grow -- it's truly a blessing.""

- On the fifth anniversary of the event, Miller made an exciting announcement about what's to come for the foundation in 2017.

127,"Some good stuff from the article:

- In a 30-20 loss at Oakland, Bibbs handled kickoff return duties and had Broncos fans cringing as he routinely took the ball out of the end zone but failed to reach the 25 yard line. On the opening kick of the game he reached only the 14, 11 yards short of where Denver would get the ball if he simply took a knee in the end zone. He did that four times in total in the first half, never reaching the 25. Still, Kubiak had good things to say about his third-year back who has been pressed into service on offense as well as return duties because of the injuries to C.J. Anderson and Cody Latimer.

- “He deserves a shot,” Kubiak said postgame. “Kid’s been working his tail off, doing some good stuff. We want to give him opportunities. He had a big run on a third-and-1 that I’m thinking of. Makes a hell of a play and then I look up and he jumps out there to cover the kick. That’s the kind of players you need on your team, so I’m proud of him. He’s done a good job. He deserves some more.""

- Bibbs had just two carries on the night for 11 yards, including the 10-yard run Kubiak alluded to. Denver ran the ball just 12 times on Sunday for a total of 33 yards. Kubiak knows that will have to change if they hope to change their fortunes. “…we’re playing a brand of football that is throw, throw, throw. Hell, it’s not even fair to [the offensive line] but we’ve got to find a way to run the football somehow some way to help our football team and obviously the last two weeks it has been pretty nonexistent. It’s been tough,” Kubiak said.

- Denver is 2-3 over their past five games, having rushed for an average of 67 yards per game in those losses. Bibbs has just five offensive touches over that span, but his 69-yard touchdown gallop has Kubiak ready to entrust him with more opportunities.

- As for his duties on kickoffs, Bibbs took touchbacks on both of his second-half attempts (although one was kicked out of the end zone). Special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis has said all year that the team views returning kicks out of the end zone as risk/reward. Bibbs’ 69-yard run showed there’s definitely a possible reward to be had. But his four ineffective returns Sunday, not to mention that Denver is so thin at running back, probably don’t make it worth the risk.

- In a tide-changing 30-20 loss to the Oakland Raiders on Sunday night, the Broncos punted more often in the first quarter than they ran the ball. With first-year starting quarterback Trevor Siemian, the Broncos passed three times on their first drive (a three-and-out that gained no yards), passed twice more on their second drive (a three-and-out that lost 3 yards) and passed twice again on their third drive (a three-and-out that gained 7 yards).

- “It’s concerning,” Denver coach Gary Kubiak said.

- Kubiak insists on a heavy dose of passes to begin a game. In their past five games, the Broncos have passed the ball on 67 percent of their opening 15 plays from scrimmage, which does not include punts. They are 2-3 over that stretch. And with Siemian under center, that pass-to-run ratio jumps to 72 percent. Rookie backup quarterback Paxton Lynch threw on seven of his first 15 plays in a loss to Atlanta last month. In three games, Siemian threw on 10 of his first 15 plays, including Sunday at Oakland, and 13-of-15 against the San Diego Chargers in Denver.

- “We have to find a way to stay on the damn football field,” Kubiak said, defending his play-calling.

- Against the Raiders, the Broncos stumbled through their first four possessions without a first down. They rushed for only 23 yards in the first half and 33 yards in the game. Nearly half of their first half total came on one run, Kapri Bibbs’ 10-yard scamper on a third-and-1 play in the second quarter. No. 1 running back Devontae Booker, with only seven carries, gained 13 yards, a 1.9 yard per-carry average.

- “I have to respect the plays that are being called,” Booker said Monday. “We’d like to get in a rhythm (running) early on in the game, but if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.”

- The Broncos have scored only 10 points on their opening possessions, the worst mark in the league among teams that have played nine games. It ranks 22nd overall. In their past five games, the Broncos are averaging five plays from scrimmage on opening drives — good for three points on one Brandon McManus field goal.

- “We definitely want to run the ball more,” Bibbs said.

- “It’s gotten out of whack,” Kubiak said. “We’ve got to find some consistency, is what we have to do. We ran 50 plays (Sunday). We averaged 6.0 yards per play. You’d think that was good if you looked at football statistics. The problem is, there’s no consistency to it through the course of a game.”

154,"My thoughts on the game (from what I saw):

- Playcalling was way to conservative. Success came from the no huddle and Siemian throwing deep. Need to open up the playbook. Get creative. Janovich anyone??

- We had so many penalties, it was so frustrating. While not all were good calls, I think most of them were true. I hate blaming refs though, so we really shot ourselves in the foot. Still though so many teams get away with holding calls on Von every fucking week.

- Secondary was trash tonight except for T.J. Ward. Harris and Roby both just looked a step behind and couldn't tackle worth a shit (especially Roby). Coverage was just bad...really really miss Talib and Webster (Webster because he at least has some experience. Doss and Nixon looked fucking lost our there)

- Run defense is non-existent. They ran for 221 yards tonight. Wolfe going out hurt but even with him in, it sucked. The Raiders line is great and beat the shit out of us all night. Todd Davis had an awful game. Crick, Sly, Gotsis I mean where the fuck are you guys? Marshall isn't healthy either.

- McManus for president

- Offensive line might be the worst in the league. I have no words. Can't expect Siemian to succeed with that line and in turn lack of a running game.

- Lastly, the raiders just showed up and played well. Give them credit. I give credit to that line, Carr played well, and their linebackers were all over the place. No energy tonight from the Broncos, they didn't deserve to win this game. Let me know what you think, again I didn't see the game in its entirety and I am a bit annoyed so that may cloud some reason or logic of mine. Whatever, fuck the raiders.

161,"His full statement: 

&gt;For the 1st half of the season, I’ve been taking a knee for the National Anthem to raise awareness for social injustice and to start conversation about what all of us can do to make a positive change. I’m encouraged with the many productive discussions and progress that has taken place as the Denver Police department has decided to review its use of force policy. I’m proud to have joined so many of my peers throughout sports who’ve also made their own statements. 
Going forward, I will be standing for the National Anthem—not because everything is perfect, or because I'm changing my stance on things. But because of my hope for what we can become. Just because I am standing doesn't mean the work will end. There’s much work to be done. I’ll continue to recognize and support organizations that are stepping up as leaders and making a real difference in our community, and I will do my part to be there for those in need.  One of those organizations is the Idriss Stelley Foundation, a grassroots organization in the Bay Area that offer free support to victims of police violence. I’ll be standing for them and the family of the late O’Shaine Evans—on Sunday night in addition to making a donation from my Tackle Change program to further the meaningful work of this group. 
I really appreciate the support from my family, teammates, coaches and fans. I’m grateful for those who have taken the time to hear me out. 
I’m excited for what all of us can accomplish when we truly work together.

179,"Some good stuff from the article:

- Devontae Booker knew it. He knew it the second he felt the ball slipping from his right hand as he tried to stretch for a touchdown on Sunday. ""I knew right then it was going to be an issue; we can't have it,"" Booker said. ""You can't do that right then, right there. I knew it, and I knew Coach E [running backs coach Eric Studesville] kind of wanted to make sure I knew.""

- In the next emotion-filled moments, Studesville was into Booker's personal space with a verbal barrage in the wake of a turnover. It was all there for everyone to see: coach and player in a lava-tempered moment, similar to what would take place of any sideline in the league. But what comes before and after such a scenario determines if it is a teaching moment.

- ""There is intensity, you let that happen; then what I try to do is remove myself from the situation immediately,"" Studesville said. ""I get some separation, I walk away, I've got to go to the other end [of the bench], because I know me: If I don't, I'll keep picking at it, I'll keep poking at it. And that gives him a little time to process it too. Then it's a maturity process from both of us to just address what needs to happen, how we fix it and make the adjustments. And then leave them with something positive -- 'I know what you're about'-- and then we fix it.""

- ""Right then, E is chewing me out -- it's something I knew I shouldn't have done at that point,"" Booker said. ""I don't take it personally at all; I know what Coach E is about, I'm with him every day. It's heat of the moment, coaches have the words, but you know you have to continue to play ball. And they come back to you.""

- If a coach is to be more than a screamer to a player, there has to have been a foundation built before the blowups so that the repair can be made. ""For a dropped pass, for instance, 80,000 people in the stands saw you drop the ball, millions of people on the TV saw you drop the ball -- for me I leave it alone right then,"" said Denver wide receivers coach Tyke Tolbert. "" ... Yelling, MF-ing, GD-ing you, all that, everybody's different in how they handle that. My thought is ... everybody in America saw you drop the ball, that's not the moment. Anything you say in that moment is going to be lost. I let them cool down for a little bit, then I look at pictures, then I go over and we address it.""

- Cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said ""it's about how you go through an offseason and meetings"" with the coach. With that in mind, the players understand the emotion of the game -- and that the bench area is almost ground zero. But if the players believe coaches are helping them to get better, challenging them and treating them with respect, they can sift through the harshest of words.

- For Denver secondary coach Joe Woods, he has a group of veteran starters in his meeting room that includes three players -- Harris, Ward and Aqib Talib and -- who have each played in a Pro Bowl. And, as Ward has said, the group ""prepares hard, we know the game, we know what we're supposed to do.""

- ""Don't create panic,"" Woods said. ""Let's fix problems. Whether you're screaming at them or not, we still have to fix problems. What happened? So they can explain to me what happened to them on the field, that's the first piece of information. Then I talk to the coaches upstairs, look at the pictures, let [the player] calm down, and then go over it: 'This is what you saw, this is what actually happened, here's how we're going to fix it,' that's how I have to handle it.""

- ""The thing to probably put that behind is to go back out there and make a play that's big and matters,"" Booker said. ""We had a crucial third-and-1 after, and you make a play.""

- Studesville offered an additional explanation. ""How you set the expectations way back in the spring kind of determines how constructive everybody can be in those heated moments,"" Studesville said. ""If I didn't cover it, if I didn't talk about it, if I wasn't clear, then that's my fault. We always want to be in a position where we are preparing them to do things at critical times.""

Some good stuff from the article:

- Lorenzo Doss sees you looking at him. Doss knows you’re going after him. “Definitely. If he’s going to do it, he’s welcome to try,’’ Doss said. “I’m going to be in position to make the plays.’’

- Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak said Talib was injected with a shot in his lower back Friday. Kubiak didn’t say exactly where or why the shot was administered but shots in the lower back area are almost always used to calm nerves around a troublesome disc. Broncos pass-rushing linebacker DeMarcus Ware missed several games last season because of a similar problem.

- “Let it calm down over the weekend,’’ Kubiak said. “He’s doing well, so we feel good moving forward.’’

- Talib will be replaced at starting left corner by Bradley Roby, who had been playing in more than 50 percent of the defensive snaps, anyway, as the Broncos’ No. 3 corner. Chris Harris Jr. becomes key when the Broncos use their nickel package. The starting right corner often slides inside to cover the slot – in part because it’s easier for him to quarterback the secondary from inside than the outside corner position.

- If Kayvon Webster is healthy enough to play he would be the No. 3 corner – and play outside in the nickel package. But Webster yanked his right hamstring early last week against San Diego and didn’t return.

- Webster, linebacker Brandon Marshall and center Matt Paradis are listed as questionable for the game Sunday at Oakland. Put Marshall and Paradis on the probable side of questionable and Webster on the doubtful side.

- Doss was targeted by San Diego quarterback Philip Rivers last week. “To no avail,’’ said Doss, who lined both inside in the slot area, and outside. “It’s what my teammates expect out of me. If you keep trying me I’m going to make a play. That’s my mentality.’’

- “I agree they have more weapons,’’ Doss said of the Raiders. “But we have ballers over here. This No Fly Zone is a different breed. You can tell by last week, Roby got defensive player of the week.’’

- “It’s a big game,’’ Doss said. “I have to just do my job and make plays I’m expected to make.’’",2016-11-05 16:06:12+00:00,d9mynmo,1.0,t3_5bal6i,190,DenverBroncos

- The back injury that prevented cornerback Aqib Talib from playing last week could prevent him from facing the Oakland Raiders. Talib, 30, missed practice Wednesday, and is inching toward a game-time decision. Talib is expected to get more info on his injury to create a road map going forward. Talib thought he would play against the Chargers, but woke up Saturday sore and unable to go, pushing Bradley Roby into the starting lineup.

- Center Matt Paradis, who told Denver7 he believes he will play and wants to work out at least once this week, watched practice along with left tackle Russell Okung (likely rest day). And linebacker Brandon Marshall (hamstring) and Devontae Booker (shoulder) made progress, practicing Thursday. 

- “They’re a pair of good receivers just like a lot of the receivers we’ve played this year. They’re no slouches, no slacking. I look forward to another game where there are some competitive guys out there,"" Roby said. ""Every team is going to have good receivers in this league. It’s the NFL. No game is a break. I don’t really get too personal when I watch film. I don’t refer to guys by their names. I refer to them by their numbers. It helps me just not listen to what media says about people. It’s what I’m seeing on the field from these guys that’s the truth, that’s how I separate who’s good and who’s elite. It doesn’t matter. It’s just whatever you’re doing on tape.”

216,"Some good stuff from the article:

**Corey Nelson**

- The signal-caller role might be the most important for the cohesiveness of the Broncos’ defense. It’s how the Broncos’ coaches communicate to a player via radio in his helmet. It’s a responsibility this season usually reserved for Broncos inside linebacker Brandon Marshall, but Sunday third-year linebacker Corey Nelson made his first career start in place of Marshall, who was injured.

- “Corey did a really good job,” Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. “The situation he got put in, and still playing special teams, I’m really proud of Corey.”

- Nelson played 77 of 81 defensive snaps. He finished with five tackles and broke up a pass. He often was the Broncos’ lone linebacker in “dime” coverage and he did well when he was isolated on pass plays.

- Even through his strong performance when the Broncos needed it the most, Nelson wasn’t basking in the praise, but seeking to improve. “It definitely builds a lot of confidence off of this game,”  he said. “It definitely builds a lot of trust as well. It’s a huge boost for me.”

**Lorenzo Doss**

- It wasn’t until Sunday morning, just a few hours before the Broncos’ rematch with the Chargers, that Broncos fifth cornerback Lorenzo Doss was told he would be active for the second time this season. Aqib Talib was a late scratch because of a back injury, A first-quarter hamstring injury to Kayvon Webster forced Doss to be the third cornerback for much of the game.

- Doss’ defining moment came on fourth down late in the fourth quarter when he broke up a would-be touchdown pass intended for 6-foot-5, 250-pound Chargers tight end Hunter Henry.

- “It started before that. It started in the meetings,” Doss said. “I just read his route, and I made the play on it. The team expects that from me. They expect me to make plays. I prepare like I’m a starter.”

- Doss deserves an assist on safety Darian Stewart’s third-quarter interception, a pass Doss deflected. He played a career-high 40 defensive plays, or 49 percent.

- “This has gotta be a big game in Doss’ career,” Kubiak said. “There are moments in your career where you come in and gain confidence that you can do something. He got put on the spot and made some really big plays, so I’m looking for him to build off of that.”

**Will Parks**

- On a goal-line stand late in the fourth quarter, the Broncos depended on the rookie Parks to defend Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers’ most trusted red zone target, tight end Antonio Gates, on three consecutive plays. On second and third down, Gates was Rivers’ primary receiver before the play was halted by Parks.

- A third-and-goal play from the Broncos’ 2-yard line, with the Chargers down eight points, might have been Parks’ best moment of the season. Gates ran a corner route and had a step on Parks. The 6-foot, 194-pound safety made up the ground and knocked down Gates’ left arm just as the ball was arriving to force an incomplete pass.

- “I knew they were coming for me,” Parks said. “You gonna make a play or you gonna fail. And I can’t fail.”

- Parks was the Broncos’ final of three defensive draft picks selected late in the sixth round of April’s draft, but he’s made the biggest impact of them all. Parks has emerged as the Broncos’ third safety.",2016-11-02 17:44:44+00:00,d9inbca,1.0,t3_5arby4,188,DenverBroncos

**Most likely to defend the pass**

Lowest passer rating allowed when thrown at: **Aqib Talib**, CB, Denver Broncos, 37.0

Single-season record: Asante Samuel, CB, Philadelphia Eagles, 31.7 (2010)

Aqib Talib has been pretty shutdown so far this season. He has yet to allow a touchdown catch when targeted, and is yielding a passer rating of 37.0 when QBs throw the ball into his coverage. To put that into perspective, that’s better than the passer rating QBs would have if they just threw the ball into the dirt every play. It isn’t quite the record over a single-season, however. Darrelle Revis’ mind-blowing 2009 season has it beat, but the record since 2006 is held by Asante Samuel from his 2010 season with the Eagles. That year, Samuel allowed just 19 catches and 141 yards, picking off seven passes from just 41 targets.

**Most likely to haul it in**

Lowest drop rate: **Emmanuel Sanders**, WR, Denver Broncos, 0.0 percent

Single-season record: Jason Witten, TE, Dallas Cowboys, 0.0 percent (2015)

Multiple receivers have yet to drop a pass this season, but Emmanuel Sanders has caught the most among that group by a clear five receptions. Jason Witten holds the record for the most receptions over a season without a dropped pass, with 77 catches in 2015 and no drops to his name. Todd Heap had 73 catches with the Ravens in 2006 without a drop, which is the second-best rate over a season. Sanders is currently on pace to eclipse the reception totals of the TE pairing, and would hit 88 receptions without a drop if he can maintain his perfect performance over the second half of the year. If he drops one, he would need to hit that 88-reception mark to hold the best drop rate among receivers with a single drop over a season, edging out Jeremy Maclin from a year ago, who dropped just one pass and caught 87.",2016-11-01 16:06:32+00:00,d9gyjpv,1.0,t3_5ajrgr,1553,DenverBroncos

It heightens my senses a little bit and played a little bit harder.’’

- In all, Ware played 26 snaps on defense, mostly on third downs. That was the case until there were 2 minutes, 54 seconds left in the game and the Chargers were driving, while the Broncos were protecting that eight-point lead.

- On a 7-yard completion from Philip Rivers to tight end Hunter Henrythat moved the ball to the Broncos’ 2-yard line, Ware was whistled for being in the neutral zone. The penalty was declined by the Chargers, but it was still a call that, shall we say, Ware slightly disagreed with, and he let referee Tony Corrente know about it. He then -- uncharacteristically -- got in a heated exchange with Rivers before the next play.

- “I am only supposed to play third down, and there was a couple plays guys started talking trash and I was like, ‘Well, then I guess I need to stay out here and take the trash out’,’’ Ware said. “That’s how I felt. I stayed out there a couple plays, and we were able to get a big stop on the goal line.’’

- “My arm felt really good,’’ Ware said. “I think I just have to get used to doing a lot of my power moves again, getting my strength back. From a pain standpoint, it felt really good.’’

- “It was great,’’ said Broncos linebacker Von Miller. “He has a legendary presence when he’s on the football field. He was all over the place [Sunday], and just looking at him, you wouldn’t think that he took off so many weeks … He’s a legendary player. He’s a living legend for us, and I’m just truly blessed to have him on our team.’’

- “Sometimes you don’t need that extra motivation when you know what is at stake,’’ Ware said. “If you want to be the best, you have to beat the best. This team [Oakland Raiders] right now is in the way. They are a great team and have been playing really well the whole season.

- “We try to continue to have trust in them and trust that they’re going to finish the game and do their job,” Broncos cornerback Chris Harris said. “It’s tough sometimes. That’s what, for me, the leaders on this team, we have to keep everybody calm whenever something on the other side of the ball goes wrong.”

- “When the defense gives us a turnover, we have to score,” Thompson said. “There are no ifs, ands or buts. We have to find a way to get a touchdown or get three points.”

- The Broncos, meanwhile, never hit stride. They rushed just seven times in the first half. Booker finished with 19 carries for 54 yards and a fumble. Kapri Bibbs added four yards on two carries. Thompson added a yard and Trevor Siemian lost two yards. They totaled 57 yards rushing — less than half the Chargers’ total of 123.

- “C.J. is out. We have to get used to that feeling,” Bibbs said. “Of course we have to be ready for next week. We have to get better and better.”",2016-10-31 04:31:32+00:00,d9eyqsn,1.0,t3_5aafoz,112,DenverBroncos
253,"The notes of note:

- On Saturday, the Broncos and Talib were going back and forth on whether he could play. Saturday was also when the Broncos decided Ware would play.

- ""He practiced Friday, it was a good day,'' Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak said of Talib. ""He came back and it tightened up on him Saturday. We took a look at him this morning and just felt like we had to do the smart thing. We're hoping he's back this week.''

- Talib is dealing with a disc issue, sources told 9NEWS. He does not need surgery now, although that could be an option after the season.

- Ward’s sack of Rivers in the first quarter gave him at least one in each of the past six seasons – the only NFL defensive back to have such a run.

- Ward was the Broncos' leading tackler for a second consecutive game. He had 10, plus a sack, an interception, a pass deflection and two quarterback hits. Ward and Wesley Woodyard (2012) are the only Bronco players to have 10 tackles, a sack and an interception in the same game since 1994.

- Kubiak gave linebackers coach Reggie Herring the game ball for filling in as defensive play-caller when coordinator Wade Phillips left the game in the second quarter following a sideline collision. ""When it happened, I got on the headset a couple of times and he told me to shut the hell up and get off the headset,'' Kubiak said.",2016-10-31 03:58:40+00:00,d9exl9a,1.0,t3_5aaarm,150,DenverBroncos
254,"Some good stuff from the article:

- “I’m just a smarter player. I’m at the peak of my career. I’m just playing really well,” Ward said. “It’s funny because early in the season I didn’t think so. When you try to force things, it’ll backfire. I didn’t feel like I was making enough splash plays. But it happens like that. I stayed patient, and it’s all coming now.”

- “Like a Tasmanian Devil, that’s what I call him. I call him Taz,” cornerback Chris Harris said. “He’s acting crazy on the field, so sometimes I have to calm him down a little bit. That’s the type of fire we need.”

- Safety Darian Stewart, who also had an interception, had a similar description: “Dog, relentless, and just an aggressive player.”

- “The thing T.J. has done, that nobody understands, he really had to change his role. When we lost (safety Justin) Simmons, we had some things going on,” Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. “T.J. is a guy that had to play a lot of different spots. You ask certain guys to do special things and he is a special player. T.J. is a big leader. I’m really proud of him.”

- “He’s been more than a mentor. He’s been like a big brother to me,” Parks said. “It’s not even just on the field, it’s off the field, too. He’s always inviting me places, putting me around the right people when he don’t really got to. That relationship is huge.”

- “When I come home I say, everybody eats. And everybody ate today,” Ward said. “When you have three interceptions, one for a touchdown, it’s hard to lose.”",2016-10-31 02:55:39+00:00,d9euxzr,1.0,t3_5aa1by,103,DenverBroncos

&gt;While Richardson no longer gets to the QB as often as he used to -- he has just 1.5 sacks in seven games -- he claims his diverse skill set and willingness to play in coverage will pay off in the long run.

&gt;""I think it'll give me more money. Just to be honest,"" Richardson said Friday, per the New York Daily News. ""My film don't lie. You took a three-technique that was drafted in the first round and put him at outside linebacker and he held his own, that's just building up a resume for that."" 

&gt;""I'm good at everything, I'm great at three-technique,"" Richardson added. ""I'm gonna just leave it at that. I know where my home is and I know I'm more effective at three-technique, but I hold my own playing anywhere in the box.""",2016-10-30 06:19:38+00:00,d9dp3es,1.0,t3_5a4te4,885,nfl

297,"The notes of note:

- Barring an overnight cure of his strained hamstring, Brandon Marshall is expected to be replaced by Corey Nelson as a Denver Broncos’ starting inside linebacker for their game Sunday against the San Diego Chargers. Besides Nelson, Marshall’s injury could also mean more playing time for Zaire Anderson.

- “If it happens, I’m definitely excited,’’ Nelson said. “But each week is an opportunity for me. Because you never know what happens. One play away. It’s a big week, though. It’s a big game. A division game. Our coach says it counts as two games.’’ Win and the Broncos are 6-2, three games ahead of the Chargers, who would be 3-5 in the AFC West Division. Lose and the Broncos are 5-3, one game ahead of what would be 4-4 San Diego. Thus, the two-game swing.

- Nelson has the speed to stay with the likes of San Diego tight end Hunter Henry. How fast is Nelson? He’s the fastest linebacker on the team. “Inside linebacker, I probably am,’’ Nelson said. “Outside linebacker it would probably be Dekoda (Watson). He’s fast.’’

- Asked if he’s faster than Von Miller, Nelson took a deep breath while considering. “Not in the get off,’’ he said, smiling.

- The Broncos are a little more hopeful Matt Paradis can play, even though the center missed the entire week of practice with a hip injury. The Broncos’ backup center is James Ferentz, who spent the week snapping to quarterback Trevor Siemian and orchestrating the offensive line in practice.

- Put Talib on the probable side of questionable and Ware on the doubtful side. Sitting out the Chargers’ game would give Ware six full weeks off from when he suffered his fracture, and it would be almost seven weeks until the Broncos’ next game next Sunday night at Oakland. It takes six weeks to heal a broken bone. Ware practiced with a protective cast around his right forearm this week.",2016-10-29 22:22:07+00:00,d9d92yw,1.0,t3_5a2yp7,264,DenverBroncos

- Anderson told Denver7 on Friday, he will wait to hear from the team Friday before knowing his next step. He admitted he has no timetable in his recovery. It has been a dizzying five days for Anderson, who proved again his toughness and dedication to the team with Monday's performance on a compromised leg. 

- ""The doctor couldn't believe I played on it,"" Anderson told Denver7. ""Usually he said when people feel that, they are out."" 

- Of course, Anderson asked about avoiding surgery and continuing to play on the injured knee based on Monday's performance. However, the doctors told him he could risk more serious injury.

- Running back C.J. Anderson is currently seeking a second medical opinion on a right knee injury suffered during the game Monday night against the Houston Texans.

- There is hope the injury could be minor in nature, although it’s also possible he could miss an extended period. Either way, the Broncos may be without their starting running back and leading rusher against the Chargers.

- On the final play of the first quarter Monday night, Anderson cut right during an 11-yard gain and after he was tackled he wound up staying down and clutching his knee, even though there wasn’t contact in the knee area. Impressively, Anderson played three more quarters on that damaged knee, gaining 84 more yards on 14 more carries. He finished with 107 yards on 16 carries and a touchdown in the Broncos’ 27-9 win against Houston on Monday night.

- If Anderson misses the game against the Chargers, the Broncos would be expected to start rookie tailback Devontae Booker, who rushed for 83 yards on 17 carries Monday night against Houston. No. 3 running back Kapri Bibbs, who has primarily been playing on special teams, could also get promoted to No. 2 back this week. The team could also promote Juwan Thompson from the practice squad, or acquire a running back for depth.

342,"NFL head of officiating Dean Blandino said on NFL Network that Landry wasn’t ejected because the officials can’t say for sure that Landry was specifically aiming for Williams’ head, as opposed to just making a block and going too high.

“It’s certainly a foul,” Blandino said. “It’s certainly something that we’ll review for potential discipline, but it’s still a football play, and it’s tough to read intent there. That’s why the officials kept him in the game. It’s not an automatic ejection. It’s up to the discretion of the crew and they didn’t feel like it was flagrant enough to throw the player out of the game.”

In college football, a hit like that would be an automatic targeting ejection. In the NFL, there are fewer plays that result in automatic ejections.

“We have very few automatic ejections in the game today,” Blandino said. “If you get two unsportsmanlike conduct fouls in the same game, if you put your hands on a game official in an aggressive way, those are automatic ejections. Punching an opponent.”

344,"This is a fantastic read. Some of the good stuff:

- The Broncos employ two unheralded assistant coaches whose job descriptions are a closely-held secret. It boils down to this: Find the tells. Does a certain offensive tackle divulge run or pass with the placement of his feet? Or does a quarterback tip a play with a simple hand gesture? If so, Kubiak would like his players to know about it.

- “When the center points, or the quarterback says something, they’re telling you everything, so why not use it?” Ware says incredulously. “Every team should do it; the Dallas coaches would say, ‘You can't go off of somebody’s tendencies.’ And I would say, ‘Well, this guy on the other team has been doing this one thing for nine years and he hasn’t stopped doing it.’ I had that argument with coaches. In the end, I said okay, I guess I’ll be the only one to use it then.”

- Then Ware signed with the Broncos in 2014, and then the team hired coach Gary Kubiak in 2015. Kubiak and Ware could not have been more aligned in their thinking. Kubiak hired two coaching interns that year—ex-Hawaii assistant Philip Rauscher and former Bills quality control coach Thaddeus Bogardus. Their job? Tendencies. But not just the broad offensive and defensive tendencies being coached everywhere. Rauscher and Bogardus have a special mandate to also study the bad habits of opposing players, and both coaches have the unique privilege of briefing the offense and the defense, respectively, on those habits.

- Bogardus and Rauscher pore over hours and hours of film, and not just the silent, All-22 copies of games; they’ll break down the television broadcast, hoping an on-field microphone catches an audible call or a piece of defensive communication they can then catalog and use to discern patterns. They do the same with hand signals shared between quarterback and wide receiver or cornerback and safety. Then both coaches prepare briefings for position coaches and lead a weekly meeting with the offense and defense to point out the smallest bad habits.

- “A defensive lineman might tilt in his stance when he’s going inside, or communicate a certain way when it’s a twist.” —Offensive tackle Donald Stephenson

- “Stances, code words, how a quarterback holds his hands or bends his knees, a center’s heels.”  —Outside linebacker Shane Ray

- “How does a cornerback stand on any given playcall? Is he flat-footed or on the balls of his feet? Where are his hands?” —Wide receiver Jordan Norwood

- “If this one guy has his right hand down, he’s going this way, or he has his left hand down he’s going this way.” —Tight end Virgil Green

347,"If you can't open the article: 

As the 2011 lockout was coming to a conclusion, the owners made a series of concessions that cost them no money, at least not directly. Five years later, a real question has emerged regarding whether diminished practice time is resulting in a diminished product on Sundays (and Mondays, and now every Thursday) and, in turn, diminished ratings.

Plenty of coaches and General Managers insist that the reduction in practice time and intensity has harmed the sport, resulting in subpar offensive line play, poor fundamentals (like tackling), and bodies that aren’t “hardened” by fully-padded two-a-days and are more in-season practices in pads.

Others disagree, pointing to the immediate impact of a player like Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa as proof that full participation in the offseason program, training camp, and the preseason is overrated. Still, it’s one thing for a guy like Bosa to rush the quarterback; it’s another for a player to move in concert with other players, like offensive lineman and quarterbacks/pass-catchers do.

Last week, Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged that the practice rules should be re-evaluated in conjunction with the next round of Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations. But Goodell prefaced those remarks but suggesting that everything is fine as it is.

“I just spoke to John Madden on Monday night for an hour,” Goodell said last Wednesday regarding the perception of reduced quality of offensive line play. “I had this conversation with him and actually made exactly the opposite point: That offensive line play looks better, and he agreed. And so I don’t see that. When you have either injuries or inconsistency on the front line, that’s a cohesive group, and when one person is missing that’s a difficult thing, and so that group does need time to gel. That often gets better as the season goes along.”

That wagon-circling/all-is-well mindset won’t help the NFL solve its current problems. The league needs to be honest with itself and everyone else (more importantly with itself) about the fact that fewer people are watching, or that the same people are watching less fervently.

Instead, the league seems to be tempted to adopt a position of inaction, hunkering down and treating the lost ratings points the same way Homer Simpson reacted to the first globs of hair that fell out of his head — by shrugging and saying, “Well, there’s still plenty more where those came from.”",2016-10-26 01:14:42+00:00,d97vobt,1.0,t3_59etsv,26,nfl

But we don’t pay attention to outside noise. We know it can be very fickle. We just stay true to our room. Clancy does a good job keeping us humble and teaching us to work hard.’’

- The offensive line took the brunt of the blame for that defeat (against San Diego) “For sure. That’s not who we are,’’ said left guard Max Garcia. “That was embarrassing for us. We hated putting that on tape and not executing like that. We wanted to get the bad taste out of our mouths and the only way we were going to do that is if we went and got it. If we went in there and approached the game like it was ours. And we had to take it, it wasn’t going to be given to us because they’ve got a good front. We just had to be resilient and bounce back.’’

- From that nightmare came an offensive line’s dream game. In a 27-9 win against Houston on Monday night, the Broncos’ offensive line helped spring running backs C.J.

382,"Some good stuff from the article: 

- The Denver Broncos’ all-time sack leader with 97.5, Fletcher never missed one of the 172 games the Denver Broncos played (not including the three replacement player games in 1987) during his 11-year career from 1985-95.

- “Simon was basically Von Miller of his day,’’ said Karl Mecklenburg, Fletcher’s pass-rushing teammate. “He was just faster around the corner than the tackle could get back. He would come around the corner and just beat guys. The other thing about him was he was so consistent with it. Everyone else would wear down at the end of the game and that’s when he would make his plays. Everyone would wear down at the end of the season – I mean if you looked back at his statistics, I would guess two thirds of his sacks were in the last third of the season. He was still going full blast while everyone else was nicked up from the season. That’s why he didn’t make any Pro Bowls. He was kind of middle of the pack in sacks until the end of the year when he would blow by everybody but it was too late for the Pro Bowl voting.""

- “From the time that I sat on that stage, my eyes were focused on my mother,’’ Fletcher said following the ceremony to unveil his pillar that is now among the 31 in the Broncos’ Ring of Fame Plaza. “Some of the (nice) things that they said about me, she may have heard them before, but to hear somebody say it in this form, she was filled with joy. I’m also feeling gracious and gratitude to the guys that I was forced and blessed to play with. If your DBs aren’t covering, if your front three aren’t getting pushed, then you’ll never get a quarterback sack. The guys opposite of you, whether it’s Rulon Jones, Barney Chavous, Karl Mecklenburg, if they’re not containing, you never get one sack because the guy just runs out of the pocket. They were talking about Simon Fletcher, John and Jason, but the three of us know that there are literally hundreds of guys who had to contribute to our being here this evening.”

- Fletcher’s 97.5 sacks are a whopping 18.5 better than Mecklenburg’s runner-up total of 79.0, and it’s a team record that has held up through the 21 years since he retired. But Fletcher figures it’s a matter of time before he has to surrender the record. Von Miller is charging fast from the No. 3 position. Miller has 67.5 sacks in only 5 ½ seasons and he’s under contract for another 5 ½ seasons with the team.

- “He is, in my mind, the Broncos best pass rusher ever and if he can stay healthy and keep doing what he’s doing, sooner or later Von Miller is going to prove me right,’’ Fletcher said. “Then, that will be the happiest day of my life besides today because records are meant to be broken.’’

- “If Simon could tackle he’d have had 125 sacks,’’ Mecklenburg said. “He lost more sacks to me. He would come in and disrupt everything all the time. He had these long strides that were 3 ½ yards long. On the pass rush, he’d get around that corner so fast it would be hard for him to break down and get the quarterback.’’

- “Clearly, the fact that I played in every game, that I never had to close my eyes and put on a blindfold and go to the pay window,’’ Fletcher said. “I was paid to play in a set number of games. I showed up to every single one. Being from where I grew up, my grandparents right in the area around me, that is who they are and that is who they tried to instill the right values in to make me. It was my job to be there every play.”",2016-10-24 15:51:31+00:00,d95p8di,1.0,t3_5957pc,201,DenverBroncos

393,"Some good stuff from the article: 

- Denver has spiraled from fourth in rushing to 19th overall. Central to the problem is the start of drives. The Broncos average 4.71 yards on first down, which ranks fourth worst in the NFL. Anything less than 5 yards per attempt is considered dismal. It has led to too few plays. And too many third-and-longs.

- ""I wish I knew the answer. We were really good on first down for about three weeks. Now of all of sudden we are near the bottom,"" said coach Gary Kubiak, who put his team in pads on Wednesday and held a long, productive workout on Friday. ""That's a big down in this league. If you aren't doing well, you are probably not making a lot of third downs. If you are not getting first downs and staying on the field, then things get out of whack.""

- ""We have to make plays. There are no excuses,"" running back C.J. Anderson said.

- The Broncos inability to run has left opponents playing their safeties deep, taking away vertical routes. As a result, Denver is left dipping and dunking more than customers at Winchell's. ""We need better effort from the players and coaches,"" Dennison said.

- The Broncos figure to tweak their running game this week. Some outside plays could enter into the mix, and look for rookie Devontae Booker to receive additional reps after a strong showing at San Diego.

- “Chris Harris is the most underrated player in the league. He and Talib are a great duo,” Gruden said. “There’s a commitment to playing sticky, bump-and-run man coverage out there. And it’s worked out great.” Gruden drafted and coached Talib during his rookie season in Tampa Bay (2008). He raved about Talib’s physicality, length and instincts.

- Gruden said this game likely will be decided by which offensive line handles pressure the best. He pointed to Miller vs. Texans right tackle Derek Newton as a key matchup.

- As far as the emotions, Gruden recalled his own mixed feelings when facing his former team. “I remember getting traded by Oakland and it bothered me,” Gruden said. “You want to go out and kick their butts if you can.

- “The scan that we got back was excellent,’’ Kubiak said after practice Thursday. “I think before the week’s out he’ll be doing some things on the field. He’s making good progress.’’

- Following the surgery Kubiak said he hoped Ware’s recovery would be somewhere between four and six weeks. Monday night’s game against the Texans will be five weeks to the day from his surgery and the Broncos’ Oct. 30 game against the San Diego Chargers would be the six-week mark.

- For only the third time in Broncos history, two quarterbacks drafted by the team will go head to head as starters Monday night. The previous two times quarterbacks drafted by the Broncos met in a Denver game, the Broncos were victorious; Jay Cutler defeated Brian Griese and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2008, and Osweiler defeated Cutler and the Chicago Bears in 2015. The hope for Siemian is that he can follow suit. But the quarterback reunion isn’t the focus for his week.

- “I feel good,” Siemian said. “I feel like I made some strides over the last couple of days. Good to get some time off, too. Getting better every day.” The visible bruising and much of his pain has subsided and he was a full participant in practice Thursday.

- “I think he’s been much better,” coach Gary Kubiaksaid. “Obviously last week when he played in the game he was still somewhat sore. To me, watching him turn a few balls loose, he didn’t rotate the way he normally does, but he’s had some good time on his hands. It’s been a week now since that game, so you can see a difference. We knew it was going to take a little time for him to get back to himself.""

- Kubiak said he believes Monday’s game against Houston will present the toughest defensive challenge the Broncos have faced this season. The Texans rank No. 2 in the NFL against the pass (189.3 net yards allowed per game), but 29th against the run (126.3 yards). They also have forced opponents to make 40 negative plays this season, tied for seventh.

- “They’ve been making people do a lot of negative stuff,” Kubiak said. “So we got to be on top of our stuff and make sure we protect our quarterback.”",2016-10-21 16:27:49+00:00,d91xe12,1.0,t3_58o4ac,147,DenverBroncos

- “Any coach, any team in the NFL, if they had Peyton Manning healthy and ready to play I think we all know who is going to play in the game,” Osweiler said. “That had nothing whatsoever to do with my decision.”

- Instead, Osweiler pointed to playing for the Texans and coach Bill O’Brien’s quarterback-friendly system as a key factor in leaving. He said he played well in coach Kubiak’s system, but he felt like Houston’s system was a better fit for his skill set and gave him an opportunity to excel for a long time in the NFL.

- “Denver had the opportunity to extend an offer,” Osweiler said. “In fact, they had a great, very long period of time to extend an offer.”

- Osweiler pointed to conversations with his family, former coaches and people across the NFL that helped him make his decision to leave Denver, but ultimately he made the final choice.

- He showered general manager John Elway and Kubiak with praise for their treatment of him during his time in Denver. Osweiler said he and Elway chatted for a few minutes this summer in Idaho and they had a great relationship. He also mentioned that he reached out to Kubiak last week when he heard he was sick and the Broncos coach wished him the best.

- Kelvin Benjamin, T.Y. Hilton, A.J. Green, Mike Evans and Julio Jones have already lined up across from Broncos defenders. Jones leads the league in receiving yards, Green is third, Hilton is sixth and Evans is 12th. And Benjamin is among those with four receiving touchdowns, which is the second-highest total in the league.

- “So, yeah, man, every week we get one of those guys,"" Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib said. “I don’t know if they sat down and said, 'Let’s get them all of those receivers in a row.' But they did and now another one.""

- Next is the Texans’ DeAndre Hopkins. While Hopkins, whose 31 catches have him among the league's top 15 in that category, has not quite meshed with quarterback Brock Osweiler for the kind of production he had last season with four different Texans quarterback throwing him the ball, the Broncos still see Hopkins as another wideout who has to be at the top of their defensive to-do list.

- “He’s tough,"" Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. “He’s quick, knows where to get to, and when the ball is in the air, man, he can get it even if you’re in the right spot. You have to be on your game and you can’t show him the same thing over and over. You have to bring something different.""

- After six games last season, Hopkins had 52 receptions and four 100-yard receiving games on the way to 111 catches, 1,521 yards and 11 touchdowns. This time around, as Osweiler tries to find a comfort zone in his first season in Houston's offense, Hopkins has 31 catches, one 100-yard game and three touchdowns.

- “I think we make it tough,"" Harris said. “We take pride in it, but we know what those guys can do.""

- “All those guys can the ball, man,"" Talib said. “You give them any room at all, they’re going to get their catches.""

- Hopkins attracts a lot of attention,"" Roby said. “He is a great receiver and a great ball-in-the-air threat. He’s one of the top receivers in the league.""

423,&gt;“What did I do to deserve that?” Roethlisberger told Ron Cook of thePittsburgh Post-Gazette. “All I’ve ever done is keep playing and keep my mouth shut. You just have to shrug that stuff off.

424,"Some good stuff from the article:

- “When he’s had some opportunities, he’s done some really good things,” Kubiak said. “As a young player, we’re trying to get him going as far as (pass) protection and those type of things. He’s starting to handle himself better. I think he deserves some more opportunities to touch the football.”

- Kubiak hinted that the best solution might not be abandoning C.J. Anderson as the lead running back, but rather giving Booker a larger share of the touches. Booker hasn’t had double-digit carries this season and has played only 23.8 percent of the Broncos’ offensive snaps.

- Most of the run game’s struggles start with the offensive line, but Booker has rushed for 161 yards and a solid 4.7 yards-per-carry average. Anderson has 330 rushing yards and a 3.5 yards-per-carry average, although his best three plays at San Diego last week – a 12-yard rush, a 15-yard rush and a 20-yard catch-and-run touchdown – were called back because of penalties by the offensive line.

- Anderson and Booker display different skill sets that might challenge defenses more when used in combination. Anderson has shown an ability to break tackles, be reliable in late-game situations and turn in the big play when his team needs it. Booker has shown explosiveness hitting the hole and an ability to cut quickly. He also has hands like a receiver. A mixture of both Anderson and Booker could get defenses more off balance and help offset a struggling offensive line.

- “That whole first game changed the way I looked at everything,” said Booker, the Broncos’ late fourth-round pick from Utah in April’s draft. “From the way I was carrying the ball to pass protection, it changed my whole game. Every week now, I think about that game and prepare differently for games.”

- Booker attributed his expected increased role starting Monday against Houston to “working his butt off” in practice, asking the right questions in meeting rooms and spending extra time with running backs coach Eric Studesville after practice. Booker earned the Broncos’ No. 2 running back role this summer by beating out Ronnie Hillman, the team’s leading rusher a season ago.",2016-10-19 16:22:09+00:00,d8ywkc6,1.0,t3_58b5fe,144,DenverBroncos

Here is some good stuff from this article: 

- With the victory [Super Bowl 50], Sanders fulfilled a dream he envisioned on the day that he signed his contract with the Broncos as a free agent. ""My ultimate dream is - I just had a son - and I want to go hoist that Lombardi and have my son run onto the field,"" Sanders said in 2014. ""This is a place that can make that dream come true.""

- Two years later, Sanders found himself in that moment, and he knew he didn't want to be anywhere else. He knew he wanted to remain a Denver Bronco. ""That's one of the reasons why I signed here,"" Sanders says now. ""We have an opportunity to hopefully build a dynasty. I could have gone somewhere else probably got more money or [gone] to a pass-heavy offense, but this is where I want to be. This is where I want to be able to win championships and be loyal to a city that's been loyal to me.""

- ""One of the best moments in Denver was being able to bring a parade to Denver and live in that moment with a million people coming out there,"" Sanders says. ""They're the most loyal fans I've ever been around. Rain, wind, snow, sleet - even in a loss, they support the team. Being able to be on a fire truck with Demaryius [Thomas] and saying that we were the world champions of that year. I want that moment again.""

- For Sanders, Denver is the only place to be because the Broncos have the one vital characteristic that brings the locker room together, and that's a championship mentality. ""When you speak of a Denver Bronco, to me it's all about chasing championships, trying to make history,"" Sanders says as he looks around the locker room. ""Just being around these guys like Aqib [Talib], Demaryius, guys that want to win championships, ... we're chasing goals. We're chasing championships.""

- As Head Coach Gary Kubiak said that week after beating the Colts, that's what you want from guys who put up a combined 393 catches for 5,462 yards and 32 touchdowns over the last two years. It's what you want from one of the best wide receiver duos in the league. ""Sometimes, me and Demaryius get frustrated because we know how good we can be,"" Sanders says. ""We know we can be a top-five, top-10 offense. ... We can pass the ball. We can run the ball. We can do whatever we want. It's just about continuously getting better, continuously believing in the system, and someday it's just going to open up a hole and take off.""

- ""That's the one-two punch,"" Sanders says. ""Me and D.T. take pride in being the best wide receivers group in the NFL year-in and year-out. The past two years, we've been that. It's our third year together and hopefully we're that way again.""

- ""Every week in the locker room we've got the TVs on and it's always defensive players up there,"" Sanders says. ""I keep telling the offensive guys, 'Hey, look, that's not fair.' We've got a powerful offense and some offensive guys deserve to be up there. But we don't want to just be up there. We want to deserve to be up there.""

- That game against the Bengals proved that the Broncos had potential beyond just the power of their defense. It proved the offense had potential beyond its rushing attack, which had led Denver in the first two games. ""We know the potential of this offense,"" Sanders says. ""We know that we can have a balanced attack and we can go out and throw 300 yards and four touchdowns and we can also run the ball, too. We can rush for 150 yards. Obviously, all of that comes with preparation out on the field and executing at a high level and maximizing our potential. I think our potential is that the sky's the limit for this offense and this defense and this team - as long as we go out and work.""

- ""You never become satisfied or stagnant in this league,"" Sanders says. Sanders realized one of his greatest dreams in Super Bowl 50, but he's not even close to satisfied.",2016-10-16 20:31:30+00:00,d8urbo1,1.0,t3_57teri,288,DenverBroncos

453,"Some good stuff from the article:

- Shortly into his tenure as Texas A&amp;M’s head coach, Sherman made a decision that would alter the path of Miller — as well as the Broncos and NFL. He kicked his star linebacker off the team before A&amp;M’s 2008 spring game for being late to study hall, missing class and not doing the things needed. Sherman threatened to end it all before it ever really got started.

- “He thought he was playing good football, but he really wasn’t. He was a linebacker off the line of scrimmage and wasn’t diagnosing things very well, didn’t work at it at that point real hard,” Sherman said. “Fortunately for me, he had a dad who backed me up and told him to do what coach Sherman tells you to do and sent him back to College Station (Texas) to be a part of the football team. If he didn’t have the dad he has, he could have ended up at another school and we never would have heard from him.”

- “But he made a decision to come back to do what he had to do,” Sherman said. “From that point forward he kind of changed things up. He was very accountable after that and did the things we wanted him to do.”

- In 2013, Sherman could only watch from afar as Miller, again, ran into trouble off the field with a six-game suspension for violating the league’s substance-abuse policy. But Sherman, knowing Miller, had little doubt as to how it would end. “A lot of guys when they get in trouble they blame everybody else,” Sherman said. “He doesn’t do that. He blames himself and he fixes what needs to be fixed.”

- Sherman says the “sky’s the limit” for Miller — who leads the league with 7.5 sacks through Thursday. He says  it in part because of Miller’s rare natural ability. “He could play a lot of positions on the football field. Obviously, the one he’s playing right now suits him just fine,” Sherman said. “But he could probably return kickoffs. He could probably be a running back, could be a tight end. There are very few players who have the ability and talent to be able to play multiple positions on an NFL field, but I think he has the ability to do that. That’s the level of talent that he is.”

- “Nobody said a bad word about Von Miller. He was back then what he is today,” Sherman said. “I think one of the most amazing things he did was after winning the Super Bowl, after becoming the MVP — and this kind of speaks volumes as to who he is — instead of sucking it all in and telling everybody why he is who he is and how great he is, he’s offering praise to other people in his life. I think in that moment, that’s one of the hardest things to do — to achieve the success he achieved, winning the Super Bowl, winning the MVP and to have the awareness and humility to point fingers at other people who helped him along the way. I don’t know really how much I helped him. He really helped himself and made his own decisions. He was gracious enough to offer praise to a lot of different people in his life who had been there for him. I’m probably most proud of him for that than anything he’s ever done.”",2016-10-16 20:08:28+00:00,d8uq6nq,1.0,t3_57tb90,61,DenverBroncos

469,"From the article:

- Gary Harris took his first shots on the court Thursday afternoon since going down with a right groin strain in the first preseason game. The post-practice shooting was light, but poignant for a player inching his way to a return.

- “That was the most I’ve done in a while,” Harris said. “Really haven’t tried anything (until today). Just tried to be cautious with it, make sure everything is cool. Don’t want to reaggravate it and make sure I’m feeling nothing when I’m doing things.”

- As for his shooting session after practice, Harris said, “Right there I felt fine, didn’t feel anything. So as long as we keep doing that, don’t want to push it too much.”

- Optimistic estimates on his return by Nuggets coach Michael Malone put Harris’ return right around the start of the regular season on Oct. 26. Harris wouldn’t rule it out, but wasn’t confirming that as a target date, either. “I’m just going day by day, just trying to get better each day,” Harris said. “That’s two weeks down the road: We’ll see. I’m just trying to get better each day.”

- “When I did it I felt it and I ended up coming back trying to push on it,” Harris said. “It just didn’t feel right and I was like ‘come get me (out of the game).’ They went back and checked on it. I didn’t think it would be anything too crazy, but I got the MRI and they said it was, and I was like ‘wow.’ I didn’t expect it. It is what it is. Just got to come back, make sure I come back healthy.”

- “I just see what I see and try to help my teammates out, especially the young guys,” Harris said. “Still thinking the game even though I’m not playing. Everything happens for a reason. I’m just going to take the punches and roll with them, come back healthy and get out there.

- Left tackle Russell Okung, who had two costly holding penalties in the second half of the Broncos’ 21-13 loss to the San Diego Chargers Thursday night, was taken by cart from the visiting locker room at Qualcomm stadium to an ambulance about a half hour after the game. He was quickly released from the hospital as he was cleared to fly back to Denver, although he did not accompany the team on its charter flight. Okung was hooked up to an IV as he was carted to the ambulance. The Broncos announced Okung was experiencing concussion-like symptoms.

- “We are getting closer to game time, we are getting closer to regular season and that means the systems have to be in place,” said Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog. “I think we are where we want to be, but just because we are where we want to be doesn’t mean we can’t get better. We want to get better and we want to work on the details in the game.”

- “Right now we are just working on detail such as power play, penalty kill and stuff like that,” Landeskog said. “Today there was some three-on-three, four-on-four situations like that, we just have got to make sure we are on the same page out there and I feel like we’re getting real close.”

- “Preseason games you don’t have your full lineup in and the setups aren’t the way they will be in the regular season,” Landeskog explained. “For us, we feel like we’ve lacked some pace to our game in our power play; the PK has been awesome and we just have to make sure we reset with our power play.”

- With the alternate captain roles recently decided, the 23-year-old Landeskog doesn’t feel any added responsibility as a leader in the dressing room saying, “This is a team that everyone knows what to expect of each other, everybody knows how to handle themselves. It’s not like I’m running around here policing anybody.”

We were winning as a team. I understood it. The momentum was there and you don’t want to mess around with the quarterback position and Craig was playing very well. I didn’t really play very much until the playoff game against the 49ers that year and I understood it.”

- “I that’s when were at our best,” Malone said of Denver’s ability to get out on the break. “In transition before the defense sets, looking for early seams, drive, kick, and attack the mismatch.”

- “No doubt,” Malone said on if getting out in transition is a point of emphasis this season. “We want to be a team who wants to pride ourself on defense, then rebounding, and then running. With the running, we have to have discipline within that and that’s where our turnovers and shot selection haven’t been great all the time.”

- “We have two very capable playmaking bigs that have great vision. Emmanuel Mudiay is a big, strong guard and we’ve challenged him to average more than 3.5 rebounds per game. The beauty in that, a la Will Barton last season, when you defensive rebound ignite the break, push the break, and Pat Riley used to always say defense and rebounding are the triggers that ignite the break and that’s what we want,” Malone said. “We’re going to give our bigs the freedom to rebound and push for a couple of dribbles to make a play. You saw Jokic do it quite a bit last year, but it’s best when your point guard, Emmanuel Mudiay, your perimeter players, Wilson Chandler, Gallo, rebound, everybody else run and push.”

- “If I rebound and I push the break, we don’t have to run as many plays, honestly we don’t need to be a halfcourt team, that’s not what we need to be doing,” Mudiay said. “We get the rebound, we go, get the best shot, get more possessions on offense. Because last year, we started doing that towards the last couple months, just running more, and we want to get into that momentum going into this year. That’s something me and Gary (Harris) were talking about; just staying in that aggresive attack mode.”

- “The way we’re trying to play is not run so many plays,” Mudiay said. “Just run-and-gun and stuff like that.”",2016-10-12 14:42:37+00:00,d8otc61,1.0,t3_574eby,70,denvernuggets

- Barring an unexpected setback to his left shoulder, Trevor Siemian will be the Denver Broncos’ starting quarterback Thursday night at San Diego, multiple sources told 9News.

- The process of having Siemian start against the Chargers actually started when he was informed Saturday he wouldn’t be dressing against the Falcons. Broncos coach Gary Kubiak told Siemian not only that he wouldn’t play against Atlanta, but that he needs to start watching film for the following game against AFC West Division foe San Diego. “I checked them out Saturday night when I found out that I wasn’t playing,’’ Siemian said. “‘Kubes’ wanted me to do that, so I got a little head start.’’

- To test his shoulder physically for the Chargers, Siemian was the only Broncos’ player who wore shoulder pads beneath his jersey during practice Tuesday. The left shoulder injury had been inhibiting Siemian’s range of motion as he passed during practice late last week, and to a lesser extent Monday.

- The Broncos listed Siemian as “limited” on their injury report both Monday and Tuesday and he will likely be classified as “questionable” on Wednesday. But he has been getting almost all of the first-team reps this week and providing the shoulder doesn’t experience unmanageable pain in the next 48 hours -- doubtful since the Broncos have nothing more than a walkthrough and meetings in that period -- the Broncos will start him against the Chargers. “I think I’m expecting to play,” Siemian said.

- The Broncos are also planning to start right tackle Donald Stephenson and tight end Virgil Green, who missed the last three games with calf injuries.",2016-10-12 04:58:11+00:00,d8oesv9,1.0,t3_572him,110,DenverBroncos

- Still wearing a no-contact orange jersey, winger Mikko Rantanen went through a full practice with the Avalanche Saturday morning for the first time since suffering an ankle injury in a Rookie Showcase game against San Jose on Sept. 17.

- “I’m getting better every day,” said Rantanen, 19, the Avalanche’s first-round 2015 draft choice. “The rehab had gone pretty well and it’s starting to feel pretty good. I just have to keep it feeling good, that’s the goal.”

- Rantanen has been skating for a week, but Saturday was the first time he had practiced. “I could go every drill,” he said. “I didn’t feel it. So it’s definitely pretty good now.”

- Will he be ready to play in the regular-season opener, on Oct. 15 against Dallas at the Pepsi Center? “We’ll see,” he said. “We just want to go day to day now. It’s still one week ’til the opening night … We have to be smart with it.”

- He said of the injury in the rookie game: “I chipped it out and fell on the ankle a little bit. I twisted it there. Unlucky, but that’s how it is sometimes.”

- “It was a good year,” he said. “Of course, it wasn’t very good for the (Rampage), but personally, I learned a lot,” he said. “It’s a tough game in the AHL, too, so I learned a lot about the (North) American style of play in a small rink. I like it more than a bigger one because there’s more things happening faster there. You get the scoring chances more because there’s not as much room. The goal is pretty close from the corners and in Europe, it’s pretty far away to wheel from the corner. So that's good for me.""

- “I think I’m physically and mentally ready to play in the NHL,” he said. “I just want to first put my ankle at 100 percent and then show what I can do.”",2016-10-08 19:29:10+00:00,d8jjcu7,1.0,t3_56ijs3,157,ColoradoAvalanche

- “It starts with the get-off. He’s got a terrific first step, and then he has the ability to shake a guy,” Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Quinn said. “So you’re worried about his power, you’re ready to sit on that, and then he could slip you. You’re worried about his speed, and then he can convert to power. It’s kind of like the baseball pitcher that can throw the fastball by you, then you’re waiting on the fastball and here comes the changeup where you’re, ‘Man, I wasn’t ready for that.’ ”

- “He always gets there,” Broncos cornerback Chris Harris said. “They can’t rush like him. He has God-given ability that nobody has.”

- “Even though he gets off so quick, you can’t get that outside burst on people because they block you from the outside in,”  Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said. “But we’ve got a few things that combat that. It makes it hard for them to complete the ball down the field when they don’t have anybody out — when they only have three receivers out. They lose a little bit trying to do that. We obviously lose a lot when they double-team our outside guys. Also, Wolfe is a good inside rusher, and that has made a difference. If you double the outside guys, he’s one-on-one inside, and he’s been able to beat people.”

- “I don’t really try to get caught up in, ‘Man, I got chipped that play,’ ” Miller said. “Coach (Mike) Sherman, my coach in college (at Texas A&amp;M), told me a long time ago: ‘Guys will start chipping you, but they’re not going to chip you all game. There’s no way they can chip you all game. If they do, we win.’ ”

556,"Sorry for no practice notes today guys, I was too damn busy. Here is the key stuff from the article:

- Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian was limited in practice Thursday, but resumed throwing during individual and some seven-on-seven drills, a promising sign as he recovers from a left shoulder sprain. Siemian had said earlier in the week that he anticipates playing Sunday, when the Broncos host the Falcons, and that he’s approaching the week of practice with the expectation that he will start.

- “It was a step forward. We’ll see how sore he is, how he’s feeling as we move to tomorrow. Hopefully he does a little more,” coach Gary Kubiak said Thursday. “I think he took a big step forward today and, like I said, see how he comes out of today and how he throws tomorrow.”

- “The biggest thing is you’re so sore, and when you throw your trunk is moving, everything is moving,” Kubiak said. “Trevor threw the ball fine today. You could just tell the rotation and stuff is something you have to get used to it. It’s kind of like working through a hip pointer, in a way. It doesn’t feel very good, but it’s something you have to work through, the soreness. But I think he took a good step today.”

- In the meantime, Kubiak has ensured that rookie Paxton Lynch receives extra reps in practice this week to prepare him in case he’s needed against Atlanta, and to continue his development. “We just keep getting them all ready to play,” Kubiak said. “Austin (Davis) is repping as well.""

- “I can’t get ahead of myself. I’m just going to see where (Trevor) is at tomorrow"", Kubiak said.",2016-10-06 20:06:17+00:00,d8gwx6e,1.0,t3_567en4,128,DenverBroncos

- In 17 minutes of play Murray had nine points on 3-of-5 shooting, made his only 3-point try and added three rebounds. 

- He said the biggest thing he needs to work on are memorizing the plays. “I’ve just got to get used to the plays, that’s my biggest challenge,” Murray said. “Not knowing just one spot, but knowing both spots. And the coverages for both on defense as well. To shoot efficiently, know when to pick my spots, when to attack, when to score. Playing two spots it’s kind of difficult to know when to shoot, I’ve just got to find that balance.

564,"Some good stuff from the article:

- “It fires us up to go compete against the best,” Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib said. “Julio and Matt Ryan are the best right now in the league.”

- The key matchup to watch will be Jones vs. Talib and whatever help the Broncos give him – most likely a safety. Jones, at 6-foot-3, routinely outmuscles smaller defensive backs, leaving the 6-1 Talib the likely primary defender, but cornerbacks Chris Harris (5-10) and Bradley Roby  (5-11) also will probably get some looks. Denver probably will defend Jones the same way it defended Bengals’ receiver A.J. Green with a cornerback, typically Talib, playing man-to-man coverage on short and intermediate routes with safeties Darian Stewart or T.J. Ward protecting against the deep route.

- “You’re talking about two Pro Bowl players. It’s hard to stop them,” Broncos nose tackle Sylvester Williams said. “It’s not surprising at all.”

- Denver embraces playing against pass-heavy offenses. The Broncos lead the NFL in sacks with 17. Outside linebacker Von Miller (5.5) and defensive end Derek Wolfe (four) have more sacks combined than 21 NFL teams. They also rank in the top five in total defense, passing defense and points allowed per game. Meanwhile, Atlanta boasts the NFL’s top scoring offense, averaging 38 points a game. Ryan completed 14-of-16 passes for 415 yards and three touchdowns on passes longer than 10 yards downfield against Carolina, according to ESPN Stats and Info. And Jones gained 120 of his 300 yards after the catch.

- “They were just better than us. We just couldn’t do anything against them,” Bucs receiver Mike Evans said about Denver after Sunday’s game. “They’re a simple defense, and we were getting the looks we thought we were going to get, we just couldn’t beat them.”

- “We’re looking forward to the challenge, man,” Williams said. “I’ll take our secondary any day of the week.”",2016-10-05 01:12:52+00:00,d8edo70,1.0,t3_55wygv,147,DenverBroncos

- Carrying handguns, openly or concealed, is legal in Texas with a proper license. But it is a third-degree felony (2-10 years in state prison) to carry one without a license at a place that sells liquor, such as the V Live strip club. It is a Class A misdemeanor (up to one year in county jail) to have a handgun while intoxicated, no matter licensing.

- Frustration was high and tempers were short. Before the teams finished their post-weather delay stretch, as CBS viewers were taking in the start of 60 Minutes, the two sides engaged in a pushing, shoving and cap bill flipping incident that involved a member of the Broncos’ equipment staff.

- As a member of the Broncos’ equipment staff went back to catch Dixon’s punts during warmups, a few Bucs’ players started telling at him to get out. Next thing you know, some Broncos’ players said No. 78, who is listed as backup Tampa Bay offensive tackle Gosder Cherilus, walked over and knocked off the equipment guy’s Broncos’ ball cap.

- Broncos safety Shiloh Keo, who was inactive because of a right knee injury, was standing along the sideline toward where the Broncos’ were stretching when he noticed the disturbance. Keo ran over for support.

- “Honestly, I thought they were being jerks,’’ Keo said of the Buc players. “Here’s a guy who was trying to help them out by giving them a heads up. I think they got sour and took it the wrong way. And every day we’re taught to fight for each other. To me it doesn’t matter if you’re a player, a coach or somebody who works in the organization, we’re going to look after our own.’’

- “If anything yell at the player who was kicking the ball and we can understand and handle it that way,’’ Keo said. “But you’re going to pick on somebody who’s out there who’s trying to keep everybody safe. He’s just doing what he’s told, who had nothing to do with the physical aspect of the game. I don’t know want happened when they went into the locker room (during the weather delay) but I’m sure there was some frustration. Because we were frustrated, too.

581,"Good stuff from the article:

- The first interception came on the third play of the game. Winston, on third-and-6 at Tampa’s 29-yard line, sent a short pass up the middle intended for receiver Adam Humphries. Talib jumped the route and ran it back 25 yards before being brought down by center Joe Hawley.

- “Vincent Jackson was my man,” Talib explained. “He ran under, he got cut by the inside guy and I knew they were going to run a follow — it’s a route concept called ‘follow.’ I knew they were going to run follow, so I waited for Chris (Harris) to run it and I jumped it. Good call by coach, man. We had a good idea what they were going to run. Good call by coach and we capitalized on it.”

- The second interception came on a third-and-10 on the Bucs’ first drive of the second quarter. Winston, again in shotgun, aimed a pass for reciever Mike Evans that Talib picked off and ran back 15 yards to Tampa’s 27.

- “I was in zone coverage, in cover-2, and (Winston) tried to fit it in a tight window, like he does, so I was able to make a play on it,” Talib said. “I didn’t really bait him. I just knew if Vincent Jackson was going to run his curl, that was going to undercut. I thought he was going to run a seven-stop. He ran inside, he ran a curl. I knew I was going to stay outside and as soon as he stopped, I’d undercut him. Jameis threw it, and I was able to make a play on it.”

- Hawley, again, brought Talib down before he could take it in for a touchdown.

- “I let a lineman tackle me today. I’m embarrassed,” Talib said. “I let a lineman tackle me today, man. He might have been the first lineman to tackle me. I just told Kapri Bibbs a lineman would never tackle me.”

- “We watched the tape. We saw how confident he is in his arm, so we knew we would have five or six opportunities today to get our hands on the football,” Talib said. “We capitalized on three of them. We’ll take that. He throws the ball into tight windows. He throws the ball out of guys’ breaks, so while they’re breaking, he’s going to throw it out of your break so you better win. If a guy doesn’t win, if a defensive back wins, you’re going to have a chance to make a play.""",2016-10-03 21:01:04+00:00,d8cn6nm,1.0,t3_55pwp9,205,DenverBroncos

- “Right now we’re worried about the Denver Nuggets,” coach Michael Malone said. “That’s nothing against Toronto, heck of a team and well-coached with Dwayne Casey. But for us right now, this first game against Toronto is let’s keep on pounding that rock, who we are, who we need to be and what’s the right way of playing. And as the game goes on we can make some adjustments. But when you play eight preseason games the way we are, if we went 8-0 that would be great but that’s not our goal. Our goal is to try different lineups, see who is playing well with each other, give guys some rest some nights. And just for us, every night out is an opportunity for us to establish our culture and our identity. And if we can do that, that’s our biggest goal as we head into the regular season.”

- Tonight’s game is the debut of rookies Jamal Murray, Juancho Hernangomez and Malik Beasley. Wilson Chandler gets his first chance to get back on the court since last year’s preseason. And there is the race for No. 15, the six players who are vying for the last roster spot.

- Axel Toupane, JaKarr Sampson, Robbie Hummel, D.J. Kennedy, Jarnell Stokes and Nate Wolters will be sprinkled in with some of the regulars.

That's just my speculation on that. I could see how in the media it's important to credit information to people, but in the mad rush that is the postgame press conferences and interviews in the locker room, that can be difficult to do. Groke is a credited media member, Perna isn't fully yet so I believe that annoyed him a bit. When I made that postgame comments post, I got that quote from a tweet from a CBS guy covering the Broncos (I don't remember exactly who). So I got it from that guy, put it on here, Perna took it from here and tweeted it, and Groke seemed displeased with that.

- “In terms of any large decision that we have made since I have been involved as a GM, Dick has always been fully apprised and fully involved,” Bridich said. “So I’m sure he will be part of the decision-making process.”

- “It should be part of our thought process and our goal making,” Bridich said. “Look, if you go back two winters ago, was it really realistic to talk about that two winters ago? No. That’s why we didn’t do it. The goal was to play meaningful games … creating a situation where we had continued belief in the group and continued belief in ourselves as we played into August and September.""

- “There were some intrinsic and some intangible things we had to start to cross off the list before we could realistically start talking about playoffs and thinking playoffs. It’s a good thing that we can now, and we should, starting thinking that way. That’s a positive for us as an organization.”

- Weiss, who is ending his fourth season as manager, has been careful when talking about his tenuous status. Asked if he wants to return, he said: “Yes, but you want to be wanted back. I love our players and our staff, but you have to feel wanted back. I don’t want to be here if I’m not wanted.”

- Regarding how he will go about fixing a failed bullpen that has a National League-worst 5.11 ERA, Bridich said: “I’m not sure yet. I think that we are going to do everything that we need to do in the offseason to see if there are ways to making us better in the ‘pen.” He said it’s possible that some starters in the farm system or on the current 40-man roster could evolve into relievers.

- Bridich said he was pleased with the job Mark Reynolds did at first base before a broken hand ended Reynolds’ season. Reynolds is due to become a free agent, but Bridich said the club remains interested in bringing him back. “It’s something that we will certainly discuss with him,” Bridich said. “It takes two to tango there. But he was a positive for us.”

- Bridich made it clear he doesn’t need to trade any of his talented outfielders, saying he likes the outfield’s depth. He also expects Gerardo Parra to rebound from a disappointing season that was marred by a high-ankle sprain. “We signed him to be part of our outfield rotation.

633,"Some good stuff from the article:

- “That’s something that he should aspire to be — a guy who could be considered a legitimate ace,” manager Walt Weiss said Wednesday before the Rockies played the Giants in the second game of the series. “(Gray could be) a guy that’s in that Cy Young conversation, at some point. Johnny’s got that type of talent, but you have to go out and do it for a period of time.”

- Gray, 10-9 with a 4.54 ERA, entered the season already possessing a 95 mph fastball, a pitch he can crank up to 98. He also owned a wipe-out pitch — an 88-89 mph slider that cuts like a knife when he commands it properly. But Gray wanted something more; a pitch that would play mind games with batters and set up his power stuff. So he went into spring training determined to perfect his curveball.

- “In spring training, I caught his first bullpen and he threw one and I was like, ‘Wow!’ ” catcher Nick Hundley recalled. “I knew it could be a good pitch, but he had to gain the confidence to use it. He had to be able to use it in games, in different counts and against the best hitters in the world.”

- “I’ve come to see how much throwing the curve has helped,” said Gray, who will be making his 29th start Thursday. “After I’ve shown a hitter that pitch, I’ve seen that it is so much easier to face the hitter the next time. I could tell that guys were not hacking away at my fastball like they had been. The curve has become a big weapon for me. Being able to control it as a two-strike pitch was a big step.”

- Gray has a 10.07 strikeout rate per nine innings, trailing only the late Jose Fernandez, Robbie Ray, Max Scherzer, Noah Syndergaard and Madison Bumgarner among National League starters. Gray’s ability to strike out batters is tied to his curveball, a pitch that comes to the plate at 77-78 mph, almost 20 mph slower than his fastball.

- “His curveball, giving him that separation and change of pace, has been really good lately,” Hundley said. “Whether it’s buying strikes early in the count or throwing the curve in the dirt as a chase pitch late in the count, Jon’s got a really good feel for it now.”",2016-09-29 15:05:21+00:00,d86yoau,1.0,t3_552kvx,201,ColoradoRockies

- After opening his NHL career with three-plus seasons with the Rangers that spanned the 2004-05 lockout and lost season, Tyutin joined the Blue Jackets in a July 2008 trade and in 2011 signed the six-year, $27 million extension Columbus eventually bought out. So he had eight seasons in Columbus.

- “It was business,” Tyutin said Wednesday morning. “I have nothing but good things to say about the Blue Jackets organization.”

- In the Avalanche’s 4-2 exhibition win over Dallas on Wednesday night, Tyutin played 22 minutes and was paired with fellow Russian Sergei Boikov, a 20-year-old who was Colorado’s sixth-round draft choice in 2015 and spent three seasons with Drummondville of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League before playing four games at the end of the season with the Avalanche’s AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage.

- “I was happy for him,” Tyutin said. “It was his first exhibition game and he was so excited about it. It gave me a flashback to when I was in the same position as him.”

- Colorado likely will have four Russians — Zadorov, Mikhail Grigorenko, Tyutin and Varlamov. Tyutin is a three-time Russian Olympian, playing for his homeland in 2006, 2010 and 2014, and Varlamov was his teammate in the last two Winter Games.

- “It’ll be great,” Tyutin said of playing with Varlamov. “I had a Russian goalie in Columbus (Sergei Bobrovsky) and a goalie is a defenseman’s best friend. I have known Semyon for quite a bit and that will make it that much easier, more comfortable for me to join and play on this team.”",2016-09-29 05:15:00+00:00,d86k7pe,1.0,t3_550jmp,2700,ColoradoAvalanche

As one of four skaters to have played in both Colorado exhibition games so far, Smith has two goals — including the game-winner in the third period of the Avs’ 4-2 Wednesday win over Dallas in the Pepsi Center.

- “I’m just looking to prove myself,” Smith, 28, said after the game. “That’s the main thing, try and prove what I can do, try to be an everyday player and try to make this team. That’s what I’m focusing on right now, doing everything I can to get here.”

- “Last season wasn’t what I wanted to happen, obviously,” Smith said. “You try and learn from it, try to not get too low and not get too high and try to have confidence in your game and know what kind of player you are.”

- New Avalanche coach Jared Bednar, who was behind the Pepsi Center bench for the first time Wednesday night, said of Smith: “I thought he had a great game tonight. I just like the way he works. He works everyt shift. He pays attention to the details and his compete level is strong. When you compete like that, good things will happen for you.”

- Bednar called his own experience “cool. I liked it. I was excited to come out and play tonight, I didn’t love our first couple of periods. A little too much standing around for me and we kind of dug in in the third and started to play the way I like to see us play.”

- Bednar said the Avalanche now will make some cuts, and that Carl Soderberg and Gabe Landeskog — back after playing for Sweden in the World Cup — would practice Thursday.

638,"Some good stuff from the article:

- Before he was truly ready for the trip here for training camp, Emmanuel Mudiay had some required viewing to take care of. Watching the final game of last season, his rookie season. He liked “that” Mudiay. He wanted to remind himself of what he was that day and tap back into what the player on the screen had. That point guard had moxie. But more than anything else, that point guard had confidence. And the team around him had confidence in him.

- “That was myself. I felt like myself,” Mudiay said of that game at Portland. “It kind of motivated me to come in like ‘This is how you need to come in.’ ""

- “Emmanuel looks like a different player,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said on the second day of training camp. “Physically, he’s a big, strong, imposing guard as it is. I think he’s even bigger and stronger coming into camp. He’s in great shape. He’s much more confident in himself as a leader.”

- “You’ve got to go with what got you to the NBA, first and foremost,” Mudiay said. “So, be comfortable with that and then develop the other stuff. So I’m going to keep using my athleticism until I feel I need to just keep consistently shooting outside.”

- His shooting accuracy of 36 percent overall, 31 percent from the 3-point line and 67 percent from the free-throw line all must improve in Year 2 to make that happen. Getting to the rim and finishing more often is where Mudiay figures to start that jump. He made 43 percent of his attempts at the rim as a rookie, but he’s banking on full health to help push that number much higher.

- “Last year, I wasn’t fully healthy from the start,” Mudiay said. “In the summer, I did a lot of stuff to get my body back right. So I feel great in that aspect. But as far as having one year under my belt … just knowing what to expect, there are no surprises. You put in the work, God is going to reward you with the rest. That’s how I look at it.”

- “My message to him coming into camp is ‘I want you to be a leader,’ ” Malone said. “’You’re our floor leader. The ball is in your hands. Run your team, be vocal and be comfortable in doing so. I want these guys to get used to hearing your voice. He has really taken that to heart. I love the pace at which he’s playing with. He’s in great shape.

- There’s a good chance Virgil Green and Donald Stephenson won't play again this Sunday when the Broncos play at Tampa Bay. Stephenson was expected to be a two-week injury but Green expressed confidence last Friday he would play against the Tampa Bay Bucs.

They’re both doing better. I think they’re both day-to-day. We chose to keep them inside today, but we’ll make a decision tomorrow.’’

He had 19 interceptions, four returned for touchdowns, in 4 ½ seasons there before the team became concerned with some of his youthful transgressions and traded him to New England. The game this Sunday will be his first trip to Tampa Bay since he was traded away.

- “We’re going to have him play on the ball and off the ball, he’s got to learn all the spots on the floor,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “That’s what a good point guard should do anyway.

And we have plenty of coaches to help him, if he has any questions in terms of the offense.”

- “Keeping track of the plays, keeping track of what your job is and where everybody is going to be,” Murray said. “Part of being a point guard is knowing what’s going to happen and just keeping my energy up and staying sharp and staying ready.”

- Asked about the first three practices, Murray said, “Good system, very organized, just having a lot of fun.""

- “I think his biggest challenge is going to be physicality,” Malone said. “You’re a 19-year old kid coming into the NBA – it’s NBA, no boys allowed. He’s already going through it going against the vets. It’s a lot different than summer league. Fighting through the rigors and the demands of an NBA season and the physicality of NBA players.”

- “I told him before camp started – just like I told Malik and Juancho – take a deep breath, you don’t have to impress anybody, you’re here for a reason, just go out there and be true to yourself,” Malone said. “A lot of young guys try to do too much.

- Forward Darrell Arthur worked on the side as he continues to rehab his left knee. All other players participated.

- “I think the guys understood last night we took a little dip,” Malone said. “But they responded well in practice No. 3, and we’ll have to come back tonight and have an even better practice.""

- Malone said all the players vying for the last spot on the roster have “looked good.” “Not one guy has stood out more than the other,” Malone said. There are six players competing for that spot – D.J. Kennedy, Jarnell Stokes, Robbie Hummel, Nate Wolters, Axel Toupane and JaKarr Sampson.

- Coaches both from Creighton and North Dakota were in attendance. “If they want to come in and watch practice and try and pick some things up, I think it’s only right to open it up and allow guys to come in,” Malone said. “Guys from North Dakota, who (assistant coach) Ryan Bowen knows, drove eight hours down. If you drive eight hours, season starts in five days, yes, come on down and if there is something we’re doing that you can use for your team, we’re all caretakers of the game.

- ""I don’t ever put a limit on myself. Everybody has been saying ‘Oh, D-Ware is down, what is Shane going to do? Is he going to step up?’"" Ray said, adding he’s always been confident in his ability. ""I just knew my team could depend on me so I went out and did what I’ve been saying I could do. I just had the opportunity now.""

- Ray added that he’s been compared to greats ever since he was drafted, and expectations have always been high. But dropping in the draft due to a marijuana infraction put him on a different path than he originally planned. Instead of going to a lesser team and starting right away, he was brought in to the Broncos, behind one already pass-rushing legend (DeMarcus Ware) and another one in the making (Von Miller).

- ""I was brought here and my role is different. I was able to mature and now I’m showing everybody what I always said I could do. I’m an elite player, and I’m going to prove it. Not even to show everybody else but to do what I know I could do.""

- ""A lot of my tackles are me coming free and chasing a guy down the field to get in on a tackle, things that if you’re just chilling, you wouldn’t make those plays,"" Ray said, calling his sacks ""just a lot of good effort.""

- ""That’s exactly what we want. Our offense doing their job, helping us out, giving us opportunities to do what we do. We want guys to have to pass on us, because our secondary is second to none, our pass rush is elite, and we can get to the QB and make plays.""

668,"**QB Jameis Winston:** Winston threw for over 400 yards last week and three touchdowns, but two turnovers -- particularly a fumble forced by Robert Quinn that was scooped up by Ethan Westbrooksand returned 77 yards for a touchdown -- doomed Winston and the Bucs in what was a particularly painful loss to the Rams on Sunday. On a positive note, his touchdown throw to Mike Evans off his back foot, with three Rams defenders right in his face, was a real gem.

**WR Mike Evans:** He had a career-high 10 catches for 132 receiving yards Sunday against the Rams and will face a huge test against Aqib Talib. Winston and Evans have improved their chemistry significantly and they’ve worked particularly hard on the deep ball. This offense does rely on Evans to leap and make contested catches -- and normally his 6-foot-5 frame is a mismatch for plenty of cornerbacks. Not for Talib, though, and he’s probably salivating watching tape from the Bucs' game against theArizona Cardinals. One thing to key in on -- Evans’ composure when Talib tries to rattle him.

**TE Cameron Brate:** Austin Seferian-Jenkins may have gotten more of the attention, but for the majority of the offseason and training camp, Brate was the most consistent target for Winston. That, and the extra red zone work they’ve been putting in after every practice came to fruition Sunday, with his two-touchdown performance against the Rams.

**DT Gerald McCoy:** The Bucs’ defensive line revolves around No. 93, and with former Broncos defensive end Robert Ayers likely to miss this week with an ankle injury, more rides on McCoy’s production. Aside from Clinton McDonald, he’s surrounded by youth. He’s got a scary get-off that defensive coordinator Mike Smith says gave him “many sleepless nights” when he was head coach of the Atlanta Falcons. While they got close a couple of times last week, the Bucs’ defensive line just couldn’t pressure Rams QB Case Keenum.

**LB Kwon Alexander:** Alexander kicked off his season with 17 tackles and a sack against the Falcons. Then last week, he recorded the first pick-six of his career on a pass that was intended for Tavon Austin. He sometimes plays a little too “amped up,” takes risks and gets out of position, but he’s one of the hardest hitters on the team, he’s a lot more active toward the line of scrimmage in this system and he’s mastering the more cerebral elements of the game thanks to daily one-on-one sessions with Smith. The defense has given up way too many explosive plays though, and as the Mike linebacker, it’s something he has to take ownership of.

**LB Lavonte David:** After a rare, rare week where he was essentially eliminated from the stat sheet against the Cardinals, David rebounded with a strong performance against the Rams, sacking Keenum and forcing a fumble that safety Chris Conterecovered. For a defense that was one of just three teams in the league that had yet to force a turnover, this was much-needed. He had eight combined tackles and two tackles for a loss. Like Alexander, he’s a lot more downhill and active this year. The Bucs will blitz him, too.",2016-09-28 15:41:57+00:00,d85lrot,1.0,t3_54wxl6,223,DenverBroncos

- Asked what his game plan will be for LeMahieu, Weiss answered: “We’ll play it by ear. I’ve taken a lot of heat for something like this, with Morneau, and I’ll fall on the sword, for sure, for DJ.""

- “When it comes down to sitting out an at-bat or two, whatever it looks like, I’m willing to do that to get him the batting title.”

- Weiss explained his philosophy this way: “Winning a batting title doesn’t take one day, the last game of the season, it takes six months. I don’t know how it’s all going to play out. I’d love to see DJ win that batting title.”

- LeMahieu entered Tuesday night’s game against the Giants batting .350, just ahead of Washington’s Daniel Murphy, who’s batting .347.  While Murphy hasn’t played since Sept. 20 because of a strained buttocks), LeMahieu has continued to play every day. His 38-game on-base streak ended Friday.

- LeMahieu wants to be the batting king, but he doesn’t like the idea of concentrating on an individual award. “I don’t really enjoy that,” he said. “It’s not how I got here, it’s not how I played all year. And now that we are officially out of (the playoffs), it makes it harder. It’s more difficult to concentrate on winning. We don’t have that urgency we had a couple of weeks ago.”

- “It’s always tougher to play under those conditions,” Weiss said. “But I don’t worry about DJ. He’s as motivated as anybody I’ve managed on a day-to-day basis.”",2016-09-28 15:21:54+00:00,d85kskz,1.0,t3_54wu6j,126,ColoradoRockies
670,"Some good stuff from the article:

- Before Tuesday night’s game against the Giants, all-star third baseman Nolan Arenado talked about the state of the Rockies as their 2016 season nears its end. “I think we are limping into the finish a little bit. … I think we are a little tired,” he said. “But we know we are close to doing something special in the next few years.”

- “I felt very comfortable, but I have to give credit (to the Giants),” said Marquez, who fell to 1-1 with a 6.14 ERA. “But I battled them.”

- It was the Rockies’ fifth consecutive loss, one shy of their worst losing streak of the season. The road has been particularly harsh of late. They are 5-19 away from Coors Field since July 31 and have lost eight consecutive games on the road.  Rockies pitchers have allowed two or more home runs in seven of those eight losses.

- Marquez, the 21-year-old right-hander who was the 2016 pitcher of the year for the Double-A Eastern League, made his second major-league start. Before the game, manager Walt Weiss said: “I think it will be a great experience for him. It’s going to be a great atmosphere. … I expect him to go out there and do well.”

- “We didn’t see the finish to his pitches tonight,” Weiss said of Marquez. “His breaking ball wasn’t as sharp as it has been and his fastball was running back over the plate. He just didn’t have the crispness to his stuff like he did the last time out.”

- Meanwhile, San Francisco left-hander Matt Moore baffled Colorado hitters, striking out 11 to match his career high. He didn’t walk a batter and was charged with one run on six hits in 7 ⅓ innings.

- “Moore had a really good cutter for the righties and he had a good breaking ball to the lefties tonight,” Weiss said. “And he mixed some changeups into the righties.”

- Colorado’s only run came in the third on a leadoff double by Cristhian Adames, a sacrifice by Marquez and an RBI groundout by Charlie Blackmon.

- DJ LeMahieu struck out in his first three at-bats before singling in the eighth. His average dipped from .350 to .349, but he still holds a slim lead over Washington’s Daniel Murphy (.347) in the race for the NL batting crown.

- The Nuggets play games at mile high altitude. Last season they held training camp at an even higher altitude, in Colorado Springs. But this year, they’ve dropped down about 4,000 feet from Denver in holding the first week of training camp in Omaha, Neb.

- “I go back to last year when we were in Colorado Springs, which is even a higher altitude than where we are. It really kicked some of our guys butts,” Malone said. “We had guys dropping like flies. So in a weird way, yes we play at altitude but this is going to allow us to have guys get through training camp, not battle the demands of fatigue that altitude presents.""

- “And everybody thinks training camp is just this week in Omaha. Training camp is the month of October up until opening night on Oct. 26. So we’ll have plenty of time to get back in Denver, get used to the altitude and condition at altitude to get in shape. But this allows us to get a great base heading into all of that.”

678,"Some good stuff from the article:

- Several of the Broncos’ top defenders, including safety T.J. Ward and cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Kayvon Webster, went to outside linebacker Von Miller’s house for a late-night film session after they returned to Denver Sunday night.

- Despite a strong performance holding quarterback Andy Dalton and the Bengals to 17 points, those Broncos were nitpicking their bad plays. How did running back Jeremy Hill break free for a 50-yard run on the first drive? How did Dalton connect with tight end C.J. Uzomah for a 22-yard gain on third-and-9 midway through the second quarter? They analyzed the tape.

- “Before we even get in the meeting room, for them to tell us where we made mistakes, we already know,” Ward said. “That’s the next level, if you want to be great. Everyone has to be great, not only here, but on their own time.”

- “I hope they are. They should be trying to find something, but it’s hard to find. It’s hard to find a crack in this defense. We pride ourselves on that,” Ward said. “You can try to do something from last week that a team had a little success on, but we’re probably going to fix that and be ready for it the next week. You have to come up with something creative. That’s hard, because even if you have a scheme, you still have to beat us one-on-one.”

- “It was obvious they were trying to keep Von and everybody off their quarterback,” Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. “They were committed to the run, chipping us and doing those type of things. But then at the end of the day, we had four sacks out of our two outside guys between Shane (Ray) and Von. So I think that was their plan going into it, but we hung in there. The key was us coming back in the second half, stopping the run. If we don’t stop it, we’re probably in for a long day.""

- The Bengals finished with 29 rushes for 143 yards and two touchdowns, averaging 4.9 yards per carry, but those numbers don’t tell the full story. The Broncos responded well after the Bengals’ opening drive, highlighted by Hill’s 50-yard rush. After that first drive, Denver held Cincinnati to 78 yards rushing and one touchdown on 25 carries, averaging 3.1 yards.

- “They caught us out of position,” said Broncos defensive end Billy Winn, who was a key player in stopping the run Sunday. “Guys played real aggressive, and we missed our gaps and techniques. They were able to crease it. We settled down and made some adjustments to stop that.”

- Another flaw the Broncos’ defense noticed over its first three weeks is allowing quarterbacks to scramble for first downs, specifically on long-distance downs. They’ve worked to correct that this week.

- “It’s being more gap disciplined on third down,” Ray said. “Teams know that we’re playing man coverage, so quarterbacks start trying to get out of the pocket. When they see that lane, they take off running. We see that. We know what’s going on. We’re just going to go to the film room and see what we can do to counter that.”

- “Every play is a pass for me,” Talib said. “I’m going to play the pass and react to the run.”",2016-09-28 01:24:12+00:00,d84xeh1,1.0,t3_54tyzl,211,DenverBroncos
679,"Some good stuff from the article:

- “You try to use the month of September as much as possible to help kind of get that learning curve going,” Malone said. “But the fact that a lot of these guys have a full year under me, a summer league or two under me, they know what we’re doing, what we’re trying to do, who we are and what we’re trying to be about.”

- It was a contact practice, the first of two Nuggets practices on Monday. The Nuggets have three days of two-a-day practices here in Omaha, with one each day a “contact” practice. The other, such as Monday night’s practice, is saved for heavier drill work but no intense scrimmaging.

- “I loved it,” Malone said. “We made it a point of emphasis to really practice how you play. So we went around 90-95 minutes after (stretching), but intense. The guys really competed. I thought they brought it. You can tell guys are coming into camp in shape, which I think is a sign of good things to come. But I just loved the energy in the gym.”

- Defensively, Malone is tweaking things so the Nuggets do a better job guarding the 3-point line. Offensively, the Nuggets are all about pace, but not in the traditional basketball sense of the term.

- “Pace is not just running up and down the court,” Malone said. “That is often misconstrued. Pace is playing with purpose, making quick decisions and being quick in everything that you do. That was a big point of emphasis.”

- “It’s a talented team,” Emmanuel Mudiay said. “It’s actually real talented. You’ve got people in here that can give you 30 (points) night in and night out. We’ve just got to figure out how we’re going to put all of that together.”",2016-09-28 01:04:11+00:00,d84wlmi,1.0,t3_54tw40,142,denvernuggets

704,"Some good stuff from the article:

- For Kubiak, what said it all was a third-and-3 play in the first quarter when Siemian felt pressure, didn’t panic, kept his eyes up while running, used a couple of hop steps then dived for a 5-yard gain and a first down. “You see a lot of good quarterbacks that may not be 4.6, 4.7 quarterbacks (in the 40-yard dash) speed-wise, but they’re really good because when they move they keep making plays. Their eyes stay up,” Kubiak said. “And you’ll see some real good athletes that can move, but once they do move you can go get them because their eyes don’t stay (looking downfield). It’s something that you do naturally. He seems to have a knack for it. Hopefully he’ll hang on to it.”

- What most impressed offensive tackle Russell Okung was Denver’s final touchdown drive Sunday that started with the team up by five points and Siemian hoping to put the Bengals away. Siemian was aggressive, throwing a 29-yard completion to tight end Jeff Heuerman. Then, on third-and-11, he threw the “go for the gusto” pass down the left sideline to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas for a 55-yard touchdown play. Okung has seen enough from Siemian through three games to compare him to the quarterback he played with in Seattle, Russell Wilson.

- “He’s cold as ice,” Okung said of Siemian. “Those are the biggest similarities I see in the two. That showed a lot of fortitude on his part. He could have easily went for the first down, but instead he wanted to go for the big play.”

- What stood out to running back C.J. Anderson was a play early in the fourth quarter with the Broncos deep in their territory and trailing by one point. Siemian was looking for Thomas on a screen pass, a play similar to one that he had been intercepted on twice this season. Siemian gave two pump fakes to Bengals defensive end Carlos Dunlap, then scrambled for a 1-yard gain.

- “You can tell that he’s learning from his mistakes. That’s the most impressive thing,” Anderson said.

- Siemian easily had the best performance of his young career, finishing Sunday’s game with a terrific 132.1 passer rating. He put on his best show when it mattered the most — the fourth quarter, going 9-of-10 for 149 yards and two touchdowns and a perfect 158.3 passer rating. The fourth quarter has been Siemian’s time to shine. He has a 146.9 passer rating in the fourth quarter of the first three games, easily the best in the NFL.

- “Just the way he looks at pressure and how he responds in critical situations, he doesn’t look really frantic,” Okung said. “He has somewhat of a quiet confidence. He brings calmness to his teammates in a high-pressure situation. We know our quarterback is ready to make the big play.”

- Siemian’s success in the clutch hasn’t been limited to the fourth quarter. The Broncos were 6-of-12 on third-down conversion attempts Sunday, including many of the game’s biggest plays — the touchdown by Thomas, Siemian’s 41-yard touchdown throw to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders in the second quarter and the aforementioned first-quarter rush for 5 yards. The Broncos rank fifth in the NFL in third-down conversions, at 48.5-percent. A year ago they were at 37.5 percent.

- “Your confidence continues to grow and I’m not just talking about myself, I’m talking about all of us. As coaches, we see how he can handle things,” Kubiak said. “We’re getting a lot of comfort watching him keep up and handle the team. With that, there’s growth coming. And obviously, turning him loose in situations, I’m feeling better about his decision-making process.”",2016-09-27 14:34:52+00:00,d844o8l,1.0,t3_54qu3b,143,DenverBroncos

Not trying to force anything but letting my body to do the work instead of trying to force things directionally or hang time.’

- Would Dixon admit to feeling some pressure late in the preseason and early in the regular season when he was given the job but his punting was inconsistent? “Yeah, I’d say a little but I made it a competition with myself to be the best punter I could be,’’ he said. “Every day that’s what I’m trying to do.’’

- “I knew he wasn’t going to go fair catch it and I saw him try to turn it up and I said I’ve got to try and deliver a hit,’’ Zaire Anderson said. “I put my helmet to the ball, like his ribs. That’s my first time doing something like that. Make a play on special teams.’’

- Broncos defensive end Derek Wolfe was struggling after the game with heat blisters on the bottom of his feet. And he didn’t play shoe-less. “There’s nothing you can do,’’ Wolfe said. “Except complain about it.’’

- “That was T.J. on the tip, and I was able to break on the ball and get it,’’ Parks said. ""I can’t believe I got my first career interception. Definitely not going to be my last. You just sit back and think: ‘We used to watch TV and say, ‘Dang, he got an interception, he got an interception!’ Now another kid is saying that about you. I mean I’m definitely blessed that’s for sure. That was huge.’’

- Clearly, the Bengals concentrated on stopping the run which opened up the pass. “If that’s how you want to put it,’’ Anderson said. “Nah, I put everything on me. I need to play better but I’m happy with the win. I’m not going to say this is terrible. I still made plays in the game in areas where people might not see. I’m happy with the win. We’re 3-0, we just won a tough one on the road.’’

- The Bengals came in ranked 32nd or last, in defending the run, so it was a point of emphasis. And then Siemian burned them for four touchdowns and 312 yards through the air. “I’m pretty sure the Bengals came in and said, ‘If we let Trevor Siemian beat us we got to live with it,’’ Anderson said. “That’s what happened today.’’

- Last week, Michael Schofield played a quarter of right guard and the rest of the game at right tackle. Against the Bengals, Schofield played a couple series at left tackle and the rest at right guard. Three offensive line positions in two weeks. “I played all over in training camp,’’ Schofield said. “That really helped me out.’’",2016-09-26 01:59:15+00:00,d8248r0,1.0,t3_54idzr,265,DenverBroncos

- Todd Davis doesn’t quite know how he got the name or why he’s sporting it now, but it stuck and he’s keeping it. Davis is known as “Thunder,” a nickname bestowed upon him by fellow Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, who labeled himself “Lightning.”

- “I think I just like the heat and playing in the run game,” said Davis, wearing a wide grin. “I think that’s how I got it.”

- “I have to show 31 other teams who didn’t see something in me that I have it,” Davis said. “I definitely feel like there’s a chip on my shoulder. Being undrafted really did help me. It pushed me to elevate my game to the next level. I feel like I have to prove everybody wrong.”

- “You see the flashing lights and you can forget what brought you here. If you don’t play well on the field, those lights will dim real quick.”- Todd Davis

- “Sometimes (Todd and I) have a play in practice or a play in the game and we’ll go to the sideline and discuss it, whereas sometimes with me and Danny we wouldn’t have to because it would almost be automatic, like, ‘Bam, OK, we got it,’ ” Marshall said. “Me and Todd will get there. Sometimes we see things differently, whereas, if we’re comparing the two, me and Danny usually saw things a lot of the same.”

- Davis said he watched more film than he ever had before to meticulously pick apart plays and technique, and to watch Trevathan and Marshall at work to hone his skill and decision-making. Davis also lost weight to improve his quickness and endurance, and he heeded the advice of Marshall.

- “He just mostly tells me what he sees and things that he looks for,” Davis said. “Keys and tendencies that he’s learned over the years of playing and starting that you don’t learn unless you’re in the moment. So when the moment arrives, I’m like one step ahead. It helps me out a lot.”

- “I saw a new Todd Davis,” Marshall said. “He knew it was his time, because Danny went to the Bears. He knew he had a shot, so I think he really came out of his shell.”

- “Todd just exploded on the scene in practice, and you couldn’t deny the guy,” Marshall said.

- “I really think that when you’re a player and you’re a backup … you’re a special-teams player, you’re a good role player and then all of a sudden you get a chance because somebody leaves. It’s amazing to watch guys say, ‘I’m not going to let this go,’ ” Kubiak said. “And that’s what you see from Todd, and through the whole offseason it was extremely important to him to prove to the defense, ‘Hey, I can pick up the slack, hey I can do this.’ He’s done it.”",2016-09-23 15:46:54+00:00,d7yz3aw,1.0,t3_545bxd,210,DenverBroncos

Marshall has talked about an alleged run-in with Miami police on the night of July 4, when he said officers handcuffed him and threatened him with a Taser. Marshall said he was with acquaintances at a restaurant in the busy Bayside area of downtown Miami where there were reports of a shooting. As shown in images and video taken from the scene, chaos ensued as patrons fled and police raced to the scene.

Marshall said an unidentified woman was directing traffic and ordered police to stop him. Marshall said officers rushed toward him, handcuffed him and threatened to Taser him for resisting. Marshall said he sat in the back of the police car when another officer radioed in and said to release him.

- Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller already has 4 sacks this year. He’s never had that many through two games. Once, in 2012 he had three sacks this early. That was the year he had a career high 18.5 sacks.

- “I’ve never put six hours into one day, every single day,’’ Miller said. “Not even football. We practice for two hours. Six hours every single day. It made me consistent. It made me come to work every single day and work on something that I wasn’t really good at. When I come out here and play football, this is what I do. I’m a professional football player. So it’s easier for me to do this. And I think having to struggle with that has definitely helped me here.’’

- “I already had agility and flexibility but I think the consistent part,’’ Miller said. “Coming to work and doing something that I’m not good at. On Mondays coming in and doing that in front of millions of people and having Witney really depend on me to get my job done. That’s the correlation that it has on the football field.

- “The first thing that you see – and it takes two seconds to see it – when you see Trevor throwing the ball, the guy’s got a cannon,” former Bronco and Super Bowl 50 champion Tyler Polumbus said on CBS Sports Radio’s After Hours with Amy Lawrence. “And he throws about the most clean spiral of any quarterback I’ve ever seen, of any quarterback I’ve been around – especially going from Peyton Manning, who was known to throw a duck or two, a wobbly pass that somehow got to the right guy at the right time every time. But Trevor is about the opposite of that. It’s the most consistent spiral I’ve ever seen. He’s got a cannon of an arm. But more than that, he’s a very bright quarterback. He’s a very bright young man. He’s a Northwestern graduate, and Gary Kubiak loves that because he’s able to throw the whole scheme at Trevor and not have to worry about dialing back the play calls and not having to worry abut how much can Trevor absorb every week. He knows he can throw it all at Trevor and Trevor will absorb it all.""

- “So he’s a very bright young man, he’s got a heck of an arm, and so far, honestly, count me in the Trevor Siemian fan club,” Polumbus continued. “I think he’s done a phenomenal job through his first two starts. There’s a lot of people out there that are dogging him right now. I honestly think they he’s done a very good job. He’s managed this team well, he’s using the strengths of the team well, which is the running game, and then the passing game, he’s done really well. He’s had three interceptions in two games, and I’m sure he would like to improve that number. But take a couple bad plays out, and he’s played really good football.”

- “C.J.’s coming out with fire that I didn’t necessarily see him playing with last year,” Polumbus said. “C.J., he’s been the heart and soul of this team. He’s brought the spark offensively. In Game 1, the Broncos went about five or six straight passes to open up the game, and then they hand the ball off to C.J. and he rumbles off for 14 yards. He became the spark that the offense needed in Game 1. And then in Game 2, he just continued to do his thing. He is rumbling, he is rolling, he’s playing like one of the best running backs in the NFL right now.”",2016-09-22 15:49:39+00:00,d7xkq47,1.0,t3_53zlkc,50,DenverBroncos

- “We had a point in time in Houston where we had a package where we would put three tight ends on the field, one wide receiver and one running back and we could run our whole offense out of it,” said Joel Dreessen, a former Broncos and Texans tight end who played under Kubiak in Houston from 2007-11. “We would line up everybody tight, and then we’d shift to empty and we really liked that because of the matchups that it gave us. We had Owen (Daniels), myself, Garrett Graham, James Casey. We would go to this package and we made a lot of yards, whether it was the running game, play-action pass or drop-back pass. I think Coach Kubiak would like to get to that if he had enough bodies at tight end.”

- Through the first two games, the Broncos have used two-tight-end sets only five times, the second-fewest in the NFL. They’ve used three tight-end sets only twice, to rank 23rd. In seven of his nine seasons with the Texans and Baltimore Ravens, Kubiak’s teams ranked in the top 12 in both categories.

- Justin Simmons should have gained some locker-room cred this week when it was discovered he played at least three quarters with a broken left hand Sunday in the Denver Broncos’ 34-20 win against the Indianapolis Colts. A rookie safety, Simmons suffered the injury when his hand got caught in a face mask. It wasn’t until after the game the fracture was discovered. Simmons figures he played about 35 of his 40 defensive snaps with his broken hand. 

- ""It was just one of those freak accidents,"" Simmons said. ""It wasn't totally bothersome. … Now it's just about making sure the bones heal right and that it's not an injury that keeps you out even longer."" Simmons practiced with a cast on a limited basis Wednesday. The Broncos may list him as questionable for their game this Sunday against Cincinnati but there’s a reason why the team re-signed strong safety Shiloh Keo this week.

- Sambrailo, who is capable of playing right guard and both tackle positions, has not played since Game 3 of his rookie year last season because of a torn left shoulder (last year) and hyperextended right elbow (this year). Kubiak indicated Sambrailo, Michael Schofield and Darrion Weems could all get work on the right side. “I can see us getting into a rotation-type thing,’’ Kubiak said of the offensive line. “We have our seven and will probably play them all, actually.’’

- With starting tight end Virgil Green also suffering a strained calf, the Broncos are expected to have Jeff Heuerman make his NFL debut this Sunday. Heuerman, a second-round draft pick in 2015 who has not played because of a torn ACL (last year) and sprained hamstring and ankle (this year), and John Phillips were the Broncos’ only healthy tight ends practicing Wednesday.

- “I think watching (Sambrailo and Heuerman) practice Thursday and Friday has a lot to do with how I feel about them,’’ Kubiak said. “But I think they’re ready to go if they keep making the right progressions.’’

- Backup receiver Bennie Fowler (fractured elbow) also practiced on a limited basis Wednesday.

- “I think the thing that stands out is the pass rush obviously,’’ Cincinnati quarterback Andy Dalton said in his conference call with the Denver media Wednesday. “They’ve done a great job getting to the quarterback. They have eight sacks in two weeks and you see that stand out.’’

- Bronco players held their annual union meeting Wednesday afternoon with NFL Players Association boss DeMaurice Smith.

- Siemian’s three picks this year have come at the opponents’ 20, 25 and 30-yard lines. Two of those interceptions came on what are usually safe throws -- the horizontal pass along the line of scrimmage.

- “We were joking earlier, some of my picks I request I would have got my money’s worth, maybe throwing the ball downfield or something,’’ Siemian said.

- “He’s made some poor decisions I would say athletic decisions, I know that sounds kind of crazy,’’ said Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak. “But it’s just learning, Trevor that guy can make that play. It’s not college anymore you’re not going to throw that ball through that guy. So I think it’s speed of the game factors that he’s beginning to understand and make him better each week.’’

- “The past two games it’s been good and it’s been bad,’’ Broncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders said of Siemian. “But that’s what you expect out of a young quarterback. He’s made his mistakes in the red zone but it’s not just him. I’ve made mistakes, offensive line has made their mistakes. Last week we had opportunities to score a touchdown but a couple guys made mistakes. It’s going to happen. It’s early in the season, everybody is making mistakes.’’

- “There’s some frustration but at the end of the day it’s hard to be frustrated when you’re sitting here 2-0,’’ Sanders said. “At the end of day I could sit up here and make it all about me and Demaryius we’re used to having 100-yard games, we’re used to scoring touchdowns, we’re used to doing this but we’re sitting here 2-0. We’ve got the No. 1-ranked defense. Offensively, we’re getting better. We’re better than what we were last year. And I’m happy. It’s all about getting to the playoffs and winning championships and right now we’re on that path. Obviously team goals come before individual goals. Individually, yeah, I would like to be having my highlights run on ESPN. And yeah I would like to have a 100-yard game and be ranked in the top 5. But we’re sitting here 2-0.’’

- “That’s understandable, right?’’ he said. “Receivers, they want the ball, they want to make plays, especially our guys, and they’re two of the best in the business. We want to give those guys opportunities to make plays so I think it’s understandable. Everybody is working really hard to get wins, which we’re doing and get better. That’s the exciting part, too, there’s room for improvement, and we’re still winning. Understandable, though.”

- “I feel like if it doesn’t keep working maybe we should change it up,’’ Sanders said. “Maybe pass more, or call different pass plays. But at the end of the day that’s going to come with time. We face Cincinnati. Hopefully we can go down there and erase that whole red-zone stigma that we have right now that we can’t score in the red zone and we can go down there and put up a lot of points.’’

- But here’s something else to consider: We football insiders overanalyze red zone efficiency. The Broncos were 28th in red zone by finishing with touchdowns just 46.2 percent of the time last year. They won the Super Bowl. They rank 27th in red zone with a 33.3 percent efficiency this year. But Indianapolis and Buffalo are tied for first and they’re both 0-2. ",2016-09-22 01:02:05+00:00,d7wuu20,1.0,t3_53wgki,646,DenverBroncos

- ""I want him [Siemian] to be able to look to the left and see me and look to the right and see Demaryius and say, 'I can count on these guys,'"" Sanders said.

- ""That's understandable, right?"" Siemian said of the receivers' frustration. ""They want the ball. They are two of the best in the business. We want to give them opportunities.

- “He’s really important,” head coach Gary Kubiak said Wednesday. “Russell has been around winning, and he’s been a really good player, so that is what you want on your team.”

-  “He’s looking like vintage Russell Okung to me,” practice opponent Von Miller told BSN Denver. “He’s looking back like that Russell Okung coming out of Oklahoma State, in my opinion.”

- “I think Russell is coming. I think he is going to play even better as we go,” the coach said. “He has not missed a snap so I think you will see Russell improve in what we do, condition and all those things.”

- “Russell has been a great leader,” fellow lineman Michael Schofield declared Wednesday. “If something is going wrong, he is the guy that rights the ship. He’s been in every situation so he’s the vocal leader and he is a physical leader; he is dominating.”

- “He’s the same leader from the Seahawks, it’s just a different team,” the Super Bowl MVP said emphatically. “He’s the leader of the offensive line, not just that; he’s our tough guy. Your best offensive lineman is supposed to be one of your toughest guys, and he is definitely that. He is wise beyond his years.

764,"Some good stuff from the article:

- “He’s top five, for sure,” Broncos cornerback Chris Harris said. “He makes a lot of big plays. He’s very quiet on the field. He’s not like these other big-time receivers that you see who get a first down, start dancing. A.J. is very simple. He’s going to make the nice catch on you and give the ball back.”

- “He’s going to make plays so you just can’t get down on yourself. You just have to keep fighting, keep attacking them,” Harris said. “A lot of guys come out and play with fear with him, they don’t challenge him. We’re going to challenge him and make him work for all his catches.”

- “He has great hands and can go up and make tough catches. He’s so talented on the field and he’s so level-headed off the field,” Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton said of Green. “You feel like he matches up well against anybody.”

- The Broncos are confident in their ability to have any of their top cornerbacks — Chris Harris, Aqib Talib and Bradley Roby — as Green’s main defender on a given play. Talib likely will see Green the most because of his size (6-1, 205) and physicality. Still, Denver is aware Green likely will require more safety help than it traditionally gives to receivers.

- The last time these two teams played, Week 16 of last season in Denver, the Broncos held quarterback AJ McCarron (Dalton was out with a fractured thumb) to 200 passing yards. Green had five catches for 57 yards and a touchdown.

- “These games always leave a mark on playoff seeds,” Harris said. “These are playoff-type games. That’s how we approach them.”",2016-09-21 21:49:55+00:00,d7wmudh,1.0,t3_53vmt1,142,DenverBroncos

776,"Some good stuff from the article:

- “We had a lot of productivity on offense: 24 first downs, 400 yards and 6.2 yards a play,” Kubiak said. “We were very productive. I’d take that every week. Hopefully we can produce like that, move the ball like that.”

- And he wasn’t done. He added: “We had nine drives. I think seven times we went inside the 35 or something like that. We’ve punted five times in two weeks. So there’s some good ball movement going on.”

- The Broncos’ offense, though, seemed to stutter through two weeks — especially the passing game, averaging 212.5 yards, ranking 26th in the NFL. Denver ranks ninth in the NFL in scoring, at 27.5 points per game. But the defense scored twice Sunday. Take away those points, and the Broncos’ offense ranks 19th in points.

- “It’s a little worrisome,” veteran wide receiver Demaryius Thomas said. “You can’t keep kicking field goals. It’s any given Sunday, Monday or Thursday. One day a team might come out and score three touchdowns on our defense, and if we kick five field goals, we lose the game.

- “We’ve got to figure out what we can do to get in the end zone,” Thomas said.

- First, the good: The Broncos, behind bullish running back C.J. Anderson, compiled 282 net yards rushing through two games, more than double their total of 130 through two games a year ago. Denver has revamped its running game behind a more settled offensive line. And with new starting quarterback Trevor Siemian, the Broncos have 425 net yards passing, an increase from Peyton Manning’s 388 yards through two weeks in 2015.

- Now, the bad: The Broncos, against the Carolina Panthers and Indianapolis Colts, scored a touchdown on only 33 percent of their trips inside the 20-yard line. That ranks 26th in the NFL. And Siemian in two weeks has thrown only five passes that gained more than 20 yards, ranking 21st. But four of those passes were short, with long gains from a receiver after the catch; the longest was Thomas’ 44-yard gain Sunday on a 1-yard bubble screen.

- “Being able to run the ball obviously opens up the pass,” said Broncos wide receiver Jordan Taylor, who caught Siemian’s completion that traveled farthest Sunday, a 20-yarder in the second quarter. “I know we’re going to continue trying to run the ball the rest of the year. We want to get more balls down the field and get some deep catches, but those will come.”

- “You’re not too predictable offensively as far as where he’s trying to go all the time,” Kubiak said of his quarterback. “You’re attacking a defense and doing what you should be doing against a defense.”

- “It’s a big body and there is a lot of moving parts,” manager Walt Weiss said. “Carlos has simplified the delivery, is what he’s done.”

- “I think I am doing better and I never thought I was a bad pitcher like some people were saying,” Estevez said. “I never lost confidence I could do the job.”

- Asked what Estevez needs to work on during the offseason and in spring training, Weiss answered: “The ability to repeat his delivery is at or near the top of that list. The command is tied to that. We have seen outings where the command has gotten away from him and he’s gotten into trouble. That’s the biggest thing.”",2016-09-11 16:08:15+00:00,d7iadbi,1.0,t3_5296cj,125,ColoradoRockies

I mean, he’s a top player in football – they are designed runs for him. You better tackle him like a back. You better treat him that way or you’re going to have a long night as a defensive football team.”

- “It was just me being aggressive. He lowered his head at the last moment. It was nothing I could really do about that at that point,” Stewart said. “I’ve been getting a lot of hell for that. I’m not going to stop being aggressive. I wasn’t sure if he was running it or what he was doing? I’m always thinking he’s running it with a player like that. So I was just trying to be aggressive and make him feel me.”

- Stewart said he expects to be fined for the hit on Newton because nearly every helmet hit on a quarterback is fined, but he won’t change his play. 

- “It’s tough, man. The guy is a big-(behind) tight end, defensive end playing quarterback. What are we supposed to do? We can hit him in the legs sometimes, but his legs are strong,” Marshall said. “We’re going to treat him like a running back. You have to hit him.”

- “We hear everybody says about us being dirty, but we’re not going to stop being aggressive,” Stewart said. “That’s what we try to bring every week to make everybody fear us.”

- “How much there was (illegal contact to head), I disagree with that. I saw two plays where he left the pocket where there were big collisions. There were a lot of collisions in the game,” Kubiak said. “We were playing hard. They were playing hard. They knocked the heck out of us a lot too.

“I’m going to get a lot of scrutiny and I understand that. In the eyes of a lot of people, I’ll be respected. In the eyes of most people, I’ll be hated,” said Marshall, who is one of the most well liked Broncos players. “I was thinking I could lose endorsements. I could lose likability. I could lose my credibility in my community when I want to do things. I could lose that. But I’m a man of faith and I really prayed about it for a lot of days.

817,"Bryant suffered an offseason pectoral injury away from the team, which allows the Browns to pay not a penny of his $6 million salary. Per a source with knowledge of the situation, the Browns nevertheless will pay Bryant $1.25 million for 2016. The decision follows extensive negotiations over the past month between the team and agent Drew Rosenhaus.

For next year, when Bryant is due to earn a non-guaranteed base salary of $7 million at age 31 and with the Browns embarked on a youth movement so obvious and extensive that Creed Bratton has once again dunked his head in toner, he has agreed to drop his salary to $3 million, with the balance potentially coming from $500,000 in 46-man per-game roster bonuses and playing-time incentives that total up to $3.5 million, if he participates in 75 percent of the defensive snaps in 2017.

So Bryant gets $1.25 million he wouldn’t have earned under the circumstances, and his compensation in 2017 will be tied to his ability to suit up and play.",2016-09-09 17:48:59+00:00,d7fwz66,1.0,t3_51yono,30,nfl

Any time I put the full pads on, I didn’t think about getting hurt. I didn’t go three-quarters speed, half speed, to take care of myself.”

Denver (XXXIII) went from John Elway to Brian Griese in 1999. And Baltimore (XXXV) went from Trent Dilfer to Elvis Grbac, in 2001. On Thursday, Siemian will be the fourth, taking over for Peyton Manning after Super Bowl 50.

- **1:** Time Super Bowl participants from a previous season have faced off in Week 1. Kansas City and Minnesota met in Super Bowl IV, then met in the 1970 opener (Sept. 20, 1970) at Minnesota.

- **5:** Sacks needed by outside linebacker Von Miller (60) to move past Lyle Alzado (64.5) and rank No. 5 on the Broncos’ all-time list. Simon Fletcher (97.5), Karl Mecklenburg (79), Barney Chavous (75) and Rulon Jones (73.5) round out the top five.

- **2:** Sacks needed by outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware (134.5) to pass Jared Allen and Julius Peppers (136) and move into ninth place on the league’s all-time list. Ware needs 7.5 to moved past Michael Strahan (141.5) and into No. 5 on the list.

- **1:** Victory needed by coach Gary Kubiak to tie defensive coordinator Wade Phillips (16 wins from 1993-94) for seventh place on the all-time list for a Broncos head coach.

- **7:** Catches needed by receiver Demaryius Thomas (456 career receptions) to pass Ed McCaffrey (462) for the fourth-most in Broncos history. Thomas needs 252 receiving yards to move past Lionel Taylor (6,872) at No. 3 and nine receiving touchdowns to move past Shannon Sharpe (55 TDs) at No. 2, respectively, on the team’s all-time lists.

- **82:** Rushing yards needed by running back C.J. Anderson (1,607 career yards) to move past Olandis Gary, Gaston Green and Gerald Willhite and into 15th place on the Broncos’ all-time list.

- **62:** Combined years of coordinator experience — Wade Phillips (25 years), Joe DeCamillis (24), Rick Dennison (13) — on the Broncos’ staff, the most in the league.

- **5:** Consecutive AFC West titles for the Broncos (2011-15), tied with Oakland (1972-76) for most in the division.

- **30:** Aqib Talib’s career interceptions, the most of any cornerback since he entered the NFL in 2008.",2016-09-06 20:54:46+00:00,d7by8zq,1.0,t3_51hbbp,1053,DenverBroncos

- Broncos’ receiver Bennie Fowler III did not practice Sunday which means he it’s unlikely he will play Thursday against the Panthers. Fowler has been out since suffering a fractured right elbow.

870,"**Stay healthy, Paxton**

The first-round rookie doesn’t have to play great. It would help, but more importantly is he comes out healthy. If Lynch finishes in good shape, the Broncos may move on from veteran Mark Sanchez. If there’s concern about Lynch after this game, Sanchez could be asked back at a pay reduction from his scheduled $4.5 million salary.

**Win the job**

Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak said there will be two or three players who will win a 53-man roster spot based on their performance in this game. Others may lose their tenuous hold. Among the players fighting for a roster spot tonight are Ronnie Hillman, Kapri Bibbs, Juwan Thompson, Jordan Taylor, Kalif Raymond, Taurean Nixon, John Phillips, Henry Melton, Kyle Peko, Billy Winn, Kyle Kragen and Ryan Murphy.

**Prove it, Riley**

The only starters who will play this game are the Broncos’ three specialists: Kicker Brandon McManus, punter Riley Dixon and long snapper Casey Kreiter. Dixon, a draft-pick rookie from Syracuse, will be punting for the first time since the Broncos released his competitor, Britton Colquitt, the six-year incumbent.

**Avoid the Syd’Quan Thompson**

In Josh McDaniels’ doomed season of 2010, seventh-round rookie cornerback Syd’Quan Thompson was a preseason surprise who was going to make the Broncos’ season-opening 53-man roster. And then Thompson suffered a torn Achilles in the Broncos’ final preseason game at Minnesota. Thompson played a couple years in the Arena League but never did play a game in the NFL.

**Run the ball**

A game like this, when only desperate, second- and third-stringers are playing, you want to play as conservatively as possible. The Broncos should go heavier on Bibbs’ runs than Lynch throws.

**McManus groove**

Understandably, it took a while for Broncos placekicker Brandon McManus to get used to new holder Riley Dixon after having so much success with Britton Colquitt. But McManus was perfect in three placekicks last week with Dixon holding and since he has to kick tonight, he might as well make them.

**Stop the run**

Denver’s second-string defense has been vulnerable to the big run, most notably while allowing a 73-yard run to the Rams’ Terrence Magee last week.

**Keep the starters well back**

About 25 Broncos regulars will work out before the game, but not dress for the game. There’s no reason for them to toe up to the field of play where accidental collisions can happen.

**Play like it’s your last game**

There will be 22 players removed from the Broncos’ roster with the next 48 hours. Perhaps a handful of those cut player will never play again.",2016-09-01 20:12:13+00:00,d75umwi,1.0,t3_50p8p5,442,DenverBroncos

874,"His message is:

Hey everyone,

As most of you guys know, I had a season ending injury a week ago. I tore my anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) along with some other things. Needless to say it has been the single most painful experience I've ever had to endure. With the pain of the injury not being so much physical, but more mental. I hadn't said much to all my fans and friends because of the hurt I was going through. The idea that a guy like myself, who's NEVER been hurt, has to sit out a season for that very reason. That after all the work I've done this off-season, I wont be out there with my team mates.... my friends. After alot of reflection and humbling in the past few days though, I realize I have SO much to be thankful for. Not even the fact that people would say ive been ""blessed"" up unto this point, but to me, its the fact I have been able to be a blessing for others. Thats all I ever wanted. Im thankful for all my fans and the people who took time out of their day, to worry and send well wishes to someone they've never met. Or my friends, who kept up and watched over me even if I only said a total of 5 sentences through out high school in Fort Mill.

My point is that I appreciate each and every last one of you for your thoughts and prayers. I will be back. Stronger and more agile than ever. In body but more importantly in mind and spirit. If someone told me one of my biggest struggles would be an acl injury 10 years ago, I'd say that would be a blessing. There's so much going on in the world today, a football injury is really miniscule in the grand scheme of things. I just ask that we all pray and continue to help everyone else who are less fortunate because to me, that is where it truly matters. I'll be just fine. Surgery in the next few weeks (which I'm not really looking forward to) and then it's all downhill. I'm in a much better place and I want you all to be as well. 
And of course... GO BRONCOS

Much love and prayers to all

It’s not much of a difference. I’ve just got to open up my mind and see the bigger picture.

878,"Former NFL athletic trainer Mike Ryan, who now serves as NBC Sports Medicine Analyst, explained via email that the dislocation likely occurred after the ACL tear make the entire joint unstable.

“Mechanically speaking, the knee joint is formed by the long thigh bone (femur) resting on top of the main shin bone (tibia),” Ryan explained. “Because the knee joint is structurally unstable and very dependent on ligaments for stability, the rupturing of a main ligament(s) leaves the knee joint vulnerable to a dislocation. The Anterior Cruciate Ligament’s two main functions are to stabilize the shin bone directly under the thigh bone and, secondly, to minimize internal rotation of that shin bone. Therefore, when the ACL is torn, the knee ‘buckles’ inward and quickly becomes grossly unstable. As in the case of Teddy’s injury, the stress of a collapsing body over a now-unstable knee joint is enough to dislocate the knee joint.”",2016-08-31 16:42:20+00:00,d746kou,1.0,t3_50i4pm,16,nfl

880,"The lawyer representing the class of players who settled with the NFL has issued a statement to the contrary.

“We believe the Supreme Court should deny the appellants’ petition, as these objections have now been exhaustively examined and overruled by the both the District Court and the Third Circuit,” lawyer Christopher Seeger said in a press release. “Despite the fact that the claims process has not opened due to delays caused by these appeals, more than 9,000 retired players have sought enrollment in the settlement’s benefits. These appeals come with devastating consequences for the thousands of retired NFL players suffering from neurocognitive injuries and effectively stand between truly injured retired players and their sole prospect for obtaining benefits while still alive. While we are pleased several appellants have decided against petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court, it is clear the few lawyers still objecting to this settlement have motives other than what is in the best interest of the retired NFL player community. We hope the Court will reject this appeal and affirm the settlement so former players can finally receive the care and support they urgently need.”

We didn’t really understand it much, we didn’t know what we were doing, we just threw the deep ball every time. That was the first insight to football that I had.’’

- Gotsis was so enticing he had Broncos defensive line coach Bill Kollar asking coach Gary Kubiak every day before the draft if the team was going to select him (before they even said hello), what with the benefit of rare upside for a player still learning the game. Gotsis first played American football, he said, “when I just turned 14, so I think I signed up when I was 13 and played just after I turned 14.’’ It was a club team in what he said was an eight-team league in the Melbourne area.

- “I didn’t play much at first because everybody was 18 and shaving and I was 14,’’ Gotsis said. “Then when I was 17, I moved up and there were 35-year-olds out there and I was 17. After the first bit, it kind of gave me confidence because these guys were men -- 25, 27, 30, 35 years old -- and I was 17 and doing all right. But these dudes were bigger than me, stronger than me and I was still doing pretty well, I thought I might have a shot at this.’’

- Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips has said, “I see a big guy who can move like a smaller guy.’’

- And linebacker Von Miller said after seeing Gotsis work in one recent practice that “Gotsis is looking incredible out there.’’

- “But I think right now, after everything to get to this point, right now it’s about football,’’ Gotsis said. “It’s about me learning, getting better, getting smarter, but it’s just about football and I like that.’’",2016-08-31 13:08:31+00:00,d73xdrk,1.0,t3_50h1t5,488,DenverBroncos

926,"- **Keep him but cut his pay**

Keeping Sanchez at his current $4.5 million salary is not an option, even if $1 million is guaranteed and the team would have to absorb a $1 million cap hit in “dead money.” 

Still, $4.5 million is too rich for a No. 3 quarterback for every team but the Philadelphia Eagles.

The Broncos, though, are going to need a third quarterback. And with Siemian and Lynch having no prior regular-season pass attempts, it would make sense if that third quarterback had playing experience.

No veteran quarterback will come in knowing the Gary Kubiak offensive system better than Sanchez. Knowing Sanchez' dedication and hunger to play quarterback, he would accept a pay cut to stay.

- **Trade him**

Maybe the Dallas Cowboys would be interested now that Tony Romo has a broken back. The Cowboys’ starting quarterback is Dak Prescott, a rookie who wasn’t drafted until the fourth round.

Or maybe Sanchez’s old college coach, Pete Carroll, would let bygones be bygones at his former quarterback's decision to go pro after his junior season and execute a USC reunion in Seattle. The Seahawks have no experience behind Russell Wilson and they run a similar offense to that of the Broncos.

- **Release him**

This is the most likely option if only because trades are difficult to execute, especially when they involve a player scheduled to make a little bit of money. Besides Sanchez’s salary, the team would also not have to surrender its seventh-round draft pick to Philadelphia – the condition if Sanchez makes the 53-man roster.

This may have been the primary reason why the Broncos didn’t play Sanchez against the Rams. To wit: They needed to keep him healthy so they could release him without risking having to pay a larger portion of his salary.

In this scenario, the Broncos would have to sign another quarterback. There figure to be some veterans cut within the next six days.

Matt Moore, EJ Manuel, Joe Webb, Colt McCoy and Josh Johnson might be among those available. And there may also be a surprise or two cut.

- “They’ve been trying to cut me for a while,” Hillman said with a smile. “I’m just trying to give the coaches something to think about.’’

- “Ronnie is in a battle, I think everybody knows that,” said Broncos coach Gary Kubiak. “Kapri (Bibbs, the No. 4 back) has done some good things and Ronnie has responded as a player the last two weeks. That’s what you’re looking for. I’m very proud of him, he did some good stuff tonight.’’

- “I just take it one day at a time and  try to give the coaches something that will  impress them  and  trying to  take advantage of opportunity when  I do get it,’’ Hillman said. “Just wanting to be a good teammate.’’

- “Usually they tell you a little sooner but I knew all week that could be a possibility,’’ Colquitt said. “I’ve only punted six times (in the first two preseason games), he had only punted five times. You can’t take a chance on somebody if you haven’t seen him punt. I had a feeling that would probably happen, which is fine.’’

- We’ll see what God has planned,” Colquitt said. “God’s got me this far so I’m putting everything in his hands and we don’t have control over anything, anyway.’’

- “I was a little disappointed,’’ Rams coach Jeff Fisher said of Talib’s hit. “You don’t like to see that happen, especially in the preseason.’’

- I’m playing football,” Talib said. “Guy running with the ball inbounds, that’s what you’re supposed to do, you’re supposed to hit him. I was just playing football.

- It feels good, man,’’ Miller said. “Sacks are what I’m supposed to do. That’s in the description.”

- “Just being able to go without thinking,’’ Watson said. “There have been a lot of teams where I have to think.  I’ve been waiting and wishing for an opportunity like, ‘What can’t I be just like Von?’ I remember being in Tampa and thinking why can’t you let me go? Von goes. He doesn’t have to think. He just goes. When can I have that opportunity? I never got it there. Now that I’m  here  and they’re telling me that I can go,  it’s lovely.’’

- Broncos’ receiver Cody Latimer said he is scheduled to have an MRI on his left knee Sunday.  Latimer was returning a punt when he took a hit directly on the knee. “We do not think it’s serious,” Kubiak said.

- “Going against a guy like Wolfe every day, that’s practice you can’t get anywhere else,” McGovern said. “Any little weakness those kind of guys are going to expose it.

932,"If you don't want to open the link:

**Seal it, Siemian**

A seventh-round afterthought to everyone except head coach Gary Kubiak in the competition to replace Peyton Manning, Siemian can officially stun the NFL universe with a solid, first-half performance against the Rams.

**Stay healthy**

Kubiak wants many of his starters to play the entire first half and one series into the second. The Broncos are already thin from injuries at right guard and tight end.

**Paxton outperforms Goff**

The Rams’ backup rookie quarterback, Jared Goff, was taken with the No. 1 overall draft pick. The Broncos’ rookie quarterback, Paxton Lynch, was taken No. 26 overall.

For what it’s worth, Lynch has put together the more encouraging performances through the first two preseason games.

Even if Lynch struggles some against the Rams in the second half, it’s playing time. And what he needs more than anything else is playing time.

**Run the ball**

It was Air Kubiak in the Broncos’ first two preseason games as the coach wanted to evaluate his quarterbacks with the pass, not the handoff. There should be a more concerted effort to get the zone-blocking, one-cut rushing system going against the Rams with C.J. Anderson, Devontae Booker and on-the-bubble Ronnie Hillman expected to get carries.

**Fill the void, Melton**

Vance Walker, who was going to replace Malik Jackson at left defensive end, went down with a torn ACL. Jared Crick is a hustling run-stopper who can fill in, but the Broncos are hoping Henry Melton, fresh off the street, can play as an inside pass rusher on third down. Melton will get a good look as Derek Wolfe is not expected to play.

**Colquitt, Dixon punt off**

Part III. The veteran Britton Colquitt has been the more consistent punter. The rookie Riley Dixon has a younger, and therefore stronger, leg, but he has been inconsistent. Still, Broncos bean counters may be privately pulling for the kid ($530,000 this year) than the vet ($3.25 million).

**Find a kickoff returner**

Slot receiver Jordan Norwood is set as the punt returner, but he only had two kickoff returns last year for a 14.5 yard average. With the two rookies, Kalif Raymond and Bralon Addison, struggling last week, the Broncos may look at Taurean Nixon and Cody Latimer as kickoff returners tonight.

**Contain Gurley, Austin**

In just 13 games last year, Rams running back Todd Gurley rushed for 1,106 yards and 10 touchdowns to earn NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. He’s had just four carries through the Rams’ first two preseason games, so he probably won’t get more than three or four against the Broncos.

The Rams may also give slot speedster Tavon Austin a touch or two.

965,"Some good stuff from the article:

- It is the Broncos’ “Bear” call. Sylvester Williams, a hulking, 313-pound nose tackle, the largest player on Denver’s defensive line, a guy who gets paid to get in the way, drops into pass coverage. “That ain’t normal,” Williams said. “But that’s one of my favorite plays.” His job on this play is to keep a running back from catching the ball. No defense ever asks a nose tackle to play like a cornerback. The Broncos are not like everyone else. “We’re different — a lot different,” he said.

- “They say they know what we’re going to do,” Phillips said, “but can they stop us?”

- “That’s our philosophy. Just do what the guy can do,” Phillips said. “I can think of a lot of different defenses. But it’s about what the players can do. I’ve always thought that way. When I coached in high school, some guys can’t play very well at all and you have to get by with what they can do. Maybe I got that from my dad. But when I started coaching, it just made sense to me that way.”

- “It is simple. That’s Wade’s goal. It allows you to just play,” Broncos cornerback Bradley Roby said. “The best defenses that I’ve seen, and the research that I’ve done, the common thing I get is they’re simple. Everybody knows their job, everybody knows their adjustments and everybody plays together. Wade’s defense, being simple, it allows our athletes to just go play.”

- “We play a matchup zone,” Phillips said, not afraid to reveal his playbook. “It looks like man until you pass him off to somebody else. We started it from basketball, way, way back. Everybody was playing 2-1-2 zone and if the ball went to one side, they stayed in place. But then later on they started moving over. We thought, “Well, we can do that. We’ve got five receivers going out, that’s the same concept as basketball.’ ”

- “It’s simple, but it’s not easy,” Roby said. “There’s a lot of pressure. The heat is on. But that pressure is what makes us work at our best. We’re used to being in man coverage when the game is on the line. When I was younger, in college, any time I’d get a man call, I’d be nervous. But not now.

- “In the end, it’s a one-on-one league. As a defense, we win those battles the majority of the time. If it’s a left tackle one-on-one with Von Miller, he’s winning that in two seconds. Teams have to catch us slipping, really.”

- “The true meaning of a blitz in football is six guys are rushing and five guys are covering five receivers,” Phillips said. “If a backer or a safety gets a sack, they usually say it’s a blitz. And there’s nothing wrong with that. But a dog (rush) is five people. And a four-man rush or a three-man rush is different.”

- “It’s simple — get to the ball,” Williams said. “That’s Wade’s No. 1 rule. Get to the ball. At the end of the day, if you get to the ball, you make plays, you do your job.”

- “We’re a play-making defense,” Williams said. “We’re designed to get up the field. We’re not holding up blocks. We’re not two-gap. We’re making plays. I love this defense.”

- “He’s got a lot of swag,” Williams said. “We have very few calls. He says to the defense, ‘Just make plays!’ That’s his mindset. He’ll call the call, then let us play football. It’s a player’s defense. Coach Wade is a genius, man. We trust him because he trusts us.”",2016-08-22 19:16:51+00:00,d6s8eo1,1.0,t3_4z27rl,281,DenverBroncos

- “We’ve got guys who are capable of filling in roles,” said Crick, a 6-foot-4, 285-pound end. “Everybody has to take the mindset that any time of day, they can go in and play well.”

- “He understands our defense,” Denver coach Gary Kubiak said. “So he’s fit in very quickly. Obviously he’ll move up the ladder now. That’s why we brought him in.”

- The Broncos also will consider rookies Adam Gotsis and Kyle Peko and third-year end Darius Kilgo as Walker replacements. Or they could settle into a rotation. The Broncos have three weeks of preseason to figure it out — or three weeks trying to dodge more injuries.

- “You’re always massaging positions, situations to get yourself to opening day,” Kubiak said.

- Kubiak and defensive coordinator Wade Phillips spoke at length about Zaire Anderson on the field Tuesday during a morning practice. Anderson is listed No. 2 on the Broncos’ depth chart at inside linebacker, behind Todd Davis.

- “He’s one of the players who has come along the furthest,” Kubiak said. “The only thing that held Zaire back is his total understanding of the defense, because he has to make calls. But his effort, how he plays, his reactions are really good, and now he understands the defense and you see a better player.”",2016-08-16 19:39:24+00:00,d6k4m7a,1.0,t3_4y1e98,185,DenverBroncos
986,"Key stuff from the article:

- Bowlen was a finalist in 2015, but lost out to Bill Polian and Ron Wolf. In 2016, former 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Sr. was the lone contributor selection. Bowlen again faced tough competition this year, but there was hope his success with the Broncos, contributions to the NFL’s broadcasting and labor deals, and involvement in local charities would not be ignored.

- “When you look at what he’s been able to accomplish since he bought the team, you’d have to be either shortsighted or mean-spirited not to think that this guy deserves that,” said Dave Logan, a Broncos receiver in Bowlen’s first year as owner who is now the voice of the team on KOA radio. “This franchise has been one of the top four or five in all of football since 1984. That’s a pretty good stretch of excellence.”

- Since he purchased the team from Edgar Kaiser ‘84, Bowlen has guided the Broncos to an NFL-high .614 winning-percentage (313-197-1), with more Super Bowl appearances (seven) than losing seasons (five). The Broncos 13 divisional titles rank second in the NFL, while their 329 nationally televised games are tops.

- “How he wanted to win and how everything was geared to just winning, no matter what it cost to make improvement to the facility, no matter what it cost to retain the best players,” said Alfred Williams, the former Broncos defensive lineman and radio host on 104.3 The Fan. “There was never a guy unhappy about contract situations when he was here. It was magical. It was great. If there were a guy who wanted to know how to be a pro, all you had to do was look at him and look at how he approached his thing.”

- Bowlen’s contributions go well beyond Dove Valley, however. He served on nine NFL committees and helped broker an $18 billion TV rights contract in 1998, a record in sports broadcasting at the time. Locally, he’s donated more than $25 million to charities in the Denver-metro area as chairman of the board of the Broncos.

- “It goes unnoticed to a lot of fans, but it doesn’t go unnoticed — at least, I hope it doesn’t — by other owners in the NFL,” Logan said. “He was a vital part of that broadcast committee and, as much as anybody I can think of, he has helped grow the NFL from a TV standpoint, and a revenue standpoint, too.”",2016-08-16 19:16:57+00:00,d6k3ise,1.0,t3_4y19d7,395,DenverBroncos

""Plummer told Siemian a bit about his history with the Broncos. He told him that opportunities, like the one Siemian received Thursday in Chicago, cannot be squandered. He told him that, to win over the team’s leaders, such as DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller, he would have to prove himself on the field in the big moments. He told him that the process is never-ending, too, that every year requires more practice and more studying.

“I told him, ‘Fans aren’t going to want to see Trevor Siemian. They want to see Paxton Lynch, the guy they screamed and yelled about when they picked him in the first round,’” Plummer says. “I think Trevor’s highly capable of playing — he’s got the skillset and the talent — but he’s just in a spot where he could do well and still not be the guy, with a first-round QB behind him. It’s a tough spot to be in, but I told him don’t worry about that. ‘Go do your job, go do your thing and people will ultimately respect you even more for that.’”

“I just think people don’t know much about him,” says Plummer. “I didn’t know much about him. But Kubiak has a keen eye for talent and he’s a great evaluator. I think he wouldn’t be saying this kid has a chance to start if he didn’t believe it.”""

I think all three QBs played well. Something that stood out in a positive way for Mark Sanchez was his ball placement on his throws. Some of his throws were put in just the right spot where only the receiver could catch it. A low throw to Sanders was an example of that I remember. He came out with energy and looked focused. That rollout to the left on the play action where he completed it to DT over the middle was a sweet play. He showed some great chemistry with Virgil Green as well. A negative was obviously the interception, but that was a great play by the CB. Nothing was there and Sanchez tried to make a play and it turned out to be the wrong decision. That's Mark Sanchez. Overall I was impressed with him. 

Trevor Siemian, as Ron and Lynch said in the broadcast, is one calm dude and I noticed that with his play. He seemed relaxed in the pocket while waiting for plays to develop. He had some great footwork as well. That back shoulder throw to Fowler was Rodgers like. He made good decisions with the ball as well. Not many negatives to take away from Siemian. He missed on some throws. A slant to Fowler he threw WAY behind him (maybe was a miscommunication), but that's expected with a young guy, and no one completes every throw. Overall I was impressed with Trevor as well and I want to see what he can do with the starters in a game.

Paxton Lynch was awesome. He was the guy I was looking forward to the most. The guy has a fucking rifle for an arm. Some of those throws were ridiculous. That comeback throw to Posey just left me shaking my head. He was right on target with those quick slants as well. He also showed some great athleticism. On the broadcast, Ron used the word ""gangly"" (great word) to describe how some QBs look running when they are that tall. Lynch didn't look that way at all. He looked as smooth and agile as a 6""7 guy can. Some negatives I noticed included if his first look wasn't open he just tucked it and ran (reminded me of Tebow). He needs to become more patient in the pocket and continue to learn the playbook. Overall he did well and I am excited for his continued progression.",2016-08-12 22:46:49+00:00,d6f7hjc,1.0,t3_4xg1wd,3369,DenverBroncos

Thursday night with everyone in the country watching and the banner going up with Manning in the house would put a ton of pressure on anybody and the Broncos just may not want that pressure put on Siemian right out the gate. Now Siemian may handle it well and be great or he may crumble. We just don't know. I think drafting Siemian where we did was with the intention that he would be a solid safe backup option for this team. There could be a fear among Elway and Kubiak that if Siemian turns out to be a great QB they wasted a first round pick on Lynch. So what's possibly holding Siemian back is him exceeding expectations and throwing a wrench in the plan Elway and Kubiak had. Regardless, I want the best QB of all three to be the starter for us.

1028,"If you don't want to open the article, here are the observations from the article:

- The fairest thing in this quarterback competition would be to give Trevor Siemian the start in the Broncos’ next preseason game Aug. 20 against San Francisco. “He’s probably in the best command in all honesty because Mark continues to learn our offense, and he’s doing a great job but Trevor has been on for a year and a half,’’ Kubiak said after the Broncos’ convincing 22-0 win  against the outclassed Bears. “Trevor is in command of what we do, how we do it, what we want to get done. He just needs to play. Obviously he hasn’t played as much football as Mark has played, but Trevor is becoming a pro and he has a lot of confidence in himself.’’

- After the game Thursday, a reporter was asking Siemian some random questions, including the obligatory, “what’s one thing you would do if your commissioner for the day?’ Siemian: “Have one less official in a game.’’ A great answer after the preseason game became cluttered with yellow flags after the first quarter.

- On his first play for the Broncos, right tackle Donald Stephenson was flagged for holding.

- Virgil Green and Jeff Heuerman were listed as sharing the starting tight end job on the Broncos’ depth chart this week. But Green clearly had the better game. He had two third-down catches in the opening drive, while Heuerman missed a block on Willie Young and got caught in between two rushing defenders on the blocked field goal to end the half.

- If you’re wondering why Bears’ cornerback Bryce Callahan stopped at the 10-yard line while Thomas ran by to the end zone, you’re not alone. “I don’t know what he was doing’’, Thomas said. Sanchez got clobbered by former Bronco linebacker Danny Trevathan after delivering the pass but Callahan was nowhere around to break it up.

- Lorenzo Doss, who will make the team as the No. 4 cornerback, came up to make nice tackle on Jeremy Langford.

- On the second series, Callahan came off his man, Cody Latimer, to deflect Sanchez’s roll-out pass intended for Bennie Fowler III. The deflection landed in the arms of linebacker Jerrell Freeman for an interception. I thought it was more good  play by Callahan  than bad pass by Sanchez, but the  quarterback could  have  thrown it a half-second sooner.

- Outside linebacker Shaq Barrett had a nice stuff on Langford.

- T.J.  Ward may not be the league’s best strong safety. But he is the best box-blitzing strong safety.

- Siemian came out completing 3 of 3 to Latimer on his first  three plays, then threw a terrific back-shoulder  pass to Fowler in the end zone, only to be broken up nicely by Bears cornerback Deiondre’ Hall.

- Before he got his first carry, Kapri Bibbs made a terrific kickoff coverage tackle.

- The Broncos are correct. Rookie fullback Andy Janovich is good on special teams.

- The biggest mismatch of the game was Broncos’ veteran defensive lineman Jared Crick against Bears rookie left guard Donovan Williams. It was so unfair.

- It took a while for Broncos’ second-round defensive lineman Adam Gotsis to find his rhythm, but once he did he was a force.

- Veteran linebacker Dekoda Watson outclassed the Bears’ third stringers. Another unfair fight.

- Broncos newly signed defensive end Billy Winn played well.

- The Broncos started Darrion Weems at right guard. For their second series he was kicked out to right tackle. In the second half he played left tackle. Whether he makes the 53-man roster or not  it won’t be for lack of tape.

- Paxton Lynch threw two impressive completions. The first was an out route to DeVier Posey for 13 yards with 3:30 left in the third quarter. The second was with 9:53 left in the fourth quarter when the rookie stepped up in the pocket and drilled a 22-yard completion across the middle to Jordan Taylor.

- Britton Colquitt got the better of rookie Riley Dixon in the Great Broncos Punt Off. Colquitt nailed all three of his punts while one of Dixon’s two punts was short and low. Dixon also didn’t have a good hold on Brandon McManus’ 46-yard field goal that clanked off the upright.

- Former Rangeview High School and University of Wyoming standout Eddie Yarbrough is a good player. The Broncos can do worse than put this guy on their practice squad.

- James, James, James. I love James Ferentz’s feistiness. He’s a quality guy from Iowa City. He makes the team as the game-day interior swing offensive lineman.

- It was impressive how Kubiak had his team ready to play. John Fox’s Bears, meanwhile, were embarrassingly bad. The Bears’ offensive line in particular is atrocious. Let’s see how the Broncos do against the 49ers.",2016-08-12 20:25:41+00:00,d6f1b98,1.0,t3_4xfhti,1755,DenverBroncos

1042,"Some key stuff from the article if you don't want to read it:

- The most heated position competition at Broncos training camp is not the quarterbacks. It’s the punters. “It’s cutthroat,” Colquitt said.

- “They’re obviously two different guys,” Kubiak said. “One is the veteran who had a tremendous season last year, especially late in the year. The other one is a young, very talented kid with a big leg. It’s going to be very competitive. We knew that.”

- Colquitt is on the final year of a three-year, $11.7 million contract that will pay him $3.25 million this season (with a $4 million cap-hit). Dixon is on a four-year rookie deal that costs the Broncos only $450,000 this season.

- Seeing the savings involved with Dixon, Colquitt went to Broncos general manager John Elway after the draft to seek some clarity. The veteran didn’t ask why Denver drafted Dixon. He just asked if he stood a chance. Elway told him, bluntly, he wants the best punter. Period.

- “I respect that,” said Colquitt, who in his seven seasons with the Broncos holds the franchise record for gross (47.4) and net (40.2) punting yard averages. “I told him that’s my plan, to be the best punter. And I believe him when he said it will be a fair competition. Riley is a really good, young punter. If he’s not here, he’ll be somewhere in the league. He’s the best competition I’ve had, for sure, since I’ve been in the NFL.”

- “Draft or not, nothing is ever a given,” Dixon said. “I’m not really focusing on the competition. Just trying to be the best punter I can be and I’ll leave the rest up to people who make the decisions.”

- “I’m ready to go out there and play — but the Von I know I can be, the Von I want to be, I’m not there yet,” Miller said Tuesday.

- The Broncos will sit their most valuable player Thursday night in a preseason-opening game at Chicago against the Bears, coach Gary Kubiak said Tuesday. Miller is not alone. Fellow veterans Russell Okung, an offensive tackle, outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware and cornerback Aqib Talib won’t play either.

- “Physically, I am good. Conditioning-wise, I’m good. It’s just the mental part of it,” Miller said. “Whenever you take a break from football, it’s always a process to get back at the game speed that I want to play at. Every day I’m at practice I remember something new that I used to do.”

- He estimated he will be full-go in about 10 days, when the San Francisco 49ers come to Denver for the second preseason game. Until then, as his time in daily practices increases by the day, Miller is increasing his mental repetitions.

1057,"Key points if you don't want to read it:

- Elway believed all along the Broncos could win Manning over — if they played their cards right. “Yeah, I did. Just because I thought of what we could do. I knew the town (Denver), but I also knew what we could do offensively for him,” Elway said. “We would be very flexible with what he wanted to do and try to blend what we were doing compared to what he was used to. A lot of it, the city and everything, is a lot like Indianapolis. And I had met him before. It was a matter of whether he’d go somewhere else where he had a great relationship. We knew if we put our best foot forward, we’d be in the hunt.”

- “Obviously we won a ton of football games with him,” Elway said. “He has that persona, he’s got that leadership quality, he brings the star power, he brings the excitement to the team. And he was a guy that had a chip on his shoulder when we got him because he wanted to prove that he could come back and still play. Indianapolis had to make a decision and it was not the one that he wanted. I’m sure he would have much rather have stayed in Indy. But they got the first pick in the draft and they’re staring at Andrew Luck. It’s a tough spot. It was fortunate for us that we were able to talk him into coming here. With what (Mike) McCoy did for the year that he was here with him, and with what Adam Gase did with him — he made everybody better. Both of them are head coaches now. And a lot of that has to do with the knowledge they got from Peyton and being around Peyton and seeing how he worked. Peyton was a huge part of what we did. To have him and see the way he worked — we were very lucky to have him for those four years.”

- “He asked me about that and he said he was going to take a year off,” Elway said. “We played some golf and he said he was going to take a year off. I thought it was a great idea, to enjoy things a little bit, don’t hurry back into something. Step back a little bit and figure out what he wants to do, because he’s going to be able to do what he wants to do. He’s been doing this for a long time, so for him to be able to sit back and relax.”

- “I’ll be curious to see what he wants to do,” Elway said. “You have to want to do it. It’s a totally different game than being a player because you’re behind the scenes, which I like. But it’s a matter of where he wants to be and if he’s going to enjoy it or not. He’s a little bit of a control freak, and a lot of times you can’t control a lot of things that go on. You can control who’s going out there, but you can’t control anything else. So whether he gets too frustrated with that, I don’t know. It’ll be interesting to see how he handles that. I’m sure if he decides to go that way, he’ll be just fine.”

1060,"Key points from part two if you don't want to read it:

- On going down to the field during practice: “Just to be around them, because I don’t get them in meeting rooms,” he says. “I just try to hang, and you get a feel for guys and personalities and how they fit.”

- “That’s why you can never lock into one solution,” Elway said. “You always have to have several options and go with what’s best. I haven’t talked to Brock about it. I’ve only kind of heard about it, of why he may have been a little bit upset about the way things went.”

- “I can understand that he didn’t want to sit down and have Peyton come back in that San Diego game, but it wasn’t the fact that Brock was playing bad,” Elway said. “We needed a change of something. So I was a little surprised just how he seemed to be a little bent out of shape about that. But he had an opportunity to make a tremendous amount of money in Houston, and for us, it just didn’t fit.”

- “To be able to get Mark and then have Trevor that we drafted last year who’s having a good camp and a guy that we believe can be the future in Paxton — it’s just a matter of him coming along and continuing to improve,” Elway said. “It may not look as good from the outside as people want it to look. But we feel pretty good about how it looks from the inside. We feel good about that spot in the years to come and of what Mark can do. We think he’s got the ability, if we get him in the right situation, to be a very sufficient and adequate quarterback.”

- “That’s how I look at our team this offseason: Did we get better as a football team? I believe we did,” he said. “And the other thing is, when people are doubting you, it adds that incentive. We’re kind of in that situation right now.

1062,"Seriously those accomplishments are just ridiculous: 

- First general manager to win Super Bowl (2015 season) after leading same franchise to a Super Bowl victory as a quarterback (1997, 1998).

- Named executive of the year by several publications in 2015.

- Architect of the highest-scoring team in NFL history (606 points) in 2013 and the league’s No. 1 defense (283.1 yards allowed per game) in 2015.

- Only GM in past five years to acquire future Pro Bowlers through the draft, street free agency, unrestricted free agency and college free agency.

- Since 2011, Denver has tied the Patriots for most division titles (five), playoff berths (five), Super Bowl appearances (two) and Super Bowl titles (one).

- Past five years, the Broncos (64-26, .711) and Patriots (69-23, .750) are the only teams to win at least 70 percent of their games.

- Only one of the 35 unrestricted free agents lost during Elway’s time in the front office has made the Pro Bowl within the next three seasons — safety Mike Adams, and he was replaced with Pro Bowl safety T.J. Ward.

- Elway and coach Gary Kubiak have had only one losing season together (5-11 in 1990), when they were Denver quarterbacks.

- Elway, Kubiak or both have been with the Broncos for 28 of the past 33 seasons. Denver failed to make the playoffs in each of the five seasons without them.

I mean Elway is reaching a whole other level.

1063,"This is a fantastic article

Key points if you don't want to read it:

- “I try to learn in every situation,” he says. “Once I quit learning, I feel like it’s time to move on. But i like the challenge of continuing to try to be good.”

- “You know,” Elway says, leaning back in his leather chair to review his seven Super Bowls and three victories, “it’s different as a GM. As a player it’s a huge accomplishment, because that’s what your goal is your whole career and you work so hard to be able to get there. When we beat Green Bay (in the Super Bowl that ended the 1997 season), there was not a better feeling than knowing I had finally reached the goal. You talk about a kind of freeing feeling. As a GM, it’s very satisfying. It’s very satisfying knowing that we got the right people in the right spots with the right mind-set to be able to manage that and let them do their jobs.”

- “I always used to say, when I was playing I could control most everything inside the lines, and really nothing outside the lines,” he says. “I could say things, but I really had no control. I just worked with who they put next to me. Now I really don’t have any control inside the lines, but I got a lot of control outside.”

- “When I came in here, we were coming off a 4-12 year, so there was a lot of stuff we had to do,” Elway says. “It’s hard to stay on top. It’s easier to get there than it is to stay there. It’s difficult, and you have to make a lot of tough decisions on guys on who’s staying, who’s going, also looking in the future and trying to blend all those things. The hardest decisions are on who can we pay, who can’t we pay, who can we keep, who can’t we keep.”

- “Yeah, it was kind of funny,” Elway says. “I think it was the third or fourth day of training camp last year and I just walked by Kube and said, ‘Kube, I think we’re going to be pretty darn good on defense.’ “People talk about us trying to buy a defense and this and that, but all those guys we brought in fit in great. The overall philosophy I’m proud of — play great defense and continue to try to get better on the offensive side.”

- “Because Tebow had such a fan base behind him — there was probably only one guy that we could have replaced him with that people would understand,” Elway says. “And that was Peyton Manning.”

- “There’s no question when we decided to part ways with John (Fox) that Gary was the first guy I thought of,” Elway says. “My dad always said it’s 80 percent players and 20 percent coaching. I have a tendency to believe it’s a little bit more than that, because you can’t do one without the other. I don’t think you can win a championship without great players and I don’t think you can win a championship without great coaching too.”

- “As a player you watch tape to get better,” he says. “That’s why I think a lot of times I like to take the time to go back and look at different guys and say, ‘What did we see, what didn’t we see, what did we miss on this guy, or why did we hit this guy and no one else liked him?’ That to me is the challenging part, and that to me is how you continue to get better.”",2016-08-07 15:34:20+00:00,d67uvbr,1.0,t3_4wl9cg,315,DenverBroncos

- “Yes, without a doubt, I thought this is something that could happen when I first came in,"" Fowler said. “Without a doubt, coming from practice squad, the role I had last year and making some big plays in the playoffs, I showed myself I can play in this league and I can make big plays in this league. The sky is the limit.""

- Fowler has spent some time in Atlanta this offseason working with Thomas and spent some extra time on the field with both Thomas and Sanders in the offseason program.

- “Just my experience last year and then I worked out with [Thomas] some in the offseason,"" Fowler said. “… I knew it had it in me and I had to get the trust of Peyton [Manning] on third down, playing in the slot. And once you get the trust from a guy like that, your confidence goes way up -- he’s one of the greatest players of all time. And making the plays in the playoffs, that even gave me more confidence.""

- Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said Fowler's confidence has been part of the difference (in deciding who makes the team)

- “They just play; when I sit down [Thomas] and [Sanders], they get to go with the ones,"" Kubiak said. “They’re very confident right now. If Emmanuel or [Thomas] are going to raise their hand to come out of the game, these kids are ready to go in there and make plays, not to just get us to the point where the other guys are ready to come back. They’ve got a lot of confidence in what’s going on.""

- Fowler said he gave the ball to Manning shortly after the game (Manning's final pass)

- “All the passes, all the records he’s broken, all those balls go to the Hall of Fame,"" Fowler said. “So I thought he should keep this one … Hopefully I can help us get to another Super Bowl.

- “There are plays when I knock the crap out of a linebacker or something and everybody seems excited,” Janovich said at Broncos headquarters. “But that’s just the role of the fullback. I feel like they’re liking what I’m doing.”

- “I know how I’d like to use them,” Kubiak said. “When you’re operating with a fullback offensively, there are certain things you get defensively. When you’re a one-back team with three or four (receivers) wide, you get a variety of things and teams can settle down a bit.”

- “To be really effective in the running game, you have to run the fullback,” Elway said last year. “We will have people in the fullback position.”

- “Downhill hitting. I love one-on-one blocks with linebackers,” said Janovich, who joined the Cornhuskers as a walk-on. “They’re the biggest, toughest guys out there. I get a headache now and then, but that’s just what the position is.”

- “We ask our fullback to do a lot of things,” Kubiak said. “We knew what Andy was when we drafted him.”

- “It’s different than a pulling guard. A fullback is looking to kill you,” said Janovich, 23. “I’m having a blast. I love this. I’m just trying to work my butt off every day.”",2016-08-06 15:57:18+00:00,d66rcs1,1.0,t3_4wgdz0,421,DenverBroncos

- Jeff Heuerman has been quiet so far in camp. He hasn't stood out for any good or bad reasons. He is just plugging along getting up to speed. Honestly Garrett Graham has stood out above Virgil and Heuerman so far, but Green and Heuerman both have been slowed due to injuries.

- Justin Simmons has played very well so far in camp. He has been running with the second team opposite Shiloh Keo. He has been working a lot on special teams and figures to have a large role there. 

- Will Parks has been quiet throughout camp as well. Same as with Jeff it isn't for any good or bad reason, he is just another guy out there. He has been running with the third team throughout camp and has also been working on special teams.

**Denver Broncos**

""Pending court approval, the Denver Broncos have assumed the Metropolitan Football Stadium District's contract for the naming rights to Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

""This acquisition streamlines the process for securing the best possible long-term partnership for the naming rights to our stadium. As in the past, proceeds from stadium naming rights will be split 50-50 between the Broncos (who also provide sponsorship elements) and the MFSD.

""There is no timetable for securing a new naming rights agreement, and the name of the stadium-Sports Authority Field at Mile High-has not changed at this time. The Broncos look forward to working with the MFSD in establishing a new long-term relationship with a stadium naming rights partner.""

**Broncos President Joe Ellis**

""It was important for us to step up and assume this contract to expedite the shared goal we have with the Metropolitan Football Stadium District of finding a new naming rights partner. Together with the MFSD, we understand how important naming rights are to the future of our stadium.""

**MFSD** 

The Metropolitan Football Stadium District (MFSD) was informed that a motion was filed in a Delaware Court for the Denver Broncos to assume the naming rights contract for Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

""The filing of bankruptcy by Sports Authority had left uncertainty in the future of the naming rights of Sports Authority Field at Mile High. The Denver Broncos assuming the naming rights offers some clarity in the future of Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

""In anticipation of a potential court decision, the District Board directed the staff to prepare a request for proposals (RFP) to seek a valuation for a new naming rights partner. Those efforts will continue as both the court and District processes move forward.

""Pending court approval, the Denver Broncos will assume the MFSD contract with Sports Authority.

""Naming rights revenue is primarily used for capital improvements extending the life of the stadium well into the future, attempting to avoid need for public funding. The District and the Denver Broncos are currently conducting a facilities conditions assessment of the stadium and surrounding campus. Preliminary numbers indicate over $300 million will be needed over the next 30 years to maintain the facility."" 

**MFSD Chairman Ray Baker**

""This will allow the District to work closely with the Broncos to secure the best possible outcome for a new naming right partner. The District looks forward to working with the Broncos over the next weeks and months to secure the best deal.""",2016-08-03 15:47:33+00:00,d62la7z,1.0,t3_4vz4tg,246,DenverBroncos

1097,"From the article:

- About midway through the Denver Broncos’ training camp practice Monday, Sambrailo arrived at UCHealth Training Center wearing an enormous elbow brace covering the length of his right arm.

- The Broncos’ projected starting right guard suffered the injury early in practice Sunday. The elbow was braced and the former Colorado State standout finished the practice. Then it swelled up Sunday night. Broncos’ coach Gary Kubiak said Sambrailo would be out a few days with a hyperextended elbow.

- Besides Sambrailo’s injury, backup veteran guard Sam Brenner is also out this week with a concussion so McGovern has a real chance to become the Broncos’ starting guard in week 1 against Carolina.

- “Sometimes when a guy misses (practice), you make a decision as a coach that you might not make in a game,” Kubiak said. “You say, ‘Hey, I’m in camp, you’ve got four, five weeks here, I don’t want to hurt people and move them around.""

- “The natural thing was for Connor to move up and let me go back and look to see how he did today. That’s why we drafted him. Hopefully we get Ty back as soon as possible, but if not, the first move is to move Connor up.”

- There’s a good chance Kyle Peko will start a new string this year. A defensive tackle from Oregon State, Peko received the largest signing bonus among the Broncos’ 23 undrafted rookies at $11,000.

- “He looks like a good player,” Kubiak said. “It is going to be interesting to see how he plays during the preseason. (Darius) Kilgo needs to continue to step up as a second year player. They are getting plenty of opportunities. That’s been our nick spot. There and tight end have really been missing some guys and are short on numbers. We’ll see. He’s obviously stood out.”

- After some surprisingly light crowds to start camp, the Broncos have drawn more than 9,500 the past two days. The crowd of 4,813 was especially impressive for a Monday and was the largest this year.

- “I'm always (behind) the eight ball, but I always find a way out of it,’’ Hillman said. “I plan to do that again this year.’’

- “It's kind of weird, but at the end of the day we're all helping each other to go out and compete against each other,’’ Booker said. “I'm pretty sure you don't want to just look at a guy that's struggling out there in the field and you're just blowing right by him in reps. We just try to be helpful to each other so [we] can go out and compete against each other to make it a very competitive day in practice.’’

- “I think that’s up to the players,’’ Kubiak said. “They always talk about guys being two-down or three-down players. I think C.J. has proven he is a three-down player. He does a good job in pass protection and those type of things. I think Ronnie took those same steps last year. Devontae, this young kid we just got, has made a lot of strides. ... I think we are all excited to see what he can be. I really think that’s up to the player. They have to go out there and prove that they can go out there and carry 25 times, down the field, on third down, protect your quarterback. That’s what we are going to work to do.’’",2016-07-30 14:59:53+00:00,d5x7er8,1.0,t3_4vcdsz,81,DenverBroncos

Phillips has overcome numerous injuries, including torn anterior cruciate ligaments suffered in 2010 and 2013. He also tore his medial collateral ligament in his right knee in 2013, but returned to play all 16 games for San Diego in the 2004 and 2005 seasons.

1133,"Last month Kubiak sat down with Troy Renck for an interview. 

Key Points: 

- Kubiak became a grandfather this offseason.

- “Obviously, I spend time back home and with family,” said Kubiak in an exclusive interview before the team exited in late June. “But you never really get away from football as a coach.”

- “When you go back and think about the short period of time our guys had off from the last game of the season to say we had 99 percent of our players here everyday for the offseason that’s all you can ask for as a coach,” Kubiak said. “Obviously we have questions to answer, but they can only be answered when you start playing football. That comes next. We have had some guys put themselves in position to be the answer to some of the questions we have. But they have to do it.”

- “I am not going to use the word improved. I think we have a chance to be really good upfront. We have a center (Matt Paradis, who played every snap last year), who I think is becoming a great player everyday I watch him out there,” Kubiak said. “I think Max has a brilliant future. I feel really good about bringing Donald in and when we line up on the first day of camp they should all five be ready to go because Russell should be fine.”

- “It’s a position [Tight End] not many people have asked me about. In theory our No. 1 and No. 2 haven’t practiced one time. I am little concerned about that,” Kubiak said last month.

- “You want all your guys working. But if Von was here (in offseason workouts) and DeMarcus was healthy I would have probably only worked them only seven out of the 15 days anyway. I am excited about DeMarcus because I think we have finally settled down on the things that were bothering him. So we’ve made some progress here,” Kubiak said. “With Von, we know what he’s capable of. We will have to bring him along the right way.”

- “Defensively upfront we have a chance to be very, very good. I think we are deep. We went and got (Jared) Crick. If those guys come through like we are counting on them, we should be six deep. If (defensive lineman) Phil Taylor comes in and is a good player we are seven deep,” Kubiak said. “With Aqib obviously we have to get him healthy. That’s the most important thing. We have to remember that (Bradley) Roby is here for a reason. He’s a top-notch draft choice and probably had as much to do with us winning the Super Bowl as any single player on the team. You go back and look at some of the plays he made. I have a lot of confidence in him.”",2016-07-27 15:43:06+00:00,d5t2n9p,1.0,t3_4uv8q9,213,DenverBroncos

- The Kubiak way includes a fullback for up to 25 percent of the plays. During the offseason and into training camp that starts Thursday morning, Thompson will share the fullback position with sixth-round rookie Andy Janovich.

- “We’re trying to put this fullback in and make sure we’re going with the new fullback movement this year so it’s going to be different,’’ Thompson said. “A lot more running, a lot more playmakers throughout the backfield with various talents.’’

- “I think it’s more running back friendly now,” Thomas said. “But it is what it is. Whatever we’ve got to do to win the game.  Of course as a receiver you’re going to want the ball but it’s a little different. But you still get the opportunities to go out and make plays, you just got to make ‘em.”",2016-07-26 17:16:29+00:00,d5rpnzk,1.0,t3_4upqqt,115,DenverBroncos

See if that helps so I get speed, get a little quicker for the different type of offense. So some of the norms but tried to catch a little more. I had a couple drops I shouldn’t have had last year so it was mainly catching the ball and keeping the eye on the ball.”

- “I still got some work to do,” Thomas said. “I got time. A year at a time, day at a time, I’ve got some time. The main thing this year is going out and doing better than what I did last year.

- Bob Raissman of the New York Daily News reports that the 65-year-old Jackson “likely will not return” to ESPN’s Sunday NFL Countdown this year.

- Jackson played 14 years with the Broncos before joining ESPN after the end of his career. The coming season would be his 30th at ESPN.

- ESPN has declined comment.

EDIT:

- [PFT] (http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/07/25/tom-jackson-wont-be-back-at-espn/) says it's official that Jackson won't be back.

- “I would say Paxton,” Harris said. “He had better touch on his ball, more accuracy than I think Brock had when he first came in the league. That’s the one thing I can see that will definitely help him. And he’s more mobile; he can run and do a little more moving in the pocket than I think Brock could, too.”

- “He (Sanchez) came in, and he’s brought good leadership that we needed, losing Peyton,” Harris said. “We had to find some new guys that can take the helm as the leadership on the offense. He brought that attitude. He’s joining a Super Bowl winning team, so he knows he has to put in the work.”

- ""We’re fine with him handing the ball off. We’re going to have a great offensive line this year,” Harris said. “They’re way better than they were last year. The running backs … I love Devontae Booker, he looked great during OTAs. I could see him, C.J. [Anderson] and Ronnie [Hillman] having tons of carries, man, and us living off the defense, too.”

1264,"Right now our O-line is set as:

LT- Russell Okung 

LG- Max Garcia

C- Matt Paradis 

RG- Ty Sambrailo

RT- Donald Stephenson

The one spot that appears up for grabs is RG and we have four guys who are competing for it.

- Ty Sambrailo (from the article) 

Ty Sambrailo seems to have the coaches favor and a bit of experience. During his rookie season, he started the first three games at left tackle before a shoulder injury took him out for the year. At Colorado State University, he played all five positions along the line but primarily at guard and tackle. In 48 games he started 42 and was then drafted 59th-overall in the 2015 NFL Draft.

“Obviously, he’s an athletic kid. He has great balance. That’s what we saw when we drafted him,” Dennison said May 25 of Sambrailo and his move inside. “He’s a smart kid. He comes from a stellar university like he did—my alma mater (laughing). It’s a chance to get our best five guys out there. If he has the flexibility to go in and play, great.”

Although Sambrailo has the inside track, his NFL experience is limited, and many other youthful inside players are right on his tail.

- Sam Brenner (from the article)

“[Sam] Brenner will work in there, obviously. He’s definitely working in there,” Head Coach Gary Kubiak said May 24 of the guards in the competition. “We just have a lot of good competition going. I think we have three or four guys that can play center or guard, so that’s something we battled with last year. Remember, we suited up eight guys the majority of the year. We’d like to get away from that.”

Brenner is a fourth-year player who has appeared in ten games (two starts) that can play both center and guard. 

- Connor McGovern (from the article)

Connor McGovern, a tackle and guard from the University of Missouri impressed General Manger John Elway enough to take him 144th overall in this year’s draft.

“We wanted to draft an offensive lineman, and he’s very athletic,” Elway said just after the pick. “I think he’s a guy that can move inside and play some guard. He’s got that flexibility and is very athletic, and a tough guy. One thing we know about him is that he likes the weight room. He spends a lot of time in the weight room, so it’s our kind of guy.”

McGovern, who played a lot of tackle at the end of his career with the Tigers, expects to compete immediately for a job at guard.

“Just playing on the inside. I think that’s where I’ll be the most successful in my career as a Bronco,” McGovern said May 6. “I can help the team out on the outside if need be, but I think I’ll be most successful on the inside.”

- Robert Myers Jr. (from the article)

Robert Myers Jr., a second year player from Tennessee State and Aaron Neary out of Eastern Washington round out the group. Myers certainly has a shot to move up the depth chart after joining the Broncos December 30 of last year.

- My take:

I believe Myers will remain a depth guy so that leaves Sambrailo, Brenner, and McGovern. I really want to see Sambrailo be successful, but I am not sure he fits the guard spot. I feel he is more of a RT. He has the ability to move quick laterally, which we have the guards do a lot in this offense, so that's a positive, but I am not sure he has the strength to be a solid RG. What do I know though, he may embrace the switch to RG and work his ass off and be great. The guy I really want to see is Connor McGovern. This guy is an absolute beast on the inside. One word that comes to mind when I think of him is POWERFUL. He may not be ready to start right away though as we've seen its tough for guys to adjust to the speed of the game as a rookie. Sam Brenner could be a guy to watch out for as well. The coaches like him enough to give him solid reps so if shit hits the fan and Sambrailo can't stay healthy and McGovern isn't ready then Brenner may be the guy. 

I really want to see this O-line be successful and healthy this season. Its so important to our running game to have guys play consistent. We've overhauled it this offseason with signings and draft picks. I for one cannot wait for training camp and see how our O-Line shakes out.

- The Miami Heat have countered with a two-year, approximately $40 million offer, but Wade seems determined in his desire for a longer term contract, league sources said.

- Broncos safety T.J. Ward joined NFL Network's Total Access Tuesday and weighed in on his team's ongoing quarterback battle between Mark Sanchez, Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch. To Ward, the battle between all three quarterbacks is ""even.""

- ""We got three guys working really hard,"" Ward said. ""They've all worked with the 1's, 2's and 3's. We have seen them work with different receivers in the starting offense and second-string offense. I'm not sure (who will start in September). ... Sometimes you really have to see who threw the ball or who is starting with the 1's because they're pretty even.""

- ""You never know. He might come in and have a year like Ben Roethlisberger and take us to the Super Bowl again,"" he said.

- A potential optimistic sign the two sides can reach accord is there has been ongoing discussion, most recently  during  the Fourth of July weekend when Broncos general  manager John Elway was  involved in a conference call with Miller’s agent Joby Branion.

- Miller has also spoken directly with Elway three times in recent weeks -- including during the team's White House trip and Super Bowl ring ceremony, and more recently by phone -- and with Joe Ellis, the team’s chief executive officer and president

- All this talking, though, is not necessarily the same as negotiating. And the two sides have not talked numbers since the Broncos issued a self-imposed June 7 deadline on Miller to accept their offer of six years and $114.5 million.

- The Broncos’ position: They remain hopeful a deal can be worked out so Miller plays for them into the next decade. Contrary to how he has often been portrayed during the Miller negotiations, Elway wants to pay Miller. But Elway has also let it be known he has 52 other players to worry about.

""I think he's not tying himself to Tim, what Tim does. It's not like, 'Hey we're going to go out together.' I think Manu feels -- if he feels like he has more in him, he's going to play.""

""I'm told that Pau Gasol is a real priority for them,"" Wojnarowski said. ""They tried to get him before he signed with Chicago. The Bulls were able to offer him a little bit more than the mid-level that year, I think the Spurs had a mid-level for him. They can maneuver in San Antonio and probably be able to offer him market value. We'll see what that's going to be.""

1347,"Key points from the article:

- Schofield, a third-round draft pick out of Michigan, saw his weight drop from his listed 301 pounds to the 295-298 range last season.

- His weight is up to a steady 308 pounds already this offseason.

- “Last season I was kind of on the lighter side,” Schofield said. “So this offseason I really focused on getting my weight up. And my girlfriend is living with me so she’s been cooking a lot for me so that’s been helping out a lot.’’

- On paper, he Broncos are planning to start Okung at left tackle this season, Stephenson at right tackle, shift second-year tackle Ty Sambrailo to starting right guard and have Schofield serve as the game-day “swing” tackle.

- With Okung sitting out team drills this offseason to recover from shoulder injury, the Broncos’ coaching staff had Schofield work exclusively at left tackle during OTAs and minicamp.

- “More positions you can play and everything, if I’m not the starter than you’ve got to be able to swing tackle,” Schofield said. “I’ve got to be able to play everywhere.”

- “No way. I don’t want to give up my starting spot,’’ he said. “Definitely not. I’m going to be out there in camp trying to go 100 percent every time trying to win a starting spot.’’

- ""It was definitely a roller coaster year last year,” Schofield said. “I played really well in some games and obviously that one game I played really, really bad. It’s a new year, a new me is what my mentality is this year. Just trying to get better every day.”

1349,"There is a lot of good stuff in the article. 

On contract negotiations

“I don’t like to think about it,” Miller says of the contract. “That’s like negative energy. I’m going to be here.” The linebacker repeatedly said that he’s not getting caught up in the negotiations, even on the same day that Fletcher Cox signed with the Eagles for $63 million guaranteed, or $23 million more in guaranteed cash than the Broncos’ best offer to Miller so far. Miller was happy for Cox, but he remained honest about his own situation. “It just hurts,” Miller says. “I’m not even going to lie. It’s a business but at the end of the day, I got feelings, too. I know some fans don’t know that some of the reports aren’t even true. When I get on Instagram, no matter what I post, there’s going to be 400 comments. Guys bashing me. Take the deal. You greedy bastard. I thought you wanted to be a Bronco for life? And it kind of weighs on you after a while.”

Miller compared what he wanted from this courtship to what he received from his alma mater Texas A&amp;M when the university recruited him in 2007. The school sent handwritten letters almost daily, cropped him into a team photo and generally fawned over him in ways that schools like LSU and Michigan did not.

“You know you got that girlfriend that’s really not like that attractive but she’s like really good for you, and she’s going to do everything she can to keep you?” he says. “Instead of that really, really hot chick that just talks to you on Mondays. It was like that, above and beyond. That’s the same type of feeling I’m looking for from the Broncos.” Miller’s father, Von Sr., weighed in as well, and he didn’t rule out sitting out or holding out as an option, even as he described that possibility as an extreme scenario. “You’ve got this spectrum [of options] from left to right,” Von Sr. says. “And the left is all of the worse [scenarios], and then you tend to go over to the right where everything is good. So we want to stay on the right but that’s a potential to go far left. Far left is sitting out. That has to be one of the last and final options that you have. He’s not looking forward to that. He loves being with his team. He loves his teammates. And his teammates know.” So sitting out is a possibility, even if it’s a remote one? “It’s got to be there,” Von Sr. says. “It’s got to be a part of the play. It’s got to be part of the process. Do we want to go down that road? I would say not. We definitely don’t. I don’t want him to go down that road.”

It’s got their AFC Championship rings, it’s got their three Lombardi Trophies, and of course has the message that this one’s for Mr. Bowlen. So obviously—his health issues—it’s very special to win that championship for him and his family this year. It’s very special. These don’t go away. I pulled out my Indianapolis Colts ring tonight. Hadn’t worn it in nine years. I wore it for about two weeks after we received our rings in the summer of 2007, and then I’ve had it in storage. So I pulled it out tonight,it’s more than twice the size. In 10 years, these rings will blow out someone’s shoulder. It’s very special. I can remember nine years ago, taking the pictures with my teammates. I’ve got great pictures already with Von Miller, Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders, Coach Kubiak, John Elway. I got one with Ashley. So these memories don’t go away. I’m very honored and grateful.”

When we come back for the reunion, everybody will be holding their Super Bowl rings. It’s a beautiful time. It’s a beautiful ring. This one is for Pat. He did a lot of stuff for all of us. To do something for someone else is an incredible feeling,” said Von Miller, who was with the team for the ceremony. 

Demarcus Ware waited a long time for this moment, but it was worth it. “I’ve been in the league almost 12 years now. To have an opportunity to say the whole team, not just you as an individual, but the whole team came together and was able to pull it off. I had been to a couple of playoff games where we lost, but now you get to hoist that trophy up at the end of the game with your teammates. You sort of thing of the offseason and the blood sweat and tears and everything it took,"" he said. ""It wasn’t just one guy. It took everybody to get to where we are.”

The question now revolves around whether each side is more interested in winning a deal instead of making one. If the Broncos move some additional guaranteed money into the first two years of their offer and Miller's representatives don't ask to make the total go any higher than the current highest-paid defensive player in history, there is a deal to be made -- before the deadline.

If they all dig in, go macho and forget what they've all said is important to them, then Miller likely will be playing under the tag in the 2016 season, and all parties will prepare to do this dance again a year from now with a lot more angst along for the ride.

- Ottavino, 30,  doesn’t have a timetable for his return to the Rockies, but said he’s right on track for a successful comeback. “The Rockies have done a great job with this,” he said. “I suppose they could have rushed me back sooner, but we have just waited to see how I’ve done through all of the stages. I think it’s been a perfect plan.""

- Ottavino pitched twice in extended spring in Scottsdale, Ariz., throwing 25 pitches in a simulated game against fellow Rockies players Saturday and one inning vs. the Diamondbacks on Monday. “I threw my fastball, slider, cutter, everything,” he said. “My arm feels good.

- “We’re going to the White House in a few weeks,’’ safety T.J. Ward said recently. “It’s a new year. It’s a new season. We lost a couple guys on defense. Maybe they like us to play with a chip on our shoulders. It’s more entertaining that way.’’

- “I think people are just saying that because we lost two quarterbacks,’’ Roby said. “I don’t know the last time that’s happened, but when people see events that haven’t happened before, they automatically doubt. We know that defense was a big reason why we got to the game and why we won the game. We’re very confident that we’ll be better this year. I think we’ll be a lot better this year.”

- “Ultimately defense is about effort,’’ said defensive end Derek Wolfe. “Our defense plays with a ton of effort. It doesn’t matter what adjustments people will make. We’re going to play hard. That’s what it comes down to. I think a lot of defenses lose it not just because of people adjusting to what they do, but it’s because they lose guys to free agency. You lose that chemistry. You’ve got to keep that chemistry. That’s why we’re such a great defense. We care about each other. That’s why we’re such a good team because we all have each other’s back.’’

- “Everybody is entitled to their opinions, but we’re just going to keep working and keep getting better,’’ safety Darian Stewart said. “This is our second year together. It’s going to be hell for teams this year.’’",2016-05-26 14:01:11+00:00,d3kewwz,1.0,t3_4l5fbh,97,DenverBroncos

B/R: Right, I get that, but out of the 24 quarterbacks who have won Super Bowls and are now retired, you’re one of only three men to even try to work for a team again as a coach or executive. What you’re doing is extremely rare. The only ex-player of your caliber who has done anything like this is Ozzie Newsome. Most guys stand on laurels in your business.

JE: It’s a great challenge. I enjoy the competition side of it. That’s what made me as a player, that competitive side to it. That doesn’t go away just because you retire from football. The physical side of the game goes away, but the mental side doesn’t go away. For me, I’ve been just as competitive in the business world as I was on the field. I think the competitiveness helps me in this job because it’s about winning. Every decision we make is about trying to put the best football team on the field and win championships. So when guys come here, they know we’re here to win football games and not just pay people a lot of money. There are high expectations here. I think that always starts at the top. That’s how [owner] Pat [Bowlen] was before and it filtered down here and I just carry it on for him. The expectations, I believe, are a lot higher here than a lot of other places.

- For all running back C.J. Anderson has done with the Denver Broncos, he does not have a career 100-yard rushing game before Nov. 1 in any of his three previous seasons.

- “I just want to come in, I want to start faster,’’ Anderson said. “That’s something I talked about with [Broncos coach Gary Kubiak] and (running backs) coach (Eric) Studesville. They felt like I hit my peak after the bye week last year.’’

- “Waaaayyyy better,’’ Anderson said when asked if his conditioning was better this year than last, as well as better than when he arrived as a undrafted rookie in 2013. “I’ve never come back at playing weight, so I’m excited about that. I’m leaning up.""

- ""I think it’s maturity -- I learned every year. After my rookie year I came back at 240-something, then last year … I came back at, like, 225, 224 -- they were happy upstairs. This year I think it’s better to come back to OTAs at playing weight.’’

- And that playing weight, Anderson said, is “anywhere between 218 and 221 (pounds) is where I need to be.’’ Anderson said following Tuesday’s OTA workout that he was currently at 221 pounds.

- “He’s looked good and that’s what you want to see,"" Kubiak said. “ … We think he’s going to be a big reason we can have a big year.""

- “(We’re) adding the fullback element, so I’m going to have to learn that,’’ Anderson said. “ … I’m doing a great job watching the (video) of those teams.’’

- Anderson figures, even with Hillman’s return and the selection of running back Devontae Booker with a fourth-round pick, to be in line to crack the 200-carry barrier and be the every-down, go-to guy at the position this coming season:

""I don’t think I’m to that level yet,"" Anderson said. ""But can I get there? Hell yeah, I believe in my ability and what I can do. But I still come out every day and fight like there’s 22 running backs in front of me.’’

All of us felt unanimously—in every case—that John and the other two all deserved very much so to be in the Ring of Fame.""

- ""[President &amp; CEO Joe Ellis] just said right away, ‘Hey, congratulations, you were just elected to the Broncos Ring of Fame.’ So, pretty nice surprise and even more special considering I had found out earlier this year that I’m going in the Buccaneer Ring of Honor, [that’s] they call it there, so it’s going be a special year.""

- ""I didn’t even know they were voting,"" said Lynch. ""I think I was surprised because I had no idea this was even going on. So that was the biggest surprise. Once I heard it, I suppose so, but you know, I think a lot of people say this, and I certainly feel it: It feels like I was in Denver and a member of the Broncos longer than four years. They were four impactful and meaningful years, not only for me on the field kind of coming back in the second stage of my career after neck surgery and proving to myself and everyone that I still had some left in me, and also for our family. It became our home for a long, long time and a very big part of our lives""

- ""I think during my career, during games, I’d be looking up there,"" Lynch said. ""I didn’t get here until my 11th year in the league, so I knew my career was going to be short-lived. I didn’t know how long. I think four years was on the high end of what I thought I had left in me. So I didn’t know how realistic it was, so I just said go play hard, try to win a championship and then we’ll see if that happens. And so, then I never really thought about it again until I think the Buccaneers called and said I’d been elected to their Ring of Honor. I started to think, ‘Wow, I wonder if that will ever happen in Denver.’ And sure enough, I got the call today and it’s a reality, so very, very special.""

- ""I think first and foremost you’ve got to talk about Pat Bowlen. You asked about players and coaches, but it all started with Pat Bowlen and I used to run into him skiing in the offseason up in Beaver Creek and I shared with some of you the story: I skied and no one really knew I did it in Tampa, and I used to run into Mr. Bowlen and his family up there. So I knew him, which helped but I also knew how much the guy loved winning just from talking to him and being around him, so that was a huge draw for me. I wasn’t too happy with him when I signed with the Broncos and the next day he told me that the skiing stuff was over. That wasn’t too cool, but Pat was a huge part of it, Mike [Shanahan] was a big part of it recruiting me to come to Denver, Champ, Al Wilson was a player that was really fun to play with—I think a really underrated player in the league. Just had natural leadership instincts. Jake Plummer was about as good a teammate—just a fun guy to play with. Rod Smith, I say he’s right up there in the running with the likes of Derrick Brooks [and] Ronde Barber as the best teammates I’ve ever played with. They’re selfless, they put everybody else in front of them and still were great players.

1531,"Key Points:

- ""I'll start with Jason Elam. A tremendous 15-year career [and the] all-time leading scorer in Broncos history, a tremendous contributor,"" Denver Broncos President and CEO, Joe Ellis, said of Elam. ""I think he had 152 wins, which is second to only John Elway, if I'm right there as a Bronco. A great, great player for us and a well-deserved honor today to elect him into the Ring of Fame.""

- ""It's a huge honor, probably the biggest individual honor I've ever received,"" Elam said of being elected to the Broncos Ring of Fame. ""To be able to go in with John Lynch and Simon Fletcher, two great former teammates and great people, it's just a pretty amazing deal. I'm really happy for them and I consider it a great honor for myself. It's a really amazing thing to kind of look around at the people that are in the Ring of Fame. I don't feel like I should be named with those people. To have that honor and to have that kind of appreciation from the selection committee and from the Broncos is incredible.""

- Elam will become the third kicker elected into the Broncos Ring of Fame, joining Jim Turner and halfback/kicker Gene Mingo.

- ""You don't every really go there too much,"" Elam said on whether he ever envisioned being elected into the Ring of Fame. ""You don't feel like anything like that is a shoe in at all. There are only [28] guys up there. Imagine all of the players that have played for the Denver Broncos—some absolutely amazing players that you see in that Ring of Fame, and so again, I just feel incredibly honored just to be mentioned with those guys.""

- Elam was also asked about his most dramatic field goal he ever made in his career. ""My last season in Denver against Buffalo, the season opener,"" said Elam. ""That crazy hurry-up field goal situation we got ourselves in was probably the most dramatic kick I ever had. It was a pretty cool moment. We practiced that play for the whole entire training camp never thinking we were going to run anything like that and then the very first game we end up having to run it. We were able to pull it off and sneak out of Buffalo with a win. That was a pretty amazing kick. It's pretty cool how everything was executed on that play. That one just really sticks out in my mind.""

- ""Everybody knows all of the kicker jokes but I always tried to be a good teammate,"" Elam said of his career. ""I wanted to be somebody that my teammates, my coaches, the fans and the organization could count on, on the field. But I also wanted to be a really good teammate to encourage the guys and let them know I was in their corner. I feel like that is a big role of a kicker. We don't just need to sit off all the time by ourselves during practice. We need to deliver on the field, but I also think that we need to be solid teammates and encouraging my friends there. I really hope I was able to pull that off. I had such a blast my entire career from start to finish and I got to play with some of the all-time greats. I wouldn't trade it for anything.""",2016-05-19 14:14:08+00:00,d3bldnj,1.0,t3_4k2jgy,1436,DenverBroncos
1532,"Great stuff from Plummer

Key Points:

- ""I hope that people are patient, not only with his development, but with wanting to push him out there too soon,"" Plummer said. ""If they do it right, and I can’t imagine (John) Elway and (Kubiak) not having some kind of master plan in working him along in the right way, they have a guy with a huge future. And with Sanchez there you’ve got a guy that’s highly capable of running the system. But coming from where Paxton is coming from to what he’ll do with the Broncos, he’s got some work to do.""

- ""I mean everybody talks, you don’t need to call plays from Pop Warner on to get it,"" Plummer said. ""But play calls will be different, and in a West Coast-type offense they are a little more wordy than some others. The good thing is the call works you through what everybody’s doing, but he’ll have get used to all of those concepts, the variations, and be ready to do that at game speed.""

- Plummer retrieved a ""simple"" pass play from his memory -- one that included a slot receiver with a tight end: ""Double wing right, 76, U shallow cross."" That speaks to the formation, pass protection call and the route of the primary receiver on the play.

""Double wing right is formation, 76 is protection, the U receiver has the cross, and that concept has other routes with it if you’re a receiver other than the U,"" Plummer said. ""So that call carries with it everybody else's responsibilities, and you can tweak the call to change the primary receiver, add motion, maybe flip the formation the other way. Those are all things he'll be working through.""

- A bread-and-butter play-action pass would be ""strong right slot, fake 38 stretch throwback"" and one of the longer calls, Plummer said, would be something on the order of ""shift to double wing right, Z fly, 76, U shallow cross.""

""What I’m doing is telling everybody I’m lining up in a bunch formation, when I say shift you are going back to a double wing,"" Plummer said. ""Again, it’s something he’ll adapt to, learn, but when you put that on top of learning everything else, that’s a time issue, a reps issue. He’s just got to do it over and over.""

- ""To me it’s him getting under center, the angles you take on the stretch (run) plays for the handoff, the angles you take to drop back to throw, that’s going to be a big learning curve,"" Plummer said. ""That is huge, the speed cut, curl route, basic cross, your five-step drop isn’t just, 'Hey take five steps', those change, you take an inch off, or three inches off, or quicken the third step on this certain route on this kind of a play. Your five-step drop, you can have three different five-step drops for three different routes, but it’s still a five-step drop.""

- ""And I’d get graded down a lot because there were times I would take a seven-step (drop) when I was supposed to take a five and throw the hitch,"" Plummer said. ""But I’d get away with it, because I had quick feet and I could still set up and throw it. But sometimes it would burn me. The key for me, for Paxton, or anybody is just to get to point where you play with a quiet mind and not counting, that you just feel it and throw. And for a young guy that’s just a lot of reps -- a lot -- not throw, just drop back, over and over.""",2016-05-19 14:07:20+00:00,d3bl3wg,1.0,t3_4k2lfr,245,DenverBroncos

1542,"Yes absolutely we are still a contender. We lost like two and a half starters on D (Malik, Trevathan, and Bruton who was our 3rd safety and special teams beast) so yes of course that will hurt a bit but what gets over looked is our depth on D. Trevathan and Malik weren't even in the top 5 of most important players on our D last year. We still have the entire no fly zone in CHJ, Talib, Ward, and Stewart. We still have Von and Ware. We still have upcoming pass rushers Ray and Barrett. We still have Wolfe on the D-line. We still have tackling machine Brandon Marshall at MLB. We addressed depth through the draft by adding two safeties and another D linemen to go with the depth we added through Jared Crick and Phil Taylor. I am absolutely not worried about our D remaining at an elite level. Now the QB situation is tough. One side argues that well Manning played like shit so we can have a shit QB again and win still. The other side argues that just won't happen. I personally don't want to take a gamble that we can have another successful year with shit QB play. We might have had shit QB play last year but it was still Manning. We don't have a Manning now. So shit QB play with Sanchez won't get by. Now there comes the question of will we get shit QB play with Sanchez or Lynch? Don't know. We have an abundance of weapons on offense to help our QB out and a successful system and strong coaching. We will absolutely be a super bowl contender if whoever our QB is plays just slightly better than our QB play was last year. ",2016-05-18 16:50:17+00:00,d3aewq6,3.0,t1_d3aee3d,656,nfl

1599,"Key Points:

- The Broncos notified free-agent veteran Brian Hoyer on Friday they will not be signing him to compete with Mark Sanchez for the starting job. The Broncos instead will go with the veteran Sanchez as their No. 1  quarterback with Lynch and Trevor Siemian, a rookie selected in the seventh round last year, competing as backups.

- John Elway, the Broncos’ general manager, is sticking with three quarterbacks because he wants Sanchez, Lynch and Siemian to get as many reps as possible. It’s difficult for four quarterbacks to split reps and get enough work.

- Elway may bring in a fourth quarterback later in the offseason. But for now he wants to keep the quarterback room and practice field to three.

- This means barring a monumental offseason upset, Sanchez will be the Broncos’ season-opening starter against the Carolina Panthers on Sept. 8.

1602,"This is all from an article on Denver Broncos website: 

""Lynch's average cap value would be $2,429,211 which is $13,571,789 less than the reported offer to Osweiler, and $15,571,789 below his average annual value on his Houston contract.

That is money that can go toward other players and keeping as much of the team together as possible.

Having a cost-controlled quarterback in his first seasons with a higher percentage of the cap going to other players, especially on defense, was what helped Seattle construct its dominant defense while Russell Wilson learned on the job. Now Wilson is on his second contract, and the Seahawks will adjust, but that bought time for Wilson to grow in the best possible situation -- with a ground game and a defense that complemented him and allowed him to work through his rough spots.

The money the Broncos save by having Lynch could help them retain Emmanuel Sanders, or keep the components of their elite defense as intact as possible for a longer period. This could help the Broncos maintain an elite defense, which would give Lynch a buffer as he develops; he wouldn't have to carry the team.

If Lynch flourishes, even his fifth-year option would allow the Broncos to have him at below market value in the 2020 season.

Elway often talks of winning ""from now on."" From his skill set to his intangibles to his financial value, Lynch gives the Broncos a chance to do precisely that""",2016-04-29 06:42:10+00:00,d2lssw2,1.0,t3_4gy7ct,868,DenverBroncos

1623,"From the article:

The cost of the 5th year option for Sylvester Williams for 2017 will be $6.757M if the Broncos choose to exercise that option.  If they do, the money will be guaranteed for injury, but not for skill or cap considerations until the first day of the 2017 NFL League season, on or about March 8, 2017 when it would become fully guaranteed.

I originally thought that using the 5th year option for Sly was a no brainer, After all, he's a relatively young player in his prime years, and while I wouldn't describe him as a superstar, he's solid at what he does, and just had the best year of his career with Wade and Kollar coaching him.  I also naively thought that the 5th year option was generally going to be a bargain for any decent 1st round player selected outside of the top 10.  Looking at numbers has changed my tune.  If the current highest average per year dollars for a 3-4 DT is $5M, $6.757M doesn't look like a bargain deal for Sly to me.

Maybe the Broncos would be better off to let him play out his current contract, and then consider trying to re-sign him to a competitive long term deal, or else replace him with a draft pick or a cheaper free agent, and hope for a future comp. pick.",2016-04-25 14:25:52+00:00,d2gjnd6,1.0,t3_4gd7td,4828,DenverBroncos

1631,"After calling Pederson a “quarterback-friendly” coach, Gruden pivoted.

“The problem I see right now in Philadelphia is they have too many quarterbacks to be friendly with,” Gruden said Thursday. “How are they going to distribute any reps and get anybody ready when you’ve got Sam Bradford making $18 million, you got Chase Daniel, who’s a backup, making $7 million?

“Now you’re going to have the No. 2 pick in the draft. I don’t know how you’re going to get these guys all reps and get them all ready, but Doug Pederson will have to answer that. That will be a challenge.”

“That’s the biggest challenge that they’re going to have,” Gruden said. “When you look at the amount of reps that you can have with your team, that number is substantially less than it was five years ago with this new collective bargaining agreement.

“So you’ve got to get a new head coach, who is running a new offensive system -- you’d better get it in quickly because the games are about to start. So who’s going to get the reps and who’s going to get the leftovers?

“You don’t have time to get three guys reps. You just don’t. If you do, then you’re not running a real sophisticated offense. It’s hard enough to get one guy ready today, let alone two.”

“There could be a trade,” he said, without mentioning Bradford specifically. “I don’t want to start any rumors in Philadelphia, but if they do draft a quarterback, with all they have invested in him, I’m sure they want to get him as many reps as possible.

“That’s going to make somebody unhappy and perhaps expendable.""

1656,"Key points:

- A source told 9News there has been zero discussion between Broncos general manager John Elway, the 49ers and Kaepernick in the past two weeks.

- Former Houston Texan quarterback Brian Hoyer was in Denver on Wednesday night eating dinner at a local steakhouse with members of the Broncos' coaching staff and personal department

- Hoyer will continue to meet Thursday with the Broncos at their team headquarters

- If the Broncos do sign Hoyer, he would compete with Mark Sanchez for the team's starting quarterback position. Trevor Siemian, a rookie last year, would continue to develop in year two

- The scheduled visit with Hoyer would indicate the Broncos are not confident they can acquire Kaepernick from San Francisco

- Kaepernick reported to the 49ers offseason program on April 4 and there has been little movement on his proposed trade talks since. However, don't rule  out Kaepernick quite yet. Just because the Broncos are visiting with Hoyer on Thursday doesn't mean they will sign him. And just because the Los Angeles Rams traded up to the No. 1 draft  spot and the Philadelphia Eagles traded up to No. 2 so they could take  Carson Wentz and Jared Goff -- or Goff and  Wentz -- doesn't mean the 49ers can't take quarterback Paxton Lynch  with their No. 7 overall  pick.

- If the 49ers wind up with a first-round quarterback on April 28, the expectation is they would expedite a trade involving Kaepernick.Then again if the Broncos sign  Hoyer on Thursday, their pursuit of Kaepernick would likely officially end.    ",2016-04-21 04:48:10+00:00,d2bcds3,1.0,t3_4frfzd,192,DenverBroncos

1675,"According to Andy Lindahl, who does the sideline reporting for the Broncos on 850 KOA and hosts an afternoon weekday radio show with Ed McCaffrey and Romi Bean on Denver Sports 760, Anderson looks as fit as he's ever seen. Lindahl said on his show on Monday that you can see that on Anderson's face.

It's always appeared Anderson was carrying added pounds on his face and belly. Lindahl said it looks like both are fit and trim.

Lindahl added that when he saw Anderson, it made him excited to see what he brings but also shows how serious he's taking this chance. 

That playoff performance is a great foundation to build on. Add the contract he got, a revamped offensive line and system that more resembles a Gary Kubiak offense in 2016, and the possibilities are limitless for Anderson. He can make his dreams of being a star running back in the NFL come true but also lead his team to a Super Bowl repeat.

""But the Broncos notorious hard-line approach to contracts hardly means that they’re trying to undercut linebacker Von Miller. Under the numbers reported by Charles Robinson of Yahoo Sports, who says the Broncos are offering $18 million per season while Miller wants $22 million annually, the Broncos are being more than reasonable, given the realities of the franchise tag.

Miller is due to make $14.129 million under the franchise tag this year. Next year, he’d get $16.95 million. That’s $31.079 million over two years, which would be earned only if Miller remains sufficiently healthy and effective to prompt the team to apply the tag again in 2017.

In 2018, Miller would be entitled to the quarterback franchise tender or $24.4 million, whichever is greater. That’s $55.4 million over three years, an average of $18.4 million.

So while the Broncos may be willing to squeeze players where the leverage supports a good squeezing, they’re definitely not squeezing Miller unfairly. If anything, the system would allow them to squeeze him a lot harder.""

1689,"From the article:

Spriggs is listed at 6'6', 301lbs and is incredibly athletic for an offensive tackle of his size. At February's NFL Scouting CombineSpriggs showed off his athleticism by testing at the top or near the top in all the testing drills he participated in. He showed a nice blend of size, speed, and strength at the combine which really helped his draft stock.

These athletic traits make him an ideal fit in Gary Kubiak's zone-blocking offense. Kubiak looks for athletic offensive lineman who move well and have ideal strength. So it makes sense that the Broncos are showing some sort of interest in Spriggs.

Spriggs is expected to go anywhere from the middle of the first round to the early second round, so would the Broncos look to draft Spriggs? That's an interesting question because the Broncos signed tackles Russell Okung andDonald Stephenson to free agent contracts this winter. So on paper, both tackle spots look to be filled. However, Okung's deal is basically a one-year deal and he comes with injury concerns, and Stephenson has yet to live up to his potential. So the argument could be made for the Broncos to select an offensive tackle early.

If available at 31, I think the Broncos would consider Spriggs, but needs at quarterback, defensive end, and safety could force the Broncos to wait until later in the draft to address the offensive tackle position.

1693,"From the article: 

Westerman is a 6'3"", 298lb guard who is an ideal fit for Gary Kubiak's zone-blocking scheme.

He has plus strength(34 bench press reps at the NFL Scouting Combine), outstanding athlete, moves very well, who has good technique, footwork, and agility. These traits are why he is considered to go in the top 45 to 50 picks in the NFL Draft. He is considered the second-rated guard behind Kansas State's Cody Whitehair, and could push to be one of the first interior lineman to go in this year's draft.

I think Westerman would be considered a day one starter for the Denver Broncos if they decided to draft him, likely in the second round. His skill set is exactly what Gary Kubiak covets at the guard position, and they may potentially have a need there.

Currently, second-year playersMax Garcia and Ty Sambrailo are penciled in as your starters at both guard positions, but neither is really a lock to keep it. Sambrailo will be making the transition from tackle to guard, and Garcia struggled at times during his rookie season.

One way this could work out is if Sambrailo competes for the right tackle job with recently signedDonald Stephenson and Westerman and Garcia would be your guards. This would work, but I think the scenario is unlikely. The Broncos spent a second-round pick on Sambrailo last season and would likely want to see him in the starting lineup. Also, they are paying Stephenson starter like money, so they would probably like to see him be the starter instead of a swing tackle.

Westerman is one of my favorite offensive lineman in the draft. Is a great fit in a zone-blocking scheme, great athleticism and agility, and also has plus strength. However, I really do not see a spot for him. As I said above, the Broncos would probably want to see their 2015 draft choices(Sambrailo and Garcia) to take over those spots. Drafting another means you will have a high draft pick likely sitting on the bench.

Tony Grossi of ESPN.com noted that there is ""nothing brewing"" as far as Thomas being involved in a blockbuster trade during the NFLdraft. However, he added ""we'll see.""

Sashi Brown, the Browns' executive vice president of football operations, emphasized on March 21 that the team has no desire to trade Thomas.  

""That's not our plan at all,"" Brown told Grossi. ""Our plan is not to trade Joe Thomas.""

Nevertheless, buzz surrounding a potential trade for Thomas has remained high. Grossi himself said he felt the team would trade Thomas before or at the draft, per ESPN Cleveland.

As Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports wrote on March 20, ""There are plenty of execs who believe the Browns should and will explore moving veteran left tackle Joe Thomas, one of the few valuable commodities they retain on a threadbare roster.""

La Canfora also noted that while Thomas would never request a trade, he would absolutely be open to a move to a contender. And it would be a logical move from Cleveland's perspective, as the team is fairly obviously in a rebuilding mode and could likely garner a first-round pick for Thomas and clear the $30 million he's owed over the next three years.

As Pat McManamon wrote, ""The strategy of the new regime...is to amass as many draft picks as possible.""

Thomas, 31, has gone to nine Pro Bowls in his nine seasons in the league, establishing himself as one of the top left tackles in the NFL. He's not the type of talent teams like losing, but the Browns are currently without an established quarterback, elite offensive weapons, a solid offensive line outside of Thomas and a top-notch defense. 

The front office will never come out and say it wants to trade Thomas—that would kill its leverage—but it's hard to imagine that if the rest of the NFL knows Thomas is the team's most valuable commodity, the Browns don't know that as well. If the team is all-in on another rebuilding effort through the draft, trading Thomas for picks has to at least be an option.

He also had a career completion percentage of 57.5% during his career at Michigan State. This past season for the Spartans, Cook totaled 3,131 yards passing, 24 touchdowns and 7 interceptions. In 2015, Cook was awarded the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and Big Ten Quarterback of the Year Award.

Scouting Report

- Strengths:

Played in a Pro Style offense

Worked under center and is comfortable doing things NFL teams will ask him to do

A gunslinger

Quickly goes through his reads

Has a quick release

Mobile and comfortable throwing on the move

Accurate deep thrower

Nice touch pass

Stands tall in the pocket and is not afraid to take a hit

Has an NFL arm

Shows good anticipation

Clutch on third downs

Aggressive quarterback

Probably the safest quarterback in this year's draft


- Weaknesses:

He's a gunslinger which leads to bad interceptions and over aggressiveness

Accuracy is a concern

Short and intermediate accuracy wasn't great

Inconsistent play

Doesn't always set his feet

Didn't do well when under pressure

Struggled in big games

Lower ceiling than the other top quarterback prospects

Leadership was questioned, but doesn't appear to be true


- Does Connor Cook fit with the Denver Broncos?

I could see it happening.

The Broncos need a quarterback and Connor Cook might be the most realistic option for the Broncos. Wentz and Goff will likely be off the board by the end of the top 10, and Paxton Lynch probably doesn't make it to the mid-20's, so that probably leabes Connor Cook the best quarterback available for the Broncos in the first round.

Cook would fit into Kubiak's offensive system rather well. He is already familiar with the pro-style aspects so that could be him day one ready. He has the athleticism to be effective on the bootlegs/roll outs, and while he doesn't have the strongest arm, he has a strong enough one to make all the throws asked of him.

I do not see him having the high ceiling as a Carson Wentz or Paxton Lynch have, but he could turn into a capable ""game manager"" who may turn into a good but not great NFL starter.

This might be a lazy comparison, but I compare him to two former Michigan State quarterbacks. Those two being Brian Hoyer and Kirk Cousins. All three have different strengths and weaknesses, but all three came from the same offense and both have the same upside. A game manager who could turn into a good but not great NFL starter. It is a lazy comparsion, but I like it.

I personally wouldn't love or really hate drafting Cook in the first round. I think the Broncos have enough talent on the team to be successful with Cook under center but I do not view him as the next Broncos Franchise quarterback. Just a guy who will do well enough to keep his job but will have fans looking for an upgrade four or five years down the road.

- Brandon Allen, Arkansas

Allen doesn’t look much like the typical NFL QB, but he was highly productive as the Razorbacks’ signal caller in 2015. The combination of short stature and small hands undoubtedly deters evaluators before they turn on the film, but simply ignoring the tape would be negligent. Allen graded as our sixth-overall draft-eligible quarterback in 2015 in terms of pure passing. He’s particularly effective throwing in the deep and intermediate range in the middle of the field. Digs, posts and crossing routes were executed with good location, enabling yards after the catch consistently. Designed bootlegs also play to Allen’s strengths. He lacks the arm to drive sideline passes from the pocket, but throws with good touch outside the numbers on the move. Pressure from the interior also isn’t debilitating, some of Adams’ most impressive throws came with defenders in his face. Overall he threw eight touchdowns against the rush in 2015 and recorded a positive grade. In addition, the ability to slide in the pocket to find open passing lanes stands out. Combined with a quick release, Allen took sacks on only 11 percent of dropbacks, good for sixth-best in the class. Despite his physical limitations, Allen would provide excellent value on Day 3.

- Vernon Adams Jr., Oregon

It’s remarkable how much success Russell Wilson has had outside the confines of his scripted offense. Like Wilson, Adams comes alive when the play breaks down. He possesses an instinctive awareness of the direction of the rush, enabling him to extend plays longer than the average mobile quarterback. Add in Adams’ ability to throw with precision from any platform, and it’s clear just how much of a nightmare the former Ducks’ quarterback can be to defend. Throwing on the run or from an awkward position is no issue for Adams, who frequently zipped passes into tight windows along the sideline or downfield once he escaped the pocket. No quarterback had a better rating than Adams’ 133.3 on plays lasting more than 2.6 seconds.

Aggression is part of Adams’ game, whether as part of the designed offense or once he breaks contain. Only two quarterbacks threw a higher percentage of passes deep than Adams’ mark of 23.9. He also ranked third with an accuracy percentage of 56.5 on 20+ yard passes, tossing 15 touchdowns (2nd) in the process. Adams is a gamebreaker, but also shows an ability to manipulate coverage. Staring down receivers is a major issue in college. Adams, however, showed an ability to look-off the centrefield safety in-season, as well as during his All-Star outing at the Shrine Game. A mid-round investment in Adams could turn into a steal down the road.

- Jacoby Brissett, North Carolina State

While Brandon Allen lacks a little upside, he could contribute pretty quickly in the NFL. Brissett, meanwhile, is at the opposite end of that spectrum. Whether he can develop the consistency and throwing precision to be a good NFL starter is unclear, but Brissett flashed outstanding potential at NC State. The large frame enables him to extend plays in the pocket. No quarterback proved as capable of withstanding hits as Brissett. His ability to extend plays, however, was not always an advantage. A sack rate of 22.2 percent was ninth-worst in the class. He also had the second-longest average time to throw amongst draft-eligible QBs (three seconds). NFL coaches will need to speed up his release at the next level.

Brissett’s arm is as strong as his frame. When he drives the ball to the sideline, it gets there in a hurry. The arm is also a big help for Brissett on downfield targets, where he’s fully capable of hitting receivers in stride. Consistency, though, remains an issue. Brissett put a number of deep passes in outstanding location against tight coverage, but would then miss wide open receivers running behind the defense. Although he remains raw, Brissett’s upside makes him worth a late-round investment.

- To land Booker, the Broncos would likely have to take him with either their No. 31 overall pick in the first round or No. 63 in the second. He may not last until No. 63.

- After they participate in the 40th Annual Boys Scouts of America Sports Breakfast on Thursday morning at the Pepsi Center, Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak and special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis will hustle back to the UCHealth Training Center to watch long snapper tryouts.

- There will be a group of long snappers of various experience at the audition, including Christian Yount, who snapped for the Cleveland Browns from 2011-14, and Sam Rodgers , a long snapper from Syracuse.

- The Broncos have a void at the position after they waived Aaron Brewer for behavioral reasons.

""Experience in the scheme mattered in formulating the depth on the Broncos' defensive line last year, and with the addition of five-year veteran Jared Crick on a two year-deal, it will be relevant again.

Crick joins the Broncos after four years with the Texans -- three of which came under Defensive Line Coach Bill Kollar, who jumped from Houston to the Broncos in the 2015 offseason. Crick's first two seasons also saw him work under Defensive Coordinator Wade Phillips and Head Coach Gary Kubiak, who added Crick as a fourth-round pick in the 2012 draft.

The 6-foot-4, 285-pound defensive end is expected to compete with Vance Walker and Kenny Anunike for playing time as the Broncos seek to replace Malik Jackson, who departed in free agency.

If Crick is to succeed, he will need to use his size, length and quickness. With 32-inch arms, he has the ability to rise and deflect passes at the line of scrimmage, a trait Kollar prizes in his defensive linemen.

Crick will not be the final piece of the defensive end puzzle. Kubiak said at the NFL Annual Meeting last month in Boca Raton, Fla. that he expected the Broncos to draft at least one defensive end. A deep class of three-technique ends makes that a continued likelihood from the Broncos' 2016 draft class.

But with Crick in place, the Broncos have five defensive ends on the roster with regular-season experience, as he joins Derek Wolfe, Walker, Anunike and George Uko, a practice-squad player last year who played briefly for the Buccaneers in 2014. Sylvester Williams, Darius Kilgo and Phil Taylor are set to compete on the inside at nose tackle.

Crick was credited with 27 quarterback hurries and 14 quarterback hits in the last two seasons, according to the statistics compiled by ProFootballFocus.com. Those go along with 5.5 sacks, eight passes defensed, 47 tackles and one forced fumble he accumulated in 31 starts as the Texans finished with 9-7 records in back-to-back years.

He played 31 of 32 games his first two seasons as he worked on a rotational basis under Phillips and Kollar. In those years, he was also working to overcome a knee injury and a torn pectoral muscle that cost him most of his senior season at Nebraska.""

From the article,

""Here are the moves the Broncos would have to consider to make the trade happen:

— Cutting/Trading Ryan Clady. Clady has been injured for most of the last three seasons and cutting him would create $8.9 million in cap room. The Broncos already signed Russell Okung to play left tackle so this would seem like the most logical move. Clady could also take a pay cut to stay in Denver. It would be near impossible to see this trade occurring and Clady’s contract remaining as is.

— Including Mark Sanchez in the trade. If the Broncos believe strongly in Kaepernick as the starter, there is little reason to carry Sanchez instead of a lower-cost veteran as a backup. Sanchez has a history with 49ers coach Chip Kelly and a trade would save $4.5 million in cap space, which is not enough to make the trade alone but would help the team’s cap situation overall.

— Extending Emmanuel Sanders. Sanders is in the final year of his contract and will count for $6.6 million on the cap. He'll be 29 this season and 30 if he hit free agency. Though Sanders has been terrific for the Broncos, the general market for players like Sanders has not been huge, which might make this an easier negotiation. They could create a few million by extending him.

— Cut Britton Colquitt. Colquitt is a fine punter, but they can save $3.25 million by releasing him and when you have a tight cap situation like the Broncos, specialists are always in danger. Last year Colquitt took a $1.4 million pay cut to stay in Denver and at the least he will be expected to do similaraly this year, likely cutting his salary by $1.6 million.

— Signing Von Miller to a long-term contract. Miller counts for $14.1 million on the Broncos cap as their franchise player and the team could cut that in half with a long-term contract. While this deal may get done, it is unlikely that it would get done before the July deadline to extend franchise-tagged players. Miller is looking to become the highest-paid defensive player in the NFL and those are not contracts that are rushed into by either side.",2016-04-06 16:55:37+00:00,d1sbrv8,1.0,t3_4dmln3,443,DenverBroncos

1814,"The Denver Broncos are putting the final touches on their draft board with the 2016 NFL draft less than one month away. At the end of April in Chicago, NFL teams will do their best to find impact players who could shine at the next level.

With a few weeks in April ahead of us, many mock drafts around the Web have the Broncos taking a quarterback to fill their biggest need on the team. These mocks could quickly change if (when?) the Broncos trade with the San Francisco 49ers for Colin Kaepernick. General manager John Elway may indeed take a passer at some point in the draft, but with the team’s first pick, he could choose to pick from a talent-rich linebacker class.

The player who may be best suited for replacing Danny Trevathan is Notre Dame linebacker Jaylon Smith. Even though his status for the start of the 2016 season is up in the air due to a major knee injury suffered in his final game with the Fighting Irish, Smith may have All-Pro upside that is too good to pass up.

One of the most interesting mock drafts comes from Bleacher Report’s Matt Miller, and he’s got the Broncos taking Smith with the 31st overall pick.

In this article, we’ll make the case for Smith to be the Broncos’ top choice in the 2016 NFL draft.


**College Career**

Over the last two years, Smith was one of the most productive defenders for the Fighting Irish defense. During that time, he was able to compile 133 solo tackles and 18 tackles for loss. Add in his assisted tackles, and Smith went over 100 total tackles (111, 114) each of the last two seasons. A productive leader, Smith knows how to get the best out of his natural ability.

In his final game with Notre Dame, Smith suffered a gruesome knee injury that has his football career in question. In the Fiesta Bowl against Ohio State, Smith tore his ACL and LCL in his left knee.

At the NFL Scouting Combine, Smith expressed confidence about his eventual return to full strength: “[I’ll return] as soon as possible. I can’t tell when I’ll be back, but I’ll be back 100 percent.”

Knee injuries aren’t quite as devastating as they used to be, and players are able to come back quicker than ever before. However, this is a much more severe injury, and possible nerve damage becomes the larger concern.

Smith said there was no nerve damage with this injury.

“No, the nerve wasn’t stretched at all,"" Smith said. ""It’s just the healing game. That’s all. It’s a process. I’ll be back 100 percent. We just don’t know when.”

He’s likely drawn a red flag from many teams due to the severity of this knee injury. In fact, Charles Robinson of Yahoo Sports reported that three teams have taken Smith off their boards for the draft. Smith is an impressive player, but he’ll need to check out medically before the Broncos (or any team) use a premium pick on him.

**Skill Set**

Smith has the ability to play every linebacker spot in a 3-4 defense. He’s got the instincts to find the play quickly, and he’s got the athleticism to get there in a hurry. Smith is a three-down player who can shine in multiple ways.

Measuring in at 6’3”, 240 pounds, Smith has the size to work as a forceful run-stopper. He does a good job of diagnosing plays as they unfold in front of him, and Smith has no problem getting his hands dirty between the tackles. He’s a solid wrap-up tackler who doesn’t let an opponent in his grasp get away.

Smith has high football intelligence and can call out defensive adjustments for his teammates. In today’s pass-happy league, Smith should have no problem covering athletic ""move"" tight ends on shorter routes or down the seam.

In addition to his run-stuffing and coverage ability, a team can also ask Smith to rush the passer. He only had 4.5 sacks as a collegian, but Smith has the length and fluid athleticism to make up the distance to a quarterback quickly. Pass rushing is an untapped aspect of Smith’s game.

Smith feels his all-around game is his biggest strength as a linebacker.

“I can pass-rush, I can cover, I can stuff and check consistently,"" Smith said. ""It’s just being able to be in the right spot at the right time. That’s something I challenge myself on each and every play.”

**The Competition**

The Broncos have some interesting linebackers already on the roster ready to take over for Trevathan. They’ve found these guys in various ways (waivers, draft, college free agency), and the Broncos have compiled a nice collection of players with various skill sets.

Todd Davis may be the first to get a chance at Trevathan’s old spot. Picked up after the New Orleans Saints waived him multiple times in 2014, Davis shows natural violence when arriving at the ball-carrier. He’s more of a physical presence than Trevathan, and Davis can intimidate on the field with the way he quickly and forcefully brings a player down. While he’s more of a thumper, Davis is not as athletic—thus as good in coverage—as Trevathan. There’s a chance Davis could play strong-side inside linebacker if the team wants to move Brandon Marshall over to the weak side.

After his college career with the Oklahoma Sooners, Corey Nelson was selected by the Broncos in the seventh round of the 2014 NFL draft. Nelson came into the league after showing well as a special teams player, but he’s an intriguing potential starter at linebacker because of his upside as a pass-rusher. Nelson has good burst off the line of scrimmage, and he can quickly maneuver his feet to get around blockers on his way to the quarterback. While his instincts might not be as sharp as Davis', Nelson has the natural athleticism to work well in coverage.

Perhaps the most interesting player on the roster with the potential to replace Trevathan is second-year pro Zaire Anderson. Last year after the draft, the Broncos were able to add Anderson as a college free agent. He’s a little light at 220 pounds, and Anderson can be moved out of the way if an offensive lineman gets him in his grasp. Anderson has the quickness and range to shine in coverage, and he was known as a tackling machine during his time in college at Nebraska. As a senior for the Cornhuskers, Anderson led the team with 103 total tackles. His nose for the ball and his ability to scrape and flow to the play make him a player to watch in camp.

**Summary**

Based on their drafting history, the Broncos won’t shy away from a player who enters the season with question marks about his health.

Smith understands how NFL teams can be leery with this type of injury, which may cost him part or all of the 2016 season, but he’s looking at the big picture.

“It’s a long-term decision for whoever drafts me,"" Smith said. ""I’m a guy who will be around for a while playing at an elite level. An impact player. ... It’s great watching a guy like Todd Gurley do it last year and come back almost midseason and perform. It’s very encouraging.”

The Broncos have the depth on defense to wait on a pick like Smith. Recent reports seem positive about his recovery, and other teams' shyness could pay off for the Broncos if the talented linebacker falls to the end of the first round. Eric Edholm of Yahoo Sports reported that Smith is able to leg press over 600 pounds.

The Broncos defense is chock-full of talent, and adding Smith could potentially give defensive coordinator Wade Phillips and company another elite-level player to scheme with in 2016.",2016-04-04 13:54:21+00:00,d1pb6z0,1.0,t3_4db5ci,120,DenverBroncos
1815,"Key points from the article:

- The Denver Broncos reached out to Hillman last week and communicated their interest in possibly bringing back the running back. However, several other teams are also interested in Hillman and every NFL team has more available salary cap space than the Broncos.

- Anderson will be the Broncos’ No. 1 back in 2016 as he has already received $5.225 million in the form of a roster bonus from his new deal.  Interest in Hillman was slow through the first two weeks of free agency but has since picked up. The Broncos' only experienced backup to Anderson is Juwan Thompson, who has shown flashes in his first two seasons but has struggled to stay healthy.",2016-04-04 04:52:28+00:00,d1p048a,1.0,t3_4d9gh5,3270,DenverBroncos
1816,"Key points of the article:

- Sanchez is holding his annual passing camp Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in Orange County, this time with Broncos receivers, tight ends, running backs and quarterback mate Trevor Siemian.

- “It shows he wants to come in and get to know us before OTAs start,” Broncos receiver Bennie Fowler said Sunday afternoon from California. “I think it’s really good. It’s going to help us get off to a good start.”

- The three-day session will include offensive whiteboard sessions followed by route-running and passing.

- The Broncos’ administration and coaches have nothing to do with the passing camp.  Sanchez will serve as camp organizer and offensive coordinator. He will take all his teammates out to dinner one night.

- “From a distance I figured we’ll probably add somebody,” Siemian said, referring to another experienced quarterback. “And we’ll probably draft somebody. I’ll be ready to have four guys when we go to training camp.’’

- “He’s taken the Jets to two AFC Championship Games, he’s been in the league for a long time,”  Fowler said. “He’s a good player.  This will be a good situation.”

1823,"Key points:

- The Broncos ended business Friday, even as they tried to close a deal with Kaepernick, with $1.62 million worth of salary cap room, according to the NFL Players Association. That is barely enough room for them to pay their first-round selection in the coming draft and certainly not in the same salary-cap galaxy to add Kaepernick's contract as it stands. Kaepernick, if he doesn't make any changes to his contract, is due $11.9 million base salary for the 2016 season.

- The Broncos have tried to trade Clady in recent weeks and there are teams with interest. They may have a difficult time dealing him, however, since every team knows their situation. They may be forced to release Clady before the draft since that would give them $8.9 million worth of additional salary-cap room.

- They simply have to make a move with Clady if they have a chance to complete any deal for Kaepernick, which would send a mid-round pick to the San Francisco 49ers -- most likely a fifth-round pick -- and Kaepernick agrees to a major re-structuring of his deal.

- With the draft still almost a month away, teams have been inclined to wait out the Broncos. And from their perspective, the Broncos have tried to combat that by publicly suggesting they would be willing to keep Clady and don’t feel compelled to rush into “a bad move.’’

- But the fact remains that until the Broncos create more cap space, they aren’t going to be able to do anything, including make their draft picks. They also have limited choices. They can release Clady, or potentially punter Britton Colquitt($4 million against the salary cap), but releasing players will continue to add “dead money’’ to their cap. “Dead money’’ is a salary-cap charge for players no longer on the roster and the Broncos already have added plenty in the offseason.

- They had less than $1 million in dead money on the books for 2016 just after their Super Bowl 50 win, and that total is now $7.23 million. Releasing or trading Clady would add $1.2 million more in ""dead money"" and releasing Colquitt would add $750,000 more.

- To create some additional cap space, the Broncos could go to players with some of the larger contracts on the team, such as wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, cornerback Aqib Talib or cornerback Chris Harris and turn some of their base salaries into a signing bonus for a renegotiation.

- That would lower the salary-cap figure for those players, but it would require the Broncos to hand out cash immediately for those signing bonuses. And cash flow is also something they have an eye on, with their attempt to get a deal done forVon Miller that could top $60 million in guarantees.",2016-04-03 15:01:11+00:00,d1o3ys0,1.0,t3_4d6f2j,284,DenverBroncos
1824,"Key points:

- The Broncos are willing to pay $7 million, a source confirmed to ESPN. But Denver and Kaepernick would like the San Francisco to pay the remaining $4.9 million; the 49ers have been unwilling, according to a source, believing they should not have to pay for a player they'd like to keep on their roster. Kaepernick has also been unwilling to forfeit the $4.9 million to make the deal work, according to a source.

- A high-level source says ""it would take two seconds"" for the teams to finalize the proposed deal. The compensation in the trade is a nonissue, per sources familiar with deal. It will be a midround pick and sources from both teams said that will not be any holdup and they can ""finalize it with one phone call.""

- Kaepernick and Denver have made progress on the other years in the quarterback's contract, which runs through 2020, leaving the 2016 season as the only obstacle, according to a source.

It's amazing how he tied for first for forced fumbles in the whole league given his little playing time compared to others that is just ridiculous. I always pictured Shaq larger than Von but you're right in the sense he plays bigger than he is. Those plays you linked are awesome, I could watch those all night. His stats back at CSU are also very impressive so he has made plays his whole career. I guess the only concern I have, and maybe I haven't seen enough film, but can he be a ""run stuffer""? I mean OLB generally are not primarily run stuffers but guys like Von and Ware do a great job at breaking the edge and creating tackles for losses. I am not worried about Shaq as a pass rusher, he has a sick bull rush and he is becoming ever more dangerous with his hands. I just am wondering if he will continue to develop into a solid run stuffer to become that pro bowl OLB. Great analysis man I always enjoy your opinions.

- One prospect who the Broncos are considering taking in the first-round of the 2016 NFL Draft is former Ole Miss defensive lineman Robert Nkemdiche. In fact, the Broncos hosted the talented defensive lineman on Thursday. He is a 6'3"", 294lb defensive lineman who is considered one of the riskier picks in the draft. Nkemdiche is ranked as the 25th overall prospect in the 2016 NFL Draft according to CBS Sports, and the 5th overall defensive tackle in this year's draft.

- During Nkemdiche's three-year career at Ole Miss he totaled 81 tackles, 16 tackles for a loss, and 6 sacks. This past season he totaled 26 tackles, 7 tackles for a loss, and 3 sacks.

He looks the part, size, frame, thickness, and carries his size well

Powerful

Explosive off the line

Moves well for a man that big

Unblockable in one on one situations

Shows elite lateral quickness for a man of his size

Clogs running lanes

Showed improvement as a pass rusher

Has a nice spin move

- Weaknesses:

So many red flags

Character questions

Work ethic is questioned

Arrested for marijuana possession after taking a fall from an Atlanta area hotel room

Multiple run-ins with the law

Tons of talent but does he want to be great?

He was suspended from Ole Miss's bowl game after the incident

Admitted to being lazy

Inconsistent effort on the field

Doesn't have the production you would expect, but was double and triple teamed

Needs to develop more pass rush moves

Plays out of control

Needs to improve his on the field discipline

- Does Robert Nkemdiche fit with the Broncos?

Hard to say.

If you watch the tape, his talent and athleticism jump out to you. When he is giving it his 100%, he is unstoppable. He has the size, speed, power, explosiveness, and just elite talent you look for in a defensive lineman. He should be a top 5 talent in this year's draft.

However, there are so many red flags. Top 5 talent, but fifth round character.

He has drug problems, character questions, his work ethic is questioned, and some even question if he wants to be great. Does he have the fire inside of him that the great ones do?

I know the Broncos have a strong locker room and defensive line coach Bill Kollar is probably the best in the business, but it takes effort from both ends.

The Broncos environment could change him, or he could be suspended and be a huge bust. He is probably the biggest boom or bust in this year's draft.

If he falls to pick 31, I think the Broncos should consider him, but I would much rather go with a Vernon Butler, Jihad Ward, or Chris Jones. This draft is so deep at this position where I don't think the risk is worth it.

I know some of you will point to Shane Ray and Bradley Roby as instances where the Broncos took a chance on a character risk, but it's not even comparable. Ray and Roby had minor off the field issues, Nkemdiche's are so much more concerning, at least to me.

I talked myself into and out of Nkemdiche like three or four times while writing this up. I get both sides of the argument, but ultimately I would pass on Nkemdiche in the first round. Now if he fell into the second round? That would be a different story.

1833,"From the article: 

This safety class isn't very deep, but Green is considered one of the top free safeties in this year's class. He has size, speed, athleticism, and raw potential to grow into a big-time NFL starter.

Green is listed at 6'2"", 209lbs and ran a 40 time of 4.34 at February'sNFL Scouting Combine. He is your prototypical height/weight/speed prospect that some teams covet in the draft.

Green only really has one year of production under his belt. This past season for Clemson he totaled 95 tackles, 5.5 tackles for a loss, and one sack. He played primarily deep free safety for Clemson, so his tape is a bit limited because of that. What teams like his is raw potential, athletic traits, and his size.

I say he is a raw prospect because he was a receiver for Clemson during his Freshman year there. After that season, the Clemson coaches moved him to safety and obviously that move paid off. He is still learning the position but has all the traits to become a starter in this league.

The Broncos are in need of some safety depth after losing backup David Bruton Jr. to theWashington Redskins during free agency. Also, their other backupOmar Bolden is expected to sign with the Chicago Bears, so that leaves the Broncos pretty thin at the safety position behind startersDarian Stewart and T.J. Ward.

Speaking of Stewart, he is a free agent after this season and could be looking for a big payday if he has another solid season in 2016. So the Broncos could be looking for his replacement in the draft.

I expect the Broncos to draft at least one safety in this year's NFL Draft and I think Green would be a solid fit for the Broncos.

Could be a boom or bust quarterback prospect

- Does Paxton Lynch fit with the Denver Broncos?

It's a fit I want to see happen.

Lynch is a developmental quarterback prospect. You normally do not see these type of quarterbacks going in the first round, but there's already enough there to warrant a first round pick. He his big, tall, athletic, great arm, and was productive in college.

Could he start day one? Maybe if you have him in a watered down/quarterback-friendly offense and let him make plays with his athleticism. That's exactly what the Broncos could provide him on the offensive side of the ball. He reminds many of Brock Osweiler, but more athletic. He could run the bootleg, throw on the run, run the ball, and throw it deep if need be. Plus the Broncos a top ranked defense to make things easier for Lynch.

I think it is an ideal fit for both sides.

Now if the Broncos want Lynch, they more than likely need to trade up to select him. There are probably three first-round quarterbacks in this year's draft, and at most nine NFL teams who all could take Lynch in the first round before the Broncos pick at 31. Those teams being theCleveland Browns at 2, Dallas Cowboys at 4, San Fransisco 49ersat 7, Philadelphia Eagles at 8, Los Angeles Rams at 15, Buffalo Billsat 19, New York Jets at 20, Kansas City Chiefs at 28, and the Arizona Cardinals at 29.

Now Carson Wentz and Jared Goff are likely to go in the top 10, so that leaves Lynch to go to either the Rams, Bills, Jets, Chiefs and Cardinals. The Rams are moving to LA and are in need of a quarterback so they could look to Lynch as their new Franchise guy. The Bills have Tyrod Taylor but have been looking at quarterbacks throughout this entire process. The Jets might be in the market for a quarterback if they cannot signRyan Fitzpatrick, and the Chiefs recently brought in Lynch in for a visit so there could be some interest there. Carson Palmer isn't getting any younger so they could look at Paxton Lynch as their quarterback of the future.

Denver Broncos General Manager John Elway will need to figure out which teams are really after Lynch and try to move up ahead of them if he feels they are also after him. He also has to watch out for a team moving back into the first round to select Lynch.

If Lynch is the guy Elway wants, he will find a way to draft him.

1839,"1. Alfred Morris, running back, Dallas Cowboys (signed two-year, $3.5 million contract): There's high potential for value here with the two-time Pro Bowler stationed behind one of the NFL's top offensive lines. After three straight 1,000-yard seasons, Morris plummeted to just 3.7 yards per carry last year in Washington. The Redskins let him walk, but Morris -- just 27 -- has a shot to unseatDarren McFadden for early-down carries in Dallas. Drafting a featured back would put both veterans on the hot seat, but Morris is a strong candidate to outplay his contract.

2. Charles Johnson, pass rusher, Carolina Panthers (re-signed one-year, $3 million contract): Johnson is making pennies after a dominant postseason and powerful showing in Super Bowl 50. His durability remains a concern, but thePanthers have a major bargain on their hands if he stays upright. This deal serves as another thrifty masterstroke by general manager Dave Gettleman.

3. Chris Long, pass rusher, New England Patriots (signed one-year, $2.375 million contract): Bill Belichick has made a cottage industry of landing inexpensive but proven veterans on the open market. Long hasn't been himself the past two seasons, but a fresh start in New England will help -- even at age 31. With Chandler Jones shipped to Arizona, Long has an opportunity to see plenty of snaps and chase after his 8.5 sacks from 2013.

4. Prince Amukamara, cornerback,Jacksonville Jaguars (signed one-year, $5 million contract): The Jaguars spent a hill of scratch on the open market, padding their needy defense with tackle Malik Jackson and safety Tashaun Gipson. Adding Amukamara to the mix was a crafty move by general manager David Caldwell. Set to start opposite Davon House, Amukamara comes relatively cheap for a player many expected to ink a multiyear pact.

5. Jared Cook, tight end, Green Bay Packers (signed one-year, $2.75 million contract): We've beaten this horse all week, but Cook fills an immediate void for the Packers, who haven't fielded a true pass-catching tight end since Jermichael Finley in 2013. ""Personality-wise we're different. Playing-wise, you can see some comparisons in our games,"" Cook said of Finley. If that plays out, a rare venture into the open market will pay off for Green Bay.

6. Chris Hogan, wide receiver, New England Patriots (signed three-year, $12 million contract with $7.5 million guaranteed): When Belichick chases after restricted free agents, we pay attention. Hogan was far from a top target in Buffalo, but he might push Danny Amendola off the roster in New England. Belichick is impressed with Hogan's football IQ and views the wideout as a versatile asset. He's bigger than Amendola and Julian Edelman, and has the tools to line up in the slot or play the X. 

7. Jeremy Lane, cornerback, Seattle Seahawks (re-signed four-year, $23 million contract with $11 million guaranteed): It's more money than anyone else on this list, but Lane's signing came and went without much fanfare. ""I was really happy to get Jeremy back,"" coach Pete Carroll said during last week's Annual Meeting, noting that the combination of Lane and DeShawn Sheadopposite Richard Sherman gives Seattle""the best flexibility we've ever had."" No team does a better job of grooming young corners, making this signing an under-the-radar victory for the 'Hawks.

8. Brandon Boykin, slot corner, Carolina Panthers (signed one-year, $840K contract): He's far from a perfect player, but Boykin gives the Panthers instant relief in the slot with Bene' Benwikeremoving outside across from Josh Norman. Boykin was a ghost out of the gate for the Steelers in 2015, but his role in Pittsburgh ballooned down the stretch with a solid postseason.

Scouting Report

- Strengths:

High motor guy

Explosive off the snap

Powerful

Strong hands

Holds up against the point of the attack

Good nose for the ball

Competitive in the trenches

Generates a powerful bull rush

Above average change of direction skills

Has a second gear to chase down a ball carrier

A run stuffer

Versatile

Excellent tackler who did give up any broken or missed tackles

- Weaknesses:

Overaggressive at times

Needs to improve as pass rusher

Needs to add some size to his frame

Gets taken out of plays by double teams

Not a ""quick twitch"" athlete

Lower body stiffness

Some tweener traits

Plays through injuries, but is often banged up

- Does Jonathan Bullard fit with the Broncos?

I think so.

The Broncos will be looking for a guy who can help replace Malik Jackson, and Bullard could be that guy. He isn't the pass rusher Jackson is, but he is a powerful run stuffer who could start opposite ofDerek Wolfe.

Bullard actually reminds me a little of Wolfe. He is a blue collar, high energy, powerful run stuffer who could grow into a better pass rusher, much like Wolfe did.

Bullard is an improving player and the type of player I could see defensive line coach Bill Kollar love coaching up.

He wouldn't be my top choice to replace Malik Jackson, but I think he could turn into a solid NFL player. Ideally, the Broncos would be able to get him in the second round, but likely they would need to draft him at 31 if they want him

1871,"Key Points:

- One prospect the Denver Broncos are showing interest in and may select in the first two rounds of the 2016 NFL Draft is Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott. He is a 6'2"", 226lb quarterback who is considered one of the top second-tier quarterback prospects in the draft. Prescott is ranked as the 106th overall prospect in the 2016 NFL Draft according to CBS Sports, and is ranked as the 6th best quarterback in the draft.

- During his four years at Mississippi State, Prescott has totaled 9,376 yards passing, 70 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. Prescott also has a career completion percentage of 62.8%. He has also rushed for 2,521 career rushing yards with 41 career touchdowns. Prescott totaled 11,897 combined yards and a total of 111 career touchdowns during his time at Mississippi State. This past season Prescott totaled 3,793 yards passing, 29 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. He also had 588 rushing yards with 10 rushing touchdowns. He totaled 4,381 yards and 39 total touchdowns in 2015.

Height: 6'2"" 

Weight: 226lbs 

40 time: 4.79 seconds

Vertical: 32.5 inches 

Broad Jump: 116.0 inches(Top performer in his class)

3 Cone Drill: 7.11 seconds

Scouting Report

- Strengths:

Thick and muscular frame

He has 536 career rushing attempts in the SEC, so he has proven to be tough

Stands tall in the pocket

Has shown improvement in his game this past year

Shows good awareness as a passer

Tough runner

Can extend plays with his legs

Lots of potential

Ideal arm strength

Can throw strikes or throw with finesse

Intelligent

Leader on and off the field at Miss State

High Character guy(despite his recent DUI)

- Weaknesses:

A lot of wear and tear in college

Accuracy issues on deep to intermediate passes

Needs to work on his pocket awareness

Reads his progressions too slowly

Needs to lead his receivers more

Didn't play in a pro-style offense

Raw and needs work but will he reach his ceiling?

Needs work on his footwork

His mechanics need work

Needs work but getting there

DUI arrest in early March

- Does quarterback Dak Prescott fit with the Broncos?

He does, and the Broncos are apparently high on him.

The Broncos will have quarterback prospect Dak Prescott in for a formal visit/workout in early April, and are reportedly enamored with him.

""The Broncos loved North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz, but know that he won't be getting anywhere near Denver's pick. However, the team also is enamored with Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott. He is a good fit in Gary Kubiak's offense and sources say that Prescott is in play for the Broncos on the second-day of the draft.""

Prescott impressed scouts, GM's, and coaches at the Senior Bowl and Combine this year. He showed intelligence, leadership, and overall football character. Team's were reportedly raving over this before Prescott was arrested for a DUI in early March.

This was a big step back for a guy who had a ton of positive momentum before this. He has owned up to his mistake, and hopefully, will only be a one-time thing for him.

Now, I think Dak would fit well into Gary Kubiak's offense. It's friendly for the quarterback, and he and team could rely on his athleticism early on as he develops as an NFL passer.

A strong running game and a strong defense are things the Broncos can provide for an inexperienced rookie quarterback. It is what the Patriots did with Tom Brady early in his career, it is what the Steelers gave Ben Roethlisberger early in his career, and what the Seattle Seahawks gave Russell Wilson during their two Super Bowl runs.

Figuring out where Prescott could go is a bit difficult right now. How much did the DUI hurt his stock? Before I thought Prescott at 31 could be a possibility if Paxton Lynch was off the board. Now? Maybe in the second round or maybe even in the third round.

Now, if the Broncos trade for Colin Kaepernick this may change their draft plans at quarterback. Until that does or does not happen it is safe to assume that they draft a quarterback early in the draft.",2016-03-28 14:13:34+00:00,d1gbw1b,1.0,t3_4caad9,144,DenverBroncos

We were going to take a knee, act like we were walking off, have them go off, come back, snap the ball and run for a touchdown. That was our plan. New England has always got something up their sleeve. Kind of the same situation. Our guys were kind of exiting and getting away. (Coach Gary Kubiak) was right there doing the same thing, so I was just making sure I was ready to make a tackle. I was making sure they weren’t doing that, because you never know.

Jones is ranked as the 74th overall prospect in the 2016 NFL Draft according to CBS Sports, and is ranked as the 10th best defensive tackle in the draft.

During Jones's three-year career at Mississippi State, he totaled 94 tackles, 17.5 tackles for a loss, 8.5 sacks, and 10 pass deflections. This past season he totaled 36 tackles, 7 tackles for a loss, 2.5 sacks, and 4 pass deflections.

Scouting Report

- Strengths:

Great tackler

Clogs running lanes and attacks the ball carrier

Uses his long arms to his advantage

Hard worker on the practice field and weight room

Versatile player who lined up in multiple spots along the line

Great body control

Explosive off the snap

Tons of potential

- Weaknesses:

Plays a little tall sometimes

Inconsistent pad level

Needs more pass rushing moves

His motor runs out of gas if the play carries on too long

One year wonder

Raw player who needs work

- Does Chris Jones fit with the Broncos?

Perfect fit!

He is your prototypical 3-4 defensive end. Has the size, length, long arm, strength, and explosion. I think he could step in and play right away for the Broncos, and potentially start opposite of Derek Wolfe in the Broncos base 3-4 defense. He has the pass rushing skills to move inside on passing down and provide interior pressure to the quarterback.

He is the type of prospect I can see Broncos defensive line coach Bill Kollar getting the most of. He has a great skill set and just needs a coach to get him pointed in the right direction.

Jones was a strong option for the Broncos in the late first round, but a recent arrest may have hurt his stock.Chris Jones, who was stopped for speeding then arrested for driving with a suspended license according to Pro Football Talk.

It will be interesting to see if this arrest affects Jones's draft stock. If so, the Broncos could potentially snag Jones in the second round.

I think he will be the perfect replacement for Malik Jackson in Denver.

1905,"The Broncos scouts have been at all the top Pro Days these past few weeks. They attended Ohio State's, Alabama's, Clemson's, LSU's, Penn State, UCLA's and others. So let's take a look the prospects the Broncos have been showing the most interest in:

- LSU Cornerback Rashard Robinson

According to Walter Football's draft insider Tony Pauline, the Broncos met with the physically gifted Robinson during LSU's Pro Day.

Robinson is listed at 6'1"", 171lbs and ran a 4.43 40 time at LSU's pro day earlier this week. He tested much better at his pro day than he did at the Combine because he was one of many prospects who caught the flu bug that week.

Robinson is one of these prospects full of raw talent and would be a first round pick if they did not have character questions surrounding them.

Here is what a former SEC defensive backs coach had to say about Robinson.

""I'm not sure he's a bad kid, but I know he hates school. He's really tough -- ­typical south Florida kid. You know what you get. The interviews will work themselves out for better or worse, but you keep things simple for him and let him chase one guy around the field all day. He's really good at that.""

John Elway usually ends up drafting a cornerback or two during the NFL Draft, so it makes sense that the team is doing their homework on Robinson. He has lots of raw athleticism, and could be a steal in the mid rounds of April's NFL Draft.

- Ohio State Tight End Nick Vannett

The Denver Broncos were among the teams that met with the Ohio State tight end after his Pro Day workout earlier this week per Walter Football.

The 6'6"", 257lb tight end had a pretty good workout. He ran a 4.85 40 time, had a 29.5 inch vertical, and a 9 foot, 5-inch broad jump.

I expect the Broncos to add a tight end during the NFL Draft. They released veteran Owen Daniels and are a little thin at the tight end position currently. They have blocking specialist Virgil Green and 2015 third round pick Jeff Heuerman at tight end but neither has proven to be starter material in the NFL just yet. So adding a tight end within the first four rounds seems likely.

Nick Vannett would give the Broncos another big weapon in the middle of the field and would reunite him with his former Ohio State teammate Jeff Heuerman.

- Alabama Pro Day

The Broncos and the rest of the NFL were present at the Alabama Pro Day earlier this month to check out the long list of potential NFL players they have available for this year's NFL Draft.

They have three defensive players who will likely be first round picks, and would fill an area of need for the Broncos. Those players being defensive tackle's A'Shawn Robinson and Jarran Reed, and inside linebacker Reggie Ragland.

Robinson is likely a top 10 to 15 pick and Reed is probably a top 20 pick. Both figure to be high on the Broncos draft board(they reportedly love Jarran Reed), but it would take a big trade up to get either player.

Ragland figures to be the next Alabama inside linebacker to have success in the NFL. He could fall near or to the Broncos, so he will be a name to watch in the coming days and weeks.

Then you have the guys who could be late first round picks or go early in the second round. Those players being center Ryan Kelly and running backDerrick Henry.

The Broncos seem set with Matthew Paradis at center so I doubt they will look at Kelly early. The same can be said about Derrick Henry. With C.J. Anderson back with the team, I do not see the Broncos spending a high draft pick on a running back. I'd expect them to select a speedier guy in the middle rounds of the draft.

Speaking of speedier backs in the middle rounds of the draft, an option for the Broncos will be Kenyan Drake. The explosive running back is expected to be a late day two selection.

- Quarterback Christian Hackenberg

Penn State held its Pro Day on Thursday and the Denver Broncos were among the teams paying close attention to quarterback prospect Christian Hackenberg.

The Broncos are in need of a quarterback after Brock Osweilerbolted for the Houston Texans early in free agency and Hackenberg could be that guy.

Hackenberg reportedly had a pretty solid Pro Day performance and threw the ball great one NFL evaluator told NFL Network's Kim Jones. He also reportedly completed 44 of 52 passes during his Pro Day and had a streak of 21 straight which drew some ""wows"" from the crowd.

Hackenberg is considered one of the second tier quarterbacks behind Carson Wentz, Jared Goff, and Paxton Lynch. He is competing with Connor Cook, Cardale Jones, and Dak Prescott

If the Broncos like what they saw from Hackenberg, he would be in play for them in the second round and possibly even at 31.

- Other Pro Day notes:

Klein Kubiak, son of Head Coach Gary Kubiak and a scout for the Broncos was present at the Baylor Pro Day.

Some of the prospects they could have been taking a look at are defensive tackle Andrew Billings, wide receiver Corey Coleman, defensive end Shawn Oakman, and guard Spencer Drango.

Rutgers linebacker Quentin Gausemet met with the Broncos after his Pro Day.

Broncos scouts were present at the Missouri Pro Day. Some of prospects they could have been taking a look at are inside linebacker Kentrell Brothers, guard Connor McGovern, and center Evan Boehm.

Broncos scouts attended South Dakota State's Pro Day. While there they met with Drew Iddings, a 6'5"", 290lb defensive end prospect.
Broncos also attended the Texas State Pro Day. 

Broncos were among the teams to attended the Montana Pro Day as well.

The Broncos reportedly talking to second-round cornerback prospect Kendall Fuller at the Virginia Tech as well.

Broncos attended the Louisiana Tech Pro Day and watched a pair of prospects who figure to be top 50 picks. Those players being defensive tackle Vernon Butler, and running back Kenneth Dixon.

All 32 NFL teams(Obviously including the Broncos) were represented at the Florida Pro Day. Some prospects the Broncos were watchings are cornerback Vernon Hargreaves, defensive end Jonathan Bullard, running back Kelvin Taylor(Fred Taylor's son), receiver Demarcus Robinson, safety Keanu Neal, tight end Jake McGee, and linebackers Antonio Morrison and Alex McCalister.

1915,"- One prospect who the Denver Broncos are reportedly are really high on and could select in the first round is former Alabama defensive lineman Jarran Reed. He is a 6'3"", 307lb defensive lineman who is considered one of the top defensive lineman in a draft that is deep in that position. Reed is ranked the 19th overall prospect in the 2016 NFL Draft, according to CBS Sports, and is ranked as the 3rd best defensive tackle in the draft.

- During his two-year career at Alabama, Reed totaled 111 tackles, 11 tackles for a loss, 2 sacks, and 7 pass deflections. This past season Reed totaled 57 tackles, 4.5 tackles for a loss, 1 sack, and 2 pass deflections. The SEC media named Reed to the second-team All-SEC team in 2015. He was disruptive force no matter where he lined up along the defensive line.

Bench Press: N/A Vertical Jump: 31.0 inches

Broad Jump: 104.0 inches 3 Cone Drill:7.77 seconds

20 Yard Shuttle: 4.75 seconds

- Scouting Report

Strengths:

Anchored Alabama's defensive line and was disruptive in the tough SEC

Strong and has a well-built frame

Moves surprisingly well for a man of his size

Doesn't get lost in the trenches and has a nose for the ball

Good and violent tackler

Sets the edge well

Can play in either scheme(4-3 or 3-4)

Reads the running backs eyes and clogs the running lanes

Productive despite only playing 55% of the snaps at Alabama

Tough to move and is your classic run stopper

- Weaknesses:

Not a pass rusher and probably is not a three-down player in the NFL

Limited pass rushing moves

Not explosive off the snap

- Does Jarran Reed fit with the Broncos?

He does, but he is not Malik Jackson.

My first scouting report of 2016 is Jarran Reed because the Broncos reportedly ""love"" the guy, and I can see why.

Here is what Walter Football's Charlie Campbell reported back earlier this offseason.

""Denver's plan is to address the defensive line in the first round. They love Alabama's Jarran Reed, but he also is very unlikely to make it to pick 31. Still, the 2016 draft is loaded at the defensive line, so there should be some good options available to the Broncos. Even though Denver's first-round pick could go to fortifying its tremendous defense, the changes at quarterback will get all the attention this offseason.""

As Campbell says, Reed is likely at top 20 pick, so it's unlikely that he will fall all the way to 31. However, the Broncos have 10 draft pick(possibly more if they trade Clady, plus another 3 or 4 compensatory picks coming next year) and can use their extra draft picks to trade up during April's NFL Draft.

Now how would Reed fit with the Broncos? I think he could line up at all three defensive line spots. He is run stopping machine, and pairing him with Derek Wolfe and Sylvester Williams will make it very hard for teams to run on this Broncos defense.

On obvious passing situations, he may need to be subbed out, but it will be interesting to see if defensive line coach Bill Kollar could improve his pass rushing skills.

If the Broncos want to add a country strong, run-stuffing defensive lineman, and are willing to trade up for him, Jarran Reed is your guy.

1916,"- One prospect who could interest the Broncos in the first round of the 2016 NFL Draft is former Louisiana Tech defensive lineman Vernon Butler. He is a 6'4"", 323lb defensive lineman who is considered one of the top defensive lineman in the entire draft. 

- During Butler's four-year career at Louisana Tech, he totaled 168 tackles, 28.5 tackles for a loss, 3 pass deflections, and 1 forced fumble. This past season he totaled 50 tackles, 10 tackles for a loss, 3 sacks, and 3 pass deflections. The conference USA coaches voted Butler to the first-team All-Conference USA team for his 2015 season.

- Height: 6'4"" Weight: 323lbs 40 time:5.33 seconds

Arm Length: 35 1/8"" Hands: 10 3/4""

Bench Press: 26 reps Vertical Jump: 33 1/2""

Broad Jump: 104.0 inches 3 Cone Drill:7.82 seconds

20 Yard Shuttle: 4.76 seconds

- Scouting Report

Strengths:

Big guy but carries his weight well for a man of his size

Has great short area quickness

Long arms and is a ""knee bender""

Strong hands

Can take on double teams allowing linebackers to make plays

High motor and doesn't quit

Can stuff the run and rush the passer

Great pursuit skills

Great tackler

Smooth on his feet

Great athleticism for a man of his size


- Weaknesses:

Pad level gets too high sometimes

Needs to develop a few more pass rush skills 

Allows blockers to get to his body

- Does Vernon Butler fit with the Broncos?

Perfect fit, and a personal favorite of mine.

He has long arms, very athletic, can rush the pass, and stuff the run? Plug him in day one and the Broncos have their replacement for Malik Jackson. Add in the fact that he is a high-motor guy who never quits and I'm sold.

This seems like the type of prospect I can see defensive line coach Bill Kollar banging the table for in the first round. Kollar is one of the better and more respected defensive line coaches in the game(and he wrestled a bear...) and has helped turn J.J. Watt, Malik Jackson, and Derek Wolfe into the players they are today.

This draft is incredibly deep at the interior defensive line position and I see the Broncos adding another defensive prospect in the first round. If that guy is Vernon Butler, I will be one happy man that Thursday night.

1967,"Key Points from article:

- The visit with Okung is also an indication pay cut negotiations between the Broncos and left tackle Ryan Clady have snagged. Clady is scheduled to make $9.5 million this season but the Broncos want him back at less than $5 million.

- If the Broncos sign Okung, he would immediately become their starting left tackle opposite recently signed right tackle Donald Stephenson.

- Michael Schofield, who including playoffs started 16 games for the Broncos at right tackle last season, would become a backup swing tackle. Then again neither Okung nor Stephenson have started 16 games in a season so Schofield could still get his share of starts.

- The Broncos would then move second-year tackle Ty Sambrailo to an offensive guard spot opposite Max Garcia. Sambrailo would also give the Broncos the game-day flexibility to play either tackle position.

- Interior offensive line depth would come from James Ferentz, Sam Brenner and Dillon Day. With the return of starting center Matt Paradis, the Broncos’ retooled offensive line would be better equipped to execute head coach Gary Kubiak’s zone-blocking system.",2016-03-16 18:11:56+00:00,d128p7m,1.0,t3_4ap1gs,66,DenverBroncos

2045,"Key points from article:

- Marshall, a starting inside linebacker, received a second-round tender that comes with a $2.553 million salary that will essentially take him off the market.

- The Broncos, though, took a greater gamble with Anderson by offering their starting running back the lowest level, “right of first refusal” tender that will pay him a $1.671 million salary.

- ""Two years ago when we lost the Super Bowl, 43-8, I told my mom  I  wasn't good enough to get on the field  and it was up to me to work hard enough to get on the field,"" Anderson said.  ""The last two years, I gave the Broncos everything I had and it still wasn't enough to  get a high tender. It's  on me to get better.'' 

- The Broncos thinking with the low tender to Anderson is a running back is not a position that would draw an outsized contract they can’t match.

- As a general rule, teams consider a second-round pick too rich for a defensive player at a non-pass rush or cover corner position. There are exceptions to every rule, though, and Marshall is considered a three-down, inside linebacker whose 215 tackles the past two years led the team.

- ""I'm glad the  Broncos showed confidence in me by wanting me back,"" Marshall said. ""I'm  appreciative of their confidence in me.'' ",2016-03-08 04:26:47+00:00,d0roz70,1.0,t3_49gqe3,15,DenverBroncos

2047,"Key points from article:

- Denver wants Brock Osweiler to return and has offered him a three-year deal worth about $39 million. It's not known what guaranteed money the team offered.

- ""I hope Brock is back,"" receiver Emmanuel Sanders said. ""I don't want him to go anywhere.""

- The Houston Texans have shown interest in Osweiler. Coach Bill O'Brien received a firsthand look at Osweiler during scrimmages at Dove Valley in summer 2014 and in the Broncos' second preseason game at Houston last season.

- The Broncos have not heard much from Osweiler's side since their contract offer. General manager John Elway hinted at last month's NFL combine that Osweiler knew then of the Broncos' parameters. 

- Defensive end Malik Jackson received interest from multiple teams Tuesday, most notably Jacksonville, Oakland and Chicago. Denver has not given up keeping Jackson, but its offer of about $11 million per season might not be enough.

- ""I enjoyed Brock being my teammate,"" Von Miller said. ""He's broccoli. Broccoli, the master. I would love to have both those guys ( Jackson and Osweiler) back.

2225,"For those who don't want to open the link:

LT Ryan Clady- The Broncos offensive line had a rough season in 2015. Things got off to a bad start for the unit when left tackle Ryan Clady was knocked out for the season with an ACL injury he suffered in minicamp. The loss of Clady caused a domino effect that was felt across the entire offensive line. If healthy, Clady makes for a near-perfect fit in the zone-blocking system. Arguably, there aren't 32 quality starting left tackles in the league, but Clady could at least be in the top 20 if the Broncos keep him around in 2016. There’s a good chance that Clady won’t play this season at that salary—a number that represents 6.4 percent of the team’s payroll. However, instead of cutting Clady, the Broncos could ask him to restructure his deal and take a pay cut. After the good faith they’ve shown in Clady through his injuries—three major injuries in the last five years—we might see the veteran lineman take less money to stay with the Broncos.

2016 Cap Hit: $10.1 million

Dead Money: $1.2 million

Likelihood of Release: Medium

Likelihood of Restructure: Very High

P Britton Colquitt- For the price they’re paying, the Broncos may not want to bring punter Britton Colquitt back. In 2015, Colquitt ranked among the lowest in the league in the following categories: Yards Per Punt 43.61 (30th), Punt Inside the 20 Rate 27.4 percent (33rd), Punt Inside the 10 Rate 7.1 percent (30th). In terms of average annual salary, Colquitt is the highest paid punter in the league. Simply put, the results are not good enough for him to be at that spot, and the team may move on. Special teams—especially the punting game—is critical for a team that is built on defense. Pinning opponents deep in their own territory can pay incredible dividends on the defensive side of the ball—but it takes a punter capable of doing that. Colquitt has underperformed for two years in a row, and that’s something the Broncos may not overlook when considering players to cut this offseason.

2016 Cap Hit: $4 million

Dead Money: $750,000

Likelihood of Release: High

Likelihood of Restructure: High


RG Louis Vazquez- An All-Pro right guard when healthy, Louis Vasquez looked like an odd fit in the zone-blocking system the Broncos implemented last year. While Vasquez is a powerful player who can control his man at the point of attack, he’s not capable of executing the combo blocks necessary in the Broncos offense. The zone-blocking system asks the linemen to move laterally at the snap and in complete and total synchronicity. The linemen are also often tasked with being “sticky blockers” on linebackers at the second level of the defense. Vasquez can dominate in a phone booth due to his brute strength, but he struggles to latch onto a moving target. The fit in this offense just doesn’t seem to be right with Vasquez. He’s a talented player, but the team might decide it’s best to move on with a different interior lineman. With Ty Sambrailo likely back at right tackle, we may see Michael Schofield moved inside to guard—in a spot that may be Vasquez’s old stomping grounds.

2016 Cap Hit: $6.75 million

Dead Money: $1.25 million

Likelihood of Release: Medium/High

Likelihood of Restructure: High


LB DeMarcus Ware- The Broncos won the Super Bowl thanks to a world-class defense. There’s a ton of praise that can be heaped on the pass-rushers like veteran DeMarcus Ware. However, Ware’s body seemed to break down this season, and he only appeared in 11 games. Due to the missed time, Ware’s numbers on the season were down and he only registered 7.5 sacks in the regular season. When the playoffs came around, Ware looked refreshed after missing so much time and registered 3.5 sacks in three postseason contests. The Broncos may want to limit Ware’s snaps in 2016 in order to maximize his potential. There’s so much that Ware does for this team in his mentoring role for Von Miller, the Broncos are unlikely to show the future Hall of Famer the door. However, Ware’s body seems to be breaking down, and a part-time role as a pass-rusher seems to be the best use of his current skill set. The Broncos could ask Ware to take a pay cut in order for him to stay with the team, and Ware would likely accept at this point in his career.

2016 Cap Hit: $11.6 million

Dead Money: $1.6 million

Likelihood of Release: Low

Likelihood of Restructure: High

CB Aqib Talib- When the Broncos signed cornerback Aqib Talib two years ago, there was some concern about his hotheadedness on the field. Talib plays with great passion and energy, but sometimes those assets can be detrimental when things transpire after the play is over. No stranger to personal foul penalties, Talib almost came off the tracks in Super Bowl 50 against the Carolina Panthers. Covering Corey Brown caused Talib frustration, and that frustration came through with a violent facemask penalty that Talib later admitted he did on purpose via an interview in USA Today. There’s no word from the league office yet, but that admission may land him on the suspended list to begin the 2016 season. Perhaps the Broncos have had enough of the veteran corner to let him loose. The NFL has turned into a three-corner league. With so many teams utilizing pass-happy offenses, the trend of playing nickel defense as a base formation is likely here to stay. Yes, Bradley Roby could be a stud starter on the outside someday, but the Broncos still need him as their third corner behind Talib and Chris Harris Jr. The language of the NFL is money, and the Broncos will likely say “stay” to Talib in 2016.

2016 Cap Hit: $9.9 million

Dead Money: $3 million

Likelihood of Release: Low

Likelihood of Restructure: Low

2259,"1. Harris will most likely be on Edelman inside or outside, but Harris may not play every snap due to his shoulder injury. Talib will most likely be lined up against LaFell on the outside, and Roby will mix in outside and the slot against Amendola or Edelman. Gronk is an animal. A mix of Ward and Stewart will cover him along with a coverage linebacker (Trevathan and Marshall). As for defensive play-calling, I expect a healthy amount of blitzes to pressure Brady and force throws. Our biggest weakness on defense has definitely been stupid penalties. 

2. Our TE Owen Daniels and Virgil Green pop up here and there for some nice plays but neither have been huge threats. Vernon Davis barely sees the field now, but expect 3-TE sets to neutralize the Pats. Our 3/4 receivers have been ok. Norwood and Fowler make nice plays here and there but have not been largely productive. Don't sleep on either though. 

3. Our X-Factor's are Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson. Pressure up the middle is huge to fuck Brady up so they will be key along with the obvious Miller and Ware duo.

4. We will win if we hit brady and stop the short crossing routes and we don't turn the ball over.

5. We lose if Manning turns the ball over and the Pats have long drives. ",2016-01-21 21:05:43+00:00,cz6ypky,1.0,t3_421yim,970,DenverBroncos

Coming into the season there were high hopes that a healthy Manning might come back, armed with strong receivers and buoyed by a great defense, to lead the Broncos to greatness this season. But he threw interceptions in every game this season, including four in the loss to the Kansas City Chiefs that resulted in the most nightmarish Manning stat line ever: 5 of 20 passing, 35 yards, zero TDs, four picks, a fumble and two sacks before being yanked for Brock Osweiler.

2393,"That is definitely my hardest pick. As things stand now, the AL Central is probably the toughest division in baseball to figure out. They do have problems, largely being a thin outfield and iffy rotation and bullpen depth. What i do know, however, is that Corey Kluber, Danny Salazar and Carlos Carrasco make for an awesome rotation trio. We also know that the Indians are returning all of the key members from a much-improved defense. The big question is how much Cleveland is going to hit. But if Francisco Lindor and Jason Kipnis can once again be excellent offensive middle infielders and Michael Brantley can make a strong return from shoulder surgery, they should hit enough to support their excellent run prevention. Also last year's Royals weren't missing Alex Gordon and waving goodbye to Johnny Cueto and Ben Zobrist. Also, two straight trips to the World Series make one wonder when fatigue will set in. Nobody else in the division looks like a sure thing. The Detroit Tigers have bolstered their pitching staff but still look old. The Minnesota Twins made a good upside play by signing Byung-ho Park, but last year's 83 wins come off as a fluke. The Chicago White Sox did well to add Todd Frazier, but their roster still looks terribly top-heavy.
