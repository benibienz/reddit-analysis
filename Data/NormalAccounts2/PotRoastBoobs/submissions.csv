**Gary Kubiak**

- Kubiak: Biggest thing this week is ""evaluation"" ... ""evaluate really hard what we've done up to this point"" ... ""gotta freshen some guys up""

- Kubiak on plans during bye: ""We're in evaluation mode big-time.""

- Broncos will use the bye week for evaluation and working with young guys. They want to look at options on OL, rest &amp; get healthy.

- Kubiak: Siemian is ""beat up ... he took a lot of shots"" ... ""some of them he's gotta take responsibility for.""

- Kubiak is pleased that they ran 80-plus plays...""But we need to be more consistent"" on OL.

- Kubiak says he's concerned about the consistency of the offensive line, may mean he plays 6 or 7 O-linemen in a game.

- Kubiak: Siemian makes a lot of plays ""because he'll sit in there"" and take a hit ... says ""sometimes his depth is bad in the shotgun.""

- Kubiak says Trevor is getting too deep on some drops and having some trouble working from shotgun. He said they've been working with Trevor Siemian on his depth in the pocket, shotgun snaps and drifting from the line.

- Kubiak: ""Ty deserves to get on the field more. Donald has to play better, and all of us need to get more consistent"" 

- Kubiak: Connor McGovern's progress ""has been good"" ... team is trying to work him as both a center and a guard in practice. Also said Billy Turner will get a look.

- Kubiak: ""To be 10 weeks into it with some of the changes we've had ... we're right there. And we're in a great division this year.""

- Kubiak: Demaryius Thomas ""played really well, played really hard... capable of taking the team on his shoulders."" Also said yesterday was DT's best game of the season.

- Kubiak doesn't think Siemian will have to stay during the bye for treatment ... said he got another shoulder injection in the last 23 hours.

- Kubiak, on Siemian: ""He's got to get better ... want to see him become more consistent,"" like ""a lot of guys.""

- Kubiak, on Siemian: ""He's got to continue to play big. Not okay. He's got to play big.""

- Kubiak repeats: ""I want Trevor to play big,"" not merely ""okay.""

- Kubiak reiterates his faith in Siemian (despite continuous calls for Lynch): ""I got big expectations for (Siemian) and he knows that.""

- Kubiak: ""Talib worked out today, Wolfe will be held back until next week."" Still confident in their return after the bye week.

- Kubiak on Jordan Taylor: ""Our team has a lot of confidence in him, but he's earned it""

- Kubiak said he believes DeMarcus Ware will be able to play 50 plays a game after the bye.

- Kubiak isn't frustrated with OL and running game, but says, ""I'm driven ... driven to find a way to get it more consistent.""

- Kubiak on OLine &amp; Run Game: ""I've seen us do good stuff at times...then I've watched us struggle...gotta coach it better...""

- Kubiak: ""Players of the week are Darian Stewart, Demaryius Thomas and Justin Simmons.""

- The Broncos only suited two running backs yesterday. Kubiak joked that he would have been the third, ""I would have gone out there""

The news (of probably not needing surgery) is encouraging."" There was a concern his elbow injury was similar to Fowler/Sambrailo but luckily it wasn't. 

- Kubiak: ""We've got to find some consistency ... we ran 50 plays, averaged 6 yards per play ... but there's no consistency.""

- Kubiak: ""We've just got to find a way to stay on the damn football field."" Further concern comes from fact that first quarter &amp; third quarter are most scripted.

- Kubiak: ""Our field position was very very poor, we didn't execute our plan on special teams""

- Kubiak: ""I feel really good about what Trevor's doing, but Trevor's like any other player -- he's got to get better. I have to do better for Trevor.""

- Kubiak said he's not considering going to Paxton Lynch. Feels good about Trevor Siemian.

- Kubiak on if he'd consider playing Paxton: ""No. I feel really good about what Trevor is doing. We are all looking to be more consistent.""

- Kubiak: ""There is a lot of football left to play. I believe in what we're doing, I believe in our people ... just need to keep battling ... &amp; get better at what we're doing.""

- Kubiak on the offense: ""I think we've got the guys...it's been good enough six times and not good enough three times"" 

- Kubiak, on throwing a lot early: ""It's gotten out of whack .... those things get evened out when you stay on the football field.""

- Kubiak: ""You are not going to win in this league if you can't stop the run and you can't run the ball.""

- Kubiak: ""Winning the physical battle week in and week out has to be important ... it's something that has to improve.""

- Kubiak, on the play-calling: ""Me and Rick and Knapper work together ... it's between all of us ... I may call 90% one time, 70% another""

- Kubiak to Les Shapiro when asked about taking his headset off: ""You're wrong. You're not right."" 

- Kubiak, on drops: ""Trevor makes two nice plays ... for some reason, some of those things have been happening early.""

- Kubiak, on run blocking up front -- both physical and a matter of execution. ""It's not one guy, one person, one group.""

- Kubiak: ""The run defense is concerning. The last two weeks we've given up almost 400 yards. We didn't tackle real well last night.""

- Kubiak: ""We had the game cut down to a one-possession game a couple of times, and they went down the field on us.""

- Kubiak's message to the team today following the loss to the Raiders: ""I told them I believe in them and we need to keep working. We lost to a good team. We have to own that.""

- Kubiak is not in a good mood. Clearly unhappy.

- Kubiak, on Talib: ""He is doing better. He is in there feeling good ... he'll be day-to-day this week.""

- Kubiak: ""I liked Kapri's agressiveness. He's out there trying to make plays.""

- Kubiak: ""We're gaining confidence in Kapri. Booker's not doing anything wrong, we need to find more room""

- Kubiak, on Bibbs taking it out of end zone: ""I like Kapri's aggressiveness...obviously there's a plan in place...trying to execute that plan""

- Kubiak: Latimer and Fowler are battling for one spot on the game-day active roster.

- Kubiak: ""Cody and Bennie are kind of battling for that receiver spot.""

- Kubiak said Kapri Bibbs has earned more opportunities to touch the football.

- Kubiak on Carr: ""he's throwing more than anyone and turning it over less. That's what this league is about"" 

- Kubiak asked if he still hates the Raiders: ""Hate is a strong word.""

- Siemian: ""I wasn't seeing things right...just a little too inconsistent from where I want to be"" 

- Siemian: ""You certainly have to be aware of where Mack is. We'll have our hands full.""

- Siemian: ""I still don't know what a holding call is. There could be a holding on every play. I'm not gonna tell guys to stop holding.""

- Siemian on penalties: ""I still don't know what a holding call is. ... Truthfully I'd rather they hold than me get hit.""

- Ward: ""I feel like they have two good receivers. I don't feel they have two elite receivers."" (On Crabtree and Cooper.) ""We have 3 elite cornerbacks. We will be fine.""

- New Broncos TE A.J. Derby will wear No. 83. [He is practicing today.] (https://imgur.com/MJSpCP1)

- Pass rusher DeMarcus Ware is practicing today, at least in individual drills. First practice since suffering broken forearm vs Colts week 2. 

- No C.J. Anderson today as he is getting a second opinion on his knee.

- Matt Paradis and James Ferentz are not at practice. Aqib Talib here, but not in a jersey.

- Brandon Marshall (hamstring) is out here, but doesn't appear to be doing much in drills. 

- Hat day today. Light practice. No pads or helmets.

**Quotes**

**John Elway**

- Broncos GM John Elway to Denver Sports 760 on MNF win: ""We got our edge back.""

**Gary Kubiak**

- Kubiak: ""DeMarcus Ware was a limited participant today.""

- Kubiak said Anderson is out of town getting second opinion. Hope to know more by tomorrow afternoon. He played through and and was our offensive MVP.

- Kubiak: ""Matt Paradis has a sore hip. He'll get some rest days.""

- Kubiak on DeMarcus playing this week: ""I think we have a shot at getting DeMarcus this week. I liked what I saw from him today.""

- Kubiak: ""I know a lot about AJ Derby. We think he has a chance to help us very quickly.""

- Kubiak: ""Derby is not a project. I think he can help us very quickly. Very smart kid. We need some versatility.""

- Kubiak: ""We've had some issues at TE, those guys are hard to come by. The Patriots had a couple very good ones.""

- Plan with Derby is to use him in passing game &amp; possibly even at fullback. Janovich was limited and had cast on his hand.

- CJ may not play Sunday (knee). If not, Kubiak says Booker would get bulk of carries with Bibbs ready to roll. 

- Kubiak points to Virgil Green and Jeff Heuerman's health as the reason for acquiring A.J. Derby. They believe he has tremendous upside

- Kubiak said he'd have to watch TE A.J. Derby's progress the next two days, but said he'd be ""very comfortable"" playing him Sunday.

**Trevor Siemian**

- Siemian: ""We have a good feel for San Diego.""

- Siemian: ""Shoulder feels better now than the last time we played them. Getting better every day.""

- Siemian: ""Bosa is physical. Great with his hands, great technique.""

- Siemian: ""Book is a stud. He's been running really well.""

- Siemian: ""Book fumbled his first carry and I was bummed for him. But we knew he had some juice going all the way back to camp. He's got juice.""

- Siemian: ""I'm a Cubs fan. I just like watching good baseball.""

**DeMarcus Ware**

- Ware: ""The San Diego Chargers broke into my house but they're the real victims this week.""

- Ware: ""It doesn't feel like home anymore when somebody breaks into your house.""

- Ware on his return: ""It's a day-to-day process. Don't know if I'm going to play this week or if i'm going to play next week. But if it progresses like it should, I'll be out there.""

- Ware says him trying to lead without playing is like us trying to write quotes without a recorder.

- Ware: ""Im bigger than I was last year now. I'm like 250, I feel like a beast.""

- Ware said strength will be issue. Every time hits somebody will feel pain. Said muscles need to get acclimated.

- Ware says his arm doesn't feel 100% but thinks it's about building up muscle. Says his body feels great, like a beast

- Ware: ""Losing my Super Bowl ring is a really big thing... but it's just a call away. I can order a new ring.""

- Ware: ""I'm glad I wasn't in there when the robbers were. I woulda sacked em.""

- Ware: ""When you mess with one of Broncos Country's own, thy have your back. I feel safe. The 12th man has my back on and off the field.""

**Brandon Marshall**

- Marshall said the best test for his hamstring will be Friday and will depend on if he can make all the hard cuts.

**Chris Harris Jr.**

- Harris Jr. on DeMarcus Ware being back: ""D-Ware brings a fear factor to O-lines.""",DenverBroncos,Denver Broncos Wednesday Practice Notes,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/59j0c1/denver_broncos_wednesday_practice_notes/

- Kubiak said DeMarcus Ware should practice this week and that Dekoda Watson is fine.

- Kubiak: ""I think we played a complete football game last night.""

- Kubiak said ""the consistency of what took place last night is something to build on.""

- Kubiak on eight holding calls in five quarters: ""We have to address ourselves but I think (there are a lot of holding calls) throughout the league right now.""

- Kubiak: ""We kind of challenged our team (last week).""

- Kubiak continues to stress that the Broncos need to continue to play relatively mistake free football

- Kubiak: ""Matt Paradis is a leader. A really fine player. He's still relatively young but he's a guy everybody looks to.""

- Kubiak said playing San Diego twice in three weeks should help the Broncos out in terms of preparation

- Kubiak on Corey Nelson: ""thought he did a good job last night ... we trust Corey"" if needed for Marshall missing time.

- Kubiak, on opting to let the clock run out at the end of the first half: ""I have my reasons ... my fault ... we should be aggressive.""

- Kubiak: ""Nothing to explain. I made a decision. I had my reasons. We should stay aggressive, if you want to blame somebody blame me. I agree with you guys, we should be aggressive there.""

- Kubiak, on Janovich: ""We want to get this kid involved ... He had a lot to do with how we played last night.""

- Kubiak said Houston brought the safeties into the box after Broncos' early run success; that set up some one-on-ones downfield later.

- As of right now, Gary Kubiak said Broncos are trying to gather more information on the matter of DeMarcus Ware's house being robbed.

- Interesting to hear Kubiak doesn't watch TV copies of games. Lots of coaches do to pick up verbiage and checks that TV mics pick up.

[Broncos Injury Report update] (http://m.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-injuryreport/Broncos-Injury-Report-Brandon-Marshall-day-to-day-DeMarcus-Ware-to-practice-this-week/0ec01f25-ff78-4470-830f-d57d258fc12e):

- Inside linebacker Brandon Marshall is be ""day-to-day"" after suffering a hamstring strain against the Houston Texans on Monday night, Head Coach Gary Kubiak said at his day-after-game press conference Tuesday afternoon. 

- If Marshall cannot play, Corey Nelson is expected to fill in for him. Nelson entered in the second half, and was responsible for relaying the calls in the huddle, as he wore the green-stickered helmet with the radio receiver. ""Corey's done a good job,"" Kubiak said. ""He's always played some in our sub packages. Obviously he played more last night.""

- Nelson, who played a season-high 18 defensive snaps against the Texans, competed with Todd Davis for one starting inside linebacker spot in the offseason and preseason, with Davis eventually winning the job. ""Corey's kind of like Todd in a lot of ways,"" Kubiak said. ""Corey's a guy who's being working hard, waiting for an opportunity, and I thought he did a really good job with it last night, and may be called upon again. ""We trust Corey. He's a fine young player.""

- Outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware is expected to return to the practice field this week. Ware has not practiced since suffering a fractured forearm in Week 2 against the Colts.

- Wide receiver Cody Latimer passed the league-mandated post-concussion protocol before Monday night's game, but the team opted to deactivate him even though he was available. With Latimer inactive, the Broncos played with five wide receivers and three tight ends for the first time this season.

- Outslde linebacker Dekoda Watson is ""fine,"" Kubiak said. Watson had left Monday's game to be evaluated for a possible concussion.

- Defensive end Derek Wolfe played on despite suffering a dislocated finger in the third quarter. Wolfe said he suffered the injury when his hand collided with Jared Crick's helmet, while also dealing with a cramp in his calf muscle at the time. He was treated on the field and returned later that series. ""When I went down on the field, I went to jump over Crick, and my calf just locked up on me,"" Wolfe said. ""And then I dislocated my finger on his helmet, so I was like, 'Yeah, I'm just going to lay here a minute, and let this calf calm down, and pop my finger back in,' and then I was good.""",DenverBroncos,Gary Kubiak comments from press conference today,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/59cvif/gary_kubiak_comments_from_press_conference_today/

- Russell Okung (concussion) is wearing a helmet and participating in drills

- Cody Latimer (concussion) is participating in drills with no helmet

- Trevor Siemian (shoulder) looks good flinging the ball around today

**Quotes**

**Gary Kubiak**

- Kubiak said Russell Okung took the majority of reps in practice and is ""on track"" to play Monday.

- Kubiak said DeMarcus Ware and Cody Latimer did not practice today. Latimer participated in some drills but did not fully practice.

- Kubiak: ""We have changed things up in practice this week. We needed a good, long football practice today.""

- Kubiak: ""DeMarcus is doing really well. Our plan was to have him see the field this week. Maybe Sunday.""

- Kubiak spoke very highly of the late Houston broadcaster, Bob Allen. He said he met him when he was 16.

**Rick Dennison**

- Dennison: ""We have to make plays on first down. We've gone downhill on the last couple weeks.""

- Dennison: ""When Booker touches the ball he has some explosion. He's getting better in protection. You play well and get more touches.""

- Dennison on the running game: ""Everybody's got to do better...got to give better effort"" 

**Joe DeCamillis**

- Joe D warns that the Houston Texans special teams is very good, lead by rookie returner Will Fuller

- DeCamillis: ""I'm glad to be anonymous again. No one is more glad that Kubiak is back than me.""

- DeCamillis points to Will Parks to step up on special teams if Cody Latimer can't play this week.

**Von Miller**

- Von: ""Playing Brock is just a little bit of added sauce.""

- Von: ""I've been watching Monday night football ever since I was a little tadpole...I'm excited""

-  Von: ""Shane is developing so fast that I don't even know what's next. I knew he would get there, I just didn't know it would be this fast.""

**Wade Phillips**

- Wade: ""If you're wondering about my outfit, I'm going hunting right after this."" [Picture] (https://imgur.com/WkZ1LKJ)

- Wade: ""You put your offense and your team in a bad position when you get behind early. You'd rather not give up your points early.""

- Wade Phillips says if you look at the stats, this years D is better than last years through 6 games. This year they've given up 18 points per game, last year 18.5.

- Wade: ""Brock was part of us being the first seed last year. He was a big part of that. He looked outstanding at the end of last week.""

- Wade on Brock: ""the last two games, the last two drives he's look outstanding. Reminds me of the New England comeback last year with him""

- Wade was asked about how Gruden thinks they should play more zone: ""Jon Gruden hasn't coached in a while, has he?""

- Wade said defense is doing good things. ""But we are 4-2 not 6-0. We have to get better. Not good to put our offense behind"" 

- As Wade walks off the podium his parting words ""I'm going hunting for a victory or maybe coverage in the middle"".",DenverBroncos,Denver Broncos Friday Practice Notes,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/58orjp/denver_broncos_friday_practice_notes/

- Broncos announced they cut Darrion Weems to make room for Billy Turner.

- Billy Winn not out at practice today either. 

- DeMarcus Ware absent from practice too. He said last week there was no guarantee he's available this week, might need more time.

- Matt Paradis is not practicing today

**Quotes**

**Gary Kubiak**

- Kubiak: ""I feel very good...all my tests came back great."" 

- Kubiak on his week of recovery: ""I feel really good. I got too much rest."" He said it was tough to watch, he's glad to be back.

- Kubiak: ""I'm very comfortable with the place I'm in and where we are going. I feel very good.""

- Kubiak said to him it was different than the mini-stroke in Houston. The biggest thing for him is improving his sleep. Tests were normal.

- Kubiak: ""It made me really appreciate what I'm doing. As a football coach, taking two days was like having a summer off.""

- Kubiak: ""It just really makes you appreciate what you're doing. Makes you appreciate the players, coaches, even you guys (media).""

- Kubiak: ""We don't want to play from behind. We have to start faster.""

- Kubiak: ""We acquired Billy Turner. We had some high grades on him.""

- Kubiak: ""Okung and Cody are in the protocol. They both tested very well today.""

- Kubiak: ""We got to get back on track here and stay away from negative football plays.""

- Kubiak said Emmanuel Sanders (hip) practiced but is sore.

- Kubiak: ""You could tell Trevor wasn't quite himself in the game but he came out of the game fine and looked better today.""

- Kubiak said what bothered him about loss was that both games looked same ""we ran 5 plays and we were down 10-0"".

- Kubiak: ""We are resting Matt Paradis today but he's fine."" Same with Billy Winn.

- Kubiak: ""Booker has done really well with his chances. He deserves more opportunities with the football.""

- Kubiak not down on CJ Anderson, just thinks that Booker has earned more of an opportunity

- Kubiak: ""Joe D really busted his butt. He deserved that opportunity.""

- ""Preparation, detail, and effort,"" Kubiak's message to team back to work this afternoon. Have long week before Monday night vs Houston

- Kubiak said he wasn't feeling well Saturday evening and Sunday before Falcons game. Thought he had the flu initially.

- Kubiak: ""The family is okay with me being out here. They wanted to get me out of the house.""

- Kubiak said he appreciated all those that reached out. Joked he found out a lot of people liked him who he thought didn't like him.

- The last thing Kubiak wanted to do today was make a scene about his return. [Wanted business as usual] (http://www.9news.com/mb/sports/nfl/denver-broncos/mike-klis/business-as-usual-as-kubiak-returns/337074269) &amp; it was just that.

**Brandon Marshall**

- Marshall said no ill will towards Brock. Happy got paid. ""But it's competition. We want to kill him.""

- Marshall, smiling: ""It’s Brock. We know Brock. He came from here. And we want to kill him. That’s just what we want to do.”

- Marshall: ""We know Brock (Osweiler) likes to hold the ball so I really feel like we can get a lot of good pressure on him.""

- Marshall: ""Just watching their offense, I think this will be a great week for us.""

**Chris Harris Jr.**

- Harris on Brock: ""It is what it is, he left us, it is what it is. We know he wants to win, we know we want to beat him bad.""",DenverBroncos,Denver Broncos Monday practice notes,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/57zq44/denver_broncos_monday_practice_notes/

- DeCamillis: ""San Diego made some plays at the start of the game. They got some matchups and then the matchups went away.""

- DeCamillis said he's already watched the film, ""every phase"" of it. Trying to find out what causes the slow starts.

- DeCamillis says the team has discussed no longer deferring if they win the coin toss. ""But I'm still gonna put my money on our defense.""

- DeCamillis, on the O-line: ""It's a combination of everything,"" said SD's D-line deserves credit, was disruptive, caused problems.

- DeCamillis on the offensive line issues: ""we didn't execute the way we needed to"".

- DeCamillis: ""I thought Trevor handled things well. We have to help him more, to be honest with you. I thought he did a good job. Got ourselves in position. I'm pleased with his efforts"".

- Eight of the Broncos’ 12 penalties were called on offensive linemen, with all five starters getting called for at least one infraction. The penalties resulted in 63 yards in losses and all but one occurred in the second half. The most costly penalties were two fourth-quarter holding penalties on left tackle Russell Okung (one in the end zone which resulted in a safety and another which nullified a C.J. Anderson touchdown reception).

- C.J. Anderson totaled 71 yards on 14 touches on the night but had 47 yards and a TD nullified by three penalties.

- The Broncos now have been flagged 29 times for 248 yards over the last three games after being whistled only 17 times for 117 yards in the first three games.

- The Chargers marched 75 yards on 12 plays to score a TD on the game’s opening drive. That marked the fifth time in six games this season that Denver’s opposition has scored on its opening possession – totaling a league-most 31 points. It was San Diego’s only TD of the night.

- The Broncos’ opening drive resulted in a punt for third time in their last four games. They only have scored on their opening possession once – a TD following an interception in Tampa – in six games. That Aqib Talib pick against the Buccaneers, not coincidentally, was the only time the opposition has failed to turn its opening drive into points.

- Trevor Siemian completed 30-of-50 passes for 230 yards and a TD in the game, but according to Pro Football Focus, Siemian only completed 1-of-8 throws for 20 yards on passes which traveled more than 10 yards in the air.

- Tight ends Hunter Henry (a game-high 83 yards on six receptions) and Antonio Gates (16 on two) combined for 99 of the Chargers’ 178 receiving yards, leaving 79 on 10 receptions for the other five players who caught passes for San Diego.

- San Diego QB Philip Rivers finished 18-of-29 for 178 yards and a TD in the game, but he didn’t throw an interception and was sacked only twice. In the previous four games against the Broncos – all Denver wins – Rivers threw six interceptions and was sacked nine times.

- In the end, the Broncos’ NFL-record 15-game division road win streak was snapped by a Chargers crew which was in the midst of its worst AFC West skid (10 straight losses) in more than 30 years.

- Bonus stat: Trevor Siemian had 50 pass attempts in 26:32 last night. Philip Rivers had 29 in 33:28.

Takeaway: Damn what a shitty night

- John Elway said Kubiak is headed home from the hospital now.

- Elway: Kubiak's prognosis is ""very, very good."" Will take this week off. Will return next Monday.

- Elway: ""With Kubiak not coaching this week, Joe DeCamillis will be the interim coach.""

- Elway: Making DeCamillis the interim coach was the ""least disruptive."" Elway says DeCamillis has worked closely in game management with Kubiak

- Elway says Joe's work with analytics director Mitch Tanney helped make the decision easier.

- Elway: ""Joe has been involved with Gary on the game-management side of things. That was a big thing.""

- Elway: ""We're excited about Gary's future...I'm not going to comment on Gary's health""

- Elway ""Our playcalling is always collaborative, so it's going to stay that way"" 

- Elway said offensive coordinator Rick Dennison will be the lead play-caller on offense for the Broncos.

- Elway: ""Rick Dennison will call plays. All the offensive coaches will have input. It has been collaborative up to this point.""

- Elway: ""The process for Gary is to worry about Gary this week."" Kubiak has appointments scheduled with doctors this week.

- Elway: ""When we left the hospital last night, we were very encouraged.""

- Elway: ""When we left the hospital Gary's family was very relieved with what they heard.""

- Elway: ""Everybody on the staff could have taken it (interim job), that's how good we feel about our staff.""

- Elway: ""feel it will be a seamless transition with Joe stepping in.""

- Elway: Kubiak was ""very tired,"" but is in good spirits. Said he had a good night of sleep last night. Headed home now. ""Things are good.""

- Elway: ""We didn't give Gary a chance to say he could or couldn't coach. The doctors said Gary needs to concentrate on Gary this week.""

- Elway: ""With Wade on the defensive side, and Rico on the offensive side I didn’t want to put anything more on their plate” 

- Elway said the decision to have an interim coach this week wasn't affected by Thursday night's game, because doctors firmly said Kubiak needed a week.

- Elway: ""I was more concerned as a friend."" He said he talked w/ Kubiak before the game, and the coach ""wasn't feeling well.""

- Elway: ""Scary going in, but very excited coming out as far as the prognosis,"" as well as Kubiak's future as a coach in wake of the diagnosis

- Elway: ""Sometimes these situations are bad, but something really good comes out of it.""

- Elway: ""It's almost better that it's a short week."" 

- Elway: ""I think it will be a seamless transition.""

**Joe DeCamillis**

- DeCamillis: ""We've got a great staff, and Kubes set a template for us."" Said it's ""seamless"" because Kubiak is not a micromanager.

- DeCamillis: ""I haven't had time to think about (the quick turnaround), to be honest.""

- DeCamillis: ""People say, 'Well, special teams is the only thing you do,' but not really, because you have to watch offense &amp; defense the whole time""

- DeCamillis: “The first message is we are worried, and happy for Kubes health. The second thing is we have to have a short memory and quick turnaround""

- DeCamillis: San Diego ""could easily be 4-1 ... we've got to strap up our boots and be ready to roll, quick.""

- Interim HC Joe DeCamillis on his response to Elway: ""Yes, sir.""

- DeCamillis: ""You want to do what you can to help your team win ... [Elway] has trusted me with something that's so important.""

- DeCamillis, whose father-in-law is Dan Reeves, expects that he'll give him ""some unsolicited advice.""",DenverBroncos,John Elway press conference comments from today,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/56u17p/john_elway_press_conference_comments_from_today/

- Trevor Siemian observing but not participating in QB drills

- Kayvon Webster not practicing today. Expected back tomorrow.

**Quotes**

**Gary Kubiak**

- Kubiak: ""DeMarcus, Trevor and Kayvon did not practice.""

- Kubiak says Trevor is feeling better, but didn't do anything today. 

- Kubiak: ""The plan was to hold Trevor back today. The other guy needed all those reps, Trevor didn't need those reps.""

- Kubiak on Talib: ""Nothing has changed. I have not heard anything from anybody. Aqib is having a great year and I expect that to continue.""

- Kubiak: ""Paxton is much improved as far as handling himself and handling the huddle. He's more confident in his ability.""

- Kubiak: ""I'd take the QB decision all the way to game day (if he had to)."" All about Trevor's health.

- Kubiak: ""Virgil was limited. Donald maybe even did a little bit more than Virgil. Both made steps forward today.""

- Kubiak on Siemian: ""We don't ever want to put anyone out there who can't do their job.""

**C.J. Anderson**

- CJ: ""We're confident with any quarterback back there. Offense didn't change at all last week.""

- CJ: ""I think Donald is important to the offense. It's always good to have him out there.""

- CJ: ""We've just gotta be more physical than we have been."" 

- CJ: ""You can tell in preparation that he (Lynch) understands the offense better.""

- CJ: ""We are confident in Paxton""

- CJ on if Paxton's mobility open things up more: ""No. Trev did things with his feet, it's not like Paxton is Michael Vick.""

- CJ on team using 4 QBs during 9 game win streak. QBs have played well and ""helps to have great defense."" ",DenverBroncos,Denver Broncos Wednesday Practice Notes,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/560tmd/denver_broncos_wednesday_practice_notes/

Hopefully he's going to be OK... We feel fortunate with Trevor. We'll be day-to-day here""

- Kubiak said Trevor Siemian has a sprained left shoulder.

- Kubiak: ""He's just really, really sore going through that throwing motion."" Throwing the ball isn't a problem, but it's how he feel when he moves his body, etc.

- Kubiak said it's a combination of pain management and mechanics of throwing motion. He's really sore, but a relief it isn't his throwing arm

- Kubiak, on Siemian and Lynch: ""Obviously they're both good players ... We're going to need them both. It's just the nature of the business these days.""

- Kubiak said they feel comfortable suiting 2 guys at QB. He doesn't think he will suit more than two guys Sunday.

- Kubiak said Siemian could have avoided a couple of sacks by getting rid of the ball, but felt he did well overall.

- Kubiak wouldn't say who would have been 3rd string QB yesterday. Said they have a couple of options; didn't want to give them away.

- Kubiak: Lynch ""bailed us out a couple of times (by) throwing the ball away"" ... Was impressed by his play Sunday.

- Kubiak: ""Paxton got into a rhythm. Ran two-minute drill well."" 

- Kubiak ""I told [Paxton] to go have some fun and play, and that's what he did."" 

- Kubiak: ""We really struggled with the running game in the first half. That's a young QBs best friend.""

- Kubiak: ""We needed to get where we were moving the ball better on the ground.""

- Kubiak said Stephenson &amp; Green are ""both very close."" DeMarcus Ware ""starts working out today,"" will be evaluated at the end of the week.

- Kubiak says the defense could still do some things better, citing third downs &amp; YPC vs. the run. Said the D ""took some strides"" Sunday.

- Kubiak comparing this defense to last season: ""We're getting our hands on the ball a lot right now.""

- Kubiak, on the O-line: ""We can always do better."" Says that Okung and Paradis are ""playing at a high level.""

- Kubiak: ""Ty is coming along. He hasn't played a lot of football and now he's been forced to play a lot quickly. Still looking for more consistensy.""

- Kubiak: ""We're going to approach every week trying to get our best players on the field and Trevor is our starter.""

- Kubiak: Siemian playing without a lot of practice is ""not a problem for him, because he's very bright.""

- Kubiak: ""Trevor is our starter, and we're going to give him every opportunity to get there Sunday.""

- Kubiak: ""Derek Wolfe had a great offseason. He's in really, really good shape. His ability to stay on the field is really panning out.""

- Kubiak: Derek Wolfe has ""been exceptional"" ... Was one of the defensive players of the game Sunday.

- Kubiak, on Lynch throwing 24 times: ""You have to show confidence in him ... His strength is throwing the ball down the field.""

- Kubiak said Lynch's worst play was his first one Sunday.

- Kubiak: ""Lynch has been practicing well. Going against our defense is making him better."" 

- Kubiak praised the performance of Paxton Lynch. ""I don't think it was too big for him.""

- Kubiak: ATL OC Kyle Shanahan is ""exceptional ... As sharp a guy as I've ever worked (with)."" Shanahan worked under him in Houston.

- Kubiak said Derek Wolfe and Aqib Talib, Russell Okung and Demaryius Thomas, and Dekoda Watson were Broncos players of the game.

- Kubiak: ""I didn't think it made any sense at that point"" to send Siemian back out there after the injury. Didn't want to make it worse.

- Kubiak reiterated that Trevor could have gone back in, but felt comfortable with that Paxton was doing. ",DenverBroncos,Gary Kubiak comments from press conference today,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/55paa2/gary_kubiak_comments_from_press_conference_today/

- OT Donald Stephenson (calf) and TE Virgil Green (calf) not practicing but with a trainer to the side.

- S Shiloh Keo (knee) is back practicing today

- Drake's ""Big Rings"" blasting on the loudspeaker at Broncos practice as Emmanuel Sanders sings along. Safe to say it's the squads favorite song.

- Broncos receivers still practicing with wet balls today, causing some drops in warm-up drills. Needless to say, they aren't real big fans.

**Quotes**

**Gary Kubiak**

- Kubiak: ""Donald and Virgil DNP. 
Simmons, Keo, TJ were limited.""

- Kubiak: Virgil Green is making ""very good progress"". Says he is making a comeback very quick. ""We are getting close""

- Kubiak: ""Virgil and Donald could play without practicing. No problem.""

- Kubiak says Broncos hoping to suit 7 offensive linemen again.

- Kubiak on Von Miller: ""Von loves to play. Obviously, Von took care of his business (when he missed the summer). Only concern was him coming in a little light.""

- Kubiak: ""I know we can block better. I know we can run better too.""

- Kubiak: ""(Bucs have) Two biggest receivers we'll play.""

**Rick Dennison**

- Rick Dennison praises Schofield for his versatility, intelligence and versatility. Says he's one of the most versatile players he's ever had

- Dennison: ""Trevor is always taking steps. The coverage dictates where the ball goes and he was less fooled this week.""

- Dennison said they missed some creases in running game. Expects improvement this week.

**Joe DeCamillis**

- DeCamillis: ""To be honest, I'm happy to see more kickoffs getting returned.""

- DeCamillis: ""Dixon had his best game last week. The returner we play this week is darn good.""

- Both Gary Kubiak and Joe DeCamillis praised Bucs Adam Humphries.

- DeCamillis said Dixon had best week on hang time and directional kicks to sideline to pin returner. 

- DeCamillis on if he has to play psychologist: ""A lot of people have called me a lot of things, psychologist is not one of them.""

**Emmanuel Sanders**

- Sanders gets up and immediately complains about being asked the same questions 

- Emmanuel Sanders doesn't treat going up against a rookie corner lightly. Says he treats them all like a Richard Sherman.

- Sanders: ""Demaryius and I are both selfless. We are genuinely happy for each other when the other is having success.""

- Sanders on him and DT: ""We genuinely want to be the best and we genuinely want to win..it's not always about statistics"" 

- Sanders: ""This offense can be dangerous.""

- Sanders: ""I don't mind being a diva. I am a diva. I like catching passes.""

- Sanders: ""Demaryius is a country diva. I'm a Hollywood diva.""

- Sanders: ""Today was one of Trevor's best practices I've seen. He's gettin better and better.""

- Sanders: ""Maybe Trevor is watching SportsCenter and seeing his name and seeing his jersey sales go up and that's alright. Builds confidence.""

- Sanders: ""I think a lot of emphasis is on Trevor (Siemian's) arm, but a lot of people don't study his feet.""

- Sanders on Trevor Siemian: ""I'm excited to have the opportunity to play 13 more games with him""

- Sanders said Siemian's long TD pass to him was best pass Siemian has thrown to him. Chemistry keeps improving.

- Sanders much more complimentary of Kubiak's play-calling this week

**Demaryius Thomas**

- DT on being a ""Country Diva"": ""I'm from the country, I drive a Ford Raptor. I don't see anything wrong with that (laughs)""

- DT on the post-TD celebration that knocked over Emmanuel Sanders: ""I can't help that he weighs a buck 70.""

**Brandon Marshall**

- Brandon Marshall says another great game and he might add Trevor Siemian to his fantasy team. Has good QBs already though (Luck/Brees).

- Brandon Marshall said he needs to play better. Said the Broncos run defense has ""been disappointing"", they expect more.

**Von Miller**

- Von: ""There is no pressure like the pressure we put on each other in this locker room.""

- Von: ""Just trying to be the best Von Miller I can be."" 

- Von: ""We hold everyone to a high standard and that's why we have success.""

- Von: ""There's something special going on with this team right now. The locker room is the core.""

- What makes team special? Von said ""our attitude. It's all football. It's different here. 100 percent football. We're all in.""

- Von Miller credits Denver's success to a mentality of""always football"" saying that the players are always focused and talking about football

- Von: ""It's not the same without DeMarcus Ware in the locker room. He's DeMarcus Ware. He HAS to come to meetings.""

**Wade Phillips**

- His father would have been 93 today. ""Obviously I think about him every day. ... He had 90 good years. I got my love of the game from him.""

- Phillips: ""Von is a lot better at this point last year than he was last year... The offseason might be overrated a little bit.""

- Phillips said ""I don't coach out of fear. I don't see a grown man fearing a coach. They know I have their best interests at heart""

- Phillips: ""If you take the QB scrambles out of it and our yards per carry isn't that high. The QBs had almost 50 yards each.""

- Wade Phillips says that the run defense has been hurt by playing mobile quarterbacks. Says they've done fairly well holding running backs.

- Phillips: ""Shane had a big game. He did the things that we thought he could do.""",DenverBroncos,Denver Broncos Thursday practice notes,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/553lqu/denver_broncos_thursday_practice_notes/

- Von Miller on C.J. Anderson: ""C.J. is running like Tecmo Bowl.""

**DeMarcus Ware**

- DeMarcus making it known that he doesn't like to be called ""old."" Says ""vet"" or ""mature"" is okay. 

- Ware on being so low on his sack: ""I dropped it like it was hot.""

- Demaryius Thomas said the hip issue is one he's been dealing with for a while. Hurt it again with 2nd catch vs Panthers. Day to day.

- Demaryius Thomas said hip injury similar to 2012. He played all 16 games that season. 

**Wade Phillips**

- Phillips on claims that Broncos D is dirty: ""I think it's ridiculous.""

- Phillips: ""We don't want penalties. No one wants penalties. It can cost you a game. ... We teach against those things.""

- Wade Phillips said they are frustrated by penalties. They keep the Panthers, teams on the field, but ""We're moving on. We know how we play.""

- Phillips: ""Demarcus looked good. We played him the right amount of time. Our plan was to keep him fresh.""

- Phillips: ""The Panthers longest pass in the game was 18 yards.""

- Phillips: ""Todd Davis had 17 tackles. Whoever kept stats was way off, they gave him six or something.""

- Todd Davis, Broncos Def. MVP last week, really impressed Phillips. Said he is intense leading up to games and ""it showed.""",DenverBroncos,Gary Kubiak comments about practice today,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/52y1kx/gary_kubiak_comments_about_practice_today/

Really good players all around the field. Obviously, they're a winning group. They know how to win. Well coached. I think coach Phillips does a heck of a job everywhere he's been. Certainly great pass rushers, really good cover guys. Really, there's no weakness on the defense.""

- Luck: ""Obviously, there's been really one or a couple personal changes on the interior d-line and at linebacker, so a little different players. But, schematically it looks quite similar. There's obviously some wrinkles. So, you go into a game and you have to assume you're going to see something you might not have seen before, but somewhat similar.""

- Luck: ""Yeah, we moved the ball decently, converted some third downs, and managed to score in the red-zone. We obviously know that this is a totally different year. What's happened in the past has absolutely zero bearing on this game.""

- Luck on Broncos defense being described as ""dirty."": ""I wouldn't necessarily agree with that. I think they play hard. Obviously, everyone's entitled to their own opinion. They do a good job, they really do.""

- Pagano on Broncos defense: ""They've got talent from front to back. The edge pressure that you get, the way that they run to the football, the linebackers are sideline to sideline and the secondary is as good a unit as there is in the NFL. It's very, very difficult to generate movement inside and try to get something going in the run game. They do a great job there. They've got great edge setters in Ware and Von, then Shaq comes in and Ray comes in. They're deep. They've got a ton of talent and they're extremely well-coached. They're disciplined and they fly around. They're a physical, physical unit.""

- Pagano on Broncos Siemian: ""I saw a young man that looks like he's been playing for a long time. He's mature beyond his years. He's a perfect fit, is what I thought, for coach Kubes' system.""

- Pagano: ""guys are aware of (Denver's) defense. It's up to us to protect (our QB). But it's a physical game.""

I only included quotes where they were discussing the Broncos. Pagano talked some about Michigan, targeting rules, and Luck's health. Luck talked more about his contract, what he is doing to stay healthy, the anthem protests, and his wide receivers.  TY Hilton did say this is a ""must win"" game though.",DenverBroncos,Andrew Luck and Chuck Pagano comments from conference call this morning,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/52r8hq/andrew_luck_and_chuck_pagano_comments_from/

[Wade Phillips is a cool dude] (https://imgur.com/MpYIq6X)

- TE Jeff Heuerman is not practicing again today. He's been battling a hammy injury. Kubiak said they did expect him to play Thursday

- Wade Phillips still wearing his orange ""It's Time"" t-shirt.

- Devontae Booker is now wearing No. 23 

- No Bennie Fowler at practice. Not expected to play. Made great progress with elbow but not ready yet.

- Ty Sambrailo practicing for 2nd straight day. 

- Ty Sambrailo practicing at both tackle and guard at practice today. Not a surprise as Kubiak said ""Ty will have to play everywhere"" 

- DeMarcus Ware was a full participant at practice today. He's ready for the season opener

**Quotes**

- Kubiak says Sambrailo and Ferentz were limited today.

- Kubiak: ""We drill ourselves to talk about what's going on right now. Not last year.""

- Kubiak: ""They have so many weapons. Benjamin is really hard to deal with, that's a new challenge.""

- Kubiak: ""We'll sit down and set a play count for DeMarcus.""

- Kubiak: ""Carolina's front seven is the best I've coached against""

- Dennison on Schofield: ""Michael's just been really consistent.""

- Dennison: ""It's not just Trevor playing. It's the entire Broncos.""

- Dennison: ""Keeping Max Garcia in one spot has really helped him. We moved him around a lot last year.""

- Dennison: ""Having a fullback opens up a little bit more of our playbook.""

- Dennison: ""Trevor has been good at the line. We're not asking him to do as much as 18 did but he's got us into some good plays.""

- Joe D: ""We were asking Dixon to do different types of kicks in the last game.""

- DeCamillis has the utmost confidence in Cody Latimer returning kicks on Thursday night 
- Joe D says Dixon's performance in the Rams' game won him the job. His confidence isn't shaken by performance in fourth preseason game.

- Joe D: ""I didn't see a problem on the hold from Dixon on the missed field goal.""

- Joe D: ""So proud of Kayvon. There were questions about him this time last year. He answered all of those questions.""

- Ware: ""I'm healthy, I'm ready and I'll do whatever Coach Kubiak will let me do.""

- Ware: ""Cam is 1 of 1. He is a BIG dude but he's fast and quick and he makes throws.""

- Ware says he sacks anything that wears a jersey, whether that's Cam Newton or a reporter 

- Ware: ""Malik was a great player but we have 11 guys out there. We have guys stepping up.""

- Ware: ""I told Shane today 'I will accept nothing less than greatness from you'""

- Kayvon: ""It's an honor and a privilege to be a captain.""

- Kayvon admitted he was a little surprised to be a team captain. 

- Sanders: ""Every system that I've played in, year two or three is when you start to get confident.""

- Sanders: ""I don't take anybody lightly. The young corners are sometimes the hungriest.""

- Sanders: ""I'm gonna treat the rookie corners like they're Revis and Sherman.""

- Sanders: ""Gonna go out and try to ball and make as many plays as I can.""

- Sanders: ""Trevor is a competitor. I only like to play with competitors.""

- Sanders says it's been nice to know Trevor will be the starter and has helped with chemistry.

- Sanders says he ""really doesn't know"" how long the contract issues will linger. 

- Von: ""I'm sure they'll come up with some ways to block up. I'll see my fair share of chips.""

- Von: ""Cam is in a league of his own. Super Cam.""

- Von: ""I know Cam but it's not like I text him and ask him to get lunch. Mutual respect.""

- Von: ""It's more natural for me to be a leader now. The rookies have a different view of who I am. They have an expectation of me.""

- Von said Cam is one of the hardest quarterbacks in the NFL to sack. Also mentioned Wilson and Big Ben.

- Von: ""It's a different type of Von, a different focus than I had last year. My role has changed""

- Phillips: ""They have a great player that played in Texas. I like Cam, he's my Texas connection.""

- Phillips: ""Benjamin is huge. He's as big as TEs.""

- Phillips: ""Demarcus is ready to go.""

- Phillips: ""Von seems to be better than he was at this time last year... He came back more focused than he was last year.""

- Phillips on Miller: ""I think his next step is to be Defensive Player of the Year.""

- Phillips: ""I think Shane has matured a lot. His attitude is great.""

- Phillips: ""As a rookie Gotsis is probably where we want him to be. Most of them don't start. He's playing better.""

- Phillips: ""Gotsis just needs to learn pro football rather than college football.""",DenverBroncos,Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos practice notes today,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/51apo2/super_bowl_champion_denver_broncos_practice_notes/

- Sanders ""Siemian is calm in the huddle, he's always the same guy."" 

- Sanders: ""His calm demeanor is impressive. I told him he reminds me of Aaron Rodgers in how he goes about his business.""

- Sanders: ""I remember seeing Siemian grow last year. I told Demaryius, ""This dude has an arm, he can make every throw.""

- Sanders on Siemian: ""He definitely understands the system, he knows what Kubiak expects and I think that we can win.""

- Sanders: ""Contract is still up in the air. We're waiting to see if we can find that number.""

- Sanders: ""I don't see why Siemian starting is a surprise. It shouldn't be a surprise. He can get the job done.""

- Emmanuel Sanders, on Broncos naming Trevor Siemian starter: ""I think they made a great decision.""

- Sanders: ""Paxton can play. It's good that he can sit back and grow. He's going to be a really good quarterback.""

- Sanders: ""Trevor is calm, cool and collected. He is who he is.""

- Sanders: ""I don't care who the quarterback is as long as he throws a catchable ball so I can get my rocks off. Trevor can make every throw.""

- Emmanuel Sanders on Broncos offense: ""We will be better.""

- Emanuel Sanders says Trevor Siemian hums Miley Cyrus in the huddle.... So there's that.

- Sanders: ""I'm like a kid in the backyard. I'm just going with it.""

- Ware: ""Siemian is a team player. We're behind him 100-percent.""

- Demarcus said he's 94% right now in advance of Sept 8 game against Panthers. 

- Ware is impressed by Siemians awareness in the pocket vs pass rush

- Ware: ""Trevor is one of those guys who always makes the right decisions.""

- DeMarucs Ware says it's about a QB's poise in the pocket, being able to string out the big plays. Trevor Siemian, he feels, can do that.

- Ware: ""I told someone recently that I couldn't coach because I'd just want to be out there playing.""

- DeMarcus Ware on race with Shane Ray: ""You know what, Shane actually cheated. Right at the end, he bumped me with his right arm.""

- Ware: ""As soon as we raced all the coaches texted me 'DeMarcus what are you doing?!' We definitely will NOT be racing again.""",DenverBroncos,Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos practice notes today,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/506fzy/super_bowl_champion_denver_broncos_practice_notes/

**Gary Kubiak**

- Kubiak ""Trevor will start the game this week.""

- All 3 QBs will play Saturday. Siemian will start vs. the Rams. His shoulder is ""a little bit sore.""

- Kubiak says Siemian's shoulder is sore, hoping he can practice tomorrow 

- Siemian suffered a sore shoulder when he was trying to tackle Eric Reid on the pick-six, Kubiak said.

- Kubiak: the 3 QBs have ""all made some mistakes"" but have ""all done some really good things.""

- Kubiak: ""All the quarterbacks have made mistakes but so have every player and coach out here.""

- Kubiak said the 3 QBs ""are all going to play an equal amount.""

- Kubiak said all 3 QBs will play an equal amount. Hasn't determined who will get the 2nd run at QB behind Siemian.

- Kubiak: Lynch ""finished extremely strong"" after a slow start.

- Kubiak, on the competition lingering so late into the preseason: ""I expected it.""

- Kubiak, on the quarterback decision. ""I knew this was going to take some time."" Said he's going to make a decision ""next week.""

- Kubiak: ""I knew this was going to take some time. I'm going to make a decision next week and we're going to go to work.""

- Kubiak: ""I think we have to be encouraged by the first group [on the offensive line].""

- Kubiak said he doesn't envision a scenario in which he'd have to play all 3 QBs in the preseason finale at Arizona.

- Kubiak says Trevor getting the start doesn't mean that he's in the lead. 

- Kubiak on Siemian: ""I think Trevor did a good job ... I'm going to give him a chance to do that again.""

- Kubiak: ""I think Trevor did a good job. If he had one play back it would have been as good as it could be.""

- Siemian's interception was ""just a poor decision,"" Kubiak said.

- Kubiak took the blame for a poor play call on Siemian's INT throwing into quarters defense on 2nd &amp; 15. That sounds like a coach protecting his guy.

- Kubiak says Paxton playing with the 1s depends on how much he's going to play the other starters.

- Kubiak: ""Mark is a competitive guy. I saw his comments, that is the type of guy you want out there battling.""

- Kubiak expects DeMarcus Ware to come off the NFI list today &amp; practice tomorrow.

- Kubiak said he expects Talib to play vs. the Rams on Saturday.

- Kubiak ""Corey Nelson has a sprained wrist, expectations are for him to be back.""

- Kubiak: ""Not sure if Heuerman will be available.""

- Kubiak says TE Jeff Heuerman is day-to-day

- Kubiak said he expects Nixon and Murphy to practice this week. Heuerman is ""day to day."" Doesn't know if he'll play vs. Rams.

- Kubiak: ""We're shooting for opening weekend with Sambrailo.""

- Broncos aiming for Ty Sambrailo to return for Week 1. ""I think we're getting close.""

- Kubiak was ""really excited"" about how Weems had played. Said that Connor McGovern ""played better"" vs. the 49ers.

- Kubiak on Virgil Green: ""Virgil has done a really good job."" Virgil ""just keeps plugging and making plays.""

- Kubiak: Sambrailo ""has the ability to come back and play real quick,"" but team is gaining confidence in Weems' play.

**T.J. Ward**

- Ward: First-team D is expecting to play ""quite a bit more"" than in the last two weeks.

- Ward: QB transition hasn't been difficult for the defense. ""The attention is off of us for the most part.""

- T.J. Ward says he's more convinced now the defense can be better than last year. Defense is ahead of where it was last year, he said.

- Ward: ""Any quarterback you want a guy that isn't going to turn the ball over but we also want a competitor who is a leader at the same time""

- Ward: ""I think Goff knows what he's up for if he even gets to see us.""

- T.J. Ward on Broncos D: ""The league knows. We don't have to say to much.""

**Virgil Green**

- Green: QB competition doesn't really affect him; he says he focuses on what he does -- blocking, running routes, etc.

- Virgil Green: ""All three of our quarterbacks have done great things, it doesn't effect my work.""

- Green: ""My finger is holding up, it's probably going to hurt for the rest of my life (laughs).""

- Virgil Green says that the ability to pass out of run formations helps him get open, helps the offense make more plays.

- Virgil Green"" ""I look at myself as a traditional Y tight end"" 

- Virgil Green, on Siemian: ""It seems like he's been here 4-5 years,"" praises his command in the huddle.

- Green (on opening drives): ""We do a great job talking about how we're going to attack guys before the game. We know what to look for.""

- Virgil Green reveals that C.J. Anderson is becoming a leader on the offense. Mentions Emmanuel Sanders too.

- Green: ""We've been through some things here, we've weathered a lot of storms. We dealt with the situation with Peyton and Brock. We know that things aren't always going to be perfect."" 

- Green: ""I'm getting open, catching the ball, the quarterbacks have faith in me. A coach once told me 'You can't be afraid to be great'""

- Green: ""Having a fullback is great. I love our fullbacks. It makes my life a lot easier."" Praised Andy Janovich. ",DenverBroncos,Quotes from Gary Kubiak's press conference today,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/4z29jd/quotes_from_gary_kubiaks_press_conference_today/

- The fields are ready for the Broncos to practice at 9:30 this morning. It is the last Saturday practice of training camp that will be open to the public. Including today there are five more practices open to the public. That includes Wednesday and Thursday when the Broncos and San Francisco 49ers will work together at the Broncos' Dove Valley complex.

- /u/dgapinski reports that kids are ""sucking"" during punt drills. Doesn't bode well for their chances at making the squad.

- Looks like just shells today. Players are heading to the weight room for warmups.

- Former Bachelor Ben Higgins in the house for Broncos Camp today. Crew for the ""Happily Ever After"" series are at Broncos camp to follow him around.

- The crowd was just chanting ""back-to-back"".

- Gary Kubiak makes his way out onto the field. Team will be out shortly.

- Broncos offensive players and defensive players have switched colors. Offense now in orange, defense in white. 

- Sanchez with the first reps with the ones in warmups.

- Talib leading off each exercise in position drills for the DBs. 

- Andy Janovich just left the field and headed into the facility. He wasn't limping or laboring in anyway. Had been stretching with a trainer and then walked off.

- Every day at camp, RB Devontae Booker gets extra time/coaching in pass protection - rookie's biggest question mark

- Mark Sanchez up first with the No. 1 offense for the first team period of practice.

- Andy Janovich, who ran back into the facility, isn't back out there now. Thompson taking first-team FB reps right now.

- After a great outing against the Bears, Jared Crick receiving first team reps on the defense today.

- The No-Fly Zone is back together: Talib joining Harris, Roby, Stewart and Ward in the secondary.

- Booker getting reps with the twos in team drills.

- Getting his first full-speed work in 7-on-7, Aqib Talib almost picked off Mark Sanchez on the first play for a pick-six. Pass was intended for Sanders.

- Sanchez follows up by rolling right and finding Sanders down field for a nice gain. 

- There should be no doubts about Von Miller. He just burned Russell Okung (a Pro Bowl caliber LT).

- Broncos starting secondary clamping down on 2nd team receivers. Siemian forced to hold ball and scramble. 

- Siemian connects on a bomb to DeVier Posey. Siemian to Posey for 40-yard gain on a great over the top catch on the fade route. He beat Kayvon Webster to make a nice catch down the left sideline.

- First deep connection of the day was from Siemian to Posey up the left sideline. Siemian went 2-of-4 in that 7-on-7 period.

- Talib continuing to make plays, just deflected another pass intended for Sanders. Talib all over Emmanuel on hitch and knocked it away.

- Sanchez then find Sanders for a competition in tight space along the sideline. 

- John Elway just walked onto the field to check out practice. 

- The No-Fly Zone continues to live up to the name as Siemian can’t find a receiver and has to throw it away. 

- Pretty raw overall for the QBs in that 7-on-7 period. Siemian 2-of-4. Sanchez 3-of-6, nearly INT'd by Talib. Lynch 0-of-3, near INT (Glover)

- Funny moment: Siemian tucked and ran during his 7 on 7 drill without any rush. 

- Like this special teams drill ... forcing Raymond &amp; Addison to field the football in the end zone with 2 men bearing down on them.

- Siemian leading the No. 1 offense in this period.

- Aqib Talib in second set of reps. Looks ready to go.

- Siemian does nothing in his attempt with the ones.

- Punter Riley Dixon practicing holding for field goals. McManus missed the field goal that Riley  was the holder for.

- Paxton Lynch is getting occasional first-team reps.

- Paxton Lynch had a snap with the ones, got his pass batted down by Crick and immediately got an earful from Kubiak. 

- Lynch got 3 snaps with the first team in the last period. Fumbled snap on 1st one, handoff to Booker, then a pass deflected at LOS by Crick.

- Rough team period for Lynch &amp; Siemian on the recent team drills. Rough day in general for the QBs.

- Paxton getting loudly ""coached up"" by Kubiak after ending the team drill.

- After blocking a punt on Thursday, the special teams emphasis was on blocking even more of them today.

- Over an hour into practice and Aqib Talib still participating.

- Nice strike from Siemian to Krieger-Coble in the back of the end zone for a 7-on-7 red-zone touchdown.

- Sanchez and Siemian both going against the first team D today. Good and fair way of comparison.

- Sanchez, looking for Sanders in the right side of the end zone, is picked off by Doss, who takes it 90+ yards all the way back for a pick-six.

- Sanchez picked by Lorenzo Doss. Talib chases after and yells: ""That's my son right there!""

- Offense has a huddle after that 7-on-7 period. Been a rough day for the unit so far.

- Sanchez was 0-for-6 in red zone drill with a pick-six to Doss on his final throw. Siemian was better, Lynch was OK.

- Many offensive players have been yelled at by coaches today, especially the quarterbacks. 

- Derek Wolfe with the red-zone deflection of a Siemian pass at the line of scrimmage.

- The rough day for the QBs continues. Siemian not good in his attempt at 11 vs 11.

- Paxton Lynch with a nice move to make a defender miss, then finds Ronnie Hillman who cuts up and into the end zone. 

- Lynch gets the offense in the end zone. Good read on his throw. Offense looked better with Lynch there.

- Very rough day for the QBs. Offense looked the best in the final drill with Lynch. As he's apt to do, he rebounded.

- Practice wrapping up about 40 minutes early.

- After the end of practice huddle, offense stays out and does more walk throughs, defense goes into the locker room.

- The entire offense taking reps after practice- something that they haven't done all of camp.

**Injury Report**

- Long list of Broncos not practicing today: WR Fowler, CB Nixon, S Murphy, OLs Myers &amp; Sambrailo, DLs Kilgo &amp; Walker, TEs Graham and Phillips. 

- WR Bennie Fowler III is not participating today. His right arm is in a sling. 

- TE John Phillips, still sidelined (ankle), is working with a strength-and-conditioning coach off to the side.

- Andy Janovich just left the field and headed into the facility. He wasn't limping or laboring in anyway. Had been stretching with a trainer and then walked off. 

- Bennie Fowler has a small fracture in his elbow. Will be out a few weeks. Hurt it covering a punt.

- Darius Kilgo has a shoulder injury. Should be back on Monday.

- Vance Walker is dealing with a back injury.

**Pictures**

- [Here are some pictures of practice today] (http://imgur.com/a/bzFO2)


**Quotes**

- Kubiak: ""Bennie Fowler has a small fracture in his elbow. He'll be out a couple weeks.""

- Kubiak: ""Kilgo hurt his shoulder. He should be back Monday.""

- Kubiak: ""I'm not happy with practice today."" Kubiak is flat out angry with the offense.

- Kubiak: ""We didn't practice well offensively. We handled the return on defense.""

- Kubiak: ""all three QBs looked good in the game, today was a rough practice""

- Kubiak: ""Aqib Talib is doing great, progressing well""

- Kubiak on what went into the decision to start Sanchez on Thursday: ""Just felt it was the best way to go.""

- Kubiak NOT happy after practice. Made offense get more work. Very short with the media.

- Gary Kubiak was, uh, displeased with Broncos practice today. The quote would be: ""(Various snapping),"" Kubiak snapped at reporters.

- Fowler said he won't have surgery. Injury outside the elbow. Shooting for last preseason game to return. Didn't realize it until next day. Hurt it on punt coverage. 

- Bennie Fowler said he fell awkwardly covering punt - finished 3rd quarter-- didn't  know anything wrong till X-Ray Friday morning.

- Cody Latimer: ""I was always nervous with Peyton. I didn't want to mess up."" Says he's more focused, confident this year.

Now I know it hasn't hampered our on-field success, but it still sucks. 

2012- The NFL suspended linebacker D.J. Williams, defensive tackle Ryan McBean and tight end Virgil Green of the Denver Broncos for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing substance. McBean and Williams were suspended for Denver's first six games of the 2012 season. Green was suspended for the team's first four games. All three are suspended without pay.

2012- Denver Broncos rookie practice squad member Quentin Saulsberry was suspended four games by the NFL for violating the league's performance-enhancing drug policy.

2012- LB Joe Mays suspended one game for his hit on QB Matt Schaub.

2013- The Denver Broncos suspended two executives who faced drunken driving charges. Director of player personnel Matt Russell was suspended indefinitely without pay Monday, and director of pro personnel Tom Heckert was suspended for a month without pay.

2013- Denver Broncos Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller unsuccessfully attempted to corrupt the NFL's drug-testing program with the help of a urine collector before each was caught in a matter that will affect how the NFL's collection testing procedures are done. This helps explain why Miller's four-game suspension for violating the NFL's substance-abuse policy suddenly and mysteriously was increased to six games and easily could have been up to a year.

2014- The NFL announced that Denver Broncos receiver Wes Welker will miss the first four games of the season after violating the league’s performance enhancing drugs policy.

2014- Denver Broncos kicker Matt Prater suspended for the first four games of the regular season for a violation of the NFL's substance-abuse program.

2015- The Broncos lost defensive end Derek Wolfe to a four-game suspension for a violation of the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.

2015- The Broncos announced that Ward was suspended for the first game of the 2015 regular season for violating the league's personal conduct policy.

2015- Aqib Talib suspended one game for poking Dwayne Allen in the eye.

2016- The NFL has suspended Broncos safety Shiloh Keo two games without pay for violating its substance-abuse policy.

2016- Aqib Talib could get suspended for multiple games for the shooting incident in Dallas.

- Aqib Talib in shoulder shell, helmet, jersey. Off to the weight room with the guys for warm up stretch. Team in shells today.

- Team is making their way on to the field to Nelly's, 2001 hit single ""#1"".

- Offense is wearing their white jerseys, defense is in orange. Temperature is currently at 73° in Dove Valley, CO, with no wind or clouds.

- Former 3B and current Texas Rangers bench coach Steve Buechele - John Elway's good friend at Stanford - visiting Broncos camp today

- Bibbs swapped out with Anderson in early phantom defense warm-up drills.

- Von Miller making Odell Beckham like catches on the sideline.

- Harsh NFL world: Kenny Anunike's No. 91 has already been reissued to Lars Koht. Now OL Sam Carlson is the only Bronco wearing No. 69.

- Taurean Nixon, who isn't even listed on the KR depth chart, getting the first look at KR today.

- Not a clear leader in the punt/kick returner race. All seem relatively even in kickoff drills.

- Darrion Weems is 1st team right guard again today with Max Garcia at left guard.

- Eddie Yarbrough seems to be the strongest in the OLB group, but as illustrated by Von Miller it's not all about strength.

- Siemian getting the first reps with the first team today

- Devontae Booker just blasted a big run (would have been a touchdown) during a live running back drill.

- Kapri Bibbs matches Booker on a left sweep.

- Aqib Talib getting work during 1 on 1s. Looked smooth, good with cuts and broke up a pass intended for Kalif Raymond. 

- Siemian looking wild with some throws early.

- Can see already in today's Broncos practice there is a concerted effort to keep the energy and pace up.

- Good seven-on-seven period for Mark Sanchez there; he went 4-for-4.

- Nice job by Siemian leading Fowler perfectly up the left sideline for a deep connection.

- Aqib Talib saw work in 1-on-1, but not in 7-on-7 so far.  Expect him to be brought back gradually.

- Siemian just looks off today. Sails another after holding it too long. 

- Gary Kubiak talking to Trevor Siemian after overthrowing his WR. Every pass is important now in the QB competition.

- Nice one-handed grab by Demaryius Thomas, just outside of Chris Harris Jr., in 7-on-7 red-zone work.

- Maybe Mark Sanchez's best pass of camp -- to DT in the back of the end zone, leading him perfectly, beating Webster by an eyelash.

- Mark Sanchez just had a great redzone series. Multiple TDs and sharp throws in tight coverage.

- Crowd went crazy for Sanchez TDs, was nearly silent for Paxton Lynch TDs. Not at all what I would have thought.

- Lynch had a near interception, that could have easily have been a touchdown. High pass to Mose Frazier.

- A much better day today after a day off, unlike last Wednesday.

- Co-starter Trevor Siemian begins the team portion leading the 1st team offense.

- Roby has pick-sixes off Sanchez in two consecutive practices. Sanchez's turnover problems continue. 

- Rough period for Lynch there. 0-for-3, under good pressure from the D.

- Lynch misses 3-straight throws. Kubiak says, ""Paxton you're paid to make plays. That's your job.""

- Kubiak said ""ones are back"" and Trevor Siemian ran on the field

- Siemian now leading the 1s. As the QBs continue to alternate, one thing is clear. The first team defense has been dominant today

- Vance Walker just destroyed a handoff to C.J. Anderson. Walker's excellent camp continues.

- Siemian found Jeff Heuerman on a pretty pass in team drills, he finds nice windows. Heuerman seems to be on the receiving end no matter who the QB is today.

- Paxton Lynch with a lot of overthrows so far today - everything high. 

- Nelson with the would-be sack on Sanchez. 

- Booker just went up to snag a nice catch that was high. His hands out of the backfield should prove extremely valuable.

- Sanchez with a pair of back to back money throws. Second one dropped. 

- Paxton out there now. Hillman putting moves on, Paxton sacked off play action.

- Siemian pass off boot action, sacked, pass to no one.

- Siemian boot, nothing there, safe throw away.

- Gotsis bats Siemian down at the line, Paxton Lynch on now.

- Trevor Siemian is looking more and more like Alex Smith minus the mobility. 

- Defense is having a great day today.

- Red zone drills for the last 15 minutes of practice.

- Not positive on what just happened inside the red zone Sanchez kneeled down with 2 seconds left. Defense went crazy.

- Goal line drill, no timeouts left, gotta stop clock or time runs out. Sanchez takes a knee. 

- Sanchez took a knee when he should have spiked it, and the defense celebrated like crazy.

- Practice is a wrap on a day where the Broncos defense dominated.

**Injury Report**

- Aqib Talib is practicing today 

- Aqib Talib not a full participant at practice today just like Von Miller wasn't the first week of camp. They will slowly work him back.

- Full padded practice today for the Broncos.

- Russell Okung is the first one out of the locker room followed by newly signed Mathu Gibson. Okung giving him some pointers before practice. Okung showing great leadership in camp so far.

- Sunshine getting some punt return reps today. 

- Karl Mecklenburg is out at camp again today. 

- Energetic and large crowd today. The practice on the Saturday before the preseason opener is often the liveliest.

- Weems getting look at RG for third straight day. Schofield at RT.

-  The Broncos offense was working on timing prior to the horn sounding for the next phase of camp. Now in specific positions.

- Von hits the sled, then dances.

- The DBs have been practicing with blinders on their eyes again. 

- Siemian running with the first team in 11 on 11, got Sly Williams to jump on snap count. 

- Mark Sanchez now in with the 2nd offense along with Ronnie Hillman in the backfield. 

- The competition with Bennie Fowler and Cody Latimer is really heating up. Fowler with a good catch from Sanchez.

- Finally, Paxton Lynch now taking reps with the 3rd team.

- Lynch's bootlegs are so smooth and effortless.

- Booker running really hard today.

- Beautiful work on the play-fake rollout by Siemian, finding Green just past Marshall to the right.

- Sylvester Williams generating some good pressure up the middle; he forced a Siemian overthrow.

- Sanchez with good work on the play-fake bootleg. Barrett didn't bite &amp; chased him; Sanchez lofted it over him, found Fowler in stride.

- Bennie Fowler is Mark Sanchez's favorite target for second straight day. Fowler showing great hands.

- Offense working at its 1-yard line now. This was the situation that set up Siemian's big pass to Fowler yesterday.

- Speaking of smooth, Booker just cut through the line like he was floating.

- Sanchez with first team now for 11-on-11.

- C.J. Anderson just broke away against first team defense.

- I like Max Garcia's work so far today. Nice block to spring C.J. Anderson on a sprint to the left in this period.

- Great job by Cameron Jefferson &amp; Jeff Heuerman to create a wide hole for Kapri Bibbs, setting up a big run to the left.

- Bibbs with a nice run. Thompson was his fullback, replaced Janovich with second team offense.

- Great catch by Garrett Graham. Lynch threw behind him, reached back with one hand to bring it in.

- All three offensive units got a first down out of 1st-and-10 at the offense's 1-yard line. Good composure, execution for the offense. 

- Billy Winn headed to the locker room.

- Sanchez with nice TD to Sanders in 7-on-7. Roby in coverage.

- Paxton separates himself from Sanchez and Siemian when it comes to 10+ yard ins and outs. The ball gets there so fast.

- Mayor Michael Hancock is out at practice today.

- Garrett Graham with a pair of nice catches from Paxton Lynch already. A one hander in team and a TD in 7 on 7.

- Marshall held his own step for step against DT, batting down Sanchez pass on crossing route.

- Lynch way more decisive on his decisons &amp; throws today.

- ""No Fly Zone"" getting it done. Going against Mark Sanchez and the No. 1 offense in 7-on-7, forces incompletions on 5 of 6 plays.

- Siemian much better on this set of three plays. Connects on all three passes, including one to Sunshine where he battled to the endzone.

- For all of camp Kenny Anunike has been working off to the side with a coach. Today, he's getting to at least be in defensive huddles.

- Siemian went 4-6 against second team in 7-on-7 with two touchdown passes.

- Lynch 2-4 against third team. Nearly picked once by Will Parks.

- Ward forced Green to fumble on a Sanchez pass, Ward picked it up and ran it back for a touchdown.

- Demaryius Thomas showing leadership after first team left the field. Went and gave high fives to everyone on the starting offense.

- Devontae Booker makes another nice cut and breaks away for a long TD run.

- Ball control an issue from the offense. Both Green &amp; Thompson with fumbles.

- Latimer and Raymond have both fumbled kick returns.

- Kalif Raymond misread the distance of the punt causing him to fumble

- Nixon draws praise from DeCamillis on special teams. Addison seems effortless with returning.

- Ronnie Hillman getting special teams work today.

- Janovich and Thompson have been rotating in and out on kick returns (as blockers). 

- Janovich getting work on the wedge blocking. Much better effort this time from Raymond. Returning really seems natural for Addison.

- Entire offense huddling at the beginning of this team period.

- Broncos 1st team offense now facing 1st team defense. Mark Sanchez getting the call for this drill. 

- Bradley Roby jumps in front of Emmanuel Sanders on a slant route for a pick-6 of Mark Sanchez.

- Sanchez looking to rebound, connected with DT but went incomplete on the next pass. Siemian and the 2s up now.

- DT made nice catch on Sanchez throw. Webster all over him, penalized for PI.

- If they were allowed to hit the QB, there would be at least half a dozen sacks so far in team.

- Meanwhile, Siemian lighting up the 2nd team defense with big completions to Latimer and Taylor. 

- Latimer beat Nixon badly. Siemian hit him for what likely would have been TD.

- Siemian shows good anticipation with first few throws. Latimer looking like his guy out there -- three targets, three completions. Very conservative though. Doesn't take chances. 

- Teams may need 7 OL on the field if they want any chance of bouncing a run outside of Von &amp; Shane Ray.

- Here comes Paxton Lynch with the 3s

- Lynch having the most success of the Broncos 3 QBs in the no huddle drill, driving the team down field. 

- Good team period for Paxton Lynch, who continues to show tremendous progress and the most raw talent of the three.

- Lynch has his confidence back. Can just tell by the way he throws. And he's not afraid to open it up &amp; test the field.

- Lynch put together a nice hurry up drive with completions to Frazier and Posey. Big arm. Works so much better moving fast

- Siemian first up in red zone drill.

- Nice pass from Siemian to Sanders on the end-zone post route for the TD from 25 yards out. Sanders kept running high-fiving all the fans in the front row.

- Sanchez 1-4 against first team D in move-the-ball drill. Had pick six, too. Siemian 4-5 against second team. Lynch 4-5 against third.

- Sanchez answers Siemian’s TD with one of his own, connecting with Cody Latimer in the same spot of the endzone.

- Not great play from the QBs today, but Trevor Siemian is having the best day. Precise accuracy with 2 TD passes to Emmanuel Sanders.

- Lynch hits Devontae Booker and he runs the corner to score a TD as all 3 Broncos units convert in the red zone. 

- Really good day out here for Trevor. Maybe his best day.

- Trevor Siemian killed it in the red zone today. Drove the No. 1 offense to 2 TDs. Great thread-the-needle pass to DT for 2nd score.

- Janovich at FB, Thompson at RB with what looks like third team offense.

- Lynch rolls out on a bootleg and hits Thompson for a TD in the end zone. 

- Booker with several big runs today. He has some serious skills. Fun to watch him run the ball.

- Play breaks down and Lynch uses his legs, and ran for a red zone TD with 3rd team.

- Lynch then found Raymond for a short TD pass. Looking good in the redzone. 

- Lynch was 2-for-2 on leading red-zone TD drives. Lovely pass to Raymond on the 2nd one for a 3rd-and-goal TD on a post route.

- Broncos offense and defense starting to scuffle. Derek Wolfe, James Ferentz, Kyle Roberts get into it.

- Matt Paradis down. Being treated on the field. Now standing up, walking back under his own power. Trainers talking to him now. Not looking at any body part so likely a head injury. 

- Sly Williams threw Paradis on ground, OL comes to his defense, small fight breaks out. ""Save it for Carolina!"" a fan yelled.

- Nice breakup by Taurean Nixon as Siemian tries to hit Latimer on a fade in the end zone.

- Siemian comes back and connects with Latimer on a dart for a TD. 

- Lynch tosses consecutive red zone TDs, one to the left and the other to the right.

- Going to be a light one today. Vet rest day and no shoulder pads.

- Broncos playing ""We Will Rock You"" by Queen as the crowd roars from the hill. 

- Broncos have waived OG Sam Brenner 

- Real nice opportunity today for younger DLs like Darius Kilgo, Kyle Peko &amp; Calvin Heurtelou with the entire starting DL getting a rest day.

- Schofield practicing at guard today.

- Darrion Weems getting some run at right guard. Schofield and McGovern received previous looks.

- Justin Simmons just TOOK the ball from Garrett Graham off a Mark Sanchez pass. Graham brought it in, and then Simmons snatched it away. Oh, my, what a play.

- John Elway watching from sideline as Sanchez, Siemian and Lynch switch in and out during 11-on-11.

- Trevor Siemian and Jordan Taylor seem to have their chemistry back, yesterday Sanchez and Taylor seemed to be off.

- In real game Siemian may have been sacked by Zaire Anderson. Instead he found Taylor over middle. Hit Taylor again on slant next play.

- Kubiak has stressed consistency for all positions and players during camp. Jordan Taylor has exemplified this in camp, hard to ignore.

- Devontae Booker found some holes on his way to the end zone on the Lynch led red zone drill. Lynch then tossed it out of bounds on the next.

- Trevor Siemian having a good practice so far. Could be a statement day for him. 

- Lynch does rollout best, even under pressure. He's scrambled or thrown ball away. Sanchez has looked skittish, forced ball or thrown in dirt. Sanchez not as smooth on rollouts. Lynch not afraid to move ball with legs. Siemian and Sanchez not so much.

- Offense goes 2-for-3 in red-zone drives. Sanchez and No. 1 offense stopped at the 12. Siemian-to-Graham &amp; Lynch-to-Frazier for TDs with 2s, 3s

- Paxton Lynch had a perfect fade away pass in the end zone to Mose Frazier. John Tidwell in coverage.

- Paxton Lynch the first person to celebrate with his wide receiver after throwing a TD. 

- Paxton Lynch has taken the least amount of touch sacks in camp so far. 

- Mark Sanchez gets to the red zone with an out to Bennie Fowler.

- Sanchez and the No. 1 offense gets another shot vs. No. 1 D, capitalizes. Nice job whistling it past Gotsis' hand to Norwood for the 4-yd TD

- CJ Anderson finishes off the drive with a trap run to the five-yard-line. Norwood caps off the drive with a touchdown catch.

- With Thomas and Sanders resting, Fowler has been Sanchez's favorite target today.

- On FGs of varying distances, McManus was 2-2 with Colquitt holding, 2-3 with Dixon holding. Good snaps from Kreiter.

- Bennie Fowler could not be better in replacement of Demaryius Thomas today. He's all hands.

- Max Garcia is seeing some first-team reps in this period. Good to see him back out there.

- Kyle Peko makes another play. Works inside Aaron Neary for what would have been a sack in a game.

- Mark Sanchez scrambles on a broken play to a wide open middle of the field, before sliding for the first down.

- Paxton Lynch right on target on crossing routes today

- Trevor Siemian had the deep ball early, then a nice thread-the-needle pass to Addison between double coverage just now. Nice day for Trevor.

- During third-down drills, Siemian was 4-4 passing, Sanchez was 2-3 passing (also ran for a first) and Lynch was 1-2 passing. Runs mixed in.

- Gotsis has been impressive today. He's getting his hands up quicker &amp; he's able to use lower-body strength to push blockers back.

- Siemian just scrambled and had the most awkward slide.

- It seems that the most likely scenario on a Siemian roll out is an incompletion.

- Not sure if C.J. just slipped or slid in the open field on a run play, but he popped right back up.

- Siemian completes about a 20-yard pass in a tight window to Jordan Norwood. Great throw. 

- Just a gorgeous pass for Siemian. Stepped up out of edge rush, hit Norwood for 25 yards, with the ball just sailing past Corey Nelson.

- Paxton Lynch running the two minute drill like a pro, 9 seconds left form the 36-yard line. Fumbles the snap. Field goal team on.

- Brandon McManus hits the East upright on a 58 yard attempt and then nails the next shot.

- Offense struggling in goal-line work. On one play, Anderson swept left into a thicket of orange (defensive) jerseys.

- Mark Sanchez executed a perfect fake handoff and found Jordan Taylor for a touchdown.

- Siemian found a wide open Jeff Heuerman in the back of the end zone on goal line drills.

- Practice is over

**Quotes**

- Kubiak said Thompson's ability to play fullback help his chances of making the team.

- Kubiak said he likes what he see from Weems at RG. Bigger for that position. Starting spot still open.

- Kubiak said he's not worried about depth in the long haul. He's been impressed with Darrion Weems at guard.

- Kenny Anunike says he's ""feeling great"" running and active on sideline during practice.

- Jordan Norwood jokes he's only watched his SB punt return once or twice. Then says more like 85 times.

- Emmanuel Sanders said he's more comfortable in second year of Kubiak offense 

- DT said he got the chance to speak to his grandmother, Minnie Pearl Thomas, about her commutation: ""She's good, she's excited.""

- The cutback lanes keep opening when Devontae Booker is on the field

- Sanchez connects with Taylor on a nice 20 yard out on a bootleg.

- Paxton Lynch has missed a couple open throws today.

- Lorenzo Doss getting reps as the third CB on the first team defense since Kayvon Webster isn't practicing

- Sanchez fired a strike to Taylor on a go-route, from shotgun, and Taylor dropped it. Taylor and Sanchez have strong chemistry, but Taylor has drop issues.

- Sanchez is looking sharp now. Just hit Thomas for a TD on a corner route in 7 on 7

- Paxton Lynch taking snaps with the first team on 7-on-7. Both of those reps were incompletions.

- Mark Sanchez and Trevor Siemian both strong showings early in practice on crossing routes 

- Britton Colquitt receiving the first team punting reps. Riley Dixon working with the second team. Colquitt looked better, at least today

- Don't count out Britton Colquitt in punter competition. He was booming it today.

- During the final team period (the most important) Sanchez and Siemian both looked very good. Lynch didn't do as well w/3rd team

- Paxton Lynch not having a great day. He's been all over the place with quite a few overthrows. And Lynch nearly just threw a pick to Lorenzo Doss.

- Third pass Sanchez has had batted at the line today. Jared Crick has batted 2 of the 3.

- 1st team offense (Sanchez leading them) vs second team defense...3-and-out

- Justin Simmons continues to impress. Quick into his break, fluid hips, great feet, glides in coverage. Should have near immediate impact. Also getting work as the personal protector for the first team punt unit. 

- Siemian puts a ball right on D.T. on a crossing route, but Harris Jr. finds a way to knock it away. That Madden rating is high for a reason.

- Wide receivers came to play today. A string of reaching grabs in a row from D.T., Norwood, Fowler and Addison.

- Cody Latimer has connected on a few deep passes today. Having his best day of camp so far.

- Siemian has been the best QB on the field today. Throws a beautiful post right into Posey's chest.

- Siemian &amp; the 2nd team off. is moving the ball vs 1st team defense. Big completion to Posey for 1st down after sack put them in 2nd and long

- Kubiak edgy today..Been stern with multiple players. Hillman sent off at one point for not hustling into drill.

- Siemian draws the third offside penalty of this drive with another hard count. Has played well during this period.

I will be updating training camp day 3 notes and observations here along with pictures and quotes from players/coaches after practice. 

**Notes and observations**

- First practice in pads

- Crowd gives a loud ovation to Lynch &amp; Siemian as they take the field for the third day.

- Sanchez starting with the first team today

- Von Miller getting M-V-P chant from fans again.

- Broncos open practice to The Temptations ""Ain't to Proud to Beg""

- Rod Smith is out watching camp today

- Mark Sanchez running with first team early in drills. Nice read on pass to CJ Anderson

- Von Miller and Russell Okung seeing team period reps today. Shane Ray lined up across from Von.

- Jordan Taylor almost had another diving catch on deep ball

- With Sylvester Williams and Phil Taylor out of practice, Vance Walker is stepping in at NT

- Adam Gotsis getting first live team reps with second unit today. Good sign for progress on knee injury.

- 1st team D-line today is Wolfe, Walker, Crick. 

- Siemian makes nice throw on run to Mose Frazier.

- Hillman keeps getting tackled in non-tackling drills

- Sunshine with another great catch, but he needed two hands. Slacker.

- Trevor Siemian's ball has been really impressive today. He's taken a lot of intermediate, deep shots today and has been on the money.

- Von Miller headed back to the weight room. Kubiak said yesterday he hoped to get Von going in full by midweek next week. ""Progression"" plan.

- As expected when Kubiak's offense isn't running the ball they will be throwing it deep.

- Lynch misses on two deep consecutive throws. Barely missed Latimer on the first. Gotsis getting a great push on the line.

- Kapri Bibbs on punt coverage. Smart move. Better chance to make the team.

- Punter battle underway. Dixon shanks one but comes back with solid punt next rep. 

- Looks like Norwood &amp; Addison handling returns.

- Trevor Siemian took first-team reps in second team session 

- Mark Sanchez first-team QB in third team session now

- Emmanuel Sanders was pulling away, TJ Ward stripped him but Sanders fell on the ball.

- Bennie Fowler is quietly having a good camp. Catching everything coming his way. Just made another tough one. 

- Trevor Siemian taking first-team reps in fourth set 

- Kayvon Webster also balling today. Just broke up two passes in a row intended for Emmanuel Sanders. These DBs are stout.

- For a WR who's a long shot to make the roster DeVier Posey makes a ton of camp receptions

- DeMarcus Ware just walked out to observe the end of practice.

- It has been pretty much a 50-50 split Sanchez/Siemian with the starters today

- Paxton Lynch getting one-on-one coaching from Gary Kubiak. 

- Not a great day for Brandon McManus who hooked a few field goals. 

- Paxton Lynch completes TD pass to Kalif Raymond. Lynch with a nice 39-yard ball on 3rd and long to Kalif Raymond in the corner of the end zone in 2-min drill. Lynch looked sharp on last drive during team drills. Love Lynch's enthusiasm. Ran to the end zone to greet Raymond. 

- Great way to cap off an up and down day for Lynch. 

**Injury/Inactive report**

- Sly Williams (injured shoulder yesterday) not wearing helmet or shoulder pads today.

- Phil Taylor walking out. No pads. Limping a bit. Sleeve on his left knee.

- Aqib Talib wearing gloves to watch practice today.

- He's not sure if he'll be limited to start camp

- He says his knee feels good. Got some reps late in OTAs. Said he stayed in Denver during the break working on further rehab.

- He said the torn meniscus/bone bruise he suffered at Utah was ""literally his first injury ever."" He said the biggest hurdle was mental. Was ""kind of tough"" in the beginning of rehab, but got easier.

- He said the cutting on his knee is back to normal.

- ""I'm here to compete and do what I gotta do to help this team."" 
- He said the vets didnt give him a hard time based on his comments about not being here to carry pads

- ""I thought the vets would give me grief about [shoulder pads] that comment, but they said they liked it."" 

- ""I'm not going to downplay myself and my ability. The vets were like ""what else are you supposed to say?""""

- ""I couldn't have landed in a better situation than in this scheme. Looking forward to playing my butt off""

Adam Gotsis 

- He says the knee ""feels good"" ... Was running around yesterday. Says it's still a ""day-by-day"" thing as far as his status.

- ""I've got full trust in them to get me right [healthy].""

- He says it was ""pretty tough"" to watch OTAs, but he said he learned from watching the older players.

- He said that it helped having Kenny Anunike on the sideline with him, because they could talk about what they were seeing on each play.

- He said he did individual drills yesterday during rookie practice. Expected to be eased into contact.

- He says he's going to learn all three positions on the defensive line. ""No real preference,"" but he knows DE is the best fit.

- He went back to Australia recently to get his visa worked out so he can legally work here.

- He had his first chance in 5 years to go home to Australia to see his family during the break. 

- On rookie hazing: ""Rather be here getting hazed than on a couch somewhere.""

- ""I used to carrying around a milk jug in class to put on weight and people would make fun of me. Now they see it paid off.""

Paxton Lynch

- ""It feels good to get back in the building.""

- ""I feel good. Feels good to get the wheels turning with the rookies these couple days. Excited for the vets to get in here.""

- He says the biggest area of growth is ""how far I've come mentally."" Said he had some trouble calling plays in the huddle when he started.

- ""From where I was when I first go here until now, I've made a lot of progress. I'm a lot more confident.""

- He says he's getting more comfortable with the playbook, but still has a ways to go.

- He said he's not at 100% knowledge of the playbook, but he's made a lot of progress.

- ""I definitely think I have an opportunity to better myself or play right away. As a competitor I'm not going to take a back seat."" Said he knew Siemian/Sanchez would be ahead b/c of their experience and knowledge of system.

- ""The biggest thing for me is to stay confident in myself ... keep pushing through.""

- ""It's my job as a rookie to push those guys who are ahead of me.""

- He said he did ""a lot of football"" work during time off. Worked in Orlando, threw to his brother. Threw to Mose Frazier in Memphis, too.

- On his comfort level in the huddle: ""It's definitely coming to me,"" but still more comfortable in no-huddle b/c of work at Memphis.

- ""Cam Newton's play style, how he fun he is to watch, how big he is, it's exciting to watch. I want to be exciting like that.""

- ""Right to left crossing patterns are the toughest throw, toughest for me at least.""",DenverBroncos,Denver Broncos rookies comments from training camp today,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/4uprj8/denver_broncos_rookies_comments_from_training/

- He pointed out Matt Paradis, Ty Sambrailo as early vet role models for him. Expects to play inside this year at G or C.

- He also mentions Max Garcia as someone he talks to and turns to when he has questions.

- He says he feels his best fit on the Broncos' O-line is inside at guard.

- He said he spent the downtime at home in North Dakota. Spent some weekends at a lake house -- good chance to relax.

- He said the 4 weeks of OTAs helped his technique. Said OL coach Clancy Barone left them w/ drills they could do on their own.

- ""I'm really excited for pads. It makes my job a lot easier, we have something to grab onto.""

- ""I'm ready to play football and price my spot on this team. Let's get after it""

- ""It's nice to refresh. There's nothing like being in the building. Nice to get a couple days before the vets get here.""

- He said he spent time studying in his iPad during the time off -- enough to be up to speed on base coverages for the start of camp.

- He said he's spent ""a lot"" of time with T.J. Ward in the offseason ... Said Ward advised him to respect teammates &amp; what he's doing.

- ""It's a big help to come in before the vets. If you aren't looking forward to this, you're crazy.""

- ""It's about to get real. It's about to go down.""

Justin Simmons

- The goal is ""to come in and play,"" not to take a ""redshirt"" year like college.

- ""As a rookie, you have to do what every rookie has to do. But in the grand scheme you are here to take somebody's job.""

- He said he spent his downtime training in Florida, where he did his Combine prep.

- During OTAs, he felt his fundamentals improved, said the vets &amp; coaches helped them refine tackling, getting in/out of breaks, etc.

- ""There's a standard already set, being the best secondary in the league. We have to come in and match that.""

- ""The vets demand a level of excellence in the secondary. They are not going to let a couple rookies come in and lower the bar.""

- He says he expects his special-teams role to be ""huge"" and the ""launching pad into the Broncos organization.""

- ""As important as it is to get on the field to play nickel, dime safety -- whatever it is they ask -- it's just as important on ST.""

- He also spoke highly of T.J. Ward, Darian Stewart and other vets who have helped him during OTAs.",DenverBroncos,Denver Broncos rookies comments from training camp today,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/4uk5ye/denver_broncos_rookies_comments_from_training/

- Adam Gotsis, Darian Stewart, Derek Wolfe, TJ Ward, Chris Harris all headed into the weight room. Not sure if it's just a lift day for them. (Looks like a rest day from practice for them)

- No DT or Sanders out there either (rest day)

- Aaron Neary, UDFA G out of EWU took his last final yesterday and is with the Broncos for the first time today.

- Other Broncos not here: Addison (school), Miller (contract), Peko (school), Anunike (back)

- DT getting the day off. Big chance for Jordan Taylor to get more reps with the ones and twos 

- Broncos UFA WR Khalif Raymond with 2 drops in 5 passes. That's not going to get you on a team.

- CJ Anderson and Ronnie Hillman both with a pair of true untouched runs during 11 v 11 period 

- Paxton Lynch just threw a bullet completion to DeVier Posey into zone coverage. Read it perfectly for a 20 yard pickup. 

- Even though it's an off day for Sanders he can't help but to constantly catch passes on the sidelines 

- Broncos giving several vets the day off. Hasn't been the most crisp practice from the offense. Overthrows, under throws and dropped passes

- Broncos look a bit sloppy on offense today. I've counted 7 drops so far and Paxton Lynch just overthrew a RB checkdown pass by 5 yards.

- Paxton Lynch to Frazier continues to look nice

- Kubiak on offense: ""we've made progress in the past couple days"" 
- Kubiak ""sat about 10 guys today but feel like we're making progress as a team. Impressed with our work/mentality"" 

- Kubiak said he thinks DeMarcus Ware could practice tomorrow but doesn't think he will out of precaution.

- Kubiak says Talib will be among players to stay regularly in town for treatment as the team breaks before training camp

- Kubiak said the plan is for Talib to remain in Denver during the June-July break to rehab his gunshot wound injury under team supervision

- Broncos Kubiak on whether Von is league's best defensive player. ""I think he's a great player."" Didn't get into rankings.

- Riley Dixon had a punt with a hang time of 5.09 seconds today. Colquitt's best was 5.02, but he was more consistent.

- ""I think you're going to see it get better and better.  Today was a step in the right direction"" Gary Kubiak on Mark Sanchez progress at QB

- The QBs were told that the rotating with the ones is basically done 

- Sanchez: You have to take advantage when you get your shot with the ones.

- Sanchez: Emmanuel and I got it going a little bit today. We have a lot of guys that are eager to make plays.

- Sanchez: I got to address the team after practice and I appreciated that opportunity.

- Sanchez on building chemistry ""coming along with E. DT looked good, Bennie Looked good. Jordan Taylor went up for a ball. It's exciting""

- Sanchez: The ultimate goal is to get back to the White House next year.

- Mark Sanchez says the finger feels much better, ""hasn't even though about it""

- Sanchez a couple completions to Sanders his 2nd go around 7 on 7

- Lynch a couple completions with 1st team. Then almost picked by Talib.

- Devontae Booker starting to get some 7 on 7 reps this week. Good signs on his knee.

- Memphis connection. Paxton Lynch to Mose Frazier for 35 yd grab down left sidelines. John Tidwell got banged up, headed into locker room.

- Parks says he has learned a lot in just a few weeks. After adjusting to speed of the players it has been great 

- Simmons: I'm really picking up the details.

- Simmons: I just have to follow the lead of the veterans. They move really fast and if you miss something they get on you quickly.

- Simmons: I love being versatile and helping out whatever way I can. Moving around a little more that at BC.

- Simmons: Will and I, after our first meeting, we went to our lockers and were like ""Whoa, this is the real deal.""

- Simmons: Will and I are roommates we're helping each other out whatever way we can.

- Simmons: I expected the defense to be talkers. Look at all the success they've had on the field.

- Sanchez: Thumb feels awesome. Real good.

- Sanchez: It's gotta be fun to compete or you shouldn't be out here.

- Sanchez: I Just need to be consistent. Make the right decisions and show that I understand what the team needs in each moment.

- Sanchez: You just have to get the ball In the air and DT and Emmanuel do the rest.

- Sanchez: CJ knows quite a bit about this offense. He's pretty sharp. He knows all the right checks and he's not afraid to let you know.

- Sanchez: I feel pretty good about the offense. I put a lot of pressure on myself to learn it quickly.

- Siemian: I think Paxton is doing a great job. I'm just throwing him little tips here and there.

- Siemian: There's a lot of competition out here. It's fun.

- Siemian emphasized he can only take the reps he is given and make the most of them. Feels confident.

- Talib: Half the time I don't even see who the quarterback is, I'm focused on the receiver in front of me.

- Talib: These OTAs matter. It's not just about showing up. You learn a lot, build chemistry.

- Talib: It's so fun to line up against DT and and Emmanuel. So fun to talk trash with them.

- Elway: ""We feel good about Mark (Sanchez).""

- Elway: ""We evaluate all the character concerns. ... Every situation is different. One of the best things we have is our locker room.""

- Elway on if Nkemdiche is red flag: ""Ask me on the 30th.""

- Question: Could you give us positions of need? Elway: “No”

- John Elway said he’s realized it’s much better to win a championship as a player than as an executive. You get much more time off.

- Asked if Broncos considered trying to move up high in draft, Elway said ""it would have taken four of our drafts."" So, no.

- Elway on Von holding out: ""This is all voluntary. If Von chooses to be here, then great. You always hope that everybody is here.""

- Elway: ""I know what I think of Von Miller, I know what this organization thinks of Von and we're going to work our tail off to get it done.""

- “It’s not nearly as bad as people have portrayed it out there” -Elway on Von Miller negotiations. Said there has been an offer and a counter

- Elway: ""We'll always miss Peyton. Peyton has been a big part of this.""

- Elway: ""There's a lot of good players in this draft, but I think offensive line is one area where there's a lot of depth.""

- Elway on Kaepernick: ""It's dormant."" Not dead yet, the offer is there.

- Elway on Trevor Siemian: ""Trevor's going to compete, too. Whether we bring in 3 or whether we bring in 4 ...he'll be in the hunt.""

- DT said he had worked out with Sanchez about four years ago at USC.

- DT said last year was ""probably the worst"" he he's had in the last four years. Mainly the drops. ""Probably thinking too much. ... It's easy to go out and catch the ball. That's my job and I should be able to do it.""

- DT on what he'd do if team approached him for help clearing cap space: ""If there's something they want me to do, I'll do it.""

- DT: Sanchez ""doesn't try to do too much,"" but says Sanchez has asserted himself as a leader, organizing film-watching sessions, etc.

- DT says that with his mom's situation settled &amp; his contract set, ""This year is all football.""

- DT: Last year wasn't easy after missing offseason time ... ""I think it will be big being here with the guys now.""

- DT says he's not paying attention to the Broncos QB situation. Leaving that to the front office 'That's their job""

- Chris Harris expects Todd Davis to come in and start for Danny Trevathan. ""I think he'll do a great job of coming in and fill that role.""

- Harris on Von Miller: ""You see this every year. ... It's the nature of our business.""

- Harris on if he'd be surprised if Von Miller didn't show until July. ""No, I wouldn't be surprised. That's kind of normal.""

- Harris asked to list his top 5 corners. Sherman, Revis, Peterson, Talib, him. Did not have Josh Norman on that list: ""Gotta do it more than one year""

- Chris Harris said his shoulder is 100 percent. ""I'm probably stronger than I was coming in last offseason.""

- Chris Harris says he wants to be more active in blitzing this year

- Chris Harris on Malik and Trevathan: ""They played with their hair on fire. I love those guys. They're definitely gonna be missed.""

- Harris said he didn't know Newton could hear his post-SB comments. Wouldn't change them even if he had known.

- Chris Harris said he still believes they have the best d-line on the league. They will have chip on shoulder to prove themselves again.

- Harris says that getting more interceptions is a focal point for the defense this year, as is committing fewer penalties.

Sanders on Mark Sanchez: ""He has created a “great impression” in his short time with the team, showing that he’s a “natural leader.” I can’t speak for everyone else, but I can speak for myself, I went out to California. I worked out with him. He’s been texting me all the time wanting to hang. Just going out there to California, I can tell he wants to be a leader on this team, he wants to be the quarterback and he wants to be the guy. I was impressed by his arm strength. I was impressed with the throws he was making. I’ve been here around the locker room and he’s been spending extra time in the facility. That’s the type of guy that we need.”

“It definitely feels weird not having [Manning] around because I’ve been with him for two years,” Sanders said. “Seeing him around and not having his presence in the locker room, it feels a little weird. That’s my brother. We definitely miss him around here. We want to talk about just a great locker room guy, a great leader of this team. He’s going to be forever missed in this locker room, but guys have got to step up. . . . The good thing is Peyton gave us the blueprint of how to go about doing it. Spending time off the field, getting to know guys, so we’re going to continue to follow that blueprint.”

Sanders: ""I don't think you don't ever put 2015 behind you. Everyday I'm gonna go home and talk to my ring.""

Sanders told Brock Osweiler that he lives in Houston. Said you better buy me dinner, better yet buy me a car with that contract.

Sanders said he talked to John Elway after the SB. Elway told him he enjoyed his SB, but was already thinking about the next one.

My favorite:

Emmanuel Sanders: ""The city of Denver has been really good to me. I want to be a Bronco for a long time. I want to retire a Bronco. Hopefully everything works out. I'm sure both sides will come to something. We want to see how it goes, but right now it's not about me. It's about this team, it's about winning championships, and that's what I'm focused on.""",DenverBroncos,Emmanuel Sanders comments from today,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/4fdjh3/emmanuel_sanders_comments_from_today/

""You got the target on your back now.""

On Peyton's empty locker: ""I don't think anyone's bold enough to sit in that spot.""

""I'm happy for Brock. He's going to have a chance to take care of his family for a loooong time. ... We wish him well.""

""Dancing With the Stars, they probably gonna want to call me.""

Aqib Talib says he's a better dancer than Von Miller. Thinks DWTS is scared to bring him in.

Aqib Talib on Von Miller not being here: “He’s going through the business side of football. He’ll be back soon enough.""

Aqib Talib says leaders on the team, including himself, have to play a big part in keeping teammates focused in a quest to repeat.

These are all the options whether realistic or speculated (except Manziel because it's just bullshit):

- Mark Sanchez (Our starting QB right now)

- Trevor Siemian (Only other QB on the team)

- Colin Kaepernick (Shit load of trade rumors, so close to being a done deal, may be unlikely due to no one budging)

- Ryan Fitzpatrick (Free agent QB, some liked the idea of him being a stop-gap QB for a year or two)

- Paxton Lynch (Rookie QB from Memphis, projected first rounder)

- Connor Cook (Rookie QB from Michigan St., projected first to second rounder)

- Dak Prescott (Rookie QB from Mississippi St., projected late round QB)

- Jeff Driskel (Rookie QB from La. Tech and Florida, visited with us last week)

- Mike Glennon (Trade option with Tampa Bay)

- A.J. McCarron (Trade option with Cincinnati) 

- Josh McCown (Trade option with Cleveland)

- Christian Hackenberg (Rookie QB from Penn St., seen a few people pulling for him)

- Kevin Hogan (Rookie QB from Stanford, seen a few people pulling for him)

- T.J. Yates (Houston QB Kubiak might like)

- Tom Savage (Houston QB Kubiak might like)

If you want to throw another out there just go for it. Again this is just a shitpost, but just curious where everyone is at with the draft approaching.

- Jacoby Brissett (Rookie QB from Florida and NC State)

- Tyrod Taylor (Trade rumor last week about him)",DenverBroncos,Who do you want as our starting QB next year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/4emkeg/who_do_you_want_as_our_starting_qb_next_year/

What do you guys think of the current group? Honestly this is a group we are quite thin at and that I see us targeting in the draft. We need a better pass catching guy and I'd honestly like to see two guys on the roster who can do damage in the passing game. 

As far as blocking tight ends go, we are set with Green and Gordon. We all know how beastly Green is at blocking. Gordon I think can help the rushing game in short yardage situations. 

Now the x-factor is Jeff Heuerman. I really hope this guy can be the solution and be a beast at pass catching and blocking.

Guys like Von, Shane Ray, and Shaq having a good day is crucial, but my x-factor is Malik Jackson. If our guys can flush Roethlisberger outside, Malik could have a great day. He has 3.5 sacks on the season and can knock down passes at the line of scrimmage which is huge against a big dude like Ben. The Broncos need to get at least four sacks in this game and must force Big Ben to come off his receivers and throw the ball away to prevent a sack. Consistent pressure should cause mistakes and hits on the always injured Ben will take their toll.
