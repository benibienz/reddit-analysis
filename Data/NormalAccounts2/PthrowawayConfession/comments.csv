0,To clarify: I did intend to paint an ambivalent picture but perhaps hashtag is right in that that does not go far enough.,2016-08-28 17:59:12+00:00,d706hlu,5,t1_d70675a,436,confession
1,"I just think now that that isn't the complete picture. I can be impoverished in spite of my bank balance. Perhaps the money is worth it for those women, but is the world in which that money is worth it, worth it? That that is the world we live in does not mean that I have to settle for it. I have the power to add least not add to the misery once I come to the conclusion that that is what I am doing.",2016-08-28 17:55:57+00:00,d706cyo,2,t1_d70563g,1777,confession
2,"Well put. You're right and I should. I think I am moving there, it's just easy to fall back into the old state of mind when asked about whether it felt real back then.",2016-08-28 17:51:56+00:00,d70675a,4,t1_d705da0,1236,confession
3,"I feel strangely uncomfortable answering that, which must be the reason I stopped counting. I am able to give parameters. I was active for about three years. My first encounters were sporadic, but somewhere about midway I must have derailed because I remember 40 women in all. I came back to around half a dozen to them, which is how I went about it for the last one year and a half. 

I guess that it's only right that I feel like a scumbag recollecting this. ",2016-08-28 15:37:50+00:00,d701207,2,t1_d6zwoua,8465,confession
4,"Oh wow. I'm not sure if I should respond, but I feel for you. It must feel terrible to feel thwarted in your relationship by your partner's inability to properly bond with you sexually. I certainly hope it didn't feel that way to my ex.

But certainly I am aware that buying sex certainly does not help you, when it comes to that. That is also a good reason to get out, I suppose.",2016-08-28 12:59:42+00:00,d6zwaef,3,t1_d6zw0pr,686,confession
5,"It's hard to tell because of how rote it all is. Similarly it is hard to distinguish when a girl is 'not into it' from when she has strong sense of hygiene. Is she being professional, distant, or both? I felt like I could make out differences, but I cannot convince someone on the internet without feeling like I come across delusional.

I found myself coming back to a foreign girl in a seedy part of town who was in her early thirties and insecure her age and her looks. She laid me down and gave me a startled glance, saying ""wait -- you're beautiful"" before stammeringly taking it back because of how ridiculous it all was. 

It seems to me there simply is no way of telling whether part of her genuinely liked me (was that why the sex felt pleasant? or did I just think she was hot?) or whether she was just clumsily humoring me like she would anyone else. ",2016-08-28 12:34:47+00:00,d6zvpk0,2,t1_d6zv0ly,1951,confession
