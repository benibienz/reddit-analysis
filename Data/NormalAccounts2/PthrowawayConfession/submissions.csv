My only explanation for having done so much of it is that biographical experiences (insecurity, vanity, selfishness) had at some point gotten me to obsess over prostitutes. However it is also a habit I've gradually gotten tired of. I write this confession, to better be able to make good on my goal to quit once and for all.

The problem is that I have been trying to quit for about three months now and I have occasionally backslid. The trend, thankfully, is positive, but I would have better If I had completely stuck with my plans. I know myself pretty well now, and I know that I am weak-willed and just not very moral, and that I am good at making excuses.

My experience with evaluations on prostitution is that in spite of the fact that many people support it 'in theory', once it comes too close for comfort they 'turn around'. It is pretty much the ultimate NIMBY. 'Sad people' are the ones that are supposed to do it, not me, not people they actually know. I have confessed to an ex-gf, at length (foolishly), about what I had done, and it is just heartbreaking to see the pain and grief it causes them. A strong, but not sole, motivation for me to quit is to not cause any more grief and harm to my loved ones than I already have. 

But I backslid once we broke up, telling myself it was only temporary (my parting promise was not to go back, though I instantly told myself I did not owe her). To be honest, I was not over my mild (?) obsession even when I was with her. For the record, I did not partake when I was with her, though on some dubious occasions I came close but turned back. But my recent experiences have made it clear to me that I should be over my obsession-turned-habit now. Like some redditors I initially believed (for a long time) that prostitution was a means to (my) 'sexual enfranchisement', but I now realize how wrong I feel that it was and how wrong I feel that _I_ was. Maybe I am enfranchised now, but was that worth it, and what does it even mean? 

Though I have no real moral of religious objections to prostitution, I have come to the conclusion - the wrong way, I suppose - that for an overwhelming amount of cases it is just a lose-lose proposition for all parties involved, maintained and abetted only by great amounts of self-deception and misery. From personal experience, the use of your body like that at some point just seems to me to 'get at' most sex-workers. Socially I am in favor of a policy of toleration, but it is clear to me that it is the toleration of something (really) bad. 

A lot of people's remorse about prostitution seems to be triggered by the fear of std's. So far I have been clean. Though my thoughts about std's have of course been self-serving to some extent, I got myself over those fears by pointing out you can get those in relatively 'honest' ways, meaning that std's are not nature's punishment for evil people having evil sex. I still believe that.

Another reason seems to be the fear of getting found out by loved ones and people you want to be respected by. I always thought this kind of fear was self-serving. My experiences with my ex-gf, however, had made this made this reason make more sense to me. Looking stupid or pathetic, disappointing your loved ones is another. I confess anonymously out of pragmatism rather than real fear, only because it seems foolish to tell friends willy-nilly about your problematic behavior the same way you would about, say, heavy drinking.  

But I need to confess to this because it has been a problem for me, because I will always need to tell people about it who might otherwise get hurt, and because I feel that for me, the wrong I did will stick to me like alcoholism (to come back to that imperfect analogy). Though, like I said, I do not have deeply moral problems with prostitution, I just think both that it is bad and that I have a problem - if alone for willfully having done something bad. It weighs on _my_ conscience and _I_ will need to make peace with it.

I write this to make some kind of record of my thoughts and to have interested people read it and perhaps call me out on some of the bs I might have couched it in. Like I said, I am weak and I already backslid. Though steps back belong to any process of moving forward I sometimes use it to make excuses. I just hope you people can make more sense of me than I can. ",confession,Quitting prostitutes [tough love],https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/4zyz2e/quitting_prostitutes_tough_love/
