18,"On paper I think TPM and AtoC are great and make a lot of sense from a certain point of view. Idk how someone could think of staging a galactic war from the inside but it works. The only problem was the execution of the movies, putting a focus on world/galaxy building using CGI and nobody around to challenge George on certain decisions was its biggest downfall. If George allowed/had someone to help him (idk if he did or not or had a pack of yes men) I think a lot of dialogue would be cleaned up, Darth Maul wouldn't have ""died"" and Jar Jar would never be created. Cleaning up those 4 mistakes would have drastically changed the views of the prequels. The majority of people say episode 3, 4, or 5 is their favorite film imagine if the prequels were made a little differently people would be defending all the films and you could never go wrong.

226,"To start Wade Phillips is a great play caller/game planner. He almost always has the right players on the field for the situation.   
On top of that most of our defensive players are good which allows Wade to do different coverages/blitzes. We can blitz and be comfortable with our corners not having a safety or we can rush 4 and have confidence that there will be pressure or sack on the QB most teams in the league don't have the freedom to mix it up with as much success as the Broncos.  
One thing we all know for sure is no matter how good the QB is about spotting defenses and picking up blitzes it doesn't help if the oline/receivers simply can't stop it.    ",2016-10-05 20:11:56+00:00,d8fhmce,1.0,t3_5617be,3660.0,DenverBroncos
