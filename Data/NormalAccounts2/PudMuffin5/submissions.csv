When Trevor Siemian started to turn heads in the preseason I decided to find some statistics to see what was going on, what I found out was troubling.  
(tl;dr at bottom)    

&amp;nbsp;

**Players**  
In 20 years (1994-2013) 49 Quarterbacks were taken in the first round and 47 were taken in the 7th round.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Win Percentage**  
1st round QBs had a win percentage of 0.516 7th round quarterbacks 0.389%, if you wanted to know 7th round QBs had a 0.000% post season win percentage.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Completion Percentage**  
1st round QBs had a 59.8 completion percentage 7th round QBs had 56.9%  

&amp;nbsp;

**Touchdown Percentage**  
1st round QBs had a 4.18 TD percentage 7th round QBs had 3.73%  

&amp;nbsp;

**Interception Percentage**  
1st round QBs had a 2.95 interception percentage 7th round QBs had a 3.44%  

&amp;nbsp;

**Sack Percentage**  
1st round QBs had a 6.35 sack percentage 7th round QBs had a 6.67%  

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr**  
7th round Quarterbacks in the last 20 years (1994-2013) are statistically worse in every category compared to 1st round Quarterbacks.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion**  
Do yourself a favor and keep our QB situation in perspective Trevor was drafted in the 7th round for a reason. He has 2 paths in the NFL Tom Brady level good or a career backup; don't be mad at me just realize 20 years of statistics tell us he doesn't have a chance. That being said I say we roll with Trevor good, bad, or ugly until Paxton Lynch is ready.
