First off this is commonly referred to as a quote from  Albert Eistein, but there little evidence of him ever writing this. I read somewhere that its even been written before his time (I dont have source, on my phone atm)

Secondly, it's a pretty narrow minded term for insanity. 

And on top of that, it's a extremely cliche and overused quote.

Although avoid sellers that:

* Don't use wickr
* promise a suspiciously huge variety of strains and products
* Have huge walls of text in their ad (the legit ones keep it short)
* Want the money wired (CASH IN-HAND is essential)
* Also deal other drugs (Personally I'd avoid these)

Use at own risk, though.

&gt;**The purists.** Those who desired to bring hip-hop back to the old times, to the old school, before the bling bling era, before gangsta rap.

&gt; **The experimentalists.** Those who wanted to push further hip-hop's boundaries, to freestyle, to play with words, to flirt with jazz's free forms or with electronica's strange and sophisticated sounds.

&gt; **The introverts.** Those who tried to overthrow rap's egotist logic, to dig into the intimate, to sink into depression, sometimes approaching other genres more familiar with vulnerability, like folk or indie rock.

*Edit: I contacted the artist and he filled in the blanks for me.*

&gt; I was never a huge fan of tupac or biggie

&gt; Consider me an outast, won't support the top 50 carbon copies

&gt; Don't got shit for me, where's my b-boys trying to take back the cities?

&gt; it goes dip-dip diving, never socializing 

&gt; to put it in to words I'm introverted in the silence, the moniker

&gt; The man in the mirror, its whats behind this make-up that doesn't say much he wears the costume like a ball in chain

&gt; When the crowds call his name he's a janitor at night that sweeps the halls of fame

&gt; And it's all the same, it's nothing new to him, this suit and grin doesn't suit him and his shoes don't fit

&gt; Been through walking so he pursues music on foot

&gt; and he chooses not to assume to look like ""fuck you""

&gt; Walking down beat street without break-dancing just rapping about things you take for granted

&gt; On the corner, I'm burning gap-sweaters and Commons' name

&gt; Because everything you said meant nothing when you put on them chains

&gt; A hundred miles I'm running on this track like I'm running for my life in pursuit of my true love



&gt; &gt; Full-time work part-time entertainer

&gt; &gt; My car is my dressing room, I'll show you what I'm made of.

&gt; ^x2



&gt; Cos I don't do this on the side, I do it in my spare-time so spare me the canned laughter after every punchline

&gt; Hustling find it troubles the mind stumbling, fumbling, mumbling on rhymes

&gt; I hate it when crowds get easily impressed by double-time

&gt; You can't please them all, you feed it to them more maybe they'll get some respect while my city is in the storm


&gt; But I won't believe the hype, fuck the views and magazine cos most critics and failed artists take it out on acts like me


&gt; Take this show on the road with no circus

&gt; The only thing my words served was a purpose

&gt; The double edged sword I walking on, like the shoestring-budget that I work with and wear this clothes like closed curtains


&gt; A college grad with a filmdegree and no insurance

&gt; My eyes darker than Cliver Barker and Tim Burtons'

&gt; I stare into the audience and tell it like it is

&gt; and kill them softly with a millions cuts and slices I give

&gt; Got a lot of nerve saying hip-hops dead

&gt; Made a living off your fans who think you understand them, it's pathetic

&gt; Like suburban MCs who pack up and headed to the ghetto just to get some street credit
Fuck that where's ya saviors to stop the burning

&gt; They're in paradise living off your hard earnings

&gt; Cos I never sold drugs, I never sold out

&gt; Just want my music heard, word up and no doubt




&gt; &gt; Cos you got nothing for me cos you're still the same story


&gt; ^x4



&gt; &gt; Full-time work part-time entertainer

&gt; &gt; My car is my dressing room, I'll show you what I'm made of.

Rust had over 1 million units sold within the first month, and it's steadily increasing with all these updates. I'm guessing they'll ""re-launch"" Rust once it's out of beta so the sales will sky-rocket again. 

From what I've heard and seen Ark is nowhere near a ""finished product"". The team behind Rust consistently listens to the community and add new features weekly. This is incredibly rare. Even DayZ, which promised complete transparency throughout the whole development-process is flawed. Considering how well the development of Rust has gone so far, people should have more faith.
