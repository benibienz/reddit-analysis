31,"Amber is most likely referencing the yellow light that appears before the red light at a traffic stop. At least here in the USA, anyway. So green light turns yellow (amber) then it turns red (stop). Hence amber comes before we stop. And for further clarification, he means amber (the girl) cumming before they stop having sex.

Also, the portrait on the bill will be watermarked on the lower right side of the note for any bill after 1996 (except 5s. Those are after 1999, IIRC).

909,"&gt;Movies realize that they are 2 hours of entertainment and that's what people expect to get when they go see a film so they scale their price accordingly

For the sake of friendly disagreement maybe 60 dollars is worth the amount of gameplay they get from said game. Such as if I get 60 hours out of battlefront, then decide I'm bored with it, that would be a dollar per 1 hour of gameplay. And being that the premier dlc will bring a lot more content to keep it fresh (assuming it's the same as BF4, as they are going strong still) then I'd say 50 dollars is a fair price point.
