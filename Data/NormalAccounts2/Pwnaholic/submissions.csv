I have recently ascended and it's been glorious, as most of you know. But I still own my Xbox One and my Ps4. I rarely use them, and the Xbox is easy for me to let go of, but the Ps4 has been my home for awhile. And PSVR looks good. Can I get some serious replies to help severe my attachments? Should I keep it? It's a hard decision to make alone.

Also, I do kind of like the new Nintendo Switch thus far..

I'd love to hear some respectful discussions and success stories of leaving the consoles behind, or reasons you may have kept it.

Right clicking to bring up a menu on lets say the start bar shows an outline of a menu, but no test. Just the background behind it. At least not at first. It eventually ""loads"" in.

So basically I wanted to share my excitement and thank you all for the awesome community that you are. Guess I better stop typing and hop to it!

They all have their pros and cons and we all have our opinions of these cars, but this little Ford never stops putting a smile on my face.

I owned a '08 Ninja 250 back in 2009, then never got a new one until this past Saturday.

Anyway, I have a battery question, if anyone could advise. Im not very mechanically inclined, but do want to work on my own bike. My bike had to be charged up Saturday from the small dealer that I got it from. But once I got on it and rode it home, I had no issues all weekend, or on the way to and from work on Monday. But this morning it didn't want to fire up. It clicked a little, I kept giving it a little go and eventually there was no more clicks and it just did nothing but light up the dash. (Had to drive my cager in this nice Texas Weather :/) Would you say this battery is Dead and needs replaced, or is it possibly something else? I did notice there is a switch under the handle bars for some LEDs, and I have no idea how that would even be set up, but I can imagine it could be the culprit, among probably many other things. Mainly, is there something I should try first and branch out from there? I'm working currently, but plan on taking a look at it this evening. Any info will help!
