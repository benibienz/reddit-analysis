1. So no workout on Wednesdays, just resting. Mild climbing on Thursdays with hangboard. Would the ""recovery workout"" fit in on any of the days, or just do it on Saturday?

1. I was a little concerned about this too, but Wednesday should be pretty mellow. I just got my boyfriend into climbing and he's still new so this is our day to climb together. Once the bouldering competition is over, I probably won't climb on Tuesday if I replace it with yoga.

2. I've got two trips to the New planned before I go back to the Red, one this month and one in July. Ideally I'd like to go more often but... Work and school :(

3. I guess I could switch to a more power specific workout in the second phase. I don't necessarily enjoy ARC so I can't complain haha.

4. I think I'm throwing yoga in there more so I'm just doing something active on what could be a rest day. And because my gym offers it right after the Tamara core class. I could also go running, but I get so bored with that.",2016-06-03 14:22:49+00:00,d3uh6yw,2.0,t1_d3ugnwy,790.0,climbharder

My mom is pretty influential in a small niche of the programming world. She has a very specialized set of skills and does some awesome work for a contracting firm. She had been talking about getting me a job there for awhile, but the catch is I need a bachelors degree in computer science to do it.

I finally got too fed up with retail and had to do something. She was able to get me an internship there, and I've been learning semantic technologies and Java! It's also allowed me to go back to school full time; the job is remote so I can work whenever and wherever. Right now I'm working on a Java web application for ontologies.
