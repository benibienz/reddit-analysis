I just started taking a microbiology course and my health anxiety has gone off the charts. I've always been a hypochondriac (who loves to google), but it's just ridiculous now. The professor talks about these dangerous bacteria and I just freak out, thinking everything is going to infect me. Even handling the harmless bacteria in lab makes me nervous. I've never been a germaphobe but... I might be now.

My professor especially likes to talk about the bacteria that causes anthrax. I just moved into a new apartment and opened up the oven to find a strange powder all over the bottom. My first thought was anthrax, but who the hell would put that there? It's most likely baking soda used to clean it, but my mind can't stay away from that thought. I was almost too scared to cook dinner last night.

I need this class for my major, but I'm having a very tough time dealing with this.

For some background, I'm a lady with a very short wing span, and I've always had issues with strength... and height. But I'm tired of making excuses, so I did some research into ways to train and developed a periodization-based training plan (heavily based on [The Making of a Rockprodigy](https://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/tools-for-rock-climbing-training/the-making-of-a-rock-prodigy/)). Anyway, enough of that.


**Weeks 1 - 4: Strength**

* M: Lemon Lime, 5 sets ([number 4 in this list](http://www.climbing.com/skills/training-16-climbing-games/)) and Hangboard
* T: Bouldering (for 2-month long competition) and tabata core workout
* W: Mild route climbing or bouldering and hangboard
* Th: Recovery workout
* F: ARC on routes with partner, 3 x 30 (5.9 - 5.10 on lead, up and down)
* S: Recovery workout
* Su: Rest day

**Weeks 5-8: Power**

* M: Limit bouldering and hangboard
* T: Bouldering (for 2-month long competition) and tabata core
* W: Route climbs or bouldering and campus board
* Th: Recovery workout
* F: ARC on routes 3 x 30 min, hangboard
* S: Recovery workout
* Su: Rest

**Weeks 9-12: Power**

* M: 4 x 4 Bouldering
* T: Tabata core and yoga (bouldering competition is over)
* W: Route climbs and hangboard
* Th: Recovery workout
* F: ARC on routes 3 x 30 min, hangboard
* S: Recovery workout
* Su: Rest

**Weeks 13-16: Peak**

* Send projects, go to the Red.


I got the hangboard workout [from Steph Davis's blog](http://stephdavis.co/blog/hangboard-workout-for-climbing-how-and-why/).
I got a 15-min beginner campus board workout [here](http://mojagear.com/journal/2015/06/01/a-beginner-guide-to-campus-board-training/), since I've never done this sort of training. I've played around with a campus board before and really struggled with it, so I wanted to ease in to it.
Finally, I found a rest-day recovery workout [here](http://mojagear.com/journal/2015/04/22/a-rest-day-workout-for-climbers-who-hate-rest-days/). I'm doing the intermediate workout with 4 sets of 5 pull-ups (my current max) replacing YTWL.


A few questions:

* Do I really need to ARC the whole time? Or would it be more beneficial to replace that later on with something else?
* Is yoga worth it? Or is my time better spent bouldering?
* Finally, just looking for general feedback, recommendations, experiences, etc. etc... :)

I don't know how the outdoor climbing is there, but I can lead sport outdoors 5.10 and trad up to 5.6 (maybe 7 if I'm feeling crazy). Got a full rack and a rope. It's winter, though, so I don't expect much.
