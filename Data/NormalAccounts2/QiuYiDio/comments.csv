2,"If your goal is strategy consulting, then focus on an MBA.  You can get there any number of ways, including staying at your firm or transitioning to the FP&amp;A opportunity.  So long as your application tallies up to demonstrated achievement in your professional life, a stellar GMAT, extracurricular leadership, and polished essays, recommendations, etc, you have a good shot at target schools.

I will warn you against going all in for PE / VC with either route.  Those who end up with PE / VC after MBA are almost always those who have done PE / VC before MBA (Harvard/ Stanford exceptions apply).  Furthermore, corporate finance is generally not a feeder into either of those highly selective fields.

McKinsey is not looking to do digitization projects for tech companies (look at that digitization heatmap - all greens for the industries you mentioned).

Instead, the focus that *they* want to emphasize are those *other* five categories of industries who are part of that 72% ""not reaching their digital potential"", such as: ""B2B sectors with the potential to digitally engage and interact with their customers"" (hello, digital customer journey and experience design for O&amp;G, chemicals, and industrials!), ""labor-intensive sectors with potential to provide digital tools"" (hello, end-to-end digital transformation for real estate, education, and McDonalds!), and of course, ""quasi-public that lag across most sectors"" (hello, holy cow you need us for everything government, hospitals, and non-profits!).

21,"The US economy, for all of its innovation and resilience, has been weighed down by stubbornly weak
growth and a productivity slowdown. Most households experienced real income declines in the past decade.
Although the picture has brightened in recent months, long-term risks remain. This is a moment to consider
how to accelerate and sustain growth while making it more inclusive. The United States needs to regain its
dynamism—and the sense that everyone is advancing together. This can take many forms: re-engaging
more workers in the labor force and improving their mobility, fostering new business formation and healthy
competition, and helping declining cities reinvent themselves. While we do not make specific policy
recommendations, this research shows how targeted action and investment in five areas could create
substantial impact, potentially raising real GDP growth to 3.5 percent per year over the next decade.

- The United States is digitizing so rapidly that most users are scrambling to adapt. But while digitization
has altered daily life for most Americans, it has been slower to penetrate large sectors of the economy. In
fact, we estimate that the United States is realizing only 18 percent of its digital potential. Deepening
digital usage and capabilities in lagging sectors and firms is an important piece of the productivity puzzle.
Government can play a role by promoting digital investment, digitizing public services and procurement,
and clarifying regulatory standards to encourage digital innovation.

- A relatively small share of US companies and cities dominate the nation’s trade with the rest of the world
and capture most of its inbound investment. Now globalization is rapidly changing, with a 45-fold increase
in cross-border data flows over the past decade, in ways that play to US strengths. Firms of all sizes, and
regions across the country, need encouragement to engage directly with global markets and investors to
share in the benefits. But it is also time for a real inventory of the needs of communities that experienced
trade shocks; workers caught up in industry transitions need greater and more sustained support.

- More than 80 percent of the US population lives in cities or surrounding metro areas, and their mobility
and quality of life are increasingly at risk. Investment in urban transport infrastructure has not kept up with
the needs of cities, creating congestion that raises costs and harms productivity. A shortage of affordable
housing and commercial space has worsened the squeeze on households and businesses. Addressing
these urban issues would improve worker mobility, create new investment opportunities, and benefit
companies. The overall economy would stand to gain, since cities are the nation’s engines of productivity. 

- Less than 40 percent of college students complete bachelor’s degrees within four years. But even as
recent graduates struggle to pay off nearly $1.3 trillion in student loans, workers could see an acceleration
in technology-driven job churn in the next decade. The United States needs to build a more dynamic and
responsive labor market to respond to these challenges, with more career paths outside the traditional
degree track and more portable licensing requirements. Creating more apprenticeships and well-targeted
training programs can put many on a more direct route to good jobs. New tech platforms and data-driven
insights could help improve job matching and retool the entire US system of skills development.

- Competition among fuel sources and technology-driven efficiency improvements are combining to
produce an unheralded energy revolution—one that could make resource firms more productive, reduce
energy bills for consumers and for businesses in downstream industries, and make the entire economy
more efficient. Policy can support this ongoing wave of innovation by continuing to take an “all of the
above” approach to the nation’s energy portfolio and ensuring that regulatory bodies are responsive and
far-sighted about speeding the allocation of capital to the most promising opportunities.

Accelerating growth and productivity—not through cost cutting but through investment and higher output—is
a matter of urgency. Spurring robust demand growth and taking steps to relieve the pressures on household
budgets are also important pieces of the puzzle. Since private investment has not responded to low interest
rates, the public sector may need to play a role in kick-starting this process and driving demand. This
approach could set off a virtuous cycle of sustainable growth. With so many technology breakthroughs and
new markets on the horizon, the United States should not settle for stagnation.",2016-11-20 16:30:13+00:00,da89w1i,1.0,t3_5dyqw0,100.0,consulting

Again, no trends, but the people who I have seen enter as an experienced Analyst, are those with stellar resumes but did not consider consulting before (often doing banking, big tech, or PE instead), those with inside connections, those who really impressed someone in the course of an engagement while on the client side, and those who had a very successful startup exit.

To /u/DBBMtoss's point, in past years, this was less of an issue because most firms recruited on the same timeline and so you'd have all of your decisions to decide between.  More recently, Deloitte (and investment banks who have been recently struggling with recruitment) has notably pushed to be earlier in the process, and now other Big4s are following suit.  My firm basically saw this as an attempt for these firms to try to snatch up top talent before students even had the chance to interview for MBB.  For many schools, we've also moved to match their timelines, but I suppose OP's is a case in which we have not yet.

64,"They are indeed very different things.  

A DD is done over a 2 or 3 week period, and the intent is to give a recommendation on whether or not to buy a company.  You would rapidly look at things like the industry head and tail winds, the company's financial strength, its competitive positioning, etc.  All of this is ultimately to feed the assumptions of a financial model that tries to give you a feel for whether or not you can generate a return from the company that is worth your investment.  Furthermore, some DDs, especially those of hostile takeover targets, are done entirely from the outside-in; that is, you are not privy to any private information about the company.

The intent of a pure strategy project however, has you planning out exactly what the company should be in X years, as well as the capital allocation needed to get there.  Unlike a DD, you spend much more significant time understanding the industry, the company's business units, where each of those BUs should go, and what the company needs to do to make it possible.  Furthermore, you often end up deeply embedded with the organization in order to understand the firm's capabilities and the gaps that need to be invested in to attain its strategy.  Often times defining a fitting strategy is easier than balancing the capital allocation across business units and capabilities to grow and to enable growth. 

So to return to your question - the work is similar in that you are assessing an industry and where a company fits, but the intent and follow through are very different.",2016-11-11 08:27:03+00:00,d9vm8xi,3.0,t1_d9vlzmo,709.0,consulting

78,"""Strategy"" is one of those words that is just massively overused.  It gets attached to pretty much any business function - marketing strategy, IT strategy, operations, strategy, etc.  But when you look at it from a company's perspective - ""Firm A's Strategy"" - it clearly means one of two things: corporate strategy and business unit strategy.  This is the gist of ""strategy consulting"" as it was originaly defined.

Corporate strategy is all about competitive advantage, end-state aspirations and, capital allocation.  First, you decide the company you want to be, then you design a portfolio strategy to achieve that goal, and then you define the governance and policies to reinforce the goal.

Business unit strategy is all about understanding where a particular business unit's competitive advantage fits in the context of the market, and where it should go, in accordance to the corporate strategy.  First, you understand the different market/competitor tail and headwinds, then you understand the business unit's positioning and capabilities, and then you decide upon the ideal market positioning and investment needed.

You can read about how the firms view strategy on their websites as well:

In terms of where my own brain went, I'm a person who works best on paper (and without the distraction of my inbox and IM program).  I storyline on paper and I edit on paper.  In this particular case, as I was walking through my team's deck and found places where I didn't think the storyline / visuals flowed right, it was extremely helpful to have the templates right next to it.  It helped me visualize exactly how some of those frameworks would translate directly into the story.

Obviously I've done this plenty the old fashioned way on a computer.  But in addition to the email pings, I've always found it distracting to have to flip across several documents, one of which is bound to be a slow-loading image-laden file made slower by the 50 programs open on my computer.

159,"I see a lot of people have tried to define strategy consulting here - as someone who spends a large portion of time in strategy, let me give it a try also:

Strategy can be broken down into 2 parts: corporate strategy and business unit strategy.

Corporate strategy is all about competitive advantage, end-state aspirations and, capital allocation.  First, you decide the company you want to be, then you design a portfolio strategy to achieve that goal, and then you define the governance and policies to reinforce the goal.

Business unit strategy is all about understanding where a particular business unit's competitive advantage fits in the context of the market, and where it should go, in accordance to the corporate strategy.  First, you understand the different market/competitor tail and headwinds, then you understand the business unit's positioning and capabilities, and then you decide upon the ideal market positioning and investment needed.

A lot of the examples I've seen listed here - like cost reduction, pricing, supply chain, etc. - are not strategy *per se*.  These are actions taken to execute a strategy, but not a strategy itself.

You can read about how the firms view strategy on their websites as well:

- [McKinsey](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/how-we-help-clients)
- [BCG](http://www.bcg.com/en-co/expertise/capabilities/strategy/default.aspx)
- [Bain](http://www.bain.com/consulting-services/strategy/#2)

220,"In my mind, consulting is a business equally driven by smarts and relationships.  As such, I have no doubt that being a particular ethnicity - Asian, Black, Latino, etc. -  has clear impact on your career.  For Asians, let's also remember that we are &amp;amp;lt;6% of the population.  [Take a look at this map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Asian-census_density_map.png) of Asian geographic distribution... there are places in the states where our best representations are the sparse moments that we are on TV or in the movies.  This undoubtedly colors how people perceive and interact with us whether consciously or subconsciously.  Still, I will say that it's always hard to paint in broad strokes, but I will give it a shot anyway based on what I have seen.

**Considerations Within Our Control**

- Again, broad strokes here, but a common thread (at least in East Asian culture) are the Confucian ideas of obediance over individualism.  Unfortunately, that's not how the business world works in the US.  When we talk about leaders in the US, we think about people who are courageous, those who give impassioned speeches, and those who can make fast and firm decisions.  It's a bit counter to our own traditions and something to be aware of.  As such, I personally found the leadership classes I took in MBA to be some of my most valuable time spent in a classroom. 

- I think many of us are brought up to think that ""hard work / knowledge = success"" (another major Confucian theme)... and you can see the influence of that in a lot of comments in this thread even.  That said, I do believe this sentiment to be true at the Analyst and Consultant level - even at the Manager level.  You can totally get by being the untiring, sharpest guy in the room who can crank Excel and Powerpoint faster than everyone else.  But anecdotally speaking, there are some downsides to this:

a) I think this focus on working hard leads to Asians getting ""burnt out"" more often than others.  Somehow calls to ""work smarter"" just end up being ""work smarter *and* harder"".  It's important to recognize that and strive for a good work/life balance.  Here's also a great article about why simply working yourself to death just doesn't make sense: [How some men fake a 80 hour workweek](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/upshot/how-some-men-fake-an-80-hour-workweek-and-why-it-matters.html?_r=0).

b) We too easily pigeon-hole ourselves into being known as ""the numbers whiz"" or ""the rockstar analyst"".  Again, these are great tags to have at a junior level, but it can be hard to wean them off sufficiently to push to senior positions.  It's important to establish your abilities outside of the quantitative as quickly as possible.  The skills that make you a great Consultant are not the key skills that make you a great leader or executive. 

- This might be something more specific to immigrant families, but I think a lot of us had parents who never wanted to ""cause trouble"".  People in my life have had their houses and stores robbed and never called the police, ignore strangers in obvious need of help... basically any sort of confrontation.  For me at least, I've felt like it led to a distinct lack of ability to enter uncomfortable situations or engage in disagreements.  It's something that I, and many of my friends, have talked about working through.  There are a whole host of other concerns that are more immigrant / socioeconomic specific and I think there are a few threads on here that talk about that also.

**Considerations Outside Our Control**

- We're often called the model minority - we're consistently thought of as being smart, hardworking, and analytical.  Obviously these are good things.  On the other hand, we're also stereotyped as quiet, passive, or weak.  I find it important to actively try to counteract these perceptions - no need to go crazy, but make sure to show contrary evidence when it is possible and makes sense.

- Going back to the differences at senior levels, I did a quick [back-of-the-evenlope analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/3sfn4u/diversity_at_the_partner_level_and_up/cwxg347) that showed even at a diverse firm like McKinsey in a very diverse geography (West Coast), there is a distinct lack of Asian leadership.  In that case and in my own experiences, the percent of Asians in start classes versus the percent of Asians in Partnership roles is night and day.  Given that Partnership is often based on sales, my guess is that it's a reflection of the US business landscape - after all, most CEOs are older white males, and without prejudice, you connect better with those like you.  My own opinion here, is that it helps to gravitate towards work where Asians have a stronger presence.  All the Asian Partners that I know (and there are sadly few) are primarily in areas like Tech and Healthcare... I honestly can't think of any in industries like oil and gas or retail.

b) Senior Manager / Partner - often move into portfolio roles where they manage companies to strategic goals.

McKinsey, the largest management consulting firm, employs ~20,000 employees globally.  By contrast, there are nearly 4 million teachers in this country alone.

Corporations hire consultants knowing they will impact millions, if not billions of dollars.  As such, they want only the best and the brightest and they are willing to pay a premium for it.  Consultants, also realizing how much dollars they are impacting for the company, are in their rights to demand a high salary.  Most teachers on the other hand, cannot point to a credible financial impact.

You can think about increasing teacher pay, but where would the money come from?  The majority of people will be in public schools, which are funded by the government.  Now, there is certainly an upper crust that is financed by the elite and that reflects onto their salaries.

273,"This article provides some good structure for thinking about how consulting fits within the longer term.

&gt;It starts with three principles: be real, be whole, and be innovative.

&gt; To be real is to act with authenticity by clarifying what’s important to you. It’s your answer to this basic question: What matters most to me? What do I truly value? Is it family? A creative pursuit? Spiritual growth?

&gt; To be whole is to act with integrity by recognizing how the different parts of your life affect each other. This means identifying who matters most to you at work, at home, and in the community; understanding what you need from others, and what you have to give others; and seeing whether and how these needs mesh.

&gt; To be innovative is to act creatively by experimenting with how things get done in ways that are good for you and for the people around you—taking realistic steps aimed at scoring four-way wins; at work, at home, in your community, and for yourself.

&gt; Since each of us faces a unique set of challenges and has different priorities in our lives, the essential first step is to figure out what matters most to you. Once you know what’s important, then you can begin to engage your stakeholders — at work and outside of work — to gain a better appreciation for what you each need and expect of each other. With this knowledge, you can begin to experiment with new ways of getting things done in order to reduce stress and the strain that results from conflict between work and the rest of life. This might involve exploring a new job, learning to play a musical instrument, devoting time to daily reflection about your values and purpose, sharing your vision of the future with friends and co-workers and letting them know how and why they’re part of it, reliably committing time (even small amounts) to your children so they can count on it, doing a digital detox (time off screens) regularly, or bringing your friends and work associates together for an activity they’d all enjoy. Actions like these can help you to create value in each of the important parts of your life.",2016-10-10 00:30:53+00:00,d8l5vwg,1.0,t3_56p7d5,123.0,consulting

I still remember early in college or my career, things like getting laughed at for wearing white socks with black shoes, or for holding a wine glass incorrectly, or for wearing 'cheap' clothing.  Those situations sting and they understandably leave an outsized impression on your mind.

I would say a few things things:

- Mindset: I know there can be a mindset that says, ""I don't belong here"" or ""I'm not good enough""... well ignore it.  You end up where you are because you are good enough, so embrace it.

- Learning: Yes, you will probably get dinged for not knowing things that others consider common sense, but once you realize the issue, you can fix it.  If you're still in college, I encourage you to try to explore new things, even if it makes you uncomfortable.  Staying in a 'safety zone' will not do you any favors when you go to work in the real world.  Also, I don't see any issue with addressing it head on.  In regards to the wine thing, when I cupped my glass instead of holding it by the stem, I just bluntly told them, ""I've never really seen anyone drink wine before"" and that led to me sharing a little more about myself with the team, which I thought ended up being a nice moment and increased understanding.

- Interests:  I am sure you would have interests with CEOs or anyone else because they're people too.  I've known executives who are passionate about everything from hiking to video games to politics - you just need to figure out what it is.  And worst case, the news is always relevant, and that's something anyone can pick up.  Yes, there will be a gap when it comes to certain things, but if you have connections elsewhere, you needn't worry about that.

Researcher's goals:

We outline suggestions for diagnosing organizational career cultures through a process of
identifying and interpreting career signals. We discuss the real and potentially paralyzing
situation of mixed career signals, whereby a person can “feel stuck” between conflicting career
messages. We suggest how mixed signals can be discerned and resolved, as well as how
organizations can leverage the power of career cultures for talent attraction, retention, and
development.

Quick summary:

- You need to consider the culture inherent in different types of jobs
- There are four archetypes for culture: prestige, apprenticeship, protean, and merit, though any company will be a mix
- Consulting is more heavily oriented towards apprenticeship

360,"I think a lot of good points have been made, but I do think the importance of recruiting-related prestige is exaggerated - and this is coming from someone who is very passionate about the process.  Perhaps this is because many of the posters seem like candidates or junior employees, but I think that market success is much more about our clients' perceptions than anything else. I've done a few internal ""competitive landscape"" projects so I've thought about this topic quite a bit. 

I would posit that the future of the firms can be defined by the impact of their scale on relationships, client satisfaction, and prestige.  If I were to take stock of management consulting *today*, there's no doubt in my mind that MBB is ahead of its competitors in the US.  New entrants might take market share as they increase focus on the industry, but there are some real barriers to entry. 

Consulting is a relationship business - at this point, pretty much every large company has worked with a consultancy.  For a long time, MBB were the dominant players, meaning that strong relationships have been established throughout these organizations.  Furthermore, MBB has had a much longer runway and a much larger scale for for throwing alumni into key positions within major organizations.  These people are likely to preference their old firms all else equal.  So long as the firms continue to do a good job at the clients they serve, there is little reason to switch consultancies.  For my firm, the vast, vast majority of revenue comes from longstanding client relationships.  This is a major barrier for firms trying to break into the C-suite and will likely continue to be.

Client satisfaction is obviously a very complex subject but critical.  From a high-level, client satisfaction is driven by a combination of knowledge and capabilities (to get the right answer) and alignment with changing client needs.  From a knowledge standpoint, the largest firms have significant scale benefits - McKinsey, by virtue of its size, has the expertise advantage in most cross-sections of industry, function, and geography.  I don't know how big S&amp;O is (actually very curious about this if someone has insight), but I've seen estimates of around 2,500-3,000.  Given that, it still has some room to go before it can even match the ~6,000 of Bain.  

From a capabilities standpoint, again the larger firms have had years to develop tools and processes that facilitate management consulting.  Whether its basic efficiency improvements like slide production to advanced solutions like the McKinsey Organizational Health Index or Bain's PEG system, these firms have greater resources to deliver client satisfaction.  That being said, of all the factors, this is likely the most replicable.

Alignment with client needs is perhaps the trickiest and hardest to assess as our industry certainly is changing.  And you can see all of the firms placing their bets on this - just a few examples include Bain's Results Delivery, BCG Digital Ventures, McKinsey Solutions, Deloitte Digital.  They all seem like the right plays to me, but I've no idea what will stick and what won't.  Personally, I think the implementation coaching plays are the right ones - the digital and analytic plays seem a bit du jour and I am almost certain within 5-10 years, they will become table stakes as opposed to real practice areas.  Implementation however, will always be around.  That said, MBBs run a risk of brand dilution and margin erosion however, since process and PMO is definitely not their strong suit.  I've had occasion to work with Accenture on a few projects, and the way they run processes is like clockwork relative to us.  I would fear a future in which we have a significant number of people doing PMO-work as opposed to the high-touch model that is employed now.

Prestige is perhaps the gating factor in all of this.  MBB has been around long enough to benefit from the Matthew effect and the newer phenomenon of ""you don't fired for hiring IBM"".  When the Pope is looking for advice or a F50 is looking to undergo a major transformation, they will hire MBB because failure is unacceptable.  Into the future, similarly high profile projects will go to MBB because that's what the Pope and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia did.  And so on.  Without a meaningful price differential, I think most executives would preference MBB to others because of the advantages we bring as detailed above and the perception factor.

To come back to the recruiting piece, yes, we care a lot about getting the right people in the door.  But let's be honest - anyone who has been through recruiting a top school knows that a majority of the people who got offers at one place may have gotten it at another if they had a different interviewer, different case, different tie, whatever.  Influx of talent isn't really an issue.  Much more so than recruiting, is the importance of *retention*.  In the face of attractive offers in terms of compensation and lifestyle around every corner, the turnover is rising every year - and when we lose people, it hurts.  The benefit of potential new projects is quite outweighed by the loss of investment, knowledge, and client relationships.  That's why you see firms so heavily focused on this.  They're all trying different things, but I'm certain they will get retention right - because they have to.  When I first started, no one was talking about work/life balance, there was no ""Predictability, Teaming, and and Open Communication"" or ""Take Two"" type initiatives.  It's quite different now.

In 10 years, I think McKinsey and BCG stay major players - their scale at least buys them that.  I see a future where Bain also continues on as a major player, but I also see one where they are squeezed out due to an increasingly crowded market.  Deloitte is obviously here to stay, barring any sort of regulatory issues between audit and advisory.  I think the world is also headed towards risk-based contracting, and this also benefits larger entities like Deloitte or PWC who can really afford to back their own plays if they choose to invest so.  That being said, the other complicating issue I think of is where the money is growing - while Deloitte and PWC double down on the US, the other firms are growing like crazy in other geographies.  Could this more than sustain increased competition in the states?  So many questions.  This is why we don't do 10 year strategies :)

366,"Well, I'm not too familiar about ERP implementation consulting, so I'll answer more generally.  Hopefully you get some more direct answers.

1.  Stress is common in consulting and will often get worse, though in different ways.  Is this a first job?  If so, I would say it may just take some adjusting to.  In regards to not being able to contribute much - you just started, it's normal.  You are literally 2 months into a 40-50 year period of professional life.  Take it easy.

2.  PMO jobs are never sexy, but still teach invaluable skills.  It's a great place for you to practice ways of motivating and persuading people to do things that they may not want to do.  And frankly, the interpersonal skills become more and more important the higher up you rise.  In regards to changing projects, I'm not sure about ERP consulting, but in MC, the more experience you get, the more able you are to control your projects.

3.  Travel is travel.  It's kind of the hallmark of consulting.  If you want, I can share some tips on how to stay local, but still, you should expect to travel, and likely more so the more senior you get.

394,"I suppose you could see it that way.  But from someone who went to MBA, knows a lot of MBAs, and does a lot of MBA recruiting, you may be right from a language point of view, but not so from a colloquial point of view.  It doesn't really matter - Booth is definitely a top school.

In regards to grade non-disclosure, fact of the matter remains that 7 out of the top 10 MBAs have grade non-disclosure, while none of the schools in the 20-50 positions have it.  It's definitely a complex subject, so don't take my word for it.  Here's a Freakonomics article detailing the research of some Wharton professors on the phenomenon: http://freakonomics.com/2011/10/12/why-do-only-top-mba-programs-practice-grade-non-disclosure/",2016-09-16 06:41:51+00:00,d7oxuj5,12.0,t1_d7oxq8m,348.0,consulting

Also, Booth is far from a second tier school.  Granted it's not Harvard / Stanford / Wharton, but it's pretty close having been top 1-3 in the last few US news polls.  It's also a heavy MBB target.

There is huge motivation for students at top-tier schools to implement non-disclosure, and in fact, it is the lower-tier schools that aren't able to.  It lets them focus more on learning what they want without the risk of impairing their value to employers due to low grades.",2016-09-16 06:30:00+00:00,d7oxlln,10.0,t1_d7oxds0,620.0,consulting

407,"I find this to be a consequence of the people you work with.  An MBB (and most firms really) are huge places - as such, there are people who are wonderful to work with and there are people who are assholes.  I've been on teams with both personalities and it's easy to see how a person's perspective of a firm (or consulting in general) can be colored by such interactions.  

However, interacting with both types (and every type in between) is an unavoidable reality of *any* organization, whether its a high school, a F500 company, or a consulting firm.  And to be fair, consulting does attract an outsized share of Type A personalities, so we probably do overindex relative to a typical company.  But ultimately, I think most people are indeed *good people* and simply working in consulting won't change that.

As such, I often tell junior people that it is well worth it to work with as many people as possible.  Find the people you fit with best and stay with them.  Personally, I look up to the Partner I work with in many ways, but foremost is that she treats everyone graciously and with respect.  And I'd like to think that all the teams I work with think the same of me.

437,"Ignoring age, if you make Partner, you are in the million range - that's just a fact at my firm and many others.  And, enough make it that no one is surprised to meet one.

As I keep telling you and have mentioned elsewhere, your exit salary depends on many factors.  Industry is a major one.  Someone focused on tech would see all-in compensation in the ~$250K range even as a Senior Consultant, with the numbers rapidly increasing with tenure.  Those who receive equity may have the chance to attain significantly greater numbers.  That said, would someone in retail, fashion, or consumer goods be able to attain something similar?  Most likely not.  On the other hand, unsexy industries often pay the most.  One of the best exits I've ever seen was a Manager who left for the energy sector at $500K.  Role is another one - common landing places for major consulting firm alumni are within strategy, business development, or corporate finance - all of which see better compensation relative to other groups like procurement, IT, or HR.  

I find it exceedingly hard to believe someone in the backoffice of a bank would be making $200-$250K, or even if they were, that they achieved it ""easily"".  Do you have any proof of that?

I do agree attaining a $500K job is far from a guarantee.  But I believe that coming from a major consultancy significantly increases a person's chance of attaining it it relative to someone who just starts in industry.  I also don't agree that people ""regularly stagnate"" - just flipping through our alumni directory shows impressive title after impressive title.  The top consultancies didn't get to their existing levels of prestige and desirability with smoke and mirrors.  Maybe you'll change your and maybe you won't, but I do think I've shared all I can on this topic.

Based on our conversation - and I don't mean any offense by this nor am I attacking your character - but my personal opinion is that you simply aren't familiar enough about the major consultancies to make the claims that you do.

446,"&gt;  Seems far too good to be true. $250K at age 25 -- I mean come on, how likely is that?

$250K at 25 is indeed less common.  I'm not sure why you keep harping on this issue, as when I have noted this, I highlight it is only for the rockstars who skip MBA.  In general, in all of my posts, I try to anchor on tenure relative to UG or MBA.  At the MBA level there is too wide a range of ages to talk about it that way.  But again, going back to your $250K salary:

a) A rock star who starts at MBB and who skips MBA would likely be at that point. 

b) More likely is someone who does 2 years Analyst, 2 years MBA, 2 years to Manager - so you'd be ~27 making $250K.  In this case, MBA is paid for as well.

c) If you're entering FROM MBA, then the age increases a little more.  [Average age at Harvard on entry is 27], so the average graduate is ~28.5.  Again, tack on the 2-3 years to Manager, and you'd be in the range at 30-31.

&gt; Chances are, the McK guy will get up-or-outed in a couple of years.

Again, the people who willingly exit MBB is significantly - literally orders of magnitude - higher than those who stay.  I directly said this to you as well in the DM that you first sent to me.  Why do you think we're doing so much in terms of benefits?  Every year salaries get higher - the starting Consultant salary is now almost $15K higher than mine just a few years ago.  Every year, there are more and more benefits - did you read the article on Deloitte giving 4 paid months off for caretaking?  Or the fact that many consultancies don't even require matching on 401K?  Doctors don't get any of that.  Furthermore, every year, firms are increasingly implementing - and enforcing - ways to decrease hours and improve work-life, whether it's McKinsey smart travel, BCG predictability program, or others.  No, our problem is not that we willingly chop off a large population every year because they can't cut it... our problem is with *retention* because our people keep getting poached by extremely attractive propositions in industry.

&gt;a doctor has long-term job security. Chances are, the McK guy will get up-or-outed in a couple of years. If they were an MBA hire, they're probably now age 33-34 and not even back to zero net worth because of student loans. I wouldn't say that's a particularly enviable position.

The one thing I will note is that even if you do exit out to a Senior Director role (which is common for Managers), you yourself mention you'd be around $250K - the same range as that for an average doctor.... who by the way, has *significantly* more student loans.  And when it comes to job security?  There are businesses *everywhere*... a person from MBB is almost guaranteed to have a good job waiting for them.  So frankly, I think job security is pretty even.

&gt;I've utilized LinkedIn and Glassdoor. I've seen the actual average cases, and even above average cases. McKinsey APs who never make Partner, and take $250K Senior Director roles at mid-sized companies. People who burn out / leave after 18 months and go into a Senior Analyst role at an F500. McKinsey EMs who take on $100-150K manager jobs after either burning out or being counseled out (obviously, no way to tell which on LinkedIn). This is not hard to find.

This is entirely anecdotal, speculative, and a small sample set.  I think I've already spoken to this, so I'll just leave it at that.  

And by the way, in my response to your DM, I thought I was pretty fair in painting the picture of consulting compensation, mobility, and potential, in fact, I started off reaffirming that most people leave in 3 years:

&gt; You: I've heard that the average post-MBA career in consulting is about 3 years. Is this true? What do people exit out to at this level? Does progression slow significantly once you exit out into a large corporate? Approximately how many Directors / VPs are there making $500K+ at a large corporate?

&gt;Me: Yes - people often hit Manager and leave. Exit opps are pretty similar to what is in the wiki, minus the PE/VC/HF roles. $500K after 2-3 years? Exceedingly unlikely. Comp at that exit will depend on industry... generally $200-$300K, with the higher end being tech companies and the lower end being consumer companies.  Manager exit out into Director / Senior Director roles, Senior Managers exit out into Senior Director / VP roles. Partners exit out into VP / SVP roles.",2016-09-10 16:53:42+00:00,d7h3rdk,13.0,t1_d7h3424,995.0,consulting

448,"Regarding the Senior Manager, look at the flip side... you won't find that kind of ratio anywhere else with that kind of speed.  So yes, relatively speaking, those are great odds.

Again, the salary thing isn't something we need to talk about anecdotally.  [Here's probably the biggest survey on physician compensation](http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/compensation/2016/public/overview?src=wnl_physrep_160401_mscpedit&amp;uac=232148CZ&amp;impID=1045700&amp;faf=1#page=5).  It says that in New York (state) the average physician salary is $263K.  Let's keep in mind that this number is slightly inflated due to the private practice doctors who have to pay malpractice premiums and purchase their own benefits.  [For instance, a private practice neurosurgeon in NY might make a lot of money, but she's also paying $331K for malpractice alone](http://truecostofhealthcare.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NewYorkMediMalRates.pdf).  And very importantly, this average physician salary include ALL doctors INCLUDING the ones with decades of experience and years of compounded salary growth. 

By contrast, [an EM at McKinsey makes ~$250K](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/McKinsey-and-Company-Engagement-Manager-Salaries-E2893_D_KO21,39.htm) - this is generally 2-3 years out of school; [an AP makes $400K](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/McKinsey-and-Company-Associate-Principal-Salaries-E2893_D_KO21,40.htm).  So you would probably expect to make $300K in 3-4 years at McKinsey.  Given that average tenure is 3 years (and in fact, over 4 once you exclude the Analysts who generally leave after 2 years), I would say a *majority* of MBB consultants break $300K.

As a result, I would absolutely not agree that a salary of a doctor in NY would be higher than that of a MBB consultant in NY.  The median for the whole spectrum of doctors is pretty much on par with that of a Consultant who has only been at MBB for 2-3 years.  And if you wanted to make it a fair comparison by adjusting for age (given doctors' much longer education period) and add in MBB Partner compensation to the mix?  We'd blow it out of the water.

And again, there are many, many, other factors to consider if you are actually going to compare jobs.  [Consultancies are consistently ranked among the best places to work](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45fihi/2-mckinsey-co/#5fcab6567e17), [&gt;90% of people would recommend it to a friend](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/McKinsey-and-Company-Reviews-E2893.htm), and the benefits are fantastic.  

[Contrast this to doctors](http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/compensation/2016/public/overview#page=17) who overwhelmingly have satisfaction rates around 50% - in fact, *40%* actually said they would NOT want to be a doctor again if they had the choice.  That is crazy and is the picture of an industry in dire straits.  And it isn't even compensation related - physicians in the highly coveted and highly paid ""ROADS"" fields are actually the ones least likely to want to do medicine again.  By contrast, the ones who get paid the least (family doctors, internalists, pediatricians) are all in the top 8.  But frankly, with more and more regulations coming from the ACA on compensation and medical costs?  I guarantee these numbers will be even more down next year.

&gt; I would argue that even in a mid-size tech company, the hierarchy is still pyramid-shaped. VP spots &lt; Director spots &lt; Manager spots &lt; Analyst spots. Getting promoted extremely rapidly isn't at all guaranteed, and is probably determined more by luck and politics than anything else.

I picked on mid-size tech because people move in and out extremely quickly.  And this is anecdotal, but speaks to your exit opportunities question; from when I was a late-tenured Manager to today as a newly tenured Senior Manager, I get about 25% Director, 50% Senior Director, 25% VP opportunities through headhunters at mid-sized tech companies.

&gt; I think you are a bit too bullish on consultants' exit opportunities in the future. You focus too much on the superstars / edge cases and automatically assume that everyone will / can be one of them.

I don't think so.  At MBB people pretty much everyone exits out into excellent positions that in desirable companies, desirable groups, and high-level positions - the firm makes sure that happens.  I have reams and reams of goodbye emails from people over the years that prove it beyond a doubt.",2016-09-10 15:57:35+00:00,d7h1kda,11.0,t1_d7gzxr4,2607.0,consulting

450,"&gt; Exactly, I feel like consulting companies make a few recommendations and then turn around and say ""this will save $X, but our fees are $Y: that's less than $X, so therefore we generated value."" But in reality, those recommendations still need to be implemented, and a good chunk of the time, they aren't ever even used. I bet a lot of projects just sit on a shelf somewhere.

Are you just basing this on stereotypes you have heard about consulting?  Because it's oft repeated and simply not true.  At my firm, the vast majority of clients are longstanding continuous relationships we have had.  First, this indicates that they see the value that they bring, and second, it means that we are often there to *ensure* our recommendations become implemented.  You also see more and more firms codifying this part of the process through initiatives like McKinsey Implementation or Bain Results Delivery.  

&gt;  And even if it ends up getting implemented, the people who actually implemented the change that resulted in $X cost savings deserve the majority of the credit.

You are highlighting the difference between idea generation and implementation here.  You could argue the relative value of each, but there is no doubt both are equally important.  We generally play in the idea creation aspect and are essentially brainpower and knowledge for hire...  And frankly, as expensive as we are, that's cheaper than having your people implement the wrong plan.

Education

- waaaaaaay too much text and formatting needs to improve; look at some resumes in the resume books in the WIki
- SAT score?  If high, add it
- Any awards?

Professoinal

- I've heard of Deloitte, KPMG, EY, and PWC.  Save yourself the description line as the rest should come out in the bullets
- Bullets 1 and 4 are fine, though maybe try to tighten them up - for example, while I need the details of what you *did*, I don't necessarily need the detailed names of everything - (e.g., Increased the efficiency of client's reporting process by 60% by designing templates that converted raw data into insightful dashboards)
- Remove or explain any industry jargon - I have no idea what BlackLine is.  As an undergrad, your resume will be reviewed by undergrads who just graduated - they will likely also have no idea what it is.
- Third bullet should be action oriented

Professional 2

- First bullet is weak - ""analyze inputs and maintain data integrity"" doesn't tell me much
- Maybe expand more on the business case bullet

Extracurriculars

- Good bullets

Add an interest line - it helps with the small talk at the start and end of interviews

You have all the right ingredients, just need to tighten things up a bit here and there.  Best of luck.

I know it's easy to think something like this, but it's frankly not true.

I think to a certain extent the product that management consultant firms sell isn't their industry expertise... it's the pedigreed backgrounds of their employees. 

We sell both aspects of our people.  In fact, we don't look for the absolute smartest people - otherwise we'd be plumbing PhD programs and not MBAs.

I've post many articles on managing work/life balance, [actively talk about mitigating travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/4z6wz1/consultants_who_are_split_between_love_for_their/d6tbzgk), and even wrote [the top post on this forum which encourages recruits to question whether consulting would actually make them happy](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/419ovl/the_happiness_treadmill/).

Other responses:

&gt; I believe you even said that an ""average performer"" at MBB would be a Partner within 8-9 years.

I would never say that intentionally as that would be an outright lie.  An average performer would most likely be counseled out at Senior Manager.  Even in one of my responses to you, I made to sure to note this: ""The most common scenario though **(for one who stays)**, is a 25 year old post-MBA goes 2 year Consultant, 2 years Manager, 2 year Senior Manager, and hits Partner at 31""

&gt; You rarely talk about the fact that the majority of people only stay for 2-3 years

I disagree - I often talk about how people exit out in 2-3 years, the resultant exit opportunities, and even distinctly remember defending someone on here who wanted to leave very early in tenure.

&gt;then exit into middle management roles in companies where their progression will slow tremendously. 

I'm not sure why this needs to be mentioned - this is life post-consulting which, frankly, depends on industry.  You could exit into a mid-size tech company and get promoted extremely rapidly, or you could exit into a old school media firm and stay in the same role forever.  That's not something that is easy to comment on generally.  In fact, there's a common saying at my firm: ""You only get to leave consulting once.""  It implies that the biggest jump you ever make is indeed when you leave - not after.

&gt; You rarely talk about the people that want to make it to Partner but never even get close because of the vicious up-or-out system

The up-or-out isn't particularly vicious until Senior Manager, so most people who want to get to Partner do make it pretty close.  We hire people who clearly demonstrate the horsepower to do the required work of Consultants and Managers.  As a result, there are very few issues - otherwise, we would not have been doing recruiting the same way as we have for years.  The vast majority of people who leave do so voluntarily because other job offers are more attractive than the proposition of continuing on in the typical consulting lifestyle.  

&gt; I don't think most management consultants end up rich. 

I suppose it depends on your firm and your definition of rich.  If you're talking about pure dollars, then banking will beat out pretty much any other job for earning power (assuming you make it to MD, which is as hard as making it to Senior Partner in consulting).  But for the other fields, consulting more than holds its own.  In fact, it is very likely that you would make much more money as a successful consultant than you would as a doctor.  There's no need to rely on anecdotal data when public databases have all the numbers you'd need to see.  The [average doctor makes $200K-300K](http://www.profilesdatabase.com/resources/2013-2014-physician-salary-survey/) and this is after 4 years of medical school, 1-4 years of residency, and potentially more in fellowship.  Furthermore, growth in salaries is relatively low.  To reach the truly highly compensated specialties like neurological surgery, you need to not only attain a highly competitive position, but you also need significantly more training (+7 years of fellowship in this case) before you start to earn those dollars.  By contrast, an new MBB Consultant makes ~$180K and could make Senior Manager to earn $400K in 4 years - and if they make it to Partner, earning potential goes into the low millions.  The reason you felt the way you did is probably because there are many, many, many, many more doctors than there are consultants from major firms.

Finding Someone to Talk To


There are many ways to network into a consulting interview, so I will list them in order of most to least effective:

Friends



First, plumb your network for friends, or even friends of friends, who work at firms that you are interested in. This is the safest and most effective way to toe your foot into the door.



School Career Center



Check with your school's career center (even if you have already graduated) to see if there are any resources that they can provide you with. Some might have good guides, others might have sample resumes and cover letters. If you're really lucky, the Center might even be able to direct you to current consultants who can mentor you.



Alumni Network



LinkedIn Alumni is an amazing site to locate fellow alumni at specific firms. Use it to find and then connect with fellow alumni who are at firms you want to join. Leverage your shared background to increase your chances of successfully receiving a response. Ask them to share their experiences and give advice relevant to your situation.



Cold Call



Just connect with people who seem like they might be favorable to having a chat. You'd be surprised at how willing people will say yes. And, if they are busy, worst case scenario is they click 'delete' and forget about it entirely. Just being cordial and enthusiastic will help a lot.



HR



The last option is to connect with an office's HR department. Be warned that these people are completely inundated by requests for informational conversations. As such, this is probably one of the less effective means of networking with a firm.",2016-09-08 19:58:11+00:00,d7eniio,2.0,t1_d7ejqo5,4664.0,consulting

480,"There's no substitute for apprenticeship and hands-on experience.  But barring that, I think there's a few good ways to practice the different consulting toolsets.  

When it comes to solving business problems,  it is important to read as much as you can, whether its business periodicals, books, or company decks.  In the same way chess Grandmasters rely strongly on pattern recognition, it is the same in consulting.  Thousands of companies have launched new products, performed cost reductions, or did reorganizations - a great consultant can draw on a library of historically successful solutions and tailor to the client.

Tecnhnical skills are probably the easiest - there's tons of literature and tutorials out there for Powerpoint and Excel.  You may even wish to do something that interests you on the side - in the past, I've built Excel models for fantasy sports and video games for fun and practice.

Improving on interacting with others is probably the hardest to replicate on your own, since by nature it involves other people.  I'm not a great small-talker, but what's helped me is doing a lot of magazine reading, from low to high brow - you never know if your client is someone who'd rather talk about the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange (hey, I work in tech) or the ""2025 vision for Silicon Alley"" or the latest thinking in leadership.  The nice thing is that you can adjust your reading list based on who you interact with most. I've also heard a lot of praise for doing things like improv classes or Toastmaters, so that's something to look into as well.",2016-09-08 15:49:12+00:00,d7ebb6b,1.0,t3_51rjvo,5026.0,consulting

McKinsey now even lets Analysts skip the Associate level, which could speed their track even more.

In regards to your second question, being able to exit into managing positions early in your career is one of the major draws of consulting.  There's even cases of Consultants jumping right into very high management positions.  Obviously there's an interplay between level, organization size, and company prestige when you're looking at specifics.  For instance, mid-size companies have no problem hiring younger people in as SVPs or even C-suite, while larger companies may prefer to place the same person at VP.  On the other hand, a sexy company like Google may push that person to VP or Senior Director since they have so many options.",2016-09-06 16:37:01+00:00,d7bnllx,5.0,t1_d7bmhuy,1519.0,consulting

494,"One major piece you need to account for is organizational inertia.  If you start in management at a company, there's no clearly timebound path to the top since typical companies don't have up-or-out models.  I think we've all been at clients where the VP of so-and-so has been in their position for 10+ years.  And unless he/she decides to quit, that position will be filled until further notice.  Add on a healthy dose of internal politics, and this means that even the next-Don Draper would have a hard time moving up at a consistent pace.

Consulting, by contrast, offers you both an extremely fast progression path *and* option value.  A rock star at MBB could go from Consultant to Partner in 5-6 years.  An average performer (who stays) would be there in 6-8 years.  This is possible because the system forces it to be possible through up-or-out.  Either way, at that point, that individual would be looking at CEO-minus-one to CEO-minus-three roles.  Furthermore, they would have the option of choosing from a broad array of landing spots.  You would be hard pressed to find a career in a F500 that can compare.

501,"At the end of the day you are making the argument for a boutique firm versus a major firm.  It sounds like you had a bad experience at Bain, but like any large firm, it's a big place and many, many, many people have had positive experiences there.  Their consistently high rating on Vault and Glassdoor are testament to that.

I definitely do think there is value in a small firm - you get more responsibility quicker, you often develop a strong focus, and there's more flexibility and intimacy.  But to say that any of the majors are a ""bunch of somnolent careerists who don't get it"" is simply way off base.  The rest of this post isn't exactly directed to you so much as it is to highlight the value proposition of a large firm.  

a) Project Scale

When a major company has a major issue, they will hire a major firm.  Small firms will be hard pressed to find opportunity to work on meaningful engagements with companies like GE, Apple, or Disney.  If you want to work on projects that have industry-wide repercussions, you need to be at a large and established firm.

b) Resources

Major firms are structured to bring their scale against problems.  This enables consultants to develop a much richer set of solutions.  We have access to all the major databases and we have research teams focused on building knowledge.  But even beyond that - scale means you can find an expert on almost any given topic within your firm.  While this does result in an individual consultant doing less legwork of their own, why reinvent the wheel when you can feed off the foundational knowledge of seniors and then focus your energies on tailoring to the client?  And in some cases, the scale of large firms lets you add value in ways that small firms can't even fathom; for instance, McKinsey has a tear-down lab where clients can send competitor products and receive back the component list and bill of materials.  Deloitte has Deloitte Digital where they can take over a client's customer engagement needs.  BCG clients can tap into their venture capital network to help clients fill capability gaps quickly.  And so on.

c) Exploration of industries / functions

You mention in your post that you would have never had the opportunity to work across multiple industries or functions - this is perhaps the statement that confuses me the most.  Doing this is the *hallmark* of working in a major consulting firm.  In my Analyst years I worked in dozens of industries at all levels of companies, from whiteboarding strategy with tech CEOs to training QSR line workers.  And this isn't a unique experience - most firms want their Analysts to build a broad base of experience.  If anything, small consulting firms would be challenged to offer the same, given they have a much less robust pipeline or tend to focus on niches.

d) Responsibilities

Contrary to what you mentioned, I tend to think that consulting is like a hot dog eating contest where the grand prize is more hot dogs.  There's so much work to be done and so many ways to overdeliver that those who prove themselves get more and more responsibility.  When I find someone who excels, I try to hang on to them as long as possible and give them as much as possible because that's less on my own plate.  I've had Analysts pretty much catch up to me in level as a result.  And to directly address your point above, while Juniors may not run full transformation programs, having one run several $50M workstreams as part of a large transformation is pretty standard fare.  

e) Training / apprenticeship

Major consulting firms have entire teams dedicated to training practitioners both from a functional and a knowledge perspective.  Furthermore, this material is refined from collective decades of experience and is continuously updated as the world changes.  The amount of material we have sitting on our knowledge exchange is incredible and lets you get up to speed on clients and industries over just a weekend.  Furthermore, there is significant value in the apprenticeship model - I've been with my firm for nearly a decade and I'm still consistently learning from more experienced consultants.  Could I have gotten to where I am now without them?  Maybe, maybe not.  But I'm certain I would have made a ton more mistakes along the way.

f) Finding your crowd

In a larger firm, you have a greater chance of finding a crowd where you fit - I've had the opportunity to work with many different Partners in my chosen sector before finding one that really clicked.  I could imagine at a smaller firm, it would be much more difficult to do this.

g) Exit opportunities

The most prestigious exit opps (e.g., private equity, top F50s, bigtech) prefer their consultants with prestigious backgrounds.  Furthermore, as more and more consultants enter corporate, it's more and more likely that they favor those who come from their background.

h) Support

Major consultancies know their people are the most valuable part of their business - and so, they try to take away all distractions.  Many firms have teams that make slides, travel agents on call, secretaries for Managers and above, etc.  Elimination of these annoying little things just enables consultants to focus on the client problem at hand.

i) Consulting versus consultancy operations

I would also note that several of your points focus on the *running* of a consulting firm (e.g., hiring decisions, building practices).  And I totally agree that a smaller firm would give you such opportunities - but I would also counter that these have less to do with being a consultant than they do with being a business owner.  If you want to build *consulting skills*, a large firm lets you focus on doing so until late into tenure.  If you want to develop a skillset for running small businesses, it may be more worthwhile to focus on it through a startup or mid-size company would be a better use of time.

509,"Generally speaking, when it comes to project/travel control there are basically three levers: team, location, industry/function. A few nuances:

a) Your firm has an impact on this. For example, Bain is somewhat more locally focused while McKinsey is somewhat more globally focused. If you work at a small firm, you may be entirely beholden to what projects end up being sold.

b) Location and industry interplay. If you live in DC and want to only do Tech, then you will probably be traveling a lot. That said, if you live in Houston and want to do Oil and Gas, you probably get to sleep in your own bed.

c) At my firm, I feel like there's an equal mix of consultants who prefer one of the three levers. Slight outliers are the younger people like to travel and stick to a team they enjoying working with and the parents who want to stay local.

d) Seniority matters. From the entry level to the Manager level, you can do pretty much whatever. Once you get to the level right below Partner, things can end up being very hectic in terms of hours, travel, everything. You can try to control for it, but as your firm demands more and more from you, it becomes difficult to turn down opportunities as they pop up.  There are some unicorns who ended up with a client base all in a geographic area, but even then, they may all still be Amtrak rides away from one another.

e) At the end of the day, expect to travel - its kind of the hallmark of consulting. Even my financial services colleagues in NYC will be on at least one travel project a year which comes out to about 2-3 months. This is not including flying to visit a random manufacturing plant or to retail store in Podunk, Nowheresville as part of a project.

Slides

Before opening PowerPoint, write the storyline on paper or in an outline format in a word doc. The goal is to be quick and lay out the story, not make slides

After writing the storyline but before opening PowerPoint, write the leads/taglines for each slide on paper - make sure each slide has a 'so what' and not just data

After writing the storyline and leads/taglines, but before opening PowerPoint, draw out your slide deck on paper

After drawing your slide deck on paper but before opening PowerPoint, review it with your Manager

Also, obtain decks from your Manager / Partner at the start of the project so you can get a feel for their preferred style of storytelling.",2016-08-31 02:48:08+00:00,d73il0x,1.0,t3_50d6gj,23561.0,consulting

College

- Decent GPA
- SAT?
- Any honors?

Professional

- Conducted research doesn't really tell me about what you did... did you interview 10,000 customers?  Or did you do a Google Search... would rather something like ""Identified ideal locations for firm expansion by doing...""
- Compiled data set sounds too low level
- Need to rework your bullets to tell a better story
- ""projects beneficial to the dean"" is so vague

Leadership

- ""Enhanced application process"".. again, entirely unclear on what you did
- ""Pioneered a new system""... ""maximize member involvement""... both vague... how do you measure ""member involvement""?
- Would rather your third bullet be first and expand upon what your group actually did... ""programs attended by over...""

Add interests line

-------------

My main recommendation to you is to focus on giving clear examples of the transferrable skills that would make you a good consultant.  Literally take each bullet and compare it against either the small list I have on the wiki or the ""what we look for"" factors on the firm's website and see how it stacks up.

Take this bullet for example:

- Compiled dataset of over 3000 employees within the region to a report for use by head advisory partner 

Here's McKinsey's criteria:

- Personal Impact
- Entrepreneurial Drive
- Problem Solving
- Leadership

Here are the tips that I can give you for staying local:

a) Move to a place where there is a significant number of local or local-ish projects - it seems obvious, but still needs to be stated.  If you live in Montana, you will need to travel.  If you live in SF or NY, then you increase the likelihood that you won't.  Even if you can't be truly local, having a regional concentration of projects can at least enable creative travel, like going back home on Tuesday nights.

b) Understand that there are several levers for staffing (industry, function, client, team, location, responsibility).  Understand that if you control for one (location) you must be flexible with the rest.  My own background is background is in west coast bleeding edge consumer tech, but since having moved to NY, I've had to shift much more towards working on digitization for big old companies.  So it goes.

c) build your network with people / Partners who are established at local clients - the best projects can often be taken by the time the staffing announcements roll out, so its best to get that feed directly from the source

d) invest in developing capabilities that are useful for your locality.  Maybe you decide you want to do NYC fintech.  Well, its unlikely that will work out on Day 1.  You should still seek out these opportunities if they exist elsewhere so that you become comparatively more valuable the next time a local project of that sort appears

e) if you're considering consulting for a career, do this as early as possible. As someone who did not and am now mid-tenure, it has been a challenge to rebuild a new base of champions and clients while maintaining existing professional relationships.

From that lense, I would tell you to focus on an industry as soon as you can, and then rotate through the most important parts of a business.  This should give you a basic understanding of how individual components of a business works, and more importantly, how it all works together (or sometimes against each other).

There may also be value in working bottom up; that is from service operations up to corporate strategy.  The most critical areas to hit (in my opinion) are: 

- sales
- service operations
- marketing
- financial planning
- HR / org design
- corporate strategy
- critical industry specific areas (e.g., product management for tech, engineering for industrials, R&amp;amp;D for pharma)

Someone in my start class did something very similar - he left right after hitting Manager to do a search fund; he ended up buying a mid-size company and seems to be quite successful.  I can see this also having value if you join an established startup.

Great

&gt; lack of leadership positions / extracurriculars

Major drawback

&gt; Lack of business certifications/internship ( I do read up on business and investing but have no certifications to back me up)

Not very important to have on paper, but needed for interviews

&gt;I'm contemplating going for CFA level 1 this December, more for personal interest. Would it be helpful at all?

It would help just like any other positive thing would, but it would be far, far, far from a positive ROI.

=============================

Overall, you are missing a key ingredient - leadership experience.  MBBs have the luxury of picking from a very deep pool of people, so flaws tend to be magnified.  If there's one thing you can do to improve your resume at this point, it is to attain a leadership position.

Summer internship wise, anything business related will be good.  Top corporate brands with known internship programs (e.g., Amex, Google, banks) carry solid weight, while on the other end of the scale, meaty positions at startups also help.

Best of luck.

What happens next is that, if the consultants are brought back, is that they will take their recommendation and pitch it to ALL the relevant stakeholders.  Invariably a refinement/negotiation period comes due to some mixture of:

a) consultants not having insider knowledge

b) internal politics

c) timing / cost

Likely where they'll end up is somewhere in between OP's plan and the consultant's recommendation.  So, it's silly to be thinking of accepting 'surrender' or being 'outflanked'.  Ideally, they'll end up in a place that benefits the company even more than each individually.

870,"Some of Ravi's solid advice for any new starters:

I think the first is that they check their ego at the door. Yes, you’re smart and accomplished and have a well-regarded MBA. But don’t assume you know the answer to everything because you probably haven’t done strategy consulting before.

Second is that you are actively listening: understanding exactly what it is the client is looking for. Listen to what your engagement manager or engagement partner is seeking for you to do and clarifying if you’re not sure. Just very basic things, but not running off to do things without actively listening to what it is you’re being asked to do.

The third is just, ‘Hey, I need some help. I need some training. I need to learn this tool.’ You’re going to have to do some extra homework to get up to speed on something that might be related to big data or a nuance (or details) of how an industry really works. You’re going to have to do some reading at night or some extra homework to get up to speed because the client expects our MBAs, since they’re well-paid, to bring something to the table that is relevant to the project and not just be talking about theoretical stuff they learned in business school…People are very willing to help here, but you have to ask for that help.

The last part I would say is being humble and willing to roll up your sleeves and just get into the nitty-gritty. In your first project, you may not be advising the CEO on the biggest corporate strategy decision of their life. You might be doing something more mundane. But we’re testing to see if you can do that before you go to some of those other projects. So it is important to have a view towards the long-term, which is, ‘I’m going to learn all these different things — different industries and different functions and build my strengths and skills in strategy consulting and then I’m going to have more opportunity to come to those CEO and board meetings.’",2016-07-14 15:22:58+00:00,d5c162f,1.0,t3_4stmci,2087.0,consulting

It's not ""people like /u/jackstack1"" who will think you can't take the heat... it's pretty much *everyone* in a business-field.

On a related note, you're a new professional - while it's great that you were at MBB, you're still entirely replaceable in the eyes of pretty much any organization.  No one is going to try to do the due diligence to understand your underlying reasons for leaving MBB early.

I'd say in general, people in this thread have given you the best advice.

BCG has a regional staffing model. Bain has a pyramid model of employees (Analysts &gt; Consultants &gt; Managers, etc.), while McKinsey has more of a diamond model (Analysts &lt; Consultants &gt; Managers, etc.). These creates a foundation for structure (and stereotype).

But an important second factor is the culture that is contributed by the specific office. And I would attribute that to the people and location; just these two things can account for huge differences even at the same firm. Bain Chicago is going to be markedly different from Bain San Francisco given the types of people who self-select for project work. McKinsey NYC is going to be markedly different from McKinsey Stamford even though they are an hour from one another because of the office size. BCG today could be different from BCG two years ago because the guy who used to love throwing together weekend activities left for another job. Even the Head of Office makes a huge difference. Years ago, the rule for my office was business casual on Fridays. Then, they allowed jeans, and the whole culture shifted.

My recommendation is understand the structures that make the firms different from one another, and then try to engage people from the specific offices as much as possible. Don’t compare “Bain versus McKinsey versus BCG”. Compare “Bain Boston versus McKinsey Boston versus BCG Boston”.",2016-07-12 05:36:27+00:00,d58vq8y,2.0,t1_d58rt0j,7937.0,consulting

In much smaller periods (say, up to 3 months), this certainly exists.  McKinsey has Take Time, BCG has PTO / Time For You, and Bain has Take Two.  As far as I know, all of these are unpaid, but benefits are maintained.  I'd say at any level except Senior Manager, it'd generally not a problem to take advantage of these programs.  Sometimes, when people really need the extra flexibility they may take temporary internal roles (research manager, recruiting lead, etc.).

896,"In general, you'll have access to the same pool of jobs you did when you were still in school.  Positions that are 'one-level-up' will be filled by the Analysts of the class ahead of you.  At worst, recruiters who have nothing to go by except your resume may not give you the benefit of the doubt (is he/she leaving because it is not a right fit?  Or is he/she leaving because they can't cut it?).

I wouldn't worry about burning bridges... people come and people go at consulting firms; no one is a special snowflake, least of all an Analyst.  Burning bridges is much more about how you leave than why.

My advice is to suck it up for a year - you only have 8 months to go.  This way, no questions are raised about you going forward, and you have access to a wider recruiting pool.

I also wonder if you are just overwhelmed if this is your first job out of school.  Personally I think there is a LOT to learn from consulting that will prepare you for a future in business, regardless of what you want to focus on - I also know that 3-4 months is not enough to teach you even the tip of the iceberg.  If you have any confidants at the firm, you should reach out about your concerns and your goals for the future.

That said, getting into a 'prestigious' field like consulting, medicine, or law isn't magic.  It's really three things: 

- GPA 
- test scores
- leadership

In high school, you need a great GPA, test score, and leadership to get into a great college.  In college, you need a great GPA and leadership to be considered for prestigious jobs.  That's really it.

All of these factors are under an individual's control.  Will the rich student have an easier time doing well?  Probably.  But for the rest of us, the pertinent question is: what are you willing to sacrifice to make-up for the difference in support?

950,"Congrats on the new role. I personally think Manager is the most abrupt transition. A few tips come to mind:

a) Sit everyone on the team down (include Partners if possible) and discuss personal strengths and weaknesses, project goals, preferred ways of working, etc.  The more you know about your team, the better you'll be able to manage them.

b) Maintain full control of deliverable development, but outsource ALL production to the juniors.  This basically means its up to you to sketch out the storylines (even if its just a skeleton with dummy data) and communicate what you need.  

c) From day 1, agree upon a story with leadership, check-in at least twice a week, but email immediately if a major deviation occurs.  This will minimize churn and all night deck overhauls.

d) Before adding a new task, ask yourself:

- is this in scope?
- how many hours will it take?
- how much will it change the answer?

That last question is key - too many Managers (and Partners frankly) don't think about this enough and send their poor teams on goose chases that change the answer by 0.5%.

e) Watch your team morale!  They're the ones who get the work done after all.  I have no problem spending firm money if the team needs a quick boost.

f) Staff good people - self explanatory.  This one solves 95% of problems - unfortunately though, it will take time to stitch together a team that really clicks.

b) while coming in as an experienced hire is possible, it is a long and uncertain route

c) most recruits here are looking for short-term advice

The reason why you see so many people here recommend the MBA route is because it leads to the highest success rate, relative to all other options.  It is much easier to tell someone who got dinged in undergrad recruiting to try again with an MBA in 3 years than it is to tell them to work in industry for 9 years, and hope that their industry focus will be in high consulting demand when they want to lateral.

My advice to you is to save as much as you can and never stop being frugal.  When I first started, I spent so much money on frivolous things like going out to bars / clubs, buying unnecessary expensive clothes and watches, and too many big trips.  Fast forward almost ten years, now that I'm starting a family, buying a house, taking care of aging parents, etc., I feel more than a tinge of regret on all that wasted capital.

So yeah - a few things that come to mind:

- set a goal for how much money you want to have in your back account at the end of the year - for me, that's 25% of my income.
- max your contribution to take advantage of your 401K match
- pay off any and all debt in a timely fashion
- get a place you'll be comfortable with, but nothing too extravagant - you probably won't be there too much anyway
- start off with reasonably priced clothes/shoes/watches - you can always upgrade later
- look for deals! - sites like www.slickdeals.com or www.fatwallet.com can be very helpful.

There are two major ways to get back into the interview pile: have internal recommendations or have something stellar on your resume.  The first requires you to network very well with firm reps. I know this advice is given often, but also know that it is a challenge to stand out from your peers. The latter is out of grasp of most of us - these are the professional athletes, successful entrepreneurs, etc.

1035,"A very interesting, but perhaps slightly depressing take on work/life balance.

The gist: 

One way to think about work-life balance issues is with a concept known as The Four Burners Theory. Here’s how it was first explained to me: Imagine that your life is represented by a stove with four burners on it. Each burner symbolizes one major quadrant of your life.

- The first burner represents your family.
- The second burner is your friends.
- The third burner is your health.
- The fourth burner is your work.

The Four Burners Theory says that “in order to be successful you have to cut off one of your burners. And in order to be really successful you have to cut off two.”",2016-06-10 03:26:18+00:00,d437udv,1.0,t3_4nehjp,38.0,consulting

But after the initial novelty wore off, I couldn't get over the fact that all the various Tumis are essentially big glamorized buckets.  Even with the discount we get, it's just not an attractive option for me.  As a techhead who works in the tech industry, I have so many gizmos and gadgets that even a casual walk down the street turns a perfectly packed Tumi bag into a trap of wires, headphones, and devices.

- has handles
- has a detachable shoulder strap
- has many pockets
- has a carry-on strap

There are many, many boutique firms out there, so it is certainly feasible there are some that fit your criteria.  However, be aware that most boutiques prefer to hire experienced consultants.

JD is somewhat complicated, so Lets take a step back.  At the MBBs, recruits generally enter at Analyst or Consultant.  All new Analysts, regardless of background, make the same.  Likewise with Consultants.  With JDs, where you enter will generally depend on when you graduated from undergrad.

Concerns like, ""is this person a trusted advisor?"" or ""does it seem like this person have integrity?"" or flat out, ""do I respect this person?"" are a thousand times more important.

My advice to you is to speak with the Manager again and make it clear that this is not something you wish to do and highlight how uncomfortable his behavior makes you feel.  If you don't mind sharing, you could also provide why you do not want to drink, but even this is unnecessary.

1159,"As consultants, a major part of our job is being able to take a large amount of information and process it.  Let me give two examples of when / why this is important:

At the beginning of projects, it is extremely valuable to read as much as you can - and the less you know about the industry, the more important this is.  A good Analyst / Consultant will show up to the client site on day 1, and know the industry's general trends, the client's financials, the products they sell, major events from the last year or two, and the gist of any recent work that we have done.  Besides the last one, all of this information is available publically or at least within our research sources.  Engagements can be fast and furious; I am always disappointed when someone shows up on site and asks basic questions about the company like, ""what's our revenue"" or ""what're our major markets?""

A common part of most projects is the data request - this is when we send the client a laundry list of things we feel we need to complete our analysis.  And since perfect client data is as common as a flying unicorn, what comes back is a deluge of files, none of which is exactly what we need, but much of which contains bits of what we need that must then be pieced together.  A strong analyst / consultant will be able to take this data disaster, process it, connect the different pieces that are important, and turn it into something useful.

Ultimately this means that if you want to perform well in your role, you need to do one of two things:

a) be a fast reader and processor

b) spend more time reading and processing

I don't see any drawbacks to the first, but there definitely can be some for the latter. That said, most people should and will be fine.  After all, you probably had to flex the same muscles to study and cram for midterms and finals.

&gt;Most people are used to thinking about inequality as the pay gap between a CEO and an administrative assistant, or a software developer and a manufacturing worker. That gap definitely matters, but it actually hasn’t changed all that much.
Over the past few years several academic studies have documented that the majority of the increase in income inequality in the U.S. and elsewhere is driven by differences in how well different firms pay.

Excerpt:

&gt;McKinsey is a relative newcomer in the Gulf, but its meteoric rise in the past decade has rocketed it to the top of the local consultancy market, just like everywhere else. McKinsey’s path to domination in the Gulf has been a peculiar one, however.

&gt; It has made its mark by creating grand plans — “economic visions” — for each country. These master plans present countries with a blueprint to transform their entire economies, promising to move them from oil dependency to rich, “diversified,” “knowledge-based” economies.

&gt; The region’s rulers are not particularly beholden to either elected bodies or the opinions of local technocrats. Instead, they pay billions of dollars to receive the wisdom of global management consultants (which almost never include locals in their ranks). Saudi Arabia alone shelled out more than a billion dollars for consultants in 2015.

&gt; The company teams up with young heirs to the throne, who are eager to make their countries’ economies conform to their vision of the future. A less palatable similarity for someone like Prince Salman is how many of the countries who drank the McKinsey Kool-Aid became epicenters of the Arab Spring. Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Yemen — each was convulsed by demonstrations, often animated by economic grievances.",2016-05-11 05:53:00+00:00,d30zriv,1.0,t3_4itj4p,252.0,consulting

1200,"I'd say you see less switching at MBBs due to strict up-or-out policy (which is not as present at other firms) and its resulting impact on the firms and the individuals.

At the Analyst level, it's a 2 year program, so there's no need for switching.

At the post-MBA, non-Partner levels, there is little appetite from the firms to take on laterals for a few reasons:

- First, all the MBBs are pretty aggressive in their up-or-out so there's no need to look outside for talent to move up the ranks.  Often times, the talent pool is so deep that even above-average performers don't make the jump to Senior Manager.  

- Second, time-at-level is expected to be ~2 years - that's hardly enough time for someone new to come in, relearn how things are done, and then try to hit the promotion window.  So in some ways, bringing a lateral on board is viewed as a setup for failure.  

- Finally, given the speed of progression, it's likely that anyone who wants to transfer didn't make the up-or-out cut - and why would one MBB want another's castoff?

From the individual's perspective, there are really only 3 paths: stay on the Partner track, leave consulting for something else, or get asked to leave by the firm.  We can tackle those paths one by one:

- Partner track: again, because of the quick progression, the easiest way to hit Partner is to stay at your firm.  

- Leaving consulting: if you want to leave consulting for something else... well, it's unlikely you'd want to switch to another consulting firm

- Asked to leave: If you're asked to leave but want to stay in consulting, we've already discussed why joining another MBB would be difficult.  The major alternative then, is to head to a tier 2 or a boutique, which does happen occasionally.  But for many, the loss in prestige, pay, and perks just isn't worth it relative to a cushy 9-6 industry job that the firm hands to you on a silver platter.

In regards to Partners, that is where switching is a little bit more common - I'm definitely not privy to conversations where that's decided, but the trends I have noticed are that the switchers are targeted because of their particular expertise and are promised greater responsibility.  For instance, an expert Partner at B might be enticed to go to M because he/she is promised ""Global Lead"" of whatever his expertise is.

But, if it's business-ops, particularly strategy, then I would say the shortest path is through MBB, BB IBDs, and to a lesser extent, the other top consulting firms.  It sounds like going through the business route aligns with your interest as well, so it could make sense to do this.  As for freshman / sophomore internships, I'd say that aim for startups can be good options as they might be easier to get and you will get a wider breadth of responsibility.  If a decent role with a brand name comes up though, that can be a good option as well.

1277,"PE is some of the most rewarding, but difficult types of projects you might get. Clients are always razor sharp and focused on getting as much value out of you as possible.  You'll learn an incredible amount over a very short period of time - whether it's through 40 hours of interviews with relevant executives or experts from around the world or combing through hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of research reports. But at the same time, you'll also be accountable for synthesizing that amount of information into a concise argument for or against multi-million or billion dollar investments.  

In regards to individual PE clients, I think there's a large variance that depends on the philosophy of the firm and the thesis for the particular investment. 

From a firm perspective, guys like Bain Cap or Apollo tend to be super detail focused - they want to know exactly what they are getting. They might ask for a US-wide model but still expect you have a different growth rate for widgets in the Dallas-Fort Worth market versus the Houston market. They'll want to know exactly why one synergy assumption was made over another and a hundred different volatilities. Lifestyle on these studies can often get out of control, but you'll really understand the minutiae of a company and industry. 

Other firms, oftentimes the midcaps, will be more lever driven - ""what 5 things do I need to believe in order to get the return I need?""  I personally enjoy these cases more because it really forces you to think about the trade winds for an industry and how a target will fare - really picking the signal from the noise. Conversations with these types of clients will focus less on the nitty gritty and more what the target looks like if these 5 key levers go right versus if these five key levers go wrong. 

I highly recommend doing a few DDs in your career (though try not to do too many to stay sane) because it really distills down the core toolkit of problem solving and strategic thinking.

If you think about DD type work, there isn't much client exposure - you sit in a war room and just crank, so it's fine to have a lot of young bucks. At the end of the two weeks, the Partner takes the work and presents it to his contact at the PE.  Their revenue per consultant may not be as high, but their margins should let them keep pace.

1292,"I think there are two parts of the pay story that need to be considered.  Most consulting firms start off at similar rates, with non-MBB often higher as they aim to win talent.  But as you gain tenure, MBB will pull away for two reasons: a) steeper increases and b) faster promotion time.  This has a compounding effect. 

In regards to increases, it depends on the level - the gap is non-existent at Consultant, larger at Manager, larger still at Senior Manager, etc.  For instance, Managers at my MBB average ~$250K whereas S&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;O's are closer to $180K.  Senior Managers at my MBB are ~$375K whereas Deloitte is ~$250K.

In regards to the faster promtion time, this is because MBBs (at least in the states) follow a pretty strict up-or-out system.  The path to Partner is 5-8 years max, and if you are deemed off-track, then you are culled.  As far as I understand, S&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;O is not nearly as strict on this and people at stay at certain positions like Senior Manager for a large number of years.  The net impact is that the up-or-out system creates a survivor bias, where a MBB person will be at a higher level as compared to an S&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;O person with the same tenure.

I will note that this applies up until the Partner position.  Partner compensation is a whole other beast, with factors like profit sharing, personal performance, leadership responsibilities, level of Partner, etc., etc., etc.  Needless to say, Partners at any of these major consultancies will be doing just fine.

1342,"I wrote a post the other day about how some people take advice without context and go too far with it.  This whole hypothesis thing is a good example of that.  I don't know where this started, but someone somewhere must be telling people, ""always start with a hypothesis from the get-go!"".  There have been several interviews where I gave the candidate the prompt, and they immediately respond with, ""I think the client should do 'x'.  And oh, can I do take some time to write an issue true?"".  This obviously makes little sense when the person has absolutely zero background information or even asked a single clarifying question.

The best candidates will develop a hypothesis on *how* to solve the problem and then build upon it with the information that they find throughout the case.  They will *not* put an arbitrary stake in the ground.  

Let's say we're talking about a case about a potential acquisition.  You'd listen to the prompt, ask some clarifying questions, draw up an issue tree, and then after you explain it, *then* you might say, ""And I think we should start with profitability"".  Or market trends.  Or whatever.  This is a example of someone being hypothesis driven in a reasonable way.  Then as you learn more, you evolve your hypothesis.  ""Given that we just found that the target has much higher marigns than we do, it seems like an acquisition could make sense.  But, I would like to flesh out the picture some more by looking at....""  And so on and so on until you finish the case.

So to answer your question, a good/correct hypothesis at the outset is meaningless because you have nothing to back it up with. The process by which you solve the case is a thousand times much more critical.",2016-03-31 01:23:11+00:00,d1jvmdi,2.0,t1_d1ji1l2,19480.0,consulting

1. Company – “Does this company have a brand name? Are they known as leaders in their industry? Does the organization’s leadership have a compelling strategy to realize their growth goals?”



2. People – “How long have most team members been with the company? What skills do they bring to the table? What will I learn from them that I don’t already know? What’s the management style of my superiors? What’s the work/life balance? How social is the team?”



3. Job – “What will I be doing on a daily basis? What challenges will I be expected to solve? How will solving these challenges impact the welfare of the business? How far from the top does my boss stand in the organizational structure? What level of exposure to senior leaders can I expect?”



4. Opportunity – “What do the compensation and benefits look like? Where does this position lead within the organization? How quickly can I move up? What milestones must I achieve to ensure promotion?”",2016-03-24 13:39:13+00:00,d1bq7d7,1.0,t3_4brkqw,29.0,consulting

- I became the day-to-day focal point for the client, my leadership, and my team - and satisfying all 3 was critical to performance

- I had to force myself to stop doing the nose-to-the-ground grunt work, which is a 180 degree turn from life as a Consultant

- It was no longer sufficient to be ""a tech industry guy"" - now had to develop a niche of expertise

Analyst to Consultant is easiest - really, the role is pretty much the same with a little more or a little less client exposure depending on your tenure.

Manager to Senior Manager is a fairly natural transition.  It still just feels like running several workstreams, except now its across multiple projects, with a little more emphasis on both internal and external development.

1472,"I'm going to address the financial side of things primarily with the below.

A typical career path for someone from MBB would be something like this:

- Years 1-2: BA (~$80K compensation)

- Years 3-4: MBA (sponsored)

- Years 5-6: Consultant ($170K)

- Years 7-8: Manager ($240K)

- Years 9-11: Senior Manager ($400K)

- Years 12-20: Partner ($750K-$4M)

Your total comp over that time period would be ~$25M, and you start making ~$1M at age 35 or so.  And if you're a ""brilliant person"" maybe you skip the MBA all together and move all timelines up by 2 years - making Partner at age 30. Either way, at every step of the journey, you would almost definitely be making more than a person with the same tenure at a corporate company.  This is part of the reason why people say working at MBB is like accumulating 2x the years.

Let's also talk about the availability of high paying positions at MBB versus a corporation.  If you look at McKinsey's website, it says there are 9,000 consulting staff and 1,400 partners - that's 15% of the whole company in the top-tier bucket from above.  Partner / Director level compensation is generally only seen at the C-Suite / SVP level at Fortune companies, and those positions are nowhere close to being 15% of those companies.

I will note that when it comes to the C-Suite, that is where corporate compensation exceeds consulting compensation - sometimes dramatically so.  And so, Partners do exit out at positions that they think can set them up for a run at that kind of money.  Look no further than James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley and ex-McK partner, now making $23M or Vittorio Colao, also ex-McK who now makes $13M / year at Vodafone.  

One final note - if you're really in it in the money, don't bother with consulting.  Go do banking.  Sure the beginning is a little rougher, but a fully fanged GS MD's bonus alone could be more than a Consulting Partner's full compensation.

Consulting is a war for talent - rankings matter.  Deloitte is a great example - it sits at #4 in Vault's list, and now every recruit considers Deloitte a great alternative to MBB.

Here is a good description I found of how McK is doing it:

(1) Nature of the work: the work of an MI coach is heavily focused on coaching clients on performing their jobs, whereas generalist consultants do a mix of more independent problem-solving (structuring problems, performing analyses, synthesizing and communicating recommendations) as well as coaching/collaborating with clients, often with more focus on independent problem-solving early on in their careers. In tangible terms, this means MI consultants spend more time in face-to-face conversations with clients, less time in Powerpoint and Excel.

(2) Capabilities and experience: there are some differences in the capabilities and experience required for an MI candidate. While both strong problem-solving and strong people skills are required, people skills (communication and leadership, etc.) are somewhat more critical given the nature of the work.

(3) Staffing model: An MI coach is likely to be staffed for longer periods of time at one client, compared with generalist consultants-- e.g., avg. ~12 months at one client rather than avg. ~3 months. In some (but not all) cases, MI coaches may be staffed on a stand-alone basis rather than as a member of a bigger McK team.",2016-03-09 18:03:07+00:00,d0tm25l,4.0,t1_d0tipg1,4504.0,consulting

1500,"From my experience I'd say there are three common entry points: Analyst, Partner, and H/S/W post-MBA. Of these three, it is certainly easiest at the Analyst level.  Regardless, note that it is extremely, extremely competitive just based on sheer number of interested candidates.

I definitely agree with targeting consultant-friendly PE shops as well as joining a top tier consultancy (MBB, primarily). I'd also note that top consultancies have secondment opportunities that often lead into full time positions.

After that, it would depend on the type of PE role you want to enter: investment or operations.

If it's investment, you want a strong background in finance - a banking internship will go a long way, as well as a successful track record of due diligence projects.

If it's operational, you want a strong background in M&amp;amp;A, PMI, or org work. Lots of PE work is about leaning out companies quickly and productively. Industry-experience is a major criteria here since how this works is less transferrable than you might think.

Riding on top of all this criteria is of course, connections. While the top players (KKR, Blackstone, etc.) have capacity to actively recruit consultants, most of the exits I have seen are to smaller tier 2 PE clients. So, it behooves you to get on a retainer-type account and start building relationships.

1527,"Long story short: people at my MBB still complain about the job, but rarely about the firm itself.

Disclaimer: I have never worked at any other consultancy besides my own. So, these are just observations for my firm and not meant to be a comparison to others. 

I would draw a distinction between *the job* and *the firm*.  

There are certainly people who dislike the job.  Whether its the unavoidable travel, the client-first mentality, or the up-or-out pressure, consulting is not for everyone.  I've seen several people leave after just a few months for these reasons - and it's good that they recognize it earlier rather than later. 

When it comes to my firm though, I rarely hear anyone say negative things about it.  And I think that's due to two reason:

- 1, because the work is impactful

- 2, because the firm is diligent in mitigating the worst parts of 'the job'.  

Impact-wise, the vast majority of projects really make a difference for the client and that is motivating.  Perhaps most important to me when I was a analyst/consultant, was that all the menial work is outsourced.  Whether it's slide creation, replicating a model 30x, basic research, or copying a 50 page PDF table into Excel, there is someone to do that for you.  It frees up significant time towards thinking about the issues and building client relationships.  Now that I am further along in my career, I am also appreciating the resources available - the firm makes significant discretionary spend available to throw at problems that allows us to do really creative things that surprise our clients.

Lifestyle-wise, my firm provides a lot of benefits.  For instance, no one looks at utilization, so being on the bench isn't a scary thing.  Hotel and expense accounts are very generous, and most flights are first class.  Culture is also strong as backed by in-office lunches and happy hours on Friday, sponsored social events on the weekends, and annual office vacations.  Significant others and children are invited to almost all of these as well which makes a big difference. 

The final thing that I think makes people committed to my firm is the formal exit process.  If you decide to leave, you are given several weeks to several months paid time off in order to find a new job.  For many people I know, this 'pull the ripcord' benefit is the one they value the most out of everything.  They know that if they ever leave, they will have the firm's transition resources and job security to rely upon until they land somewhere they would really enjoy.",2016-03-04 15:14:30+00:00,d0ndxcu,1.0,t3_48wcdz,29163.0,consulting

[Source](http://prospect.org/article/trouble-bernie-sanderss-revolution)

Let's imagine Sanders is the Democratic nominee. What would it take for his coattails to deliver both houses back to Democratic control? Taking the Senate first. At the moment, a Democratic takeover looks difficult, but possible. The Republicans have a 54-46 advantage, and they are defending 24 seats this year, while Democrats are defending only ten (the imbalance is because the senators elected in the Republican sweep of 2010 are up for re-election). That looks great for Democrats, were it not for the fact that most of those seats are not competitive at all. No matter how revolutionary the Democratic candidate is, Republicans are still going to hold on in places like Idaho and Oklahoma. Most of the experts who follow these races obsessively rate only nine or ten of these races as even remotely competitive.

But it's certainly possible that Democrats could sweep most of them and take back the Senate. What is not possible is for Democrats to win so many that they'd have the 60-seat margin necessary to overcome Republican filibusters. And there would be filibusters on of all the items on President Sanders's agenda. So on the Senate side, the revolution would seem to require both a Democratic sweep and a willingness of the Democrats to destroy the filibuster. Might they do that? Sure. Will they? Probably not.

But that's not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is the House, where redistricting and a more efficient geographic allocation of voters have left Republicans with a structural advantage that will make it particularly hard in the near future for Democrats to take back control. The overwhelming majority of seats in the House are not at all competitive, with one party or the other all but guaranteed to win the seat no matter whom the party nominates for president. As election analysts Charlie Cook and David Wasserman recently noted, ""Today, the Cook Polit­ic­al Re­port counts just 33 seats out of 435 as com­pet­it­ive, in­clud­ing 27 held by Re­pub­lic­ans and six held by Demo­crats. That means that even if Demo­crats swept every single com­pet­it­ive seat, they would still fall three seats short of a ma­jor­ity.""

That doesn't mean it's completely impossible for Bernie Sanders to win such a dramatic victory that he pulls in a Democratic House behind him, just that it's very, very unlikely. And if it did happen, many of those newly elected Democrats would be from conservative districts. He'd have to not only hold their votes, but hold them on intensely controversial reforms. It might be worth remembering how hard it was for Barack Obama to keep Democrats together on things like the Affordable Care Act, which Sanders argues was a change that didn't go nearly far enough.",2016-02-22 22:17:48+00:00,d09tpd4,4.0,t1_d09r9jh,3258.0,consulting

Pre-Recruiting Season*

a) ""What is Consulting"" panel

b) ""Recruiting Process and Networking"" panel

Early Recruiting Season

a) Intro to the Case

b) Intro to the Fit

c) Resume and Cover Letter Tips

Late Recruiting Season

a) Advanced Case and Fit tips

b) Firm Specific Panel (staffed by former summers)

**Prep Activities**

Early Recruiting Season

a) Interview Coaching With Seniors Sign Ups

b) Resume and Cover Letter reviews

Rest of Recruiting Season

a) Peer Interview Coaching Matching

Weekly Activities

a) Pick-Up Interview Prep - whoever shows up just interviews with one another (when it gets close to interview time, you could schedule these on Saturday at 10PM and you'll still have a full house)

Work with your career center, alumni, Consultants from local firms, and even consulting clubs at other schools to get started on assigning people to these events. ",2016-02-16 15:55:15+00:00,d01zacz,2.0,t1_d01lnna,37576.0,consulting

One of Marissa Mayer’s signature policies as chief executive of Yahoo has been the quarterly performance review, in which every employee at the company is ranked on a scale of 1 to 5. The ratings have been used to fire hundreds of employees since Ms. Mayer joined the company in mid-2012.

“The Q.P.R. process was opaque and the employees did not know who was making the final decisions, what numbers were being assigned by whom along the way, or why those numbers were being changed,” the lawsuit says. “This manipulation of the Q.P.R. process permitted employment decisions, including terminations, to be made on the basis of personal biases and stereotyping.”",2016-02-04 19:31:01+00:00,cznw4yc,1.0,t3_446vri,26.0,consulting

My general advice is to be hypothesis driven - you have probably heard this concept from the firms already.

What this is means in the context of the written case, is that you want to quickly go through the given deck, create a hypothesis, and then pull out slides that support your hypothesis. This is in contrast to boiling the ocean - candidates who go through each slide and painstakingly try to discover a common thread will just waste precious time.

Make sure you spend enough time on the slides you have to create (generally a exec summary, recommendation, and next steps) - probably at least 10 minutes. These slides frame your story - without them, even if you picked the best slides from the fact pack, the strucure falls apart. Think in terms of top-down communication - you want to start at the high level first, and then dive into the nitty gritty details.

Also, don't forget that getting the slides together is half the battle - the other half is the presentation. In this case, also remember to be top-down in your communication. This means that you want to start with a quick (emphasis on quick) outline of the problem, your recommendation up front, a high-level view of the major drivers, and then dive into the supporting evidence.

I definitely agree with targeting consultant-friendly PE shops as well as joining a top tier consultancy.  I'd also note that top consultancies have secondment opportunities that often lead into full time positions.

After that, it would depend on the type of PE role you want to enter: investment or operations.  

If it's investment, you want a strong background in finance - a banking internship will go a long way, as well as a successful track record of due diligence projects.

If it's operational, you want a strong background in M&amp;amp;A, PMI, or org work.  Lots of PE work is about leaning out companies quickly and productively.  Industry-experience is a major criteria here since how this works is less transferrable than you might think.

Riding on top of all this criteria is of course, connections.  While the top players (KKR, Blackstone, etc.) have capacity to actively recruit consultants, most of the exits I have seen are to smaller tier 2 PE clients.  So, it behooves you to get on a retainer-type account and start building relationships.

You can try to network with firms you have not had a touch point with. Firms that you have already applied for generally won't consider you again until at least a year or two have passed. They would much rather focus on obtaining hires from a fresh crop of candidates. 

---

At this point, you should focus on consultancies that you have not had any touch points with. Try to network your way into interviews (read the wiki for this).

Unfortunately applying in the fall time frame won't help, and could even hurt. That's because most consultancies will be focused on on-campus-recruiting, which really takes attention away from all else.

A more likely approach is to try to get into consulting post-MBA.

For corporate level, this is any type of work that defines 'where to play'.  You might consider vision development, acquisitions, divestitures, and investment decisions to fall within this.  

For business level, this is essentially any type of work about 'how to play'.  These are topics like differentiation versus cost leadership, product portfolio, and business-level profitability.

Most other types of work are derivative in the sense that they are deal with pursuing activities to fulfill the strategy.  A common breakout would be organization (how do we structure to fulfill our strategy), marketing/sales (how do we capture the customers defined by our strategy), operations (how do we provide goods/services in line with our strategy).",2016-01-28 05:24:51+00:00,czetmb1,1.0,t3_431nna,3961.0,consulting

1713,"There are great reasons to go to MBA as a strategy consultant, but content is generally not one of them.  Instead, it's more about checking the box and building a network.  

My sense is that MBA actually holds more weight in the client world than it does in the consulting world.  I think back on the leadership of the companies I have worked with and they generally have MBAs or at least some other advanced degree.  To be fair, this may be a tech and consumer specific phenomenon.  You may want to do a LinkedIn search to see how common it is in the types of companies you want to work for.  That said, a major part of getting a good exit is connections - if you are able to build good relationships with a client that you would like to work for, I would think that having (or not having) an MBA is relatively moot.  And once you're in, it's not like people walk around with name tags detailing their degrees.

You may also want to look at this from a financial perspective as well.  I just helped one of my friends do this recently.  We basically charted out her expected cash flow without an MBA and her expected cash flow with an MBA (and its associated investment and opportunity cost).  The numbers in her case were close enough that she decided not to do it to avoid the debt burden.",2016-01-27 21:42:41+00:00,czecuhd,1.0,t3_42zs3b,1011.0,consulting

For me, that's already meant making the trade-off of working with 'sexy' west coast tech companies and settling with the big dumb east coast companies who want in on the trends.  At this stage in my career, I basically have three options:

- build a strong local client base in a bid to make Partner
- die trying and join an industry player
- or, leave for an unexpected opportunity well before either option above

In regards to some of the negative sentiments that OP shared, sure.  My firm is a big place - and like any big place, there are awesome people and there are not-so-awesome people.  As such, I've had awesome teams and I've had not-so-awesome teams.  Luckily, earlier on in my career, I was able to connect with some awesome Managers and Partners.  By basically following them around from project to project, I feel like I've been able to avoid some of the very real issues noted above.  This is actually something I stress to new Consultants / BAs - solving for the people is often a smarter choice than solving for the work itself.  If you just downright like your teammates and enjoy hanging out with them, it makes a huge difference in terms of happiness and longevity.",2016-01-21 06:09:28+00:00,cz688d8,3.0,t1_cz5zbw8,15811.0,consulting

a.  Location - if you're in a big city this certainly helps.  Even better if you are local.  I imagine there's more comedy clubs in NYC than there might be in Bentonville.

b.  Hours - I assume these gigs happen evening-ish - you'd have to be on a project that lets you out somewhat earlier than is average (~9PM).  You'd also need to have the energy afterwards to make this happen; it is a pretty draining job after all.  .  On the other hand, a lot of firms are focusing on Work / Life efforts.  [BCG for instance lets employees make a certain time every week sacrosanct](https://hbr.org/2009/10/making-time-off-predictable-and-required) - you might use that.

If you have two equally impressive people in front of you, and one is MBB and one is Deloitte, they will go with the MBB because of the brand.

I'm sure a hiring manager would rather have a well-qualified and passionate consultant from ________ instead of a run-of-the-mill consultant from MBB.  Where the gap may be felt more is in high demand jobs - the Google/Facebook/Palantir Strategy, VC, PE, etc.  They have so many applicants that they do have the luxury of choosing among the best.

To speak to your question about MBA, there is no secret to getting into a top school.  Schools care about:

- Undergrad and GPA
- GMAT
- Firm and Career Trajectory
- Leadership / Extracurriculars
- Essays
- Recommendations

The better you are at each one, the higher your chances of getting in.

1860,"The answer depends on if you view consulting as a career or stepping stone.

If you see it as a career, life at the majors are all pretty similar. You make good money, you travel a lot, you deal with clients, life is full of pressure. Maybe you'll make more at a McKinsey than a Deloitte, but the difference is negligible if you compare to our investment banking cousins. Maybe the path to Partner is faster at MBB, but there is a requisite raise in stress. And maybe selling is a little easier when you're at an MBB, but being good at it goes a long way either positively or negatively. But life is pretty similar.

If you see it as a stepping stone, that's where I feel like MBB shines. The average tenure is 2 years for a reason: your opportunities right when you hit Manager are stellar - the hottest companies knock on your front door with amazing packages and roles. It's not uncommon to exit out 2-3 years post-MBA at $300k+ total comp while doing a 9-6p. And the closer one gets to Partner, the crazier the numbers because firms want to catch you before you cross that rubicon. Furthermore, the cachet of MBB is like Harvard - it's a signal that you were chosen by one of the best firms around.

1899,"I'd push back a little on this from a high-level perspective - if Senior Consultants elsewhere are what they are like at my firm, this is when you are independently owning workstreams and lower level client relationships.  It's also when you're about to make a push into Manager level.  To be successful in this role, you have to already be comfortable with the lifestyle, understanding analysis and communications, as well as how to interface with clients.  /u/therealfarmerjoe also brings up a stellar point I forgot about - the network.  Senior Consultants who have worked their way up will already have champions who are willing to push them along and forgive them for mistakes if necessary.

And since being successful in consulting often is a competition, the relative weakness of these consulting skills does impact experienced hires in terms of being attractive to projects and ultimately promotions.  It's by no means the fact these people cannot catch up... it's a question of how long it will take until they can do so.

That all said... it is *entirely possible and commonplace* for experienced hires to come in and be rockstars.  OP essentially asked for common pitfalls for why experienced hires who fail do so, and these are the ones I could think of.  But still, experienced hires who come in should have been thoroughly vetted to make sure they *do* have these skills to make sure they can succeed.  That's why there's often hard criteria for quantitative backgrounds, why McKinsey does the whole PEI process, why other firms give presentation-based cases.

1904,"From my own experience, three reasons come to mind.

a) they lack foundational analytical or communication skills - or to put it more kindly, they haven't adapted to how *insert consultancy* thinks or communicates - I see non-traditional MBAs struggle with this too.  A senior consultant / manager who came up through the ranks (i.e., was an Analyst grunt) has a deep understanding of how to breakdown problems and exactly how long such things will take.  Unless you come from a data background in industry, I really don't think there are better Excel gurus than tenured analysts.  And while this is not a skill that will make you a Partner, it still provides you with a valuable lens.  And then of course, there's formatting and communication style, which will take time to learn.

b) they are not used to the pace - there was a conversation on this earlier this week, but suffice to say, consulting is more strenuous than the traditional 9-5 of an industry job.  It can be a jolt if you have never experienced it before

c) they are not used to client service - this a tough one to overcome and is also a problem for many analysts who go direct-to-consultant.  Working in an traditional company, your power often comes from your seniority.  There's a clear hierarchy and people do what their bosses tell them needs to be done.  In consulting, so much of what we do is exerting soft influence - put another way, how the heck do I convince someone who I have no control over to do something that they may not want to do?  Like any skill, this requires practice to be good at; and unfortunately for experienced hires, many of them have not had to exercise this muscle very much, but still come in at a level where most of their job depends on doing this well",2015-12-18 09:16:06+00:00,cy38nnz,1.0,t3_3xbpax,1013.0,consulting

The Bain rumors all stemmed from a few years ago when they were having problems with their partnership structure. Too many partners needing to get paid out for their shares upon retiring, which would have left a concerning lack of capital in the firm. The issue has since been addressed (likely through capital calls and a rewriting of the partnership agreement). Other firms have not had this problem as they require partners to give back shares without / with little compensation. The Bain name is powerful enough that I highly doubt they would sell themselves. This is in contrast to Booz, who were somewhat on the outside looking in on the top tier and unable to command MBB premiums, and yet lacking the huge economies of scale that drive how Big4 competes in the market.",2015-12-09 05:53:03+00:00,cxsjeh7,1.0,t3_3w19bl,3044.0,consulting

Your estimates to seem a little high, even though your base numbers are a little low.  I also think you have to compare US specific to semi-control skew.

1.  MBB Global Employees: 17,000 McK, **10,000** BCG, 5,000 Bain = 32,000 employees

2.  **60%** consultants = 19,200

3.  **40%** Post-MBA Level (Associate / Consultant) = 8,000

4.  **30%** US-based = 2,400

5.  **2.5** year average tenure = 970 turnover / year

6.  **75%** are MBAs (instead of other fields) = 700

7.  MBB hires at Top 15 = 50 hires / school for US

8.  If you assume that a M7 would have a 2x hiring clip versus the remaining 8, this means:

- M7 = 66 hires / school for US 
- Next 8 = 33 hires / school for US

We can loosely check this against some published data.  

Booth and Columbia both have ~100 MBB hires.  They also have ~35% international students and we might assume they all go back home.  This results in 66 MBB hires, as per above.  

Fuqua and Ross had an average of 40 hires.  If we assume 35% international students here too, this results in 26 MBB hires.",2015-12-06 07:29:15+00:00,cxox98q,4.0,t1_cxor1tj,14073.0,consulting

Students at Harvard and Stanford quickly learned, however, that these fields were prestigious and that students should be pursuing them. A major reason students became excited about these fields is because the schools essentially gave great access to companies in these fields at the expense of other ones.

I would also disagree that moderation has been very inconsistent, especially if the timescale is the last few months.

That's a mistake we made in not fully aligning on the rules internally and what we hope this new rollout will prevent going forward.

Sarcasm is also covered in rule 4. I find sarcasm to be fine if it is at least in good taste.  The exception is comments that are abusive and offensive per above. There's no place here for racial epithets, crude sexual jokes, misogyny, etc. Another is related to the circlejerking issue above, where a decent post is just filled with sarcastic and otherwise non-value-add comments. We will likely intervene to get it back on track. Honestly this happens rarely, but it does from time to time.

I think the reason you perceive it as somewhat unnecessary is because we, as mods, try to be as vigilant as possible in resolving the issues that these rules address as soon as possible. But nevertheless, we are few, and bad behavior has definitely been creeping up significantly.

On the more egregious end are people trying to dox one another, including the mods. Just a few weeks ago, there was a round of shadowbans from Reddit admin related to this issue. There's also been several posts inquiring and promoting expense fraud or credentials fraud that have given the sub a black eye.  Just this week we removed a post asking for real case interview scoring rubrics. 

On the abuse front, we have seen an increase of comments that have had downright hurtful remarks about race, gender, etc.  I'll also note that these also come from people that I've never even seen on the sub before. For example, a AMA post comes to mind right away where the OP was hit with several crude sexual ""jokes"" while doing nothing but trying to contribute to our community. Relatedly, I have also received plenty of PMs complaining about unwarranted harassment in various threads. 

On the lighter end of it - you have no idea how many times per day that we remove posts and type, ""recruitment sticky please"". At the very least, the rules will make it clear that such posts will be removed without notice.

It means that people on the forums are civil to one another even when topics are controversial.  It means that recruits utilize the stickies to preserve the atmosphere for consultants to exchange ideas.  And most importantly, it means that anyone and everyone should feel welcome to the sub so long as they respect one another.

When people don't respect one another, i.e., when a recruit ignores the sticky or [something like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/3rs3ua/job_offer_my_accenture_should_i_tell_them_i_lied/) happens, tit-for-tat doesn't kill me.

- The top 11 players paid, on average, $2 million in entry fees and profited $135,000 each. They accounted for 17 percent of all entry fees. The winningest player in our sample profited $400,000 on $3 million in entry fees.

- The rest of the top 1.3 percent of players paid, on average, $9,100 in entry fees and profited $2,400 each, for a 27 percent return on investment, which is extremely impressive. These contestants accounted for 23 percent of all entry fees and 77 percent of all profits.

- Five percent of players are the big fish; they lost $1,100 on entry fees of $3,600 on average. 

- Eighty percent of players were the minnows; they lost $25 on entry fees of $49 on average.

Another note: Ed Miller, professional poker player and author of some of the best books on poker strategy, is one of the authors!

2159,"My reflections are just based on my experience at an MBB, and also having tons of friends at other MBBs.  

What is common across the firms that defines culture is their *structures*.  What I mean by this is the policies that cut across the firm.  For instance, McKinsey has a global staffing model.  BCG has a regional staffing model.  Bain has a pyramid model of employees (Analysts &gt; Consultants &gt; Managers, etc.), while McKinsey has more of a diamond model (Analysts &lt; Consultants &gt; Managers, etc.).  These creates a foundation for structure (and stereotype).

But an important second factor is the culture that is contributed by the specific office.  And I would attribute that to the people and location; just these two things can account for huge differences even at the same firm.  Bain Chicago is going to be markedly different from Bain San Francisco given the types of people who self-select for project work.  McKinsey NYC is going to be markedly different from McKinsey Stamford even though they are an hour from one another because of the office size.  BCG today could be different from BCG two years ago because the guy who used to love throwing together weekend activities left for another job. Even the Head of Office makes a huge difference.  Years ago, the rule for my office was business casual on Fridays.  Then, they allowed jeans, and the whole culture shifted. 

My recommendation is understand the structures that make the firms different from one another, and then try to engage people from the specific offices as much as possible.  Don’t compare “Bain versus McKinsey versus BCG”.  Compare “Bain Boston versus McKinsey Boston versus BCG Boston”.

- ""Recruit and screen..."" based on what?

- ""Strategize development""... again, tells me nothing about what you did

Project Experience

- Same feedback... everything is generic, I really want to understand what you *did*

2267,"I worked in VC for about a year.  Short answer is that the in-common skills will vary based on what you are doing for the VC.  I'd break it down into three major types of work, and how much you dip into each will depend on the firm.  

a) Sourcing - getting out there and connecting with entrepreneurs and startups.  Runs the gamut between cold calls, conferences, hanging out at Hacker Dojo, whatever it takes to find cool stuff to invest in.  And then, following up and making sure you're the go-to VC for funding.  Obviously people skills and persistence are important here, as they would be in consulting.

b) Investing: listening to pitches and building models (business cases, market forecasts, cap tables, etc.)  Obviously lots of cross-skills with the quantitative requirements of being a Analyst.  

c) Operations: where you work with a portfolio company.  This probably has the most overlap with consulting.  I did this and pretty much everyone on the team was ex-consultants.  You're trying to figure out how the company can be run better, what they need to leverage (other portfolio companies or external ones), and helping to make business decisions.  It's pretty similar to regular consulting though (I found) often times the solution ends up being creating connections.

Based on my own experience, I think the major (obvious) difference is that decisions pretty much get implemented in real time.  Decide to kill a product at 12 PM, it gets killed at 3 PM.  The other weird thing is understanding that most of the companies you are managing are going to slowly bleed to death, which is a mite bit depressing.  Also, your client ends up being the Principals of the fund - so while you may be working with portfolio companies, the real decision is often made by the board.

As I had said in your other post, I think you should take the internship.",2015-11-02 04:46:10+00:00,cwla61w,1.0,t3_3r51ut,20035.0,consulting

However, if the deck continues onward then it will often be in client format. So for instance, if we're doing a buy/no buy recommendation, but to a CEO, who in turns needs to present to his board of directors. Alternatively  if it's the case where we recommend a company reorg which the client then needs to communicate through the company and will likely use materials from our deck.

2296,"Most relevant stuff on Page 28 onwards about destabilizing organizations:

#(11) General Interference with Organizations and Production

**(a) Organizations and Conferences**

(1) Insist on doing everything through ""channels."" Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to, expedite decisions.

(2) Make ""speeches."" Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your ""points"" by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate ""patriotic"" comments.

(3) When possible, refer all matters to committees, for ""further study and consideration."" Attempt to make the committees as large as possible - never less than five.

(4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.

(5) Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.

(6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to reopen the question of the advisability of that decision.

(7) Advocate ""caution."" Be ""reasonable"" and urge your fellow-conferees to be ""reasonable"" and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.

(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision -raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.


**(b) Managers and Supervisors**

(1) Demand written orders.

(2) ""Misunderstand"" orders. Ask endless questions or engage in long correspondence about such orders. Quibble over them when you can.

(3) Do everything possible to delay the delivery of orders. Even though parts of an order may be ready beforehand, don't deliver it until it is completely ready.

(4) Don't order new working materials until your current stocks have been virtually exhausted, so that the slightest delay in filling your order will mean a shutdown.

(5) Order high-quality materials which are hard to get. If you don't get them argue about it. Warn that inferior materials will mean inferior work.

(6) In making work assignments, always sign out the unimportant jobs first. See that the important jobs are assigned to inefficient workers of poor machines.

(7) Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those which have the least flaw. Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.

(8) Make mistakes in routing so that parts and materials will be sent to the wrong place in the plant.

(9) When training new workers, give incomplete or misleading instructions.

(10) To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.

(11) Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.

(12) Multiply paper work in plausible ways. Start duplicate files.

(13) Multiply the procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on. See that three people have to approve everything where one would do.

(14) Apply all regulations to the last letter.




**(c) Office Workers**

(1) Make mistakes in quantities of material when you are copying orders. Confuse similar names. Use wrong addresses.

(2) Prolong correspondence with government bureaus.

(3) Misfile essential documents.

(4) In making carbon copies, make one too few, so that an extra copying job will have to be done.

(5) Tell important callers the boss is busy or talking on another telephone.

(6) Hold up mail until the next collection.

(7) Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside dope.


**(d) Employees**

(1) Work slowly. Think out ways to increase the number of movements necessary on your job: use a light hammer instead of a heavy one, try to make a small wrench do when a big one is necessary, use little force where considerable force is needed, and so on.

(2) Contrive as many interruptions to your work as you can: when changing the material on which you are working, as you would on a lathe or punch, take needless time to do it. If you are cutting, shaping or doing other measured work, measure dimensions twice as often as you need to. When you go to the lavatory, spend a longer time there than is necessary. Forget tools so that you will have to go back after them.

(3) Even if you understand the language, pretend not to understand instructions in a foreign tongue.

(4) Pretend that instructions are hard to understand, and ask to have them repeated more than once. Or pretend that you are particularly anxious to do your work, and pester the foreman with unnecessary questions.

(5) Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right.

(6) Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skillful worker.

(7) Snarl up administration in every possible way. Fill out forms illegibly so that they will have to be done over; make mistakes or omit requested information in forms.

(8) If possible, join or help organize a group for presenting employee problems to the management. See that the procedures adopted are as inconvenient as possible for the management, involving the presence of a large number of employees at each presentation, entailing more than one meeting for each grievance, bringing up problems which are largely imaginary, and so on.

(9) Misroute materials.

(10) Mix good parts with unusable scrap and rejected parts.


**(12) General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion**

(a) Give lengthy and incomprehensible explanations when questioned.

(b) Report imaginary spies or danger to the Gestapo or police.

(e) Act stupid.

(d) Be as irritable and quarrelsome as possible without getting yourself into trouble.

(e) Misunderstand all sorts of regulations concerning such matters as rationing, transportation, traffic regulations.

(f) Complain against ersatz materials.

(g) In public treat axis nationals or quislings coldly.

(h) Stop all conversation when axis nationals or quislings enter a cafe.

(i) Cry and sob hysterically at every occasion, especially when confronted by government clerks.

(j) Boycott all movies, entertainments, concerts, newspapers which are in any way connected with the quisling authorities.

(k) Do not cooperate in salvage schemes.",2015-10-30 17:18:26+00:00,cwik2pq,1.0,t3_3qv21n,51.0,consulting

2307,"US perspective:

So I'd split out international travel into two buckets: getting staffed on a domestic project that requires some international travel, and getting staffed on an international project.

For the latter one, at my MBB, if you want to do an international project, you just tell your staffer and you'll get on one.  Of course things get trickier if you want to go to a place like China, but don't speak Mandarin.  But if you just want to go to an English-speaking international country, it's pretty straight forward

For the projects that require international travel, that's a bit more nuanced.  Ones that just pop in my mind are:

a) expansion projects (i.e., Walmart wants to enter Colombia)

b) leadership in one country, problem in another (i.e., CEO in US wants us to improve profitability in China)

2385,"I thought her ""better practices"" are just not thought out whatsoever:

&gt;adopting a more expansive definition of educational quality to include universities on their list that exhibit both high levels of academic achievement—including job-relevant coursework or hands-on training—and diversity

Target schools are usually already there for high levels of academic achievement.  What is job relevant coursework for a consultant?  We always talk about how our days are totally different so it's not like learning a trade.  What we need are sharp minds, which is why major is not an important consideration.

&gt;firms could perform more intensive screens on grades, which for elite students are currently used only as a basic threshold in determining interview slot

We already reject 3.7s from Harvard, so it's not like GPA is going to help us filter much.  How do we equate a 3.8 from Columbia with a 3.9 from Tulane?  Well, if I were to take the standard consulting approach, we'd weight each school... probably based on rankings.  And let's just talk numbers.  There are 20M US college kids, so say 5M seniors who might apply.  Even if we assume only 5% are interested in consulting and we only consider the top 10%, that's still 25,000 resumes we would actually have to spend time looking at.  

&gt; They could also put more emphasis on the tasks performed at prior jobs, which I found employers tended to underweigh in résumé review

So let's just focus on b-school for this one.  In general, those at top MBAs work in companies that I know about in roles that I know about.  I know what an IBD Analyst at JPM does.  I know what a Marketing Associate at Facebook does.  Branch out too much and we'll be lose that level of understanding.  Top b-schools do these screenings for us.

&gt;Before interviewing an applicant, recruiters could also use performance-based exercises not tied to attendance at particular schools. 

Again, we look for sharp minds.  There's no ""consulting skillset"" test that would be effective.  This is why the GMAT and SAT are still important.  And frankly, if you had good GMATs / SATs you probably went to a great school.

2387,"&gt; the major consultancies are dominated by WASPy types, because that's the well where they draw their employees from

So I disagree that the ""well"" is the problem.  Every year, our recruiting classes gets more and more diverse.  In the last orientation I helped with, white males were actually a minority in the room.  HBS has a 40% US ethnic minority ratio and I would say we hire around that number, if not even higher.  One point I'll make here is that the majority of these are Asian / Indian.  Blacks and Hispanics are woefully underrepresented relative to US population - to be fair, we do have active recruiting presence at historically black colleges for Analysts, though there is no MBA equivalent.

The bigger issue I see for the makeup of my firm is the glass, bamboo, black, whatever ceiling.  As an Asian American, it is hard as hell to find an Asian Partner to be a mentor - even though I am in one of the most diverse cities in the world.  Plenty of us as Consultants, plenty of us as Managers, a good amount as Senior Managers, but Partners?  Like finding a needle in a haystack because so many of us get counseled out right before.  And as we had already discussed in a previous thread, there's one road to Partner and that's through selling.  So why can't we sell?  My guess is that it's a reflection of the US business landscape - after all, most CEOs are older WASPs, and without prejudice, you connect better with those like you.

Not sure what the solution is to diversity at the top, but I'm convinced that recruiting is not the problem.",2015-10-25 08:07:08+00:00,cwc04jq,9.0,t1_cwbnpdt,30022.0,consulting

2. W - ahead of the rest, but not quite H/S

- Add relevant education honors / awards / scholarships

- How did you streamline the Salesforce accounts?  Not sure what you did here
- Great bullets on IBFE

- Streamline the additional section as in the example resume from above",2015-10-19 22:14:45+00:00,cw5o67g,2.0,t1_cw4o9g7,74301.0,consulting
2476,"So part of this will indeed come from practice and exposure to more cases.  That said, the majority of 'solutions' can be bucketed into a few categories.  I would urge you to go back into your old cases and try to discern these categories.  Then, just spend a few hours and think critically about the answers in the cases and then brainstorm some on your own.  Something that might help you with this (in both developing answers and communicating) is turning the issue into a formula.

Let's take for example increasing market share.  What is the formula behind this?  Market Share = Addressable Market Size * Market Share

**Ways To Raise Addressable Market Size**

- Expand to a new geography
- Expand to a new business/product segment
- Expand to new customer segments
- Find a partner for joint ventures

**Ways To Increase Market Share**

- Offer a better product
- Offer better prices
- Offer promotions / bundles
- Put together a marketing campaign
- Focus on specific segments

Let's apply this to Walmart:

**Ways To Increase Addressable Market Size**

- Expand into Mexico
- Offer its own banking services
- Focus on rapid online delivery services
- Target budget-chic shoppers with collaborations with designers

**Ways To Increase Market Share**

- Focus on making Walmarts better places to shop (better tech, dress code)
- Make sure its prices are comparable to the Targets and Costcos in the area
- Advertise delivery service to those outside of the range
- Focus on budget-chic shoppers through magazine ads and radio

You can do the same for Increasing Revenues (Ways to Increase Price / Ways To Increase Quantity), Decreasing Costs (Ways To Decreased Fixed Costs / Ways to Decrease Variable Costs), Increasing Supply (Ways To Increase Addressable Population / Ways To Increase Production), etc.  It's going to take some brainpower and some time, but I think it'll help you be better prepared going into these cases.  

I also recommend that you just read business periodicals and think critically about the issues.  They'll often explicitly tell you why a company is doing something and the problem they are trying to address.  You can take this as a knowledge nugget, but be sure to also think some more about the benefits and drawbacks of their actions. ",2015-10-19 22:08:10+00:00,cw5nxru,6.0,t1_cw5n80q,1160.0,consulting

To drive the type of growth required to thrive in the software and online-services sector, acquisitions must be done regularly and treated as a capability that fuels both organic and inorganic growth. Companies that successfully accelerate from $100 million to $1 billion in annual revenue typically undertake more than two deals per year, use acquisitions to accelerate their core organic growth, and deliberately align the deal rationale with their most pressing growth challenges. In short, what matters is not whether you do acquisitions. What counts is how you do them.",2015-10-17 20:11:07+00:00,cw38ss1,1.0,t3_3p5dhn,23.0,consulting

2505,"Fit and Cases are equally important.

Our job as consultants is two fold: we do analysis in small teams to find the right answer, and we then convince everyone else that it's the right answer.

Obviously, the case tries to hone on your mental horsepower to do to the work.  The fit tests for the rest: do you have the interpersonal skills to become a trusted advisor?  Can you persuade others - especially those you have no control over - to do things?  Are you able to work seamlessly and independently in a small team?  And especially, am I going to enjoy spending time with you?

What I have found is that everyone hyperfocuses on the case, so everyone does extremely well within a small band.  The fit by contrast, couldn't be more different.  So many people just think, ""there's no way to prep for fit"" or ""I am who I am"".  And so you see a huge range of performance on the fit side.  

Putting this another way, you might think of average case performance as a B+, with a range from B- to A+.  Fit however, the average might be a C, with a range from F to A+.  And we'd much rather take the candidate with above average case and excellent fit over the candidate with excellent case and just average fit. 

To address your point on correlation, there's a few factors.  First, not every firm is looking for the same thing.  Second, not every office is looking for the same thing.  And finally, there's just the issue of small numbers.  On average, interviews will get us a crop of good candidates.  But on an individual basis, there's a lot more room for error.  It's tough to be perfect on every single case study, every single fit interview, etc.  And hey, maybe it even works out better this way, I doubt it'd be fun if the same 5 people got all of the offers, right?",2015-10-17 20:01:33+00:00,cw38h46,1.0,t3_3p50te,5295.0,consulting

Looks like a good start.  Some tweaks, hopefully shouldn't take too much time:

- grammatical error in tagline and sources
- numbers don't match - rounding or calculation error?
- can we fill out the table with comps?  how long would this take?
- can we find a more impactful quote?  seems duplicative
- Do we know which ""B"" will remain?
- Please deword some bullets - doesn't feel punchy enough
- ""among the highest""... can we be more specific?
- I have heard that Accenture may also acquire McKinsey. Can you look into this?  How long would it take?

Another consideration is that Strategy is our bread and butter, and we need to protect it while we grow.

Been to five of these so far!  Family vacation in HK, work for the NY ones, and getaways with the SO for the others.

- Sheraton HK Hotel is nice and their free breakfast is stellar... but I'm shocked it made it over the W... in addition to all the standard touches, I was on the swimming pool on like the ~70th floor and the views are just mindblowing

- W Koh Samui is beautiful every which way you look and you cannot ask for better service; though perhaps that's more of a facet of Thailand

- Gritti Palace is like walking into a castle; not much to look at from the outside, but the inside just bleeds opulence.  And if you have a Gran Canal balcony, you can just sit there all day and watch the boats go by

- Shocked the Four Points Times Square is on this list and a travesty the Meridien Parker is left off.  I remember staying at the Four Points in the winter once and the wind blowing against the window made the worst ""woooooing"" sound all night.  At some point, thought my room was haunted.

""In 1966, the company advertised in Time magazine under the guise of looking for recruits. ""What does it take to succeed at McKinsey?"" the headline asked in one ad. The answer: ""Outstanding mental equipment finely honed by a first-rate education, coupled with the imagination to solve complex problems; the self-confidence, skill in expression, and sensitivity ot other people that lead to high personal effectiveness; and of course, good character, and high standards.""

The message was clearly aimed at potential clients as much as potential hires.  But the firm denied any advertising motivation once again.  McKinsey's insistence that it did not engage in a PR strategy was simply false; in the 1960s, the firm contracted with PR pioneer Pendleton Dudley.  It later used the services of Murden and Co., a consulting firm even more behind the scenes than mcKinsey.  ",2015-10-12 12:26:31+00:00,cvwu95h,6.0,t1_cvwt91x,3354.0,consulting

What this is means in the context of the written case, is that you want to quickly go through the given deck, create a hypothesis, and then pull out slides that support your hypothesis.  This is in contrast to boiling the ocean - candidates who go through each slide and painstakingly try to discover a common thread will just waste precious time.

Make sure you spend enough time on the slides you have to create (generally a exec summary, recommendation, and next steps) - probably at least 10-15 minutes.  These slides frame your story - without them, even if you picked the best slides from the fact pack, the strucure falls apart.  Think in terms of top-down communication - you want to start at the high level first, and then dive into the nitty gritty details.

Also, don't forget that getting the slides together is half the battle - the other half is the presentation.  In this case, also remember to be top-down in your communication.  This means that you want to start with a quick (emphasis on quick) outline of the problem, your recommendation up front, a high-level view of the major drivers, and then dive into the supporting evidence.

2627,"&amp;gt;so there's this ""fit"" part that seems really important. 

I am hoping this is not news. I would say there are three *equally* important parts in the interview

1. Case - do you have the analytical horsepower to do the work? Half our job is coming up with the right answer. 

2. Interpersonal Skill - do you have the EQ to handle clients?  The other half of our job is convincing the client (and others) that our answer is right

3.  Fit - would I want to see you in the office every Friday / sit in a windowless conference room with you for 12 hours a day?  We've found that quality of teammate is one of the MOST important drivers of satisfaction for good reason. 

Unfortunately too many people spend their prep time like this:

Case: 75%

Interpersonal Skill (through story telling): 15%

Fit: 10%

And here's the other thing. Since people way way overindex on the case, that means the average performance is already great, with a narrow distribution. By contrast the other categories have a much wider range of performance and the average is lower. So in the end, we'd much rather have the people who were slightly above average casers but excellent fit, instead of those who are significantly above casers but average fit. 

Put another way, once you've reached a certain benchmark in cases, it's the fit and interpersonal that decide your fate. ",2015-10-11 13:06:11+00:00,cvvrdvf,6.0,t1_cvvgqfb,34994.0,consulting

Why have an analyst crank a high level model with suspect assumptions when you can supplant much of it with this kind of big data approach? 

Some cool examples of what Watson can do:

- For a major retailer, IBM developed a cognitive solution that analyzes the client's data in the context of information from multiple external sources -- including local weather and up-to-the-minute social sentiment -- to sense deviations in demand for selected products, make recommendations in areas from replenishment to pricing and dramatically improve demand forecasting.

- The cognitive systems of a leading provider of consumer insurance use Watson natural language capabilities to answer questions and provide advice about the company's products and services to create a more compelling online experience.

2660,"It's an interesting question. Do you need to be attractive to be a consultant?  Absolutely not. Does it help?  Almost certainly. Studies have shown that attractive people earn more and get promoted more. Attractive sales people sell more, CEOs are taller than the average. Heck, the lovely Consultant on my team can get clients to show up 15 minutes early to meetings!  Its because attractiveness provides both direct and indirect benefits. In terms of direct, people are more likely to listen to you and engage with you. Indirectly, this helps you build self confidence over time. 

Is it a deal breaker?  Absolutely not - there are plenty of more important determinants in what makes a strong consultant - problem solving, pace of learning, tolerance for fatigue, brain capacity, etc - and none of these have anything to do with attractiveness. Other things like persuasiveness, relationship building, or leadership may derive benefits from attractiveness, but again, it's far from the most important determinant. A handsome man who can't communicate persuasive arguments won't win any clients, and a beautiful woman who can't inspire her teams will struggle to deliver projects. 

Anyway, point is, attractiveness is but one of many, many factors in a good consultant. As long as you are presentable and tidy that's all you can do on that front. Focus instead on what you can control. ",2015-10-08 06:28:50+00:00,cvs8i0e,1.0,t3_3nxtd7,1914.0,consulting

Growth rate was also higher (18% v 10%), albeit being inorganic. No one knows how this is going to shakeout for them, but size does provide a crutch for mitigating missteps.

On the DD side, the mandate is to get to know an industry / company super well in 2-3 weeks and have an opinion on their attractiveness. The work can be split several ways, but here's an example for a Consultant. Say we have a PE client looking at a medium sized company with two major business lines. I would have two consultants, each focused on one offering. On any given day they'd probably do a few things: General research (1 hour), interviews with industry executives, customers, and other experts (5-6 hours of interviews, 1 hour of organization / reflection), team analysis and info sharing (1-2 hour), thinking / slides / modeling (4 hours). Depending on the friendliness of the potential deal, there may also be site visits and management interviews. We'd probably do this Monday to Saturday depending on the urgency and take Sunday off. By the last week of the process, the work changes from content creation to refinement and socialization with higher level partners and preparation for the investment committee.

If you see it as a career, life at the majors are all pretty similar. You make good money, you travel a lot, you deal with clients, life is full of pressure. Maybe you'll make more at a McKinsey than a Deloitte, but the difference is negligible if you compare to our investment banking cousins. Maybe the path to Partner is faster at MBB, but there is a requisite raise in stress. And maybe selling is a little easier when you're at an MBB, but being good at it goes a long way either positively or negatively. But life is pretty similar. 

If you see it as a stepping stone, that's where I feel like MBB shines. The average tenure is 2 years for a reason: your opportunities right when you hit Manager are stellar - the hottest companies knock on your front door with amazing packages and roles. It's not uncommon to exit out 2 years post-MBA at $300k+ packages while doing a 9-6p. And the closer one gets to Partner, the crazier the numbers because firms want to catch you before you cross that rubicon. Furthermore, the cachet of MBB is like Harvard - it's a signal that you were chosen by one of the best firms around. Some firms, especially the HF/PE/VC set will only hire Consultants from MBB. And finally, in a all-else-equal comparison against peers, MBB will usually win out.  This is one of those cases where prestige does translate into dollars.

Alternatively, you might say that the population is 320M, an average lifespan is 80 years, so now you have 4M people per age band. You can then use the simplified number to build up; ie, all school age males would be 4M people per age band times 12 years = ~ 50M people in school, divide by 2 for gender, and now you have 25M school aged males.

Make the interviewer feel like you are problem solving together. This is especially important in the second round. 

Try to treat your pages like slides - when you're explaining your framework, turn the paper to them. Do the same thing for charts.

Another thing is related to top-down communication. When you're about to do a calculation for instance, go ahead and describe to the interviewer your approach first. Then see if they agree. This is in contrast to a person who just puts their head down, does calculations, and reports back at the end. 

Finally, engage the interviewer with some interesting anecdotes. This is especially useful in brainstorming. This is where general business knowledge is helpful, if you can throw in something unique. Remember; we are giving the same damn case 8 times in a row.  If you bring up something cool, make us go ""Huh that's interesting"" that goes a long way to bringing our engagement back.

Strategy is obviously one of the most important decisions a company can make.  And often times, the firms looking for strategy help are the wounded gazelles (Blackberry, Gap, O&amp;G, etc.) who have a real going concern issue.  And so, for advice they turn to the top firms in the field, i.e., MBB.  These firms are already well known for not having great work life/balance; add on the high pressure of strategy, and it's a tough combination.",2015-09-27 03:20:11+00:00,cvfgk95,1.0,t3_3mi2ex,26155.0,consulting

Operations is especially important; how are you going to tell a company what it should do if you don't understand the foundation it is built on?  The routine functions are what allow a company to work on a day-to-day basis.  You can't just tell Texas Instruments to enter the tablet market on their own because they are a tech company and the tablet market is growing.  You have to deeply understand where their company is positioned, what their operational capabilities are, why they manufacture the way they do, how their sales force is organized, etc., etc.

I think that's a bit of a simplified, or perhaps naive, way of classifying strategy projects.  I spent several years focused on growth strategy earlier in my career, and it was a rare case where we didn't have volumes and volumes of detailed analytics backing up any recommendation we made.  It was far from a bunch of people sitting in a room pontificating on where a company should go or what the headwinds are for an industry.

Here are some examples I have been a part of (obviously different companies) to give you an idea of the kinds of research behind a robust strategy recommendation:

- Should Blackberry switch to a consumer company?  Run a Monte Carlo analysis on how the market shares would shake out across all major geographies if they entered, informed by a detailed customer conjoint studies

- Should Dundler Mifflin Paper Company divest its manufacturing arm?  Do a game theory analysis on how moving to a contract basis would affect profitability dependent on its potential suppliers' outlooks. 

- Should Conoco start acquiring across the O&amp;amp;G value chain in the down market?  Build a demand model informed by econometrics for how the market will trend and at what prices acquisitions make sense.

For coats, I've tried a lot of kinds (peacoats, wool trenches, down jackets, etc.), but I've settled on thick toggle coats.  I got this one a few years ago when I was in Europe (http://www.gloverall.com/mens/mid-length-duffle-coat.html).  They're very warm, look fashionable even with a suit, have lots of pockets for stuff, and are roomy enough that they aren't uncomfortable when squeezing into a plane seat.

One thing I also do is I will pack a microfiber blanket in the front pocket of my carry-on.  If I' m in coach, I usually pick the exit row seat - the downside of this, is that on some planes, the coldness will seep through the emergency door.  Kinda scary to think about, but whatever.

Wrap around earmuffs, heavy gloves and scarves are also no-brainers.

In general, yes, I'd be prepared for more delays than usual.  If you're really lucky, you might get on the plane, go de-ice the wings, then wait in line for takeoff, and right before you get there, there's enough ice on the wings to require de-icing again.

From what I can tell on the recruiting side, they are starting to try to push their consulting group, but they are starting from a deficit. Consulting services have become table stakes for Big4 so it wouldn't surprise me if KPMG tries to inorganically boost themselves into the game. 

As for who to acquire, ATK seems like the right size, coverage, and brand.  LEK might be interesting, though I wonder if their relatively solo'd reputation would make it worthwhile. OW could be a possibility if they can wrench it from MMC, although unlikely. Being last does mean pickings are slim. 

The Bain rumors all stemmed from a few years ago when they were having problems with their partnership structure. Too many partners needing to get paid out for their shares upon retiring, which would have left a concerning lack of capital in the firm.  The issue has since been addressed (likely through capital calls and a rewriting of the partnership agreement). Other firms have not had this problem as they require partners to give back shares without / with little compensation.  The Bain name is powerful enough that I highly doubt they would sell themselves. This is in contrast to Booz, who were somewhat on the outside looking in on the top tier and unable to command MBB premiums, and yet lacking the huge economies of scale that drive how Big4 competes in the market.

1. Work hard to leverage your contacts to interviews at Big4 and perhaps MBB.  Also look into the brand name boutiques (LEK, OW, etc.) If you make enough good connections, your GPA may not stop you.  

2.  If it doesn't pan out and you definitely still want to do consulting, then MBA is your best path forward.  If you are at a good/big company (i.e., GE, Microsoft, Macy's) that feeds into MBAs AND you have great responsibilities and clear promotion path, then there might be a lot of value in staying versus a no-name boutique.  MBA adcoms know Macy's.  They may not know Podunk Consultants.  Either way, you'll want to stay for ideally 2 (or at least one) promotions within 3-4 years.

1.  Any awards?
2.  I would round your GPAs up (3.9 versus 3.86 and 3.4 versus 3.39)

2884,"Objectively speaking it's not a terrible strategy on Deloitte's part, even if it does seem a bit tacky for now. Prestige and all that are very important at the MBA level - if they can plant a seed where people start accepting the idea and using the term - even in just one document that gets passed down from class to class - it could be very powerful. 

Many people come into MBA with only a vague idea of consulting overall, so their perceptions can be easily influenced by little things like this. It's further helped by the fact that the collective memory of an MBA ""generation"" is short as each class only stays for two years. 

I'm also not surprised they are trying this. Their approach over the past several years has been all offense. It's actually quite an interesting case study. They moved their interview dates up to compete with MBB (used to be after like the other Big4s).  They offer second year reimbursement and early signing bonuses. They often have some of the more extravagant events (sailing and paintball come to mind). They do lots of closed list and so appear exclusive. Etc, etc. 

As of now, I can count on one hand the number of times we lost a cross offer to Deloitte over the past several years across multiple schools. I think we've lost more to a boutique like Kurt Salmon even. But that said, they have progressed tremendously from a recruiting standpoint. Now, people aim for MBB, but hardly anyone is disappointed that they end up at Deloitte. You couldn't really make that statement even 4,5 years ago. But we'll see what happens with this new approach.

To be completely frank, my thinking was that we have, in effect, been doing AMAs about consulting at universities (we've been invited by 30+ schools in the past 4 months) just because we love PhDs and MSs folks and want o help them and given that I read Reddit every day, thought it'd be cool to do one here.

That said, I think that the feel of the firms will be mostly similar in terms of industry coverage, work/life balance, travel, etc..  There are a few areas where I think there are major differences:

**Exit Opportunities**
When HR is considering two applicants who are pretty much equal except for the name of the firm, they will most likely give the nod to MBB thanks to its prestige.

In general, no industries are off limits from any of the firms.  However, the ""sexy"" companies often end up hiring primarily from MBB because of the reason above.  Everyone wants to work strategy at Tesla, Google, etc., and if HR has to choose between two similar people... MBB wins out.

The only industries where Deloitte will have a much harder time would be Hedge Funds, Venture Capital, or Private Equity.

**Path to Partner**
Thanks to the strict up-or-out system as well as high attrition, the path to partner at MBB is 6-7 years from the post-MBA position.  I believe the range for other firms is more like 7-10 years.  On the down side, the margin for error, and thus the pressure, becomes a major detriment the higher you rise in MBB.

**Compensation**
Compensation trajectory is steeper at MBB.  

**WOW Projects**
I believe that MBB still has a leg up on the most unique work.  When companies are failing and its a question of going concern, they hire MBB.  Its this sense of, if you didn't call the best and things go bad, then you are a poor leader making bad choices; if you did call the best and things still go bad, well, then its not really your fault.  On a related note, the prestige of MBB also attracts the highest profile projects for similar reasons.  When some place like Vatican needs a modernization strategy or the CIA needs to reorg, they call MBB.  

... gotta run, but I'll add some more thoughts later.

One thing I'll note though, is that these are all HUGE firms.  Don't let a few experiences color your perception of the firms.  It's like college - it would be absurd to paint broad strokes to describe everyone.  There are tons of great people at all the firms.  However, there's going to be douches at all of them too, Deloitte included (I believe you've already met one on this thread).  If anything, get to know the office that you are accepted for.  Those will be the people that you build a core around and do social activities with on Fridays or the weekend.",2015-09-09 03:25:11+00:00,cuv83nf,1.0,t3_3k6e7l,4885.0,consulting

3057,"Indeed.  Looking at the guidelines that my firm lays out, it's *theoretically* possible to be a Partner by 29.  But, from my experience / network, I don't know anyone who did it so soon.  Perhaps in new offices / emerging markets its easier, but I imagine it must be really, really difficult to do in the States.  So, ~31-32 is about right.  My personal opinion is that Analysts should go to MBA - I think it's just too hard to control client relationships at 26 years old.  I have no hard data, but it does seem like its a lot harder for those guys to break into Senior Manager / Partner than not.

In terms of working with clients, it's an apprenticeship model the whole way down.  Usually every client is going to have a lead Partner - those are the older grey-haired guys that grew up in the company alongside the client leadership.  So a lot of the ""respect"" will come from this more tenured Partner.  

The more junior / younger Partners will end up being ""paired"" with the next generation of client leadership who are often a little closer in age.  And so the cycle begins again - they grow up through the company together, and etc., etc.

The other thing too is that more and more clients are ex-consultants.  They already know how the gig works, so they don't really care how old we are as long as the job gets done.

From an internal perspective, in terms of working with younger people - you kind of have no choice but to get used to it.  Many Analysts will return to the firm as Senior Consultants and are expected to become a Manager after their first year back.  This makes them 26 year old Managers.  Most people joining out of business school will be 27-30 year old Consultants, and will not hit Manager until 29-32.  Considering you could do up to 6-7 projects per year, you're bound to get at least a few relatively young Managers.  You get over it or you leave.  I imagine it's pretty similar at a Big4.

If anything, I don't think age is not the thing to get insecure about.  Everytime I go to a internal networking event, I suffer from the Imposter Syndrome (i.e., ""Recruiting made a mistake when they let me in."")  There are so many whip-smart / overly accomplished people here that it can get intimidating.

If you don't even find those cool, but perhaps consulting isn't right for you. On the other hand, you never know until you try. The average tenure for a MBB Consultant is just over 2.5 years so it's not like you are signing your life away. 

In terms of hours - we generally work 50-60 hour weeks. I honestly don't feel any diminishing returns and don't really see it on my teams. On a fun team or a cool project, I don't even mind. I feel like people who sign up for this job know that's what it takes.  On a typical 8 week project, there's probably one or two weeks where you work 80-90 hours. It's never ideal, but that's just how it goes. Rarely will you burn at such high intensity for more than two weeks (if ever). 

In terms of 80% time, I'm guessing you heard it in the context of things like BCG PTO or Take Time / Two. These are programs where you take time off between projects. There is no way you can do 80% ON a project. If your team is on crunch time, you can't say ""oh guys, I hit my limit. See you tomorrow"".

While you are there, the compensation and the perks are also pretty good.  Coming out of UG, you make ~$100K all-in, and coming out of MBA, you make ~$190K all-in.  Very few fields can rival those numbers.

At the end other end, there are exit ops.  Because of our constant exposure to challenging problems, its said that one year in consulting is like 3 years in the real world.  It's why you see really young people (say, 30) exit out to Director or VP level roles that would take someone coming up the corporate ladder much, much longer.  I don't think risk or forensics can promise something nearly as attractive.

There's a lot of inertia within large organizations and to have a space that takes it outside by a third party could have value.

You may want to see where the MD alumni from these firms came from - do a search for something like ""in:linkedin.com McKinsey Medical School"".  See what firms will recruit graduates from your tier medical school.  

With an MD, you would likely join at the Consultant level (same as MBAs).  Without an MD, it's likely that you will join at an Analyst level (same as undergraduates).  In terms of how you sell yourself, a lot of it will be similar to any other candidates looking to enter consulting - read the wiki for those details.

3124,"1.  In a lot of ways, the networking events are more for you to learn about the firm than it is for you to try to impress people.  The things you learn about the firm will make you stand out in fit interviews and cover letters.  As you already know, it's a competitive process - every centimeter matters.

2.  Who you talk to should depend on how recruiting works at the firms.  With Deloitte, I am pretty sure that S&amp;O run its own recruiting event; likewise with Tech and HC.  Therefore, it is ideal to only chat with S&amp;O people.  If this is wrong, someone correct me.  Maybe /u/devil0508x could help confirm?

3.  The decision makers are HR, who will do a initial round of filtering (usually by countable stats), and then consultants will do a ~2 minute resume / cover letter screen for those who make it through the screen.  If you have a ""note"" on your file (either positive or negative), that will show up here.

4.  Every firm will note who comes to their events, though honestly, it's more for our future recruiting planning than it is for determining who gets offers.  As long as you show up to a few, then it doesn't make a difference.  I do hear that Deloitte cares a little more about people who go to their events because they don't want to waste recruiting dollars on people who are not really interested and just want to apply as a backup for MBB.  They want those who are truly passionate about Deloitte - alternatively, those that Deloitte have had ample opportunity to convey their differentiation.

3142,"All MBBs now have ""implementation"" though it is markedly different from the Big4 version. Essentially, they are recruiting relatively tenured folks from operating positions in industry to implement the strategies that the Management Consultants have devised. We're talking a team of 2-4 people who sit on steering committees and manage the process - not when like the implementation arms of Accenture or Deloitte bring in a literal army to hash out the process flows, requirements, etc. Sometimes, a MBB Implementation Consultant may even be temporarily assigned to a board position (obviously these are the most tenured folks). MC generally works with the Implementation teams toward the end of the engagement so the handoffs can be seamless. 

There's been a few reasons for this initiative:

1) clients want us to stay on - the era of Consultants just dropping strategy decks and flying out are way over. Companies do want to make sure that the plans are executed to the promised results. Implementation is a way to keep us accountable. 

2) business opportunity - there's plenty of money to be made here. Not only in just extending the engagement, but also having an ear to the ground that can identify new opportunities. 

C) defensive strategy - Big4 and others are trying to encroach on our bread and butter - so we'll do the same to keep them on their toes - and often, insert at a position of higher control

As I understand it, pay is 10-15% less than the corresponding consulting position - but the job is much more stable (9-12 month engagements) and the hours are infinitely better (9a-6p).

3193,"My Partner is a ~50 year old European former doctor who has been with the firm for 15 years.  One of my consultants is a 30+ year old URM successful journalist who decided to switch careers.  Another is a female bioengineer from a fly-over state who in her spare time, helps run a widely recognized healthcare non-profit.  The other, to be fair, is your typical wealthy Harvard undergrad WASP.  Agewise, my on-the-ground team ranges from 20s to mid-30s.  I don't think that varies too much across firms just because age and tenure are so correlated.

Personally, I am a 30s first-generation Asian American whose parents labored in kitchens their whole lives.  I pushed around a dim sum cart all of high school and half of college.  Paid my own way through with scholarships and not sleeping very much.  And here's the thing: I don't even think my story is very unique.  Half of the damn Asians (and there's quite a few of us) here are like that: welfare kids whose Tiger Moms scrapped and scrounged so we could take piano lessons and checked our homework before we could go to sleep.  It's part of why /u/Ansuz07's post really resonated with me.  There are many, many, many kids here who succeeded *in spite* of their hardships, ranging from homelessness, life-threatening illnesses, to not even speak of ""just being poor"".  To not recognize that and assume all MBBers are white bread rich kids would be to do them a disservice.

I suppose our diversity reflects the diversity of a typical target school.  In many ways, we benefit from the hard work of admissions committees - they see diversity as a paramount factor - *assuming an academic benchmark is reached* - and so we get a halo effect.  Someone mentioned consulting as being the ""liberal arts"" of professions, and it's true - we get a wide mix of people who apply, so while business / econ majors do make up a large portion, they are not always the majority.

So I'll posit that every office gets to review candidate resumes that select the office.  HR really coordinates this part of the process instead of consultants, so I have less visibility here.

If a well-qualified candidate chooses a super popular office that is full, then they may either be pushed to a lower ranked office choice, or be interviewed anyway with a final office location to be discussed if they pass the first round.

You'd be surprised - people mess up cases all the time.  While messing up a case is by no means a make or break, it certainly doesn't help.  The criteria you listed are certainly important, but I think you are also missing creativity.  Most case studies have a brainstorming portion - candidates who can make us go, ""huh, that's a really cool idea"" definitely are looked at favorably.

In my opinion, it's always fit that makes the difference.  Everyone hyper-focuses on the case, so everyone does get pretty darn good.  The result is that the difference between the best case interview and the worst case interview is MUCH closer than the difference between the best fit interview and the worst fit interview.  We'd much rather take the gal with a good case interview and a great fit interview than the guy with a great case interview and a average fit interview.

Travel is the default for consultants is travel. There are definitely exceptions, usually in the 'consulting support' category - I'd classify these people as the data analysts, the science specialists ( like at LEK) and others. For the typical consultant, when it comes to project control (based on my MBB experiences), there are basically three levers: team, location, industry. A few nuances:

a) Your firm has an impact on this. Bain is somewhat more locally focused, BCG is somewhat more regionally focused, and McKinsey is somewhat more globally focused. I say somewhat because it's relatively easy to do whatever you want after the first year.

b) Location and Industry Interplay. If you live in DC and want to only do Tech, then you will probably be traveling a lot. That said, if you live in Houston and want to do Oil and Gas, you probably get to sleep in your own bed.

c) At my MBB I feel like there's an equal mix of consultants who prefer one of the three levers. Slight outliers are the younger people like to travel and stick to a team they enjoying working with and the parents who want to stay local.

d) Seniority matters. At the entry level to the Manager level, you can do pretty much whatever. Once you get to the level right below Partner, your life pretty much goes to shit in terms of hours, travel, everything. Before my old boss hit Partner, he was doing NYC -&gt; Tokyo -&gt; Charlotte weekly.

e) At the end of the day you will travel at MBB. Even my financial services colleagues in NYC will be on at least one travel project a year which comes out to about 2-3 months. This is not including flying to visit a random manufacturing plant or retail store in Podunk, Nowheresville.

f) One exception is Private Equity Group (PEG) at Bain. The upside is that those guys don't travel, but the downside is that they sleep under their office cubicles.",2015-08-13 19:05:55+00:00,cu1whrc,2.0,t1_cu1uyvs,2164.0,consulting

I think case coaching makes the most sense if you don't have a structured consulting club at your school with proven success.  For kids from Ivies, etc., a case coach is more of a luxury than a necessity.  Most of my clients end up being PhDs and high-potential non-targets.

I believe case coaching is most important at the beginning.  You should certainly read Case In Point or Case Interview Secrets, and maybe even do 3-4 cases with partners.  After you start feeling slightly comfortable with the whole process, then the case coach can come in and diagnose your strengths and weaknesses, and then give you suggestions on how to improve.  The important thing is that you then have a long enough of a runway to actually implement those recommendations.

A case coach is also useful in the middle of your prep timeline, because by then, we can give you advice on how to improve at the little things.  Certainly, because people hyper-focus on the cases so much, a lot of the times its the little nuances that make the most difference.  All in all, most of my clients do 3-5 cases with me.

3342,"Sounds like you've been doing a great job with meeting people.  Certainly keep that up.  

Are there any consulting-esque opportunities you can seek out at school?  Student-run small business or non-profit consulting come to mind and many schools have them.  You might also look into getting involved in case competitions. As you progress towards full-time, definitely try your hardest to pull that GPA up.  

At least at my MBB, the ""secret happy hours"" are a bit overblown.  When we have invite-only, often times its to talk to people that seem like they might be a good fit, but we simply did not have much interaction with.  People who are not invited could very well also be a good fit, but we already have a good impression of because they made it to more events.  Other times, it could be subject matter specific - sometimes a Partner pops by and just goes, ""hey, I want to chat with anyone who mentioned interest in Ops"".  And other times, its because we're recruiting for a specific skill set, and we're reaching out to people who never even considered the firm.  So don't worry about those.  For us, there is not strong predictive power in regards invite-only events and offers made.

You can keep trying to meet Partners, but just be careful to toe the line between being driven and pushy.  Partners are already busy people and they'll only be getting busier the next few months.  Now that we're in recruiting mode, even more is being asked of them.  So your best bet may just to get some of their time at the events they have at your school.

3434,"Congrats on the offers.  Please move this to the recruiting thread.

I'm going to assume that since you got offers, you already know the differences between the firms *generally* (i.e., partner versus staffer staffing, BCG PTO or McK Barometer, etc.) and are more interested in the offices themselves.  My understanding is that they are more similar than dissimilar, from both a project perspective as well as a cultural one.  Obviously both get the benefit of NYC and its diversity of industries.  If you've been to the offices, you'd know that they're big and somewhat sterile.  You could as easily meet up with a bunch of colleagues or hide in a room all day and see no one.  BCG actually has two offices in the city which somewhat makes it even more complicated to meet up.  McKinsey kinda has the same problem, with the MACC just over the Hudson (though it is primarily for the Jersey consultants).  

I'm sure the firms will put you in contact with tons of people - you'll have more than you can handle once they find out you're a cross offer.  Talking to them is probably your best way forward, and not Reddit.  Just pick the one that you feel more comfortable with.

The SAT score is just part of the screen.  Even after the screens, we have *many* times more resumes than we can offer interviews to.  When we have the resumes, we do read them over and look for specific criteria.  

I think because of the board's fixation on the SAT, the importance of it is overblown.  It's a filter, and looking back at the statistics, it's much less of a brutal filter than the GPA.  Why?  Because for most of the schools that we recruit at, the students are already at a 96%tile.  The bands are much, much tighter than GPA.

Second, this should really be in the recruiting thread.

1) In a head to head comparison for MC, Deloitte S&amp;O is the hands down winner.  They're the ones surging up to take Booz's vacancy.  Many would consider Deloitte ""the best of the rest"" relative to MBB.  EY is growing, but I'm not sure they have a clear direction yet.  They acquired Parthenon a year ago, as well as other smaller MC firms, but have not seemed to do much with it.

2)  Not sure why E&amp;Y isn't on the Vault 50.  That said, they ARE on the Prestige ranking, which is as good a proxy as any (maybe even the most important if you're considering exits).  Here's the list for that:

**Prestige Ranking**

|Rank|Company|Score|
|-|-|-|
|1|McKinsey|8.9|
|2|BCG|8.6|
|3|Bain|8.4|
|4|Deloitte|6.9|
|5|Strategy&amp;|6.8|
|6|Booz Allen Hamilton|6.5|
|7|PWC|6.5|
|8|EY|6.4|
|9|Accenture|6.1|
|10|KPMG|6.0|

3)  The trade-off depends on what you want.  I imagine at a swiftly growing practice, you have more opportunities to take on responsibilities and ride the wave.  Deloitte, by being more established probably has more resources and a clearer path.  You should talk to practitioners for more detail.

4)  I don't do much FS, so I'll let someone else handle this one.  That said, keep plumbing LinkedIn to see where the alumni of these firms ended up.  Or go the other way, and look for employees of firms that you want to join and see where they came from.

2) Resume Review (90s or so, as if I were really screening it)

**Intro**

- Why waste so much space with your residence info?
- Nice strong numbers, especially the GPA for a computer science major
- Why go through all the effort of hiding your university when it says Cornell right there...
- Add when you expect to graduate instead of Present
- I'd rather see GPA above SAT

**Awards**

- I'm very lukewarm on your awards and honors, especially since they are from high school.  I'd even say consolidate it it space-wise
- I'd rather see your Dean's List earlier; move it up to the Education section

**Work**

- I have no idea what this means: *Designed and implemented scheduling algorithms for power delivery to Electric Vehicles (EVs), increasing ability to satisfy demand by over 100%*; demand of what?  what is a scheduling algorithm?  you will have to put this into terms that a layman (or at least a business consultant) will understand
- *Analyzed industry trends for EVs and EV infrastructure; identified universities and tech company campuses as key segments*; what does this mean?  Did you do a benchmarking analysis?  Or did you just do a Google search?  Be more specific.
- *Applied game theory and optimization techniques to model EV adoption trends* - okay, but what impact?
- This section needs a lot of work

**Leadership**

- Your leadership bullets are fine

**Interests**

- I'd move your activities up to the end of the Leadership section
- You might add a Skills line, where you put in languages, technical skills, etc. (just don't put Microsoft Office...)
- You already have a line reserved for Interests... you might as well fill it out so you can cast the widest net possible for connecting with your interviewer

**Other**

- Inconsistency of month abbreviations
- Get rid of those weird colons in your titles
- Not a fan of using a serif font
- Inconsistency of dashes; some dashes are -, while others are --

3512,"Ah I see. There have been things that have both minimized and magnified mirroring.  I'll try to throw in some examples without releasing too much ""behind the veil"" information.

The continued emphasis on technical skills is an attempt to maintain objectivity.  Cases have obviously been around for a while; you either have good structure on a case interview or you don't.  You either crack the case or you don't.  Something a little newer is the emphasis on presentations.  Bain's been doing this for a while and Deloitte and BCG have hopped on recently.  In this exercise, either you give a crisp, structured argument, or you don't.  Either you convince the Partners, or you don't.

Other firms try to take the subjectivity out of fit interviews as well.  Interviewers are prepped with a worksheet that lists specific criteria on it; as the interviewee goes through their story, the interviewer can check off the written criteria.  Since this is consulting, it might even turn into a raw score.

On the other hand, mirroring is not always a bad thing, especially, as you said, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  We know for instance that people from *(confidential background)* stay longer at the firm and get higher ratings.  Why wouldn't we continue hiring such people?

3520,"Recruiting is done the way it is in the majors to avoid the issues you mention in your document.

a) The vast majority of inlet happens at the school level

- Hence, comparisons across school and varying levels of GPA inflation are irrelevant


b) Students among the same school are then looked at from a cohort level

- for undergrads, cohorts could be business majors, science majors, and random majors
- for MBAs, cohorts could be ex-consultants, ex-bankers, military, left-field candidates

c) There are not necessarily quotas by cohort

- all I will say is that we don't want an entire class of military guys, nor do we an entire class of ex-bankers, so there's a balance

d) Within such cohorts, comparison is easy

- For instance, among the competitive UG business major cohort, there's more 3.8+ / 99%tile SATs / student leaders than there are interview spots, so you just take the best.  This is where networking helps - it pushes you over the line if you're on it  
- You also generally have consultants from the same backgrounds doing the screening (i.e., PhDs consultants for PhD apps) so you can really tell which apps are best

e) The fun part is the non-traditional backgrounds.  How DO you compare the Olympic track athlete versus the Julliard pianist?  

- Firms like such candidates because they exemplify extreme positive qualities like leadership, ability to bounceback from failure/injuries, discipline and focus.  In a way, their unique backgrounds cancel one another out  
- So what's left?  As you may have guessed, GPA, test scores, leadership, and networking

f) Once you are past the resume screen, your resume almost (*almost*) becomes irrelevant  

- The decision to hire comes down the specific offices, who simply compare all the candidates who come through the doors (in batches, anyway)

I hope this makes it clear why undergraduate institution, GPA, test scores, leadership, and networking are so highly prioritized above all else.

The burden of proof to disprove his claim, then, is to somehow show that more than 50% of people who ask stupid questions end up very successful.

3530,"For better or worse, my closest friends and ex-roommates are all at MBB and Accenture.  And for better or worse, we talk shop a lot.

At the surface, I really couldn't fault anyone for thinking we are all the same.  And for the most part we are.  We're all in client service after all.  But the differences are definitely there and you'd really only notice them by meeting and talking with consultants.

Some things of the top of my head:

McK and ACN guys work like dogs.  Some terrible combination of boiling the ocean and being perpetually understaffed.  People leave the office at 9 PM on good days.  Bain tries to be hypothesis-driven - leaving at 6 PM would not shock anyone (except the PE team).  BCGers are somewhere in between.  Makes a hell of a difference in quality of life.

Bain wants evangelists; McK and Accenture are fine with mercenaries.  One of my McK friends from NYC liked Barcelona so much that he decided to just move there; he's still part of the NYC office though and no one thinks twice about it.  My Bain friend just dragged himself to Office Happy Hour even with a torn ACL.

Everyone travels, but to varying degrees.  But, McK could have you on a project halfway across the globe with a weekend's notice.  Bain will try their best to have you in the same city.  BCG would aims for somewhere reachable by train and not plane.  Accenture and Deloitte seem to put you anywhere there is need.

At BCG and Bain, staffers have very strong say.  At McK and Accenture, the Partner has the pull.  It means that at the latter firms, you have a lot more ability to direct your own path.  While all four are generalist firms, you could specialize much quicker at McK and ACN (which is exactly what my friends did).

The perks at MBB are something that really makes the ACN guy jealous.  It's the benefit of being private - MBBers can have things like all-expenses paid vacations to Hawaii for the entire office that ACN shareholders would throw fits over.

Something my friend hates about Accenture is that some less scrupulous Partners use Strategy to sell Implementation work, even if its not in the client's best interest.  This sometimes ""contaminates"" the recommendation.  The MBBers were horrified.

This is just what comes to mind - and from the experiences of a small set of people.  I'm sure there are many more differences in culture, resources, and problem solving approaches.  You could confound this with international, regional, and even office-specific factors.  This is why networking is important - it lets you pick out the details that matter to you and gives you the ammo to show it during interviews.",2015-07-27 23:26:54+00:00,cticy15,1.0,t3_3etn0k,5921.0,consulting

So is a 3.8 Penn State + 8 years work experience worth a 3.8 Harvard + 0 experience?  Maybe not in the first year.

Another big one is that you get to pick up a lot more ammo that you can use when you do get to the Partner.

**1.  Be selective and know your own shorthand.**

If the interviewer told me  ""x is a pharm company that sold 22 million units last year"", I would have wrote ""rx, 22M units / yr"".

Your job is not to write down the story verbatim, but instead the key points.  One of the skills this is testing for is whether or not you are able to cut through the noise.  There's some cases where the prompt goes on for like 5 minutes, while only 30 seconds are important - you have to pick up on the difference. 

Other shorthands that come to mind:

- Profits = π
- Revenues = R
- Costs = TC / FC / VC
- Numerical abbreviations = MM, K, etc.
- Tables are your best friend

""Our company is an automobile manufacturer whose profits have been declining for the past 5 years"" 

- -&gt; ""cars, π↓, 5 yrs""

""The industry has grown by 5%, 4%, and 12% over the last three years.""

- -&gt;

|g| | |
|-|-|-|
|1|2|3|
|5%|4%|12|

**2. Don't be afraid to ask the interviewer to repeat!**

It's much better to ask him / her to repeat it to you again than for you to miss out on some important tidbit.  You might imagine how that could entirely blow your case from the get-go.  Some important things not to miss include: 

- Numbers
- Goals
- Time frames

**3.  Practice makes perfect**

The case interview is kind of an artificial exercise.  You may just need some additional practice at this kind of synthesis.  Some things that you might do to improve:

- Get a case book and have a friend (or text-to-voice program if you don't have friends) read you prompts to practice on

**Chances**

- You have an slim shot at MBB - your low GPA is mitigated by a good array of professional and extracurricular activities.  How many people at Babson get interviews?
- I think you have a great shot at everything else

**Resume Tweaks**

- If you have a good SAT, add it
- Your GPA is on the low side for MBB; consider removing it and letting your Honors speak for you; they'll get your GPA information anyway, but at least it won't be front and center.  I'm conflicted on this though
- Provide more detail about your Babson Consulting project - you can even turn it into an entry
- Right align your dates / locations
- This is mumbo jumbo and you need to reword: *Proposed and authored solutions to problem points after identifying over X amount of potential reference issues in existing accounting standards in less than half the anticipated project time*
- You could add how many board members: *Analyzed draft documents to be sent out to board members by providing revisions to clarify the objectives of each document*
- You don't get points for participation - rather, you CO-FOUNDED: *Participated in founding a 13 member student led start-up which harvested and sold locally produced honey*
- For both Babson Honey and Project Stitch, consider instead of using the first line to describe the project, add a italicized line for description.  This will free up your first bullet to be more impactful.  i.e.:

|Babson Honey|Boston|
|-|-:|
|Vice President of Fun| 2008|
|*Babson Honey is a start up which harvests and sells locally produced, organic honey*| 
|- Researched and educated employees on the plight of the bee to be used in developing resulted in the sale of 200 jars of honey with a revenue of $2400 in 2 week

- If you need room, get rid of the Asian Night Board and/or Chiantown entries
- I'm concerned you aren't more involved in your school beyond Bridge - perhaps expand the Babson Consulting into the leadership section?
- Not sure why the location for Babson Bridge is ""Babson College""
- I personally like the reddit thing; you sell it well
- Add the ""Additional Info"" section; see the subreddit wiki for more info

Something you COULD try, is reaching out to consulting staffing agency (do a Google search).  Your experience may widely vary - you could be running solo at a company, you could be staff augmentation for a small consulting firm, etc.  I think in general these firms cater to specific expertise (statistical modeling, technical analysis, etc.) but you could give it a look.

One thing I will note is that even if you do find a contractor job, there's no way you'd be put in front of ""top of the food chain clients"".  If anything, you'd be locked in some back room doing analysis.  I'd much rather have an Analyst who I trust and knows ""the way"" interact with my clients, as opposed to a contractor.

b) If you do not mind working for a boutique, do some due diligence and find the ones that are in your field and/or geography.  They have a much less structured recruiting process and may be happy to take you out of cycle.

c) Follow the instructions here: https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting

Marketing consultants often work for firms that provide consulting services to companies, government agencies, nonprofits, and other organizations. While few large consulting firms focus solely on marketing, **Copernicus Marketing Consulting** and **Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners** are two examples of companies whose revenues are earned in large part from marketing consulting. Large management consulting firms such as **McKinsey**, **A.T. Kearney**, **Bain &amp; Company**, and the *Boston Consulting Group** also have marketing consulting practices. Government agencies, corporations, and nonprofit organizations employ consultants. Approximately 23 percent of management consultants are self-employed.

Although competition for consulting jobs is fierce, there are a variety of ways to launch a career in the field. Joining marketing and consulting associations is a good way to network and to learn about job openings. Contact consulting firms directly to learn if they are hiring You can also network with hiring managers and recruiters at social-media sites such as LinkedIn or at networking events held by associations. Many large consulting firms recruit on campus, and your college’s career services office can provide you with information on recruiting events, advice on crafting a strong cover letter and resume, and tips on prepping for interviews. 
New hires (known as associates, consultants, business analysts, fellows, and various other titles, depending on the consulting firm) at large management consulting firms begin as generalists before obtaining experience in marketing consulting. After several years they become marketing specialists at the firm, move on to work at a boutique marketing consulting firm, or work as internal consultants at a company, government agency, or nonprofit that needs marketing expertise.",2015-07-14 05:19:27+00:00,ct2me1f,1.0,t3_3d5pzg,37123.0,consulting

3679,"Excel is used to simulate business decisions.  Let's take for instance, the decision to launch a new cable subscription service.  Here's how one might break it down:

**Customer Base Model**

- Customer growth from market growth
- Customer growth from share growth
- Customer decline from churn

**Revenue Model**

- Recurring revenue streams
- One-time revenue streams
- Synergy impact

**Cost Model**

- Recurring cost streams
- One-time cost streams
- Cannibalization impact

**Investment Model**

- Profit calculation
- Net present value analysis

**Scenario Model**

- Solver model to maximize NPV given different combinations of assumptions and constraints

Then run it all in parallel assuming multiple devices, multiple services, and multiple geographies.  And also make it flexible enough so that you can change any of the assumptions that feed into it.

This is just one example.  Models end up being complicated and you never really know what you're going to walk into.  One client might want something like the above, the next might want a price elasticity analysis for vegetables, and the next might want to know the optimal number of sales associates in stores.  It ends up being complicated and custom stuff, and so this means you want absolute grasp of the building blocks (formulas) and the mortar (structure).

If you don't already have friends at the firms you are interested in, then two major ways to network:

1) Alumni Network - your best option. Go to www.linkedin.com/alumni and see if you can 'warm call' fellow alumni who are at firms you want to join

2) LinkedIn - your other good option. Just connect with people who seem like they might be favorable to having a chat. You'd be surprised at how willing people will say yes. And, if they are busy, worst case scenario is they click 'delete' and forget about it entirely. Once you do get someone to chat with, obviously don't just jump off with, ""CAN YOU GIVE ME AN INTERVIEW"". Start off telling them that you are really interested in consulting and wanted to learn more from an actual practitioner. Through the course of conversation, try to seamlessly work in a request to connect with someone else. For instance, if they mention that a colleague did something you are really interested in, see if they would be willing to set up an introduction. Then do the same thing with the new person. You'll learn a lot about consulting, the firm, and even build a little network. With each conversation you grow more knowledgeable and you'll even start speaking like you already work there. Each person you speak with becomes more and more impressed. At some point, when you feel comfortable, start asking what they think the best 'next step' is for someone given your position.

Ultimately it'll come down to how you perform at ATK.  If you're a rockstar who ends up working on the firm's top projects, you'll beat out the run of the mill MBBers, not even to speak of those who get CTL'd and just did projecct management.  If you're charismatic, you'll beat out the many MBBers who end up focusing on models and have a hard time managing clients.  If you take on leadership activities outside of work, that'll set you apart from any who don't.  This'll be true for both MBA and future prospects.  

I will say that ATK, because of its specialty in sourcing, procurement, may end up pushing you towards this bucket.  I would tell you to go on LinkedIn, look at the companies that you want to work for in the future, and see where those people worked prior.

Regardless, ATK is a great firm - if you accept there, just focus on doing your best, learning how to excel at the position above you, and positioning yourself for the future.

- Good content, nice job
- Great that you quantified things
- Your resume seems a bit tailored towards TC - if this is what you want to do, then great; if you are targeting MC, I'd change a few things (see below)

Formatting Issues:

- Right align all of your dates
- You can put your phone, email, Linkedin all on the same line for more space
- There's some debate on this, but my MBA career center always insisted that we put everything in the past tense; I tend to agree with this after having reviewed tons of resumes.  Just reads better.

Content Issues:

- If you got particularly large amounts for your scholarship, you can add that in
- Get rid of Microsoft Office
- You can probably get rid of English skill also depending on where you are applying to / from
- Swap Finance and Accounting
- The Wharton School; no such thing as the Wharton School of Business

MC Tailoring:

- I'd leave out SAP; that alone might get you tossed in the TC bucket
- Any terms like ""migration project"" or ""supporting documentation"" need to be... adjusted
- Put computer building further down the interest list
- Potentially get rid of the Tech Consulting competition
