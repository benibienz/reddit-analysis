Given many consultants are sponsored, I'm not surprised to see that the Consulting &lt;&gt; Consulting percentage is fairly high.  That said, half of consultants do end up leaving after MBA.

I think I've got a decent start below, but would love to include anything else the community might think of.  Looking forward reading your ideas!

**Staffing**

- There are four major levers for staffing: function, industry, team, location – when you start, it is unlikely to be able to pull all 4 levers at the same time, so prioritize which is most important to you

- You have the highest acceptable margin for error when you are early in tenure, so that is the best time to take risks or try something different

- Signals of a harder project: first project with client, due diligences, client is a former consultant, brand new Manager, Senior Manager on cusp of partnership

- The staffing game is played around the clock – even if you are currently staffed, making the right connections will help you get on that dream project down the line

 - Read the Wiki for tips about life on the bench

**Starting a Project**

- Read the SOW and clearly understand the ultimate goal of the project

- Read as much as you can about the client and industry!  Use Google News, 10Ks, internal knowledge sites, and research reports

- Set up Google Alerts for the client, its major competitors, and the industry

- Clarify with yourself what you want out of the project – if seeking a promotion, it is helpful to look at your firm’s promotion criteria

- Have a team introduction where everyone shares their strengths, desired areas for improvement, work habits, and lifestyle needs – pay extra attention to those of your Manager’s!

- Obtain your Manager’s / Partners’ favorite decks – this will allow you to stylistically mirror what they already like

- Obtain the organizational chart of the client (or at least draw one for the key stakeholders you will be working with)

- Take the lead on planning team dinners and events

- Set up feedback sessions in your Manager’s calendar - feedback is critical to improving your performance

 

**Slides**

- Before opening PowerPoint, write the storyline on paper

- After writing the storyline but before opening PowerPoint, write the leads/taglines for each slide on paper

- After writing the storyline and leads/taglines, but before opening PowerPoint, draw out your slide deck on paper

- After drawing your slide deck on paper but before opening PowerPoint, review it with your Manager

- Make sure all graphs, axes, units are clearly labelled

- If creating a deck by committee, align with entire team on abbreviations, units, and all other stylistic concerns

- Learn and memorize shortcuts!  A tool like KeyRocket can help

- Start compiling a folder of killer slides

- Proofread – after you’ve finished, proof read it again.

- Make sure all numbers across your deck tie together

- If your firm has slide production, outsource as much as humanly possible to them – before going to sleep every night, consider what they could help you do to make life easier

- Check your outsourced slides when they return

 

**Modeling**

- Fully agree with team and client on the desired outputs of the model

- Before opening Excel, sketch out the model structure and how it will link together – use a separate sheet of paper for each tab that you envision - review it with your manager 

- Keep all raw data files together and untouched in model – modify as needed on new tabs

- Keep all assumptions together (on one tab, or a set of assumptions tabs) and source them

- Do not hard code anything within formulas!

- Within the model, create a separate column for “units”

- Index / Match is a much more flexible and faster way to do lookups

- Early on, anchor yourself on several key outputs for ongoing sense checks – as you develop the model further, refer back to the numbers to see if they have changed or not

- Learn and memorize shortcuts!  A tool like KeyRocket can help

 

**Client Interaction**

- Before going into any meeting, visualize and understand the desired outcome

- Don’t be late

- Understand who you are meeting with – their role, their expertise, their politics, how much they know about the project, how much they should know about the project

- It is better to lead the client to the right answer or help the build it, as opposed to giving it to them

- Be in the mindset of a good client advisor – clients are not always right, and it is our job to tell them so in an appropriate way; earlier in your career, you should go through your Managers first before engaging the client

- Open ended questions are much more useful than binary questions – questions that make clients introspective are even more useful (‘what if’-type questions)

- Look out for opportunities to connect clients with the firm’s expertise

 

**Travel**

- See wiki article

 

**Tech**

- See wiki article


EDIT:

Other thoughts:

- Check-in and check-out with your Manager daily

- Send an 'end-of-week' summary email to your manager

- If you are unsure about something critical, form an opinion but ask for clarification from your Manager - do not assume!  If you must assume something you are uncomfortable with, note it as clearly as possible

- Go to the office on Fridays and try to get involved in office activities to build your network",consulting,Tips for new starters (looking for your ideas),https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/4i0vs9/tips_for_new_starters_looking_for_your_ideas/

Thanks for your patience.  As I'm sure many of you know, the job can be unpredictable in its demands.  While I am not providing accompanying commentary, I think that a lot of the takeaways should be pretty apparent and mostly predictable.  Feel free to discuss anything you find interesting!

---------

In regards to the free response section, we were heartened to see that most believe that the sub has made steady progress even if there were bumps in the road.  However, there were some takeaways that I did want to highlight and open discussion around:

**Themes around sub improvement**

- Too much negativity

- Too US-centric

- Not enough content on consulting lifestyle

My own personal response to these is pretty similar: the sub is what you make out of it.  In regards to negativity about consulting, yes there are people who complain more than others and anonymous forums are great places to blow off steam.  At the same time, I saw in the survey that &amp;amp;amp;gt;80% of people would recommend consulting to others.  So, to that vast majority, free free to sound off and bring that positivity to the forefront.  

With the sub being too US-focused, that is simply going to be a reflection of the sub being ~90% based in the US. Nevertheless, don't let that stop you from posting information that you find relevant and might resonate with other non-US readers (or US ones as well!). Similarly for those who think there is not enough content on consulting lifestyle - please start or contribute to threads that you think might be more interesting to you.  Given a number of factors, the default of this sub will trend towards recruiting and those looking to learn more about consulting.  Recently there have been a few posters starting conversations about challenges at work or favorite / least favorite things about the job, and I think that is a step in the right direction.

**Suggestions on sub features** *(but, feel free to talk about any others as well)*

I've done a lot of coaching over the years, and sometimes, I feel like this topic of the ""happiness treadmill"" is something that is as valuable, if not even more so, than any insight on interviews, cases, or essays or anything like that.  It is especially relevant for people in our field as consulting does tend to draw a specific type that's been referred to as ""the insecure overachiever"".  
 
#Concept

The happiness (hedonic) treadmill is the idea that people generally have the same happiness setpoint for life. Specific events do not play as big of a role in the long term as many originally thought.  Instead, the best way to increase long-term happiness is to pursue activities that move the setpoint.

##Example Of Being On The Treadmill

It's recruiting season and you think: ""If I get into consulting, I will be so happy!""  And then, thanks to your hard work, you get into a great boutique and are ecstatic.  

But pretty soon, all the people you meet are also consultants, some of which are from more prestigious firms and some of which have shinier cars / bigger homes / etc.  And so you feel a little less happy than you did before and you think to yourself, ""If I got into McKinsey, that woudl be it!  I will finally be happy!""  

And so you network and slave on and finally, work your way into the firm!  You are over the moon and all your friends are proud of you.  But after a while, you get used to it.  Being at McKinsey doesn't make you as happy anymore.  And then one day, you find out one of your old colleagues had left the boutique and ended up being COO of UberLyftCar and so you think to yourself...

#Background#

In a seminal study on happiness^1 , researchers interviewed three groups of people: Lottery Winners, Catastrophic Accident Victims, and Control Group.  They assessed:

- how happy they felt before the events
- how happy they felt at the time
- how happy they think they would feel a few years in the future

What they found was that peoples' happiness would spike due to events, but over time, their happiness would normalize close to their original happiness setpoint.  For lottery winners, their sizeable wealth enabled them to enjoy new pleasures, but this in turn made the old pleasures less treasured.  Likewise with the paraplegics; mundane activities are now seen as more valuable because of their current state. In both cases, over time the profound emotions associated with the original event fade away as the individuals adapt to their current situation.

#Getting Off The Happiness Treadmill

##1. Know who you want to be

Stop chasing money for happiness.  Stop comparing yourself to others.  Most people dream of earning tons of money so that they can buy a huge mansion and have several luxury cars. But, as lottery winners can testify, a big house and all those other fancy things can only satisfy you to a certain extent. Instead of knowing what you want to possess it is more productive to know exactly where you want to be. **Have a goal or a vision for your life.** And then, let this mission be what you measure yourself against.  Aim to be the person that goes to bed being satisfied knowing that they are progressing on something really personally important, instead of being the person that just goes to bed trying to make a lot of money or to impress others. ^2,3


##2. Maintain a proper balance in life

We all tend to forget that happiness emerges out of balance. As a consequence, we sacrifice the valuable time we could spend with our family in order to acquire material possessions in the hope of gaining happiness by doing so.  We also tend to forget that too much of a thing can quickly diminish its positive aspects. For this reason, try to establish a harmonious balance in your life. 

**Make sure to invest time in your hobbies, friends and family just as much you invest in your professional endeavors.**  Realize that materialism can only provide you with short-term happiness. Don't fall into the trap of working 60 hours weeks in a job you dislike to buy things for a family you don't see. ^2,3

##3.  Self reflect to understand yourself

Meditate on what it is that contributes to your happiness. **Once you have realized the major factors that make you happy you are able to aggressively sort out anything else that does not make a contribution.** ^2,3

##4. Take time to help others

**Knowing that you have helped another person live a better life is a profound experience.** Scientists of the University of British Columbia and the Harvard Business School found that helping others can have a significantly positive impact on your own happiness. The researchers found that spending money on others predicted greater levels of happiness.  Another study found that volunteering has the same impact: ""People who volunteer tend to have higher self-esteem, psychological well-being, and happiness. All of these things go up as their feelings of social connectedness goes up. It also improves their health and even their longevity."" ^2,4

##5.  Appreciate the little things
One way to do this is through a happiness journal.  Every day before you go to bed, you write one sentence about something that made you happy on that day.  It takes 2 minutes, but it forces you to think about the sweet things that happen on a day-to-day basis.  The days are long, but the years are short - writing one sentence a day is fairly easy and at the end of the year, it adds up to a marvelous record.  If not a journal, then at the very least, take some time before bed to reflect on the positives that happened during the day, no matter how small. ^5

----------------

In the end though, happiness is art and science. Given the demands of consulting, it may be something we struggle with more than others. 

Personally, just being exposed to this perspective on happiness was a bit of a relevation for me.  I grew up under the watchful eye of a ""Tiger Mom"" - and so, rewards always came from successes.  There was always another grade to attain, another award to strive for, another brand to add to my resume.  And over time, it became ingrained in me to constantly seek the next achievement on the horizon.  On one hand, I am forever grateful - after all this drive has pushed me to where I am today.  But on the other hand, it was exhausting - and it wasn't until I began learning about these happiness topics that I realized how important proper balance is.  It's all still a work in progress, but at the very least, concepts like ""have a personal long-term vision"" have forced me think about what it takes to attain and maintain sustainable happiness. 

I could probably share much more on this topic, but am also super interested in hearing about how others have dealt with the pursuit of happiness in their lives.

We hope you all had wonderful Thanksgiving breaks for our US members and... well, weekends for our international members.

First, we apologize for the poor launch of the rules last week. It is clear from the community reaction that we made mistakes on how it was communicated and implemented. As our sub continues to grow tremendously, we, as mods, are also learning how to be the best agents for this community.

As we move forward, and as was suggested by many members of the community, we wanted to have an open roundtable on the rules. The goal here is to ensure we have a set of written and public rules which are consistent with the way that the subreddit has generally already been run. We have put together a draft and would welcome any and all constructive feedback in this thread.

12/4/2015: We'll be leaving this up until the end of the weekend for other comments before unstickying it and updating the sidebar and submissions page. Further tweaks can certainly happen if warranted, but we'd like to get any wholesale changes out relatively soon.
-------------------

# Vision: To be a welcoming place for all topics surrounding the consulting industry.

## Posting Guidelines:

**Rule 1. Posts should be relevant to consulting or to consultants.**

**Purpose:** To maintain the purpose of this subreddit, posted content should be related to the consulting industry or of interest to consultants. 

**Guidance:** This is a deliberately low bar and can cover a wide variety of topics, from news about specific firms, to working in consulting, to industry happenings, to lifestyle, to career planning. The rule's intent is to keep the front page on topic.  Weekly Free Talk Threads are certainly still welcome.

**Rule 2. Recruiting posts should go into the stickied thread.**

**Purpose:** Recruits seeking information are welcome, but /r/consulting is foremost for current and former consultants. To strike a balance, a sticked post was created and we request that all questions about the recruitment process be submitted there. 

**Guidance:** The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics that should be submitted to the recruiting post:

- how to break into consulting / questions about the recruitment process
- seeking information about specific firms
- resume / cover letter / document reviews
- networking advice
- fit or case interview advice
- comparing offers

Recruitment related posts on the Front Page may be removed without notice. Recruits should also read the Wiki and do a search before posting - the vast majority of recruiting-related questions have been asked and answered time and time again.

**Rule 3. Do not post illegal content or confidential materials.**

**Purpose:** All illegal content, as well as promotion of illegal behavior, is prohibited. As an additional reminder, as consultants we often have exposure to sensitive information from clients or our own firms. Do not, under any circumstances, disclose such information.

**Guidance:** Submissions / comments containing confidential information or promoting illegal activity will be removed.

**Rule 4. Be a professional and be constructive / Don't be an asshole and don't be abusive**

**Purpose:** /r/consulting strives to be a welcoming community to everyone in the field or interested in the field. As professionals, we should hold ourselves to a higher standard of conduct, manners, and courtesy. 

**Guidance:** Users showing abusive, belittling, or harassing behaviours will be first warned and banned for repeated offence. Likewise, users who encourage such behaviors or promote unnecessary drama will also be first warned and banned for repeated offence. This rule is necessary because this negative behavior has been increasing as the sub grows and has led to a less-than-welcoming atmosphere. A non-exhaustive list of actions that would violate this rule include:

- doxxing or provision of any personal information
- encouraging or inciting violence
- threatening, harassing, or bullying users, or encouraging others to do so
- impersonating someone in a misleading or deceptive manner
- promoting 'ego-measuring' contests between firms

If a post is terrible, first consider down voting and moving on. No, users are not going to be punished for telling someone about the physical challenge at the case interview or for sarcastic comments. But if someone derails an otherwise decent thread, then they are violating this rule. The rebuttal process is the same as it's ever been: mods are always reachable through mod mail and will be happy to explain decisions or reverse them if we are in the wrong.

-----------------------


Again, we welcome your feedback, comments, and suggestions. We will frequent and respond on this thread very often over the week, so please leverage it for all discussions related to the rules.",consulting,/r/consulting Rules Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/3uvo21/rconsulting_rules_discussion/

Applications: 500

Round 1 Invite: 80

Round 2 Invite: 30

Offers: 12

Average GPA of Those Receiving Offers: 3.78

Average SAT Math of Those Receiving Offers: 767

Average SAT Verbal of Those Receiving Offers: 758

-----------------

People pointed to many things they disliked, like use of test scores or mirroring bias.  Some hate the lack of transparency when it comes to networking.  /u/zip117 even called the whole process 'primitive'.  That said, I did not hear too many alternatives.

**So given that, minds of /r/consulting, how would YOU structure the recruiting process differently?**

Some things to keep in mind:

a) Even within target schools, we have many, many, many more applicants than we do interview spots

- If you use McKinsey as an example ([see this article](http://info.theladders.com/career-advice/the-secret-to-getting-hired-at-mckinsey)) - they received 225,000 applications and made offers to 2,200 of them (1% conversion).

b) We are a business, not a charity

c) We have finite resources, especially consultant time.  Just a single interview batch at a single school costs the firm at least a quarter of a million dollars in terms of billable time

Who knows, maybe we can feed some good changes to the Powers That Be!",consulting,How would YOU do recruiting?,http://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/3faacd/how_would_you_do_recruiting/

Would be interested to hear how your firm is similar or different.  Perhaps in a few days, I could summarize and post in the Wiki too.

**Process**

a) The vast majority of inlet happens at the target school level

- Why?  A few reasons. First, the firms are using the schools as filters for the top calibre students.  Second, the quality of education is expected to be top notch.  Third, the students will have a network of similarly successful people.  And lastly, everyone wants to continue their school's legacy at the firm

- Hence, comparisons across schools (i.e., Harvard versus Emory) and varying levels of GPA inflation are irrelevant


b) Students among the same school are then looked at from a cohort-esque level

- for undergrads, cohorts could be business majors, science majors, and random majors

- for MBAs, cohorts could be ex-consultants, ex-bankers, military, left-field candidates

c) There are not necessarily quotas by cohort

- all I will say is that we don't want an entire class of military guys, nor do we an entire class of ex-bankers, so there's a balance

d) Using such cohorts, comparison is easy

- For instance, among the competitive UG business major cohort, there's more 3.8+ / 99%tile SATs / student leaders than there are interview spots, so you just take the best.  This is where networking and strong indicators of interest (case competitions, pro-bono consulting, etc.) help - they push you over the line if you're toeing it  

- You also generally have consultants from the same backgrounds doing the screening (i.e., PhDs consultants for PhD apps) so you can really tell which apps are best

- So what's important if you are in a typical cohort?  GPA / Tests / Leadership / Networking

e) The fun part is the non-traditional backgrounds.  How DO you compare the Olympic track athlete versus the Julliard pianist?  

- we like such candidates because they exemplify extreme positive qualities like leadership, ability to bounceback from failure/injuries, discipline and focus.  In a way, their unique backgrounds cancel one another out  

- So what's left for non-traditional cohorts?  As you may have guessed, GPA / Tests / Leadership / Networking

f) Once you are past the resume screen, your resume almost (*almost*) becomes irrelevant  

- The decision to hire comes down to the specific offices, who simply compare all the candidates who come through the doors (in batches, anyway)

I hope this makes it clear why undergraduate institution, GPA, test scores, leadership, and networking are so highly prioritized above all else.  They end up being the great equalizers.",consulting,Recruiting Approach (Why GPA / Tests / Leadership / Networking Are So Important),http://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/3eyqjn/recruiting_approach_why_gpa_tests_leadership/
