1,"What a race yesterday! First off, I'd like to congratulate all of our champions on a job well done.

Secondly, there are literally no words to describe that fateful restart with 10 to go yesterday. I was pulling really hard for Carl Edwards to win last night, and it really sucked that he lost the way that he did.

Speaking of Carl, this life long Jeff Gordon fan has been searching for a new favorite driver for almost a year now. The way that Carl Edwards handled the aftermath of his crash and losing the championship yesterday with class, grace, and sportsmanship was amazing, and deserves to be used as an example to all. Carl Edwards has officially made himself a new fan out of me. 

Carl, if you're reading this, I want you to go out and win the championship next year, and I'll be watching, cheering on my new favorite driver in car #19.",2016-11-21 15:30:58+00:00,da9kxx7,1,t3_5e4fp7,1713,NASCAR

Then the next week at Phoenix Gordon is eliminated by one freaking point after Ryan Newman basically wrecked Kyle Larson to advance to Homestead.

303,"I had hoped that when NASCAR made a rule saying that drivers had to pick one series they were eligible for points in, that this would eliminate Buschwhackers. It did for the most part, but the worst offenders (Logano, Keselowski, and especially Kyle) are still doing it. I understand why they do it, Kyle says that running in Xfinity and Trucks helps him prepare for Cup races, but someone as talented of a race car driver as Kyle is, he shouldn't have to. 

I'm going to make something else perfectly clear, I have no problem with guys like Kyle Larson, Chase Elliott or Ryan Blaney competing in Xfinity, because they are not there every single week, and when they are, they're doing it for the sake of gaining experience. Nor do I have a problem with Dale Jr doing it once or twice a year. What I have a problem with is Cup drivers coming to lower series and dominating them, like what Kyle Busch is doing.

I think that the best way to get rid of Buschwhackers once and for all is to make it completely not worth the while for Cup guys to run in the lower series. I think they should do the following:

1. Cup drivers get no pay when they run in the lower series.

2. Owners who have Cup drivers behind the wheel will receive no owners points and no money for that race.

This would obviously have to be adjusted, but giving the owners and drivers who Buschwhack as little to gain and as much to lose as possible should help curb this problem and make the Xfinity and Truck Series what they should be: Young and rising stars of NASCAR competing against each other.",2016-04-11 20:06:19+00:00,d1yvrjx,1,t3_4ec4ek,4732,NASCAR

321,"Here's mine:

Last year, I went to the SpongeBob SquarePants 400 at Kansas Speedway. I got there early, and found out that Kevin Harvick was going to be at his merchandise hauler signing autographs. After buying a program for Kevin to sign, I got in line. Standing next to me is a man and his son, who appears to be at most 10 years old. 

The two of them are getting their stuff ready to be signed, as the dad pulls out a die-cast car and hands the kid a picture. 

As Kevin comes towards us, the kid holds the picture out for Kevin to sign. It is as this point that I see the picture in all of its glory.  

This. http://ci.memecdn.com/682/5159682.jpg

Kevin takes the picture, sees what‚Äôs on it, and starts laughing. He says in between laughs, ‚ÄúI was wondering when I was going to sign this picture.‚Äù He signs the picture, then takes off his hat, signs it, and puts on the kid‚Äôs head. Kevin tells the kid to ‚Äúkeep being awesome‚Äù, gives him a fist bump, and then continues signing autographs. That kid walked away with the biggest smile on his face, and so did his dad. And that is my best driver story.

In more recent years, we haven't had quite as many cars or quite as many people in the stands.
