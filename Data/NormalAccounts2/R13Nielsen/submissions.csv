Most teams threw some hats or something similar into the crowd. 

And then there was Jimmie Johnson. Jimmie walked out with a helmet in his hands. Not a cheap replica, but a REAL racing helmet, which had his autograph on the visor. And Jimmie goes and gives it to a little kid who was in the front row at driver intros. Racing helmets aren't cheap, so that was really cool of Jimmie to give one away like he did, and he most likely made a new fan in that kid.

I don't have a picture of Jimmie doing this, but it was on the live broadcast.",NASCAR,"When I rewatched the All-Star race, I noticed something quite cool.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/4klne6/when_i_rewatched_the_allstar_race_i_noticed/

The best driver can only do so well in bad equipment, and having the best car won't do much good if your driver is not very good. Also, as Martin Truex Jr. very much knows recently, you need a bit of luck sometimes to get the desired result.

With that in mind, what's the car/driver/luck ratio in NASCAR? I think the ratio varies depending on the track, but I generally believe that the ratio is around 45% car, 45% driver, and 10% luck. The biggest variation of this would be at the plate tracks (Daytona, 'Dega), where it's more like 33% car, 33% driver, and 34% luck.

What do you guys think?

That's 16 full seasons. He's won the Daytona 500 twice, he's won the All-Star Race, the Bud Shootout, and has been the sport's most popular driver for more then a decade.

But now, Junior is 41, and will be 42 by the end of the year. He's getting married soon. I really don't think he's going to race into his 50's like Mark Martin did. Dale Jr has accomplished quite a lot in his career, but there's one big thing left, winning a championship.

I think that Dale Jr will race for another 5-8 years. However, I did have a different thought. I think since the last thing Junior has to prove is that he's a Cup champion, and considering that Gordon and Stewart both retired/retiring in their mid-40's, that if Dale Jr finally gets that championship, he'll call it a career right then and there and hang up the helmet. Even if he does it this year.

That's my opinion on it, do you agree? Disagree? Would you be content if Dale won a Cup title and then retired? Discuss!
