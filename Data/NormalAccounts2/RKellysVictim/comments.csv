I Sly Cooper'd my ass out the bed, then I ran downstairs; its 7:00 AM, The iPhone 4 box is just chillin' there. I grab it and go outside to put it in my car trunk. Later in the day I threw it away. For the following month and a half, I did not smoke and stayed Lowkey and chilled with my mom on the weekends. I chaffered for her around and shit (aunts house, Costco, just regular shit bruh). So my times goes up and I say fuck it, buy the gram, and the a joint cone. Leave it in my glove department ; which is on the lower left side of my steering wheel. The following morning, I drive to Seattle to just chill, smoke, and go to Barnes n' Noble. After parking my car around Kent Industrial area, I look in the little department and see that my joint is gone. The Bitch disappeared God dammit.
 

Shit happened a year and a half ago, and I still drive this car, and always ponder where my joint went. I hypothesized that it probably fell out when it rolled into the engine area.",2016-02-03 18:51:07+00:00,czmk3an,1.0,t3_43zhi5,25116,AskReddit

143,"It's 2001, I'm roughly around 5 years young. It was a very hot Saturday, and my parents decided to take the family to South Center Mall (Tuckwila,WA). While shopping around with my family I got separated from the herd. I don't recall exactly how it happened but it happened. As a 5 year old wandering around a pretty decent sized mall, a fellow Somalian female Security Guard in her 20's saw me and recognized Somaliness. She decided to be my guardian until we found my parents. After about 20 minutes of just sitting around and no parents in sight, I realized that if I escaped with some swiftness I would be able to solve my problem of separation. I escaped and embarked on my journey to where my father had parked the car. After finding the car, I sat down between it and the car parked next to it and waited. 30 minutes go by of sitting in the hot sun, I spot my family walking over and I dash out of my position to embrace them.
