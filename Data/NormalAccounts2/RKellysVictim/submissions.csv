I agreed, so he sat down. About 5 minutes later this beautiful girl by the name of Monique walks by and takes a seat at a bench about 10 feet away from me and Dwayne.

So Dwayne starts talking about how good looking she was, and that he would tap that and what not. Dwayne then decides to call her over to come sit with us. She responded by telling us to come sit with her at the table. Mind you at halfway through rolling my last joint, so Dwayne goes ahead and sits with her. After i finish rolling it, i meet with them at the table. I ask if she smoked, and she told me she did so i sparked it up.
In the begging Dwayne was doing most of the talking/hitting on her, which she was not very responsive to so I started to ask more about her like what she does for a living, what she likes. She told me she was from the east coast, and goes to school in Seattle. 

 So we kept talking for about 20-25 minutes, and it wasn't small talk we talked about what she goes to school for (filmmaking/production), Tarantino movies, her heritage, and just a bunch of other things. Well by this point she had to leave because she had plans with someone else. So i didn't ask for her # because Dwayne already did, and i was thinking it would be awkward so i didn't. But then Dwayne decided to give it to me instead because he noticed the way she was looking at me, and he reasoned she was more interested in me then she was with him. So i took down her #, and I took Dwayne's # down as well. Then i got up, said my peace and left.

So should i hit her up, or let i go?",askwomenadvice,Indirectly Getting Her #.,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/55buss/indirectly_getting_her/

After hiding it, I kept on my path but on my way home I saw her just laying in the grass using her phone, and maaaaan those yoga pants she had on made her look like she had a phat ass. I walked past her, but she didn't look up as her eyes were glued to her phone so I said fuck it and kept walking. Maybe after a minute of telling my self she was probably like 16 or something. I got hit with the realization that if I get rejected that's probably the best place for it to happen as no one was around. So I turned around and went back. 
I introduced myself and asked for her name. She gave it to me, and went back to using her phone. So I sat down beside her, and asked her age(she was 21), whether she was in college,  and if she was from around the area. That's when she got off her phone and actually started to seem receptive to what I was saying. Then, after asking about what she was interested in she started going on about climate change, and about turtles repopulating in the Galapagos. That's when I made a lil joke about sex, and she started laughing, and started playing with her hair and shit. So I went in for the kill and asked for her number so that I could take her out, or hang out. And her response was ""she would if her phone was working properly""  -__-. So I got up, shook her hand and told her I hope she has a great day, and continued on my way home. Even though I got rejected I was hella satisfied with myself. I had a huge smile on my face all the way till I got home. ",seduction,A PNW rejection,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/54v28n/a_pnw_rejection/
