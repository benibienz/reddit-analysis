What is important is that sin separates us from God. Whether someone decides to murder or lust for another woman, They've broken God's law and have sinned. 

And whether or not you've committed a more or less serious sin, the end result is the same: That you have separated yourself away from God and will face punishment in hell.

You have a variety of different cards for different circumstances with a good elixir average of 3.8.

It's most likely not your cards but the way you're playing. Try to keep an elixir advantage. (spend less elixir than they spent to stop a push) Learn to kite and build up pushes while stopping theirs and using yours to counter push.  

I'm not saying you're a bad player. I'm just saying the deck is mostly fine in its current format and that instead of looking to these cards maybe look into your replays and look for instances where you did a misplay. 

Learn how to perform strategies like kiting to help make you a better player.

The problem is there is no hard counter for the royal giant other than possibly inferno tower. Other troops may kill the royal giant but not until he guarantees a couple hundred hitpoints on your tower, by which then is too late.

345,"Learn, know, and research your prices if you have to. Always learn the items of the value beforehand and figure out the price you can actually sell it for instead of just looking at the price. Ex. You can buy a knife for 84% but if you won't be able to sell it for 87%, it's not really a worthwhile trade",2016-01-27 15:17:40+00:00,czdvyer,3.0,t1_czdqfl6,12775.0,GlobalOffensiveTrade
346,"1. The way to make most profit per trade is to not try to get as many trades as possible, but to try to make trades you can guarantee profit. Only take trades you know you can make 5-10k profit and be open downgrading and overpaying as it is a very easy way to make money by selling the downgraded items for keys.

2. The best way to look for deals is probably to just spam F5 on the new section on globaloffensive trade and be fast as possible. You could also try looking on trade servers and try looking (really hard) on lounge. There's good deals on lounge but it just takes some searching

3. The best way to find prices is to just use the search bar and to set the activity feed to a day or a week if you're desperate and there really is little or no information. ",2016-01-27 04:19:09+00:00,czdhgkj,1.0,t3_42uz0x,10274.0,GlobalOffensiveTrade

779,"Close Chrome

Open ~/.config/google-chrome/Local State in a text editor.
Search for ""protocol_handler"".

To make Chrome ask you how to handle a specific protocol again, 
remove the line corresponding to that protocol in the list of excluded 
schemes.

Save and exit.

EDIT: An answer I found on google, it's the one that helped me :c, basically find the local state file, open in notepad, delete the part with steam in it

EDIT 2: also make sure your google chrome is ACTUALLY close when doing this, make sure it's not left open in the taskbar with chrome left to ""Leave chrome running in the background""
