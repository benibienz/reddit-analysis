Before we start, I would like to say I'm not new to the game. I've been playing since early February. I'm a level 9 running 8.5/6/3s in early 3000's and I **do not** have a legendary  

The first thing is that everyone feels entitled to be in arena 8. ""It's not fair that A8 can buy legendaries from the shop."" Well isn't that the point to climb up? To have access to better/more cards? Arena 8 is the final arena game, it's **supposed** to be difficult to get into but recently this sub has this idea where they think ""I deserve to be in arena 8."" Then there this thing where someone makes a post ""Oh I made it to legendary without one."" Everyone says ""Oh nice, congrats,"" then go on to the next thread genuinely thinking ""Damn, if I had a legendary then I'd be in arena 8 too!"" 

I think the problem is the attitude aspect, when you see a arena 8 without a legendary, you're supposed to have a sense of jealously and inspiration that helps you want to do that too, instead people are looking for excuses and reasons why they are unable to and instead of changing decks around or trying to improve, they often just go to Reddit and complain about having no legendaries; this leads to my second issue where everyone feels entitled to have s legendary.

Their mindset is that ""everyone should have a legendary because there are some lucky individuals. Wait a second, you're playing a game and complaining ""I don't have some of the best cards in the game so I can't win."" shouldn't your mindset be ""I don't have those cards so I'll adapt and change my play style and deck so I'm able to win."" People complain about all these legendaries in A7 but don't realize every other game in A8 has a legendary; so what? Outplay them, change your deck; make it more versatile. They give all these ideas where f2p can get more legendaries and then say ""with that legendary I can get to A8."" I don't think that most people realize that if everyone had legendaries that wouldn't solve anything, that would just widen the gap between A6 and A7 and newer players would be complaining about that too. Secondly, if **everyone** had a legendary, then two things; 1. Legendaries would no longer be special or rare which their purpose 2. It would still be difficult to get into A8. If you give those 2900 to early 3000 players who got to legendary without a legendary you realize the skill cap would increase. Sure the p2w/f2p gap would shrink but the early A8 players just got a hell of a more cards to play with. These players with legendaries would just keep knocking down people stuck in 2700-2800 with legendaries. Giving everyone a legendary isn't going to solve anything, it's not like there's a huge paywall in 2900s. Many of the players there grinded it out or are just terrible p2w players who get carried by level 10 cards (which you should be able to at least compete with because they are **just that bad**).

Before I was able to get to A8, I had a similar mindset ""if I had legendary then I could get to legendary."" It changed when I reached it, why? Because even though I understood without a legendary that I was at a disadvantage, I still took the challenge and changed my mindset. At the end of the day, if you're lucky to roll a legendary, great! Youll get a boost, but if everyone rolls one, it isn't going to get any easier to climb to A8 because those with the proper mindset will always win the mental game. At the end of day, if legendaries do appear to everyone, people will just start complaining about higher levelled legendaries cards. At the end of the day, that guy might have a legendary, but if you have the skill and the mindset, there be no way you can't win. *Change your deck, change your play style*. Giving everyone a legendary is **not** going to get you to A8, in fact it would only raise the gap between late 2k to 3k.

This is probably going to get lost or downvoted, but j just personally feel this was an important and necessary post and eye-opener about A8 and legendaries 

TLDR: A8 is the final arena and should not feel entitled to be there.

So recently Supercell decided the course of action to nerf freeze was to lower the freeze time from 8 to 7 seconds. Obviously this was a somewhat needed nerf but I don't think it was the right type of nerf. 

A hog freeze on offense isn't that hard to handle. It is ALMOST always results in a -8 elixir on the attacker.

The real power with freeze comes on the defensive side, where a freeze + valk/barbs/horde allows the defender to use 8-9 elixir to stop a ridiculously large push when you're behind. 

By making the radius smaller, it nerfs the card, without having to affect it's actual ability and use. 

This way freeze is able to punish players for clumping troops together in a huge pile, yet still be able to not completely obliterate huge pushes with a mere 9 elixir. 

This would also make it more difficult for combos such as hog +freeze on the offense but will additionally reward players who are able to get their hogs to the towers. 

This buff would increase the skill cap of the card and allow for bigger misclicks and mistakes yet still allow the card to have it's unique ability. 

Thoughts?

Now, I agree that it is currently a very balanced card but I feel there is one very important issue with it.

When dragon is mid-animation and the opponent's troop dies, he resets his animation to another 1.8s. 

Normally this wouldn't be a huge issue but when you have an air AOE troop it should be able to kill an air GROUP of low hp troops. The dragon has extreme difficulty dealing with minion hordes and often takes damage even though it is being played defensively against the hordes. 

This wouldn't give the baby dragon a huge buff but would allow it to be able to properly deal with minion hordes without near death.

**faceit stats and demos haven't been saving for the last 5-6 months**

When you play a faceit game, the score, stats, map and demo are all accessible on your ""stats"" page. But for the 5-6 months. No scores, stats or even maps have been recorded other than some occasional forfeit games. 

I'm pretty sure this isn't intentional but I feel like this issue hasn't been given any attention considering this has been happening for almost half a year now
