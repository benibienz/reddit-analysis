1,"Hi there just to clarify there is no official frontier approved discord server. **edit 2**: There is an official discord server in relation to one run by the AD Slack/reddit complex, meaning it's endorsed by the complex.

AD Discord is run by Disnusty who runs the AD Slack/reddit complex.

Elite Aisling Duval Discord is just a community discord I own that's focused on several things beyond just powerplay.

I'm putting this out there before I want folks to realise that there's no competition, they both do exist and we do different things.

That's all no drama beyond that. There are several discords that do different things.

**Edit:** there is one piece of drama and I can't not mention it because it has relevance to a meta issue of whether I can even say anything about EADD here. 

I've tried in the past to post a EADD splash post and to show first hand from the horses mouth what we're about, and it's been snubbed, and deleted. Whether that's the right or wrong thing... that's not the point.

Only that anytime you're going to hear information about my discord, you'll be hearing it from folks who don't run it and I can't clarify it unless folks bring up concerns to me directly because I'm afraid any mention would simply be deleted by the mods. 

In fact I'm half expecting the mods to just delete this message even though this is a response to someone who mentioned my discord and is relevant to the discussion.",2016-11-15 14:25:40+00:00,da19e7f,,t1_d94x4s1,,AislingDuval

17,"I think we agree that one part of someone doesn't represent them in their entirety.

Where we disagree is whether it would reduce someone to use nouns as opposed to adjectives. One is transgender, versus one is a transgender person- one who is a person who has the quality of transgenderness.

I don't think i am being reductionist by doing so but I can understand what you may feel it is reductionist.

Ultimately we agree that people are more than one aspect as of which one could be described.

We just disagree on whether using a noun to describe someone assumes that it's all they are considered as, or it just refers to a quality out of many others that a person possesses and makes no pretences to sum someone up in the used noun. 

I believe our disagreements is something that is more due to differences in culture or viewpoints than anything else.

18,"mm. I dont' understand the first paragraph. We were talking about how one can use nouns to say the same thing as one were to use an adjective. 

to be whited, to gayed, to be trangendered... those sound like verbs to me and have no bearing here, surely. What do you mean by this?

do you mean these examples to mean we don't become the thing. Is your concern being, we can't be a collection of nouns because those nouns have to come from somewhere before they are put into us?

If that's the case, I disagree. I think one can be a collection of nouns without having to be imbibed with those properties prior. The properties exist inherently within a person.

&gt;Using transgender as a noun doesn't really work with your examples ...because these are jobs and descriptors of existing things

I chose examples that didn't deal with non temporal or quantifiable things. To address those concerns here are a few examples that fit into those categories.

they have brunette hair. (or the quality of being able to produce black hair)
they have grace and presence (a quality that is an not quantifiable)

...hmm after further thought, I think I disagree about trans being something that can't be lost (at least grammatically). 

With sufficient time we'll all turn to dust. Our hair grays, our grace becomes lost. And when we're dead we no longer posses the quality transgender, instead it's thought of in past tense.

She was graceful(or she had grace), she was a transgender person (she had be born with the quality of transgenderness).

&gt;Also the idea of having ""transgenderness"" just seems silly to me, both grammatically and just in generally making sense, it is not a quantifiable substance or a societal view or a job...

There's nothing grammatically incorrect with adding the suffix,-ness to an adjective in english. It doesn't have to be in reference to a quatifiable substance. That's why there exist words like happiness, lonliness, spaciousness. These are unquantifiable and largely subjective things.

I think it's possible to say we are a vessel of qualities and properties. Whether they be quantifiable or unquantifiable, subjective or objective, or temporal or lasting till death. Neither strictly only from birth or acquired through experience.

Ultimately, whether we personally prefer to describe things with nouns or adjectives. It makes no difference because we can still say the same thing with either in a sentence.

e.g.
I am &lt;adjective&gt;
I have the quality of &lt;adjective&gt;-ness

**edit**

I think i may have missed this bit: 
&gt;Using transgender as a noun doesn't really work with your examples, because no one assumes that the job consumes all they are, nor does beauty

Are you saying that being a transgender person consumes all that you are? I think that's a bit reductionist. I would have thought we're a collection of a whole lot of other things and being transgender or trans is just one aspect of who one is. I mean sure it could be an important part of a person to the person but it's not everything that one is. one has one's personality, aspirations, dreams. I mean I get that these other parts can be informed by being transgender but it's not the only thing that makes a person, who they are. Otherwise it's a little one dimensional, don't you think?",2016-09-28 08:14:36+00:00,d858x4o,10.0,t1_d84gwen,47740.0,ainbow

Ultimately whether one uses the adjective, we are beautiful, a bus driver, transgender, or to say we have beauty, intellgence, of transgenderness is a matter of semantics.

Your original point was that by using the noun form, it makes it all that we're about. Like judging a person solely on their job title. one aspects of them.

36,"With compassion, honesty and thoughtful consideration, here are my thoughts on your question.

I think the atmosphere isn't to do with any one person but the general psychology that comes with being in an online community. It's something that we can work on for sure.

I think part of that comes from a mistrust on whether I genuinely think these things.

* Some folks don't see politeness. They see manipulation attempts.
* Some folks don't see adherence (or even value) to reason or evidence-based logic, they see a tiresome and arduous discussion that takes too much effort and therefore not worth their time. If it's not worth their time, it's not worth anyone's time.
* There's probably a dash of [tribalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribalism) in there. If one considers another to not be a part of their group they're less likely to [empathize] (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090630173815.htm) with that person.
* One of the things i've read recently is [projecting your expectations of others onto others] (http://users.rider.edu/~suler/psycyber/conflict.html). If [you] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_you) expect someone to address you in a certain way, then you'll perceive them that way.
* Finally there's simply [this] (https://img.ifcdn.com/images/930f5e93bc8806fa2d5cd0d5d8d67389f8595e00562e415841232dd469647bda_1.jpg).

**But in the end.** The number of unique people who comment only represent a minute fraction of the whole. More people lurk, a lot more people don't care and most haven't read it yet. Doesn't get me down when I think of it in those terms.

That said I really think it's to do with the traps and pitfalls within internet communities that allow us to act in ways that wouldn't otherwise be kosher. I'm starting to believe it's not anyone's fault but just the nature of communication.

We are also Slack friendly. :)
For those who's only just heard of us, sorry. Because we're independent and not affiliated (though welcoming to any members of the Slack). **We wanted to make sure we had a vibrant and large enough community to be considered worthwhile before posting on this subreddit.**

We'll post a splash post soon.

I hope we've shown that we have a lot of genuine support from a lot of folks and that you'd consider adding us to your wonderful list of **Aisling Duval Resources**.

Thank you and have a good day~

Oh feel free to ask me questions here, on EADD, on the forums, or PM.

80,"August Expedition: Jaunt to Jaques has about 15 miners.

There's groundwork right now figuring out how to organise limpet-less mining.

The idea I've proposed is teams of 4 with 1 active miner and 3 active scoopers. 

When the rock is empty for the active miner, they switch out with one of the active scoopers who has the least amount of fragments collected. Once an active miner is full, they leave for the station and another pilot takes their place.

&amp;nbsp;

However if we had limpets, and if we're bringing them in, then this is what we'd do.

I've done some calculations with the help of an experienced miner, and we've come to a few figures.

&amp;nbsp;

**First:** We need to identify 15 high yield osmium rocks(average 32%) in asteroid belts which I have been told are fixed and permanent and thus won't disappear on reinstancing. 

This will likely take around 300 limpets to conduct prospection as Osmium is only found in 6-8% of the time in a given area.

**But this is a one-time payment.** Once these 15 rocks are found we can keep returning to them enmass.

&amp;nbsp;

**Second:** We need 315 limpets to support 15 miners with class A collector limpet controllers supporting 2 collectors at any one time out every hour.

With that, enmass 15 miners can go to a known prospected asteroid belt, launch prospector limpets at the right rocks to ""increase"" their yield, and have 15 miners mine it dry.

Now with that in mind, just to support 15 miners would require:

* A one time delivery of around 300 limpets
* An hourly delivery of 315 limpets

To support 15 miners for 10 hours straight, one would need to send 10 [anacondas](https://coriolis.io/outfit/anaconda/0p0tiFklnd3sxf5--------0202------063c05050404040n432i2f.AwRj4zlKRtpiA===.Aw18ZlA=) every 10 hours who (if they have engineer mods) have to travel for 10 hours straight to get from the bubble to jaques station.

This will net us around 94 tons per miner per hour.

&amp;nbsp;

**I'm all for crazy people doing crazy things** to support limpet deliveries because that 94 tons per miner per hour dramatically drops to something ridiculous (I believe it's 24 tons per miner per hour)

But that said, it may be too much to ask 10 commanders to bring 3000 tons of limpets to the station every 10 hours and self destruct when they've delivered their cargo. (or 20 commanders to take the journey to and fro in tandem)

Anything you can do to help would be appreciated towards the efforts over at Jaques Station, whether it be coming in your mining ship or bringing limpets in. (you could even mine in the bubble and transport it out if you like)

220,"&gt;Worth noting is that there will be cases in which the loss if a control system will open up a more profitable control system in the form of a system that was previously exploited.

I have done some research into this and did built a control system optimizer which allowed me to check for what may be the best configuration of systems from 30ly to 55ly. (assuming each SOI not touching)

I found several configurations that would give at least net 100 CC more with 2/3rds of the CS we use in that area. (assuming constant overhead of 62.1 CC if not certainly more CC could be generated)

It may be possible to fit more systems together and generate higher levels of CC in those areas if I could calculate overlapping CS's effectively.",2016-05-22 05:28:51+00:00,d3ex85s,4.0,t1_d3ete95,8827.0,AislingDuval

222,"BGS's value to powerplay comes from raising or lowering fortification triggers.

Optimizing a Control System (CS) to me means two things,

* promoting favourable government types in more than 50% of a CS's Sphere of Influence (SOI) if it is a profitable system when unfortified
* promoting unfavourable government types in more than 50% of a CS's Sphere of Influence (SOI) if it is an unprofitable system when unfortified.

If we were to plot these system's fortification triggers after being optimized. I imagine it would look something like [this] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ELyNXGtKSFsOK7uyNto3r4f21SAk1-THyHHNhXeDkVk/pubchart?oid=300208913&amp;format=interactive).

Now others may like to add additional criteria. For example, take **Blod**.

Blod is by my definition an unprofitable system. But because of it's 37 CC upkeep it can function as a shield system that can be offered up on the chopping block in lieu of other more valuable profitable systems closer to Cubeo. It is the highest profitable system, when fortified, we have. There's nothing wrong with additional advance criteria. These specifics are important.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;And once we have reached a surplus of CC, how can the power continue to expand without cannibalizing our imperial allies?

**That's a very interesting question,** one I hope we'll get to answer for real rather than hypothetically. Until we do, I can't ask questions regarding this to the decision makers of other powers who may be affected by such an outcome. I expect this would be a good problem to have and that diplomacy will prevail above all else.

Another potential outcome is that we hold on and spend minimal effort to stay level while helping our allies against a common foe,  whomever they may be, through undermining and opposing tasks.

**Edit 1:** didn't notice a type the second criteria was supposed to be **unprofitable** when not fortified

223,"In OP, I did say:
&gt;Furthermore, targeting the 6 worst systems may not be practically within our means. The further a system is from Cubeo, the easier it will be to get rid of.

I am aware of this and do agree. But if not the worst 6, certainly one, two or more in lieu of the the ones that are one of the worst 6.

I want to clarify that I'm not trying to persuade people that removing these particular 6 systems is the best course of action. Nowhere in the OP does it say that. 

Your mind is filling in intent that exist naught in the writing of the OP itself. If I have written something that said that it was, please quote me when you reply, otherwise I'll assume you agree with me.

If however, this is not the case...

* Wouldn't you have read what I had quoted at the beginning of the post? 
* How could you have read that and assumed that I thought a system like Panganau could be practically removed with great difficulty? 
* Surely you must either be cherry picking, intentionally or not, or have issues with the english language.

227,"&gt;where you want to use a hammer, i prefer use tweezers. With a hammer you've the risk to hurt yourself very badly.

You did use that analogy for me that but it's not true. I do want the best plan to be put forward. My data points towards a certain direction that as you've said we agree on but not how it would be carried out.

Understand what I've presented is not a full plan. it's the explanation of how things would add up if we did manage to lose 6 of our worst. This is not a plan, **this is an observation.**

What that means is, **We both agree on shedding systems and we actually both prefer to use tweezers**.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Also shed our worst systems is actually impossible, we've still a 5C. Look at Yaque, it's an agriculture/tourism system, there's no chance that the grinders will prepare it because there's no trade route.

I have also stated in the paragraph that it may not be practical to lose some of the 6 worst because what we shed is largely dependent on the distance from Cubeo which informs their upkeep.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;You are forgetting something. With the 2.1 the next week, a short time after, the new powers are coming, and some old powers will vanish.

I haven't forgotten it. My report is only focused on the health of Aisling Duval. That is the scope of it. ~~It~~ If this report was about speculating about the future of powerplay and the dangerous game, that would be a fair comment.

That said, I don't think any of old powers will vanish once the new power from the dangerous games come unless they fulfill the **collapse criteria**. There is only one power that has ever reached the criteria **and it was not us.**

&amp;nbsp;

Edit:
&gt;And even we're getting rid of some bad systems and we get a surplus, where will you spend your CC if there's no remaining good system to prepare ? 

If we find ourselves in a position where we have a surplus and no future profitable systems, then we would be in a situation where fortification is used as a defensive measure in case of sniping.

We would instead spend our extra CC on what i'd like to call **Plug Systems**
&gt;**A Plug System**: *A Control System that we can sink spare CC into, that doesn't make a profit and can be shed with very little effort. These type of Control System would do well to be far from our Capital to ensure they can be easily shed*

By putting our effort into these systems We will maintain our state until such an opportunity arises that we can take advantage of. In this scenario you presented, because we no longer have to fortify systems to stay afloat, our huge manpower can be focused on other tasks such as greatly helping out in any undermining efforts against our enemies whomever they may be in the future.

254,"These are interesting questions to ask and is something to be considered.

There are other options within our borders. A lot of systems for example overlap. I personally have looked into finding new optimal configuration of control systems and have found one for control systems between 35ly and 50ly that would all be profitable, giving us at least over 100 CC (assuming upkeep is steady at 62.1 CC. If not, profits will be much more) more in net income using 5 systems less.

This may be a potential solution but it will require more research. I suggest it to highlight that there are indeed other options, and there may be potential for other kinds of solutions.

The more of us that are interested and are aware of our current situation, the more discussion, debate and innovation will come.

**Edit:** I want to also clarify what I'm for. I for a solution that allows us and our body of fortifiers to do less work to keep ourselves above the deficit. This can be accomplished by reducing the deficit so we need to fortify less systems to stay afloat.

**You're making a great first step:**

* by getting involved in fortification, **You've reached Level 1!**
* by choosing to fortify only to 100%, **You've reached Level 2!**

but you can go reach higher levels by choosing to only fortify control systems above the dreaded **poverty line!**

**To reach level 3:**

you should only fortify systems above the poverty line. The poverty line is:

    62.1 CC + the control system's upkeep.

If a system makes less than the poverty line, do not fortify it.

**An example of a system below the poverty line**

Chnumar is an example of a system we shouldn't fortify. It has an upkeep of 21 CC. That means the poverty line is: 

    62.1 + 21 = 83.1 CC. 

Since Chnumar's income, 29 CC, is less than 83.1CC. It's a system that's deep below the poverty line so we shouldn't fortify it!

*Notes* 

*If you're interested in knowing about why we add 62.1 CC to calculate the poverty line, ask me, otherwise accept it as the way things are~^(spooky music please)*

It would be an amazing thing to be able to say,""I expect Chnumar to be fortified to a level of between 128% and 157% in three days given a rate or 17% a day"" with certainty but without data i can't.

Recording this data will tell us, how much, when, how fast, and if we do it over several cycles, how it changes overtime or if there are any changes overtime.

Experience is great, but as you might realise from my posts, **Data is king**. (HAIL DATA!)",2016-04-21 21:54:39+00:00,d2c9we1,2.0,t1_d2c93s1,1148.0,AislingDuval

351,"Hi there!

I've started up a Aisling Duval bgs channel over at our discord.

I created a short list of good systems to sell to based on several factors such as government type, player group non-compete, distance from cubeo and power exploiting:

* Tjapakhis - Tjapakhis One
* Anetiman - Co-operative of Anetiman
* Durgeth - Durgeth One

**The number one reason why any system was considered in the first place** was because their government type was either a ~~Confederacy~~, Communism, or Cooperative. By pushing these systems into a state by which expansion would occur, we would propagate government types that would lower the fortification threshold and raise the undermining threshold. At least within a CS's SOI, That's beneficial to Aisling Duval.

The one thing I haven't been able to get data on is the distance to stations for these particular systems. If you do swing by there, let me know how far the stations are, because that would affect it's rating!

You can come have a look at what we're doing on the discord [here] (https://discord.gg/0hsajAjOCmFPGhmF) without needing to verify.",2016-04-21 03:24:59+00:00,d2b9tnr,1.0,t3_4fqe30,11734.0,AislingDuval

356,"&gt;Fundamentally this recent spate of thinly veiled, deceptive marketing for your own little fiefdom under the banner of an ""Official AD Discord"" when it's clearly anything but, leads me to believe the following:

Hi there, When did anyone ever say Aisling Duval Discord was the official discord? I don't believe I've ever said that and I think I'm the only one who talks about it.

&gt;You got one member who knows a bit of maths and can make pretty graphs, but is a poster-child of exactly what happens when one person attempts to make sense of the intricacies of PP in relative isolation.

I'm always open to talking to more people and getting feedback. If i'm isolated i wouldn't have posted it here to get feedback. Anyone can come on the discord and talk to me anytime they like. There's nothing wrong with being wrong and making mistakes. That's how we learn. I think the attitude towards discouraging being simply wrong, is detrimental to innovation and in turn detrimental towards our power because we're discouraging player who have fun playing the game in a way you don't. We should be positive and encouraging to people who make the effort to explore and understand these things, because it does take effort. 

**I'm not saying we shouldn't correct them** Just not discourage people who are interested in learning.

&gt;Unfortunately they represent a group who have proven to share none of these qualities, and furthermore continue to show they cannot be trusted.

I don't like this, I found this entire comment thread to be unnecessary. I'd ask that we please stop. I think you're one of the more reasonable people on this subreddit. I feel that Astrelle hijacked this thread to talk about issues that could very well be in its own thread. they weren't talking about the data itself. and so aren't we.

357,"This is a very long TLDR you've written.

The only system right now seems to be Ch'eng that's under the curve. (you're right on that)

I'm under the impression from this that our BGS activity has either been limited, forestalled, undeveloped or those who are have been targeting control systems with a lot of systems and thus slow but steady. If it wasn't, we should have more systems under the curve. I think that surprised me the most. It makes me wonder further if the BGS has little affect on the points. given Ch'eng.

Lulus isn't plotted so high... are you looking at the same data I am? It's right after the intersection of the two curves.

In the case where a graph hides a data. I'm sorry I had retired for the night. I didn't expect anyone interested in looking at the data. thank you for your interest! :) **I would however also like to point out that you can always copy my sheets and move the charts away.**

Both karakasis and halbara in my values had incorrect fortification points. after correcting, Ch'eng is the only slight below the curve. I will post info on that soon.",2016-04-20 15:03:18+00:00,d2adgkx,3.0,t1_d2a1h94,28905.0,AislingDuval

It should now all be corrected. Please tell me if you see any more issue!

My purpose was to find special systems within our empire that shows systems we should strive for. The only system that seems to be below the curve is Ch'eng. The data is right on that one.

After looking, I see there's no empire aligned **Communist** or **Cooperative** systems that we can exploit. there's an empire aligned confederency by the Crystal Armada but I need to check on what exactly are the issues with the crystal armada's bgs before using advising we use it.

It makes me wonder if allegiance doesn't affect powerplay fortification/undermining points but is instead just means you'll automatically be friendly with them if you're friendly with the major faction whom they are aligned with.

362,"*Corrected data. I will be listing out the rare few unique systems that we do have.*

**These scatter diagrams shows a clear trend in the fortification and undermining points, the further away from Cubeo you are.**

Notes:

* the control systems below the fortification curve and those above the undermining curve.
* At around 90 ly, the fortification and the undermining cost equalize.

We should strive to make control systems more like the systems below the fort curve or above the undermining curve.
Why are they special? let's find out. I'll be listing them as I find out. You can view my data [here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ELyNXGtKSFsOK7uyNto3r4f21SAk1-THyHHNhXeDkVk/edit#gid=807795734)

**Halbara** is a control system that is 52.92ly away from Cubeo and ~~561pts~~ 0pts below the fortification curve. It has an Empire-Aligned Corporate government.

**Karakasis** is a control system that is 59.64ly away from Cubeo and ~~635pts~~ 1pts below the fortification curve. It has an Empire-Aligned Patronage government.

There doesn't seem to be anything terribly interesting with them and there isn't too much there. They're red herrings. With the fort points for both Karakasis and Halbara corrected, they don't stray too far from olklei's algorithm. 

The system that strays the furthest from Olklei's Algorithm is Ch'eng at -90pts below the Olklei's Fortification Curve.
There seems to be evidence that Blod and HIP 105391 may be below the Olklei's Fortification Curve by 7 and 8 points respectively. but i do not know if that is within the margin of error of that algorithm. It is something that can be looked into.

Here's a test I'd like you to do if you can:

* Go into every power's discord and ask how many text channels they have. AD Discord currently has 15.
* add them up

now imagine trying to find one text channel out of that number. Imagine if you were in all of those on the slack.

The slack you used for comparison caters to one power and it has the ability to hide channels you don't wish to be a part of. We can't do it like that but we can separate it into separate power's servers that hide them from view.

I think there are 6 strong pluses that we have:

* We have integrated voice chat
* Anyone can join the discord without sacrificing security
* The leadership cannot be admins and vice versa reducing the potential risk for abuse.
* We can offer the same amount of security as the slack for secure channels.

Does the voice recording have to be transformed enough that you can't identify the speaker?

So at the moment we have public text channels that anyone can go into,

and secure text channels which at the moment, uses some of the same security tests that the slack uses. Namely the requirement to post to a specially modified text channel, your reputation screen and merit screen to prove how long you've been in the power.

You can come into the discord and test the system yourself (and tell others if what I said so far is true).

The criteria for entry to these secure channels will be handed over to the leaders of Aisling Powerplay Operations. I don't know if there's a publically available list but if there was, we could definitely validate these leaders easily. For the moment, we can only assume that verified leaders of their respective player groups represent this number.

I could say that of the four most profitable that are most likely to enter into turmoil system, are mostly threatened by ALD and DP which have been our firm allies in scrapping and offering assistance. But there is still the doubt.

The only thing I can say that might help is if we do scrap and get into positive net income, we cannot be forced into turmoil if all our systems are fortified. We won't need to fortify half of our systems just to stay afloat and our fortifiers can focus on more interesting high level play.

398,"I can only say what was said to me. I'd like to provide an unbiased and neutral point of view but I'm recent events have made that difficult. Understand I do not know if it's true or I may have ideas muddled up.



About motives:
The black hand's only desire is to scrap. They believe that will help aisling out of her debt. We're at just below 800 CC of debt if we don't fortify and we have to do a lot of fortifying. Scrapping is something the black hand has been interested in for a long time but hasn't been able to get support for since december. Frustrated by bureaucracy of trying to convince an entire group, to scrap they made a unilateral action to go about it on their own. This wasn't well received by the community. I believe this was quite close to the start of the conflict but i have read chat logs of the first aisling high council that seem to contain the embers that may have sparked it.

Nothing was accomplished. Aisling did grow further and further in debt. at some point prior to this the black hand was blanket banned from the slack. first it's leader, then after deliberations, the entire group. for which reasons? I do not have the full details or have forgotten it. It may have been legitimate. I believe sharing a discord and encouraging it's use was one of the reasons. I also believe there was concern over a general reduction of moral that had been attributed to the black hand as a whole.

Personally, I've been affected by the aftereffect of the blanket ban. I think you and I talked about it a little. I'm still of the opinion it's an association fallacy to assume that and think all members should have been judges separately, but whichever the case it did occur.

The 5C attacked happened and I have very little information on which exact systems were affected. only that chnumar was pushed into our power and conii was lost. I have heard differing accounts on this that favour the side that was tellng it. Neither side had been interested in providing proof. either because of a lack of it or due to a desire i cannot fathom. When you live in the internet age where screenshots are a hotkey away, it's a little strange, but perhaps people trusted each other a little more back then.

A fair amount of hate comes from what occurred during the 5C attack. I would need to speak to individual members to confirm and not the higher ups to confirm. To the black hand it's thought that someone is twisting words and misrepresenting things... A recent experience has caused me to start to believe this. Maybe not knowingly... rational and logical conversation and arguments are difficult to make. we are not born rational, it takes work to overcome our biases. It helps to be curious and ever skeptical and to follow the evidence.

But all of this... is heresay. I can't defend it well one way or another, that's just what I've gotten and gleaned and don't inherently know to be true. A lot of this could have been avoided if everything was in the open. Too much of this has been in secret and behind closed doors. And some of those involved on both sides like it that way. perhaps because they're not used to any other way or they don't know how to deal with being under the public lens. I believe a fair amount of the secrecy developed in response to the 5C attack on the slack side.

I think the secrecy, the lack of accountability, and the lack of any proof is hurting the community as a whole and we can do better.

That's all I've heard or can say. As said, it's all heresay without the much needed non existent proof.",2016-04-13 22:33:05+00:00,d21ss4z,6.0,t1_d21qim1,3275.0,AislingDuval

yes this is a game, agreed, but we all have fun and care about this game in our own ways.

&gt;What was the intent of the conversation? To try to get someone to answer a question yes or no? That's all I can gather from it because so much of that conversation, and the ones here, have been over that issue.

The intent was to prove there was a better system to another. you cannot prove something to someone else unless they understand logic. Much like you when you didn't understand what B &gt; A meant.

&gt; If I answer yes, and the system isn't better, I'm a liar because I didn't change my mind.

I don't think you understand the question i asked. maybe i should to you.

&gt;Would you change your mind if we gave the numbers on a system that is better than HIP 105391 in that region that does prove it would be a better choice?

Would you change your mind? (i think you get this question)

if(this is on the condition, that means if the condition fails you don't have to change your mind)

we gave the numbers on a system(the numbers refer to the CC value and refers back to his definition. system name would also be given, it is assumed i won't provide him info without proof)

that is better(extrapolated from what is best)
 than HIP 105391 in that region (i think you understand this since we haven't debated it)

that does prove it would be a better choice?(reference the CC value, which if provided along with system name would prove it.)

&gt;Had the system been presented, and one side still thought the first system was better, then a new conversation, a learning conversation, begins. Why, in the face of contradicting evidence, does one side still think one or the other of the systems is better?

This is something I don't wish to enter with anyone. I will argue with a brick wall. You can hold whatever views you like and not hold yourself to reason or logical thinking, I simply won't discuss anything with you if my aim is to get into a constructive discussion.

&gt;Also keep in mind that the conversation we saw started off with a false assumption, that the system contested another power. This doesn't instill confidence in the newcomer.

&gt;I put my point clearly. Acinonyx believed there was a better system, one that rested on two premises,
the current CS had a contested system (which was defeated i agree with it's defeat)
the one he believed had higher CC.

there were two premises and only one was defeated but the one that mattered towards the other speaker's definition, of what is a good system and extrapolated what is a better system was not.

418,"&gt; I don't really want points, but if the math is good and what i've said is relevant to aisling duval, then this thread should be upvoted to show that we support it.

**Premise:**
I created this document to help me, a new powerplayer to understand the situation with aisling at the moment and I have come to some very startling conclusions:

* **""Without fortification, Aisling Duval will have a deficit close to 800 CC""**
* **""There are 20 control systems that provide less than 40 CC each""**
* **""If Aisling dumps half of those systems we will have a surplus of over 400 CC""**

**Explanation:**
These are my observations based on the data provided to us in game for cycle 45 which you can check by going to galactic powers.

**Point:**
Based on the data, and the conclusions i've come to, i think scrapping looks like a viable strategy to dealing with our deficit.

**Controlled Turmoil**
Over on the controlled turmoil tab, a plan which includes undermining 11 of the worst systems that have higher than 21 upkeep and are not either,
* Kuki An
* Chnumar
* Karsuki Ti
*  Lambda-1 Tucane 

which will always be fortified. we would also have to fortify 18 systems that earn positive net income,

**Result**
we could potentially get ourselves out of a CC deficit with 447 CC to spare.

**logistics**
This would take around 150 000 undermining and fortification points each which translates into the work done by 29 rank 5 fortifiers  and the work done by 31 rank 5 underminers.

**Support from other Powers**
I have spoken to 4 foreign powers about this and asked on a hypothetical basis if they would help and how much **r5wd**(*rank 5 work done*) they are willing to ensure they could and would provide. Note these numbers are quotes not to be taken as sureties unless we're more serious about it:

* ALD 4(read more below)
* DP 5
* secret 1

and it totals to 10. so we have to figure out if we are able to provide the remaining 50 r5wd.
however ALD is special.

**ALD SCRAP**
I contacted them through the **ALD SCRAP** and they mentioned that with 1 person, they can undermine everything listed in 4 days. 2? 2 days, 4, 1 day. by figuring out how to sustain 16, we could undermine the systems we need in 6 hours. 

**Snipermining**
This will be useful if we are to undermine on the last day of the cycle which is the best time to do so for our power as I've been told by folks who commented on my thread about it [here] (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=242337)

It has been said that entering controlled turmoil is difficult. And for Aisling, I agree. However it seems like the best solutions to go for. Whether the systems i've chosen are the final targets or not, if we can work to get rid of our top 9 worst systems, we'd break even and then some.

**Notes:**
now i'm new powerplay and perhaps my publically collected data from the galaxy map has some mistakes. if so, check my numbers and let me know where the faults are.  **as long as we don't ignore the facts, the numbers and what they spell**

**more Quotes**

* More than 70% of our systems make a netloss! 
* We need to fortify 32 of the best control systems just to stay afloat!!
* If we shed the worst 8 systems, our overhead would be reduced by 1000CC!!!**

420,"&gt;Why would you expect the answer to the first question to be yes? Rebel goes on to say he doesn't know of better systems.

I expected the answer to be yes before he answered it and had prepared a follow up. As you've noted, he did agree with the first question.
&gt;The numbers aren't what are needed, the system name is. With the system name, anyone can look it up to verify and judge for themselves. Regardless, no new numbers were presented, therefore rebel never had the opportunity to consider them.

we would provide the system name so he could see for himself but I wanted to know if he would even change his mind even if he was given it. his reply made it clear that even if he was given that information and it was better than the system he had thought of was good, he would not be able to confirm that he would change his mind and think it was better. all he said, was that he would consider it. is 1 &gt; 2? i would consider it. is #00FF00 green? he would consider it. considering it, is not the same as a yes or no. he couldn't tell what he personally thought.

If you're a rational sane person who understands logic, you don't need new information to say if you would think that B is biggest if B &gt; A when you had thought A was biggest.

&gt;Why? Because he doesn't dictate decisions to the group
the question was directed towards him as an individual. Did you even read the chatlogs?

&gt;They don't need to be willing to change their views. This entire conversation is a prime example.

Now while I had earlier in the chat thought that HIP 105391 did contest it as you can see in the logs, you should read further that **I did changed my mind about that premise when new information was brought into light during the discussion.** I even said when i presented the two premises, that one was defeated and i agreed with that defeat.
&gt; the current CS had a contested system (which was defeated i agree with it's defeat)

I do not dispute the nuance differences you've pointed out between the two systems. 

But at the time We were talking in accord to Rebel's metric, the one that was used in discussion:
&gt; ""it makes a profit , thats how i define a good system.""

then Kavalliyala is a better system. If he had defined it in a more nuanced manner that took these thoughts into account, then that would be a different matter.

We're not arguing here on the facts you presented because I agree with them. We agree that there are issues with Kavalliyala. (whether I still prefer it is another matter) I have not said that Slack is a dysfunctional tool. **I think slack it great.**

429,"Rank this down if you find it irrelevant and if it doesn't add anything. But if it does. **have a read.**

I never said there can't be meaningful conversation. We never disagreed there can't be meaningful conversation, i'm speaking for the lack of constructive conversation.

I did seek to understand both points of views, I summarized early on what Acinonyx could not and what Rebel could not discern. What I also discerned and did endeavour to find out was *if the conversation between these two people was constructive?*

I put my point clearly. Acinonyx believed there was a better system, one that rested on two premises, 

* the current CS had a contested system (which was defeated i agree with it's defeat)
* the one he believed had higher CC.

rebel gave the definition of what a good system was:
*""it makes a profit , thats how i define a good system.""*

**I summarized these 3 points very early on.**

**But i noticed something, these two folks were misunderstanding each other.** Either due to a bad command of the English language or potentially due to having no desire to understand each other. They were doing this but why?

I saw that and after summarizing both arguments I asked two questions because i wanted to understand what was going on in rebel's head:

* Do you agree that there was a better choice for a control system in the region that HIP 105391 occupies?
* Would you change your mind if we gave the numbers on a system that is better than HIP 105391 in that region that does prove it would be a better choice?

**To the first question:** I wanted to make sure we weren't arguing for the sake of arguing. that he genuinely believed, to his knowledge that there was no better system. It was simple yes or no question **That he could have simply said yes** *Why didn't he?*

**To the second question:** I expected the answer to the first to be yes. He and I wouldn't have this conversation if it wasn't yes, right? In preparation for expecting a yes, this was the follow up that would show, Rebelpants as a person who was amenable to changing his views if we could provide a system. The ball is in acinoynx court to provide the system, sure. but there's no point if after presenting it, Rebelpants would still go on believing that there was no better system.  **he did not say yes.** Why couldn't he??

There can be no difference in opinion when we are talking about control system CC. That value is fact.

**By his definition:** a good system ""makes a profit"". by extension, A better system would make **more** profit. I was playing by his rules and by his definitions.

**All I did was try to clarify that he was indeed playing by his own rules.**

he didn't give a clear answer. This was what he gave:

""whenever you wish to provide information that would be beneficial to aisling share it and we will always consider it.""
There are a few things happening in this sentence. 

* **the use of the royal we.** he is not willing to put his own neck on the line to say yes or no either way. I don't if he's afraid or if he's prideful but it seems he needs to pad himself within a larger group. **Why?**
* **the sentence is carefully worded.** Saying you will consider something is not the same as you saying, you would update your views given new information. If we're talking about opinion, go right ahead, but remember using his metric on what a good system and by extension what a better is; **we're in the realm of fact. And you cannot have an opinion on fact.**

When I deal with factual information. there's no debate. 1 &gt; 0, 2 &gt;1. if i think A is biggest then I am told B is biggest and I compare the two and that B &gt; A, then I will change my view and think B is biggest.

sigh... While I do not know the motivations for not recognising or standing by logical truths. I do know that with his final answer of:
""you can ask me whatever you wish, of course i am free to answer in whatever fashion i feel is fit.""

It showed he had no interest in recognising logical truths. if you are not interested in recognising logical truths than there is nothing we can do to convince you of anything that requires logic. **Hence there was no reason to present the system as the only reason why we were presenting it in the first place was as a show of proof.**

I hope i have shown my final bolded point supported by the several premises I had presented in this reply. Let me know exactly which parts you find illogical. I have written this in a very exacting manner in the hopes to put to rest what had gone down from my side to the end. I did try to understand and from I understood, rebel had no interest in logic in this conversation.

431,"when two people have a discussion, they need to be willing to be amenable to changing their views when presented otherwise it's not a constructive discussion. The question was a simple yes or no question, and one party had trouble saying nothing but yes or no to them.

Was there fear? was there pride? was there concerns about there confusion? it's it took a while of reiteration to get to an adamant point that the other party was not willing to say they're a thinking rational being subject to changing their opinion give valid info. The question was about what was the point of this conversation if you never really cared about the answer in the first place. if giving new information didn't change your view. 

And no i didn't know the system you misread it. that are several ifs in that sentence, it was on the condition that if a system existed, and then presented as a better system (with the definition of a good system using the original definition the other party described as a system that provided high amounts of CC, and a better system being one that provided more than that amount of CC.), would the other party concede that it was a better system?

the context of this particular example was to combat worries that the other speaker might have interpreted the original question as asking if there is a system we should replace now with the current one. only that there exist a system which is better by their definition of what made a good system.

So no I did not know the system, while waiting for the first party to return, the one who made the claim that there was a system, I tested if the conversation was still constructive, with a yes and no question.

It wasn't.

If the other party had answered yes, we would not have ended there and it is highly likely the other party would be able see the system in question and attack the 2nd premise of the original statement the first speaker made.

Failed attempts at constructive conversations is something that affects all communities and we shouldn't shy away from reading and understanding how they occur and shining a light on them so other's can learn from them.

The benefits of having a communication channel that can holds us all publically accountable means we can't bullshit each other. I've heard story after story of players or player groups having done this and that to one another with little to know proof or a general unwillingness to share it.

**There's also lot of drama in our group**, a lot of stuff that's causing all of these issues and I believe it's this secrecy and cloak and dagger play of plausible deniablity that's causing most of this drama and paranoia.

**Secret communications behind closed doors exacerbates drama and paranoia.**

I'm not saying we shouldn't discuss sensitive information related to PP in secure channels. But I think we should be open about more of the other things that we can be.

I think if we held more public and active discussion in public platforms, we'd be better for it. It would improve the culture within our power that seems driven towards increase misinformation and mistrust amongst us. Not a few minutes ago was the black hand accused of undermining systems... there's not been any proof of it.

And that's why I believe in our public and open discord that you all can be a part of.

I agree with your advice. public communications channels accessible to all is good for our power in the long run because it add accountability and dispels rumours and paranoia quickly when we're on the same page and not excluded from it.

Are you saying you would help to shed systems but not Chnumar? I don't wish to be too direct buy why you want to keep Chnumar as a control system?

If you were to help, how many rank 5 valued work would the 5C be interested in providing towards it? (not asking for number of people in the 5c, to be clear)

In my mind it seemed that the victim actually has the best advantage. if they run and survive, you don't get cargo, if they run and don't survive, you still don't get cargo. Sure they'll lose their profits. but you yourself are also running in the red for wasting ammunition on them.

that is unless you're using the hatch deployers... in which case.. why are you even bothering to kill traders as a pirate?

i propose: and this is off topic but as a fellow fuel rat we can be civil, that instead of killing them out right, you damage them until they're less than 10 percent health. (1% would be best) and let them go on their way and wish them luck with their trade.

**Why even bother?** I think it would cause a lot less bad blood and further your cause as more pilots will be on your side. But if the violence is inherent to pushing your agenda (because it's more ""fun"" to gank), then you'll face more opposition. Which leads me to ask...

**Which is worth more to the SDC?** The problems you'd like to shine a spotlight on, or the mindless ganking for the lulz?

you think the travel time to a place like hutton should be equalize with a hyperspace jump given how far it is by raising the max speed for all ships.
You propose a difference in SC max speed for ""exploration"" ships.
You're saying that these changes will allow make it safer for traders and harder for pirates And create more engaging gameplay for fuel rats.

I like the idea of raising the max speed for SC. I don't understand the utility of raising the max speed for exploration vessels given that space is already so huge, there's too much to traverse and won't make much of a diff. (being able to get to planets 4-5 seconds faster is nothing without better acceleration/deceleration). As having done fuel ratting, having to go out 10ly to someone is a scary prospect especially on code red where if we're off from their course by a tad, we may be 0.1 lightyears away from their wing beacon.
I think piracy is already a very difficult occupation and could use development over making it harder.

I bought the game recently and **I love it**. Absolutely everything. The art, the engine sounds, the isolation, the scope of it all. However there are a few UI issues that tend to bug me from a Human-Computer Interaction front.

Sorry for having four questions but here they are:

* Can we have Radio Sidewinder integrated into the game?
* Why can't we access our ship's panels while in Witchspace?
* Are there plans to allow us to filter targets in the left panel so that we don't have to scroll down a gigantic list?
(e.g.by stations, planets, stars, asteroids, POIs) 
* Why aren't there keyboard shortcuts in the galaxy map that would allow us to route without using the mouse or move through the various tabs and components on the left information panel?

736,"I had experessed why I made this enketo on youtube video that's linked in the first comment and in a reply.

The long and short of it is there were claims that esperantists would like esperanto games. But I cannot justify making a game targeting the esperanto community if we don't know how many there are and what kind of games they like. I think this may be a mentality game developers share. as evidenced, there are barely any games on googleplay and the appstore (except by moosader and ludisto).

As for surveying an english speaking population, I don't need to, we already have demographic information on how many people speak english. That's not the hard part. It already exists. i don't need to perform one.

I'm alright with open discussion, but i would prefer a more concerted effort with diagrams and collaborations to understand each others point of view and the ability to track separate points of a discussion and whether they've been proven wrong or not. I don't believe reddit to be that and would feel more comfortable putting effort in doing collaborative work understanding each other through email. but to be courteous i will answer your questions in several statements.

There may exist statistical information on how many people care about privacy. There exists statistical information on the demographic make up of the internet. I disagree i think it will be less bias. ",2015-09-21 17:42:09+00:00,cv98057,14.0,t1_cv977ll,1209.0,Esperanto
737,"I'm open to hearing how many people feel strongly about this in the esperanto community and won't answer this survey because of this. As said to pizziaolo, if there is a great amount of esperantists who do I will be willing to do something about it. Let me know. As for now it will stay as is. You can let me know at jackellice@gmail.com Thanks again for the question!",2015-09-21 17:10:42+00:00,cv96ru1,4.0,t1_cv94km7,3422.0,Esperanto
738,"I can assure you now then I wouldn't claim there are no more doubts as to how many esperantists are there. I had made no calims of that. As I have spent effort the questions in the survey so i am aware of their limitations. I hope that helps. 

I make the promise that I will not alter the results. That I will release the data raw so others may draw their own conclusions along with my own results. That's really the only amount of trustworthiness I hope to expect.

You seem to be keenly interested in this. If you'd like more specific details, I would suggest we continue via email as i believe reddit may not be suitable to talk about this at length. Thanks for your reply:) ",2015-09-21 17:04:48+00:00,cv96jpa,12.0,t1_cv938vw,5178.0,Esperanto
739,"It does not have to be that way if you interpret the data as is with regards to it's sample size. I do not agree it will be as bad as you think. Right now you're doing what's called the strawman's fallacy(edit: more likely slippery slope fallacy) let's wait till the results come in :). then again, I understand your fears of how other people may interpret it.

740,"Thank you. I had read the story about the blind men and an elephant. I did a project on it. It was nice. I've noticed you've not linked the citation on where you got the prior precise estimates. I would still prefer to read how they arrived to those numbers. i find your specific estimate not indicative of my local area. (but perhaps that's your point :p)

I think we shouldn't shoot the survey in the foot until we review the results. Right now we can't say so for sure. but we can help ensure it has a better chance of reaching more people As said, if you'd like to help this blind man learn about other parts of the elephant let me know where i can post. :) Thanks!

741,"I'm not convinced it is the most precise estimation. Can you provide... a link or citation to it's white paper? I've read a 2015 white paper estimate and it bases it's 2 million estimate from the facebook group.

That said I think my survey can tell us more than just how people there are but **what kind of person learns esperanto?**.

* Which country is likely to speak it?
* How many men to women there are?
* percentages that have kids?
* ktp

**So far the estimates have not tackled those questions.**

The more people i reach, the ""lesswrong"" it becomes so if you know places where i can post where I can reach the more experienced esperanto speakers, please don't hesitate to let me know. :) Thanks!",2015-09-21 12:20:03+00:00,cv8xbfr,6.0,t1_cv8west,3021.0,Esperanto
742,"Sure this is still very hard for me to articulate in esperanto but there aren't any demographic statistics on esperantists out there. Only estimates.
It's a little ridiculous and I think we ought to have a better picture idea of what kind of person becomes an esperantist (demographically speaking) 

Evildea had posted a video asking where are all the esperanto games.
He made a case for why a game developer ought to make some.
It got me interested but without any data to support it, I cannot justify it. so I made this enketo to collect some. :)

I also posted a video which also linked about it in the google form and in the first comment here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBlGFVghbQ  thanks!

743,"It is understandable that it is a hassle for those who do not have a google account.

It was not an easy decision to make. If I remove the threshold, then anyone could post mutiple times and upset the results. Having to use a google account helps me ensure(to a certain extent) that there aren't double or spam posts.

I hope this helps you understand :( If there are enough of you out there that can't use google then let me know, I may open it up. For now it is as is. Thanks!
