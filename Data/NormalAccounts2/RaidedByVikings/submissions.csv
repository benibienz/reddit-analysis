Introduction:
Elite Aisling Duval Discord (EADD) is an open community discord for all members of the AD community. It was established on the principles of Meritocracy, Accountability and Transparency which can be seen in the way we structure our [rules] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p0YhV6TvynZIY7Wv6qT6Nm6osFnCsS7E_oCzVcKGZk4/edit)

We have rooms for people to talk about trading, exploration, powerplay, Aisling-only, Imperial-only, fanart, roleplay as well as off-topic and general chat, and voice chat.
***
We currently have 5 admins: Aeonprime, Aaron Starr, Jezebel Taylor, Flyingwarfox (who's inactive at the moment), and myself.
I've interviewed each of them personally and you can read their interview logs upon requests.

At this moment and time, we are the largest and most active Aisling Duval Discord with close to 150 members.
We are listed on:

* Discord.me [directory] (https://discord.me/servers/1/elite%20dangerous)
* /r/EliteDangerous Discord
* Qohen leth's [Elite Dangerous Discord thread] (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/253560-Public-Elite-Dangerous-related-Discord-servers)
* Elite Imperials [Discord] (https://discord.gg/XkcjY)
* EDEX's [website] (https://edex.space/community/)
as well as the forums [here] (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/278240-Elite-Aisling-Duval-Discord)

We are also Slack friendly.(as in if you want to advertise the slack there, go nuts!) :) 

For those who's only just heard of us, sorry. Because we're independent and not affiliated (though welcoming to any members of the Slack). We wanted to make sure we had a vibrant and large enough community to be considered worthwhile before posting on this subreddit.
***
**Rules**
We have 8 simple core rules. 

1. Be Awesome!
As long as you’re willing to be positive, understanding and constructive, you’re welcome! 
Shout the name of your power when you enter. :p

2. Be legal!
If you’re younger than 13, you will have to be removed from this service unless you have written permission from your folks.

3. Be Civil!
We're here to make friends and learn about the game that we love so much. If a conversation isn’t constructive or meaningful to you, you should walk away from it.

4. Be Secure!
This means not sharing logs from the secure channels to anyone outside of them. Feel free to do so with the public text channels.

5. Stay on target!
Everything out of topic should be brought to #offtopic, do not spam other channels

6. No Racism, Gender, Sexual Orientation, and religious persecution!
Treat all those as equally and respectfully as possible. No bashing or talking down on race, gender, sexual orientation, and religion or religious beliefs. The best way for this to not happen to you is to not bring these up. Never forget we're all human beings.

7. No Adult content of the highly suggestive and sexual nature!
You’re free to curse, but not to post pornography or conduct adult roleplays except in parody or in Duval's Dungeon. Be serious guys :p Maintain guys :p Do it in PM if you absolutely have to.

8. Show your admins some love!
They’re admins, they have to manage a lot of things. Give them a break and listen to them. 😃

A full list of rules can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p0YhV6TvynZIY7Wv6qT6Nm6osFnCsS7E_oCzVcKGZk4/edit).
We also have written mod/admin rules/procedures [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FN39wXMyM0KiQKqXVmZKMiMSUvqRB_ZLP8CifNRZiMA/edit) It also contains instructions on how to join our administrative staff. As long as you're not a PMF leader, it's open to you to apply.

DESCRIPTION:
Prospectors at Merupe 3C have been left distraught by the complete cease in Meta-Alloys generation.

""It used to be good business. Now what are we going to do? I can't keep paying the bills if we don't find more of those Barnacles."" - CMDR GoStu

Economists through inhabited space have remarked this news seems suspicious given that the recent unexpected growth in demand for Meta-Alloys.

When asked for a quote, one had said ""I'm usually prone to speculation, but something certain is amidst here. This is just too much of a coincidence to have been planned."" - Amsterdam Zamenholf

CMDR Olivia Vespera has come forward claiming her ship hold one ton of Meta-Alloy in her hold.

She may have the last and the most valuably coveted ton of Meta-Alloy left in the entire galaxy.

Her ship is currently is currently landed at Beagle Point on the other side of the galaxy, 65 thousand light years from Sol.

The Galactic Standing is not as important as these values and I think it's time to speak about them.

I've updated my data for Cycle 51. As with my earlier post in Cycle 48 this is where we're at.

&amp;nbsp;

**POWERPLAY**

* Since cycle 48, Aisling Duval has gained 3 profitable systems, Conii, Ekono and Kurichime
* The percentage of systems below the poverty line (overhead+upkeep) has gone down by 3.5%! [*(Current: 64.41%)*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ELyNXGtKSFsOK7uyNto3r4f21SAk1-THyHHNhXeDkVk/pubchart?oid=1569671480&amp;format=interactive)
* The number of our best systems we need to fortify has held steady at the same levels as Cycle 48 *(current total: 23)*

Now interestingly and not suprisingly, the biggest contributor to our deficit is the Overheads. Our Average overhead increases with the number of systems until we have 55 systems or more where it holds steady at 62.1CC per system.

Because of this in cycle 48, when we had 56 systems, in order to absolutely demolish our deficit, we would only had needed to lose 4 of our worst Control Systems. That number has risen to 6 Control Systems or 5 to get within 30 CC of a balanced budget. 

&amp;nbsp;

**If we did scrap [6 of our worst systems](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ELyNXGtKSFsOK7uyNto3r4f21SAk1-THyHHNhXeDkVk/pubchart?oid=678449317&amp;format=interactive)** :

* We would have a surplus above 150 CC. (Predicted: 167.86 CC)
* We would not need to fortify any system to stay afloat. (Predicted: 0)
* We would reduce the percentage of systems below the poverty line by an extra 4% (Predicted: 60.38%)

&amp;nbsp;

In the end this is half of the solution, the other half for keeping a positive balance without fortification is to reduce the number of impoverish control systems such that if we were to rebuild the number of systems we had above 55 systems, we would not be in a deficit. 

Furthermore, targeting the 6 worst systems may not be practically within our means. The further a system is from Cubeo, the easier it will be to get rid of. [Here is the unfortified net income of systems ordered by distance from Cubeo] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ELyNXGtKSFsOK7uyNto3r4f21SAk1-THyHHNhXeDkVk/pubchart?oid=1891558302&amp;format=interactive)

That in the end may require a larger reduction in impoverished systems than the 6 worst.

&amp;nbsp;

**BGS**

There's not much I can say here. [None of our Control Systems] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ELyNXGtKSFsOK7uyNto3r4f21SAk1-THyHHNhXeDkVk/pubchart?oid=1330274046&amp;format=interactive) have been optimized as of yet.

If we were to record the value of fortification and undermining everyday for each control system(or just one) we may be able to pick apart a trend with the data gathered.

Attention diplomats (specifically, player faction leadership and representatives),

In light of the Imperial Defence Force establishment and the relentless growing of our Elite Imperials discord (officially over 190 active members), **you are cordially invited to attend a summit discussing the establishment of a medium of communication via Discord between all Imperials, Xbox or PC.** If you would like to participate in this summit, please send me a private message, and I can answer any questions you may have while also extending an invite to the channel.

We already have representatives from Torval and Patreus on board, and we're hoping you wonderful people would like to get on this as well.

**Shoot me a message!**
If you would like to familiarize yourselves with the server in its current state, please visit the #rules-and-announcements channel[in aisling duval discord] for a persistent invite link.

For the Empire! o7

**AN ASIDE**

I was pleasantly surprised to find that there did indeed exist an imperial discord. I now see an infrastructure of discords that each player could adopt. 

* Their player group's discord
* Their power's discord
* Their major faction's discord.

**For those who like and use discord:** I think this is a format to support though there's nothing stopping you from joining Torval's, ALD's or Patreus' discord :)

* Aisling Duval Discord [Invite Link] (https://discord.gg/0hsajAjOCmFPGhmF)
* Elite Imperials Discord [Invite Link] (https://discord.gg/0gp8J4nu2LfP8Pw9)

**Aisling Duval Discord(ADDiscord) is nearly complete.** The rules cover most if not all of the structure and procedures. there are clear guidelines to how people will have access to secure channels like intel and operations rooms which aisling duval leaders will have complete autonomy to modify the security criteria for.

I have come to the decision that leaders of aisling duval powerplay or player groups should not be entitled to be admins of the discord to lift the burden of managing a communications platform and moderating a community from their shoulders. It is the separation of the military hierarchy from the civilian government. The powerplay work from the community that supports it. **This is different from what I have said prior but I think it's for the best.**

Admins will instead be decided on a basis of meritocracy. More information can be found in [Rules and Procedures] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OSF62ZZvei4IKODfnbWd4BYQhV5q3jK24hJVhkdGLWU/edit?usp=sharing).

In summary you have to be:

* interested
* over 13
* interviewed.

I thought this would be great to share with you on what's going on.
I will try to get a main promotion post for Aisling Discord up soon that will explain everything. I just wanted to share the news that Elite Imperials had so that every player group in aisling is informed.

**Fly safe!**

They should be handed over from members of one expedition returning to the bubble to members of another expedition heading out from the bubble so that they will never return to the bubble. Symbolizing a continued, unbroken and never-ending chain of the spirit of exploration, wanderlust and well wishes to outgoing expeditions.

There are a few rules:

* The chosen tons of brandy once we reach BP must be the ones used. There can be no substitutes.
* If any are lost, they cannot be replaced. This puts importance in their value.
* Each transfer of each ton of brandy between two pilots of two different expeditions must be recorded for future historical value.


On record, I have 7 bottles of Lavian Brandy. Two i'd like to keep for myself (as just regular BP Brandy).
The other five, are in a few people's holds (i'll be contacting each member to ensure they're still in the fleet)

If they haven't met misfortune, I'd like to donate the 5 i have to the fleet for this expressed purpose. If I am unable to procure 5 of what I had, then I would ask the fleet if they'd be willing to join me in this and spare any they have.

I suggest instead **4 types of outlaws**:

* **Pirate** - self-interested group who steal cargo
* **Marauder** - self-interested group who kill pilots
* **Privateer** - hired for-profit group who steal cargo
* **Assassin** - hired for-profit group who kill pilots

Each type can be split into two substypes:

* **Freelancers** - work alone and can vary in quality and reliability
* **Organised** - establish and have less volatile levels of quality and reliability

Notes:

* The catch-all term for all of them is **Outlaw**
* Outlaws that belong in two or more categories may simply be called **Outlaws**, for freelancers, or **Mafia**, for organised groups
* Outlaws who are hired for-profit are known by the supertype **Mercenaries**
* Outlaws who are self-interested are by the supertype **Crooks** (requesting better title or even if it's even required)

I'm suggesting these terms so that we have a vocabulary to talk about different types of outlaws and can move any talk regarding them forward. Let me know what you think. :)
