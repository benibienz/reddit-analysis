169,"Quick prediction, won't be too in depth

Stream Bidder have put up some decent results this season, beating Swarm and almost beating noble (16-14). They also have scoutz, decent player who played for lunatik (now coast). WarFare is more known as venom who had a pretty good showing in the pro placement tournament beating quintic (The team that beat VVV last night). Now the placement tournament was a while ago and there have been some roster changes but the still had a decent showing.

The map is dust2, if you check the teams ESEA pages you will see that both teams played EMP on it. SB won 16-14 and WF won 16-10 on it, take what you want from that though as chain logic isn't always the best. 
Overall if you look at league results SB are 3-7 on esea and 7-6 on cevo (2ffw) and WF are 5-4 on esea and 8-5 on cevo (2ffw).

**My odds:** 55/45 in favour of WF

**Risk:** only bet if you have a gambling problem

**Edit:** [2 months ago WF beat SB on season 19-15](http://cevo.com/event/csgo-scrim/match/187299/)
