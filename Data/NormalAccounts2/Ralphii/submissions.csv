I have always loved organizing group events and started hosting 10 mans with friends + others. I have also always wanted to try casting, so what I have done is combined the two. I have created a steam group that is meant for creating tournaments for players trying to break into the competitive scene of CS. Most of the people in the group are between GN1 and LEM but any skill level is fine! After all, it is all for free and you might as well get some experience. Currently there is signups for a 5v5 tourny taking place on the 18th of July. We are located in NA but may branch to EU if it gets popular enough.
