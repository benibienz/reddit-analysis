Police.

&gt;I've never encountered a rule remotely like this one in the Netherlands...

You also have legalized prostitution, which we don't have in 49 out of 50 states. This country was founded by Quakers, who are very prudish people. We have yet to get over ourselves when it comes to nudity. Add in the church's control over the city (as I said previously) and you have a perfect storm for a place where repressed sexually frustrated people go and commit crimes and hurt women for not ""putting out.""

4,"&gt; Though, health complications can still sneak up and surprise you! 
 Three of our rescue/ shelter cats all required expensive vet treatment after adoption for issues that the shelter or rescue didn't know about.

Our tripod rescue? Her tail had been smashed in a door prior to when we adopted her. Our vet thought the fur loss was from ringworm, but it was the end of her tail dying and desiccating. The vet also thinks that the tail injury happened at the same time as whatever it happened with her leg (we adopted her 10 days post amputation, and we ***HIGHLY*** suspect abuse. She was 8 weeks old when we adopted her... ).       

When we took her back to the vet because the ""ringworm"" wasn't going away, the end of her tail fell off in the office. Surgery was required to remove the dead tissue and bone from her tail. She also is a carrier for the viral kitty-cold. She can just sneeze on one of the other cats and they get ill. She passed it around the house to the other two cats, so they required medical treatment (antivirals) as well to get everyone healthy again. We got her from the Humane Soc. on a ""free cat Friday,"" which was really $10 due to county collar/ leash laws. 

Another cat (from a rescue) actually did have ringworm, which took some time to get rid of. Medications and baths every other day with a special medicated soap. A few hundred more dollars in vet bills when we got her.

Our newest cat was from a rescue and had Coccidia, Giardia, and a tapeworm, but they told us **and** provided paperwork that ""said"" he was healthy. BOTH of the intestinal bugs (Coccidia and Giardia) got passed around the house too, twice in one case, because it was impossible to keep this kitten isolated past the 2-3 week mark. That ended up costing is around $2700 in vet bills, AND because of the issues we had with the rescue when we asked for help with the medical stuff, they did not pay to get him neutered when it was time, nor refund the amount for the neuter that was supposedly included in the ""adoption fee"" (which is against FL law if your ""adoption fee"" is supposed to include that, which the paperwork says it did).

For the amount of money we have spent on ""rescue/ humane society"" pets, we could have gotten purebreds with a health guarantee. For how much we spent on the last one, we could have gotten a fucking Savannah.

71,"&gt;There are many people that work on a computer, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, that barely understand the machine they are attempting to operate. And somehow, this is considered acceptable by employers.

&gt;Could you imagine this type of situation with any other type of job?

I work in a big 5 bank, in a reporting/ reconciliation department. 100% of our work is provided in Excel reports from our data analytics dept. Everything we work is done in our banking systems, but the notifications about what needs to be worked are in Excel reports. We then have to save copies of the reports with edits notating completion/ complications/ errors/ etc.

About three years ago we got two new people on our team (internal transfers), one of them has been with the company for over 10 years (keep this in mind).

**We had to teach her how to use Excel.**

My department is responsible for pausing or halting foreclosure activity if the bank is not ready to foreclose (borrower working out repayment plan, declared bankruptcy, need certain legal documents signed, that kind of thing). We also restart it when everything is ready to go. There are also reports that deal with calculating what fees we can charge the customer, or handling deceased borrower files, but everything we touch is *somehow* foreclosure related. 

It took me 3+hrs to teach her how to do a VLookup in Excel **using the formula generator!!!!!**

She still doesn't understand how to use the filter tool in Excel.

How do you work at a BANK for TEN YEARS and get away with not knowing how to use Excel?

Doesn't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside?

74,"TL;DR - A story about one of the closest human-cat bonds I've ever seen in person.

&gt; I wouldn't give her up for anything, she's like a piece of my soul.

It's very nice to see someone put this into words about their cat.

I've seen a relationship between a cat and a human that was as close to an animal-familiar type bond and it truly is amazing. 

My husband had a cat when we got together who was about 10 years old and he had raised since around 2-3 months of age. She had been a feral cat living on his fencing instructors property and my husband decided to take her in.

She was one of the smartest cats I have ever had the pleasure of knowing, and I know for a fact that she understood spoken English to the point of being creepy.

In a joking manner my husband once said to the cat, ""Bite her Beahr,"" not 2 seconds later she had turned her head towards me and bit me on my head (100% truth, I swear on my life).

When she started to get sick from early kidney failure, she had to stay a few days at the vet so they could stabilize her (we found her unable to use her back legs when we didn't see any symptoms of an issue to that point) and my husband went to go see her on the second day because he missed her.

The techs at the vet took him back to the enclosures in the back to visit her on the second day. When he took Beahr out of the cage and held her, she put her head down on his chest, closed her eyes and started purring. The tech that took him to the back and one that was already back there saw this level of commitment and love between the cat and my husband and started crying. They had never seen a cat-human bond quite that strong, dedicated, and trusting. (It's also a cat-only vet, they're absolutely amazing.)

They said the look on her face was completely trusting and that it was a ""Daddy makes me feel better,"" just by being able to hold her for a few minutes.

Sorry this got long, but cherish every moment you have with her. My husband lost Beahr when she was just over 20 and by the math, he'd had been living with her for half of his lifetime. It hit him very hard and he still mourns her.",2016-11-13 15:42:46+00:00,d9yhze2,4.0,t1_d9y2csn,40653.0,AskReddit
75,"We adopt rescue cats and I can really relate to this. 

We joke about which would survive if they were put outside (***which we would never do***) and the tripod [Trinity](http://imgur.com/a/XM3VR) wins every time. She ""kills"" any treats you give her with a violent headshake.

Not a half-assed jiggle, a full-on rodent neck-cracking shake. We think she may have been feral before the abuse/ injury/ surgery because of her reactions. She just *can't* be picked up off the floor, petting her (on the floor) is hit or miss, and she acts like she's going to be hit all the time.

If she's elevated, like on the back of the couch, up on the bed, or on one of the cat trees, you're more likely to be able to pet her, but there's no guarantee. When the lights go off and we lay down in bed to go to sleep? She is GLUED to my legs and purring like a semi-automatic weapon (purrrr, breath, purrrr, breath, she's never really learned how to purr and breathe at the same time but it's cute as hell). If you can reach her when she's there she will throw her head back and **demand** chin scritches, but when you're laying down on the bed is literally the only place you can love on her and she isn't completely terrified at first.

We've had her since she was about 2 months old and we have ***NEVER*** hit that cat, even accidentally, or during play.

Your $500 ER visit really wasn't that expensive because of the services rendered *to you*, it also accounted for other people with the same injury who didn't pay.

137,"I had to go hunt it down. Last time I shared it was 2+ years ago.

&gt;So I have been making a version of this dip for about 17 years, and it has changed quite a bit from then to now. I always feel like my latest version is my best, but of course, that is subjective.

&gt;There is little to no cooking involved depending on how you want to make it. I'm a danger to myself and others in the kitchen, and have managed to slice open my finger (twice!!) with an unserrated butter knife while washing dishes. So please excuse me for feeling this is one of my best recipes, it's one of the few things I make at all.

&gt;Ingredients:

&gt;* Spices (optional) - Chili Powder, Onion powder, dried cilantro flakes, and [Penzey's Spices Bold Taco seasoning](https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/bold-taco-seasoning/c-24/p-522/pd-s)

&gt;* 1 can refried beans

&gt;* 1 box of Rice-a-roni (Spanish Style) - alternative ingredient guacamole

&gt;* ~8-12oz Sour Cream (I buy the 16oz size so I have enough if I need more than 8-10oz. You can infuse this with some heat to make it interesting, Breakstone had a jalapeno infused sour cream that was really good with this but it's not available here anymore.)

&gt;* 1 -16oz jar of salsa (chose your preference of heat).

&gt;* 1 package of bacon pieces (from the salad isle, or make your own bacon bits)

&gt;* 1 small can of chopped or sliced black olives

&gt;* One- 2 cup pkg of finely shredded mozzarella cheese (I know! I know! But it works trust me.)

&gt;*of course you can substitute your own version of these ingredients. If you want to make your own bacon pieces instead of buying them, or if you want to make a guacamole and use that instead of Rice-a-roni, it's up to you! This is about what* ***YOU*** *like in a dip. This is just how* ***I*** *make it.*

&gt;The refried beans are a bit stiff to add directly to the first layer without working them a bit (your chips will break often unless you do this). Put the can of beans in a small saucepan and add about 1/4 can of water to it to help loosen up the consistency. Mix well. Over low heat add in spices (Chili Powder, Onion Powder and Taco Seasoning) to taste. I was cautious with mine, and I used maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a *teaspoon* of each. The Taco seasoning probably got up to 3/4 of a teaspoon.

&gt;Once that flavor has melded, take off heat and layer refried beans onto a large serving plate. I use a big monster of a plate for it.

&gt;While the beans are cooking, you can start the Rice-a-roni (or your homemade guac). I add a few oz of the salsa to the recipe instead of the diced tomatoes called for on the side of the box. It gives a bit more flavor imo. 

&gt;So once the refried beans are on the plate, add the finished Rice-a-roni as the next layer. You should probably wait until this cools off before adding the 3rd layer, unless you went with Guac instead. I stick mine in a freezer until the plate is between body-temp to cool (not frozen).

&gt;The third layer is sour cream.

&gt;The fourth is salsa. If I have issues with it running down the side, I poke a few holes down to the rice using toothpicks or wooden skewers. The rice soaks up the salsa very nicely if you use too much. Keeping the sour cream between the two prevents the rice from becoming soggy and unedible. If it's a particularly runny salsa, you can also drain off some of the excess liquid before applying it to the previous layers. Remember this is going on a plate, not in a bowl. (I have never had issues using regular Pace chunky salsa, barely any draining necessary, tilt the spoon against the rim for a sec, add to dip, rinse and repeat.) This is only a thin layer to prevent it from being a runny mess, you will ***NOT*** use the entire bottle, maybe just over half from the rice and the straight salsa use.

&gt;After that I add in my chopped (or sliced) black olives and bacon bits to taste. If you like them, add lots of them. Fair warning, too much bacon can really take over. Lastly cover with the finely shredded mozzarella cheese.

&gt;I know I should use a better cheese, but I did say this was a Mexican -style- dip. If you want to use a taco blend to be more authentic, be my guest! The bacon bits aren't exactly standard either! ;)

&gt;The whole thing ends up looking like a big white burial mound on a plate. It's not the runny/ watery consistency of most failed layered dips if done correctly, and I have gotten ***RAVE*** reviews whenever I have taken it in to work during a pot-luck (when I'm not working with a bunch of catty bitches).

206,"Just an FYI- I was editing that post for a bit so you may not have caught everything I said.

As for when people ask questions....  something to keep in mind is that you should never feel like you have to justify yourself to anyone. It's your body, your choice, and nobody else's business. 

It's a hard lesson to learn and I'm not judging you in the least because it's a lesson that I am still working through myself. Some recent drama that I've been going through at work is because I felt that I had to justify/ prove something that I went through recently (surgery). 

I sent an eMail to my coworkers the day after surgery with a picture of my arm in the surgical dressings and a brace. That spiraled into a shitstorm of drama and among other shit, I had to file an HR complaint. I also figured out that my manager has been undermining me at every turn, and painting me as the troublesome employee when nothing could be further from the truth (I'm quiet and withdrawn). At my overdue mid-year review he told me that if he had any choice in the matter he would never choose to work with me (due to how much he dislikes those aspects of my personality).

He leaves our department Monday, and I couldn't be happier. He has done nothing but ruin my name and paint me to be the difficult one to work with. He talked to others and has ruined my chances of being treated fairly at work until I can build a new rapport with the manager taking his spot Monday.

I spoke with HR about it, and I've met with his boss who has assured me that my review will be based solely on my work and professionalism, rather than my managers personal opinions about me as a person.

And it ALL stems from me not being able to just say, **""It's none of your damned business,""** when things started unfolding, or when shit got personal. Learn from my fuckup.",2016-10-28 01:09:19+00:00,d9ata1v,8.0,t1_d9aoimm,6982.0,childfree
207,"I was very adamant about getting my tubes tied while we had the chance. It just all fit together at the right time.

1) I qualified as a domestic partner on my (then) boyfriends health insurance.

2) My doctor was perfectly fine with it (at 27, unmarried, with no kids)

3) Our health insurance ranked sterilization as an ordinary procedure for men or women (and it was pretty damn cheap. It was a $200 co-payment for an out patient surgical procedure, male or female. It surprised me that it was the same classification because it's much more of a process for women, requiring general anaesthesia, but for men its just a local and a 20 minute operation)

4) We were notified very early about how the insurance plan was changing for some reason (I think because he worked for the insurance company directly), so we were able to plan ahead and get both procedures done before it changed (it was tripling in price if I remember correctly).

210,"&gt;* Are there any common issues when getting one?

Pain and some light bleeding from the wound as with any surgical procedure.

&gt;* What's the failure rate?

Minimal depending on how the procedure is performed. Cauterization is more effective than just severing the sperm pipeline. Research it based on the type of procedure your urologist performs.

&gt;* What about my orgasm would change?

Not a damn thing. Your cum doesn't change noticeably, you just no longer have sperm in it.

&gt;* What about my sex drive would change?

Again, nothing.

&gt;* Am I at risk for any mental problems after having one?

Not unless you actually do want kids, 
and therefore made the wrong choice.

&gt;* If my insurance doesn't cover it, what's the average cost to have one?

Call your urologist to find out. In the end it's a surgical procedure, so it's not going to be cheap. I have yet to hear of a health insurance plan that doesn't cover it. You may have to pay a deductible or coinsurance payment depending on what type of insurance plan you have though, so don't expect it to be free even though it's covered.

&gt;* Will having one put me out of work for any amount of time?

3 days, maybe 4. Best to get it done on a Thursday or Friday and take the weekend to recover. Buy several bags of frozen peas to use as malleable cold-packs. You might get a prescription for a few days of painkillers too.

My husband said that the worst part was unexpected jostling around, so he kept the majority of the padding and bandage stuff from the day of the procedure (discarding the bloody bits), and wore his tighty whitey underwear over it to keep things from moving around until he healed.

This is why my MIL wasn't at our wedding, she didn't want to come unless she could bring her asshole SO (who is emphatically NOT my husband's father) to the wedding too. The last family ""occasion"" we'd been at, with him present, was a funeral and he was disrespectful, disruptive, and had no qualms about being an ass in a setting where it was wildly inappropriate (he spanked my MIL just before the internment, he blew the car horn as he drove into the cemetery to try and make us jump, and afterwards when everyone was socializing and reconnecting with distant relatives he purposely followed my husband around to flick cigarette ashes onto my husband's shirt). This was **her SIL's funeral.**

My husband said that she was welcome to come by herself, or with another friend, but that her SO was not welcome (and rightfully so, those weren't the only times he was a complete asshole to my husband or to us as a couple). Since her SO wasn't welcome she didn't come, but we hired an off-duty police officer to remove them if necessary (turned out we needed him, but not for that reason).

The man couldn't act with the slightest bit of decorum *AT A FUNERAL,* so my husband wasn't going to let him try to ruin our wedding, and I'm sure he would have tried to do so (he once broke the antenna off of my car ""just because"").

This ended up with us being illegally evicted from the house we were renting from her, and we went NC for almost 10 years. NC was broken when my husband got a call from his mom, she begged him not to hang up until she could say why she called (since that was his standard response when she called him), telling him that his favorite uncle had died.

NC has been broken since then and we are now VLC/LC with them. Her SO avoids going out with us so that he won't fuck up the relationship again, and we think that being NC for 8-9 years made my MIL more aware of the shit he pulls and she has said that his actions are unacceptable.

274,"I had a coworker tell me I should have, ""beat the shit out of &lt;cat&gt;"" for mauling me last week.

First, I had been holding him down so my husband could shave a mat off of gis hindquarters. He tried to escape 3 times and couldn't get away.

Second, my husband reached for him after he put down the shaver. The cat was already terrified and the human who ""hurt"" him is now trying to take him away from his favorite human.

That's when Nimitz lost it and mauled me. He bit **through** my finger, and sliced up the back of my hand and my forearm with his claws. I was dripping blood by the time I made it to the bathroom.

It was NOT an intentional attack, it was *Fight or Flight: With 3 previous escape attempts (flight) not working.* 

This same woman said her autistic son **shouldn't be held liable for headbutting the teacher who was tying him to a chair at school.** I know one is a human and one is a cat but she couldn't see how hypocritical she was being and it ***REALLY*** pissed me off.

Less than 24hrs after the attack my finger was very obviously infected (leaking yellow and brown puss) and I was already at urgent care to get it looked at. I'm on Augmentin now, and I won't be losing any fingers.

I have a 4 inch long ragged edge gash in my forearm that looks horrible and a few other scratches. The puncture I couldn't clean well enough to prevent infection due to the immediate swelling from the crushing force.",2016-10-18 02:39:30+00:00,d8wp10q,6.0,t1_d8vyima,33635.0,fatpeoplestories

Just giving birth or breastfeeding would pass it along.

You may have to look at some bargain places, or even consider calling one of those signs you see by the side of the road offering mattresses for cheap. It's not the best option, but it's better than nothing. If you do this, you should probably get a non-permeable mattress cover (like a plastic one for bed wetters) until you're sure there are no bedbugs or prior user smells/ stains.

&gt;And clothes that are business appropriate? 

Goodwill my friend. Goodwill. Also, Salvation Army, or other second hand reseller places. Make sure to wash them before wearing, please. 

If you're affiliated with a church they may be able to help through a second hand program for both clothing and furniture.

When we were starting out, we also looked at things left by the side of the road. I know it's not the best, and often you'll get things that are unsuitable, but sometimes you can find working lamps, tables that need a small repair, etc.

I found a wooden room-divider that I had my mom refinish (she also sanded down the bottom which was swollen from water damage) and she put in a bunch of pictures of fairies from the internet in all of the slots for them.

OP sounds pretty damn cool honestly. Those people could all be towed just for being on her property, instead she tried to be responsible and ask that no one block her in (which is also quoted below in another point).

Sounds like they had plenty of warning. This has happened enough that OP has installed ""No Parking"" signs and they still chose to turn off their cars and leave them in a spot that blocked access to OP's home.

* If she had yelled loudly at the party goers, move your cars or get towed the this would be a proper revenge. The people there had no idea. She is just an entitled bitch who targets people for profit.

The party-throwing neighbor even had forewarning. All she had to do was ask as people arrived to make sure no one was parked illegally blocking OP's **private driveway.**

* Moreover she just ruined the life of a kid getting her a DUI in a situation she orchestrated. 

So OP made the underage kid drink, and forced her to attempt to drive the car by what? Holding a gun to her head? Oh wait she didn't.

532,"It's becoming a much more common ailment these days, I think statistically, it's 3 out of every 10 children are diagnosed with Atopic now.

From things that I have heard from my doctors and from my personal experiences, this disease is occurring more often due to higher amounts of children with allergies than ever before. My orthopedic surgeons PA asked me if I also suffered from asthma and/ or chronic bronchitis, as those ailments also have a high occurrence rate within the Atopic community. If you have Atopic you almost certainly also suffer from chronic lung issues.

I was diagnosed a little over thirty years ago at the age of 5-6 years old. Initially, my pediatric physician diagnosed me with run-of-the-mill eczema and gave my mother a photocopy of the explanation, symptoms, and treatment guide from that really big comprehensive medical diagnosis book (don't know the name of it). 

However, my symptoms were not a perfect match, and my triggers were not the ones listed specifically for eczema. BUT, on the photocopy there was a tiny part of the page outlining a different disease (Atopic), and it perfectly matched with my symptoms and allergies. 

The next time we went back to him, **I** pointed the discrepancy out to the doctor and told him that we thought it was this other one listed in the photocopy (yes, I did this at 5-6 years old. My mother was insanely proud of me doing that so young and I was told that story repeatedly throughout the years).

Something that really helped me as a kid (and I just don't have access to right now) is taking a daily dip in a well maintained, chlorinated pool. It shouldn't have worked, and my doctor said that should make my skin worse, but it really helped manage the outbreaks and would help clear them up.

I've also noticed through the years that I can spread the outbreaks unintentionally by scratching, and through testing with anti-fungal dandruff shampoo, I think that the spreading of the outbreaks is caused by an underlying fungal infection. I know that this theory sounds batshit crazy, but because we dont have the very top layers of skin that we should due to the disease, we do not have the naturally occurring protection from simple flora/ fauna that dont typically affect people who do have all of the naturally occurring layers of skin.

I've been able to control or slow down the escalation of outbreaks using an OTC dandruff shampoo on the affected areas as a substitute for body wash. I'd highly recommend trying it out, on a small patch of skin to ensure that it won't trigger an outbreak first, but its become part of my showering routine and it really seems to help.

I apologize for writing a novel on it, but when I was a kid I had no one to go to and ask for advice, even my doctor said it would be a trial and error thing because there was so little source material for the disease and treatment for it. So I hope you get some benefits from my novel here.

Known allergens for me: peanuts, tomatoes (IE- the nightshade plant family), shellfish, fish blood/ juices (due to the iodine content), chocolate, large amounts of dairy, high citric acid content fruits (lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit, etc) and some other stuff I'm sure I'm missing. 

Thank god I've completely grown out of the chocolate and tomatoes allergies entirely (and the peanuts and citric acid allergies have lessened  significantly), because I friggen love them.

The investigator will interview all current employees privately (away from management and behind closed doors) so you will not be forced to speak about the pay issues in front of the owner/ manager. 

They will research paystubs for a specific number of years, so even people who no longer work for the company will receive restitution, and in the eyes of management, could be blamed for the investigation.

612,"You can mention him, but I wouldn't say that he refuses to get snipped, it can be considered a sign of reluctance on his part about how committed to the CF lifestyle he is.

Definitely say he's CF, and maybe the excuse for him being ""au naturale"" is that he cannot undergo the procedure (and don't make up an ailment that you will forget.. hemophilia is a good one to use, or just say you can't remember why he can't get it at the moment).

In your position I would be concerned about his reluctance to get a vasectomy. It changes nothing about the amount of pleasure received from sex, it just ensures that no ""little swimmers"" join the party.

Tubals are more likely to ~~fall~~ fail than vasectomies, so if he still refuses to get snipped you may still end up on the wrong side of a pregnancy test. (I'm not trying to scare you, but I'd be lying if I said that a tubal ligation is idiot-proof.)

You can also tell the doctor that you absolutely will get an abortion if you ever do fall preggers, because it's another way of stressing how committed to remaining CF you are. They might use a different technique to ensure the tubal has less of a chance to fail. 

Personally, I have ""clips"" on my tubes, but other versions of the procedure have a complete ~~removed~~ removal of the fallopian tubes, so if your doctor is willing to perform the operation, ask about how it's done and talk it out with your GYN.

She has manipulated the situation (and our friend) into letting *her* decide where they move to, even though he will be the primary bread winner and she only has a part time job that she is likely to lose soon.

620,"*(Holy shit this got long, sorry about that!!)*

I'm not the person you replied to, but I'm going to weigh in with my opinion on this question.

No, I don't think that this will positively influence your GYNs decision on whether or not to perform a tubal ligation on you. Saying that you have mental illness, no matter how controlled it is, brings into question your decision making ability. 

Unfortunately, your youth is also going to work against you here, ""you don't know what you want yet,"" ""what if the perfect man for you wants children?"" etc.

Arguments that include passing on genetic disorders, mentioning that adopting if you want children later in life, and your ""perfect man"" would not want children either, are the arguments that I used with my doctor. Already being in a committed relationship at the time with an equally CF fiance was helpful (interestingly enough, relationship status is information that you have to provide to them, it's not something that they can confirm -*hint, hint*-).

You have to present a well thought out, intelligent, concise, and complete case for why **permanent** sterilization is a good procedure for you, because there are multiple ways to prevent conception. 

Hormonal birth control pills. IUD, both hormonal and non (I think), the depoprovera shot, etc. You need to be able to argue or present reasons why those options are not your preferred treatment plan and why.

Unfortunately, you may be forced into an IUD/ birth control pills treatment plan until your GYN is satisfied that you are 100% dead serious about never having children. Or, they become the first stop in a list of doctor appointments until you find the right one who will take you at your word. 

If you tell a GYN that you would seriously consider self-harm or suicide if you become pregnant and can't afford an abortion is likely to infer to the doctor that you are mentally unstable and unable to make that decision due to mental illness. You need to convince them that you are of sound mind and have the capacity to make a lifelong decision at this stage in your life.

Another few things that you can do if your doctor says no initially are: 

1) Ask them what you can do to convince them that you are absolutely, positively, 100% dead serious about this request. If you did something to inadvertently convince them that you are not serious, this question can help you clear that up by reopening the discussion. 

2) Tell them that you trust them (assuming that this is a GYN that you have established a doctor-patient relationship with) and that you would prefer that your procedure be performed by a doctor that you know you can trust, instead of going from office to office to find someone who will agree to perform the procedure. This is another way of communicating to your doctor exactly how serious you are about never having biological children. Unfortunately, this is also just a little manipulative, and your doctor may not respond to it positively, so if it was me, I'd only use this as a last resort.

3) Remind the GYN of all of the other types of life-impacting decisions that you can make at your age. You can choose to enlist in the military, which can result in lifelong trauma or even death. You can drink. You can drive (but not at the same time, obviously). You can vote. You can run for public office. You can move overseas. You can purchase a firearm, etc. 

4) Point out the hypocrisy. People your age can have children, and no one tells them that they are too young to make that decision for themselves. Why do they think that you are too young to know your own mind when you are requesting a procedure that is the opposite of the decision to carry a baby to term, deliver, and be saddled with a mini-human for the next 20 years? 

I hope that my long ass rambling point can help you on your path to sterilization. Don't give up hope if you get denied the procedure, it's also possible that your doctor can give you a recommendation to another practice that will be willing to help you out.",2016-09-18 03:10:47+00:00,d7rcgrc,3.0,t1_d7qpelx,36747.0,childfree

Another thing she said is that it's also very telling about the people who chose to ignore that aspect of themselves (or who ignore their current life circumstances) and go into it blind, or with the expectations that everything will work out even if they're piss broke and living in a studio apartment.

I beat myself up for **years** over the section I bolded and an old flame. We ended up separating for other reasons (he was manipulated into thinking he wasn't good enough for me by a ~~mutual friend~~ third party who wanted him for herself), but I always beat myself up over ""What if?"" [Karma: She didn't get him either.]

It's NOT worth it. I know that now, and I'm happy that I didn't go against my conscience if circumstances had played out differently. I know now that I would be a horrible mother. I am happy that I don't have any kids, and I don't know that even *he* could have made up the difference for my lack of maternal instincts.

I know it sucks, and you will always care for him (I still love my ex), but it just wouldn't have worked for us. I would have probably hurt myself and/ or any children in the picture. I am most definitely not suited to being a parent, and trying to ignore that would have been unfair or harmful to everyone involved.

What little ""mothering"" instinct I have is set aside for my cats. I would do anything for them, I don't think I could say the same for any potential human children. I have forgiven my cats for doing things that I could not stand coming from an immature human.

I also know that I would have potentially given a human child my skin disease, and I know from first hand experience how horrible that was as a kid. In my father it affected less than 5% of his skin (just a spot on his nose), in me I'm affected over at least 50% of my body under normal conditions. In **one generation** it multiplied itself by a factor of ten. Which means it would be full body coverage for any of my kids in a worst case scenario. I would also pass it along to them just by touch while in extreme infancy, so I'd have to refrain from skin-to-skin contact (something almost all the frigging books and motherhood advice columns insist increases the bond between mother and baby) until they developed their own immune system, instead of mine (which is susceptible to my skin disease).

I really went off on a tangent, but you should start looking for those reasons for ""why this wouldn't have worked in the long run."" It will help you put the loss behind you and move on, which I know feels impossible right now.

PM me if you need to. I'm probably a bit older than you, but it might help if you could use some perspective or need a shoulder.

Not a damn thing.

You cannot just grab someone's wallet and search it in the US unless there are extremely extenuating circumstances like suspected theft. 

Next big hole in this story, there is no ""disability card"" anywhere in the US, so the OP is just a karma-whoring fiction writer testing out his chops.

Lastly, even in a theft situation the customer can refuse to be searched until police arrive (because the police can order a search of personal property based on Loss Preventions suspicion of theft).

Either of my reasons here can answer the question, you're overlooking the other one. This postman was likely being told off by his supervisor and eager to fix the misdelivery. If it's happened enough a serious reprimand or his job could be on the line, leading to an error in judgment on the questions he asked.

Of course you should never let a stranger into your house, but people are human and make mistakes. If this is a really small town, a question like that may not seem like the huge invasion that it would be taken as in a more metropolitan area. It could also be an age thing, we won't ever know for sure. 

Very simply put, I highly doubt that this was a scam, considering that I also have personal experience with a missing package investigation launched by a post office and this sounds like exactly what happened.

750,"Yeah, the klan had a very strong presence there. House parties would have at least one person telling/ handing out a sheet of paper with racist jokes on it. When the 4H club leader was replaced with a black woman from the next town over it damn near caused a riot. If a black family stopped at the Dairy Queen (we didn't even have a McD's or Wal-Mart, it was a 3-4 stoplight town) while passing through there would be two rows of empty tables all around where they were sitting, and the townies would stand and eat instead of taking a table ""too close"" to the black family. 

Just before we left a family that was newer to the town adopted a black child, and it caused quite an uproar. Kids ***and TEACHERS*** threw rocks at him when he showed up at school.

The town was also full of misogynistic men, who refused to believe that my mother drove a motorcycle to &lt;location&gt;. They would always ask who drove her there since she obviously couldn't have done it (but since she was carrying a helmet it was obvious that was how she got there). Mom also had full big gulp cups of soda/ icee thrown at her while she was driving down the highway. 

It sounds completely unbelievable that this could have been happening in ~1990, but it was. I was told by my parents that I couldn't talk about my Native American ancestry (it's back a bit, so I look 100% caucasian) or about my best friend that I had left behind in our previous city, since she was black.

One of my closest friends in the world lives across the country from me and we have only met in person once (when she flew down to be in my wedding). I asked her to be in my wedding sight unseen. I didn't give a shit what she looked like. She wanted to decline because she didn't want to ruin my pictures due to her (very bad, IE rotting) teeth, which she had fixed a few years later. I told her I didn't care if she was green with purple polka dots (something I used to ask my mother when I was very little, ""would you still love me if I had XXX?"") and that *as my heart-sister* she was required to come, if she could, even if I had to pay for everything for her.

I wasn't even there to pick her up at the airport because my bosses were complete dickheads. So telling my husband and my parents, to look for the woman with hair down to her ass was fun, but you know what? They did it. They did it because they cared for me, and she did it because she cared for me.

My friend flew down from NY (a state she had never left in her life) to sleep on my couch for two days and shared a hotel room with me the next. Then she had to find her own way back to the airport (I helped with taxi money, because she was piss broke).

We ""met"" because we both played an online computer game and we started talking. We talked a lot, usually 4-5 times a week. One day I asked for her phone number. After that we spoke on the phone, a lot. 

She is like a sister to me and we end our phone calls with, ""I love you,"" just like blood family would (in normal circumstances). She has a kid and I don't. She doesn't judge me in any way for my choice and she tells me that she thinks I'm an amazing and brave person for being able to say that kids aren't for me, and to make that informed decision.

synonyms:	madman, madwoman, maniac, lunatic, psychotic, sociopath;     

One act of revenge does not establish that the OP has a chronic problem with abnormal or violent behavior. Furthermore, taking revenge against someone who messed with your laundry isn't abnormal at all. It's an unspoken, general rule of laundromat infractions against the party who messed with your shit first.

1025,"We just went on the oldest ship in the Carnival fleet &lt; 3 weeks ago. It was still a good cruise, and we've had our share of bad experiences on cruises before.

When we went on the Oasis of the Seas (RC, biggest class of cruise ship in their fleet and relatively new) we had worse customer service due to the confusion around certain programs we signed up for, like the drinks package, due to the newness of the ship and the program. Some of the employees hadn't been ""seasoned"" enough on the boat to know that you can't be an *el pendejo* to an angry customer. Eventually someone will be willing to submit complaints to every higher up in the company via eMail carpet bombing (like my husband).

We've also had our share of bad experiences with Carnival, some was circumstantial (sailed around Hurricane Wilma on our honeymoon, people were getting sick everywhere, which made the staff especially cranky), and some experiences where the employees were just outright rude.

The cruise 3 weeks ago had a tender manager who was going to try and shove another 100 people on the boat that was trying to leave for the ship, when there wasn't even room for 10 people *standing up.*

We filed an escalated complaint because this idiot **was willing to sacrifice passenger safety** to try and save on fuel (our educated guess about his motivation) and for being an outright *el pendejo* to people who wanted to get out of the sun and into the covered line area for the next friggin boat (different waiting areas). He angrily cussed at someone for walking to a shady spot so they weren't in direct sunlight, while he twiddled his thumbs, yelled at the boat that had had already cast off, and tried to throw his self-importance around like it meant something.

Basically though, I've had good experiences the majority of the time. The bad ones are rare, and most of the time when you do complain the company listens and gets stuff fixed.",2016-08-18 05:39:31+00:00,d6m9h1b,4.0,t1_d6lgzmw,40928.0,TheSilphRoad

1062,"That's one of the most infuriating things in this thread. I'm very sorry. 

I was bullied relentlessly through school. My skin disease made me a target, my extremely curly and out of control hair was also a target. One morning I got to school (I rode the bus and always tried to sit near the front due to the fucking bullying) and I let all the kids get off before me. I was crying and hiding it because it was a rough morning ride to school. I think this was middle school, I know it wasn't HS.

The bus driver stops me on the way out and asks me why my hair is full of paper balls. I said it was because the kids behind me were doing it and they wouldn't stop. I probably had an entire sheet of paper balls (luckily NOT spit balls, just launched the same, they were dry) that I shook out of my hair next to the driver (/pettyrevenge for not controlling the kids). She was honestly shocked that it had happened under her nose (I was only 4-5 rows back) and said I got to ride behind her now.

I didn't care about the potential fallout from that change (surprisingly none), because I hated children, even when I was one. I have been making friends with people older than me since I was a kid. 

I was teased for being different and awkward at every single school I went to (**all eleven of them**). In my sophomore year I went to one of the dances, and surprised the hell out of everyone by both wearing makeup and a formfitting, somewhat short dress.

Funny thing about doing that if you are hiding a ""good"" body like I was. I went from being a target in one sense of the word, to being a target in another, but at least they stopped making me want to kill myself.",2016-08-16 14:44:45+00:00,d6jqegb,2.0,t1_d6ji3zn,17655.0,AskReddit

1064,"I had a similiar experience. Kid threw a brick at my head (and connected) at the bus stop, got a concussion. School said that there was nothing they could do since it wasn't school property, mom researched it and found out otherwise (it IS technically school property).

My mother had to sit at the bus stop in her car for weeks (had to rearrange her entire work schedule to do it too) before she decided that I was safe again. Those kids never got punished. One of those boys taunted me the day after in the lunchroom. I slapped the fuck out of him, concussion and all. My actions were not only on school property, but witnessed by administration, and could not go unpunished (even though concussions make people do weird shit sometimes, and I'm non-violent to a fault. I'm convinced that the concussion had something to do with my physical violence).

Anyway, the joke is on that kid. He turned on my artistic side with the brain injury. I couldn't draw a straight line with a ruler before, I became a damn good sketch artist afterwards (before I let it slide).

1067,"You are allowed your interpretation, and I mine. Until the most recent debacle, fictional stories were practically a hallmark and welcomed. Now there is the acknowledged chance that they might be fictional (as long as the events aren't so outlandish that people call bullshit, which I personally don't care for).

Given my experience with the story mentioned in my original comment on the topic, I know that most people I tell that story to think I'm inventing a big pile of bullshit on the spot for attention. However, I know that there is at least half of an entire boat full of people who thought their damn cruise ship was leaving in the middle of the scheduled stop in Cyprus. I saw them on the pier, madly jumping and waving, because when so many mooring lines have snapped, and the boat is getting pounded by damn near hurricane force winds, you have to just call it and go out into open water until shit calms down. Our captain was given shit by another one at the next port for losing a gangway in the mess (they were having lunch together in one of the public dining rooms, and it was pre-Sept-11. And let me say here Sept 11th happening on a vacation cruise overseas was hell).

One of those snapped mooring lines hit someone on the dock that day. I'm positive it shattered his arm, and he's lucky that it didn't take his life.

This cruise was *during* September 11th 2001 (though that was a few days out at the time, we were in Eygpt on 9/9/2001) so finding any articles to back my story up are difficult.

But, I think that if this is to be interpreted the way you seem to understand it, then exactly no exaggeration should be allowed. No Jurrasic Park water jiggles, no thunderous footsteps, none of it. My understanding is, that with the no fiction-specific interpretation, those stories with exaggeration fall into FPH territory.

*(Swapping back to how I feel/ interpret it)*

But when you can feel her purring on the backs of your legs, it makes everything worth it. I will never give up on her. Never.

1137,"&gt; The whole point is that **no one with bipolar disorder can ever be rid of the disease**; in contrast, some people with depression/OCD/***BPD***/etc. can recover entirely and no longer have a chemically imbalanced brain.

You're still saying that BPD can both be cured, and that it can't.

Cognitive therapy can help people deal with the chemical imbalance present in their brains. It does nothing to correct the chemical imbalance, it instead teaches people how to deal with the imbalance, by applying logic, Pavlov-like reward training, or other stimulation that can work in the short term by releasing dopamine to counteract the low serotonin.

People who are suffering from short term bouts of depression do not have as much of the chemical imbalance (if any at all) as someone who is diagnosed with chronic depression, or major depressive disorder. The people with the former type of depression are ""down"" due to an outside influence on their lives that is short term like grief (death of a friend/ loved one/ family member/ etc.).

Short term depression due to outside factors, and it's ""cure"" rate really throws off the numbers in regards to mental illness treatment and recovery. Saying that someone can be treated and cured for depression when in truth you are only referencing normal people dealing with a short term bout of depression is misleading and insulting to anyone dealing with a case of life-long depression caused by a major chemical imbalance.

Nearly every single normal, well adjusted, and otherwise healthy adult, will deal with depression at some point in their lives. It's normal. However those cases should not be lumped into the same group as people who have chronic depression or major depressive disorder. 

In my personal opinion, these two types of depression need to be separated and called something different, so that when people talk of curing ""depression"" it's not alluding to a possible ""cure"" for people who have a major chemical imbalance that needs to be treated with long term antidepressants and therapy.

It's like going to your doctor for treatment of a spot of eczema, when you have been asymptomatic of the disease for your entire life. That person has an inflamed area of skin, but the umbrella term for eczema also includes people who deal with a daily struggle of outbreaks, scratching, and bloody skin. It's not the same.

From an NPR article in 2012

&gt;A life marked by persistent, unending hunger is reflected in the bodies of North Korea's people. In April this year, **the North Korean military lowered its minimum height requirement to 4 feet 7 inches, just slightly taller than the average South Korean fourth-grade student.**

&gt;He's a wonderful father (though he was an abusive piece of shit husband)

If he was abusive to you, he will likely become (or already is) abusive to your daughter. A tiger doesn't change his stripes (or is that leopard and spots? I dunno).

Please be very careful about any signs that you see from your daughter that may indicate abuse at her fathers home. It sucks that you were almost ""forced"" into having this child (and I will elaborate on why I put that in quotes) but you have a responsibility to her now as her mother and you need to keep that in the forefront of your mind.

Your mother is a beast of a woman for ""forcing"" you to have your daughter, but you played along with it by following her ultimatum. You were old enough to make the abortion decision for yourself, and no one has rights over your body except you.

Anyone who tries to control your life (or your body) is not interested in what is best **for you.** They want you to do ""whatever"" for them, and not you. 

Your ""mother"" isn't deserving of the title, and you need to keep that in mind during any future interactions with her. I'm glad she isn't a part of your life now, but you need to research how badly she can try to screw you by forcing visitation. Some states/ countries have laws about grandparent visitation, and she may try to push the issue legally.

1292,"This sounds close, but it doesn't mention (that I saw on the Wiki, I did skim it a bit) using them as treatment for allergies, and I specifically remember that from the article/ research paper. 

The interesting bit is that it's being used to treat Asthma, which is theorized to have a direct genetic connection to my skin disease. A very high percentage of people with Atopic Dermatitis also have Asthma, and many years ago my pediatrician said that Asthma can mutate from one generation to the next, and can therefore cause Atopic Dermatitis (no idea how true *that* part is). This is supposedly true if the parent with Asthma has the genetic markers for Eczema but doesn't suffer from it or has a very minor case (spot on for my dad). He has one spot of skin on his nose that he has Eczema flare-ups on. It's about 1.5 square inches of real estate on his entire body that gives him trouble. **I** have Atopic caused issues with about 60% of my body; arms, hands, legs, feet and some of my face.

When I was a kid and initially diagnosed with Eczema (Atopic is a form of it, but it has different rash patterns and allergens than ""vanilla"" Eczema) my pediatrician gave my mother a scanned copy of the description of the disease from a medical book. On that page, it had a footnote about Atopic Dermatitis and how it was different than Eczema. When we went back **I** brought that up to the doctor (at SIX years old) and told him how the symptoms of Eczema didn't match what I was going through, but the part about Atopic Dermatitis was spot on.",2016-07-20 14:21:51+00:00,d5jk94m,5.0,t1_d5jchws,19014.0,fatpeoplestories
1293,"I've just dealt with too much bullshit (like this) being heaped on me while at work and I'm fed up with it. The most recent incident happened *while I've been out on disability due to surgery!* Woman at work who doesn't deserve her job sent me a nasty-gram from her work eMail to one of my home eMails (I had sent an eMail to everyone saying I made it through surgery, and showing off the half cast/ pressure bandage on my arm [since she insinuated that it was impossible to get surgery on a Friday with this Ortho]). 

Well that shit don't fucking fly with me when you misuse company property. I got the number for HR from a coworker I could trust, and immediately called it in. I was asked to forward the offending eMail and I did, gladly. HR then told me that they would investigate, but since I was on disability I wouldn't be getting any calls about this following up.

I ended up calling a week later to clarify something, because it finally hit me what this chick had meant in her eMail. Then radio silence, and I expected that to continue until I returned to work (middle of next month). I got a call about a week ago saying that the issue had been investigated and handled, but that they could not discuss the particulars with me. She also said that &lt;company&gt; expects their employees to be professional at all times when communicating with other employees, on or off property, and that at all times it should never feel like threatening or harassment.

They told me that they wouldn't call, then they did and it's been resolved? I'm hoping I never have to see that cunt ever again.

It took me too long to grow a backbone, and frankly this should have happened over a year ago when she threatened physical violence towards me (that was the point I clarified to HR also). Our manager is a pussy, and didn't report that incident up the chain, he just spoke with both of us separately and the topic never came up again. I'm also hopeful that he got reamed for sweeping that incident under the rug. I didn't pull any punches with HR about the entire incident, from her lunging at me, to how my manager handled it.

I have immunodeficiency issues that are a direct result of allergies or intolerance problems, and it has made me consider attempting to contract the worm (it stops or greatly lessens allergies in people who have them, if not eliminating them entirely).

Shellfish and ginger can send me to the hospital with a closed throat, other allergies cause rashing issues all over the skin on my joints. My skin disease is a special level of Hell that no one deserves, and every single year the number of children diagnosed with it increases.

1323,"(I just wrote a novel here, sorry about the length. TL;DR I had a bad dental experience, and empathy from health care nurses or techs is an amazing -and emotionally moving- thing.)

&gt; I later had to go back with some chocolates for the nurse and thank her, the poor woman had me sobbing on the floor and eventually had to give me some anti anxiety meds to stop me losing it completely haha

She deserved every last piece of it too.

I had a bad experience with a dentist that left me with 4 pegs for front teeth, as well as completely eviscerated gums from a gum lift procedure done at the same time. The dentist didn't take a mold of my teeth before she ground them down to pegs for crowns (BIG PROBLEM!) and the gum lift part of the procedure was so painful that I almost passed out a few times. She drilled away parts of my actual skull. They literally could not give me any more septicaine(sp?) -like novocaine, but stronger- because I was at the maximum allowable ""dose"" (not sure if that's the right term).

Then as I was walking out, with my mouth bleeding like a stuck pig and a crappy temporary covering the pegs so I could ""eat"", she tried to get me to sign a payment agreement to pay her an additional $1200 for the procedure (didn't happen). So I had to switch dentists after the first part of some very serious/ major dental work.

*There were other big red flags too, but I was blinded by the fact that I would finally be getting a smile I could actually display in public without being self conscious.*

My husband called around and found a dentist who was willing to take a look and see if they could pick up where that hack-job dentist had left off. There was no guarantee that they could, but they wanted to help if possible. My husband had explained what had happened to one of the office staff (and to a tech since they would have more knowledge about the stuff done), on the phone and explained how traumatic it was, stressing that it was an absolute last resort to go back to the hack-job dentist that mutilated my mouth.

While I was waiting to be seen, I was in a waiting room chair, with tears running down my face, crying very silently. I was trying to hide my distress and I didn't want to disturb anyone or distress other patients (I can't remember if there even were any other people there TBH).

One of the techs came out from the back on her way to lunch (purse and car keys in hand), and she saw me sitting there trying to hide my tears so she stopped by me. 

Her: ""Are you the one whose husband called us? The one who had the really bad experience?""

Me: ""Yes..."" (lots of sniffling and wiping tears away)

Her: ""Oh honey! I'm so very sorry!"" 

Then she pulled me up into a standing position to give me one of the best hugs I have ever had in my life, and let me cry on her shoulder for a few minutes while she patted/ ran her hands up and down my back.

They were able to fix me and I didn't have to complete the procedure with the nutjob. It took 6 months to fix it, and almost a year for me to get all of the feeling back in part of my upper lip and nose.

*(Edit: I actually have a difficult time going to the dentist now because of that hack-job. We did report her to the state licensing board as well.)*

*(Edit 2: The pictures. May as well, in for a penny and all, since I already wrote a friggin book. There was actually a big chip in one of my front teeth after this picture was taken. I could fit one of those straw-like coffee stirrers between my front teeth, but I have no pictures of that. Understandably I think. [Before](http://imgur.com/RzefK) and [after](http://imgur.com/igt30iy). My teeth are still low in my smile, but this is a very candid photo where I'm laughing/ smiling and not being self-conscious about it. I just wish I'd had them fixed before the wedding, instead of years later.)*",2016-07-18 21:26:11+00:00,d5hblq6,5.0,t1_d5h5djb,8424.0,raisedbynarcissists

You give people too much credit (in my experience). Too many Americans think that foreigners and their difficulties with grasping the language can be improved by speaking louder/ yelling at them. I lived over in the Netherlands for a year and when my fathers-coworkers-wife went out shopping with us, she would talk louder and adopt a crappy Scandinavian/ Swiss accent thinking it would help native Dutch speakers (who understand English *very* well mind you) understand her *English.*

1325,"&gt; I end up sounding condescending instead of gracious

No you don't, you are using it correctly. It's often used as a form of ""apology"" for interrupting conversations or for making someone move out of your way. You are acknowledging that you are inconveniencing/ interrupting them and being polite about it. Not being polite would be saying, ""Hey you! Can you (insert blah-blah-blah)?""

You would also be correct in excusing yourself when coughing loudly, burping or farting in the presence of others (or you should be anyway), it's a pre-emptive, or post-nuisance form of conversational apology.

You can even use it when trying to get the attention of a stranger in public, ""Excuse me, I just wanted to let you know that I really like your shoes/ clothes/ hair/ tattoo"" (etc.)

Edit: ""Excuuuuuuuuse me!"" (when said like that) can be very abrasive, but I don't think that was the tone you were  using with them.",2016-07-18 20:53:56+00:00,d5ha7e9,3.0,t1_d5gzzmv,13747.0,NoStupidQuestions

My parents, being glass-artisans made the centerpieces for the tables, and I was so hurt when I saw guests packing them up to take home (and one of the disposable cameras was never returned, it was meant for guests to take pictures and give back to us)!

I knew how hard they had worked on them, and these entitled guests just decided that they were up for grabs! Once one or two tables did it, the room turned into a minor mayhem of centerpiece stealing. I can't even remember what they looked like.

As for the disposable cameras, if you hear about someone wanting to do this, tell them to put the money towards something else. I got so many blurry pictures taken by 2 of the 3 kids at the wedding that it just wasn't worth it. I ended up seeing the inside of his mommy's dress too, when one of them took the camera and shoved it down into the front of his mother's dress, snapping pictures the whole way (shudder).

An example of a name difference using the same vocal sound, but not actually my name.

That first syllable ends with either an ""**Ann**"" sound (like the name), or with an ""**on**"" sound (as in on/ off, the first part of the word awning, or the last part of the word dawn, ""awn"").

Now what happens to me the most is people skim the name (or misunderstand the pronunciation difference) and say/ write the wrong version back when trying to get my attention, put something under my name, find my account, etc.

It's gotten to the point now where if I tell someone my name, the very next thing I do is spell it out for them.

1414,"Relevant Story     
Some people use this for other reasons too. For a few weeks I had random strangers tagging me in posts and pictures, pretty sure I ended up with them as friends because, ""meh, why not?"" Well, before I changed my FB name there was a duplicate of my first-last name combo. 

Same first name (***very, very*** rare -I've only met 4 people with it spelled like mine ***ever***) and last name (semi-common in the area that I live in*). It makes finding cruddy/ touristy/ personalized first name stuff a disappointment 9,999/10,000.

I was naivete about FB at that time and I thought it was just the thing you did on social media (adding randoms as friends, not the tagging). I then posted one day talking about my marriage and husband, probably something gushy, and one of these chicks messages me out of the blue saying, ""WTF??!?! When did you get married??? and WHY WASN'T I INVITED??!?!?! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?!??!"" She went off the rails.

I promptly told her that I had been married for some time, and that she must be mistaking me for someone else, and I dived into research mode. I was freaked out for a few moments thinking that someone had stolen my identity because I was coming up with a first name/ last name match in the state north of me, but it turns out that when I went from ""uncommon Sci-Fi famous maiden-name"" to ""semi-common married surname"" I now actually had a name (&amp; FB username), that was a match to another human being (first and last only, not middle). My name has always been so unique (in my personal experience) that I didn't consider my marriage could actually change that.

I ended up changing my username on FB for two reasons, 1) her, 2) to hide from potential employers (I had been unemployed awhile and was in a drought for interviews). That is also when I locked down my profile as tight as I could get it. I unfriended every person from &lt;state&gt; that had added me in error, and made my profile so tight that you basically could not find me, and I had to add you as a friend first. The interview drought was lifted after I did that as well.

So there's my long story as to why some people lock their shit down **hard** even if you don't have emotionally tumultuous relationships.

*A restaurant, a notable local preacher, and car dealership within a 40 mile radius are run by (or have) &lt;same-surname&gt; all of which are completely unrelated to my husbands family. Though we keep threatening to go to that car dealership and ask for our BMW (not their actual brand).

I'll edit the post momentarily with it.

Edit: here it is.    
&gt;So my husband wakes up, I get brought in to see him and the release is going as planned, punctuated by a long reverberating fart every few minutes. It's essential that you fart before they let you go home.

&gt;Nurse tells us to go spend the rest of the day at home, and to order in if he can't cook (I basically don't cook, because I have sliced myself open twice on butterknives while doing dishes).

&gt;My husband is a big guy, he wanted food, and he wanted it ASAP. So we stopped at Dave and Busters on the way home, (it was the closest thing).

&gt;He was still farting quite a lot, but held it reasonably well while at the table.

&gt;After we ordered food, he started not feeling well. He went to the men's room, just after another gentleman.

&gt;Dave and Busters restrooms are tile from floor to ceiling (ceiling is also tiled). A completely tile room is nothing but an echo chamber. So combine my husband's very loud, very long, ""BRAAAAAAAAAT"" farts with their restroom acoustics, and it resulted in the other guy running out of the restroom with a look of sheer horror on his face (and looking over his shoulder to make sure he wasn't being followed by some kind of monster).

1581,"""Coffee Shopes"" are all over, it will not be difficult to find some place to purchase/ smoke weed. However, it's best if you do not smoke it outside of the coffee shop (unless you can score a good secluded area). Technically speaking smoking weed outside of the coffee shops is illegal, and you do not want to have to deal with that while you're on vacation. I have no idea if edibles are available, they were not at the coffee shop I went to. 

(I have never seen a bigger bag of weed in my entire life. Think one of those really big Ziplock bags -1 gallon- STUFFED FULL with weed.)

You will probably smell it from other people in the streets of Amsterdam, but again, you don't need to get a ticket or a fine.

I lived there 16 years ago, so I'm sure a lot has changed. I only ever went to one coffee shop while I was there (I know, I R dumb. I was living with my parents though) and the weed was extremely strong.... It was so strong that I was ***STILL*** high as a kite after taking a nap/ passing the hell out.

**Please** do not forget to visit the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam if you have even the slightest interest in it. I lived in the Netherlands for a year and I went to Amsterdam at least 8 times, and we never went to the friggin [Anne Frank House.](http://www.annefrank.org/en/Museum/Practical-information/Online-ticket-sales/) Not visiting there is one of the biggest regrets of my life.

Amsterdam Centraal Station is actually a marvel in it's own right, you will likely go there from the Airport via train (train travel is very cheap, efficient and easy to use). It is the best way to get around if you're travelling from city to city.

Obviously you may not enjoy the same things that I do, but I hope I provided you with some ideas. If you are able, I would highly recommend day-tripping to Rotterdam or even to Antwerp or Brussels in Belgium. Alternatively you can take the [bullet train](http://www.raileurope.com/european-trains/thalys/how-to-book.html) to Paris (the bullet train makes the trip about 3 hours if I remember right). It goes ***really, really, REALLY fast!*** The train is an experience in it's own right.

The Dutch people are very kind and helpful people (for the most part). Anyone under ~40 should be relatively fluent in English, so you won't have too much trouble there.

If you plan in spending awhile there you should visit the farmers market and just be blown away by the prices you'll see.

Lastly, if you see a street vendor/ cart for ""Stroop Waffels"" GET ONE! It's... just insane.

I told her that I haven't wanted children since I was a teenager, and that if I ever went completely insane and decided to have a child in my life that I would adopt, as there are already kids out there who need a family. I also explained that I have a skin disease (that I would NEVER wish on another person, especially one that I am supposed to love) and the chances were high that I would pass it along to my kids.

I also detailed that my (then) fiancee was getting a vasectomy in a few months, just to be doubly sure that we could never conceive. Pretty sure I also said that I will terminate any pregnancy, and told her that I'd already had an abortion at that point.

&gt;**""Panting after exercise can be normal, it is a means by which a cat lowers it's body temperature,** this is known as thermoregulation.""

Another source [here.](http://www.catchannel.com/experts/arnold_plotnick/why-is-my-cat-panting.aspx)

&gt;""Panting is usually just a sign of overheating or excitement, **whether from playing too hard**, or from stress...""

Jackson Galaxy (cat behaviorist known for his show in Animal Planet called ""My Cat From Hell"") often says that if you have a very active kitty and you play with them until they are worn out that sometimes they will be panting. He advises that owners should play with cats to the point of heavy breathing or panting to wear out any excessive energy in a positive way so they they will not be aggressive towards other cats (or humans).

I understand that you were trying to help, **but this is perfectly normal behavior and it is not something to be worried about.** If the panting can be explained by playing or activity, it's fine.

The town was actually still segregated (and I'm only 37, so it was well after things like that should not have existed), and it was quite a culture shock to all of us.

Whenever my mother would go anywhere on her motorcycle, asshole men would ask her who drove it there (because she obviously couldn't, being a woman and all). One time on the highway, some rednecks started messing with her going down the road. They swerved into her lane, and eventually threw a giant half full slushie at her chest (and it did hit her).

It really upset her, because riding a motorcycle is something that my mom really enjoyed, she said that it was the closest thing to flying. Soon after that she sold the motorcycle, because she was scared of anything worse happening (especially since I would ride with her, and I was 10 or 11).

So I had kinda determined that we should get a tripod kitty if possible.

I never discussed it with my husband, and he was the one who saw her at the humane society (and fell in love) first. I wasn't quite ready for another cat just then (we had to euthanize my cat one month previously, cancer) but he talked me into it.

It turns out that she is more special needs than we thought, because she was abused by humans, but we didn't really understand that until later. In the end I'm glad we took her in, because I don't think she would have thrived with another family.

1670,"&gt;You say you have performed over 5,000 reconstructions. If you performed one reconstruction per for, for 16 years, that would be 5,475 surgeries, so that is possible. However, that does not account for weekends, holidays, conferences, vacations, or any of that. 

&gt;Now factor in patient consults pre- and post-surgery consults, continuing education courses, conferences, staff meetings, your own time preparing or planning for complicated procedures. 

&gt;You must be at least doubling and tripling up on having multiple procedures per day. Just how are you cramming all of that in without compromising patient safety? 

&gt;,your numbers are off, or I can't see how you are a safe doctor. 

Surgery can be really fast depending on what is being done. He's not going to perform just one surgery a day. An orthopedic surgeon can do upwards of 4-5 per day (my elbow surgery a week and a half ago was quoted to me as 30 minutes from incision to stitches). They had the OR booked for 60 minutes for me.

Once the patient leaves the OR, or before they are wheeled in, the patient is cared for by the nursing staff. If he did procedures all matching mine the day of my surgery, he could have done 6-7 surgeries in one day. 

My doctor has two days he does surgery on, Tuesday and Friday. On the low end, that is twelve surgeries in a week.",2016-06-08 06:12:44+00:00,d40jzqh,2.0,t1_d40j9dy,1596.0,IAmA

1672,"&gt;I'm 20 and male. Aren't we supposed to grow out of this?

This is the worst lie my pediatrician ever told my parents. I looked forward to those years all the time growing up.

My parents felt helpless, because it seemed like nothing ever worked. 

I had a really bad breakout once that almost hospitalized me. I was in bed for weeks, because whenever I moved around the scabs would crack and bleed, or leak puss. That breakout was because I caught impetego(sp?), and it spread all over my body to every part of my skin that I could reach or touch (except for my face and parts of my back). I was constantly wrapped up in handkerchiefs of my dad's, we were using them as reusable bandages (they were washed and sanitized for every use).

So I looked forward to 12, and nothing happened. Then he said, ""maybe when she's 15-16."" Once again, nothing happened when I reached the magic number.

The last time he said, ""maybe between 18-20."" Which was good for him, because I'd be seeing a different doctor by then if he was wrong for a third time.

I'm 37, and no longer waiting for my body to get rid of it. I've come to terms with having this for the rest of my life.

Doctors really need to stop saying that kids will grow out of it. The percentage that do is falling every year. It's no longer the 50-75% chance that my family and I were quoted when I was 5-6.

In my own experience, there have been multiple people say that ""just doing this one thing"" will make it all go away. Most of the products these friends of friends are spouting off about are nothing more than snake oil, voodoo-hoodoo crystals or some sort of homeopathic remedy, none of which works.

We ***all*** deal with that kind of unsolicited advice too often. Oh sure that will work, NOT! And some of us have tried a great deal of these remedies out of desperation.

Then, on top of that, you provide a link to a prior post of yours, for how certain things have helped you, **completely unsolicited.**

Eczema is a skin **disease.**

Let me say that again.

***There is NO cure.***

Eczema is most commonly triggered by foods, but fragrances, artificial ingredients, and even just *stress* can cause a flareup. Being 100% breakout free is only a period of remission, not a cure.

If you can manage it by restricting certain things, more power to you, but we're all different people and what works for you will not work for everyone.

#Duty Free	$3.80

So with Duty Free pricing being a minimum savings of 30-40% it's really understandable why it's worth it to buy as much as you can get away with Duty Free. Even if you exceed your limit, the tax that customs would collect based on value, would be based on the Duty Free pricing, and not the state you live in. It's still a pretty significant savings if you're from some place like Illinois ($11.50) or New York ($12.85) the Duty Free fees associated with exceeding your ""allowable limit"" are still less than buying them locally.

I just had elbow **surgery** because of a piece of fencing that I was putting back up (it's not connected to the rest of the fence and blows over in a stiff breeze).

I did a twist and over-extend/ exert motion which ripped a tendon and some muscle attached to it. This happened in December, and I just had surgery on it 8 days ago.

The tendon wasn't repairable, so it was removed entirely, and the muscle attached to it (that was torn down the center) was reachored to a different tendon in my elbow.

The injury was technically called ""tennis elbow"" but it happened in one day, instead of by repeated ""twist and extend"" movement which is generally how tennis elbow injuries happen in most people.

1724,"Did you sign a document stating you assumed responsibility for fees not covered by your insurance (as /u/swalsh411 mentioned)?

If you did not sign a paper with that kind of statement, you do not owe them anything.

The below is my story of a ***very, very bad*** dentist. 

--------------------------------------------------------

I went through something similar with a dentist locally, except she lied to me about pricing costs for a proceedure. I asked if a gum-lift could be included with some repairs (I needed it, you couldn't see teeth when I smiled, only gums), and the Dentist said, ""yes."" When I asked what the fee was, she said it was included with the crown work I was getting. 

SCORE!!!! Or so I thought.

She was terrible, and didn't take a mold of my teeth before drilling them out, treated me like a car in a garage rather than a patient with needs, etc. 

As I'm ~~walking~~ stumbling out, she pulls out a piece of paper for me to sign, agreeing to the work that had just been completed, and an additional $1200 price tag since that procedure was not covered by insurance.....

My husband told her to get stuffed in multiple ways as she tried to coerce me into signing the paper. I had to find another dentist to finish the repairs in my mouth (I was honestly traumatized by her), and there was every chance that she had damaged my mouth beyond repair, as she had ground into bone (IE my skull) while hacking away at my face for the gumlift. I walked out of that office with my mouth bleeding everywhere, and four ""pegs"" for front teeth, she had ground them down to posts (again, she took ***NO*** mold of my teeth prior to grinding them away, this is a massive red flag).

My husband called another place and they wanted to look before they could firmly say that they could pick up where this other person had left off, but they were pretty confident. 

My husband sent me there on my lunch break from work.... when I was waiting to be examined to see if it was even *possible* for them to pick up where that hack-job dentist left off, one of the techs came out into the waiting area and asked me if I was the one who had a bad experience and needed their help.

I said yes, and got watery-eyed. She grabbed me into a hug and... well it was one of the most moving experiences of my life. I broke down and cried on her shoulder and she gave me one of the best hugs I've ever had.

Someone who pretends infirmity just boggles me. I don't get it. Right now I'm physically dependent on my husband, because I had surgery Friday. My dominant arm is immobilized at the elbow, and my arm is effectively like it's in a cast. There are a lot of mundane things that I can't do right now and it's extremely frustrating.

To just full-on embrace an ""infirmity"" and expect to be waited on hand and foot is just..... appalling to me. I am ashamed that I can't open a can of soda, or one of my prescription bottles, not embracing it. I'm having a hard time taking care of myself (mostly in the bathroom, but there are a ton of other things too) and I started practicing with my left hand weeks ago.

To start using a flipping ***bedpan*** ""just because"" is an astronomical level of entitlement, (and bullshit N-satisfaction from forcing other people to wash her ass/ handle her bio-waste). It's completely disturbing and disgusting. Just.... Ew.

Quote from the article:     
&gt;By Arnold Plotnick, DVM | Posted: December 18, 2009

&gt;Labored breathing can be a sign of cardiac or pulmonary disease, but panting is different. **Panting is usually just a sign of overheating or excitement,** whether from **playing too hard,** or from stress and excitement (for example, a veterinary visit, like you said.)",2016-06-01 02:23:09+00:00,d3r8iqv,2.0,t1_d3r33e7,8808.0,cats
1742,"No. It can also mean that they are tired from all of the playtime.

I have two cats who regularly pant when they are worn out from playing. You have some very bad information. Playtime panting is something often brought up by Jackson Galaxy on My Cat From Hell when he talks about wearing out cats with too much energy.

Our cat only vet has also assured us that this is completely normal behavior and absolutely nothing to worry about.

Besides, does that even *look* like an upset cat? Eyes are open (not completely squinty), ears are forward (not flat to the head), and she's sitting up (not crouched down in fight/ defense mode).",2016-06-01 02:10:06+00:00,d3r81iy,2.0,t1_d3r33e7,8025.0,cats

We were at the Atlanta Aquarium (let me stress now, that their aquarium is absolutely amazing) and I was not only in a wheelchair, but I had a massive immobilization brace on from mid-thigh to mid-calf. Due to the brace, the injured leg was put up straight to rest on the leg support thingy (I got really technical with that term there huh?).

We were at the big tank, where it's a good 40feet wide or more, watching the underwater zoo. Then this child who was on my right side, wanted to get to my left side. So how did he decide to do this? Well if you guessed that he went around me, you'd be wrong.

This child (around 8, and old enough that he should have known, or been taught, better) figured that he was just going to go **over** my outstretched leg. Just as he gets into a straddle position, this crotch goblin put his hands on my knee **and pushed down on my kneecap** to keep his balance.

I screamed in pain. But of course now, he's stuck straddling my leg, has nowhere to put his hands for support, and he would have been dead if looks could kill.

His dad was close by, he seemed horrified, but did nothing to help his child untangle himself from this situation. My husband had to grab the kid and lift him out of that spot.

The family promptly disappeared from our vicinity. I damn near passed out in pain. Fucker.",2016-05-23 02:15:14+00:00,d3fw10i,1.0,t3_4kitjw,41416.0,fatpeoplestories

1887,"&gt; Think about the Last book you read or game you played that you didn't like. People put time and effort into those as well. Did you tell people you didn't like it when it came up in conversation?

When I talk to my friends about a game, book, or &lt;insert item&gt; I don't like or don't care for, I *always* say what they could have done better. I like to provide reasons for why something isn't to my liking, even if that is me admitting that I just couldn't get into it. Most people I do this with appreciate it, as they may have similar tastes and take that into consideration before trying it themselves. Giving reasons or constructive criticism (yes even if I'm not talking directly to the author or game designer) means that I don't come off as a negative nancy who just hates everything.

If I do say that I just ""can't get into &lt;whatever&gt;"" or ""&lt;whatever&gt; doesn't interest me,"" it's not worded in a way that is going to discourage other people from trying it and I accept that the fault is with me, not with the product itself.

I just think that when it comes to criticizing an author here, you should take into account that other authors will read your comments. It's not a matter of ""if"" but rather ""when"" and seeing a negative nancy comment about another author and calling their stories a pile of crap, it could absolutely deter people from contributing. Why would anyone want to contribute something if it just opens them up to backhanded comments and non-constructive criticism? If potential authors see examples of negative comments that are essentially behind another authors back, it could absolutely deter people from sharing their stories.

&gt;It has also occurred to me that this might be the result of some kind of underlying immunocompromising malignancy. Two of the derms I’ve seen brought up the notion that it could be HIV, which I immediately got tested for, twice, months apart, and both returned negative. I don’t have diabetes (I would know if I did, right?). Perhaps I should schedule a general physician visit and get screened for multiple forms of cancer.

You have to know what you are allergic to, and sometimes it's just a matter of trial and error. an Immunosuppressant is a horrible idea, because our immune system is *already compromised.* Compromising it more is not a good idea.

Next, try swapping all of your lotions to one that you are absolutely 100% certain you don't react to. Cetaphil saved my life when I was younger. I was around 18 when I first heard of it and I seem to recall it had just come off of the prescription only list of things.

When I got into genealogy, she said that dad's side of the family tree print out was my ""real family,"" and the only one I should worry about, like I wasn't related to my mom or gestated by her. 

Another time, she called me an ungrateful brat in public for getting my first migraine and feeling sick at 12 years old.

I'm not saying that they don't, but again you're missing the goddamned point and making up an argument out of thin air. What I'm saying is to show me one law, **that applies in the home only as related to the protection of children from a harmful/ detrimental product.** You can't. Every law for their protection (or anyones protection) also applies at home (abuse, etc). Cigarettes fall under blue laws, which are regulated state by state, county by county, or even city by city. Unless you are talking about a new law at the FEDERAL LEVEL regarding exposure to second hand smoke, nothing is going to happen.

There will never be a law about second hand smoke exposure in the home. You think the big cigarette companies are going to sit idly by while legislation that would strongly limit their customer base is passed? Think again.",2016-05-04 21:06:01+00:00,d2syl2m,13.0,t1_d2sv4nn,4351.0,todayilearned

1941,"&gt; Yes, but the government can make a law saying you can't punch another person in the privacy of your own home, you can't feed another person arsenic in the privacy of your own home, you can't steal your friend's phone and hit it with a hammer in the privacy of your own home, etc. The list can go on.

Again show me an example of a law that is just concerning something within the privacy of your own home that isn't a law that exists outside of the home. No matter where you are if you punch someone it's assault. I asked this question before and framed it as such, did you not understand it?

&gt;And I'm not sure why you're bringing up alcohol as your example. Children absolutely can be removed from a home with an alcoholic parent. 

And kids have died from an alcoholic parent who goes into a rage and kills their kid, yet **it's not illegal to drink in your home when kids are present.**

&gt;So you're totally cool with the idea of unknowingly going into some guy's house and having him lock you in Uncle Touchy's Naked Puzzle Basement? Of course you're not.

You are purposefully misunderstanding the point I was making and creating a strawman argument.

&gt;Smoking in a home with a child is demonstrably, unquestionably harmful to that child and there's absolutely no means of protection for him/her.

This will never be regulated, so it's not even worth bringing up. You can't make a law disallowing people to drink/ have sex/ walk around naked/ watch pornography/ etc. in the privacy of their own home. People will fight to the death over that. 

Before you say none of those causes cancer, that's true, but many people get violent or abusive towards their children when they're drunk. Kids have died from alcohol induced rages.

We're ***ALL*** freaks (our friendship formed because I became part of the ""Saturday crowd"" who played D&amp;D at a friends house, but the friendship extended beyond that) I just regret that he never felt comfortable sharing that part of who he was.

1999,"We had this happen in our guild. The person who did this was also ""mute"" so that they wouldn't have to talk in Vent. Our guild was full of people who are extremely friendly and every year if you can afford it, there is a guild vacation together. Our friend said ""she"" was going to go, but backed out at the last minute from what ""she"" said was ""embarrassment over being mute and unable to talk to everyone.""

Not only did this person say that hey were a girl, they said that they were two girls, sisters (or a brother and sister, I can't access the forum where the breakdown is now and it was about five years back). Who were both mute. They couldn't play at the same time because there was ""only one computer in the house.""

Our group is *very* close, moreso than most guilds I have come across. We're all Facebook friends, etc. 

We found out about everything when they disappeared for a week, I can't remember what was the exact way it was discovered, but this person had been arrested for having CP.

They tried to play it off, but something set off the wife of our GuildLeader and she started Googling. She found the arrest record tied to ""her"" address and put everything together. ""She"" was confronted, and tried to lie to cover it, but the truth was out there for anyone to see. This man lived alone, impersonated two full personalities and always made excuses at the last minute for not being able to talk to anyone (even for TTY phone calls). One of the personalities was very close to the wife of the GuildLeader, and they referred to each other as sisters.

It was a very catastrophic event in our guild, and caused many people to lose faith in their other friends in the Guild. Now we are extremely spread out across MMO's and pretty much don't play together anymore.

Additionally, lashing out at humans may have been her way of either expressing her pain, or to try and bring attention to it.

When we first adopted Chewie he was a biter well suited for the show My Cat From Hell. The first day home, he bit my husband on the face and drew blood. The second day home he did the same thing to my arm. He was 4 months old, and the thought that he could have been adopted by people who would have put him down for that pisses me off. 

If you take the time to do your research, and work with the animal, the behavior can be trained out, or lowered significantly. He could have just been sick.

2059,"First, let me explain that it took a significant amount of time. It's not an easy fix. 

You need to stop all hand play if you haven't already. Next, there are multiple ways that work, and you may need to combine methods to achieve results.

Never pull your hand away. *That is acting like prey.*

Loud shrieking when bit. *This relays to them that you are in pain.*

Blowing on their face/hissing. *Similar to a hiss from another cat.*

Assert dominance. *Staring contests or pinning them down and forcing the staring contest after a bite teaches them that you are Alpha in the house.*

Bite him back. *No, I'm not kidding. Yes, you will get a mouthful of fur.*

No reaction to the bite. *This was one of our last resorts. He was already getting better about it, so we moved from shrieking to not reacting.*

Time out. *Shut him in a room by himself. It gives cats who are overstimulated time to cool off.*

Put something over his head, or force him to bite a toy instead of you. 

Always reward non-biting behavior.

2121,"Very recently, I got the idea in my head to take care of two things at once in the ladies room. My back ached, and I had to pee. 

Now, among my treatments for my back, I use Tiger Balm vanishing scent lotion. The people at work can't stand the full grade stuff so I'm not allowed to use it. The full grade stuff will take varnish off of a wood table if the fumes aren't allowed to dissipate.

So as I'm sitting, doing my thing, I apply a generous dollop of cream to my neck and shoulder area.

I then wad up my TP and take care of the other reason I was in the bathroom.

I didn't wash my hands because a single stall doesn't have a sink.

Anyone see where this is going?

Residue from the cream made it onto the TP. Then I used the TP for its intended purpose. 

I can only thank my sensitive coworkers for not letting me use full strength Tiger Balm at work. It's the only reason I didn't have to run home early. Five minutes of discomfort, and an hour of feeling minty fresh.

Never apply Tiger Balm in the same trip to the bathroom that you use to relieve yourself. ",2016-04-14 01:44:56+00:00,d220q84,2.0,t1_d21ziy0,1688.0,fatpeoplestories

2124,"&gt;Seriously, watch the carnage at the next pink-themed 5k.

When we were in Atlanta a few months back, we had no idea that there was a pink-themed marathon. 

On our last day in town we took the metro to get to the attractions in town that were last on our list and the subway car was half full of people wearing pink wings, tutus, boas, etc.

We stepped out to the street level at our stop and the street was filled with people participating in some kind of breast cancer awareness run/ walk/  waddle.

The people on the train **rode to the end of the event.** They were more interested in *looking* like they did it, and taking selfies to prove it, than they were in actually accomplishing something.

None of these pink brigaders were under 200lbs.

He was in a ""low"" when you can get very pissy due to low blood sugar.

He was also routinely skipping breakfast and taking his metformin in the mornings on other days. This would result in the meds pushing his blood sugar really low by 11AM and he would become very forgetful and cranky. So forgetful that he would carry on an entire conversation and not remember it 5mins later.

You can use a site called [My Body Gallery](http://www.mybodygallery.com/) to plug in estimates and you will be given pictures for a visualization. It's meant for women, but you can use it as a guide. If he's fat enough, he has ~~boobs~~ moobs anyway.

You mentioned that the cameras had been destroyed by Edlard on the first night, with a mop or broom handle. That video is evidence of a crime being committed and you have proof in the recording.

Mid-week party, arranged last minute with a buttload of guests? Easy. It's a small town, and most people do not have plans mid-week. Even if they did, cancelling and rescheduling because some good friends got engaged is not impossible. If they also happen to throw good parties (historically), people would be more likely to attend and reschedule other things.

The rollergirls focusing on Edlard. Simple, they were brought in specifically for this purpose. It's relatively easy to figure that out and I believe it was mentioned or alluded to in the post. Also, they are used to acting as a team against another team in the rink. Everyone working in sync to foil Edlard and Fatness Neverclean at every turn? Not a problem.

Having dummy/ expired food to tempt Edlard with? Even if you only have two days to plan, and you know a bakery (like they do) not hard at all. I think also one or two were probably brought by friends(?). A simple phone call or two, to people you know are coming takes care of it (the rollergirls are the likely culprits, since they knew the backstory, and knew what dummy food to steer him to).

Other friends and family not jumping in? [Bystander effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect?wprov=sfla1) easily explains *most* guests. To family, they could have been informed that Edlard has mental issues and it's best to ignore him. Giving him attention obviously fuels his actions.

Food for 80-100 people in two days? They are not broke. $900 a month for a bedroom and bathroom only, shared common spaces? I have lived in 2 and 3 bedroom apartments that were cheaper. These guys are not hurting for money. They are also on friendly terms with a baker, I'm sure that she could whip up some good shit with only two days notice for people she likes. Other food items are easily ordered in that timeframe. 

Sweetie being very sick, but they have all of these exotic pets. Even people who are allergic to animals, can own animals. Allergy medicine is a wonderful thing.

I tried to step down on the instant release painkiller, and no one carried that dosage, so I had to go back to a higher dose to ensure I could get my medicine on time. 

Before I found my current pharmacy, I would sometimes drive to 5-10 different pharmacies before I would find one that had my meds in stock (and no, I was **not** filling it too early).

I finally tried a pharmacy that was my pharmacy when we lived in our previous address. It's out of my way, but it got me into a different area of town and I have only had one out of stock issue since.

I really hate how C2 meds are so demonized. I know that many people have had issues with them, but it does create an issue for people who are honest patients with a true need for the medicine. The chain pharmacies are creating a stigma around C2 med, even if they are not pain pills, and very recently there was a news story about a woman who had to go to 8 different pharmacies before she could find one with her non-narcotic C2 prescription. During the interview she talked about the dirty looks she would get from pharmacy technicians, and it was just a medicine she needed to survive, not even an opiate!

My new pharmacist just recently realized that he was filling 2 different C2 meds for me, and he's been giving me dirty looks ever since. He used to smile and laugh with me, now he just treats me like scum on his shoe. That conversation where I told him that yes, I knew I was on two different drugs, and yes, I've been getting them filled for 2 years was not fun....",2016-04-04 21:57:32+00:00,d1pwaze,5.0,t1_d1pes78,23496.0,TalesFromThePharmacy

&gt;The “death block” housed the criminals in the camp. These barracks held the “court rooms” where the prisoner was tortured into confession, unfairly tried, and sentenced to death. 

So there were ""mock"" trials that gave false truth to the happenings within the camp. Anyone not working at the camps were told about these as justification for the deaths people might have heard about via word of mouth.

2335,"I tried to help you. It's not my fault that you got defensive about me providing a foolproof way to be notified of new stories by OP, which you still don't seem to understand.

So I'm going to explain it very carefully in a last ditch effort *to help you.* Your responses indicate that you are still not grasping a simple set of instructions which do not require the use of Chrome, or your Reddit password to implement (because you are already logged in).

There is a comment in any thread from repeat submitters that gives you a simple way to be notified of new stories from the OP, and as a bonus, it gives links to all of their previous stories from that specific author. The bot has a name (Type_II_bot if I recall correctly).

Every set of words that appear blue (or whatever color your unread links appear to be according to your settings) are links you can click on. One of those word groups is ""click here."" 

It will open a new screen or window, in whatever viewing platform you use, which looks similar to a new eMail or message draft. When this appears, click or push the send or arrow icon to communicate your request to the bot.

Once sent, you will receive a notification when that person submits a new story to FPS. Those messages/ notifications appear in the same place that you receive comment replies (just like this one).

This functionality is universal because it's **internal to Reddit**. It doesn't require Chrome, and since you are logged in already on your phone (or whatever), you do not have to attempt to remember your password, nor do you need to reset it (though it's a good idea since you stated that you could not remember what it was). 

Once again, since you seem incredibly new and/ or unsure of how to navigate through Reddit, I attempted to help by advising you of where to find the location of the link to fix your password problem.

Your request was to get notified when a new story is posted, I told you how to do it. You thought that this method required Chrome, and it doesn't. You mentioned that you didn't recall your password, so I told you how to get that fixed too.

TL;DR - I've done nothing but attempt to help you, and you got offended that I tried to help you. You got pissy and offended by someone trying to help you figure shit out.",2016-03-27 04:28:56+00:00,d1exxcm,8.0,t1_d1eqnrf,13920.0,fatpeoplestories

Our circle of friends sometimes have to confer with each other to figure out what the illiterate friend was trying to say, and sometimes it's not recognizable to anyone. He also has severe dyslexia, which is part of why he can't communicate using the written word.

He was passed through the school system because no one wanted to take the time to really teach him. Teachers gave him a passing grade to get him out of their class. He is someone for whom the public school system failed, and he has every other right and privilege as any other adult. He can buy cigarettes and alcohol, enlist in the military, and he has a full time job.

None of those things says he is stupid. By drawing an arbitrary line in the sand, you start down a very slippery slope of ethics and judging people based on your personal beliefs, rather than an unbiased set of facts. No one person should decide who gets rights and who doesn't, this is why we allow people who you may consider ""stupid"" to vote.

2378,"Your story of your dog is very similar to the one for our [newest kitten](http://imgur.com/a/mOyD2). The rescue we got him from said he was healthy, but our vet found that he had two intestinal bugs, coccidia and giardia(?). Because we thought that the rescue was reputable (we know better now) we didn't think of early exposure to the other cats being an issue. 

$2500 later we know better. At least two of our other 3 cats got sick, one with diarrhea so bad the vet tech said that he was basically just... leaking, and believe me, he was. I felt so personally responsible for exposing my other cats to this crap that my depression level was off the charts. I had to lock that cat in the bathroom for a solid day because he was just leaking.... He couldn't sleep, and was pacing all night (thank god our vet gave him a time release painkiller).

At one point I went into a bedroom (where the kitten was now isolated) and just started slamming my hands on the floor screaming and crying. The kitten crawled up onto my shoulder without using his claws and just sat there for me.

We went through weeks of treating the other cats. One would get better than another would get sick. Grabbing all of the cats in the house and giving doses of the latest medication seriously damaged what fragile progress we had made with our abuse survivor [Trinity](http://imgur.com/a/XM3VR) (named so due to having only 3 legs).

You also have to figure in at *least* $10 per person, per meal (two meals, lunch and dinner, coming to $20 a piece), so add another $80. This doesn't account for things like ice cream snacks, so lets call it an even $400 *before* souvenirs and $20 for parking.

By being negative you are personally representative of why the quality posters leaving this sub.

Actually I would not say this. The N's reasoning for doing this is probably to inconvenience or hurt OP. If you give the Narc this response she may not stop, and it may justify to her that this is somehow appropriate.

In this situation, what I would say is, ""Now that I know what is going on, I can adjust the settings in the shower appropriately. Thank you."" This response (even though it's not true) can cut off her Narc motivation for doing it  and it might make her stop entirely, knowing that this is something OP can change to counteract what she is doing.

It cuts her off at the knees.

This means she may look for something else to do to mess with or hurt OP.

Do you think that if a woman starts saying ""no"" during intercourse, but who also seems to be somewhat enjoying herself, is not allowed to claim that she was raped?

Just like how can a man be raped, yet many don't think that it's actually a thing. People call those men pussies and have created a huge stigma around it... If the man being raped stays hard, he obviously wants it and wasn't actually raped right? (serious sarcasm there if you couldn't tell)

2730,"Just an FYI, to get a line/ paragraph break you have to double-space between paragraphs.

I've broken up the story below (and corrected some small spelling/ grammar issues) for easier reading.

&gt;I posted a little bit ago on the crazy situation that happened to me. The woman is in custody facing numerous Felony counts. Her husband is facing many more counts as well, including attempted murder and some type of felony weapons charge. 

&gt;From what I have heard, their plan was to, in fact, murder me. The Husband wanted to shoot me in the head while I was on stage singing ''Hatikvah.'' He also wanted to shoot my sister, not to kill her but to wound her and make her suffer. Both of them are white supremacists. 

&gt;I haven't been told if the woman is mentally ill, but it seems she is. When the husband was arrested, he was a block or so away from my café. He went without incident. A coworker was ''patrolling'' the area and saw the arrest. The man was heard yelling ''white power'' and how he wanted to kill ''That kike and his tard sister.'' Since all of this [started], I haven't been home. I am staying with my sister at my bosses house. 

&gt;[The] police told me that they do not think I am in any danger at this point, and it seems to appear to be isolated. The children are [now] in state custody. 

&gt;Sorry for all the chaotic ramblings in my last post, I was nervous and terrified. I will never take my safety or my life for granted again. I have become very suspicious around people as of late. The fact I was almost murdered is very chilling. Their plans seem to have been very chaotic and poorly organized in a sense. 

&gt;It seems as if the wife was posting as much crazy stuff on Facebook as possible to distract attention from her husband, so he could do the deed of killing me. I guess the moral of this story, is to never take life for granted. Someone could be out there planning to kill you, as you read this. For me, the fact the Husband planned to shoot me in the head, and then shoot my sister to wound her so she wouldn't die but would suffer, is very disturbing. 

&gt;I had a concert at the Café tonight and performed without incident. It will take some time but I will heal and I won't submit to terror. I have been under the threat of terror before, I have had rockets explode over my head. I wont let them terrorize me here.

2752,"What you can do as an average movie goer is complain to the theater if your movie experience is ruined by a child who is in the theater (even supervised). When this happens more, movie theaters may reanalyze their policies. 

If the R rating says ""children 13 and up may see the movie with parental supervision"" and the movie theater allows a family to bring in a 5 year old, you should absolutely complain to management. There may also be an official entity to escalate the complaint to.

If the rating just says kids can see it with parental supervision, then complain to the management. Tell them that this movie is in no way suitable for young children, and that they should put a stern warning about this at the ticket counter, or have their ticket ripper/ seller say something to the family directly about the movie that they are taking little Johnny to see.

""Did you know that there is full frontal nudity, several sex scenes, gratuitous blood/ gore/ violence, and XXX uses of the F-word in this movie which may not be appropriate for your child?""

They stood outside with my father, who was extremely hurt and beyond pissed. He couldn't even stay at the graveside service through the end of it.

My mother, who is normally **extremely** non-confrontational and abhors physical violence, was so furious that she almost slapped Rhea (who is over a foot taller than mom).

I once took a call from someone in the Earnhardt family whose car broke down on the interstate. You would talk to all types of people, and no two calls were ever the same. I eventually moved on to Dispatch, which was a whole new experience.

Dispatching for AAA Emergency Road Service was very unique, but not soul crushing. It had it's own good and bad moments. One of my drivers almost died one night because the winch cable snapped and hit him. He was lucky it was just a graze because that could have taken his head off. As it was he got knocked out cold, and was found because another driver was in the area and I requested a spot-check since he was nonresponsive.

And I wrote a book... damnit. I actually do miss that place. The employee benefits were amazing, there was a good camaraderie between us (the dispatchers) and the drivers, and working Holidays was double time-and-a-half pay (250%).

2892,"Spaying and neutering helps reduce the chance of cancer in the reproductive areas, can help curb violence/ agression/ dominance behaviors, and save you money in the long run (less destructive behavior, which can be destruction of property/ biting, and the aforementioned cancer possibility, saves on potential vet medical bills, and human medical bills due to attacks.)

Not to be rude about it, but the first article is misleading in it's cited material. The reference number 5 used in the article links to a study for Osteosarcoma in dogs, in relation to increasing height and weight, with a footnote indicating that neutered dogs have an ""observed"" increase. The citation piece did not indicate that neutering was the factor that doubled the chances, just that it was observed to be the case within the dogs who were in the study.

Larger dogs seem to have a higher chance of being neutered to begin with, as big dogs are more destructive and any violent outbursts have larger consequences when compared to a small breed such as a Miniature Poodle or Chihuahua. It's no surprise to me that larger dogs are neutered/ fixed more often for that very reason. 

It's like a study on skin cancer noting that redheads seemed to be more likely to get skin cancer, but the factors that are part of the study are things like sun exposure and sunscreen use. You would observe that redheads are more prone to it, but it's not a factor of the study directly.

Articles that are cited for 6 and 7 (more supposed ""studies"") seem to be missing or linked incorrectly. 

Total disclosure here, I did not read the PLOS article in it's entirety due to the lack of supporting data that is more than ""observed"" or coincidental. The data set used in gathering the information for this article is as low as 15 subjects.... 

&gt;Only diseases with at least 15 cases found using this screening were included in the study.

which is not a large enough sample size to properly associate a spay/neuter with increased chance of illness/ cancer. 

The Golden retriever studies doesn't factor in the [inbreeding increased cancer risk](http://genetics.thetech.org/ask/ask449) associated with the breed.

Also these links are about dogs specifically and do not speak to cats at all.

[The USA Today article cited in the above link.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/07/pet-longevity-states-spay-neuter/2130813/)

Excerpt:     
&gt;Experts say states with the healthiest and longest living pets also have the highest neutering and spaying rates, more pets living inside and fewer regional infectious diseases.

[Banfield article mentioned in USA Today piece.](http://www.banfield.com/Banfield/media/PDF/Downloads/soph/Banfield-State-of-Pet-Health-Report_2013.pdf) This report contains data from 2.2 million dogs and 460,000 cats. There is a specific graph showing that spayed/neutered animals live longer than intact animals. I will admit right now that I believe this may be due to our spay and neuter culture around animals. The majority of household pets are spayed and neutered, and are therefore owned by people who care for them and take them to the vet. Intact animals are often homeless and may have shorter lifespans due to the number of dangers they face outdoors.",2016-01-31 16:26:03+00:00,czinxy5,12.0,t1_czh1e51,145262.0,aww

You are taking words that I stated to you and trying to make the argument work, when it doesn't.

2970,"&gt;These are definitely aimed at kids or at the very least persons with a dislike of alcohol. 

That's where you're wrong though. Flavored booze has its place. Grand Mariner(sp?) is an orange flavored alcohol specifically designed to have a fruit flavor and is in no way marketed towards children. People like what they like, and there is absolutely nothing that says any one alcohol is geared toward a younger audience.

It's illegal to market alcohol to people under 21, or cigarettes to people under 18. This is why alcohol doesn't have cartoon characters on the label (that's just one example).

Posting this now to edit for Wikipedia link [Alcohol Advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_advertising) and quote (below). Bold is mine.

&gt;One area in which the alcohol industry has faced criticism and tightened legislation is in their alleged targeting of young people. Central to this is the development of alcopops – sweet-tasting, brightly coloured drinks with names that may appeal to a younger audience. **However, numerous government and other reports have failed to support that allegation.[1]**

.

&gt;It is difficult to make definite allegations regarding youth exposure to these types of advertisements but it is necessary to find ways in which these allegations may be limited.[2]

My husband and I try things that grab our attention. He likes root beer, so he's been trying the new root beer drinks. He's also more than double the legal drinking age, so the flavor of an ""alcoholic soda"" has nothing to do with who consumes it. If anything is at fault, it would be the multitude of TV adverts for alcohol, but again, no study can conclude that the *packaging* or *flavor* of an alcoholic drink has anything to do with underage drinking.",2016-01-19 17:24:54+00:00,cz43w18,7.0,t1_cz3xpme,10436.0,trees

I sent a very long-winded reply (he knew the story, so it was mostly a ""What the fuck? Why don't you understand?

3063,"I think it boils down to personal insecurity. Some people are practically forced into childbearing by their families. ""You'll feel different when it's yours!"" or other peer pressure type arguments. Those people can be bitter about it, but they hide it, for the good of the child(ren). When those people are confronted with examples of couples that stood up to the peer pressure and said, ""Oh hell no!"" they feel inferior, and possibly even feel like a failure for not standing up for what they really wanted out of life.

Then, those people express their feelings by lashing out at the person or couple that stood firm on their reproductive choice.

Some people just have no idea why CF is even a movement at all. They feel that it's unnatural to not have children, and again, they lash out at what they don't understand. To them, their children are the reason for their existence, all of their goals in life were put on hold or sacrificed at the altar of the OBGYNs stirrups. 

Sorry, I bounced off track there, but it's something that I am passionate about. People who do not want kids should never be forced into childbearing. Those who are often hold a grudge against their own child(ren) or completely give up a sense of self, and let their life become nothing more than a megaphone for the accomplishments of their offspring.

The mens shirts were missing buttons, the pants had seam issues and holes in the pockets. The owner was a sexist snob who had a problem renting a tux to a woman (for a grooms*woman* in the wedding party). 

My deposit wasn't returned because they claimed there was damage that needed to be repaired. None of the tuxes were damaged in any way, they were returned in the same shitty condition they were rented out to us in.

All of the locations in Jacksonville are owned by the same douchebag and I recommend avoiding that company and renting/ buying formal wear at any other business, even if it does cost more.

I've done it for people at my grocery store pharmacy, servers at restaurants, phone CSR... etc. Everyone likes getting compliments, and sometimes the company rewards them for it too.

Storytime edit!    
One time I had to drive to an alternative grocery store pharmacy since my usual one didn't have the medicine I needed for my cat. They called the other and transferred the order for ""Chewbacca &lt;surname&gt;"" and by the time I got there it was almost done. It had been a heartbreaking day, and once I let her know what I was picking up she asked if I was aware of the price of the medicine, and that it wouldn't be on my insurance. I answered her and said something about doing anything for my cats, and she told me it would just be another minute or two. The prescription was ready, but she went looking for a discount she could apply towards the cost and found one that gave me $24 off the price (about 30% off) and when she rang me up I noticed the difference and started to ask about it. She said she gave me the employee discount and I started crying over it. At the time my husband was unemployed and we were barely making ends meet, so this $80 prescription was coming out of our food budget. It meant the world to me, and she knew how I was willing to do anything for my cat. I thanked her profusely that night, crying in the process.

My only caveat here, is that if you see a cat backing up directly towards you, dodge to the side a few feet, because you're about to get ""marked,"" yes *that kind* of marked.

**Veterans** - Add to your craft brewery list.

**Beaver Street Farmers Market** - Shit this is more for just a place to get cheap food. Worth it.

**Kickbacks in Riverside** - Add to the bar list. Their beer list is so huge it's now on a tablet, it was 600+ last I knew. They should be doing a beer dinner again soon (did them before the big renovation, then stopped for the construction). The beer dinners are worth looking into, it's kinda pricey, but you get quality food and lots of beer. Arrange for a car to come get you, you will be **completely shitfaced** by the time you're done.

**Kings Head British Pub** on US-1 (between Jacksonville and St. Augustine) you'll see a red double-decker bus in their front yard area.

**Metro Diner, 13 Gypsies, Culhanes Irish Pub, &amp; Singletons Seafood** - They were on ""Diners Drive-in's and Dives,"" enough said.

**Beach Road Chicken** - Fantastic fried chicken that my dad asks for every time he's in town.

**Amelia Island Shrimp Festival** - usually in the first quarter of the year.

**Wine &amp; Canvas** - There are a couple of places that do this around town.

You have continually stated that fat people are made fun of ***just for being fat*** in FPS. That doesn't fucking happen. Just because the people are all fat, doesn't mean that is why they are judged negatively in the comments and stories this sub.

It's their other negative personality traits that are the subject of the hatred and ridicule here. How do you keep missing that?

No one here is made out to be ridiculous or evil incarnate due to their weight, it's the personality that gets them in trouble with FPS. Yes, they all have a weight problem, but it is more of a side-effect of their shitty personalities than anything else.

If this subreddit made fun of obese people in a Carte Blanche manner, there would not be a significant population of subscribers that admit to being obese ***openly*** in the comments -and they do not get made fun of or become the subject of ridicule for their weight-.

This isn't just Paris, it's pretty common in Europe (aside from the UK) in my experience. In Holland my mother was walking home with two bags of groceries once (lived there for awhile, this wasn't just a vacation) and she was shoulder checked by an old biddy so hard that mom fell to the ground and spilled her bag into the road. This was a 5 foot wide sidewalk and **no one else was on it(!!!)** yet this old biddy felt the need to cross over to her side of the sidewalk and purposefully shoulder-check my mother and laugh when mom was knocked over. (This was not an uncommon experience either. Many times you would see people do this intentionally if you paid attention and watched out for it.)

The old woman was at least in her late 60's or early 70's, yet shoulder-checked mom like a linebacker.

We eventually just started holding our ground and just shoulder-checked people back when out an about over there. When my grandmother visited, my mother and father would stay close to either side of her and run interference because she would not have been able to keep upright if she was shoulder-checked like we had grown used to.

One of the memes for this sub is the comment about the subject of the story possibly not ""making it."" That sentiment is not coming from a place of hate, but of hope for their future.

Some antagonists get hate here, but only due to other flaws inherent to the person as a whole (entitlement, rudeness, bigotry, racism, ageism, drug abuse, sloth, gluttony, hygiene or lack thereof, body shaming, hypocritical nature, ignorance, etc.), the list is long, but these traits are not difficult to identify in the characters in these stories.

Yet you state time and again that this sub is about fat hate at it's core. You're wrong. I'm trying to show you why. You seem to think that it's a matter of interpretation of intent. No, it's spelled out in the rules. Fat people can be hamplanets, (the definition is in the sidebar if you need a refresher), but it's not a definition that applies across the board just because someone's BMI just went from 25 to 26+ or from 29 to 30+. Not all fat people are hamplanets, but all hamplanets have severe issues integrating into society and acting like the human beings that they resemble.

The biggest ^tee^hee thing to remember is that FPS has many active subscribers who tip the scales into obesity, yet they are emphatically ***NOT*** hamplanets because they do not have (or at least do not display) the negative qualities listed above that define a hamplanet.

If I remember right it was an HBO documentary, and the parts of it that I did see were very good. It was truly scary the lengths that this ""church"" goes to in order to keep high profile members. They have broken their own rules about ""suppressive people"" and no contact for Tom Cruise in order to keep him as a member of the church, his kids and Ex-Wife are considered anathema, and true members are not supposed to have ***any*** contact with ""suppressive people."" They have bent the rules for him, but he hasn't seen his kids in years and has only spoken with them on the phone.

There was actually a recent rumor on the paparazzi websites that Tom Cruise was considering leaving the church due to his kids, because they are now getting to be of the age where he will be forced to cut **ALL** contact. It went into detail about how one of his phone calls to his daughter made him realize that he was missing a lot of her life and had begin to question his religion because the church has dictated to him that he will need to cut all contact very soon (it has to do with the daughters age and finally being old enough to be judged personally responsible for not being a member of Scientology, IIRC).

The only problem with this method is that if you are drug tested it shows up as heroin due to coming directly from the poppy seeds (or bulbs) because that is not filtered properly or something.

Unfortunately it was not as effective, or strong enough for my personal needs.

3191,"Since I'm in the pill mill state, and I am on C2 drugs for my nerve pain I am unable to use MMJ, because I am piss tested monthly in order to receive my prescriptions. I have just started using CBD vape juice in an effort to use less of my prescription painkillers, and that has also helped with the nausea lately.

I was very up front with my doctor about the CBD vape juice, because I was worried that it would affect my drug tests.

I brought it up to my pain doctor (actually to be honest she's a nurse practitioner that I see 9-10 times a year, I only see the doctor 2-3 times a year) and she is using it for her anxiety and pain.

She complained that the one she was buying tasted like ""grass"" and didn't do anything for her pain, only her anxiety. I handed her my vape and begged her to try mine (high dosage and flavored without being watered down). She loved the flavor, and within 5 minutes noticed -from one large puff- that her headache was going away. I am now using it with her blessing, and if my drug test pops for MJ (it shouldn't, but I'd rather speak up about it preemptively) she said we would both go to the head of the practice together and talk to him about why/what happened. She is fully in my court on it and will probably order her juice from the same place we are from now on.

My family doctor is aware of it as well and recommends it for her seizure/ epilepsy patients.

It doesn't give me the munchies, but it has done wonders for my anxiety and pain level (in combination with my meds). I'm hoping to get to a point where I'm just taking my extended release pain meds and not the instant release, unless I have a bad day or hurt myself.

The chances of it affecting my piss test are low, but because there is always some minuscule level of THC if the test is sensitive it *could* pop positive. Once this state legalizes for medical (which should be during next years elections) my doctor will happily switch me to MMJ, they are fully in support of it. The penalties here can get the prescribing doctor in a **LOT** of trouble if you test positive for MJ and opiates (due to a work/ traffic accident or whatever).",2015-12-30 16:58:42+00:00,cyg9uri,5.0,t1_cyg96cv,1063.0,fatpeoplestories
3192,"Somewhat better, but I still have to take a nausea pill at least once a day, and I still end up skipping meals because I'm not feeling well. My body doesn't like tylenol, and my prescription pain med has tylenol in it. Not only that, but when combined with my mental stability meds I was basically unable to eat or keep things down. My doctors said I would get accustomed to the meds and that my bouts of nausea would eventually go away, but they didn't give me anything for the nausea until I'd lost at least 40-45lbs in less than 6 months. 

(*In the first 6-8 months of dealing with this I went from 190-195lbs to 130lbs.*)

One of my doctors (***finally***) looked at my chart for the previous 6 months, after listening to me complain (yet again) about how I was sick all the time, and saw the drastic drop in weight and finally gave me a prescription nausea med.

During that time before I was given something for the nausea, nothing over the counter worked for me. I finally found one thing I could keep down (but only in small amounts, maybe one spoonful every few hours) peanut butter.

Just to give you an idea of how bad and sudden my vomiting was... I ended up going from ""man I don't feel good"" to ""surprise vomit!"" in about half a second at work. I didn't even have time to get the trash can in front of me at my desk and I vomited all over myself. At work. Yeah, that was fun. I had to figure out what to use for the entry in the time keeping system for ""cleaning up my own puke.""

I was terrified of being condemned as you were, that I would be admitting that I would be fat for the rest of my life, and that I could not lose the weight.

I would say no, you don't get a body high, not unless the THC is significant.

There is no ""high"" unless you get some of the weird stuff from a head shop that claims to be CBD only. 

We order online and get a 300mg 30ml bottle of CBD vape juice for around $70. It's not cheap, but this isn't meant for session level smoking. It's more meant for usage at a level of, taking a few puffs (total) every few hours or so.

You clearly misunderstood or refused to accept how I attempted to explain it, you have your own feelings on it and I can accept that. What I won't accept is continuing a discussion with someone who will not accept that there are things that are subjective. 

The peer pressure topic is a perfect example. I say they are peers because the people in the story are of a similar age as the OP, young and probably within 5-ish years of age in relation to the OP.

You then made a strawman argument wherein a person who may be guilty of murder blames his actions on peer pressure. I'm not saying that OP couldn't resist it and had no choice, I'm saying that peer pressure is being used as a tool by that group to coerce him, and to attempt to make him feel like an absolute shit for saying no to a situation that, on the outside, looks innocuous, stupid, and non-threatening.

Moreover that tactic was psychological in nature, relying on how most normal people would react to rectify an unpopular decision among people of their age group to avoid being branded as an asshole. Those people are technically labeled as peers, even if you don't personally know them. 

I also submit that when a person is tried for a crime, their jury is formed with people that do not know the accused (one type of peer), but they yet represent people of a similar background and age range (another type of peer).

Your refusal to even consider that the word peer has two possible definitions, and no reconsideration was given based on that knowledge, (and yet, you say that **I** don't have a good grasp on the English language), leads me to the conclusion I stated previously.

Two words: peer pressure

&gt;&gt;Dehumanize: Deprive of positive human qualities. 

You chose one very selective definition (see below).

&gt;There was no intimidation and no one forced him to do anything. 

In what world is it NOT intimidating to have a room full of people asking you to perform something on the spot (again, peer pressure)? It's not brass knuckles and knives intimidating, but it's intimidating to someone like OP, who is admittedly shy and introverted.

&gt;He was not deprived of positive his human qualities. Seriously? Come on, dehumanization is a term was save we save for things like war crimes, torture and and discrimination against marginalized groups, not situations a person could have turned down an unwanted advance and chose not to. 

Google's definition: Dehumanization is the psychological process of demonizing the enemy, making them seem less than human and hence not worthy of humane treatment. This can lead to increased violence, human rights violations, war crimes, and genocide.

Keyword: psychological.

Keyphrase: making them **seem** less than human and hence **not worthy** of humane treatment

To compare someone working in an above-board job to a streetwalker who will do anything for $20 isn't dehumanizing? How about attempting to remove his ability to say ""No"" by peer pressure? Isn't that the definition you were looking for?

3257,"So being pro-vaccination is now an anti-conservative agenda? People who label themselves as conservatives can't be outraged about something that can kill friends or family members? 

Are you willing to tell all of those conservatives that they are not entitled to the same medical care that liberals get? Because if it's an evil liberal plot, then obviously the best thing to do is stop vaccinating conservatives right? Give those damn liberals a what-for by inviting Darwinism back into the American Healthcare System, right?!

What part of ensuring that future generations do not have to suffer from 100% preventable diseases (like Polio) makes it a strictly liberal plot? Ensuring the longevity of Americans as a whole has always just been in everyone's best interest.

(In the USA) Out of the 159 reported measles cases between January 4, 2015 and April 2nd 2015, 22 of those were hospitalized for their infections, 5 of those 22 contracted pneumonia. It's sheer luck no one died from it. Three of the cases were babies between 6-11 months old (who were vaccine eligible by the way).

If those people had been vaccinated, no one would have needed hospitalization, which in turn would have **reduced or eliminated** any potential drain on the healthcare system, saving money right where the conservatives want to cut it. 

So there you have it folks, I guess it's a closed case! Them dayum leebruhals have the sole claim on fackts, seyence, and mohdern medicine. Conservatives must believe in nothing but the power of sweet baby Jesus and his brother the flying spaghetti monster to protect them from disease.

So anyway, we ordered pizza because we cannot expect her to cook and run, and the delivery guy walks in with a stack of pizzas (8 of us, and 4 of them are big men with large appetites), sees our gaming table with figures on it, and a map drawn on the plastic -dry erase marker of course- and his jaw just *drops*.

He wanted to just stop working and join us *sooooo bad*, I actually felt sorry for him. He asked what ruleset we were using, etc. I'm going to say this is one of the very few times we were playing 3.0 rules as we all collectively agreed that they fucking suck.

One of the guys (who passed away a year and a half ago) was a truck driver who ran around the state delivering parts for Toyota and some other things like that and was constantly loaded at that time in his life. I'm pretty sure he slipped the guy a $50 as a tip.

He would rationalize taking my money from me and twist words in such an intricate ways that he would con me into believing that it was the right thing to do. He was too lazy to go get a job for himself and start being responsible. 

My departure from his circle started a chain reaction of the entire circle of friends imploding in on itself. He started showing his true colors when everyone started distancing themselves from him. Even his pregnant girlfriend left him. 

When he reached out about 8 years ago, his profile on social media was detailed enough to show me that he was back to his old habits and using people to build himself up as a person.

He's someone who needs a dose of lead to the brain, and it would not affect me in the least if he died. I would happily load and fire the gun myself if I was given a ""no repercussions"" opportunity.

Maybe that makes me a bad person, but I truly believe that he is evil incarnate.

I had a horrible ""friend"" like this, and when I severed ties with him it was like a giant weight had been lifted from my shoulders. 

He gave me the last motivation to drop him like a stone when he expected me to keep giving him rides to school (he technically lived in a different school district), after he insulted me **and** continued to egg me on. This was after I told him that if he spoke again that morning during the drive, he was no longer welcome in my car. 

After school he walked out to my car and expected me to just drive him home and forget about what happened that morning. It really showed me how little respect that he had for me as a person. 

In the end he found someone else to be his bitch, and it took a few days for him to show back up at school.

Her teeth are like razors. She had cut the string and had it down her throat in seconds. Three vet trips and $2k later she didn't barf it, and still poops normally. It's soft, so it's possible that it was balled up in a poo kernel or digested. She is not allowed to have string toys anymore.

3532,"My husband saw one like this recently. It was around 6AM on a decently quiet road that leads to a highway. The guy behind him rode up on hubby's bumper, swerved to the right to pass and less than a mile later had rear ended a car sitting at a red light. 

Hubby stopped (edit: stopped /=/ stooped) and told the woman who was hit that he'd be willing to testify that the guy at fault was driving like a maniac and gave her his info. That guy saw hubby pull over and talk to her, and shortly after hubby left, the asshole drove off without waiting for the police. Hubby spoke with the police about what the guy looked like, and gave what descriptors he could of the asshole and his car (hubby was blinded by the headlights and no one got the damn tag number).

That guy is now on the hook for a hit and run where the other driver was taken to the hospital.

3539,"Reddit tip of the day, double space between paragraphs for line breaks (this works on both mobile and desktop).

Reformatted the story from wall of text into readability.

*(Edit: Since someone PM'd me mistaking me for OP, I want to make it clear I am not OP. I just made the story easier to read by adding line breaks.)*

&gt;I was so grateful to have found this topic and relieved to know I wasn't the only one who has a problem with fatties. I try to be a tolerant person, truly I do, but fat people, their habits, their personalities, and their ways of thinking absolutely suck. No one I have known has embodied the fatso mentality and lifestyle more than my ex. 

&gt;I spent twelve years of my life with him and almost married the fat fck until I came to my senses and asked my self what the fck I was doing. He didn't start out obese. At the beginning of our relationship, he was a talented ice-hockey player and of a mostly normal body weight. I thought he was destined for a career in either the NHL or at least the minors. Then he aged out of his league, took a job in his father's union, and turned into a hog. By the time I left him twelve years later, he was closing in on 300 lbs. 

&gt;In so many ways, his obesity and his overeating negatively impacted the quality of our relationship. For example, one time I was invited to go down the shore with him and his family. I wanted to ride bikes one day, but fatty had trouble even walking, so I ended up riding bikes with his sister while he sat inside the house watching TV and stuffing his face. When I came home and complained that I wished he had come with me, all he could do was whine and say, ""You don't know what it's like to be fat!"" If I had had a backbone back then, I would have shot back, ""Okay, well then don't you think it's high time to lose weight?"" 

&gt;Throughout our relationship, all he wanted to do was sit in his house, feed his face, and watch Flyers games. He showed no further interest in playing hockey because he had gotten too fat. We used to go ice skating, which I loved, but he stopped doing that, too, because of his weight problem. The joke was that I wasn't supposed to notice that he was fat and that all his excess blubber was causing problems for both of us. 

&gt;Because he had money, my parents urged me to stay with him because he could financially save my piss-poor family. Also, I feared I couldn't do any better and that no one would want me. That was BS. I was thin, beautiful, and young. I could have done waaay better! 

&gt;He would tell me repeatedly that he would change by losing weight and becoming more active, but whenever he tried to do either, he would fall off the bandwagon and just eat more, which of course made him fatter and thereby lazier. He blamed his weight problem on me. Because somehow he reasoned that because I had a healthy appetite, it encouraged him to gobble like a hog at a trough. Talk about f*cked-up thinking. 

&gt;He discouraged me from going back to school because such an act would have demonstrated that I had self-discipline and ambition, both of which he lacked. So he put a diamond on my finger, and then I wised up. I peeked ten, fifteen, twenty years into the future and saw the health problems I knew he would develop that would probably widow me at a young age. 

&gt;Scarier still was the fact that any children we had would be fat like him. I absolutely did not want fat kids. Because he had money, I was supposed to believe that life with him would be grand. Yeah, right. Flash forward many years later and I have been married for almost ten years to the handsomest, sweetest, kindest, funniest man on earth, and he is skinny and perfect!

I can't say that I know what it's like, but I do know that the majority of addictive behavior has a basis in mental illness and possibly even depression.

You have programmed your brain to provide your body with doses of oxytocin as a reward from food. This is a chemical reaction that the body enjoys, that can be obtained in other ways also. Like when someone tells you that they quit smoking, the positive reinforcement/ feedback from the person or people they are speaking to, causes a release of oxytocin as a ""reward mechanism"" to reinforce the action taken (which could have required significant effort) that was spoken about.

It can be felt, sometimes as a sort of rush, or tingling. Runners who experience ""runners high"" are talking about this feeling (*I think*).

But instead of normal things that should be rewarded, you have programmed your brain to do this with food. Unfortunately, unlike quitting smoking, or another significant life change, you can't quit eating. Eating is a part of life, and you can't just stop eating, it's kinda important to eat in the first place.

I highly recommend that you seek medical support for overcoming this. I would recommend trying a therapist or psychiatric professional who specializes in addiction.

3564,"&gt; would rather nitpick on grammar than attempt to make a valid argument, because you know your wrong.

I'd just rather nitpick your grammar because when someone has a good or valid point to make, the use of bad grammar makes the argument have considerably less weight to it. It can be so distracting, and sound so uninformed, that you end up with a downvoted post, and a harsh reaction from the community. Not unlike the one you're receiving now.

Also, unlike people like yourself, I can also admit when I'm wrong. TIL MJ has tar. However, it also has **never** caused cancer.

""THC is a bronchial dilator, which means it works like a cough drop and opens up your lungs, which aids clearance of smoke and dirt.""

""Marijuana laws make it harder to use marijuana without damaging your body. Water-pipes are illegal in many states. Filtered cigarettes, vaporizers, and inhalers have to be mass produced, which is hard to arrange `underground.’ People don’t eat marijuana often because you need more to get as high that way, and it isn’t cheap or easy to get (which is the reason why some people will stoop to smoking leaves.) This may sound funny to you — but **the more legal marijuana gets, the safer it is.**""

**""no case of lung cancer resulting from marijuana use alone has ever been documented""**

""regular marijuana smokers (defined by up to a joint a day for seven years) had **no discernible impairment in lung activity** from non-smokers.""

""In fact, researchers were surprised to find marijuana smokers performed slightly better than both smokers and non-smokers on the lung performance test. Why? The most likely explanation seems to be that the act of inhaling marijuana—holding each puff in for as long as possible—is a lot like a pulmonary function test, giving marijuana smokers an edge over their cigarette smoking counterparts.""

""“Early on, when our research appeared as if there would be a negative impact on lung health, I was opposed to legalization because I thought it would lead to increased use and that would lead to increased health effects,” Tashkin says. “But at this point, I’d be in favor of legalization. Tobacco smoking causes far more harm. And in terms of an intoxicant, alcohol causes far more harm.""

Those quotes are from [this](https://patients4medicalmarijuana.wordpress.com/marijuana-info/marijuana-vs-cigarettes/) article.

Smoking **anything** causes damage to the cilia in your lungs, hell just being around a campfire does that. Of course no one who is considered to be in one of the ""at risk"" groups when it comes to lung illness or respiratory problems should smoke **anything.** However, just like with cigarettes, you are personally not going to be able to dictate what another person does. Many people with chronic bronchitis smoke cigarettes, hell I *was* one of them.

Some people have nausea so badly that they cannot keep anything down, so that means the edible method for ingestion is impossible. Obviously vaping would be the best delivery method for people like that. However, as noted by many in the community (and the quote in the article), if the local laws don't allow for people to purchase vaporizers, then should they just go without? No of course not.

There are still states that don't have a medicinal legal system for marijuana. You can't get edibles, rubs/ creams, vape fluid and the like there. It's an option for some but not all, and there are people who need to use it outside of those states.",2015-11-11 19:03:15+00:00,cwwssak,6.0,t1_cwwqf6y,3515.0,trees

She couldn't eat. Soft ramen noodles made her gag. She threw up broth. She couldn't keep anything down. The last round of chemo + radiation she said she was ""done"" if this didn't put her into remission, she wanted to die. 

My dad (her brother) is staunchly against MJ. He thinks that as long as it's illegal at the federal level no one should be using it. I was still |---| close to just scoring for her anyway and driving it to her city (4-5hr drive across the state) for her.

She is still alive today, so she was one of the 5% that lives longer than 5 years after being diagnosed with stage 4. Medical marijuana would have helped her.

When I was sent to a pain management doctor because no one could figure out what is wrong with my back, they put me on opiates. That mixed with my other medicines (for mental stability) made me sick as a dog. I couldn't keep anything down. I couldn't eat, or I'd throw up. I had days at work where I would get up every 20 minutes to puke in the bathroom. The only thing I could keep down was peanut butter, and I didn't find this out for months. 

I begged both of the doctors treating me for a nausea med. They both said I would acclimate to the meds and essentially ""get over it."" I went from a very overweight 185-190lbs (at 5'4"", I'm not proud of that) down to 135lbs. This went on for six months and when I hit around 150lbs and my pain doctor finally looked over their charts at my recorded weight for the last six months and saw the problem. Eventually, they finally gave me a nausea med.

I ***STILL*** have to take it every single day or I throw up.

I'm killing my liver with pills, but it's illegal to smoke (or otherwise ingest) a plant based medicine that would not only take care of my pain, but would not damage my body. We live in a fucked up society.

We were at the [big tank](https://youtu.be/aohXqsXtr20), (this video is from our trip there last month) and this monster kid (attitude, not size) decided that instead of *going around the lady in a wheelchair,* who was as close as possible to the glass, he was going to step **OVER** that lady's knee. He was 8-9-ish and after placing one leg over mine (effectively straddling my injured knee) he had to put his hands *somewhere* in order to support himself as he lifted his other leg. He decided to use my knee as his support device.

I screamed in pain, tears springing to my eyes, my friends and husband asking what the fuck happened, or why this child laid hands on me at all (some didn't see it) and where the fuck the father was. 

He had been behind me and just to my left (my left knee was the injured one) and was absolutely horrified.

He was oh-so sorry, don't know why little Jimmy (or whatever his name was) would do something like that... etc etc.

And they just got the license plate from the footage, meaning they'd know who was driving. And it wouldn't be too hard to eliminate suspects, it's not like this guy would be hard to recognize.

* Person missing was known, this is how Amber Alerts work, they broadcast the picture and description of the missing child/young adult, not the perpetrator.
* The van was reported as stolen that day, so no one knew what the kidnapper looked like, since the owners were accounted for. 
* Most car thefts do not have a description of the thief, as they happen while the owner is somewhere else, or out of line of sight. Even if they did know what the car thief looked like, there is nothing connecting him to a kidnapping. These are separate crimes.
* If I give you a description of a bearded man with a leather vest and tattoos, I highly doubt you will get less then 1,000 results within any city, even most small ones.

3637,"Block her phone number, change yours, and use &lt;star&gt;69 when calling your mother or any other family members. It may even be worth it to have a burner phone (or Google Voice) with a number your mother does have (in case of emergency only). Then you can screen all calls and VM's **and** don't have to be bothered on your actual cell with NGma's bullshit. 

Are you renting a house (or part of a duplex) or an apartment/ condo? Depending on what you're renting determines how to handle any prowlers. Even if you know her, and even if you are related to her, you have ***EVERY LEGAL RIGHT*** to tell her to stay the fuck away from you. You are not forced to talk to (or suffer in the presence of) family just because they are family. You do ***NOT*** have to put up with her because you are related to her. Once you ask her to leave, if she continues to come around or stays on the property, you should be calling the police. Start the documentation process now before she weasels her way into your home (physically or in spirit -by driving a wedge between you and your SO).

You have the right to tell your side of the story, but if your siblings cannot see what is going on, it's worth letting the relationship with them sit on the back burner for awhile until they become adults. The stage of life they are in means that (typically) they are very dependent on your mom and possibly NGma for the time being. They cannot escape, and are essentially in a toxic, brainwashing environment on a daily basis. 

The best you can do right now is just remove yourself from this situation and **take care of yourself first.** You have every right to have people removed from your property, or property you are renting, because you do not want to see or talk to them. Once you ask her to leave and she refuses, or if she comes around again, you can call the police to have her escorted away.

NGma's continued harassment of you is escalating because she is starting to realize that she has lost her grip on you. She will continue stepping it up to get results that she wants (IE- you to come ""back into the fold"") or until you put a stop to it legally. 

Once you have enough voicemails, texts and/ or police reports you can not only request legal aid, but you also have a great way to show your siblings what she was doing to you when they are old enough to make decisions on their own and understand more ""adult"" relationships/ consequences.

I empathize with you greatly, because my NGma was a stone cold hearted C--- (I don't use the word commonly, she is so special that she absolutely one-hundred-thousand-percent deserves that title). She would regularly pit two of her children against the third with lies and manipulation tactics for her personal enjoyment (my dad being the one who was on the ""outs"" most, and mainly because he was the only male). She once said there was no way I was a part of ""the family"" when I had one of my first hormonal migraines. She tore me down and said very nasty things about me (*and my mother, blaming her for my messed up genes*) in the hallway outside of the room I was staying in at her house. I think I saw/ visited her less than a dozen or so times *total* in my lifetime, and some of the things she said or did to/ about me left very permanent scars on my self confidence that I still have yet to deal with fully, and I'm almost 37.

She offered my dad $5K or $10K to not marry my mother on their wedding day. NGma and EGpa attempted to ruin my parents honeymoon by following them in a separate car and basically acting like stalkers or the worst over-stayed-your-welcome relatives.

Please take care of yourself first. Your family will either sort this out with you at a later date, or you are better off without them. My husband has taught me that you are allowed to have a family of choice, and do not have to acknowledge any relationships with abusive family, ""because they're family."" He disowned his own mother and we hired a cop to keep her out of our wedding.

When I was a kid it was:

* Tomatoes

* Peanuts (and other nuts to a much smaller degree)

* Chocolate

* Citric Acid (found in fruity treats too, not just fruit)

* OTC lotion that the doctor recommended (Aveeno)

* some detergents, fragrances (which was not pinpointed until later in life)

So no redsauce spaghetti, no peanut butter, no chocolate, and no oranges, lemons, limes or citric acid heavy drinks, sorbet, or candy. My reaction to these? Skin rashing in the joints of my body (inside of elbow, back of knees, backs of hands, ankles). It would get so bad my parents would safety-pin dads business socks to the arms of my nightgowns (over my arms/ hands). This was so I wouldn't scratch myself bloody, and it didn't always work. *It's called Atopic Dermatitis, or Atopic Eczema and it sucks balls.*

I learned to love [Zero](https://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lykfqrhNcd1qja9zyo1_500.jpg) candy bars, and **thankfully** grew out of those (for the most part). Yes, even though it says peanut as part of the nougat, they didn't make me breakout.

3714,"&gt; But social awkwardness has to be recognized in order to label yourself with it.

You've never been told something about yourself by someone?

&gt;doesn't even know when a situation is awkward or not, because they are emotionless, they don't feel the awkwardness

No. Just.. no. Analytical thinking and problem solving skills will get you there too. You can identify it after the fact.

&gt;The fact that you label yourself as socially awkward means you realize your lack of social skills, which is in itself a social skill, and a level of awareness.

Again, no. You can adopt another person's label for yourself. ""Wow you're a bitch!"" ""huh, yeah I guess I am."" that doesn't require the person to realize that they are a bitch ""in the moment.""

&gt;When you don't care if something is awkward or not and just let go, then it ceases to be something that stands out in your reality.

Not necessarily, social awkwardness is also described by someone who doesn't know *how* to do very basic things in a social situation, like small talk, or comforting a friend in need.

&gt;Many extroverts and socialites are emotionless, they just are able to mimic and feign emotion

Those are sociopaths, not extroverts and socialites.

&gt;fool themselves that they are emotionless(or force themselves to be emotionless) when in reality they are just repressed because it is a way to mentally justify their reality.

Or never learned how to empathize with people. If you can't relate to someone, you can't put yourself into their shoes and experiment with feelings.

Many autistic people label themselves as emotionless, yet they have outbursts when it's something that affects them personally. If it doesn't affect them on a personal level, then they typically cannot empathize and therefore feel ""blank"" or emotionless.",2015-10-21 07:49:15+00:00,cw7ed8w,6.0,t1_cw7e2bs,1228.0,AskReddit

3732,"&gt;Being RBN, when someone gets that angry, the first thing you think is ""They are going to hit me"". I guess I should have just said something before.

Even though my parents are not N's I always had a fear of this, that I would be beaten or shunned for &lt;whatever&gt; when they were angry at me. I get it at work, and when my boss pulls me aside for a talk, I do my best to hold it in, but I always end up crying in fear. (My manager isn't very happy about me doing this, he doesn't understand and I can't explain it.)

My dad did strike me (repeatedly) in anger once in middle school.    
*My mother got to him at about swing 5 or 6 and pulled him off of me and threw him into a wall. Imagine a 4'11"" woman throwing a 6'1"" guy into a wall.*

However, I was always scared of being hit before that incident too. I don't want to say it was from spankings because I do believe that they have a place in child rearing, but I know he hit me much harder than necessary. 

It took me a long time to realize that my father has many FLEAS and some of the things he does are not ""correct"" but it's leftovers from the way he was raised.

Unfortunately they only went back 5 years, but even people who didn't work there anymore received the money that was owed them. My check wasn't significant (a whopping $47), I filed the complaint due to the morality issue more than anything else.

This same place expected me to make deliveries to customers (not food, this was a print shop) in my own car.

Even if it's not a ""sanctioned work function"" the way these people know each other is from the workplace. That being the case, a certain level of decorum is expected. He crossed the line.

What I'm not saying here is if a situation like this happens and you have **no ties** to the offender **at all**, that you should run and tattle to their employer. In this case, what the entitled whale said can have an impact on their working relationship. Anything from uncomfortable snide comments about the coworkers fiancee, to outright retaliation for the refusal to ""share her.""

To compound this, most companies have a ""no fraternization"" (no dating or sex) policy, which can extend to family and close friends of two coworkers. That kind of emotional garbage can spill over into the workplace and create a highly volatile situation, which is exactly why it's frowned upon.

It was in their best interests to report those remarks if they were offended by it. This also ensures that the offender can't turn the situation around and try to hurt or damage the reputation of the OP, or her fiancee at &lt;workplace&gt;.

3830,"**Probably not what you're looking for, but thank you. Really, thank you. I could never do what you do.**

I came close to your type of work when I was dispatching Emergency Road Service (tow trucks) for AAA a long time ago. We had one call that was absolutely brutal, for everyone involved. From the guy who called, the driver I sent out, my boss breathing down my neck making it impossible to concentrate, the rest of my drivers were told to either shut ~~the fuck~~ (wasn't allowed to say that) up for 30 minutes or they had to call in and have one of the other dispatchers (who is working a different city) help them.

The man had been through so much, and I don't even know why we were the ones who had to get the car removed. I have never heard of this happening **ever** since then either.

Essentially his wife shot herself in the car about a week to a week-and-a-half prior. Bullet to the head, blew out her gray matter all over the inside of the car.

Keep in mind this is Florida, if it's anytime between March-April to August-September, we can be high 90's and up in daytime temperature. Also, garages are not typically air conditioned.

The city/county had concluded their investigation, and released the car back to the gentleman after they finished with it.

This car had been sitting for at least a week, with chunks of gray matter and blood in it. In a garage. In the Florida heat.

And he expected AAA to tow the car and get rid of it for him....

AAA drivers are not trained for that type of thing (biohazard). My supervisor called around to local tow shops and found someone willing to do it for an additional $50 fee, to be paid directly to the driver. We (AAA) also agreed to buy any supplies he needed, within reason, to do the job.

Keep in mind these guys are not paid well enough to put up with your shit if you're an AAA member. At the time, ~~drivers~~ the tow company was paid $12.75 to show up onsite, and ~$1.00 a mile for every mile over three (the first three miles is ""free"" for the lower level of AAA membership. The customer has to pay the driver this lowered fee directly if they go more than 3 miles on a basic membership).

So to remove this car, several things had to happen. 

* It was nose in inside the garage, right against the wall.

* Plastic drop cloths were purchased by the driver (we did reimburse the cost of those) so he could **get in the car** and shift it to neutral.

* The car had to be pushed out of the garage using brute force by the driver (As far as I remember the car wouldn't start originally, and was a dead car in their garage). The husband/ homeowner/ widower wanted nothing to do with this and would not help in any way (understandable, I wouldn't want to look at that/ smell that either).

* Once the car was moving the driver had to run to the door and jump in to apply the brakes, as this driveway was on a hill. Then get it lined up so he could hook it up.

He could not just back up to the garage and pull it out by the rear wheels. I don't remember why, but something about this car made it so that you *****had*****  to tow it by the front wheels. (Front wheel drive? and he couldn't drop the driveshaft?? I think.)

The driver said the smell was the worst thing he had ever smelled in his entire life. Sitting in the car with dried up blood and rotting pieces of brain was the worst thing he'd ever done in his life, and I think it made him question his job, and if he wanted to do this for the rest of his career. Tow-truck drivers are tough as nails, but this event was something that gave him nightmares.

TL;DR Always tip your tow-truck driver so he can get some food during the 10-12 hours he spends in his truck.",2015-10-05 13:44:06+00:00,cvovug9,1.0,t3_3nixn9,41250.0,YouShouldKnow

3893,"Coffee is made from water, as is tea and almost any other liquid meant for consumption. Even fruit juice is water that just happens to take on the flavor (and vitamins, minerals, etc.) of the fruit it's inside of.

It's just flavorless water that causes a problem for some people who are on the spectrum. It's not a ""rejection"" as you say, it's more like a bodily aversion.

If you drink too much of a certain alcohol (let's say Goldschlagger), and get very sick (hungover) from it, just the smell of that alcohol days/ months/ years later can make you gag. This is because your brain has programmed itself to believe that Goldschlagger will make you very sick, so it's trying to tell you to avoid it at all costs. So, because we don't have a magical whiteboard in our mind that transmits messages from our hindbrain to our forebrain, the hindbrain will instead trigger a gag reflex to protect the body from (perceived) harm.

For someone on the spectrum, their brain works differently, and things that do not make sense (consuming something with no flavor) can trigger this reaction. Sometimes it's just a ""programming issue"" in our brain trying to protect the body from harm, because if it doesn't have flavor, it must be bad for us.

Edit: It's called ""Taste Aversion."" Here is an excerpt from an article on CNN about it from 2011.

&gt;Perhaps you feel the same way about raw tomatoes, yogurt, or eggs. If there’s a food that makes you feel sick on sight, chances are that your brain is enacting a behavior that’s been passed down for millions of years. It’s called taste aversion, and it’s one of the strongest conditioned reactions in humans.

&gt;Here’s how taste aversion works: You and your buddies go out for a few drinks. You’re young and wild and love drinks with the strong coconut flavor of Malibu Rum. Things get a little out of hand, and you spend part of the night praying to the porcelain god. You recover, and next weekend go out for drinks again. The bartender passes you your favorite drink, but this time the smell of coconut immediately makes you want to vomit. You loved Malibu for years, but now, the very thought of it makes you sick.

3902,"&gt;You're assuming she expected to fit everywhere?

If she would have left the ride area we would know otherwise. So yes, I would say that she expected to fit everywhere. If she wasn't she would have been prepared for a negative fit outcome. ""Oh! Looks like I'm a little too big, I'll get off and see you at the exit!""

&gt; You're assuming she even expected to fit in the ride ?

Why else would she be attempting to sit in it? For her health?

Inductive reasoning is a logical process in which multiple premises, all believed to be true, or found true most of the time, are combined to obtain a specific conclusion. Inductive reasoning is often used in applications that involve prediction, forecasting, **or behavior.** 

Could she have been a seat tester, making sure that the ride wasn't dangerous for people of size? Sure, but given the context of the situation and other details in the story, (other ~~people~~ theme park guests on the ride, no mention of her wearing employee clothing, or reporting any fit/ seat issues to other employees) you can determine that she is not.

The entitlement is oblique, something not directly spoken, but another reasonable conclusion given the circumstances. She realizes that the belt doesn't fit, so she *fucking hides it* instead of either asking for help, or just getting off the ride quietly (almost all rides have an exit near the boarding area, either for wheelchair access, or to let people who changed their minds leave the line). There is also some entitlement from her lack of concern for her safety, or the safety of those around her. Who thinks it’s a great idea to forgo the safety measures put in place on rides? People who do not think through the consequences of their actions, a personality trait of many hambeasts in these stories, (as evidenced by their own inability to control their food-hole intake).

However, having lived in the land of the rat (Disney), I have a very long experience with people in theme parks. People on vacation do not think rationally, they fight tooth and nail to stay on rides and to stay with their party. They beg, plead, whine, and throw fits when confronted with restraints that do not accommodate them. They do stupid things like hiding the ends of a safety belt, or hope for someone to overlook their lack of harness.

You can also tell a lot about a person by what they **don't** do. By not being a responsible person and raising her hand to request help, you can easily surmise that she is in denial about her weight. 

I make no secret of the fact that my husband is a large guy. He knows that, and understands his limitations. He asks for help if he needs it, even though it may be slightly humiliating. If he can't fit somewhere he takes it in stride and most of all, he accepts that it's going to happen from time to time. The fact that she didn't do the same says monumental things ^teehee about her character, and perception of herself.

You also have to be extremely dense or in complete denial if you go to any theme park as a large person and expect to fit everywhere. 

So yes, I absolutely think that she has hamplanet levels of entitlement and stupidity. The complete lack of critical thinking and observational skills just seals the deal to me.

3929,"Biting, especially on the hands is usually either due to ""hand play"" (meaning, you wiggle your fingers or hand as a playful gesture during playtime), it can also be a result of being bottle fed, or a combination of both.

If you do play with her using your hands, stop immediately. Always hold a toy in your hand for the bites to have a non-fleshy target. If you don't do that, then it's likely that it was done in her previous home. Kittens do go through a stage of teething, usually between 4-7 months old. 

Anytime she bites, you have a choice of how to dis-incline her from doing it in the future. What worked for my mother and her cats was to yell, sharp and loud, immediately. This advice is generally best if you don't share walls with others, like in an apartment complex.

The other option is to completely ignore it, but stop all interactions with her for 10 minutes. Put her away from you and walk away. This method is what my husband and I did (for the most part), sometimes we included a dominance stare with ours because he went through a bad male dominance stage and terrorized the other cats. Our vet even checked his penis for barbs in case he wasn't fixed correctly. He was a serious douchebag when he was young.

However, the method hubby and I used takes longer. My mother's method is how mother cats teach their kittens when they're young.

My husband started including a mandatory cuddle when our boy would bite, because he only likes cuddling when he is ready for it. So it was an added annoyance as a deterrent.

To stop the nighttime crying, you have to ignore it. By reacting to her cries you reinforce the idea that she will get a response. If you want to, you can call her to you and try to show her she can cuddle with you at night (which is insanely awesome in my opinion), but don't get out of bed unless it's an ""alarm"" cry, or scream.

I know that you think you're not in a position to adopt another cat, however keep in mind that the same work will be done if you only have one cat, vs. two. The amount of added work with two kittens (instead of one) is next to nothing, you still have the expenses of food, litter, pet carrier, pet bed, and toys, it's just a little more waste to scoop up out of the litter box every day.

Cats are pack animals, and if you lock her out of your room, as another person suggested, she ""could"" experience loneliness. Realistically, cats can be very self-sufficient, and many people just have one, but if you're out for long periods (long days at work, etc.), in my opinion, you should consider a pal for her. Also, it's damn near kitten season year round in my city, and many shelters and humane societies offer discount adoption costs, just to be able to get them into a loving home.

My friends response was, ""It was just what you did. You grew up, got married and had babies. If I could go back and change it I wouldn't have had any children.""

She is exactly my mothers age. I also know that my mother had me out of obligation. She loves and cares for me deeply, but she did not want to have children at all.

4005,"Some people don't like to hear about alternative ""life scripts"" because it may make them feel uncomfortable and  question their own choices in life.

To many, the ""life script"" is, fall in love, get married, have babies, and so on. When other people show them that there are other alternatives, they begin to question their own decisions in life, often because they didn't realize that there are other alternatives when they were younger. Like living a life of voluntary celibacy, not getting married, not having children, etc.

This can make people question who they are and if they made the right choices for themselves in life. Many times, people don't realize that having children is a choice, not an obligation. There are women and men who may have felt that children were not something that they wanted (deep down) but played along with the ""life script"" because other people in their lives pressured them to do so. (""You'll feel different when it's your own!"" is a common one when the topic is children vs. not.)

Those people spout the pretty lies of their brethren because they have been assimilated into the collective and misery loves company. Deep down, some parents out there hate their lives, and wish that they had been strong enough to stand up to the criticism and make a different choice in life. Instead, an 18-20year commitment has been made, and there are no take-backs when it comes to children.

The fact that people can live a long healthy life and still feel a sense of fulfillment without having children is an uncomfortable truth to some, and instead of letting others live their lives as they wish, those people express things like hatred, envy, scorn, disapproval, and downvotes towards anyone who has made a different choice, and is happy and secure in who they are and what they want in (and out of) their life experience.",2015-09-17 16:18:57+00:00,cv4tb8r,13.0,t1_cv4qxlt,3663.0,AskReddit

4021,"It's a gray elephant, elephant gray confirmation bias.

Elephants are gray, but not everything gray is an elephant.

By stating that in ""your experience this is what you see"" you are automatically admitting that your data is not scientific. You are in a specific area, but not all areas have a population of people that equally represent what is in your town/ city/ whatever.

For instance, say there are 10 butch lesbians in your town (call it 10 per one-thousand). This is not the same in every city relative to the population numbers. San Francisco, for instance, is not going to have the same number of butch lesbians, relative to the population numbers (I'm willing to bet that the number is vastly higher considering SF is considered a Mecca for the LGBTQ crowd).

So by stating that you believe things are exactly the same as your personal experiences everywhere else (and telling everyone that they have to prove otherwise or they're wrong), you are just digging a deeper hole of embarrassment for yourself.

They also like to add embellishments of thin people calling them fat, ugly, etc. in public and pull the pity card.

There are also stories of them supposedly being shamed by their families/ friends/ coworkers/ doctors/ strangers on the street, for being fat.

4084,"I know my reply is late, but depression is not something to fuck around with. Some people say things like, ""I agree with getting help to get through a rough patch,"" which completely demoralizes anyone with continual mental health issues. I hate seeing that because if it's a true chemical imbalance it's (generally) not a temporary thing, and anyone who has continuing issues can take that statement and make self-image issues of themselves over it.

I have battled depression for a very long time. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II, but I think really it's more Major Depressive Disorder. I'm almost never happy. During my worst episodes I wanted to drive off a bridge (it took a lot of effort to *not* turn the steering wheel), or go play in traffic on a major highway (that was within 60-ish feet of where I was while on break at work).

I still have thoughts about how my husband would be better off without me around. I feel like a dead weight. I'm in constant pain from 4 different issues with my back, so I take a lot of medicine and feel like I contribute nothing due to my weaknesses. I feel like I don't contribute, and I do not take care of myself like I should. I also have anxiety, so I can get stuck in a mental feedback loop when those two things act up on me at the same time. I have a skin disease that manifests in rashes all over my body, and trust me, that doesn't help one fucking bit with my image issues.

I'm on a medicine now that has a *side effect* of treating nerve pain (and this is why I'm on it), but it was developed for MDD. I'm not better, by any means, but at least I'm not idolizing suicide anymore.

I don't know what country you're in, but I would highly recommend talking to a psychiatrist. Not a *therapist*, **a psychiatrist.** Here, psychiatrists are the ones who can also prescribe drugs to help regulate your brain chemistry.

Personally I've been on a lot of them, and most of the time what happens is after two months I feel better and stop taking it, or I don't feel better and stop taking it, because it's doing nothing due to building up a tolerance to it. In one case it made my depression worse and that was the time I wanted to go play in traffic.

Generally, you're not going to be like me and have as much difficulty in finding a drug regimen that works for you. I'm just a speshul sneauflayke in that regard.

Please seek help. I know how it feels, and it sucks to go through life like this. The general idea isn't to suffer like this, no one should ever have to. Let me know if you need anyone to talk to. I'm here for you.",2015-09-06 20:11:48+00:00,cusrhzi,2.0,t1_cupmqcc,259637.0,fatpeoplestories

I parked in a handicapped spot in a strip mall, and some asshole decided that he was above such meager things as parking *spaces* so he decided to park in the striped area to the side of the handicapped spot meant for unloading from a vehicle.

What you have is a Lilac Point Siamese. There are two ""flavors"" of Siamese when it comes to bone structure of the face (*I think it's American vs. Asian, but I'm note sure. I've only noticed the difference recently because I haven't had a Siamese cat in over 15 years* =( ), beyond that the colors exist in both sub-types. My first cat when I was a little girl was a Lilac Point Siamese, and she looked exactly like yours.

4103,"I have multiple issues wih my back that cause me to take two different opiate painkillers a day, and often if it's a bad day you'll see me taking very short, limping-halting steps. I have come very close to using a scooty puff at the grocery store, but I don't want to have one of these experiences.

The few times I have used one I haven't really had issues (with people tryng to give me a hard time), because I generally have crutches too *(busted knee, busted ankle, etc)*.

I have been forced to abandon a scooty puff in the middle of the store, and now that I think about it, this poor thing must have supported a few whales and was on it's last legs due to that. I had to crutch around the rest of that shopping trip, and I glared at every single entitled asshole hamplanet riding a scooty that I saw, (there were no more scooty puffs left and I was in a world of pain).

A married ham-couple both using scooties to putter around the store was what pissed me off the most. 

I had an encounter on Thursday that I witnessed which enraged me, but because it wasn't a planet, it's just more of a badpersonstory. 

Middle aged daughter *(or grand-daughter)* of an ancient obviously handicapped woman used the handicapped parking pass when she parked, yet dropped off the lady at the front door and picked her up there...There was literally no walking for the handicapped individual beyond the few feet out the main door to the grocery store, and **no valid reason to use a Handicapped parking space.** The way she parked to pick up the old lady was the most ignorant asshole behavior too. She blocked the entire traffic lane for the parking lot, by pulling across it diagonally in a fucked up attempt to lessen the amount of walking to the SUV door to get in that the old woman had to do. Amazingly, if she had pulled up in the area intended for loading the groceries, in the right manner, all of the walking would have been even shorter *(approximately two steps compared to the 10 or so she took)*, and no traffic would have been blocked. I was just in absolute amazement that someone could be that fucking **DUMB.**

The Doctor is a man who is near a thousand years old. I can forgive memory lapses (a Tennant trope), or using his companions to find a more ""humane"" or ""human"" answer to the problem. However, using them to solve **every single problem** to the 90% mark, just isn't something that I feel is right for the character. Boy-ish charm, fiddling with things like it's the first time seeing them... Ok, but he lost his sense of authority at the same time, and personally that made him ~~almost~~ a pretender to the throne in my eyes.

Back to your offer (Thank You, by the way!).

So, how did the story with the impossible astronaut come to happen? I know that River was alluding to being the one who killed the Doctor, but we saw him get shot, and I think there was some sort of miniaturization-of-the-people to drive a man sized robot, but I think that the Silence was involved?

Let's kill Hitler. Just so much was wrong with the history there. Was it an alternative universe? If so how does alternate River fit in? I mean, if she's an alternative version of herself, then her story or history is inherently flawed?

Feel free to elaborate in detail. I just can't fit it together.

4199,"I think both show-runners in nuWho have had their good and bad moments. What I generally dislike about Moffat is something that many people in the world of TV call a strength (the cliff-hangers making people scream at their TV in frustration).

Something else I don't like about Moffat is how convoluted the story can get and even when it's finally brought to light it doesn't make any sense until you re-watch the episodes 3-4 times. I don't feel that this was a problem in the Tennant era, because if there were strings throughout the season that tied episodes together, they were small hints, and things that when you go back and rewatch it, you see them and say, ""Oh cool."" Like Bad Wolf. (Even though that technically isn't Tennant, it was more Eccleston. However it was just the first thing that came to mind).

I basically have a giant plot-hole in my mind when it comes to certain storylines in the Matt Smith era, because I just can't bring myself to re-watch episodes with a Doctor (**and companions**) that I generally disliked from the get-go. It makes entire seasons in the Matt Smith run unwatchable for me, with a few small bright spots where I feel that a lot of potential was lost or wasted. I get lost trying to rewatch the Matt Smith era episodes, because they are so inherently intertwined that watching one or two episodes here and there ends up confusing me more than telling a story. 

To me, telling a story is what the show was not doing during the Matt Smith era. Instead, things were so convoluted and intertwined that I can't make any sense of it, and I stopped trying to.

I never understood a few things about some season-wide plots during the Smith era that I would appreciate some clarification on, but I just can't bring myself to watch the abusive relationship of Amy and Rory, along with a bumbling fool of a childish Doctor in denial, who had to be led around by the nose by his companions.

The Astronaut storyline? Big hole. Lets kill Hitler (or whatever that was) and some others I just have to hand-wave in my head because I don't have the patience to watch three characters that are all fundamentally flawed in the core of their personalities.

My opinion is probably an unpopular one (I've certainly received hate for it here before), but if anyone feels like continuing this as a discussion, where I can ask for clarification on some of the Smith era stories (and we can talk like adults who respect differences of opinion), I'd appreciate it.

I'd love some clarification or even a link to step-by-step episode summaries for these giant plot holes I have in my head.",2015-08-25 11:45:11+00:00,cueyhm4,4.0,t1_cuexjel,3389.0,gallifrey

1. Plane broke, had to switch flights. Luckily we were close to the gate and did it before the rush since we could hear them talking about the plane being broke.

2. Once we took off (an hour late) some major storms hit DFW and we could not land. So we had to fly to another airport (San Antonio maybe?). They let us deplane there, so it wasn't as bad as it could have been. This is where I personally started drinking (because fuck it).

3. We arrived in DFW well after we should have and the rental car company tried to say they gave our reservation away (since we didn't pick it up ""on time"") big fight there.

4. Speeding ticket for 75mph less than 5 mins from the airport

5. When the plane first landed my phone started blowing up when I turned it back on. I got three messages all about my Grandfather, and how he was declining (1), may not make it (2), and then dead (3), from my mother. 

6. Since this was a group vacation, with people coming in from all over the country, there was no option for me to be able to go to the funeral. It's hard to explain, we are a cross-MMORPG group of friends and go on short 4-5 day vacations together. Basically, we all played WoW together (at the time) and we'd all meet up in real life and hit up a theme park, or cruise, etc. Yes, I'm a complete dork.

7. The hotel didn't set the wakeup call that we asked them to, and we woke up about 45 minutes from when our plane was scheduled to leave. Had to risk speeding ticket #2 to make it to the plane on time.

Yes, and it took some time before I could drive more than my commute to work. I was just sympathizing, because I really do get it. I can't drive in certain parts of my city due to anxiety brought on when I'm driving in unfamiliar roads.

We have this one area, Five Points, where five roads all converge in the same spot.

Everyone is *supposed* to treat it like a round-about, but some treat it like a stop sign, some people drive to the left of the pole, and others get into the open space and come to a dead stop.

Also been there, done that. I was in a 4 car pileup on a major Florida highway. I was the only one who didn't have to be cut out of my car, didn't have to go to the hospital, and didn't die in that accident (all of those were what happened to the drivers of the other 3 cars). I walked away from the wreck and I was the only one to do so.

On the way home (was living with my parents then ~19-20yrs old at the time) I was being held by my mom in the backseat and I kept crying and asking why I was the one who walked away. I even at one point said I should have been the one who died. Which infuriated the everloving fuck out of my dad.

I held a lot of guilt over that for many years because there was a city police officer who saw the entire thing happen (he was there for the broken down moving truck at the side of the road), and after giving his statement to the state troopers, the state trooper who interviewed me told me that it was my impact as the last car that cut off a mans leg and caused him to bleed out and die on that road.

Totally get this. My mother avoids driving at all costs. When she drives a new route anywhere and has to immediately go take a dump when she gets there.

My parents found a place to rent for their business that was within walking distance from their home so mom wouldn't have to drive.

She's been getting better about it (held down a job at Home Depot driving herself to work for 10yrs, drove dad to multiple surgeries), but if there is another option she'll do that first.

I think part of it is dad likes big cars because he's an inch over 6ft tall, and my mother is an inch under 5ft tall, so most times she can't see over the steering wheel.

Most of my sounds come from people who don't even realize what they're doing and don't know/ care about it. To them it's not even noticeable.

There is subreddit for it, /r/misophonia and if you go there they have a very informative sidebar list with links and descriptions.

The admins of the original FPH did not create #2, #3, etc. Those subs were **not** created by the same people. Those subs were not modded by the same people. Individual users (non-mods) went to those subs of their own volition and called them the new home for FPH.

Our cameras, even 10 years ago, would not function in the cold of space. The lenses would either shatter, or become extremely fragile. The moving parts might freeze, etc. LORRI has no color filters or moving parts – operators take images by pointing the LORRI side of the spacecraft directly at their target. The camera has a silicon carbide construction which keeps its mirrors focused through the extreme temperatures of space that New Horizons will experience on it's journey.

So not only do you have to make a camera that operates in extreme cold, but it has to at least survive any heat generated by possibly being pointed at the sun during it's trip. The write up makes it sound like cold isn't the only factor.

(Yes, some of that is copy-pasta with some further rewording into laymans terms. Credit where it's due.)
