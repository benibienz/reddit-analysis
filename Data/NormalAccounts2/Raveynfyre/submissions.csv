We finally get up around 9am after the hurricane passed us by. Our TV and internet are out because the gateway has no lights, at all.

A service call was made for between 1-4pm today and we went about our business cleaning up branches in our yard. My husband called to ensure that someone was coming out at 1:30pm and the automated system confirmed two different dates (today and tomorrow).

Once he reached someone they told him that our appointment(s) had been canceled without warning us of this.

I say that it's a possibility that the gateway was bricked, because we have had experience with that in the past when new equipment was being mailed to us. The existing dvr box was bricked by AT&amp;T removing the device from our account. That by itself wasn't the issue, the fact that it was removed two DAYS before the new box arrived was the problem.

A new gateway is sitting in TN, and if we hadn't been hit by the hurricane it would have arrived today. So there is a reason I think that this could be the circumstance we're in, IE- been there, done that.

The phone customer service with Uverse has always been deplorable, but I don't want Comcast. At least signal with AT&amp;T doesn't go out once a week for no reason (unlike our experience with Comcast). 

I'm just ranting I guess.

Most stops were places that my parents and I had been to previously, because we lived overseas for a bit, but my fiancé had never been out of the country.

One of our stops was Edinburgh, and one of the things you can do there at night, is go on a guided [Ghost Walk-type tour](http://www.cityofthedeadtours.com/) (I think this is the right one, but I could be wrong). It's a gimmick, but it was something to do besides sit around twiddling our thumbs in the flat we had rented out for the weekend.

The tour involved some [underground catacombs (vaults)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Vaults) that were pretty interesting, some of which are very, very small rooms.

Our tour group was roughly around 25-30 people, and in the ""incident room"", we were squished in a bit.

Before we go much further, let me explain a few things. I am easily amused by farts, and frankly I don't care if you personally find them funny. I know it's on the childish side, but I refuse to grow up mentally, and they're funny damnit! I also giggle sometimes when I'm nervous.

Earlier in the day we had tried some excellent Scottish cuisine (including haggis -it is AMAZING *over there* but here in the US you get stomach acid tasting garbage) and it started percolating as we entered the vaults.

I have never been able to hold in a fart. I don't know why, maybe I just don't have the iron control over my anus that others lay claim to. I can hold a shit, but my asshole didn't come with a hermetical seal.

When we get to the incident room, I know that there will be a fart. It's just *going to happen* at that point. It was however slightly under my control **how** it would come out. I could just let it rip, or I could attempt to ease it out by increments and make it as silent as possible. Every sound in here is making an echo, and I'm not here to gross everyone out, no matter how funny **I** think it is.

I decide to do a test. As I release the clench, I find that I do have the option to go completely silent, so I do. What's the worst that can happen?? Maybe my family will smell it, but I'm fairly low on the scale of smell....... typically. I felt that I could risk gassing out my group (mom, dad, fiancé and I) and hopefully they won't say anything if it is rank.

I ease out the fart, as it goes, it burns my asshole a bit. Usually when that happens it's usually stinky, oh.. no. Within seconds I realized how much of a mistake this silent flatulation was.

My fiancé looks at me first with a Spock-eyebrow. The question is plain on his face; 

&gt;F (emote): *""Did you just fucking fart? In here?!""*

I nod and look away, smiling. I'm honest to god trying to listen to our tour guide. I'm hoping beyond hope that no one can see how much I want to laugh. I'm now smiling very hard.

A couple near us (short woman, tall man) started reacting. To not interrupt the tour guide, the man has leaned down and placed the arm of his girls jacket (that the lady had around her shoulders) over his nose and mouth. She has taken the other side of the jacket for her own safety. 

I'm now realizing that this was a **very, very bad** idea, I should have tried harder or waited for a walking part of the tour. I start getting nervous that I'll be found out. This fart has now become a solid 25 on a scale of 1-10 (the *""Run for your own safety. Fuck the kids, we can make more!""* rating). 

Other people in the room start smelling what can only be described as a 3 days dead, broiled in rancid lard skunk, that was gently glazed with Satans musky nutsack drippings, with a side of steamed durian fruit.

&gt;*Maybe this smell won't spread too much.*

I'm so nervous now that I'm doing my best to just smile and not laugh, and those are my only choices. My mother turns to look behind her, to figure out who in gods name just desecrated the room with that funk. Mom sees me, grinning as wide as I can and pursing my lips to try and *not laugh.* 


This mantra repeats over and over in my head.    
&gt;Me (internal): *I must not laugh. I must not laugh. I must not laugh. I must not laugh. I must not laugh.*

She looks between me and my husband, then realizes that I'm grinning like a suicidal madwoman and mouths the question, 

&gt;M: ""Was that YOU?"" 

with the most disgusted face I have seen from her... and honestly, that *look* made it **very** hard to hold in my laughter, because it's funny that *I* could percolate up something that bad. This is my new personal record of, ""What crawled up your ass and died?"" I nod and look away.

The stench has now filled the room, we are now at critical mass. Everyone in the room is smelling this monstrosity.

Every.      
Last.      
Person. 

Some people on the tour have started looking around to see if they stepped in a dead carcass of a putrefied rat somewhere, or stepped in Cerberus's shit, because this smell has to be from the underworld. The whole stone room has now acquired this smell, and like some kind of sick sommelier, it will not let the smell dissipate. The room has locked this noxious emanation into the stone walls, and it seems to be savoring the smell like an expensive, vintage wine from the best winery in France. 

The Tour Guide at the front is now trying to rush this room along, because he doesn't want to keep breathing this smell into his lungs. 

My father turns to me and whispers the same question that mom did. I lose it at this point and giggle like an excited four year old girl ^^he-he-hee! My father rolls his eyes and just starts shaking his head.

Now the entire tour group knows who bombed them, thanks to my laugh.

Unfortunately, we were close to the center of the room, so as the smell expanded outwards in a mushroom cloud-like effect, people are looking towards us. My giggle sealed the deal for anyone still questioning, ""Who dealt it?""

The tour guide wraps up the room, and we stayed to the back of the group for the rest of the tour.

On the plus side, I don't think they'll have any bug or pest issues for some time.

Shout-out to /u/goaskalice I know you're going to want to see this.

I joined into the conversation to share this gem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The flatulence comes after the colonoscopy, while you essentially especially deflate over the next 4-5 hours.

So my husband wakes up, I get brought in to see him and the release is going as planned, punctuated by a long reverberating fart every few minutes. It's essential that you fart before they let you go home.

The nurse tells us to go spend the rest of the day at home, and to order food delivery if he couldn't cook due to the twilight drug side effects. (I basically don't cook, because I have sliced myself open twice on butterknives while doing dishes. No I'm not brittle, just accident prone like my dad, for him it's ladders, for me it's sharp things and knives).

My husband is a big guy, he wanted food, and he wanted it ASAP. So we stopped at Dave and Busters on the way home, (it was the closest thing).

He was still farting quite a lot, but held it reasonably well while at the table. The leather seats made me very leery of staying in the restaurant very long, but my husband is good at holding farts. I have no idea how he does it, I have never been able to master that. My farts are coming out to party with everyone, one way or another (I have another story about that which I'll post soon.)

After we ordered food, he started not feeling well. So he went to the men's room, just moments after another gentleman.

Dave and Busters restrooms are tile from floor to ceiling, including the ceiling. D&amp;B designs their bathrooms like it's a potential homicide cleanup room. A completely tile room is nothing but an echo chamber. So combine my husband's very loud, very long, ""BRAAAAAAAAAT"" farts with their restroom acoustics, and it resulted in the other guy running out of the restroom with a look of sheer horror on his face (and looking over his shoulder to make sure he wasn't being followed by some kind of monster).

We changed our food order to carry out and went home.

The good side is that these didn't smell at all (or I would never have agreed to D&amp;B), he can fog entire rooms if you give him the right foods.

Friday was a ""treat yourself to dessert"" thing at the deli in my building. There were two options for $1.89. Strawberry shortcake, or a slice of cheesecake with toppings (not being weighed, most other food like this requires a scale at the register).

The options were simple, you chose either to create a strawberry shortcake (created by you, with a slice of pound cake, sliced strawberries and toppings) or cheesecake slice, also with the same topping options (incl. strawberries).

There were two slices of cheesecake when I saw the station, and I said to myself (out loud), ""I'm going to get *that* piece."" Out of the two slices left, once was about 10% larger than the other. 

Enter Hammymus Maximus. Roughly 5'10"" and 350-400 lbs. Thinning hair, extremely obese, and out of breath. He had one small container filled with ~~salad soup~~ a few pieces of lettuce drenched in ranch, with a large helping of something containing a massive amount of mayo (like a veggie or broccoli ""salad"" but our deli makes those with entirely too much mayo. Seriously, it drips......).

Just after deciding that this slice of cheesecake is going to die in the arena of food (by my fork), I walked to the opposite end of the salad bar to grab a tray-container-thing ( [like this but smaller](http://www.supplycity.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/7/1/7125.jpg) ) to put my lunch in (yeah this was my lunch, sue me).

He then moves faster than I have ever seem an extremely obese man move to the same container stack I was walking towards. He gets there first and rushes back to the cheesecake and grabs the same piece I had been gunning for. Bastard.

Important note, they were generous with the topping selection for something so cheap. The options available were; sliced strawberries, chocolate syrup, caramel syrup, and Cool Whip.

I'm now waiting for Hammymus to add his toppings since he is blocking the entire station while creating his dessert. He pours at least 1/8th of a cup of chocolate syrup AND caramel syrup onto his cheesecake. He grabs the tongs for the strawberries and adds 3-pieces of strawberry on top, and then goes for the Cool Whip.

The serving bowl that this was in was approximately the same size as the large container you can get at the grocery store. Hammymus grabs the serving spoon and somehow manages to put **half of the filled serving bowl of Cool Whip** onto his (now swimming) cheesecake slice. 

In all seriousness, I'd say that the cheesecake slices were about 2/3 the size of a **typical slice** you'd get at a restaurant. He not only buried it in with way too much syrup, but now with the addition of the Cool Whip, the serving tray/plate thing, was literally overflowing with Cool Whip.

He then picks up his other tray containing his liquid-salad lunch (same tray type but larger), gave me a shit eating grin like a spoiled child, and walked away. He tried to smile at me in the same manner that a co-conspirator would.

Defeated, I grabbed the last remaining slice and added some caramel (about a tablespoon, but I'm bad at guesstimating), strawberries and a small dollop of Cool Whip to my cheesecake.",fatpeoplestories,Friday Dessert Special at the cafe.

I was inspired to tell it due to a few things in /u/fluffskellacat 's story from the card shop.

(Oct. 2001. Orlando, FL)

Cast;     
Me (me): Socially awkward 22 year old female, 5'4"" and fit.      
Pertinent details, I was wearing a halter top that showed off my (mostly) flat stomach, a jean shirt over it but unbuttoned to attempt to maintain some modesty (*snort*), and my favorite pair of baggy jeans (JNCO's) that hung on my hips. *

RedNeckBeast (RNBeast): Misguided beast that thinks 1.) Women are objects. 2.) They do not like nerdy things. 3.) They don't play around on or work with computers.

Ian: My future husband. 31 year old male, hair down to his ass and 4 inches taller than me.

(Story)    
I went to this convention by myself, and I'm not good with crowds, or things like this, when I go alone. I am on the Aspie spectrum, (originally my best friend was going to go with me, but backed out at the last minute) so just going to a convention *alone* was a huge effort for me. 

* (Location: Vendor room)

I was trying to figure out where the free t-shirts were, but I couldn't find the right table in the vendor room. I was following the line of people walking in front of every table and I saw a guy with really long hair (down to his butt) and decided to ask him where the free shirts were. Since he was different from everyone else there, I figured he was approachable, and he'd caught my eye. Guys with long hair weren't common to me. Ian pointed the booth with the free shirts out to me, and when I walked away Ian was very disappointed and (according to him) he was trying to figure out how to talk to me again without spooking me. (I'm obviously very shy and skittish it's extremely noticeable.)

* (Location: General gathering room for the Friday night get-to-know-you party. Approximately 90 minutes later.)
    
The convention hall had a room filled with tall tables for each game server that you were meant to stand around (no tall chairs or bar stools if I remember right). During this time period on the schedule you were meant to talk to, or meet with, people from your server. I'm standing at the one for my server (Erollisi Marr), making small talk with people I don't know in an effort to try and enjoy this experience. A redneck mini-moon (RNBeast) taps me on the shoulder to get my attention. RNBeast then proceeds to look me up and down, from chest to legs and back again -**three times**-, never once making eye contact.

RNBeast then verbally vomits this priceless phrase (changing spelling to mimic the heavy Southern accent, translation will be provided in comments if required), 

&gt;**""Eye didun't knooow perrrtty gerls liiike yew plaaaayed EvvvverrrrQuuuessst!""**

At this point RNBeast is *still* eyeing me up like a prize pig at the county fair while making this one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my life. (Note: he **still** has not made eye contact.) RNBeast then just settles on staring at my chest. With his mouth open, presumably to catch flies.

This was when Ian found me again. Erollisi Marr was the server that he was a volunteer ""Guide"" for, (first level CS helper in the game who can solve issues like being stuck in the world polygons, kill mobs stuck under the world, boot automated Chinese bots out of the game forcefully, etc.) and he had decided to stop by and chat with the players from that server to see if he knew anyone that he'd helped. 

Anyway, Ian had just walked up as the verbal diarrhea came out of RNBeasts mouth. Ian catches my eye (I was desperately trying to figure a way to get away from the orbit of this offensive mini-moon without coming off as an uptight bitch) and Ian saves me by saying, ""Do you want to get a drink?"" 

Yes, he used one of the oldest lines in the pick-up line book. To me it was a lifeline. I grabbed his arm desperately and we escaped the orbit of the mini-moon. We have been together ever since and celebrated our 10 year anniversary last October.

Right now I just can’t afford to buy a decent friggin battery for the damn thing. As it is I’m waiting for the ones I have now to charge up half the time.

She sold us a kitten with a ""clean bill of health, when he was anything but. Took him home, and eventually to our vet the next business day (Monday, adopted Saturday). The little shit had two intestinal parasites.

OK, fine. He's confined to a room, and has meds. We let the agency know, as a courtesy because their other cats might be sick. Not to mention the cats from the other agency, that shared space with TARAA the same weekend. We saw our kitten placed in a cage with cats from the other agency. Oh and there was a puppy rescue right there too. 

If people just handled the cats and then went home, their animals could be sick. I accidentally called PetCo when I was trying to reach the foster/rescue and I made sure to tell them what happened. I wasn't mad, or doing this out of spite, I just wanted them to know what happened.

TARAA offers to give us some meds for one of the intestinal parasites. A dose for all the cats in the house. She backs out and gives us enough for just the kitten. In fairness, it's a pretty expensive drug, but don't change your mind because of that.

I'm not going to go into detail on this since its second-hand. But the foster called the lab where Nimitz test results were and badgered the poor girl for why they marked it as positive.

She then asked for our vets number so she could talk to her. 

Then our boy Chewie started getting sick. Just runny poo at first, but he was also growling if anyone even touched his stomach. Then he got lethargic and lost his appetite. We took him to the vet yesterday and he went from having bowel control to none. Yes.... Leaking. He also used it as a tactical counterattack when the hygiene shave was done (a shave of the fur in that area to help him stay somewhat clean...).

So that was about $500 worth of vet visit, testing and medication, on top of what we have spent on just the kitten.

Mr. Drippy is confined to a bathroom until he starts getting control of his anus. Our vet said that this was likely caused by yet another bug that the kitten had, Coronal, Coronus, something like that. It's the equivalent of a bad stomach flu and most kittens have it and it passed along in almost any manner. 

*(Side Note: we have been using antibacterial gel when leaving the kittens quarantine room, but it could have traveled on clothes. It's a nasty little bug.)*

Anyway. The location of the TARAA adoption events is PetCo in Ponte Vedra/ S. Jax Beach. If you handled any animals there on 12/5/15 and then went home and touched your animals they might be sick.

My 2nd attendant at my wedding was a woman I never met in real life until she flew down to be in the wedding. We are like sisters and talk on the phone a few times a year now. Back then it was a few times a week.

The Guild we are a part of takes a shared 4day weekend trip once a year together. We're from all walks of life and many different states, so it's nice to be together in person once a year to renew our relationships.

A long time ago, we had a member whose son was born with several heart defects and required multiple surgeries while in his infancy. I arranged a donation drive for them and researched what would help (possibly) comfort an infant who had their chest cracked open. Out of our money (not the donations, my personal money) I bought a stuffed animal that had long arms to wrap around him that could work as a coughing-pillow. 

*The theory being to clutch the pillow tight when the pain hurt, something many adults who have had open chest surgery suggest doing.*

All together we pooled around $400 and I sent them one check with the full amount (and offered to show everyone the list proving I sent the entire amount). We told them to use it to go out to dinner and hire a babysitter so they could have one night to themselves. This was before the times of GoFundMe, and the like.

Anyway, it's just so hard to explain that to *muggles* for lack of a better term. 

I'm glad I'm here with like-minded people who can understand and don't think that's a little too weird.",familymenagerie,So hard to explain my friends sometimes.,http://www.reddit.com/r/familymenagerie/comments/3hpph1/so_hard_to_explain_my_friends_sometimes/
