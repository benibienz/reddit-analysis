7,"Actually, the reasons for those countries are listed in the wiki article I linked. EU is known for it's silly regulations and overbureaucratization (is that even a word?) of simple things, so it's not weird that they can find reasons not to include them yet. There are probably deeper rooted causes of this situation, but I'm not educated in politics well enough to discuss them.

I feel like, for the sake of flairs, Europe should be either considered a single entity, or further split into smaller parts (Nordic countries for example?). ",2016-01-31 22:08:48+00:00,czizzbx,5.0,t1_cziyr5v,1973.0,TheSilphRoad
8,There are quite a few historical reasons for animosities between most of the countries in this part of the world. Grouping them together is not as bad as the choice of symbol to represent them.,2016-01-31 21:26:38+00:00,cziyeyy,3.0,t1_cziy7df,344.0,TheSilphRoad
9,"You initially made a flair for the western Europe use the stars of European Union, and yet you excluded quite a few countries that belong to it. A more natural division would probably be to group all participants of the [Schengen Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area) into one, as it simplifies travel between those countries, and travel is a big part of what all this effort is about, right? Besides, for the eastern flair you use a symbol that cannot be associated with all of the countries on that list (and would probably offend some of the people in those countries).",2016-01-31 10:55:28+00:00,czihe0o,3.0,t1_czi9inl,24109.0,TheSilphRoad

12,"The ""best of both worlds"" solution would be to offer two types of battle: ""scaled"", where pokemon levels and stats would play no role, so the match would boil down to type coverage and your general prowess in managing your pokemon; and ""regular"" where stats and IVs and all the math would come into play to offer the hardcore breeders a reason to do their thing.
