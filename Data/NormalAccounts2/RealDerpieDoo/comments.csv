I have recorded footage. from his stream (and you can see it as well if you go to his twitch,  watch the last broadcast,  at the 31 min mark i believe.. somewhere in there.)   Where he states clearly, that he does not hate drama, he loves drama. and he will be explaining that in the next video..   

Grade basically has 3 community groups that he caters to..  His youtube exclusive fans.. that basiaclly dont care.. and just watch his shit, with little more than a thought about it afterwords.    His reddit fans who quite obviously hold him to a far higher standard than he holds himself..  are are also the fans that literally MADE him the success that he is today,  also the most likely to actually think about something..   And then there are his twitch fans.. which..  as with most twitch using youtubers, are just there to throw money at him and spam the chat window.   with praise and ass kissery.   there are of course the few that frequent all forms of media.  Like myself,  an aspiring wanna be youtuber..    I have active accounts and friendships in all 3 communities..    at any rate..  From what I have see..Grade as per his OWN words,  from his OWN mouth, in his OWN stream, stated quite clearly, that he ""loves drama""   ...  so if you were hoping for anything less than some more drama. expect to be disappointed .. :p   Meanwhile his YT fans wont care.  His twitch fans will continue throwing money at him and praising his genius .. and his reddit fans will continue to fume and repeat how they are over his shit!  :P

As for the few click bait thumbs..   most are directly relevant to the content in the video.. so while it appears clickbaitly on the surface.. its still relevant..    with the expcetion of one, which is satirically clickbaity..   for instance, if I do a ""how to get youtube rich""  (satire) video..  ill talk about creaging thumbs with nothing but boobs and arrows and circles..      it will be in the name of satire :P  

as far as fonts go.. I only use 2 fonts..  in my videos I only use ONE font.. (in the actual video itself..)   but in the thumb I have to use a fatter font, because the in video font is too skinny and in the thumbnail it becomes impossible to see.    In the past I exclusivly used the skinnier font..  but I have recently started using the fatter,  easier to read/see font in the thumbs.  I'm guessing thats where you are seeing multi fonts

101,"Yeah..  but I dont recall seeing (maybe ive just missed it) any point where he actually stated that he did in fact take the deal.. accept the contract, and make the money.

Thus far i've personally only seen eluding that if he takes it, he could have retired the parents..  

Like I said..  I dont know tha the took or didnt take any such deal..  but Keem is unable to offer much to anyone in the way of internet gigs.. and what he can offer.. are either things that grade could get himself (advert gigs) and stream contracts..  which grade already has a better deal in that front. 

I dont know this as factual.  But I am almost 100% sure that the offer Keem gave him was a streaming contract on stream.me...  a shittastic site.. where you go after you have been baned off all the good streaming sites.     If you check it out, they have like 6 streamers, and a total of 12 viewers..    unless keem is streaming.. then all his vile fans and haters show up..   so the site explodes in viewer numbers. 

I have seen in video,  keem offering a ""streaming contract"" to Bashur ..  for an undisclosed amount of money,  to which Basur acted surprised. (tho I do not think he accepted)   I would be willing to bet that is the same offer that he presented to Grade.   

At the end of the day, grade is partnered with Twitch, he has a contract there, and makes good money there.. likely much more than he could make through the stream.me contract.  Its all really just speculation on my part.   but until I see grade say otherwise,  I have to assume this is the offer that was made, and I have to assume that grade turned it down.  as would anyone with 1/4 of a functional brain :P

But I'm gonna need more details on that contract.. because I know of only 3 deals that are within keemstars ability to offer. And 2 of which are advert related... I've not seen grade plugging product/services... that eliminates 2. And the third would be facilitation of a streaming contract on stream.me.. which we know he didn't take. . Because he streams on twitch.. he's partnered on twitch.  Which means streaming on stream.me would breach the twitch contact. .. and to be perfectly fair. . between paetreon... twitch and youtube ad rev.

This video does seem to have alienated his existing fans enough that if he did convert over to a leafy clone.. I dont think there would be all that much surprise :P

116,"I know a bit about satire..  :P     there is a grey area between harassment, and satirically joking someone.. and Leafy likes to think that he exist in that grey area.. but he does not..   I dont know how many times I have said this now.. 

But there is a MASSIVE difference between a random nobody picking on someone...  
and a person with 2 million zealous fans whom are all eager, willing and ready to ruin someones life, picking on someone..  Leafy says he does not urge his fans, or take responsibility for their actions.. but I frankly dont give a shit what he takes responsibility for.. he knows that when he says something, they respond,  therefor it is his responsibility to mind what he says..  he is NOT satire.. he IS A piece of shit that profits off the misery of others.  

That out of the way, Grade is not a leafy clone.. im not saying that he is..  im saying that this last video amounted to little more than a poorly animated leafy style video.  

I love Battlestar Galactica   I started watching the show because it was a series I enjoyed to watch..  if they stopped mid season and turned it in to a reality show.. I would have said ""Nah.. fuck this"" and went to find another show...  that is not me destroying the show...  thats the show destroying the show that I love..   If I move on to a new content creator its not my fault.. its not youtubes fault.. its Grades fault..  he chose to make the video that has started this shit show..  its not the viewers.. it was Grade.. 

At the end of the day,, Grade has simply gotten to big for his britches..  His fame I think has managed to go to his head ..  maybe he was just swept up in the attention and has yet to figure out a reasonable way to react to it..  what ever the case may be,  his current actions are clearly wrong :P ",2016-05-03 23:53:49+00:00,d2rqgeo,3.0,t1_d2rpgpc,1424.0,GradeAUnderA

What people are trying to express here, is that he developed this following due to his videos that did not amount to poorly animated leafy style harassment videos..   if that is the path that he wants to take, that is perfectly fine.. but the moment you have 2 million fans.. you kinda have an obligation to those fans..  to produce the content that they came to love..  if you decide to change against the will of the fan base, then its not the fans destroying the channel.. its the creator.

120,"Upvoted as well..    And Kool's response also...    I dont agree with a single thing ya said Parry...   But its refreshing to see someone think about their comments..  before splooging out a wad of random nonsense :P  

at the end of the day Grade is not above drama.. as noted by the fact that he has .. what..9?  youtuber drama based videos?   something like that...  I listed them in my video... 

He is not above drama.. he is not avoiding the leafy/h3h3 mess..   he was unable to add to it because he is friends with leafy..  and his friendship would be damaged if he took one path,   and his sub base would be damaged if he took the other.. 

The same reason he accuses people like pewdiepie Mark.. and so on,  of fanning the drama flames.  when in reality its keemstar... its ALL fucking keemstar..  but Grade cant say that... cause Keem and him are buddies..      

I actually think i broke it down pretty well in my video.. and i went out of my way to avoid talking about how he relentlessly bashed Markiplier for no real reason..   

Every moment that I sit here, and think about it, I think of one more thing I could add to my video .. that would cast a bad light on Grade..  I could make a part two.. that would be totally honest..      It would get me a lotta hate..  and I dont really need that.. a small channel like mine could be suicide to talk about large youtubers.. 

But there is plenty info available to call grade out on his nonsense..   I likely wont,..  But I want to soo badly :P

124,"That proves nothing..   the vast majority of the time, all videos get more likes than dislikes.. often people habitually like the video for the sake of interaction..  sometimes peopple dislike a video and click away, to another video..  I personally VERY rarely use the like/dislike function..   and only in the most extreme cases will I like it..  and I have never disliked a video..  so you can not use that as a realistic standard..  

Also consider that all the Grade Fanboys will like it regardless..  and the random people that drift in and have never heard of grade, or the drama, will likely just drift right back away..   never intracting with the video at all..   200k likes means nothing more than at least 200k people being willing to interact with a video..
