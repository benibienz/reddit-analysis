I have an Asus Zenbook UX305 (touchscreen) running Windows 10, and was wondering if there was any way to go to a previous page on an internet tab using something like the ""3-finger swipe"" on a Macbook trackpad. Not sure if there's just a setting that I'm not seeing, an add-on that I don't have, or it's just not possible.
