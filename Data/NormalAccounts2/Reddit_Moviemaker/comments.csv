4,"&gt; I can spend my evening reading a book, watching tv or by gaming. I don't understand why the former 2 are perfectly fine but somehow gaming is problematic. It used to be that books were considered problematic, completely absorbing the youth and I'd be willing to wager that in 50 years it's going to be something else

Do you really think any of these sentences are true:

- there are or have been comparable amount of young people who have spent close to 100% of their time by reading newspapers and/or books, affecting their social life and keeping them inside, sometimes malnourished 

- people have died of exhaustion because they read too much or watched tv too much non-stop

- depression starts always with something else, it doesn't start or get worse because someone plays close to 100% of his time video games; video games are in this sense totally different from e.g. alcohol or drugs

Of course gaming is in some sense ""ordinary medium"". But it is just the one that has the greatest hook of all to keep some people using ALL their time with it, they barely go to bathroom. There are lots of people who even recognise that they have addiction, you can find them in reddit too. And google can give you thousands of links to stories like in this site http://www.video-game-addiction.org/stories-of-addiction.html

EDIT: I'm not saying that you have a problem. You seem to be thinking that somehow everyone thinks video games are worse than e.g. tv. That is not the point! There are people who are not like you, to whom the games are a big problem and there really isn't good help available yet.",2016-11-17 02:22:44+00:00,da3nx4n,8.0,t1_da32f5e,27894.0,Showerthoughts

142,"In many areas of work, the incentives for individual achievement are not dependent on money (as long as it is ""decent"", which varies greatly between one brain and another). Many of the greatest scientists for example do not care about money, they care about the possibilities for doing science (this is different from salary). 

As we are approaching times where standard work can more and more be done by machines and basic things like food and shelter are plenty if processes work, I argue that the overall productivity of a nation can be better, when people do not have to worry about these basic things. In some places, it is not ""the government"" that takes care of you if you fall (to illness or whatever), it is your relatives, neighbors and community in general. The difference between that kind of place and the village or country next to it where someone instead of helping you steals your last blanket is staggering.

Now, what does this have to do with any political decisions about social networks etc.? We have to look at what makes those places different and start from those viewpoints. It isn't always about money and ""there not being enough of it"" (it is paper and bits, you know?). It is about incentives, but especially how people see its fairness and each other as competitors OR partners.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/29/usa.iraq

9/11 was used for rationale of a war with a country that had nothing to do with 9/11. 

By written plans I mean agenda set for ""New American Century"", 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century

Written before the September 11 attacks, and during political debates of the War in Iraq, a section of Rebuilding America's Defenses entitled ""Creating Tomorrow's Dominant Force"" became the subject of considerable controversy. The passage suggested that the transformation of American armed forces through ""new technologies and operational concepts"" was likely to be a long one, ""absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.""[45] Journalist John Pilger pointed to this passage when he argued that Bush administration had used the events of September 11 as an opportunity to capitalize on long-desired plans.[48]

Some critics went further, asserting that Rebuilding America's Defenses should be viewed as a program for global American hegemony. Writing in Der Spiegel in 2003, Jochen Bölsche claimed that Rebuilding America's Defenses ""had been developed by PNAC for Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz and Libby,"" and was ""devoted to matters of 'maintaining US pre-eminence, thwarting rival powers and shaping the global security system according to US interests.'""[42][49] British MP Michael Meacher made similar allegations in 2003, stating that Rebuilding America's Defences was ""a blueprint for the creation of a global Pax Americana,"" which had been ""drawn up for"" key members of the Bush administration.[50] Academic Peter Dale Scott subsequently wrote

“[PNAC’s] ideology was summarized in a major position paper, Rebuilding America’s Defenses, in 2000. This document advocated a global Pax Americana unrestrained by international law…”[51]

Does this mean that this cabal (you can use word ""think-thank"" if you want to, but they got real power, so cabal is a better word imho) carried out 9/11 or let it happen? No. But they did use 9/11 to further their agenda which everyone actually following them should have understood easily.

388,"From the article that was linked:

""One researcher who only used fine touch to measure penile sensitivity claimed the foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis, so removing it via circumcision is detrimental to men's sex lives,"" Jenn Bossio, a doctoral student at Queen's University, said in a press release. ""Many anti-circumcision activists believe this is true, but we didn't find sufficient evidence to support this. We found that while the foreskin was more sensitive to fine touch, it was not more sensitive to the other stimuli we used, and those stimuli are likely more important in sexual pleasure.""

I claim they were not even looking for evidence to measure penile sensitivity, especially when it is used for sex or masturbation. I claim that the whole word ""likely"" is drawn out of someone's derrière in text above. 

EDIT: this is not the only criticism I have against the research, but it seems to me be an example of quite long tradition/history of trying to find reasons for the operation or proves that ""it doesn't do harm"", check e.g. https://matthewtontonoz.com/2015/01/05/why-is-circumcision-so-popular-in-america/

If we change the text this way: ""it seems that this operation might reduce fine touch sensitivity in &lt;select any part of vagina&gt;, but we think that it is likely that is not important in sexual pleasure"", then it is kind of easy to see that perhaps the methods could be better in actually measuring ""sexual pleasure"" somehow..",2016-04-15 12:09:52+00:00,d23vlv9,8.0,t1_d23sl25,9651.0,science

434,"I like low carb  Mediterranean diets especially because they:

1) do not leave you hungry; there is no sugar conditioning problem (after couple of days without everything tastes sweet differently), but additionally e.g. eating fish fat gives you way of eating less without feeling hungry

2) you will balance your eating in the long run because of this: just keep ""good"" food always available and avoid having ""bad"" food to quickly grab and it is much easier than to calculate your calories every meal

3) it is healthy by all research (unless you go to extreme with too low carbs)

It is much much easier for me to keep diet like this than to eat ""smaller portions"". I believe many other people feel the same. The psychology of being able to follow some diet is underestimated when talking about weight loss still. If most of people fail because they lack ""will power"", then you can claim that the particular way of dieting fails - unless you find some way to change the psychology of hunger &amp; habits for all of those people, which actually should also be focus here. Talking about physics might of course be a good part of that.

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3u85x1/i_gave_the_order_myself_turkish_pm_on_downing/cxczh2e

People need to realize the real situation here.

The assholes in charge of Turkey are supporting some assholes in Syria. The assholes in charge of Russia are supporting different assholes in Syria.

The western world can't find anyone to support in Syria who isn't an asshole, except possibly the Kurds. Except that the US doesn't want to support the Kurds too much because it would piss off the assholes in charge of Turkey. Even though the Turks are assholes, they used to not be assholes and the US kind of wants them to not be assholes again. So the US doesn't want to be assholes to Turkey, even though it means kind of being assholes to the Kurds.

So when some other assholes in Syria (who everyone agrees are assholes) attacked the French, the Russians decided to use it as an excuse to bomb some of the assholes in Syria that they don't like, and they figured no one would really pay much attention to whether or not the assholes they bombed were actually the assholes who attacked the French. And the western governments pretty much decided to just not make a fuss about specifically which assholes the Russians bombed, since they are all assholes.

Except that the Turks were pissed that the Russians were bombing their assholes. So they decided to be assholes and kill the assholes who were killing their assholes.

Meanwhile, the Syrian people are stuck in the middle. Surrounded by assholes on all sides, with pretty much no hope of anyone who isn't an asshole coming to help them.",2016-03-15 05:57:28+00:00,d10c83f,7.0,t1_d0zyk3c,24037.0,worldnews

But I leave a small room for possibility that there are ways to lessen symptoms and homeopathy might have sometimes almost by accident given some relief in some situations like that.

But if you take a look into those countries which have the highest social security at the moment, it seems that population starts to control itself once they do not have to worry about there being someone to take care after them when they get old. However, it is of course hard to predict how long this would take and since it is also value based (how people in said society are thinking) is not ""a law of nature"".

2) There are reasons to believe that when people do not have to stress any more about basic stuff like accommodation and food etc., they can be even more productive than before. But since this is also largely value based thing, I conclude that..

3) It is all about values. On average, groups of people that value helping each other have good life, others not so easily. This is easy to understand. Unfortunately we currently still have strong tendencies to forget this basic fact and argue otherwise.

787,"Uh, there is nothing in capitalism that would be against nationalism. Or do you really think that either of those is in any way against each other in e.g. USA? 

Let's make example of media corporations. Capitalism directs them to sell ""news"" to their target groups. While capitalism is great for providing better products in most areas, information / ""News"" becomes more and more a product where accuracy is not important - emotions are. This is because feelings sell, not facts. Everything turns to wrestling match, and in order to be able to further refine the product, all limitations (like penalties for telling untruths when providing ""news"") must be abolished. Now, this has already been done in USA. Because our instinct for matches between two groups of people we are very vulnerable to this kind of marketing- and do not think that they would not know what they are doing - they know exactly what they are doing.

If you mean that capitalism helps to make ""borders lower around the world"", there is some truth to that. However, things change and one word ""capitalism"" doesn't mean any more the same that it was couple of decades ago in the world where over half of the planet's population are replaceable by machines - nobody needs them, that is nobody, who has any capital.

1) People in e.g. Turkey or Russia do not think that, but they are heading to that direction. Do majority of people in those countries believe that? No. And that is the main reason why it is possible to happen.

2) I challenge you to find same kind of marks of police state / fascism from any western European country as US currently has: police unaccountability, brutality, elite getting lighter penalties, whistle-blowers threatened, for-profit prisons, police getting money without court orders from citizens, patriot act etc. The country is already on the slippery slope. 

3) Information technology makes everything easier to manage in centralized way, and there already is a system in place that can do really much without accountability, also against law, if their spirit gets corrupted.  Just declare anyone enemy of state (use other words, but the meaning is the same) - there is history for that and not from so long ago.

It is truly not intelligent at all take ones rights for granted and think that history always automatically somehow goes to ""better direction"". It does not. All the marks are in place, couple of attacks more ""against freedom"" and USGestapo might be in operation.

1) This thinking is wrong because ""conspiracy"" doesn't need to be anything huge (involving really many people) and overly complicated, and still it can affect really many people's lives. Couple of top-level people who understand how to manipulate different currencies' values via financial tools that only few even have good understanding about would be good example. So could actually be using remote-controlled aircraft to hit some buildings too, it could probably be achieved by &lt;10 people in right positions. Not saying anything like that has ever happened, but how would we really know?

2) It doesn't matter if one (or even many) people tell something in many cases. For example: one would think that stealing thousands of babies would be impossible wihtout someone going to jail, common sense says so, right? Still it happened in Spain - and not some hundred year ago. Where there is ""culture of silence"", ""whistle-blowers"" (or in that case victims) voices can be silenced.

- fighting will be streamed as live, however most media will be scripted around ""happenings"" like ""saving some guy named Ryan"" etc.

- people streaming something that is not scripted are ""on enemy's side"", they do not support the father's land (cough, military industrial complex, cough)

As far as I understand, most of them think that no quantum effects are needed for explaining consciousness. Messaging between different parts of the brain via synapses is enough. This leads easily to questions like ""what are the differences between different messaging systems?"". If one assumes that the _form_ (patterns) somehow is the important thing (""magical difference"" I will call it), then there is no difference between e.g. if the messages are electrical or something else. This leads to things like people changing notes on paper or traffic patters might form a ""conscious thought"" (location of which is a good question, you might note).

If the signal makes ""the magical difference"", e.g. requiring electricity, then that is also interesting: why would it be?

If it is the combination of both, then I don't see how it would be any less ""magical"".

My apologies for using the work ""magical"" so much, but I'm trying to make the point that ""hard problem"" is really, well, hard.
