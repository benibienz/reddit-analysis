5,"for #2 look for motivations other than the standard/automatic adventuring stuff- (money, power, magic, influence, destruction of evil, protecting family/friends) Things like meeting or being considered equals to major NPCs, a chance to prove that my forgotten lineage is worthy of it's grand name, the mysteries of a secret ritual that brought forth the warforged, true origins of the spellplague, etc. If your strong personalities have delved deep into what their character thinks/feels they'll already have this figured out. If not- throw some stuff at them, and see what they pick up or run with to find their own motivation. 

#3 NPCs (even family) that the players don't interact with regularly tend to just seem like Macguffins. If you have an NPC the whole party likes- and deals with regluarly enough to serve as a reminder (like the saucy wench at the tavern who always flirts with them or something)... Maim her. Torture her, motivate the players with something they're already attached to. 

The sun however seems like a grand idea. Make it increasingly hard for the players to work in the constantly dark conditions- food becomes vastly more expensive, far more monsters are about (random encounter rate going up) remember they can't see that the sun is constantly down, you have to make them imagine what it would be like living in a world without a sun.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQsJSqn71Fw

Once you know what kinda players you have, you can more easily grab their attention with what they're interested in- combat, lore, roleplay, treasure, etc. 

Really everyone sucks at DM their first time, you have to find YOUR flow, some require tons of prep, others can wing it like a champ and nobody is the wiser. I personally tend to run a bit dungeon crawly because I'm a very mechanics and balance focused person. My combats are interesting and varied, but my NPCs come off bland and cliche. 

I have to do lots of prep work for NPCs and personalities when I want a roleplay heavy game, even going so far as to do mock interviews with the NPCs to try to have answers ready to common questions the players may have. ",2016-09-14 07:39:09+00:00,d7m583q,1.0,t3_50lbr4,1137135.0,mattcolville
9,"1) Identify your strong personalities- These are the players that drive things, sounds like you have a few, and they are in conflict. 

2) Get those  players to give you their character motivations. this not only gives you information about what drives their characters (and thus can manipulate them with) but also makes them actually think about their characters as more than a collection of stats (very common issue with new players) 

3) Common threat/situation- give them a reason to stick together without forcing them together the pirates in the first pirates of the carribean movie could have all broken up and searched for the gold on their own, but it was easier and more efficient for them to do so together, even if they didn't like each other. Matt's suggestion of making a big bad force them into submission not only gives them direction from the big bad, but also gives them the goal of taking him out when they attain enough power/magic.

If multiple players are talking over each other or want to do things each ""first"" have them roll initiative. 

If you can nudge players into ""roles"" in the group by encouraging roleplay or backgrounds affecting information, the group should organize itself pretty well you know they're doing a good job when your talky players start asking the quiet ones if they can come check out some writing or clue for a non-mechanical reason.

11,"4 hours for 6 enemies? 

Combined with that you're talking an egg timer for your players sounds like you have people that aren't planning out their turns before it's actually their turn. 

This is very important, and why I generally have a no phones at the table rule during combat. 

Uppy's suggestion is for combats that AC of the enemies is too high, slowly increasing everyone's to hit making combat go faster in later rounds, for good or ill. 

so to really help please answer these questions: 

* How long was the average turn from the players
* How many initiative scores did you assign to monsters
* How long was the average turn for the monsters
* Did every player have something that could do damage &gt;50% of the time? (i.e. only had to roll a 10+ to hit or enemy roll a 10 or less to not save) 

A players average turn should get shorter and shorter as time goes on, they use up abilities, have less new information to gather/consider, and get focused in on whats going on. 

The monsters can do other things, but if they appear to be losing, send 1-2 off to get reinforcements (which don't arrive as they decide to barricade themselves, or arrive too late) That can help speed up a combat that is dragging on, and let you make modifications as needed for the next one. 

If the players and monsters have a really hard time hitting each other, it can get rather tedious. Remind players of other options they have- shove things out a window, assist each other to get advantage, other various things to mix up the combat and give them some other way to handle things if they can't normally just beat something to death.

For example- I ran with a group that I was getting frustrated that they were grabbing every weapon off every dead thing and trying to sell it in town.

I was making an adventure in a wizards tower and didn't want it slowed down by looting random objects, so the goblins around the tower and in the lower levels had no weapons, instead the wizard had alchemically modified them to have 'natural' weapons. Arm bones flattened and widened to make fleshy shields, hands with fingers fused together to form knives, clubs and axes. My players loved it.

I would describe it to him (if he told you the plan before) that you don't switch from ant to elephant and then grow- the magic needs enough space to create the form before it solidifies. At best- he could revert to his natural form (humanoid), but then his body would be put under the same pressure as the monster, and an equal amount of damage would be done to both. (same damage because mid form change, the body would be highly vulnerable, a moment so short enemies can't take advantage of it normally, but as he is changing inside another body...)

I personally am all for innovative uses of player skills, but there must be some component to it that can't be used a lot or has some disadvantage.

395,"read the article- skills have been rolled into the perk system. 

70 perks, things like lockpick, science, hacking, etc are now perks with multiple ranks. No more ""you leveled, assign X skill points"" 

Perks are now not level dependent, but SPECIAL stat set- so to hack AT ALL you must have int 3+ 

This is a far better system, it decreases the near mandatory nature of INT in FO3/NV; and if SPECIAL stat increases are limited, creates more varied characters. ",2015-07-27 22:35:19+00:00,ctib3b4,3.0,t1_cti86os,4573.0,fo4

397,"If you're going for a ""feel"" of light weapons/armor, likely better just to have weapons to have variance on speed modifiers- i.e. 

* vault suit/naked/normal clothes- 100% speed
* combat armors- 90% speed
* heavy non-power armors- 80% speed
* power armors- 85% speed

Then have weapons slow you down by a % which is modified by your STR. 

for example: 

* 10mm pistol 10%-STR so with str 7 you are slowed 3%
* Mini gun- 40%-2x str so with str 7 it's 23% reduction. 

extremely rough numbers of course, but this would encourage lighter armored characters to maintain light weapons to keep their speed bonuses and heavy armored characters to use the heavy weapons ",2015-07-27 20:33:44+00:00,cti6d4u,3.0,t1_cti5mx9,1060.0,fo4

* demon's souls- equip and item limit

given- movement speed and dodging ability is far more important in the souls' series, but all the more reason not to do anything other than a hard cap in fallout- it's much more about player convenience than power.

It's not realistic to have an ""all or nothing"" system, but look at say Dark Souls. It's not even carrying but equipment capacity. The more you equip the slower you move, however the players essentially see the first reduction in speed as a hard cap. 

I think the general player base would be upset by speed reductions in a game with limited speed increasing abilities and a large world to explore. 

Many other games don't allow you to pick up new items if you are already at your limit.

Rebuilding the wasteland is something the vault dweller did between fallout 1 and 2, now we just get to play it. 

Power armor being more like it is in lore makes me feel better and more respectful of the factions like enclave and the BoS. 

Improved gunplay only serves to make the game more immersive, a character bad at guns should have more sway in their sights, not have the gun fire off in a seemingly random direction. ",2015-07-08 23:09:12+00:00,cswrwyr,1.0,t3_3cldlq,9602.0,fo4

that means he only has to go to 400 houses to confirm all the information. He's also only confirming information, not selling them anything. 

So lets say with a well planned route he's averaging 5 min from house to house with a 10 min conversation confirming information. (shortened for gameplay)

4 houses an hour, 8 hours a day. Even with as low as a 50% answer rate (requiring him to go back another time) Thats 16 houses a day x 2.5 people = 40 people confirmed a day. That means in ~ month an a half he's confirmed everyone in the vault.

* E: measuring pain endurance has always been tricky, as for endurance of long periods of physical activity, could be long distance running but that negates tough but not built to run
* C: Insanely hard to judge, essentially you would have to go off what others think of you, as that is the primary use in games.
