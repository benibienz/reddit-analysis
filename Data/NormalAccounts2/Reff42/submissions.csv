I woke up late for my own graduation from the Protectorate academy. I know now it was for the best. I didn't think a Novakid like me would have passed. I walk to the assembly to find it underway, the speech interrupted by a tentacle, wrapping itself around her. 

Dear god. 

She yelled at me to grab the matter manipulator before she was drug underground by the beast. I dutifly grab it and run for my life. I grab some old broadsword and hack down a tentacle in my way, and manage to make it to a ship.... a train ship? Oh well, it flew and it got me out. 

S.A.I.L. onboard was wrecked by the exit, and I rebooted it. I'm orbiting some garden type planet, and need supplies from it. I beam down, only to find a ruin nearby. I make base before nightfall, to see the natural fauna gets a little... uppity. By morning S.A.I.L. contacts me, and says there is a power source nearby.... Help? Other survivors? I gather what I can and head in the direction it tells me to. 

A day and a night pass as I grab a few surface ores and plants. I may be here a while and should stock up. Some ancient gate was the source of the power, but it seems it's not fully powered. A voice comes over the terminal- saying that I can power it up with ""core shards"". Whatever that is. 

The planetoid didn't seem that big on my scanners so I decide I'll take the long way round. It only gets weirder. A normal lightly forested area comes into a clearing of bright flowers, and a pond of water that was off color and was relaxing to be in. Again; ruins- pillars were there. What was this place? 

I climb a cliff with some rope I fashioned out of vines and find people! 3 men clad in purple robes. Were they the people that made these ruins? ",starbound,Starry the Kid Log 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/4u6giz/starry_the_kid_log_1/

http://imgur.com/r/PS4/StTcJAU

So going over the weapon stats and such I did notice a very significant missing piece- no durability. While we have no confirmation on if weapon repairs will be returning (they were only added in FO3 and stayed in NV) it's looking like there will be no weapon degredation over time. 

Alternatively there could be random breakage of mods on weapons, like the muzzle breaking and having to be removed until you can create a new one, or the stock breaking and making it a pistol grip. 

This could be a part of Bethesda trying to remove ""must have"" skills/perks/stats. Repair was so useful it was almost hard not pump it at some point. 

What are your thoughts on weapon repair's possible removal? Good? Bad? Personally I thought it was a great way of allowing us to loot everything but not having as much ""clutter"" and forcing us to change weapons when one was getting worn down.
