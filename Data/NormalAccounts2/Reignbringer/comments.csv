1. No
2. no idea
3. bad on prince
4. I felt engaged on every turn, the way city states are handled feels far more fair and realistic( as to just spamming gold), I liked the movement, though not everyone will, using trade routs for building roads has it's perks, expendable builders (better than just setting to auto), building military vs buildings feels more balanced (not always spammed with 20 critical buildings) Sean Bean narrating, combat feels more fair( if you're an rifle infantry unit fighting a swordsman you'll destroy them in one hit taking one damage in return), the look of the map, resources distribution (1 of a resource handles 4 cities, 2 handles unlimited {I think}}, diplomacy is more transparent, water is important now, turn to turn is generally more interesting, and a whole lotta shit I'm sure i""m missing.
5. See above
6. can skip Sean Bean narrating during a reload.  Can't mute without skipping the screen where you can read the context.  AI still feels dumb (again, only on prince).  Scouts feel useless ( they get minimal movement bonuses without promotions, which only happen through combat which they are shit at...) The vast majority of the map  feels Sepia through most of the game due to the art style, building cities requires micro management because of the districts system....Some of 4 and 6 are pure preference of course...  
ETC.  The game didn't slow (in pace or performance [4820k@4.5 and stock gtx 1080 +ssd])down in the late game, other than due to the difficulty.  I was pressed in mid game by religious pressure, though it was mitigated by a war that I didn't start.  So far the game is fun, but not without flaws. I've been feeling the itch for way too long so i bought it at release, and i don't regret it, but if you can wait it objectively demands a price closer to a 40$ price point...

170,"I've gathered from your post that your girlfriend is roughly 15 and I'll assume you're about the same age.  It's great that you are looking out for her best interests but please understand that you don't yet have the skills to get her through the trauma she's faced.  She has likely faced far more than she is willing to share with you. If her brother sexually abused her at when he was 13, he was also likely abused  (by her parents or another close relative) at a young  age. This, coupled with his early drug habit, is indicative of systemic issues in the home.  Having multiple sexual partners by 15 may seem fine and ""sexually healthy"" but in this case it doesn't seem to be.   A woman in control of her sexuality is great.   But a child useing sex can be devastating.  (Child in hormonal/ physical sence) More than likely her past traumas are dictating her behavior.   Be supportive where you can, be a positive male model in her life, but realize that it isn't  your job (or within your capacity) to ""fix"" her.  Try to get her to seek professional help through the school  (not family) and stay supportive  (not controlling )  good luck.

182,"I hope this comment is received as supportive because  I want the best for you and you seemed to ask for what he's thinking.  As a happily married guy (8years, no kids) your comment threw a few red flags that lead me to think there are things to work on for both of you. I know this probably isn't as supportive as a typical xxchrome post is, but it is a very honest male opinion which op asked for (third party opinion). 

&gt;I've been seeing him constantly follow porn stars and nude models on social media, likes photos of his 'girl friends' but doesn't do anything with my posts.  

His behavior here is potentially dangerous but the devil is in the details.  If these are celebrities that he has no real interactions with, I would say it's somewhat innocent, though definitely a signal that he is careless with your feelings.   That being said, you seem to be very jealous which can be suffocating for men.  

&gt;Then yesterday I discovered by accident that he's still downloading adult videos, goes on an japanese nude model database website, has 10 gigabites worth of naked pictures of women and porn videos.


 He saves them on his PC in hidden folders.

This wasn't an accident.   You purposely invaded am area he thought was safe got mad at him for what you found there.  If you had a journal where you shared your deepest sexuality fantasies, would you want him reading it? 

 Why hide it? 

-I am deeply hurt by what I saw and enraged and insecure and offended that all of the talking that I really didn't mean anything to him.-

That is why.  99.999999% of guys look at porn and if you ask them about it only one of two things will happen.  He will lie to you, or you will here a truth that will hurt you.  So don't ask the question unless you can handle the answer.   

 That he wasn't acknowledging my feelings the first time we, or I rather, talked because he knew he was still gonna do it. He couldn't admit that there was something wrong in what he was doing, not even a little bit.

This is actually kinda a good sign depending on how you look at it.  I means he wasn't willing to lie to you even though it would have been easier.   I can not stress this enough,  nearly all men look at porn and masterbate.   I feel a tad guilty when I look at porn, but my wife and I have different sex drives and it help alleviate the testosterone build up and the symptoms that come with it (anger, linear thinking, and most importantly a wandering eye when I'm around real women). 

 It's also important to differentiate between a desire (I.e. I want to have sex with that woman) and a fantasy (i.e. watching bondage/domination is something I have no desire to try, but it still turns me on to watch some of it). 

&gt;He lashed out and tried to reverse the issue by bringing up issues that dont even have to do with his girl stash. I told him before that he should just be honest with me but he chose to kept mum about it then this is what I see. I am neing irrational here?

Yes,  you are being the definition of irrational here.  Basically,  you're saying ""just be honest and tell me a lie. "" ie, be honest and tell me you don't watch/won't watch porn.

&gt;He told me he's been doing it even before we were married and dismisses my feelings. Is that an acceptable reason? 
No, but im not sure a reason could exist that would stop him.  Personally, i think it sounds like an unreasonable request and dangerously close to an ultimatum.

Shouldn't there be a compromise between husband and wife?

Yes, but it doesn't sound like compromise to me.  Compromise, to me would be, no following/flirting with girls on social media because it's too real and the line is too easy to cross.  But what he does to masterbate privately should be up to him.  Sounds like you just want him to stop everything.  

 Should I just resign to the fact that he will never change and I will never be physically good enough for him?

These are two VERY different questions and two entwine them will only hurt you.  I love my wife and find her incredibly sexy and beautiful.  A separate and unrelated fact is, I watch porn to masterbate.   

Should he change? Yes. Should you change? Yes.  People change together slowly over time,  but you're asking him to change his sexuality and the way he's masterbated since he was 10 years old.  It's kinda a big ask.

&gt;Also, he doesn't want to touch me or have sex while I'm pregnant and this makes me feel worse, ten and a hundredfold.

This has to suck and I'm very sorry.  I sounds like you are making some effort here and are being rebuffed.  My wife and I had issues with this for a long time (she's was a once every other month or so kinda woman) and I would feel rejected 4-5 times a week.  The feeling sucks.  We eventually worked through it with open and honest communication.  (And a lot of porn)


&gt;He also mentioned outright that he doesn't want to talk to me even when he sees I'm not okay. Even when he noticed I was quietly crying in bed the whole day. I am beginning to think that my marriage will just be a black hole and I'm trapped with a man in relationship who thinks that having conversations is pointless. 

Not a doctor (obviously), but this sounds like you are having some very real depression symptoms and your husband isn't equipped to deal with them.  You need to talk to your gyno to see if it's pregnancy related and get a referral to see a professional.  Again, my wife and I have been through similar stages and I always felt like no matter what I did, it didn't help.  I felt like talking only made it worse because my answers were not the ones she wanted.  With some life/professional changes she's crawled out of the hole.  

Should I just give him that? What do I do now if the man I married doesn't even want to talk about problems forever?

I'll end with two things that have helped immensely with my roller coaster of a marrage.  

1.  Arguments feel like a downward spiral and in a sense they take on their own momentum.  You have to find a way to break the cycle, get out of focusing on the negative.   Go on a trip.  A date. A new sex act, gifts. Whatever gives you something to focus on that's based in love instead of fear and jealousy.  

2. ""Bottom line is, couples who are truly right for each other wade through the same crap as everybody else, but the big difference is they don't let it take them down. One of those two people will stand up and fight for that relationship every time if it's right and they're real lucky. One of them will say something.""-Dr. Cox (Scrubs)

~Trying to think outside the confines of our reality is very difficult, but it they way i think about it is that our creator simply created the singularity which had a bunch of data (mass) and rules (physics)  As the Data started to follow the rules of the simulation the big bang occurred and all of the universe started to unravel and organize itself according to the rules of the programming. Given the infinite size of our universe there were bound to be places where our version of life took hold.  And we did, because the rules and intial state allowed for it. The creator may or may not  have intended for us to be an outcome of the simulation.
1. We still can't figure how our brains works to a large degree, what happens after death, how to create life, etc. So how are we supposed to create a simulation that by itself produces self-aware people as intelligent as their creators, or us?
~Try not to be limited by our understanding as it exists today.  The supposition only requires that it is POSSIBLE to create this tech at some point in the future, 10 years from now, or 100000 years from now.  
~There have been a couple of people that have brought up the issue of degradation through iteration as you go further down the rabbit hole and it is an issue.  But this only affects the degree of the exponent, but it does not preclude the conclusion of the thought experiment.  ",2015-10-30 03:27:15+00:00,cwi02w1,3.0,t1_cwhv6by,8373.0,philosophy
213,"You've definitely brought up some important points, however the only time I referred to ""god"" instead of ""God"" was in the TL:DR, and this was just because of the simplification of the argument truly does imply the existence of a god, not a God.  No super powers, no divine intent, no religious bs that goes with it. Just in the confines of the thought experiment, that it is far more likely that ""god"" exists than he/she/it does not.  Sorry of this is too semantic, but it is important to understand the difference.  I did use God a number of times in the implications section.  Perhaps god would be better, but what I'm implying is simply that this version of god would be compatible with their faith.  You are right in your statement that ""accepting the possibility of something because it cannot be entirely disproved, does not demand belief.""  What I've attempted to lay out here is a situation where it is MORE likely that a creator exists, than it is that a creator does not exist. I know i refer to this as a ""proof"" which it certainly is not.  However, the logic of the statements holds and it is still more likely we are in a created universe than a ""real"" universe.  I should say that I agree with most of your points but I think you're really quick to dismiss this as a ""really bad Hypothesis.""  G(g)od does ""muddy the waters"" but this is philosophy reddit, not science and not religion.  I felt it belonged here because this really is not a religious argument.  And because it can't be tested, it's not science.  So here we are, in philosophy, where I find this logical reasoning to lead to a very interesting conclusion, a creator is more likely to exist, than not.

214,"This is an interesting point that i had really glossed over.  Self awareness (in the confines of the simulation) would seem to be a requirement for this to work.  But the ability to program it would not be.  It is possible who/whatever programmed this universe had no intention of creating self aware life.  Maybe they just created a great big compressed file (the singularity) and started using win-zip(the big bang) and as the file unpacked (the expansion of the universe) life (bugs) arose.

215,"What i am referring to is simply numbers.  You are right is saying it does not ""confirm the existence.""  In science there is a guiding philosophy; We are not special.  We used to think we were at the center of the universe cause it looked that way, but as we gained more knowledge we started to see that we were just one tiny unimportant spec among trillions and trillions of stars.

219,"As to point Re (3 and 4), when conducting this thought experiment, it is easy to draw conclusions from our reality that is surrounding us. But, as difficult as it is to do, making assumptions that simulations closer to actual reality are some how bound to realities in this universe is false.  That would be like saying when a computer programmer creates a game like ""Supermeat Boy"", that reality somehow represents ours.  Also keep in mind, using a computer simulation in particular is really just an analogy, we have no idea what tech could look like that would make this possible.",2015-10-30 01:52:44+00:00,cwhwubi,3.0,t1_cwhwjtc,472.0,philosophy
