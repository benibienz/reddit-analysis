I'm not at all familiar with what it takes to make a mod, but my experience using them tends to suggest the game itself dictates what is modable.  Is the Enemy AI potentially fixable by one of you wonderful moders out there so us mere mortals may bask in your AI's genius?

Cooler Master HAF 922 case


~~FX-8350 CPU~~ is still in the system but I'm assuming it's the burnt out component.

 I don't have any other DDR3 Ram handy to find out if that's the issue.
