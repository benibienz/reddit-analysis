Every time I've been in LP(A fair few I'll admit) its been for abandoning. Some times where shitty net or something coming up IRL and some where just me being done with the game. I'm not trying to say it shouldn't be punished, just slightly less so. Maybe a 3 game limit for abandons and 5 for reports.

I just played a game in which my winter wyvern's response to ""can you pull instead of csing?"" was to say have fun and just leave me. It seems to be a frequent theme recently. I know it wasnt the nicest way to request a pull but it certainly wasnt hard flame.
