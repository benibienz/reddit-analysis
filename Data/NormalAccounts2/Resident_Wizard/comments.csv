You will not see /r/nfl on /r/all because it has elected to not be shown to the masses.,2016-10-28 02:13:48+00:00,d9aw0r5,2.0,t1_d9avuoo,230.0,nfl

Wear BLM on your sneakers, get fined, and only talk about it during your press conferences, that'd bring the media into what you're all about.  Instead there's a controversy there that most people are discussing rather than the message it had intended on delivering.

I'm with the league on this one.  Why the hell should they ignore a report which had *some* outright credibility.

Maybe the report is wrong, maybe the guy was making it up to make himself look cool, but he definitely worked to make himself credible while secretly being filmed and produced results.

557,"For you I would agree.  You're making an informed decision.  

Now think from Apple's point of view on Bob, your neighbor who isn't very tech savvy but uses you to fix their iPad screen.  Now Bob's one simple home button isn't working.  Bob could have sent it to Apple to have it fixed because the issue was under warranty but it is no longer covered since he had you repair it.

Bob is going to be pissing and moaning to his family and those who will listen that Apple has a bad product and don't stand behind it.  Everyone who hears Bob isn't going to hear about Bob's choice to have his screen replaced by a non-Apple approved vendor.  Their brand name and recognition will be taken down a notch because they're charging Bob $200 to fix a button that failed.

You could also argue it adds cost for time to review the product, understand the issue, understand what caused the issue, and how to handle those who are improperly fixing your product.  This now means a store can advertise they fix Apple's products, but unless the question is specifically asked of the store the customer doesn't know they aren't an approved Apple vendor.  Thus adding to more frustration when they make a claim on something that should have been warrantable.

I think you know the decision you're making and the consequences of it.  That's not the case for most consumers out there.",2016-06-11 21:16:57+00:00,d45ahtd,6.0,t1_d4592xd,2309.0,technology

Add stability and your gun magically has higher DPS, but if you add accuracy instead of stability your DPS went up like 4 or 5K more and was completely unexplainable.  The guns didn't actually do any more damage, they just said they did for some unknown reason.

Then they tried all these different ""builds"" but the builds were pointless as there was only one or two which were even viable on their play style they developed.  You had to be capable of doing a good bit of damage to the bad guys because you had to unload a damn clip just to do some real damage in the end game content.  Playing a low DPS output character was completely out of the question as the skills you gained were negligible.  Sure there were builds that could help you run an instance easier, but it didn't translate into a fun build for the Dark Zone.

Bautista prevented a clean throw by instead of sliding into second base like normal, he slid late and through the base catching Odor with his leg and likely shoe spikes causing likely pain and an off target throw. 

That caused the altercation and subsequent punch.

980,"Here is the article, then it tells you to listen to him speak about it and gives a link:

Eddie George played football for Ohio State University. He won the Heisman trophy. He had a nine year NFL career with the Tennessee Titans, Houston Oilers and Dallas Cowboys. But when his football career ended unexpectedly, he had to find a way to re-invent himself.

“I mean you can use the term re-invent, I guess,” George says.  “Because I’ve gone from the football field to Broadway, from Broadway to Wall Street, so to speak. But that’s who I evolved into, and I spent a lot of time doing that. So that’s where I am today.”

George first started taking acting lessons as a way to improve his skills as a sports commentator. But he soon found that the two sets of skills don’t really have a lot in common. Instead, he discovered a love of the theater. His biggest role to date? Playing Billy Flynn in the musical, Chicago — on Broadway.

“I performed for seven weeks. I enjoyed every moment of it. You know, it’s like riding a roller coaster ride. Once I hear the music it’s like, ‘OK, here we go, it’s the uptick.’ You’re going up and you’re slowly going up. And then when I hit the stage it’s like I’m being shot out of a cannon. And before I know it, I’m off stage. It seems like seven weeks is a long time but it goes by so fast.”",2016-04-02 19:26:17+00:00,d1n9ndu,1.0,t3_4d14hg,29727.0,nfl

Lets look at Adrian Petersons 2000 yard season.  16 games, 348 attempts, 2097 rushing yards, 5.4 yards per attempt.  The stats are ridiculous.

Now, remove ONE of each longest run from each game, this totals 643 yards.  16 games, 332 attempts, 1454 yards, 4.4 yards per carry.

That's some great statistics for an every down back, but that takes away a whole yard per carry for the year.  And that's only removing one big play each game, where one game he had a long run of 6 yards.  Adrian's HOF year turns him into just another good running back.

Late-season Saturday games have been common since then, but Friday night games are still extremely rare; the league has played only eight Friday games since 1978, mostly because of the NFL's restrictions during Christmas.

2505,"There seem to be four rumors swirling due to this speculation being put out with a Browns story:

1. Johnny is going to be named week 1 starting QB shortly

2. Browns are cutting Terrance West

3. Browns are signing Ray Rice

4. Browns are trading for Kaepernick

I don't see how the first one is shaking the core of the franchise, as it seems to now be people are rooting for this to happen.  The second rumor may be plausible based on the stories that have been coming out.  The third rumor may have merit if the second happens.

French wings lead Chris Mortenson to have a malfunction in his head.  Mort reported Thomas had crushed a football with his thighs.  Thomas had thighs of thunder.  Before every game he would try to put the balls between his thighs and try and try to hatch a chicken.  Thomas wasn't very successful.

Thomas wasn't successful at hatching any football chickens as reported by Mort.  This made sheriff Roger Goodell angry.  The sheriff was a notorious hot and heavy chicken whisperer.
