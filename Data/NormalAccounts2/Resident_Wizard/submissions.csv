I'm fairly new to this working out thing and I'm also really trying to lose weight.  I know the losing weight is completely based on my diet, but exercising and lifting will make me healthier and help me build an overall better me.

However, I do have a life style that once a week or once every other week I will do a day or night of drinking.  I have noticed how much it has hindered my weight loss as my weight significantly jumps each morning after drinking.

When I calculate my calories from a day of drinking I can get into the high range of 4,000 or maybe even 5,000 calories (depending on how accurate MFP app is).  My weight will jump up usually 3 - 4 pounds when I weigh myself the next morning.  

I can typically get it down so that at my next weekly weigh in I have actually lost a pound or two or at worst stayed at the same weight.

I know the upcoming days from drinking my metabolism will be slightly sluggish, and I try to combat that by eating healthy.  But I don't understand the drastic shift in weight change.

I know my habit is hurting myself, and I need to make a change.  I'm working on changing myself piece by piece, but I'm also trying to understand it.
