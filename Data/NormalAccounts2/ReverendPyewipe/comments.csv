151,"My main character is a former delinquent who ran away from her mother and ass hole step father. She ended up getting caught breaking into a motor shop and the owner offered to put her up in return for helping out around the garage. This is where her love of cars and racing stemmed from. She started fixing bikes which lead to her becoming connected with the Warrior Nomads MC crew. She worked her way up through the ranks doing jobs here and there but her talent for criminal financial gain didn't go unnoticed. Crime bosses flocked to her to sort out ""problems"" and partake in situations her skills came in handy. The money came in quicker than she ever expected. Luxury apartments, super cars, yachts. She had everything she dreamed of back in her days of sleeping rough and stealing just to eat. The one thing she no longer had was the respect of her motorcycle crew. She became distanced by her new found glamorous lifestyle. It was time to make a change. These days she won't do heists for no amount of money. Instead she stands shoulder to shoulder with her brothers in arms against rival crews. The super cars are still there but are gathering dust as she rides her Hexer, sawn off close to hand. Trust is something that comes with actions. She will ride and fight until her crew remember that she is still the chick with the grease covered denims and a heart of a lion.

The Playstation is a more powerful machine so I'm told by people who claim to know these things, but the quality of graphics is not my main concern. Most importantly is my comfort, for want of a better word. I prefer the feel of the Xbox controller to its rival. Another aspect that was important to me was the ease of the dashboard on the 360. I expected more of the same on the One. After a week I still can't get to grips with it, so I feel I badly researched and assumed too much.",2015-12-13 01:23:33+00:00,cxx0nxh,1.0,t3_3wkdjv,13137,xbox
