6,"there was a really interesting comment at the source page by greenskeeper carl :

&gt; I agree, they'd approve. There was a big difference between pre revolutionary war founding fathers and post war. It only took them a couple years, and GW was putting down the whiskey rebellion (against new and higher taxes imposed by the federal government) with federal govt troops. Of course central bank enthusiast hamilton was along for the ride as well. 

&gt;Many of those farmers were soldiers in the war, and got a pretty tough lesson on what exactly it was they were fighting for. The alien and sedition acts were icing on the cake. It wasn't really the tyranny of king george many of them had a problem with, they just wanted to be in charge of it. The taxes most colonists had to pay to the new government were typically much higher than what was required by the british crown. Same with the rules and regulations. 

&gt;So, for all their talk of freedom and liberty, in truth the american colonies merely replaced the tyrant on the other side of the ocean with a whole gang of them here. Look how quickly it happened, too. They only made it a couple years before they were curtailing freedom of speech and press, banning certain things critical of the new government.

 &gt; Yes, they would most certainly approve.

33,"&gt; It’s true that they didn’t work much, not by American standards anyway. In the US, full-time salaried workers supposedly laboring 40 hours a week actually average 49, with almost 20 percent clocking more than 60. These people, on the other hand, **worked only about 37 hours** a week, when they weren’t away on **long paid vacations**. At the end of the work day, about four in the afternoon (perhaps three in the summer), **they had time to enjoy a hike in the forest or a swim with the kids or a beer with friends** — which helps explain why, unlike so many Americans, they are pleased with their jobs.

60 h work week means you spend about 40+ h of fixing (at really slow rate while adding news ones) mistakes you made when you passed the 35 hour mark in your previous week. 

After about 6 hours of actually working (not FB chatting) you become relatively useless. I know, you think it's not so and you are something special, but feel free to do some research and then think again. ",2016-02-07 17:58:27+00:00,czr81do,1,t3_44mli0,988,FreeEuropeNews
