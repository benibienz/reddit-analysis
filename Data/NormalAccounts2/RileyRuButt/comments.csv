My comment stands strong they want you for sex. Do your work go home hang out with friends from school, ask M for any help you need in class he seems like an ok guy. Sounds like you dont really want to hang out with anyone in your class and you dont have to.

Just tell someone preferably you course supervisor as they can make note of a complaint or worry and you have a paper trail.

First these guys are not your friends they view you as a sex object and they all are trying to have sex with you even if you are younger and drunk, thats why they want you to drink so you'll be more likely to have sex. 

Honestly tell the course supervisor and only hang out with the girls in the class because all the boys sound like predators except M.

This got me was more angry then it should, its actually distrusting their behavior.

Also tell your parents if anything they can help you with talking to the course supervisor.",2016-11-16 23:44:15+00:00,da3har6,1,t3_5dbsvb,8675,relationships
