0,"Regarding the Mars 2039 manned landing: Do we know yet if resources will fly with the crew, be partially obtained from Mars as Oliver de Weck suggests, flown in preemptively as seen in The Martian, or some combination of the above?",2015-10-16 01:10:02+00:00,cw1caim,1,t3_3ow2is,22867,IAmA
1,Thanks! More images is a common suggestion. I'm going to be sure to incorporate them more.,2015-10-01 22:17:00+00:00,cvl19or,2,t1_cvkwfsn,7304,interesting
2,"Absolutely, and great example. Teasing out evolutionary contexts is tough to do. I've yet to see the chin examined genetically, I'm sure there's lots of challenges to isolating the active genes in the equation. This line of evidence could turn how we think we understand the chin on it's head. And that's why I end the video with a reminder to exercise caution with these sorts of things. From an anatomical perspective, we think we're onto something, but there's still lots to learn.",2015-10-01 14:44:11+00:00,cvkip60,4,t1_cvkhnv7,1705,fascinating
3,"I'm picking up what you're putting down, and you're right, meaning and evolutionary context are distinctly different. Through culture, we ascribe meaning whereas evolutionary context is purely biological. But we can view the meaning of something as being a result of it's evolutionary context (i.e. chins might mean that our skeleton evolved to accommodate speech production). In this light we're not doing injustice to the facts, but also not going overboard with ascribing meaning to an otherwise neutral entity. I hope that makes sense.",2015-10-01 14:00:52+00:00,cvkh5wl,2,t1_cvkfom7,2886,fascinating
4,Exactly!,2015-10-01 13:53:22+00:00,cvkgx3u,2,t1_cvk8znb,27440,fascinating
5,Thanks for the feedback. Much appreciated.,2015-10-01 13:51:53+00:00,cvkgvdc,6,t1_cvk77eo,32290,fascinating
6,"I completely agree. I'm still finding my voice and that sweet balance between images, jokes, and my beard. It's going to be awhile before I learn the ins and outs of tuning and comments like yours are an immense help. Thanks for the feedback!",2015-10-01 04:41:29+00:00,cvk6wih,4,t1_cvk6rlc,320,fascinating
7,"Almost! One important distinction: it's not the opening and closing of our mouths that causes stress, but the actual use of our tongue and bottom lip muscles on the part of our bone we know as the chin.",2015-10-01 03:53:01+00:00,cvk5kwr,2,t1_cvk59pz,631,fascinating
