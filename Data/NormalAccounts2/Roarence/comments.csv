Many companies now (like Blue bottle) use large-scale hot air roasters. If I'm not mistaken, Blue bottle's roaster in Oakland isn't actually a drum roaster, its a fluid air bed roaster, it just looks like one. (I've just heard this from higher-ups where I work at, I couldnt find a solid article on it). 

There are pro's and con's, but it seems pretty even because both can produce amazing coffee. judging from what I've seen and heard its just a matter of how much effort you put into following the quality-- variables as you log and roast, tasting and cupping/refracting small batches, and going back making it better, more consistent, and roasting for the individual coffees and not to just get it done (not just to roast it blindly light and call it a day).

The paper filter saves soooo much time with cleaning (especially since I have communal bathrooms, so I have to walk down the hall to wash my french press). I hated cleaning my french press every morning in college! Paper filters changed my mornings, not even exaggerating.

With a clever, its just paper, grounds, then water. Set it on a mug, then just pick up the paper filter and toss it. As a side note: I wasn't allowed open coil appliances, so I had one of the cheap, 'safer' electric kettles for like $15.

Im not arguing that underextraction isnt sour, im saying its not just sour. Its also stronger, bitterish, and salty. Espresso isnt as sinple as bitter and sour. The first part of a shot is strong, but underextracted. Bitter, thick, and salty. Then it gets lighter and sour the longer you drag the extraction (which alot of third wave shops like to pull for-- long shots)",2016-07-17 21:59:41+00:00,d5g35ws,8.0,t1_d5fhhfb,44092.0,Coffee

160,"Opposite, the first part of the shot is overpoweringly bitter, even salty-like. The more you extract, towards over extraction, the more sour it gets. It is called underextraction because you are only extracting the within the first few seconds and cutting it short. If you separate espresso by time, all of them will be bitterish. The last parts of the shot is the most sour, because you're essentially overextracting the puck. This is the reason why a ristretto is much stronger (and less sour, more salty) than a long shot. [Here's Matt Perger explaining this phenomena in an experiment](https://baristahustle.com/a-guide-to-the-espresso-extraction-tasting/). The first few shots are ristrettos. The water dilution thing goes offtopic.

In translation to drip, its how the first few drips after the bloom will be stronger than the drips towards the end (which are lighter, more sour, to balance the entire extraction). Its confusing because an overall underextracted coffee=sour, but that's not the case if you *cut* the extraction short by *time* itself and not by variables (grind size, dose, etc).

Basically, I would advise OP to try a good ristretto. And because of the solubility of lighter coffees, this can only be done with darker coffees, which OP seems to like anyway. Everything is subjective, even if its not the sweet brightness third wave is looking for",2016-07-17 06:17:43+00:00,d5fdxy0,6.0,t1_d5esmsi,41822.0,Coffee

187,"1) That is something you could do, totally! Just make sure to not over do it to extreme overextraction. Just don't make a huge jump from 1:15 randomly to 1:10. Changing a gram or a few at a time is enough. Updosing is just another way to extract more. You could also stir more, grind finer, use hotter water, thinner filter(V60 03 vs chemex filter), age the roasted beans a week  or two/three more etc. and so many other little things. Updosing is just one. Lighter coffees are less soluable, so they naturally need a bit more help with extraction (assuming you're shooting for a high, even extraction %. Aka. Good coffee)

2) Grind settings may be different from one grinder to another, even the same model made the same day. Calibration can always be off

3) Change one variable at a time if you can. Then, using the changes that i mentioned in question 1, adjust accordingly. Here's a useful map by Matt Perger: https://baristahustle.com/the-coffee-compass/

(If you're dialing in from scratch, that's when its okay to make big changes to save beans. Otherwise, you'd actually be wasting beans because big changes are harder to find the right parameters).

Have a consistent method of distribution and tamping. It's less about doing it ""perfectly"" and more about doing it *consistently*. If you're used to a vertical tap, do a vertical tap *every time*. If you don't polish at all, that's one less variable to fk up your pull.

321," I can't help with legality, but I can give some basic advice on gear and coffee particulars. This is from my biased viewpoint: 

I'm guessing most high schoolers won't appreciate the specialty industry. I'd prepare espresso set-ups, emphasis on flavored latte's (both hot and iced). I've found most pre-18 coffee consumers tend towards flavored latte's.

Then perhaps offer a pourover set-up as well, on the side. Maybe you could have ~~3 vessels to make 3 at a time for efficiency.~~ One will do, now that I think about it

Menu could consist of basic espresso drinks (Espresso, macchiato's, cappuccino's, latte's), all with the option for added flavoring. I'd do vanilla and mocha.

If business pulls through, expect to be non-stop pulling shots for lattes! That's my prediction. So with this, you'll need a good espresso machine (like a La Marzocco GS3 or something, or a Linea mini), a good grinder (Mazzer Major or like a Mahlkonig K30), a pourover grinder like a Baratza Virtuoso, and like ~~3~~ V60's. Accessories: tamper, a lot of scales, access to filtered water/plumbing, access to boiling water for pourovers, cups, ice, wholesale orders from a good roaster, wholesale orders from a good milk company (whole milk + half&amp;half), sugar). With all of this, the overall cost would be crazy! You will really have to decide if its worth it. Espresso machine: $2,000-$3,000; Grinder: $1,000-2,000; Pourover setup+grinder ~$500, Wholesale orders for coffee: variable, ~$50-100 week? The roastery I work at roasts wholesale for small cafe's, and that's how much they usually order in a week. Milk: Not sure, but expect a pretty heavy amount per week. Probably at or exceeding coffee costs. Total: Expect a $5,000-7,500 hit to startup.",2016-05-14 09:25:20+00:00,d353fic,1.0,t3_4jaldx,4894.0,Coffee

403,"Actually, a lot of people say that what separates amazing coffee from mediocre coffee is the drink-ability after cooling. A cold amazing coffee will still taste good, just tasty in a different way.

Anyway, apart from that rumor, iced coffee is tricky because in order for it to taste ideal is to chill it immediately. That's why iced pourovers are becoming more and more popular. You brew double strength coffee immediately over ice cubes that make up half of the coffee. As hot coffee sits for long periods of time, it is oxidizing as well as cooling. It's losing all of its good flavors, and bitterness is extenuated.

Another good option is cold brew-- which will always taste clean and be low in acidity. However, cold brew blurs the tastes of the origin of the coffee, and you won't get to appreciate the same amazing notes and mouthfeel the same way you get from an iced pourover.

**EDIT**: What I just wrote was a very ""*specialty-coffee*"" approach to iced coffee. It might be more than what you're looking for. If you just want a simple good iced coffee at home, get a small cold-brewer device. Problems solved! Tastes good-- all the time.

468,"I haven't heard of that La Pavoni, no, but it seems really nice (a little too nice for a manual!). I've had experience with the ROK and the handpresso, both which produce good espresso but are extremely finicky. I'd imagine that the La Pavoni is much better, plus full espresso and steaming capabilities.

However, in my own shoes, I'd be more attracted to other espresso machines in that price range. At that price range, you can shoot for machines with PID (full temperature control, basically), and even dual boilers. PID is important, because with consumer machines, the boilers are typically very weak, and controlling temperature is extremely hard-- especially when pulling more than one shot at a given time. A machine without PID will not pull consistent, good shots without fussing around and using temperature surfing. I've found this extremely frustrating with my Gaggia Classic, which is why I want to upgrade to a dual boiler with PID capabilities. Adding water to the La Pavoni seems finicky as well, since you can really only add water after its cooled down. At that price range (~$800), I'd rather spend that on a Crossland CC1 ($700), or $1,000 for a Breville BES900XL.

Basically: I would find more value in a Crosslands CC1 ($700) or even a Breville BES900XL($1,000). Both of which would pull more consistent shots. Also, budget for a $300+ grinder dedicated to espresso. Also, first getting into espresso drove me crazy! I think I wasted a good 2-3 pounds of coffee trying to dial it in.

The espresso machine on the second picture is a La Morzocco GS3, a super pro-sumer espresso machine at ~$7,000. Great choice.

For an espresso grinder, I'd use an electric Mazzer Major. (Still a lot of money though).

For drip, i'd get something like 3 Kalita Waves, a Bonavita Variable temp, a large water filter, and just use a Baratza Virtuoso.

You won't need a water heater. You'll just need a ton of water and a way to filter it all. I wouldnt know how to help with issues regarding water.

Business-wise: Do not just place yourself at a random area without a coffee shop concentration.

And of course, a gooseneck kettle, scale, timer if you dont already have these.

Now into espresso options. I've found that the absolute bare minimum setup for espresso is a Baratza Preciso(~$300) and A Gaggia Pure (~$120 refurb). The preciso is consistent and precise enough for espresso grinding, but you'll have to manually measure how much coffee you grind into the portafilter via scale. Gaggia pure is the cheapest 58mm commercial non-pressurized machine that hits 9lb. Note: this will not make latte art. The minimum for that is the Gaggia classic (with rancilo sylvia wand mod).

The main reason why I would buy the Jennings is because its large enough to fit a portafilter on-top to weigh dry input without weird angles.

My personal AWS scale is pretty alright, but sometimes  its innaccurate (jumps like 0.3g sometimes, slowly rises in mass randomly someatimes. Its never a large amount so its okay). I'd recommend an AWS price-wise.

The Hario is definitely my favorite scale, price aside. Its not as mechanically durable as the Jennings, but it won't have electrical problems like the Jennings. Long-term, that means less headaches. Its smaller. I particularly like the detailing of the Hario, its definitely the most aesthetically pleasing.  It also has a timer, but I rarely use it.

And of course, allot money for scales (~$10), demitasse cups (~10), a timer (~$5), better tamper (~$15), good non-burnt espresso beans, and etc.

My opinions &amp; details: The *Gaggia Pure* essentially has the same internals of the minimum recommended espresso machine (Gaggia Classic). It allows for the perfect 9 bars of pressure for extracting espresso, comes with a 58mm commercial portafilter, and okay temperature stability once you learn temp surfing.

The *Preciso* allows for amazing precision with a ridiculous number of grind settings. It can definitely grind fine and consistent enough for espresso. It beats grinders like the Rocky in both sheer quality of grinds and usability. 

To learn to dial in an actually good shot takes time. You'll probably blow through a pound of beans just trying to get one good shot when you're first learning. Extra items include: scales help the process, demitasse cups make it a nice experience, a dedicated timer for extractions, better tamper for flat grounds, and of course good beans.",2016-01-12 04:59:36+00:00,cyuzhkh,1.0,t3_40kt9j,2839.0,Coffee

So its just an iced pourover, but because you're essentially diluting the coffee with ice, you'll need to adjust some ratios. WARNING: Coffee geekery coming now:

So the baseline is 1 part ice and 1 part water. So if you're making a 350ml size drink, itll be around 125ml ice and 125ml water. However, there are some things you have to change as well. Typically I'd make a 350ml pourover with 24-25g coffee(350ml in, 25g dry coffee). But when iced, I'd make it 150ml hot water in, 30g dry coffee, and 125ml ice sitting in the vessel (i just use 4 ice cubes). I'd do as i do for a regulat pourover, but instead of letting it drip all the way, i pull the filter and grounds *before* all the water seeps through. I've found this made a better cup. Right before you expect to see all the water seep through, pull the filter. It turns out to be about 125ml of a slightly more concentrated coffee, diluted in ice.

Blue Bottle's Hayes Valley espresso, Intelligentsia's Black Cat, etc). it is usually this case.

For example, [Portola's Ethiopian Harrar](http://shop.portolacoffeelab.com/coffee_beans/mesela.html), their grade-1 Mesela, is an amazing coffee. Tell him all about how this region of Ethiopea(Harrar), elevation(1800m-1900m), and dry processed coffee will taste really sweet &amp; bright with notes of blueberry and honey. Ethiopian Harrar's tend to be very bright. Accompanied by the high elevation and dry process, this coffee make a really good tasting, bright &amp; sweet cup.

Alternatively, [Artis Coffee](http://shop.artiscoffee.com/) (based in the California Bay Area), will roast your coffee 100% to your liking. If you visit the store, they actually roast it on the spot for you within a few minutes. They use a special roaster that hits exactly certain temperatures, and you can contact them to try a custom light roast for his liking. Perhaps their newly stocked [Ethiopean Yirgacheffe Torea](http://shop.artiscoffee.com/collections/coffees/products/ethiopia-torea), which I love. Its also dry processed, with even higher elevation (2200-2500). This one tastes similar to the Mesela, but definitely even brighter, and more cherry notes.

However, for an iced-cappuccino, you just spoon foamed milk on top of what essentially is an iced latte. This is known to be very wasteful, and therefore not many places serve a real iced cappuccino. An iced macchiato is a whole different story, and is extremely controversial. A real macchiato by definition cannot be iced. The way I see it, I assume you are making an iced macchiato-latte, which is just cold milk with espresso over it (vs. espresso first, then milk poured ontop). Essentially, it is an upside down iced latte. It is cold milk, ""marked""(macchiato), by espresso.

I recommend your cafe abolishing the iced cappuccino and iced macchiato, and only served iced lattes. Otherwise, you risk mislabeling your drinks, unless you truly are making an iced cappuccino with spooned foam and an upside down latte

669,"Because of the way the aeropress is designed (essentially full-immersion, pressurized, great press/filter design), its very versatile. No matter what you put in, the output is a lot easier to keep balanced with an even extraction vs other methods.

For example, if you did 1:5 with a pourover, it would just flow terribly and turn out extracted with less output. However, with the aeropress, it's full immersion so you can stir it, then you can extract all of it by using hard force &amp; vacuum to pull everything out.

If you did 1:5 with a French press, it could work, but it would be hard to press down all of the grinds. You would end up with a whole lot of sludge, and since there's such a high concentration of grinds, its hard to get the water to extract everything evenly by just sitting there. You could just let it sit longer, but then some grinds would end up over-extracted and some grinds under-extracted, resulting in an uneven brew. The vacuum in the Aeropress fixes this issue. Also, there is minimal sludge, because of the way the press filters with a paper filter and leaves almost no sludge seeping through the sides (as a French Press might).

With all of this together, you can essentially brew a concentrate that is between espresso and regular coffee by using a creative 1:5 ratio. You can make something inbetween a latte and a cafe au lait. Or, you could dilute it, and it would be between a regular cup of coffee and an americano. The magic of the Aeropress is that it is the single most creative brewer, where you can make a lot of things you can't with other brewers together in one vessel.",2015-11-17 20:52:32+00:00,cx3pt6f,1.0,t3_3t658g,17162.0,Coffee

Anyway,

1) No

2) Very similar to other pourovers, a bit more body/ extraction (edit)

3) Yes, but its not that big of a difference. Essentially, they all need precise pouring to get the most out of the brewer. It's just the V60 needs even more. You will eventually want a gooseneck kettle, regardless of which one you choose

4) More robust. Pourovers are more clear. However, Aeropress is limited in coffee output. I honestly prefer the Aeropress taste-wise.

5) Honestly, I would recommend just getting the Melitta. Its really good for what it is and the price. 

I would honestly recommend a Clever/Bonavita immersion or just a Melitta + save money for a gooseneck.

2) You could get your own semi-automatic espresso machine &amp; a good grinder, which will produce amazing coffee-- but only if you pay attention to details. ($300 machine, $400 grinder)

3) If you just want drip coffee, however, you could get a SCAA approved, really damn good automatic drip brewer, and a better grinder ($150 machine, $150 grinder)

4) Or, you could have a really cheap set-up for manual drip coffee that'll make amazing cups. Aeropress, pourover, Clever dripper, etc. Maybe even just improve your press pot. ($30 to start out, $100 grinder still needed)

5) Then there's the super-automatic espresso machines, which can range from $600 - $3,000. These are basically the one-touch machines that you seem to prefer.

An iced macchiato is kinda stupid, because you're wasting milk by steaming then using cold milk instead. If you really want the ""stained/marked"" effect, then just ask them to put the espresso over the steamed milk.

As for actual brew methods, I would suggest starting off with a method that is generally easier.

Now I have both a V60 vessel and Chemex vessel, and I find that the vessels are virtually interchangeable (only a minuscule difference) via the two filters. The filters are basically the difference. I've moved to a temporary residence, and I only brought my V60 filter and vessel. However, I brought both Chemex &amp; V60 filters, and I have the option to make both types of cups :)

Just remember to keep note of grind size. A V60 takes a significantly finer grind (a tad finer than regular drip/pourover like the melitta), and the Chemex takes a very coarse drip grind.

Note: Some people can argue that the V60 is more particular about it because of the ribbed waves and the slightly smaller hole, but it is honestly the same. The Chemex's vessel comes into complete contact with the filter-- and that makes a minuscule difference. Honestly I find the V60's ribbed design to just be better overall, and even the Chemex filter works better in it.

However, in more rural areas in CA, a lot of the times they have a ""shall issue"" mind-set (even though we're a may-issue state), where pretty much anyone who isn't a felon can get one. The problem is that CA says you need a ""probable cause"", but certain counties are extremely lenient whilst some won't even issue to someone who had a written letter from an assailant saying he will harm him again.

It is an issue of politics, imo. But thats just how I look at it. The second amendment is not violated because you can still own firearms and keep inside your home. The problem is simply with carrying it concealed in public.",2015-08-07 18:20:49+00:00,ctv27zq,1.0,t3_3g4bdf,23783.0,EDC

Not that they were rude-- they were incredible polite. I feel like they were just *too* knowledgeable to not judge.

But at the same time, this craft coffee is a source of joy, and should be treated as such. I think some baristas just need a small shift in their views on less knowledgable customers. Instead of judging, we should educate everyone in the most friendly manner possible

As for aluminum, 90% of all aluminum frames are 6061 aluminum. This includes Leader, aventon, breakbrake17, and even certain Cannondale track frames(my caad5 track is 6061). They are essentally the same shit. But of course, the caad5 track will ride and be generally better than the aventon because tolerances, build quality, geometry blah blah blah. Basically the same shit... But aluminum is light and is strong. That's why you see all thick-tube/""aero"" bikes are either aluminum or carbon fiber-- because these materials are light. If you manufacture a thick steel tube, it'd be heavy like cycling a carbon bike with bricks in your bag.

Then there's Chromoly steel, which is quality steel. Its strong. Its significantly lighter than hi-ten, but not lighter than the same volume of aluminum. Its great for street, because it dampens the road more.

Steel frames are generally more relaxed, because much of the street frames on the market are for no-bullshit bikes that people ride on the street. However, that is not always the case. My EAI bareknuckle is pretty aggressive on the geometry. Likewise, the fixed gear market seems to use 6061 to appeal to the ""street-race"" market. Brands like low// and bb17 throw up these aluminum lo-style bikes. Leader throws out thick aero down tubes in 6061. But there are some 6061 frames out there that are relaxed.

Tl;dr: get a chromoly steel frame. All city big block -thumbs up-

Tl;dr#2: a 6061 aluminum can fulfill your aesthetic tastes. Thats perfectly okay, and looks is a large part of the culture. I've always loved Leaders. They have their shit together and make good, affordable frames.

Interested in your PM2

See anything you like? The Desert Tan PM2 was a real black/black PM2. It was duracoated tan. The Anzo-style black PM2 is a clone. The non-spydercos are: Benchmade Mini-grip, Boker Wharcom, and I threw in a $80 Bulova 96B104 and a leather Timex Weekender and a zippo for good measure if you are interested in those haha. Not-pictured, I also have a BM42 clone for trade

I am a spyderco guy lol. I have some cash but not a lot, so I might sell my tan paramilitary. If I do and I get more money, could I buy your PM2?

If you cant tell, I really want a satin/black PM2 haha",2015-06-24 16:31:44+00:00,csh76p0,1.0,t3_3ayohz,2596.0,Knife_Swap
