I have a 2014 Kawasaki Ninja 300. Bought 2,000 miles off craigslist, has not been checked by a mechanic yet.

So I was riding along, up a steep hill, until I needed to stop for a car who was turning left. I stopped behind him, and I was thinking about too much at the same time, and forgot to switch gears to first. I was still in second gear. So I start from second (on a fairly steep hill), and I hear something ""slip"", and like some low-rpm metal clashing noise. After about a second or two, I was going fine up the hill. Note: I did accelerate a little rough.

In addition to this, the rest of the ride home (only ~10 blocks), I felt as though the engine had a slight high-pitched noise. When I clutched in or stopped, it gradually faded away. When I accelerated, the slight high-pitch noise got louder. At a standstill with the clutch in, I can't hear it. This might just be placebo.

I feel like I'm worried for no reason! But at the same time, I want to make sure. I'll check with a mechanic eventually, but now is a weird time in my life to get that done.

I'm an extremely new rider, and the idea of downshifting at stoplights kind of boggles me.

Ideally, I get that you should match engine rev's and downshift to a stop. I'm still learning to do that smoothly.

However, what I've been doing is this:

Say I'm just rolling at like 40mph in 3rd gear. At a stoplight, I would pull the Clutch in, Break, and shift from 3rd, to 2nd, to 1st gear (all at once). I then fully stop while holding in the clutch in 1st gear. 

I'm under the impression that this is really bad for the bike. Is that true? I'm not too comfortable downshifting and matching engine rev's in public traffic yet. Should I definitely learn to downshift one-by-one ASAP?

I want to start working as an RN right out of college, but I'm getting the vibe that accelerated MSN-CNL's have a harder time getting the same RN position. Is that true?

I'm a college student in San Francisco, 19.

I hope this isn't a redundant thread, but I really just wanted to express how damn excited I am after reading everything on this subreddit and some forums. It seems obvious, but the idea of being able to bike, not stuck in a car, anywhere and affordable at anytime and find parking everywhere is so new and seductive to me. And that's thanks to reading everything that's on here and online.

In California, under 21 applicants must take a CHP Motorcycle class, and I plan to take one in November. But for gear, I am required to bring a jacket. And that got me thinking about what I would truly need to start out. I truly hope I don't fall into a deficit, and it turns out I won't have enough money to sustain myself.

If I will be commuting 5 days a week for 18miles over a bridge, what gear will I need? I've read around, and it seems that I should be expecting spending $700-1,000 on gear alone.

I have some savings (~1,000) that's apart from housing/food and have a part-time job which will grab me $4,000 also by the end of spring. I plan to buy a used Ninja 300, hopefully for a good find at about $3,000 or so. For insurance, is it a bad idea to just grab the most basic liability insurance for $200 a year?

Then adding on Fastrak(bridge toll), which I've calculated out to be $400 a year for how much I commute for.

**tl;dr:**

1) Will I go broke? Are there any other fees/stuff I have to buy that I'm missing?
($3,000 ninja 300, $1,000 gear, $400/yr bridge toll, $200/yr insurance) = $4,600 the initial year &amp; startup.

2) Is the bare-bones ~$200/yr insurance a bad idea?

3) I'm a safe driver and bicyclist, but I'm still a bit scared for crashes. A little background: CA car licensed for 1 yr; Have experience with road cycling, lane splitting. I won't do anything reckless. Generally, how are my chances of being in an accident?

4) Lane splitting on the Bay Bridge (if you know) safe?

Sorry for another new-rider post. Hopefully I'm not just a redundant post, but I was hoping for some general advice/insight. If anyone has advice on bay area motorcycling, that would be really helpful
