I worked at a country club and often times the beer cart that drives around the course to sell alcohol does not get unloaded properly and ""things"" get left behind. My job had me doing a lot of tasks for low pay so when I had to lock up the beer cart every night I would take whatever was left inside and sell it to my younger friends to make some extra money. One night the food manager (not my manager and didnt know me) saw me looking in the beer cart and decided to breathalyze me. I blew a 0.00 because I never drank on the job, but since he breathalyzed me it was protocol to notify my manager. The next day i went in to work and they had checked the cameras and saw me the previous day taking shooters of vodka and i was fired on the spot by the owner. Completely my fault and I think about it every day. I have had 7 job interviews since and every time they ask why I stopped working at the country club, and I don't lie so I tell the interviewer the truth and haven't gotten a call back yet. biggest mess up of my life so far.",2016-11-10 05:24:49+00:00,d9tyq7r,1,t3_5c63xe,1258,AskReddit
