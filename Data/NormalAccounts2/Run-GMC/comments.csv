""As it turns out, this hairstyle is only possible with the help of so-called 'polarity genes.'""

This seems to imply that the genes that suppress this kind of cancer cause hair to grow in different directions, which would mean the cowlick suggests the existence of those genes. But...

""The researchers removed this retinoblastoma suppressor protein from their fruit flies, and watched as they took on an “unkempt” appearance, developing poorly-oriented wing hair, indicating that it also controls the expression of polarity genes as well as having anti-cancer functionality.""

This seems to suggest the the cowlicky appearance only developed after the genes were removed, which tells me that the cowlick indicates a lack of the genes.

Secondarily, I think DD does a pretty bad job by its characters of color. Outside Dawson, they're all pretty thin stereotypes or fridge fodder (or both!). Arrow has some POC problems, too, (as does most media) but I don't think it's that bad.

Because, I mean, the damage to his cells was real, and his experience with the speed force as E2 Flash was real. There's no way around that. (I think, also, that his regenerative capabilities being restored mean he's not dead: just healing).

In this theory, the complication isn't that Jay's dead, but that in the original timeline the breaches were never closed or Jay didn't find out so early, or something along those lines.

Of course, this whole theory is worthless because I HIGHLY DOUBT they would go to the time travel well again so soon for their big climax. So I don't know.

Carter clearly wanted to play both sides equally, so we got a plot that said, ""Not all Muslim men are terrorists, even though all Muslim men are terrorists."" It was an example of ""fair and balanced"" in all it's horrific glory.

Shiraz was meant to be the counterpoint, but you can't have a single character standing as the lone representative of ""good Muslims,"" especially if you're going to strip that character's agency by sidelining him in a coma for the whole episode. Even when he does speak, it's not audible, and we only get his words later through Mulder's voice. So he's just a Silenced Noble Muslim who also gets to be Our One Muslim Friend.

I also think there's some weirdness behind the trope that I could leave behind. More often than not, a secret identity is being kept by a male hero from a girlfriend, and it's just a boring, insulting, helpless damsel in distress thing.

1108,"Count me as one of the ones who really disliked it. The episode seemed to want us to believe that Cat saw it as a story and nothing more, but the rest of her characterization in the first half of the season shows a Cat Grant with more depth than that.

I don't know. There's a slavish devotion to secret identities in superhero stories, especially in DC properties. One of the quietly brilliant things about the MCU is that as soon as Tony Stark said who he was, they haven't bothered to make it a thing for anybody else.

Personally, I think that allows for more interesting, complex relationships and character arcs, because there's only so much you can do with the idea that your secret identity is important, and it is always the exact same for virtually every single character. It's tedious, and illogical in a lot of ways.

And, I mean, you could feel how tedious it was during those stretches of Blood Bonds. Every scene between Kara and Cat was hard to sit through. They were, for the first time on this show, just straight up boring. Even the musical cues couldn't take those plot beats seriously.

By the far the worst parts about these other shows, which I mostly love, center around the same stupid plotline. I like Iris in Flash, but man I probably would not watch a single Iris scene from season 1 ever again if I can avoid it.

At least Arrow punishes Oliver when he lies to people, instead of treating it like some great personal victory on his part.

Cat and Kara are both more interesting, and have a more interesting relationship, if Cat knows. For me, it's as simple as that.",2016-01-07 16:44:02+00:00,cypgrjo,1.0,t3_3zotct,118984.0,supergirlTV

So going to JJ is in line with the tradition of the series's best films. Also, something the prequels lost that Lucas had a clear vision for in the first three was the idea of mythology. One of the big themes of the new movie that we know about is this status Luke and company share as living legends, as figures many people in the galaxy don't even believe in, or believe in but as legends.

Kilgrave attached himself to Jessica because she was the only person who could deny him. He said so himself. He was not in love with her, but desirous of a fragment of her. That's a fetish.

There are few interesting minutes where he struggles over the fact that he enjoys torturing people, but... his attitude and his methods aren't demonstrably changed by his struggle in any way. At the end of the season, he just beats the crap out of his problem all over again, except that I'm supposed to buy how it's heroic that time. This would all be one thing if he were a proper anti-hero, but the show wants him to be read as a straight up hero and... gosh, heroes aren't sadists.

In fact, one of the reasons I like Arrow so much is because Oliver's early sadism is clearly rooted in his trauma, which the show goes to great lengths to establish, and that as he gets healthier mentally he also gets less and less brutal in his methods.

1209,"They never said it explicitly, but he was used to introduce the idea of metas being made outside of the explosion, which led directly to the Earth 2 reveal (and as far as I know, nobody on Earth 1 got any powers outside of the explosion). I had been assuming it was all connected, even though they haven't just said it outright.

How else would Simmons have gotten his powers, though? It feels like a plot hole to me if he's not from Earth 2.",2015-11-03 19:44:48+00:00,cwn8cv9,4.0,t1_cwn4d6k,5521.0,arrow
1210,"I suspect they're planning to. The whole point of episode 2 seemed to be ""KARA IS NOT SUPERMAN AND SHE DOESN'T NEED TO BE AND WE'LL ALL BE HAPPIER WHEN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT HIM"" in all caps, which was ironic because they could not stop talking about him.

I was actually getting pretty annoyed early in the episode because I don't want this show to constantly be playing itself out of Superman's shadow. Kara stands on her own. I stopped being so annoyed when the episode seemed to start saying the same thing about halfway through.",2015-11-03 17:50:51+00:00,cwn3f97,3.0,t1_cwmpam4,31440.0,supergirlTV

1215,"I want to say that it is DEFINITELY worth sticking out because I think it's amazing and because -- like with anything else -- it does get better and better as the story grows, but I also think it started strong. The format, tone, style, comedy, etc. all really haven't changed from the first episode. They had a really strong sense of the show from the start. The quality doesn't really change over time, but the story does expand and the world grows, and the cast expands.

But it sounds like the things that put you off aren't things that change over time. So maybe it's not for you.

1216,"I think there's a sexist side to the attention it's getting now. There's kind of a long history of blowback against the linguistic innovations of young women, even though those same innovations tend to be at the forefront of larger linguistic trends (think the ""valley"" use of the word like as a filler word, which got a similarly bad response when it became a thing -- but now we all do it!).

Men and women have had vocal fry as a characteristic of their speech for a long time (including, famously, Eartha Kitt and Maya Angelou), but it was never anything anybody was annoyed by until young women started picking it up en masse in the last several years. In that way, yes, I do think sexism plays a role. I simply don't know any other way to interpret something when the criticism for the thing only starts up in earnest when the thing becomes popular with women.

That isn't to say that people who are annoyed by it are being actively sexist, but it's also useful for individuals to wonder how they're being influenced by the sexism latent in our culture.",2015-10-29 21:39:11+00:00,cwhnngy,1.0,t3_3qqw6y,6314.0,podcasts

1222,"It's not super consistent (Cisco's powers?), but a bunch of the metas we've seen were in mortal danger when the explosion happened and have powers that relate to their almost deaths (Barry's lightning, the gas chamber, the bad weather, etc.). So a lot of those people were either already leading lives that put them in danger or were suffering a serious trauma when they were transformed. No wonder so many are so messed up!

I also like the idea others have brought up that most metas probably have super mundane powers (ones they might not even realize -- like what if you were hard boiling an egg during the explosion, and now your power is that any eggs around you become perfectly hard boiled?) or just want to lead normal lives.",2015-10-29 16:59:00+00:00,cwhbu26,1.0,t3_3qnv9m,44803.0,FlashTV
