http://www.unilad.co.uk/gaming/guy-tells-epic-story-about-an-abandoned-dog-he-found-in-skyrim/

If you want the tl;dr, this guy wrote a (possibly fictional) account of his adventures playing Skyrim, chronicling the saga of becoming emotionally attached to a non-playable dog in the game and then adapting his entire gameplay experience to the purpose of giving that character a safe home.

There are some really interesting things going on with storytelling here, and I haven't thought everything through, but here's a short list of what I'm thinking about:

1) Skyrim isn't a game about dogs. It's a game about hitting things with swords, collecting resources, exchanging resources for goods like more swords, and hitting things with your new swords. But the world is expansive, and supports secondary and tertiary activities like marriages, adoptions, and home building. It's a world big enough to include dogs.

2) The world is so big that the main storyline actually gets lost amid all the other pieces. I know in my playthrough, I avoided the main story in favor of sidequests and herb collecting and skillbuilding and exploring, and there was enough there to sustain my interest for dozens of hours without once touching the main story.

3) This creates a space for supplemental stories, like the dog saga, to emerge.

That's not all, though.

4) The dog saga was then given to us on Twitter. I actually came across it as it was developing, and I was ENGROSSED, waiting anxiously for the next tweet, and the next tweet.

5) So there's something there about cross-media storytelling and also about serialized storytelling, and short-form storytelling, and something similar but not quite congruent with oral storytelling.

6) But I was also engrossed in the story on twitter because I've played Skyrim (and am active on Twitter), so this is a also a cross-media shared experience that allowed this to be so effective.

7) And, finally, in the end I don't even know if the story actually happened! It could be fiction, created based on the knowledge of the capability of the game to support supplemental stories (and enough knowledge of the game to fictionalize one).

8) So I may be celebrating a cross-media serialization of a fictional shared experience.

And... that's as far as my thoughts have gotten here for the moment. In general, I'm not super interested in non-traditional or emergent forms of storytelling, but this was the perfect combination of my interests and media and I'm sort of blown away by it.

So, I want to welcome two things for discussion here: First, if you have some extra thoughts about how the storytelling is working here, I am FASCINATED and would love to hear it. OR, if you have a good relevant experience creating a supplemental story for something that ended up being more important to you than the official story of that thing, I'd love to hear that, too.",writing,Patrick Lenton's Skyrim dog saga on Twitter has me thinking about storytelling.,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/4dhtrt/patrick_lentons_skyrim_dog_saga_on_twitter_has_me/

Even with some plot flaws, I was completely taken in by having Peggy, Dottie, Whitney, and Anna all chewing so much screen time so damn well.

And then Jarvis comes up in that last scene completely broken, and D'arcy broke me.

Now, I've always liked Jarvis, of course. D'Arcy's comic chops have been impeccable and his chemistry with Atwell is crazy. But this was the first time I was really floored by him, possibly because with a few looks he stole an episode from a quad-act of brilliant performances.

Then this week, his performance was absolutely heartbreaking.

So I wanted to take a moment to appreciate what he brings to this show. What's your favorite Jarvis moment from these first two seasons?",agentcarter,James D'Arcy Appreciation Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/agentcarter/comments/47ewiq/james_darcy_appreciation_post/

One day she turns to me and say, ""Candy bars.""

I look at her and say, ""You can't cook candy bars.""

Then, of course, I realized how wrong I was. I was thinking you make candy bars, you don't cook them. But that's just semantics. So we hit the internet and found this great list of easy candy bar recipes:

http://www.mywebroom.com/blog/easy-candy-bar-recipes-you-can-make-at-home/

We've tried most of them now (both Twix recipes are killer, and I'll probably only ever eat homemade peanut butter cups again), but now of course we've got the itch for it and we're running out.

I was just going to Google up another list, but again my girlfriend stepped in with a better idea. Why not ask people who care about cooking and who know about good food? A personal response is always cooler than some lame search result.

454,2015-12-11 18:43:47+00:00,self.arrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/3wesa7/spoilers_beating_a_dead_well_we_dont_know_whos/,False,"I debated about posting this because there has been plenty of speculation about the flash forward and any character that could be theorized has been theorized, but in the end I thought maybe this was different enough to be worth your time. I'll try to put some effort in to make sure it is.

I don't really want to ask you who you think it is, or tell you who I think it is. I have a pretty good idea of who I think it is (Samantha Clayton), but what's more interesting to me isn't who it will be, but who it should be (Connor).

I'll start out by saying there are some spoilers ahead for Season 1 Game of Thrones, Buffy and DS9, too, so if you're worried about those series for some reason, hey, fair warning.

The first thing I want to get out of the way is that, like a lot of people, I've gotten really disillusioned with shocking main cast character deaths in general. There's a school of thought that sudden, shocking deaths are good because they reflect reality (in real life, death doesn't always serve a narrative purpose), and there's a school of thought that they are good because they hurt the most. There's some logic there, but I can't subscribe to either anymore. Not fully, anyway.

The reason is that I think those schools of thought lead to bad storytelling. Fiction may be realistic, but it's not reality (recall: ""the difference between fiction and reality is that fiction has to make sense.""), and a story that adheres to narrative reason EXCEPT for when it comes to character deaths is a story that's lying to itself about why those deaths are happening. Similarly, a story that goes for maximum pain, but doesn't have that pain follow from the narrative is using death as a gimmick. In both cases, audiences have the right to feel cheated.

So, by way of example, I think of Tara from Buffy and Jadzia from DS9. Narratively, both of these deaths worked the same way. In order to make them hurt as much as possible, the stories were written so that they were killed the moment they became the happiest. That's a kind of crass manipulation, and in narrative terms it means that the consequence for happiness is death, which audiences SHOULD find absurd.

Now: Ned Stark. There was a death that was shocking, realistic, painful, AND narratively consistent! And those are the reasons it works so well. We don't see it coming because we think Ned is the hero, but he's spent an entire season digging his own grave, making mistake after fatal mistake. His story led to his death. It did not manipulate us into it.

Now, say Tara had died as a consequence of Willow's magic. That would follow from the story we were being told, and give Willow just as good of a reason to lose her crap as Warren did.

What this brings me to, then, is secondary characters. I don't think these same rules apply for secondary characters, because narratively speaking they are something closer to props for the story to use. The problem is either finding a main caster whose story is leading to their own demise (which I don't personally see), or finding a secondary character who will hurt.

Which is why I think it will be Samantha. Storywise, this hurts Olly and throws everything upside down for him. Now Connor is his, and his relationship with Felicity has to contend with that.

But I don't like the idea that it's Samantha because she doesn't hurt enough, and adding a child actor to the main cast is... questionable, let's say. Connor hurts more. He hurts a lot more. It should be him.

Who do you think it will be? Who do you think it should be? Why?",arrow,"[Spoilers] Beating a dead... well, we don't know who's dead yet. Here's who it SHOULD be in the grave.",https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/3wesa7/spoilers_beating_a_dead_well_we_dont_know_whos/

I think this might be a good place to share stories about breakthroughs, and to share information about them that can't be worked out from a Washington Post article, and learn more about the potential and the limits, and, maybe, for those of us who have looked at our futures and seen cancer, maybe start to look at our futures and see cures.",cancer,"I feel like there's been a lot of really positive news in cancer research, and since cancer runs in my family these stories all make me more excited about my future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/3skbun/i_feel_like_theres_been_a_lot_of_really_positive/
