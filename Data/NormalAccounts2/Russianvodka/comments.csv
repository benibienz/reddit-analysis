1,we just used an empty board printed offline and everyone fills in what they want. this one was our secretary's and I died laughing when I saw it. we work in the ER so this is like every day for us! ,2016-10-03 06:38:30+00:00,d8buapt,2,t1_d8bpg95,10694,nursing

4,We are short staffed so there is literally no one to replace anyone. Also we work Monday-friday so it's pretty different where I work. I'm pretty sure we use agency nurses only for long periods rather than just a day.,2016-06-21 03:33:17+00:00,d4hkfo4,4,t1_d4hk0dj,746,nursing

Edit: just went back and listened some more and in the beginning the lady and the people are saying that he should not be moved. Then the motorcycle guy starts wrapping the blanket around and says the most important thing I that he can breathe easier. So it seems like everyone was already considering his breathing etc. I know for sure later on in the video he says don't touch him he's breathing just fine. So yea I think all these people did a fine job. ",2016-04-15 15:50:55+00:00,d243sbd,3,t1_d23llq9,42476,WTF
14,The motor cycle guy definitely checked pulse and told everyone that he was still breathing and to not touch him. (Probably until more help arrived) I think the blanket was used for keeping the passenger warm because Russia is cold.

21,"As promised, post-op. The post op I do is post PACU and it's for out patient surgeries. It gets pretty crazy and about every 30-45 minutes you are getting a new patient. So you have to turn over quick. You have around 3 patients per nurse so it's not too bad. The skills you get to use here is critical thinking skills cause sometimes patients aren't really ready to go home. Other times you want to hold on to them cause you are so used to floor nursing but you need to get them on the way home cause if not you'll back up cases into OR. In post-op I hand out all kinds of meds, sometimes insert straight caths or foleys and learn to give some of the fastest discharge instructions you've ever heard. Downside, it is so incredibly  fast paced. Up side, there's an end to the day and if there's a patient you can't stand you only have to put up with them for 30-45 minutes.

22,"I do mostly post op and sometimes pre-op. So I'll start with pre-op. For pre-op at our hospital the schedule is monday-friday 6:00-2:30. You only have one patient at a time. You have to be up on your pharm because labs might have to be drawn to check for potassium  etc. You get lots of Iv starting experience, if you werent good before you will be after. There are lots of questions to be asked however you develop your own pattern and it becomes faster. The one con I can think of is that if you aren't quick enough to turn over patients, the OR team and surgeon will be breathing down your neck.... lunch is over but I'll post about post-op when I get home tonight

23,"I've just started working in phase 2 recovery  2 months ago (recovery for out patients, post pacu). We do call for pacu and help pacu out all the time. Our pacu is a lot bigger than 4 beds probably around 16 or so. I have never seen the nurses help out in the OR or asked to help with anything OR related.  Additionally, phase 2 (where I work) is responsible for recovering endo patients and only get endo patients when anesthesia sedates the patient a little  too much for us to take them in phase 2. Our pacu only recovers patients and sends them either to phase 2 to go home or back to the floor  for inpatient care. I know that working in phase 2 I help pacu as needed but I cannot do their job because I am not critically trained. When I have time, I go to pacu and 
help to do small things that take time like restocking or emptying linen bags/ turning over beds etc. Maybe you can ask what it is that the OR  needs help with, maybe it's not actual OR work but small things that could really help them out while you aren't busy in Pacu.  But to answer your question, I don't believe that all recovery nurse positions are like the one you described.

40,"He said he did change the oil and has the reciept for 2 but I guess it sounds like every time he went to visit his parents they changed the oil for him and they don't have the receipts and therefore he doesn't know where they took the car. He did say that he probably should have changed the oil more frequently but that he did change the oil. I feel really bad because he is a super nice person and his parents have literally torn him a new one because they think it's his fault. The thing is I really don't think it's his fault and I definitely think that it's hyndai's engine which is defective. If you Google it, the first blog that pops up tells a lady's story in which she had just gotten and oil change and it instantly turned to sludge the next day. I think something I leaking into the oil but I am not a car mechanic so I have no idea. But there are multiple articles that show the weak points in this particular year and model.

45,"I have the Samsung galaxy tab 4 nook and I love it. What I love most about it is that I can choose from 3 different stores. This is because it has Google play and you can download the nook and Kindle app. Therefore, there's like a 99 percent chance I can get the book I want, when I want it, for the price I want. I have had a Kindle fire before my nook and while I liked it I still didn't have access to all the things I wanted. And so now it remains mostly unused. The Samsung galaxy 4 nook is also really light weight and had a camera. I can also watch netflix on it. They usually put it on sale around holidays for as little as 129.
