I was super excited cause they were offering me 2 extra dollars per hour base pay. Today they called back saying that it had been a mistake and they can only offer me a dollar more instead. Needless to say I am really bummed out.,nursing,HR makes a mistake,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/4me2cy/hr_makes_a_mistake/

Anyone done a big move like this before? I've got about 6 months of experience in periop. Could use some advice about: great hospitals in that area, if I need to change my license even if it's a compact state, if it will be extremely difficult finding a job with only 6 months under my belt and no medsurg, and any other advice someone wants to throw at me. I do love my current job, the only reason we want to move is cause we came to virginia with the military and got stuck when my husband got out. We have family in sc and want to be closer to them.",nursing,Moving to a new state,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/49hexb/moving_to_a_new_state/

My problem is that head and shoulders works really well to manage my dandruff but I would like to be able to use other kinds of shampoo. Is it possible to get rid of dandruff to the point of where you don't have to use shampoos like head and shoulders anymore? The most I can go without is around 3 days before my head starts getting itchy.,HaircareScience,Dandruff help,https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/3x5x2n/dandruff_help/

After the car shop evaluated it, they found a large amount of sludge in the engine and stated that the engine would now need to be replaced. The warranty for his car was denied because he was not able to provide enough adequate proof of car mateinence despite the fact that he did have his oil changed fairly regularly. I did some googling and as it turns out there are a large amount of people with the same problem! So much so that there is a class action law suit that got filled in May 2015. There were a couple of links that said you could sign up to be added to the law suit but I was wondering is there anything that can be done now? He doesn't have the 9000 dollars they have quoted him for the engine and he still needs to be able to get around. I'm also wondering if maybe there is some kind of an appeal process for the denial of the warranty. Hopefully I posted this is the right place. Any help is much appreciated.
