14,"AFAIK you were legally correct as in all/most/almost all? jurisdictions cyclists on their bike are considered vehicles and therefore can't use the crosswalk.

In practice, many cyclists either learn incorrectly and/or feel safer in crosswalks. And then, if they're going to use the crosswalk, there is this idea that it saves time for everyone if they just ride carefully through the crosswalk.

In places with highly developed cycle lanes and a high level of driver education this use of a crosswalk is unacceptable and unsafe. But in many areas it is a more accepted practice, even if it is, in facto, illegal.

The last thing I'd mention is that while your heavy horn may have accurately reflected your startlement, it seemed to me a bit of an overreaction for the situation. The cyclist seems aware of the situation and was adjusting to you by standing up on his pedals.

Uber is a bad business partner, and I'm a party to an [unconscionably lopsided contract](http://www.law360.com/articles/705328/uber-s-contract-with-driver-unconscionable-judge-says). That's not a frothy emotional appeal, that's a judge's legal opinion (click the link). ""Unconscionable"" is a [legal term](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/unconscionable) in contract law, meaning that if a contract is so grossly unfair as to shock the conscience a court can invalidate all or part of it.

But for now, that's the contract we operate under. And as such Uber has all the meaningful power in our relationship. 

Nevertheless, until the driverless fleet is available, they need all the good drivers they can keep. Being an impeccably good (valuable) driver is the only defense I have, and even that may not be enough. So I keep my head down and keep driving while it's still good money (which it isn't in all markets, but that's a different story). 

Let's be grown up and admit that we've all made a deal with the devil. Why be shocked when the devil reveals it's true nature?

Uber doesn't do something like this randomly. These comments could be a great help in defending against deactivation, and now, suddenly, they're gone, from everyone. 

So I don't doubt that Uber is looking to purge some drivers. But who? Who would they purge and why?

A Defensive Driver’s Profile is:

1. Commits NO driving errors.

1. **Makes due allowance for lack of skill or improper driving practices of others.**
1. Adjust driving to compensate for unusual weather, road and traffic conditions.

1. **Not tricked into a collision by unsafe actions of pedestrians or other drivers.**

1. **Alert to collision inducing situations**.

1. **Recognizes the need for preventative action in advance**.

1. Takes necessary action to prevent a collision.

Yes. In the analog days you just wrote down your odometer reading when you start and when you stop. I don't use an app, I just set my trip odometer ever time I go out and then text myself the mileage.

You must also report to the IRS the total miles you put on the car for the entire year. But you can always figure that from, say, an oil change in Dec/Jan from one year to the next. 

Just make sure the deducted miles doesn't exceed total miles! Those type of shenanigans can get you into trouble -- fast forward to 10:10

The bottom line is that when entering a street you need a visual check that there is room for you, and you need to be driving at a speed that allows you to adjust if there is someone else already in your lane. You can watch from the beginning of this (long) video to see many examples of this driver and others deftly navigating similar situations created by very crowded city streets.

213,"First off, the most important question to ask is the fundamental question: **Do you like driving?** 

Do you like exploring and discovering new roads, neighborhoods, and cities? 

It's like the introvert/extrovert question applied to cars: does the act of driving or being in a car relax you and give you energy, or does it tense you up and leave you drained?

Since I was a little kid I have enjoyed road trips, and couldn't wait to get my license. As a driver I've driven hundreds of thousand of miles in a dozen or more* different countries and most all of the USA. I find driving to be fun, invigorating, and stimulating. *But many (most?) people find driving stressful, irritating and/or exhausting.* Be honest with yourself about where you fall on the Love/Hate driving spectrum before you drive for hire.

As for weekend nights, I drive a ""drunk shuttle"" as I like to call it. It's my bread and butter and I've never had a problem I couldn't handle. Plenty of problems that I've handled, just none that I couldn't handle. 

I usually head out at 10pm and stay out til 4am, often later when it's busy and I start catching airporters and people who need to be to work at 5am.  Yet many people swear this is the worst time to drive and will head home before midnight. 

I think which is right for you depends in large part on your personality and experience. 

Here's some more questions to think about:

**Do you enjoy being around drunk people or do they make you nervous and anxious?** Personally I find them amusing but many people have an opposite reaction. There's nothing wrong with that, and the most important thing is to be honest about it. If I didn't like being around drunk people I'd stop driving at nights.

**Are you flexible and patient? Drunk people require both.** I'm very easy going with them, and OK if they change their destination or their mind, don't make immediate sense, and start repeating themselves. Part of what I like doing is figuring out what they need.

**Can you draw firm boundaries when you need to without coming across as an authoritarian dick?** This is a key skill.

For example, it took me a while to figure out how to empathetically and jovially bring up the issue of vomit. Most like it when I say, ""Hey, I've been there. There's no shame in puking. Just let me know so I can pull over safely."" I think many in-car pukers are embarrassed to admit they are feeling queasy, so it helps to let them know you're on their side and you won't judge them for puking.

**Do you have a feel for how to handle tense situations *before* they get out of control?** This is really important, and I like to think I'm pretty good at communicating I'm not going to take any shit from anyone while at the same time not harshing their buzz by going all Cartman on them.

So how does all of this sound to you? If it all sounds like a big ball of anxiety producing shit, then don't bother. But if getting turned around and confused in unfamiliar neighborhoods with a stranger in the back seat who may act like a confused 12 year old one second and a belligerent boss the next actually sounds like something you could keep a good sense of humor about, then it's probably a good fit and worth pursuing.

Is that the type of comment you don't like? Cuz I've been driving over a year and I'm still making good money, despite rate cutes, thanks to experienced drivers in this sub telling me point blank when I'm being stupid. 

And remember this: Uber has the power to fuck us over and will do so any time. They'd do so tomorrow if they could deploy [a fleet of autonomous Teslas](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1098997_uber-ceo-to-tesla-sell-me-half-a-million-autonomous-electric-cars-in-2020). 

So I'm prepared for the contingency that this good deal that makes me money could disappear anytime. And even though I'm prepared, I certainly don't like it, because I like driving and I like the money, but Uber may fuck me at any time.

Disagreement perhaps on facts of this case, but not on principle: namely that the rules for uncontrolled intersections apply.

I'm disappointed so many people here are arguing some sort of primacy rule over parking lanes vs. traffic lanes when I can find no such principle in North American law. The only situations for primacy I've found refer to intersections of public vs. private roadway (public has right of way) and paved vs. unpaved (paved has right of way).

Perhaps since most private/public intersections are where parking lots enter roadways, there is the mistaken belief that in a parking lot the lane with parking has to yield to a lane without parking.

259,"&gt; This is my second week last week I made just under 20 an hour before gas. Met Detroit Piston, and had pretty good time. Let's start a post people that actually like driving tell your story.

Good for you, I'm glad you're enjoying it. Most people do at the beginning. But there are reasons most drivers don't last more than 6 months.

You had a decent day, but much of that is luck. There will be days when you never see a surge because there are so many drivers out, and days you will wait 30 minutes between minimum fares. And those are the easy to deal with adversities, just the every day ups and downs. 

That said, I do like driving. I wouldn't keep doing it if I didn't, and I'm able to make a decent $20/hr of *profit* most weeks because: 

1. I don't live in a market with under $1/mile rates. 

2. I know my market really well, and can usually find 5 to 20 high profit hours every week.

3. I work the game of bonuses, guarantees, and referrals to the max.

I track my expenses, including depreciation, maintenance and repairs, and fuel, and I know what my *profit* is per hour/week/mile/ride whatever. 

When you factor in your expenses you'll see you didn't *profit* $20 / hour. Still, you had a decent day for Detroit, probably about $12/hour profit. But over time you'll likely average out lower than that, and settle in under $10/hour profit.

But if you look back/think back to, oh 18 months ago, when rates were 50% to 100% higher than now, yet still cheaper than taxis, none of us were advocating for or ""expecting"" tips. 

I personally don't expect tips. And will happily do away with my ""no tip, no five"" policy if Uber would raise rates back up. But it's a practice borne of necessity.

We weren't getting rich on those higher rates. We were doing OK, and many of us were able to do it full time. Then we found out Uber would lower the rates at any time for any reason with no notice. How am I supposed to budget and forecast with such uncertainty?  

And at these rates there are some markets where you simply can't make a profit any more. In other markets the only profitable hours are found on Sat and Sun after midnight. So no full time option, especially with the spectre of rate cuts happening again any time.

Can you see how this drives away the best drivers? I've long argued that rate cuts are bad business, bad for drivers and passengers alike.

282,"What do you think I meant by ""have at it""? I agree completely: increase rates or reduce driver supply (∴ increasing surge) or give tips. Same net effect. 

You'd think a higher base rate and less use of surge would be a win-win for driver and passenger alike. But Uber seems bent on market domination through loss leader pricing. The problem is that the loss is borne by the drivers, not the company.

Over time you are going to see driver quality go down, and you'll start to wonder if those squeaky brakes are safe. They may not be, because at rates below the cost of operating a car desperate drivers are going eat and pay rent first. The brake job will have to wait.

Did you know while lowering rates Uber has simultaneously raised driver commission and booking fees? It started out at 20% commission and $1 booking fee. Now it's 25% to 28% commission and up to $2.30 booking fee per trip! And wouldn't you know the highest booking fees are in the cities with the lowest time and mileage rates, such that commission reaches an effective rate of 52%.*

Higher rates are the best solution, IMHO. But for now the only power I have -- other than walking away, a distinct possibility -- is this stupid passenger rating. So I'm left with my pathetic little mantra: ""no tip, no five"". 

I never said I *like* giving out 4 star ratings.

302,"You say, ""I think..."" but you're not really thinking, you're feeling. You feel this is somehow wrong, unfair, unethical, unjust.

 What is wrong are rate cuts that have slashed our income.

 What's unfair is that passengers who want to tip don't even have the option to do so in the app.

 What's unethical is until they were sued, Uber always misled the customer to believe that the tip was included -- and this myth still permeates the ridership.

 What is unjust is that drivers live in fear of a low rating, customer complaints, and false accusations.

 The good news is that passengers don't live in such fear, as a slightly lower rating has absolutely no impact on their Uber experience. 

 Uber has issued NO guidelines whatsoever for how to rate passengers. None. Think about it, they left this entirely up to us.

 And there's no equivalency between passenger and driver rating because there's nobody looking over the passenger's shoulder sending them suggestions on how to improve their attitude.

 So we have this tool and use it to inform each other if a passenger is a tipper. Should you drive 10 minutes to go pick up a passenger? Usually you wouldn't, but maybe it's been really slow. It sure would help to have some idea if they might make it worth your while.

If a passenger has a perfect 5.0 they are either a brand new customer or a consistent tipper. You benefit from that knowledge provided by all the other drivers who follow the mantra, ""no tip, no five"".

 And if it is a brand new customer, you can educate them that the tip is not included.

Also, don't expect the driver to help do the loading and unloading. But if they do help, be sure to add to your tip amount.

Be sure to mention up front that you will tip. In fact, I like to tip up front. It really puts drivers at ease and in a good mood. In this type of situation, I'd probably just fork over a $20, tell him to start the meter and relax while I do the loading and don't end the trip until I've unloaded.

324,"I track my per mile expenses and clear about $20/hr after expenses. I'm in a good market.

Here's my formula, which makes it much easier. And you'll see how it comes out much less than the deductible IRS rate.

The order of these costs is ranked from knowable to fuzzy. 

1) Fuel Cost per Mile (fluctuates with price of fuel) 

* miles driven ÷ mpg × most recent price per gallon 

2) Fixed Maintenance Cost per Mile

* Cost of oil changes and other scheduled maintenance per maintenance interval. Knowable because it's all on a schedule. 

3) Fixed Depreciation Cost Per Mile

* go to KBB or Edmunds or NADA or Black Book and look up the value of your car with current miles and 10,000 more miles. That will give you the per mile depreciation cost. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;^You ^already ^own ^the ^car, ^so ^depreciation ^for ^time ^and ^market ^conditions ^is ^a ^price ^you'd ^pay ^even ^if ^you ^weren't ^driving ^extra ^miles ^for ^hire. ^This ^method ^allows ^you  ^to ^account ^for ^the ^actual ^depreciation ^caused ^by ^the ^extra ^driving.

4) Wear items per mile - tires, brakes, battery, wipers, shocks, alignment. (Am I missing anything?)

* This gets a bit trickier, and varies greatly based on driving habits and purchase decisions, e.g. tires: $75 each to $250 each based on performance and warranty tradeoffs. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;^Keep ^in ^mind ^that ^for ^hire ^driving ^is ^harder ^on ^all ^of ^these ^items, ^especially ^brakes.

5) Non-warranty repair cost per mile 

* $0 if under warranty, and most power train warranties are now 100K miles which is the really expensive stuff. If out f warranty, take a guess for all the unpredictable stuff. It will vary greatly by make and model, and how well maintained the vehicle has been, but $500 per 25,000 miles is $0.025.

I'm paying about $0.05 in depreciation and $0.025 in maintenance and wear items (repairs under warranty). Current fuel costs are about $0.075 per mile. 

And therein lies the good news. I can run my car for about $0.15 to $0.20 per mile, and deduct $0.54 from my taxes. This brings my effective income tax rate to 0% and covers more than half of my self-employment taxes -- in other words, the amount my employer would be paying under F.I.C.A. 

And that's what makes this gig work for me, the tax deduction combined with a good car (high mileage, low depreciation, low maintenance cost).

What makes it risky is that Uber can cut my rates any time they damn well feel like it. And that's why I will always have myself in a take it or leave it position, not dependent on Uber -- and why you should not look at these $20 per hour figures and decide to buy a car counting on Uber or quit your other job for Uber or move cities to Uber.

Uber has tricked you through their relentless rate cuts to rely on surge. That's bullshit. Surge should be a nice bonus, not something you rely on. You should rely on a base rate that makes you a decent earning.

But even with the rate cuts, know this:

1. *You will get paid more with Lyft through tips.* And riders happy with this service will be even more likely to tip. 

2. ""Because passengers will enjoy added convenience, we'll make sure you’re paid a higher minimum for scheduled trips."" - Lyft email announcement. 

2. *Lyft has never lead the rate cuts.* They have followed, reluctantly, but they have never lead them. 

I'm perfectly happy to take one of these orders while you sit in a 3x surge listening to the sound of silence caused by every Uber customer clicking ""Notify me when rates go down"". And as I'm heading to my Lyft pickup, I'll wave at all the other Uber drivers wasting their money driving in to the surge zone chasing down a non-existent fare.

I bet some of you aren't even signed up for Lyft -- drinking the toxic Uber Kool-Aid of supporting the company that is killing your earnings.

398,"How many times is this going to be posted? 

In any case, here's my reply, copy and pasted all over again.

&gt; tldr; Skip to the very last point -- Uber can lower driver rates anytime, even below the cost of driving, and that's the real Uber scam.

&gt; --------


&gt; This is going to be really long. I hope you'll read it and take some time to respond. I understand it may take a few days. :)


&gt; First off, I completely agree with you that many if not most Uber drivers are seriously lacking in the knowledge to run a profitable driving business. There is a lot of common sense math involved, and you do a very good job of introducing the basic concepts. 


&gt; But the analysis in the video misses some crucial variables that can both raise and lower driver earnings.


&gt; I'll start with the good news, factors that will significantly raise earnings:


&gt; 1) The per minute charge. In your LA example at 0:41 you completely ignore the $0.15 per minute that Uber charges in addition to $0.90 per mile. That means the actual rate 60 mph is $1.05 per mile, and at 30 mph it's $1.20 per mile. That's a 17% to 33% boost in per mile earnings.


&gt; 2) Surge. In a normal shift drivers will get surge fares of 1.5x to 5.0x or more, depending on the market. Smart drivers learn to work the surge to their advantage. And since the rate cuts, some drivers will only take surge orders. Passengers may hate the surge, but Uber makes the rules (see how they cut rates, below) and drivers are only responding to what Uber does.


&gt; 3) The IRS mileage rate tax deduction should not be ignored, as you did in the video. This is for two reasons.


&gt; 3a) It's an average for ALL passenger cars on the road. Smart Uber drivers leverage this deduction by driving a car on the lean end of all three curves: fuel economy, resale value, and maintenance and repair costs. That's why so many drive Priuses, because it is in the most advantageous percentile of all three curves. 


&gt; 3b) Second, by judiciously tracking all your Uber related driving, you can reduce your effective income tax rate to 0%. This is a time honored American tax strategy -- pocket real money while leveraging LEGAL deductions to reduce your tax liability as close as possible to $0. Drivers will still have to pay some self-employment tax (equivalent of FICA on payrolls), but that is also significantly reduced by the mileage deduction. 


&gt; 3c) Here is a real life example of this tax deduction: 
$18 per hour on Uber nets $15 per hour after expenses and taxes, and that equates to $22 per hour if you were working a payroll job. 


&gt; Here's how this works. A payroll worker who makes $18 per hour pays about 33% of that in combined FICA and income tax, so their take home is more like $12. 


&gt; But if an Uber driver makes $18 per hour, they can use the mileage deduction to cut this tax rate from 33% to about 12%, or $16 per hour take home instead of $12. (Why? Because we can deduct dead head miles. See below.)


&gt; Now we still have real expenses, which you detail quite well in your video, so on my metaphorical napkin instead of $16 per hour net at the lower tax rate, let's say the actual hourly after taxes and expenses is more like $15 for drivers earning $18 per hour. 


&gt; Compared to the $12 that $18 nets you on payroll brings us to a really significant bottom line. Assuming again a combined income and FICA 33% tax rate, $15/hour net take home after expenses is more like $22 per hour on a payroll job ($15 ÷ 0.67) or a whopping 22% premium.


&gt; 4) Intangibles. The tax strategy I just outlined in detail for you is something I was taught while driving home a drunk CPA. That's right, he outlined all this for me in drunk scribblings during a 20 minute ride after a night of partying. And that's my last positive point about Uber: intangible gains and rewards. Good Uber drivers will get everything from free tax advice, to job leads, to momentary but meaningful conversations. It's really hard to put a $ figure on these, but they're real.


&gt; Now for the bad news,  I want to mention some factors that will decrease earnings that you didn't mention in your video:


&gt; 1) Dead head miles. Uber drivers don't get paid for the miles and time driving to pick you up. If you are 5 miles away, that is 5 miles of real incurred fuel, depreciation, and maintenance/repair costs. There is also the opportunity cost of a missed order from around the corner, especially if you are sitting in a surge zone. Smart drivers employ many different strategies to avoid dead head miles, but in most cities they are eventually unavoidable.


&gt; 2) Unpaid time for administrative tasks. Drivers have to keep up on permits, inspections, ride and mileage logs, and resolving issues with support. On good weeks, this can be kept under 30 minutes. On bad weeks, it can just go on and on, especially emailing back and forth if you have an issue with support or you have to drive into the office to talk face to face with someone. From an income perspective, all of this is unpaid time.


&gt; 3) Forecasting is impossible because drivers are at the mercy of Uber's rate cuts. You allude to this last point with the Detroit example, and I commend you for that, because [Edit: was ""but""] the implication for the math is quite devastating. 


&gt; Drivers are trying to run a business and increase or maintain profitability. As you mentioned, key to this is to plan for repairs and maintenance and eventual replacement of a vehicle. But how can any business properly plan if they have ZERO control over pricing? Uber will email anytime announcing that the rates are suddenly lower by 10%, 20%, 25% or more. This lack of pricing control is not only incredibly unfair, but it throws out the window all forecasting with any degree of certainty. 


&gt; And that brings home the most important fact of all: ONE CANNOT COUNT ON UBER AS A STEADY SOURCE OF INCOME because Uber can lower the rates anytime they want, even below the actual cost of driving as they have in Detroit.


&gt; If anything makes Uber a scam, that does.﻿

Edit to add:

By the way, The proper way to adjust a trip is to email support and say, ""I made a wrong turn and would like to credit the passengers $X for my error.""

Passengers and support appreciate this and builds your reputation with support as honest and trustworthy.

Passengers can choose to modify a rating then next day, and they are more apt to do so if they see an email saying you refunded $$.

But you still 1 star them if they are being as abusive as you say they were.

431,"Four day old repost? I had a long reply in that thread which I'll repost here. 

This reply was submitted to the YouTuber but never showed up in the comments.

&gt; tldr; Skip to the very last point -- Uber can lower driver rates anytime, even below the cost of driving, and that's the real Uber scam.

&gt; --------


&gt; This is going to be really long. I hope you'll read it and take some time to respond. I understand it may take a few days. :)


&gt; First off, I completely agree with you that many if not most Uber drivers are seriously lacking in the knowledge to run a profitable driving business. There is a lot of common sense math involved, and you do a very good job of introducing the basic concepts. 


&gt; But the analysis in the video misses some crucial variables that can both raise and lower driver earnings.


&gt; I'll start with the good news, factors that will significantly raise earnings:


&gt; 1) The per minute charge. In your LA example at 0:41 you completely ignore the $0.15 per minute that Uber charges in addition to $0.90 per mile. That means the actual rate 60 mph is $1.05 per mile, and at 30 mph it's $1.20 per mile. That's a 17% to 33% boost in per mile earnings.


&gt; 2) Surge. In a normal shift drivers will get surge fares of 1.5x to 5.0x or more, depending on the market. Smart drivers learn to work the surge to their advantage. And since the rate cuts, some drivers will only take surge orders. Passengers may hate the surge, but Uber makes the rules (see how they cut rates, below) and drivers are only responding to what Uber does.


&gt; 3) The IRS mileage rate tax deduction should not be ignored, as you did in the video. This is for two reasons.


&gt; 3a) It's an average for ALL passenger cars on the road. Smart Uber drivers leverage this deduction by driving a car on the lean end of all three curves: fuel economy, resale value, and maintenance and repair costs. That's why so many drive Priuses, because it is in the most advantageous percentile of all three curves. 


&gt; 3b) Second, by judiciously tracking all your Uber related driving, you can reduce your effective income tax rate to 0%. This is a time honored American tax strategy -- pocket real money while leveraging LEGAL deductions to reduce your tax liability as close as possible to $0. Drivers will still have to pay some self-employment tax (equivalent of FICA on payrolls), but that is also significantly reduced by the mileage deduction. 


&gt; 3c) Here is a real life example of this tax deduction: 
$18 per hour on Uber nets $15 per hour after expenses and taxes, and that equates to $22 per hour if you were working a payroll job. 


&gt; Here's how this works. A payroll worker who makes $18 per hour pays about 33% of that in combined FICA and income tax, so their take home is more like $12. 


&gt; But if an Uber driver makes $18 per hour, they can use the mileage deduction to cut this tax rate from 33% to about 12%, or $16 per hour take home instead of $12. (Why? Because we can deduct dead head miles. See below.)


&gt; Now we still have real expenses, which you detail quite well in your video, so on my metaphorical napkin instead of $16 per hour net at the lower tax rate, let's say the actual hourly after taxes and expenses is more like $15 for drivers earning $18 per hour. 


&gt; Compared to the $12 that $18 nets you on payroll brings us to a really significant bottom line. Assuming again a combined income and FICA 33% tax rate, $15/hour net take home after expenses is more like $22 per hour on a payroll job ($15 ÷ 0.67) or a whopping 22% premium.


&gt; 4) Intangibles. The tax strategy I just outlined in detail for you is something I was taught while driving home a drunk CPA. That's right, he outlined all this for me in drunk scribblings during a 20 minute ride after a night of partying. And that's my last positive point about Uber: intangible gains and rewards. Good Uber drivers will get everything from free tax advice, to job leads, to momentary but meaningful conversations. It's really hard to put a $ figure on these, but they're real.


&gt; Now for the bad news,  I want to mention some factors that will decrease earnings that you didn't mention in your video:


&gt; 1) Dead head miles. Uber drivers don't get paid for the miles and time driving to pick you up. If you are 5 miles away, that is 5 miles of real incurred fuel, depreciation, and maintenance/repair costs. There is also the opportunity cost of a missed order from around the corner, especially if you are sitting in a surge zone. Smart drivers employ many different strategies to avoid dead head miles, but in most cities they are eventually unavoidable.


&gt; 2) Unpaid time for administrative tasks. Drivers have to keep up on permits, inspections, ride and mileage logs, and resolving issues with support. On good weeks, this can be kept under 30 minutes. On bad weeks, it can just go on and on, especially emailing back and forth if you have an issue with support or you have to drive into the office to talk face to face with someone. From an income perspective, all of this is unpaid time.


&gt; 3) Forecasting is impossible because drivers are at the mercy of Uber's rate cuts. You allude to this last point with the Detroit example, and I commend you for that, because [Edit: was ""but""] the implication for the math is quite devastating. 


&gt; Drivers are trying to run a business and increase or maintain profitability. As you mentioned, key to this is to plan for repairs and maintenance and eventual replacement of a vehicle. But how can any business properly plan if they have ZERO control over pricing? Uber will email anytime announcing that the rates are suddenly lower by 10%, 20%, 25% or more. This lack of pricing control is not only incredibly unfair, but it throws out the window all forecasting with any degree of certainty. 


&gt; And that brings home the most important fact of all: ONE CANNOT COUNT ON UBER AS A STEADY SOURCE OF INCOME because Uber can lower the rates anytime they want, even below the actual cost of driving as they have in Detroit.

447,"I as motorist was in nearly this exact situation today, minus the collision. Cyclist shouted, I braked, collision averted.

I'm really interested in hearing people's thoughts on this situation.

My dashcam arrives Tuesday. I can't wait, especially for situation like this. Do I remember correctly? Does my perception match the objective truth?

Here are the facts as I recall:
 
  1) Almost identical positioning of vehicles.
  
  2) Cyclist was in a clearly marked bike lane.
 
  3) Busy urban area, I was moving with traffic at about 20 mph. Speed limit is 25 mph.
  
  4) I had my driver window down. This averts the collision when he shouts.
  
  5) My signal was on least 100 feet from the left. (I used Google maps to check the distance.)
  
  6) I looked in my side mirror. I saw and heard nothing. Light conditions were dusk/twilight, the light that I think makes for worst visibility.
  
  6a) I had not checked my rear mirror in approximately 50 feet. If I had, I may seen him then.
  
  6b) I did not turn my head to look back. This is probably my biggest error.
  
  7) Decelerating I initiated turn left and heard ""HEY!""
  
  8) I slammed on my brakes, bike swerved and flew past me.
  
  9) It was a mild downhill grade on a straight road, very fun to ride fast and he was probably going 35 to 40 mph. Clearly over the speed limit, because even after he (presumably) braked, he continued to fly past the other cars moving about 20 mph.

My philosophy of driving is that I *should* have seen him (6b), and that's my responsibility. But legally, I think there is shared liability, due to his excessive speed.",2016-05-06 10:47:13+00:00,d2uz48w,1.0,t3_4i2u1z,36221.0,Roadcam

Edit: Could someone please explain the downvotes? 

I'm saying that the people of Austin can stand firm and that Lyft will cave. So will Uber. It seems this law is similar to what they have in Houston and Seattle, they don't want it to spread, but they'll make it work if need be. 

And a pretty high ranking manager in Lyft told me that Austin is a very important market to them, one where they feel they have a good cultural fit that could gain an edge on Uber. We weren't talking about the regulations, but it was pretty clear that Austin is a priority for Lyft.

 It's not taxi drivers who will inundate the market. That phase is over, and many of the  ""half intelligent seasoned drivers"" you refer to actually were former taxi drivers.

 But I agree with you that the people who are now signing up are, as you imply, woefully uninformed. The ones who hope to do it full time quickly move on. Those who think it is a good full-time gig will soon get deactivated because obviously they have such low standards for life that they will get low ratings as drivers.

 And what will be left will be a constantly churning group of people who do it ""just for fun"". And we all know the fun is over with your first puker.

 My guess is this will all shake out around 2020. More and more people will come to realize that the way Uber treats its drivers is absurd, to the point that it will become conventional wisdom.

By Uber [push polls](http://qz.com/621977/this-is-the-script-uber-is-using-to-make-anti-union-phone-calls-to-drivers-in-seattle/)?  

&gt; Let me share some thoughts on the ordinance. The Seattle City Council did vote to allow ride-sharing and taxi drivers to form unions and collectively bargain. However, ride-sharing, like Uber, is a case where collective bargaining and unionization do not fit the characteristics of how most partners use the Uber platform. Collective bargaining usually takes place in situations with a workforce of individuals who have a boss, work scheduled hours, usually full-time, and intend to make that job a career. That’s not how most Uber drivers use the platform. No two Uber partners are the same: 69% of Uber drivers have full- or part-time work outside of Uber, and 11% are students. Over half who drive in Seattle drive under 10 hours per week. This is simply a case where collective bargaining and unionization do not fit the characteristics of the work.",2016-03-01 02:39:26+00:00,d0ivxbk,2.0,t1_d0iv5m1,1165.0,uberdrivers

586,"I choose my words carefully. There is no function in the software to change a rating. Therefore, no CSR, office staff, or even managers have the ability to change a rating. SEE EDIT below.

I base this on multiple conversations with all of the above. In one situation I saw to it that a passenger was deactivated, but was told even then that there was absolutely no way to remove his ratings from the system. ""Travis himself couldn't do it,"" I was told.

I have also scoured driver communities and hear this same story over and over. I have not found one solitary example of a driver who was able to get a rating changed. 

That said, the good news is that I have heard repeatedly that low ratings from bad passengers (and during surges) are overlooked when reviewing driver performance.

(I suppose a DBA or SysAdmin with full access rights to the backend could manually make the change, but that's a functional absurdism. It ain't gonna happen.)

593,"Saying that corporations *have always* existed primarily for profits is simply inaccurate. 

&gt; In fact, the first corporations in the Anglo-American tradition had nothing to do with profits. Much as it might cause free market fundamentalists to squirm, the original corporations were actually regulatory agencies, such as guilds, or local governments such as townships. (In New England, when you drive from one town into another you pass a sign that announces the year in which the town you are entering was ""incorporated."")

&gt; Later, the British Crown adapted the corporate form to what we would call today a ""public-private partnership."" The Queen wanted to lay claim to the New World, but such ventures required huge amounts of capital, and were risky in the extreme. To amass the capital, there was a need to insulate investors from responsibility for the undertaking, beyond the amount of their investment. Thus the ""joint stock company"" was born.

&gt; Individual responsibility is one of the bedrock principles of common law. To dilute this principle was an extraordinary step, one that was conceivable only for a mission that presumably served the public good. In other words, there was a direct link between the exemption from individual responsibility for corporate investors (and later officers), and the public good that the corporation was chartered to carry out.

http://www.context.org/iclib/ic41/rowe/

Corporations were originally formed primarily for the public good, and secondarily -- or no less than equally so -- for the profit of shareholders. It was only in the 20th century that [profit primacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Co.), and eventually corporate personhood, worked it's way into law.

Have you noticed that Uber's base rates have dropped? They have been lowered, multiple times, in almost every market.

Did you know that these rate cuts come directly out of the pocket of drivers? 

Many of us would rather do away with surge and set the rates simply at a fair amount that allows us to cover our expenses and make a decent wage. But it simply isn't profitable any more, unless it is surging. You should do a little research and you'll find out that Uber sets the rules, not us.

Yes. The app doesn't stop until you end trip. 

&gt; So it's always more beneficial to start a new ride? And since I'm not driving, I'm basically sitting there for $0.15 a minute while they do whatever inside the store?

The mileage rate stops when you stop moving, but the minutes keep going. 

Most drivers don't like waiting at that minute rate. But I think it's important to consider the ""bird in hand"" factor and the tip factor. 

You could end trip and wait 20 minutes and not get any pings, thus losing out on a few bucks being paid to sit and surf on your phone or make phone calls or whatever. And then there is the chance that someone could tip you for waiting which you lose if you are not accommodating.

Conventional wisdom around here: end trip, don't wait, don't do drive thrus, don't make stops at minimarts, etc.

My contrarian experience: flexibility and being accommodating can be well worth it, but not always. I generally lean towards being flexible and find it works well for me. 

You'll just have to figure out if you are conventional or contrarian. :)

And you can be deactivated (fired) if your cancellation rate gets very high. Usually you will get warned if this is the case, and it varies by market. But generally, it is fine to cancel. We do it all the time.

2. You'll automatically get paid $0.15 per minute in LA (rates always subject to change) whenever the meter is running.   That's only $6.75/hour after 25% commission, so it's not really worth it if you think there are other orders. That said, it's money in the bank and no expense (turn off your engine).

628,"There are two ""five minute clocks""

1. First five minutes starts from when you accept the trip. Five minutes after you have accepted a trip, a fee applies if the pax cancels.

2. Second five minutes starts from the time you have arrived. This used to be a swipe but now it is automatic. Most of us set a timer as soon as we arrive. If a passenger is not in your car five minutes later, you cancel ""Rider no show"" and you'll get the fee.

Of course you only get the fee if your market has a fee (some don't anymore). The fee is applied right away, so if you log in to the website you'll see it. And if you don't get a fee you should have gotten, you can email support.

IDK if the fee applies to ""pings during trip"" but I would guess it does. In your case, ""I'm fairly certain it was over 5 minutes"" probably means it wasn't 5 minutes. 

I base this on the fact that sometimes I forget to turn off the 5 minute timer, and it goes off when I'm half a mile down the road, and I think ""That felt like a lot longer than 5 minutes!""

Obviously your situation is different being at fault. But if you don't fill out the report, you'll have this hanging over your head and always be worried.

Once as UberX I was called to an eyeglass lab late at night. A big industrial lab, and I'd taken people home late at night from here. 

But this time the customer was an eye doctor who called and explained a patient needed these glasses right away, 11:00 at night for a trip tomorrow. He said that he'd like me to pick up the glasses and bring them to his home. It would be about a $30 cross town fare. I suspected, and was correct, that he tipped, too.

I was happy to fulfill this request, because it was a good fare and was presented with respect, courtesy, and clarity. I think you can see the difference between the right way of a customer making such a request and the wrong way. There's also a difference between eyeglasses and a bag of undisclosed ""stuff"".

In your situation the customer didn't explain or ask, he just put *something* in your car without consent. This is an aggressive control move designed to overcome objection by making it ""easier"" to just agree. 

When you refuse he heightens tension and tries to argue you into submission. My rule is to never get into a debate, and my motto is ""'No.' is a full sentence.""

I'm thinking that once he starts arguing, since I'm done talking a better response might be something like roll up the windows, lock the doors, pick up the bag, open your door, place it gently on the curb and pull away. 

Down the street away from the guy you cancel/do not charge and ignore all calls, texts, and pings. (Pro-tip: restart your phone. The 3 minutes this takes is enough to avoid those annoying repeat pings.) After the trip is completed, you email support reporting his attempt to use Pool as a delivery service.

Pool sucks for many reasons. More work, more confusion, more risk of downrates, all for less pay. And as in this case, the downrate came from your otherwise fine passenger when you were forced to deal with somebody else's idiocy. 

Now you know why many of us just ignore Pool requests if we can.",2016-02-11 21:47:34+00:00,czwiy5s,1.0,t3_45ahps,9316.0,uberdrivers

1. Uber is used more, but I prefer Lyft for better commission and tips. But you should sign up for both to have access to more customers. And get sign up bonuses for both. Sign up bonuses are the best money you can make.

2. No. You'll just have to accept that whenever you are done for the night you may have a long commute home. But it will almost always be the Southland. Those trips to Vegas or Stockton or whatever are quite rare, and you don't have to take them. (Lyft may have a directional option, but is restricted to using once a day? It's an ""I'm on my way home"" feature.)

3. Get a hands free mount, bottled water at Costco ($0.08/bottle, plus CRV), and some mints. I also have [blue emesis \(vomit\) bags](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Blue-Emesis-Vomit-Bag-Clean-Sack-1000ml-Qty-of-12-/151703817609), and two portable [dustbuster](http://www.amazon.com/Shark-SV75-Pet-Perfect/dp/B003VWW86S) type [vacuums](http://www.walmart.com/ip/ArmorAll-12V-Wet-Dry-Bagless-Car-Vacuum-AA12V1/28969360).

4. You've already figured it out. Yes, you can call. But also you'll see that the GPS is usually very accurate. Drive to the dot, and there they are. Meanwhile, take a trip or two just to see what it's like from the customer's vantage.

Do read up on the risks and horror stories, especially realistic pay. You're not going to be making much more than $10/hour, unless you can do some good bar work midnight to 3:00AM on Fri/Sat night.

What type of car do you have? Fuel efficiency is obviously very important. And you'll need to budget for accelerated maintenance (oil changes, tire rotations) and repair (brakes, tires) costs.

There may be long slow periods, so hopefully you can have homework and reading to do during your down times. The gig can be ideal for a student because you can study then work as the pings roll in. And if you get really absorbed in your work you can always log off.

Reports are that State Farm is not likely to cancel you, unlike Geico, for example. I don't think you screwed up. But do please keep us informed as you go through this process.

It sounds like you've got two types of damages here, under two different types of coverage. **Liability** (what you did to their car, anyone else's property, and injuries you may have caused to others) and **Collision** (what you did to your car by colliding with another car or anything else). 

[According to Uber](https://newsroom.uber.com/insurance-for-uberx-with-ridesharing/) their insurance will take primary responsiblity for the Liability part up to $1 million. That's good news for your personal insurance rates. I hope it's not bad news from Uber's view of you as a driver they want to keep insuring. Please let us know if you get waitlisted or anything like that.

State Farm may or may not cover the damage to your car, but you have to start with them, as Uber's collision coverage only applies once State Farm denies the claim. Also, Uber's collision deductible is $1,000 (Lyft's is $2,500!), so you are probably better of with State Farm. If you have replacement vehicle coverage, too, that's one more advantage of State Farm. I am really interested in finding out if State Farm will cover you in Period 2.

If State Farm denies the claim you'll then have to go through [James River/Uber](http://www.jamesriverins.com/claims.aspx), which is a pain. I don't know if your State Farm rate will go up or not. On the one hand they know you were at fault for an accident, but they didn't have to pay it, so the risk is theoretical to them. You can ask your agent and let us know.

It sounds like you were uninjured, which is great news. Also you won't have to deal with **Medical/Personal Injury** (for yourself) which would only be covered by State Farm and would be denied if they deny the Collision claim.

It is simply not sensible that Uber will terminate drivers with 4.5 stars. That means that 80% of ratings choices are bad ratings. 

4 star ratings punish drivers, while 4 star hotels and restaurants are luxurious. Even more comparable, 4 star averages on Yelp, Trip Advisor and the like are good signs. But 4 stars on Uber get you deactivated. 

As to the compensation/tipping issue, you have asserted (elsewhere) that Uber's compensation is between Uber and the driver, and essentially you have no part in it. I can understand this perspective, especially because Uber promotes it, but I think there is more to the matter that Uber really doesn't want you to think about.

Uber wants it both ways. They want you to think of them as providing full driver compensation. But then they specifically state that they are simply facilitating a transaction between you and the driver. 

But while the transaction is between driver and passenger, they exercise control over the rates, the ratings, and the terms of the transaction, while actively discouraging tipping. 

Yet this contradiction doesn't mean that this bottom line isn't true: *You pay the driver, not Uber.*

This is underscored by the fact that you specifically have the right to tip. Yes, it's in the [user agreement](https://www.uber.com/legal/usa/terms): ""you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity"". 

In fact the rate is entirely negotiable both ways, because not only do you have the right to tip, but you have ""the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider [driver]"". 

So it's a paradox. Uber both has control and exercises great power. They deactivate at will, and they change the rates, fees and commision at will. 

Then they turn around and assert in their contracts that the transaction is between you and me, and they are just a third party facilitator, similar to AirBnB, eBay, Etsy etc.

Unlike those other sites/apps, drivers are given no option at all to set prices. Our only theoretical option to negotiate for a better rate is when you are in the car. But that in itself is downright tacky, rude and unfair to the rider who has been led to believe that the price is what the price is. 

In the end we drivers are left with almost no options to negotiate rates. 

One option is to stop driving for Uber, which you've asserted and indeed many of us choose. But that's a take it or leave it proposition and does nothing to change what we see as an inherently unfair arrangement. 

Another would be to organize somehow to gain leverage in negotiations directly with Uber. This is occurring somewhat in some cities, but is a very long term process, has had little success so far, and can be thwarted easily if leaders of such efforts are deactivated.

And a third option, though not desirable, is to try to convince customers to tip. And to do that, many of us use the admittedly not desirable and unfortunately passive aggressive tactic of using the rating system, which is what this entire discussion is really about. 

It's the best bad choice I can think of among an array of undesirable choices. 

And I'm completely open to ideas for other choices, but I haven't heard one yet.

Thank you very much if you read all of this. I know it's a lot.

689,"This sub is predominantly US based drivers. Probably 95%+. I think 100% of the answers in this thread so far are from US drivers.

The best answer to your question would be from local drivers. Even within the US, the answer would be highly localized by city/market.

The answer is also somewhat personal. For example, many drivers don't like the long waits in the queue at airports. But I know some drivers who have other school or business work they do on tablets while waiting at the airport, so they make very good use of the time.

But that assumes you even have official airport access, do you know? In the US only some airports (30%?) have official Uber waiting lots. When you pull into the lot Uber puts you into a first in first out queue. Wait times vary greatly, and are frequently 45 to 90 minutes. But the rides are usually high quality, long distance rides.

Does your city have a vibrant night life? Are you comfortable dealing with intoxicated people? If so, nights are probably very good. And while there is more business on the weekends, there are usually more drivers. 

In my city I have found that Sunday nights are often very good, because there is a higher demand yet fewer drivers. Friday and Saturday you have lots of riders but even more drivers to compete with, so sometimes a lower hourly compared with other nights.

There is very little risk to do your own experimenting. You sign up and test it out yourself, with the only expense being your time, gas, and some extra miles on your car. 

I assume you already own a car. Buying a car to Uber is widely frowned upon as a bad business practice.

716,"&gt; Going forward we ask that you stop linking to uberpeople.net. This is a community to discuss our relevant issues and observations. Driving traffic away to another online forum is poor taste. 

This I honestly don't understand. 

We're reddit, as in ""I read it in the internet"" -- a community founded, as I understand it, on posting links from around the web that the user community then evaluates with upvotes or downvotes.

I have no affiliation whatsoever with UP. Look at my user profile Rut Dog over there (I'd post a link, but that might get flagged and you asked me not to) and you'll see my activity is *minimal*. 27 posts over there. Compared with 599 link karma and 1,259 comment karma here -- and 99.9% of my redditing is in /r/uberdrivers. 

I actually think UP is a pretty crappy site all-around. It is poorly designed and is littered with people spewing all types of misinformation. Aside from a very few users and specific pages, it is a downright poor resource for drivers. 

But there are a few pages, like this one with the rates (even if they are aging), and some blog posts, that are actually really good information. IMHO they deserve to be highlighted here, in the best resource for drivers, and evaluated by the reddit hive mind -- the very thing that makes reddit so valuable.

/r/uberdrivers really is the very best source of information for drivers I've found anywhere. But a big part of that is how it culls information from all types of other sites, including other online forums and Facebook groups, and that we get to evaluate those sites.

**tldr;**

The voting system generally does a fine job of reinforcing good info and highlighting bad info. 

Why does one site need to be blocked? Why the problem with this one, non-spam, on-topic site? By limiting the information available on this sub, we diminish it's value.

My theory is Uber is a huge single company bubble. They've way oversold themselves to investors, and won't approach anywhere near the $65 billion value private equity thinks they are getting.

Meanwhile, in order to create better looking balance sheets and the illusion of hyper GROWTH, they will do anything to make it seem like they are expanding faster than they are.

Uber rates and commission structure are dictated at Uber's whim, and they've been pissing us off by lowering rates and raising fees. That's one reason so many drivers leave. 

So between rate instability and turnover, a lot of people will really feel the pinch if they don't have that Uber income to help with a big payment. So they are much better off buying a car they can afford from their non-Uber income.

Are you usually selling them new or used? It makes much better business sense (on our end) to purchase used, because of the depreciation. And I'm very aware it makes better business sense on your end to sell new. 

But the truth is that used is better for Uber drivers. Non-uber drivers buying new at least get the satisfaction of having that new car all to themselves.

817,"Driver here. First thing I want to say is thank you for tipping!

Second thing to mention is that you shouldn't worry about your rating, at least not the same way we drivers do. 

Driver and Passenger ratings are not an equal currency. Uber will never deactivate a customer solely for a 4.5 rating. [But drivers at 4.5 are at risk of being deactivated.](http://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-charts-show-how-ubers-driver-rating-system-works-2015-2) 

&gt; I've tipped on all the longer rides, have always been waiting right at the pickup spot, and am always friendly and not drunk or obnoxious. I'm beginning to think the drivers who I didn't tip rated me as a 2 or 3 star passenger. Is this normal?

No, that's not normal or likely. Anyone who tips will always get a 5 star rating. *Some* drivers will use 4 stars for non-tippers, but 2 or 3 stars for non-tippers (just for not tipping) is unheard of, and would likely get a driver deactivated.

I ran some calculations, and at 6 rides you'd either have 4.3 or 4.5. So I re-ran calculations at 7 rides, and look at this:

	5
	5
	5
	5
	5
	5
	1
Average	4.4
 
My biggest suspicion is the bad driver rated you a 1 and everyone else rated you a 5. With a limited sample size a single low rating can really hurt. Bad drivers will sometimes rate 1 simply because they think they are going to be rated 1.

I suggest you go back to the bad driver ride in your account and report the issues. Don't talk about the rating, just mention how she screwed up, drove too far and made you late. This will help Uber figure out if she is a bad driver or was having a bad day.

You will probably get the trip adjusted or comped, either in a refund or in future credits. If you want a refund, say so, even if they first offer you credits or an adjustment. They will cave to persistence.

P.S. Please consider tipping a couple bucks on short rides. They are documentably unprofitable, and just a $2 tip will make a huge difference on these short rides.",2016-01-11 06:44:21+00:00,cytswz8,1.0,t3_40devi,32085.0,uber

It's way more than that. The bubble was also fed by financial institutions (credit unions mostly, unfortunately) who gave easy loans secured by medallions with inflated bubble prices.

To expand on the first comment you received: Almost every driver will be willing to take this 70 mile fare into the mountains, but it's always a bummer to have to deadhead back. And that, I believe, is what you were getting at.

You can solve this by offering, up front, a generous tip to cover his return costs. If I were doing this I'd talk to him before I got in the car and say, ""I know this is a long way, and you don't get paid for your drive back to Pittsburgh, so how about I give you a $20 tip to cover gas for your ride back?""

99% of drivers will be pleased as punch. Personally, I would give him the $20 up front. I know from being on both sides of such a transaction that this will make your driver very happy and the ride very pleasant.

And since you are discussing this before you get in the car, if his reaction is anything other than positive, just tell him you'd like to request another car. He can cancel you for free. If he refuses, and you cancel, you may get charge $5 -- but you can get that back if you really want by emailing Uber.

By the way, your chances of getting a driver from this international forum are slim. But it has been done.

That's one idea, and I'll be curious to see how it goes, starting with the council vote to approve this plan tomorrow.

So I'm not clear why you are equating them, or why you are saying you'd be angry to be 4 starred for not tipping.

As I mentioned above I'm ""not saying [You] are bad people, shouldn't be serviced, or shouldn't use Uber.""

You'd be welcome in my car. And you'll receive top level service from me.

898,"Are you equating ""blaming"" with ""rating""?

Because I don't blame, punish, or complain. That's a waste of time. I simply consider a combination of personal and economic behavior in my rating, and urge everyone else to do the same.

I drive for profit. So I rate the most profitable customers 5 stars. The most profitable customers use surge or tip when there is no surge. 

When I rate non-tippers/non-surgers a 4 I'm not saying they are bad people, shouldn't be serviced, or shouldn't use Uber. I'm just making a note to self and other drivers: this passenger is less profitable. 

Consider this the next time you get a non-surge ping from 10 minutes away: 4.7 or 5.0. Which one is worth the extra expense of the extra drive time? Which one is more likely to make it worth your while?

As a result of drivers using this standard, we now know that 5.0 riders are either consistent tippers, new passengers (who can be educated about tipping), bad pax with new accounts (that will be very well behaved because they got downrated on their previous account and may start tipping once they've read about it), or simply the most awesome people in the world.

Uber has created the top-heavy ratings formula for drivers by letting it be known that 4.6 (which rounds to 5!) are at risk. We all know this is absurd. 

But why should we follow the same standard for passengers? In fact, **Uber has left it up to us to crowd source a passenger rating standard.**

And I think it is only sensible to include economic value in our rating standard.

Positive factor in my passenger rating:

* Nice people
* Ready to go
* Long ride to good location.
* Surge
* Tips

Negative factors for my passenger rating:

* Min fare.
* Long drive to pick up followed by short trip. (doesn't matter if long drive to pick up and long ride to good location)
* Long ride to dead head location (free round trip required) 
* Being rude and disrespectful 
* All of the above can be overcome with a tip. (Yes, totally obnoxious guy handed me a $20 and said, ""thanks for putting up with my shit, asshole"". He got 5 stars.)

And no, I don't consider intoxication to be a positive or negative. It's to be expected. How they behave while intoxicated is what matters. And economics is part of that behavior.",2015-12-11 10:47:40+00:00,cxv7kjo,1.0,t3_3wb3df,34503.0,uberdrivers

In Seattle, the local city council is close to passing a law that, while it doesn't change our legal status to employees, it does provide for us contractors to band together and form a quasi-union which could then accept or reject changes proposed by Uber.

1. First off, **these symptoms only apply to link submissions**. Comments and self posts are not affected. And it is subreddit specific. I'm only having this problem in /r/uberdrivers

2. When a link is submitted it looks like it has been successful, but **it does not show up on the front page** of the subreddit. You can see it in your submissions list (and so can others see 4 below), but nobody can see it from the front page. As such, it almost always (see 4 below) receives no upvotes, downvotes, or comments.

3. **Only the submitter can find the posts through the search engine**. Logged out lurkers and other accounts cannot find it by searching.

4. One final twist: **Anyone with the permalink to the submission CAN see it.** So you can click on the filtered user's username and see their submissions.  It all looks normal, as you can up/down vote and comment. But unless you get the permalink, you'll never see any of their submissions.

I think this explains why when /u/SFUber gave you the link below, you clicked it and were able to vote and comment.

By that I'm talking about the logistics. Sometimes I've got to remind myself to take a minute, pull over if I need to, to take the notes. Being a minute later hasn't hurt my rating, and I think note taking actually makes me a better driver overall. 

But sometimes I just want to go go go. So I'm interested in hearing pro-tips on making the process as smooth as possible.

And I've posted here many many times about the importance of subtracting all expenses, namely fuel, maintenance, repairs, *depreciation*, plus finance and insurance if applicable.

But your spreadsheet prompted me to search net profit vs net income and I see that ""net after tax profit"" is a common bottom line. And now I also see why tax policy is such a big deal for businesses, leading to inversion and what not. And that oan compare certain businesses side by side to find the one that is less profitable before taxes could become the more profitable after tax, all as a result of tax policy. 

Thanks for prompting this exploration on my part.

By the way, I, too, am making about ""$20 an hour after expenses and before taxes"". We are lucky to each be in markets with decent fare structures. I wouldn't drive for under $1 per mile like exists in some markets.

I guess this screenshot is from the new driver app, because I've seen nothing like it. As a new driver you'd have no idea that a major revision has rolled out, but only in a few markets, so most of us on here have not seen it. 

The original rider app did not have the tab for rating, and did not tell you how many rated trips you had. So when you referred to a number of rated trips vs total trips, well, that seemed kind of whack.

I looked at 400 Duboce on gmaps and the front door faces the Muni station with platform and two lanes of rails, and then one lane at the far side of the street with limited access and a forced right turn. The better pickup spot is exactly what Uber suggests: around the corner on Church St. 

Being an inexperienced user, she obviously wasn't paying attention to the inherent problems of 400 Duboce as a pickup spot. But that's no excuse for the driver's behavior. He should have figured it out and then called or texted, ""Hi, I'm around the corner on Church street.""

Another part to this story, which still is no excuse for threats, is that the rider was clearly not paying attention to the app. When she says ""four minutes later, my phone rings"" that must mean she (a) didn't notice the driver was very close when her request was confirmed, (b) didn't pay attention to the the notification(s) that the driver was arriving, and (c) as a result didn't know the driver was waiting around the corner, probably a few minutes before he called. I suspect the driver had arrived within a minute of the request and was exasperated when he called 3 minutes later. 

Again, *none of this is any excuse at all for his behavior*. I've been exasperated before, by way more frustrating situations, and I never would treat a customer this way.

Suits me, as it is more profitable for us to take freeways (that aren't jammed). Stop and go is bad for fuel economy, maintenance, and depreciation.

The better gas mileage and lower maintenance costs means the faster route is generally a lower carbon footprint, too.

I do know Vegas pretty well, and I would think the neighborhood bars/mini casinos would be a boon for Uber/Lyft drivers. And Nellis. And Red Rocks. And Boulder Highway/Sam's Town, and all the Station Casinos, Suncoast, South Point. Man, it would just seem like a great place for a night driver. 

And you are going to make a killing next summer for Electric Daisy Carnival!

Someone's eventually gonna want an Uber to the Pahrump brothel. And then at the Star Trek convention, some Trekker will want you to take him to Valley of Fire, location of Star Trek: Generations. (Yes, I'm a fan. :)

1118,"But the business is run locally. And a local organization -- or a national/international organization of local organizations -- would help solve the biggest problem for organizing Uber drivers: strikes create surge, surge benefits scabs. I've really been trying to figure this paradox out. We have total freedom to ""strike"" anytime -- it's in our contracts, we work when we want to. So the only way a strike can be effective is if we have strong unity in a region. 

I've also thought that ridesharing would be a good fit for a guild rather than a union. I think a guild of drivers could perform a number of services. Driver education on how to run their ridesharing business, help with insurance, taxes, and regulation, even group benefits like personal injury coverage, deductible coverage, etc. Think farm co-op.

Eventually the guild, through a large loyal membership base, could get some negotiating leverage with Uber. And if Uber tries to screw over it's drivers, the guild members could vote to authorize a strike. 

I'm thinking members would be bound to honor a strike even if they personally voted against, but enforcement of that would be really difficult. ",2015-09-27 08:49:47+00:00,cvfn19f,3.0,t1_cveldc9,95194.0,uberdrivers
1119,"Seat belts laws are state law, and that varies greatly. There are probably some local city and county laws, too.

OR and MD, for example, exempt for-hire vehicles. Some states are primary enforcement, some are secondary. Some are front seat only, some are all passengers. All sources are below, I suggest you check them out for your state(s).

A traffic violation is not a crime, it's a civil infraction. In most states, at least -- and an interesting side note: infractions generally can't get a jury trial.

A civil infraction is not the same as gross negligence. Gross negligence is willful carelessness, and that's a pretty high bar. Liability insurance generally doesn't cover gross negligence.

I'm not encouraging anyone to stuff their car. I ask all my passengers to put on their seat belts. And I refuse service to oversize groups. It's just not worth the trouble.

But stuffing your car with 7 is not a traffic violation in all jurisdictions, and it is not necessarily gross negligence.

Be safe. Do research. Uber on.

**The single most important prerequisite to a tip is to provide truly notch service.** And remember, this will vary for each and every customer.

As for tip fishing, just like in real fishing, if the fish see the hook they're not gonna bite! There is no single phrase you can apply in every situation. But I try to *naturally* work the concept of tipping into the conversation. 

Last night, for example, my current pax asked me about other drivers, and I realized she had possibly dealt with some shady players. So I was giving her some info on how to deal with drivers, and I ended up telling her how a previous passenger had been ripped off by another driver. He got her to pay $25 in cash for a $17 fare by telling her the fare would be $40 through the app. Truly a dick. But truly helpful info for her, too. And in the middle of it all, telling how I had gotten the other pax to email support to report this jerk, I dropped in that she had tipped me. Lo and behold, $3 appeared in my cup holder at the end of that ride.

I also leave change out in the open, specifically 3 five dollar bills in the vent. Lots of people in this sub criticize this tactic, but it really does make it very easy to give change for a $20 -- and plants the idea of a tip without saying anything.

I've learned that late night drinkers coming from bars and strip clubs (not college parties) are much more likely to tip than daytime riders. They are walking out of tipping establishments, after all. Some business travellers are very happy to tip on the expense tab, but most daytime passengers are not business travellers.

One last thought -- if they ask ""Why is my pax rating a 4.6?"" let them know that some drivers will down rate non-tippers. And yes, I do this. All good customers that don't tip get a 4 from me. But I never tell my customers I do it.

It's a slimy business, and I think I know now how strippers feel. Both the slimy part, and the gratifying part when I'm counting out those bills. :)

Sorry, but your value as a customer is low, and that's what your rating reflects.

2. Did you file a police report? Your situation is truly above and beyond what Uber usually deals with. They see spills and vomit all the time, but this is criminal vandalism. I've never heard of anyong getting Uber to charge the customer more than $200, so you very well may have to sue the customer. Have you contacted an attorney? I would. 

3. You're out of luck for driving Uber until you can get this repaired. Is this something you can afford to pay out of pocket for? If so, do so and document everything, including the days that you were unable to drive. This is all part of your claim against the customer.

4. I want to reiterate something I said earlier: this really sucks, and it is really, really unusual. It's even worse that this was your 2nd day.

When this happens you get the fare up to the point of cancellation *plus* the $5 cancellation fee. 

This creates a strategy I've heard of but never used: When you need to kick a passenger out, force them to cancel. They will be motivated to do so because they most likely need another Uber home. You can even tell them that by them cancelling, it protects them from a bad rating.

What you and I get is protection from a bad rating and a $5 tip.

&gt; the parties acknowledge and agree that as between you and Company, the Fare is a recommended amount, and the primary purpose of the pre-arranged Fare is to act as the default amount in the event you do not negotiate a different amount.

First, I read this clause to the customer, and let him know I do want to take him, but I have significant dead head expenses. 

I'd shoot for $200 cash or on Square card reader for my return expenses -- up front, not so much because of trust, but because he is more likely to tip on the back end if he has paid my return expenses up front.

Afterthought: I'd also consider getting him to switch to Lyft. Decent chance I'd get commision reduction. Higher chance of tip with in app option.
If amenable, I'd also try to get him to agree to a five star rating guaranteed that I get to enter on his phone myself.

Uber will have no choice but to be more selective in hiring and more aggressive in removing bad liability drivers. That means less market saturation, so more income for us good drivers. For bad drivers who get fired, at least you'll be eligible for unemployment.

The other issue is we'll be covered by workers comp. Workers comp used to be great, but ""reforms"" have made it horrible, requiring anyone with an on-the-job injury to use the workers comp doctors and have all your treatment related to any injury denied by your regular insurance.

But that brings up healthcare, and as employees we will all be getting basic health coverage as required by the ACA. That's good.

1324,"This thread is being downvoted because conventional wisdom is ""don't buy a car for Uber"". That is good advice, and I have even lambasted people for thinking of doing so. And I don't really disagree with the people telling you not to do it.

But your situation has some special circumstances, as you outlined, so if you decide to do this, here's my thoughts.

Requirements (verify locally!):

* four doors
* four passengers, plus you
* less than 10 years old
* no body damage
* can pass a very basic mechanical inspection

You're going to be starting a business, not getting job. It will be difficult to stay ahead of expenses, especially because you can't afford a newer car. You're going to run through brakes, and have higher maintenance/repair expenses than you've had before.

Your out of pocket expenses are: 

* car payment
* insurance
* fuel
* phone 
* phone service 
* cleaning
* maintenance 
* repairs 
* miscellaneous (water, candy, gum, kleenex, phone accessories, etc.)

**Insurance is a big deal**, and most of us are underinsured. Do your research on this -- it is way too big of an issue to discuss as an aside. You may simply end up lying to the insurance company about driving for Uber/Lyft and hope for the best. That is the status quo.

It will be tough to get a good rate on a loan without income. And Uber is not income per se, it is a business with no actual guarantee of income. You may want to consider taking a big cash advance on your Visa. At least the payments will be manageable. Eventually -- hopefully -- you can get above water. But at least they can't repossess your car if you default on your credit card.

I'd look to find a 2007 that is cheap, in good condition, and reliable, like a high mileage Toyota. You can drive it for 5 months and then get another. You'll take some depreciation hit when you sell it, but at the same time you'll pass on some of the wear and tear to the buyer. This is the way of the used car market.

How about this?

Ting also allows access to T-Mobile (GSM) or Sprint. Both work well enough while driving. It's nice to have a choice, since these are the two spottiest networks, but I also make sure one phone is T-Mobile and one is Sprint so I can have backup if one network craps out.

You are always welcome to tip, just not in the app, and can certainly offer to compensate for all or part of the dead head. If you don't have cash, many drivers have Square readers, or you can PayPal or Venmo the extra payment.

You should mention the destination before the driver starts the trip because it is easier to cancel a trip that hasn't started. Some drivers simply can't be gone for, say, 4 hours, and even if you've put the destination in the app we don't see it until we start the trip. 

NYC cab drivers going to CT, for example, charge 2x the meter. I think many Uber drivers would be very happy with a 50% bonus on top of the fare. I think it will make for a smooth trip if you discuss the destination and payment when you first meet your driver.

To clarify, this is either/or, for a total of total $1M per incident *regardless of the number of victims*.

In cases where the Uber driver is at fault (unlike this accident) there is $1M total incident coverage for *everyone but the driver*. So if there are three victims, that's only $333,000 each. The driver's car is covered after $1,000 deductible, but no coverage for the driver's medical, lost wages, rehabilitation, etc.

The Uber driver is covered only when the other driver is at fault and is unable to pay, either because they are uninsured or underinsured (don't have enough to compensate you). But again this coverage is for all victims up to $1M total for the incident (same math as above).

Most likely, the BMW has good insurance, and will pay for all of this, as well as the driver being sentenced.

I sized them up, they seemed coherent and friendly, including her. She was walking, smiled, responded immediately when I first saw them with a friendly smile and she buckled up in seconds -- usually a good sign.

*One block down the road*, no turns, and she starts regurgitating onto herself. I pulled over and told her friends to get her out of the car. She was out cold! 

So the best they could do was lean her out the door but they were afraid she was going to fall on the street. That's how the vomit got all over the door.

 Her friends were so embarrassed. They were very polite, and they kept apologizing. 

 I stopped by a gas station right by my house with really good vacuums. It did a nice job of extracting liquid from the door upholstery. Then I went home, changed,  and sprayed it down with disinfectant pet stain cleaner. Then back to the gas station for extraction of the cleaner.

 It's been 12 hours and I haven't heard back from Uber. No surprise there. 

And I have to admit I was cracking up while I was just typing the narrative of the whole thing. And it helps greatly  that the passengers were respectful, apologetic, and as bothered by it as I was.

Four stars is a perfectly good non-tipping customer. You will get serviced, but you will be known as a non-tipper and may find drivers are a little reticent if you have special requests.

I picked up a 5.0 rider last night who told me had used Uber 100 times or more, so so I knew right away he was a tipper. He gave me $5 and his buddy gave me $10.

I did 7 rides last night (Sunday), mostly long runs. I got tipped on 3 of the trips. The above noted $15 on a $20 fare, $10 on a $30 fare, and $5 on a $10 fare. 

All of these tipping customers received five stars and a business card with my personal number. If they ever need a special service, I will happily provide it.

1402,"u/MooseWizard's answer was good, but I'm going unabridged. :)

**1) Credit, debit, PayPal. Access to Google Wallet and Apple Pay.** You can have more than one payment type, such as a work account and a personal account, and select a different payment for each order you place.

**2) The driver never sees your phone number, whether they call you or you call them** (explained below).  The only way they can get your number is if you peronally give it to them.

The driver can only call you when you are linked by the app, and for a short time after so they can contact you if you left something in the car. The driver calls a Google voice type number, the same number they dial every time to reach customers. This is how it allows contact but hides your number from drivers. Shortly after your ride, your number is disconnected from that driver.

After a ride you can call the driver if you have their Uber number (from the app). If you are calling after a ride, be sure to leave your phone number in the voicemail, because the Uber number still shields your phone number from caller ID -- so the driver has no way of calling you back unless you give them your number!

**3) Fares are always collected electronically by Uber**, via the payment type you select in the app.

**Tips are not included** in the fare and not allowed in the app (except UberTaxi*). You can tip cash, or many drivers will carry card readers for cashless tips. Lyft, Sidecar and Wingz, Uber's competitors, allow for tips in their apps.

 [UberX driver income after expenses is approximately 50% of the total fare](http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-customer-cost-breakdown-morgan-stanley-2015-2), and some trips are not profitable -- particularly UberX minimum fare trips and trips where we've driven a long distance to pick you up. Drivers only get paid from when you get in the car to when you reach your destination. We don't get compensated for driving to pick you up.

Uber ratings system goes both ways. If you don't treat drivers well you will get downrated, and you will never know about it until you can't get picked up because of your low rating. 

Common reasons for passengers being low rated: minimum fares, making your driver wait, making a mess in the car, no tip. Essentially, being rude and disrespectful -- of your driver, their time, their effort, or their car.

Here is a funny video that illustrates this point well: https://youtu.be/dM7Fshl0Mxg

**4) Fares vary greatly by city and service type, and they go up during ""surge"" demand periods.** Service types vary by city, and will be listed in the bottom of the app. Usually cheapest to most expensive, left to right, but you should always check this. 

Here is a breakdown of services I've heard of: 

* **UberX** - Cheapest and most common service. Four door cars, up to 4 passengers. Base UberX fares as a rule are cheaper than taxis.

* **UberPedal** - UberX with bike racks for a surcharge.

* **UberWAV** - Wheelchair accessible vehicles.

* **UberXL** - Non-luxury SUVs and minivans. 6 passengers.

* **UberSelect, UberPlus** - Nicer cars with leather upholstery, but not full luxury vehicles. 4 passengers.

* **UberBlack** - Black town car/executive sedans service. 4 passengers. (This was Uber's first service, debuting in June 2010, according to Wikipedia.)

* **UberSUV** - Luxury SUVs. 6 passengers.

* **UberLux** - Most expensive luxury service. Super premium sedans, like Teslas, and fully appointed luxury SUVs. Seats 4 to 6 passengers, depending on vehicle.

* **Surge Fares** - Uber automatically raises fares when demand goes up -- ""surge"" is what they call it. You will be told the fare multiplier: 1.5, 2, 5, whatever it is the fare is X times higher than normal. 

* **UberTaxi** - Old style commercial taxis dispatched though Uber. *This is the only service that includes a tip in the app. Surge doesn't apply to UberTaxi, as taxi fares are regulated and/or set by the taxi company, not Uber.

Uber isn't always the best at clearly stating base fare, but you should be able to get an estimate through the app. The estimate will include surge if surge is active.

Uberpeople.net is an independent website that tracks rates. They generally keep this up to date, but they are not affiliated with Uber.

**5) Driver rating: 5 = pass, 4 = fail.** You didn't ask, but you should know: drivers can be deactivated if their rating drops below 4.6. ALmost certainly if they drop to 4.0.

1403,"This sub has a lot of useful information in it. Try searching, reading old threads, reading top all time threads.

I agree with /u/Won_Doe, and will just add a few more comments.

The gold standard of any for hire driving is you take the route the customer wants. Some will always want freeways. Others streets. Some will want you to drive like a church lady, others like a New York cabbie. Best answer: go with *their* flow. 

It's a business, not a job. You have expenses. And you have to handle taxes as a business. You'll need to budget for more maintenance and repairs. And however long you think your car was going to last you, it will need to be replaced sooner. 

Not sure what you mean about ""nights"". We generally think of nights as the drunk shuttle. 9p to 3a. I don't get the impression that's what you mean.

The income can be very inconsistent. You shouldn't expect to make much more than $9 or $10 per hour when you average it all out and subtract expenses. It's possible to make more, but it requires a fair amount of savvy, and a flexibility on your end to work the hours where the demand is highest. 

Depreciation is a real expense, too. The IRS estimates total cost of fuel, maintenance, repairs, and depreciation to be about $0.56 per mile.

You can increase your earnings by driving for all the rideshare companies: Uber, Lyft, Sidecar. Also Wingz (scheduled airport runs). Postmates deliveries. Other stuff like that (varies by city). More apps = less down time. 

Do you like driving? Do you like meeting strangers in close quarters? These are two important things to consider that many don't. 

You'll want to get rideshare insurance, which will probably be more expensive. Search around for that. 

It is a nice job for people with erratic schedules. Only experience will tell you how consistent the business is in those hours. The job can be really stressful if it is your primary income source, and the slow days can be terrifying if you are counting on making $X in a shift to pay the rent.",2015-06-22 09:33:17+00:00,csem3h7,1.0,t3_3aht1l,176227.0,uberdrivers

Of course I'd never be so rude to a passenger. I'm being direct with you because you are posting here with concerns about your rating, and I think you may have a blind spot to your behavior. 

As to how the ratings work, I'll spell it out for you what /u/pornymcgee and I were saying.

**The time period reflects when the ride occurred, not when the rating was input.** If today a rider enters a rating for a ride you gave 3 weeks ago, it will only affect your 30 day average because that is when the ride was.

There is a perfectly logical explanation for what you are seeing. Here it is:

* Your 1 day average of 0 means nobody rated you for any rides you gave in that time period.  Since not rating doesn't impact your average, these non-ratings cannot have impacted your 7 day average.

* The drop in your 7 day average that you noticed in the last 24 hours is from a ride 2 to 7 days ago but was only entered in the last day.

It happens. It has happened to me.

Like I said, focus on being a good driver, which really means focus on how you interact with the passengers. This is what I do, and it's been working great for my rating.

1420,"Uber never tells you what a rating is for a specific ride. At least not in a pay summary or in any emails. All you see is an average. I have never heard of any way, other than sitting down with a manager who is willing to bend the rules to help you out ,to know 25 individual ratings. 

I got a manager once to review three trips for me. Turns out instead of three ones I had 1 one and 1 five, and the other guy was not there (he'd been deactivated, to the ride and rating was removed from my history).",2015-06-16 09:29:14+00:00,cs8747w,3.0,t1_cs5tif4,197782.0,uberdrivers
