------------------------------------------

I've been driving over a year and I'm shopping for a new car.

My current car has fabric and I like it. At first I was worried the fabric would wear out quickly, because it showed some pilling after the first month of rideshare driving, but then it never got worse and has held up very well.

It seems modern fabric synthetics may actually be more durable than leather. Am I right that leather is more prone to stretch, sag, scuff, and crack?

Leather would probably be easier to clean up spills but is prone to staining, and Scotchgard does a fine job of preserving fabric. 

Also, leather can be uncomfortably hot and sweat producing in summer, cold in winter.

This is a closeup of a Michelin tire with 8/32nds of 10, and DOT production date in 2014. So a pretty new tire from a reputable brand.

Picture is of the same tire, left and right, where right side shows normal wear and left side shows oblique 45° abrasions on the very small tread on the outer edge.

I can post more pictures if helpful, but it is pretty much what you see here.

I don't know what caused this. Peeling out? Donuts? Accident that caused the car to travel sideways?

In all the comments of that thread, I didn't see any driver that said they themselves have had a fare reduced.

Here's some food for thought:

1. One tweet from one person is hardly a trend.
2. Uber sometimes gives credit for future use, which Tweeter could claim was a fare reduction.
3. Uber can credit the passenger without debiting the driver. This has been discussed here in the past.

Drivers are not receiving summary emails, but they are available if you use the link below. Unlike Uber, there is no realtime ride data on the dashboard. It comes out in daily summaries, usually around 8:30am, but the emails did not come out today.

Customers were unhappy, but they *were* notified. Simple $30 trip to the airport cost someone $90. I'd be pissed too, but the right thing for Lyft to do is satisfy the customers with refunds or credits and pay the drivers what we earned. It's their software error, not ours.

But recently I was a passenger and the driver who picked me up had the Google GPS voice Bluetoothed through the car stereo -- along with the music he was playing! 

He had  a 4.8 rating and said in his 100's of rides nobody has ever complained. He also said he's putting in 50+ hours a week.

Everything other than the GPS voice was a perfectly good ride. I told him to get that infernal voice out of my ear, for crying out loud, and then I disclosed that I'm a driver and I would give him a five star rating and $5 tip (which I did) so he'd feel comfortable.  

We had a pretty easy and open conversation about it (once it was off, lol). I told him how annoying I found it, but he insisted that not only has nobody complained but they seem to like knowing he's following the GPS. 

I'm inclined to believe him but baffled nonetheless. Baffled it hasn't seemed to impact his rating and that nobody has complained about it to him.

I even mentioned this to a few of my customers in the following weeks, and they all agreed with me that it would be annoying and said they've never experienced it.

I had technical issues with my camera, but it seemed to work in the end. 

I was especially annoyed with myself because I had vomit bags at home and had just sent myself an email reminding me to get them in the car!

EDIT: I have clarified the wording above about the extent of the mess. Thankfully it was isolated to the door, but it soaked into the door upholstery. Ugh.

I really appreciate the support here. Thanks everyone.

UPDATE: 16 hours after first report I have still heard nothing. I'm not surprised. The fare is now $0, was minimum, and my one day rating shows they gave me a 1 star. 

I had held off giving them a rating (because they had been nice I might have given 2 or 3) but they fired first, so now they have a 1 star. 

I sent a follow up email since I had all the photos on my phone (thank you, r/Uberdrivers!).

 
RESOLVED: Full $200. Fare reinstated. Nothing they can do about the rating.
