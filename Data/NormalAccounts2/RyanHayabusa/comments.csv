3,"When I was in Japan we had a huge Marine truck crash into an early 90's Mazda RX-7. I responded to the first reports of it happening. They were still digging the RX-7 passengers out when I arrived. So as you probably know we're never supposed to leave our gun anywhere we can't reach it. If you do that's a NJP waiting to happen. Thank God I had a thigh holster. I strapped it to my riggers belt and had my duty belt on over it. I was able to take off my duty belt and help dig with my gun, but without it hindering me. The man driving survived, his girlfriend in the passenger did not.   ",2016-09-16 16:34:05+00:00,d7pf13z,7,t1_d7pehiu,668,videos
