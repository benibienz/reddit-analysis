From what I saw there are no leaks, a/c blows cold, no rust, only taking a brief moment of sputtering to turn on. (Maybe just spark plugs). Only one headlight and the rear lights work. The cluster is not the original and there's no way to know the mileage. The inside had this cover on the seats. He said underneath it was bad. The interior isn't great by any means but it's clean. A few cracks on the dash. The car definitely needs new paint and body work. His price is $2000. Nice price or crack pipe?
