I know it looks good, but the everything else about it is really bad.

122,"As a lot of people have said, this is mainly used in programming because computers store values in binary (base 2), but hex (hexadecimal, base 16) is much easier to read. The system you're used to is the decimal system which is base 10, but the thing to keep in mind is that the number systems all represent the same thing. 5 goats (decimal) has the same value as 101 goats (binary), but one is much easier to write than the other. 

In decimal, you can with one digit represent 10 values (0, 1, 2... 9) while in binary you can only represent 2 values with one digit. When you get to 2 digits, you can represent 10^2 (number of possible unique combinations of two digits) unique values. In binary, you can only represent 4 (00, 01, 10, 11). 

If you wanted to represent in binary (what a computer uses) a customer's bank balance of 50000 you would have to use 2^16 digits (65536 possible unique combinations) which as you can imagine is a pain to read. This is an occasion where you would want to use decimal, but binary to decimal conversion while possible (and quite easy- you can do it by hand which I'll add a bit of explanation for at the end) isn't pretty. Instead, we use base 16 (because 16=2^4). because there are 16 possible values for each digit, and 16 possible values of 4 binary digits, each hex digit essentially represents four binary digits (or bits). The 50000 bank balance from before can be written out in only 4 digits of hex (c350, if you're wondering) which is much easier to read or punch into a calculator to convert to decimal than the binary equivalent (1100001101010000).

Now for converting between number systems. First, think of base 10 as you learned it in elementary school: you've got a unes column, a tens column, a hundreds column, etc. These are all poweres of ten- ones is 10^0, tens is 10^1, hundreds is 10^2, decimals are 10^-1 , and so on. The same principle applies for pretty much any number system. In binary you've got a 1's column, a 2's column, a 4's column, 8, 16, etc. 

19 in decimal can be thought of as (1x10 + 9x1), and in binary it's the same but with powers of 2 instead. You start with the larges that fits into your number (16, or 2^4) and put a 1 in that column (we now have 10000) which leaves us with 19-16=3. Largest power of 2 that goes into this? 4 is too large, so we use 2 leaving us with 10010 and 1 left over to ""move"" to binary. 1 in decimal is just 1 in binary so 10011. Now if we wanted to add one to that, we would do it the same way as one would in decimal- add one to the one's column. this brings us to 10012, but there is no 2 digit in binary so we do it like in decimal and carry it over as 10020 but there's another two so we make it a zero and add one to the next column which leaves us with 10100. 16x1 + 8x0 + 4x1 +2x0 + 1x0 = 16+4 = 20, exactly what we would get with 19+1.

Computers use binary because it can be represented as an electrical current which is either on or off, but this is done on a low level. There's stuff built on top of this which allows us to use decimal numbers instead (As you can see above, conversion is pretty easy) because nobody wants to use 4 digits to represent the decimal number 12, and way more for larger numbers. so it's easier to just write it in hex as c (hex uses letters as digits for 10-15 after it runs out of decimal digits). Because 16 is 2^4, any amount of hex digits will always represent that number times four binary digits. Essentially it allows for some of the benefits of the decimal system (being shorter to represent numbers) while also converting digit-for-digits into binary.

1.  As long as they arrive in the same place, does the chemistry they use to get there really matter? If a hot stove hurts me to touch, but hurts you when short range IR vision in your fingertips gets too close, can either of us say that the other is not feeling pain?

2. and 3. Again with touching a hot stove, but pulling one's hand away is instinctual. It's not as though you learn that it's bad to touch, it just happens instinctively in response to stimuli, but you still feel pain.

154,"As someone from r/mk I think it's a number of things. First, the switches. They're not ""faster actuation gaming switches,"" they're just cheaper. This is not bad, a lot of really nice cheap boards use gateron switches for example to make a cheap mech. It works for people who can't afford better, and gaterons are pretty good switches. The problem is that it's not a cheap keyboard. If you're paying $150+ board, might as well get one that's well built. Speaking of construction, there's the stigma of poor qc that comes as a standard warning on most forums I frequent about razer products. Then you've got the borderline spyware software. And for all that, the board itself doesn't even look that good (to me, at least.) r/mk seems to prefer more understated design to the gaudy razer aesthetic. The font on the blackwidow X is a step in the right direction, but it's still pretty heavy on the flashy lights and sports a triple snake logo right in the center. That's not to say RGB isn't cool, but certainly not worth $70, especially not to a group that I would guess is predominantly comprised of touch typists. 

Razer keyboards are like Beats, they're not a bad product. Compared to $80 ones, they're a pretty nice set of headphones. Unfortunately, they're priced at 300 and supported by essentially convincing the public through massive amounts of marketing that they're worth it. Neither is a bad product, but they're not worth the price. Seeing people buying razer keyboards is like watching someone at a grocery store buying a cart full of Just Water. Sure, it will hydrate you, but the traditional type is like fourteen cents a bottle for a twenty four pack instead of a dollar a bottle. I would use a razer board if it was $75 and that was the most i could afford, but at $150+ there's simply so many better options.

272,"Thanks! Since that's hard to remember let me write a quick (for real this time) Akagi cheat sheet-

**Ron**- whoever calls it just won off of the last discarded tile

**Tsumo**- Whoever called it just drew their winning tile

**Tenpai**- Being one tile from victory

**Chi**- Taking a discarded tile to make a straight

**Pon**- Taking a discarded tile to make a triplet

**Kan**- taking a discarded tile to make a quad (counts as a triplet, but flips an extra dora tile_

**Dora**- each one greatly increases the value of a hand

**Mangan**- first point limit hand. It's sort of the uncommon rarity where it's nothing special, but also very worthwhile to get.

**Haneman, Baiman, Sanbaiman**- in order higher versions of Mangan. These are big hands

**Yakuman**- Really big hand usually with a special form of hand

And one I forgot in that last part: **Richii**- A special form for a hand that allows any group of four melds and a pair and makes it valid, but comes with the downside of having to announce that you are in tenpai, wager a thousand points (that's why he throws the stick on the table), and have no ability to change your hand, only to win. 

**Yaku**- a form that a hand fits into. Multiple can apply to one hand, so it is fine to call richii on a hand that has a triplet of dragons although not always advisable.  Most mahjong words you don't know will probably be types of yaku.

**Han**- The value of a yaku or dora, used in 2^2+han.

**Dora**- Each hand a tile is flipped on the wall and the next tile after it (6-pin would indicate that 7-pin is dora) is worth 1 han just for having in hand. Two is worth 2 han etc.

275,"Quick rundown: 

There are 3 suites each numbered 1-9, a tile for each wind direction, and then read, green, and white dragon tiles. There are 4 of each of these tiles for a total of 130 or so. To complete a hand you need 4 groups of 3 tiles (called *melds* in English, these can be 3 of the same tile or a straight of 3 in the same suite) and a pair of one more tile. In Japanese (alternately called riichi) mahjong your hand also has to fit into one of many forms which range from having a triple of dragon tiles to having a hand made up of only tiles with green on them to having a triplet of all four winds. The harder a form is to achieve the more points you get for it, with some really rare ones (such as the four winds one) being automatic point limit hands. Scoring is calculated from what makes up the hand and then multiplying that by 2^2+form ^bonus+ ^number ^of ^dora ^tiles (one tile is chosen each game to be the dora tile). Just remember that really intense facial expressions in Akagi usually meant that the hand is rare, and you can sort of tell what's happening based on how the cop (Yasoka?) and boss react. The game goes in a circle with players drawing a tile then discarding it or one from their hand to take it in. The fun part is that you can use an opponent's discards to add to your hand by calling on them (these are the KAN! PON! and CHI! you see) but it requires you to open that meld (group of 3 tiles) of your hand and many of the forms that your hand goes into do not allow you to call. A normal hand has 13 tiles, while 14 are required for a winning hand, so you can win either when you draw your winning tile or when someone else discards it. If you win by drawing you call *tsumo* and all players pay part of the winnings. If someone discards your winning tile you call ***RON!*** and they pay all of it. Being in a state where drawing or calling on (Ron!) a tile will allow you to win is called being in *tenpai*. It's like being in senpai, but even better. Games are played in sets of 4 rounds, playing first east then south rounds to make up one *hanchan*. Then they go again. Back to point limits, the 2^(2+stuff) formula is capped at 8000, and then is just done in steps- 8000 is called mangan, haneman is 12000, baiman, san-baiman, and then finally the highest point limit hand is a yakuman. Many rulesets, including Washizu mahjong, allow for multiple yakumans such as getting the four big winds (four triplets of winds) which also satisfies four little winds (three wind triplets and a pair on the last wind) which is why (/s ""Washizu gets 96000 points on that one hand""). Dealer's wins are multiplied by 1.5* in value, and if a dealer wins the last game of a hanchan they can choose to play another ad infinitum until someone beats them. Players can also make guesses about what others are going for based on their discards. That was not short in any way. I tried.

394,"No, it really wouldn't be too hard from a game programmer's standpoint. Honestly, I could see it becoming standard in ten or so years to have support. The reason it's easier to do 3 levels is that the game doesn't know you're doing anything differently from someone who is actually pressing both ctrl and w, so it just reacts the same way it would to someone doing it. It has a certain type (or types) of inputs it can take like mouse+keyboard and, if it supports it, controller. The way to get this going it basically to fool the game into thinking that the keyboard is a controller and then telling it that the analog stick is pointing to (however hard the w/s key is pressed expressed however it would be from a controller) in the y axis and (however hard the a/d keys are pressed) in the x so that you basically wind up saying that it's pointing that way. Unfortunately, some devs don't include controller support on PC even though it really isn't too hard, and nobody expects you to use a controller and a mouse for movement/aiming so some games with controller support don't support using both controller and mouse at the same time which is why it might more difficult to use the keyboard and mouse with controller-type movement rather than simplified keyboard-type movement though some games definately do already support it.",2016-08-30 00:36:12+00:00,d71z414,15.0,t1_d71ykrw,778.0,MechanicalKeyboards

445,"I've never owned a mech keyboard before (been using the CM Storm b/c the mouse included was decent enough, though I've since upgraded to a Corsair m65), but this year I'm taking some classes that give me access to some pretty nice CNC machines so I figured I could make a lot of the parts and then build one at a pretty low cost. Is there anything wrong with the current plan?

The current plan:

* Case: Machined out of a dark wood (should be easy enough)
* PCB, switches, feet: purchased. Switches would be Cherry, by the way. Are O-rings, springs, or dampers required when building a keyboard? Will it be horrible to use without them?
*Plate: Machined from aircraft aluminum (also should be easy. Available metals are Aircraft Aluminum and Brass). I mean, it's literally a plate with cutouts, right? I've heard of plate mounted switches, do PCB mounted ones attach to the plate or does it just sort of fit over them and protect the PCB?
* Keycaps: 2 sets both machined from Aluminum with laser engraved and then filled black lettering. Font something like Times New Roman with a refined old-timey sort of look centered horizontally and placed on what I guess would be stage back of the top of the keycap. 2nd set same but blank to really get into the habit of touch typing. 

&amp;nbsp;

The goal is to wind up with a keyboard that has a similar aesthetic to a datamancer keyboard but a bit lighter on the steampunkeyness. The case would be a fairly standard rectangle type deal sort of like [this](http://65.media.tumblr.com/6561b6c5cfab43503969b480da571132/tumblr_ny3bvdLVwa1u475ako1_1280.jpg). Oh, and 87-key would be the layout. I've noticed that I could do with a space reduction, but getting rid of arrows is a bit of a stretch for me and I don't really like the look of a 60 (yet). So some final questions:

* Am I forgetting any parts?
* Anyone know where I can find some data on measurements or premade files to use with masterCAM? STLs for keycaps are easy enough, but plates/cases haven't turned up many results. I can also cut the end off of a 100% (in software) or add to a 60 or something, but I can't find a single one.

Wow, that turned out long. Thanks r/mk! Your wiki is great!

What's GPU utilization at? Overwatch (I assume tomb raider too but I've never played it) allows for limiting the refresh rate (this can be done in Nvidia's control panel too) so it might be set either in game or in drivers to not render more than that. Oh, also see if render scale is set to higher than 100% in OW which it might be on ultra preset. It effectively renders the game at higher resolution if it is so you might be pretty much running it much higher than 1080p. ",2016-07-14 01:58:37+00:00,d5bf833,1.0,t3_4r912f,798447.0,PCsupport

787,"As another reply said each plug is shaped differently so as long as you plug everything in correctly (and there aren't that many. As cables go there's front panel headers for the power button, USB ports, and audio (probably also reset button) on the front/top of your case. Then there's power which is 1 cable to the motherboard, 1 cable (usually split into two parts) to the CPU, and one to the GPU. Then finally there's fan headers which are for... fans.

Then (this part is actually done before) you have to put in the CPU which is the only place you really could break something accidentally by bending a pin which is as simple as lining it up with a square socket and putting it in. Then the RAM just fits right into a slot as does the GPU. Then a cooler on the CPU which is just a few screw or some sort of mounting system and you're done. I really hope I'm not forgetting anything.

The GPU is big and hard to break and the RAM is usually covered in metal (heat spreader). The motherboard PCB is pretty strong, too. As for frying something the motherboard steps down the voltage to whatever a component uses on the way so to even get power to a CPU (easiest part to fry) it has to go through 3-12 VRMs (Voltage regulator modules which keep it at a safe voltage unless you change it to be stupidly high in the BIOS which even then sometimes limits it to a reasonable range.",2016-04-28 17:48:37+00:00,d2kykfg,3.0,t1_d2kkjo1,20961.0,AskReddit

&gt;In actuality, EVERY programming language is ultimately compiled into the low level assembly code (which is even further reduced to binary 0s and 1s) that is specific to the machine it is running on. Assembly code for a TI-89 calculator is different than for a computer and usually based on the processor (or microcontroller) that is responsible for actually interpreting the assembly language machine codes.

To add a bit, this is sort of like telling the 15 year old that he needs to go get a gallon of milk. He then thinks ""gallon of milk"" and remembers back to when he was 9 and remembers that ""get gallon of milk"" is made up of more basic instructions such as walk left. His 9 year old self remembered that walk left is an instruction that required him to take a step. The nine year old self (and 15 year old by extension) remembered when he was six he needed to know that taking a step meant lifting and moving a leg forward and this goes on until you reach the most basic level of instructions which would be assembly.

922,"I was trying to think of computer builds (I'm happy to answer questions about PC building if anyone has any) that might be cool to do and had the idea to grow a case or, at the least, the framework for one. After some of the beginner pages on the wiki, I realised something. Two things, actually.

Firstly, bonsai looks like something I could enjoy for what it is rather than a means to an end. Secondly, right now is when I should start a tree (or seven) and every moment I wait is a moment of this fine early spring that is passing me by. 

I was wondering what a good species to learn some basics of keeping a tree alive for a year would be so that I could start growing a case next year, and for when that happens what would be a good looking tree. 



Bonus section for those wondering about the computer build (I estimate two people and one of them is me) I'm thinking roughly a cube (depending on branch length) with one corner pointed down (imagine a cube flat on a table then turn it 45 degrees over the y axis then z axis) into the trunk which would probably be vertical to help support the weight of a computer. Three branches would along the three sides that point towards the bottom. The build would be mini-ITX because that's all that would fit inside a custom made case that would fit the branches, possibly made entirely of glass though some metal sheets could also happen. I suspect cooling will he a hardline custom loop with XSPC parts if they keep to their aesthetic in 10+ years. I was thinking leaf color could match the loop color, and the color of the bark would give me probably the only opportunity I will ever have to use Noctua fans in a show build.",2016-04-02 04:45:49+00:00,d1mp0d4,1.0,t3_4c7i0c,454935.0,Bonsai

If I wanted to overclock, a z170 chipset would be needed, but even then a $80 motherboard would be fine and work just great. The only differences between that and a $400 insanely high end motherboard would be better power delivery for overclocking and features such as I/O, more PCIe slots for SLI/XFire, OC buttons with an error code readout, etc. etc. If you mean x99 motherboards which only run i7's (and xeons) those are enthusiast grade and can still be had in the $120-150 range which is not too bad, but they do tend to go higher than ""consumer chipset"" (4 core max unless there's a 6 core haswell xeon I'm forgetting) board.",2016-03-31 05:47:47+00:00,d1k4eja,5.0,t1_d1k3p20,1736.0,explainlikeimfive

Also, if Loser gave Kyouma the super-needle thing, couldn't he just one-shot the monster? Didn't it reach some stupidly high speed that made it into crazy amounts of KE?What if it wasn't Sophia and he just sent them a big tentacle monster? Really, they have no way of knowing that it's her and what's the likelihood that someone can become a big tentacle monster?

999,"Around 1:36 screaming was heard coming from the culprit's house. When interviewed by police later, a neighbor said they heard the sound of a knife being sharpened and screaming which is what prompted them to call the police. The police, when nobody answered, broke down the door and were faced with the bloody corpse of beloved charity worker Roboragi. ""This was premeditated murder,"" announced the police department ""Ryou is still at large, but we are watching all known animeme dealers. We are sure that he will show his head within a few hours."" 

When questioned, his neighbors said said ""He had not talked to us for a few months, but you could always see his curtains drawn. I don't know if he ever left his house. He always seemed like the kind of person who would do something like this."" At this point there was a noise around the back. Rushing over there, the crew found a message scrawled in human feces on a trashcan which read ""your waifu."" We are still unsure what it means, but the chief of police assures us they are working day and night to break the code. This has been Channel 6 news at 9.

1040,"Water has a high specific heat capacity and thus doesn't heat up much  (temperature) per amount of energy that it takes in. Difference in temperature is important in the speed of heat transfer. It's good at taking in the heat, but moving the heat through the water without moving the water doesn't do too much much because the temperature delta is really small. It's fine for moving heat from copper to water and back, but moving heat if it were stationary would take ages. It's amazing with the use of a pump, but without one it would be one of the worst liquids you could use.

Distilled water is pretty much the best fluid you can use (I guess you could try nano-fluid instead of dye if you wanted) with a bit of anti-corrosive and biocide added in there. You can buy custom coolants, but they don't really improve it by much and are often also just dyed water. Personally, I use distilled water with a dye/biocide/anti-corrosive all mixed in. There's a group working on a liquid metal cooling loop now that's going to cost a few thousand for less than a liter of the liquid that is going in and it will still probably be worse than the same system done with water.",2016-03-16 15:07:27+00:00,d120gwc,6.0,t1_d11wwpi,5746.0,explainlikeimfive

All the other characters have skills that let them regain their health, but the closest Zer0 gets is 24% (when low) on melee kills. He is made to do huge lumps of burst damage, and you should stay behind cover when not in deception (aka. huge damage w/o taking any mode) because any damage he takes is there to stay. It can't really be regained without using the gear I'll mention in the next paragraph. It's best to just not take any damage. This is, of course, impossible, so you should try to not take more than your shield can handle (specifically, one bullet) if you plan on healing. Once you get hit, hole up like a turtle until you can use deception again.

1380,"I never understood why they took 2 ammo. Was it a nerf to the grog 4 DLC's early?

I like using dahl guns with good bursts, but the ones with lower bursts just breaks it for me. My level 9 veruc is one of my favorite guns for the early game because it gets a burst of 5 (maybe 7-9 bullets hit, though), and I absolutely love using the standard repeater (dunno why for that one. I just love starting new playthroughs with it.), but when I get a really good purple one and it fires a 2-round burst, it's just a deal breaker. Semi-auto I can use. Those I can't.

Now that I think about it, yeah, they do. The Greed is a lot of fun to use, but it only comes in fire. Semi-auto is enough of a gimmick in my opinion. The always normal type thing bothers me because I pretty much always use the most effective element, and while the crit boost helps, I feel that it's balanced with small magazines already and doesn't need to be non-elemental too. It does fit the theme to be non-elemental, but I would rather just have elemental weapons. Or at least a few legendaries that could come in all elements. Hell, that's enough of an effect for a legendary assault rifle- just being able to be elemental and maybe having a slight increase in damage or accuracy.

1384,"I completely agree with maliwan pistols. Design-wise, they're some of my favorite guns in the game, but early game when you have a low ammo capacity the 2 ammo per shot just doesn't work. Neither does the magazine of 3-4 shots before a reload or the low fire rate. I would either give much larger mags or highly increased damage (maybe lowered splash to compensate?). I like the idea fo splash damage, but I can't really use it. At all. It does nothing for me.

I completely agree with Dahl, though I would add larger bursts. A burst of 2 does not work. I would have a better fire rate hip firing.

I would like to see a Jacob's legendary or two that could be elemental or just elemental Jacob's with higher damage reduction in return for elemental effects. It's something like a max of 30% for normal guns, right? Jacobs could do with more along the lines of 45 to compensate for the lowered damage.

Hyperion needs to not make sniper rifles. They might get increased stability or a faster return to *normal* accuracy, but I would rather just have an assault rifle from Hyperion than a sniper.

I don't really know what to do with bandit. I would just outright change it. Maybe something like them releasing a weak nova on reload or something? Maybe they could have natural bullet penetration? Actually, if they kept the large magazines, they could build damage (to a limit) the longer they fired. *shrug*",2015-11-10 17:56:36+00:00,cwvj2mg,1.0,t3_3sa8bm,7902.0,Borderlands

1415,"The thing with UVHM is that it's like a lesser version of OP levels -not meant for everyone playing the game. First off, it's the third playthrough while many people stop after one. UVHM is, to quote, ""Gearbox's first kick in the crotch to casuals."" 

First off, you're not going to get rid of having to slag. For UVHM, it's there to stay. Mandatory. Building up with a bee and all that jazz to make your build powerful enough to not use slag just isn't worth it. If you don't want to spend most of your time in hiding, the first thing you need to do is get rid of the bee. A single hit on that thing forces you to hide for 5-7 seconds while it recharges. No wonder you're having a problem with spending too much time in cover. 

The slag rubi you said you had in another chain is your god (unless you can get a grog. That's even better.) Learn how to healthgate if you can. I'm not saying you should use it exclusively to survive like some builds do, but it can really help survivability if you keep over it most of the time. Maybe have a rubi equipped at most times and use it to stay alive when you go into a room with a lot of enemies or something. Basically, in UVHM, your shield is (when used properly) an offensive item. In TVHM and NVHM, using the shield to take some hits to keep them off your health worked. In UVHM, enemies will break through your shield. Often, they will do this in one bullet and then do some damage to your health. Your shield will not be able to take all the damage anymore, and you'll need a way to heal the health you lose. The shield in UVHM, defensively, isn't a way of preventing damage so much as mitigating the amount it does to your health bar. The reason to be above health gate is that you can take damage very quickly in UVHM. Imagine some bandits get lucky and three bullets hit you just from enemies. The first does 4/5 of your shield. The second breaks through it and does heavy damage. The third is a KO. If you're above health gate, it gives you a chance to get to cover and hope your shield is strong enough to hold up long enough for you to heal back above the gate, or to just heal then and there if you have a grog out.

To make math easy we'll say you get a 10% damage boost per stack (yeah, yeah, I know). Once you're up to 50-75 stacks, you can one shot most enemies. That leaves something like 75 enemies you can kill assuming you pick up no ammo or see no vending machines. Boom.  done. 

Melee Zer0 is just as powerful because he can use any gun between his melees (if you have time between melees) and does amazing amounts of damage when played right, though the setup is a bit complicated.
