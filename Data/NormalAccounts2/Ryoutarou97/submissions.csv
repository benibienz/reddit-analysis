I was wondering if there was a way to return AutoCAD to a tab-based system instead of having each drawing as its own window. I don't really need to look at two at once, and having the extra space where the window frame is would be nice.

The farmer glanced around guiltily for a moment but quickly regained his composure. ""Look at those goats over there,"" the missionary said, pointing at the village's livestock which were horses.

After my placement games on day one I was ranked 44 and did decently. I feel that I've improved at the game since the launch of comp- my accuracy with McCree is consistently around 50-60% up from an old average of around 40% or lower. I can take out my targets fairly well as Genji, though ulting could use some practice, and I think I fulfill my role as most characters I play. I stopped playing competitive for a while, though a Hanzo main played on my account in the interim and dropped me to 27.

I decided later on to keep temps on screen to see how my fan curve was working out at stock speeds because I hadn't really needed to OC it yet (no GPU yet, probably going for a 470) and then I ran into the problem. It worked fine and there never were any problems (still aren't), but when I go to check the temperature of the CPU every program either doesn't display it (HWMonitor, MSI's ""Gaming monitor"") or says 0 (Overwatch info in top left) which I assume is a default value if none is reported. I considered that the sensor might be broken, but when I check in BIOS it reports reasonable temperatures so I don't think that's it. Looking this up, it seems there was an issue on some older AMD chips, but nothing from intel really had this problem. Does anyone know what might be causing it?

If I just get Re-ACT (BTW, where!? Assuming Amazon isn't the best site b/c $80 for Actress Again and no listing for Re-ACT is pricier than I would expect it to be) will it include all of the original and then the extra arcade mode storyline?

Does Act Cadenza have the storyline and can I get itinstead of Re-act?

And then Actress again seems to be a separate game without any overlap with the previous ones. Is that right?

TL;DR
Where do I get these?
Where do the games overlap? I mean, can I pass on buying any of the games because they're included in others?

I don't plan on playing them just yet (got to read Tsukihime first) but would like to know which ones to get in case I happen to come across a secondhand copy to buy.
