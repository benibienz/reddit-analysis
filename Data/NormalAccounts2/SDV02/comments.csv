56,"&gt;  I just think this movie is doing too much too fast.

Why is that a bad thing?Movies like harry potter and lord of the rings too have many main characters in one movie yet each one is given due justice.

and then you say..
&gt; Is the 'hate' against DC warranted? In my honest opinion, yes and no. Yes because it should not have taken them this long to get all of these characters together.

That is exactly why this movie is ""doing too much too fast"". Because  otherwise we would get a justice league movie only in 2020 if they spend time setting up each character in solo movies. And if DC would have done that they would have been accused of copying Marvel. 

&gt; Marvel has set up something that you SHOULD want to copy.

No its not. They have definitely made some amazing movies but they have many bad movies which just exist to set up the Avengers movies. For example movies like thor, the first avenger, iron man2 did nothing except introducing characters (thor, captain america , black widow,hawkeye,coulson) which would be used in later movies. Or the dark world where they do nothing except introducing an infinity gem. We don't want such fillers in DCEU which only set up the next movie. Heck, even AOU was busy setting up black panther, ragnarock and infinity wars.(granted even bvs is setting up justice league but still it'll be a consequence of the destruction in MOS and the conflict b/w batman nd superman) Also they never answer questions like why doesn't any avenger know that coulson is alive?(why is he alive anyway? loki clearly turned him into a f**king kebab) Why dont the avengers turn up to save the president when he was in danger? or when malekith was destroying london? why only one avenger has to deal with these problems? Cities are destroyed and no one cares.And I don't even have to explain how they handle their villains. Basically they follow the same template for each movie. Marvel had a good concept of a shared universe and I think DC is improving on it instead of merely copying. What you feel looking at the ss nd bvs trailer nd the ww footage is that they have their own different flavour yet look like could exist within the same universe.

Last thing,(i know u must be tired by now) DC was late off the blocks with the cinematic universe thing 'cause Nolan had created a realistic universe where these god like characters couldn't exist. Even because of that we got an amazing batman trilogy and the only oscar a CBM has ever received for acting. ",2016-02-27 00:10:38+00:00,d0f8xh3,2,t1_d0f3opp,8477,DC_Cinematic
