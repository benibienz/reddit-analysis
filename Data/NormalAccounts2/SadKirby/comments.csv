As everyone here has said, Pheromosa is super broken and is 100% getting the ban hammer the first time around. Pheromosa is checked by very little, namely Aegislash, but U-Turn + HJK is a very potent STAB combination. Clearly the star of the Gen 7 meta so far. 

Aegislash is the same overcentralizing powerhouse is was in early Gen 6 OU. There's really no reason to not be using him on your team.

Tapu Koko is really strong as well, and is an amazing revenge killer. A scarf set puts in a ton of work on just about every Mom in the tier. Ground types can take a bit of predicting, but Grass Knot covers things like Hippo, and HP ice snipes the ever obvious Landorus switch in.

Landorus-I is as good it always has been. I have switched from running Rock Polish to Calm Mind, as a +1 Landorus can break through about every Pokémon not named Celesteela. 

Incineroar has been the most surprising member of the team so far. I only put it on the team because I liked him and the physical Fire/Dark typing, but I wasn't expecting him to be the monster that he is. An AV set + Intimidate with max HP and attack makes him a good pivot with U-Turn, and he can take hits from things like Life Orb Greninja's Hydro Pump, and kill with Darkest Lariat with a bit of prior damage. Super underrated, he gets at least one kill in just about every battle I've played so far.

Ferrothorn serves as the ever-reliable Stealth Rocker and mixed wall. Leech Seed + Protect wears down a lot of potent threats, and Protect is especially useful for racking up HJK miss damage on Pheromosa. 

Overall, I think this generation is super fun and cool. A ton of the new Mons are really good and will be real threats in the new meta, despite some inevitably being banned (Cockroach Queen). I think the changes in game mechanics, all the buffs and nerfs, and the introduction of strong, new Pokémon with cool new moves and abilities will make Gen 7 a really interesting generation.",2016-11-19 19:50:49+00:00,da7aap1,1.0,t3_5dqltx,59231.0,stunfisk

When some of them become actual brothers, you'll have an in at one or a few of the frats, and if you text them early enough in the night, they might be able to get you in from time to time.

Second, try and make friends with a group of girls (don't try to bang all of them, you need them to actually want to hang out with you), and go out with them. A lot of places on less crowded nights will let guys in with a good radio (2-3 girls per guy should be fine). Me and my best friend did this with a group of crazy chicks my entire freshman year and it worked fine.

Third, and your best bet, is to ensure you have good dorm parties is to buy a pong table and put it in your room. That way people are gonna be drawn to coming to your room to party. Devise a system to hide it if RAs ever knock on your door. Stash it under your mattress over breaks when inspections are done. 

Unfortunately, bars are pretty strict and vigilant for people with fakes, and house parties aren't really a viable option until later years unless you know someone older with a house or apartment.",2016-08-28 02:28:29+00:00,d6zirx0,1.0,t3_4zwnst,13167.0,umass
11,"**Fixing the formatting for the people who don't want to use the annoying scroll bar to read the post.**

Before I unravel the tale of this mighty fudge-up, I would like to say that I am not a great karate student, suck at conversations in general, and this will contribute in many ways to the story. Also, this my first TIFU, so give me a lot of feedback to make sure it's my last (hopefully).
 
I walked into the dojo on Friday, and proceded to get warmed up with the other students. Now, my crush sits right next to me, and she's a really nice girl, but assertive (she could prbobably beat my ass) Whenever she looks at me, I try to act like I've mastered the move we'd been doing, to which she laughs. Our sensei comes in, does the usual yadda-yoda, and casually drops that we're doing the roundhouse kick. Heh, can't be that bad right? Another instructor comes up, they bow to each other. One of the instructors lets out a ear-screeching ""Hyaa!"" and Miyagi-style back slaps the other with his foot so hard he staggered back.

What made me almost poop myself is that the instructor who got hit NEVER shows pain. Oh snap. The teacher then tells all of us that we need to replicate it. Double snap. He tells us since we're all mature enough, except for a few jerks, we can pick our partners. Now there's more guys than girls so things can get competitive real quick. One of the much taller guys (curse that slick, wavy hair) asks her to joust with him, to which she politely declines.

In no known universe would I think that she would approach me, but she did. As she skipped over, I tried to act like I didn't notice. She standed semi-closely and asked ""Hey, I dont have a partner, would you be mine?"" I mustered up the strength to say  ""Yes"" and she smiled. After bowing, we started practicing, and she was GOOD. Like, Jet-Li-is-your-father good. After a couple minutes of catching light-speed kicks, it was my turn. I got ready to deliver a killer roundhouse. Braced, let out a short scream and kicked. My overconfident show-off self forgot to hold my left foot down, and I immediately began to fall. I must have knicked her in the face, because as I got up, aching, I saw her on the ground, bleeding from her nose. Shit.

The wavy-haired kid burst into laughter (fuck him), but the teacher was helping another student and oddly didn't notice. She sat up, worried, and asked ""Are you O.K.?"" as a trail of blood treckled down her face. Bewilderment in my faceI told her she was bleeding and helped her get up. We walked to the water fountain, she rinsed her face, and I got a tissue to stop the blood flow. ""I am really sorry for hitting you in the face"", and she replied ""It's all right. You're a really good kicker."" After class, we're sitting on the steps outside, and I ask her if she would like to grab a bite at the Subway across the street tomorrow. She said ""I would love that."" She said bye, hopped on her bike, and rode away. A date? Sweet.

tl;dr practiced kicking with my crush, kicked her in the face, got a date",2016-08-27 22:16:17+00:00,d6za336,1.0,t3_4zuiyt,26691.0,tifu

You also don't need to run a Scarf set, a bulky set for slow U-Turns might even be more beneficial.

59,"As a sophomore, you get priority over juniors and seniors for selecting a suite. Contrarily, juniors and seniors get priority for selecting apartments over you, so I would say it's a low chance, even if your priority number were really low.

This is about prevention, and the state and local governments cannot provide the aid needed to prevent a catastrophe of such a scale from happening.

77,"That's what I'm saying. Neither deserve a ban, but they do only when paired together. But most high level players, the ones that are gonna vote on this, are so vehemently against any form of goth stall in any form or variation that they might vote to ban both, which would be annoying to see a Pokemon like mega Sableye go (don't care for stag that much).",2015-11-24 17:47:05+00:00,cxblcro,8.0,t1_cxbl7pf,199.0,pokemon
78,"Unfortunately the suspect is on Sablenite, not Shadow Tag. What I think is unfortunately going to happen is people are going to see the meta improve because of the Goth-stall team being gone. The problem is Shadow Tag + Sablenite, and I don't think either should get banned, but only when used together. Sadly I think they're both getting canned, as this is the biggest frustration I've seen people had with a team or Pokemon since the Greninja suspect test, even though it can easily be solved via a very specific clause.

Too many things in Ubers can straight OHKO it for it to ever really be viable. The people who try to use it are either just bad at teambuilding or are trying to fill some sort of terrible niche, doubly since you know what it's going to do when you see it on a team preview.",2015-11-24 16:57:12+00:00,cxbj9tf,4.0,t1_cxbhsos,2133.0,pokemon

A lot of the themes and a lot of the plot mirror the things Aziz talks about in his stand up (ex. creepy dudes following women, being a first-generation kid with immigrant parents), but it's implemented really well and the entire show seems natural. Writing is really great, and has a lot of awesome jokes, but has its serious and somber moments too.

My last bit of advice would be to apply for early action, which helps your chance of admittance, and guarantees you your enrollment much faster than regular admission does.
