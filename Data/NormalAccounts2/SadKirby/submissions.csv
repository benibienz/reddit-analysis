I counted the number of work days left until the last day packages were accepted, and it was 14, so I figured unless it was delivered on the very last day, I would be able to get my package. 

Well, the Wednesday of finals week comes and it hadn't arrived. I assumed they would just send it to my house, since I remembered getting paper mail forwarded to my house from school the year before. But it's the middle of July and I haven't gotten it yet. So: does anyone know what they do with packages they receive during the summer? If I end up losing it it's not a huge deal, the thing I bought was like $10, I'm just curious to know what happened to it.",umass,does Anyone know what happens to mail over the summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/umass/comments/4trbvi/does_anyone_know_what_happens_to_mail_over_the/

One of those mons I just always wished had more going for it. So I thought if Wigglytuff were to get a mega, it should get Pixelate as its ability. That, along with some buffed defenses (and maybe lowering its speed by 10 points), could give it base stats that are something like 140/70/90/110/90/35. 

That type of bulk, coupled with STAB-boosting Pixelate and an amazing movepool would send Wigglytuff straight to OU. Hyper Voice would hit as hard as Sylveon's. It could be run offensively with coverage like Ice Beam, Focus Blast, Psychic, Fire Blast, and Thunderbolt, as a cleric with Wish, Protect, Toxic, or Heal Bell. That type of versatility, along with two weaknesses that it can strike back at for super effective damage would make Wigglytuff a major threat. I just really think this Pokemon could be amazing if it were to ever come to fruition, but just some food for thought!",pokemon,Mega-Wigglytuff Ideas,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/3ptlyy/megawigglytuff_ideas/
