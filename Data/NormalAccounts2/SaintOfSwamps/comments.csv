1,"I was a bit stunned so my reaction was a lot slower than it should have been. I've played on PC a few times and the difference is noticeable, but I'm not in the financial space to buy a PC. Hopefully the aiming changes fixes some of the issues we have with aiming, especially turning around.",2016-10-07 19:43:47+00:00,d8ib7sp,3,t1_d8iannt,702,Overwatch
2,"Definitely has dealt with every thing you've listed. The hits not registering with his ult is by far the worse, and most prevalent. So many times I've died because of it, and it's even more noticeable now with the reduced ult time. Hope these issues are addressed sooner than later.",2016-09-03 17:33:47+00:00,d786ib0,1,t3_50yvwi,13304,Overwatch

If you look through their gallery they're pretty consistent using this style, typically with reds and greens. I've been admiring these images for years and would love to learn how to do it.",2016-07-15 14:31:08+00:00,d5dbr60,1,t3_4st4xr,91657,photography
4,"At the moment I'm shooting portraits, typically natural light. Fashion and boudoir specifically. I know a big draw to the A6000 are it's focus and 11fps but unless I fall into shooting concerts again I'm unlikely to use those features too often, with different lenses of course. One big thing I love is the ability to shoot video as its a feature absent from my 5D completely, also the 5D Max's out at a native iso of 1600. I think I'm going to go ahead with the a6000 the more I think about it. Wifi, focus peaking, evf, video, the tilt screen, the size and weight...I think I'll get more use of it than my 5D where the size alone is enough to discourage me from taking it along to trips.",2016-05-21 06:58:10+00:00,d3dwjuy,2,t1_d3dvmj0,2983,photography
