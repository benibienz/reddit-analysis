However immediately upon signing up the app closes and now I can't log in due to my account being disabled. Attempts to fix the issue have gotten nowhere due to instagrams awful help Center that will not so much as send an email when it says it looking into it. Is there anything I can do here? Is this a known problem?,Instagram,Account disabled immediately upon registration,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/4qp3gq/account_disabled_immediately_upon_registration/

Photography has always been a my main goal. When I was in high school, 21 atm, I was lucky enough to be accepted into a very well established photography program for two years. It was wonderful. I have experience with 35mm, medium format, and 4x5 film photography including developing and printing it myself in a darkroom. This is important for later. I fell in love with photography because of film. Of course we moved into digital, using canon aps-c dslrs and studio equipment. I'm very thankful I've had that experience. Fast forward 3 years after graduating and a bit of college for Fashion Design later (this didn't work out, for many reasons.) And I'm finally finding my passion again. This brings me to my current dilemma. I currently own a 5Dc and a 50mm f/1.8 stm. Sad to say I never take it out. I don't know if it's the weight, the lens, or something unrelated. I've been looking into mirrorless as 4 years ago it wasn't much an option but it's really evolving. I wear glasses so EVF is a godsend, the portability ensures I'll actually carry it more and of course, adapting vintage lenses. So here's what I'm asking. Should I sell off my 5D and 50mm and go for mirrorless while I'm not heavily invested in the system, or should I just grab an 85mm f/1.8 but possibly have the same issues I'm having now. If I go with an A6000 I plan on grabbing the 44-2 helios, smc takumar 50mm f/1.4 and a 24mm prime (not sure which.) I know the photography field is a cruel place, but I'm more than willing to put the work in.

Forgot to mention I shoot portraits and still life.

TL;DR: A6000 with vintage lenses or 5Dc with 50mm &amp; 85mm 1.8",photography,"Buying an A6000, vintage lenses?",https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/4kb440/buying_an_a6000_vintage_lenses/
