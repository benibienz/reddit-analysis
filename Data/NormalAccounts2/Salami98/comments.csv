32,"KS has been great, no question. Sometimes you don't always mesh well with other players, I am not saying I didn't, though both of us have started scoring way more since I left and joined ANA. 

Also, regarding my teammates, honestly I am shocked at how good they are. We have been playing well and games have been really close, such as 5-4 last night against STL etc. Luck is a huge, annoying factor in this game and everybody knows that. Likewise on STL games would be very close and we would lose by one goal often, the teammates were great too.

I don't know what to say, I missed a season, I am not playing the best I can be and it shows statistically. Though, if you think the issue is with my teammates it is not.
