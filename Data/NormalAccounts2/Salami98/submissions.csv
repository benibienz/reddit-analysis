Changes:

1. If puck is behind red net, it will reset in front of the red net in a random spot.

2. Grounders mode, shoots all pucks low.

Values:

Shot Speed = .20 and &gt; (Decent values, play with them)
Shot Timer = 3-7 (In seconds)

Thanks, panda, dab on em', poo poo.

Well, wipe those tears off your face partner! Yeeeee'hah! The Hockey? Puck Receiver Mod is here to take that problem and flush it down the toilet! Hail Caesar!

[Download Here!](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vp9kvqasdp4yof7/AAB5QrDNo6YFBSFbqnIj_tVha?dl=0)

1. Run Hockey?
2. Run ReceiveMod.exe in the Puck Receiver Folder.
3. Kill Gabe.
4. Enter your pass speed and timer interval values. (Pass Speed is the value of how fast the puck is passed, and the timer is the rate of which the puck will be passed)
5. Click Start!
6. Enjoy!

How it works:

1. Pucks are randomly spawned on the map and then passed to you with the values you put in.
2. If you select ""Accuracy Mode"", the next puck will only be spawned if you hold the puck for the ""Possession Time"" you entered. Ex. 3 = Possess the puck for 3 seconds and then the next puck gets passed to you. Also, it disables the normal passing mode when you hit the check mark.

Basically, this is made to just help you receive pucks from different spots on the ice. If you are alone or have issues receiving pucks from behind you then this could maybe help. I am shit at receiving pucks still and this could maybe help, I don't know. I know it's pretty buggy, and turning while the puck is passed can make it difficult to receive or get close to it. Any suggestions would be *fucking lit*, and would help me know what to add or fix, etc.

Thanks, dab on em' brother! Hahahahah! Smh 100. 100.


Good Speeds etc:

Pass Speed: 0.09-0.12

Timer Interval: 6-8 Seconds

***EDIT***

Took FatSquirrel's suggestion, pucks now will only be spawned around the red net/zone, not from both sides. Thanks Fat &lt;3.

I realized throughout this game, that it isn't how much you score in a LHL game, or your +-, it's all about having a good time. Even though I am the best fucking player ever to step on DTMB (JK ffs, dont yell at me dalfan), I realized that I don't need to get worked up over a video game. I would like to apologize to all the people I played with throughout all the seasons because of my cuntish attitude and difficulty when losing, I hate losing. I am overly competitive and that is what eventually broke me this season and ruined my performance and feeling for the game. I want to thank all the people that played with me also throughout the seasons of LHL/HQML/NationalGames/Etc, it was a fucking blast and I have experienced such a good group of people. From Season 1 getting drafted by Dallas and being traded to NJD, from Season 7 getting drafted by Dallas and being traded to NJD, I guess this is where it ends, where Brodeur should've retired. Thanks again for all the great times a video game has brought to me and fuck her right in the pussy.
