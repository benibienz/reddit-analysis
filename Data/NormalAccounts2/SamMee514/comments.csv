5,"You may have played their games, but you clearly have no actual deep understanding about any of them. The idea that a game has to have ""talents"" or you can auto-win by playing zoo is seriously ignorant and you honestly don't really have an open mind about playing new ones. 

Sure, you don't like OW, WoW or Hearthstone, but does that make those games bad? No, you just don't like specific facets of the games because they're too easy for you or something and you're not smart enough to actually do some thinking to realize that maybe they are more than what's actually on the surface.

I really don't care if you've played ""thousands of hours"" of WoW, you're just a salty vet player complaining that maybe Blizz is trying to cater to a more casual crowd.

6,"&gt; Overwatch has extremely simple mechanics and no way to diversify hero playstyles. Very few and bland maps.

Every single Hero in OW has a different play style lmao

&gt; Hearthstone is fairly fun, but the mechanics are generally very simple, and far too often the winner is who gets to play a minion first.

You have no idea what you're talking about 

&gt; World of Warcraft is a complete joke now. It's a MOBA with PVE content.

I have no idea what you mean by this

I really don't think you play any of these games or actively participate/read in any discussion that's going on currently. You're just trying to be a contrarian because it's cool.

122,"Did you even read my reply to your other comment? It's much more than just that. 

Say that I wen't 6 gate (which isn't even viable anymore) and you went for three hatch before pool. You scout my opening, and see 6 gates being made. You immediately cancel your two other bases and put down you pool. I, because I saw your scout, can either continue with the rush or cancel it because you will be ready to defend. This is where branching occurs- SC is not 1-dimensional. 

Say that I canceled four of my gates, put down a forge + robo + natural base. Now at home, you're building lings instead of drones, and you're on one base. I now have the economic lead and can pull ahead early in the game. 

Say that I didn't cancel my gates, but you got lings out fast enough that my warp wasn't ready- now I have some zealots that are chasing down lings in my base, killing probes, and I don't have a natural up. You put down a base and queue drones behind it- now you have the economic lead. 

StarCraft is *not* ""X player did this, X will win"". It's much, much more complicated than that. ",2016-11-01 15:52:12+00:00,d9gxsxh,5.0,t1_d9gxgbl,412.0,dotamasterrace
123,"&gt; It's hard because all the micro you need to do

That's just not true at all. Build orders, money management and scouting are all important factors in StarCraft. 

I don't scout your zealot rush? I lose. You don't scout my Battlecruiser transition? You lose. You don't spend your money correctly? You lose. 

There is a much smaller room for error in StarCraft compared to DotA, as the responsibilities are distributed through 5 people and not just one person. 

You play like absolute dogshit in DotA and still get carried. In StarCraft, if you play bad, you lose- that's it. 

I don't think you can call DotA harder if you know absolutely nothing about SC. ",2016-11-01 15:00:11+00:00,d9gv6q9,4.0,t1_d9guxi3,313.0,dotamasterrace

159,"If you're in a TvT and your opponent goes mech after you have opened bio, you have to decide whether or not you want to keep going bio or transition into mech. If you want to go mech, just start making facs- f course your mech army would get up much slower, but it's still possible. When you play mech versus mech, visibility is very important and so is positioning. If your tanks are caught out of siege mode or your siege line doesn't cover a ramp up to your third, you are gonna be in a world of hurt. 

On the other hand if you want to continue going bio against mech your best option is to not engage directly with the mech army. Utilizing drop harass with bio against mech is great since your opponent's units are very slow, so picking them apart and not engaging them head-on is a viable option.

That's just not true at all. Please explain why it wouldn't make sense to remove Nazi/alt-right shit to garner more business. You clearly have no understanding of marketing. 

&gt; And linking on mobile is starting to bring you the the full mobile website that loads 10x slower then the direct link, cause it's feel of ads. 

Like I said, linking directly bypasses ads, and if you're on a competent mobile app you don't have to visit a browser anyways, so getting to the mobile site isn't an issue.

&gt; Either way this is practically better imgur see why complain?

I'm ""complaining"" because slimgur was made in response to the fatpeoplehate drama- their fee-fee's were hurt because their posts kept getting removed (same with TD). Slimgur *also* was a way for the mods of the subreddit to gather money from ads, so it's actually pretty funny that you're even complaining about ads on imgur at all.

234,"&gt;  Pretty much any way you look at it, that's upper class.

I'm not going to pretend like I know how much her family made, so I'm not going to comment on it. 

&gt; These emails reinforce the idea that she is a out-of-touch, corporate-backed centrist.

I don't think anyone is denying this at all. Anyone who actually believed that Sanders pushed her to be more left outside of her debates with him is probably writing in his name on the ballot anyways. 

&gt; Having the people be reminded that she and the DNC are still in bed with corporations is not good for her campaign.

I don't agree honestly. A lot of on-the-fence independents/republicans could see this as a positive and vote for her because of these things. 

I don't think she's going to deny she's more of a centrist than as left as Sanders if you asked her straight up honestly. 

None of these emails have been even close to damaging, if the debate questions and headlines are anywhere indicative of that fact.

235,"&gt;  she pretended to come from a middle class background, and then said she was far removed from that background because of how much money she and Bill have now

First of all, the email clearly states that she never ""pretended"" to come from a middle class background- she says she did in the email, **but now** (meaning currently) she has moved away from that background because of the money she has now (read the email). 

I'm not saying that she isn't in bed with some Wall Street people, and that it's somehow ""okay"" that she receives money from big donors, I'm saying that *it's already known to the general public that political representatives receive money from some rich people.*  

Is CNN probably trying to downplay Clinton's ""bad"" sides? Probably. Are any of the emails that CNN is saying not to read actually that bad? Not really. 

&gt;  this is basically ""don't look into our sources because its 'illegal'"", and it could set a dangerous precedent

I agree with this, and I really expect to see an apology or clarification or something come from CNN soon (I hope). The more I watch the clip the more it seems like an off-the-cuff remark from the reporter, and not something that was written on the teleprompter.

None of the emails I have seen so far have been bad at all. Please link your worst. 

&gt; it's no big secret that CNN is a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, it wouldn't be a huge leap in logic to assume that CNN is abusing its position to do damage control for the Democrats

I wouldn't be surprised if this was true, but at the same time it's not too far-fetched to assume that the people who wrote that had no fucking clue what they were talking about (and assumed that leaked documents were illegal), just like the ""4chan hacker"" thing. 

CNN doesn't really have a great track record when it comes to being on point anyways lol. 

And like I said, until the federal government says ""it is illegal to view these documents"" I wouldn't start worrying about anything that CNN says.

[Here's some more information:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cuckoo#Breeding)

&gt; The common cuckoo is a brood parasite; it lays its eggs in the nests of other birds. At the appropriate moment, the hen cuckoo flies down to the host's nest, pushes one egg out of the nest, lays an egg and flies off. The whole process takes about 10 seconds. A female may visit up to 50 nests during a breeding season. Common cuckoos first breed at the age of two years.",2016-10-04 04:26:52+00:00,d8d5b6s,1.0,t3_55p5oa,35453.0,Birbs

Some more background from the YT description: 

&gt; One day after a carjacking suspect opened fire on officers, the Chicago Police Department swiftly released dramatic dashcam videos from the incident. Police say the videos show Charles Lawson, 24, firing a gun out of the stolen vehicle’s window. A bullet hit the pursuing squad car, grazing the officer behind the wheel in the face. Lawson continued to shoot at another responding squad car and officers in that vehicle returned fire, police said. Lawson was not hurt. He crashed into a parked car near 100th and Eggleston. He appears to toss a gun out of the window, before he's taken into custody. It happened around 10 p.m. Tuesday.

&gt; Police say the pursuit started after Lawson carjacked a vehicle at gunpoint. He is now facing a long list of charges including four counts of attempted murder, aggravated battery, possession of a stolen vehicle, aggravated hijacking, and aggravated fleeing and eluding. Lawson was already on parole for armed robbery. “During questioning, he admitted to stealing the car to use it in a retaliatory shooting, later that evening,” said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.

&gt; Johnson said the injured officer is expected to recover and just weeks ago that same officer was featured in a good deed picture that went viral. Chicago officers good deed goes viral: How they helped this disoriented woman Chicago police released the videos as part of the criminal investigation. The Independent Police Review Authority is also conducting a separate use-of-force investigation into the officers’ actions.

&gt; “This just goes to show how dangerous policing is,” said Johnson.",2016-08-18 12:30:22+00:00,d6mhx3n,1.0,t3_4ybzd0,69.0,Roadcam

[Zara Larsson, MNEK - Never Forget You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTyN-DB_v5M)

All of these songs are in the top 50 in the USA right now. Go to exactly one minute on Luna's song and play it, and then go to one minute on all of the songs I linked (0:49 for Calvin Harris' song and 1:30 for Mike Posner's). 

It's pretty popular to have this formula in American music right now:

* Vocal intro
* Vocals
* Buildup
* ""Drop"" instrumental
* Repeating a phrase/word during this ""drop""
* Repeat

Which is exactly why people like me are burned out on EDM/American pop music. I just listen to trance now if I want an electronic music fix.

1439,"**1. Good Luck - 8.5/10**

I think this song is much more mature than their other songs. Someone mentioned in the MV thread that it wasn't ""cute"". I definitely agree with that but I do think that they're maturing as a group and this is the stepping stone for that transformation. I think it's really catchy and it's 100% going into my playlist. 

**2. 10 Seconds - 8/10**

Again I really think that this a much more mature song. I'm really digging what they're going for and this song really plays off of Good Luck really well. Good vocal parts for everyone. ~~Weirdly I didn't hear Jimin the entire time, but maybe I just have to listen through it again.~~ I listened again and I heard it and she was wonderful! I also heard some 80's-like bass thumping which was pretty awesome. Really like this song. 

**3. Cherry Pop - 7/10**

Bass line immediately caught my attention with the cool-sounding vocals. Choa really showed her range here. I really think this is a deviation from the two previous songs as I feel it's more silly/fun. Definitely a ""summer"" song and I can see myself bumping this on a beach :\^). Pretty dank tbh. 

**4. Crazy Boy - 8.5/10**

Can I just say it's super weird not hearing Bravesound in their song intros? Crazy Boy started off pretty strong with Choa's vocals turned up really loud lol. I think this song is very strong by itself and it's produced fairly well. Has a more ballad-y feel somewhat. I could cry to this tbh. JIMIN OUTTA NOWHERE. Her lines were delivered great (as always). I really dig sappy songs so this really shined for me. 

**5. Still Falls Like The Rain - 8/10**

Another sad song! Really like the intro and the prod sounds a bit like Crazy Boy but without the guitar. Again, Choa fucking kills everyone with her range. Really interesting chorus and you can hear Chanmi! Omg Jimin sad rapping MY HEART. Really really like her part. I'm probably gonna cry to this song too. This and Crazy Boy is very reminiscent to their 5^th Mini Album with really strong vocal songs and relying less on the production. 

**Overall 8.5/10 SamMee approved 👍👍👍👌👌👌**

1739,"The quote:

&gt; I’ve been working with @sodapoppintv to build a list of top streamers that have pledged to come back and stream WoW again if Blizzard does legacy/progression servers. He just finished a stream where he got to level 100 in a day, and level 87 or so in just 4-6 hours. He did it to make a point. Where is the satisfaction in that? Where is the fun? It’s too late for Blizzard to radically change current WoW to recapture that, but they can bring back older versions that do satisfy that need. And that is what I think is really driving this, the combination of a) more meaningful leveling and progression mechanics and b) nostalgia for the old content and game systems.",2016-04-19 17:01:24+00:00,d292upu,1.0,t3_4fikqk,21.0,sodapoppin

2021,"As an artist myself who appreciates the skill it takes to produce a piece of photorealistic art, but doesn't really enjoy it at all, I don't think that there's anything you can really do on /r/Art to actually fix it. 

As other posters have been saying, the more lay-people and users that don't really have a knowledge of art/art history usually find the most ""visually striking"" pieces to be the ""best"". 

I suppose you could try to limit the amount of photorealistic art that's posted, *buuut* if a lot of the stuff that's actually being upvoted is that same content, it's going to be difficult for the community to swallow (especially by the users mentioned above). 

Overall I don't really know what you can do other than encourage more styles to be posted. Maybe have a theme/artist/medium day once a week? Would get some stuff flowing in different directions. ",2016-04-01 05:30:31+00:00,d1lguz4,2.0,t1_d1l9lhm,12956.0,TheoryOfReddit

2073,"&gt; What is your take on E-sports overall is it gonna survive for longer and become something traditional like football, tennis etc.?

I think it will be it's own thing for a while. I don't really care/want it to get big as other sports. 

&gt; And how about salaries, do you think that the players get enough or too much?

I've heard horror stories for StarCraft 2 players and they basically have no income if they're on a lower-end team. Would be cool to see some support, esp. from Blizz.

The truth is that the poor environment that African Americans live in was created by the separation and economic disadvantage that people like you put them in, resulting in lower education and thus more poverty and crime. 

The thing is that the same can be said for white people in a poor environment as well. Uneducated and poor individuals are statistically more violent and have higher crime rates, and it just so happens that the discrimination against black people put them where they are now and the population is higher than that of white people. 

Does that mean that all black people are violent? No, of course not. Does that mean that all poor black people are violent? No, again of course not. What that *does* mean is that a poor and uneducated environment breeds violence and crime.

I definitely agree.

&gt; Which sub, KiA? Are you just dismissing the entire sub as trolls? That seems a bit disingenuous, I for one do not appreciate being labled as a troll.

Talking about /r/Cynicalbrit. The source of the reason why TB left social media is because of a disagreement between users and himself about a month ago. 

&gt; Plenty of people have been harassed for being GG supporters though, TB included. Several women have been forced to leave Twitter simply due to how much hate and abuse they received for agreeing with the premise of ""ethics in journalism""

I never said that ""no one gets harassed for being a GG supporter"". I think it happens on both sides, whether you're for the movement or not. 

All I said was that the harassment that TB is talking about is probably *not* because of GamerGate, given the large amount of time that he's been silent on supporting GamerGate directly on Twitter, the podcast and otherwise. 

&gt;Well, to be fair, you are misrepresenting his point since it was ""X famous person HAS been harassed for agreeing with Gamergate, in the past.""

Like you said youself, we don't know that yet until we hear the actual full interview. 

&gt; You do know that Gamerghazi is the trolls, right? And considering I can't see the two posts anywhere on his profile that he made on GGhazi, I assume they've been deleted and him banned... as happens to any one who shows the slightest amount of disagreement with their narrative.

[Here are the comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/469wva/the_dark_side_of_gaming_ive_been_called_a_curry/d03l7y9). Good try though.

So yeah, he has a bias towards pushing a positive GG narrative that basically shows ""X famous person is being harassed because GamerGate!"".

2671,"Here's the excerpt: 

&gt;Enter John Bain, also known as TotalBiscuit. A popular YouTuber and gaming critic, John was an online personality at the very centre of #GamerGate and to this day, he still receives harassment because of it. John had decided that he wanted better journalistic ethics in games media and voiced his support for #GamerGate, saying:

&gt; “We need to be ethical in our industry. I’ve been pro-consumer since the start, it is the platform I have made my career on.”

&gt; However, because #GamerGate coverage focused heavily on harassed women, John’s stance on ethics in games journalism left him open to, ironically, harassment.

&gt; As a figure at the centre of the scandal he faced, “almost two years of constant day-to-day harassment, the most vicious stuff I’ve ever had in my career. I will kill you, I will rape your wife, I will kill your child. This was coming from people who were self-proclaimed “Social Justice” advocates.”

&gt; John has admitted that he has been in and out of therapy before because it can get to be too much. He has since been diagnosed with inoperable liver cancer. This gave the trolls another target to continue the harassment.

&gt; “Trolls look for attack vectors and since a lot of trolls are sexist, they will use someone’s gender as an attack vector. They are looking for the most personal gap in your armour. Most of the attacks I receive are based on my appearance, or my work. Cancer was something in particular that people have used to try and attack me. They go to my wife and say, 'how does it feel that your husband is going to die soon and leave you?'”

&gt; That is why he recently decided that he no longer wishes to be on social media. Announcing it on his SoundCloud in an audio blog, John said that he was disconnecting from all forms of social media.

&gt; “Social media is a misnomer, it’s anti-social media. People are just looking for attention from those that they follow. Negative attention is just as good.”

&gt; John says he wants to enjoy what’s left of his life. “I want to live my life and not feel like I’m shackled to this system that makes me so miserable on a daily basis. Demands of modern society have put a certain impetus on us to be connected all the time. I think it is fundamentally unhealthy - I don’t think the human condition was built to deal with that it. It has caused so much pain to people over the last few years - myself included,” adding, “enough is enough.”",2016-02-17 17:01:32+00:00,d03d2g8,1.0,t3_469n8d,228.0,Cynicalbrit

I don't agree with this. I don't expect to pay $14 for a game that has better controls on a PC or console, and runs sub 30fps on my phone with touch controls. Because of this sub par experience, I do not want to spend more than I would on PC. I can grab any of the Final Fantasy's on Steam for $15- the same I can get it on the play store- with 1080p and 60fps and gamepad/keyboard support.

&gt; Gotta love no-win situations. Don't respond to it? ""YOU IGNORE FAN FEEDBACK"". Respond to it? ""WHY ARE YOU BULLYING THIS GUY/WHY DO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO RESPOND TO EVERY PIECE OF CRITICISM?"" Tell a viewer you think they're wrong ""WHY ARE YOU SO ARROGANT?"". Spend 20 minutes deconstructing all the reasons why I think that guys post is incorrect and why I do everything I do ""GOD YOU CAN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF, WHY DO YOU KEEP MAKING LONG SOUNDCLOUDS EVERYTIME SOMEONE DISAGREES WITH YOU?!"". I guess expecting a little understanding or that the tiny vocal minority of my viewers who are obsessed with drama and nonsense to maybe let off a little during the most difficult time in my life was too much to ask. Maybe they saw my tweet that things had improved a little because the tumors that are still killing me had shrunk somewhat and thought ""ok awesome, time to start shouting at him again"". I was doing so well. I've had a really good few weeks, actually felt like I haven't needed to get angry at shit people have said about me on the internet. It's been so freeing. It's not like the negativity ever ended, but it was washing over me. It wasn't sticking in my mind. I'd read some diatribe about how stupid and wrong I was and know ""hey actually, its obvious that guy just didnt watch the video, so why should I care what he said?"". I'd read yet another ""god isnt he dead yet?"" post and just laugh and think ""that guys life must really suck if he has to post stuff like that"". I knew that would eventually end. I didn't expect it to end after a throw away snarky remark on Twitter. Some of you really suck. I hope you never end in a position where something you said after days of insomnia and pain without a second thought gets you shit on by hundreds of people on the internet. It's not fun and it hurts the most when it comes from the people you think you can trust not to do it, your viewers. I guess I should make a concerted effort to stay off social media again. That sucks, I almost thought I had a handle on it. Fuck.

Note: 

&gt; I guess I should make a concerted effort to stay off social media again. 

It's repeated over and over again but this always happens. John does/says something on Twitter and drama starts on the subreddit. He then uses Twitter solely as a means to only post videos. Then, after about a month or two he comes back to Twitter and Reddit and the cycle repeats itself. 

John, I have so much respect for you after watching you for so many years but you can't keep having this happen. This isn't good for you or your fans. I know you're all about ""I don't care if I offend anyone"" but if you want this cycle to end you need to realize that you sometimes can't make sarcastic tweets without starting a riot there or here. Cheers mate.

3203,"I think what they're trying to say is that they don't know what to look for when scouting. 

If you're doing an opening scout as zerg, check to see (with a drone, usually) if they're going gas + 1 rax. That means that there are two options:

1. Reaper + expand

2. Teching up for a push

Factors that will tell you this include

* How many rax your opponent has and 

* If they are building a starport/multiple factories/factory with a reactor around the 3 to 330 minute mark

If you do not see an expansion by (and this is a rough estimate) 4 minutes, expect a push with hellions or a drop (drop after scouting a starport, hellions if reactor is on a factory). 

Also watch out for starports with **tech labs** as that means you're going to be in for a bad time with cloaked banshees. The timing on spores (according to PiG) for cloaked banshees is around 420-425, and the third rax before banshee play is around 5 minutes. 

If you scout and see **no rax**, prepare for a 2 to 3-rax reaper heavy pressure or a 2 to 3-rax reaper + bunker in main/natural ramp. For this exact reason I get speed very quickly (usually right after the pool finishes) and 6 lings to scout the map for proxies + slight pressure to keep reapers at home. 

Holding protoss pushes is difficult, and it also depends on what kind of army comp you're going with. I generally go for ling/hydra/roach as the dps output of the hydras is defended by lings/a wall of roaches. It's also useful to transition into lurkers as their damage to shields is awesome. 

As for holding that immo/stalker push if it's early-ish in the game, make as many roaches as you can and start putting spines at the base that they're attacking into. You can always cancel the spines if you manage to hold it off, or move them to another base once they finish if you've held off the push. 

Usually these types of pushes are allins, so if you hold it you're in great shape. I also love to send a small batch of lings around their army into their nat/expo to deal some harassment damage because they've brought all their units to my side of the map.

I can honestly say that I haven't once seen any of her standups or her shows/movies whatever. I don't act like I do. 

What I do know is that when you're a comedian (especially if you're a comedian) is that you joke about certain things and you have a persona that you joke about (in Amy's case, it's being promiscuous). 

&gt; Is there two people here? One Amy Schumer who revels and profits in being a pretend ""whore"" for comedy and making light out of it, and one who secretly expects everyone to love her and respect her?

When she's on her own personal Twitter account she can be any person she wants to be. If she wants *not* to be the person she acts like then by all means she can.

The past couple of months (around the time of the LotV beta) he had become a lot more popular than he had been, with his twitch streams getting 1000+ views every time he streamed. Tbh I think it's gotten to his head. Nate is a great guy at heart but I think his head is in the wrong place. 

Nate isn't a bad guy at all, but even I- as someone who has subbed to him multiple times and played other games with him- have stopped watching his stream since the whine started. 

I've since watched more positive streamers like Polt, CatZ, PiG, Fenn3r and Lowko. Granted most of those are zerg (as I play zerg) but you get the idea.

The problem is the terrain units are moving towards the enemy when you don't want them to.

If one of those groups moves *towards* the enemy when a disruptor ball is shot that defeats the whole point of splitting in the first place.

3366,"&gt; seeing as I was over the age of 13 and no longer based my existence around a commercial product

This is the saddest thing. I'm 19 and I play a lot of video games but I don't give a shit about anything GG says anymore. Just play video games and enjoy them. So much unreasonable rage. 

Once one realizes that it really doesn't matter, only then can they understand what really does.

I look at users in kia and some of them have accounts that are dedicated to the movement- literally thousands of comments and posts exclusively in kia/GG-related subs. Users like netscape9 and  frankenmine (rip in peace) baffle me with their hard-core cult-like following of the movement. I really wonder what kind of person they are in real life.

3489,"My thoughts from the /r/games thread. 

&gt; What I think is going on with the price is that they only want the enthusiasts that will drop $600 on it to buy it, and not the regular market for the first generation.
Get the first generation out of the way, get some good customer feedback, and come back with a more affordable second/third gen device. If anything it's more or less of a test run to see how it sells.

I also talked about the PSVR and how it's much cheaper than the Oculus. This is probably due to two things:

1. The demographics of the two devices don't really overlap as much and 

2. The performance (and thus the experience) on the Oculus is going to be much better. 

&gt; Sony really did a great job introducing their product. However, I think most people will see the Oculus how the layman sees gaming PCs: expensive and not worth the time and effort to get one/build one. 

&gt; The thing is that I don't think Oculus is going for the same demographics as sony is trying to hit. They're more enthusiast-focused and ""affluent gamer"" focused to care about the price. 

&gt; The Sony PS4 demographics don't really align with the Oculus' so that's probably why the device is so much cheaper. You also have to understand that the Oculus is objectively better than the PSVR performance wise, so the price isn't going to compare. 

&gt; Will Oculus want to maybe cater to the casual gamer later on? Sure. But the the first thing before even thinking about changing the price is changing the minimum requirements to actually run the thing. 

Edit: You also have to bear in mind that this is the cost of new technology. It isn't going to be cheap from the get-go. The company has to make money on a product that has no market right now. ",2016-01-06 18:34:40+00:00,cyob1zw,1.0,t3_3zqu4m,3449.0,SRSGaming

Here is my actual quote. Listen clearly because I think you're not understanding things. 

What is actually silly are the people that *freak out about crazy people*. Why do so many people get worked up over a crazy person? Sure, the guy is crazy, sure his ideas are dumb. 

*That doesn't mean he doesn't have the same right as you to think how he wants*. Because if you tell a person ""hey, you can't think that"", you're going against everything that you're against (aka ""censorship""/""free speech""). 

The people hating on him are silly, the people who actually think it's a big deal is silly. 

Play games. Who cares about what else is going on.

3627,"Hi! I appreciate the time you took to type out this comment. I'm going to try to answer your questions. 

I want to first state that I sometimes get caught up in my hate for gamergate (and kia) and some of the stuff I comment can be pretty stupid (as you pointed out). Although I do acknowledge that the things I say might not align with other people's' thoughts, and I might state some things that are stupid and irrational, I stand by my statements and will not delete them. 

&gt; So is your criticism of KiA that they don't talk about ethics enough or just they they talk about a plethora of other things?

My criticism of kia comes from their unwillingness to see another point of view on subjects they discuss. Downvotes come quick to people who don't follow the ""circlejerk"" in kia, and when their views do not align with that of the group. 

I was a supporter of GamerGate when it was simply going against unethical behaviour in games journalism. It was a problem, yes, but (now) I don't think it's that big of a problem as it once was, and it's not that serious of an issue.

 I separated myself from kia/gg when the topics on the subreddit started to lean towards things that are frequently posted on /r/TumblrInAction and subreddits like /r/SubredditCancer. I thought the attacks on Pao were stupid and childish, and the attacks on feminists and ""sjws"" were too, so I just unsubbed and never looked back. 

I really do not understand some people's infatuation with GamerGate, and to me it seems very cult-like and very strange/bigoted (see /u/AntonioOfVenice et al).

&gt;  ...wanting something banned...[is] a major assault on freedom of speech

Here is where we don't see eye-to-eye. I believe that that person can say what they want to say. If they want to advocate to ban GTAV in Australia they have the power to do that, as that is in their right of freedom of speech. If someone wants something banned and they write something about it, that's not ""an attack on freedom of speech"", that's someone giving their point of view on a subject. *If GTAV was successfully banned in Australia*, then I do believe that one should have the right to buy a product. However, I wouldn't call that an attack on freedom of speech, I would say that it's entirely up to the stores' decision whether or not to sell the game. 

&gt; If you think it's acceptable to use violence to silence someone else and are just willing to blow if off with ""He just has a different opinion"" then /u/AntonioOfVenicekia is probably correct, you are fundamentally unreasonable.

I do not believe this. I never advocated violence against anyone. 

&gt;&gt; Again, GamerGate acts like it's a part of some revolutionary movement to reform games journalism and yet it turns to name calling, labeling and personal attacks.

&gt; You have something to source that? That's a big accusation for a large non-cohesive group.

I do not have anything to source that. That comes from my own personal experience within the gamergate circle. I do think the movement has gone off track, and many people are jumping off the bandwagon just as I did. 

That statement basically comes from what I see on the subreddit nowadays, as the front page is constantly filled with SJW's, feminists, etc. 

&gt;  Now she just lives off of playing the victim and trying to stay in the limelight. People get paid a pretty penny to do those

I have nothing against Anita because she doesn't affect me at all. All I think is that it's funny how mad people in kia get whenever she does something. 


&gt; Could you ""highlight"" /u/AntonioOfVenicekia 's hypocrisy for me?

I am mostly talking about how gamergate tries to show how other people are pushing a narrative when they are in fact trying to push a narrative themselves. GamerGate sees themselves as a ""neutral"" entity when it's quite obvious that it's not the case. If it was, there would be discussion about the topics in kia and not just pandering to other users. 

Hopefully I hit everything. This entire thing is getting pretty annoying because none of it really matters, and it's just shocking how dedicated some people are to a movement.

They targeted gamers.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.",2015-12-28 00:06:01+00:00,cyd93qx,15.0,t1_cyd91f7,114.0,Cynicalbrit

3653,"""moods"" are usually your body reacting to environmental cues and processing them as ""good"" or ""bad"" and happy or sad. When your brain analyzes the environment and picks up certain aspects it's assigned as either good bad or neutral (at the very basic level). 

Although this is one theory of processing emotions it can be used to explain complex ideas such as general moods. 

These moods are also related to levels of certain chemicals in your brain (i.e. dopamine) that can further change mood and emotional responses.

3694,"Alrighty this is going to be long but please read it all. I'm going to point out on things you did wrong, things you need to work on and things that you can do to get better. 

First of all, your first overlord was not moved until forty seconds. This first overlord should be your eyes in the early stages of the game. Usually with bigger maps like Ruins of Seras you're going to have to drone scout anyways. Against terran this is what you're scouting for:

* When my drone/overlord gets to my opponent's base, is my opponent building gas? Is he building a barracks? If the answer is yes, expect a reaper + expand opening. This means you need to get a couple speedlings out (4-6) *at home* to deal with them. 

* When my drone/overlord gets to my opponent's base, is my opponent simply building a barracks (no gas)? Prepare for marines and a light expand. Unless you scout later gas or factory/starport (I like to get into my opponent's base at 3:30 mins to check) then expect some marines + medivac composition. If there is more than one factory, expect tanks. 

* When my drone/overlord gets to my opponent's base, is my opponent not building anything except for supply depots? If the answer is yes, you're either playing someone who is very bad, or someone who is ""cheesing"" you. Expect to end the game early or prepare for a proxy 2 rax cheese. 

* Later scouts are for clear tech changes and expansions made by your opponent.

Your beginning build order is this: 12 drone, 13 drone, 14 overlord. A more optimal opening is: **12 drone, 13 overlord, 13 drone**. This allows you to get two drones out of the larva as soon as the overlord pops (with a third closely behind). 

Another thing I noticed is that you put down a spawning pool at 13 supply on a four player map, with no scouting. You should be opening hatch first ZvT, *especially* on a four player map. Your opponent simply cannot get enough marines out ahead of time to actually do any damage (if you scouted a barracks in his base), and the economical advantage is *huge*, especially as a zerg where you can build drones at such a fast speed. 

Your overlord was made late at 14 and you were supply blocked, so you built two overlords. The 100 minerals that you put into another overlord could have been two drones that could have been mining for you. Instead, you opted for an extra overlord. 

You made a queen as soon as the pool popped (great!) but no lings (not great!). Make 2-4 lings after pool finishes to scout + harass. If your opponent's wall is open you could do some great damage! 

After 100 gas, **pull out of gas**. Unless you are going for a ling/baneling bust, you do not need that much gas. Furthermore, you put down two evolution chambers at 2:15. You simply 

1. Do not have the resources nor the larva to make use of them and

2. Do not have a timing to properly use the upgrades effectively. 

Remember this: Upgrades are only used when there is a means to an end. Simply put, if you're going to start an upgrade, make sure you're planning something to make use of them. Making 2x evo chambers at 2 minutes isn't going to help you, especially if you're only on one base. 

I noticed you wanted to go ling/bling comp but your b-nest was late- it is usually made after the 100 gas for ling speed. 

Your second hatch went down at 3:20- this is very late. On top of that, you're mining from two gas, with 9 drones on your main base. Optimal saturation is 16 drones on minerals. Also, two gasses isn't going to do anything if you don't have a lair and aren't planning on creating any roaches (you didn't drop a roach warren for the entire game- more on that later). 

You made a ton of lings that just sat in your base- these could have been drones! If anything, use these lings to scout and harass your opponent. If your enemy is scared of expanding because of some lings outside his base, you're always going to have an advantage. 

You haven't scouted once with your overlord- why not? You could have spotted the two factories with reactors attached to them pumping out tanks. As I said before, if you see more than one factory, you need to prepare to make roaches. Roaches are awesome against tanks because they're tanky themselves (they're also my favorite unit :o))! 

If you do actually end up scouting tanks and realize he's going to turtle with them, just make more bases and drone up! If he's not going to attack you, take advantage of it. To minimize risk of attacks while expanding and droning, put some lings or overlords in front of his bases to see anything that's headed your way. 

Even though you didn't scout the tanks, you morphed banelings at your base. Usually you can just send your speedlings out of your base and morph them near your opponent- it's much faster. When you attacked, you saw he had tanks, yet you still made more mutas + ling/blings. This is the exact composition that counters yours. You definitely could have made a few mutas (10 or so) for harassment, but making your entire composition around lings and blings is just silly against tanks. Their AOE destroys them. 

I also noticed that you didn't have any creep spread at all. I usually make 2 or three queens for early defense + creep spread. 

Scout scout scout! If you would have seen your opponent's third base at 8:30 you could have been ahead! Your spending isn't terrible, but your gas is way too high, even though you're spending it on mutas. Either pull out of gas, make more upgrades, or make more mutas. With all those minerals, make more drones or expand more (you could even put down a ""macro hatch"" for more larva. 

As a zerg, expanding is a must. A good rule of thumb is to always be a base up on your opponent. If they have two, you should be already saturated at three. 

If you see tanks, and your ling/blings are getting crushed, just switch into roaches. They're cheap, have great dps and can tank a lot of tank shots. Make sure to saturate bases as well! At 11 mins your natural only had 12 drones (should be 16 as I said before). 

+1 for mutas (if you wanted to keep that composition, which as I said earlier probably wasn't a good idea) at 12:30 is very very late, and should have been started as soon as the spire finished. 

If you are going to harass with mutas, go for workers- not structures. If you weaken his economy you can slow down the tanks that are being produced. 

Be more active on the map! Attack, scout, harass, etc. Staying in your base and just a-moving across the map when you're maxed isn't the best strategy. 

Information is key in StarCraft. If you had known about any of these things (2x fac, expansions) you could have created a good comp that would have crushed your opponents. 

Unfortunately you assumed your opponent was going for marine and medivacs and created a good composition against that. You also GG'ed with 3.3k minerals and 600 gas in the bank. If you would have just made a roach warren and just spammed roaches + ravagers you could have stayed in the game, and potentially could have won. 

One more note: Towards the end your opponent was sending some widow mines out. You saw them, had units killed by them and yet you did not make any detection (overseers or spore crawlers) to kill them. You let the widow mines kill most of your banelings and a ton of your mutas.

FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued burning unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting.

Seems like it was just fires from debris, son. ",2015-12-18 17:00:47+00:00,cy3jrbv,5.0,t1_cy3jpal,83.0,todayilearned

3914,"Alright I checked it out and I'm gonna give you my thoughts. 

You did not send a drone scout in the beginning. If you had seen the gas timing+ extra rax you could have had some time to get some lings out. 

When the pool popped, you did not make any lings. It's usually good to make two to four lings for scouting and any possible reaper opening. 

Transferring drones is pretty important as well. At the 3:30 mark you had 21 drones in your main, and 5 in your natural. This is very inefficient. 

You also did not get ling speed until after the bling nest, delaying it even further. 

When the reapers engaged your queens, you should immediately have backed off. Losing two queens that early is super devastating. If you only have two lings, just back off, don't engage them with the reapers, and do not fight off of creep. Try to get some creep in between bases so Queens can easily move between them. 

You put way too many resources into fighting the reapers when just some speedlings could have thwarted them. 

While fighting, make sure you keep injecting. Your natural also only had 8 drones at the 7 minute mark. 

Scouting is also key. If you would have seen the army at ~7:30 you could have just walked up the ramp with the roaches you already had and won. You left a lot of roaches sitting in your third as well before the attack at 9 minutes. 

At that attack, you made no effort to kill the liberators or the Marines and you wasted an entire army. 

Back at home you had no upgrades going, drone count was low and you were only on three bases. You also forgot roach speed. If you see liberators, you need ravagers. 

Your creep spread was almost non existant. 

At the last attack you a-moved into the terrans death ball. Not good!! Try to morph for ravagers to pick off the liberators and some blings for the Marines. ",2015-12-07 17:16:32+00:00,cxqffb9,1.0,t3_3vsmq9,8933.0,allthingszerg

4016,"&gt; How do I play against a 6 pool as terran?

Micro your heart out with SCV's and try to get a wall up/barracks up. 

&gt; How do I beat protoss lategame while I'm playing bio?

Generally bio composition vs. protoss relies heavily on dropping in multiple areas and attacking at different positions so you don't have to fight a death ball up front. A great example of a player that does this well is Maru- check out some of his GSL or ProLeague games. 

&gt; How do i beat a cannon rush? 

Same as with a 6 pool. Try to kill the probe if he hasn't dropped any cannons if you catch it before it happens. The key is to scout effectively. If you're not scouting with scv's in your base/natural or the enemy's base (for a forge) then you're not taking into account all possible ways to beat it. 

&gt; How do I beat suprise mutalisks when I'm playing mech and don't have any thors of vikings?

Scout for mutas. You have a scanner! Use it, yo. 

&gt; When is Bio strongest against protoss?

It depends. Like I said earlier a lot of players straight up go bio no matter the composition of their opponent (i.e. Maru). 

&gt; Is a hybrid between bio and mech viable?

A great push I had a hard time dealing with as a zerg (and still do in lotv) are marine + tank pushes/drops. Tanks destroy lings and roaches don't have that much dps aganst marines (if you're ahead in supply and micro well).

&gt; Should I make reapers when I'm playing mech?

No. Reapers are usually for scouting and early harass when expanding early. ",2015-11-30 18:09:31+00:00,cxi4djh,2.0,t1_cxi3nfl,1098.0,starcraft

4026,"Yo! Welcome to starcraft. One of the most important aspects of the game is resource management. Specifically, using resources at the maximum possible efficiency to balance army production and economy production. 

Hotkeys help facilitate this. Binding your Command Center at a specific number (control + number key) and double pressing it quickly changes your view so you can see what's going on in that specific base. Furthermore, hotkeying a group of barracks by clicking and shifting (selecting more than one) and then hotkeying them all lets you produce army units without having to actually click on the barracks. 

Army control is also important. By hotkeying a group of army units you can move them to a specific point on the map if you want to, even if you're not even looking at them (clicking the hotkey for the units once, and clicking on the minimap where you want them to move). When a group of army units is selected, pressing the shift button ""shifts"" through the multiple unit types, allowing you to select and cast any abilities or spells you want to.

Plat zerg here as well. I've had experiences where taking the gold as a natural works out pretty well, but I've also had some pretty nasty stuff as well:

1. Your actual ""natural"" base isn't covered with creep. It limits unit movement and vision. 

2. The ramp to your main is not as defended as well, and ling run-by's can be an issue

3. Defending ling run-by's and harassment at the gold ""natural"" can be difficult to defend.

Right now don't worry about getting into gold, try for that #1 spot in your league. 

As for general game stuff, make sure your economy is strong. If you don't have a good economy to back up your units, you will be stuck in a trench.

4209,"&gt; Why do you think protoss dont go full on air more (for example with heavy phoenix openers with carriers as an endgoal)?

It's difficult for a protoss to get to full air because it's highly dependent on a strong economy, and if the toss cannot defend against early and midgame pushes/harass that economy falls off, the army comp is not viable/big enough. You see more ""mass air"" in lower leagues because it's easier to get away with being greedy. 

&gt; And what do you think is the best thing a zerg can do to deal with mass carriers endgame?

I've had trouble with this myself, but the main counter to air play are vipers (parasitic bomb), *probably* infestor and definitely a good amount of corruptors. You can try to use ravagers as well because of the slow movement of carriers as well.  ",2015-11-16 16:40:29+00:00,cx26vdh,1.0,t3_3t1b3t,540.0,starcraft

4412,"Well just looks like you posted there just now. The race specific strat subs are much smaller than then main sub, so don't expect replies to start coming in for a couple hours. 

Right now you don't need to worry about builds- building from the basics (i.e. understanding the mechanics of the game) is more important that builds. 

I would tell you to start by watching videos from Day9, specifically his videos on hot keys and army management and control. 

Good mechanics like when to start building different tech becomes easier as you play more of the game. You will become much much more relaxed and your confidence will build. 

I won't say for you not to do it (as it can be a good experience) but playing against bots starting at the easiest difficulty is a pretty good idea. This allows you to not be as stressed as a game against a real player, and it also doesnt force bad habits. When you beat a difficulty and you feel comfortable doing so, just go on to the next one. 

I recently started to play Brood War (the first starcraft) and practicing against bots at first is so much better for you mechanically than playing against real players who will stomp you every time. 

~~I'll try to link my recent post where I brought up an old Day9 podcast about strategy and timings~~ [found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/3ot4dh/one_of_the_most_insightful_things_ive_heard_about/)

4464,"First of all I would like to say that I really appreciate you typing this out, and I really appreciate your thoughts on it. 

A few things:

&gt; we are still talking about a copyrighted work, and, within the bounds of law, we should respect that someone should give permission for videos of their game to be made before we just go ahead and do them, even if it's non-profit

No one is arguing about the legality here. It is completely legal for Squeenix to do what they're doing. That doesn't mean that we don't have the right as consumers purchasing the content. If we (as responsible consumers) want to be able to see a game before it's released/before we purchase it, we should be able to see some kind of non-bias view on how the game is, how it runs, etc. (basically if it's worth the money). 

What this is *not* a discussion about is ""wow look at these dumb japanese dudes give me my PC gaems"", it's more of ""I want this giant company that already has tonnes of money to be as open and transparent with their games as the rest of the world is."" Because, in reality, they're the only ones doing it the ass-backwards way. 

Sure, what they're doing isn't illegal, but shouldn't they be less stringent and less deceiving about their releases?  

&gt; monotised

What you're looking for is ""monetized"", lol. 

&gt; in this case sounds more like it stems from dumb music licencing more then anything else.

While this may be true, it still shouldn't affect streaming/content creation. A simple ""don't play the music"" would have been sufficient. 

&gt; Who would I rather emulate? I would like to be happy please

Here is where you get a bit off track. Happiness is a bit subjective. I have a tonne of games in my steam library that I'm content with, but I still play the occasional mobile game. The difference between those two sets of people that you talk about is one is informed, and one is not. Which one would I rather emulate? I would rather be an informed and responsible consumer and get my money's worth out of a product I paid for. 

&gt; I'm a gaming enthusiast thank you, and gaming is only one thing amoungst many I do in my life, and my life definitely doesn't include complaining about the little things, and I'm happier for it.

People are passionate about different things, no need to get salty, bruv :-) I like kpop and starcraft and can talk about it all day :D
 
Thanks again for the response, and yes, I read all of it.

4805,"&gt; Should I wait for that to come out then buy it? Or can I just buy Heart of the Swarm and then get the expansion pack?

If you want to be playing online, LotV is probably the game you want to buy because the competitive scene will shift to that game. However, if you want to buy WoL or HotS, they are both standalone and do not require any other game to play. LotV is the same way: you do not need to own WoL/HotS to play. 

&gt; Also what has changed from WoL to HotS and now LotV? Is there anything I need to know about the game, how it's balanced, etc. before I dive back into it?

A lot has changed actually. The biggest thing with WoL --&gt; HotS are new units (swarmhost, hellbat, mothership core, oracle and probably something else I'm missing) but the biggest change from HotS --&gt; LotV is the starting worker change. 

In all of the past games, starting workers has been set to 6. In LotV, the starting worker count is at 12, meaning that games start a lot quicker with the 2x starting economy. It's very fun, and it puts you in the action right away.

4932,"Sort of confused on how different the inject is in comparison to the one we already have in HotS. 

Let me get this straight: Autocast is turned off, but I will be able to ""queue"" a max of three injects at the same time, kind of like it's on autocast, but when it's done with those three queued injects, I would have to queue up another three? 

If that's actually the change, I am very, very excited for this next update. This is exactly the middle ground I think everyone was looking for. It takes ""more skill"" but it still lessens up the stress that came with nailing perfect injects in HotS. 

Awesome preview, blizz. This is the kind of stuff this community needs. 

Edit: Not sure where I got the max three queue inject from. Although I would actually rather have that be a thing, it just looks like players who forget to inject are rewarded by being able to queue up multiple injects. ",2015-09-10 19:09:10+00:00,cux21tf,1.0,t3_3kfird,4753.0,starcraft

Larvae are a defining characteristic of Zerg and just limiting the amount of units the race produces doesn't make it harder to play, it just handicaps it. ",2015-09-04 15:55:17+00:00,cuqja7v,1.0,t3_3jmo0t,1465.0,starcraft

5000,"I definitely agree with all your points, but you have to remember that although it may require more APM, it does a lot more than mules and larva inject. Protoss players can speed up upgrades as well as probe/army production while Terrans and Zergs rely on their macro mechanics for (mostly) economical reasons (it's kind of a moot point for zerg since the larvae are used for army production as well). 

My point is that there is a trade-off for the ability because you can simply do more with it. If you only want the  ability to be set on autocast on nexi then you're going to lose the ability to boost army production as well as upgrade production. 

On the other hand, give *all* structures that a protoss has chrono on default and you're basically just tweaking the numbers and there's less strategy involved (ie fake chrono-ing blink). 

So yes, it does require more clicks, but that's only because there's an advantage to using it. It's a trade-off. ",2015-09-04 15:32:52+00:00,cuqidmv,1.0,t3_3jmmsa,649.0,starcraft

I remember a post a little while back when they changed the quality from medium back down to low and the reasoning is that they just didn't have enough money to justify it.

So you're basically the kind of people that trashed sc2 when it came out because it ""wasn't BW"". It's a standalone expansion. Things are going to be different, and you either suck it up and learn the game because you love the game, or you don't. Either way is fine, but with that kind of mentality you're not going to go far in lotv if you even are going to play it.

5133,"&gt; Giving someone false hope is only hurting that person

Giving false hope by saying ""you can totally become a caster!"" is completely different from giving constructive feedback to make that person better. 

&gt; Maybe I'm hurting their feelings by being brutally honesty, and maybe you think I'm a dick for doing so, but I don't think coddling someone is doing them any favors, when the viewers of actual Starcraft tournaments certainly won't.

Again, giving constructive feedback is not coddling someone. And no dude, I don't think you're a dick. 

&gt;  But sometimes negativity is needed

I don't think this is true at all. If you have nothing good to say, just don't say it. 

&gt; The community cannot and should not be expected to give nothing but constructive criticism to every bloke who comes along wanting to cast.

I do believe that not everyone should be expected to, but shitting on that person does no good for the community either.

5136,"Yo

I really appreciate the video, and I completely understand how you feel. I wanted to establish myself as someone who streams from time to time, and almost every single time I posted on this subreddit I'm downvoted or talked shit about (with exceptions). Just wanted to share a few of my thoughts/rant. Sorry if it goes a bit long.  

I think that the reason that this subreddit is so negative towards new content creators is that there is just so much negativity floating around. People are not only angry that the ""content creators of old"" are gone and have moved on, but when they see new people trying to make their own thing, they reject them as someone who is a ""poser"" or is ""annoying"". In reality it's the new content creators that have helped grow and develop this community to where it is now, so by rejecting these new content creators they're essentially turning their sarcastic use of ""dead gaem"" into a real thing; because by not letting people in, you're destroying the game. 

As for the hate comments, I feel like there's a circlejerk around this subreddit that enjoys shit-posting and non-content ""fluff"" more than discussion based posts. It's easy to say ""you're an fagit"" when the entire community upvotes you to the top. I feel, however, that the although these toxic members are quite loud, they're in the minority. I'm very confident that a lot of people here would love to see new content, and the upvotes already on this post shows that. 

It's hard. It really is. A little while ago a user named /u/FanBoygame started to post a lot of his content to the subreddit (and still does, which is kind of against reddit ToS). I commented on one of his casts [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/3fx48g/amazing_game_between_fantasy_vs_bboongbboong_game/ctsusgs/?context=3) with some feedback. I tried to give thoughtful insight on how he could be better, and what I got in return was downvotes and someone explaining how he ""he doesn't have potential to be a good caster"" and ""Nobody will ever hire him with that voice."". Is that what we've devolved to as a community? Shunning others' tries at becoming something great for this game? Instead we berate these people into not posting and to stop creating content. We shouldn't do that, and I know as a community we're better than that. 

I love StarCraft. It's my favorite game. But when people on this subreddit shit on others trying to make it better for everyone it just makes me sad. We just need to be more accepting as a community because it is good for not only the game, but the people who play it. 

That said, people like you, Jakatak, Fenn3r, Lowko, Falcon Paladin, BTTV and others is what makes StarCraft so awesome. Thank you for what you're doing and keep it up. I just subscribed to your YT and your Twitter. I expect big things man!

Cheers. 

Edit: To add on about the feedback thing, it's clearer everyday that people don't use this subreddit as a place to discuss strategy, and when people try to they get shit on because they don't want to talk about it. Strategy-oriented communities like the ""All things"" subreddits and TL are places where feedback is amazing because that's the kind of content people are looking for.

5155,"&gt; a fair amount of defence for racism towards whites

I've actually seen SRD make fun of reddit's hypocritical behavior of ""it's ok to make fun of black people, but as soon as a white person is involved it's not ok"" which is probably what you're seeing. 

As for the sexist/feminist discussion, I have seen none of it. If you could provide examples that would be great, but most of what you're saying is purely anecdotal. 

And in my opinion, I don't think an internet community can be neutral, and although SRD *tries* to be neutral, they very much are not. 

&gt; The fact that some users seem very keen to deny being a SJW is quite telling (often while calling someone else brogressive or reactionary).

Generally reviews don't spoil games: they tell you whether or not spending $50-$60 dollars on a game is worth it and whether or not it has game-breaking bugs or it's unplayable. I mean look at Batman. A lot of people got burned because of that game. 

If you're on PC steam does have a refund option, but the whole idea is to not pre-order at all because it sends a message to publishers and developers that we're not willing to spend money on a game that is unfinished and unpolished.

Didn't Chance say he talked to higher-ups and they ""ok'ed"" it? Really stupid that he can get fired for doing something outside of his work.

5236,"Hi guys, 

I'm heading off to college next week and need an awesome set of earbuds to carry in my pocket to use with my phone. I absolutely love the Apple ones (even though I have a Galaxy S5) because they fit comfortably in my ears. 

I don't know why, but the sound cancelling earbuds that go ""inside"" my ear don't always fit correctly and they always fall out. 

Can you guys give me some recommendations for some tough earbuds that stay in my ear, but can also survive being in my pocket during a school day?

My budget is probably somewhere from $30-$50

HotS is nearly obsolete. I haven't touched it since LotV added ranked and I'll bet you a lot of other people have as well.

5359,"Hey man, just watched your video. Wanted to give you some feedback. None of this is supposed to be mean, only constructive!

1. When introducing players, seem more enthusiastic and try to get their names right (BiongBiong =/ BoongBoong). I know it's a small thing but when you're casting you're trying to get the audience hyped and excited about the game they are going to watch. 

2. Going off of the enthusiasm thing, try to lessen your uses of ""um"" and ""uh"" and ""oops"". Getting out what you want to say is very important while you're casting. Watch some of the pros like Artosis and Tasteless: they always have a train of thought going, and never leave space in between what they're saying. This can help by adding another caster to your team! Having someone else cast with you can help dramatically with not only what's going on at the moment of the game, but what the players are going to do with the information you have (not necessarily what is going on). 

3. Try to learn the backgrounds of the players you are casting. In HotS especially, there is a lot of downtime in the beginning. Try to talk about what the players usually play like (their playstyle) as well as talking about their past achievements etc. (which you tried to do). 

4. Speeding up the replay is a big no-no. I know the beginning of the game is slow but you really need to get a sense of what is going on. Going back to point 2- even though the players are just building workers and buildings does not mean that they don't have a plan in mind. Find common builds that each race do (since you're obviously biased towards toss). This is greatly help in giving the audience information on what each player is trying to go for. 

5. Put on health bars! A lot of people like to see the damage each unit is taking, and while you do have the damaged health bars on, seeing all of them could be a good help. 

6. Learn the maps and learn how to use the camera properly. Getting good views of the game is very important, because the audience wants to know what's going on, right?

7. Practice practice practice. You have the potential to be a good caster. Work on it. Play all the races, watch pro games, watch replays and watch other casters. 

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask me!

Keep working bro. 

Quick edit: if you need to, bring down the graphics to low. I'd much rather watch a crappy looking smooth game than a decent looking game with FPS drop.

Ah I understand what you're trying to say.

And that's kind of disconcerting because it's all in the name of ""free speech"". Am I aware that it's probably on reddit in some obscure subreddit? Sure, doesn't make me a pedo and using the website doesn't make me a supporter of it.

5531,"My thoughts:

* Me Gustas Tu: Nothing new in terms of style but the song was catchy and was pretty upbeat. The MV was really bright and cute and the choreography was on point. 

* 하늘 아래서: The beginning is a bit messy and loud, but as it goes on the background music is lowered a bit and the chorus feels pretty good. Not sure if it's anything revolutionary, but it's definitely relaxing. 

* ONE: Feels a bit boring. Nothing really here for me at least. 

* 기억해 (My Buddy): Too slow for my tastes. Background music is generic bleh. Vocals aren't bad, but they aren't amazing either. It does feel a bit quiet (?) at times.  

All in all I liked Me Gustas Tu the most and I can see that having the biggest reaction (for obvious reasons). The other songs are alright, 6's at best. I would, though, like to see the choreography for the rest of the songs, if any. Me Gustas Tu's was wonderful.

Art is art, if it doesn't evoke some sort of emotion within you that's totally okay. But you can't say that ""I don't get this piece, it does not evoke any emotions, it's dumb"" simply because you don't understand something.

This series features terse, colorless scrawls, reminiscent of chalk on a blackboard, that form no actual words.

_____________
This has actually been addressed many times here on reddit. [Here's one of my favorite explanations](https://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2xw1bq/eli5_how_to_appreciate_abstract_modern_art/cp3yl8a) by /u/Meekel1.

**tl;dr** abstract art is more about the ""how"" something is made, rather than what was made itself.

&gt; For this explanation I'll stick with painting, though it applies to art in general. There's two main things you look at when viewing a painting. It's ""form"" and its ""content."" Form describes the physical stuff about a painting: color, size, what type of paint, thickness of paint, type of canvas, type of brush strokes, and so on. Content describes what the painting is depicting: a house, a person, a group of people, a particular event, a collection of objects, whatever.

&gt;We'll look at two paintings, one ""normal"" painting and then an abstract one. First up is Leutze's painting of Washington crossing the Deleware.[1]   What are its formal qualities? Well, it's really big, 21 feet long. It's painted in oil paint using brush strokes that aren't really visible unless you're right up close. The colors are natural and a little muted. It's a horizontal rectangle. It's probably very heavy. And I assume it's made out of wood and canvas. Other than the size, there's not much going on as far as form goes. But as far as content is concerned, well... I'll just link you to the wikipedia article.[2] There's a whole story being told in the piece. There's men in boats, there's a great general, there's an icy river and terrified horses. There's content out the wazoo. This is the point of most ""normal"" painting:to depict something, and do it in such a way that the viewer isn't really worried about the how it's painted or the formal elements. It's like when you watch TV, you don't think about all the transistors and LEDs that make the thing function, you just watch your show.

&gt;Now on to the abstract piece, Jackson Pollok's Autumn Rhythm No. 30.[3]   Where ""normal"" painting is all about content, abstract painting is all about form. This painting is 17 feet long. The paint is thick and applied with a crazy dripping, splattering technique. The canvas is left bare in many places; you can see what its made out of. As far as content goes, there is literally none. The entire point of this painting is the form, how the paint is applied to the canvas. In the absence of any kind of content the viewer is left to simply react to the painting however they'd like. There are no politics in Autumn Rhythm, no story, no reclining nudes, no faces--no content. Going back to the TV metephor: It'd be like if somebody broke your TV down into it's individual components and spread them out on the floor. It's no longer about what it's displaying, it's about what makes the TV work, and what it's made of.

&gt;Why is abstract art important? Because it's progressive. Since the beginning of civilization most, if not all art was representational. Cavemen painted pictures of mammoth hunts and fertility goddesses on their cave walls, and up until very recently all that anyone in history could really do was paint that hunt a little more realistically. In the twentieth century (arguably a little bit earlier) artists deliberately moved away from representational art and simply tried to capture their feeling of a time and a place. This acceptance of emotion by itself, not attached to any concrete meaning is the essence of the abstract, and reflects a growth in the consciousness of humanity as a species. We're no longer just goofballs staring at the TV, watching whatever is on. We've taken it apart and now we're learning about electricity and transistors and LEDs and wires and the specifics of what makes the whole thing work.

&gt;So to answer your question: you should appreciate abstract art because of it's formal qualities. Look at the brush strokes. Look at the colors. Look at the size and shape of the work. Ask yourself why the artist made the decisions they made. Think about the feeling the artist was trying to communicate. Think about your own feelings while you look at an abstract piece of work. Is it uplifting? Depressing?Energizing? Chaotic? Orderly? And you should appreciate abstract art because of what it means as a milestone in the grand endevor of human expression. I should add that little reproductions of these works on your computer screen don't compare to the seeing the real deal. Go out and see art.",2015-07-22 12:42:11+00:00,ctc0z8i,1.0,t3_3e6m5u,7841.0,WTF

5627,"Yo, I wanted to help people see which questions /u/spez replied to, so I re-formatted it better. Here ya go:



#Content Policy

  **What is the policy regarding content that has distasteful speech, but not harassing?** Some subreddits have been known to harbor ideologies such as Nazism or racist ones. Are users, and by extension subreddits, allowed to behave in this way, or will this be banned or censored?

* Harboring unpopular ideologies is not a reason for banning.


**What is the policy regarding, well, [these subreddits][5]?** These subreddits are infamous on reddit as a whole. These usually come up during AskReddit threads of ""where would you not go"" or whenever distasteful subreddits are mentioned.

* (Based on the titles alone) Some of these should be banned since they are inciting violence, others should be separated.

**What actually is the harassment policy?** Yes, I know the definition that's practically copypasta from the announcement, but could we have examples? You don't have to define a hard rule, in fact, it'd probably be best if there was a little subjectivity to avoid lawyering, but it'd be helpful to have an example.

* This is the area that needs the most explanation. Filling someone’s inbox with PMs saying, “Kill yourself” is harassment. Calling someone stupid on a public forum is not.

**What are your thoughts on some people's interpretation of the rules as becoming a [safe-space][6]?** A vocal group of redditors interpreted the new harassment rules as this, and as such are not happy about it. I personally didn't read the rules that way, but I can see how it may be interpreted that way.


* It’s an impossible concept to achieve

**Do you have any plans to update the rules page?** It, at the moment, has 6 rules, and the only one that seems to even address the harassment policy is rule 5, which is at best reaching in regards to it.

 

* Yes. The whole point of this exercise is to consolidate and clarify our policies.

**What is the best way to report harassment?** For example, should we use /r/reddit.com's modmail or the contact@reddit.com email? How long should we wait before bumping a modmail, for example? 6. **Who is allowed to report harassment?** Say I'm a moderator, and decide to check a user's history and see they've followed around another user to 20 different subreddits posting the same thing or whatnot. Should I report it to the admins? 

* The Report button, /r/reddit.com modmail, contact@reddit.com (in that order). We’ll be doing a lot of work in the coming weeks to help our community managers respond quickly. Yes, if you can identify harassment of others, please report it.

#Brigading

**In regards to subreddits for mocking another group, what is the policy on them?** Subreddits that highlight other places being stupid or whatever, such as /r/ShitRedditSays, /r/SRSsucks, the ""Badpire"", /r/Buttcoin or pretty much any sub dedicated to mocking people frequently brigade each other and other places on reddit. SRS has gone out of it's way to harass in the past, and while bans may not be applied retroactively, some have recently said they've gotten death threats after being linked to from there. 


*  Mocking and calling people stupid is not harassment. Doxxing, following users around, flooding their inbox with trash is.

**What are the current plans to address brigading?** Will reddit ever support NP (and maybe implement it) or implement another way to curb brigading? This would solve very many problems in regards to meta subreddits.

* I have lots of ideas here. This is a technology problem I know we can solve. Sorry for the lack of specifics, but we’ll keep these tactics close to our chest for now.

**Is this [a good definition of brigading][3], and if not, what is it?** Many mods and users can't give a good explanation of it at the moment of what constitutes it. This forces them to resort to in SubredditDrama's case, banning voting or commenting altogether in linked threads, or in ShitRedditSays' case, not do anything at all. 

* **NOT ANSWERED**

#Related

 **What is spam?** Like yes, we know what obvious spam is, but there have been a number of instances in the past where good content creators have been banned for submitting their content. 

* The content creators one is an issue I’d like to leave to the moderators. Beyond this, if it’s submitted with a script, it’s spam.

**Regarding the [""Neither Alexis or I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech"" comment][1], how do you feel about [this][2], [this][7], [this][8] or [this][9]?** I do get that opinions change and that I could shit turds that could search reddit better than it does right now, but it's not hard to see that you said on multiple occasions, especially during the /r/creepshots debacle, even with the literal words ""bastion of free speech"". 

* While we didn’t *create* reddit to be a bastion of free speech, the concept is important to us. /r/creepshots forced us to confront these issues in a way we hadn’t done before. Although I wasn’t at Reddit at the time, I agree with their decision to ban those communities.

**How do you plan to implement the new policy?** If the policy is substantially more restrictive, such as combating racism or whatnot, I think you'll have a problem in the long run, because there is just way too much content on reddit, and it will inevitably be applied very inconsistently. Many subreddits have popped back up under different names after being banned.

* The main things we need to implement is the other type of NSFW classification, which isn’t too difficult.

**Did you already set the policy before you started the AMA, and if so, what was the point of it?** It seems like from the announcement, you had already made up your mind about the policy regarding content on reddit, and this has made some people understandably upset.

* No, we’ve been debating non-stop since I arrived here, and will continue to do so. Many people in this thread have made good points that we’ll incorporate into our policy. Clearly defining Harassment is the most obvious example.


**Do you have anything else to say regarding the recent events?** I know this has been stressful, but reddit is a cool place and a lot of people use it to share neat (sometimes untrue, but whatever) experiences and whatnot. I don't think the vast majority of people want reddit to implode on itself, but some of the recent decisions and remarks made by the admin team (and former team to be quite honest) are quite concerning.

* I know. It was frustrating for me to watch as an outsider as well. Now that I’m here, I’m looking forward to moving forward and improving things.

5829,"First of all mek is generally a good item because of two reasons: 

1. It gives the player more armour, better stats, etc. The armour is especially good for SF because early to mid game he is generally pretty squishy. 

2. It's an all around great team item. The passive aura that gives Regency is great and the instant heal is great for clutch moments. Buying a mek as a mid player especially releases the burden on your supports who can go for other team oriented items. It is also farmed faster than the supports so you can get it out earlier.
