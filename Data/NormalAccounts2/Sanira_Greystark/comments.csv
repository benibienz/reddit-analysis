26,"Hi all! This is my first /r/loseit challenge and I'm excited to participate! I'm 27/F/5'4. My highest weight was about 173lbs this summer, and I'm down 10 pounds after doing MFP/CICO for about six weeks. I recently started back to my ""gym"" - I do hour long fitness classes 2-4 times a week. The start date of the challenge falls perfectly for me because I will be finishing a two week cruise on that date! Hopefully I won't gain back too much weight on the ship, but I'm also going to enjoy myself. My biggest goals are to get back into my black skinny jeans for the winter, and hopefully hit a 28"" waist again soon. By Christmas/end of the year, I'm hoping to be another 4kg down (almost 9 pounds). When I get below 70 kilos, I'm treating myself to a new fountain pen :) 

Look forward to competing with you all. I'm going through and adding you on MFP/Fitbit. If I haven't, let me know and I'll PM you my username. ",2016-10-14 18:13:24+00:00,d8s2d89,1.0,t3_57gb22,17589.0,Team_Galaxy
