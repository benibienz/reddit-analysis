I've been lurking here for a while and seen a spur of intoductory posts so I thought I'd join the bandwagon. I'm an American who's living in France for just over four years. I'm thinking about moving back to the States some time next year, and one of the things I'm most excited about is having access to more affordable make-up (especially all the sales!). I'm 26 years old, and just got married in July. We have a very stubborn pet beagle named Cassie. I'm a teacher at a private school so I have to be mindful of what kind of makeup I wear to school, but I love experimenting with fun nail designs, especially around the holidays. I've also recently started wearing more lipstick and different colors. It's great to meet all of you and look forward to speaking more soon.

I've been lurking around here a while and am so impressed by all the amazing looks I've seen. I've been dabbling with makeup for about ten years, but only recently (read: am older and have a steady job) started looking at more high end products. I saw the Sephora advent calendar in the shop this week, and was wondering what you all think of it. Is it worth the 40 euro price tag? It looks like it's not available yet on the American site, but I'll include the link to the French site in the comments so you can have a look. 
I really appreciate all of your input! ",MakeupAddiction,Sephora Advent Calendar,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3qteoe/sephora_advent_calendar/
