We've seen trailers for the new Star Wars movie for a while now and it's still not released yet. But games will release their first trailer only a month or two before release.

The Warfare titles were different then the Blops titles so it did feel like a bi-annual release depending on which series you played.

Now infinite even has a zombie mode instead of spec ops which I found way more fun.

Sailing across the Atlantic was pretty cool if not a little worrisome.

I was a dishwasher so it wasn't the most glamorous job but that wasn't the worst part as it was easy but we worked a lot of hours. And I mean a lot! Easily clocked 70 hours a week as we worked every single day. We were allowed birthdays off and that's it. So working 5 months straight can get pretty tiring and stressful even if your job was easy. Also, maybe living in a small room with up to 3 other people could get old but you are only in there to sleep and if they work a different shift then you won't ever see them for very long but if you get a long with them and have stuff in common then it could be fun.",2016-04-28 19:53:32+00:00,d2l4aw0,4.0,t1_d2l2t1s,1950.0,pics

739,"You're right. I've had them all now, except for a standard 1440p. Started off with a 23"" 1080p but it was just too small so I went up to 27"" and loved it. Had an HP IPS and the colors and viewing angles were amazing. Then the 4k came about and was on sale during Black Friday and I just got back from a deployment so I had some extra cash and pulled the trigger. Aside from the obvious of it being higher resolution garnering some fantastic images when gaming, it was a TN panel so I could never get the colors right. I would be watching a walkthrough on YouTube and notice that colors were more washed out on my monitor vs my phone or tablet and would always fiddle with the settings. 

Playing games like Tomb Raider, Crisis 3, Mad Max, and Metal Gear Solid V was a sight to behold in 4k. Unfortunately, like I mentioned before, even with a Crossfire 290x setup, frame-rates weren't all that desirable. Most newer games fluctuated between 25-30 frames so I generally kept it at 1440p instead which sort of defeated the purpose. 

Honestly, if you have a rig that can game in 4k and you don't play competitive/twitch shooters, then, no question, get that. The amount of detail you get with that resolution is amazing.

845,"From an article published by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency back on 20 July 1988:

Orthodox Child with Rare Ailment is Rescued Aboard Tycoon's Jet

The private Boeing 727 of real estate tycoon Donald Trump arrived from Los Angeles at LaGuardia Airport, carrying aboard an Orthodox Jewish child with a rare and still undiagnosed breathing illness.

The child, Andrew Ten, age 3, arrived with his parents — accompanied by three nurses who attend to him around the clock — to try to seek medical help in the New York area.

Trump made his plane available for the special trip to New York after the boy's parents, Judy and Harold Ten, called Trump and told him of their plight.

861,"Just got back so it's still fresh in my head: 

The last half was a mess. I hated how Batman suddenly didn't want to kill Superman just because his mom has his same name. I also hated how Lex knew who Superman was so incredibly easily and knew everything about his life. Also, if Gotham is right next to Metropolis then how hasn't Clark heard about Batman? Even growing up as a kid, he never turned on the news? Bats has been fighting crime for 20 years yet it seems like he's new in town. 

The trailer seriously ruined everything. Doomsday should have been a surprise. It shouldn't have shown them all teaming up. I like how the first trailer made it look like everyone was fighting each other and it would have been cool if Wonder-Woman fought Superman for a bit before smacking some sense into him and Bats. 

Batman killing people was pretty badass but I wish it explained why he does it now. I mean, he was seriously blowing shit up and shooting the fuck out of people. This is a man who has lost everything but we don't even know how it got to that point. 

I hated Lex. I mean, with a passion. I was really hoping he was just Lex Luthor Jr and that the real Lex was going to be shown in prison or something and would eventually show up and smack his son for being a crazy idiot, even until the end since he mentioned his father so much, but nope. It was him. Such a terrible character. 

I hated the way Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg were introduced. Why did Lex have them on file? For what purpose? And he already had them named? Seriously? Cyborg had a C type symbol but he wasn't even a Cyborg at that point. I guess Aquaman could be a code name since they don't know his real one. But the W for Wonder-Woman was really lame. So Lex is the original creator of the Justice League now? 

Superman stopping Batman was also dumb as hell. He obviously saw the guys in the truck shooting at him and stuff so why didn't he stop them? And after that Batman knew right away where they took the cryptonite so why didn't he go straight there and steal it? 

I really have no need to see this again and can't wait for Civil War to show how a superhero versus is made.",2016-03-25 05:02:48+00:00,d1cqmur,1.0,t3_4bupv2,10997.0,movies

915,This just happened last month. I was working a job in the bay area when on the first day a group of workers were clocking back in from break when one guy walked by that I instantly recognized from somewhere. I'm standing there just staring at him for about 5 seconds trying to figure out where I know him from when he catches me and I can tell by the look on his face that he recognizes me as well. I said I know him from somewhere and he agrees. Come to find out he and I worked on the same cruise ship in Hawaii together in 2005. It was so random. He looks exactly the same but it was crazy that he recognized me as I probably gained some 30 pounds and even had a beard which I didn't have back then.,2016-03-11 04:53:08+00:00,d0vn67m,1.0,t3_49wvo2,5595.0,AskReddit

1480,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day

&gt; Remembrance Day (also known as Poppy Day) is a memorial day observed inCommonwealth of Nations member states since the end of the First World War to remember the members of their armed forces who have died in the line of duty. 


&gt; Veterans Day is observed in the United States on 11 November, and is both a federal holiday and a state holiday in all states. However, the function of the observance elsewhere is more closely matched by Memorial Day in May. In the United States, and some other allied nations, 11 November was formerly known as Armistice Day; in the United States it was given its new name in 1954 at the end of theKorean War to honor all veterans. Veterans Day is observed with memorial ceremonies, salutes at military cemeteries, and parades.


&gt; In the United Kingdom, Armed Forces' Day(formerly Veterans' Day) is a separate commemoration, celebrated for the first time on 27 June 2009.

1495,"This is one of  my favorite horror movies and I still don't quite grasp how the alien works exactly but I can kind of ELI5. 

Imagine the alien as a single cell and a person/animal as another single cell. Once the thing comes into contact with another being then it merges with it, just like the computer animation of the cells. You can see how it works in the prequel/remake with the blonde haired dude and how the alien was basically merging it's face as soon as it makes contact and how in the Carpenter movie when the dude at the end puts his hand through the other guy's face. The alien has control of every part of it's body on a molecular level which is why it freaks out when the blood gets burned.

So now that we vaguely know how the alien works, really the only confusing parts are when the members of the team actually get infected but I think as long as a single cell makes its way inside a person then that's all it takes. Similar to how it 28 Days/Weeks Later where once a single drop of blood enters the body then you're fucked.

I guess the final film left a lot of the script out and the editing messed up other things so all the gaps pretty much have to just be filled in yourself. It seems like the alien could have easily just waited for people to fall asleep and infect them secretly instead of all violently but it could just be a dumb animal trying to survive. Or maybe it takes the information of the animal it infected and doesn't transfer any knowledge along and essentially starts fresh in each new host. So it started out as a dog and all it knew was how to act like a dog until it moved to the first person and so on and so forth.

1.Why didn't the crew use the Rover to drive to the rocket at the beginning of the storm instead of walking?

2.If they knew a storm was coming, why weren't they preparing to leave? What the hell were they even doing planting little flags that would have obviously blown away? If that was the last day of their mission and they were going to take off anyway then why did they leave all their stuff behind? Why wasn't it already packed and ready to go? All their personal belongs fit into separate tubs so why not have it ready to go? It really made no sense. I get the storm was faster then they thought but did it get there a week too early?

It's very open world and you can tackle the world the way you want. There are also camps that you associate with that you can upgrade by finding specific parts but that's optional.

* color os is pretty bad so I flashed cyanogenmod and it runs great but at some point my phone was stuck in an infinite loop at the boot screen and it took a lot of trial and error to get it back to stock and reflash cyanogenmod onto it.
