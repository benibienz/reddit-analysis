I seriously love these games and it baffles me why Sony just didn't make it themselves and put some more money into it. The CGI had no wow factor to it and seriously felt like something they should have released directly through the PlayStation store. So skip the theater and just rent it. In the end it is a kid's movie but I had 3 with me and 2 were bored within 30 minutes. Go see The Jungle Book instead which was fantastic.

Edit: So I got downvoted for not going into details as to why I thought the movie was terrible. As if I work for some company against the movie and am bashing it just because.

1. The movie is cut straight from the PS4 game. Almost exactly. So if you played the game, then you've seen the movie. It should have been just a standalone movie with a different origin. Show how Ratchet made it to the planet and him growing up to be the lovable outcast being the only one of his species before getting to him as an adult and saving the galaxy. There are dozens of YouTube videos of people who pieced together videogame cutscenes to essential create a movie. This is exactly that but now you're expected to spend money to see it. There are a few things not in the game for continuity, like boss fights that were gameplay is now a scene in the movie instead obviously but the solution on how the bad guy is defeated is still the same. 

2. The CG isn't all that great. Good for a videogame but not a full length theatrical release film. Planet 51 looks better and that was made by a random studio in Madrid. I have no idea why it just wasn't an original production made by Sony Pictures Animation.

3. Since it was cut straight from the game, you can watch the whole thing for free through walkthroughs on YouTube, so why spend money to see it in theaters? They added and took away a few things, but it's not enough to warrant the ticket price especially if you have kids. If I didn't win tickets to the screening, I would have paid money to see it with my kids and I would have been pissed.

4. It seems a lot more kiddy than the games. Although the games are kid friendly, there are a lot of adult innuendos and jokes thrown in. Not to the extent of Shrek or anything but they are there. However, there are none in the movie. If there are some in the game then they cut them out or changed them.

There. Hopefully that clears things up. This movie will be out of theaters in a month and will be on PSN to rent for $5, so just wait until then if you MUST see it. Just don't spend money at the cinema.",PS4,Oh God. The Ratchet and Clank movie was terrible.,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/4g4j35/oh_god_the_ratchet_and_clank_movie_was_terrible/

I've downloaded mods, turned God rays off, lowered shadow quality, yet I still get massive frame drops and even unexpected desktop crashes. When are developers going to be held accountable? 

I have a crazy theory that may bring out the tin foil hats but here we go. Developers are purposely making bad games so they can KEEP their jobs. In a highly competitive market, you have to do what you can to survive and keep your job. Once the game is done then you have a whole team, sometimes hundreds of people, now out of a job. Sure, they could move onto the next title but what if that game doesn't need as many people? So now you have 2 or 3 HUNDRED people looking for a job. 

So here come the shitty ports. No matter how bad the game, the developers still got paid. The game studio still paid them their salary, so if a game runs bad, or doesn't run at all, it doesn't matter to them. They still got the same amount of money as if they churned out a perfectly running one. Except with the perfectly running one, now they are out of a job. Unless they make a shitty game that requires them to stick around and fix it, thus continuing to get paid. Just last night I was playing and the npc to complete a mission was stuck inside the world and I couldn't get to them. I saw that they were moving so I waited around a bit and they eventually popped out of the environment until around 20 minutes later when the game crashed to desktop with no sort of error message. 

So anyway, yea, one month later and Bethesda doesn't even seem all that concerned with fixing any of the problems and people have resorted to fixing it themselves which makes me feel like we are living in bizarro world and it's sad that we aren't safe from any studio now, even the ones we've come to expect to make a quality product. 

What are your thoughts in the state of the gaming industry and besides no pre-ordering or waiting a year until all the bugs are fixed, what can we do as customers?

I run the game at a smooth 60 frames most of the time but then it dips into the teens at times which is insane although I possibly might know the root of my problem. The movers came and packed the power cord to my monitor on accident so I had to resort to using my television. It's 1080p @ 60hz but I'm playing via hdmi so it may be limiting something. I'm running two 290x cards in crossfire which is overkill to play a game at 1080p so it should have any issues running this game. No matter what options I turn off in the settings the framerate still stays the same. Steady 60 until I get into more dense areas and they just plummet.

 I'm sure many, if not all, of you are familiar with the Google Opinion Rewards app that gives you credit to use for answering simple surveys. I own many Android devices (I have a problem) and I noticed that I would receive surveys to each individual device separately. So make sure you install it to every device you own so you can receive more surveys!

Edit: Apologies to those in countries who don't have this app. If it ever comes to your region, now you know how to get more surveys.

Edit 2: For those who are signed up but have never received a survey, there could be a few factors. Google asked several questions when you signed up to determine what kind of surveys to send you. If you sort of just answered whatever then nothing possibly pertains to you so they haven't found a relevant survey to send. Some people say it's location based but I can tell you right now that that is just not the case. I am an American living in a rural area of England and I don't go anywhere but I get surveys at least once a week. I believe it goes off your search history using Chrome. So if you use another Web browser then it won't pick up on your search habits which won't contribute to Google at all so they won't send a survey. At least that's what I believe. My mom gets surveys all the time and I know for a fact she goes nowhere but she us usually sitting on her phone searching something.

This is a long read so hope you bear with me. I am separating from the military soon and moving to Dallas-Fort Worth area after spending most of my life in California and I'd like to get a good idea what we are getting into. We've spent the past 5 years straight in England and before that 2 years were spent in the DC area. Prior to this, my wife and I grew up in the central valley of cali but we hated it and do not want to get stuck raising our kids there. Plus housing is expensive, there are no real jobs to make a career out of, there's no water, tons of pollution, it's always on fire, and it's generally a dirty place to live. So I made the decision to move us to Texas and start fresh. 


Being in the military, you meet people from all over but a lot of people are from Texas. The one thing they agreed on is the DFW area would be the best place to live and find work. 


I have a few general questions that I'd like to get answered to get a feel for the place before arriving. 


1.What are the people like? Are they pretty friendly and welcoming or stick to themselves?


2.Is the city kid friendly with plenty to do or will we be traveling? 


3.My kids have never been camping due to England having shitty weather all year round, so are there great camping spots within 2 hours of driving?


4.Is there a main industry that one can jump into and make a decent living? 


5.We will be arriving in January. What are the winters like so we know what to prepare for?

As in $70 cheap with a Kinect! However, when I got home and put a movie in, it had no problems reading a disc, however there was a loud buzzing sound coming from the drive. After doing a quick Google search I come to find that a lot of people had noisy drives and found a video of a guy opening it up and moving a part that tends to get stuck.

So an hour ago I hit up the xbox support and I tell her I got an xbox one that is making a buzzing sound and to see if my console had it's warranty extended by any chance before I opened it up. After a long conversation verifying my account she tells me that it was no longer under warranty and asked if I wanted to process a ticket to get it fixed. I explained that this is a known issue and asked if MS was fixing the issue for free out of warranty like they did with the 360 when it got the RRoD. She goes off to talk to a manager and after some more verifying she straight up tells me a replacement console will arrive in 10 days free of charge and that I didn't even need to ship my broken one! I was floored! I would have gladly mailed the thing off for them to fix or to replace but for them to just straight up send me one is just amazing. Now to wait for the Halo to come out.

(Quite the mouthful of a name). I just got the thing during a Father's Day sale and I love it but haven't used most of it's features as my internet in the UK is unbelievably crappy. Anyway, so here I was minding my own business when the TV suddenly changed and started to stream a music video. I was a bit confused and looked at the kids and saw that they managed to stream it from my tablet. I have a Chromecast and for a second thought that was it but then it dawned on me that I've had the thing unplugged for a while. I go to change it back to my game but then realize that the input changed to TV when it started so I was even more confused. I have a Sony TV so I figured there must be a feature or something for Xperia devices to communicate. No biggie.

Skip to today and I wanted to put a movie on for the kids and wanted to do what they did and I cannot figure it out. I looked everywhere on the YouTube app and there is no button to select. The kids literally just randomly did it and I have no idea how. They didn't mirrorcast it because you have to actually set it up and select the TV and it mirrors everything on the tablet, which they didn't do. It was the same way how the Chromecast works where it will just play as soon as you select the content.
