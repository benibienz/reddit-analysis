It's vastly known that the american public is lied to by 2 incredibly biased news sources so listening to them only adds a confounding variable onto an already flawed population as stated earlier. Taking a pure collection of votes cast by the American people is not the best idea because of all of our lacking true knowledge on the matter. So what I'm saying is if 11,000 people woke up, stood in line at the poll, and voted for a dead gorilla then listening to the American people only is not a great idea.
