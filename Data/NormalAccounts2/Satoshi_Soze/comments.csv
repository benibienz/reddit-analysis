6,What was it like for George Lucas? A taste of true success with American Graffiti - then several years crafting Star Wars which really drained his finances. Then BINGO! super-success with him also brilliantly negotiating the rights to all merchandising and future FILMS. Then all future success hangs in the balance because of this ... abomination. The daily update reports he received must have been torture - some cocky little shits wanting to quickly cash in on his carefully crafted idea without a clue as to how to satisfy the admirers of his work. Also potentially wrecking Lucas' career if he stands by it.,2016-11-17 20:10:51+00:00,da4nm51,1.0,t3_5dgk9r,14858.0,fullmoviesonyoutube

Shepard Smith, a news anchor for the Fox News Channel, referred to it as a ""'70s train wreck, combining the worst of Star Wars with the utter worst of variety television."" 

This is for people interested in 70s culture, Marketing, Advertising, Media, and all the things Bill Hicks hated when he said ""By the way, if anyone here is in advertising or marketing, kill yourself.

259,":) not sarcastic. Obviously any comment, on any post anywhere can affect PR - I'm reminded of a parody by ""Not the nine 'o clock news"" of the programme ""points of view"" where a hand-written letter pops up and a regimented voice says ""The licence fee is far too low, it should be at least 300 pounds"" followed by a different one that ends with ""...I'd gladly sell my house and all its contents to help the BBC"" (you get the idea).

As it happens, my experience of ASDA employees is that they seem happy and ""happy to help"" as it says on their backs. I posted this obviously for awareness. Certain management styles breed unhealthyness in a workplace - forewarned is forearmed.

Anyway, as a shopper I like ASDA - but Morrisons is top of the heap for me, their bakery offerings and deli counters do it for me. Aldi - I don't like the taste of many of their things, especially confectionery.",2016-07-10 11:03:13+00:00,d56jkrw,5.0,t1_d562rrx,39995.0,fullmoviesonyoutube

But given how they are apparently going to blunder through this and a drug-fuelled confrontation seems inevitable, I'll carry on watching... final verdict ... meh.

Constructive criticism - the grass dealer was too dull(ed), more humour should have been in this - given the opportunities. Drivers should have been sober and straight - that's a must. It was too rushed. If I was to plan this, I would have suggested e.g. seven drugs in 7 nights with morning footage after every night. I would have two or three ""takers"" per session and at least one ""sitter"" who would remain straight (but not necessarily totally sober). The way this was done didn't capture the spirit of any of the drugs involved - except maybe the meth. There was obviously some tripping spirit there, but given there was a lot of smoking going on....

406,"reading the comments... what about the psychological aspects? GENERALLY, and despite shifting sexual trends, orgasms for women are more driven by the emotional than the physical - the emotional is often less a part of it for men. Of course, you can enquire as to her physical preferences - great idea, but use your imagination as to what will enhance the orgasm from a psychological perspective.

Letting her know that you are enjoying it [whatever the act] too is most important - lustful vocalising or whispers help. N.B. what a man does with his mouth is usually quite important to a woman.

Compound the pleasure with some additional/other physical stimulation. Nipple attention is often gratefully received and it's surprising how much some women like a man's fingers running through their hair.

You could even try teasing, by easing off a bit and then giving her slightly more than she asks for - experiment playfully. Nature designed sex to be the most fun thing there is.

Finally, some women prefer the clit to be left alone once Mr wobbly has hidden his helmet - now you have two hands free to do other things - plus you can adopt a closer, more comfortable and more intimate position.

I accepted pink floyd without Roger Waters - as Pink Floyd. I noticed it wasn't as ""ballsy"" but it still had some good bits.

It would be a sad end if this was his last contribution to music. I'd like to see him (Dave Gilmour) ditch his perceived respectability, go on a drink/whatever bender and emerge playing some violent and painful blues guitar - even if it's just as a guest.

Ray Winstone's character Lenny Milton is a ""lowly"" DC who is known for being a very straight cop, unlike most of his colleagues who have been corrupted in one way or another. His best friend DCI Mike Love, who is also his boss is being investigated for corruption and Lenny is persuaded to lend a helping hand obtaining evidence.

776,"After careful consideration - There are things we need to remember. Mostly that this is FULL MOVIES [on YouTube].

I think Playlists are a good idea - if Tagged as [playlist] as long as everything on the playlist is either a full movie or a deleted video and doesn't link to outside YouTube.

However, I noticed a single file of ""Century of the self"" the other day, comprising of 6(?) episodes strung together. There is a Subreddit /r/FullTVshowsonYouTube that is suitable for files such as this IMHO - great stuff but not a movie. Also, the TV shows sub is much less used than this sub so could do with the extra traffic. Plus, a [Playlist] with all of a given series on there would be great.

Edit: Am I wrong about the""Century of the self"" paragraph above? Cos it is like a feature length documentary. On reflection treat it as a ""grey area"" and allow it? or not?
