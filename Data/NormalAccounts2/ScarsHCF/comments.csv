25,"My opinions:

Solo/Duo DTR: Honestly dumbest thing I've seen in a while

Chat Filter: sure, pretty sure this is already a thing

Finding cheaters: terrible idea, if I were screensharing I'd drop 40 fps which would make me have to pvp with 30-40 fps...

Border expansion: they do this every week after citadel -_-

Glowstone mountain: one idea I finally agree with

High grind kit: honestly don't care, doesn't really make a difference

Higher DB: 4 hours pro/high roller, 5 hours vip, 6 hours default. should never become above this or the server will die out fast. (like it or not the community has changed a lot and this would never work)

Archer/Bard fix: Shotbow bard/archer

Faction/enemies name color: dumb idea lmao

Invis: sure invis raiding is fun but they need to make it so if you are hit they can see your name.

Gapples craftable: sure

Allying: either make an official 1 ally (in plugin) or something or don't allow allying.",2016-11-03 20:21:17+00:00,d9khgna,1.0,t3_5awhh3,27455.0,hcteams

200,"Everyone is a random at one point, not like everyone just starts out with good tier 2 or tier 1 factions, the only way I got noticed was because my friend got me MallCops then they disbanded so I joined Compton and left Compton when they went raidable (keep in mind these were pretty bad factions) When they went raidable I and a friend GalaxyRaidz took the decent/good members from their faction and made a faction called Milkyway map 14 on kohi and stayed playing until map 16 just under a different name and leadership over the maps. We were ""just numbers"" but we won 3/4 fights we were in and managed to cap 2 conquests in our maps playing (with N9NE and Insertion). You have to work to get in good factions simple as that, I personally suggest making your own faction with decent members that you see LFF or even just be that faction that gives complete ""randoms"" chances.

Rogue is a bit iffy needs to be balanced if added for sure though.

""You know.. I don't think there was one time through the 4 months where I harassed to the point where I said I didn't feel like logging because I couldn't take what a bunch of children over the internet said to me. When people call you a shitty staff member that should make you want to work harder to appease them. The customer is always right mentality. Not everyone can be helped. But you can do your best at helping everyone.""

Ok for me and the other factions moderators specifically we have the [Mod] prefix but we are only Global chat mods and mods on factions so we get it the worse cause everyone thinks we don't do anything and even when we tell them we are only chat mods the prefix is just glitch they don't listen most of the time and continue shit talking until we just have to mute them, also I do try my best to help everyone out I even go to reports even though I can't ban and will record them hacking and get them banned or ask in staff chat to see if anyone is on to ban them. Also we don't even need to log on practice 2 if we don't want to but we still do to try and help out those mods with the constant spam/toxicity that happens on prac2 (factions mods and global chat mods)

""People have the right to be mad about the KB. A lot of people donate specificly because they expect the server to be the best it can very be. Especially with 10,000 players. You're providing the players a service in which, a lot of them paid for.."" 

Yes I paid for platinum rank throughout my 2 years on kohi, I understand why everyone is mad and I am upset about the KB myself but that doesn't mean they should start a chat spam every hour or so saying ""#OldKohi"" even when soooooo many people complained about the old kohi... even though I do agree that the ""Old kohi"" was better but things have changed and it is time to move on and not just be immature about the whole situation as the KB simply just isn't that easy to be fixed.

""I didn't say anything about L being a mutable offense or not. That's exactly why you're not going to respond to it.
Thanks for helping make Badlion a better Network. (Seriously)""

Sorry I took what you said out of context and assumed when you said what you said you meant it shouldn't be mutable because for some reason a lot of people believe it shouldn't be mutable and thank you means a lot since not many people give the staff.

I'm sure as an ex staff member you remember being harassed yourself for being a ""shitty staff member"" etc....

Have you ever been kicked before? why? - Only factions I've been kicked for on my past factions are Aloha for being inactive cause wasn't having fun then for dying in a 3 way fight against you guys and shooters, pearled on the kid intentions said to target but 4 secondsish later he says to pearl west so 15 of em turn around i get knocked in a water gank pearl blocked ripped and kicked. Kicked from DawnLite for not being social enough with the members but I played with most the members on kohi so that was a confusion :P. Kicked from WolfGang trying to help a team member out saving him then dying in nether to a 10v1 from the person i saved :P. Basically I think I just need a faction that is good and knows what they are doing to stick with and play with for future maps to come. Also both deaths in wolfgang and aloha were my first and only deaths in the faction just got kicked for 1 death :(",2016-03-06 03:21:20+00:00,d0p7v4e,1.0,t3_495d29,4477.0,hcteams

Mic/ts3: I get no background noise and I usually have my mic muted during fights until I need help/need to say something important then I press a button to unmute.

PvP(1/10): 7/10 I'd, I do prefer team fights over 1v1s though

BB(1/10): 6/10 I will bb when needed or if I am bored or if I am told to.

Communication(1/10): 10/10 I don't panic, I don't say useless shit and I don't scream whenever we kill somebody/somebody in our faction dies, I do still like to have fun with faction members but I know when to have fun and when to chill out.

PvP (/10 - It would be good if you told us your best elo, either on BL or Practice2.0): like 6-7/10 I guess, my best global elo on kohi was around 1550 I think, I'm usually around the 1300-1400 mark with map 16 but rn I'm low cause I dropped myself down to 700 and have just been fucking around since.

BB (/10): 7/10 I will do work whenever it is needed or I am told to.

Mining (/10): 10/10 I am not really the luckiest miner but I will still mine whatever is needed per week from each faction member (if that is a thing)

Past Factions: MallCops (Map 13), Compton (Map 14), My faction Milkyway (Map 14/15,) Zen/GamingGoggles/PorchMonkeys (Map 15/16), AutoBots (Map 18/19), AnimalFarm (Map 19/20), Rio (Map 20), Tropical (Map 21), NWA (Map 20/21) Aloha (Map 21/22), Swift (Map 22), DawnLiteEOTW (Map 22), Omnicious (Map 21/22/23), Dispatch (Map 23), Bankrupt (current/Map 24) HCTeams: Carnage (Map 4/5), Misfits(Map 7), DawnLite (Map 8), Malice (Map 8), Aloha (Map 9), Ravage (Map 9)

Past Betrayls: I betrayed a faction map 14 on kohi called 3Hunna I think it was, I'll never inside any faction again cause I'm not a scummy immature faggot anymore.

Why you and not others?: You should pick me because I am extremely active if I am having fun in the faction and I have a pretty good amount of experiences with factions. I can also bard really well and won't drop unless it is 4am and I am high as fuck.

Other Info: I do online school so I can be really active if I want to, I can bard/archer pretty well but I prefer bard/diamond. Also ask around the faction for vouches from them, I will probs get atleast like 10 and here is my past lff post https://www.reddit.com/r/kohi/comments/3wzlt5/scars_lff/",2016-01-31 21:37:38+00:00,cziyt9e,1.0,t3_43kzvv,967.0,hcteams

Age: 16

Mic/ts3: I get no background noise and I usually have my mic muted during fights until I need help/need to say something important then I press a button to unmute.

PvP(1/10): 6/10 I'd say in 1v1s, I do prefer team fights over 1v1s though

BB(1/10): I will bb when needed or if I am bored or if I am told to. (don't really know what to rate myself lol)

Communication(1/10): 10/10 I don't panic, I don't say useless shit and I don't scream whenever we kill somebody/somebody in our faction dies, I do still like to have fun with faction members but I know when to have fun and when to chill out.

Age: 16

Mic/ts3: I get no background noise and I usually have my mic muted during fights until I need help/need to say something important then I press a button to unmute.

PvP(1/10): 7/10 I'd say, I do prefer team fights over 1v1s though

BB(1/10): I will bb when needed or if I am bored or if I am told to. (don't really know what to rate myself lol)

Communication(1/10): 10/10 I don't panic, I don't say useless shit and I don't scream whenever we kill somebody/somebody in our faction dies, I do still like to have fun with faction members but I know when to have fun and when to chill out.


Past Factions: MallCops (Map 13), Compton (Map 14), My faction Milkyway (Map 14/15,) Zen/GamingGoggles/PorchMonkeys (Map 15/16), AutoBots (Map 19), AnimalFarm (Map 19/20), Rio (Map 20), Tropical (Map 21), NWA (Map 20/21) Aloha (Map 21/22), Swift (Map 22), DawnLiteEOTW (Map 22), Omnicious (Map 21/22/23), Dispatch (Map 23) HCTeams: Carnage (Map 4/5), Misfits(Map 7), DawnLite (Map 8), Malice (Map 8)

How Active Are You?: https://kohi.net/u/Scars/factions/ I have been very active this map on kohi and I currently don't have a faction on kohi so I will dedicate all my time to HCTeams + it has been a while since I've played HCTeams full time and I think it would be fun again

Age: 16

Mic/ts3: I get no background noise and I usually have my mic muted during fights until I need help/need to say something important then I press a button to unmute.

PvP(1/10): 7/10 I'd, I do prefer team fights over 1v1s though

BB(1/10): 6/10 I will bb when needed or if I am bored or if I am told to (SOTW I will no life bb the first 2-3 days, however long until we start pvping)

Communication(1/10): 10/10 I don't panic, I don't say useless shit and I don't scream whenever we kill somebody/somebody in our faction dies

Past Factions: MallCops (Map 13), Compton (Map 14), My faction Milkyway (Map 14/15,) Zen/GamingGoggles/PorchMonkeys (Map 15/16), AutoBots (Map 19), AnimalFarm (Map 19/20), Rio (Map 20), Tropical (Map 21), NWA (Map 20/21) Aloha (Map 21/22), Swift (Map 22), DawnLiteEOTW (Map 22), Omnicious (Map 21/22/23) HCTeams: Carnage (Map 4/5), Misfits(Map 7), DawnLite (Map 8), Malice (Map 8)

How Active Are You?: I do online school and no life mc on weekends/most weekdays, so very active.

Copy and pasted an old app. To salty: You denied me before because you said I was a faction hopper but that isn't true at all, I have been in a lot of factions ya that is true but if you played the maps that I've been in multiple factions in one map then you'd know that these factions that I usually ended up leaving were cause they went inactive soooo ye hmu.

PvP Skill(1-10): 6-7/10 in 1v1s (depends on day i guess) 8/10 in team fights I always listen to callouts and know how to stick on a guy.

Base Work Skill(1-10): 6/10 I can do base work whenever it is needed (sotw or before events) or whenever I am just told to do base work.

What will you do more of (PvP/Base Bitch): Base work during sotw but PvP probably later in the map, but I will still do base work during the map.

How active are you able to be?: Very active I do online school.

How did you like the koths/conquest system? Bring back more old koths and the koth loot system I think that koth swords shouldn't be as common but neither should the ""shit loot"" that people get, just balance it on what tier key you get for what time of the day that koth is capped.

How did you like the 20 man factions? I mean it was cool at first but I prefer 30 man rosters to be honest.

How did you like DTC? I like dtc, kind of gay because you can die of fall damage extremely easy though.

Anything we could of done to make things more enjoyable? Just enforce the insiding rule, don't allow people to just crit you out in your base if they get cycled and make you raidable or some shit like that, also there have been a few insiders who have literally gotten away with it so easily by just lying to the staff and them believing it.

BB (/10): 7/10, I base bitch when it is needed and when I am told to, I don't mind base bitching but like most people I prefer pvping.

Mining (/10): 6/10 I mine whenever I am told and in the beginning of the map it is basically all I do unless I am told to do something different, I put 6/10 because I am ass at mining I guess I just don't know how to do it lol but check my past maps stats for stone to diamond ratio and you will understand what I mean.

Past Factions: MallCops (Map 13) Compton (Map 14) My faction Milkyway (Map 14/15) Zen/GamingGoggles/PorchMonkeys (Map 15/16), AutoBots (Map 19 until they quit), AnimalFarm (Map 19/20), Rio (Map 20), NWA (Map 20), Omnicious (Map 21 until they quit), Tropical (Map 21) HCTeams: Carnage (Map 4/5), Misfits/Medieval (Map 7), Void (Map 8)

Past Betrayls: I betrayed a small faction in map 13 or 14 I forget but I haven't even thought of doing it since because my rep went to complete booty after I betrayed, I am now once again friends with the owner I was just an immature 14 year old at the time.

Why you and not others? I am very active and I am very experienced in HCF I joined map 12 on kohi but my first power fac was map 13. I also rarely drop and when I do I make up for it by mining or doing other base work. I am also on for every event unless I literally can't get on (Funeral, wedding, the important family/friends events fuck birthday parties tho)

Other Info: I do have some sort of a social life that I have gotten recently lol, I usually only hang out with friends during the week and no life mc during the weekends as basically all my friends are either graduated or do online school.

Activity (/10) - 8/10 I do online school and I am very active

PvP - 6.5/10 in 1v1s 7.5/10 in team fights

Elo - (Elo on practice2.0/Talk about teamfights): this season my highest elo was 1400 so far (not that good but not terrible) I got drained by hackers so rip elo :P

Are you fine with weekly mining: Yup

Pot Brewing/Base building: I know how to brew pots it's very easy, and I am trash at building but good at interior design.

Timezone: EST (US)

Age: 16

Past Factions: MallCops (Map 13) Compton (Map 14) My faction Milkyway (Map 14/15) Zen/GamingGoggles/PorchMonkeys (Map 15/16), AutoBots (Map 19 until they quit), AnimalFarm (Map 19/20), Rio (Map 20), NWA (Map 20), Omnicious (Map 21 until they quit), Tropical (Map 21) HCTeams: Carnage (Map 4/5), Misfits/Medieval (Map 7),

Why should you join and not others: I am very active and I am very experienced in HCF I joined map 12 but my first power fac was map 13. I also rarely drop and when I do I make up for it by mining.
