Age: 16

Time zone: EST (US) But I am basically EU I guess because my sleeping schedule is me waking up at 12pm my time and going to sleep at like 4-6am my time.

Fluent Languages Spoken: English

Skype: Yes, I will message whoever I need to privately so I don't get ddos'd etc....

Teamspeak: Yup I use teamspeak basically everyday.

Why I should be chosen as a staff member: I should be chosen to be staff on iPvP because I am very experienced, I am very very active, I do online school and get all a's and b's so school is nothing to worry about for me and it takes me very little time to do my school work (so i can moderate a lot more then others), I am kind to others and try to be respectful to every person I talk to.

Have you had any past experience?: I'm only going to name the notable servers that I've been staff on. 

EliteKits: Was once OP on it until my server McCritZ unpartnered with them, I then received moderator rank and made it to Mod+ before I resigned due to issues with a certain staff member that are now resolved.

McCritZ: Was moderator on the McCritZ that yellow, vintage, and galaxy owned, Later became Owner when me and Galaxy and Buddokan remade the server.

McDreamZ: Made it to Mod+ before I resigned due to no players joining the server and erkums not caring about it.

Kohi: Made it to moderator before I was demoted (Ask me if you want to know why)

CrossPrison: Was an operator on the server, it averaged about 100-200 players before it shut down it's final time due to the owner not caring.

Para: Helper for like 3 days but got demoted for being inactive even though I messaged the staff manager I was going to be inactive cause I was at the mountains for the weekend.

When did you join iPvP?: I joined when it first came out.

Are you staff member on any other servers?: I am currently Mod on EliteKits

Why do you want to become staff?: I want to become staff because I enjoy being staff on servers and helping players out, and no offense but the staff on iPvP are pretty bad as of right now and I would like to help change that the best I can by becoming a moderator.

About me: I am a junior in high school, I do online school, I have been playing minecraft since 1.8 beta, I am experienced with HCF servers so I don't have down syndrome when it comes to pot pvp, I am a kind person and I think if you were to give me a chance at moderator you wouldn't regret it.",ipvp_network,Scars Staff Application,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipvp_network/comments/3v2wl4/scars_staff_application/
