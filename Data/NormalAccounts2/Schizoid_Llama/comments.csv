Hoping the government addresses poverty, lack of education, and other issues that lead to crime/violence, as well as stuff like giving to charity, is a good temporary solution but does relatively little in the long run.

128,"I am probably newer to anarcho-communism than you are, but my hunch is that there isn't any hypocrisy in believing in the sort of god you describe and having skepticism in illegitimate authority. Many may see god as an illegitimate/unnecessary authority and would thus not believe in one on their own accord, but you wouldn't necessarily have to do so in order to be an anarchist. I think it's important to think critically of organized religion, which you seem to, but if you believe in or even just are open to, say a spiritual sort of deity that isn't in any way humanoid, and it helps comfort you, value life more, or in some way makes you a better person, then don't feel you have to stop believing based on what others think. 

Consider reading these sections of the anarchist FAQ:

As far as the phrase goes, I'm not really sure. I suppose you would have to decide for yourself. If you see your concept of a higher power as a God in the traditional sense, then to me it doesn't make sense to use that phrase. If you see the idea of God in a traditional sense being a sort of an oppressive and unnecessary figurehead, but, for example, believe in something along the lines of what I described earlier, then I would think that using the phrase would more so be criticising a traditional God rather than your version, which (I would hope) you wouldn't view as being oppressive. 

I'm totally new to all of this and may be talking out of my ass, but this is sort of my idea. Feel free to discredit anything I said. ",2016-07-31 18:03:51+00:00,d5yjn84,1.0,t3_4vi0m2,2429.0,Anarchy101

231,"Really, it's just the fear that people are constantly thinking you're an idiot. 


Let's say you are giving a presentation in school. Chances are, you are far more worried about giving the presentation than making the presentation. You either are directly reading a script, or following a well rehearsed mental script the whole time. While you present, you have to look off in the distance and try to avoid eye contact with anyone. Whenever you realize someone is making eye contact with you, you immediately assume they just heard you fuck up or say something dumb. 


Let's say you have to call someone. You will rehearse what you say several times beforehand, possibly write down a ""script"", and pace around the room while you talk. Anytime you misspeak, stutter, or otherwise make am error, you spend so much time thinking to yourself about your mistake that you might not even catch what the other person is saying. 
If the call goes to voicemail, you sigh in relief, then read your written script out loud, and feel stupid for misspeaking and having to repeat a word.

Whenever you see someone you know in public, you hope to god they don't notice you, and you think they are watching your every action. When you are checking out at a grocery store, you think the cashier is judging you for getting so many cans of beans. When a teacher calls on you, you are unable to think about what the answer is or respond, even if you know the answer.

1292,"True.  I tried them all on again and only one or two of them even look particularly big on me.  I think I'm just gonna keep them and hope they shrink over time.  If they were any bigger I would totally return them, but they're just big enough that I don't think I'll bother.
