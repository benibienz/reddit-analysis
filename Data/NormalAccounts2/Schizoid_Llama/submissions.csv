At this point though, I simply don't know enough to identify with it or any other specific socialist belief. In other words, I am new but open to any ideas on the topic. 

That being said, I have a few concerns about anarcho-communism/ anarchism in general. The biggest of which is what would be done about relatively large scale, organized group violence/crime in general. 

I understand and agree with the idea that people are generally ""good"" and that most crime/anti-social behavior stems from poverty, lack of education, and oppression in general which anarchy is opposed to- and would ideally address by giving everybody access to education, healthcare, including mental health, and other basic needs. I also understand that, in an ideal anarchist society, a single individual who advocates for violence towards innocent people has no real power. However, what would happen if, for example, that person teamed up with other people with similar viewpoints? 

Let's say Bob lives in an AnCom society, and feels that it's unfair that Jon works less than Bob does and takes just as much. Let's say Bob finds 20 other people with similar viewpoints, and they team up and attack Jon and his family. If there isn't a state to oppose this, what would be done about it?

Once again, I realize that situations like this would generally be prevented by having a society based on equality, and I don't think Bob would have a good reason for feeling this way. However, this still could potentially happen, and if so, how would it be addressed? Couldn't one argue that a democratically controlled state would be beneficial in diffusing this kind of situation?

This may be a dumb question but I honestly want to have a discussion on this and better understand your views. I am not in any way trying to debunk anarchy or anything.

I have looked into Chomsky a little and find his ideas interesting. What are books of his/similar people that a layman would understand? If there are any videos, articles, documentaries, etc. explaining similar ideas I'd be willing to check them out.



Additionally, I have a friend who explained to me that he is a socialist/anarchist, as opposed to more of a marxist/socialist who would believe that there would be a ""state"" enforcing the ideas of socialism. If this is the case, what makes him an anarchist and how would that work out? What exactly does this ""state"" thing mean? Are there any resources I should check out that expand on this?

This is my badly whistling it in a loud public place. There's a catchy melody, then it gets slightly higher and higher in pitch. Sounds like a trumpet. Someone help me out.

Edit: my guess is it's from some action movie, like Kill Bill, James Bond, Mission Impossible, etc. It sounds super familiar but I can't think of where the hell it's from.

Edit2: it's not the main 007 theme, nor is it Ironside by Quincy Jones, nor is it the Mission Impossible theme, but it sounds very similar to all of these with the trumpets and the action movie vibe.

It sounds kinda like the instrumental of Irresponsible Hate Anthem by Marilyn Manson (opening riff, also plays when he yells ""f*** it"") but played with like a jazz/swing band/orchestra/something. I was listening to this song when the song that is on the TOMT got stuck in my head.
