Zara for some unknown reason hates the Ottoman Empire. *Something* happened with her and the Ottoman Empire but we don't know what and we never learn. It's just, ""I hate them and I want to blow up their evil train since it poses a threat."" We could have had flashback scenes or something where we learn why she hates them so much; like a scene where her parents are killed or something. That would be cool.

198,"I don't like the luck factor, that's it. The random Battlepack feature is stupid. You can PTFO and make your shitty team emerge victorious but still get no battlepack, and a camping Scout gets one with a legendary skin. That's bullshit. The game should reward you for PTFO-ing and team play, and that's why the people in the Highlights or with the highest scores should get Battlepacks.

Leveling up and getting battlepacks in my opinion is a good idea as well. As you level up you could get even more chances of lengendaries, which IMO is good incentive to keep playing.

Also, the amount of repeat skins makes me want to just blow my brains out. 4 times in a row I got a skin for a gun I don't even use, saved up scrap, got another battlepack, same thing. I don't know if it's possible but the game should detect which classes/guns you use the most and give you camos and stuff for those, it sucks if for example you play Assault with the Automatico and get a legendary skin for a sniper you will never use.

The rotations don't work with the current system. Since battlepacks all come down to luck and not skill, some people will get amazing skins while others are left in the dirt. That is fucking stupid.

For example, I was playing as ze Germans on St. Quentin's Scar fighting in the trenches, first sector. No one captures the two points as they are all busy camping or running into the open. The enemies then fortify even more and tanks just start swarming us. On the first sector we have to get the Behemoth which some idiot pilot drives off to the edge of the map and crashes it. Cycle repeats and we lose.

The point of variants is make players choose one strength but sacrifice something else. A ""Storm"" variant might have less recoil but it's hip fire is going down, too. 

Being able to just slap a grip, bayonet, and an extended mag onto a weapon just ruins this system. You get less recoil, can instantly kill elites, and get more ammo. Just doesn't make sense to me at all.

Honestly, considering battlepacks only have skins and sometimes XP boosts, you should get 3 when you level up and have a chance to earn some in a random drop. That makes the most sense to me and I really hope they change it to this. 

Sorry I went on a tangent. To answer your question, yeah, it's basically bad luck. You can scrap duplicate skins for scrap which if you save up can give you a battlepack.

394,"The East Coast Brotherhood is a lot more forgiving than the West Coast dicks, allow me to try to explain.

1: They tolerate non-feral ghouls, but they are wary because they can turn feral *anytime.* 

2: Snyths...whew. Okay. Let's just first off by saying with them, the Institute basically has a giant army of people that don't need to eat, drink, sleep, etc. That is incredibly dangerous. One of the few things I DO disagree with them about though is how they won't even tolerate ones like Nick.

4: I would argue they care about losses. They feel sad when their brothers or sisters fall, but they can't just dwell on that, this is war. This is how most armies work in real life.

5: About their stance on technology: It's FAR better than the West Coast's more...brutal stance. They DO trade tech, and while they do hoard some, they do use it to help the Wasteland; Establishing order, killing mutants, destroying the Institute, etc.

6: The Brotherhood didn't exactly start a war. I know, I know, hear me out, but it's not like once they started going for the Institute a bunch of synths started attacking every big settlement in the Commonwealth and launching attacks on the Brotherhood....that would be war. No. As the SS gets nukes for Liberty Prime, builds a teleporter to get inside, they don't really do much. No massive attacks. They seem to wait for Liberty Prime, and even then, they don't bother anyone else, just the Brotherhood. 

My opinions are probably controversial and I would like to hear your rebuttals.

Weak perks? Disagree completely. A perk that makes people explode into a shower of caps? Turns good weapons into beast weapons of mass destruction? Those are some I can think off the top of my head, but the point stands, a good amount of perks are pretty damn good.

Uninteresting locations? Again, have to disagree. There was a lot of interesting, silly, or disturbing locations in Fallout 4; Glowing Sea, Pickman's Gallery, Shovel Museum in Nuka-World, etc.

Jetson's art style? This comes down to personal preference I think. I believe that downtown Boston looks really good. It's a great mix of historical sites and towering 2077 skyscrapers. It was a huge technological hub before the war and downtown reflects this.

Todd said the dialogue system was a mistake, too.

Also, your character, the newest recruit, is not an average new recruit. You take down an entire fort of super mutants, find out to enter the Institute, and brave the Glowing Sea. Reliable indeed. And Old Fart is optional. :D

My character sides with the Brotherhood of Steel as it agrees the Institute is a threat, and synths can be too. But he makes several exceptions; He talks to his synth son and keeps him alive because, well, his actual son turned out to be a douche, and synth Shaun is normal and reminds him of happy times. Nick is okay because he's a prototype with a friendly personality. And, in Fah Habah, I replaced the leader of the Children of Atom with a synth for peace.

Anyways, Ad Victoriam.

3: What do you mean ""gamey"" things? Like badass moments? I am confused here.

4: I feel Jet was a pre-war drug to boost performance made with cow shit, then after the war Myron made it with brahmin shit. This is what we are left to assume, and it makes sense actually, considered Myron is a dumb ass pervy kid. It's just that Bethesda should've made this more clear.

5: Too much in too small a place? Elaborate, please.

750,"Here are a few helpful tips, Dweller.

1: They're are multiple types of workshops for different purposes. With them you can improve your armor, cook food, tweak your power armor, improve your weapons, make chems, etc. 

2: Look everywhere for materials. Don't just go into a building and get some stimpaks and a weapon and leave. Look in every drawer, container, etc for ammo, weapons, chems, stimpaks, etc.

3: Also, if you're confused about your objectives, look in your Pip-Boy. At this stage in the game you're supposed to head over to Concord to explore.

4: Taking means you take something out of a container and put into your inventory. Transfer is when you get something from your inventory and shove it into the container.

1, I think the Lone Wanderer making Quantum is just for game purposes. It has Strontium 90, a radioactive isotope, in it, and that's probably really hard to get, along with all the other stuff you need for Quantum...and don't forget the fruit! 

2, Boston had a marketing run by Nuka-Cola going on, which is why Boston has rocket shaped bottles and the others don't. Trading isn't possible. D.C. has Coca Cola bottles and Boston has rocket shaped bottles and a completely different logo.

3, I don't even *think* Quantum should be in Boston. I see it as a mere oversight. A Fallout game needs Quantum!

First, didn't mean to come off as a salty one. Started classes and they could've been better, so yeah.

Anyways, I felt that Westie was trying to explaining game mechanics, but you were interjecting with jokes and things. I just wanted to hear what he had to say, so maybe what I've should said is that the jokes weren't timed well (The sandstorm one was pretty spot on though.) Maybe next time let the explaining get done and then get in with a bit of commentary and jokes.

That's actually how I should've worded it. I've always had a problem with wording things and not coming off as a salty person. Apologies for being rude! :)

You would have to deliver some kind of toxin into the bloodstream, and that would require making a pill and working with the FDA, blah blah blah blah.

Holtzmann is your quirky engineer (Egon.)

Abby is a weirdo nerd, like Ray.

Erin is like Venkmen, worked at a university, leader, etc.

Patty is just someone who is useless and I bet is just there to make a bunch of ""black jokes"" (I don't know if that was a race thing or a lady thing...)

Super dumb they couldn't come up with new characters aspects and personalities for the new team. Also everyone just called each other funny and the best person they met, lol.

The people performing the beheading and raging war and killing innocent Americans are Radical Muslims.

Like many other great immigrants, many Muslims come to our country for a new beginning, new hope, and are willing to work hard. They DO NOT want death to America. I personally knew a Muslim who was angry at ISIS for putting Muslims in a bad light. She loved America.

And Muslims are not silent because they support ISIS. Hell, the aren't silent. Go to the right place and you will most of them pissed off about ISIS. 

Laila is not a Muslim. She is a Radical Muslim, who twists her religion to justify killing thousands of people. She may not commit atrocities, but she shares their opinion. She is a Radical.

There are billions of Muslims in the world, for they are one of the Abrahamic religions, up there with Christianity and Judaism. Only a few thousand are Radicals.

1st, they didn't even celebrate for an entire day. It was really just 30ish minutes.

3rd, it's not as dramatic as a battle was happening on Christmas and they stopped and started playing football and drinking and eating. Not at ALL.

1: It was not a universal occurrence on the front. It was spontaneous, there was no pre-planning. Some were eager for a bit of rest while others were not. The Belgians and Germans were not up to fraternizing with the enemy. 

2: It came about informally. For example, someone met a German patrol, traded a few gifts, and agreed to a ceasefire in the morning. 

3: There was not always a bit of singing and gift exchanging. Some just buried the dead.

4: Football games are a famed occurrence, though they didn't really happen formally. It was just kicking something around.

5: It did not last the entire day. It lasted mostly about 30ish minutes.

6: As it was not universal there was still fighting and death.

2987,"Redwood wand, unicorn hair core, 12 1/4 inches long and supple flexibility. 

Wand-quality redwood is in short supply, yet constant demand, due to its reputation for bringing good fortune to its owner. As is usually the case with wandlore, the general populace have the truth back to front: redwood wands are not themselves lucky, but are strongly attracted to witches and wizards who already possess the admirable ability to fall on their feet, to make the right choice, to snatch advantage from catastrophe. The combination of such a witch or wizard with a redwood wand is always intriguing, and I generally expect to hear of exciting exploits when I send this special pairing out from my workshop.


Unicorn hair generally produces the most consistent magic, and is least subject to fluctuations and blockages. Wands with unicorn cores are generally the most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts. They are the most faithful of all wands, and usually remain strongly attached to their first owner, irrespective of whether he or she was an accomplished witch or wizard. Minor disadvantages of unicorn hair are that they do not make the most powerful wands (although the wand wood may compensate) and that they are prone to melancholy if seriously mishandled, meaning that the hair may 'die' and need replacing.

3090,"The Ministry of Magic is not only Britain's magical government, it also connects the muggle British government to the wizarding world. So indeed the top people in the British government probably know about the wizarding world.

As for regular old muggles, when they see wizards/witches, they just think they are a bunch of weirdos, even if they know who they are (some people do.) Most don't really fully understand the concepts in the wizarding world at all, except for the few who have a magical kid or magical husband/wife or something.

The same applies to wizarding folk. They don't really understand muggles much at all. For example, in the Chamber of Secrets, Ron screams into the Dursley's phone because he doesn't understand how it works at all. And in the Prisoner of Azkaban, they think a gun is some form of a metal wand. 

Now, like I said, some muggles have kids who are magical (Hermione's parents are muggles), and other muggles might just have someone in their family who was magical, or even might have a husband/wife who is magical! Now some muggles think this is a disgrace of some kind, thinking them to be a bunch of crazy lunatics. Others understand, and put their differences aside. It all depends.

When you feed him some mealworms, sprinkle calcium/vitamins onto them. Also get a dish and put a bit of calcium/vitamins in there too for him to absorb/eat at his leisure.



Second, I would get some moss and put inside his house. Frequently wet this moss, especially when he sheds. You also need a new little house on the cool side of the tank, in case he becomes too hot.

As for the lamps: keep them. Though the heat pad will warm their stomach, that is all it will do. It will not warm up the air. The lamp will, which is good. You don't want the ground to be warm and the air cold or room temperature. As for night, get a red lamp. Keeps the air at a good temperature and allows you to view him.

I would also change that thermometer. Get a digital one with a probe to monitor the air temperature that the lamps produce.

The galaxy is divided after the tyrannical Lord EA wiped out the mysterious race known as PC. The galaxy is divided after the use of a new super weapon, the DLC.

Players spring to their terminals to fight the tyrannical Lord EA, but to no avail. Many are slain, others are missing.

It is all up to a select few to let EA know that they fucked up...

3443,"Let's see here...tips.

For weapons, the E-11 is really good at close range, medium range, and even long range if you use it right, and it's damage is pretty damn good. If you're into close range, use the SE-14C. Medium and close-ish, use the DH-17. Sniping is the T-21B's specialty. 

As for tips...hmm. Well, you know that little arrow on your screen? Keep that in the middle, always. That's where your blaster bolt goes and if you keep it in the middle, you'll be ready for anything.

Star Cards? Use a Jump Pack. That's a must. You can bail out of fights and most of all traverse around the map quicker. Also, do not doubt the power of the Thermal Detonator. If you use that right, it can wreck people.

As for best game modes, it's your preference. If you just want to kill some people and don't wanna play objectives, go with Blast. Cargo is like Capture the Flag. Drop Zone is also pretty fun. Obviously Walker Assault is fun because of all the carnage and the AT-AT's and AT-ST's and what not. Fighter Squadron is also...interesting.

The BoS is badass with the Prydwen and all their power armor and shiz. They hate the Institute and want to destroy it, the synths, and anyone who works with them because they hate what the Institute is doing. However, they too have their...moments. They can have evil tactics, and because it's essentially a military, troops within its ranks can be bias or just plain bias twats. For example, the BoS only plans on eradicating FERAL ghouls, not sane ones, yet troops still kill sane ghouls because, well...bias.

I can see it now:

Vault 115. One of the 17 control vaults. Your family is in a small apartment, already signed up for the vaults. Your a recently married couple, and you, the Dad (Or Wife) are a person who is a ""prepper."" Every Wednesday, you join your friends for a few beers to discuss happenings and speculation, etc. Your significant other makes fun of you for it. It's a Wednesday, you're about to go out to exercise, when suddenly sirens start blaring. You grab your wife, leap into the car, and start speeding towards Vault 115. Of course, it's a little adventure going there. Other cars are speeding as well, people are running around, it's chaos. You finally reach the vault, the door wide open. You line, and after a minute or two, you're in, behind the door. Suddenly, a huge explosion is heard, and you look back to see a mushroom cloud forming over Presidio. The shock wave is coming towards you, and fast. The vault door closing process immediately begins, and people start charging towards the door. A few get in, but eventually the security has to start opening fire. The door just barely closes as the shock wave strikes. You hear banging against the metal vault door and screams, all quickly silenced. People reassure that you are find, etc. 20 years pass, and your whole vault opens it's door once again to the barren wastleland and skeletons. You can see the Golden Gate bridge, collapsed, and Alcatraz Island reduced to rubble. The game starts out with your fellow dwellers and the Overseer using a G.E.C.K. to start Dweller City. All goes well, until a unknown group attacks and decimates your city. Hundreds are slaughtered, including your family. The survivors need to rebuild, but sure the group will come back, you volunteer to hunt them down and end them.

Also, explain why Fredbear's Diner has a toy line, of the Gen.1's and the Gen.2's, and has a plushie being sold called SPRING BONNIE. SPRING? Those were only created for Fazbear Entertainment. When Phone Guy uses the word ""classic"" to describe them, he's essentially saying their old suits. The Spring Suits ARE specially designed for Fazbear Entertainment. 

Also, if FNAF 4 is the diner, you're whole ending makes no sense. How does Fazbear's Fright find nothing from a diner that existed at least a few months, had a toy line, and a sister location? 

The 1st FFP is Fredbear and Friends, that is where the witherds come from. The FNAF 4 and the FNAF 2 locations were Fazbear Entertainment owned, and had the Spring Suits...at least, in Summer 1987. By the way, FNAF 4 location has Spring Fredbear and Spring Bonnie, but that's not it. It has a REPAINTED TOY BONNIE ON STAGE WITH FREDBEAR. This is proven. Toy Bonnie? Toys were MADE for Fazbear Entertainment, that you cannot deny.

My personal opinion is that the diner had some form of the Gen.1 Characters, and Fazbear Ent. probably made new characters based off them or cleaned them up and change them up a little. FNAF 1 most likely takes place in 1993. Phone Guy states they have been singing those same songs for 20 years. 1993 minus 20 is 1973, a perfect time for the diner to take place.

Anyways. I think the diner was a small establishment and was popular, but never had the money to afford 5 animatronics. So they just made them all costumes that people wear.

That doesn't even make sense. You gave one piece of evidence, said it wasn't 87, and moved on. What we see in the game is the Bite of 87. First off, the little kid has TOYS of the TOY ANIMATRONICS. Notice something? The Toy Animatronics came around in 1987, not 1983. That's already a huge piece of evidence for it being in 1987. Go research that yourself, and find out that it is 1987.

Also, what we see in FNAF 4 is in no way related to the old diner. It is Fazbear Ent. property for sure. Since we play in 1987, the diner is already very old. It is more likely the FNAF 4 restaurant is the sister location to the FNAF 2 restaurant when it was open in Summer of 1987.

-Fredbear's Family Diner, late 60's (?): Fredbear (Brown), Puppet, and Golden Bonnie. A kid is murdered and possesses the Puppet, Fredbear is painted Golden, and then it closes.
-1st Freddy Fazbear's, 1974 (?): Originally features the 4 Gen. 1 Characters...Bonnie, Foxy, Freddy, and Chica. Then they built Golden Freddy and Spring Bonnie, both Spring Suits and replacements for the Diner's original characters. But then 2 employees are killed, and Spring Bonnie is sealed away while Golden Freddy is put in the Back Room, with the old animatronics and the Puppet.

1983: Fredbear and Friends TV show airs. 

1985-ish: Fredbear and Friends location opens, with the old Spring Suits, the Old Animatronics, and the Puppet stored away in the Back Room. The costumes from the original TV show are used as safe suits for employees to wear. Fredbear is cleaned up and so is Golden Bonnie, and they are there to entertain kids. 5 kids are murdered suddenly, and the Puppet puts their bodies into the Gen.1 Animatronics, with the 5th going into Golden Freddy. The place closes.

Early 1987: No-name FNAF 4 restaurant opens once again with Fredbear and Golden Bonnie. It's the same location from Fredbear and Friends, but probably renamed and changed up a bit. The old costumes are still there from the TV show to act as safe suits for employees to wear. The Bite happens here. It closes.

November, 1987: The FNAF 2 restaurant finally opens with the new Toy Animatronics on stage. They finally start using the Puppet again, and the Gen. 1 animatronics are put in the Parts and Service room. 5 more murders happen, but the bodies are not stuffed into the suits. Instead, the Puppet now tries to save them, and employs Freddy to go with him to stop Purple Man. Doesn't work, Purple Man shuts Freddy down, and Puppet runs away. It closes soon after. 

Early 90's: They reuse the 1st original building, the one from 1974, and make new animatronics, based off the Gen. 1 characters but a tad different (???). It closes due to budget soon after.",2015-08-27 17:57:16+00:00,cuhpapj,26.0,t1_cuhosbs,739.0,fivenightsatfreddys

Fredbear's Family Diner: Brown Fredbear, Puppet. Kid murdered, possesses Puppet. Fredbear is painted Golden to try to move on. Doesn't work. Closed down and purchased by Fazbear Ent.

Freddy Fazbear's Pizza V.1 is created, 1974 (Math), first with Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie, both Spring Suits. Has sister locations that also feature animatronics with Spring Suits. At one of them, two employees die while the suit is in suit mode, so they can't possess a limp animatronic...thus they become the Shadows. All Spring Suits are retired. Main location gets the Gen. 1 animatronics. 5 kids murdered, Puppet stuffs them into suits, weird smell from animatronics, etc. The place closes down.

1983: Fredbear and Friends TV show.

Mid 80's: Fredbear and Friends location, original Fredbear cleaned up and Golden Bonnie.

Early 1987: Fredbear and Friends suffers from the Bite of 87 and closes.

If there are animatronics on stage, nobody can wear a suit, because the animatronics on stage are the ones that can fit humans in them, but they are in animatronic mode. If they are in suit mode, and people are in them, there would be none on stage. Alright? 

Also, no where in the WORLD a company that 10+ kids die on their hands going to have the moolah to pay for and make new versions of animatronics. They probably just got the old ones, took out the bodies, cleaned them, changed the texture, and altered their exterior. That's much cheaper than making 4 new animatronics.

-Fredbear's Family Diner, late 60's (?): Fredbear (Brown), Puppet, and Golden Bonnie. A kid is murdered and possesses the Puppet, Fredbear is painted Golden, and then it closes.

-1st Freddy Fazbear's, 1974 (?): Originally features the 4 Gen. 1 Characters...Bonnie, Foxy, Freddy, and Chica. Then they built Golden Freddy and Spring Bonnie, both Spring Suits and replacements for the Diner's original characters. But then 2 employees are killed, and Spring Bonnie is sealed away while Golden Freddy is put in the Back Room, with the old animatronics and the Puppet (?). This is when they get the real Fredbear from the original diner, and mix him with the Gen. 1 Characters (?). At this point, it's 1983. It also spawns a TV Show. Then the murders happen, and 4 kids are stuffed into the Gen. 1 suits while the 5th kid is stuffed into Golden Freddy. Finally, this restaurant comes to a close.

November 1987: They open a small restaurant with just the original Fredbear and Spring Bonnie, trying to use him one last time. This is the restaurant we see in FNAF 4. The bite happens here. 

The FNAF 2 restaurant, probably already being constructed in November 1987, finally opens with the new Toy Animatronics on stage. They finally start using the Puppet again, and the Gen. 1 animatronics are put in the Parts and Service room. 

Early 90's: They reuse the 1st original building, the one from 1974, and reuse the Gen. 1 Characters. Shortly afterwards, it closes. Budget, probably.

So first Fazbear Ent. made a 1st Freddy Fazbear's with the original four Gen. 1 animatronics.

Then some Springlock incidents occurred, and Spring Bonnie was sealed off in the Safe Room and Golden Freddy went in the back room.

In the middle of this, there are sister locations with Spring Suits. Incidents happen and employees are killed, and they are left to rot. 

Freddy Fazbear's Pizza V.2. New animatronics replace the old ones. After only a few weeks of being opened, 5 kids are murdered again. Place is closed down.

Freddy Fazbear's Pizza V.3. This is the first restaurant reused, as it has a Safe Room for the Spring Suits. The old animatronics are reused. Closes down due to money issues.
