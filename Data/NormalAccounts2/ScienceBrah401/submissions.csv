No, I am not saying buff it so it literally becomes a walking tank, or buffing it's gun until it can 1 hit kill people. No no no.

Look at it this way; The sentry is vulnerable to gas, fire, bayonet charges, and Chicago west side style shanks. As compensation, shouldn't he have more health because he's wearing armor for Pete's sake?

When a tank shows up. Shit. We hold out on top a little bit but quickly get overrun and we are forced to retreat back to the basement. Enemies are now swarming in through 2 busted doors, and one door is protected by a landship that blasts whoever gets in his way. The only way we are even surviving is the medics. They revive us at good times and place down meds. And with the supports we never run out of ammo. The enemies kill one medic and I guess assume they killed our only medic and about 6 come down into the building. I mow down 2 but get killed, and all hope seems lost...until the fucking flametrooper runs out and toasts all those bitches. Medics spawn on him and get me back up, I blow up the tank, hoorah!

Anyways. Master is dead and big fat Master worm crawled down sewer. Now, everyone is theorizing who that worm infects; I personally think Eichorist, but some people think Zach just to dick with Eph. But here's the problem: In the book the whole reason the Master captured Zach and kept him alive was to wait till he was 13, and then infect him, because he considered 13 the ideal age. Zach is only 10ish in the show now.

Now, if Zach is infected, it means the show writers just said screw it for the sake of the show, which would suck. 

Besides this, would Zach, a 10 year old boy, really be a good Master? He's 10, small, not intimidating, you know, all that jazz. Eichorist is intimidating, and he's served the Master for a long time.

New York Before the War
------------------------------------------------------------------------

New York before the war was a prosperous, massive city with millions of residents. It was also the military heart of America in 2077; research centers, bases, bunkers, etc. It was one of the most fortified cities in America, up there with New Vegas; much was done to protect America's military heart from nuclear destruction. Protocol for New York's nuclear protection was clear cut; Downtown and a piece of the surrounding area was the ""Green Zone"", meaning no nuclear devices were to ever touch this area, for it housed what the government considered important buildings: military bunkers, labs, large corporations, etc. Anything outside of this Green Zone was considered expendable, and nuclear missiles were to be rerouted here. 

This is what was done on October 23rd, 2077. Lucky citizens mainly in the downtown area fled to the local 9 vaults, while other unlucky few either not in the Green Zone or who did not get ready in time perished in the nuclear flames. Speaking of vaults, Vault-Tec crafted 9 Vaults in the New York area, all on the highest level of sinister, for they fully took advantage of the vast population in New York. 

Factions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

While there would be smaller factions of equal importance, the two biggest are probably the Brotherhood of Steel and the Patriots. The Brotherhood came from Boston 10 years after the destruction of the Institute, and have come to New York to gather information and collect technology from all the military locations. The Patriots, however, are probably the most interesting faction. The 9th Vault-Tec Vault was Vault 89, for 1789, when George Washington was elected. Vault-Tec being a government company created this vault for high ranking military officials, and also created it for soldiers. The government wanted said soldiers to complete the mission of the Enclave on the East Coast; kill the abominations and leave real humans standing for what they hoped was to become the great country of America. So the officials and soldiers emerged from their Vault with a G.E.C.K. and formed the Patriots, while their base would be named Yorktown.

The Patriots strongly believe in wiping out all creatures they consider abominations; humans affected by radiation and super mutants, ghouls, etc. They also consider the Brotherhood of Steel a major threat, hording technology they deem theirs. The Brotherhood of Steel wants to help the people of the wastes rebuild, but considers ghouls and super mutants abominations, and takes technology for themselves. They consider the Patriots radicals that must be exterminated for the good of the New York wasteland. 

General Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Downtown New York is ruined but not a crater. Thanks to the nuclear protection system a good amount of skyscrapers are ruined but still standing. Anything out of the downtown area is basically fucking wrecked and irradiated as hell, because that's where all the bombs were rerouted. It's a much bigger Glowing Sea, basically, and 5 times more dangerous. But Downtown isn't completely safe either. Everyone who doesn't want to become a feral is clumped inside Downtown, and they are clumped with irradiated creatures, crazies, and raiders. The biggest settlement is probably Riker Island, but because they are all pretty much alone they're a bunch of entitled shitbags. 

The Red Zone
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ""Bigger Glowing Sea"" I described last section will now be called as the Red Zone. The Red Zone is where all the bombs were rerouted and features the remains of poor sods and their homes, a bunch of cities, and smaller or unlucky corporations. It is irradiated as all hell, more so than the Glowing Sea, and is incredibly dangerous.

Creatures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creatures in an irradiated New York include: Yao gaui, Radelk, Deathclaws, Rad-rats, Radbuck, and Radroaches, Radbits, and Radoyotes (I can have a little fun.) Radelk are Irradiated Moose and act much like Radstags in Fallout 4, Rad-rats are big fat city rats, Radbucks are irradiated skunks who shoot out a green gas that blinds and emits rads, radbits are irradiated rabbits, and radoyotes are irradiated coyotes who are do not like being screwed with. In the Red Zone, all these animals are even more hideously mutated and dangerous, and are basically on steroids. And yes, I admit I am fucking garbage at coming up with irradiated animal names.

ENTRY 1: AUGUST 4TH, 2104. TIME: 10:12 AM.

We need to get the fuck out of this vault. One of the gas mains just blew last week and the hydroponics lab got screwed up, and we already ate the food we could take from there. Besides a few remaining boxes of Sugar Bombs and Dandy Boy Apples, we're out of food. And the only people left with working Pip-Boys are Me and some Security, the rest have been either scrapped for parts or have just quit. And holy shit the riots. Some poor Mother blew her fucking brains out so there would more food for her kids, which speaking of which are now orphans. It took a full day for our janitor to scrape her bits of skull and brain off the peeling blue and yellow vault walls. We have had to lockdown the entire vault door chamber, because too many people have been trying to open the damn thing. Security itself is failing, most of them are abandoning their posts and joining the riots. One bastard nearly plugged his Pip-Boy ID Cord into the Vault Door Control Panel, but thankfully we managed to blow his fucking brains out before he managed to do anything. Oh, fucking hell. This is a pain in the ass.

ENTRY 2: AUGUST 4TH, 2104. TIME: 12:36 AM.

Can't sleep tonight. Too busy wondering what it was like for the Overseers before me. How easy it was for them. They didn't have to deal with suicides, or riots. Wonder how it was for the first Overseer...Vault must've been in the best condition it's ever been in when he first got his hands on it.

ENTRY 3: AUGUST 5TH, 2104. TIME: 2:23 PM.

Well, the Vault Council has spoken. We're getting the hell out of this shithole. It wasn't even a contest; sure, there were a few people who thought staying in a deteriorating vault was better than at least giving the Up Top a chance, but we managed to decide to leave Vault 45.

ENTRY 5: AUGUST 8TH, 2104. TIME: 7:52 PM.

Just finished packing what everyone thinks we need for the Up Top. Security has their armor and pistols, and we managed to supply a few residents with spare security armor. We got the G.E.C.K., our remaining food, sleeping bags, etc. Each resident was allowed 3 items from their quarters. We're as golden as possible.

ENTRY 6: AUGUST 9TH, 2104. TIME: 8:36 PM.

Today was a fucking shitstorm. Sure, we managed to ""settle"" down in this fucking....Wasteland. But not without losing half of our goddamn population and our shit. Turns out some people with guns were settled right outside our vault. We opened the door and within a minute half our population was riddled with bullet holes. They just surprised us, though, and they were a small group. Security found cover and blasted their heads clean off. Now, the 50 or so residents remaining are tasked with settling down and cleaning the cracked ground of the blood from the fight. Oh, and did I mention the fucking G.E.CK. was destroyed? THE FUCKING G.E.C.K. WAS DESTROYED. GODDAMN SECURITY CARRYING IT GOT FUCKING SPRAYED, AND IT WAS FUCKING BLASTED TO PIECES. That's it. We're fucking screwed. God help us all.

The vast empires of Britain, Germany, and France spread all the way down to India and Africa. Africans and Indians served for the empires, even in the trenches.

Battlefield 1's promotional picture shows a colonial soldier, particularly an African. Some criticize this as...damn, I don't know how in the hell to word. Being too politically correct? Shoving their ""agenda"" down our throats? Seriously how do I word this? 

DICE has stated multiple times that they wanted to show people that their preconceived ideas of World War 1 aren't always correct. They've done this showing us World War 1 wasn't just boring combat in trenches; we have awesome maps like Sinai Desert, Monte Grappa, Empire's Edge, etc. They are doing that too with race. They want to show people that not just whites served in the Empire's armies. That's all. 

And also, it's an alternative to camo. There isn't much choices for camo in a World War 1 game. The British just had some Khaki colored clothing, the French had blue uniforms, etc. Not much options.

I will not deny the fact that particularly Germany did not employ Africans a lot in trenches at all. They didn't, really. But I think they just want to show people that sometimes, Empire's chose other people than just whites to fight for them.

So my team was playing on Silk Road. We were in one of those odd scenarios where we locked down a few capture points, and the enemy did too, and then we all focused on one big capture point; in this case, it was the Army Base. The enemy team had some really good vehicle players, and we were getting overran in the Army Base by Tanks, LAVs, and Choppers, not to mention the swarms of enemies. It was not looking good.

My K.D., though it doesn't really matter, was absolute trash. Admittedly 4 to 14. We were getting crushed in the beginning, but somehow, someway we kept coming back on our dirtbikes and refilling the whole capture point. Eventually, everyone got the gist of it and chose Engineer. Before you knew it all you heard was explosions and soldiers yelling commands as we began to liberate our rightful point. Before long, the enemy team lost. Someway, somehow, we won, we pulled through.

And me? I got a trash KD but got high up on the board with an 8,000 something objective score helping my team and playing the objective.

This is Nuka-Cola's theme park, and when their new glowing drink is coming out, you're damn right they'd fill a river with it to market it!

But to me, it's more weird how's there so much Quantum in the Commonwealth. According to current lore, it was released in only limited batches in DC, and then released on the day the bombs dropped. Some people proposed the idea that traders brought more Quantum into the Commonwealth, but here's the problem with that: You know how in Fallout 4 Nuka Cola has rocket shaped bottles? It was a little thing the folks in Nuka Cola were doing; Rocket shaped bottles and those Nuka Cola blasters! Whee, marketing! Thing is, it seems it was limited to Boston (Though they probably had plans to expand.) So, if it's limited to Boston, traders couldn't bring in rocket shaped Quantum bottles. 

Now, it could be that they brought regular bottles of Quantum over from D.C. and people started filling their rocket bottles with that, but there's more problems. 1, the logo. 2, if they did this, we would SURELY see some regular Nuka Cola bottles.

So, yeah. From the research I've done it seems Bethesda screwed up the lore of Quantum. That's why the retcon is still possible; Bethesda could've realized they screwed up and are now trying to fix it.

Currently, it's bugged to hell and incredibly bamboozling. In the beta for the iPad version of the game, they showed the distance of Pokemon not in footprints but in meters (later changed it to footprints.) Though this is a bit specific and could make the game less ""mysterious"", it sure is better than the stupid glitched system that is the footprints. Now, they are probably going to stick with the footprints. It's more...engaging and mysterious. But what they could add is what direction it is in, and actually fix it so that it's not just 3 footprints all the time; 1 for close, 2 for sorta close, 3 for far away. 

* Add a VR system for Pokemon in our Pokedex. I want to put a Crabby in a pot.

* The servers need a massive upgrade. They underestimated just how massively popular it would be and now there are countless cases of the infamous Pokeball glitch and server crashes.

* They really need to work something out for rural players. It's tricky as hell to find Pokemon and even harder to find a gym or Pokestop. Hell, I live in a small town that's not even rural and it's still tricky finding Pokemon! /u/Kroeze suggested the idea of Safari Points for rural players. Basically, he suggested that rural players should get Safari Points at things like valleys, national parks, rivers, etc (something we citygoers don't really have.) This Safari Points would mainly give you Safari Balls instead of Pokeballs, and that with these Safari Balls you could catch Safari Pokemon. Neat!

* There needs to be a battery saving mode. Perhaps this would an 8 bit map, I don't know, but we need it.

* There needs to be more incentive to hold gyms. Sure you get some points but that's pretty much it! /u/BuckeyeKMH suggested that captured gyms should act as a lure to fellow teammates. 

* Medals are worthless. Many don't give a shit about them. That's because there is literally no reward and all they do is sit there on your page. Rewards should include could be points, Pokeballs, Lures, etc.

* TRADING AND BATTLING PLEASE.

* A friends system would be really neat. A lot of trainers are meeting new friends as they catch Pokemon, and it would awesome if you could add people as friends and work together to catch Pokemon.

* If you place a lure down at a park, you should get a little bit of points everytime someone uses it. Adds more incentive to place Lures down.

* Can we please interact with our Pokemon a little bit more? I don't know about you guys but I don't like just staring at my Pokemon and swiveling it around. It would be neat if we could feed it, maybe even pet it. 

* A lot of people want to change their trainer's color palette after they change their team. Let's say your color palette for your trainer is orange, but then you choose Team Mystic. You should have the option to change it to blue.

* Another idea suggested by /u/VID_ is that every time you complete a goal or level up and get a badge, you should be able to put it on your character.

But we are all worried about this game just being SMG dominant. Everyone is, because that's all anyone really did in the stream. But the reason they did that in the stream is because they are the easiest to use, and that's key with players used to Battlefield 4 and the celebrities. 

Not only do I trust in DICE, but I also feel like this game will not be SMG dominant. You will have people using SMG's for close quarters. People sniping those in the open. Medics using LMG's for medium range. And ~~trolls~~ players using shotguns, blasting faces in at extremely close range. People aren't just going to use SMG's; they are going to stick with other guns too, because not everyone wants to go close quarters. 

And SMG's aren't overpowered. They have a good bit of recoil, and they just don't work at medium range; medium range is for LMG's. LMG's don't work at long range, and so on.

I mean, KD isn't even my focus and it's worrying. I went from being pretty decent with the SAR-21 (getting like, 1.10 sometimes) to just sucking horribly with the SAR and any other gun I use (now it's like, .65.)

I've been playing for a good 2 weeks so my aim is decent, and I always strafe and what not. So what gun should I use? I like the AK-5C, but I still get dominated using it. M416 is meh to me, I just can't use it! AEK is cheap, AN-94 and AK-12 are meh...in other words, every single gun I use I can do okay at and sometimes get more attachments, but I still get  **dominated.** Like, horribly wrecked. 1 to 10, 2 to 20, etc. It's maddening, I keep feeling like I just suck at shooters and there is no hope.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I swerved my car into the parking lot of Fredbear's Family Diner, the tires making a small crunching noise as they rolled on the rough parking lot. I took out the keys, stuffed them into my pocket, and pushed open the bright red doors. Instantly, like any day, my ears were filled with the laughter and playful yelps of children. A young brown haired boy, probably playing tag, bumped into me with quite some force. Another kid jumped over his partition, to join in some fun. Others gazed up at wonder at our animatronic, Fredbear, truly a marvel of technology; fluent movements, a clear voice, and was programmed to respond to basic questions (though glitches happened quite frequently.) ""Hey, Ron, get over here!"" my boss yelled from the security office. I did a quick jog over to the security office and saw Ben, our red haired manager, in a seat. ""Ron, I got bad news"" he said, as I grabbed a cup of coffee. ""What is it?"" I asked. ""You know that *other* company, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza?"" he asked with some hesitance. ""Of course, the assholes who made a cheap knockoff of Fredbear called Golden Freddy or whatever."" I replied briskly. He chuckled. ""Yeah...they're buying us out."" he said with a hint of sadness in his voice. 

""How the hell did that happen?"" I replied in frustration, immediately sitting up in seat. ""Well shit, I don't know, they bought us out. That's all that matters. Next Monday we're going to start clearing the place out. Fredbear's being handed over to them, this place is turning into a sports bar or something I think"" he said. I rubbed my chin, feeling the pricks of hair on my face. This diner paid me well, I knew these guys, they helped me after Dana left me. They put a smile on my face when I was sad...and now it's all going away. ""Christ..."" I muttered. ""Oh, and one more thing..they need you, our technician, for Fredbear"" he said, again with some reluctance. ""Why the hell do they need me?"" I yelled. ""Well, uhm...their animatronics run on different systems and come from a different company. Fredbear runs on a different system AND comes from a different company, one their technicians don't know too well. You, however, do"" he explained. This did make sense, so I grunted in agreement and yet frustration at the same time. ""I need to go sit outside."" I said. He nodded his head, and I walked out the small, cramped office.

As I bit into a piping hot, greasy slice of sausage pizza, I looked at Fredbear. His lush golden fur, his tidy and dapper looking purple bowtie and hat. His big brown eyes were lit up from behind, and he was showing all of his teeth in a wide, inviting smile. Kids waved to him, said hi to him, and sang with him. This is how I felt when I saw this diner, when Dana left me. I remember the intense sorrow and guilt I felt when I waved goodbye to her from my apartment's door. I remember seeing a technician needed for a new restaurant, and applying. And then finally the happiness this place brought me; a steady pay and good friends. I swear to god, if these Fazbear Fuckers treated Fredbear, the source of my steady pay and happiness, like dogshit...well. I would get my revenge. And with this thought, I twitched. And I grinned. And I finished off my pizza.

My first day on the job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Fredbear was on stage with these worn down animatronics called...what. Freddy..Chica...Bonnie...and Foxy. Yeah, that's right. They truly looked like shit; they twitched in the middle of the show, got off beat in a song, their fur was ruffled and smelled like dried vomit, and their faces just didn't have the charm of Fredbear's. Kids were paying no attention to Fredbear, who was lodged haphazardly behind the rest of the...band. I sighed, and got back to work in the Parts and Service Room.

My hypothesis was correct: they are treating Fredbear like shit. MY Fredbear. The bringer of happiness and money to a broken man like me. The lights behind his eyes are gone, and now his gleaming brown eyes are now nothing but brown dots on a white surface. He got a complete repaint, and has the same creepy smile now as those other ""animatronics."" The diner is going to get Fredbear back, I will save them, and Freddy Fazbear's will rot.

You know all those kids who go to Freddy Fazbear's just to see those shitty animatronics? Those annoying as hell kids, nothing like the the respectful not annoying Fredbear's Diner kids? I'm going to kill one of those shitbags. And to hide myself? I'm going to be wearing a suit of my favorite animatronic, Fredbear. I'm going to lure the kid into the backroom, stab him to death, leave his body there, and just get the hell out. Then, as I'm eating my favorite cereal, watch on the news about a mysterious murder at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Tomorrow's the day. Tick tock goes the fucking clock.

His name is Roger. Dressed in the heavy-as-hell Fredbear costume, I take him to the backroom to help us with programming a brand new animatronic. My heart is pounding right now, and I feel the blood pulsing through every inch of my body. Holding the hand of a young moppy-haired boy, whom I will within a minute kill. I take a deep breath, and close the door of the backroom behind me. Within a second, he is pinned up against the wall, my arm against his throat. I hear his cries of pain, distorted from the pressure on his throat. I take out my polished knife, glistening under the harsh light. And I jam into his chest, right into his heart. His dark, brown eyes stare into my eyes. They scream pain, agony, fear...and anger. As blood pools out of his mouth and his body twitches, I feel a the burn of guilt. I'm a fucking madman. But as his body falls to the floor, a sharp crack, I push that thought out of my head. I quickly take off the suit, keep the knife lodged into his heart, and bolt out the door.

1: I keep seeing all these posts asking for the Christmas Truce in the game, thinking it's going to be those dramatic but inaccurate commercials with football playing and singing and what not.

The Christmas Truce was barely like any of this; it was completely unplanned, and it just started because of random encounters most of the time. Not like they were fighting and decided to be friends all the sudden. Also, it varied where you were. Some didn't even participate (Belgians and Germans), others had extremely brief times of minor celebrating, and others just buried their dead. 

2: There was not constant combat.

Seriously, people seem to think World War 1 was constant muddy, brutal savage fighting. It really wasn't. Most of World War 1 was sitting in a disease infested, rat infested, muddy wet trench cleaning guns and replacing things, while avoiding the occasional sniper fire and the like. Combat was brutal most of the time when it happened, especially with Mustard Gas and the like.

The landing ship jolted as it landed. Right away, we heard the distinctive thump of the AT-AT's large feet on the desert sand, and then the distinctive sound of it's cannons beginning to fire at us. Holes were punched into the side of the ship, and one unfortunate guy was shot and fell dead to the floor. ""Go, dammit, go!"" the commander said as the doors dropped. With slight hesitation, everyone bolted outside to get to the nearest rock for cover. I ran to a large rock, and crouched behind it, my blaster in hand. ""Push forward, aim for the weapon facili-"" Right as he finished his sentence, he crumpled to the floor: he was shot by a stormtrooper. But we all knew what he was talking about, we had been briefed: we had to get to and destroy the Imperial Weapons facility.

Immediately after the commander was shot, everyone peeked out of their cover to get a good scope of what we were up against. To our left and right were two AT-AT's, and 4 AT-ST's escorting them. Hundreds, god maybe thousands, of stormtroopers are littered around the battlefield, which was the icing on the cake. ""Great..."" somebody mumbled. I peeked out over my rock, aimed down my scope, and shot a stormtrooper right in the middle of his chest, which caused him to fall flat on his back. This caused a chain reaction of sorts, everybody sorta snapped out of whatever they were in and all started to fire at stormtroopers, who of course fired back. Multiple bodies all around me fell to the floor, as bolts whizzed past me. I peeked out over the rock again, and realized that the stormtroopers were flanking us: barely any of them were left in the middle portion of the battlefield. I whispered to the troop next to him: ""Right side, flank, get a group of about 15."" He nodded and started to gather some people. I told the same to thing to another troop. We now had 2 groups of 15 flanking. Some good people were going to die, we were going head on into the AT-AT's, and into waves of stormtroopers, but it was worth the price: I'm sick of fighting. I sprinted with the group, and we finally met a group of about 10 stormtroopers. I pulled up my blaster and shot two of them square in the chest, and the rest of the group quickly finished them all off. We were about to proceed, until we saw the lumbering hulk of an AT-AT right above us.

The deafening sound of explosions filled both of my ears, as did the screams they were mixed in with. I skidded down near a rock to hide and checked on the group: there was about 8 of us left, turns out most of the group hadn't gotten to cover in time. But there were much more pressing matters: there was about 8 soldiers behind rocks, and a massive AT-AT with cannons pointed right at us. We heard it's body creak and groan with each step, and of course, the sound of it's blasters shooting at the rocks we were hiding under. Speaking of the rocks, they were crumbling above us, and if we didn't get out of here, we were going to be dead. I gestured with hang signals to the rest of the group for them to all retreat a bit farther back, so we can call in air support safely. They all nodded in agreement. 3...2...BOOM! The rock I was hiding under disintegrated into large and tiny chunks...and one of those large chunks landed right on me. I screamed in pain, and I felt the burning of tears I was holding back. I looked back to see how my group was doing, and turns out they were all dead. Their bodies had crisp, orange holes burnt into them, and their bodies lay on the floor. ""Dammit, dammit, dammit..."" I muttered in pain. I lay my head down, and prepared for the searing pain of a blaster bolt to tear through my skull, and for eternal darkness.

What we know about Quantum is that it was released in limited batches ONLY in Washington D.C. It was popular, so it was fully released to the public on October 23rd, 2077 - A.K.A. When the nukes fell. So nobody got their hands on any Quantum, remember the bombs fell early in the morning. So how is that we find TONS of bottles of Nuka Cola Quantum in Boston? There's more than classic Nuka Cola! Almost more than Cherry Nuka Cola! How is this possible? It wasn't even released in Boston before the Great War, and no one could get their hands on it when the bombs fell.

One theory that was presented to me is that robots in a nearby plant continued to deliver their orders of Nuka Cola Quantum. What about Classic Nuka Cola? Surely there would be a ton of orders for it. Also remember Nuka Cola plants don't have thousands of robot minions. Remember Milo, from Fallout 3? He's the only one there! And robots can last nuclear war, remember that. And they also wouldn't desert their home, their programmed to stay there.

I glance down at my Vault Tec watch....8:47. Crap, I'm going to be late! I whip open my fridge and grab an ice cold Nuka Cola and crack it open. The sweet, thirst quenching taste enters my throat. Ahhhh....just what the doctor ordered. I open my door and run for my car. In just a few minutes, I'm driving down Oakland Road, to the meeting point. I decide to turn up the radio, when I hear a Vault Tec advertisement: ""Are YOU prepared for the future? Sign up into your local vault, and ensure your future!"" I grin...already have, suckas! Vault 51. I swerve my car into the parking lot of our local pizza parlor, Johnny's Pipin' Hot, and proceed to enter the big red doors. ""Atom Bomb Baby"" is blaring on a jukebox, and some drunkards are stumbling out of the bathroom...idiots. ""Hey, John, over here!"" Daniel yells. I smile and walk towards his table. Kyle and Tom are over there as well. ""Hey, fellas!"" I say as I sit down. ""Wassup, John?"" Kyle asks. ""Not much, not much. Say, have you guys been hearing the news recently? ""Well, uh..."" Tom says. ""Kinda"" Daniel says. ""Kyle, Tom, and I have been real busy with work and crap. What's going on?"" he asks. ""Well, some shit's going down with China. Everyone and their mother is chit chatting about the recent aerial footage that was leaked."" I said. ""Hold up, aerial footage? Leaked?"" Tom asks. ""Yeah, it's crazy. Some Reds appear to be....preparing missile silos, to say the least."" I say. Daniel finishes off his beer. ""Really?"" he asks. ""Well, that's what it looks like. You can't mistake it, really. Some folks are saying it's just them doing it just in case or for some tests. But I think something else is...afoot."" I say. Kyle chuckles. ""Okay, Sherlock Holmes. What do you suspect?"" he asks. ""I think some serious shit is going to go down soon. You guys signed up for Vault 51?"" I ask. ""You don't think...."" Tom mutters. ""I do, in fact."" I say. Kyle laughs. ""Stupid, we're safe here in good old America."" he says with confidence.  ""Suit yourself, Kyle."" I say. He gives me an evil eye and looks away. ""I was denied access to the vault."" Daniel says. ""Damn dude, I'm really sorry. You got a basement?"" I ask. ""Well yeah, but will that hold up...?"" he asks nervously. ""I hate to say this, but I don't know. Just go down, lock the doors, stay away from the windows, and pray to God it holds. It should, it's underground."" I say. This seems to calm him. He smiles a little bit and says thanks. Tom tells me he didn't have time to sign up because of all his RobCo technical work stuff, and I simply tell him to sign up as soon as possible. I also mention that because Daniel was denied access, maybe Vault 51 is full, so try Vault 33. ""Alright, alright, enough of this nuclear war crap. Let's order some damn pizzas."" Kyle says. I agree.

Saturday, October 23rd, 2077.

Ahhh, sweet heavenly Saturday. Just glad I didn't have beers last night, would've been hungover as hell this morning. Kyle's going to have a rough morning, but I don't really care. His damn problem. I stretch and hop out of bed. TV, on! Sugar Bombs, check! Milk, check! Good morning: Guaranteed! I grab my bowl of delicious cereal and head for the couch. I decide to watch the news, because why n-oh look, sirens. Probably just another stupid drilllll...holy shit. Nuclear explosions in New York? Boston? Philadelphia? Oh my god...it's happening. It's actually freaking happening. I need to get to the damn vault! I throw my bowl on the ground and bolt into my room. I throw off my night clothing and hastily put on some normal clothing. ""Shit, crap, shit..."" I mutter. I grab my watch and wallet, and slam open the door. Chaos is a fantastic word to describe what is happening outside. Cars are swerving around, you can honks and screeching tires as people hurry for safety. People are running around everywhere screaming for help, others are talking to each other, panicked. I hop into my car and shut the door. I roll up the windows, and jam the key into the ignition. The car sputters to life, and a steady hum emits from the back. I pull back, turn right, and go straight down Main Street. Nothing but chaos here. It's a frenzy, and damn hard to get through all the crowds of people. I turn up my radio to hear the news. ""All residents of Seattle, heads towards your nearest Vault for safety! This is not a dri-right then it becomes garbled and staticy, and finally it just stops. Well, crap I think in my head. Finally I arrive at ""Vault Tec Lane."" With my wallet in my pocket and my watch on my wrist, I bolt down Vault Tec Lane. There I see it: The Vault Door wide open, and a not too long line for people entering. ""Mrs. Deborah....5 children, 1 adult female...go ahead."" the security guard says. ""Mr. Chadwick....go ahead."" he mutters. Finally, my turn. ""Mr. Sullivan....go ahead."" Wonderful! I head towards the entrance. The towering, circular vault door in all of it's glory, with the number ""51"" painted in the center. Right as I enter, I heard a distant, yet still ear shattering, boom. My head darts back, and I see a fiery mushroom cloud, full of rage. ""Close the Vault Door, close it now!"" a security guard bellows. ""All Vault residents enter immediately!"" a man in a yellow/blue jumpsuit screams. As I dart into the vault, the vault door begins to close. The guards look back and forth, and then enter the vault just in time. The closing of the vault door emits many interesting sounds: Screeches, grinding noises....any metallic sound will do. Finally, with a loud thud, it shuts. And just in time too. Last thing I saw was the shockwave racing towards us, and we were pretty close to that explosion. Suddenly, I hear some calls. ""Help us, please, we're a family, we signed up!"" a woman yells. As she finishes her sentence, the inevitable happens. I hear the panicked cries from her kids...her husband reassuring her...and then their screams, soon silenced by the shockwave. Soon, items begin to smash onto the door, and we even hear a few splats; probably the poor family. A man leads us further into the vault. We put on our Vault 51 jumpsuits and head for our living quarters. Cramped, but doable. At least we're safe. Before we can nap/settle down, a man who later introduces himself as the Overseer guides towards the auditorium. There, we listen to his big long speech about this vault, how he feels sorry for those who didn't make it, explains how things will work here, etc. We then head for our living quarters: I'm home.

With 8BitGaming's newest video presenting quite a bit of evidence for the dream theory, I feel it's time to make this post. We need to seriously consider it. Our thousands upon thousands upon THOUSANDS of theories have proved absolutely futile almost all the time. Scott said we would HATE the outcome of the story...and look at everyone! People bitterly despise of it, essentially dismiss it, etc. And it's not a cheap ending, for this game series at least. Everyone has been theorizing, making timelines, it would be a MASSIVE plot twist to say it was all a dream, FNAF #1-3. Keep your headcanon if you want, but we need to start seriously considering the dream theory. Think of the hint Four Games, One Story. What else could this mean? The obvious answer is it's one story, but that's too obvious, and isn't a hint at all. If the dream theory is correct, it makes sense. It's all about 1 crying child and his torment and anguish. All the other hints immediately click together when you consider the dream theory. So guys, we need to stop bickering, whining, and screaming insults about the dream theory. I don't care how much downvotes I get, but we need to consider it. We've done so much, and gotten so little.

I respectively disagree. It is 99.99% sure that FNAF 4 takes place in 1987. FNAF 2 also takes place in 1987. We know FNAF 4 is most likely mid-summer 1987, and FNAF 2 is November, 1987. In FNAF 2, phone guy says that the diner has been closed for years and he can hardly remember the name. It doesn't matter if the calls or pre-recorded or whatever, the diner has been closed for years by 1987. This automatically debunks the theory, unless you're an 83er, but that theory is already pretty much debunked. Also, so what if the whole restaurant is based around Fredbear? There is no way they would have multiple locations all centered around Freddy and his gang. That would be *super* boring and would get old quick.

Seriously. The shape of the bottle is horrifically inaccurate. They couldn't even get THAT right. Then the logo is all screwed up. The wavy lines bug me a lot, but that was probably legal (?)....but the text is riddled with flaws. It's a normal Pepsi logo, essentially, with the words Pepsi Perfect written on it. And they couldn't even get the TEXT right. It's tiny compared to how it should be, and the ""Perfect"" text is in the completely wrong location. And then we have the infamous blue cap. God, those buttheads even screwed THAT up. It's absolutely giant, and is a really light blue. Any built in straw? Not for us Americans! We just got a twist off cap...lazy Pepsi. And how about the chrome colored ring under the blue section? Nope, nope, and nope! So, yeah, right off the bat, the whole bottle is a inaccurate mess. It was Pepsi trying to strike it rich off an event. And that leads me to my next point.


IT WAS LIKE WORLD WAR 3 TO GET THEM. Holy crap, holy crap, holy crap. The bottles, first off, were $20.15...and they aren't even ACCURATE. It's like a Pepsi bottle tried to morph into a Pepsi Perfect bottle, but was mutilated in the process. God sake. Now, let's talk about the most annoying thing: How it was World War 3 to get these babies. I will divide it into the 2 short runs it had.

**1st Run, October 21st, 2015.**

This sucked. A lot. It was SUPPOSED to release on October 21st, when Marty and Doc went into the future, but due to some technical issue that was probably no accident, pretty much all of all of them were sold on October 20th on Amazon. Once October 21st rolled up, hardly any were left, and were quickly grabbed, mainly by scalpers. This lead to, essentially, an online mob attacking Pepsi's social media sites. Pissed off fans were, well, pissed. A lot. Pepsi knew they screwed up, so they announced a second run...hey, maybe they'll learn from their mistakes, take time to make a ton more to last at least 2 days, and THEN sell them online, right? Yeah, no. Just another 6,500 bottles. I mean, don't get me wrong, that's A LOT, but they were going to be gone in a few minutes. Pepsi knew that. And ignored it.

**2nd run, November 3rd.**

Fans were at their computers, ready to strike. They knew the time: 9 o'clock, EST. Pepsi had announced it. 8:59...9:00! Well, a lot more fans got their hands on inaccurate, expensive, deformed Pepsi bottles with the name Pepsi Perfect slapped onto it, but many also did not. Why? Because Pepsi's site was the ONLY PLACE YOU COULD GET IT. And guess what? The site crashed, technical problems plagued many, and thus, also, a lot of people couldn't get them.

The first, and the biggest, is that Give Cake IS NOT Fredbear's Family Diner. The Freddy in that room has the same color as Withered Freddy. Would Freddy really be in a restaurant with Fredbear? Fredbear and Freddy? You gotta be joking. Also, if you are screaming at me right now saying it's only one room, how the frick do you know that? It's only one room of a larger restaurant. God sake.

Second, we've never seen this restaurant before. We have no way of knowing that Fredbear had a partner in the diner. But thinking realistically, it's a 70's diner. Could it afford two animatronics? Maybe. I don't know. 


Third, there was no Spring Suits in Fredbear's Family Diner. I know, I know. A lot of people think there was. But it makes no sense. In the FNAF 3 phone calls, Phone Guy's recordings really point to the fact they were specially designed suits for Fazbear Entertainment, per the Night 2 phone call from FNAF 3: "" Right now, we have two specially designed suits...."" Specially designed? Hmm. Really seems to point to the fact that they really were specifically made for Fazbear Entertainment. Ah, I hear you cry, but on the Night 4 recording in FNAF 3, it says: ""...which is why the classic suits are being retired..."" Yes, a lot of people think that because Phone Guy says classic suits, it means they were from the diner. Yeah, uh, no. Sorry. This could be late into the Spring Suit era, and by using the word classic, he could just mean old in a way, the first of their kind. If you get what I mean.

September 12th, 1987.

Beep beep beep beep. I slammed my head on the top of my alarm clock to shut it off. I sat up in bed, and picked up my glasses from my bedside table. Crack, pop went my knuckles as I cracked them. I get outta bed, stretched, and got my Fredbear plush. His warmth comforted me. I walked out of my bedroom and into the kitchen. ""Mornin', squirt!"" my father said to me. ""Hi Daddy"" I replied back. He smiled. ""Scrambled eggs?"" he asked. I replied with a simple yes. I sat down at the kitchen table, thinking about today's new episode of Fredbear and Friends. I wonder if Freddy is okay. My dog's warm, fluffy body rubbed gently against my cold legs. I grinned and gave him a pat on the head. My Dad put my plate of scrambled eggs down in front of me, and I said thank you and began to devour them. ""Michael's birthday is tomorrow, at Fredbear's. He sent you an invite."" My dad said. ""Really?"" I asked. ""Yes. Wanna go?"" my Dad asked. I smiled, delighted. ""Yes!"" I said, joyfully. My Dad smiled back and said, ""Alright. You and me buddy, are going to have a great time."" my smile seemingly dissolved. Something happened to Mommy a few weeks ago. I don't know where she is. But Daddy says she's in a better place. ""Your TV show is at 9:00, buddy. Want me to turn on the TV?"" he asked. ""Yeah"" I replied. 

I sat down on my couch, which sagged once I sat on it. It was an old, yet relaxing, couch. My Dad turned on the TV. At that exact moment, the cheerful theme song came on, and I sang to the lyrics. My Dad grinned. ""Alright, sport, I'll be in my bedroom if you need me, alright?"" he said. ""Okay Daddy"" I said back. The theme song ended, and the blue screen appeared: ""**FREDBEAR AND FRIENDS, 1983**"" it always said. It then slowly faded away, and the show began. 

What an episode! Fredbear and Foxy saves Freddy, but Chica and Bonnie got lost in an Ice Cave. I hugged my Fredbear plush. ""I wish you and me could go on adventures...maybe to find Mommy."" I said to Fredbear. His eyes stared back at me. I walked back into my room and put him back where he was. ""See you tomorrow."" I said to him.

September 13th.

My Dad parked his car in the parking lot of Fredbear's Pizzeria. I leapt out of the car, and my Dad handed me Michael's present. ""Go put that where all the other presents are, okay Joshua?"" he asked. ""Okay"" I replied. Fredbear's hand pointed towards the big red doors. I ran towards them and opened them. The scent of fresh food entered my nostrils, as did the sounds of kids having fun. ""Welcome to Fredbear's!"" Spring Bonnie said. ""Hi Spring Bonnie!!"" I replied. ""Hey, buddy! What's your name?"" he asked. ""Joshua"" I said. ""Joshua? That's a great name!"" he said. ""Thanks Spring Bonnie!"" I said back. ""No problem! Hey, Joshua, can I see your invite? We have a birthday party going on here today."" I didn't have the invite. Thankfully, right at that moment, my Dad walked in. ""Hey Joshua, is that your Daddy?"" Spring Bonnie asked. ""Yeah!"" I said back. My Dad handed Spring Bonnie the invite, and Spring Bonnie said, ""Thank you sir! Have a great day guys!"" We both smiled, and Daddy said ""Thank you!"" I held his hand and put the present on the present table. I ran towards an open seat and sat down in it. ""Slow down, buddy!"" Daddy said. He sat down at the other seat. ""The regular?"" he asked. ""Yes please Dad"" I replied. ""Alright, go play with Michael, buddy."" my Dad said. I bolted off and ran towards Fredbear and Spring Bonnie. They were telling a story. I found Michael slowly eating a slice of pizza. ""Hi Michael!"" I said. ""Hey Joshua"" he said back. ""I-is everything okay?"" I asked. ""Yeah. I am going to play some arcade games."" he said back. I shrugged and walked back to my table, my shoes quietly click clacking on the checkered linoleum tile. My Pepperoni Pizza was there, 3 slices in fact. It was gooey and hot, but I bit into it anyway. My teeth felt like they were burned to a crisp, and I quickly spit it out. ""Hot?"" my dad asked. ""Yes!"" I blurted out. I downed some water. All the sudden, 4 masked boys were carrying Michael towards Fredbear. Michael was screaming and crying, squirming to get out of their grasp. My Dad stood up. ""Get your hands off that kid!"" he yelled. ""Shut it, old man!"" they replied. ""How dare you speak to me like that! Where are your parents?"" my dad scolded. All the sudden, a employee ran into the room. ""Stop it, now!"" he screamed, desperately. Before anybody could do anything, Michael was in the jaws of Fredbear.

He was thrashing and squirming about, trying to free himself. But there was no hope. His hands were clenched around Fredbear's snout, pounding upon it. He was screaming for help, and was crying. Tear fell to the floor, and puddles of tears quickly formed on the floor. The 4 boys grinned. Everyone else was paralyzed, hardly able to do anything: This had never happened before, and it was unthinkable. What was going to happen? That question was soon answered. After a few moments of shaking and  shuddering, Fredbear's jaw gave way. With a blood-curdling screech and then metallic slam, Fredbear's jaw was lodged into Michael's skull. 

Blood began to leak from Fredbear's jaw, dripping onto the floor in pools. His perfectly clean, unstained teeth, were now drenched in crimson red blood. The rims of his mouth were also stained with blood. Michael's body was limp, hanging there. His head was completely crushed: It looked flat, and was a mangled, gory mess. One of Fredbear's teeth penetrated his right eye, and blood burst from it's socket. The rest was unrecognizable: A mash of blood, guts, bone, muscle, skin, teeth...it was a mess. Fredbear's whole body was trembling now, uncontrollably. It looked like it was weeping heavily. Some blood even made it onto the side of Spring Bonnie, who was still singing. But the cheerful singing was overshadowed by the tragedy that had just taken place. The employee in the back stammered...""Holy shit."" he said, worried. He bolted towards the back of the restaurant. ""Call an ambulance! Now, dammit!"" he yelled. My Dad's face looked green, he looked like he was going to be sick. He turned his face away. I fell to my knees and cried, pounding my fists on the floor. In the background, I could hear sirens. Blue and red lights flashed onto the grey walls. I hurled onto the floor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I picked up Joshua's old, worn out plush and threw it into the trash can. What had happened 2 days ago was horrible, disgusting. The bullies were in custody apparently, according to the rumor. I hope to god they were. I shook my head and closed the trash can's lid, and then walked away. However, unknown to Joshua's father, deep within the musty trash can, Fredbear's pupils moved around within their black eye sockets. ",fivenightsatfreddys,87.

However, this probably doesn't change the timeline too much. Just means the 1st murder happened at the 1st FFP, Fredbear and Friends.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was a dark, stormy night. Rain poured from the dark, grey clouds above me. I parked my car into what was the parking lot of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, and turned off the engine. I sat there, thinking about my memories with this pizzeria. Their screams, agony, and torment. I grinned. I put on my jacket, and picked up my axe; I had come prepared. 

My car door opened with a slight click, and I stepped out into the downpour, as thunder boomed somewhere to my left. It was a chilly night, but thankfully my jacket enveloped me in warmth. The rain hit my jacket and made a soothing pitter-patter noise. I held the axe in my right hand, and walked towards what used to be the entrance. It was boarded up by wood. I swung my axe in the wood. Ch-thunk, Ker-rack! The window of the door soon became visible. I retreated my axe from the wood, and then smashed it into the glass. I reached in, and tried to feel for the handle. Sooner or later, I managed to find it, and I opened the door. I kicked the rest of the wood out of my way.

I walked in, and my boots click clacked against the old black and white checkered tile. The building smelled musty, and had the distinct smell of wet, aging wood. Trickles of rain entered the building through holes in the roof, wetting the tile floor. I had to be careful, or I could slip, and my mission would be over before I did anything. I tried to remember when I worked here, and where the Safe Room was. I imagined the floor plan of the building in my mind, and decided that it was somewhere near the bathrooms. My nostrils twitched at the stench of the building as I walked towards the bathroom. As I was walking to the bathrooms, I passed the 3 main animatronics, that looked ancient. Stains covered them, and a strong odor surrounded them. Their original, vibrant colors had faded away. Freddy was no longer a distinct brown, but more a moldy brown/golden. Thank the lord I was getting rid of them.

As I approached the bathrooms, I immediately saw the old safe room. I walked towards it, and broke the wood encasing its secrets. I stepped in, and right away saw 3 old, broken arcade machines. Their screens were cracked, and what was left of their screens emitted a dim blue light. To my right was Spring Bonnie, limp. It looked worse than the main animatronics: It's left ear was missing a huge piece, and holes covered its body. It's original color had also faded to orangeish/yellow. Sad to see it like that, I had such great times in that suit. I pulled out a protein bar from one my jacket's pockets, and ripped the wrapper off. I devoured it, and then threw the trash on the floor. 

I grasped my axe with both hands, and decided it was time to get going. Better get this done quick. Suddenly, I spotted Freddy limping right in front of the safe room. For a second, I pondered why, but shrugged it off and went into action. I bolted out of the Safe Room, and kicked him to the floor with all of my leg strength. He made a loud thump as he hit the ground, and his head swerved left and right. His rusty animatronic parts inside made a loud grinding sound, that reminded me of of when my teacher scratched her nails on the chalkboard. I winced, but kept going. I grabbed the axe, and jammed it into his chest area, and his head went still with a loud cracking noise. I pulled the axe out, and then smashed it into his chest yet again, sending animatronic pieces into the air. I shielded my eyes with my hand, and then kept going. Bolts of electricity shot out from the many animatronic pieces in his chest, stinging my eyes with their bright flashes. I pulled the axe out of his chest. His animatronic body lay there, still and ripped apart. Animatronic pieces were all over the floor, and pieces of his brown body were also scattered along with the animatronic parts. I chuckled. 1 down, 3 more to go. 

I glanced at my watch: 11:50. I smiled. The remnants of all 4 animatronics lay in front of the safe room. Their bodies were torn apart on the floor, and animatronic parts were scattered all over the place. The rain was stronger now, and more started to come through the roof. Most of the tile in the safe room was covered in water. I lay my axe down on the floor, and sat next to the Spring Bonnie suit. Breaking all 4 animatronics was hard work, especially in a jacket. I sighed, and lay my head back. 

I woke up. As I stood up, I saw a small, white humanoid figure ahead of me. I shooked my head, but it was still there. As I opened my eyes a little bit more, I realized it looked like a ...kid. I staggered forward in shock. I tried to back away, but it started to move...what was it? Why was it here? How was it here? Too many questions, but no time. My eyes fixed onto the Spring Bonnie suit. Maybe they wouldn't see me in there. I bolted towards it, nearly slipping on a puddle. It continued to follow me. I was trembling in fear, my palms sweaty and my hands shaking violently. I quickly clambered into the suit. My eyes peeked out of its sockets, and I could see it looked confused. It stepped back. I cackled in delight. Suddenly, a sharp, violent pain engulfed my body. It drained my body of any energy, and I fell to my knees. Loud cracking noises filled the room, and the pain grew sharper. I looked down to see glistening, dark red blood on the tile. More and more of it started pouring out of the suit and spurting all over the floor. I started screaming for mercy, help, anything. I saw the white ghosts slowly disappear. I fell back and hit the wall. More and more engulfed my body until...everything went black. ",fivenightsatfreddys,Demise.,https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/3ne375/demise/

It was popular, and plushies were made. In 1983, the 4 animatronics were put away, they just weren't popular. Kids liked Fredbear more. To go along with Fredbear, they made Golden Bonnie too, to go along with him. They also made 2 slightly modified spring suits suit versions of them, for employees to wear only...they could not go in animatronic mode. This when on to about Summer 1987. This is when FNAF 4 takes place. The FNAF 4 kid is a nervous, shy little boy, and is easily scared by stories, and also has a big imagination. He has been here for a while, and has probably went to Fredbear and Friends a few times himself in around  1983-ish. A kid shows off his Spring Bonnie toy. He also sees the old toys of the 4 original animatronics, and hears a little girl sharing a ghost story of sorts that they hide your body and never tell anyone. The shadows of Fredbear and Golden Bonnie also scare him, he sees monsters in the shadows. Because of all this, he merges this together into sorts, making up a whole story in his imaginative head. A haunted pizzeria with kids stuffed inside the animatronics trying to kill the Night Guard (FNAF 1), a new and improved pizzeria with the toy animatronics, but they malfunction and also try to kill the guard (FNAF 2), and the Spring Suits being malfunctioning suits that can crush people instantly, and a man being crushed inside one and being recovered...(FNAF 3.) He also has nightmares and dreams about Shadow Bonnie and Shadow Freddy, who come into his dreams/nightmares randomly. These are the monsters he sees in the shadows of the animatronics. All of this scares him to death, and kids keep on scaring him and making fun of him. This makes him even more shy, and leads to his endless crying. Sadly, he meets his demise in a horrible incident titled the Bite of 87. The bullies go too far, and he gets shoved into the jaws of Fredbear, his skull being crushed. For 6 nights he suffers from nightmares upon nightmares, these being even worse than his other ones before the Bite. His imagination doesn't help, and adds onto it. He eventually dies, leaving his family melancholy and sad, and his brother full of regret. This gets rid of Fredbear and Golden Bonnie, and the Spring Suits...they are tainted with death. They get the old 4 characters back on stage, but due to the incident, they cannot recover, and they close in the early 90's.

Anyways, many have been assuming that Fredbear's partner in FNAF 4 is Spring Bonnie. However, under close examination, you can see a little circular bushy tail on it's back. Spring Bonnie has no tail at all, and neither do any other Bonnies. What Bonnie does? Toy Bonnie. If FNAF 4 is truly the sister location to the FNAF 2 location when it was open in Summer 1987, as evidence suggests, this makes perfect sense. They wanted Fredbear to have a partner, but didn't want to spend a ton of money, so they just got a Toy Bonnie and repainted it a dark golden color and put it in the sister location with Fredbear. 

Here's a little guide I made to help you with pictures: http://imgur.com/VkJeDLZ.

TL;DR: The Bonnie we see on Stage is a repainted Toy Bonnie from the FNAF 2 location, as Fazbear Ent. didn't want to spend more money making a new animatronic.

I saw Michael get bullied again today. Some kid punched him in the stomach and laughed at him. I wish I could do something. Our school separates the Middle School Kids from the Elementary kids. And that means Middle School has a completely different playground, which is on a hill overlooking the Elementary Playground. All I can do is look down and see Michael getting laughed at, teased, and hurt. He cries a lot too. Most of the time he's alone, playing with his Freddy plushie. I heard his Dad died a few years ago, and that his Mom is pretty mean to him. He's a really nice kid, I got to talk to him once. I can't believe people treat him like crap. Bullies suck, we have a lot more up in Middle School.

 On a more happier note, I heard on the news that the Freddy Fazbear's down on Elk Street got a sister location closer to my school, which is on the edge of town. I think it's on Pine Street, but I might be wrong. It has some new animatronic called Fredbear I think, and it has another one...uhm...Golden Bonnie? Yeah, I think that's it. I heard that they also have suits that employees can go into, which is super rad. I wonder how they do it. Oh well, anyways. I hope I can visit it soon, it sounds awesome.

Michael got bullied again...god sake, do the staff not see any of this? So stupid. I couldn't help of course, because it would be straight to the Principal's office for me if I did. Great. Just great. Anyways, turns out Michael is having a Birthday Party at the new sister location. He managed to sneak in and invite me to the party. I of course accepted. I am really excited now. He seemed really happy, and that was so contagious, I started smiling. I asked my Mom and she accepted, and then praised me a bit and rewarded me with some surprise ice cream. Now that's pretty awesome. Anyways, turns out the Birthday is tomorrow at 2:20 in the afternoon. Looking forward to tomorrow! 

June 28th, 1986.
Today is the day! My Mom drove me to the pizzeria, and man, it looks really clean and smells new and fresh. No surprise, it opened only about 2 days ago. Kids were everywhere, running and screaming. It was really loud. The animatronics looked really clean, and they were moving fluently and swiftly. Michael was really happy, a guy in a Fredbear costume was talking to him. Michael hugged him too at the end of their conversation, happy as a clam. He ran up to me and was really excited that I came. He was not crying, he was not alone, he wasn't huddled up. So great to see. We played some arcade games together too, and we earned some tickets. He darted over to the prize corner, and asked for a Spring Bonnie plushie. The man handed it to him, and he squealed with delight. He was cheerful and happy, and free of the bullies. This was his safe haven. I looked at the Plushie, and then looked at a Golden Bonnie walking around the pizzeria...he looked exactly like the Plushie! I guess these costumes are called Spring Bonnie and Spring Fredbear. Cool! Finally our piping hot pizza arrived, and we wolfed it down. The pizza is always good and fresh, it tastes amazing.

 After eating our food me and Michael watched the animatronics sing for a little bit, then we played a ton of Arcade Games. I then glanced down at my watch: 4:20 already! Just at that moment, Fredbear on stage looked down and said, ""Hey hey, kiddos! We got a special birthday today! Michael is turning 9 years old today! Happy Birthday, Michael!"" Then the animatronics sang a birthday song, and when that ended an employee put the cake down on the table. Surprisingly well timed! Michael's smile was even bigger now, and he was so joyous. As his Mom slid the cake slices onto plates, Michael grabbed the first one and gave it to me. He then grabbed a second one for himself.  ""Who is your favorite, Fredbear or Golden Bonnie?!"" asked Michael eagerly. I chuckled, ""Fredbear. He's funny."" I replied. ""Yay, I like him too Chris!"" replied Michael. ""So do you like the cake?"" I asked. ""It's not as good as the pizza, but I still like it, it's yummy!""  replied Michael. ""I agree!"" I said. And we devoured our cake. When we finished our cake, it was about 5 o'clock. Michael's Mom said the party would end at around 7:00. Then Michael's Mom put 2 presents on the table. ""Open one up, sweet pea."" said his Mother. He opened the first one, which was red with silver stars over it. He unwrapped it swiftly, and opened it up: It was a model of a jet. Michael read the letter inside, and then said, ""Thank you Mommie, thank you, thank you so much!"" He kissed his Mom, and his Mom embraced him lovingly. They sat back down. The last one was mine. It was green with orange dots. He unwrapped it quickly. Inside was a drawing of Fredbear I had done for him on the day he invited me. I did my best to draw it right, but nonetheless, he absolutely loved it. He read a little note I put it there, and they gave me a tight hug. ""Thank you buddy, thank you thank you!"" he said happily. ""My pleasure, buddy."" I replied. 

After the unwrapping of the gifts, we decided to play some Arcade Games. While we were playing, I told him I had to go to the bathroom, which was to the right of the Show Stage. I walked in, and went to the bathroom. I washed my hands and walked out: He wasn't in the Arcade Area, and his Mom was busy reading magazines. Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of a man in a Spring Bonnie suit leading 4 kids into what looked like a backroom. That's wasn't good, because Michael was one of them. I rushed to his Mom and tried to tell her. She shrugged me off. God sake, who is this lady?? A man in a suit is leading 4 kids into a backroom, that seems suspicious as heck!  Suddenly, a scream pierced my eyes. Michael's Mom jumped up, and screamed, ""It's Michael, oh my god oh my god!"" I darted into the room, and saw a horrific site: A man was jabbing a knife violently into a kid's abdomen, blood spurting everywhere. The kid was shaking, and was screaming at the top of his lungs. He was begging for mercy, screaming for his Mommie, trying to pull the knife away. The man had a determined face, and he was grinning. Blood was smeared onto his face. The screams were eventually silenced, and the kid's body fell to the floor, with a loud crack. A pool of blood leaked out from the body. The man crackled, and in a deep voice said, ""Who's next?"" One kid darted for the door, screaming for help. The man said, ""Why would you look at this, it seems we have a volunteer..."" And at that exact moment he got the knife and ripped a jagged line into the back of the kid. Bone fragments and blood went everywhere, and his intestines uncoiled and spilled onto the floor. The kid fell back, his eyes staring at the ceiling, his face frozen in a state of agony. I peaked out the door, and saw Michael's mom calling the police at a pay phone. She was balling, and I could hear her mumbling in horror. It was at that moment I was shoved violently onto the floor by the man, who simply said, ""Nice try, little fellow. Try harder!"" He locked the door. 

The body of two dead kids were now on the floor, lifeless and free of pain. Blood was all over the dark, bland grey walls, and the floor was covered in bone fragments, pieces of organs, and dark, crimson colored blood. The man grinned with delight, and pulled out a cloth and cleaned the blood from his face. He laughed again. ""Let us go, please, we will give you everything, please I just want to be with my Mommie, please sir please!"" said a kid, weeping. ""Oh shut it, little kid. Shut up!"" He jammed the knife into the kid's eye, and and kept jamming it deeper and deeper into his eye socket. The kid was twitching and flailing, wincing, and screaming. He was trying to hit the man, but it was to no avail. He pulled out the knife. ""How do you like that, you vile kid?"" the man asked. The kid collapsed onto the floor. ""Oh, man up you little wimp, you don't want your Mommie do you? Awww...."" When he finished that sentence, he lodged the knife into the back of the kid's skull. Blood started pouring out, and the kid started screaming more and more for his Mom. He even started to beg for him to just die now. ""Oh, I can do that, you little..."" And at that moment, the man got the knife and peeled out of the kid's scalp while the kid screamed in agony.

 The man got the scalp and put it onto his head. ""Look at me, I'm a little brat, hahahahahaha, I go to this STUPID PIZZERIA, and get FATTER, and FATTER, and I CRY, and I WHINE, and I SCREAM."" The main said loudly. He was obviously pissed off. ""Ah, only two left? Time sure does fly..."" He said. After that, he stared at Michael. ""What's your name, Sonny?"" the man asked. Michael whimpered, and managed to utter, ""U-uh, M-M-Micha-"" At that moment the man screamed, ""LEARN TO SPEAK YOU ILLITERATE YOU SACK OF CRAP."" He swiftly moved the knife and jammed it into Michael's mouth. Michael's pupils widened, and he started screaming in pain. ""M-MOMMI-MOMMMIE HELP ME PLEASE MOMMIE HELP MOM PLEASE..."" he tried to bellow. As the knife went deeper into his throat, they eventually became inhuman, distant cries of help, and eventually they were silenced. Blood pooled in his mouth and started leaking from it onto his shirt. He fell back on the floor, and the man removed the knife. ""Why, only one left...so sad. I feel like we could've been good friends..."" he muttered. I realized these would be my final moments on Earth, and I started crying. I started thinking of how much it would sting and hurt, and how quick it would be. Suddenly, I heard police sirens in the background. ""Let's do this quick, buddy boy.""

 He jabbed the knife into stomach. I felt a sharp, cold blade enter my stomach, and that seemed to resonate throughout my body. I gasped in shock, and I looked down to see the knife in my stomach, blood leaking out onto the floor. He moved it higher, the pain increasing and becoming more sharp. More blood started leaking out, and pieces of bones and organs and muscle spilled out onto the floor. Suddenly, I heard a man say, ""Reveal yourself, now!"" He tore the knife out of my body. I could feel air going through the inside of my body, and I felt warm blood gurgling in my throat. I clenched my stomach to try to help the pain, and curled up in a corner. ""See you in hell, you little moronic kid."" He darted out the room, leaving me in. In my final moments, I saw the bodies of all the other kids. Most were mangled, torn apart, bloodied...lifeless. I crawled to Michael's body, and gave him one last hug. It was at that moment everything went black.

POLICE REPORT, JUNE 28TH, 1986:

5 bodies were found in a backroom at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeira. 5 bodies were all torn apart in various gruesome fashions, all done with what seems like a sharpened knife. Spilled organs were found on the floor, as was bone fragments and pieces of muscle. Blood was all over the floor. We have a suspect, but nothing else. Hope the Security Cameras got something. We did find a limp empty suit in the corner of the room too though. It seems the murderer wore this suit to earn the trust of the children?

 Anyways. Remember how the FNAF 2 endoskeleton turned into that angry looking endoskeleton, with it's ears perked up? Take a good look at that endoskeleton. It's eyes are a cyan color. Midget Fredbear has the exact same eye color as the angry looking endoskeleton. Now, I think that Midget Fredbear is modeled after the Fredbear we see in FNAF 4, but he's just smaller and scaled down. For example, since Midget Fredbear has Cyan colored eyes, then FNAF 4 Full Sized Fredbear probably did too. Now this angry endoskeleton is big, so it can't be Midget Fredbear's. Who else has Cyan Eyes, just like Midget Fredbear? None other than the full sized Fredbear, which we see in FNAF 4. Thus, that endoskeleton must be Fredbear's.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

June 12, 1987:
Well here I was, at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. In our old, boring town where nothing happened, this was our only good pizzeria...surprisingly. It was also very popular with the kids, as they have some creepy golden animatronics that perform for them as they munch on some food. Weird...but hey, kids. Anyhoo, whole reason I was here is because they were looking for a few employees to use their new suits, which they call Spring Suits. Apparently they can act as both animatronics and suits, which is actually really cool. I was naturally interested, so I got in contact and was thankfully hired, as was my childhood friend Johnny. We were both excited, and decided to celebrate with some pizza at Freddy's, because hey, why not? 

Anyways, Johnny and I were supposed to come today to the pizzeria to learn about these Spring Suits, get introduced to the company, etc. Johnny was supposed to come at 4:20 PM. My time was at 11:15 however, and it was 11:17 currently, so I was pretty on time. I took a seat in a comfy red chair, looking over the dining area. I checked the golden animatronics out - One looked like a bear and had a purple bowtie and hat, and was pretty plump. The other looked like a Bunny, and had a little bit of a darker golden tint to it. It had a tail, some ears...and that was pretty much it. It seemed like a side character to the plump bear, because it was also facing towards the wall, kinda like it was less important. The floor look liked a unicorn vomited confetti all over nice blue carpet. The walls were gray, but also had that colorful confetti on it too. There were colored spotlights facing the stage, focused on the animatronics. Tables were scattered around the dining area, ready for the onslaught of kids. All the sudden, the animatronics whirred to life, their eyes glowed, and you could hear some slight clicking and clacking, and they moved about, twisting and turning. Finally, they looked down at the dining area. At that exact moment, an employee opened the big red doors, and a flood of children flowed in, cheering and what not.

 I quickly moved out of the way and waited for the onslaught of children to end...which did, pretty quickly. Right at that moment, a man wearing an orange shirt and khakis walked towards me, and introduced himself as Phil. ""So, you're the new employee, eh?"" Said Phil. I replied with a swift yes. ""Ha, okay. Well let's get you hooked up. Alright, follow me now for a quick tour around the restaurant."" I nodded and followed. He first showed me even more of the show stage and told me the names of the 2 animatronics: Fredbear and Spring Bonnie. After more not too juicy details, we walked into what Phil called the Safe Room, which was hidden behind a grey door with a big sign on it that said ""STAFF ONLY."" As we walked inside, I could see it was actually a pretty large room, with grey, bland tile for flooring, and bland grey walls. There were 2 broken down arcade machines, and a technician inside the guts of one them, trying to fix it. Limp were two yellow suits, pretty much identical to those on stage. ""Well, here are the Spring Suits."" Said Phil. ""Wow...they look pretty bulky."" I replied. ""Haha, well, that's why you're here, to learn how to use them...alright, let's get this thing rollin'."" Phil replied. I nodded, and listened. ""Alright, so these babies are our new, specially designed Spring Suits. They can act as animatronics and suits. Since we have the Main Animatronics up on stage, we mostly use them in suit mode, but sometimes they need to act as animatronics. At the end of the day though we put them back into animatronic mode, because keeping them in suit mode would too much pressure onto the Springlocks, and they would eventually buckle randomly. So, anyways. If we ask you to wear them, here's how you do it. First, you get one of our handy dandy hand cranks from the shelf right over...here..ah, here we go!"" Phil grabbed a metal crank and showed me it. ""This is a hand crank. Say the Spring Suit is in animatronic mode. If you need to go inside, you aren't just going to jump in, you are going to insert this hand crank into a little hole on the back of the animatronic, haha...uh, anyway. So yeah, once you put the handcrank in that wee little hole on it's back, you're going to twist it to the left until you heard a loud click. Once you hear that, another employee will help you put the suit on. He will take the head off, and you will jump inside. The tech behind it is pretty simple...that hand crank moves the animatronic parts to the sides of the inside of the suit, and the Springlocks keep them there. That allows you to go inside safely. Anyways, the employee will take the head off, you will jump inside and get comfortable. Then with your right hand you will do a simple signal to prove you're okay."" Phil said. Phil then showed me a simple gesture, where only his Ring Finger and Pinkie are up. ""This is our little signal to prove you're snug inside the suit. After you do that, the other employee will put the head on, and you will be free to roam the restaurant. We advise you to move towards kids and entertain them, hug them, etc. You know, stuff that makes them happy."" Phil said. ""Alright, seems simple enough, Phil. This sounds pretty sweet."" I said. ""Great, Alex. Alright, but before we can continue the restaurant tour, I need to tell you some warnings and what not."" Phil said quickly. ""Uh...okay. They're dangers?"" I asked. ""Yes, quite a few...but it's nothing to worry about if you are good with the suits, I assure you. Just don't breathe on the Springlocks, don't let them get wet, don't make sudden movements, that kind of stuff. Remember these locks are the only things that are stopping the animatronics parts from slicing you into tiny bits. Use common sense and stay safe, alright Alex?"" ""Uh...wow. Okay. Sure, Phil. What happens if something does go wrong?"" I asked worriedly. ""Well, uh...I am just going to be honest with you Alex, there's not a huge chance of survival if things go wrong. Those animatronic parts are sharp and made of metal, and if those Springlocks buckle, they are going into your body swiftly...and they go everywhere. Your eyes, your mouth, your chest, your arms, your legs, your stomach, your head, even your groin area. ""Ouch..."" I said, shocked. ""Yeah...um. So if something does go wrong, just try to get to the Safe Room. We don't want people seeing an employee getting crushed in a suit. It would ruin our company..."" ""Alright, alright, I get it. Don't be stupid."" I said, kinda shocked, annoyed, and worried. ""Uh...yeah. Pretty much."" said Phil. ""Well, alright...can we move on? I got butterflies in my stomach from just the thought of being crushed in this deathtrap."" ""Yeah, sure...okay. Let's go to the Office."" Said Phil. ""Sure"" I replied. Phil and I exited the Safe Room and Phil locked the door. Fredbear was talking in a deep voice and saying, ""Welcome kids, to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza! A magical, fun, safe place for parents and kids...chow down on our delicious pizza, or nibble on some nachos, and enjoy the show...let's dance!"" All the sudden, some weird music came on and Fredbear and Spring Bonnie started to twist and turn and ""sing."" 

Kids roared with laughter and got all giddy about it. I chuckled and followed Phil. We passed the Arcade Area, which was was a small little area in the corner of the building, packed with arcade machines. Kids were glued onto the screens, playing the games. As we passed them, we walked down a long hallway on the back wall, which had checkered black and white tiles. At the end of the hallway was a pretty big office, with a desk and chair, and some TV's stacked on top of each other. On the TV were labels such as ""Cam 03"" and ""Stage 01"" and what not. ""This is where our night guard watches the place at night. These TV's show him what's going in the restaurant at night."" said Phil. ""Pretty neat, seems comfy enough."" I said quickly. In that moment, I glanced down at my watch, and realized it was 12:30. I had a Doctors Appointment at 1:00. ""Hey, uh, Phil, I gotta get going, I have an appoi-"" I was cut off before I could finish my sentence. ""Alright, well, nice meeting you Alex. Hope to see you tomorrow. Welcome to the family!"" As Phil finished, he gave me a slap on the back. I chuckled, and walked away. As I entered my car, I thought about the Spring Suits and what kind of danger I was getting into. I shrugged it off, and drove off.

June 13th, 1987.

I arrived back at Freddy's Fazbear's Pizzeria, at around 1:00 in the Afternoon. I already knew what I supposed to get ready for, as Phil gave me a phone call this morning, telling me he won't be there when I get there and I should get in the Fredbear Spring Suit. So I walked towards the Safe Room and opened the door with the special keys Phil gave me. As I walked in, I noticed one of the arcade machines I saw there yesterday was gone. I presumed it was just repaired. I saw an employee with a yellow Freddy Fazbear's Cap on, who introduced himself as David. ""Alright, I presume your Alex, eh?"" ""Yeah, that's me."" I replied. ""Alright, I am going to get you into that Fredbear Suit, alright?"" ""Sure, okay..."" I replied, worried. ""Don't be scared...I can assure you they are quite safe."" David replied quickly. I believed him, and at the same time I kinda didn't. At that moment however, he took off the suit's head. ""No hand crank?"" I replied. ""No, we already got this guy in suit mode for your first day."" Replied David. I smiled, and climbed into the suit via a short ladder. As I walked inside, I realized how very dark it was, and I could see some of the Springlocks holding back the animatronic parts that could end my life in a split second. I carefully went in, and eventually after a minute or two, my whole body was comfortably in. I got my hands and feet comfortable as well, and then sighed in relief. I then remember what Phil told me, not to breathe on the Spring Locks. I then suddenly remembered to do that confirmation gesture Phil showed me. I did it, and David put the head back on. ""Alright, some dude named Johnny's in the Spring Bonnie suit already, okay dude?"" ""Alright, got it. Thanks David."" I replied. ""No problem bro, good luck."" replied David. After that, he removed the ladder, padded me on the back, and stepped back.

 I moved slowly...surprisingly, it was pretty light, but still difficult. I walked out of the Safe Room, only able to see out of the 2 eye holes, which wasn't a lot. I walked into the main dining area, and saw Johnny in the Spring Bonnie suit. Kids were shaking his hand and hugging him. As I entered the room, kids screamed with delight, some chanting, ""Fredbear, Fredbear, Fredbear!"" I smiled a little, happy I could entertain so many kids. One asked if I could hug him, and I did, and he ran over to his Mom and probably told her how Fredbear hugged him. Others shook my hand, hugged me some more, etc. Me and Johnny walked over to the Arcade Area, to entertain some more kids. As we walked over, I saw a kid with brown hair crying and running away from us. It made me quite sad to see. Suddenly, I noticed something about Johnny, he seemed to be limping back towards the Safe Room, and then I noticed a trail of blood. Without thinking, I ran towards him, and then felt a sharp pain in my left leg...I looked down at the floor, and saw blood pouring out. All the sudden I heard a loud, CRACK!

 At that moment, a sharp pain engulfed me, and I winced. I couldn't walk. I collapsed onto the floor. The pain of falling onto the carpet was severe. My body ached from hitting the suit so hard. As I looked up, I saw the Spring Bonnie suit on the floor, blood leaking out from it in every possible direction. One of Johnny's eyes popped out of its sockets, and looked like a bloody marble on the floor. He was screaming in agony, crying for help, and even saying my name to help him. Suddenly I heard another snap, and I heard bones crack, and muscle rip, and organs get crushed. Blood flew through the room, and the blood pool around the suit grew larger. He kept screaming so loud, and I knew I could do nothing for my friend, who was dying right in front of me. I heard another crack, which came from the lower jaw of the animatronic. His screams were no longer screams...they were inhuman bellows, as metal beams crisscrossed his mouth. His inhuman bellow and cries continued to get louder and louder, and blood started to leak out of his mouth. Another crack, and a few bloodied teeth came out of his mouth, and more metal beams entered his mouth. He was silenced now, and all he could do is try to scream, which would just result in a indistinguishable, bone chilling sound, a distant cry of help. Another loud snap crackle pop, and that's when I think his entire skull was crushed. Blood went flying, and pieces of brain, chunks of bone, skin, and muscle started leaking out of crevices in the head of the suit. My friend was dead, crushed inside these sinister deathtraps. But all this happened in mere seconds, and the moment it ended, I too felt a sharp pain in my arm, as blood flew everywhere. I winced, but let out a yelp. As I looked around, I saw parents covering their kids eyes, kids leaving with their parents, screams, cries...it was horrid to watch. Another crackle sound, and my groin was crushed, the worst pain I have felt. It was quick, but resonated throughout my body. The pain was too great. I wanted to die now. But no. I knew it would be slow. I closed my eyes and prayed. During that, I heard 3 other cracks and tears, and I felt my arms go numb. Sharp pains were everywhere in my body, and I was screaming and I didn't even really realize it. I was twitching and screaming, bits and pieces of me flying everywhere. I then felt a metal beam pierce my eye, as blood squirted out. I cried and screamed even more know, and tried to get up. All I did though was grab the leg of a terrified parent, putting her in a even worse state. The pain was so great I started to flail about, kicking and wincing and twitching. It was hopeless. I were to die in a pizzeria mascot suit...what a crappy way to die. At that moment, all the Springlocks in my limbs failed, and sharp pains pierced my body, as more dark blood leaked out. Chunks of bone and muscle and flesh were all over the floor, and were creating a sour, nauseating smell, mixed with the fresh smell of pizza and other food. The metal beam in my eye was a constant pain, and then I felt one go through the roof of my mouth and into my tongue. I winced, and screamed some more. Rip, tear, slice, were the noises are more metal beams rushed through into my mouth, slowly slicing me apart. My screams were now muffled, and they were hisses and grunts. Nobody was in the pizzeria now, save for David, who was calling the police and crying. The last thing I saw was Fredbear. At the very moment, my skull was crushed. Pieces of my brain went flying, and bone fragments and muscle did too. Everything went dark. I felt no more pain. I was happy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The remaining scene was a horrifying one. The two suits were torn apart, blood leaking out from every possibly crevice. The once cheerful carpet was stained with the dark, murky blood, and was covered in bone fragments, muscle fragments, skin fragments, and organ fragments. The two employees inside were mangled to bits. Metal beams crisscrossed their mouth, and one sharp metal beam went through one of their groins. More breached their eyes, legs, and arms. Their chest was torn apart, and bits of their organs were falling out into the bottom of the suit. Fingers and toes were indistinguishable, mangled apart or completely missing. Both skulls were crushed, with their brains torn apart, breached by metal beams. A truly horrific death, that caused the end of the Springlock era. ",fivenightsatfreddys,Springlocks.

I believe that if we can't figure this out, he well. Scott said he pretty much nailed FNAF 2, and did well on his Trilogy Timeline (Besides Purple Guy = Phone Guy, leel.) Our last hope is MatPat. He's solved it in the past through hard, grueling work. So if we can't, he can.

If this was during the Spring Suit era, Fredbear and Spring Bonnie couldn't be on stage, because employees would be wearing them.

Early 70's, possibly 1970, 1971, 1972, or 1973.
Fredbear's Family Diner opens. Fredbear is brown, no purple bow tie and no purple hat. He's brown, with a grey hat and 2 buttons on his chest. We see Fredbear's
Family Diner in the Take Cake to the Children minigame in FNAF 2. A kid is murdered, and possesses the Puppet, which we don't see in the Take Cake minigame because it's
in a different part of Fredbear's. The restaurant closes, and Fredbear's is bought by Fazbear Entertainment. 

1974.
Fazbear Entertainment opens up their first location, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. We know this opens in 1974, because math. Anyways. It features Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie, 
both Spring Suits. This means that they can be used as animatronics or as a suit for someone to wear. Sister locations have these specially designed Spring Suits too, 
but sadly 2 employees died in them at a sister location, and the Spring Suits must be retired. Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie are both put into storage and locked away. This
is when Fazbear Ent. brings in the Gen. 1 animatronics: Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. Purple Man uses the Spring Bonnie suit in the backroom to lure 5 kids into the
backroom, and then he kills them. He probably does this at night. During the night, the Puppet, in trying to save them, puts the bodies into the suits. This allows the kids
to possess the Gen. 1 suits. He stuffs the 5th kid into Golden Freddy, the old Spring Suit. After these murders, the restaurant and it's sister locations all close. 

1983: Fazbear Ent. airs Fredbear and Friends, which features Golden Freddy, A.K.A ""Fredbear"", Spring Bonnie, and the Gen. 1 characters all as friends. People in costumes play them, because animation and animatronics weren't cheap back then.

Mid 1980's-ish. 
Fazbear Entertainment opens a new restaurant, possibly called Fredbear and Friends. It features the Golden Freddy Spring Suit, but locked in animatronic mode. He also has a 
Purple Bowtie and Hat, so people don't recognize him as one of the deadly old Spring Suits. But to be honest, he is, and Fazbear Ent. just used him because money was tight
for them. They also reused Spring Bonnie, who they probably changed so people don't recognize him as one of those old deadly Spring Suits. Again, money is tight for Fazbear
Ent., so that's why they reused those old Spring Suits. To reiterate, both of these old Spring Suits are locked in animatronic mode, so nobody can do evil things or nobody
else can get crushed. Now, they liked when employees could go in the suits themselves and interact with the kids, but they don't want more people to die. So what do they do?
No, they don't make more Spring Suits, but they use the Fredbear and Spring Bonnie costumes from the show Fredbear and Friends. Purple Man helps people put these old
costumes on in this location too, which is what we see in one of FNAF 4's easter eggs. 

Oh, and around this time, Fazbear Ent. makes a ""Toy Line"" with plushies of many animatronics. It also features Toy versions of the old animatronics, and kids love them.

Early/Mid 1987-ish.
The location that was opened sometime in the mid 1980's is still open, but won't be for much longer. The restaurant is relatively popular, until a group of bullies grab a 
young kid and put him in Golden Freddy's mouth as a game. That is, until the kid gets his skull crushed. The kid is rushed to the hospital, and has nightmares about the
animatronics. They remove his Frontal Lobe to try to help him, but instead he dies a little while after. Rest in Pepperonis FNAF 4 Crying Kid, ????-1987. The restaurant
obviously closes, because, damn, that's a bad incident.



NOTE: An idea I have been toying with is that on the Night 3 minigame, when the Golden Freddy plush tells to remember what we saw and not go in there, well, first, I want to
say this is an idea I have just been toying with, and it's probably really stupid, but: What if we're not playing as the victim then, but as another kid, and the plush is
telling us to remember what we saw when the kid died from the bite. I mean, look at the restaurant: It's empty, and barren...and employees seem to slowly be gathering at
the entrance to the dining area, where the Bite happened. It's just a thought and idea I had been toying with, so it might be super damn stupid. So sorry in advance.


November 1987: 
The FNAF 2 location opens, and every penny essentially went into this place. They bought new animatronics, the Toy Animatronics, based off the ones from the
old Toy Line, because kids loved them. The old Gen. 1 animatronics are in the back room, and Golden Freddy and Spring Bonnie are stored somewhere. Anyhoo. Sometime during the few weeks this 
building was open, Purple Man tried to kill 5 more kids. As he worked at the 1st location with the Spring Locks, he knows a thing or two and comes prepared. 
Remember Spring Bonnie, and how, in the Bite of 87 location, he was locked in Animatronic Mode, as he was once a deadly Spring Lock suit? Purple Man knew that, and so 
he brought a device with him, probably a classic hand crank, to open him up to make way for his body, thus turning it back into suit mode. So he does, and kills 5 more kids. 
The Puppet this time doesn't want to stuff the kids into the suits, he wants to S A V E T H E M. Save Them. So he gets Freddy and then come to stop Purple Man, who does 
something to poor Freddy, disabling him, hence the ""You can't."" Poor Freddy. The Puppet of course leaves after this, because he has no arms or anything and is all alone, and
thus can hardly do anything to him. More dead kids closes the restaurant down, and the Toy Animatronics are scrapped.

Early 1990's.
Fazbear Ent. reuses their 1st ever location, and repairs the old Gen. 1 Animatronics, and changes them up a little. They are brought back on stage...yay! Golden Freddy and 
Spring Bonnie are still sealed away. It eventually closes due to budget at the end of the year. 

Sometime between the early 1990's to 2023:
Purple Man returns to the old location and dismantles the animatronics. Unknown to him, this releashes the spirits. Oh, and Golden Freddy's spirit is unleashed as well.
So, all 5 of these kids surprise Purple Man, who is in the Safe Room with the Spring Bonnie suit. He is scared, and jumps into the Spring Bonnie suit...and it crushes him. Ouch.
The kids disappear, and Purple Man is left to rot and die a slow death.

2023:
Springtrap, once Spring Bonnie, is recovered by Fazbear Fright. They plan to use him in a horror attraction they are making. While a nightguard is working a week there, Springtrap
attempts to kill him, because he was once a savage murderer. He fails. And soon after the guard finishes his work, the place burns down. And thanks to the Nightguard, the kids' spirits are 
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Yay!

It's a small diner, with just one animatronic: Fredbear. A kid is murdered here and possesses Fredbear. The restaurant closes down and is bought by Fazbear Entertainment. 

Note: I am still unsure if the Puppet existed at this time. Did the child possess Fredbear or the Puppet? If he possessed the Puppet, it must mean it existed at that time too.

Early 1980's: A new restaurant, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, is created. It features Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie, who both were Spring Suits. It was popular, and had Sister Locations, that had Spring Suits as well. However, at one of the sister locations, 2 people were killed inside Springlock Suits. They became Shadow Bonnie and Shadow Freddy. Anyways, because of that incident, all the Spring Suits were retired, as they were unstable, and they were put into storage. For a brief time, they had replacements: Purple animatronic versions of Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie. Remember, these are not the Shadow Characters, those are completely different. Remember, the Shadow Characters are the phantoms of the employees who died in the Spring Suits. These are animatronic replacements until the Generation 1 Characters come in. And finally, the Generation 1 characters did indeed arrive: Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. 


1983: Fazbear Entertainment didn't forget about Fredbear though. in 1983, they made a show called Fredbear and Friends, that mixed Fredbear with the new Generation 1 animatronics. It proved so popular they based a sister location on the star of the show, Fredbear, with a Purple Bowtie and Hat. It was Fredbear from the original diner, repainted. It also had a Golden Bonnie up on the stage with Fredbear. They entertained children, and it was quite popular. 

During this time, they were also introducing a Toy Line, making toys and plushies of all different kinds of animatronics. They introduced the Toy Animatronics, named after the Toy Line, and kids loved them.

Anyhoo, the Bite of 83 soon at Fredbear and Friends: A kid got his entire skull crushed by Fredbear, and died a few days later. This forced the restaurant to shut down, and old possessed Fredbear is forgotten. So is the Golden Bonnie. In fact, the whole restaurant is forgotten and shut down. 

Meanwhile, while the cops are distracted with that incident, Purple  Man returns and kills 5 kids at the original Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. He stuffs them into the Generation 1 animatronics to hide them. Parents complain of a foul smell coming from the animatronics, like dead bodies. And due to health standards, the place is closed down.

After years of shame and trying to regrow their reputation, they finally open a new restaurant in...

1987: This is the new and improved one we see in FNAF 2. The old, Gen. 1 animatronics are forgotten and put in storage. They are ripped apart and broken. They are replaced with the Toy Animatronics, based off the Toy Animatronics from the Toy Line in 1983. Kids loved the plushies, so maybe they will love them in animatronic form, and thus all will be well! Well, uh no...

First, another bite takes place. An animatronic this time bit someone's frontal lobe and ripped it out, or ate it, or, uh, something. Bottom line, the dude was missing his frontal lobe. He managed to survive at least for a while, but after that...we don't know. This became known as the Bite of 87. 

And then, again, while the cops were distracted, Purple Man killed another 5 kids in the FNAF 2 restaurant, probably at night. We have no idea where he put them, MAYBE inside the Toy Animatronics, but it's unlikely...I mean, look at Fat Toy Freddy...ahem, anyhoo. It's also not known if they possessed the toys or not. Bottom line, 5 more kids were murdered at the FNAF 2 location. And that causes the place to close down, along with the Bite of 87.

Fazbear Entertainment is now ruined, and is not as popular anymore due to the countless number of incidents they have had. They make one last attempt in...

The early 90's: Yup, they try once more. With a new, smaller restaurant. The Toy Animatronics were put away after those previous incidents at the FNAF 2 location, and they fixed the Generation 1 animatronics. Famous Phone Guy dies here, and Mike Schmidt is his replacement. Then it closes down, because, well, hard times. 

Sometime between the 90's or 2023, Purple Man returns to dismantle the animatronics once and for all. And so he does. Except, the ghosts of the dead kids come out. While in the Safe Room, they surprise him, and Purple Man, being the coward he is, hides in the old Golden Bonnie suit...remember, from the 1st location? Yeah, well, that thing's really old and dirty and broken, and it crushes him. And the ghosts just leave him there to die. And die he does. Painfully.



2023: Fazbear Fright: The Horror Attraction opens, with Springtrap (Previously the Golden Bonnie from the 1st location) as the main star to spook the audiences! Also, Purple Man is jammed in Springtrap, and still haunts it. They find Springtrap a week before the place opens, and they have a Night Guard there to watch the place before it opens up. Well, Springtrap, having a murderer stuffed in him, tries to kill the Night Guard at night...and fails. The unnamed Night Guard also becomes a hero by somehow freeing the kids forever from their animatronic bodies. Yay! And then Fazbear Fright burns down.

The End!

November 7th, 1987.

I just came home from school and got an invite to a kid's party. I think he's the new kid, I think his name is like, Dylan or something. Anyways, I guess he's cool. He's shy though and barely talks to anyone, and he cries a lot....hope nothing is wrong. I overheard his mother talking to his the teacher about how's he scared of...animakonics? No...anima--tr-dang, I can't remember...something like that. Anyways he was late for school because he was scared and had nightmares. I feel bad. He should be happy though, he lives really close to the best pizzeria in town, Fredbear and Friends. The pizza there is so good and the robots are so funny!!! Fredbear is my favorite. Anyways, back to that party invite...I think it's hosted by his Dad and it's happening at Fredbear and Friends, so I am excited. 

November 8th, 1987. 

Dylan just had a complete breakdown in class...he started screaming and crying and curled up in a corner and just cried. Some kids laughed at him. I don't like them. They are big bullies. I tried talking to him but he was still crying and he just said that he hated...animatronics? No idea what that is. I think I am going to ask my Mommy. 


Mommy said that they are robots, like Fredbear. I guess that makes sense...Fredbear isn't real, though I wish he was. Oh well.

November 9th, 1987. 

The party is tomorrow after school....so excited! But I saw some kids today beating up Dylan and he was just crying and crying...he tried hitting them back but they just laughed and kicked him. He just kept crying and his nose was a dark blue and purple. And he was bleeding on his forehead. I hope he's okay. 

November 10th, 1987. The Party.

Well, today's the day, yay yay yay! My Mommy drove me to Fredbear and Friends, and we walked through the big red doors. I saw something really cool, I saw a man in the Purple Suit putting a suit on someone...so cool. He winked at me. I like him. I got to talk to him a little bit. He is nice. Some meanie invited the bullies to the party, and they were making insults about how cheap the place is and how dirty it is. I think Fredbear is nice and has good pizza. Fredbear is so nice, I got to talk to him and he gave me a hug. I played some arcade games and I got a lot of Fredbear Coins, and my Mommy let me buy a Spring Bonnie plushie. I really like it, he's my friend. He's so cute. Spring Bonnie sings with Fredbear, and he's also nice. I didn't get to hug him though. I went back to play more games, and saw the bullies laughing at how crappy Dylan's party was and how stupid his Dad was for choosing this place. They are meanies, his dad is nice. I got to say hi to him once, but he's busy so I only talked to him once. He was nice. I tried talking to them, but they kicked me in my tummy and it hurt really bad. I ran into the eating area and cried into my Mom's T-Shirt, but then the pizza came and I was happy. So everyone started eating...but then...the bullies...they had Dylan. Someone asked them what they were doing, and they said they were showing Dylan something cool. The parents started looking at them in a funny way. Some person in the back in a Purple Suit looked at them confused. We went back to our food. Then, we heard a blood curdling, ear-piercing scream. The man in the Purple Suit shoved people away and started screaming loudly and he hurt my ears. And then I looked...and...an...Fredbear was eating Dylan....Dylan was crying so loudly and screaming, and his Dad came out of nowhere and started screaming too. The guard and the Dad were screaming. And then...oh...the jaws shut with a loud snap, and we heard muscles ripping and tearing, and bones being crushed and snapping...and there was so much blood, on the walls...dark red....and white hard pieces were everywhere...I think they were bone....in my pizza....and the walls were covered in blood, and the bullies weren't doing anything....and the blood...it was a dark red...mixed with bone fragments, muscle fragments, and skin fragments...there was even pieces of hair on the tile too...and the tile had a huge slab of skull on it, with hair, bone, muscle, and hair...and blood was leaking from it. Dylan's body was frozen...limp, just hanging from the mouth...limp and lifeless. He wasn't moving or crying or screaming. Blood was leaking from Fredbear's mouth and dripping onto the floor and onto his shoes. Fredbear's mouth was smeared with blood, with bone fragments and muscle and skin everywhere on him. He wasn't moving, his jaw was jammed into Dylan's skull, it was at least 7 inches in Dylan's skull, the teeth smeared and stained in dark red, gory blood. The parents...there was screaming...and kids were running and some were running to the bathroom...some were crying and running to their parents...and some were running out the door, and some people were throwing up...the sour stench of vomit mixed with the stench of fresh blood...creating, in all, a foul, sour smell...painful to your nostrils. It's hard to describe the smell...salty....it even smelled like feces almost...I can't describe it...it was foul and sour...and the parents, oh the poor parents...they were screaming and kids were weeping and screaming all over the place, and we could hear the sirens of an Ambulance, Police Cars, and Firetrucks in the background. The man in the Purple Suit was grabbing the bullies by the ears and pulling them into the quiet, abandoned arcade room...screaming at them on how stupid they were, how evil they were, and said they were getting in huge trouble. Dylan's daddy was crying so hard...and screaming...and trying to touch his son and hug him and kiss him...and then the Ambulance came, and slowly opened Fredbear's mouth and removed Dylan's body. His head...oh...it was shredded, actually, it wasn't even shredded...it was destroyed. His face was stained in blood, and one of his eye sockets were just a dark blood with no eye. His nose was shredded, and his ears were also shredded. His mouth was leaking blood...so much blood...his forehead was destroyed, you could see inside his head...you could see his brain and some of his skull, and skull fragments were littered everywhere on his face, as was muscle fragments and what remained of his blood soaked skin. As they carried his body away, I could see some of Fredbear's teeth lodged into the hole in his head. Fredbear was ruined...his jaw was ripped open, and now you could see inside...I gagged. It was full of blood and the normal bone fragments....it was leaking a lot of blood, and some of his teeth were missing. The rest were loose or covered in blood. His entire face was soaked in dark red blood. The Spring Mechanism that opened his jaw was broken. Part of it was on the floor, and because it was broken, his jaw was twisted into a sinister position...looking from afar, he looked like the Devil himself, with a twisted, bloody jaw and a blood soaked face, his eyes starting emptily. The Police were asking everyone questions, and they took away the bullies. Dylan's body was taken away by the medics. The tarp over his body became blood soaked over his skull the moment it came in contact with it. The last we saw of him was a tarp over what used to be Dylan, soaked in blood, being rolled away into an Ambulance, his Dad weeping next to him...his tears dropped onto the tarp, and left tiny marks. 

November 11th, 1987.

Mommy, Daddy, I am sorry for all the mean things I have done, I really am sorry...and I want to be with Dylan now...I don't feel good....I am sorry...I will miss you...give all my plushies a big kiss and hug them. 

Bye Bye Mommy

Robert. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was later found that Robert had locked himself in his room and written a quick suicide note. Before then, he had grabbed a steak knife from the kitchen. Once in his room, he jabbed into his skull repeatedly and violently.....probably basing it off Dylan's death. He eventually sliced open his skull as blood leaked out and continued to rip it open. Bone fragments and blood spilled onto his carpet, as did chunks of his brain. He collapsed onto the floor and bled out, with his parents banging on the door, screaming, coming to his aid after they heard him screaming. In the dark corner of his closest, they found a blood soaked Spring Bonnie plushie, one of the eyes ripped out and the skull ripped apart.

But I would like to wish everyone a Happy FNAF Anniversary. It's been a wild ride thanks to Mr. Cawthon, from thinking that Phone Guy was stuffed into Chica because of her extra teeth in the back, to thinking Springtrap was going to be a hybrid of sorts. It's been one heck of a fun ride, and we've learned so much about the vague story. 

So thank you Scott Cawthon for all 4 of these games. They were absolutely fantastic. And now, we celebrate the release of the one and only original, Five Nights at Freddy's.

1ST TIMELINE, BITE OF 83 INCLUDED WITH BITE OF 87.

Late 70s - Fredbear's Family Diner. A kid is murdered and the place is closed down.

Early 80's: The 1st Freddy Fazbear's opens. It has sister locations, and a show called Fredbear and Friends airs. The 1st Freddy Fazbear's has Fredbear and Spring Bonnie, but due to faulty spring locks, they were retired and sent to a sister location. The show Fredbear and Friends was so popular they made a sister location based on it, and brought Fredbear and Spring Bonnie onto the main stage for the Fredbear and Friends location. A kid's skull is crushed in the Bite of 83 at Fredbear and Friends and he later dies, and then sometime later 5 kids are murdered at Freddy Fazbear's pizza and are stuffed into the suits. The restaurant chain closes down, and the old animatronics, including Fredbear and Spring Bonnie, are forgotten.

Late 80's: The 2nd Freddy Fazbear's opens, with new, safer Toy Animatronics. The Bite of 87 occurs, and the victim is probably Jeremy Fitzgerald, the previous Night Guard. Purple Man then kills 5 more kids, and the restaurant closes down.

Early 90s: The final Freddy Fazbear opens, and then closes due to budget issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2ND TIMELINE, NO BITE OF 83. 

Late 70s:  Fredbear's Family Diner opens, kid is murdered, and the place closes. 

Early 80s: 1st Freddy Fazbear's Opens, with sister locations. Incidents with Spring Locks occur and employees die and the Spring Suits are retired. Then 5 kids are murdered and stuffed into the suits and the place closes down.

1983: Fredbear and Friends air.

1987: The 2nd, new and improved Freddy Fazbear's opens with safer Toy Animatronics. A sister location is based off the famois show Fredbear and Friends, with Fredbear and Spring Bonnie being the main stars. The Bite of 87 happens at Fredbear and Friends, and then 5 kids are murdered (But probably not stuffed) at the 2nd Freddy Fazbear's.

Early 90s: Final Freddy Fazbear's opens and then closes due to money issues.

But I recently watched a video explaining it, and it seemed pretty interesting. My take on is that some did, and some didn't. Some were probably covered in feathers, like Velociraptor. But some huge ones like Spinosaurus and T.rex probably had extremely little or none. It just depended on the dinosaur and the environment.
And some just probably didn't, because it seems weird, like Ankylosaurus or Stegosaurus...but they could've. At least, that's my take on it.
