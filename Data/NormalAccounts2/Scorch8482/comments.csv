It doesnt feel like a cohesive album to me. My favorites off it are Packt, Pulk/Pull, Pyramid, LSP, and Hunting Bears, but the rest of the album just feels super underwhelming to me. YAWA is pretty good, but I dont hear anything special in it. I Might Be Wrong sounds like an OKC B-Side. Knives Out I just dislike (no progression, drawn out, dont like the instrumentation). Dollars and Cents isnt bad but it suffers from the same problems as Knives Out. LIAGH just irritates me because of the sax drop when he says ""well of course Id love to sit around and chat."" Its just too ear-piercing and doesnt fit the song's mood. The lyric there isnt very good either.

One time I was smoking in our attic (it has a little fan/window that I c an blow the smoke out of easily). I decided to put on some music while I was huddled there on the dusty, wooden floor. I decided on Amnesiac. Even when I finished my bowl I just laid on the floor in my attic listening to Amnesiac. It just felt so... Right. 

The first time I saw Radiohead live at Lollapalooza this year I had a cap beforehand. That was an awesome experience as well. I didn't take a lot so I didn't feel too... Under the influence, but enough where things felt different. Thom and friends looked like gods layering wisdom upon the crowd. Drugs or not it was an incredible show.

Its an outdoor festival run by Chance. Its not going to get too crazy. Still, there will probably be some moshing going on, especially for acts like Skrillex. Just be aware of what moshing is, and dont be afraid of it. Uh... Listen to all the artists on the bill beforehand. When you make your schedule, be sure to familiarize yourself with everyones music (everyone you plan on seeing). 

Otherwise, if they let in backpacks Id say bring a small one that you can jump with. If you'd rather pack light, just be sure to bring your debit card, money, and anything else thats essential to you.

388,"Sorry for the wall of comments. Just some sporadic thoughts on everything that happened this weekend. 

It was an awesome weekend. I don't think it beat 2015 for me, but 2015 was pretty well stacked. I'd probably say my favorite sets were Car Seat Headrest, Digable Planets, Sufjan, Anderson, and Kamasi, with special shoutouts to Neon Indian for giving some energy before the storm that never came and to Miguel who I am now a fan of. Biggest disappointment was probably just the blue stage in general. A lot of acts were placed there and there were a lot of problems, so I would frequently visit but there were always issues and the crowd over at red always seemed a bit better. Beach House was definitely forgettable unfortunately. I wish there wasn't a Mick vs Carly and Brian vs Anderson vs Sufjan conflict, or else I think this year would have been even better. 

There were problems with losing my friends mid-Sufjan, so I was a little sad that I wasn't able to immerse myself with Subaru until around Chicago kicked in. He did an awesome job though. 

Met some assholes who decided to yell political bullshit during Beach House. That was annoying. 

I met a lot of great people this weekend. John, Izzy, Robbin, Geordie (who started the sunday dance lines during Holy Ghost). I hope I can see all four of these guys next year. You were all awesome and I thank you for being so kind to me. 

My mom also decided to come down on saturday. She somehow found me at the front of Martin Courtney mid-show. That was... Not expected.

I will have to admit, I think I am looking to Lollapalooza's LCD and Radiohead to steal best show of the year award this year. I normally prefer Pitchfork but I'm very excited for what Lolla has to offer in two weeks.

I'm praying for The Avalanches to come next year. ",2016-07-18 22:09:56+00:00,d5hdf9u,1.0,t3_4tgd47,16481.0,PitchforkMusicFest

Call me a judgmental asshole. Tell me to chill out and smoke more. At the end of the day, to frame my first year at school, all I have is what I hear. All of my peers could have told me that Weston is the worst place in the world. If they had, I wouldn't want to stay there. I would have no clue if it actually *wasn't, and in fact was an awesome dorm, because I cant experience it before I choose. The whole collegiate process is based on first impressions and judgments. You pick you're school based on your interactions there, money, and rankings. You pick your roommate by talking with them to see if you have things in common. 

When I ask if Allen is a good dorm for me, I ask those who have experienced the dorm to take what little info I can provide about myself and mentally see if I would fit well or not well into the puzzle. That whole prompt is loaded with judgment calls having to be made! Thats just the nature of it.

On my drive home (we drove separately) life, death, fading memories, change, adulthood, etc. all came crashing down. For thirty minutes I just fucking sobbed to RE: Stacks. I haven't actually cried in a couple years. I'm going off to college in 6 months. My life is changing, and so is my parent's. I know, in the next 25 years or so, my parents will pass. All I can think about is how I'm going to be able to survive when the time comes. Nearly every memory I have is tied to one of my parents. What the fuck happens when that line is severed?

My inner festival-freak is telling me to go with the 4-day because Lolla is sweet and the lineup is expected to be top notch this year (its their 25th anniversary, and they opened up a fourth day just because they couldn't fit all the good artists into one weekend), but either way its your call. 4 days go on sale March 22nd, lineup comes out March 23rd along with the single day passes. 

If you fail to get a pass, don't sweat it. Ticket prices usually only go up about $30-$40 for a single day on stubhub, so you wont go bankrupt over it.

So Id say go for 4-day for the fun of it, but if you're tight on cash just go for the single.

One thing to note, is that Lolla tickets sell out, FAST. Even if you get in right away, its hard af to buy tickets. Ideally you should clear your schedule during the time of which they go on sale to maximize your focus/efforts on getting tickets. Suburbanites LOVE Lollapalooza, so it sells out mad quickly.

Phil over at SF answered all of my questions in a very timely format. I also asked for some very, very minute detail adjustments, of which SF accommodated to very well. I sound like a salesman/like I work for SF, but my heart rate jumped up when I unwrapped the packaging. They really did nail this hilt on the head. 

I think an addiction has begun. For those of you worried about the price point, I'd say start at a lower cost saber (like the grab bag saber from Ultra) and go from there. I will say this though, any concerns you have over the amount of money invested will completely disappear once you receive it. I have 0 regrets putting money into a blade that fits my favorite character in all of fiction. I'm proud to have something that really represents my love for Star Wars in the physical form (outside of my own erect saber). If you guys have any questions, please ask!

There aren't any posts that seem ""legendary"" anymore. No AMA's of people drawing sex positions of a guy with two dicks. No Tom Cruise threads. No ""I have a request"" threads. Shit I cant even find those on the smaller subs I frequent. Im not being specific, I just want some more flavor that would remind me that reddit is a community rather another vent of pop-social culture. 

Its for these reasons that I no longer browse the Front page. I don't even look in AMA's anymore, because they're all dry af. Interesting and different threads no longer make it to the top.

1247,"A couple reasons. One of the important things to note is this is personal taste, but so is everyone's opinion on music. 

TPAB is a very important album, but within a day it was deemed a classic. No album can be deemed a classic until time tells. The content of the album, songs like Alright, are being chanted by african-american protesters in the feud of the decade right now. Kendrick released an album that we (America) needed, but that doesn't mean its all-powerful. In fact, I may so it's overrated.

GKMC featured tracks that boosted him to radio and gave him a platform to speak on. Swimming Pools and MAAD city are anthems of which he is an observer, and he essentially is reporting what he sees. Kids getting too fucked up for no good reason, mass crime and violence in the ghetto, peer pressure, lust for women, drugs, etc. He told a story in GKMC that conveyed so many themes and all of them equally important. GKMC is best played from start to finish, but you can just as easily go in and play any song on there in its singularity. Every track on GKMC is top notch, and the recordings spread throughout provide some of the best story-telling I have ever heard from am artist. Not even to mention that there isn't a single dull moment on the album (outside of perhaps Good Kid, which I personally love but others find a tad boring). In short, GKMC has the perfect mix of anthems and introspection (sometimes even on the same freakin song), and can be relatable to most of America. 

TPAB is the perfect successor. Kendrick really couldn't have done much better as a follow-up. In fact, most people assumed it would fail and be like Nas' It Was Written to Illmatic. It was thrown out to masses like a flank steak to rabid lions, and everyone raved about it. It is very important, with just as many themes as his last album. Black pride, loving yourself, overcoming depression, escaping anxiety, emerging from your cocoon. The thing flows smoothly and the poem was a great idea (especially the fucking ending, holy shit). It equals GKMC in just about every aspect, aside from TPAB being more experimental), except for one aspect. There are less tracks to go back to on secondary listens. There are tracks on TPAB that I skip all the time. Every month I re listen to the album fully, and once I do I still don't gain any more appreciation for the songs I skip. Songs like For Sale, You ain't gotta lie to kick it, Institutionalized. These are good songs, but they have zero replay value for me. There are one or two others too, but dare I mention them at the threat of being torn apart for listing them with any negative connotation attached. People are way too quick to call this album a masterpiece and way to aggressive to shoot down anyone who doesn't like it. I like this album, but its not an 11/10. I like the funk, I like the conscious lyrics, and I love the experimentation, but some of these tracks have melodies that just don't seem to match his vocals at all. Its like a juxtaposition that works in a technical sense, but doesn't sound all that appealing. For Sale and Institutionalized show this off the most. There are tracks on TPAB that I listen to a couple times, and I got it all down. I don't put on For Sale on my way home and rap along to the lyrics. I think most people listen to those songs, get the meaning down, then skip them in the future. This album has Its anthems, it has its introspective moments, and it has its themes that are oh so fucking important. But without the replay-value of the thing, I rate it lower to GKMC. It really is trying to figure out which diamond is shinier. Both are masterpieces, but I've listened to both enough times on repeat to know that I prefer GKMC ever so slightly. 

EDIT: I could probably argue why Section.80 is equal to, if not better than TPAB, but that's another argument for another day (hehe).

I should note, I am not black. The most important theme in TPAB  doesn't even pertain to me (neither really does GKMC), but for TPAB this is a bigger deal. It is for this reason that I may be biased. Even if I cant relate to what an artist is talking about (which is 85% of the time) I still can usually affirm what I like and don't like, and remain pretty unbiased.

Being polite in crowds, giving out high fives, dancing to your hearts content, offering water to those around you, sharing your bud, making conversation, and dancing with others (no, not dry humping every female you see, I'm talking dance circles, etc.) and overall be friendly. I was amazed, when at 16 I went to Pitchfork and people there actually talked to me, like I wasn't even a stranger! It's *that* which Lolla needs. Spread cheer, be open, and make the whole thing like one giant family gathering. I could care less if you're tripping balls and you love the lasers.

Expect (unless it changes from last year) ~$450 for the weekend on Stub Hub. As you probably know, it's best to wait until you get closer to the festival. 

 Don't expect that dream lineup. There is zero evidence that that will be the lineup this year. We all want it, but I even doubt we'd get one of those to be honest. Sir Paul and Metallica was a surprise to most last year, so expect the same this year (outside of LCD, I think they are pretty much locked in). We haven't had Ye or Radiohead in 8 years and it looks like New York booked Ye, so our odds may decrease of getting Kanye this year (which personally is infuriating considering 20% of his music is about Chicago and he's played every other festival up to 2 times since we've last seen him at Lolla).",2016-01-08 15:09:21+00:00,cyqn1l5,1.0,t3_3zzr4q,34089.0,Lollapalooza

I thought Narrow Stairs was a worthy successor to the sound that they created on Plans. It wasn't any Trans or Photo Album, but a great album overall. 

Codes was disappointing, yes, but even the band has since come to terms with it. They will play a couple songs from it (because believe it or not, there are plenty of DCFC fans who only ""like the happy songs,"" but they still largely play a wide variety over their discog. Kintsugi, I feel, was a great followup. Yes, the middle part of the album is entirely skippable, but the beginning 4 and last 3 songs make it all incredibly worth it. They are some of the best DCFC tracks since Plans imho. I think Kintsugi would fit right in with the bundle of Plans and NS. Great tunes. Some fall off lyrically, but there still are a couple gems in there.",2016-01-06 14:30:21+00:00,cyo13pn,2.0,t1_cyn4tei,66694.0,indieheads

Just very cheesy and the way some of it was delivered made it awkward. Plus, just how they were talking made certain aspects less believable. ""Our son is gone."" ""No! No Snoke took him!"" I don't know it just all sounded very elementary for two people who should be some of the wisest people in Star Wars. I think JJ assigned that 1 minute block of dialogue to explain too many background points that it sounded more like Han/Leia was talking to me and not each other.

The plot was way too similar to ANH. To the point where the story, outside of Rey/Finn, felt the exact same. Theres a difference between nods and copying. Im glad JJ played it safe, but at the very least I think there could've been something new other than another death star. 

Phasma was worthless. She had 3 lines in the movie and she never even points her gun. 

The movie should've been 15 minutes longer. Coruscant blows up and no one seems to even bat an eye. There was no elaboration on the impact of that, nor the First Order/Resistance/Republic and what they were. And what the fuck are the Knights of Ren? I have too many questions that really should've been answered in that movie. 

Adam Driver doesn't look threatening at all. I think this is more of an opinion, but when he took the mask off it reminded me of when Luke removed the Stormtrooper helmet. Made me second guess Kylo's power.

The music was kinda bland. I think this movie definitely ranks last in terms of score. There were several moments where John Williams could've made a scene that much more epic, and yet the score took it down. Especially the battle on the forest planet. It felt like an average battle with nothing special about it, despite that being our first glimpse into the resistance/first order in combat.

Other than that, I loved it. Definitely in my top 3 favorite SW movies. ",2015-12-18 17:32:49+00:00,cy3l0f5,1.0,t3_3xd12j,2982.0,StarWars

I was only five feet from Q. I was the guy I had always made fun of while watching live-streams of Coachella and such. I was that guy.

In NV, theres the cowboy theme. All the towns felt the same. The map size was small enough, but the lack of interesting locaions made it even smaller-seeming. The only actual places I remember are New Vegas, Primm, and Good Springs, and those are all pivotal to the story. Fallout 3 had immersion. I was actually scared to roam the subways, explore the unexplored, and walk around the wastes. In New Vegas, youre biggest threat was an oversized Bee and lizards. There wasnt even that much evidence of there being a Great War (compared to 3). And to top it all off, when you finished the story, the game ended, so your choices mattered only to the degree of which you are told what you did in the end. Its not real choices. Its not like, if you side with Legion, you play afterwards with Caeser ruling the Wasteland. Youre just told in a short cinematic ""this is what you did."" To me, thats not dynamic. Sure, its nice to make your own decisions, but those decisions didnt have much of an impact on the actual game.

Chvrches is just quality pop really. They make tunes that arent meant for the radio, but have pretty basic lyrics to sing along to and dance/jump around too. Their all very talented and their music is perfect for a live show (saw them at p4k 2015).

BADBADNOTGOOD is just a stellar new age jazz/hip hop group. They make tracks that combine hip hip beats and jazzy instruments to make something a bit of a mix of trippy and jam. They recently made an album with Ghostface Killah that was very good. They put on a great show too. To compare them to an edm act, their closest to FlyLo.

Friday: S/O to that big group fall on the right side pit of Mac DeMarco. Almost fucking died getting crushed when he stage dove. 

Saturday: S/O to the crowdsurfing of the trash can during Ferg. Also S/O to everyone waiting for Vince Staples and being surprised when Ariel Pink comes out and starts playing. 

Sunday: S/O to the people next to me at Jamie xx who were high af off of coke and the people infront of me who were high off of ecstasy. Your pushing and shoving got annoying during RTJ, but your weird twinkle dance-moves during jamie made it that much more magical. S/O to the group of guys who just ran in fucking circles during rtj.

SZA: R&amp;B master. Imagine Lana Del Rey with a lot of hip hop influence, but actually talented. She is my most hyped artist of the weekend tbh. Shes w/ TDE too. 

BADBADNOTGOOD: Jazz/hip hop trio that lay down some great fucking instrumentals. They recently did a joint with Ghostface Killah. I expect him to be brought out. 

The War on Drugs: Alternative. Not much to say about him besides that he's very talented. Listen to Red Eyes.

Gary Clark Jr: A guitar wizard. If you like a good rock/blues guitarist, he's your fix. 

As for what to bring: Water, money, and sunscreen. Also drugs if you're into that. Don't go crazy though. A quick way to ruin your (and others around you) night is to take more than you can handle/drink too much and become belligerent. Be responsible.

1927,"Youre not an asshole. Thats a reasonable request. I guess Im Just used to people asking for objective/less-then-apparent-opinionated reviews, so that they can trust it more. Personally, the album is still on repeat. I love Freddie Gibbs' flow throughout it because he's always hard hitting and his lyricism is absolutely on point. I never heard of Gibbs before this, and after having listened to it I dug into him further. Hes just a consistent guy, and I love that about him. 

And the beats. I fucking love the beats. Listen to Harolds and tell me you dislike that production. You're gonna have to listen to the beats if you want to paint a true picture of what Madlib's style is. Basically, Madlib takes albums and sound bytes from God knows where, and mashes it into a beat that is perfect for the right rapper to rap over. 

I think you may want a longer review and normally I would provide one, but I don't have a lot of time. Honestly, just listen to the two tracks I provided, as well as the song ""Deeper,"" then extend that to form an opinion of them overall. Thats mostly the album sounds like and thats how they will most likely sound live. ",2015-06-29 12:41:06+00:00,csmbfdj,4.0,t1_csm5viw,22145.0,PitchforkMusicFest
1928,"Cocaine Pinata is viewed as being one of the top hip hop releases of last year. Madlib, a legendary producer known for his incredible sampling skills and classic yet creative hip hop beats, teamed up with Gibbs to release it. Freddie Gibbs is quickly rising to fame, at least in the underground Hip Hop scene. Just about everything he has released in the past 2 years has been consistently top notch. 

The pair are performing together in order to perform Pinata. That album is my favorite release of 2014 for several reasons. The production on it is incredible; truly Madlib's greatest work in a while. Freddie Gibbs also absolutely delivered. There isn't a single low point on the album. It is short and concise enough to cut out the fluff, but long enough to give enough variety for a proper taste of MadGibbs. Some top singles off the album are Thuggin and Harolds.

1961,"Man would it send chills down my spine if all of a sudden, at around 10:00pm, Sir Paul just sits down and begins playing the notes of Runaway. Kanye coming out for Sir Paul would quite literally be legendary, but it's fairly unlikely. The people that go for Paul arent really there for a rapper like Kanye to come out. I would hope not, but I would fear that hed be booed at if he did come out. There will be plenty of older folk who are there for the Beatles rock, not new-age hip hop. Still, a man can dream.

EDIT: Just checked, Odesza now also has an hour long set, as opposed to just 45 minutes like before. Fuck yes. This is great news.",2015-06-19 02:16:33+00:00,csbfx4z,1.0,t3_3aat21,35635.0,Lollapalooza

1968,"My comment is meant to shes light on how stereotypical and how linear a suburban white male's hip hop collection is. Its annoying when someone (like myself) wants to discuss hip hop and all someone knows is the Six above. Be different people. Explore new artists. And especially don't look at people like Donald Glover as a savior to Hip Hop, because he's not. ",2015-06-17 12:52:48+00:00,cs9hob2,5.0,t1_cs9b0re,23637.0,AskReddit

1971,"No they aren't. Especially not ""more than most."" Deep is Mos Def, GZA, Mobb Deep, Nas, Mick Jenkins, Bugzy Malone. Hell, even Danny Brown or Jay Rock are deeper than the Suburban Six. You just can only understand the Six, so therefore you think its deeper or has meaning. Gambino is one of the most empty artists out there.

1972,"True, Drake is a suburban rapper, however hes only features from time to time. Kinda like Q on an A$AP track. Hes always on a project and hes always involved, but hes not A$AP. 

I didnt put him on there because guys nowadays need a popular rapper to ""be above."" Lots of suburbanites dont like drake because they need to make their rap listening more unique and therefore diversified, to which (because hes a radio hit) they remove drake.

All of the rest looked amazing on the stream. Cannot fucking wait for this year. Thanks for the input!

As a side note, whats your problem with SZA? She looked like she killed it! ",2015-06-16 06:05:05+00:00,cs83wr1,1.0,t3_39wwre,58630.0,pitchforkfest
