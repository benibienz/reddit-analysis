-University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign for Electrical Engineering
-Indiana University for Finance
-The Ohio State University for Finance

I am 100% Undecided. I do prefer UIUC as a campus however, and I already know what dorm/roommate Id have. I also know quite a few people at UIUC, being in-state and all.

I think EE is too hard for me. In fact, I would already be planning for how I would escape when I start to drown. Im in a CS class right now in High school and its way too hard for me to get conceptually. I also only kinda like regular Physics right now. I kinda get it, and its fairly interesting I guess. Im also in an AP Macro econ class and I kinda like that. To be honest my favorite senior year class is Statistics.

I'm also concerned that Ill start to hate myself in the long run if I go the Finance route. However the workload for a Finance major is MUCH, MUCH more enticing. I can be successful in Finance. Im pretty sure I wont even crack the top 50% if I did EE. 

MIS is a wildcard that I didn't really consider until literally today. 

I have no passion for any of these things. I guess if anything I like to work with physical hardware, like wiring and amps and shit. Im an avid music listener, so being able to listen to music on the job would be a huge plus. Of course I would like some ability to move up in a company. 

Im pretty charismatic and I can be very social/good to talk to, however I am slightly introversive. I don't think I fit into the Finance stereotype at all, but at the same time I don't think I do the engineering either. I'm Kind've a hipster coffee shop guy if that makes it easy. 

I would rather lean on the mathematical/Technological side of things in STEM. Im pretty adventurous and Id like for the ability to travel, either through work or vacation days. In the same vein, I don't want to work 12 hour days, 5 days a week.

So I was accepted into both programs, and as an in-stater for Illinois, both schools will cost the same (Illinois is actually $1k more). I have always been undecided about my major. I like statistics I guess, and macro is kinda fun. I also find physics fascinating, except I've never actually taken an AP Physics course. 

Argument for Finance at IU:


-I think I slightly prefer it as a major

-I think I would get along with the classmates better

-I could easily see my self being a finance guy in the future

-Its an easier degree and even easier program

-I feel like I would succeed in Finance

-My best skill as a person is greeting others and interacting with adults. I love it.

Cons:


-All of the basic people at my school go to IU

-No engineering at IU, so if I had a change in heart I would have to transfer schools

-Kelley kids seem to be... pretentious. Not bad but seems like it would get old.

-Finance sounds good now, but I worry over time I will think turn to self-deprecation over contributing nothing too meaningful to the world (which I feel like I wouldn't feel in any other degree).

Pro's for Illinois EE:

-Some of my best friends are at/going to Illinois. 

-I've already found a roommate and I know what dorm I want to stay in. My roommate is awesome.

-The Engineering department there is internationally ranked as one of the best in the world (whereas Kelley is 
slightly lower). The prestige is real and I'm very proud of myself for getting accepted.

-I liked our circuitry unit in physics (I like make light go flash).

-I appreciate the mindset I would have leaving college (you engineers know what I'm talking about).

-I can always get a masters in business.

-I can always transfer to Finance at U of I, despite it being ranked only okay-ly.



Cons:

-I'm terrified that it will be too difficult for me (again, I'm in regular physics right now, so I don't know what the full 
power of a full blown science major would entail).

-I don't know shit about engineering. Never explored it before.

-I'm concerned that I will turn into a shut-in, and I want to be able to experience college in it's entirety. I am fully 
okay with accepting that college will be the best years of my life, so sacrificing those years to study all weekend long every weekend will do more damage to me emotionally and personally than good.

-EE is super fucking hard.

-Illinois kinda sucks, but I also know it well so I would feel most at home there (especially since I already know the dorm I'm applying to and found a roommate).

-I'm not really a nerdy guy. I know it's a stereotype, but I don't think Id fit particularly well with that.


So, thoughts? I'm so torn. My dad mentioned that I could always go to Illinois and if I need to drop I can drop to finance, but I can start in engineering just to see what its like. I do like the sound of that, but then I think of how it would've been better if I had just gone to Kelley in the first place, since its a higher ranked program. I'd be more than willing to give engineering a try, I just don't want to sacrifice too much for it if I decide I need to switch to finance.

""Hey guys. I know big question but I'm so stuck I don't know what to do. Im from Illinois. I have no clue what I want to do (all I know is I fucking LOVE listening to music and going to festivals). Because of this, my main default turned into Finance. I got into Indiana University, Ohio State University, and University of Iowa for business. Both all cost about the same, roughly $30k.

I know nothing about engineering. I'm in regular physics. Im not trying to humble brag here; I am legitimately scared that I am no match for this degree. 

Honestly I just want to get away. I don't want to go too far, but far enough where I can be isolated from the people I know right now. OSU, UMich, places that are far-ish. I just don't know. Above all else, I want to be happy. I don't want to go to U of I and be destroyed by a degree Im not prepared for nor do I even know if I like. I also don't want to go to a place like Indiana and join the swarms of pretentious North Shore kids who got in because their daddy's cover their cost of living. I haven't visited OSU yet so it's hard for me to determine if I like it, but from a statistical standpoint it seems like my other two options may be better? All cost roughly the same for me (with UIUC costing the most, OSU the least). 

I'm just torn. I want to have fun in college and meet cool people. I just don't know what the best option for me is. Only thing Im certain of is my uncertainty.

Strangely, I decided to apply in-state to the University of Illinois for engineering, basically because I knew I'd get denied and I hate my in-state school so I didn't care. Turns out, they accepted me into their Electrical Engineering. K.

I know nothing about engineering. I'm in regular physics. Im not trying to humble brag here; I am legitimately scared that I am no match for this degree. 

Honestly I just want to get away. I don't want to go too far, but far enough where I can be isolated from the people I know right now. OSU, UMich, places that are far-ish. I just don't know. Above all else, I want to be happy. I don't want to go to U of I and be destroyed by a degree Im not prepared for nor do I even know of I like. I also don't want to go to a place like Indiana and join the swarms of pretentious North Shore kids who got in because their daddy's cover their cost of living. I don't know if its too late to apply to other schools. 

I'm just torn. I want to have fun in college and meet cool people. I just don't know what the best option for me is. ",makemychoice,Where to go to college?,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/4ca902/where_to_go_to_college/

Before going to college, we've all decided to save up some money to go on a roadtrip extravaganza this summer. For now, all we know is that we'd like to go down to Central Illinois and cut across the US vertically, going all the way to the coast, taking highway 101 from Oregon to Cali, then coming back up from Texas. We may flip the order, so start going to Texas and go from there, but we think that route will cover most of the places we want to see.

We are in the kind of mood to pack up our 04 Highlander and just drive West, but we understand that probably isn't the smartest idea. Anyone have similar experience to just ""driving off?"" No booked hotels, no set destination, no set route planned? We will most likely plan out the whole trip beforehand, but we kind of like entertaining the thought of just heading west. 

Another thing is where to sleep each night. It seems like our options are car, hotel, or camping out, or a mixture of all. We've been wanting to go camping for a while now. Should we just save the camping for another trip for a different time? Will bringing camping gear, etc. be too much shit to bring (theres three of us).

As for destinations, we are still in the early phases of thinking things through. We've talked about Portland, Zion, Highway 101, highway 1, etc, but with no map yet we are unsure. 

So thoughts? Advice? Recommendations for locations? I'm sorry if our plan sounds vague (because it is right now), were in the early stages of all this. 

One last thing to note, we appreciate some of the subtler things like nice landscapes, interesting little towns, etc. we don't have to go to a national park every day. In fact wed probably rather only go to one or possibly two.

I was kinda new but knew how to operate everything/what it felt like, and both of my friends were new. I smoke up my one friend, lets call him Eric. Eric goes inside, and I smoke up my other friend. Were about to go inside when we hear Eric making noises and freaking out. We rush in, realize he's tweaking and leave the house to get in the car (parked in the driveway) we sat in the car to calm him down, but he was pretty fucked up, sating shit like ""MY EYES ARE FLASHING I FEEL A TINGLING WTF MAN WTF"" and so we comforted him. After about 20 minutes he calmed down. 

Afterwards, he started going to therapy. What he realized is that he has severe anxiety, and it didnt show its real ugly head until that panic attack during the high. He has since gotten medication, practiced techniques to lower his anxiety, he now can combat panic attacks pretty well (which he rarely gets, but does on occasion if he's under intense stress). Basically the high just did something to him that would've happened later on regardless, so he got help and he's much better now. He drinks, smokes cigars, etc, but hasnt smoked since. Hes been around it, but never hit it.

So tonight he tells me he wants to try it again. He says he will take an anxiety pill beforehand, then he will use his calming tactics if he panics. He also said that he wants to do this because he wants to have a good high that will allow him to get over that first time. He seemed confident he could do it, so long as there was a good environment with only his closest friends. Hes also matured since then.

So my question is, should we smoke again? Ive obviously gotten used to smoking so Im comfortable with it, but is it a bad idea to smoke him up? And if it isnt and I should smoke him up, any advice on how to approach it? Thanks you!",trees,[Advice Needed] My friends first time resulted in a terrible panic attack. He wants to try it again.

Hearing, to me, what sounded like a trippy graveyard of vocals and intruments, I was actually kinda entranced for a bit to the song playing on his speakers. The song was Little by Little, and after a while of just hanging around and listening to what he was playing, I heard Lotus Flower, another track that felt half like a nightmare. I loved it. He showed me it was King of Limbs that I was listening to, by Radiohead. Afterwards I listened to that album for a while, and a year or so later I tried diving into Radiohead. Creep, Fake Plastic Trees, Karma Police, Paranoid Android, Idioteque, and a couple attempts at listening to Kid A that ultimately failed about two songs in. To be honest, King of Limbs had a vibe to it that I adored, and I can pick it up in earlier works, but its hard to replicate to me for whatever reason. I know that's witch talk to Radiohead fans, but it's how I actually feel. This is why I'm here, because I need some guidance. Ive listened to Kid A again, and I *love* the opener and the two-three track run that leads up to Idioteque (my favorite Radiohead song so far) but it just doesn't do much for me as a whole. I've stopped at idiotque every time. My most recent attempt was listening to In Rainbows, which was a tad bit more successful than Kid A. A couple songs jumped out immediately that I like, such as Bodysnatchers, Reckoner, Weird Fish/Arpeggi (what the fuck is this song even about?), and House of Cards. I like the closer too. Overall I can actually listen to this album front to back, whereas in Kid A I have to skip tracks (for whatever fucking reason). Is Kid A like To Pimp a Butterfly, where it's a great experience even listening to the whole thing, but is kindve scattered when listening track-by-track? (and that is coming from the world's biggest Kendrick stan, folks). I have yet to listen to OK Computer, Amnesiac, The Bends (outside of the hits), nor Hail to the Thief. I just don't know where to go or how to glide in to their discog smoothly. I've started on King of Limbs, good or bad, and I've tried going from there but it hasn't seem to have ""clicked"" yet. I love the sound on KOL, but where do I go from here? Thank you guys for your patience/time, and please excuse my ignorance. 

**EDIT:** Nevermind this post. Just listened to Kid A fully through, and my God it fucking clicked.

As Lolla hype begins to churn, people start spamming this (albeit already quite inactive) subreddit with posts asking if ""theres a chance so-so will play."" 

Yes, there is a chance. If you want to investigate further, you can ask yourself these three questions:

1. Is so-so releasing an album this year? If so, will they be touring it?

2. If they are on tour, do they have space on their tour to play the weekend of July 29th-Aug1st?

3. Have they played in years past, and how recently?

If the answer to 1 and 2 is yes, then congratulations! Your favorite band has a good chance of getting swept up by Livenation for the masses at Grant Park! If the answer to 3 was yes, use your best judgment. Livenation, despite fan complaints, tries to mix its bag of artists up every year. If Florence and the Machine played Lolla 3 out of the past 5 years, we can probably assume their chances of playing again this year will be diminished. 

Secondly, be sure to take in to consideration the radius clause for other local festivals in the summertime. A good indicator of who absolutely will NOT be on the Lollapalooza lineup is the Pitchfork Fest lineup, which comes out early February. Due to the radius clause, no artist may play more than one festival in the city of Chicago under a certain length of time (I forgot the specific time). If Radiohead is playing Pitchfork, they wont be at Lolla, and vice versa. This should also be taken in to consideration when looking at the interests of other festivals. Pitchfork will most likely go for lesser known/more highly renowned artists such as Animal Collective, due to their role as indie reviewing megalith. Northcoast will attempt to pick up a handful of EDM artists and Funk. Riot Fest will aim for punk, rock, and a couple rap groups. Lolla aims for, well everything. It all just comes down to who wants the artist more and who can pay more. 

Finally, understand that Lollapalooza is pretty good at keeping secrets. Paul McCartney/Metallica was a surprise to just about everyone last year, up until the day before. Right now, we already know Bonnaroo's headliners and we knew Coachella's three months ago. We have no info on Lolla just yet. In time, rumors will come. Some will be accepted, some will be denied. Some will be true, but most will be false.

My setup is USB/Optical (computer and ps4) -&gt; Maverick Tubemagic d1 plus Amp/DAC -&gt; HD600s. While tuned to Optical or USB, if I move the cable Near the line out port, I experience a static noise. The same happens if I twist. If I twist enough, I will also just outright lose audio in one or both of my ears. It just pops off. I can get it back by twisting until I have audio in both, but otherwise Its finicky. I should mention that the Line In port just doesn't fucking work. The static is way too bad to listen to. I tried swapping cables and it didn't change anything. I have yet to change the USB or Optica cabling running to my Laptop/Ps4, but I figured that shouldn't make a difference since I experience it from both sources. Ive had the amp/dac for a year now and Ive noticed it since about two weeks after I got it, but I never did anything about it for whatever fucking reason. Just recently I've picked back up the cans, and its since really started to bother me. I tried out my buddies Schiit Stack today, and while I preferred the separation on my Tubemagic, there was never any issues with static/losing sound on his amp/dac. 

If this requires me to get a new amp/dac, what would y'all recommend for a below $250 budget? I use it mostly for music on my macbook but also for gaming pretty heavily. Thanks guys.

His big homecoming. His grand finale to his tour. And so to prepare for it I bout the meet and greet pass so I could meet Mick and The Mind. Granted I live 1 and a half hours away from the Metro, so I got ready for a 6:30arrival (it said on the site that doors open at 7, but i wanted to be early just in case. So Im getting ready when an email comes up telling me to be there by 5 or else I miss it the meet and greet. 10 minutes later and you miss it. What. 

I emailed support, and they didn't help. So I curse a bunch, broil in my own anger on the way there, then when I get there at 6 the dude tells me it was moving to after the show. Okay fine, Ill go eat then come back. I get back at 7 when the doors open, and guess what? Meet and greet started at 6:30. And even if you somehow arrived at that time for it, only 25 people were allowed in, regardless if you bought it. There were a ton of people who didn't get in because of that cap, which was never announced to us prior. 

So I was fed false info several times, bought a ticket that had a small chance of actually allowing me to meet Mick and his crew, and missed the chance to meet the Free Nation crew themselves, all because of complete disorganization by Metro. I don't give af about the picture or whatever, I just wanted to meet him and hopefully get my poster signed. Nope, couldn't even do that. Paid an extra $30 for nothing. 

This was so disappointing. Mick really fucking brought it tonight and even called out the venue for only letting 25 people in, but there was nothing he could do. On top of this, security was way too aggressive over people smoking. Every Time a lighter sparked a security guy pushed his way to that guy and pulled him out, probably kicking him out. The fucking dj was smoking a blunt and these guys were booting people for smoking after Mick just got done talking about bud. Like I get the regulations, but maybe you should just get more guys to search for shit when coming in, instead of booting guys mid show.

So overall, great concert. Mick brought out Noname and the crowd was just nuts to Waters and Jazz, but holy fuck did the rest of the bullshit ruin my night. Really wish I could've at least gotten the merch, just so I got something more out of my premium ticket price.

Thank you everyone for looking at my stats. I appreciate your help. So, what are my chances?

**Demographics:** White middle class in a suburban town in Illinois. I go to a pretty big highschool (graduating class size is 500) thats also very highly ranked and pretty competitive. No class rank is available. My parents are divorced and I live with my mother, who is a nurse and only graduated a nursing school. Something else worth mentioning, I am a type 1 diabetic, and have been since I was 10.

**Intended Majors:** Finance, Minor in Comp Sci

**ACT:** 
ACT Composite: 32
English: 36
Reading: 34
Math: 31
Science: 30 (taken on a diff day)
Writing: 9
Combined: 33

**SAT:** Nope

**SAT II:** Nada

**Class rank:** Not Available

**UW/W GPA:** 3.75/4.11 (standard system, APs are 5.00s, regular are 4.00s, etc.)

**Coursework:** Highest levels of Lit/History all four years, AP Euro (5), APUSH (5), AP Lang (4). Senior year schedule: AP Stats, Pre Calc, Physics, AP Comp Sci, AP Gov, AP Econ, Scifi/Lit. 

**Awards:** I recieved a National Spanish Honors winner award for doing well on the national test. Im also in honor roll every semester. Other than that, nothing really. I qualified for NHS, however I didnt do it because they stated right away that it didn't help your app at all and at the time I was busy on my Eagle Project. Is that true? I could always reapply. Should I?

**Extracurriculars:** 

-JV Tennis freshman year

-Cross Country 10th-12th (with being a captain as a senior this year)

-Like, 700 hours+ for dedicating two full summers to volunteering at a local Bike Camp as a Counselor (not paid, 
volunteer) 9th-10th

-Job as a paid counselor at said camp, in which I lead a group of 20 adolescents around the area on trails/to parks. I watch them for the day, every day, all summer long. 

-Job as a Winter Lodge manager for our sledding hill. I manage the lodge alone all day and watch the sledders for injuries/offer hospitality. This is all winter long (after school/weekends).

-Eagle Scout in my local troop. My project was collecting bikes and shipping them to South America. I am also an Ordeal OA member.

-No clubs really. My summers/winters went to work, and my fall/spring went to XC and Boy Scouts. Pretty straight forward. Busy all year long.

-I'm a mod for a couple of subreddits. Think that's worthy of being put down on the app?

**Schools:** University of Michigan (Primary Target), University of Illinois, University of Indiana, University of Wisconsin, Madison, University of Iowa (safety), Indiana University (safe), Norte Dame (reach, obviously). 

Quick note: I took courses my freshman year that were not at my level. Instead of taking Geometry and Chem my sophmore year, I took algebra 1 and Earth Science. This was in part because my mother didnt know the importance of taking higher level courses. She wanted me on the average course lane, which was way too easy for my abilities. My father was also not really in the picture much, so he didnt push me to do anything either. I didnt realize that I dont belong in the regular class until sophmore year when I took my first AP class. This is why I am in regular phys and precalc, and also why I am taking ap stats and ap comp sci this year: to make up for it. I will include this on my common app. 

I think my essay is pretty good. My ap lang teacher gave me a perfect score on it. Basically it's about how I us my music listening tastes to describe myself, instead of things like my setbacks or my diabetes.

**Questions**

-Should I go to a couple clubs this year, now that I have time? Will that factor anything for my app, if I attend, say, Athletes Dedicated to Excellence Club? 

-What are some grouping ideas for a white kid in a suburban town? Is it more important to be creative or to have a important group of which you belong? 

-I am already slightly intimidated by my senior schedule. DO you think I need to take AP Physics my senior year instead of regular? Does that really affect my app/bring it down? Also, I dropped AP Lit for two easy lit courses because I am taking other high level Math APs. Will that look bad? I can't take all APs, I would be too busy and overloaded. Basically, what I am asking is: Is my schedule for senior year good enough?

That's basically it. So, what do you think my chances are, especially for UM? Good? Fair? Poor? Any recommendations to spice up my app? Thanks everyone! I really do appreciate it. Obviously this is a very anxious time in life, so all your help and support is appreciated. Good luck to everyone admitting this fall.

I can also talk to adults and professionals/co-workers very well, and even make friends pretty quickly. Im starting to apply to Big Ten schools here in the midwest, and I cant decide on a school I want to focus on because I cant decide what degree I want to go into. I legitimately have no clue what I enjoy. I am really good at english, writing, and history, however none of those are subjects I would want to pursue a career in (history major..... Oh dear). This year I am taking AP Comp Sci and AP Macro Econ courses, however both are second semester and I need to apply before then. Id like to go to whatever school is best for whatever degree I want to pursue, so this is important to me. So far I am looking at three degrees: Finance, Computer Science, or some sort of Engineer. I am not familiar with many other degrees tbh, however I know Finance and Comp Sci degrees are needed and paid well for. I dont have any interests that could bleed into a degree either, which makes things even more difficult.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Are there other degrees that I could look at, that involve working with people and are booming jobs? I would like to use my intelligence to its furthest potential, so I don't want to pick a major that comes too easy to me. I want to be able to use everything in my arsenal. 

Thank you guys. Finance/CS majors, care to chime in? I dont necessarily LOVE math, however Ive never taken an advanced math class so the classes have been easy and Ive never been challenged.

So my question: Does anyone here have any footage of the concert/jumbo tron/ of the right side of the show? Specifically, maybe during i or in between any tracks? 

I know Its a long shot but my goal is to find someone that has a video of the moment he came over and touched the crowd during/after i. Thanks guys.

I love festivals because I love to be around people that have as deep of an appreciation for music as I do, and of course the shared love and friendliness with one another. I spent my weekend watching the Roo stream and reading up on how it all went, and it really got me thinking: Does Lollapalooza ""suck?"" 

It seems like everywhere I go, I see people complaining about the festival. ""Too many kids."" ""Too many partiers that  aren't here for the music!"" ""Too crowded!"" ""The crowd sucks!"" ""People suck!"" ""These stages suck!""

So lets all take a moment and be honest. Compared to Bonnaroo, for example, is Lolla bad? Are the crowds terrible? Are people rude? Is it all kids who think their hot shit and who just go to snapchat themselves? Are most people just there for the party, and not the love/music?  I love everything Bonnaroo stands for, of which is the exact opposite of these questions. I love maturity in people around me. I love going to artists like SZA and screaming out lyrics with people around. I want to have no issues chatting with folk and having a good time overall. But everything I've read/heard about Lolla makes me question it.

So my final question is, if the above is all true, how should I go about avoiding/looking past these nuances? Nothing pisses me off more than kids pushing me out of the way to get to the front, or teen girls taking a million selfies in front of every fucking sign, or folks who have no part in wanting to talk or communicate with you, or bro-douches who don't give a fuck if you cant see. I know Roo is a different festival and a different experience overall, but is it really the heaven to the Lolla hell? Thats what my worst fears are telling me. 

Thanks guys. Id love some civil discussion over this. ",Lollapalooza,"This is my first year going, but all I'm picking up on so far is negative vibes. Lets all be honest here: Does Lolla suck?",http://www.reddit.com/r/Lollapalooza/comments/3a0dqj/this_is_my_first_year_going_but_all_im_picking_up/
