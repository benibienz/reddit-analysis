While I have to agree on the playlist part, the map thing isn't as bad. The re-tweaked versions do rustle my jimmies a little bit, but at least they're easy to get used to. The community-made maps part is what I really didn't understand. Sure, they're not made by 343i, no input from them or anything, non of their effort. *But,* they're made **by the community,** meaning they know what's imbalanced, stupid, or just impractical, and avoid and counter them with quality maps. The new Forge also allows you to make maps with such an extreme precision that they could almost be considered official maps.

Also, I would understand your frustration with adding maps more if the DLC was behind a paywall, but it isn't. The DLC is free and just requires a small download. While I agree that most should have been in there from the start, and it's pretty disappointing that it wasn't, it's not truly the end of the world if it gets added in. The maps are pretty high quality (for the most part) and getting more for free isn't such a bad thing.

So, in the end, you have valid points, and I understand where you're coming from. I know that nothing I say can *truly* change your mind, but there are some things you could look over twice.
