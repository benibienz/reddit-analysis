It's no wonder everyone is so cold here! it's like living in the TV show ""The walking dead"" it's awful. Oh and I've noticed that most artists from Canada come from Toronto and Montreal and it's not so stifling to them either! here, it's so god damn conservative that it's only okay to be a freaking concert pianist or classic cellist or something otherwise you are a horrible person. 

I feel like living here, all my youthful energy and life has been wasted and I've just been running in a circle! at least I'm sure, it's more tolerant of diversity and people treat/talk to you like a human being or something geesh.

ANYWAY, but on the contrary it seems like many people just back down and think that whatever they do will not make any difference or have any effect.

Where I live for example, the real estate is far beyond affordable for regular or working people and many are being pushed out of town, with as well most people expecting you to meet some narrow criteria of ""perfection"" such as having a freaking masters degree or something right out of highschool and a high paying job. 

People always look down on those who may be homeless or low income and often turn the blame around entirely on the individual but never look at the socio-economic variables or environment that the person exists in; but if you try and even approach or speak about the topic the blame is always turned completely around on them. (as everyone knows and is I am sure very well versed and aware of) whilst, there are probably not enough well paying jobs or positions even available for people to eek out a living for themselves and meanwhile things like social assistance are completely demonized and treated like the scourge of the land.

Again, I guess the whole point too is that, no one is doing ""rock"" music anymore and it's what I grew up with and (or grew up that way) along with the fact that I would not want to cater to what's ""popular"" right now, kind of on purpose. I want to jar people a bit. I can recall bands like ""Pup"" but even then, it's a punk band that's really good but indie and I just like music like that. Rilo Kiley...The Shins...The Replacements...Julian Cassablanca and The Voidz, The Joy Formidable, Grimes, Jake Bugg, Queens of the Stone Age,  Interpol, Tegan and Sara (wut? too soft) I love St. Vincent, Chelsea Wolfe...Broken Social Scene....Kurt Vile, Arcade Fire, Animal Collective...Tallest man in the World, Surfan Stevens, Brand New, et cetera, et cetera, Neutral Milk Hotel....yeah...just not me : /",2016-06-29 07:25:11+00:00,d4sak2l,,t1_d4ojyxd,,Music

I think that's what they should do with their next album. Go less ""pop"" but then, I feel like for some reason they can't. They're a little stuck in ""sticking it to the man slightly while.....BEING SALESMEN ALL THE WAY AND MAKE REALLY CATCHY POP ROCK MUSIC, YEAH!"" lol ",2016-06-29 07:24:11+00:00,d4sajdt,,t1_d4oj1vm,,Music

I was thinking about it and I just want to do these bands cuz I don't feel comfortable playing or singing music that is too vulnerable yet, for some reason. It just makes me really uncomfortable. I still cannot really think of that many new/young and relevant ""rock"" bands that are out though, lol. What is there now that's supposed to be in that position? ""Bring me the Horizon"" ?

I know of other bands, but they're not full on ""rock"" bands lol. Plus, they are ""mainstream"" and enjoyable and liked by a wide range of people from different backgrounds whilst still having kind of an 'edge' to them, which would make them suitable for busking I think (if you were to cover) Honestly though, PRACTICALLY EVERYONE, only busks and covers 60's, 70's music. (because it's the ""thing"" now for the last how many decades? lol)

Or I just hear ""singer/songwriter""sensitive/soulful and deep, (with slight pegan imagery perhaps) unplugged folksy kinda stuff, or gritty hardcore punk stuff (on acoustic, those street kids lol) (But I really like Bob Dylan, I'd like to do lots of Bob Dylan if that's possible) But bands like Incubus totally show their age I think.

43,"Well no, not necessarily, Sonic Youth is much more innovative and creative, but some of the musicianship is a bit better in some aspects I would almost say. At least as far as the guitarist goes, Gerard's not that great at singing. Some of their music is kind of garish. (I think that's kind of the point though, they have a very punk rock aesthetic, and much of their music is like seriously freaking sarcastic and angry) 

Yeah but see? indie-cred over artists that are mainstream at all, it's not ""cool"" or ""proper"" to say such things. I'm don't have all that much classical training but I still feel confident in saying that.

Yes, ""Sonic Youth"" the one band no one shall ever even remotely express ""criticism"" for. But I guess it really depends in what way, and what style of music it is. But still even then, Kim and Thurston just like, whisper in raspy voices trying to sound vaguely like Velvet Underground, the most untouchable indie-""cool"" band EVER. EVAR. 

*rolls-eye* Seriously, the ""Cool"" factor is a bit too much for me. I like/and think that sometimes indie and punk rock should just be really authentic. Well, I think the best music is authentic, but they're still really good, I love Sonic Youth and  Velvet Underground, etc. I know I'm supposed to like bands like SY and, VU more but I really like bands like MCR, Muse, and Greenday still. (oh and Radiohead, Deftones, etc) I know a lot people don't realize it, but the members of Greenday are actually a pretty technically proficient band, and they can actually play more technically complex music but choose not to...because...they prefer playing punk music.

The thing is, a lot of ""indie"" music doesn't have as much edge though, and even though this music isn't as extreme as a lot of metal bands it's a good thing because it's still slightly pleasant or tolerable to a larger range or a diverse audience. 

Plus a lot of indie bands aren't as good at their instruments : /
(but that's sort of the point isn't it?)

Like, I like bands like Sonic Youth a lot, but honestly after getting a lot well versed in music and getting better at singing/playing I've actually started to like the bands like I listed above because they're actually really good at their crafts and even though it's ""cool"" to hate music that's mainstream or not independent at all, there's a high quality of work at times that goes into their music, the production level etc...

I mean yeah, Band of Horses, Band of Skulls, Opeth, (all those ""indie"" metal bands with the screaming raspy vocals) and a whole host of others I cannot think of at the moment.

Walter obviously did care. I mean, look at how upset he was when Hank died? or when Jesse's girlfriend died. 

Look at how much he tried to go out of his way and protect Jesse, to which he obviously did care about him.

He really showed all of the signs of a junkie, too.

I think that was the whole point. 
Thought he was not one himself, his personality completely changed, and turned into someone else entirely. 

He supplied the addicts with all of the drugs they wanted, and they in return too with all of the money, and riches he always dreamed of. They really had quite a symbiotic relationship that could only really sustain each other. 

Maybe the point was that addiction takes many forms, and that it effects everyone involved.

It's great though, I finally found some social groups for people with disabilities, and I'm just going to go to them. I'm sick of being judged for not having my life as together, and then treated like somehow it's my fault, or that somehow I am some kind of a fucking oddity.

Here's something I sort of just thought to myself. 

A truly individual person, looks and holds themselves to what they decide is morally and ethically a virtuous, and noble path to walk in life. Of course, this may not be noble, or ethical in the eyes of others, in fact perhaps they are immoral.  But still, alone for themselves they have come upon and decided this for themselves, despite outside opinions and pressures of the group. 

Nothing is anything but what we decide on for ourselves. Those who lack strength, desire, or the awareness; most often do not rise above the collective, or group. They simply allow the standards and bars to be set for them by others, and by the experiences they have in relation to the others. 

If you're one of those individuals who has let themselves have their standards, and thous outlook shaped too much or completely by the collective, you resist the attempt or react with hostility or anger, because it's an idea that you resist out of necessity, or convenience. 

Which also ironically, just further cements whatever the status quo of the group is, in place. 


If you were truly of your own thoughts, opinions, and beliefs; talking about, or discussing them most often wouldn't substantially upset or be off limits. You would have yourself, already have gone over and through them many times as it is, and are familiar, and understanding of the process. 


The opposite is dogma.

""While giant pharmaceutical corporations promote psychiatry’s authority as a vehicle for increased drug sales, the whole of the corporate state supports psychiatry so as to maintain the status quo. In the old Soviet Union, political dissidents were diagnosed by psychiatrists as mentally ill, then hospitalized and drugged. Even more effective for those at the top of the hierarchy is what now occurs in the United States: diagnosing and treating anti-authoritarians before they have reached political consciousness and before they have created communities of 
resistance.

One reason that there is so little political activism in the United States is that a potentially huge army of anti-authoritarians are being depoliticized by mental illness diagnoses and by attributions that their inattention, anger, anxiety, and despair are caused by defective biochemistry, not by their alienation from a dehumanizing society.

You seriously have not noticed this? 



This question for me was mostly sparked by the book ""Outliers"" by Gladwell Maxwelll; and in it, he discusses the role of class quite frequently in the book, and how it comes into play the different outcomes of individual lives. 

In it he said that something about how generally those from middle class families and higher know how to utilize the system in play and effectively play ""the game"" as he refereed to it as, whereas the ones who are from more lower socioeconomic rungs often do not and are in fact mistrustful of authority often times. Those from more well off families typically know how to navigate the social institutions that exist in our society, and get the most of them, but also to achieve the goals they want. 


BUT, he said that lower/working class kids generally grow up being more independent, self reliant, imaginative, and tougher. 

But he never really delved anymore into that aspect, or any aspect o the working class much more. 

He basically left it at what would seem to be that ""playing the game"" is always the best path to take in life, and one should always strive for that. He almost made it out as though they have infinitely better lives and are not just simply more 'financially secure'

That, and I often experience that in regular life too. The greatest thing anyone could possibly work towards or achieve is moving up the social hierarchy sort to speak, and I had wondered why.


I had wondered if we will always have social structures and hierarchies that exist in this way, and if it is an inevitable part of human nature that would be to ignore or not want to partake in would be outright foolish. 
There are many who would cite the negative effects it has on health to be a 'workaholic' or to put too much emphasis becoming 'successful' but I wondering if perhaps that's just naive. Even in the book and in our lives, though. What is it that we are even defining as 'success' in the first place?

I was recently seeing a therapist because I have been feeling somewhat frustrated and unhappy with my life, as well as other things; but upon seeing them for a few sessions then seemed to just quickly turn into her arguing and getting offended over most of what I was saying (even though most of it was just neutral, and was not even claiming to be 100%  right on what I WAS saying) and as well not really being able to follow what I was saying, or the points I was trying to make. 

She eventually got so frustrated that she told me she can't work with me. 

So now I don't really know what to do. I told her a theory that I felt related to my current situation and what I am experiencing, and how I think it fits, and she just outright after I finished said: ""what is with all of this shit? what is really bothering you. What is REALLY bothering you""

When that's what I was trying to explain in the first place, and was the reason I even brought up that theory in the first place...(it was not scientific, it was human-behavior related)

Whether or not I do posses the intellectual capabilites to fit into this catergory, I find that alone I seem to posses the personality traits, so what would that mean? 

I have always been very different, and I know that upon reading about ""giftedness"" there is usually at least some summary on how often they are misunderstood, and how often the traits themselves that go along with it are confused for some form of neurosis and often invalidated. 


I have had many experiences with this, and find that on average, most people think that I am very strange. 

I know that my family thought that there was something wrong with me, and I don't think we could ever really quite communicate with each other. I seemed to really only cause pain and frustration for them. 

I think without ever fully saying it, they had always just wanted me to be a ""normal"" child, yet despite tests being done on me, they could never really pinpoint or find anything wrong with me. 

I think one of the things for example is that I was always very curious, energetic, imaginative, and driven. 

But to my parents, I simply wore them out, and seemed to always want something new to do, or had more things to ask. I would always bring up and talk about so many things they would just find downright odd and peculiar. To them I suppose life was quite simple. I was not...


Actually it was so bad at times I was almost put into foster care, and would have periodic visits from social workers to see how things were going.

Which is also I think, trying to look almost realistically at what would happen if real life gigantic robot tanks were ever created, to which are of course actually giant Mechs; or will become them, which are of course always featured in animes and mangas. 


Maybe if they set the game in the future, it would take place in a world where Metal Gears are actually common place, or perhaps, where they have full on giant robotic Mechs fighting war all over. But 4 already did that I think, so I'm not really sure. Just a progression of that..?

I imagine if they make future titles, it will follow perhaps young Snake and his adventures, or maybe introduce new characters all together, but I just can't really see the story or game setting really be as good or the same way, which almost begs the question that if making anymore sequels at least set in the Metal Gear universe would really have much of a purpose at all, and if perhaps creating another series all together that is instead heavily influenced by them? 

I suppose they could just work in the established world he created, but I doubt they could really ever add anything that inventive or creative to them without Kojima himself.

I seriously can't just shut up and forget about it. It's a serious thing. I'm not joking, don't be a freaking dickhead.

364,"Also, do you think it's mostly an N vrs S thing? 

cuz, I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT

but I honestly find it next to impossible to find anyone I can really have conversations or talk with. Like, most people do not get me, or what I'm talking about half the time at all. In fact, I find most people just start to get weird-ed out by me, take offense, or don't understand. It's really bizarre. 


Like I said before, I don't just ""take things as they are"" hardly ever. 

I have my own way of looking at things, and the like; but instead, most people really sort of just ""do"" things, and that's sort of it. 

I think to most people I might as well just be an alien or something. 

Like when you're an INtuitive, what do you do? how do you find like minded people? it kind of frightens me to be honest. I am scared I will be alone for ever.

365,"Yeah, well it's just been very difficult for me to find places or people who I really get along well with or who at least you know, are nice to me. 

I have been used and mistreated throughout my life quite often. I have developed social anxiety because of this, so this is why I bothered to make this thread. I want to nip it in the butt and stop it from ever happening in the first place. 

I mean, just about every where I go I seem to run into that. I guess yeah, I used to think there was something wrong with being quite, thoughtful, and the like. I was drawn and hung out with the opposite of that because I somehow thought it was normal, or that there was something horribly wrong with me for being the way I was. 

But really it's mostly just...yeah, avoid that scene all together. I mean, it's like somehow for whatever reason, they are like sharks and they go out for my blood when I'm around those types of crowds. I don't know why, but certain types of people seem to really hate be, or are hell bent on trying to make me feel bad, or put me down and use me. 

It's really bizarre. 


It just seems like most of the world is pretty shallow, conceited and only out for themselves. It's quite frustrating. ",2015-09-06 06:48:08+00:00,cusa48i,6.0,t1_cus94ds,3322.0,infp

Like I'm being shoved off the plank or something. I have no family to run and hide behind, okay? it's really making my life difficult. 

Is this somehow a taboo question that no one really wants to honestly admit or answer? 

There was some site someone gave me a while ago with info on things like, estimations on what jobs and careers will be in demand in the near, or far off future...

but I forgot what it was. Come on, stuff like this? why can't anyone just say the god damn truth and cut all the bullshit for once for fuck sakes. ",2015-09-06 04:02:36+00:00,cus6lmw,1.0,t3_3jszzo,12986.0,Advice
367,"OKAY, IS THERE SERIOUSLY ANYTHING WRONG WITH ASKING THIS QUESTION!??? COULD SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY THEN!? I DON'T SEE WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.

ANYWAY, I have some idea of jobs I could do, the options just seem dizzying and staggering to me and I don't even know where to look or what to expect and look for.

Is there someone I can go to, to even ask for help? 



OKAY, what type of school should I go to? how much does it matter what kind of school you go to, how much does the name and reputation matter. How much does the degree you receive matter, etc. 


How much of a likely hood do you have of knowing if it will play off, or what your options are for the degree that you take, or would training you take. 

What do I do? and what are the odds, what choice of action do I take if I decide to forego school and decide to just find a job in something I like, and work up the ladder the old fashioned way? what are my odds of being hired/not being hired in relation to degrees?",2015-09-06 03:57:29+00:00,cus6gx4,1.0,t3_3jszzo,12679.0,Advice

Okay. Well, I don't really just mean ""MBTI"" type only, or even at all; just what kinds of person I guess. What do I need to look out for? I used to be against judging anyone by how they look or seem, but I am starting to think that perhaps it really ends up to mostly that. I think I am mostly meant for people who are generally sort of ""alternative"" looking on average...

As they would generally/or seem more often then to share my sentiments, etc. ",2015-09-06 03:51:17+00:00,cus6b9a,4.0,t1_cus61qf,618.0,infp
369,"only though on average? aren't we kinda rare? 

*sigh* 

What about those who aren't Fi doms? even like INTJ's. 

I have an INTJ friend who would get angry at me for not conforming, and seemed to hold Fe, and Fe-traits in high regard and often tried to apt them. I'm not this bIg WEiRdO who acts differently for the sake, or goes out of their way to prove how individual they are. But generally, I am polite, and well put together, clean, but slightly unique, and do not just conform outright to what social expectations or the environment I am in.

(or ENTJ's) 

Most often that is what I experience. People getting mad/angry at me, or not liking me because I'm not some kind of ""conformist"" or something, even though again I'm not that strange either. Ugh. 

So that's what? other INFP's, ENFP's, ESFP's, ISFP's...that's it? ",2015-09-06 02:50:32+00:00,cus4oq2,2.0,t1_cus3z74,1494.0,infp
370,"Okay, I just figured out what it is 

""keeping up with the joneses""


I think that's generally what I seem to encounter alot of the time. Like everyone is in the rat-race, all competing and I am just; ugh, who cares? ",2015-09-06 01:52:29+00:00,cus30xu,3.0,t1_cus2k4x,971.0,infp
371,"Thanks. 

Yeah, even meeting other N's it's been sort of difficult. 

Like I don't know what it is. I REALLY REALLY, DO see the world from the top down. Like, I'm not really someone who just 'experiences' things all that often, and even when I do, I am often to describe it in some weird dreamy way or something; not just factually and and in some kind of concrete way, like how it almost feels most people want. It's really frustrating. It's like how what I've come to term as ""the do's and did's"" and for whatever, it seems to be the way most people communicate which leaves me feeling sort of dry. Like I can't just think in an overly linear way, and go from step to step describing what and the ""DO'S"" in DOING it or something, you know? shit, I hate that kind of stuff. 

I actually DO quite a bit a fair amount of the time, but even then...it's not just for the end results, some number, or for monetary means. Like, I do not just simply live my life by monetary MEANS. You know? shit. 


I like to place music, I like to read, I love art, and MAKING ART, I love WRITING. I also occasionally like to watch movies/anime etc.

Sometimes I like to go hiking, or even play some sports. But I mean, okay, what else do people want from me? shit it just confuses me. It's like most people just do a bunch of random shit that seems to involve around spending obscene amounts of money ,and thus life is this 'status' competition to see who subtly has or does not have enough money, and you compete over who gets to do the most ""luxurious"" amount of things, or not. Either that, or they just fight, bicker, and get drunk. But to them, it's like, I don't know. They are the caveman superior, and they are like dogs running around marking their territories/defending off intruders, breeding or something. I DON'T KNOW, FUuFUfufuuufuf


Again, I am not trying to insult or put anyone down, or claim superiority; I am just really frustrated and fed up. ",2015-09-06 01:36:18+00:00,cus2k4x,2.0,t1_cus1l85,2012.0,infp

it's not just that I have to ask very many questions, often times I still am left not really having a clear idea of what to make of them because they supposedly ""don't have a camera"" or offer/show photos.""

I don't have unlimited time. ",2015-09-06 00:35:18+00:00,cus0sge,2.0,t1_cus0qp0,97.0,Advice

Yeah, I wonder about stuff like that. If it's just ""fine"" why is does it always seem like the MAIN place when there is a crime story on the news that it takes place in? I feel like when someone shrugs it off and says it's ""alright"" I really wonder if they just don't give a shit. Anyway, I'm going to go around a few areas anyway just to see what it's like.


The thing is, I sort of stand out too, and am not really a regular person, so I have to be careful with stuff like that. If it's in some kind of hateful intolerant place, odds are I'll probably get some attention on account of that. ",2015-09-04 21:10:33+00:00,cuqvq7e,2.0,t1_cuqvm2u,191.0,vancouver
