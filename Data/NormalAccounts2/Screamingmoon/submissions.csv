I am trying to stay to at least a majority vegetarian diet and I've looked into the topic and have become fairly knowledgeable and well read about it but I am having this continual problem where I cannot seem to keep weight on and keeping losing it or feeling kind of unsatiated and low-energy. I've always and a problem keeping weight and even though I try to meet my caloric intake (I guess close to it usually) and eat protein I still don't feel right.

Why is this? it seems like taking weight gainers has always been the only way. I've noticed though that when I eat food that's a little ""fatty"" and relatively thought of as being ""bad"" for you, I usually feel more full, nourished and have more mental clarity and energy. It's similar with meat I've noticed as well that I always get an energy boost from it. I know a problem in the industrialized world and  for a lot of people is the opposite and it's keeping weight off but honestly I've never been able to keep it on, so it's sort of the opposite for me. Even with foods that are supposedly ""fatty"" and with high cholesterol don't outright seem to cause me that many problems. 

oh and if we're going to criticize diets I don't think most people get enough ""calories"" (agian, the whole weight thing) and they seem to get by fine without it. *shrugs* It takes forever to cook all day and fit all that cooking/eating the right amount of calories into your diet.

All throughout school, I could not seem to understand math and struggled with many of the assignments I was given. At work, even with relatively simple tasks, it is the same. I seem to struggle with mental clarity, and often times it feels like my brain has trouble grasping things even when I know it is simple and easy. It honestly feels like something is getting in the way or blocking my ability to understand or learn things effectively.  Also my short term memory isn't always that great either.

have spoken of other women as if they don't like them, or look down upon their own sex.

Why is this? 


Things I often hear are ""too competitive"" ""backstabbing"" ""bitchy"" 

and then also told that I should not trust them. I had one woman who has a fair amount older then me, told me I have to be really careful about younger girls(my age), and then looked at me and I she looked visibly upset or something. 

She said then in reply to something I said about ""love"" and how I am afraid of relationships (getting close to anyone in general) because I don't want to hurt anybody. I mean, she was like flat out warning me. I have been warned BY OTHER women about women too. Honestly, even though I have been lied to by them, I still don't find them as difficult to deal with as men.

I've never really cared or value it all that much. I suppose I want to contribute something of merit to the world, but it has to be personal and meaningful to me. It's sort of complicated issue for me, but I've never understood the rush or the general insistence of gaining success both socially and financially in someway. 

While there's always sort of the odd quip or guy saying things like ""oh yeah, there's another way of life, we don't all have to be like this"" 

often times it's seen as the only path in life that really matters or exists. As if our worth in life is measured almost solely by what we manage to accomplish in a system with only so many pre-defined variables that even exist in the first place in terms of what you can do with your life; it just seems like the idea of being an individualist, and everything else that doesn't sort of fall under that umbrella is completely neglected and ignored.   


I refuse to believe that this is simply the law of the world and all of nature including human kind. I do not think that human nature can so easily be forced into some kind of hierarchy to which modern day capitalism seems to define.

growing up it never occurred to me that I could actually be quite intelligent, nor was it something that I would have ever really place much value on; in fact if anything, it would have probably made me feel like more of an oddity. 

I think that growing up, whatever natural inclinations and potential I had I am sure must of been stifled by the way I was raised and the type of environment I grew up in. I developed emotional and psychological issues in relation to them, and I believe spent much of my youth merely copping with the result of that, as well as just navigating in the largely unhealthy environment I was stuck in. 

See, but the last couple of years, I have noticed some odd occurrences, and especially as I have worked through my psychological issues that I was left with, and have gained more clarity and become more healthy minded in my life...

I am routinely told that I am ""smart"" or ""intelligent"" and often times, when someone is complimenting me, or pointing something I am doing out, it's usually in relation to, or simply making note of that itself. 

It is quite shocking to me. 

As well as finding out I am in fact an ""INFP"" in the MBTI, and visiting forums on the internet, it seems many INFP's are in fact gifted, and have found that I relate to those ones quite often the most. 

That, and just a couple of other things, it just makes me wonder. 
I remember reading that INFP is one of the most common MBTI types amongst the gifted, and researched from there, and find myself relating very strongly.

My name is Rylan...

I am now 24 years old. 

my whole life I have found it very difficult to really to find places or people that I really click with or get along well with...

I find that often I am viewed as just outright strange, weird, unusual, freakish, a loser...

Well any of this ever change? is there something wrong with being the way I am? 

Okay, here's the thing that I think is a big part of it.

I think when most people first meet or get to know you, they do the whole ""SO WHADDYA DO"" and they expect some kind of answer I can't really give, and then their eyes sort of glaze over and all of a sudden it's like they have a defector in their mists or something and I am not welcomed or wanted. 

I don't have a profession, I can't really afford to go to school just for fun, if at all. I don't have a profession or a career...

Am I a loser...? am  I now behind, and really that far on the outskirts of what is socially acceptable now? because it seems like since I have moved to the city, almost everyone is a professional, or busying themselves with school, and I just sort of feel lost..


I am more or less an orphan, and I had a very dysfunctional abusive childhood, and upbringing. It was very difficult. 

I was not well-equipped for the adult world; and now I am just here..


I have spent many years just trying to figure life out...and it's been very difficult not to really have anyone to turn to...

Besides that, I have never really wanted to be a part of the ""rat race"" or even be a 9-5 person; but is this so odd or strange? whenever I say this to people they like I stated earlier don't get it. 

Am I doomed? am I a failure now...? I can't stop feeling sad lately because of how much I have missed out growing up because I was poor, and was never hardly given any opportunities or chances to succeed, and I was never really shown or taught anything. It's been a real struggle for me and I have just spent long periods of time searching and having absolutely no idea what to do and being lost.

But  I don't think I am given the benefit of the doubt most often...

Well, I was mostly just wondering about this in a romantic/relationship sense

but also a friendship and just social sense as well.

Which types of people or even types should we look out or expect to get along best with?

As an Intuitive, who especially has always has quite a high leaning in that area, I have found it very difficult to find others who are sort of on the same page as me. 

I suppose it would also be introversion as well, but generally I have had this re-occurring problem where I generally when conversing I have people (particularly girls) get angry or think I am weird or some kind of  a loser/good ball because I don't ""do"" very much or something, and don't always just focus on regular everyday, or immediate things related to what I do. 

Like, I tend to read and think/daydream a lot, and most of my hobbies are sort of the introverted variety. Generally, I don't care for going out that much, or going out and spilling my day with an assortment of activities, and lots of people. But like, it seems to leave me with nothing to talk about with most people.


So I don't know. I am also not a T, so I find many to think that I am too ""airy"" or spacey as well...
