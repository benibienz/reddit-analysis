  I was not stating that I assume all 270k petition signers would pay $15/month, however the amount that would should still be substantial evidence for the financial support backing these servers (important to note that this number was not enforced by Blizzard advertising, however if legacy servers were to be properly released by blizzard, you should expect AT LEAST 270k paid subscribers. )    
 
 The common solution most people are satisfied with is that legacy servers would be included with your retail subscription. Using this method, Blizzard would LOSE the surefire ROI from legacy servers, as releasing legacy servers would give a significant bump to sub count, assuming this method is taken.

 Regarding your statement that content would be stale after a month or two, have you actually ever played vanilla wow, or a private server emulating anything before/at wotlk? Active players of nost were progressing through content for a year and a half before the server was killed, and AQ was about to be released at that time. Remember that AQ wasn't even the final raid tier, there was also naxx. This is about 2.5 years of progressive content that DOES NOT require an active content development team from blizzard. After these 2.5 years they would re-release TBC to these legacy servers. You are very misguided to how these servers would actually work.

It's a shame to live in your fears daily.

It seems that whenever the price of a skin goes up, public opinion of the skin turns to the good. The SAME thing happened with the dlore, IDK what caused the price increase other than the cobblestone collection not dropping anymore but the initial response to the Dlore was terrible, ""the fucking chess board is so ugly"", and now it is the most coveted awp skin.

The opposing team would not lose the normal elo from a loss to prevent the LE on the other team purposely griefing the teams elo, but if the opposing team were to win they would obtain more than the original elo.
