I am trying to base my server off of this old 2.4.3 server that was fucking amazing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgiWHHq_JLk . Any feedback to this thread is appreciated.

   The main features of my server that may differentiate it from other servers will be custom content(obviously), including mounts, instances, zones(reskins of current zones at first), races, and eventually I will start development on a custom class. There will be no leveling road, you will start at level 60 and progress through custom zones and quests until you reach 100, where I will balance end-game gameplay to make PvP seem fair. In place of the weird satisfaction you get from leveling roads(some of the time), there will be a large focus on solo dungeons and 5-man dungeons. I have the experience in C++ and I have already created some(buggy) scripts that will accomplish custom features, I have 5 free hours per day starting in the next month where it will be possible to release the server in september if I work efficiently and don't get too distracted with overwatch",wowservers,favorite/least favorite features of funservers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/4jp880/favoriteleast_favorite_features_of_funservers/
