What's the low-down? How different is the old Intuos 4 medium from the new Intuos Art medium in terms of feel, build quality, etc? The apparent extra portability of the new models and the option for a wireless upgrade is enticing, though from what I've read the new ones feel cheaper, especially the pen, which would be a downside for me.

Since then so much of that has been lost, INCLUDING some functionality I used heavily - Quick Look used to preview just about EVERYTHING and I used it for such - doing video editing and effects work I'd regularly use it to quickly key through libraries of stock footage and such and it was great for my workflow. Now I can't do that; Quick Look is now compatible with far less formats than it used to be.

I still like OSX and prefer it to using windows, though admittedly part of that is the hardware.

As for adding extra things, I assume you mean adding complications such as weather, battery, or health information. Unfortunately Apple doesn't allow complications to be added to to the ""Photo"" and ""Photo Album"" faces.",2015-09-23 03:13:18+00:00,cvazejp,2.0,t1_cvaywp4,960.0,AppleWatch
