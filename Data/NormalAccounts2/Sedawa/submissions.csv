I'm currently saving with the goal of getting a loan and buying my first place, sooner rather than later. I'd like to eventually be able to own a few places as investment properties and rent them out, but I don't want to get ahead of myself.

My main question as a newbie to all this: Is Brisbane a bad place to be looking to buy? Why/why not?

I currently live and work just south of Brisbane. It seems that all the posts and articles I see are freaking out about a bubble but it seems to mainly pertain to Melbourne and Sydney. I'm having a hard time finding some clear opinions or advice on the Brisbane area.",AusProperty,Is Brisbane a bad bet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusProperty/comments/58ki67/is_brisbane_a_bad_bet/

So I'm putting a call out - is there anybody out there with, or with access to, or who knows someone with access to, a badge/button maker machine and would be willing to help us out?

These use the Pokemon Yellow sprites, though it'd be easy for me to swap these with the Blue or Red versions. Let me know if you have a request! I tinted the collection green as a nod to the original Game Boy, though if there's any demand I'll happily do a greyscale set, or tinted another colour.

Currently working on a version 2 set which will contain sprites from Red/Blue, Yellow and Green, in different colour variations. Stay tuned.
