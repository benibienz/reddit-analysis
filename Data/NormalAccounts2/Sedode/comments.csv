Pre chroma 3 10000 cases unboxed a day with a 1/100 chance of unboxing a knife

After chroma 3 100000 cases unboxed a day with a 1/100 chance unboxing a knife

If you understand simple probability it means that after chroma 3 case is released there will be ALOT more knives unboxed in a shorter space of time meaning that for now the supply has increased with (as you states) the demand unaffected.

To put it into an even simpler perspective its like there only being 2 lotterys in the beginning and now there is 3, this means more winners thus more bayonet sapphires unboxed meaning that the price should hopefully decrease and fuck you over and rid this subreddit of your completely invalid economics ",2016-04-28 16:54:39+00:00,d2kw37m,3.0,t1_d2kv9u6,1064.0,GlobalOffensiveTrade

If 10 people open a box with a 1/100 chance of getting a knife 

Then 1000 people open a box with 1/100 chance of getting a knife

I recently quit trading to focus on my studies and I wont lie my inv is pretty good, BUT iv loved Navi from the beginning. When i played dota before csgo i remeber the likes of Dendi inspiring me to play dota and then the Ukranians came to csgo, all special players with a unique skill.

Navi is a team i hold close to my heart, the Ukranians have been through alot and are still under pressure in war, this M4 would be SO special to me as It will remind me why i play csgo, why i try to improve and who I will forever support
