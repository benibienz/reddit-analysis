They would be given like 5 test cases to review and they would have to get 4/5 of them perfect in order to qualify getting access to overwatch.

If they fail then they can reapply after a 3 month period.

This would ensure that people with access to over watch wouldn't give inaccurate analysis.

What are your thoughts?

Perhaps we should stop this max system.

If you have a 412 kara or bayo, then sure say its a 412 not a max, same with the legendary scar ak people call it the scar

I started csgo a year and a half ago, dont get me wrong iv dedicated some serious time, money and effort to this game and i love it but I still remain hopeless at this game, iv made sure my monitor is turned on lol. But i just cannot improve at this game, i can aim like a supreme/global is 1v1 servers yet in competitive I am awful in match making even after 30 mins of practice on a aim map.

Here are my questions to the experienced players

1. What am i doing wrong :(

2. How do i improve

3. Are there any people in the same situation as me or am i just naturally bad at this awesom game

There once was a small black pug called ludo who would bark constantly and one day his bark became very deep. All his pug friends didnt want to be friends with him anymore so he dressed up in a tiger costume to go an mingle with them tiger road men. When the tigers were getting to know Ludo, one of the tigers noticed something was missing.....A FAKIN BADASS TIGER MOFO CLAW SWAG MACHINE SITTING AT THE END OF HIS FINGER. Every Night Ludo the pug cried he has no friends and he couldnt live up to his dream of being a tiger. He begged his owners for a tiger claw karambit but when they came out of the magic chroma case they were 700 KEY LIKE WTF??? But now Ludo has been trading his squishy ass off in order to afford his tiger claw so he can finally go an mingle with his new best friends the tigers.

So yeah thats the story it very sad but hopefully every story has a happy ending so give me dat bad ass tiger claw
