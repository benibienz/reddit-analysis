I downloaded the app a while ago but hadn't got around to setting up an account. I chose to do it today so I can share something in a very anonymous way. This something I can't share with people I know.  I live with my sister and her child and have since the baby was born. The baby's father is not involved. My sister has been dating this guy over a year might be close to two. He is a nice guy and is good to my sister and her child. But in my opinion he drinks too much. I don't think I could be with someone who drinks that much but that is me. Last night he stayed the night with her like he has done many times before. I donâ€™t mind that. But she gets up and has to be to work at 6. Usually she takes him home before she goes to work. This morning he stayed at the house. Again he has done that before but went home when my sister went on lunch. Today he stayed the whole day. I wouldn't care but he started drinking as soon as he got up around 8:30/9. Fine he's an adult I don't care. But then he started making me uncomfortable. Being too close, whispering to himself, following room to room. I don't think he would do anything inappropriate but I just wasn't comfortable. I finally had to leave. It was a hour before I have to be any where but I couldn't stay any longer. I made up an excuse and left. He wanted to come along but I didn't want someone that drunk with me. I never want to be alone for that long with him again. I could never tell any one I know but I needed to let it out. Thank you for listening.",Feelings,Needed to be said,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feelings/comments/5dodca/needed_to_be_said/
