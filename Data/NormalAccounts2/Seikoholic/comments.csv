Actual Quote Dept:

&gt;He's still a human, and the fact he hasn't replied is evidence of the pain the failure has caused him, he is clearly too ashamed to face anyone and money isn't going to get rid of that feeling. He was plenty happy before the money, it's not somehow a cure for his woes.

&gt;it's clear that Sean's happiness is about making games he loves, no amount of money will change the heartbreak this most definitely was for him.

&gt; Again, you can dislike someone for what they've done but still sympathise with some emotions they might be feeling, ignoring the money and putting yourself in their shoes.

According to some figures online, NMS has pulled in well over 80 million dollars.

I give my advice to stay within the USA because many new buyers aren't well-versed in what to look for, and they'll have a better chance of getting a better watch if they stay inside the USA or Australia.  People buy seriously damaged watches from outside of the USA because they believe a seller instead of their own eyes, and then they send them to me, and I have to break the bad news to them.  I'd prefer to break that cycle instead and have them start out with a good watch.

Also, I've never advocated buying NOS.  I don't have any place or use for NOS watches. I admire them, but I don't keep them.

It was wonderful to see him and hear him speak but the crowd was super duper cringey.  It was made up of people who seemed to have no idea how loud their own voices were, and that was before he came out.  When he did start speaking they instantly started howling with laughter, so much so that a lot of what he said couldn't be heard.  They'd start laughing before he even told the punchline.  They talked over him, they told each other what he was saying, or made predictions about what he was going to say.  Many of them didn't seem to be listening to him at all, just talking to each other.  He was clearly uncomfortable.  The worst was when at one point he was talking about his cover artist, Josh Kirby.  Some blowhard from the back just *bellowed* out **HE SUCKS**, as Pratchett was in mid-sentence.  Pratchett just stopped cold.  Mr. Kirby had died previously.  It was really an awful moment.

I waited in line for him to sign my book.  He'd just released one but the book store partnering with the event had screwed up and didn't have any on hand for sale.  Luckily I had my paperback of ""Jingo"", and also luckily I was absolutely the last in line.  I was going to take a picture of him, but he looked so tired and wary that I didn't.

A good chunk of every week is spent combing online for more parts, always.  When I find certain super important rare parts, I always buy them no matter what.  If I find multiples, I buy them all.  

But the other way is to re-make them, if possible.  /u/hal0eight is big on this.  He's remaking critical components for the 6139-600x compound stem, for example.  My own company remakes a number of original Seiko crystals that are long out of production.  /u/hal0eight and I are working on a joint venture now to recreate a critical jewel needed to address a design oversight in the 6xxx family.

343,"Reluming generally is a touchy business, with lots of variables to deal with.  Reluming a 6105 is especially challenging as the deep lume wells make creating a flat fill difficult.  Depending on the lume mix, it can shrink and suck in, and then you have to go over it again.  Get THAT mix wrong and the fill is obvious.  One way to approach it is to do a lot of very thin fills, tiny thin layers, over and over, and gradually fill the wells.  But that's not ideal, and not what Seiko did.  It took me years of work to come up with a custom mix that fills without shrinking, and has the right grain size, and has the right daytime color.

The movement had been repeatedly water-soaked through a failed crown seal, and a lot of the front end was junk. Ditto for the train. And mainspring. And mainspring barrel. It was rough.

Then some enterprising genius decided to try his hand at getting it running again. He managed to literally smash the escape wheel (about 1/3rd of it was missing), bend the pallet fork, and destroy the balance. Oh, and he bent the balance cock. Fantastic.

I ended up replacing basically everything back from the main plate. The main plate itself was badly damaged from another repair attempt that roached the lower mainspring arbor port. The person had also managed to warp the main plate while doing this, which was causing the wheels to bind up as the pivots weren't sitting straight in their jewels. They'd also installed a bad / incorrect crystal seal at some point, which didn't help the dial &amp; hands. But, I brought it back. I had to go nuclear, but it came back.

429,"One of the things my company does is to reproduce a number of original Seiko crystal designs, all of which are long out of production. We took over this part of our business from my old friend and business partner Jonathan Koch, who died back in June 2014. He moved his designs and business contracts to us before his death to ensure that his crystals would continue.

The 7549-7010 and the 6159-700x use very similar crystals, but Jonathan at that time chose to only have one of the two made. He chose the 6159 crystal, probably because he had a higher opinion of that watch model. The problem is now that they're so expensive (the watch) that very few people have them, and those who do don't wear them, which means they don't need crystals. Their crystals can be used in the 7549s, which are far more plentiful and affordable, but they're not correct. The correct ones are sometimes available from Cousins but they haven't had them in a long time now.

So, I made the decision to have the correct crystals made. This is a first. They are reverse-engineered from Seiko originals. I'm proud to add to Jonathan's crystals. ",2016-09-24 15:05:28+00:00,d8063za,1.0,t3_54ah8e,16.0,JapaneseWatches

The bore, while still good, has had many rounds down it.  The stitching is loose on the holster straps, the buckle is even worn inside, not to mention outside.  The belt shows signs of having been adjusted in and out, over and over, again and again.  All the leather is polished from use, not sitting in a foot locker.

512,"We have a local gunshop here, it's been in place for a good fifteen years or more.  The owner is divorced and lives in the back.  I think he mostly keeps the shop so he can claim to have a business.  He doesn't need the money as far as I can tell, the shop is mainly made up of his decades-old collection.  He opens sometimes, and is closed sometimes, and goes out for lunch for hours.  Sometimes he doesn't come back.  It's always a gamble when going down there since he may or may not be open.  But yesterday he was open.  

I've wanted a Radom for some time, in large part because I'm part Polish.  Also, they are considered the last of the ""horse guns"", as they were made to requirements for cavalry use, so they can be cocked / decocked fired etc with one hand.  They were designed in partnership with FN, and they show a lot of High Power characteristics.  Talking to the guy, he said he had one, and pulled out this rig.  He said he'd had it for at least twenty years.  

The gun is an interesting piece.  It's all matching except the barrel, and the barrel is off by one digit.  These Radoms were made in two stages - the main bulk of the work was done at the captured Radom factory in Poland.  To prevent Poles from getting weapons by smuggling out parts, the unfinished guns were shipped to Steyr in Austria where the barrels were made.  This didn't stop Poles from getting completed guns, as they had underground factories that made barrels and so could have completed guns.  These were used in the Warsaw uprising.

This is a ""Type II"" three lever example.  From what I understand, it appears to a mix of German-made parts and early Polish-made parts.  There are what I believe to be Polish stamps on both sides of the frame where the trigger meets the frame, as well as German acceptance and firing proofs on the frame and slide, among other places.  People normally say that these Radoms were issued primarily to Police, SS, and paratroops.  I don't know if that's true or is ""common wisdom"" (i.e. wrong).  The gun is worn inside and out.  Not badly worn, but it has many many rounds put through it.  The bluing is worn thin, and the gun clearly has had many miles on it, but not recently.

The rest of the rig... well, I wish it could talk.  Or maybe I wouldn't.  The holster is named, but I can't read it.  The belt and buckle are absolutely original.  What a piece of history.",2016-09-14 14:46:56+00:00,d7mfopq,1.0,t3_52qsqr,319.0,guns

They ~~are~~ were the Yankees living north of Boston up in the Cape Ann area and north.  Just old school rural New Englanders.  A lot of that area is very swampy (FO4 showed this very well), so ""Swamp Yankee"".  They had their own accents and traditions.  I can still hear my grandfather's accent but I can't imitate it, and I haven't heard anything like it in decades.  They did a lot of boat-building, timber-gathering, fishing, agriculture.  They mixed in with the ""French"" who sort of moved in and around from the Down East areas (Maine), and Portuguese who were in the coastal fishing towns.  The areas they used to live in, that I remember as being very remote and rural, are just grubby suburbs of Boston now, really.

The Stelux center links are crazy double-overlap affairs with locking tabs.  They're a bear to get open without damaging anything.  And then the original endlinks have to be opened off of the too-wide ends, and moved to the new ends.  It's time-consuming and nitpicky work.  But yes, that's how it is done.  And then when that's done, you have to play with the endlinks to get them to hold correctly and tightly to the case, or they're rattly.

So, you have to know what good looks like, for yourself.

I added this complete rig because I knew the holster was original.  I have owned many pieces like it, I have handled many more.  I knew that the pistol would reflect this, if he still had it.  I talked with the guy who had owned the whole rig, the seller.

But most tellingly, the fakes always have something wrong with the finishing, the dimensions, the cut.  On other things it's harder, like uniform pieces.  But leather, leather is hard to get the wear / aging right.  In this case, someone would have had to have not only gotten every single detail of the stitching right, but they would have had to have used Prestoff, which hasn't been made basically since the war.  They would have also had to have found and used leather that had red rot, which takes decades in a damp environment to form.  Also, they would have had to have formed this piece around a genuine pistol and extra clip, as the impressions of both are very clear inside the holster.

Trust me, the real thing is real, and will tell you.

The holster was original, I could see that.  When I got it, it had clearly had a 38H and extra mag in it, original, for a long time until recently.  The seller of the holster, when asked, instantly replied that he had the mag and pistol and that I could buy them.  The pistol is the right age, the right wear.  I don't doubt his story.

674,"I've been looking to add a 38H to the collection for some time.  I didn't find one initially, but I did come across an interesting holster on eBay, and that led me to having a pistol incoming.

The holster was a cheap buy-it-now.  It had been modified after capture by the addition of an NSKK crash helmet eagle.  While I didn't initially recognize the eagle, I saw that it was original, and was a vet capture setup.  So, I bought it.  When it showed up, it was clear that the holster had, until recently, held the pistol and extra mag.  So, I wrote the seller to ask about them.  

He had them both, he'd bought the entire rig from the original family in the 1970s.  Tough times led him to split the rig up to get the most money out of it.  Extra mag on eBay, pistol on his own little militaria website.  But we struck a bargain, and I'm putting it all back together.  The pistol is an early high-polish example, accepted by the military.  The holster is a later-war type, made of pressed paper, a material called ""prestoff"".  The added eagle is aluminum.  The tab is the only leather part, and it's unfortunately suffering from red rot, which is not reversible.  I might repair that, as I have another original holster where the tab is good but the rest has some kind of crazy chemical burns all over it.  We'll see.

My thing is WW2 stuff that shows individuality, traces of the original owner, or the original vet who captured it, so this is a special pistol for me, fits right into the collection.  It was a thing after the war to modify captured holsters with captured insignia, sort of a version of the ""hate belts"" seen in WW1.  They're seen less and less often these days, in large part because a thriving business exists to reverse these additions, so the holsters don't show damage and the insignia can be sold.  History being lost.  But this one was still intact.  The eagle is one seen on a few examples of some nameless gorget I've been able to find, but have not been able to ID branch or purpose yet.

730,"I think the single largest hurdle was getting away from the mindset of ""small = difficult"".  Yes, small movements with small parts, but once magnification happened, then the scale issues dropped away in terms of comprehension.  They are still there for practical reasons, however.  I grew up making models and doing fine detail work, so working at scale was already there for me.  There's just so much stuff to know.  I worked with a master watchsmith, a Rolex and Omega-trained guy in his 80s.  I first met him about thirty years ago.  So much of what he taught was stuff that isn't in books - odd tricks, things to look for, and more importantly, *ways to think* about watch technology.  There are so many overlapping and odd interactions with watches, that it's hard to not start to personify them, to infer life and personality.  At least for me.  They have temperaments, moods, are fussy or happy.  It's a constant battle for me to bring it back down to geometry, lubrication, wear, etc.  In the end, they are just machines.  Tiny machines, but machines.

The training bottleneck now is that because of the quartz revolution in the 70s and 80s, we lost at least two whole generations of trained watchsmiths, since it looked like mechanical watches were on their way out.  All the watch schools closed eventually, and the old watchsmiths died off.  There used to be three watchsmiths just in my town besides me.  Now there's only me.  I am a good self-teacher, but without outside guidance it's easy to fall into traps of habit or approach.  Many of the issues I've faced come from being locked into my own assumptions.  For example, one issue with scale I had to really change my thinking on was with lubricants.  Get small enough parts, small enough scales and tolerances, and oil becomes a dampening agent, not a lubricant.",2016-08-20 15:47:48+00:00,d6pgz27,7.0,t1_d6pgmvi,522.0,Watches

768,"&gt;Hopefully you at least consider the old mans points when voting.

Well, yes, of course.  I have considered his points over the course of a lifetime with him, and rejected them as I felt they were not based on values that I held in the specific single-issue things he was motivated by in these cases.  I don't vote reflexively, blindly, without thought.

I loved my dad. He and I were eye-to-eye about a lot of things - personal responsibility, the honor and privilege of being a father and husband, the values of a civil society, about how to problem solve, and to understand which were the things that truly mattered.  He was deeply religious, unlike me.  He was also a scientist, and was pro-science.  He couldn't stand bullshit and nonsense and people who didn't think clearly.  Where we diverged was his truly unfortunate unshiftable aversion to things like cohabitation outside of marriage, and homosexuality.   He was an extreme traditionalist.  When he was under stress or confronted with a situation that ran sideways to his convictions, he could say things that were fairly monstrous.  I have always believed he was a good person, but he was a person, and people are complicated.

It's easy to look at people we don't know who think this way and reduce them to one quality, and then say that they are bad, wholesale, through and through.  People are not two-dimensional.  They are many-layered, and have many kinds of motivations.  Dad's actions spoke louder than his words, and he was charitable, and caring, and he poured love into our lives.  He loved his students, generations of them, and nothing made him happier when someone persevered and succeeded.  He was very interested in people, even people he'd just met.  Always happy to speak to someone new.  He was inflexible when it came to these other social / personal things, and I think it was something he just couldn't address.  In the last day of his life he did say that he regretted being inflexible, about being more vinegar than honey in regards to other people.  He alienated some good people out of his life because of these ideas of his, and I hope on some level he wished in the end that he'd cared more about the people and less about this other stuff, but I don't know.

I can only judge him on the basis of his actions, which were both good and bad, but very much mostly good.  I know a lot of his mind, but there is so much more that I don't know, and never will.  I am very sorry he is gone, I had a lifetime with him, but it wasn't enough.  I would have liked more.  We named our new son after him, born this June.

778,"I saw an original WW2 German uniform jacket at a costume store probably 25 years ago.  It was child-sized.  When I was a teen in the 1980s I used to go to thrift stores all the time.  In those days the age of clothing was usually from the 50s and 60s and 70s, but some 40s and earlier stuff was sometimes around.  I always liked vintage uniforms, but was always annoyed because they were always too small, especially in the shoulders.  I was not a big kid, I was pretty average, 6' and maybe 160-170.  But these uniforms almost always seemed made for children.  The worst was a WW1 Doughboy uniform I found once.  The shoulders were tiny and sloping.  If you look at a lot of old shots of men from back then, look at the size of the head versus the size of the chest and shoulders.  And it's not just men.  My GF in my late teens used to go with me, and she would find stuff from the 20s for women, especially shoes.  Tiny, and unwearable.  She was 5'7"" and maybe 125 in those days.  And she couldn't wear most of the vintage dresses she found.  One time she found some Victorian stuff, including button boots.  They were for an adult woman, and they wouldn't have fit her when she was a girl.",2016-08-12 18:27:32+00:00,d6evl8h,2.0,t1_d6e54wo,50850.0,CombatFootage

791,"You know one of my main gripes about modern Seiko?  They ~~never~~ rarely get the hands right.  The hands ~~always~~ mostly look blobby and weird and slightly indistinct.  

In the golden age, Seiko was all about flat planes, sharp angles, razor-sharp transitions.  Absolutely flat hand surfaces in every way, sharp folds.  Paint hugged the hand surface, chrome was absolutely flat.  Then they just got *blobby*, it's so weird.  

Same with dial elements.  Look at a 6105 or a 6159 dial - the markers are absolutely flat on top, with 90 degree sides.  The modern version, the MM300, the markers are round-topped, with a domed profile.  When it comes to hands, you see something like that same transition.  The last flat-topped main-line diver handset was used in the 7002 divers.  The next iteration was the SKX series, and you guessed it, blobby melted chrome hands.  The only exception, the only holdout, is the sweep hand on the SKX173s.  It's a clone of the 6309 sweep hand except with modern lume.  That's it.

I was so hopeful when the SRP 6309 homages were announced that they'd return to precise, flat hand surfaces.  The mock-up artowork looked like they were going to.  And then the watches arrived, and there are those blobby surfaces again.

Seiko just has lost their way when it comes to handsets.  I have no idea why they take so little care with this critical detail.  It's the difference between a watch looking classy &amp; elegant, and a watch looking like a $50 quartz bought at Target.  I mean, that Ananta just looks cheap to me, all because of the handset.

One standout though where they did get it right is the SUN series. like my [SUN019](http://i.imgur.com/hSh0pPP.jpg).  Seiko *did* get this one right.",2016-08-07 06:55:30+00:00,d67kblg,2.0,t1_d67k2bg,759.0,Watches

796,"I'm a professional watchsmith who specializes in these ""golden age"" Seikos, especially the divers and chronographs.

Very few people work on them, for a few reasons.  Firstly, parts are extremely hard to come by.  Secondly, they are fussy and demanding, and it is easy to do something that will set you (and the watch) back a long way.  They're quirky and weird, and you have to factor in strange behaviors due to past abuse and age.  In many cases, getting a Seiko of this era back to working condition means understanding and accounting for the wear that is already present, to lessen the impact or mitigate the issues caused.  They can be a simple straightforward servicing, or they can be days of extra work.

Unlike a Swiss chronograph, which will be generally robust and workmanlike and overbuilt, Seiko chronographs are more like an assembly of carefully balanced springs and levers, floating in association with each other.  That's an exaggeration but it gives you an idea.  ",2016-08-06 20:04:14+00:00,d6704vl,4.0,t1_d670184,176.0,Watches

These aren't seen often.  This is the rarest of the JDM variants of this model line - the lumed model with arrow-tip hands.  Most of the ones seen are the non-lumed ones, and all the ones seen are typically horribly faded.  

This one is not faded, and it's unusual to see this, so much so that many people don't know what these actually looked like new.  Seiko's choice of materials wasn't great - the orange fades badly, lightening and changing to yellow and then, given enough time, tan.

So it's nice to show what they looked like when they were newer, to get a sense of what people saw that made them want to buy this wonderful watch model.

When your numbers drop, push upselling.  When the numbers are unrealistic, blame the team for not meeting them.  Cut more hours and resources to meet lowered demand.  Repeat.

839,"He knew it from new, he had it for decades.  He'd stopped wearing it in the early 1980s I think, it just sat in a drawer.  To him, it was just a watch.  I had several conversations with him about the significance of the watch model generally, and the importance of this particular example.  I described it as ""investment grade"", not a tool watch, not something to bang round and wear as a daily, and certainly not a diver.  He really wasn't that interested, I don't think.  He valued the watch, he was sentimentally attached to it, but not enough to consider keeping it if he couldn't use it as he did back when it was new.  He wasn't really interested in the full investment he would have needed to make to bring this back, he wanted to do ""enough"" to make it wearable.  I more or less said that it should be either all or nothing.  All of it, or back into the drawer it goes, don't half-ass it.  He just wanted to have it back as a worry-free daily.  Once I talked him out of that, then he decided he'd prefer to move it on.   I was glad to give it a home, though I paid more for this example than I've paid for any 6105 ever.

I'd swear the watch is a 6139-600x, and potentially a 6139-6000 ""proof"", with the notch cutout.  If this photo was taken in 1969, the that's what we'd see for the most part.  The 6139s were introduced in '69.  Production started in February, but sales didn't begin until something like May of that year.  I've blown the picture up as big as I can, and can't quite make out fine detail, but I am not seeing the big dial text printing that would say ""Speedtimer"" or similiar, so I don't think it's a JDM model.  But I do sort of think I can see the crown cutout, which would say early, and ""proof""-marked.  It would depend on where he bought it.  If he bought it on base in the USA, it'd be a N. American model, like the 6139-6009 ""resist"".  If he bought it on a local base there, or on leave, it might be a 6139-6000 ""Proof"".  

The bracelet I can't quite see.

The model has a two-tone bezel.  It's a model with regular lugs, not hooded lugs.

I am not a shipwright at all, so correct me if I am wrong.

It was the last ship made at the center of what had once been one of the biggest shipbuilding centers in the country.   The author, Dana Story, took the photographs when he was a kid in high school.  It's a wonderful piece of documentation, of a craft mostly gone.

That ship, the Blackfish, also had an external ballast keel setup.  In the 1950s, the bolts finally rusted through and parted, and the keel went down, and the ship went over, capsized.  It washed up on the nearest beach, was scavenged and then scrapped.  No more Blackfish.

*Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION'

Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.*",2016-07-15 13:24:17+00:00,d5d98xe,5.0,t1_d5ctn06,39341.0,OutOfTheLoop

It's not so much that Feig hates men, it's that he doesn't understand women.

He doesn't understand Ghostbusters, doesn't understand women, blames men for his own lack of understanding, and doesn't understand now why this Frankenstein of a movie will fail so hard.

The father decided that we were making too much noise and trouble, and with my parents permission, gave his son and myself loaded shotguns and told us to go out.  He sent two young boys out into the fields with loaded shotguns, antiques he took out of the glass-fronted gun cabinet by the front door.  I'd never shot a gun in my life before.

I managed to wing a starling.  I had to reload to finish it off.  I still feel badly.

EDIT: I just remembered that shotgun I was carrying had gone to the South Pole on some expedition.  Scott's, perhaps?  I'm not sure.

""Cannonball"" was, to me anyway, one of those songs that was different in many ways from pretty much anything else the band ever did.

Like ""Brass In Pocket"" for the Pretenders, or ""Rock the Casbah"" by the Clash.

""Cannonball"" was sort of that kind of thing, at least for me.  But then in retrospect, Breeders were sort of a bland Pixies-lite.  They had some of the feel but less of the depth and complexity.

30s were much simpler and easier, and a lot of the nonsense and BS went away.  I felt a lot more like myself in my 30s, and towards the end of my 30s had really gotten my priorities figured out.  

The biggest negatives of the 30s mostly revolve around everyone else figuring themselves out as well, and coming out in terms of who they really are.

I'm not really sure when he purchased either of these, but it had to be between '65 -'69.  He was in Vietnam during this time period as an enlisted and he also worked as a contractor.  He was a Navy CB and he also was a diver. He does talk about training at the same facilities the underwater demolition teams trained. He worked as a Commercial Diver up until the '80s.""*

The earlier 6105-8000 was especially hard-hit cosmetically, with lume so damaged it was just falling out of the hands and dial.   The later 6105-8110 was very rough internally, with numerous damaged &amp; worn parts.  I had to go into it two times to get it where I needed it to be.

Both watches were missing their lume pips completely.  The lume pips are made up of a plastic disc in the insert that is back-filled with lume.  In both watches, the disc was missing.  In the past, I would harvest lume pip windows from old inserts but my supplies are gone.  So, I had to invent a method to make new lume pip windows, which I did.  Very proud of that.

Two old warriors.  Everything is clean, fixed, restored, replaced, tuned, and ready to go now.  I replaced the crown seals in both watches, always fun as the crowns are not meant to be serviced.

1227,"Well, Seiko in the post-war era, and especially in what I call their Golden Age (1968-1988, my own opinion) produced many workhorse movement families.  Broadly these are the pre-'68 movements, ones made between '64 and '68 such as the 66xx and 62xx movements (both are great but have their limitations, see below).  

Seiko had two main workhorse families: Suwa's 6xxx family, and Daini's 7xxx family.  Suwa gave us the 6105, 6106, 6119, 6309 (and derivatives), 6139 &amp; 6138 chronographs, and the 6519 hi-beat.  They were the heart of the 1960s and early 70s.  Daini gave us the 7xxx family, 7005, 7006, 7009, 7025, 7S etc, as well as the 701x chronographs.  

Looking at both, looking at the tech in terms of movements, I'd pick the Daini 7xxx series for reliability from a movement perspective.  From an aesthetic perspective, Suwa won every time, at least for me.  The 6105 divers, the 6309 divers, the 613x chronographs.  Magnificent.  Suwa also gave us the world-beating 7A quartz chronograph, and the 754x quartz divers.  But the 6xxx series movements had a design oversight - the lower mainspring arbor port.  The mainspring arbor is the axle that the mainspring barrel turns on.  There's a lot of torque and twist to a mainspring as it works, and the lower end of the arbor is sitting in an unprotected port in a brass plate.  And it wears.  It wears sideways, grinding the circular port into an oval.  The repair isn't hard but the bushing and/or jewel needed is extremely rare now.  /u/hal0eight and I are working on having this part recreated, that's how important they are, and how serious the design oversight was.  The only 6xxx series movements that don't need this already have a jewel in place - the 6159 and 614x hi-beats.

Suwa did not last.  In late summer 1981, all core production moved to a new factory in Hong Kong.  Suwa designs continued to be produced to 1988, but then all were stopped.  Daini won, and all future main-line divers were of Daini design.

The 7xxx family does not suffer from the same design oversight I talk about above.  The mainspring isn't as strong, the barrel isn't as torquey.  This may be in part because less power is needed to drive the train, as the balance has a smaller diameter.  A lower level of stress on the train means less wear on the pivots, means better longevity.

I guess the most workhorsey of the 7xxx's would be one of the early ones, culminating in the 7002.  However, a first-gen SKX will have the ""A"" version of the balance and pallet fork, and they're quite good.  So, probably an early first-gen SKX.

I've done some research and think that there is a workaround for the C-type movement.  The escape wheels are the same on pretty much every single 7xxx-series movement.   It's just the balance and pallet fork that are different.  I may, at some point, try a mod where I swap these parts for the earlier types to avoid the ""C"" issues.  I have a 6R downstairs with the typical low amplitude.  I'll try it one of these days.

The 66xx family are awesome all-metal movements with fully jeweled trains.  Very solid and dependable, Seiko not only produced a wide range of models with the movement, but sold the movement widely for re-casing by other companies.  Issues include a low BPH and no day quickset, date quickset only.

The 62xx movements are also fantastic, but with some minor issues such as a weird time-setting system that often results in the winding pinion skipping teeth.  Also, like the 66xx family, it's an 18,000 BPH chugger.",2016-06-11 01:23:12+00:00,d44eada,3.0,t1_d44dkg1,1268.0,JapaneseWatches
1228,"My favorite goddamned subject.  Thank you for asking.

The 7002s are overlooked and unfairly maligned in the Seiko community.  They replaced the beloved 6309 divers, but only in the slim-case style of the 6309-729x's, not the cushion-cased 6309-704x (now reissued as a 7xxx-powered model, very nice).  So, that was Strike One.  Strike Two was the flat-printed dial, which people felt wasn't attractive, especially since the round markers of the cushion-cased 6309-704x's wasn't chosen, but rather the square markers.  Strike Three was the use of a new type of lume, Promethium-3.  This stuff had a terrible half-life and the lume turned grey and non-glowing very quickly.  Strike Four was the use of plastic dial and movement rings, and a nylon ring with press-in crystal instead of the L-profile rubber gasket and crystal retaining ring.  Because of these things the 7002s were considered to be cheaper models, the victim of cost-cutting done in favor of quartz models.  Mechanicals were considered to be on their way out, it was going to be all quartz all the time.  But mechanicals did NOT die out, and the 7002 was NOT a cheap watch.  And several of the innovations introduced for the 7002 were huge steps up from the 6xxx-series watches.  The 7002 had a huge improvement in the sealing systems, for example: A press-in crystal meant fewer parts, and no case lip to wear away during crystal changes - the case would last longer.   A smaller exposed crown seal on the stem, rather than an O-ring seal built into the crown as with the 6309 (which requires the entire stem to be disassembled to do a seal change and a much larger surface area for water to leak in), was an improvement in every way.

Now, what people tend of overlook is that the 7002s had a FANTASTIC movement in them.  I literally just serviced one yesterday.  After service, it was running in the 275-280 range for amplitude, with zero beat error and flat accuracy.  For comparison, my brand-new SRP775 (gold/black reissue of the 6309 cushion-case), runs around 260 and came stock with about 1.6 points of beat error (scale runs from 0.0 to 9.9).  Even after adjustment it doesn't run as well as a 25+ year-old 7002.  

The reason for this, in part, is that the new SRPs use the ""C"" type balance and pallet fork, which has some crazy issues around the hairspring hanging up.  This is why there have been stories for years now about SKX models suddenly racing, with people recommending a fix that consists of smacking the watch hard.  Don't do this.  But the 7002 uses the same balance that Seiko used in all 7xxx-series watches all the way back to the 1960s, which in the SKX first-gen movements was called the ""A"" balance.  In addition to this, the movement is all-metal, with a fully jeweled train.  The lower mainspring arbor ports don't wear like the 6xxx-series movement do (and how).   The newer SKX movements, and their descendants the SRP etc, use a lot of plastic movement parts, including datewheel, calendar elements, etc.

The newer C-type movements are being used everywhere, but I have to tell you that I really am just not impressed.  I have seen new (or nearly new) watch after watch come through here with serious amplitude problems, even nearly-new watches with 6R movements in place.  I've seen poor numbers out of brand-new replacement movements, fresh from the parts house, without a minute on the clock.  In comparison, I have gotten unrestored 7002s off of eBay that run strong, even, and accurately.  There is a fundamental problem with the new movements, and I'm still not entirely sure all what is causing it.  I suspect it's more than the C-type balance.  But it is there, it's a fact.

A 7002 is still a relative bargain, even today.  Their value is not equaled by the cost of a servicing.  But I guarantee you that a freshly-serviced 7002 will run longer, and more accurately, than any new Seiko with a 7xxx-series (4R, 6R), out of the box.  A 7002 serviced today will be a reliable timekeeper and companion for many many years, decades, and then another service should see it good again for even longer.

Also, I have theory: Americans got seriously into wearing uniforms in the 1980s I think - I always think of the huge explosion in people on bicycles on weekends wearing all labeled gear like they were pro racers.  People like wearing branded gear.  In the old days that wasn't the case.  I don't remember seeing this when I was a kid in the 1970s, it wasn't seen.  I didn't see people wearing any kind of official gear at all when I was a kid.  You wore your uniform when you were playing little league or your school team or whatever, and then you wore your own clothing.

Perhaps it has to do with the extension of adolescence into adulthood that has happened in the past few decades.  Look at this shot - the little kid wearing his uniform, sort of playing pretend.  An adult wouldn't do that.  Adults do adult things.  In those days, when you were in your 20s you were a grownup.  I was out of my parent's house at 18, and by 21 I was on my own in every possible way.  Back then at age 30 you were literally considered ""over the hill"".  I remember it used to be a thing to give ""over the hill"" parties when you turned 30.  It stopped when I was in my late teens and early 20s, so late 1980s.  The only people I can remember who were adults *and* wore gear were hard-core baseball fanatics - the old lady who went to every Sox game with her notebook and wrote down *everything*.  Old-school superfans. 

Now it's acceptable to do this stuff - look at cosplay etc.  When I was a kid, it was a trope to think of the loser Star Trek fan wearing his homemade TOS tunic and fake Spock ears.  A joke figure.  Now it's cosplay and everyone does it.",2016-05-13 17:12:11+00:00,d3497tl,2.0,t1_d348yu1,336.0,Cubs

I simply don't understand why taking down the twin towers was in any way something that the Saudi government wanted.  If it was something the government wanted, and our government knew about all of this, why isn't Saudi Arabia home to the second-largest concentration of American troops in the world right now?  Yes, I know that direct occupation of the Muslim holy lands would create a global shitstorm.  I wonder if the Saudis gave tacit behind the scenes approval to the BS we pulled in Iraq as a ""sorry about that"" thing.

1458,"This is a ""W"" block CYQ / Spreewerke p38, made in November 1944.  All matching, bring-back.  I was told that the gun has been in this holster for 72 years.  The holster is a curious piece.  No markings, thin leather, and not great quality leather.  Flaws, thin spots.  The rivets are rough, almost no finishing at all.  The stitching is correct, natural linen thread by the look of it, or perhaps hemp?  I'm not sure.  No markings at all.

The rest of the gun is very nice, for the most part.  Even bluing throughout, not a lot of firing wear, clean bore with deep grooves.  The CYQ's were made with a lot of slave labor, and as a result they tend to have parts that were rejected, marked with an asterisk punch, and then remanufactured.  

This one doesn't have any of those asterisks, but it has something else that's odd.  The hammer safety letdown lever has been ground down in one place, deliberately.  As a result, the hammer drop for the safety will not function, and disassembling the gun takes real work and finesse as the hammer won't drop correctly.

I know that forced laborers and other non-German workers would deliberately sabotage what they were working on.  I wonder if that was the case here.  Without the safety lever working correctly, it's possible that the gun would discharge when using the safety to decock the gun.  I haven't fully disassembled the gun yet to look at the rest of the parts in the slide, but I won't be putting any rounds through this one until it's 100%.

1529,"It's a years scale, as you see.  When a new battery was put in, the watchmaker was supposed to put a mark with a punch on the scale.  I've been told two things; that the punch was done to show the date of the new battery, or the punch was made forward to show when the current (new) battery should be replaced in future.

You'll notice the watch was made in January 1979, and the scale starts in 1981.  Scales were adjusted according to the production date of the watch.  The only battery change punch on this watch is at the third marker of 1981, which would be Oct / Nov / Dec.  So two years roughly from production. 

The thinking might have been that a true dive watch, which would get new seals or seals checked once a year, would get more frequent battery changes in order to make sure it was always working.  I think it was more important with a monocoque case like the 7549-700x, where a battery change was a bigger deal.  

I don't see many of these with more than one punch mark.  Sometimes two.  However, there have been exceptions with JDM models where the scale is used up entirely and a new change date stamped in with number punches.  I've seen this a few times.  I mark batteries directly with a fine-point Sharpie.  And since these watches aren't divers anymore (or shouldn't be) the urgency to make sure changes are done isn't really there anymore.  These will start doing the two-second jump when the current battery gets low, and that's usually more than enough warning.",2016-05-02 23:53:39+00:00,d2qcl6i,2.0,t1_d2qc7wv,560.0,Watches

It came in from a customer who asked about trading it in against servicing on another watch.  We figured out a number, and this weekend I took some time with it.  It was a dead wreck with a destroyed, partially stripped movement, and ruined hands.  I happened to have a set of good original hands stored, so I started thinking about restoration.  Then last week I won a watch lot that had a nice thing in it, a 6306 Silverwave.  I found that while externally that Silverwave was garbage, the movement was pristine.  

Now, you can't just drop a 7549 dial and handset onto a 630x, it won't work.  Wrong cannon pinion, hour wheel, and day wheel.  Rare parts.  Which I happen to have found last year.  So the project was doable.  Also, thanks to Adrian, I had upper and lower jewels for the mainspring arbor.  So, I serviced the 6306 movement, and installed the mainspring arbor jewels. 

So, this watch is a 23-jewel hacking automatic.",2016-05-02 15:54:40+00:00,d2pqknb,1.0,t3_4gyvrq,276518.0,JapaneseWatches

I can see mismatches, cold bluing over pitting, proof stampings filled with white highlighting material, and mother-of-pearl grips, and I'm sure that's not all.  Poor thing.  It's probably worth more as parts.

1869,"They'd leave the name behind, become the L.A. Sabertooths, and head to the playoffs by Year 2.  The new new Browns, once they were recreated back in Cleveland, would have a first season filled with promise, but then lose their as-yet unknown 1st Round QB to a nasty injury in the final minutes of a heartbreaking wildcard loss.  The injury wouldn't be career-ending, but would be one of those things where the guy was just never the same, and after a handful of disappointing seasons, he'd off the Browns (and then out of the league) in short order.  And the skies would slowly darken over Cleveland, as the cold set in.

It is in nice cosmetic condition.  Me personally I'd keep the bracelet.  I could put it back together, it's just missing the pin.

I am a professional watchsmith, I specialize in these.  There's no way to polish the crystal - it is hardened mineral glass, so-called Hardlex - but replacements aren't expensive.  Almost no one can do decent casework on these, so I recommend not even trying.  A case cleaning, new crystal etc will do wonders.

I would strongly recommend two things: keeping the chronograph running at all times, and also not wearing the watch until it has been serviced.  These will wear badly if run without service.

1920,"Hey all, 

I've been distracted and very busy since some crazy life stuff back in February.  I had to take some time off of work, and then I had to do double-time to catch up.  These past few weeks I've gotten some big jobs done, lots of good output, so I took the end of this week and did a restoration for myself.

This popped up on eBay a few weeks ago. A smashed wreck, incomplete and in pieces, but with lots of potential.

It's a Japanese Domestic model, and the rarer of the two JDM speedtimer variants of this model, the so-called Kakume with the lumed champagne dial and arrow-tip hands. The far more common one is the unlumed model with the chromed black-stripe hands. What was even better about this one was that the case appeared to be unpolished, and the dial was unfaded. The orange especially will fade like crazy with too much sun. So, good case, unfaded dial. All the hands except the arrow-tip hour hand were gone, so I had to replace those, but I'd been hoarding supplies against this need for a long time.

So, a service, replacement hands, crystal, and seals. Deep cleaning of everything. Sounds simple, but it was a solid amount of work. It's not done done done, the lower minute-counter hand is vintage but isn't Seiko-made. I'll keep looking to source an NOS set of subregister hands. But for now it's totally OK.

Now for the right bracelet.

Basically someone had gotten this watch, and they weren't someone who should have been fiddling with watches.  First clue to this are the huge tool marks on the caseback.  Someone didn't have a caseback tool, and tried to get the caseback open with a screwdriver or similar.  They'd also managed to scratch a few of the plates inside.  And they'd lost the hands.  In the process of removing the sweep hand they'd bent the tip of the pinion of the chronograph wheel.  But thank goodness they didn't do any horrible damage to anything.  They'd lost a bunch of stuff, but all the things that mattered were there and intact.   So, after some repair work on certain parts, and then a full servicing on everything (and a deep cleaning of all case elements, I put it back together.

It would never have occurred to me to have told him what he could and couldn't have in his room, or to have even thought about it. This wasn't him asking nicely, with an explanation, it was a statement of what was going to happen.

This was a long time ago now, coming on twenty years, and this kind of behavior and entitled thinking wasn't anywhere near as prevalent as it seems to be now. I'd never encountered it before. If I'd given in, I would have been setting a precedent where he'd be entitled to tell me what I could or couldn't do in my own private space, and would have validating the idea that his feelings overruled my own rights.  That he decided to take this stand over a coincidental use of a symbol that in that usage had nothing to do with what he was thinking about was something that made me even more hesitant to give in.  My point to him was that he was worried about this symbol, which in this usage had nothing to do with WW2, while he was simultaneously giving money to a company that was not just in with the Nazis but was a wholesale creation of them, and was complicit in the holocaust.

He did fine, according to his [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Denny_%28actor%29)

&gt;Denny was a well-known actor in silent films and with the advent of talkies, he became a character actor. He played the lead role in a number of his earlier films, generally as a comedic Englishman in such works as Private Lives and later had reasonably steady work as a supporting actor in dozens of films, including The Little Minister (1934) with Katharine Hepburn, Anna Karenina (1935) with Greta Garbo, Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940) and the Frank Sinatra crime caper film Assault on a Queen (1966). His last role was in Batman (1966) as Commodore Schmidlapp*. He made frequent appearances in television during the 1950s and 1960s.

He also founded a radio-controlled airplane company, which made many drone planes including a drone designated the [OQ-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioplane_OQ-2) during WW2.

2220,"Thanks, thank you, we're improving.  It was freakishly nightmarish, all of it.

I'd like to see the all-blue and the black.

The bracelet is nice quality but it's too wide for me.  I prefer 18mm bracelets, of the old kind.  They're more comfortable for me.  The stock bracelet is sort of a fat taper, and adds a lot of weight to the watch.  Since the SRPs are based on the 6309 (designed in 1976), and the 6309 case is a modified version of a mix between the 6138-001x and the 6105-811x (both late 60s designs), a vintage bracelet works very well.  The H-link was designed in the late '60s and made all the way up to the late 1970s.  So, it's a perfect fit, at least for me.  I think that visually a vintage bracelet really works to bring out the lovely round outline of the case.  It doesn't distract from the watch head, and it shows the vintage heritage of the overall design.

The misaligned chapter ring is because this watch is basically an updated SKX-series watch, with new outer case dimensions.  The chapter rings are the same in both watch model lines.  The chapter rings have an alignment button at 12:00, and it's a loose fit into the depression in the case.  Unlike the 6309s, which had a metal ring with tight tolerances and an alignment tab at 2:00, this SKX / SRP setup is sloppy.  As a result, the ring will shift.

2227,"We've had a tough month.  My dad died at the end of February, basically without notice.  We knew he was sick / not right, but no idea how sick until it was far too late.  He refused to admit anything was wrong, or go to the doctor.  When we finally forced him to go to the hospital, it was months too late.  He was gone in 20 hours.  

My kids were very close with him, and this whole thing was just nightmarishly terrible.  We'd previously planned to go on vacation, despite not being vacation people (our last was five years ago), but with Dad's death that got put on hold.  But we put our feet down and went anyway.  We needed the break, we needed for the kids to have some relief, and my dad would have said ""you take care of your kids!"".  So we did that.

To be a total contrarian, I went with only one watch, just one that I could wear the whole time.  I took my new SRP775, bought for my son who is due to arrive in June.  I'm extraordinarily paranoid about getting watches near water, but mastered myself, and took it into the Pacific.  It did fine, unsurprisingly.   Excellent accuracy as well.  I haven't adjusted or done anything to the watch, only worn it.  Some people asked me to adjust it, so see how accurate I could get it, but I'm just not a fan of opening watches that don't need to be opened.  An automatic mechanical won't hold atomic time anyway, especially not one at this price point.  If I need to time engine burns I'll use quartz.

The watch was comfortable, pleasant, accurate, and useful.  I have it on a vintage Stelux H-link, as I do with all my vintage divers.  If you have been considering buying one of these new 77's, do it.  They're worth the money.",2016-03-19 16:22:31+00:00,d15rqon,1.0,t3_4b3nbe,590.0,Watches

But if they were, I've never seen any wartime P38s explode or crack or fail, and I've owned plenty of late-war pieces, especially the ones made by Spreewerk / CYQ, a factory known for using slave labor.  The CYQ ones are the only pieces I've ever seen with the ""failed inspection"" mark on parts, an asterisk-type punch marking.  These parts were sent back through the line to get redone, and if they passed they were used.  I've owned several late CYQ's with these, sometimes multiple parts.  Every wartime gun I've owned has been a bringback, and all functioned perfectly.  Based on the guns I've owned, shot, handled, and heard about, German mil-spec was a serious thing.  Even a super late-war K98 with a stock barely hogged out of wood, with rough spiraling all the way around, shot beautifully.  Very late 1944.  

The P1's were upgraded, but they'd been in use with the Bundeswehr for decades and they would be in a position to see how these post-war guns performed with military rounds.  ",2016-03-14 04:09:39+00:00,d0yzp91,5.0,t1_d0yv7cu,8456.0,guns

The high-end 25j 6106 movements used in early 6106 dress watches, DX and the like, don't use a bushing or a jewel either, it's maddening.

I'm just a Seiko fanboy?  Not a true Seiko enthusiast?  And the dividing line between the two is whether one likes or dislikes the new 77x's?

The new 77's are as tough as anything else Seiko ever made.  The 4R movement is an upgunned refined version of the 7S, itself merely the latest iteration in a movement lineage that is four decades old, absolutely proven under all circumstances.  

SKX's are cheap because they're heavily discounted and have been for years.  The 77's were *just released*.  The two MSRPs are almost identical, even now.

2775,"With each of my daughters, I had a new watch. Our first, by accident, coincided with an SKX007. I'd sold that watch for some stupid reason by the time our second came around, but regretting this and not being able to buy back the one I'd sold, I'd bought a new one.  I was wearing it when our second was born. I then bought the first 007 back from the guy I'd sold it to. So each kid has an SKX just for them.  When we found out that my wife was pregnant last Fall, it coincided with Seiko releasing the SRP775. I bought one as soon as they were available, for this new child. Who, as we just found out, is a boy. So, I'm borrowing my son's first watch today.

2803,"Thanks for the excellent shots, I appreciate you taking the time.

The brown case has been polished, the blue appears to be original or just about the best repolish I've ever seen.  You can tell by the direction of the brushing on the lower bevel below.  Straight is wrong, radial is right.

It's interesting because the under the blue's crystal is a mix of original and aftermarket stuff.  For example, the sweep, hour, and minute hands are aftermarket.  The subregister hands have been painted.  The dial looks good but I can see that the two layers are misaligned, and that's typically a sign of an aftermarket dial, but the printing looks good, and normally the printing is never good.  I'd have to see it.  

There is someone in the Philippines who has started doing excellent casework.  A lot of the ""NOS Sample"" cases on eBay are their work.  What they're doing is taking the actual sample cases, using everything except the unusable ""SAMPLE""-stamped casebacks, and then putting those casebacks on reworked cases and selling the lie.  I have bought a few, because they were cheap, and wanted to see them - the work really is good.  Sad that they're putting their talents towards doing this specifically to cheat people.

I didn't say anything about the piece, I should have.  The history is lost - the watch came off of eBay out of someone who bought estate stuff.  Someone in the USA liked this watch enough to have it serviced multiple times and then to wear the heck out of it, but they also took care of it.  It's rare to have a very nice dial with perfect lume hide a worn movement, but that's what happened here.  Watch needed several unusual movement parts including the day/date quickset lever, and it was generally worn.  It's all better now, but someone loved this watch.

2861,"I'm a watchsmith, so adjusting is adjusting.  You need to have the right tools, the knowledge and experience to do it correctly.  It's not something that anyone should just randomly try.  For most people it shouldn't matter, and I would say it's not important.  They're great watches, and people have worn unadjusted Seikos for years without an issue.  These are automatic mechanicals, they're going to have variance no matter what.  It is impossible to get them to run to COSC standards.  Some people (especially the lunatics at WUS for example) are accuracy freaks and work to get this tier of watch to accuracies of a few seconds a day.  That's insane, and undoable.  Don't worry about it.

What gives a watch personality is wear, usage.  The Japanese talk about [""Wabi-Sabi""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi).  Character given by usage, handling.  It is valued, and important, though mostly when a watch has gentle signs of use, not when it's looks like it was thrown into a rock tumbler.

I handle so many Seikos, and so many of the same model that have lived different lives.  This can produce watches that look and feel very different even though they started out the same.  Some are awesome, but some just seem dead or to lack any compelling beauty.  Others have a sort of glow of wonderfulness to me, and it stems from their condition, how they were handled, the wear (amount and kind of wear) they show.

2862,"I haven't opened it up yet, but I plan to so that I can adjust it.  These aren't adjusted, Seiko doesn't do adjustments on this tier of watch.

I put the watch on the timegrapher the minute it came out of the box and I'd wound it up, and it had some minor beat error and some gain.  After a few days wearing, the beat error was still there (about 0.4) but the gain had turned to loss.  I'm going to let it run in for a few weeks on the wrist and then adjust, and see how it does.  

It's beautiful, but I'm so used to vintage watches, which all have personalities.  This is a brand-new watch and has zero personality or uniqueness.  It's just a new watch.  So, it seems sort of blank to me.   I'm still very happy with having bought it, and with time it'll settle in.  ",2016-01-15 16:55:23+00:00,cyzcuf9,3.0,t1_cyzceqy,606.0,Watches

Typically for me they're flat, but there's a lot of wear both in the arbor ports, mostly the lower one, and also slop between the arbor and the barrel itself.  When I've seen severely coned mainsprings I've also seen the barrel itself forced open.  I've seen this twice in the past month, which is an unusually high number.  Mostly I just see a filthy mainspring, a sloppy barrel, and a worn lower arbor port.

I don't know why Seiko decided to only bush the upper port, not the lower.  I'm wondering if it was a deliberate choice to save a few pennies per watch.  Having two different wear rates on each end of an arbor is just stupid.  Of course the damned thing is going to wear unevenly and start twisting sideways.  With bushings in place it would be a huge improvement, never mind jewels.  How much would it have cost Seiko to have done this?  But I know, Seiko wants future sales, not repairs of already sold watches.  It's still my biggest gripe about Seiko, along with their total unwillingness to continue parts support.

Stupidly, the designers combined this with a lower mainspring arbor port that wasn't even provided with a bushing.  It's just a hole in the brass main plate.  So the torque / push from the mainspring twists the mainspring sideways, and the arbor grinds away at that lower port, and then you need to do a major repair.  /u/Hal0eight is doing a lot of work to get the jewels needed to do this critical repair.

2884,"This arrived today, and honestly I'm mostly amazed because I never thought it would actually happen. But it did. Bought from Watches88 for the price, which was $360 shipped, much better than the scalpers on eBay. Shipping was amazingly fast, three days via FedEx. The watch traveled from Malaysia, flew over Vietnam to Alaska, then to Memphis, and then here.

I spent the morning after it arrived just checking it out, looking it over. Generally the finish is great. It does have the chapter ring alignment issue that so many people are talking about. This is because it uses the same alignment tab / hole setup that the SKX's used, which wasn't very precise. The chapter ring can be re-aligned but I'm not going to worry too much about it now.

Watch is lovely on the wrist. The stock bracelet was too burly for me so I put on an NOS vintage Stelux H-link with custom endpieces that I'd been saving. This is the same way I have my 6309s and 6105s set up, so it's how I'm most comfortable.

The watch is attractive, and awesome. I'm glad I bought mine, it's a great start to the year. Things I particularly like:

* Absolute adherence to the original 6309 dial layout but with a 3D look.  Big fan of the raised lume and markers
* patterned finish on the insert as with the originals, as well as with the inward slope of the insert, again as with originals.
* Big fan of the stacked ""X"" pyramid, but I have a problem with odd numbers, threes especially.  Balanced design is very attractive to me.
* Love that it has a 4R hacking / handwinding movement.
* Drilled lugs, though I'm sort of on the fence about it.  

I have some quibbles, of course:

* high-polish hands with curved tops. I was hoping for what the stock shots seemed to show - flat-topped satin finish.
* the curved undersides of the case are more rounded, less sloped, than the original 6309 design, less pleasing, but it's a very minimal change
* Crown at 3:45 instead of 4, but I understand that Seiko was saving steps and minimizing new tooling to basically take an SKX and redo the outside while dropping a 4R inside to replace the identically-proportioned 7S movement
* Caseback text is etched, not stamped.  Wish it was stamped.  I'm leaving on the caseback sticker to protect it.
* Bracelet is very heavy and wide (for me), and uses the stupid ""pin and collar"" system.  That's why I went with a vintage Stelux H-link with custom endpieces.

Helios branding with a Precimax 300 under the hood.  Watch has fixed lugs, plated brass case, stainless caseback.  One of the two fixed lugs had broken, and I have replaced it with all I had to hand - sterling silver rod stock.  Movement was in generally decent shape though it suffered from moisture intrusion.  I need to disassemble the crown and put a new seal in place, but for now it's OK.  Movement was a runner though the balance staff is worn.  Thankfully this staff is available along with most of the other parts of this movement, so while it's serviced and a decent runner, it will be even better soon.  One of the cool things is that it was entirely original when it got here, including the caseback seal - which was made of lead.

No one paid him any attention, he was sort of like mobile furniture.

My brother stared at him for a second, and then checked the cables.  The positive terminal was dirty and not firmly bolted down.  He corrected that, and hey whaddya know... power.

The -8110 design was entirely new and Seiko-only, different from the 8000 case externally in almost every way except for the crystal, caseback, insert, and lug width.  Externally, the -811x case is most closely related to the 6138-001x, both using very similar geometry, and both designed in 1969.  

Both 6105s use the same dial, but that dial is only superficially similar to the later 6309 dial, designed in 1976.  Different text, markers, proportions, shapes.  6105 had applied / raised elements, 6309 totally flat and printed. 

The 6309 and 6105-8000 dial and case designs are different in every way that matters.  Most critically, whatever derivation there may be, the fact remains that the 6309 was wholly designed in 1976.  The only external element that it shares 100% with the 6105 is the rotating ring insert, and then only if you use the shim under it.

I've owned basically every variant it's possible to own, including several 6306s.  My collecting focus is kind of unusual in that I prefer N. American variants if I can get them, if they existed.

Something that happened this year that struck me as really weird and annoying - the 7S replacement movements (their generic ""NH"" equivalents) stopped being available from parts houses.

The 4R and 6R movements use a different stem, and there's no way to trade stems between the two.  

But now it makes sense.  No more SKX divers, no more 7S movements, new main line diver coming that used a 4R.  That's my guess.

If you're going to get a 007, I'd say go for it now.  Maybe find a first-gen one though with the ""A"" movement.  Better balance setup.

As a side note, one of the things that Seiko has persistently gotten wrong in the past is dial text.  Too much of it, cluttered dials (look at the MM300, it's why I don't own one anymore).  But the stacked symmetrical dial text used here, same as the awesome SUN019 (one of my favorites), is really pleasing.  I like the X logo, the pyramid stack.

To have a 6309 style watch but without the 6309 movement will be sort of a dream come true.

3318,"A couple of decades ago, my buddies and I founded a Vespa club.  It was a guys thing, for my buddies and me.  Wrenching, beer, bars, scootering.  It grew, and we started having big scooter events, into the hundreds of scooters, and every year it got bigger.  Now, the girlfriends of the guys for the most part self-formed into a sort of women's auxiliary to our purely social scooter club (not my GF, she did her own thing).  Over time, as we got bigger and more popular with more events going on, and despite have about zero interest in restoring old machines or working on scooters or talking scooters etc, the girlfriends wormed their way into being sort of a leadership cabal.   They took over.  Their boyfriends (my buddies) let them, and eventually all true power flowed through this women's auxillary.  Remember the group of old women in ""Tale of Two Cities"", the ladies who would knit while the guillotine blades fell?  That was them.  

Despite having no real interest in scooters, the scooter scene, mechanical restoration, etc this group of people came into leadership roles.  They turned it into a power clique for themselves, and managed it firmly, according to their own mostly unwritten rules.  Anyone on the outs with them was pushed out of the scene.  

Seems like something like that happened here.

EDIT: as a side note, the club was used to grow a new club that was, entirely coincidentally, entirely under the control of the same people but even more so since they were the ""founders"".  Once it was viable, the scooter club was made vestigial, and then shut down.  I'd moved away years before this happened.",2015-10-23 16:25:47+00:00,cwa6q1s,2.0,t1_cwa3cjk,5069.0,KotakuInAction

3367,"A seal has two sealing surfaces - the inside and the outside.  Water can still migrate into the crown and around the outside of the old seal, and then fill the crown and run down the inside of the crown tube.  That your watch passed a pressure test, assuming it was done correctly, is not an endorsement of a jury-rigged repair to a critical piece of your case defense against water.  

If the teflon tape is completely blocking the entry to the crown, it still could be compromised if the crown moved at all.  Teflon tape in plumbing is used in situations where it will not be called on to keep resistance between moving surfaces.  The 6105 crown does not screw down.  That Seiko made a complete redesign of the crown for the later 6309 shows how flawed a non screw-down crown was.  You knock it on something, move it or turn it, and those moving surfaces allow water in.  And even atmospheric moisture can do serious damage to a watch, trust me.  You don't have to flood the thing to kill it.

These watches are valuable and important, and worth more every day.  I don't support your solution, and will tell anyone who has one of these to absolutely not try it, because it's worth every penny it cost.  Treating a 6105 like what happens to it is not important, to trust a no-cost repair during a pressure test, is not something I would ever support.

3580,"OH boy, have I.

OP, /u/ArkJasdain is correct to say to leave the chronograph running.

The issues these have is that they are built around a critical non-serviceable component.  When they fail, they fail from the clutch failing in the chronograph wheel. This is a pre-assembled multi-part component with a physical clutch w/ clutch spring in the heart of it.  When that spring fails, the part is junk and must be replaced. This requires that the movement be rebuilt.  The part, either 888610 (""A"" version) or 888612 (""B"" version), is decades out of production.  They are not easy to find, and are expensive.  

When the chronograph is stopped, that clutch spring is being compressed, stressing it.  It is less wearing, less potentially dangerous to the movement, to simply let it run.  Additionally, when the entire chronograph wheel is turning it is doing so with the pivots / pinions in jewels, top and bottom.  When the chronograph is stopped part of it continues to turn, but it is metal-on-metal.  Best to just leave it running.

As for servicing, these should be serviced if the servicing history is unknown so that you are starting fresh.  Then it should be serviced ideally every five years, and the seals checked at the same time.",2015-09-12 01:32:55+00:00,cuykyoy,4.0,t1_cuyjqxh,2550.0,Watches

3601,"The defininition you are using comes from Wikipedia.  Here is the quote: "" A basic definition of a global circumnavigation would be a route which covers roughly a great circle, and in particular one which passes through at least one pair of points antipodal to each other.""  The key qualifier is this: *""in particular*"".  In other words, ideally an antipodal trip is made but it is not a core requirement that defines whether or not the journey counts as a cirumnavigation.

3638,"I actually got extraordinarily lucky with this transaction.  It was right when this whole satisfaction guarantee thing started, it was brand-new then.  I was not issuing a refund, and eBay at that exact moment hadn't instituted the automatic chargeback thing via paypal that they put in later on.  So, it was up to me to fulfill this promise of eBay's, which I was disinclined to do believe me.  Well, a guy from eBay actually calls me.  He calls me up and talks to me about how I just need to issue the refund and then *eBay will credit me for the amount of the sale*.  Huh?  Oh, ok, if that's the case, then sure OK why not.  So I issue the refund, and call eBay back to tell them I'd done it, and when would I be receiving my payment from eBay for doing what they wanted me to do.  Well, the person on the other end is like ""um...that's not the policy and that's not how it it works, you gave the refund, and that's it."".  So I of course get pretty stiff about it, tell them what I was told to do, and that I did as I was told.  They put me on hold, and they go and apparently listen to the phone call where the eBay guy told me this.  And they get back on, and say ""yeah, he screwed up BUT because he screwed up and made this promise, we'll honor it."".  

And they paid me my $1240, and I got the bow back anyway.  Happy ending?  Sure.  But if that guy hadn't screwed up, I would have been done.  I counted my blessings, thanked all the lucky stars I could think of, and took it as a sign to avoid selling on eBay ever again.

3639,"That's a pretty stupid seller.  Sellers have no power, none.  He's a power seller?  His DSR is a big deal, affects the costs he pays, affects how his items how up in ""Best Match"" results.  The worst he can do is ban you, but you can seriously mess him up.  Stupid seller.

I once accidentally listed a diamond and gold ring, a genuine one.  Stupidly instead of starting the auction at my usual $9.99, I listed it as a *Buy It Now* for $9.99.  Sold immediately.  I ate it, that's what I get for screwing up.  And your seller was either unwilling to make that same (correct) decision, or was trying to cheat you.

But I was a big fan of the equality of the old days.  There was real incentive for people to work stuff out, and generally everything was worked out back then.  I've been buying &amp; selling on eBay since Fall 1998.  In the beginning, the whole thing was built on individuals, and on trust.  There was no paypal.  When I bought something, I'd have to truck down to the post office, buy a money order, and mail it off, trusting that the seller would get it and ship my stuff.  They did, they always did.  I never had a problem.  As a seller back then, I would only leave negative feedback for a really serious problem, something that I felt I needed to warn other sellers about.  I can't do that now.  But as a buyer I can seriously damage a seller's account, and they have no recourse, nothing.

As I've said repeatedly, I love being a buyer on eBay, but being a seller is just awful.",2015-09-04 18:52:57+00:00,cuqqhkb,3.0,t1_cuqpxl8,835.0,AdviceAnimals
3640,"They can just move on, and buy from someone else, and there is no way to warn any other sellers that the buyer is toxic.  That level of buyer protection has been stripped away.  Buyers have pretty much no incentive to be nice, if they're not inclined to be.  The most effective tool the sellers have now is the Blocked Bidders List, but that's just about it.

eBay has shown for years now that they do not value sellers, or at least nowhere near as much as they value buyers.  They want buyers badly, as many as they can get.  The moment they decided to guarantee the buyer experience with the eBay guarantee (you get what you wanted or your money back, even if what you got is exactly what you said you wanted) then sellers became the enemy.  eBay made a huge financial promise with that money-back guarantee, and in order to minimize their exposure, needed to really come down hard on the side of the buyer.

I first experienced this when it was first introduced with a pretty nasty shock.  I inherited a double-bass bow for playing a string bass.  It was worn, and old, and needed serious repair.  The horse-hair was mostly broken.  I photographed it showing every detail, including the maker mark, and specifically stated that I didn't know anything about this item, because I didn't.  I started the auction at $9.99.  Well, the damn auction finished at $1240.  The buyer paid immediately, and I shipped it off to him.  A professional musician in NYC.  He got it, immediately said it was fake, that I'd sold a fake item, and demanded a refund.  I naturally told him that I'd described it as best I could, that I'd taken lots of very good shots, that I wasn't an expert and that *he hadn't asked a single question before buying*.

eBay told me I had to give the refund.  That was pretty much the last sale I made on eBay for this kind of thing.  I still sell, but through other channels, by other means.  eBay valued that guy's money more than my item, and made me pay for his poor decisions.  It made it ok for him to gamble, but I paid the cost.

The last item I sold on eBay was my old iPhone 4.  Guy got the phone, and I heard nothing, not until the 60-day inspection window had just closed.  Then I get a message from him, saying the phone is locked, that it's still on my account, that he can't use it.  I check, it's absolutely not on my account, it was wiped, it was clean.  He insisted it wasn't, that I'd sold him a locked phone.  And then he demanded my Apple ID *and password*.  I told him absolutely not, and he left me negative feedback.  I had no recourse, no protection, nothing.  That strike stays on for a year.  The guy was a liar, tried to get my info, tried to cheat me, and in the end the only one who suffered was me.  Thanks eBay.

3643,"It's against eBay rules to pad shipping charges.  eBay might not do anything about it, but as a buyer you have nearly unlimited god-like powers over sellers.  You hold all of the cards, every last one of them.  Sellers can try to pull that in order to make back eBay fees and then some (that's what they're doing), but you have numerous tools to make them drop that shipping price or seriously regret trying it.  

As a seller, eBay is a nightmarish hellhole filled with all kinds of financial dangers and essentially no seller protection.  There is no god of sellers, no one for them to turn to when they're let down and betrayed by eBay's anti-seller BS.  Why anyone still sells there is a testament to the near-monopoly eBay has on this kind of internet marketplace.

I have been on eBay for sixteen years, and I have sold untold amounts of stuff there.  Once eBay took away a seller's ability to leave negative feedback, I stopped selling immediately.  They've only made it worse since then.  There are no protections, no guarantees, no help.  Only massive fees and a crowd of buyers waiting to screw you over.  

Now, as a buyer I *LOVE* eBay.  I buy on eBay all the time, nearly daily.  There's no reason not to.  But that's because eBay has stacked the deck so firmly in favor of buyers.  eBay doesn't value their sellers, I'd go so far as to say that institutionally eBay *hates* their sellers.

OP, the watch is a mish-mash of bits and parts.  Sweep hand is the big giveaway for an issue, as it's aftermarket.  You can tell by the fact that the top surface is domed / rounded, not flat.  Also note that the hand tube protrudes slightly, and the overall shape of the hand is sort of melted-looking.  Definitely aftermarket.  BUT note that the dial &amp; hand lume all matches.  So, I'd be willing to bet it's relumed.  The auction text is weasely about this *""About the beautiful  6105 dial and hands i dont need to spend many words...they are immaculate,without aging marks!The hands was regenered from expert watchmakers.""* - so redone, therefore aftermarket, all of them.  Also, the insert in the rotating ring appears original, but is not original to that watch.  You can see that's it is standing too tall in the ring, and the outer edge is standing above the edge of the ring.  It is probably a 6309 insert, as they were thicker than the 6105 inserts.  The seller says it's original, but doesn't say it is original to that watch.  Clever, and deceptive.

This auction has all the red flags I associate with a deceptive seller and an inferior product:

* lots and lots of text that doesn't tell us what we think it tells us
* magazine-grade photography that makes the watch look pretty but actually works to hide key details.  Note the sweep hand is never clearly shown, for one thing.
* Obvious aftermarket additions, such as a modern folded H-link bracelet and sweep hand
* Very high buy-it-now price

I wouldn't go near this watch on a bet, and I'd stay very clear of that seller.  And come visit /r/Seiko!

My brother was in town and we had some family stuff going on.

Your watch is one that's been worked on.  The daywheel is genuine Seiko because these parts were only ever made by Seiko, period.  But it is for the JDM Speedtimer model, not any other bullhead.  It's actually a fairly rare part in its own right.  The watch has definitely had some work done.  The dial looks to have been relumed (blobby lume on the markers especially :40 I believe), and the hands are all aftermarket / non-Seiko.  The sweep hand especially shows this.  

So, it's not a frankenstein per se but it's definitely modded a bit and it's not original by any stretch.

I'd personally say it's deeply connected to the banning of FPH.  That was, IMO, the first blow where Reddit really reacted viscerally to what she was doing.  That primed the pump.  Then things started normalizing a bit (mostly due to massive censorship and post suppression) right up until Victoria Taylor was shitcanned and the Blackout started.  It's one thing to shadowban people right and left, and relentlessly prune submissions, but whole default subs blacked out?  Hard to ignore.  

Pao had already rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, and her wrong-headed decisions on these and other things pushed people to sign that petition and this in turn generated a lot of negative publicity.

3910,"&gt;Some linguistic prescriptivists and students of ancient Greek argue that, given that hoi is a definite article, the phrase ""the hoi polloi"" is redundant, akin to saying ""the the masses"". Others argue that this is inconsistent with other English loanwords. The word ""alcohol"", for instance, derives from the Arabic al-kuhl, al being an article, yet ""the alcohol"" is universally accepted as good grammar; relevant differences, however, are that a) hoi polloi is transliterated but otherwise unmodified, whereas alcohol is altered in both pronunciation and associated spelling to form an independent word, and b) hoi polloi is left standing as a multiple-word phrase, with one word devoted exclusively to the function of the definite article, whereas in alcohol the grammatical particle serving as an article is assimilated into the (heavily modified) word.[10]",2015-07-05 04:10:10+00:00,cssk6nl,4.0,t1_cssjvif,842.0,Blackout2015

This watch, along with the one-button chronograph introduced at the same time, meant that 1964 was the turning point where Seiko went from the old pre-war copycat stuff they made to mimic Swiss output to creating their own unique and superlative designs.  This process continued through the 60s, culminating with the 1969 introduction of the 6138 and 6139 automatic chronographs.  Additionally, this same period saw the creation of the true dive watch, starting with the ""62mas"" 150m dive watch, moving to the slim-case 6105-8000, which moved to the 6105-811x dive watch of ""Apocalypse Now"" fame.

The poster talked about how genuinely sorry they felt for this person, imagining how painful and unpleasant life must have been for them.  It was a surprising comment to see there, a sub without pity or sympathy.

This poster was immediately jumped on by other posters, one of the main sidebar rules against sympathy quoted etc, and the poster backtracked on their display of human empathy and lack of insta-hatred.  They apologized and said in effect  ""hey I was just a stupid kid then, I know better now, you can't blame a stupid kid for not understanding that fatties aren't human"".
