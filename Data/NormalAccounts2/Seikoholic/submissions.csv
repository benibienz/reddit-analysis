I can't explain to you the reason why someone would want to assassinate me however it's true nonetheless. let me explain to you what happens: you're in a room full of people you hear something like a penny drop after you think nothing about it and then you notice that there is a sting in the bottom left side of your cheek and it's kind of swollen. You go throughout your day and you don't think anything about it until you start feeling chest pains your heart has a murmur... you're thinking that its indigestion, heartburn, or gas buildup; however, by the following morning you notice that the area where you were stung (assumingly by a bee) or a wasp is very swollen... And it starts to ache like an infected pimple... You feel dizzy nauseous like you need to vomit however a spine-tingling pricking feeling starts to emit sensations from the epicenter of the sting. if you squeeze hard enough like a pimple, a thick ooze of pus with a black metallic swirl in the runoff of pus. if you're smart and you gather some of the runoff and quickly put it on a lab slide to have it analyzed in a lab, a microscope will reveal the pus has high levels of Mercury. Quite possibly a poison is bound with the Mercury so that when the tiny projectile enters into your system, it dissolves instantly into your living tissue and the mercury and whatever toxic substance thats bound to it it virtually undetectable by a standard autopsy. Within 48 hours most people die some heart, kidney, or bladder complications. Depending on what the toxin is, it may take longer to kill you. I survived for a number of reasons of which I cannot share here otherwise those who use these weapons will how to overcome my life saving counter-actions.ï»¿",copypasta,Heart attack gun,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/5baliw/heart_attack_gun/

She actually seemed conservative, non-degenerate, similar interests so naturally we were pretty smitten. Just last night she dropped the mother of all bombshells on me: She had a two year old son.

I was so disgusted that I felt like throwing up that moment. This woman was 21 years old, the fact that she carried a child to terms in her teens despite knowing the father would not raise it made any positive emotion I felt towards her turn into blind hate. She knew she would be cucking a man in the future with her evil decision to not abort the kid, but she did. not. care.

I told her that if she wanted to continue seeing me, she would have to kill her son. She obviously lost her shit and told me I was crazy. I told her I had no intention of raising another man's child, and as long as the kid was in the picture then it would get in the way. She tried to reach me with every female trick in the book, screaming, crying, pleading, saying I'd love the son if I got to know him (lmao) etc. but I simply did not give a fuck and told her never to contact me again and she's a piece of shit who deserves a lonely death.

I'm still in rage this morning. Single mothers are all useless whores, dregs of society, who push their mistakes on innocent men. The fact that I was tricked by this woman makes me feel violated. Protip, women reading this, if daddy is not going to be around just abort the fucker. These children become profound degenerates as well, criminals, thieves, homosexuals, and race-mixers, and I would be damned to ever tolerate any of those in my household.

Obviously some sympathy is had if the father died, but if he's a POS (like in 99% of cases of single mothers) then I only hope that they both fuck off and stop burdening society.

I had a customer send his in for service, After talking over options, he decided not to go ahead with a restoration.   He was in the Navy during Vietnam (though he served stateside), bought it on base, and wore it during his service and afterward.  He'd wanted to make the watch totally watertight again so he could go diving and swimming with it.  I don't guarantee resistance, and I'm not in favor of vintage divers going into water, so he asked to just sell the piece to me.

They're rarely seen in decent shape, as they had issues with long-term water exclusion.  The dial and hands are almost always ruined, as water is drawn to the salt-based lume, and starts corroding very quickly.  So, most are damaged.  Not this one.

The original owner had it from new, he had it for decades, it wasn't special or amazing. It was just a watch. He'd stopped wearing it in the early 1980s I think, it just sat in a drawer. To him, it was just a watch. I had several conversations with him about the significance of the watch model generally, and the importance of this particular example. I described it as ""investment grade"", not a tool watch, not something to bang round and wear as a daily, and certainly not a diver. He really wasn't that interested, I don't think. He valued the watch, he was sentimentally attached to it, but not enough to consider keeping it if he couldn't use it as he did back when it was new. He wasn't really interested in the full investment he would have needed to make to bring this back, he wanted to cut corners. I more or less said that it should be either all or nothing. All of it, or back into the drawer it goes, don't half-ass it. He just wanted to have it back as a worry-free daily. 

Once I talked him out of that, then he decided he'd prefer to move it on. I was glad to give it a home, though I paid more for this example than I've paid for any 6105 ever. But really, how many more of these are going to come around?

In the mid-1970s, Seiko wanted to update their ""tuna"" professional diver watch invention with a then-new-and-amazing high-torque quartz movement, the 7549, replacing the high-beat 6159 movement used in the 6159-7010 ""Grandfather tuna"" and the 300m 6159-700x.  The 7549 was a quartz built on the back of an automatic design, the 6309, which itself was the latest iteration of the 6xxx-series Suwa design.  Seiko came out with two quartz divers, the 600m ""Golden"" 7549-700x, and the 300m 7549-7010.  Both are collectible and sought after today.  The quartz movement was used because, as a tool watch, the primary function of a dive watch is reliability and accuracy.  A high-torque all-metal quartz provided that.  Top of the line in the 1970s.  But a quartz movement isn't for everyone, and these days it's a barrier to enjoyment for some people.

[This may look like a standard quartz 7549-7010, but it isn't.](http://i.imgur.com/o3qWNc3.jpg)

It came to me from a customer who asked about trading it in against servicing on another watch.  We figured out a number, and this weekend I took some time with it.  It was a dead wreck with a destroyed, partially stripped movement, and ruined hands.  I happened to have a set of good original hands stored, so I started thinking about restoration.  Then last week I won a watch lot that had a nice thing in it, a 6306 Silverwave.  I found that while externally that Silverwave was garbage, the movement was pristine.  The 6306 is a Japan-only modification of the 6309 17j auto movement - a common movement found in a ton of watches around the world.  The 6306 is quite rare, by comparison, and it had some extras - in place of two bushings in the train bridge, it had two diafix settings - four extra jewels - to make 21j total.  The 6306s were also equipped with a hacking lever, a special one that was unique, only used in this model.  Extremely hard to find today.  

OK, so I had my parts.  Now, despite the fact that the 754x is built basically as a modification of the 630x movement, you can't just drop a 7549 dial and handset onto a 630x, it won't work.  Wrong cannon pinion, hour wheel, day wheel snap, and day wheel.  Rare parts.  Which I happen to have found last year.  So the project was doable.  Also, thanks to /u/Hal0eight, I had upper and lower jewels for the mainspring arbor.  So, I decided to go for the super-deluxe upgrade.  I serviced the 6306 movement, and while doing so, installed the mainspring arbor jewels. 

So, [this watch is a 23-jewel hacking automatic.](http://imgur.com/a/Eh9cV)

People often think of the 6105-811x diver and its use in ""Apocalypse Now"", for example.  Seikos were sold on base, at PX's, and they were widely worn by servicemen in the field.  They were prized for their bright lume, their self-winding, and their water resistance.  They were sold on board ships too.  Many 6105s, 6138s, 6309s etc started their working lives on board a military vessel.

During Vietnam, one group of personnel used Seikos exclusively, though this has only been known now in the past few years.  The Special Operations Group, special forces doing recon behind enemy lines, wore a lot of unbranded sterile gear to avoid being ID'd.  They carried WW2 era weapons, theater-made knives, Korean-era tiger stripe camo, civilian Japanese cameras bought on the open market, and Seiko watches.  

All the records of the SOG were destroyed after the war, so a lot of this is known from inference and educated guesses, as well as the memoirs and personal histories of former SOG personnel such as the book ""Running Recon"" where these things were talked about.  Other sources are anecdotes from original owners, or stories of stories, such as the watchsmith who serviced a 6619 Seiko for the son of the original owner, a Recon vet who was issued with the piece in the late 1960s.

They're found now in eBay lots, random batches of old watches.  For example, the rarest of the three variants known to have been issued is a Seiko 7005.  I found mine in such a lot.  It's such a rare watch that I didn't even see it.  I was so focused on the one I wanted that I didn't pay much attention to any of the other watches.  

[Watch lot](http://i.imgur.com/0ApvJSa.jpg)

I've avoided most spoilers and haven't been really engaged here.  I loved FO3 and Skyrim etc, so I assumed that 4 would be a nice next stage.  But either because of how the game is set up, or my innate habits, the game has turned into a job, and sort of a slog.  I've started avoiding playing it, or only playing long enough to maintain my settlements (of which there were more during every long play, hey look another workbench).

Basically FO4 has turned into Cafe World for me, and it sort of sucks.  But I don't blame Fallout (should I), I blame myself.

I'm only at 40 hours in, and I have to believe I've only scratched the surface, but I've been saying this since I got it and it's not improving.

So, what can I do to break the Preston / Settlements prison I've fallen into?  I've considered doing stuff like sending every settler to Sanctuary and making all other settlements impervious, with high defense and zero resources, and Preston locked into one of them with no way out.  If I had my way, I'd just start over again but the thought of doing all that work (yes work, not fun) again stops me.  Aren't games supposed to be fun?

There's a ton of information and collector's input for the variants of the 6309s, all kinds of stuff about the dial codes and caseback markings that tell us if a watch is correct, where it was made, what the sub-variants were.

Turns out the new SRP77x's do as well.

I got my SRP775K1 from Watches88.com.  It's a World or non-N.American version with Roman / English daywheel.  A customer just showed me pictures of his, also an SRP775, which he bought from Sears here in the USA.  It is different in some subtle ways.  Both were made in November 2015.

My dial code is ""4R36-04Z4 R 2"".  His is ""MOV'T JAPAN 4R36-04Z8 R 2""

My caseback says ""4R36-04Y0 A0"".  His says ""4R36-04Y0 AO MOVEMENT JAPAN"".

My daywheel is Roman / English.  His is Spanish / English.  

Almost every shot I find online shows the ""world"" version, not the Sears version, which I'm assuming is a N. American model.  Here's the only shot I could find of a N. American version, and it's a different model, but it does show the longer dial text line:

It was made in at least four configurations, being altered to drop the overall height several times.  

My business partner and friend, Jonathan Koch, ID'd the variants from observation and collected discarded examples.  He called them ""Type I - IV"".  Type I's were very high, 3.8mm, and were what he called a ""chip magnet"".  He said that when they were new, people were bringing in their watches with chips in just a few weeks.  Seiko only used the Type I's from 1968 to about mid-1970.  They then dropped the height, creating the ""Type II"".  Later on they got lower, becoming the ""Type III"".  There was also a ""Type IV"", the main difference between III and IV was that the former was slightly domed, and the latter totally flat-topped.

Based on observation, the Type II was used from mid-1970 all the way into 1975.  A huge percentage of 6105s would have had this crystal.  But Jonathan didn't choose to have the Type II's recreated.  For some reason, he was certain they weren't made for very long, and there wasn't a real need for them.  However, over the past few years since he died and we have owned his crystals, with only two exceptions every single original 6105-811x that has come through here has had a Type II.

So, we have had them recreated.  These are Hardlex mineral crystal, made in Switzerland, identical to originals in every way.  Polished top and bevel, frosted contact faces, domed internally, flat-topped.

In the old days when these watches were current / recent production, if you wanted a new crown seal you just ordered a whole new crown and put it in.  But the crowns are decades out of production, and the aftermarket ones from the Philippines are wrong internally and won't drop flush with the case.  So you were stuck with an old bad seal, or an NOS crown at a pretty serious expense (and with a decades-old seal in place), or Philippines aftermarket.  Most people have just lived with the old crown, and as a result a huge percentage of 6105s experienced water through the crown, and subsequent lume damage and movement damage.  It's one of the main reasons that it is so hard to find an original 6105 with good dial and hand lume.

Two friends / business partners over in the UK have come up with a brand-new process to allow the crown seals to be renewed in 6105-811x dive watches.  Previously, this couldn't be done as there was no way to open the crowns (permanently closed), and the seals they took were unknown.  

Now, your original crown can be renewed and put back onto your watch with a new seal inside.  I've been able to do this for about four days.  This is a huge deal, a game-changer.

These are just great watches.  Sometimes people get sniffy about them using the classic Omega layout, and there's definitely that point to be made.  But I always use that inevitable and predictable talking point as a springboard to talk about how different under the hood they are, how ground-breaking and amazing the 7A quartz chronograph movement is.  Rather than try to ape Omega's mechanical movement, Seiko created an entirely new beast, a 15-jewel all-metal movement, heinously overbuilt, with fly-by-wire control.  An amazing feat of mechanical and electrical engineering.

Every WIS should have a 7A, if you ask me.

It didn't have any history with it at the time, it was just a very rough 6105 in a badly-listed auction, and I didn't get a bargain, though I didn't pay 6105 prices.  It had no history with it, the seller was clearing out stuff from a relative's estate it seemed.

I'd gotten a 6105 like this before, in this same sort of shape, and it had belonged to a commercial welder, someone who worked in a shop.  That's sort of what I assumed happened here.  Case was rough, everything was deeply dirty, crown &amp; stem were gone... but there was hopefully hope.

I got it in, and yowza it was rough.  Not running at all, unusual for a Seiko even in this condition.  Missing the rotating ring and spring, the tip of the sweep hand was gone.  The lume was deeply gross - green / grey.  Thankfully the dial surface wasn't bad.  Indices were definitely ok, and printing was nice and bright.  The SEIKO was still clean &amp; frosted.

Parts for these aren't easy to come by but the rotating rings are especially tough to find.  Thankfully, a network of friends helped me out, and pointed me to an auction for an empty case with a rotating ring.  I wrote the seller to ask about any information on the history of the watch, but didn't expect to hear back.

Got that, and then did my initial restoration.  The movement was rough, as I expected, complete with a bad balance, pallet fork, 4th wheel, mainspring barrel complete, and date wheel.  And of course a missing crown &amp; stem.  And an incomplete sweep hand.  Also, the mainspring arbor ports were terribly worn.  Thanks to /u/Hal0eight, I had replacement arbor jewels, so those went in.  While I was in there, I jeweled the entire train, again following Adrian's lead.  This watch is now a 21j.

At this point, I got a contact back from the seller - the watch had belonged to an uncle.  He'd been a Seabee and had served in-country in Vietnam.  No wonder this thing was rough.  They built landing strips and bases for the Marines, did a lot of heavy work, and also fighting.  My brother-in-law was a Seabee, he flat-out refused to talk about the war or the things he saw there.

I'd kept the lume original since so few of these have their original lume, but the deeply damaged look of it bothered me, but I really wanted to work to love it.  I tried, I did, but I could tell the watch would get no wrist time looking the way it did.  So, I was preparing to sell it since I'd never wear it.  Then I looked very closely at the dial.  Despite having cleaned the dial surface thoroughly, there were now dark circles around all of the markers.  I got out the binocular microscope.  Under magnification, I could see that the dark circles were oil, and that the lume was oil-soaked.  The dial wasn't water-damaged, it was oil damaged.  So, the lume had to go, it was a danger to the watch.  A nice thing about oil-soaked lume is that it has the consistency of old toothpaste, and pops right out of the lume wells.  Good lume is like cement.  This stuff came out like putty.  This confirmed that I'd made the right choice.

I'm wondering if they're doing this because of a potential Aliens movie with Weaver et al coming up.

The original was a 7A28-powered quartz chronograph, designed by Guigiaro.  Seiko put a lot of time and effort into creating these watches, and the 1980s were a golden age for Seiko in the movies.  As an update to an old post I made [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/15qax1/i_give_you_three_of_the_four_seiko_watches_worn/), I'm posting about all four Seiko watches worn in the ""Aliens"" movie as a reference as I've found the missing piece, the Pulsemeter watch as worn by the Colonial Marines, making my personal quadrilogy complete.

I'm a huge ""Aliens"" fan &amp; a Seiko collector.  Getting the [first three watches](http://i.imgur.com/Lo7dr.jpg) (L to R: Ripley, Bishop, Burke) took about six months of work - purchasing, restoration, sourcing parts, etc.    The last piece, the Pulsemeter, took more than a year of searching before one popped up right in front of me.  Dumb luck.

**Here are some screenshots:**

[Here's Bishop wearing my favorite, the Seiko 7A28-6000](http://imgur.com/v320zaw).  This model was reissued, sort of, last year.  Seiko came out with a [complete line of Limited Edition watches](http://imgur.com/KWtB5rR) based on the Bishop that used a different movement, and also came with a much wider variety of colors.  They only made a few hundred of each, and all sold out immediately.  There's a new batch being made now, and speculation that a regular model will be issued soon.  Nice to see the Bishop return, but there's nothing like having the real thing.

[and here was the only missing piece, a Seiko S234-501A Pulsemeter](http://imgur.com/2vblEPa)

I finally did find one, and it wasn't cheap, but it was the right one.  The problem is that Seiko made several variants of the pulsemeter, and they used some on screen that were modified from the correct original.  Specifically, a closely-related model with yellow buttons was used in some shots where the buttons had been painted black, but the paint wore to show the yellow.  However, the correct watch model is the one that I found, by far the hardest to find - the S234-501A.  It's so hard to find that dummy kits are sold on eBay for $50, or were the last time I checked.

**So, all four now:**

Mostly I was interested because the handset appeared to be the same as that used on the old 7C43 150m divers.

This one came up as a low buy-it-now on eBay, with ""best offer"", sold as defective / not working.  I wanted to see it in person, especially the interesting H-link bracelet.  I made an offer, and the seller accepted.  I expected it'd be DOA, but it was stuttering along when it showed up.  Turns out it just needed to move.  After a bit of hand-winding the power levels rose enough that it started ticking normally, and now a day in it's running just like nothing happened.

One of the nicest elements of this is the sort of throwback dial design, which reminds me a lot of the old [6106-8237s](http://ajmaxkelfin.com/images/Watches/Sold/6106-8239/6106-8239-1.jpg).  They're a bit big for my tastes, but the quality is good, especially the solid-link stainless bracelet.

[eBay image](http://i.imgur.com/bsw4BIq.jpg)

It was incredibly dirty, with filth packed into every crack.  The bracelet was stiff with dirt &amp; grease, and the inside of the one endlink literally solid with dirt.  It almost looked like the watch had been lost and buried for awhile, actually.  But despite that, I could see that under the grot the case was in pretty amazing shape.  These GP cases tend to age badly, with corrosion eating through the plating anywhere it's weak and the base metal underneath melting like salt in water.  This watch, despite having had a hard working life, hadn't had a long working life.  The plating was amazingly good, and the watch looked great after cleaning.

[This is how it looked after a trip through the spa, ad these shots don't do it justice](http://imgur.com/a/pqjiU)

The 5216 is an early high-beat movement, barely under the King Seiko in terms of quality and accuracy.  It doesn't use the ""magic lever"" winding system, but instead a more tradition gear-driven winding assembly.  Makes for a lower profile.  One of the interesting things about this movement is that it was resurrected in the 90s as the 4S family, used in the Alpinist for example.  I can't think of another discontinued movement family that Seiko brought back - looking backwards isn't their thing.  But a nice side-effect of this is that unlike virtually every other movement Seiko ever made, parts are available for this model.  Seiko normally stops parts support even before models are discontinued, but I can buy everything for this watch, all of it.  

The quality on the movement really is amazing - even unserviced and dry as the desert the watch was putting out flat-line accuracy with zero beat error.  Amazing quality.

At 35mm side-to-side, it's well under my sweet spot for wearability but the quality really is clear to see.  Mine has the original bracelet but only one of the special endlinks specially formed for this peaked case profile.

One of the things about the standard quartz conversion of a 6309-704x (dropping in a 7548) that has always left me flat was how ordinary it looked to me.  It's barely different from a 6309, not enough to stand apart.  I'd build them, take them apart, never wear them.  Great idea, but lacking.

Close to two years ago, someone gave me a 6309 case that had had the back drilled out under the click ball.  A nasty thing to see, but you could only see it when the watch was flipped over.  I repaired the hole, and put the case aside to wait for a future project.  About a year later, I got a junked franken watch from Israel.  One of things that was good was the dial - a 7549-7010 300m dial.  A nice thing to have, but nothing else was with it that was usable to remake the original watch movement.  It had been put on a standard 7546 movement with 007 hands, among other stuff.  So, I put it to one side, and started looking for parts whenever it occurred to me.  It would have been nice to have the hands and be able to use them, and Yobokies sells a new set that's nice, so I ordered a set.  But I couldn't use them, of course, not yet.  The 7549's unique handset only works with a special cannon pinion, hour wheel, day wheel, and day wheel snap, all only for that model.  So, a long-term project.

In the meantime, some months on, I found a watch parts lot of a few 6119 dress watches in parts from a watchmakers estate.  Amazingly, in the auction was a complete and amazingly undamaged set of 7549-7010 hands.  Un-freaking-real.  So, now to turn the pressure up on the rest of the project.

Despite every part officially being discontinued, talking to people, getting in contact with their contacts, and following a daisy-chain of suppliers, and generally pestering people as nicely as possible, I was able to get almost everything - cannon pinion, hour wheel, day wheel snap.  All NOS and officially discontinued, but located.  But no daywheels.  No one had them.  My last best hope who had previously pulled some miracles out of thin air for me stated flatly that they were absolutely discontinued.  The person had gone so far as to speak directly to Seiko Japan to ask them to dig around there, and this person said the dream was over.  Without the daywheel the whole project failed.  I boxed up all the bits and put them aside. 

Fast-forward six months, and I randomly get a notification in my email that a backorder was being filled.  Scratch that, TWO backorders.  This happens sort of regularly since I'm always looking for old parts, so I didn't think a lot about it.  Then a package shows up with daywheels, six of them, brand-new in the blister packs.  Holy crap.  Thanks to this haul, I now had at least three complete 754x to 7549 conversion kits.

So, late last night at the end of a long week of watch work, after dinner and bathtimes and bedtimes, I went back to the bench to build a subtle mod.  I'm happy with it.  The last things I'm looking for now are a good original insert, and maybe one of Larry's new H-link bracelets.

The best thing for me is that I did this using only parts, only stuff that was already discarded and considered scrap by other people, and NOS parts that had never been part of a watch before.

In the old days when these watches were current / recent production, if you wanted a new crown seal you just ordered a whole new crown and put it in.  But the crowns are decades out of production, and the aftermarket ones from the Philippines are wrong internally and won't drop flush with the case.  So you were stuck with an old bad seal, or an NOS crown at a pretty serious expense (and with a decades-old seal in place), or Philippines aftermarket.  Most people have just lived with the old crown, and as a result a huge percentage of 6105s experienced water through the crown, and subsequent lume damage and movement damage.  It's one of the main reasons that it is so hard to find an original 6105 with good dial and hand lume.

Two friends / business partners over in the UK have come up with a brand-new process to allow the crown seals to be renewed in 6105-811x dive watches.  Previously, this couldn't be done as there was no way to open the crowns (permanently closed), and the seals they took were unknown.  

Now, your original crown can be renewed and put back onto your watch with a new seal inside.  I've been able to do this for about four days.  This is a huge deal, a game-changer.

The dad had bought it on vacation in the late 1970s in the Bahamas, apparently, and had gone diving with it.  The watch had every hallmark of water exposure - loose dial markers, stained dial, a caseback rusted into place etc.  I'm used to Seiko, and typically a Seiko treated like this will not be a happy watch at all.  But once I finally got the case open I was amazed to see the condition of the movement - serviceable, rather than rusted junk.  This was in large part because of the case design, which was sturdy, and the movement, even sturdier.  I decided to find one of these.

They were made in the late 70s and early 80s, and sold in either a matte finish or PVD.  I've seen black-and-white ads for them in the backs of old magazines.  They were referred to as the ""poor man's Heuer"", since Heuer put out a model that was identical to this in basically every way except the name on the dial.  Same case, same movement etc.  Porsche also put out a branded version of the watch, with different dial printing and a different tachy ring.  They were sort of a standard kind of watch for the time.  Like all things vintage, they're going up in value rapidly, and what used to be easily found were now harder to get in decent shape, and certainly more expensive.

Fast-forward to last week, when /u/mistermeeseeeks listed one for sale over on /r/Watchexchange.  It looked everything like what I wanted in terms of condition and completeness.  Original, unrestored, bought by him from the original owner, in need of servicing etc.  The transaction was easy and fast, and the watch arrived in basically one day.  

Watch was just what I wanted: totally original, never abused.  The Valjoux 7750 17j high-beat chronograph movement was in good shape but totally dry, running at a mere 175-200 for amplitude, and it sounded like a Soviet-made sewing machine.   But no damage, no problems of any kind.  After service it was very quiet and running at a very solid 285 and up.

&gt;In 1966, the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) set up an investigation committee for diving equipment, including dive watches, which back then were deemed not only âa vital partâ of the diverâs equipment, but apparently also the most troublesome. In 1968, BSAC member Geoff Harwood concluded that âthe majority of the complaints and allegations of faulty equipment and unsatisfactory dealings with manufacturers and distributors have been concerned with diving watchesâ â which led to the decision âto carry out a survey in order to determine the extent of the problem.â

&gt;Thanks to former professional diver, dive historian, author, and the U.K.âs historical diving society editor Peter Dick, whom I had the fortune of meeting at the last annual meeting of the German Historical Diving Society (see report here), we at DiveIntoWatches.com can now, nearly 50 years after its first publication, reveal the results of this amazing survey â so far the only such review I have ever come across and also a most unique opportunity to get a glimpse of one of the most important eras in underwater timekeeping.

I mostly was interested in it for the remains of a 6139 but figured the rest might be interesting.  Well, the 6139 was basically total garbage, as was everything else.  The 7606 was the only decent piece, and it had some cosmetic issues that needed serious addressing.  Amazingly the movement was in decent condition, and after servicing it's a great runner.  

These are an orphan movement, related to the 7625s, and somewhat less so to the 66xx movements  - all stuff that predates the rise of the 6105 / 6106 / 6119 / 6159 hi-beats in the late 60s.  They've got a few odd details, such as an independent quickset for the date only, and an unusual multi-part day/date driving wheel that can be destroyed by trying to quickset the date between 9 pm and 3 am.  

Because they've got two buttons (crown and quickset) Seiko moved the crown to :17, rather than :15 or :20 as is normal, and they put the quickset button at :12.  This means that the calendar parts for this movement will *only* work for this movement.  Orphan stuff.  But otherwise they're a clean and elegant machine.  I did all that needed to be done, and then dropped it on an NOS bracelet for a 70s 6309 dress watch.  It'll do until I can get a correct one.

I don't think we need to go private here, though I am not very happy about the current and seemingly future path of Reddit.  Seems like the wild west days of freedom here might be coming to an end.  But who knows.

In any case, I'm not planning on taking the sub private since depriving Reddit of the Good Word of Seiko would be a massive blow after the loss of subs like /r/Iama, /r/AskReddit, and /r/Circlejerk, among many dozens of others.

I'm just not that cruel.  In these dark times, Reddit needs Seiko more than ever.  And we'll be here to provide.

One thing about the watch I can say is that while it shows wear, it doesn't show any abuse.  Unlike most other Seiko owners in the 70s this man took care of his possessions.  He didn't treat this watch like it was a fabrege egg, but he didn't treat it like a disposable piece of junk.
