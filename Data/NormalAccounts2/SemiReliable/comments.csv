Ad absurdum isn't the best way to reach a conclusion.

In your second example, you're assuming the vehicle has a way of determining which impacts are deadly and which ones are not. And if it can, in what case is swerving into a bus any less deadly than hitting a fallen tree? In this case, the more logical and safer option is to immediately break to minimize impact.
