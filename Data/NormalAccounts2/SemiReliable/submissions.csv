Alright, so before we get into this, looking back, I realize a lot of the troubles I'm having are my own doing, but I just need some advice. 

I'm an airman stationed in California and I bought a 2013 Chevy Cruze LT back in March with ~75k miles for $13k. I got my loan through Navy Federal Credit Union and am currently paying for 5 years at a whopping 17.64% interest rate, paying $340/mo.

The car is now up to ~79k miles, and rapidly dropped in value. Down to a KBB value of just over $8k. Now normally I'd just bite the bullet and pay it for a year and then refinance next March, but with the mechanical problems I'm already having, I don't want to stick with it that long. I still owe ~$12.5k.

The interest rate is killing me to the point where I can't adequately afford repairs on the vehicle.

So I can either get rid of it somehow or drastically drop that interest rate some other way. Any advice is welcome.",personalfinance,Got screwed on a car,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51okmv/got_screwed_on_a_car/

I had the ASVAB for it, I had the physical requirements down, and I thought I was good to go. Until I went to MEPS and found out that I don't have the depth perception required.

I guess I'm just disappointed, EOD was gonna be a dream come true. Guess I just needed to vent a little bit. Now I'm stuck as security forces until I can crosstrain out and go into combat control.

I guess it could be worse, but I still wish I had the chance to go through the schooling.",EOD,Looks like EOD is out for me.,http://www.reddit.com/r/EOD/comments/3afi9q/looks_like_eod_is_out_for_me/
