This is our first time buying a house and I wanted to see if this was a normal practice or something to look out for. We've been to quite a few open houses and toured several others and each time the person showing us the house inevitably will say ""I don't know if you have an agent representing you or not but if you don't I'd be happy to represent you if you are interested."" Is this a normal practice or is this opening up a minefield of red flags? For instance we are honing in on one house in particular and the showing agent told us the same thing. If we decide to move on this property is it wise to go ahead and recruit the showing agent to represent us or pick an outside party? After a little research she has a glowing track record online. We just want to know if this is going to result in more fees that we did not intend on.",RealEstate,Showing agent asking to represent us?,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/56q15t/showing_agent_asking_to_represent_us/

Flights to Dublin seem to be the cheapest so I think we will start there. We are however, curious about any hidden fees or expenses we might not be taking into account for the trip. We've taken into account:

-Flights
-Ferries
-Hotel/Air BnB Lodgings
-Rental Cars
-Food
-Nights stayed with friends
-Random daily fun expenses (gifts/museums/monkey knife fights)

We've traveled the U.S. extensively so we aren't new to travel. I guess the question is, is there some huge thing we are overlooking for international travel? Or some weird hidden fees for foreigners in the UK/Ireland? Like, I see the ticket prices but are we going to get there and have some random payments needed in customs or some such thing? I want to budget this as best as possible and want to make sure I'm covering all our bases.",travel,Touring the British Isles,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4flpja/touring_the_british_isles/
