152,"&gt; here's not really anything to suggest you should defy CW and unplug the battery.

Farley writes about it, mentioning the battery by name in her journal. You might have missed it.

&gt; When and how does Farley get woken up? If you sit in the sun in Hunrath for 20 minutes before going up the tower, why doesn't she arrive and talk to CW and sort the whole plan out?

The REmainers on Villein wake her up from Cryo-stasis after the Mofang are wiped out and the the Maray bomb is destroyed by you. That's why you cannot re-enter the pod area.

&gt; CW obviously doesn't know about the pods in Maray, or the destroyed town you can see from Soria. Why wouldn't you tell him about those things?

Because CW is stubborn, thinks you're mostly useless, and doesn't care about what you have to say.

&gt; A lot of the puzzles are not 'what do I do' but 'how to I get there', and that isn't really fun, particularly when it involves a long roundabout route to the other side of the map for no obvious reason. Only the Villein bridge controls (which you can luck through easily), the multi-teleport bit with the caves and the labyrinth, and the tower code, are really puzzles.

Cyan doesn't do puzzles for the sake of puzzles. If you read the notes, the complex gauntlet was designed so as to prevent mass-attacks- all the swapping would prevent a bunch of mofang from attacking Maray all at once.

&gt; Things changing when you're away. CW changing the layout of the battery building (by moving stuff) and opening new pathways is not how this type of game is supposed to work. You shouldn't have to re-explore places you've already been to to progress. (The whole 'blow the red beam to open walking through the dome wall' is a bit like that too.) Also, if CW is out of his hutch working on his tree cover, why do you never see him at it?

He tells you he is busy working on stuff in-and-around hthe area. I believe his exact words were about 'clearing out some of the stuff around the panels here"" (I missed this on my playthrough). He even tells you, if you didn't plug in the battery, that he had to go do it himself. He does it while you're out. Coincidental, sure, but it works.

&gt; On a similar note, that blue beam generator on the desk in the battery building doesn't look that heavy. Can't I just carry it with me and use it on whatever needs it?

It's attached to the desk.",2016-08-30 00:11:57+00:00,d71y40e,2.0,t1_d6zu8sz,132881.0,Obduction
