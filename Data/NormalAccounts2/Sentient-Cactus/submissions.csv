Since this (https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/4zhsy5/known_issuesbugs/) hasn't been updated in a few days, I thought I'd make a new one:

SOME LINKS AND COMMENTS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. Do not click/read them if you do not want to know certain plot points. I will be posting these in chronological order, as in, by puzzle or by instance of bug occurrence. Please note that I've done my absolute best to minimise spoilers within them and avoid straight answers to puzzles. This post is specific to incidents where people think their game may be broken. In some cases, the 'broken' game is actually a puzzle mechanic, and I've indicated it as such without providing the solution. If there is anything I missed, please let me know and I'll update it. I've read every single post on the subreddit, and tried to put down as many incidents as I could. I don't take credit for most of these solutions, and have linked to most of the original posts with their comments.

For any bugs not listed anywhere else, please report them through Cyan at http://support.cyan.com


General Bugs [No Spoilers]:

&gt; Q: Errors during installation!

Try the following links to see if any of them work for you:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/4zdj4n/fix_for_an_error_occurred_while_installing/
https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/4zdega/trouble_downloading_mac_version_on_steam_backer/

&gt; Q: I'm stuck on the loading screen!

SOLUTION: Change the language.
[Original Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/4zdruy/for_those_getting_stuck_on_the_loading_screen/)

&gt; Q: The game is freezing at certain points!

SOLUTION: Check for a loading circle in the top corner- the game loads main Hunrath separately from certain sections of the game, and there is usually a decent gap. It varies by system, but you'll just have to wait it out.

&gt; Q: I'm running Windows 10 n can't play videos! I updated my drivers already!

SOLUTION: You need to download the media pack. Here is the
[original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/4zibgc/holograms_and_character_videos_not_playing/).
File download link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53356 (Thanks TyrannoJack!)

&gt; Q: I fell through the map/Glitched into a wall!

SOLUTION: Switch to point-and-click mode (keyboard shortcut 'm'). Alternatively, you can use Ctrl+Alt+SHIFT+1 to head back to the beginning of the game, but this contains risks (mentioned below.)

&gt; Q: I can't read anything and/or there is a grey/black bar covering the bottom half of the page!

SOLUTION: It's a problem with your resolution settings. Set it to your native resolution to fix it- though it must be greater than 1024 to work. Unfortunately it seems older graphics cards without these settings won't let you read it. However there are a bunch of people uploading the texts. I'll link them when they become available. You can find the journals on Gamepedia: http://obduction.gamepedia.com/Journals  (thanks Elenathion for linking everyone to these)
[Original Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/4ztabq/glare_makes_reading_book_impossible/)


&gt; Q: I used Ctrl+Alt+SHIFT+1 cheat and now my game is screwed up help!

SOLUTION: It is much safer to change to point-and-click mode if you get caught in a wall. Sometimes when you go back with the admin command, the values in the game files get screwed up and you get prevented from progressing. These have to be dealt on a case-by-case basis. Post it!

&gt; Q: Controllers don't work! Macs don't work!

SOLUTION: Cyan is working right now to fix the issues these users are having. All you can do is wait and/or play it on a decent PC for now. Sorry! They'll update you as soon as they can!

MAC INFO: https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/50804u/mac_version_of_obduction_update/

&gt; Q: Photos are bugged!

SOLUTION: Another thing Cyan's working on (not sure if today's patch solved the issue). For now, take photos with your cellphone or use the snipping tool/print screen options (silly, but like I said, it will hopefully be patched).


Potential Spoilers begin here, in order of occurrence. So, stop reading once you see your dilemma:

&gt; Q: HUNRATH: I think I screwed up the water gate!

SOLUTION: You probably didn't. There have been no instances of the water gate actually ending up causing any game-breaking incidents. There are multiple routes to multiple places. Keep moving!

&gt; Q: HUNRATH: My minecart got stuck in rocks/a wall/Kaptar

SOLUTION: This one unfortunately seems to not have a fix. You can make a post about it and see if anyone can solve the issue. I haven't seen any successful incidents of this, and so you may have to start over. I recommend doing everything you can with the cart first so you don't screw up all your work on the rest of the area.

&gt; Q: HUNRATH: My Minecart is backwards!

SOLUTION: If your minecart suddenly changed directions, that is a bug and will need to be looked at. No solutions currently, and you'll have to restart your game. You can find the [original thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/4zkj9z/spoilers_help_i_know_what_i_have_to_shoot_but_my/).
Otherwise, perhaps you should try going down all the track routes and see where it takes you.

EDIT: See comments by Elenathion, ""Backwards minecart: You can close the gate a""nd shoot the rocks through the window to clear the path. This allows you to go in and open the gate so you can reach the other area""

&gt; Q: KAPTAR: I don't know what to do with the rotating sphere! The steps don't line up! I can't get in one section!

SOLUTION: There are FOUR ways in and out. You probably just missed one.


&gt; Q: MARAY: I locked myself in between teleporters and am stuck!

SOLUTION: Double-check you have all the exits/buttons/etc., located. If you're still honestly barricaded in and stuck, this is a known glitch. In SOME instances, using the Ctrl+Alt+1 command will allow you to go back and fix it, but in others it will make it worse. Before you try anything, please make a post with several screenshots showing your options. That way we can determine whether or not you should try going back to the beginning, so as to not completely break your save.

EDIT: See comments by Elenathion, ""Mine tunnel puzzle in Maray: Some people get blocked out of the large room. Point and click can help you squeeze past.""


&gt; Q: MARAY: I think the maze is broken, nothing will line up right!

SOLUTION: Actually, you just don't know what to do. Think really hard about the core game-mechanics and how they work.


&gt; Q: MARAY: The Maze is SCREWED UP HORRIBLY BEYOND ME NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO.

SOLUTION: Cyan is looking into it, for now you can do some file editing to fix it.
[Original Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/4zvr40/umm_this_doesnt_look_right/)

&gt; Q: MARAY: I did not learn the Villein number system and now I can't go back to learn it!

SOLUTION: Hopefully you took note of the worksheets lying around, if not, here is a link to the PDF copy: https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/5051mk/spoiler_villein_numbers_worksheet_printable_pdf/

Each design is for the POD NUMBER in the cryo-chamber, not the row number, so you can still figure it out on your own. 

Otherwise, here are various links, generously provided by the Reddit community, to learning/ understanding the system (All credit to them, not me):

https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/4zgenp/spoilersvillein_number_system_decoder/
https://kylehovey.github.io/Villein/  (User spel3o got this up!)

&gt; Q: MARAY: I cant get back to the pods anymore!

SOLUTION: I'll spell this one out for you: it's part of the game that you cannot go back. A few people on here have saves you can borrow if you need quick-access to them.

&gt; Q: TREE: I am stuck in an infinite loop of roots and can't get down!

SOLUTION: The only thing solved by me personally- the issue was that there is a small loading screen when entering/coming up from below-ground, and while that loading is happening, your character can turn around and face the other direction than where it was going. Just be mindful and take it slow when descending through the roots.


&gt; Q: I FINISHED THE GAME AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED.

SOLUTION: PM me. I'll send you the details for those who don't know what happened.

These people seem frustrated and think their purchase to be wasteful. I'm hoping to convince you otherwise.

I feel.... uncomfortable providing the story on Reddit, as the point of the game is to uncover it. It wouldn't be fun otherwise. However....

If you really want an explanation to something as to why it happened, I can likely provide it, with a great amount of certainty. This is not exactly a ""fan theory"", or my personal opinion. I've simply calculated everything together and discovered the likliest of possibilities. So, feel free to PM me with questions regarding the story. I may just copy-paste a long explanatory paragraph if I get too many questions, but nevertheless....

Keep in mind- I will need proof that you have completed the game. Either a screenshot of your achievements, a certain scene in the game, etcetera.

I have absolutely no idea how to access it. I've have swapped countless times and have zero idea of where to go. I'm talking hundreds of swaps. I've gotten this far with zero walkthrough/guidance-even that stupid numbers thing, but I'm now down to my last breath on this one. It has to be something obvious.

Anyway, much obliged.

Also: A little note: I got the Raising Arizona achievement. From this I determined that the Arizona license plate must mean something. After a bit of trial-and-error, along with that stupid old box that I destroyed, I found out it unlocked the tippy-top elevator. Anyway, so that's how I got in to the Mayor's office. I went down the elevator...

But inside the Mayor's office was.... a clue to access the Elevator? How in the universe would I have managed to get in there otherwise? I also don't know the three-digit code for the green door. That is locked form the inside of the Mayor's office, so I need to unlock it from inside there, and it's not a big deal since I don't NEED it- except...

This green door is apparently how people were accessing the Mayor's office first? But it's locked from the inside of the office. Anyway, some clarification on that would be grand, because I think it must be a bug- maybe my keypad was reversed? But accessing the Bleeder is more important.",Obduction,(Spoilers) Some assistance post-4th,https://www.reddit.com/r/Obduction/comments/4zm3wr/spoilers_some_assistance_post4th/
