Morin was highly toutly but has failed to deliver, bouncing from team to team, unable to stick on a roster. Has a good shot but doesn't use it very often. Chicago has already tried and traded Morin. Likely a bottom-6 player.

Dano is a goddamn beauty. He's projected to be a 50/60 pt. top-6 player. He has some sweet hands, a ton of energy and plays with a ton of heart. Ask any CBJ fan, he's definitely a favourite. I'm gonna miss him! I personally wish they had sent out Wennburg instead.
