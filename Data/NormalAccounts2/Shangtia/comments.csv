10,"I started acting exactly one year ago. I've been in a few movies and television shows.

However this wasn't enough to satisfy my craving. I decided to start recording my games and uploading them. It's not that I crave the attention (A little bit I do), I just like making content, challenging myself, and making content people enjoy.

Number 1) I graduated college, can't find a job with my degree, and am completely clueless on what to do. Any suggestions?

Number 2) Could I have a small loan of $1 Million, or maybe just tons of stocks? ;)

Thank you for all that you've done!",2016-03-08 18:55:14+00:00,d0schso,1,t3_49jkhn,4604,IAmA

-I mostly do funny moment videos [Gmod, Duck Game, etc.] I'm looking to move into let's plays and such.

-I'm looking for a collab with someone who is over the age of 18, can keep interesting conversation, and don't cuss every 2 seconds [That makes for a video that is nothing but profanity, no bueno]

-I play tons of Gmod, TF2, and COD BO3/ Down for anything though.

Or if I knew how to even do such.. I will definitely try and look into how to do that. Thanks",2016-02-15 18:04:35+00:00,d00v9o6,2,t1_d00ig6w,29122,gmod

20,"You're right!

I work a crappy job with crappy pay in a crappy small town.

I pay bills, and buy necessities.

I pay actors a small, small, rate and mostly in food.

I build my own equipment  (like a shoulder rig, boom pole, etc.) I don't even own a camera! I have a buddy at work who does. He was my cinematographer for free!

I can barely afford anything, I'm trying to save up to move to a bigger city, and using money I make from being in actual movies to help that.

That's why I try coming to the kind community of Reddit for help. Unfortunately, there are a few inconsiderate people who have forgot what kindness and community is all about. As a matter-of-fact, I have stayed away from Reddit for a whole year because I was addicted to it, yet I came back because of the community support. 

If you don't want to help, that's fine, but don't criticise me asking for help. Even if you are a troll.",2015-11-23 15:10:34+00:00,cxa679b,4,t1_cxa02ei,19311,DrawForMe
