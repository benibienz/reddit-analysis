197,"Spoilers below

Key word being ""too much"" I mean the first villain is literally a Vader wannabe, the bad guys are using a giant space station to blow up the good guys and the party needs to lower the shields to let X-Wings blow the space station. 

So many events happen **very similar** to the originals and while I appreciate the return to form and loved the movie I feel like a lot of potential is going to be wasted if the rest of the trilogy plays it safe like this. ",2015-12-21 02:17:34+00:00,cy655ww,3.0,t1_cy60ny9,7986.0,AdviceAnimals
198,"Ok I have a lot of thoughts on Kylo Ren and think he has some of the biggest potential for a villain but they need to lose the tortured soul shit quick. He's hardly a deep or particularly interesting character but he *can be*. Firstly I love his lightsaber I think it shows how skilled he is with tinkering and I think he could make some really cool shit. We've already seen he has power in spades (STOPPED. A. FUCKING. LASER!) now I want to see him start using it.

Secondly I really like his Vader fan boy schtick but I think they need to now work on making Kylo Ren someone interesting without the mask. Vader was a stone cold motherfucker but if all Kylo's training does is turn him into Vader it will be boring as shit. He embodies the pure emotion part of the Sith and when he did actually fight it showed. If he learned to channel that emotion more he could develop a very interesting fighting style (I imagine him becoming more wild as he fights and eventually beats out opponents with pure strike rate.) 

All in all I loved the movie and all the possibilities it presents but I'll be keeping an eagle eye on Kylo Ren.",2015-12-20 12:07:16+00:00,cy5f05t,1.0,t3_3xguab,77716.0,StarWars

Eren getting some titty was probably one of the awkwardest scenes I've seen in a while and that whole weird romance sub-plot sucked ass. 

The guy throwing the titan was stupid. I'm disappointed we didn't get any Hanji x RPG action but she's holding a stinger in the Part 2 trailer (also off topic but would a Stinger even lock on to titans or can they be dumb fired?) 

I didn't mind that they changed so much since I think it helped pacing.
