Now I recently set a new email which I registered my copy with and made a new account. However unknown to me Google has managed to lose my account which means I cannot access it to recover or change my password. This has lead to me trying so many times I got locked out. 

Changing my account email didn't work at all and so far Rockstar haven't done anything apart from tell me to make a ticket which has gone unanswered and now I can't even view it because both of my social accounts are locked. 

Support ticket should be at https://t.co/XPs0Au5s3S

The telecaster was a steal from gumtree with some Gretsch pickups I haven't been able to identify and the LED's were installed by the previous owner. Apparently there's also a space routed out under the pickguard to put a pedal in for onboard effects but I haven't had the chance to try it out. 

The Les Paul was a Christmas gift from my cousin and was his first electric as well as mine.

The Shecter was a pawn shop find, I haven't played it as much as I want to because the action is pretty farked and I haven't sat down to fix it yet. 

The red stratocaster is a Torch Vintage Series that I picked up from the same pawn shop for $45. The only problem is the sound cuts out so I took it apart to have a look but don't actually know what I'm doing so if anyone's got some advice I'd appreciate it.
