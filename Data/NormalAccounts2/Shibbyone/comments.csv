I dug a length-wise hole for my body and a little hole for my head, connecting them by a tunnel and crawled in, and had myself buried under a few inches of sand and the hole for my head left open, but below sand level. 

It all went great for a couple of minutes until my cousin who was taking a picture of me kicked sand in the hole on accident and it went in my mouth and nose. I couldn't breathe and couldn't articulate it, but thank god he saw it and immediately got people to dig me out. My dying thought was ""fuck this is the dumbest way to die...""
