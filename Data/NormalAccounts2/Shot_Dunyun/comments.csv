This book is so far ahead of its time it's just astonishing. A real eye-opener.

I've read a decent amount of stuff from the 50s, like Silver Age comics, and Oesterheld just lived completely outside that entire industry, and he was *so far ahead of them*.

**Patience** by Daniel Clowes - Clowes always blows me away, and this is no exception-- he takes a full leap into sci-fi territory here with this painful story involving time travel. 

**Beverly** by Nick Drnaso - Drnaso steps up to the plate and just knocks it out of the park. It's sort of a mix of Dan Clowes' pitiless observation, Adrian Tomine's eye for the mundane, and a pinch of Dash Shaw. Drnaso plays a lot with structure and focus in ways that surprise. A smashing debut.

**Rosalie Lightning** by Tom Hart - I don't expect this to ever become a really popular book, but as the father of a chronically ill child, this shines a light into some dark places for me. It's a memoir of Hart's daughter, who died suddenly as a toddler. There is grief and rage and joy in this book, both for the characters and the reader. This is the only graphic novel I've ever read that honestly made me put it down and cry.

I stumbled onto this planet before the internet was a thing, so for me the entire internet attempt to aggregate movie taste is more than slightly fucking insane. The entire time I've known about movies as a walking-around human being, the best way to figure out a new movie is just asking people I know about it. The internet can be really just a protracted version of that, but when you cross over into trying to mathematically analyze human opinion it just becomes a set of numbers that is utterly fucking meaningless. Just watch movies and talk to people, it's not complicated. ",2016-09-03 03:00:19+00:00,d77lsdz,7.0,t1_d77imim,5962.0,movies
234,"The way I look at iMDB is this: the ratings system is fucked beyond repair and completely meaningless, and the comments section of the site is shockingly, shockingly stupid. If you use the site for more than just raw movie information you're making a mistake.

As far as RT... look, the take-a-step-back truth is that **all** movie rating systems on any level or scope are meaningless. It's an attempt to assign an objective score to an inherently subjective thing. It's fucking stupid. ""This movie rates a 7.6."" 

What? What does that even fucking mean? Do paintings get a score? What's the score for Magritte's ""Son of Man?"" What about Picasso's Guernica? Asking the question should make you feel absurd.

396,"The difference between Groundhog Day and About Time is that in GH, Phil learns that he can't make Rita fall in love with him by using information he obtained by time travel to fill in a mad-libs page about her, the way that Tim does in About Time. Rita only falls in love with Phil when he stops trying to make her fall in love with him and just uses his time to improve himself and make himself a happier, better person.

In About Time, Tim basically time-stalks Mary and tricks her into falling in love, despite the movie's admonition that you can't do that. Richard Curtis (the screenwriter/director) gives himself an out by showing you that she initially was attracted to Tim, but that doesn't change what Tim does after, which is weird and a little creepy. Ultimately though that's not what the film is really about-- it's really about Tim's relationship with his father and how his father teaches him to be a happy person.",2016-06-27 08:46:43+00:00,d4pn0k5,3.0,t1_d4pfq51,17325.0,movies

417,"I find Tomine to be a little frustrating. 

I love his artwork, and his characters and stories are interesting, and Tomine hits a level of emotional honesty in his work that is very rare. But I'm always let down by how brief his stories are. Any of the stories in Killing &amp; Dying could have been expanded into a longer work; if I had to pick one, it would be the title piece. 

I realize that a lot of what makes Tomine's storytelling effective is the negative space he uses-- for example, we don't get a lot of detail about what happens to the mother, but can infer that she has passed away, presumably from cancer. What I wonder is whether Tomine's style can even work in a longer piece where we are given more details. 

I've read other Tomine works besides Killing &amp; Dying, but K&amp;D and Summer Blonde are the only two of his works that I own, and are the only two I've read more than once, so I can't really answer my own question. But I know every time I read through one of the two Tomine books I own, my immediate reaction is ""man, I wish he'd write something longer"" because I want to spend more time with the characters he creates.",2016-06-17 16:55:27+00:00,d4d8e8l,1.0,t3_4oe4js,88933.0,graphicnovels

531,"That's not all the movie is, though. Roughly the first half of the movie is used to set up how shallow and meaningless the lives of this family are until one by one wake up to realize how shallow and meaningless what they do and what they want are. 

Spoilers below:

By the end of the movie Lester becomes fully awake and is killed at a moment of absolute self-actualization, when he has finally moved past his sexual obsession with Angela, which was the last remaining piece of his American middle-class affectation. What he realizes in that moment is that he actually does love his child and his wife, and he realizes how important they are to him (""Man oh man, man oh man."") 

The event of Lester's death also pushes Caroline and Janey past their own shallowly-conceived disdain for Lester. I think what the film does is show that the suburban lifestyle of the parents with 9 to 5 jobs, the house with the white picket fence, the routine of dinner in the living room, the banality of this existence is toxic and produces a familiar contempt amongst the family that is also, ultimately, meaningless when faced with change.",2016-04-25 18:19:21+00:00,d2gubg8,2.0,t1_d2gttrr,642.0,movies

544,"2nd &amp; Charles can be kind of a frustrating place to shop for graphic novels. We have one nearby that I check out every so often, and while I occasionally buy graphic novels there, you're really rolling the dice on whether or not they're going to have anything you're specifically looking for, since it's all second-hand stuff. 2nd &amp; Charles is the place to go if you want to just impulse buy, not look for something specific.

That said, based on your tastes (sci-fi, true crime, black humor, good drama, post apocalyptic), here's what I'd recommend:

Almost anything by Daniel Clowes, particularly Ghost World, David Boring, Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron, or his new book Patience. Clowes's sensibility is right in your wheelhouse-- black humor, some sci-fi elements, very sardonic delivery. 

Black Hole, by Charles Burns. Sci-fi/horror/drama hybrid about a sexually-transmitted mutation virus in 1970s suburban Seattle. Awesome book.

Green River Killer by Jeff Jensen. Very strong true crime thriller about the Green River Killer. 

From Hell by ALan Moore. An absolute behemoth of a book about Jack the Ripper. I think it's probably the best thing Alan Moore's written, but I have complicated opinions about his work.

Preacher, by Garth Ennis. If you liked the Walking Dead books, this is going to hit a lot of the same receptors. It's about a preacher in a small Texas town who is gifted with The Word, which is the ability to speak in a particular voice which when heard by others, absolutely must be obeyed.

At 15, civil action was filed against him for his involvement in two separate incidents of harassing African-American children (the first were siblings of each other, and the second incident was a group of black school children on a field trip), by throwing rocks and shouting racial epithets.[14] At 16, Wahlberg approached a middle-aged Vietnamese man named Thanh Lam on the street and, using a large wooden stick, knocked him unconscious while calling him a ""Vietnam fucking shit"".[15][16] That same day Wahlberg also attacked a second Vietnamese man named Hoa ""Johnny"" Trinh, punching him in the face. He believed he had left his victim permanently blind in one eye.[14][15][17] Trinh was interviewed in December 2014 by the Daily Mail, who revealed that he had already lost that eye during the Vietnam War, and did not know the identity of his assailant prior to being contacted by the media.[18] According to court documents regarding these crimes, when Wahlberg was arrested later that night and returned to the scene of the first assault, he stated to police officers: ""You don't have to let him identify me, I'll tell you now that's the motherfucker who's (sic) head I split open.""[17] Investigators also noted that he ""made numerous unsolicited racial statements about 'gooks' and 'slant-eyed gooks'.""[15][17]",2016-04-01 02:19:46+00:00,d1laj30,2.0,t1_d1l8cve,3481.0,Musicthemetime

So here's some facts about the beef cattle industry in Illinois from the early 20th century.

Previous to the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, no droves of cattle were seen in the country west of Ohio. The first drove ever driven from Illinois was taken from Springfield, through Chicago, to Green Bay, Wisconsin, in 1825, by Colonel William S. Hamilton. Beginning with this date, the practice of collecting cattle into droves and driving them to market soon grew from a minor occupation into an industry within itself; beef cattle that were grown and fattened in Illinois were gathered together into large droves by men who made it a business, and were driven to the then great cattle markets on the sea board. Foremost among these early pioneer cattlemen were: Jacob Strawn, John T. Alexander, B. F. Harris, and Tom C. Ponting. In the scope of their operations, Jacob Strawn and John T. Alexander exceeded many of the conspicuous operators in the rise and fall of the range industry in this state. These men owned hundreds of acres of the prairie land of the state, on which they collected enormous droves of cattle. These cattle were grazed here throughout the spring and summer, then were fed during the winter. It was no uncommon occurrence for one of these operators to buy all the corn for sale during one season in three or four counties. The next spring these fat bullocks were trailed across the level country to the eastern mountain ranges, over which they climbed to reach Lancaster, Philadelphia, and New York. Cincinnati and Buffalo received a few of these cattle, but most of them were driven on through to the markets on the sea board, where better prices were obtained. These cities bore about the same relation to the livestock traffic of those days as Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and St. Joseph bear to the cattle trade of today; they were the collecting points for the business, and the slaughterers who bought them either salted the carcasses down in barrels and casks or sold them to local consumers. Other dealers, however, bought some of these cattle and drove them on to smaller towns nearer the coast. “In the census of 1850, it was recorded that Illinois alone sent 2,000 head of cattle each week to the New York market.” 
While the cattle barons represented a large part of the beef cattle trade of Illinois, there were hundreds of smaller dealers who fed only a few cattle each year which added materially to the magnitude of the beef cattle industry of the state. A few of these smaller operators were found in almost every section of the state, especially in the central and northern part.

Cattle trailing continued until lines of railroad connecting Illinois with the cities on the Atlantic coast were built. This made cattle trailing unnecessary and greatly stimulated the production of beef in the state by furnishing means for placing beef before the consumers of the east quickly and at a much less cost than that of the old method. The long drives greatly decreased the weight of the animals, and, at the same time, the meat of carcasses was inferior to that of the cattle that were shipped by railroad and slaughtered without having taken such a long drive.

John T. Alexander

“Among the cattle operators of Illinois, John T. Alexander was probably the greatest by reason of the magnitude of his transactions, but he was antedated by Jacob Strawn, who located in Morgan County in 1827. Alexander has been regarded as America’s greatest cattleman in a commercial sense. In the strict sense of the term, he was a pastoralist and a trader, not an agriculturalist. His parents were native of Ireland, who migrated to Virginia in 1818, and in 1824 joined the exodus to the Mississippi Valley, settling in Jefferson County, Ohio. John T. Alexander was the oldest of a family of eleven children. His education was on the farm. He was endowed with that faculty called cattle sense. At the age of fifteen, he was entrusted, by his father, with the entire charge of a drove of cattle sent to Philadelphia. He sold them to advantage, collected the money, and took it safely home. At the age of seventeen, he was purchasing cattle in Illinois to replenish his father’s Ohio pastures. It is related that his search took him down into Sangamon County, where he was so struck with its natural advantages, from a cattle standpoint, that he determined to migrate.”

In 1840, the Alexanders settled in Morgan County, then a cattle range bounded only by the horizon. Mr. Alexander accumulated a herd of steers, pastured them on the public domain, and for half a decade prospered in a moderate way. As the country became settled, it soon became evident that he must own land or get out of the cattle business as far as that locality was concerned. In 1848, he purchased 3,000 acres of land at prices ranging from 87 cents to $3.00 per acre. This land was adjoining the half section that he had originally homesteaded. In 1855, he acquired another 1,000 acres at $30.00 per acre. This indicated how rapidly the price of land was advancing. In 1857, he bought 700 acres more at $50.00 per acre, and in 1859, he acquired 1500 acres of the Strawn estate at $30.00 per acre. In 1864, he secured 853 acres at $60.00 to $70.00 per acre, making him the owner of 7,233 acres of the choicest land in Illinois. In 1866, he purchased the stock farm of Michael Sullivan in Champaign County, Illinois, containing 26,000 acres at $11.00 to $12.00 per acre.

It was during this period of purchase that John T. Alexander acquired the title of “cattle king.” His transactions were on an enormous scale. His buyers searched every nook and cranny of the cattle producing region of the Mississippi Valley, and Alexander, on the Wabash railroad in Morgan County, Illinois, was the largest cattle shipping station in the world. Entire trains of cattle, destined for eastern markets, were daily loaded there and almost the entire population was on the Alexander pay roll. Thousands of other cattle, for which he paid but never saw, were loaded at innumerable points for eastern markets. From a pastoralist, he had emerged into a speculator on probably the most gigantic scale the livestock industry has ever witnessed. He ruled the markets of the East and was the Napoleon of the cattle trade. His name was more familiar to the West than that of Vanderbilt or A. T. Stewart. His annual cattle shipment for many years exceeded 50,000 head, and in 1868, reached 75,000. For a lengthy period, his sales on eastern markets exceeded $4,000,000 annually, and it is related that prior to his Champaign County purchase, an inventory of his assets showed 7,233 acres of land, averaging $75.00 per acre in value, $100,000 in bank, 7,000 cattle on his Morgan County pastures, and not a dollar of debt.

Such speculative operations, however, had the result of entailing financial embarrassment. In 1871, Alexander had to contract his business and part with his Champaign County property. This embarrassment was due to many causes, not the least serious of which was cattle mortality by splenetic fever, by which he lost $100,000. He also sustained heavy losses by shrinkage in cattle values, and the Champaign county investment proved disastrous. He also became involved in railroad complications. The railroads were keen competitors for the livestock traffic, and in 1871 Alexander severed his relations with the Pennsylvania railroad, making a contract with the New York Central, by which that company gave him a low rate conditional to a specified tonnage. By way of resentment, the Pennsylvania Railroad put merely nominal rates into effect, thereby glutting eastern markets and crippling Alexander’s trade, which had become so colossal as to be unwieldy. To carry on such gigantic operations, he was compelled to trust to innumerable assistants, many of whom proved to be either incompetent or unfaithful. Confronted with liabilities aggregating $1,200,000, he was forced to make an assignment, but his estate was sufficient not only to pay off every creditor, but leave him a large sum for a fresh start in life. It was while energetically engaged in retrieving his fortune that he died, in 1876.

Those survivors of John T. Alexander, who remember his activity as Illinois’s greatest operator, describe him as being tall and commanding in appearance. Even at the time of his death, he was hale and youthful. He was of sanguine temperament, naturally impulsive, but quiet and non-assuming in manner, sparing in speech, and undoubtedly one of the great American captains of industry in his time, an outstanding figure in a trade that boasts many conspicuous men.

The old Alexander mansion in Morgan County, the greatest house in the countryside half a decade ago, remains in a somewhat dilapidated condition, and the decaying out-buildings convey a mournful hint of vanished greatness. Here, during Alexander’s time, Abraham Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas, Richard Yates, and others, whose illustrious names adorn Illinois history, were the guests of America’s greatest cattleman.

Jacob Strawn

Jacob Strawn came from Ohio and settled in Morgan County in 1827, and a few years later was probably the most extensive cattle dealer in the world, but his operations were, to a large extent, local and his most distant shipping point, Saint Louis. His pastures in Morgan county embraced about 15,000 acres and his business reached its maximum about 1860.

674,"Not a reply to your post, but here's some facts about the manufacture of rubber goods from the late 19th century.

While the manufacture of rubber goods is in no sense a secret industry, the majority of buyers and users of such goods have never stepped inside of a rubber mill, and many have very crude ideas as to how the goods are made up. In ordinary garden hose, for instance, the process is as follows: The inner tubing is made of a strip of rubber fifty feet in length, which is laid on a long zinc-covered table and its edges drawn together over a hose pole. The cover, which is of what is called “friction,” that is cloth with rubber forced through its meshes, comes to the hose maker in strips, cut on the bias, which are wound around the outside of the tube and adhere tightly to it. The hose pole is then put in something like a fifty foot lathe, and while the pole revolves slowly, it is tightly wrapped with strips of cloth, in order that it may not get out of shape while undergoing the process of vulcanizing. When a number of these hose poles have been covered in this way they are laid in a pan set on trucks and are then run into a long boiler, shut in, and live steam is turned on. When the goods are cured steam is blown off, the vulcanizer opened and the cloths are removed. The hose is then slipped off the pole by forcing air from a compressor between the rubber and the hose pole. This, of course, is what is known as hose that has a seam in it.

For seamless hose the tube is made in a tubing machine and slipped upon the hose pole by reversing the process that is used in removing hose by air compression. In other words, a knot is tied in one end of the fifty foot tube and the other end is placed against the hose pole and being carefully inflated with air it is slipped on without the least trouble. For various kinds of hose the processes vary, and there are machines for winding with wire and intricate processes for the heavy grades of suction hose, etc. For steam hose, brewers’, and acid hose, special resisting compounds are used, that as a rule are the secrets of the various manufacturers. Cotton hose is woven through machines expressly designed for that purpose, and afterward has a half-cured rubber tube drawn through it. One end is then securely stopped up and the other end forced on a cone through which steam is introduced to the inside of the hose, forcing the rubber against the cotton cover, finishing the cure and fixing it firmly in its place.

After the mixing of the compound and the calendering, that is the spreading it in sheets, the great roll of rubber and cloth that is to be made into corrugated matting is sent to the pressman. Here it is hung in a rack and fifteen or twenty feet of it drawn between the plates of the huge hydraulic steam press. The bottom plate of this press is grooved its whole length, so that when the upper platen is let down the plain sheet of rubber is forced into the grooves and the corrugations are formed. While in that position steam is let into the upper and lower platens and the matting is cured. After it has been in there the proper time, cold water is let into the press, it is cooled off, and the upper platen being raised, it is ready to come out. A simple device for loosening the matting from the grooves into which it has been forced is a long steel rod, with a handle on one hand like an auger handle, which, being introduced under the edge and twisted, allows the air to enter with it and releases it from the mould.

Sheet packing is often times made in a press, like corrugated matting. The varieties, however, known as gum core have to go through a different process. Usually a core is squirted through a tube machine and the outside covering of jute or cotton, or whatever the fabric may be, is put on by a braider or is wrapped about it somewhat after the manner of the old fashioned cloth-wrapped tubing. The fabric is either treated with some heat-resisting mixture or something that is a lubricant, plumbago and oil being the compound. Other packings are made from the ends of belts cut out in a circular form and treated with a lubricant. There are scores of styles that make special claims for excellences that are made in a variety of ways, but as a rule the general system as outlined above is followed.

The old fashioned way of making jar rings was first to take a large mandrel and wrap it around with a sheet of compounded rubber until the thickness of the ring was secured. It was then held in place by a further wrapping of cloth, vulcanized, put in a lathe and cut up into rings by hand. That manner of procedure, however, was too slow, and it is to-day done almost wholly by machinery. For example, the rubber is squirted out of a mammoth tubing machine in the shape of a huge tube, then slipped on a mandrel and vulcanized. It is then put in an automatic lathe and revolving swiftly is brought against a sharp knife blade which cuts ring after ring until the whole is consumed, without any handling or watching.",2016-03-25 13:39:45+00:00,d1cz89b,2.0,t1_d1cp0r4,34510.0,movies

But he is not Batman. The character classically doesn't have an arc where he's young and violent and conflicted and angry and makes horrible mistakes. He's not Spider-Man. He's not Batman. 

What makes him Superman is that his story is simple: his parents raised him right. He does the right thing, always. He has immense power and the wisdom and personal responsibility to use that power correctly. 

Anytime comics creators or filmmakers stray from that formula, it fouls the recipe. I liked Man of Steel, but someday somebody is going to make a Superman movie the right way. Donner got it very right in 1978 by sticking to the Silver Age character and not making him into someone dark or violent.",2016-03-22 03:25:43+00:00,d18qjwx,5.0,t1_d18my6o,5945.0,movies
690,"The version of Superman in All-Star draws heavily off of the Silver Age version of Superman, which is the period in comic books that defined his character and made him great. The problem with making Superman a dark and gritty character like we see in Death and Resurrection, and in Man of Steel, is that it largely ignores several decades of mythology and character building in order to try to recreate the character into something that is more like the other superhero comics and movies being marketed today.

But here's the thing: the Silver Age (and Golden Age) Superman, that character, is what made Superman the greatest superhero character in history. There is only one Superman. And if you want the character to continue to succeed in the long run, you have to keep to that basic formula and not do the silly things that have been done to the character in the 90s (and still today to some extent), like turning him into a blue electricity guy with no cape, or killing him off and bringing him back with long hair, or making him conflicted and violent. There is only one Superman. He is actually a fairly simple character. That's part of what makes him great.",2016-03-22 03:19:12+00:00,d18qcir,5.0,t1_d18nffk,4797.0,movies

693,"&gt;In fact one of the most well known canon Superman stories ends with him killing Doomsday. 

And that's not a very good Superman story, all things considered. As a matter of fact the entire Death and Resurrection of Superman is pretty lousy, a big misstep in the 90s from DC trying to emulate the success of Wolverine by making Superman violent and dark.

The reason Morrison's ""All-Star"" is one of the best Superman stories isn't because it's canon. It's because it shows Superman at his best, faced with impossible odds, facing the ultimate threat, but the comic itself isn't dark or gritty. It's sunny and optimistic and proud,  both in the characters and the art itself. 

Ultimately Superman isn't a character who should be shown gritting his teeth, scowling, making threats, getting his uniform torn up. That's not who Superman is. He's clean. He is strong. He is the best of us. 

One of the things Man of Steel gets exactly right is the way Jor-El sees his son, which is the way (hopefully) the people of Earth will one day see Superman: 

&gt;You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun, Kal. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.

*That* is the Superman we should see. Superman shouldn't be flawed, or violent, or angry. He is the best of us.",2016-03-21 23:31:10+00:00,d18hnw2,3.0,t1_d18h6gi,747.0,movies
694,"&gt;This is a different superman. 

And that's the problem.

Look, I enjoyed the film myself. But it's easy to see why other people didn't, and the character of Superman being changed to fit the film's darker tone is its most fundamental problem. 

There's a comic series called [All-Star Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Star_Superman) written by Grant Morrison that you should read if you're interested in Superman. It is cited by an awful lot of people as the best Superman story ever written, and the reason for that is the way Morrison writes Superman: he is strong, he is optimistic, he is honest, but he is not boring. And he cares about people. He does the right thing. He is massively powerful, but the stories in this series are not boring because of it.

What he is not is someone who would commit murder to defeat an enemy. He is not someone who would allow thousands of people to die in order to defeat an enemy.

Like I said up top, I like Man of Steel, I think it has a lot going for it and I think some people are way too hard on it (I think the music is fantastic, it's got the kind of action scenes we've waited forever to see Superman in, and I was not bored by the movie at all. I think it starts interesting and stays interesting). 

But when people complain about the movie and Superman being a changed character, I totally get it.",2016-03-21 22:35:29+00:00,d18fhj0,1.0,t3_4bem2d,871.0,movies

The police reached the band's boat, with drummer Paul Cook yelling ""'No fun! No fun!'"" Everyone aboard was removed from the boat and arrested -- eleven of the group spent the night in jail.

There were many people in the UK calling for the entire band to be tried for treason. Treason is a capital crime in the UK.

They wanted to kill them. For playing music.

The Sex Pistols scared the living shit out of some people.

The track linked here, ""Bodies,"" is a song about an acquaintance of John Lydon's (Johnny Rotten) named Pauline who once showed up on John's doorstep one night wrapped in a plastic bag, holding another bag that contained her aborted fetus. She claimed to have been impregnated at an insane asylum she had recently checked out of.

But if you want something different, something entirely new, I'd steer away from the sci-fi and look at some more realistic stuff.

Try the first volume of **Stray Bullets** and see if you like that. Lots of action, lots of story, but very grounded and human.

The producers of the '83 movie had to license the name Ghostbusters from them, though. And the core concept is the same: it's a comedy about guys going around investigating and fighting ghosts. The concept doesn't originate with the '75 Ghost Busters either-- there's other movies that [fit the same basic framework going back decades](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038976/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1).

I'm a fan of the 83 movie, don't get me wrong. But I don't think there's any advantage to deciding you already hate the new one even though you haven't seen it.

969,"My wife has a very clean vocabulary, but I come from a rougher background than she does, and when I'm alone or with my friends, I curse like a sailor. So by now my 9-y.o daughter has heard just about every curse word under the sun, right outta my mouth. I never use that kind of language directed towards her but she's heard me say it. 

The first time we realized this was happening was when she was about three-- I was going around the house hanging some new pictures we'd bought, and my daughter was pretending to be Daddy, carrying around a plastic toy hammer and hammering on the walls. My wife stopped me and mad eme come over and watch my daughter, who would hammer on the wall for a minute and then talk, going *tap* *tap* *tap* *tap* *tap*, ""Shit."" *tap* *tap* *tap* *tap* *tap*, ""Shit.""

So we've had a years-long dialogue with her about how those are words she shouldn't say, and I've told her a lot that those words can't hurt her and they don't bother me, but Mommy doesn't want to hear them from her, and she should never use them at other people's houses or at school, and I think out of simplicity she has just concluded ""well I'm never going to say them,"" and she never does. Which is nice.

Except one time when she was seven. She was over at a friend's house, and she was with two other little girls who are her besties, and they were breathlessly discussing how this other kid in their school had said the F-word at school. This apparently turned into a discussion about what the F-word was, and my daughter said ""Oh I know what it is, but I'm not saying it."" And the girl whose house they were at (Julie) said ""Just say it, I won't tell, it's our secret."" So my daughter, being a trusting and good person, said okay, and told her what the F-word was. And gave the correct answer. And then Julie got upstairs, went to her mother, and told her that my daughter just said the F-word. Panicked phone calls to our house were made, things were smoothed over, and we re-iterated to our daughter that she doesn't say those words around other people, for any reason.

And that was the day that my wife and learned that my daughter's friend Julie is a fucking rat.",2016-02-27 02:27:27+00:00,d0fdt2h,1.0,t3_47qo5e,26008.0,Parenting

982,"I mean, I'd tell people, but then they'd just want me to *do* shit.

Okay, I'd probably better explain. To who, I have no idea, since nobody can fucking read. Whatever. Let's make this a letter to me. Dear me: remember when everyone went blind because of that stupid virus? 

At first it was not so bad, people thought you had to eat at Chipotle to get it and all it did was make you puke and shit your brains out for a while. Then about a year later those same puke-and-shitters started going blind. That's when people started to panic. Then Chipotle went out of business. Then people figured out it wasn't even Chipotle to begin with. Something in the water supply. Too late. Everyone got it. 

Things slowed down real fast. Airports closed, then nobody was driving anywhere. People walking into stores and just taking food, what they could figure out was food. We saw our neighbor down at the corner shop trying to eat a bag of cat chow, not sure what she thought it was. That was before Mom went blind. 

Look, I didn't ask for any of this shit to happen. I mean nobody did, but all I wanted was to sit in my room playing Xbox like I've always done. I don't ask much out of life. Wasn't popular in school and not smart enough for college. Things after high school smoothed out okay. Mom had her social security check to live on and we did okay. I spent most nights and afternoons sitting in my room playing Xbox on the 32-inch plasma I bought by saving up from my job at the corner shop. Then after the virus I didn't even have to go to work anymore which was fine by me, those people suck. And since I knew  I'd not be able to play games pretty soon, I stayed in my room and played. I wanted to finish Far Cry 6, at least.

And I did. So I started on the new Assassin's Creed. And finished it.

And I started Dark Souls 4, which I'd been putting off since last year. 

And I finished it. 

By then I knew something was happening.

Or at least, something *wasn't* happening. 

Look, I'm not a fucking asshole, I still made sure Mom had food every day, and I made sure the house was protected-- things started getting shitty outside by then. The clumsiest fucking gangs of raiders were roaming around by then, but they were easy to stay ahead of. A few boards over the windows, lock the doors, stay quiet. You know what it's like to face off with a group of angry blind looters? It's fucking retarded easy.  

I think the only thing I really did wrong was I didn't tell Mom I could still see.

I think she's starting to suspect, though. She keeps feeling her way down the hallway to my room and hearing sounds from the game through the door. ""What's that?"" she yells.

""It's just one of my games,"" I say back. ""I just put it on for noise, I like the sounds.""

""VICTORY! BOSS DEFEATED!"" goes the game. I don't think Mom knows what it means, but I think she's starting to suspect.

Something will change soon. I already went down to Best Buy and took all the games from the Xbox section. I'll run out of new ones to play within another three months or so, they're not making any more new ones. After that I'll play through some of the ones I liked again. But after that? 

I'll probably have to tell somebody. Starting with Mom. And she'll probably tell other people. Word will get around.

And then people will want me to *do* shit.

1102,"My daughter is a kid with special needs-- she's been on chemo for about the last two years, and for the entirety of second grade she went to school bald and dealing with the effects of heavy steroid medication, which made her fat. She's doing much better now, is no longer bald or fat due to her condition improving and moving on to less severe medication, but second grade for us was a massive challenge. We worked closely with the school's administration and nursing staff to get through.

One of the things we dealt with was bullying. My daughter's school (and most schools these days) have a ""zero tolerance"" policy for bullying, but things still happened. And when they did, we dealt with them swiftly and seriously. Here's my advice:

**You need a face-to-face, non-telephone meeting with the principal of his school as soon as possible.** Call him today. Don't let them hand you off to a counselor or secretary. Get on the phone with him today. If he won't take your call, go to the school in person as soon as possible, during school hours. Do not yell and scream or insult anyone. Simply insist that you have a face-to-face meeting with the principal. 

When you have this meeting, insist that the other child be dealt with immediately. The principal needs to have a **face-to-face, non-telephone meeting with this child's parents, without you present.**
If the other child will not stop physically assaulting your child, he needs to be removed from your son's class. **Do not waver or relent on this demand. Do not accept ""we're doing the best we can"" as a response. Do not yell or insult the principal or school staff. Be calm but firm in your resolve.** 

If the principal will not rectify the situation immediately, it's time to start climbing the ladder. Document everything you can from the meeting with the principal, contact the school board member for your particular area and arrange a face-to-face meeting. Again, do not accept a telephone call. Your goal is to be a problem that is taken seriously. Tell the school board member that your son is being physically assaulted at school and the principal is unwilling to help. If the school board member is unwilling to help you, tell him or her that your next calls will be to the police, an attorney, and the local news station.

Things will probably not progress to this point. It was our experience that having face-to-face meetings with the school principal was sufficient in halting the problem, particularly after I outlined to him that my plan if seeing him did not rectify the situation swiftly was to contact the school board, the police, get lawyers involved, and contact the press.

It is of utmost importance that you remain level-headed and calm when dealing with these people. Do not yell, do not insult. Simply state your problem, tell the principal you need him to have an in-person meeting with this child's parents to halt the situation, and that if that does not immediately stop the problem, that child needs to be removed from your son's class or the school entirely.",2016-01-13 19:22:41+00:00,cywyeuo,1.0,t3_40spwq,10813.0,Parenting

1108,"&gt; Despite their reputation, a lot of what Image puts out is bad. Wicked &amp; Divine, Burn the Orphanage, Nowhere Men, Roche Limit and They're Not Like Us are all terrible.

Only one I've read out of these was Wicked &amp; Divine, which I found to be frustratingly shallow. I blind bought the first two TPBs because it was getting such good reviews, but upon reading I found it to be one of the flattest, emptiest things I've read in a long time. The artwork is really nice, but it almost seems too clean and comes off flat for me. 

&gt; Americans and other westerners shouldn't adopt manga style. It looks bad, is obvious, and is indicative of poor quality work.

I know there's millions of people who disagree with me, but I find it impossible to enjoy anime or anything with that anime aesthetic. It's just horribly off-putting to me.

&gt; There is not a better art scene/style comics-wise than French artists from the 70s like Moebius, Caza and Druillet.

How aware of Will Eisner were you during the height of his career?  Did you know about Contract with God in the 70s or 80s? I know you said you came to graphic novels late, but did you know who Eisner was back than? I'm curious. I'm 45 and I didn't even know that book existed until the late 90s.

&gt;With a very few exceptions, I don't do DC and Marvel superhero comics collections. I find them repetitious and therefore boring, and also rather naive in their writing.

This is *exactly* how I feel. I read superhero comics when I was a kid in the 70s and 80s, but I don't really get into the men in tights stuff now unless there's an author I really dig involved. Grant Morrison has some great stuff, I became a fan of his during the run of The Invisibles (which I can't recommend highly enough). His work  on DC comics is always worth reading, because it tends to deconstruct superhero mythology and involve some really bonkers concepts. And if he's doing a book with Frank Quitely I will buy automatically.

1182,"&gt;A few things that seem interesting from my research is: Asterios Polyp and The Wicked + The Divine. How are those?

I found The Wicked + The Divine to be kind of disappointingly shallow, to be honest. Here's a list of great, essential stuff:

**Dan Clowes - ""Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron,"" ""David Boring,"" ""Ghost World""** If you ask me, Clowes is the greatest living comics creator. His bibliography goes further than what I've listed here, but I think those three are his best books. He's got a new graphic novel coming out next year which looks promising. By the way, if you've seen the ""Ghost World"" movie, you should still read the book. It's different enough that you won't feel like you know what's going to happen on every next page.

**Seth - ""It's a Good Life If You Don't Weaken,"" ""Clyde Fans""** Seth is fantastic. Some of the best work about nostalgia ever written.

**Charles Burns - ""Black Hole""** If you ask me at any given time what my favorite graphic novel is I'm likely to give a different answer, but frequently I'll say Black Hole. The book is equal parts teenage confessional, horror story, and fucked-up superhero allegory. The art is precise and beautiful and merciless.

**Alison Bechdel - ""Fun Home"" ; Chris Ware - ""Jimmy Corrigan, The Smartest Boy on Earth"" ; Craig Thompson - ""Blankets,"" ""Habibi"" ; Art Spiegelman - ""Maus""** So much has been written about these guys I just feel like I'm repeating everyone else by talking about them. But these are all essential stuff. Read all of them.

**Will Eisner - ""The Contract With God Trilogy: Life on Dropsie Avenue""** These are available as independent volumes, but you can and should get the entire trilogy in one hardback volume so you can read them all at one go. Eisner is inarguably the creator of the graphic novel as an art form, and Contract With God is inarguably the first proper graphic novel, but it's not just worth owning for its historical context. It's beautifully drawn and has Eisner speaking in his most distinct voice, telling the story of one block in New York City over decades. You will read this one over and over.

**Derf - ""My Friend Dahmer""** John Backderf was already an established comics artist when he released this revelatory book, in which he reveals that he was casual friends with serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in high school, before he became a murderer. Derf mostly dials down his usual snarkiness to tell a story of awkward adolescence and marginalization leading into insanity and murder. 

**Darwyn Cooke - ""The Hunter,"" ""The Outfit,"" ""The Score,"" ""Slayground""** Remember that Mel Gibson movie ""Payback?"" It was loosely based on a novel by Donald Westlake. Darwyn Cooke used that and several other Westlake book as the basis for a series of absolutely smashing graphic novels about Parker. The result is taut, gripping stuff: hard-boiled 60s noir that is just dripping with style. Cool as fuck.

**Jeff Lemire - ""The Complete Essex County""** Lemire is another guy with an extensive bibliography. Some people will tell you his best work is ""The Underwater Welder,"" (which is pretty good) but ""Essex County"" is my favorite. It manages to be sprawling, patient, and honest all at once. This just got optioned by the CBC for a tv series. Read it before then so you can be all hipster and shit.

**Farel Dalrymple - ""The Wrenchies""** This is my most recent favorite thing to recommend. ""The Wrenchies"" is insane. It's a superhero comic, it's about a post-apocalyptic Lord of the Flies society, weird fat kids, time travel, ghosts, spaceships, comic books, and magic; Dalrymple takes this insane stew of ideas and makes it into a cohesive whole. I've read this five or six times and I'm still not entirely sure what happens in it, but it's ballsy and fantastic and there's nothing like it.

1185,"She's got a full head of hair now and is on much less invasive therapy. She just takes immunosuppressants and antibiotics. And she's lost the steroid weight and gained back all of her strength (for a few months, she also couldn't step up on a curb without help and couldn't walk more than a few feet before needing a rest. The disease nearly killed her about 18 months ago, but the cure was a bitch and a half, lemme tell you). But now she's a normal kid, she looks and acts normal, rides her bike, runs all over the place, just a normal kid. 

Well, maybe not normal. She had so many surgeries and injections and chemo treatments that the only way we found to get her through it emotionally and spiritually was to tell this little seven-year-old girl ""You're a warrior. You have super-strength. You have powers no normal kid has. **YOU'RE A GODDAMN WARRIOR.**"" And the whole time we're pumping her full of steroids and telling her she's a goddamn warrior, so when she got her strength back she was running out the front door of the house and I shit you not, beating up the other kids in the neighborhood, girls and boys. I had one of the parents of a boy in the neighborhood ask me ""hey, can you tell your daughter to quit punching my kid all the time?"" SHE'S A WARRIOR, **A GODDAMN WARRIOR.** We had to have a talk with her about hitting, and bossing other kids around all the time. I told her she's like the Hulk, and she has to control her powers.

Oh and she's had the lenses of both eyes removed and replaced with  permanent ceramic implants, due to cataracts she developed from the steroid treatment. So now she has artificial robot eyes.

I think sometimes of what my brother-in-law told me when my wife first got pregnant and we were freaking out about what to do about this that and the other thing with the kid, and this has become the theme of my life as a parent: ""Don't worry, you'll figure it out.

My daughter has been on various forms of chemotherapy for a vascular disease for about the last year and a half. One of the initial drugs that she was on caused hair loss, but she was also on steroids at the same time, so instead of becoming bald and skinny, she became bald and chubby. The idea some people have in their head that every kid on chemo turns into a bald pale skeleton isn't accurate. 

That aside, I can tell you as a parent who was forced by medical necessity to shave his seven-year-old daughter's head (and by ""medical necessity"" I mean that her hair was falling out in clumps every time we washed or brushed it, due to her meds), I read a news article like this and I wonder what the fuck is wrong with this woman. Shaving my daughter's head while she sat in a bathtub crying was, to put it mildly, kind of a low point in my life.

I'd really enjoy reading some specific examples of the ""new way of telling a story"" that Lucas provided, as well as the ""subtle yet still important character building.""

&gt;You say 'we wanted to see obi and anakin having adventures'... no.. you wanted to see that because you had already built up in your mind what 1-3 should have been.

No, I didn't do that. *Lucas did.* Every time young Anakin and young Kenobi are discussed by anyone in Episodes 4 thru 6, it's in the framework of how they were great friends who had all of these amazing adventures. Kenobi didn't say ""well, we stood around in elevators and talked a lot, and we went to some meetings. And Anakin whined a lot."" 

There's a moment in Episode 3 where Anakin turns to Kenobi while they're standing around blathering on about things, and Anakin says ""remember that time you fell into a nest of Gundarks?"" No. We don't. AND THAT'S WHAT AUDIENCES WANT TO SEE. [We don't want to be told about things like that, we want to see them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell)

&gt;And your last sentence? REALLY?!?! ""Does anything actually happen in that movie that changes the characters from where they were in Episode 1 to where they are in Episode 3?"" Wow. Just.. wow. As if that's a requirement?

Yes, that is a requirement. It's called a [character arc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_arc) ",2015-11-20 10:27:09+00:00,cx6riab,3.0,t1_cx6rc1r,775.0,movies
1277,"The prequels weren't lousy because they ""weren't like the originals."" 

The prequels were lousy because they were slow, boring, and concerned things that nobody cares about. Who honestly wanted to see Vader as a six year old for an entire movie? Who wanted to see how they closed the financial deal to make the Death Star? Who wanted to see Boba Fett as a six year old for an entire movie? Who wanted to see Senate meetings and meetings about space taxes and meetings about trade embargos?

What we wanted to see was young Anakin and young Obi Wan having the adventures they had before Anakin fell. And we don't get to see that. We do get to see them standing around talking about it. ""Hey, remember those adventures we had?"" No, George, we don't.  What we wanted to see was a newly-fallen Vader cutting a swath across the galaxy and hunting down Jedi and developing the reputation that he has in Episode 4. What we wanted to see was an adventure, one that has a story where we don't know exactly what is going to happen all the way down the line. 

I don't want the new movies to be ""just like the originals."" I just don't want them to be boring crap with stuff nobody cares about. 

Look, I get it. Listening to people bitch endlessly about movies is fucking tiresome. But you're not a superior fan or a better friend of Star Wars or whatever because you just lay back and don't give a shit about the content of the movies. Can you honestly say that you're entertained by Attack of the Clones? There's a few okay scenes in it, but are you honestly engaged by the story? Does anything actually happen in that movie that changes the characters from where they were in Episode 1 to where they are in Episode 3? I don't think so.

Quinn's book takes place in a universe running backwards from whatever entropy lies at the end of ours back to the big bang. And it's set on an Earth populated by humans moving backwards through history, and backwards through the human life cycle: we are ""born"" when our corpse is removed from the earth, then revived into life, then reunited with wife and children, and everyone grows younger and younger until they become a baby and are absorbed into their mother's womb.

It's an absolutely fascinating book, but every time I read through it I'm struck by the realization that the book's central conceit doesn't quite work, primarily because the action is shown in forwards-oriented terms: people talk, have conversations that move linearly forward, and yet involve the subject of what it's like to live in the universe they inhabit. 

The one question that I come back to when reading it is of free will: do these people possess it? Can they do whatever they want? Is murder possible? That last question is sort of addressed in the book but a clear answer is never given. And ultimately the ending of the book seems like kind of a copout to me, like Quinn had set up this grand journey (and it is a grand journey, one worth following), but didn't quite know how to end it. 

So there it is: a wonderful, fascinating book that is basically built on a broken engine. ",2015-11-18 00:47:25+00:00,cx3yzl0,1.0,t3_3t6o3a,24077.0,graphicnovels

I only found out about my daughter's behavior because I went and talked to the parents of another kid in the neighborhood. And holy moses do I wish somebody had spoken up to me earlier. So if you have an idea of who might have written the message, go and **ask** the parents about it. Don't make accusations or go crazy, just ask some questions and see if you can find out what's going on so you can talk to your own kid about it in an informed manner.

And there's something else you're gonna want to keep in mind-- little girls do this kind of thing. There is soooo much drama. My daughter and her two besties are constantly squabbling, declaring this one or that one is not their friend anymore, and they've been that way for years (not in response to my kid's hitting problem, which apparently started only recently).

1311,"A few recommendations:

**Dan Clowes - ""Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron,"" ""David Boring,"" ""Ghost World""** If you ask me, Clowes is the greatest living comics creator. His bibliography goes further than what I've listed here, but I think those three are his best books. He's got a new graphic novel coming out next year which looks promising. By the way, if you've seen the ""Ghost World"" movie, you should still read the book. It's different enough that you won't feel like you know what's going to happen on every next page.

**Seth - ""It's a Good Life If You Don't Weaken,"" ""Clyde Fans""** Seth is fantastic. Some of the best work about nostalgia ever written.

**Charles Burns - ""Black Hole""** If you ask me at any given time what my favorite graphic novel is I'm likely to give a different answer, but frequently I'll say Black Hole. The book is equal parts teenage confessional, horror story, and fucked-up superhero allegory. The art is precise and beautiful and merciless.

**Alison Bechdel - ""Fun Home"" ; Chris Ware - ""Jimmy Corrigan, The Smartest Boy on Earth"" ; Chris Thompson - ""Blankets,"" ""Habibi"" ; Art Spiegelman - ""Maus""** So much has been written about these guys I just feel like I'm repeating everyone else by talking about them. But these are all essential stuff. Read all of them.

*Will Eisner - ""The Contract With God Trilogy: Life on Dropsie Avenue""** These are available as independent volumes, but you can and should get the entire trilogy in one hardback volume so you can read them all at one go. Eisner is inarguably the creator of the graphic novel as an art form, and Contract With God is inarguably the first proper graphic novel, but it's not just worth owning for its historical context. It's beautifully drawn and has Eisner speaking in his most distinct voice, telling the story of one block in New York City over decades. You will read this one over and over.

**Derf - ""My Friend Dahmer"" John Backderf was already an established comics artist when he released this revelatory book, in which he reveals that he was casual friends with serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in high school, before he became a murderer. Derf mostly dials down his usual snarkiness to tell a story of awkward adolescence and marginalization leading into insanity and murder. Derf's got another book that just came out last week (""Trashed"") which is currently on it's way from Amazon to me. Can't wait.

**Darwyn Cooke - ""The Hunter,"" ""The Outfit,"" ""The Score,"" ""Slayground""** Remember that Mel Gibson movie ""Payback?"" It was loosely based on a novel by Donald Westlake. Darwyn Cooke used that and several other Westlake book as the basis for a series of absolutely smashing graphic novels about Parker. The result is taut, gripping stuff: hard-boiled 60s noir that is just dripping with style. Cool as fuck.

**Jeff Lemire - ""The Complete Essex County""** Lemire is another guy with an extensive bibliography. Some people will tell you his best work is ""The Underwater Welder,"" (which is pretty good) but ""Essex County"" is my favorite. It manages to be sprawling, patient, and honest all at once.

**Farel Dalrymple - ""The Wrenchies""** This is my most recent favorite thing to recommend. ""The Wrenchies"" is insane. It's a superhero comic, it's about a post-apocalyptic Lord of the Flies society, weird fat kids, time travel, ghosts, spaceships, comic books, and magic; Dalrymple takes this insane stew of ideas and makes it into a cohesive whole.

I'm not a WoW fan. I've never played a single Warcraft game, so anything you show me from this movie is unaffected by fandom or a knowledge of the source material. And like so many others have already said, the whole thing just looks boring.

I will still show up at my polling place on election day because there's local initiatives that I want to vote for that are piggybacked on every presidential election, but I won't be voting for president unless something big changes.

1468,"I really wanted to like this movie. I tend to spool out a lot of extra rope when I see a movie that tries for something big or unusual or risky, and I wound up spooling out a lot of rope for Cloud Atlas, but at the end of the movie I just don't see it all adding up to anything significant. I get that the different characters are connected souls, it's just that those connections don't really point towards anything that rings as significant to me. So the final message is... what exactly? That the things we do affect the future and the people who come after us? That just seems like such a banal observation that all of the trouble the story goes to doesn't seem worth it. I mean, everybody already knows that, right? 

Cloud Atlas certainly is a good-looking film, and I like that it takes risks and that it gambles big. But not every film that gambles big comes out a winner, and this is one of those times where the gambles don't pay off. 

Ultimately the film seems like a bunch of really interesting set pieces to me that really don't add up to anything.

As far as gameplay, it's a mixture of Assasin's Creed and GTA. And the game does this really interesting thing with color: you have to liberate Paris and the surrounding areas in sections by eliminating the German presence through sabotage, and the unliberated sections are shown in almost black-and-white with isolated elements of color (something like the movie Sin City). When you liberate a section, the color returns in full bloom.

1556,"I helped my 8yo daughter lose about 20 pounds recently. She had been diagnosed with a disease and hospitalized for several weeks and spent about a year on medication which caused her to gain weight rapidly, she was at about 100 pounds when we were able to get her off of enough meds to start losing weight. Here's my advice:

1. Stop buying shitty food. This means everyone, you, mom, and him. Don't have it in the house. No ice cream, no crackers, no cookies, no chips,. No junk food. Fruits, vegetables, meat. That's it. And don't take him with you when you go grocery shopping. Do it alone so you don't have to say ""no"" six hundred times going through the store. Bring home the food and cook it. If he doesn't want to eat it, fine. Let him go hungry. He'll eat the healthy stuff when he's hungry. This is important: **YOU MUST DO THIS AS A FAMILY.** You absolutely cannot let him see you or mom or grandma and grandpa eating junk food and expect him to stay eating healthy. For the time being, you should also stop eating in restaurants. Restaurant food, at least in America, is a fucking nightmare. It's loaded with salt and fat. All of it. Even the ""healthy"" stuff. So get used to eating at home. If gramma &amp; grampa won't participate in eating healthy around him, stop bringing him around gramma &amp; grampa.

2. Exercise every day. When my daughter was at her top weight and lowest strength, we started with a one-mile walk through the neighborhood every day. EVERY DAY. I know, you work all day and you're tired when you get home and you still have to cook dinner and you just want to sit your dead ass on the couch and relax. Tough shit. You walk a mile through the neighborhood with him every day. He will cry. He will bitch and whine. He will refuse to go. If he refuses, he's grounded. No video games. No TV. No toys. No friends. All of that unlocks when he's done with the walk or whatever exercise you choose. 

3. Stay strong and stay unified with his mother on this. Don't capitulate to whining. And he will scream and cry and bitch and moan to get his way. Ignore it. This is often the hardest part. All of your efforts will be useless if he can just go whine to his mom and get goodies. No more goodies. 

You can do this. Talk to your wife-to-be and then get started. And know that **YOU MUST DO THIS. THIS IS SAVING HIS LIFE.**

1589,"[The Wrenchies by Farel Dalrymple](http://www.amazon.com/The-Wrenchies-Farel-Dalrymple/dp/159643421X) - This is one of those books that nearly defies description. It's about the end of the world, and heroes, and ghosts, and comics, and mythology, and adolescence, and loss. There's elements of Lord of the Flies, and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and superhero team books, and off-the-wall sci-fi, and time travel, and classic fantasy, and fucked-up horror... jesus it's a weird book. Trying to deconstruct it leaves you with a bunch of pieces and parts that look like they utterly should not fit together in any kind of meaningful way, but the whole is definitely more than the sum of the parts. It's an amazing book. And the art is just gorgeous. I've read through this four times already and I'm still not sure I get entirely what's happening. 

Dalrymple casually tosses around bonkers fantasy concepts the way Morrison does, but adds a level of heart to it that Morrison never reaches. Here's a taste: there's a comic book in this story that contains a magic spell that will summon a group of heroes to save a post-apocalyptic Earth... and that comic book is the one you're reading.

1616,"""So I think it's about time I write down that pizza girl fantasy,"" thought Kevin as he climbed the stairs to his dorm room. It had been a rough Tuesday night-- Tuesdays were his regular Magic The Gathering meetup and he'd taken a proper drubbing at the table. 

The apartment door shut behind him as Kevin dropped his Jansport backpack onto the floor and slumped into a chair. He grabbed his laptop from the end table and fired it up. ""Okay,"" he thought to himself, ""let's get this party started. Let's see... I am a sports guy, not a chubby pale blob like in real life. And on this Tuesday night my Sports ran late.""

*I am a Sports Man,* he typed. *And on most nights I am sportsing so late that I cannot cook my Sports Food, so I order pizza.*

""This is going great so far,"" thought Kevin. ""It's like I'm actually a Sports Man."" He continued typing.

*But before I eat my Sports Pizza I have to take a shower,* he typed. *So I can wash off all the mud, sweat, and...*

""And what else?"" he thought. ""OOH, GOT IT!""

*...and blood,* he typed, smiling broadly. *I always have to wash off the blood because I'm Sportsing so hard every night.* Kevin felt a rush of tingles all over his body. ""Sports Mans are so easy to impersonate,"" he chuckled, running his fingers over the keyboard again.

*So I order my Sports Pizza, and the girl who delivers it wants to fuck me, and does not look at me every night with a mix of pity and revulsion,* he typed. *She wants to fuck me so bad. She has never put the pizza on the doormat and stood ten feet back down the hallway after ringing the bell and said ""Please put the money on the floor"" after I open the door. Because she wants to fuck me so much.* At this point Kevin noticed the lump growing in his pants.
