doesn't change that. Once you drop the gameplay, all you've got storywise is another treasure hunt movie with unremarkable characters. 

Because the characters you found so charming in the game will be different, because they're played by different actors, so all that will really translate is basic character traits: Nathan is a handsome smart aleck. Elena's a plucky blonde who can hold her own. Does any of that sound really exciting? Or does it just sound like every other treasure hunt movie ever made? 

It's not that games can't necessarily be movies-- Assassin's Creed looks promising but that's mainly because there's a fairly large backstory and universe that can be recreated onscreen.

Yesterday I got a package from Amazon, and it was The Eternaut. 

It's a beautiful edition, too. It's about 350 pages, hardbound, with a gorgeous plastic overwrap and then a sturdy slipcase. If you've got Amazon Prime you can pick it up right now for under $30, and trust me brothers and sisters, at that price it's an absolute steal.

I'm about 40 pages in right now, first reading, and it is *fantastic.* It's a comic originally written in the late 50s, but it looks and reads like it was done much, much later. There's so much more care and attention paid to the artwork and story than almost anything else I've ever read from that period.

So I went to the vape shop down the road and bought a mod setup and a few bottles of juice. Over the next week I tapered off the cigarettes. Within a day or so of starting I was down from a pack a day to five cigarettes a day. That was a week ago. 

Yesterday on the way home from work I lit the second cigarette of the day and took four puffs before throwing it out the window of the car. A minute later I threw the rest of the pack out the window (yeah, I know, littering... fuck it).

So what the hell happened with FC2? About half of this book is a tantalizing plot, with Marla secretly taking Sebastian off of his meds to get him to fuck her the way he used to, which means Tyler resurfaces, and kidnaps his son...

She underwent dialysis and plasmapheresis. The summer that followed was spent on the couch, too weak to get up or go outside. She was put on a stack of chemotherapy medications which made her hair fall out and gain almost thirty pounds (that was the steroids). 

She went back to school in the fall and spent all of second grade as a bald seven-year-old girl with a chubby face that was unrecognizable to her friends.  She still came home every semester  with straight A's. We worked closely with the school administration to keep bullying due to her physical characteristics to a minimum, but she still cried some nights. She still went back in every morning. I told her every morning and night that she's a warrior, she has something special inside that nobody else has: she has the fire. 

She went to chemotherapy regularly and endured that torture. She cried and struggled through months of physical rehabilitation due to what her sickness did. Every day I reminded her: you are a warrior. You have the fire inside.

She slowly crawled out of the hole. It took months. She eventually got back on her bike, went back to the pool. She broke her arm falling off her scooter, got a cast. When we got home from the hospital I took a big fat sharpie marker and wrote **WARRIOR** down the inside of her arm cast where she could see it, in letters two inches tall.

She was tested for admittance into the Gifted program. She got in.

Her condition improved. We started coming off some medications. Her hair came back-- slowly, so slowly. She started losing some weight. 

When I go to pick her up from school, everyone knows her now. Teachers, students, kids from higher classes. She's finishing third grade now, but kids all the way up to fifth (which is the top grade in her elementary) all say hi, hug her, swap jokes, high fives. 

In my kid's school they don't have Class President or any of that. The school is divided into three Tribes which encompass all of the grades. The Tribes compete academically, on field day, on charity drives, things like that. The Tribes each have a leader, who is a fifth grader appointed by the faculty to lead that tribe, they're chosen based on academics, school participation, a couple of other factors. 

I got a call from the school principal yesterday. My daughter just tested into the upper-tier gifted program at school for Math and Language, a program called Signet. And they asked us to come to the fifth grade graduation program tonight, even though she's only in third grade now, for another reason.

Tonight at the fifth grade graduation, they announced the tribal leaders for next year in front of an auditorium filled with hundreds of people. They called my daughter's name and announced her as not only the new tribal leader, but **the first student in the history of the school to be appointed tribal leader in fourth grade.** She didn't know until they announced it. She walked and stood on the stage as hundreds cheered.

She loves scary stuff, she's a huge Five Nights at Freddy's fan (as are all of her friends); she's watched the Poltergeist movies as well as several other low-grade, non-R-rated horror movies at home with mom &amp; dad. 

So today our plan was to go to the movies; originally we were planning to go see the new Batman movie, but apparently it's wretched, and 2-and-a-half hours of bad movie didn't seem like the right idea. So I read a couple of parent-friendly reviews of ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" saw that it was really no more intense than anything she's seen already, and since it's a PG-13, I asked her if she wanted to see that. She got *very* excited.

So we watched it today-- first horror movie experience in the theatre. She loved it. A couple of times during the movie she turned to me and said ""this isn't really that scary,"" but during the film's climax she was wrapped around me like a sweater. I asked her a few times if she was okay. 'Yes' answer each time. Except the last, where she just shook her head 'No' with eyes glued to the screen. ""Do you want to leave?"" Shook her head 'no' again.

As soon as the credits rolled and we walked out of the theater she turned to me and shouted ""THAT WAS AWESOME!!!""

What a great day. Now I can go see PG-13 horror movies with my kid. I'm over the moon. ",Parenting,Took my daughter to see her first scary movie in the theater today.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/4ccg2e/took_my_daughter_to_see_her_first_scary_movie_in/

128,2016-03-07 16:28:32+00:00,self.Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/49de1r/so_we_were_at_the_playground_yesterday_dont_do/,False,"So yesterday was a great day to be outside: cool, crisp, dry and clear. Decided to take my 9-y.o. daughter to a nearby playground for an hour or so of playground fun. 

The one we went to is about a ten-minute drive away, and it's one that many parents drive to: it's one of those [Bob Leathers playgrounds](https://www.google.com/search?q=bob+leathers+playground&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=kDf&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi99PCY-q7LAhWG1B4KHbQ-ANcQsAQILg&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=970) with slides and forts and tire swings and stuff.

As a bit of background, my daughter is on chemotherapy, and has been for about 2 years. Her chemo previously made all of her hair fall out, but it's growing back now due to her being on less powerful medication. However, she still has a suppressed immune system due to her illness. She goes to school just fine, spends time around other kids with absolutely no restrictions, but my wife and I are still mindful about unnecessarily exposing her to germs and potential infections. 

So this playground is kind of a significant place to me, because it was one of the last dad-and-daughter outings we did right before she got sick two years ago. Like the day before. As a matter of fact, the last photo I took of my daughter before she got sick and had to go to the PICU and the nightmare started, that last photo was taken at this playground. And we haven't been back since.

So yesterday I decided to take her back there. Close the loop. We've done a lot of climbing back up out of the hole she fell into, and this was going to be another rung. I didn't even make it a big deal to her, it was just ""hey remember this place? Let's go back there again."" She hardly remembered going in the first place. But when we pulled into the parking lot she was all ""Oh I remember this! Awesoooome!""

So we park and get out, and we're running around doing slides, monkey bars, good stuff. And there's probably 40 or 50 other kids there. And one of the things they have is this big tire swing with a truck tire hung from chains, big enough for two or three little kids at once. 

So there's this older guy, gray hair and a beard, and he's standing next to the tire swing with his kids (or grandkids). And mine goes ""Dad I want to go on the tire swing."" 
""Well, let's wait until they're done, then we'll go."" 
So ten minutes goes by with this guy and his kids hogging the tire swing. Half the time they're not even swinging, just sitting in the thing. Whatever. I'll give them another couple minutes and if they don't move, I'll go ask for a turn. I'm not shy about that stuff. 

But I'm keeping an eye on this guy while we're doing other stuff, and I see him lean over and gob a huge mouthful of spit onto the ground right next to the swing, into the gravel that the whole playground is covered in. Well *that's* disgusting. Asshole. But I let it slide. 

Still waiting for our turn though. Still keeping an eye out to see when the swing is free. 

Then he hocks another one into the gravel. 

Then another one. Fuck, is he chewing tobacco or something?

So after the FOURTH time he leans over and slops a loogy into the gravel under the swing, I fucking lost it. I'm standing about 20 feet away and I yell ""HEY, WOULD YOU STOP SPITTING ON THE DAMN PLAYGROUND?"" He stops, smiles sheepishly and says ""okay.""

Still didn't move off the goddamn tire swing. But you know what? Now we CAN'T go on the tire swing, unless I want my immunosuppressed daughter to wade through the swamp of saliva and mouth bacteria this fucking asshole has created around the tire swing.  

So please, don't spit on the playground. That shit's disgusting.

There are no words for how fucking sick I am of people overreacting to this fucking movie.

She has a rare vascular disease, spent about a month in the ICU last summer, followed by several months on the couch and in bed recovering from the chemo she was on. Lost all her hair, gained about 30 pounds in weight and on an 8 year old, 30 pounds is fucking insanity. She looked like a cabbage patch kid but fatter. We've been weaning her off the steroids she was on and the weight's coming off, and her hair has come back somewhat but she still basically looks like a boy. But she's a girl, a sweet girl, my only girl. She loves cats and flowers and art.  

For Halloween she's going to be a cat.

But I just discovered tonight that the friends she grew up with, whom shes known since she was three, don't want to go trick or treating with her this year because when she plays with them she hits. She hits and kicks and is aggressive. 

Mom and me have sort of known she has an aggression problem but we didn't know it's gotten this bad. So tomorrow we're going trick-or-treating with a newish family in the neighborhood instead of her regular crew, because she's basically alienated her regular crew because she hits.

I found out tonight after work that the reason her two best friends don't want to trick or treat is because of her aggression problem. We talked for a long time tonight about hitting and why it's wrong.

And here's the fucking bitch of the bunch (sorry for the foul launguage, had a few beers): For the last year, **YEAR** of this 8 year old's life, the only way we've known to get her through the FUCKING TORTURE of chemo and medical treatment is to constantly tell my daughter that she's a fucking warrior, she's a fighter, she's strong, she can take it. It's been every day. But the side effect, the *side effect of keeping her alive* is that we've created this steroid-driven monster that smacks her friends when she's pissed off. 

She's also a straight-A student who's in the gifted program at school and just last week was invited to the after-school STEM program which we eagerly signed her up for.

But yeah, also the punching thing. 

We're making a fresh appointment with her post-chemo psychologist next week, guy we already know.

But she can't go trick-or-treating with her usual crew this year. Because the other 8-year-old girls don't want to be punched and kicked.

We talked about it a lot tonight.

And just now while I was putting her down in bed, letting her curl up with Mom in bed, I got a little jokey with her in bed while kissing  her g'night and she slapped me in the face. And then started crying. 

It broke my fuckin heart.

Because I knew 100% it was all true.

My baby still needs help. And we're gonna get it for her, but still.

I was surprised by how well-made and thoughtful the movie actually is.

Here's the problem: the movie is very, *very* critical of how the internet is changing social interaction, and asks a lot of questions that the movie (or anyone really) doesn't have the answers to. And I believe that a lot of people had a knee-jerk reaction to the film's critical view of social media and just defensively lashed out against it. The throughline of the movie, hung on Carl Sagan's ""Pale Blue Dot,"" is that we're all here on this planet trying to get along as individuals, and now we have the internet, which is this fantastic new tool that allows us to communicate our most intimate thoughts with each other all the time. But we don't really know how to effectively use it yet, or where the boundaries are.

It is by no means a perfect movie, but also by no means a terrible one. The performances are all solid (including another substantial dramatic role for Adam Sandler, probably his best work since Punch Drunk Love). The cinematography is elegant and well-crafted, and the soundtrack is utterly fantastic.

This one has stuck with me-- I watched it last night and I've been walking around thinking about it all day. I don't need a movie to be perfect and answer all the questions it asks. I just want it to ask questions worth thinking about.
