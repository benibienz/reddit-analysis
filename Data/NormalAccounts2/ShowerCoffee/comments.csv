0,"It'd be really cool for them to be ""niche"" rather than ""competitive"" I think.

Also, what do you mean by the third option? Like an additional skill line that would be available to regular players that vamp/ww players wouldn't have access to? Interesting idea...",2015-08-02 01:21:54+00:00,ctofuvc,2,t1_ctoffw6,851,elderscrollsonline
1,"The medium range drain is a great idea and I wouldn't mind a new ability. Especially if it added some more ""flavour"" to the whole vampire idea.

Mist and bats are great flavour-wise... they make you FEEL different. Drain makes sense as a vampire spell, but its kinda lackluster in the flavour department imo. (see drain vs feeding animation/fx)",2015-08-02 01:17:54+00:00,ctofqk6,2,t1_ctof4em,1269,elderscrollsonline
