From my understanding the most common and accepted ways of developing personality are through symbolism and narrating. Correct me if I'm wrong!

If I were to simply sit down and write for extended periods of time would it have a similar outcome? If I had it all written out do you guys believe it would best to then take the script and narrate it to my Tulpa? or would writing extensively be sufficient in and of itself.

TL;DR: Would writing about my Tulpa be viable to flesh out their personality and character?",Tulpas,Tulpas (Tulpae?) and Writing,http://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/3h1vmt/tulpas_tulpae_and_writing/

Personally, I'd like to see vampire and werewolf come with huge drawbacks and unique/powerful advantages. 

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe the current direction of vampires/werewolves is necessary for balance? Would you like to see these conditions as more ""monstrous?"" 

Feel free to share any ideas you might have!
