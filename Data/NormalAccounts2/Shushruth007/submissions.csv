My question is why didn't she just allow him to go back to him master, if the master pays him for his service.
Barristan later points out that allowing former slaves to go back to their masters might be a bad idea since the free slaves will be free only in name. but paying them would solve that. does she not understand money?",gameofthrones,[S4/BOOKS][Ep 10]Daenerys and Meereen's Employment System,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3julhd/s4booksep_10daenerys_and_meereens_employment/

1- Heartseeker is gone for hunters  
2- Sprint is now kinda useless and the rise of the hastened fatalis has arrived.
3- Quin's may be a decent item pick now.  
The only think I see new with hunters is that they're power spike happens a little late, with triple crit they still 2 shot people late game and with HS gone the next best alternative is either the devo's or a new build with transcendence. plus is the Banshee build more or less viable now?
