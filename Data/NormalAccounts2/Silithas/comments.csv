But since you know a bit regarding mobos, would this damage be fatal for the build? Dunno how i managed to get it as it appeared when i got it back from the store as i tried to get my money back, but couldn't because of the damage. And probably need a pcb trace pen to repair it?

Yeah, only gonna use it for steam games, so no optical needed. And already got the Os on a usb.

Already got the case ready, just need to switch the cooler back to original on the titan as the giga cooler fits in the case, just not on the mobo cause of the audio imputs are too low.

454 usd for this:

And yes, if i imported the pc parts there, it would have had 25% import fee, 100 in shipping i think and issues with waranty as if i had to export it back on the waranty, that alone costs 45 bucks each time. So i prefer the local store over here.

Process for recording it? You mean what recorder? Mirillis action, and the recorded gameplay video is in MP4

No plugins or effects, not gonna begin with effects until i have learned how the program fully works, still pretty new to it after being used to sony vegas. 

Yep.

Here's a comparison pic. Original vs the rendered footage with the huge pixel bursts i get in the rendered video.

It isn't so pixelated elsewhere in the video, but not nearly as good as the original. And what i want is the video to be as identical in quality as the original recording which also was 6GB in size.

Is there any settings in FCP to customize and choose the rendering settings as you can in sony vegas?

It would seem that youtube cripples the quality by shortening the size from 6GB to 900MB (downloaded my own video to take a snap of the pixelated scene and the size was shortened by a 6'th of the original video (which ui unfortunately have deleted) which could be the reason for the pixelations. And i have no idea why.

So as of now, i will just stick with the issues until either a patch for the game arrives, or a jailbreak arrives for either 9.3.1 or a future ios patch that may cure the games's issues.
