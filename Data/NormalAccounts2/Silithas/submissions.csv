So my ship takes a long time to unload with 2x medium cargo containers, and a friend set up a docking port, and conveyor tubes from the docking to the large cargo container, but still it doesn't empty my cargo from the ship at all.

How do i serial attach a large container to my ship which already has 2 medium ones connected? And is there a way to add a ""bridge"" or serial connector from 4 drills to go into one container from the 2 side connectors? And is there a way to get one container to send the cargo to the container that is attached to the first one and so on with the third?

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yep.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Intended use only for movies and tv series. Mostly direct rips from my own purchased movies and tv series on bluray. Or play them from a bluray drive through Powerdvd i have on steam.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

No gaming at all.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Ballpark? Either way, no budget limit really, just as cheap, low power consuming and silent as possible

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

Norway. But only names of the parts is needed

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

Parts i thought of was: 
Cpu: AMD A6 7470K or AMD A8-7600 if quadcore is needed for high bitrate raw movies

Gpu: Buildt in

Motherboard: Nothing fancy, cheapest as possible

Ram: 4GB (doesn't matter what brand)

Psu: 350w or the cheapest one with hybrid cooling

And some noctua silent fans to make it as silent as possible.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Replace this text with your answer.

No additional details. Tho unsure if the amd cpu's i listed will suffice as my gaming pc's cpu always has been from the intel ""i5 and i7"" series.

**NOTE: You do not have to follow this format, but please be sure to answer these questions. Please do not ask to simply be given a build.
