Compare to the Rebel craft, who need to protect their pilots and thus have the fancy stuff like shields and a hyperdrive for hit-and-run tactics. Even the A-Wing had a built in drive when it's whole design was 'GOTTAGOFAST'.

K-Wing: Avro Lancaster (It's basically a Y-Wing that carries a ridiculous bombload)

X-Wing: Supermarine Spitfire or Hawker Hurricane (Both do multirole, both are iconic)

Y-Wing: Bristol Blenheim (Old bomber that was good in it's time but gets outshone by newer planes, could be used as a fighter if necessary)

I'd say no, esp since the fluff for the tracers is that you can follow the target across the damn galaxy

&gt;Would Kagi interrupt Thread Tracers - Kagi says when a ""ship acquires a target lock, it must lock onto your ship if able."" 

If the above is yes, than this'll be yes as well i'd imagine, 'must' is a pretty unambiguous~

&gt;Can you tractor beam someone off of the board 

It says 'perform a barrel roll/boost', so most likely no since you aren't allowed to normally.


&gt;Can the Ghost shoot TLT in full twice

I want to say yes since it's 'Attack: Perform this attack twice', but it could go either way since it's a wonderful special case

&gt; Is the Ghost's special firing arc active when there is no Phantom docked

I'd have to see if the manual-thing in the expansion pack comes with that, since I imagine they'd thought of it beforehand

&gt;Performing both Gonk actions with Experimental Interface - Common thought is that they are unique actions that can both be performed in one turn.

Not sure really, it's the first card that has two Actions on it if memory serves so it depends whether it's the card that can be used once or the actions themselves.

&gt; Does R5P8 trigger after Dengar has been destroyed - upgrade just says ""after defending"" which I think would happen before tallying up damage cards vs hull, so I would say yes it does trigger.

Five of the platoon were killed and three wounded including his section commander, Corporal W.H. Richards. Kelliher said to a companion, ‘I’d better go and bring him (Richards) in’, then suddenly got up, rushed the post and hurled two grenades at it. When he ascertained that some, but not all, of the enemy had been killed he returned to his section, seized a Bren gun, and again dashed forward to within thirty metres of the post and with accurate fire completely silenced it. He then went forward again, through heavy rifle fire, and successfully rescued his section leader who had been wounded in the shoulder.
