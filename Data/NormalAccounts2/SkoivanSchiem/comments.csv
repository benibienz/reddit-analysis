3,"&gt; Saints Row 2: To fix the issues you are having, you should download the Gentlemen of the Row mod. I've recently played it with the mod, and have had no problems.

Thanks! I looked into that actually and I've downloaded it, but there are so many options that I got a bit overwhelmed. All I want is for the performance to improve/be stable. And if there are higher-res textures or general graphics improvements, then that too. Would you know what in the GotR mod to toggle on for only those changes?

&gt; Zombie Army Trilogy: As the name implies, it's 3 games that were made at different times and the first game is exactly as you describe, and I agree it was pretty boring. The second one is a little better, while the 3rd game is very good and has plot, talkable NPCS, and a little more variety than the others. So I suggest you skip the first game, and just try the second, maybe even skip that, and play the third.

This thing is confusing me a bit actually... it's called a trilogy but when I launch the game, it only launches one game. I have no idea where to select whether to play the first, second, or third game :-/",2016-11-21 13:47:28+00:00,da9h64x,2.0,t1_da9h2up,185.0,patientgamers

8,"&gt; Seems like you're not very interested in most of the titles in your current list.

Not very interested right now only because around 90% of my attention is focused on **Civ 5**. If you remove that from the equation, I'm very interested in a lot of those titles.


&gt; I get the feeling you like turn-based games, have you tried the X-Com series?

I loved **XCOM: Enemy Unknown** but I haven't gotten around to **XCOM 2** yet. Partially because I'm waiting for the price to drop and partially because the reviews seem to be mixed.


&gt; You also mentioned you've been wanting to play some sim/management, I'd recommend Cities Skylines if you haven't tried it yet.

It's been on my wishlist for a while now, thanks! I'm planning to pick it up the next time it's on sale.


&gt; As for a traditional FPS with a bit more oldshcool level design instead of a constant horde mode I'd recommend Hard Reset. Apparently the new Doom is also good, but I haven't tried it yet.

Damn, I seem to remember Hard Reset being on discount for very cheap just a week or two ago when I was browsing on my phone one time. I wanted to pick it up but it completely slipped my mind once I got home.

As for DOOM, also been wishlisted for a while now, and will pick it up the next time it's on sale.

&gt;No one wants to see your entire backlog, it's big we get it. Most of ours are big too. Have the decency to pick between 3-5 games and then list those for suggestions. You would get more in depth answers and helpful advice that way. It's not a dick measuring contest.


The list is not meant as a showcase. I've been an active user of Steam long enough to know that my library is nowhere near the libraries of thousands of other Steam users, and I don't really care about library size anyway.


The only games in my collection that I removed from the list I posted are those that I've finished, and played but decided they were not worth revisiting. I purposely posted everything else because I literally could not decide on what to pick and was the counting on the wisdom of the sub to guide me through shortlisting the longlist.


&gt;I'm just tired of seeing those posts


Like I said, I didn't realize there were many other such similar posts to make you mad like this. Where are they? 



&gt;it baffles me people would think anyone has the time to read through everyone single one to give any real meaningful advice. Like I mentioned before, if you narrowed them down the quality of the advice you received would be a lot better.


The thread I created was actually received surprisingly well. I honestly knew that posting a list that long might be considered overindulgent, and if it got downvoted to oblivion then so be it, but I felt I had to see what would happen. So I did and it got many upvotes plus around a hundred replies, so much so that I've made a conscious effort to respond to as much as I can.


So contrary to what you're asserting, there are actually a lot of people who have taken the time to look at the list and respond meaningfully with quality advice, and I appreciate the effort of those who have done so. 


&gt;If you just want to share how many games you have (which isn't really a big deal if they are online only in the first place) then don't use a suggestion as an excuse just be forward about your intentions and I'm sure you would get a lot less aggravated responses out of it.


Like I said earlier, i don't care about collection size. I don't know why you're so hung up on that. And even though your post has gotten a lot of upvotes, you're the only one so far who has responded so openly aggravated by it.

One of my favorite games of all time! I just didn't think of it as a ""campaign"" which is why I didn't list it on the OP


&gt;Torchlight 2


Finished this and enjoyed it. Not as much as playing Diablo, but adequately enjoyable nonetheless. 


&gt;Grim Dawn


Haven't tried this yet. Will check it out. 


&gt;The Talos Principle


Played it for a while a couple of months ago, but I got to a point where the puzzles were stressing me out too much that I didn't find it fun anymore. Like I said above, I don't have a lot of time on my hands and this just seemed to be eating up my time too much when I was playing it. 


&gt;The Batman Arkham series


I actually own all of the games, but I tried playing Arkham Asylum a few weeks ago and it just didn't click for some reason. 


&gt;Alien: Isolation


Haven't tried this yet. Will check it out. 


&gt;Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon


Haven't tried this yet. Will check it out. How different is it from FC3? 


&gt;Tomb Raider (2013)


I loved this game. I describe it to friends as an interactive action movie. It's like Die Hard, but with a female lead, and on an island instead of a building.


I played this in the middle of playing Dishonored as sort of a ""palette cleanser"" because I wasn't so much in the mood for Dishonored. I finished it in two days.


Considering this, is Rise of the Tomb Raider a must play? 


&gt;Spec Ops: The Line


Loved this. Linear, on-the-rails, great atmosphere and narrative. Fun combat. Very solid FPS. 


&gt;Dishonored


Good, but not as good as I expected based on its reputation. 


&gt;And even though you said you don't want multiplayer, Rocket League is a really great game for people like you with short gaming time since each match lasts about 7-10 minutes, and it's just all around fun and not that competitive.  I'd recommend just staying in the non-ranked matches to avoid the more toxic people who play in ranked matches.  I've put around 200 hours into it so far, so you can easily rack up a lot of playtime on it.


I tried this when it had a free weekend once and I can see why it's so popular. But I can't see myself spending a lot of time with it. A lot of the fun for me when playing games comes from working towards an explicit objective and achieving it. So the fun for fun's sake sort of games don't really work for me and that's how I see Rocket League.",2016-10-27 09:42:19+00:00,d99rmgy,2.0,t1_d99quyf,2794.0,patientgamers

&gt; Link burst is when you eat and get an aragami bullet, and by shooting at your teammate you can send them to lv 3 burst that boost their attack power and jump heights. You can do that by holding r with the gun and firing it.


Oh okay great, I tried this literally just now and saw it for the first time in action. I've been wondering what the red triangluar crosshair was for. So this is basically a support action, and I can just spam Link Bursting throughout the mission to help my allies if I choose to play it like that?


&gt; Weapons are different, different play style depending on how you want to play. I personally just use the scythe for the quick devour.

I'm using a scythe too. I like the moveset. And the hammer as well. It reminds me of the hammer from Dark Souls.


&gt; Crafting different weapons give you certain advantage, like a cold attack or improved damage on guns and stuff like that.

My problem with this is that I can't find where it is in the crafting menu that says what ""element"" a certain weapon is. The first time I crafted a weapon is when I did a mission that said it would be wise to bring a Spark weapon... so I went to the crafting menu and looked for something that said spark, but there was none.

With complex programs that have a lot of individual systems running and interacting with each other, it's very easy to get caught up with getting the damn thing to just work and forget making it work efficiently.


There are many ways to code a feature to make it work; and sometimes, the easiest way to make it work isn't exactly the most efficient. But especially considering that a lot of dev teams work on a very tight schedule, I would guess that there are some things that are just coded the easiest/fastest way and no time is left to optimize it, which results in some games being shipped out in working condition, but not exactly working as efficiently as one would expect it to.


In my experience, classic examples of code that can be better optimized would be loops that loop more than needed (or worse, loops that loop infinitely) and objects that aren't cleaned up correctly (i.e. - ""garbage collection"").",2016-10-06 14:45:54+00:00,d8gh8qq,1.0,t3_565kze,1717.0,pcmasterrace

http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps3/931330-bioshock/answers/108290-should-i-harvest-or-rescue-little-sisters


&gt; I don't know why everyone says it's only a net difference of 20 ADAM, but every harvest is 160 ADAM, and every rescue is 80 ADAM. For every 3 Little Sisters you rescue, you also get a bonus gift from Tenenbaum which will consist of 200 ADAM and bonus goodies such as plasmids, tonics, or ammunition. Since there are 24 Little Sisters in the game, if you were to do the math on it, you'd find that harvesting nets you 3840 ADAM, but rescuing nets you 3520 ADAM. This is a difference of 40 ADAM every 3 Little Sisters, and a difference of 320 ADAM overall.

&gt; Harvesting will get you more ADAM which will let you enjoy getting everything quicker, but rescuing will get you plasmids and tonics such as Hypnotize Big Daddy and Armored Shell 2. Both of these are INCREDIBLY helpful on Survivor difficulty. However, it should be mentioned that if you plan on upgrading all of your plasmids as soon as they come out, you won't be able to by rescuing Little Sisters. You simply don't get enough ADAM for that. You can, however, wait until later levels when prices drop (for instance, Incinerate 2 will be a lot cheaper when Incinerate 3 is in the Gatherer's Garden; Insect Swarm eventually sells for only 5 ADAM). However, this means you don't get access to the improved plasmids until much later - by which time, you probably no longer need them.",2016-09-20 02:18:35+00:00,d7u1w35,1.0,t3_53kxvg,4010.0,Bioshock

So for example you have around $450-500 for a CPU and GPU and you want to build a gaming rig around that, a combination of an i5-6500+GTX 1060 might be preferable over, say, an i7-6700+GTX 960 since you would probably want a stronger GPU without bottlenecking your system, especially if you play AAA games",2016-09-15 02:50:21+00:00,d7nc66d,3.0,t1_d7nbjj4,977.0,pcmasterrace

If you're building a PC for gaming, having a good GPU will usually take precedence over having a good CPU. But having said that, you shouldn't get a CPU (or RAM for that matter) that is too weak/low, because this can cause the GPU to not operate at maximum efficiency (typically called having ""a bottleneck"" in the system). 


If you're building a PC for video editing/rendering, I think a more powerful CPU takes priority over everything else, though I could be wrong. 


If you're just going to use the PC for office/school, media, internet... I don't think a lot of consideration is needed as most modern gen CPUs with integrated GPus will be able to handle that even without a dedicated GPU in the system.

612,"&gt;My very first class on ds2 was a swordsman too, I ditched the short sword pretty early and went to use the curved sword, then invested in a Rapier, 

Great! I also ditched the sword and have a Rapier +3 and Scimitar +2 right now. 

&gt;( fun fact: if you leveled your Str and Dex by a couple of points then long press triangle while dual weilding you can enter the powerstance mode: it will unlock a new pose for your character and a new moveset attacking with both your weapons at the same time)

Whoa I had no idea. How high does my STR and DEX need to be for this? 

&gt;It's definitely good to have a shield in your off hand, the large leather shield is a good choice even though it's not a 100% physical damage reduction, it's still light and stable.

So many conflicting opinions regarding the use of a shield :) I'll try both alternately and see what works best. 

&gt;About ADP it directly influence your agility stat, I would say 96 or 99 is alright and will carry you through the game, but the ideal would be 105.

Every 1 point of ADP seems to raise Agility by 0.75. I think I'll bump agi up to 96 first and then see how it works from there. Tnx!

620,"&gt;In DS2 shields are fine but use more stamina to block, you need to learn to play without it, the game actually encourage you and reward you for it.

I started with a swordsman, which has dual swords and no shield. I was thinking maybe I should get a shield since I don't really see what the advantages of dual-wielding are. Also, is there any advantage to dual wielding as opposed to two-handing?

&gt;And most importantly, in order to ditch the shield you need to roll more efficiently, level up your ADP which will raise your agility, which will give you more invincibility frames while rolling.

Unfortunately, I'm at level 20 right now and have put all my stats in DEX. How much ADP should I be aiming for? And what other stats should I look to allocate more points to?

The purpose of the build will be almost purely for gaming at 1080p, hoping to run ultra/high settings for most games smoothly, especially games like Witcher 3, Far Cry Primal, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and the like.

How much of a performance hit would it be if I pick the i3-6100 over the i5-6400? Consider that I will probably be getting the AMD RX480, which pundits estimate to sell for around 11,000. 

How and by how much does a SSD actually improve gaming? I thought that its only improvement is with loading time but it really has no bearing on fps. If that's the case, I think I can live without it.

677,"Another good point. Let's take the Brock news for example... the UFC would have broken the news at the end of the broadcast anyway, and I think Ariel mentioned on his latest podcast that he knew this. So by breaking the news an hour ahead of the UFC... this was like ""flexing his muscles"" so to speak? Because unlike other kinds of breaking news like fighter updates or even matches that the UFC is scheduled to announce in 1-2 days, the breaking of the Brock news seemed totally unnecessary and self-serving.

I'm using those terms pragmatically and not to vilify Ariel. I don't know how else to put it. It just seems to be the reality of the situation. ",2016-06-07 11:40:36+00:00,d3zbfw4,2.0,t1_d3zb40x,893.0,MMA

681,"Yes, I did say in the OP that getting the news first decades ago meant good things for the news outfit: prestige, relevancy, and (I just implied this) sales. Though sports organizations then actively gave this news to news contacts that they had because the capability for them to break the news themselves was non-existent. They didn't own newspapers. They didn't own TV channes. If they wanted news to go out, they either had to call their news contacts or call a press conference, but still invite the news contacts that they had. 

My point is that the culture of getting the news first was fueled by the sports organizations having to go through the news channels to get their news out. 

These days however, with the internet and information being spread with such ease, sports organizations can do whatever they want with their news in their own terms. So for us consumers, what does it even matter if Ariel tweets about the Brock news 2 hours before the UFC announces it? If Ariel hadn't done that, what would anyone other than Ariel have really lost?

Great, I'll follow this! But I was thinking maybe equip a Unity on the follower and myself for one of the ring slots? This would mean that I would have to swap out my CoE.

F*************ck you're so right on this one. It completely did not occur to me that I should go for secondary resistance instead of res all.

Get Kanai's Cube, start running normal rifts to get greater riftstones, run greater rifts, do bounties to get plans, designs, loot, and crafting materials --- get all of the loots!

See [THIS](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win) link and [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3q8lh2/is_the_definition_of_pay_2_win_mechanics_expanding/) link. It simply means paying for a competitive advantage, which Clash Royale definitely allows you to do, and you can't seem to get that through your head.

&gt; Did you wanted the game to be 100% free?

No. You said that Clash Royale was ""pay to win"" - which is wrong - so I refuted that. I've paid for in-game things before. I never said that ""pay to win"" is wrong, or that I wanted Clash Royale to be 100% free. You just became defensive.",2016-03-02 23:59:54+00:00,d0le7rl,8.0,t1_d0kwrwa,23437.0,AndroidGaming
892,"typically defined as like that, where? Just based on anecdotal evidence, most discussions of P2W I've come across define it quite simply: Paying to gain a gameplay advantage.

If you google ""define pay to win"", [the first hit](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win) defines it exactly like that (sure it's urbandictionary, but highly rated UD entries are usually accurate). The top comment [on this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3q8lh2/is_the_definition_of_pay_2_win_mechanics_expanding/) similarly defines it as simply paying money for an advantage, which is exactly what the IAPs in Clash Royale offers, which is why I was arguing that it was inaccurate to say that it's not pay to win.",2016-03-02 17:08:01+00:00,d0kvtqf,6.0,t1_d0kv0ch,1097.0,AndroidGaming

So yeah it's clearly pay to win in the very sense of the term.There's really no explaining it further than that.

894,"&gt;I recommend that you watch some high ranked matches and see just how much strategy is involved in the gameplay. Most of them even use low valued free, low cost cards because of said strategy.

Yes I've already seen high-ranked matches via the TV feautre. Yes there are low-valued cards that see action in high-ranked play. Almost any deckbuilding game - like Magic and Hearthstone - shows that. But that doesn't mean that they don't use rares and epics in their decks. And even if they use commons and uncommons, those cards with still be leveled up as high as possible... and this levelling up of cards and getting the rares and epics... this is made easier by *spending real money*",2016-03-02 16:19:21+00:00,d0ktorm,4.0,t1_d0ksume,1202.0,AndroidGaming
895,"&gt; you will still have to beat people in order to acquire the chests

No. You can buy chests with gems and purchased chests open immediately.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; but that is terrible value for your money

Value for money isn't the issue. There are many people with lots of money who are willing to pay and not get the best value for their money if it means gaining a competitive advantage.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; In theory, any game can be pay to win

Any game can be pay to win if the devs make them that way. But there are many games where the IAPs are merely cosmetic and have no effect whatsoever to the gameplay. Those games aren't pay to win. Clash Royale is though.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; unlocking cards faster in Clash Royale doesn't mean it is auto win vs other people, in the least.

""Pay to win"" doesn't literally mean automatically winning. It means using real money to gain a competitive advantage over players playing for free so that it's much easier for you to win. And that's totally doable in Clash Royale because you can buy thousands of gems right out of training, then buy Super Magical Chests that immediately open, and build a deck full of rares and epics which you could upgrade lots of times with the resources that your real money has bought. On the other hand, players playing for free right out of training are stuck pretty much with a bunch of Level 1 commons. I know I said that ""pay to win"" doesn't literally mean automatically winning, but in this specific scenario, you have to be catatonic to lose with that sort of an advantage.

896,"This game is totally P2W. If your logic is that it isn't because you're being matched with people of equal rank, that reasoning is misguided. If I just completed the Clash Royale training stage and decided to buy a ton of gold and gems with real money, then I could buy high-ranked chests and open them immediately, thus giving me the cards I need to build a strong deck... 

...and since the matchmaking is trophy-based, I would still be matched against players playing the game free with poor decks, which would mean that I'd be able to steamroll over them with my strong deck built with real money even if I've just come out of basic training.

I do agree that this is perfect for people who can't play all the time. Unfortunately, because the gameplay is quite alright, lots of people do want to play and progress through the game faster than the game allows.",2016-03-02 15:52:11+00:00,d0ksk3n,2.0,t1_d0kpxht,4109.0,AndroidGaming

&amp;nbsp;

My thoughts on Clash Royale:

The gameplay is okay. It's a PvP deckbuilding tower offense game is how I'd put it. 

Matches are short and fast-paced, which is nice. But I really don't like how you have to wait for X amount of time for your chests to open (you get chests by winning matches, and they contain coins and cards), where X increases proportional to the rarity of the chest. As if that's not enough, you can only have 4 chests queued for opening at any given time and you can only open a chest one at a time.

So when you already have 4 chests queued, I don't see what's the point in playing any more matches. There is still fun in the mere playing of the matches due to the intriguing gameplay, but once your chest row is full, there's some appeal lost in playing since there is much less at stake / lesser goals.

I've tried it with Chrome and Firefox on my home laptop (running Ubuntu)  and office laptop (running Windows) and it's really an issue. 

Other than that, can you possibly include a feature that upgrades all of the dice equally to the max number of sides you can buy with your gold if your gold is not enough to upgrade the dice to max sides? When you have 70 sides but have enough gold to upgrade only from d3 to d60, it takes a while to press 'Q'  57 times. Could there be a button that will take care of that in one press? And it's not the same as hitting 'E' with insufficient funds since what that does is upgrade some dice to max sides while leaving the others at min sides.

So far, the only other artist I've discovered that hits the spot is Blue Scholars, and I think that their self-titled album and Bayani are amazing.

Aside from that I also enjoyed The Coup and Jurassic 5 a bit, but not quite at the level that I loved Blackalicious and Blue Scholars.

The shorter the discharge (low DoD), the longer the battery will last. If at all possible, avoid full discharges and charge the battery more often between uses.""
* ""Allow partial discharges and avoid full ones""
* ""Perform shallow discharges. Instead of discharging to 0% all the time, lithium-ion batteries do best when you discharge them for a little bit, then charge them for a little bit.""
* ""The Li-ion batteries prefer a shallow discharge. Partial discharges produce less wear than a full discharge and the capacity loss per cycle is reduced.""

1293,"Here was the answer:

""This is a 3D reconstruction of a bone-weighted CT thorax. As presented, the image is of low technical quality being apparently taken from Instagram (?) The highlighted injury appears to be a fracture of the 10th or 11th rib on the patients left. The density from the reconstructed CT suggests it's an entirely bony injury with no cartilage involved. The fracture is full thickness allowing movement of the distal fragment. The fragment is at the distal end of the rib (most anterior) and is displaced laterally. No other bony abnormalities are visible on the views presented. 

TL;DR - bony rib fracture of either rib 10 or 11, all the way through, with the broken-off bit flapping merrily in the breeze.""",2015-07-02 15:00:30+00:00,cspwjw3,1.0,t3_3bvlic,906.0,MMA

1313,"Context: For the first hour in that graph, Spotify was playing constantly while I was browsing the Play Store for lock screens, installing them, and then uninstalling them (lol). Then for the next hour I watched 2-3 anime episodes using VLC. Then I had lunch and didn't use my phone that much for around 30-45 mins. Then upon coming back from lunch, I had Spotify constantly playing + some moderate browsing on various apps up to now.

Considering heavy Spotify usage, a significant amount of browsing/downloading/installing, plus maybe an hours worth of watching video files via VLC... does a projected total usage of 9hrs from 100% to 0% sound bad or just par for the course?
