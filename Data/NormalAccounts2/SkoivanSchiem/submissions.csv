I'm not as enamored by it as its reputation suggests. While the production values are top notch, I feel like the core gameplay quickly becomes stale. 


**Bit Trip Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien** - installed this while I was thinking of something that my 3-year old could maybe handle. Unfortunately the whole timing of the jumps correctly and consistently is still beyond her capability. For me it's okay but not something I'd spend a long time with. 


**Child of Light** - Installed this just to get a feel for it. I love the art style and turn based combat. It looks like something I'd enjoy if I were at a point where I wasn't addicted to any other game. Haven't come back to it yet.


**Dark Souls III** - Kept it installed for the DLC, but lo and behold, I actually don't care to play it. That doesn't change the fact that I think it's a 10/10 game. I'm just over my Souls phase right now after having played over 300 hours in the course of 3 months. I'll get back to that sometime for sure. 


**DoDonPachi Resurrection** - Really good port. Throwback to my shmup phase a few years ago (a genre I never got good at but immensely enjoyed and will continue to enjoy) and it still hits the spot when I just want to blow things up. 


**Don't Starve** - Installed this because I bought the Android port, actually spent time to research how to survive the first handful of days, and actually enjoyed it. If I weren't so preoccupied playing Civ 5 right now I feel like I'd be on this game hard. 


**Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen** - I really wanted to like this, but I'm not quite feeling it. I must admit that the graphics do feel dated, and it's been a long time since I've been in the mood to play a game with a lot of story and mechanics to wade through before you can get your feet firmly planted in it. I just can't play those right now because I can't really immerse myself in games anymore due to lack of spare time and parenting responsibilities, so I'm not quite at a place right now to enjoy this game. 


**Invisible, Inc.** - I bought this as part of the Klei Package deal on Steam last week. I've been very intrigued by this for a while. Turn-based right? Haven't actually launched it yet. 


**Jamestown** - Finished it a few years ago. Just installed it to revisit. Realized that I've become really bad at shmups after having not played a lot of them for so long. 


**Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor** - Tried it but could get into it. I actually have nothing else to say about the game. That seems like a bad thing (for the game). It looks pretty.


**Prison Architect** - Was feeling like I wanted to play more sim/management games and remembered that I have this in my Steam library so I installed it over the weekend. Haven't launched it yet though.
 

**Red Faction (Armageddon &amp; Guerrilla)** - Decided to revisit them because of how impressed I got at Volition for their work on the Saints Row series. Still haven't gotten around to them yet though. 


**Rise of the Tomb Raider** - Dropped 50% off last week so I jumped on it. The graphics are really beautiful and the gameplay seems just like the first one. Judging by how impressed I was with the first game, I feel like I'm really going to enjoy this one too. 


**Saints Row 2** - Another game I installed because of how much I loved Saints Row IV / Volition. I got to the first few missions, but I was getting bothered by how the game's framerates seemed to occassionally drop despite not looking all that good. Also not as polished in terms of gameplay/movement/mechanics/interface as the two games that followed. Will come back to this, but just not in the near future. 


**Saints Row IV** - Incredible. Better than GTA V. Just so much fun and humor. 


**Civ 5** - You see all the ""haven't launched/played it yet"" statements above? Well this game is the reason for all of that. I'm totally hooked. I end up sleeping much later than I should and I try to sneak in turns in the morning in between waking up and leaving for work. So hooked that I'm looking for a mobile version I could play - or a similar game - but I'm not having much success with that. Just a really chill but challenging game that's highly addictive. I even installed the InfoAddict mod so that I could micromanage the different aspects of my empire. Great game. 


**South Park: The Stick of Truth** - Installed. Played a while - like a really short time. Not hooked, but I should give it much more time. I don't have my hopes up though since I'm not a fan of the series, but maybe it will surprise me. 
 

**Valiant Hearts** - I'm not much for puzzle games and much less for point-and-click adventures. This seems like a mixture of that so it honestly doesn't seem like my kind of game. But I bought it on sale because of strong recommendations so I'll give it a good try. 


**Zombie Army Trilogy** - I wanted a new FPS game to play around the time I installed this and this seemed like a solid one to try out... but I have discovered that it really isn't a traditional FPS. It's basically just a horde-mode game with no rhyme or reason. Or am I missing something? If not, I'm disappointed and will uninstall soon. ",patientgamers,Here's a list of the 19 games I have installed on my PC right now and brief thoughts on each one.

For November, here are the team's remaining games:


* Nov 08 vs DAL

* Nov 10 @ SAC

* Nov 12 @ NOP

* Nov 13 @ MIN

* Nov 15 vs BKL

* Nov 18 vs SAS

* Nov 20 vs CHI

* Nov 22 vs OKC

* Nov 23 @ GSW

* Nov 25 vs GSW

* Nov 27 vs ATL

* Nov 29 @ NOP

* Nov 30 @ CHI


So my thoughts / notes:

* three games against the Warriors in the span of 3 weeks? wtf.

* the next 5 games are relatively light, all of the games until the end of the month after that (except NOP) are brutal.

* 7 home games, 6 road games

* 3 back-to-backs: @NOP+@MIN ; vsOKC+@GSW ; @NOP+@CHI

* I predict WWWLWLWLLLLWL (6-7). Oddly enough, despite the brutal November back half, I still see us at .500 (10-10) by the end of the month.

https://youtu.be/6vuLQT6OsEE?t=213



&gt;**Q:** Is that what you always want from your players, to have them come up to you and say ""Hey I wanted that job""?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**A:** 100% absolutely I do. JC did it. Julius did it during a timeout - even though we were on the same page - I was drawing up a play that was getting to what he was asking for, just with some movement first. But just the fact that he spoke up and said what he wanted... I love it. I absolutely love it. That means to me that they're starting to take accountability and ownership for the team, as they should, because this is their team. The success we have is them winning, them playing together, them playing hard, them defending... so I want that type of interaction with them.

It isn't a mentally stimulating experience, neither is it spiritual, transcendental, or emotional --- but holy crap is it tons of dumb fun. I just started **Saints Row IV** today and I'm immediately hooked in the same way.


For those that aren't familiar, the Saints Row games are sort of like GTA - an open world experience with a main storyline and a lot of optional missions and extra stuff you can do on the side. Although where I feel like GTA really focuses a lot on the ""openness"" of its world and exploration, Saints Row has equal focus on the story and missions such that it feels less open / more linear than GTA. That and it has a more humor than GTA. If GTA was The Godfather, for example, then Saints Row would be something like Army of Darkness - a goofy over the top rollercoaster ride.


The combat/gunplay is really good. The missions are fun. And the abilities are an enjoyable power trip. In Saints Row IV, you can super jump over buildings and sprint faster than cars... I know right - wtf? So yeah, try Saints Row if you haven't yet.

According to the schedule, there are 3 points that will be covered:


1. Vote on whether or not to allow the company to buy back part of its own shares for 250 million PLN ($64 million)
2. Vote on whether to merge CD Projekt Brands (fully owned subsidiary that holds trademarks to the Witcher and Cyberpunk games) into the holding company
3. Vote on the change of the company's statute.


Now, the 1st and 3rd point seem to be the most interesting, particularly the last one. The proposed change will put restrictions on the voting ability of shareholders who exceed 20% of the ownership in the company. It will only be lifted if said shareholder makes a call to buy all of the remaining shares for a set price and exceeds 50% of the total vote.


According to the company's board, this is designed to protect the interest of all shareholders in case of a major investor who would try to aquire remaining shares without offering ""a decent price"".


Polish media (and some investors) speculate, whether or not it's a preemptive measure or if potential hostile takeover is on the horizon.


The decision to buy back some of its own shares would also make a lot of sense in that situation.

I'm also at a point in my life where I can't really bother to spend time learning games with complex systems. So most of Paradox's grand strategy games are out of the question. Civ V also seems intimidating because of this. The game being long is fine if it's good. The game taking long *to get into and understand* is what I'm avoiding. 


So I'm basically looking for games that aren't ""open"" and aren't complex. Examples of games I've enjoyed over the past few years are:


* Dark Souls series
* Spec Ops: The Line
* XCOM
* Shadowrun Returns
* both Metro games
* Bioshock series

So in line with that, I wanted to ask the gaming community here what different criteria factors into your appreciation of different video games. The purpose is so that I can form a more or less comprehensive criteria that can help me in arriving at a final rating. It's a self-serving purpose, but I can definitely see good discussion coming from it. 


I don't expect every game to be judged on the same criteria btw. Something like Telltale's TWD is judged greatly by its plot and character development but something like Binding of Isaac is also good but has none of that. So in the end, I was just hoping to have a list of most of the common criteria even though they might not be all applicable to all games. 



For starters I was thinking:


Visual fidelity - how polished the graphics are

Art design - the visual style of the game

Plot/Narrative - how engaging and well-written a game's story is

Characters - how interesting and developed the characters are in the game

Difficulty - not how easy or difficult a game is, but rather, how appropriate the difficulty is for the gaming experience 

Variety - could be variety in weaponry, enemies, environment.. basically something that ensures that the game doesn't feel stale and repetitive in the long run

1. The first thread was removed by the mods, but I had some exchanges with members of the mod team about reposting this and this should be okay now.

2. If you already submitted a list the first time, you don't have to submit a new one. To be sure, I included a list of users who have already sent me their votes/lists at the end of this post. If your name is there, you don't have to submit again.

3. If you don't want to forget to PM me and participate, [send a PM to the RemindMe Bot](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Vote%20for%20PCMR%20Top%2025) with the message *RemindMe! October 20th, 2016 ""Vote for PCMR Top 25""* or you can post that same message on this thread.

----------

**Why?**

Earlier this week, I posted IGN's updated list of their Top 25 Modern PC Games. In retrospect, maybe I shouldn't have because it was a bad list (imo of course) and a few other users echoed that sentiment. 


So now, after having asked permission from the mod team, I wanted to conduct a survey that would build PCMR's own ""Top 25 Modern PC Games"" using IGN's basic criteria (plus some additional rules).

----------

**Here's how this will go (mechanics &amp; criteria):**

1. If you want to participate, [send me a PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=SkoivanSchiem&amp;subject=For%20PCMR%20Top%2025) with the subject line ""For PCMR Top 25""

2. Your PM should contain your personal Top 10 Modern PC Games, ranked from 1 (best) to 10 (worst). It is highly recommended that you copy and paste the following template into the message box of your PM. This makes it easier for me to parse the votes and tally the results *(please copy and paste as is, don't edit the spacings)*:


        01) 

        02) 

        03) 

        04) 

        05) 

        06) 

        07) 

        08)
 
        09) 

        10) 


3. Votes/Lists with less than 10 items will not be counted.

4. The only games eligible are games that have been released for the PC from 2006 to 2016.
 - older games that were remastered/reissued and released from 2006 to 2016 are NOT eligible (i.e. - Age of Empires II: HD Edition)
 - iterations of the same game such as DLCs, GotY editions and the like will be tallied under the name of the base game. So for example, Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, Witcher 3: Blood &amp; Wine, and Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth will count under Dark Souls, Witcher 3, and Binding of Isaac respectively. So for conveniences sake, please always use the base game in your individual lists. *(I realize that this may potentially be an unpopular rule because of many nuances in the nature of video games these days, but it will eliminate a lot of confusion in the process)*
 - games that have been released on other platforms are allowed as long as the game was released for Windows (or Linux), within the specified time frame, then it is eligible. In other words, it doesn't have to be a PC exclusive.

5. I will tally the individual lists this coming Saturday and post the results on /r/pcmasterrace afterwards. Your lists will be weighted as follows:
 - 01) = 10 pts
 - 02) = 9 pts
 - 03) = 8 pts
 - so on and so forth...

6. In the interest of transparency, all individual lists will be released (idk, maybe via pastebin) along with the final results

7. Do NOT post your list on this thread and please do not ""campaign"" for other users to vote for particular games as well.

8. I'm open to comments and suggestions, but I can't promise to change anything. Once this thread is posted, people may start submitting lists already, and if things are changed midway, that may cause some problems.

Thanks! I really hope I don't screw this up.

**Bioshock (8/10)** - Story, characters, atmosphere and art design are all incredible. Gameplay, not so much. Combat is clunky, hacking is tedious, and there are many little quality-of-life improvements that could have been done. Rapture will go down in history as among the classic settings in video games, and the twists will go down that same way as well. I strongly disagree with the popular consensus that the ending was weak.



**Bioshock 2 (9/10)** - Story and characters are much more basic. Seems like the devs were going for a more emotional and human narrative as compared to the grander themes of the first game. Not that engaging from that perspective, but the gameplay is much improved. The weapons handle better, and the many little QOL improvements that I mentioned could have been done for the first game was done here (i.e. - all passive abilities in one category, weapons and plasmids equipped at the same time). The spear gun is amazing.



**Minerva's Den (10/10)** - I cried goddamnit. While the core gameplay is unchanged even with the addition of a new plasmid and a new weapon, Minerva's Den delivers the emotional punch that they seemed to have wanted to do with the main game but were unable to. I saw the twist coming regarding the true identity of the main character, but I was prepared for the other twist and the slow final walk towards the bathysphere. What a well designed and elegant ending. An excellent DLC.



**Bioshock Infinite (7/10)** - This one just didn't grab me. Even if the production values were solid, some of the gameplay elements felt a bit boring, and for the first time playing the series, I struggled to progress through parts simply due to lack of interest. Eventually, I figured that the main culprit is that Columbia just didn't intrigue me in the same way Rapture did. Even though the setting was beautifully wide open, the nature of the game being an on-the-rails shooter did not grant the freedom to explore the city's openness, which maybe created a sort of cognitive dissonance. Then when it started to get good and eventually blew my mind... it was over. I will say though that the The Luteces are brilliantly written characters and possibly my favorites of the entire series.



**Burial at Sea I (8/10)** - We're back in Rapture, yay! A bit short, but still delivers a solid story that benefits greatly from the mindfuckery of Infinite's ending. It builds upon the whole space, time, quantum physics stuff, punches you with a twist, and then says goodbye.



**Burial at Sea II (10/10)** - Just when I thought the crying was over, the series gets me one last time. I love that you get to play as Elizabeth and that the gameplay takes on a much more stealthy approach. Narratively, its purpose is twofold: Bring the timey wimey narrative of Infinite to its conclusion and tie up the story of Infinite with the original game. It does both of those excellently, and seamlessly, and I loved every moment of it.



**Rapture (9/10)** - This is the novel by John Shirley. If you are a fan of the series and haven't read this yet. Read it. The novel builds an engrossing prequel story around everything that we know about Bioshock through the video games - the dialog and the audio logs - and is a great companion to the games. There is a lot about Sullivan, McDonaugh, Tennenbaum, Suchong, Lamb, of course Fontaine and Ryan, a lot more. I can't stress enough that if you're a fan, this is practically required reading.",Bioshock,(Spoilers) Done!

But anyway... So yeah, since I started playing the collection last September 16, I have just been tearing through the Bioshock universe. Here are how I rate each of the games, and the DLCs, and also the novel by John Shirley, along with a few thoughts on each:

----------

**BioShock (2007) - [Rating: 8/10]**

The primary reason why we are still talking about Bioshock in 2016 is because of the incredible groundwork that this game had established for the series. The story and characters are fantastic. The art design and atmosphere complement the intense, manic, and disturbing narrative perfectly. The setting - this incredible city under the sea - will go down in history as one of the classic settings in all of video gaming.  The twists will also be remembered as among the most memorable gaming moments of all time. Though I disagree that the game's ending is a letdown

Where the game falls short though is in the actual gameplay. I felt the combat and gunplay was clunky. The hacking quickly became tedious

Sometimes, I use DSR to render games in a higher resolution even though they're still displayed in 1080p.


So I tried this with Bioshock Infinite and rendered it via DSR in 1440p. The problem is that the game seems to think that it's still rendered in 1080p and the mouse is unable to move all the way to the right and all the way down. It's like there are invisible borders preventing it from moving past a 1080p resolution even though the game is being rendered in 1440p.

For a narrative which focused on possibly the most advanced and complex piece of science and technology in Rapture (The Thinker) at its core, it's amazing how the main plotline develops and changes into what I consider to be the most human and heartfelt story I've seen from the series thus far (a close second would be Mark Meltzer and Cindy).

I'm pretty sure I'm near the end of Bioshock 2 already and will likely finish it today. I'm not sure what the general consensus is from gamers, but I definitely got into 2 more than 1. Story-wise, it doesn't have the same kind of kick that the first game's narrative had, but in terms of gameplay, I feel that the game improved a lot by making small changes to the different systems in the game. 

One thing I wasn't big about was Bioshock's combat, and that's definitely better here. The weapons feel more tactile / have better audio-visual feedback, and they ""handle"" better, you don't have to toggle between weapon and plasmid... and you can zoom (the spear gun rules!). I like how the passive abilities are all grouped together instead of having subcategories, which makes for more flexible builds. I also like the small changes and additions they made to the abilities here more in general (I'm a big fan of Scout). The new hacking system is better even if it still gets old after a while. I have mixed feelings about the new way of getting Adam, but it's certainly a more challenging, refreshing change.

The final boss fight wasn't really difficult but it was pretty refreshing and fun. The denouement felt a bit rushed after that though. 

I'm also close to midway with the Rapture novel and it's been an excellent companion to the game thus far. I'm just missing a few interesting characters from the novel who weren't in the game, especially this Sophia Lamb character (who feels like a female Fontaine at this point in the book), who seems like she's going to be a major player.

Doesn't seem particularly tight and polished. I'm not sure what it is, and the only other FPS I've been playing as of late (for comparison) has been the Metro series, which I really get into the shooting of. 

Also, does anyone have any tips of how to choose what weapon to use most of the time? I just end up arbitrarily picking one and then move arbitrarily to another one when ammo runs out (unless, say, I'm fighting a big daddy where I'll be sure to use up all my electric bucks before anything else). I've never taken a liking to the chemical thrower though so I almost never use that one.

Having said that, I'm enjoying the game a lot if only for the atmosphere, art design, and storyline cleverly dispersed in the form of the audio diaries. A solid 8/10 for me so far (I've just assembled the bomb at Hephaestus).

-----

edit: I dont have any huge problems with the strategic side of the combat. I guess my problem is more of the actual action falling flat. The gunplay feels mechanically uninteresting. I know we don't actually feel anything physically when we play these games, but certain games are able to use the graphics, animation, and audio in such a way that the shooting aspect is immersive (like the aforementioned Metro, and Spec Ops also comes to mind). 

I just feel that Bioshock's combat in that sense is lacking.

- 66°C = 20% fan speed
- 70°C = 30% fan speed

So I went home and followed her instructions. Here we are now, almost 3 days after (66 hours to be exact) and my eyes now look like this:

The eyes are not painful, but feel sore indeed. Not always itchy, just occasionally. Does not feel always grainy, just occasionally. But the redness and tearing up is not improving.

In the Tobrex literature, it says that if the sore eyes are beyond mild or moderate, one can administer 2 drops every hour until it gets better, and then go back to 1-2 drops every 4 hours until the condition is completely cleared... is there any danger in administering 2 drops every hour at this point?

I'm not talking about sports journalism in general, but rather that branch of sports reporting that announces breaking news. The branch of journalism dedicated to fight analysis,  insights, commentary, interviews, and breakdowns will always have a place in sports. However, I feel like the whole ""getting the scoop"" first and breaking the news is from an bygone age of journalism. 

I feel like these are just remnants from a time when there was no Facebook, Twitter, or even the Internet; when sports organizations relied on news reporters to break the news and these reporters were indeed in a rush to get thay scoop first and report it first to increase the prestige and relevancy of the news outfit that they worked for... From a time when the sports business and mass media worked, moved, and operated very differently compared to how it does today. 

These days however, almost all sports organizations have the capability and resources to break their news when they want to and how they want to... So what place exactly does Ariel Helwani and Adrian Wojnarowski have in MMA and the NBA respectively, really? I know lots of people follow them and are pumped when they break the news that they do, but consider for a moment that this is news that we're going to get eventually anyway. So what (to us, as consumers of this news) if they break the news slightly sooner than the organization does?

For the record, I'm a Helwani fan and listen to The MMA Hour as often as I can. I love all of the work he does for the sport, but if he continues on his career without breaking any news and just sticked with the interviews and articles that he does, it wouldn't change how I view him the slightest bit -  and that's as the single most influential MMA journalist in the world.",MMA,"[Serious Discussion] What is breaking sports news any good for anymore, really?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/4mycpc/serious_discussion_what_is_breaking_sports_news/

I've been using MyFitnessPal to track my daily net calories and I do it mostly by estimating the calories of the food I eat. When I exercise, I also enter it and the app subtracts that from my calories for the day (note: I realized quickly that MFP seems to overestimate exercise calories burned so I just use other tools online for the estimating and adjust it manually in MFP).


My question is why do a lot of people advise against counting calories out? The way I see it, if I have a daily caloric goal and I do exercise, estimating calories out is a good way to know how much more I should eat for that day to still get the more or less the calories that my needs to function well. 


Some people say just count calories in and treat the exercise as a bonus loss. But if that's the case, I figured I might be in danger of eating too little to compensate for that day's activities.

I understand where these definitions are coming from, but I think p2w is more than that: My understanding of p2w is simply paying money for a gameplay advantage, just like what [THIS](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win) link says and what is top voted on [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3q8lh2/is_the_definition_of_pay_2_win_mechanics_expanding/) reddit thread.

I can get behind the sentiment that p2w is not an absolute definition and different games can be different degrees of p2w. That being said, do I think Hearthstone is p2w? Yes. Do I think DotA is p2w? No.

I pulled over a nearby gas station and the mechanic there said that for batteries under a year (like mine) they usually try ""resetting"" the battery by disconnecting it and connecting it after 15 minutes, so that's what they did and the light was ok for a while.


But after another 10 minutes the light started flickering again. Shortly after, more lights across the dashboard (wheel, ABS) started to light up. When the radio suddenly turned off as I was passing through the tollway, that's when I was sure something was up.


As I was trying to pull over after passing the toll gate, my steering wheel started to stiffen (power steering went out I guess) and after pulling over even the power windows wouldn't engage anymore. So obliviously it's a battery problem - specifically an alternator problem since it died out while I was driving.


After having the car towed to the dealership (it's a 3-yo Kia Rio still under a 5-year warranty), the mechanic confirmed that it's an alternator problem. His diagnosis is that the following items need to be replaced: IC Regulator, Carbon Brush, bearing... but not the whole alternator.


Does that make sense not to replace the whole alternator? Is that the most ideal solution if the parts he mentioned are the only ones that have a problem? Because it almost feels like they're just trying to extend the life of the faulty alternator hopefully beyond warranty and are just proposing the solution that would cost them the least amount.",cars,"Replacing only the parts of an alternator (IC Regulartor, Carbon Brush) instead of the whole alternator - does this make sense?",https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/3z4050/replacing_only_the_parts_of_an_alternator_ic/

And so far it appears that Russell's first 4 games are really bad seeing as he's 3rd to the last on that list (lol @ Mudiay being last). If you look at other comparable PGs (Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving) - they had pretty great rookie seasons and even their first 4 games each were pretty solid... so it's not exactly unreasonable to expect D'Angelo to make an impact right away especially considering he's the #2 pick. So personally, even though I'm very excited and open to seeing him improve, I would have hoped that he would have made more of an impact by now.

&amp;nbsp;

Though if you look at the likes of Deron Williams and Tony Parker, they didn't have stellar rookie seasons either but eventually shot up to elite-guard level in a matter of a few years. Deron in particular went from averaging 10/2/4 in his rookie season to 18/3/10 in just 2 years.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, maybe I could come back to that query from time to time and see if he ranks higher eventually.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm posting this now because that thread seemed to have quite a number of upvotes and the majority of replies there seemed to be people who had the same problem and weren't sure how to fix it.

&amp;nbsp;

The reply of /u/asjmcguire actually fixed my problem, so I wanted to share for those interested:
&gt;Usually - if rebooting the router fixes it - it's a problem with the router, it's nothing to do with signal strength it's down to the way the Chromecast works. There is something called Multicast and what this means is that the Chromecast sends a message to the router (for example ""Hello, I'm here"") and the router then resends that message to all devices on the network that have told the router that they are interested in these messages. Now before the Chromecast came along, this functionality was only very lightly used, but the Chromecast relies heavily on this functionality and a lot of routers appear to dislike the traffic generated and then just stop sending the messages to the rest of the network - so the Chromecast continues sending messages to the router - but all the other devices are essentially deaf because the router never passes the messages on. If rebooting the router (without rebooting anything else) instantly fixes the problem - it's time to look for a new router.

&amp;nbsp;

So in my case, what I did to fix my problem was basically just enable Multicast on my router. It was disabled by default and after enabling it, I haven't encountered any problem seeing the Chromecast from any of my devices and it's already been more than a couple of days now.

&amp;nbsp;

So try it: 

* Enable your multicast if it's disabled. 
* If it's enabled and you still have problems, fiddle around with other multicast-related settings if your router has them. 
* Also google ""Chromecast multicast"" to check out what other things have been written about this around the web if things still aren't working.

&amp;nbsp;

I posted this around a month ago: [How much SOT should I get while playing a 1080p video in mxplayer on 100% screen brightness while on airplane mode?](https://www.reddit.com/r/LGG3/comments/3dpysh/how_much_sot_should_i_get_while_playing_a_1080p/) --- and the figure I got was 2 hours and 20 minutes.

&amp;nbsp;

Since then I've done the ff:

* installed Texdroider and lowered the DPI to 534

&amp;nbsp;

...yeah I think that's pretty much the significant stuff I did coming from stock.

&amp;nbsp;

Tonight I did the same test that I did *exactly the same way* as I did a month ago, and my SOT improved to 2 hours and 52 minutes. 

&amp;nbsp;

Take note though, that aside from the improvement in SOT, there has also been a marked improvement in battery performance when the phone is locked/idle. When I was on stock, I'd wake up in the morning to see my battery drop 3 or 4%... now there are times I'd wake up and the battery level would still be the same. I'd lose only 1% max.

&amp;nbsp;

So there, I just thought I'd share. FYI ;)

&amp;nbsp;

*Note 1: the 32 minutes is specifically for the scenario I tested. The percentage gain is 22.87%... so I assume that if you're a stock user who usually gets, say, 3 hours of SOT typically... if the test's results are accurate, then you should be gaining around 41 minutes instead of 32 minutes (since 22.87% of 3 hours is roughly 41 minutes).*

&amp;nbsp;

*Note 2: Actually it's entirely likely that the tweaks have no direct impact on SOT, and it's the background stuff that got the benefits of the tweaks, but since people always measure their battery life in terms of SOT, I figured I might as well frame the experiment in that way.*",LGG3,So this is how much SOT I've gained after all of the tweaks I've done since coming from a completely stock configuration...,http://www.reddit.com/r/LGG3/comments/3h76gx/so_this_is_how_much_sot_ive_gained_after_all_of/

But 2 weeks after her Montelukast ended, she had a bout of asthma so bad that it landed us in the pediatric ICU (though take note that her xrays also showed she had mild pneumonia, which I assume exacerbated the asthma). 

When we talked with the pulmonologist, she said that our daughter might need to be put on stronger maintenance (a puff inhaler or something) since she's now a high risk case. Personally, I just thought that she would be put back on Montelukast, so idk about this.

As me and a friend were talking last night, he related to me that he had brother with asthma, but was not put on strong maintenance by his doctors when he was a kid, the reason being that they believed one built a dependency on these maintenance meds and they would just get stronger and stronger as one grew older as the body becomes more dependent on them...

If that's the case... how do I fix this so that I could reinstall Hearthstone on my phone?

I'm also interested in the ff btw:

* is there a better/more powerful/flexible camera app that I can use in place of the stock camera?
* what other possible tweaks could there be in the hidden menu? (because I've noticed that disabling Fast Dormancy did improve my battery life after I saw via Amplify that it was triggering a lot)

I think the phone is great for what I paid for it (~$20 on top of my mobile plan), but I keep thinking that I would trade the QHD resolution for longer battery life / better performance in a heartbeat.


When I look at the battery usage stats, the single biggest culprit of battery usage is the screen. It takes up around 40-50% of the total battery usage on the G3 (I'm working from memory here, I might be remembering slightly wrong). If the resolution of the device were 1080p instead of QHD, are there any tests that would indicate how much battery life could be gained?


Another thing is that, if you play games on your phone, some games will use the phone's native resolution as the game resolution. That means I'm playing Hearthstone at 2560x1440 - and that does not make for a smooth gaming experience. If you scale that down to 1920x1080, there should be an advantage in terms of performance / resource usage, yeah?


Is there really any advantage from having QHD on a mobile device? I don't think there would really be any striking visual difference tbh. It almost strikes me in the same way as the megapixel wars for digital photography, where, unless you're shooting for large-size printing, the difference b/w 12 megapixels and 6 megapixels will not make a difference.

But the general plot and suspense was handled very well. I could see it being a successful film in the right hands. I felt the ending/climax/reveal was also written better than in GG in terms of its pace and action in spite of this issue I have with it... 

**** Spoilers ahead ****

My only issue about the ending was that the reveal about who the killer was felt like it came out of nowhere. Actually, who the killer ended up being was fine... My issue is more about the reason stemming from that they had an affair. I felt as though there was no precedent for that aside from the few pages where Megan slept with an unamed guy (which in itself felt out of place with the rest of the story).

I just feel like in stories like this, once the reveal has been made, it should feel like the last piece of a puzzle and you as the reader would able to piece together things from earlier in the story in hindsight that would make the reveal make sense. The reveal of Tom having an affair with Megan felt like a deus ex machina in a way - seemed like new information to propel the climax - just for that surprise factor.
