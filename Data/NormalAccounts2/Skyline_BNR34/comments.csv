Basically, if you're already convinced you're going to play for the rest of your life, splurge on some high end skates if you can afford it.

Idling is different since there isn't anything connected to engine while it's idling. When it's engaged in a gear it's making the engine do more work than it is capable of in that low or a gear ratio.

It's like in a manual car, you're in a high gear going slowly, the engine can barely move the car and it sputters to a stop. You don't have the engine torque required to move the car in that gear, making the engine have to do more work for the same thing.

That's why the gear ratios are always something along the lines of 3:1 in first, 2.3:1 in second, 1.6:1 in third, 1.3 in 4th, 1:1 in fifth, and 6th is normally an overdrive gear so it's 0.8:1 or so.",2016-09-09 21:16:46+00:00,d7g6l0v,10.0,t1_d7fit3m,32906.0,technology

Read the explanations in this thread, it should help you understand how they work better and I tried to help you understand too.

Basically, the player has to be linked to the original traded player via trades. Once players leave the team via retirement or UFA their branch of the tree dies.

Lets take a look at the beginning to help you out. Rick Martin got traded for  a 1st in '83 and a 3rd in '81. Those picks became Colin Chisholm and Tom Barrasso. Chisholm's branch dies when he left the Sabres due to becoming a UFA.

Barrasso played for Buffalo and he gets traded to Pittsburgh for Doug Bodger and Darrin Shannon.  So those two guys are added to the tree because they were traded to Buffalo from a pick/player originally used in the Martin trade.

Bodger gets traded to San Jose for Vaclav Varada, a 1st in 96, and a 4th in 96 and the rights to Matin Spanhel. Now those pieces from Bodger are included in the tree. 

Once a player gets traded away from the team you ignore what they do but you look at what the team recieves an you continue the tree that way. But the players or picks received you follow them until they leave the team via UFA or retirement. That is when you X out that player.

And no, the main branch of the tree did not die with Pardy leaving the team. That only looks to be a main branch because of the design of the tree.",2016-07-14 02:46:13+00:00,d5bgxfp,2.0,t1_d5b704n,16055.0,sabres

But about 25 percent of the states leave room for interpretation with “prima facie” laws — or a “mixed” combination of absolute and prima facie rules — allowing speeders to argue in court that their speed was in fact reasonable.

1517,"I'm a self taught skater. I do not believe you would need the lessons if you already have a basic knowledge of how to skate, but they will help. I taught myself how to skate from watching the good skaters at public skates and trying to mimic their moves. I would skate about 3-5 times a week during my learning phase for about 5 months. I also watched multiple videos on youtube on skating and  hockey from mister /u/howtohockeydotcom. Also plenty of trial and error to learn how to do things right and on my weak side. If it's possible for you, try to go to public skates in the middle of the week during lunch hours or daytime hours as it will not be crowded and you can actually go wherever you want on the ice. That helped me immensely learning because I only had to worry about 5-8 other people out there.

Although, when I decided to learn to really skate, I already had knowledge and experience skating before when I was younger. I could do crossovers moving forward and hockey stop on my strong side. So I was a bit further along in the learning and applying part of skating.

But in your instance, if I had to do it again and had no previous knowledge of skating or experience would get the lessons, you'll learn a whole bunch of things to do when you go to public skates.

But the most important thing is to skate as much as possible, even still after 6 years of skating I'm learning new things myself just from all the skating I do now. ",2016-03-20 03:07:30+00:00,d16czb9,1.0,t3_4b18mr,91832.0,hockeyplayers

1724,"&gt;Group 4 (Restricted) Free Agents - Defected Players
This is a special category for players who jump ship on their current deal hoping to magically turn into an unrestricted free agent by bolting for an unaffiliated league before their contract is up (or before they sign their EL deal). While there are lots of other considerations here which relate to punishing a player for doing this, a Group 4 free agent gives the team that owns his rights the right to match any deal he accepts. The main difference is there's no draft pick compensation given for Group 4 players if a team decides not to match an offer.

He can if he wants to, but it would be identical to the Radulov situation. If he defects, his contract gets put on hold in the NHL and if he comes back would be Tampa Property for two more years, possibly one since his contract started ticking last year.

1882,"&gt;50.1 **Kneeing** - Kneeing is the act of a player leading with his knee and in some cases extending his leg outwards to make contact with his opponent.

Rule for kneeing, if Stralman doesn't move his leg, which he didn't, and if Ehlers tries to dodge the hit, a Kneeing cannot be called.

Unfortunately, the NHL rulebook is not like the IIHF rulebook where a hit to the head is an automatic penalty/ejction.

&gt;48.1 **Illegal Check to the Head** – A hit resulting in contact with an opponent’s head where the head was the main point of contact and such contact to the head was avoidable is not permitted.

&gt;In determining whether contact with an opponent's head was avoidable, the circumstances of the hit including the following shall be considered:

&gt;&gt;**(i)** Whether the player attempted to hit squarely through the opponent’s body and the head was not ""picked"" as a result of poor timing, poor angle of approach, or unnecessary extension of the body upward or outward.

&gt;&gt;**(ii)** Whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position by assuming a posture that made head contact on an otherwise full body check unavoidable. 

&gt;&gt;**(iii)** Whether the opponent materially changed the position of his body or head immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit in a way that significantly contributed to the head contact.

The second point puts it into an accidental hit to the head where the player put themselves into a defenseless position with Stralman already committed to the hit.

So once again, which penalty is going to be called, these are the rules you want called, but nothing is being broken here.",2016-02-19 06:00:25+00:00,d05ks96,8.0,t1_d05kkxi,484.0,hockey

&gt;While there are companies that offer such things as a free license plate or tag number search, you should always be careful when dealing with this type of company and always read the fine print. If you see an online license plates search, It is most likely a scam.

Position doesn't matter here, you're all going to rotate when the puck cycles around anyways. If you get the puck on the goal line and start moving towards the net, the other two forwards should rotate to their respective positions depending on what side of the ice you're on.

Defense, the wingers should cover the points and the center should cover the free man that the D do not cover. Typically it is from the dots to the tops of the circles, could even get close to the redline if possible.

Manually edit the lines for injuries if you can. Adjust lines and keep up with stats too, if a player is playing poorly, switch the lines up, same with players playing great.

I will also trade away players that become disgruntled to improve morale overall.

Neither player will play the last three years of those contracts most likely.

7 million was a lot of money when those contracts were signed, now, 7.5 million isn't as much as it used to be.

You also need to remember a contract like Parise and Suter's is not allowed under the current CBA anymore. The last three years of their contracts are 2 million, 1 million, and 1 million, which artificially lowers the cap hit. You would need to take away those three years and their contracts are now $9.4 million dollar cap hit over 10 years. Or if you want to put it into context of what they are allowed to sign under the current, they would have been 7 year contracts at 71 million dollars if the figures were equal, which would then be a $10.14 million dollar cap hit.

Considering the floor is around the same amount as the entire cap for the 09-10 season is why this contract is not an overpayment.

Is there enough bite for you? Do you want more glide?

Typically someone as light as you would be using a more aggressive hollow compared to bigger players as you don't have the weight to really bite down with really shallow hollows.

If you're not getting enough bite, go with a 3/8's cut. IF you feel you want more speed, move up to a 1/2 cut and try it out for more glide, but slightly less bite. Typically, players move up to a shallower hollow as they get better with edge control as they won't need huge biting hollows anymore.

Or try out a Flat-Bottom V cut if they offer it in your LHS, it gives you great bite without sacrificing speed and you can fine tune it to your liking also.
