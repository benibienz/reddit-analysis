I'm currently in my second season of Be A Pro and am 38 games into the season so far. What is hilarious is just how pathetic my team is on the road versus in our home arena.

My other players are not bad players where I'm carrying the team every game either. I lead the team with 28 goals and 50 points though and most of those points probably have come on the road and not as much in home games. I do wish we could see split stats for home and away and certain teams and such as you can do with NHL.com's website. 4 other players have 10+ goals and 5 other players have 20+ points and one of those guys has 30+ points, but they all struggle to score in away games, I'd be willing to bet my BAP has more points in away games than the entire team put together.

So onto what our respective records are at home and away. Home record is pretty damn good at 14-2-5. But our away record is a resounding 4-11-2, it's the absolute worst in the NHL this season.

My team has scored 30 goals total in away games and have had 43 goals against. My team has been shutout 3 times away from home so far this season also. I do have a 1-0 shutout win away from home though.

Home games are much more fun because the team has scored 80 goals during them. 55 goals have been scored scored against me at home too. So they do tend to be higher scoring games in general at my home arena.

I just wanted to share to see if anyone else has had similar things happen to them.",EA_NHL,"In Be A Pro, my team struggles mightily to win away games, but dominates homes games.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/4cjz3l/in_be_a_pro_my_team_struggles_mightily_to_win/

My current team has stats of 94 Offense, 93 Defense, and 89 Goalie. But I want this team to make it over the hump. Made the playoffs the past two years and have cycled in some different players through drafting and free agency to try and keep the best team I can.

What I'm asking is, are player roles really important? This will be the first year where I'm making sure my first line is all 1st line Players with their roles Second line players are 2nd, third are all scoring 3rd liners and my fourth line is 2 4th and one 3rd checking. Or is the combination of player types like having a Playmaker/Sniper/2 way or something along those lines more important than keeping players in their respective roles on the team?

Basically if your BAP player takes a penalty in OT he will never get back on the ice. The rulebook states no team can have less than 3 players on the ice at a time so the OT penalty becomes a 4-on-3. When the penalty is up though is when we have the issue. Play would go to 4-on-4 until the next whistle or stoppage of play and then go back down to 3-on-3 but this never happens, time just runs out instead.

So, try not to take any penalties in OT with your BAP play as he won't get out of the box.

I'm here to clear up all this nonsense for you guys as I've had to explain it at least 5 times today in different posts.

The NHL and AHL have an age requirement that you have to turn 18 by September 15th in order to play in their respective leagues.

You may now be asking why certain players have to be 20 before they are allowed to play in the AHL? That is the CHL-NHL agreement which states:
&gt;Players drafted and playing for CHL teams are ineligible to play in the professional minor leagues (AHL, ECHL) until they are 20 years old (by December 31st of that year) or have completed four years in major juniors.

Since Jack Eichel was playing for an NCAA team at the time of his draft he does not have to abide by the CHL-NHL agreement and could play in the AHL if the Sabres assigned him there. The Sabres could also loan Eichel to the CHL team that holds his rights also if they so wanted too, this is highly unlikely though since he can play in the AHL.

You guys also need to remember Zemgus Girgensons played in the AHL the year after he was drafted at 18, because he was not playing for a CHL team when he was drafted he was allowed to play in the AHL. Rasmus Ristolainen is another example of a player playing in the AHL at age 18. As he was drafted from the Finnish league he was eligible to play in the AHL when he got a contract with Buffalo.

And one other thing about 1 way and 2 way contracts.

1 way contracts only mean the Salary for players is the same if they play in the NHL or AHL. A 1 way contract has no bearing on waivers or where a player is allowed to play at, anyone with a 1 way contract can play in the AHL. Mike Richards is a prime example of that. He was sent down last year to the AHL from the Kings and since he had a 1 way contract was being paid 5 million dollars to play there.

2 way contracts have differing NHL and AHL salaries. This type of contract are the only ones allowed for Entry Level Contracts, and these also have no determination on if a player is waiver eligible also.
