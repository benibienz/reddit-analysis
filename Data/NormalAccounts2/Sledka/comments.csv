28,"yeah i agree, my idea is based upon the presumption that there is (or has been) as intelligent / more intelligent life forms out there. 

And for those life forms to become more intelligent past their natural biological boundaries, technology is needed. such as literally instruments which detect elements etc

but like you said, until we can detect other life forms we could never tell, just a theory really",2015-07-13 19:29:13+00:00,ct21j6k,6.0,t1_ct1zx80,2358.0,technology

32,"nah im saying that other intelligent species most somewhat rely on a form of technology to gain knowledge. Even though it could be possible, no biological species would simply have everything built into it to know enough to be deemed intelligent. if ya get me

And the point is that by the time a biological species can move freely about its solar system, tech will be so advanced that AI's would already be at the stage of dominance over the biological species.
