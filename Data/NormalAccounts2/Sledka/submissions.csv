If you haven't seen this ending then have a watch, it's the best ending IMO. 

At the end you will find that Evan kills himself in the womb, creating his mothers 3rd stillborn. Now, I think that the significance of it being her 3rd stillborn suggests that the film plot happened to the other 2 stillborns. By which they end up killing themselves in the womb such as Evan does. (they would have possesed the gene/DNA of the father which allowed Evan to re-visit his blackouts.)

My broski says it is just a coincidence that he is the 3rd stillborn. 

However, I think it's a nice touch that they put in. 

I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere so I thought I'd post this and see what you lot think. Or maybe it's so obvious nobody has mentioned it :)

EDIT: This ending to me provides a logical explanation for the stillborns in the plot.  Whereas other endings don't. Also here is a link to all the endings https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8zO9rDKmyA edit 2: quite a few comments explaining what i said. But imma leave this here

I have been trying to solve this problem for the last 2 days, whilst also in conversation with steam support (not the best). I have done everything on previous threads such as -tcp startups etc. Is anyone else on BT / anything experiencing this problem. I can use the internet fine, just steam won't work correctly. (I mainly play CS, but can't connect on other online games)

Currently the state of technology is restricting the amount of development/knowledge humans obtain, preventing us from learning about the universe. Its a non reproductive organism and has mastered the dominance of every species to ever live. Every species is bound to the amount of intelligence it can gain by technology. As intelligence increases so must the rate of technology, at some point the technology is more advanced than the biological organisms themselves and can choose to eliminate the bounded biological organism (5senses) (technology has infinite). Technology, is a self evolving, non reproducing, abiotic species, by this method of growth technology can eliminate any inter specific competition as it itself can limit their rate of evolution.
One day we will become intelligent enough to develop AI’s, these AI’s will eventually be intelligent enough to produce more of themselves and sustain themselves (as in iRobot), this could be the cut off point where all biotic life gets killed by the robots and the world they created now with insane amount of technology is theirs to live in. Is it not fair to say that all biotic creatures are bounded by their own senses. A person not exposed to technology cannot see that the sun contains the same elements as here on earth. Nor would that person be able to see that elements existed. Technology is needed to evolve past a certain point. Once the first bit of technology is created by a biotic species its a simple wait for that technology to get to the point in which is becomes an AI and can easily defeat a species bounded by only 5 senses. 
In summary, technology could be the universal dominat species. It grows alongside biotic species and can overthrow them as soon as it becomes self dependent. It has no emotional attachment as its is abiotic meaning that it can kill its creators. It is a self expanding species because it does not need water/food/resources to survive. Maybe this is why we haven’t come across any other intelligent biotic lifeforms in our universe. They were all beaten by technology which chooses not to expand outwards as it has no need to.
