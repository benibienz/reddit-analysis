It wouldn't hurt to be approved through your bank ahead of time and keep it a secret to see what the dealerships come back with first. You can always tell them after that you have already arranged financing then since they can't beat your banks rate. And I'm sure they will start back peddling lol

467,"Always get a carfax and research the dealers you are shopping at. Especially being in a new area I would look at buying a used car from a New Car Dealership versus buying from some used car only lot. Typically a new car dealer is going to be more reputable and have better quality used cars. Also used cars is typically one of the most profitable areas for a car dealer so make sure you have done your research and know what to expect to pay for the particular used car you are interested in. With a little research you can see what one, similarly equipped to one you are interested in, is selling for in your area through other dealers and private party so you will be able to recognize a good deal. Also if you are financing, get Gap insurance unless you are putting 1/3 down. Also don't be afraid to walk away from the negotiations and let them chase you down/call you back in. 
If they let you.leave they were at their best deal. Feel free to ask me any questions you want

Also if you're not top tier credit the banks are going to loan more than a vehicles value meaning we can't jack the price up and hope to get you financed.
