I am primarily referring to the more raid tier fights, as a single power slash (max 2) in dungeons is enough hate for the whole fight, but 24 man fights can be a bit lengthy as well (not 8 minutes but you get the point) so even in some casual cases it can help.

20,"Keeping up grit blocks out blood weapon, one of the best mp restore skills. Sure, grit reduces damage taken and increases enmity, but at a MASSIVE cost of damage when you factor increased attack speed in blood weapon and mp restore. If your a tank that keeps on your tank stance for the whole fight, more power to you brother/sister. Dark knight is the only tank whose dps rotation does not include a single enmity increased attack, so stance dancing has a higher element of awareness, as you are essentially holding hate with an enmity dump and dps. Darkside does not negate the damage loss,  you go from .8 to .92 damage reduction with grit and darkside on. Or, with grit off and darkside on 1.15.

25,"Butcher's block:280 potency
Skull sunder: 200 potency
Maim: 180 potency
Storms eye: 270 potency

I agree 100% path uptime is not optimal, but your dps increase is way less than the dps loss you force your mt to suffer. Let's put it all together:

Maim makes butcher's block 336 potency, and skull sunder 240. Add in storms eye debuff, and  (rounded) butcher's block is 373, skull sunder is 264.

Same equations for eye spam, maim makes maim 216, or 240 with eye. Eye becomes 324, or 360 with eye debuff. 

Your alternating block, eye, for dps, so you gain 37 potency. In total, but generate a MASSIVE amount of enmity, due to increased enmity.

If I'm forced to stay in stance to fight your enmity onslaught, siphon strike loses 58 potency, from grit staying on. So my 1 GCD lost more damage than your butcher's block combo in it's entirety gained. (If eye is factored in, I lost 35 potency but you get my point) path is different as it us a loss, but don't force your mt to fight you for hate, or your gimping your team.",2016-10-03 23:06:55+00:00,d8csmai,3.0,t1_d8cmv87,7943.0,ffxiv

Divine veil is amazing, use it while your being healed, so no extra work is needed (while taking damage) it is garbage it doesnt affect you though. It's 30 second duration is the same as adlo. And it's free, divine veil, deployment adlo, equals no damage in some fights, meaning no healing. This let's healers dps more.

Halone and delirium I agree need some love, dark uses theirs for dps so it has more uptime, I'm 100% with you on this.

Sword oath ogcd, shield would be an on demand rampart and thusly be op. So I think sword should be ogcd.

I 100% agree on aoe damage.

Dark has shadowskin, shadow wall, dark dance, and reprisal for physical, the only pure magic they have is dark mind. Reprisal is rng to proc, as is dark dance so they are not reliable (unless you bait reprisal, but thats still not 100%). Paladin has rampart, sentinel, bulwark, Shelton. Only one of these is rng based and it has a higher chance to proc over dark dance. I agree with not many options for magic, but even in high magic damage fights, there's enough to get through (vice versa for physical on dark).

Tp issues need fixed,  I'd like shield bash to not interrupt combos  (that'd be a little broken but let's shoot for the stars) divine veil to cover the paladin, maybe buff shield to 15% health, make halone reduces physical damage by 10%, make shield swipe a conal aoe enmity boost.

For the dots, 100% yes. Their upkeep is a huge dps gain and thusly, an enmity gain.

First, aggro generation.

Second, damage reduction. I use grit during trash pulls and as a defensive cool down. Keep in mind, that the guaranteed 6 auto attacks you get in blood weapon is enough to reactivate grit, and the 7 gcds you land equal to just over 2/3 of a dark arts (also low blow, plunge, and carve and spit regen via blood weapon), so if you can turn off grit for 15 seconds to activate blood weapon you'll get back enough to turn grit on, for a big hit, and then back off for more dps.

Grit has a 2.7x enmity multiplier (same as the other tanks), so combining it with your aggro generation abilities is a massive increase to your enmity.

1. This comes with experience, read up on machinist rotations, watch some videos, and focus on improving your rotation. Work on improving ALL THE TIME and keep working at it. Focus rotations on dummies, then in 4 man dungeons, then do it in Midas normal. Keep trying and you WILL get better.

2. At this point in the raid cycle, most people don't want to teach someone new, but don't take it to heart. They just don't want to spend time on a5s teaching someone the fight when that time can be used for a8s progression (or a7s or whatever).

99,"First hit is unavoidable, all others can be dodged. I believe it's tapasya or something like that. You get hit then run through the boss behind him and he'll miss the next two (he still aims them where he aimed the first).

Also, on the tank stance argument, you're partially correct. In a raid setting (savage) during progression while new to a fight the mt will normally keep their tank stance on, until they learn when the big hits are. As a dark knight, your enmity gain is insane, and two power slashes are all that's needed in grit for many encounters. After that, enmity is not generally an issue, so tank stance is just lowering damage taken, and damage output. So by stance dancing, turning off grit, using blood weapon you do more damage to help push phases and clear faster. The mp gained from blood weapon is enough to reactivate grit and then some so it's easily reactivated.

132,"So far ex primals do not require a swap (if you're geared, most older primals like ravana can be solo tanked) but here's the low down. 

A tank swap is done when incoming damage to a tank is so high (either due to a debuff or a stream of tank busters) that they will die if it's not taken and mitigated by another tank. An example is A5s. Twinkledinks will apply 3 head ache stacks on a tank, then the *4th* stack induces concussion. Then he does one of two mechanics, a hard hitting knock back tank buster, or a stack mechanic that requires the group to stack with the target. Theres one problem, if either of these attacks hits the concussed tank, they die. So, once the tank gets concussion, the other tank, from this point forward referred to as the off tank or ot, uses provoke to take aggro from the tank with concussion, now here is the true art of tank swapping.

Provoke puts you 1 point of enmity (hate) above the person you provoked it off of, in this case it's the main tank. So, you are 1 point ahead so if the main tank has a dot, or auto attack go off, they'll take hate right back. So when you provoke, you need an enmity (hate) generating attack to follow up. For instance, I'm a dark knight and you're a warrior. As a dark night I will have a minimum of 1 dot up virtually 100% of the time, 2 if salted earth is ready. Now I get concussed and you use provoke, then my dots register their damage and I snap aggro right back. Now let's say you have a skull sunder or butchers block prepped for the swap, these attacks not only do damage to help you gain enmity, they multiply your enmity! Making the swap cleaner and safer!

The swap CAN be done without these abilities, our ot swaps with provoke and normally a fell cleave, but that swap took some ironing out. If you want some ""easier"" practice, a6 has tank swaps (technically all floors do, but that floor is the one that most pug groups still do, meaning the other tank swaps are ignored thanks to over gearing).

Our static stayed together since 3.2 and we lost numerous members due to life changing events (job change, pregnancy, etc.) throughout the past 3 weeks. I continued recruiting and got replacements through ffxiv recruitment on Reddit, the official forums, and my servers fb page. I just as of two nights ago filled all slots, so it takes time. As it seems you're an experienced raider you probably know but I'll still give some advice.

1. Be honest with your expectations. If you want a hardcore/serious raid group then advertise as such and only commit to a group with that same mind set. You're better off waiting another week for the right group.

2. Constantly check pf. This seems obvious but on our server there's static recruitment pfs up all the time.

3. Sub for a mia healer. My first static absorbed me from me covering for their WAR constantly. It sucks that you might not BE absorbed but it opens doors.

Tanks have to keep hate primarily, its our job. All 3 in a raid setting can do this well enough to prevent it being a problem. They need to plan for tank busters, have debuffs on, and use CDs appropriately for said buster. With the newer raids, we also have to push DPS. Maximum uptime on DPS stance. Healers have to know how much raid wide damage is going out at all times and use spells accordingly. They have to know tank busters. They have to know tank CDs so they can plan for a tanks damage. They have to heal DPS through mechanics, and deal with healer specific mechanics. DPS have to do over 1k DPS (most jobs not all) while moving x mechanic to y spot. They have to know when the mechanic is coming to not ruin their combo, and they have to know what adds (when they exist) need to burn. They also have to know other DPS jobs to know what rotation to use (while its usually always up, a bard should know heavy thrust is a DPS increase for them) and position themselves appropriately to maximize DPS. There's more for all 3 roles I know but they're all ""difficult"" in their own way. When you raid you're a team. Even in dungeons you're a team. Nobody has an easy job.

When I raid I run as mt for two reasons: our summoner is a sick twisted son of a bitch who steals aggro by blowing his ogcds in 3 seconds and I'm the only tank he's played with that can keep hate, and  because I steal hate as an ot from a lot of tanks. I'll skip my hate opener, it sounds like you're rolling as ot. I don't use pots or food so if you do you can weave them in. Start in deliverance with heavy swing- maim- storms eye- brutal swing-heavy swing- skull sunder- butchers block- heavy swing- internal release- berserk- fell cleave- infuriate- fell cleave- maim- storms eye (reapplies at 1 second or so) raw intuition- heavy swing- skull sunder- butchers block- fracture- fell cleave. I forget where brutal swing procs but weave it in between gcds. Fracture gets berserk damage buff and your 5 abandon stacks give an increase to crit. If you have law gear or better than this combo is easy to pull off. If eye is applied use butchers block-, if its falling off soon reapply it. If your worried about stealing hate, you need to mt. My fc tanks can keep hate, most df tanks have difficulty, but don't hold yourself back. Ever. Play to the max 100% of the time and keep pushing to be better. Your current mt needs to rework CDs and their rotation if you're stealing hate. If its a static member that is. If its a df run be prepared to mt once hate is stolen.

Now let's say you had 12k when you switched, now instead of needing 4k to be topped off, you need 8k with a 20% heal buff. Now let's flip flop. Your sitting topped off at 20k and need to push DPS, so you swap to deliverance, hp drops to 16k and the other 4k is gone. This is why wars stances are that way.

Now we go to pally, you have 16k, in both stances. One stance reduces damage taken and damage dealt with no need for extra heals, and one increases auto attack with no effect on health. You can't switch unless you use a gcd or interrupt your combo, so when stance dancing you have to be on top of the fight. The mitigation without sacrifice is what's holding the stance dance back. Plus, let's say pally stances are on a 10 second cooldown like wars. What effectively is done is the ability to turn rampart effects on every 10 seconds for 10 seconds to absorb boss blows, then switch back with no repercussion.

If I run defiance and never care about anything but enmity I'm at 300-400 DPS. So DPS becomes responsible for 1400 DPS each, reliable 1400.

If I do my best, I can lower the total raid wide required DPS by 1k (1.1k if everything crits right) lowering it to 5400 minus 400 for Mt (its more I know but let's be conservative) 5000 is now DPS responsibility for clear.

When the DPS is either atrocious, or learning optimization. Do I out DPS them in dungeons as mt? Sometimes and for the same reasons.

Just stop. Stop complaining about jobs you rarely play and don't understand the mechanics behind, having a tank at 60 and having a tank at 60 that plays well is two different situations. I chose WAR because I felt like I helped the team with my DPS strong tank, and its so involved and technical. I play the other two, but main war. Stance dancing on all 3 tanks is not a ""I do damage now, but when a big hit comes I switch back"" scenario, it needs to be timed, and proper CDs used.

I'm not trying to be mean or single you out, you've merely stated what the vast majority of DPS players have stated. You guys make up close to 2/3 of the community, so your voices are heard over ours. Instead of looking at my war and saying ""he did 1100 DPS to Faust, nerf, lol"" say ""ot did 1100, how can I change my rotations to beat that?""

248,"I've been playing paladin extensively, while I love the ideal behind the new abilities, they need change. The tp issue can be solved, but other changes must be made as well, here are my ideas:

Shelltron on longer cooldown, maybe 60 or 90 and it gurantees block for the whole duration- it is very difficult to time this to not proc on an auto attack.

Clemency is uninterruptible, and in sword oath recovers 250 tp. It's not instant and it costs mp, so it should recover more tp, maybe make it recover an allies tp as well?

Stance dancing, make it possible. It is not really possible to do well, as you need to break combo AND use mp. Make it ogcd and problem solved.

Divine veil procs immediately, no heal required, I should be able to use this to help with raid wide damage, which requires coordination with (for me) pug healers and that doesn't happen often.

Stop making everything immune to stun, silence. At the least these should reduce outgoing damage when used in time, right now stun moves are just added DPS for those tanks with it ogcd, so not pally.

And if I'm being honest, sword oath needs to be flat 10% damage gain (maybe 5?) but reduces block chance, for ot and DPS increase.

I love paladin (like all the tanks) I feel invincible against physical damage, but some of the new abilities are lackluster in comparison to other jobs.",2015-10-27 10:17:07+00:00,cwefhq6,1.0,t3_3qarqu,63320.0,ffxiv

New content is very DPS check heavy. Paladin is the only tank with a shield (more mitigation) so he does less damage.

As a tank you will get negative attention from some people if your having difficulty, but don't take it to heart. I have a few suggestions for your early on progression:

Keep your gear up to date. You get some new gear from your gladiator quests, and the main story, but there are gaps that you will either need to replace gear with dungeon drops or purchase gear. Also, make sure the armor says its for GLA, PAL, MAR, WAR, DRK. You can wear disciple of war gear that's more tuned for DPS, so just make sure the gear is right.

Don't be afraid to try new classes. If you play gladiator and dislike it, try another class. You can change classes on the same char. I started as GLA/PAL but later changed to MAR/WAR as I preferred the play style. But on that note, save your main story quests for your primary class/job. The experience from these quests will bring that char to about level 52 by the time it's over.

Foresight does not reduce damage taken by a set percent, it increases your defense rating.

Bloodbath IS a defensive CD. You get 25% health back for damage you do example: hit for 100 dmg, get healed 25. But later on, you'll pair it with other CDs to make it more effective.

Berserk is awesome, but watch the pacification. Once you have a strong enmity lead on a mob/boss this ability rocks. 50% extra damage, so pair it with bloodbath for some extra heals.

Bloodbath stacks heals, all damage done = heals, inner beast heals and so does bloodbath, together. Example: you have a strong enmity lead, but your health is dipping a little below your happy place, you think ""oh, I'll just do what that internet weirdo said, bloodbath and inner beast!"" Wrong. Use bloodbath first, and use berserk when you have 4 stacks of wrath (it gives you one stack) your inner beast now is a 450 potency, BUT heals you at about 563. You can usually get two of these off in one berserk.",2015-09-21 15:13:05+00:00,cv92b4u,3.0,t1_cv91imm,1334.0,ffxiv

Defiance does not reduce damage taken, it increases health and healing.  So with similar gear you get hit as hard as the other tanks out of tanking stance, but you have more health to soak it. It pretty much equals out but it is something to keep in mind.

Wrath stacks you gain with your combos and CDs increase parry by 2% each stack, 10% parry increase is nice, but inner beast, unchained, and steel cyclone are better. Steel cyclone is an aoe enmity generator, inner beast is a 300 potency attack that heals and gives a 20% mitigation for 6 seconds, unchained removes your damage reduction.

After the run he started being pissy saying I was purposely stealing hate, only to have the other pally say ""he can't steal what you never had dude, he wasn't even using his bb combo"".

I guess my issue is rare (what tank to play instead of why do I have to tank) and as I said both to me are tons of fun, and I run all strength in stats and 2 vit accessories and have few survival issues.",2015-09-03 13:46:48+00:00,cup875v,1.0,t3_3jhcp2,3976.0,ffxiv

353,"Drk is not an easy tank to ""master"", but still don't let bad people think your attempt at a new job is faulty. I tank, I have all 3 job tanks past 50, conjurer to 15 and pug to 12 for cross class. I have tanked content across numerous difficulty levels, and been told that I'm the best and worst tank that a group has dealt with (same group). My experience is that out of 5 df dungeons, one will be a bad run. Healer won't heal (or won't heal well), DPS pulls and tanks 2 other mobs while I tank current 3 mobs (number of mobs dungeon dependant). These are people, maybe they're going all out on DPS because in 30 minutes they have to get ready for work,  possibilities are endless but here's a strategy I've found works.
As a tank, you have to be a little bit of an asshole, you control where the party goes, what mobs to fight, and clear rate. If you don't want DPS or healers pulling, tell them "" you pull it, you tank it"". If they do an accidental pull they'll tell you, but you can't let these people walk on you. Healer says you're taking a lot of damage? Ask them what their class is, its healer. It's in the name. Always use cds to help them, and move out of aoes, but their job is to heal YOURS is to take damage.",2015-08-31 12:26:23+00:00,culqnp7,1.0,t3_3j0lq9,45278.0,ffxiv
354,"I used df for Fenrir dungeon, and played my 50 war. We started off fine, made it to Fenrir, and the mechanics were explained to me and the DPS, who was also new. Even after the mechanics were explained, everyone wiped on the second round of ring around the glacier. Everyone, except a warrior, and his blm buddy. I went all out, hitting him with everything I had and the blm healed me, his heals and my self heals kept me going. Then, at about 14% health I lost my blm. I fought hard used cds, life steal and hovered between 1k and 3k health, when Fenrir got down to 2% I couldn't keep my health up beyond 1.5k. He wittled me down, I was out of cds and did not want to wipe then I remembered..... Holmgang.

355,"Full time tank here, my opinion based on my experience. If a healer talks, but keeps my hp up, we have no problems. If a healer dps's and keeps my health up, we have no problems. By health up I don't mean cure spams, I mean if I can't escape an aoe or take a big hit I'll survive. I always rotate my cooldowns, have health stealing abilities, and damage reduction that I use constantly to promote you dpsing, but if I have a run like last night where I died and then you have a 4 paragraph message pop up then pick a crafting class.",2015-08-22 01:17:50+00:00,cubcirr,1.0,t3_3humyx,39993.0,ffxiv

When my wife approached him, he threatened her and said he'd take our cars if we didn't pay him for each vehicle. She called me and I called his boss and got the run around so we let it go.

Two weeks later we went on vacation and when we came back, he taped another expired plate ticket to the paint of my brand new truck. So.... I called the mayor, who did nothing, then a lawyer. The lawyer said he'd take care of it and that they would pay to get the paint residue off of my truck.

Fast forward one week, I pulled my motorcycle out to get to my lawn mower and upon getting the lawn mower out I saw a car parked at the end of my driveway. I approached the person to see them writing down my motorcycle's info, I asked who he was, he said none of my goddamned business. I asked him to leave and he refused so I called the police.
