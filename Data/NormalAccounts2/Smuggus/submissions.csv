First off, I have war at i170, drk at 170 and pally at lvl 58 (don't remember ilvl. I tank, I have not played DPS at all (lie, I played out to 12 for cross class), but I dabbled in healing. I've played all dungeons save Alexander, and want to give my two cents.

As any of the three classes, in four man instances, my healers have never complained that I was ""squishy"", on the contrary most love how they can heal in cleric stance and push DPS. There IS a reason for this, why most tanks you encounter are dying in two trash blows, there's actually a few, and we'll cover them here.

1. Tanking stances
While this one seems obvious, most runs I've done in 8 man where we have a tank that can't stay alive or keep aggro, they have they're offensive stance on. My experience has taught me that if I HAVE A HUGE AGGRO LEAD and I'm not getting "" cure spammed"" I can pop a CD and switch stances until I'm low on CDs or the healer seems stressed, then its back to the tanking stance (as mt or if I'm mting adds) the healers added DPS out parses me going all out offensive, so if my damage being reduced increases party damage, that's what I'll do.

2. CDs not just oh shit buttons
Did you pull a mob? Pop a CD. Are they half dead and your CD is off? Pop a CD. Are they barely doing any damage, and getting MURDERED by DPS? Save the CD. It's simple, we tanks need CDs, it makes healers lives easier, and ours. If I'm consistently taking less damage, I'm less likely to die if I can't escape an aoe (when DPS spams aoes, it makes it harder to see the marker, but honestly dps, please do it!) or take an unusually heavy hit. The game gives us so many, that if you space them out in between pulls (2 CDs a pull or 1 situation pending) you'll always have CDs to burn. On that note, after a tank buster, convalescence helps, a lot.

3. Gear, that stuff that keeps the pain away
Do you have on tanking gear? Check what classes its for, if you don't see your tank class on the list, not for you. Essentially you're the meat shield, and as the meat shield you should be wrapped in the best meat protection you can get. Priority piece? Weapon. Every time. Weapons drastically increase your damage and the stat gains are good, so get a weapon that's good (dungeon drops, msq, market board) next upgrade WHATEVER IS THE LOWEST ILVL ON THE LEFT SIDE. The right side IS important but not AS important, left side is your meat protection.

4. Knowing the dungeons
This helps so much, that I should state it twice. If you know what enemies use aoe, boss mechanics, tank busters, and level mechanics, it helps you position enemies, know when to use cds, and how to prioritize marks. However, watching a dungeon guide CAN and many cases will, have spoilers. If your fine with that, they're a great resource, if not, TELL THE TEAM YOUR NEW. They get a message when there's a new player, but they don't know who. Speak up. I haven't had a single dungeon where them taking two minutes to explain mechanics was a problem. So speak up.

I hope this both helps tanks and helps people understand why some tanks seem ""squishy"". I hope this helps someone!",ffxiv,To those who have encountered the squishy tanks,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3l64yp/to_those_who_have_encountered_the_squishy_tanks/

My question is mainly for lvl 60s, which tank when utilized by a mediocre to good tank do you prefer working with? I want to level them both up but I can't gear both of them reasonably fast so I need help picking one. I haven't finished msq, but I can't continue msq until I'm lvl 54.

I was dutied to aurum vale as warrior and the round started with insults (directed at me) about how the DPS can't believe that they have to deal with ""another shitty warrior"". Keep in mind we hadn't done anything yet. So I said that I'm far from the best but I've had no bad runs yet, so they kick me out. I reque and end up with the same damn group. They decide that they'll "" deal with me"" so they can do the run.
Next they ask for a speedrun, I say that I've never done one but if healers up to it I'll try. Healer gave thumbs up so enter first room. I pull two mobs so I can see their cc ability, and began my struggle for life. They did NOTHING, healer was struggling to keep me healed, as I was now DPS/tank, and we managed to beat maybe 2 monsters, it was then I realized what DPS was doing.
Every, mob was on us, DPS didn't use any aoe and I couldn't keep up, I popped my cds, and before I could build wrath, I died. This happened 3 times on the same mob, healer said dps were assholes and left. DPS then proceeded to ream me a new asshole.
I left the game thinking of what I could have done to have tanked better, when I get tells sent to me. 
They were insulting me through tells, and did not stop until I logged out. As I said before, I am not the best tank BUT, I do try my best.
