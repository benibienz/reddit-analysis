Then, I had this crazy idea, because they said I had to wait xx years for an allotment that was the size of a postage stamp, and I needed to get growing for my family now! Why not find a field and grow for EVERYONE?

As I said, this is very rough and will need to be looked into in detail before being stamped with a seal of approval! 

Using this subscription makes your weekly box (7-10 items/5kg) around 175kr

We are thinking of doing a basic box which gives a fortnightly delivery, a standard box with a weekly delivery, a 'business' box for restaurants/cafes/hotels and one-off boxes.

The way some US CSA's compensate for this, is only delivering for 28 weeks of the year. But most CSA's deliver all through the year with the risk of a lighter box during the out of season times. 

Of course, the first couple of years will be very trial and error as we learn what is and what isn't in season and what to grow the other times. We also plan to have hoop houses so that we can extend the season of some crops.

158,"I have planned to have year round salad (lettuce) growing in the polytunnel. Excellent advise having it in every share! 

I did not think of mailing, I shall look into that, thank you very much.

Donations too local shelters was my plan, although I wasn't sure if they take fresh produce here in Sweden. I know in the UK it has to be canned or packaged to be accepted.

I wasn't planning on Wholesale so much, just shares for local restaurants and or cafes. 

I am on every CSA I could find on FB, Twitter and Tumblr! :D",2015-07-19 08:19:17+00:00,ct8h9w3,2,t1_ct87zct,24898,farming

Box of veggies to local eateries was my first thought, I am glad some one else suggested it, thank you! ",2015-07-19 08:16:20+00:00,ct8h8ds,2,t1_ct81y8m,37561,farming

161,"To add another question - how many CSA's and Homesteaders plant Sunflowers.

If you do have sunflowers, why? Are they just for fun, for the bees, for the seeds? I see a lot of home steads and CSA fields have them and I am curious to know why.",2015-07-16 07:35:27+00:00,ct54vcw,1,t3_3cwh2q,420652,farming

163,"Oh I am definitely going to try it. Anything is worth doing if you have not done it before and others have had great success.

Obviously there are other factors that will come into it, like soil, location, seeds, but as I said, I am more than happy to give it a go. If it works, I will 'spread' the technique! :D

I just wish I could get onto my damn field before the New Year. I could be doing so much in preparation for next years sowing.",2015-07-12 19:42:09+00:00,ct0xo6j,6,t1_ct0vd1v,4349,farming
164,"Hi again, so I went back and re-read everything you said and thought I should comment again.

Getting chickens is definitely something I will be looking at doing, when I have worked out how to look after them in the Winter. Here in Sweden the Winter is long, cold and snowy! As I will not live close to the field, I might not be able to get there every day if it has been a heavy snowfall the night before so I need to work out what to do before committing to chickens.

I have read and watched some videos on the Eden gardening, and whilst I am not religious in any shape or form and do not believe in a higher being, I am fascinated by the whole process. 

Letting nature do all the work for me certainly looks good, but honestly, if it is too good to be true, it usually is. Although, I am more than happy to try this in part of my field for certain crops as an experiment to see how they fair against crops done in the usual way.

If successful, I will be more than happy to extend this type of 'gardening' to the rest of my field. At the moment though, I have had my 'brain erased' by schooling and trained as an RHS Horticulturist, so I shall be using those skills in the first couple of years.

But, again, I am very interested in ALL methods used to bring back the highest yield, organically of course.",2015-07-12 08:21:02+00:00,ct0ihgc,4,t1_cszyg33,45424,farming

166,"I have already added chickens into the 'mix' so to speak, but at the moment I am struggling with what to do with them in Winter.

Here in Sweden it gets bitterly cold with heavy snow, and I am a bit concerned on what do it if I can not get too the field for any reason. As I do not own a tractor or snow mobile, I don't want the chickens left without fresh water, food or heat of any sort.

But they are DEFINITELY on my list of 'adds', along with a beehive! :)",2015-07-12 07:07:52+00:00,ct0hb56,2,t1_cszwlnl,44746,farming
167,"Firstly - I am not allowed pets where I live (in a rental) so  dog is just not something I can have.

Second - I already have a plan that has been written, re-written, replanned and planned again! :) 

Soil testing is not something I will be doing beyond a simple test to find what type it is. I have a kit to find the ph, the rest will fix itself through crop rotation as I have done for many years.

Thank you very much for your advice, it is much appreciated.",2015-07-12 07:06:12+00:00,ct0ha4b,2,t1_cszy5a7,41544,farming
168,"I already incorporate all these methods as I have been a grower for as many years as I can remember. It is in my blood, my parents grow, as did their parents before them and many relatives grow and run  market stalls.

The ploughing is not down to me but the council who are leasing me the field. Once they have done it, it will not be done again, not by me anyway. Cardboard and mulch is the only way I do it! :) 

Plenty of rain here, and snow... lots and lots and LOTs of snow!

Thank you so much for all your advice, it is very much appreciated and there is a lot of information here for me to go through. THank you!",2015-07-12 06:59:54+00:00,ct0h637,4,t1_cszyg33,40556,farming

170,"Absolutely fantastic advice. I shall take it all on board.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write it all, and I read it all, re-read, then read bits out to the other half who works in an office for far to many hours and is completely jealous that I will be outdoors most days.

Breaking my back, yes, but I will be outdoors doing what I love doing the most!

I have no expectations of customers for the first year, none at all. My only concern is what to do with all my produce at the end of year one. I can assume that the local hostels and homeless shelters can only take so much food by donation, and even then most places do not accept fresh foods.

I have wanted to get a hoops house as apposed to poly tunnels. I think the poly's will be too warm... never even thought about weeds in there! I shall certainly rethink that.

Oooh, I like them 'seeders'. not seen them before, I was trying to work out how to plant so many seeds all at once, though I did consider starting EVERYTHING in a greenhouse/poly/hoop house. I need to look at that again then. It is perhaps for the best that I am not allowed on my field for sowing till next year.

I am doing this through the local government, Agricultural department, and they seem to want to give me a LOT of help, but at the moment language is a huge barrier as I do not speak Swedish. I am on a course, but it's slow going. Their English is not great and we lose a lot in translation.

Again, THANK YOU! Huge, massive help!",2015-07-11 18:09:04+00:00,cszvlln,2,t1_cszqewi,10870,farming
171,"That is one thing that is NOT present here, a farmers market of any type.

It is also another reason why I am taking the CSA route, as there is only one other farm here in Sweden that does CSA and he does it quite strangely.

Instead of weekly delivered boxes, which is how we CSA in the UK, he opens his field to subscribers who come along and help themselves too harvest whatever products they want.",2015-07-11 14:28:11+00:00,cszpg77,2,t1_csznnus,5064,farming
