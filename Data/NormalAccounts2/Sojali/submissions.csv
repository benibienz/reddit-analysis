The weight is STILL not coming off. I eat healthily, I exercise, I walk everywhere I can if I am not on my bicycle and if anything I feel like I am getting bigger! 

I have asked my Drs (I have seen a few) for help with the weight loss, but they always say ""next visit we will discuss it"", but at the next visit they say the same. I have kept food diaries, I have kept exercise diaries, I am doing everything suggested by the 'fat nurse'.

I was even told by one Dr ""Its in your genes, I assume most females in your family carry extra weight?"" Which is true of some on my Mums side, but on Dads side they are all gorgeously sized.

I have been seeking alternative therapy for the thyroid and/or weight loss, and without heading down any sort of magic pill route, I have noticed that gluten free pops up a lot. My problem with this, is gluten free items seem to cost a fortune and most times have little or no taste making the meal hard to digest (pun intended).

I have had an amazing response to it everywhere (except Reddit where I had nothing but negativity) and I have huge support from a lot of people. 

My problem is, of course, finance. 

While I 'can' technically start my business without any funding, it will be a long drawn out process, but if i had some financial backing, I could purchase some equipment to make the start a lot smoother and cleaner.

I am an English expat living in Gothenburg, Sweden since March, and I have tried hunting down help, but so far I have come up blank.

I am hoping to grow CSA, whereby people subscribe to the farm, pay a yearly sub, then every week they can have a box of mixed veg delivered, or they can come and harvest it themselves.

At the moment, my thinking is 'Victory garden' style planting, very allotment like. I have a plan made up, I have the seeds, I have the field which is being ploughed this Winter, fencing around it, a well is being installed for permanent onsite water all ready for me in the new Year.

I am also hoping to have at least three poly tunnels. One for seeds, one for salads and one for exotics.
