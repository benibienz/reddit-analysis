3,"I like your view! 
The most common insults i always hear from both ends are
Science/Math/CS to arts is they often say they  are unintelligent. While from arts to science/maths/cs they often call them ""introverted anti social losers"". We need a world where everyone is like you and just thinks ""hey maybe he/she is just not interested in what i am, interested in but that does not make him dumber then me or less then me"".",2015-08-15 23:02:53+00:00,cu4bd3b,2,t1_cu4b0r6,724,AskReddit
4,"I have never seen that or experienced that yet  My views are that as long as you love what you're doing, you have an interest for it and willing to have a vision of what you want to do it with it you're fine. You could be an exceptional person in the math sciences but if you don't really like it would you really make it through the interview half the time?",2015-08-15 22:59:44+00:00,cu4b9wc,2,t1_cu4akv6,1447,AskReddit
5,Don't like to refer to people as assholes i just want to get inside their head and see it from their perspective cause i wonder why their is all this indifference. ,2015-08-15 22:23:46+00:00,cu4a89i,2,t1_cu496sa,2057,AskReddit
6,I guess that may be true. But with the commonality of the bachelor degrees now a days most people look towards grad school so at the end of the day does it matter? cause grad school does not even look at what degree's you previously had. I am just trying to decide what to do with my life I'm only 18 i have friends in both fields and i am interested in some aspects of both . ,2015-08-15 22:22:56+00:00,cu4a7bo,4,t1_cu49xjc,548,AskReddit
7,"But does that not depend on the University?
I am doubtful that you could go to a place say like Harvard or something not study and come out with a 4.0 GPA no matter what the course is. Although i do agree with you some standards for arts/social sci etc are way to low but then again if the university does not specialize in that field what's the point of going their anyways.",2015-08-15 22:18:08+00:00,cu4a29b,2,t1_cu49wfg,323,AskReddit
8,"Well not many people have this playfulness. Many times i hear science degrees calling other degrees useless and stating that they'll just end up working at McDonalds.  I understand science/math is a very practical and applicable field in the work force but i just cannot seem to solve why when someone ask ""should i persue a field in (list arts here)"" their like do you wanna live in a homeless shelter or something like that?",2015-08-15 22:15:22+00:00,cu49z99,2,t1_cu49no2,638,AskReddit
9,"If i may ask where did you go for you're CS degree? and where did your friend go for his English degree?
But don't get me wrong i agree with you! but i have met some very intelligent people in the art's field!  i guess cause their is so many people studying the arts then a high % of them could be don't know how to word it but ""less intelligent?""  hence giving the arts a bad name?",2015-08-15 22:10:36+00:00,cu49u71,2,t1_cu49b34,1021,AskReddit
10,"Well the art's can be somewhat broad it can range from English, sociology etc all the way to Economics. I have a very diverse group of friends we have multiple engineers, CS students (in school) but the funny thing is we both struggle to solve solve problems from our subject areas.

11,"Interesting view!
I guess that is somewhat true because i guess their are""bird degrees"" offered by University.  And the fact that 51% of people in Canada have a post-secondary education can contribute to that.  But a degree in something such as Political science from Harvard would beat an engineering degree from some random school. So does it come down to what school you went to over what subject you studied?",2015-08-15 22:04:10+00:00,cu49n0n,2,t1_cu49eda,451,AskReddit

24,"With respect,  I never mentioned sex in any way. I simply think to like someone you need 2 things 1: attraction to personality and     2: Physical attraction, i never said white women were sexual. i just said from my experience it just seems that way (They usually were the only ones to crack or get a dirty joke from me) . I do not think i am inferior to them because i do not want to buy into that Hollywood bullshit about my ethnic background. At my high school it was a mainly white school and as an Asian i didn't do too bad for myself. I was president of clubs, did athletics won MVPs but i am just wondering why the attraction is not there when i am just like any guy. I am just a little frustrated that all the prejudice is put on us; i am just as nice as any guy, just as strong as any guy but yet the first assumption about me is probably ""Quiet"", ""Nerdy"", ""Anime Freak"", List goes on.",2015-07-30 23:31:24+00:00,ctm5wzh,2,t1_ctm5amf,1053,relationships
