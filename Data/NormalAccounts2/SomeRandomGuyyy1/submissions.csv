But now i am not and I also feel like a disturbance if randomly talk to a girl sitting down cause i may be distracting her from studying.... I don't know what to do.

**tl;dr**: girl always text me, ask me what i'm doing.

So this summer me and this girl started talking. She always texts me first ask me whats up, i ask her the same and such. She always responds with ""nothing im bored"" and ask what i'm doing. 

I am very active so im nearly always outside but recently i've wondered is this a hint for me to ask her out? 

She seems to never be busy and recently she texts me a lot more sends me snaps that somewhat are ""revealing"". 

The thing about this girl is she is very nice and everything but i am undecided if i even want to take a chance with her.

She smokes and drinks i drink but don't do it as much as she does -- she also smokes weed which is a huge turnoff for me..

I just wanna know if she's hinting at me and if she is should i give it a chance because it's been awhile now.

and by revealing i dont mean nudes i mean like she's always very lightly dressed and the pictures seem to always reveal her ""cleavage"".",relationships,male 18 is this a hint?,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3g3nhq/male_18_is_this_a_hint/

furthermore every girl in my life has said i'm nice, funny and they say they feel comfortable and protected around me. Its weird cause i've only liked 2 girls in my life and both times it never worked out i don't know what im doing wrong.
