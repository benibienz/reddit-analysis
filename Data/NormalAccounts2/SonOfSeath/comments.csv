4,"ok haha first of all that gamestation story is awesome.

but second and in response to most of your other points; i can see why you explain it all that way! however, another post on this thread from someone who specifically worked with contracts pointed out that the best contracts are written so vague that the company can honestly use the vague wording to pretty much enforce their decision on any matter in any way they want. which is why i am reading things a certain way and you are reading them a different way. just an example of their vague wording serving whatever purpose it needs to serve.

at the risk of sounding like a broken record: whether or not they ban, this post is not to shit on the people who are using this method to fight maxwell, this post was a) to let people know that there is a good chance this is a direct ToS breech, but more importantly b) they shouldn't post about it like its some ""mega helpful workaround for a hard fight"". if they want to take the risk, thats cool with me, but I'm more wanting to protect people who *arent* comfortable with ToS violations by letting them know this very likely IS.

8,"that argument is a bit off but i see where you're going with it. except in your scenario it is a 100% chance to get away with something. since this is the first GL content we've had where people might be tempted to take advantage of an exploit it would be more accurate to use your same example but add that next to that crosslight is a small brick wall that COULD be blocking your vision from a police car. the chances that there is a police car behind that wall? probably pretty fucking small, and if someone wanted to blow right past them it is not my place to tell them not to, but if i knew that there was a CHANCE that a cop might be hiding behind that wall A) I would stop at the wall and B) if my friend was driving i would at least say ""hey so i have the peace of mind that i warned you, there might be a cop on the other side of that wall, now do whatever you will"".

12,"in law and agreements like this in general, you don't have to literally cause a server to explode to be considered violating (i). If an action of yours creates any amount of stress to a server more than normal operation of the app then they actually have legal grounds for punishment. they ""could say"" that any extra server requests puts pressure on their server/costs them money. We don't know if the server is very negatively impacted by this exploit but what we do know is that you are making multiple extra server requests that if played legitimately would not be made otherwise.

again, i didn't finish all of my law classes so some of this seems gray-area to me, and I'm explaining this poorly i know :( but basically if they just say ""them doing this has a chance to cause a booboo in our server"", then they can make you guilty for knowingly participating.

on (m) how is it not exploiting a bug? since you're essentially rerolling the game after the server has already made a decision? at any rate the people posting how to do it are in violation of the second half of (m) in coaching others through it.

in the end, i don't want to enforce people to play any certain way. i don't care if someone doesnt care if their account gets banned.

this is more for the benefit of other people, who didn't know that this *MIGHT* be a violation and *MIGHT* be bannable. to me and my understanding of the ToS its a direct violation, ill respect your opinion that it may not be. but to me it is. and i want to protect other peoples accounts who don't want that risk and just didn't know otherwise :)",2016-11-21 23:29:58+00:00,daa86pp,2.0,t1_daa7td2,513.0,FFBraveExvius

14,"and thats fine but there are other people out there with real money put into the game, lets say my brother who has $300 dumped into banners trying to get lightning/elza etc. 

he called me and said ""dude! found an easy way to beat maxwell i read on the forum"". he didn't know it was a violation of ToS. then you have people on here saying its a ""easy way"", ""free maxwell!"", etc.

your argument is made under the assumption that the person performing the exploit knows the risks, has weighed the odds, and is comfortable enough with those odds to proceed. the problem is then they share it on here as if its a solution and i imagine other people like my brother are not able to weigh the odds because they don't know. they *should*. but a lot won't.

to your other point, GL hasn't had a timed event that is quite this difficulty level yet. we've had some ""tough"" battles but nothing quite with the stakes of a 5* unit, with such an intense fight attached to it. so theres a good chance GL hasn't had a reported banning because there has never been content to truly merit a desire to do it.",2016-11-21 23:19:16+00:00,daa7pyi,2.0,t1_daa6z99,1031.0,FFBraveExvius

17,"this is 100% ban-able offense and i would never do this again. if you even read the ToS agreement you agreed to when you started playing it explicitly mentions doing this kind of thing as grounds for permanent account ban.

first off is this note:

&gt;(i) (you are not to...) engage in any activity that interferes with a user's access to the Services or the proper operation of the Services, or otherwise causes harm to the Services, the Company, or other users of the Services; 

so obviously intentionally pulling yourself off the server to get a different outcome is violating the first point on that and is easily traceable on their end as another part of the agreement states that you give them full right to record/store/review/use all of your actions/interactions within the app.

&gt;(m)	(you are not to...) exploit any bug or vulnerability in the Services or in any product of the Company to gain unfair advantage. You agree not to communicate the existence of any such bug (either directly or through the public posting) to any other user or third party;

that one is obvious as it is directly what this method entails. exploiting a bug/vulnerability to re-roll the rng for a favorable outcome that gives you a unit/victory that you aren't able to get through legitimate means. further posting it on reddit is a violation of the second half of that point

those are the two most glaring, but there are at least 5 other articles in the ToS that could be said to vaguely describe this exploit. and as the rest of the terms states, they're all liable to be banned if the company chooses to.

i would take this post down and never do it again.",2016-11-21 22:47:19+00:00,daa6b0x,1.0,t3_5e6z73,1549.0,FFBraveExvius

70,"its tough to say. with 1 time per account i don't think it would really have a huge impact on their long term bottom line because obviously every whale would do it for either a duplicate of an op character or another character with a TM they want another of. it would just be gravy for them. and since its just once per account they'd just go back their regular spending patterns right away.

for intermediate players like me, ""f2p"" that will put in a random chunk here or there to stay competent or the people who REALLY want their favorite FF character because thats why they're playing in the first place, it may convince them to spend more than they ever otherwise would have. i won't put another dollar into this game because of the RNG nature and because of the math you listed in your comment, but if this feature was added i ABSOLUTELY would spend it to get my Orlandu. I'm sure there are others like me.

then theres a third group who would say wtf $150? you out of your mind. no chance, thats 2.5x AAA console titles. not for a gacha character, no. and in that case it literally is no change to Gumi's bottom line at all, they'll keep being f2p like they were maybe replenishing lapis a few bucks at a time if at all.

tl;dr: if they definitely make it once per account i don't think a $100 or something pick-a-unit would change the spending of whales, wouldn't change the spending of the most f2p players but would get an extra $100 from players like me that otherwise wouldn't! i think it'd be a good play eventually.",2016-11-17 18:10:20+00:00,da4hnr4,7.0,t1_da4h0y9,770.0,FFBraveExvius

122,"&gt; You can gain boosters and armor and you can gain currency to buy engrams that might give you unique gear that is no longer available ingame. Armor in destiny is not strictly cosmetic anyway.

the inference of pay-to-win, or a benefit of your dollars beyond just visual upgrades implies a pay-to-win element and that was one of your concerns. you are saying certain elements of armor, in your opinion, provide benefits that change gameplay. that would be ""pay to win"".

in the end, its cosmetic upgrades. whatever perks you have on your IB armor from y1, your current legendary gear you've gotten has the same perks. there is nothing on armor that is deserving of 

""WHAT?! THATS SO POWERFUL HOW DID YOU GET THAT?""

""dude, you have to buy packages to get something this awesome""

no, its just normal gear. the ONLY reason you'd need to spend money on it is if it is very important to you that you *visually* look like a y1 iron banner guardian. who cares? its cosmetic.

again, its time to thank bungie for keeping weapons and actual gameplay altering, radiant-package-exclusive loot out of the game. because when black ops was introducing the loot crates, they said at a time ""it doesnt contain weapons or anything important, just visual customizations/taunts/etc to personalize your soldier"" then the dlc came out. NOT ONLY did you have to pay for the dlc but then VERY powerful weapons were hidden DEEP in the rng layers of those boxes. so then you had a scenario where you got killed by an amazing weapon and message your opponent:

sony even confirmed you'll need to use a device that can take advantage of the features. you won't get 4k display on a 1080p screen. you also won't get the HDR on a non-HDR screen (most TVs aren't, this is a relatively new feature).

to add to that, all PS4s actually support HDR now, not just the pro. so if you do by chance have an HDR compatible screen you will already get that upgrade.

so without a 4k tv you will get slightly smoother edges but thats really it without owning a 4k tv. so no, not really for you. hope that helps!",2016-10-27 15:45:49+00:00,d9a38f2,2.0,t1_d98egvi,97042.0,FFXV

also, the 4k will obviously only be 4k on a 4k tv.

so when he asks if it will be worth buying a pro *without* a 4k tv the answer is ""probably not"" because at that point you're only going to get some slightly denser pixel clumping so lines will be a bit smoother.

126,"My point stands that it isn't any different than the cards. Its random for money but there is actual power and advantage behind competitive games like pokemon, yugioh and magic when you get lucky with rare cards otherwise you have a ton of common worthless duplicates. but thats not what gambling is nor is that the service that casinos provide.

gambling, as i said is: pay $5, there is a chance you get something and there is a chance you literally get nothing. in destiny that $5 will get you SOMETHING. whether its a small booster, a sparrow, an ornament, but you're always guaranteed silver dust which then can be used for other purchases.

and they actually ARE cosmetic. free-to-play players already get stacks of boosters through weekly packages, faction rank ups, etc. my brother doesnt have a credit card and is strictly free to play and is sitting on a minimum of a dozen of each booster. and you know what? they don't do much anyway.

secondly, i assume by armor you mean the iron banner stuff? that is not a good argument because it is again cosmetic. you get the armor at 3LL and are only getting it because you want that visual style, it is not giving a light boost to anyone and its stats are no better than anything you already have in multiples across your characters.

also the engram argument is moot because that was never supposed to exist. [here is the post from bungie saying they are investigating it because it is an unintended bug and is not supposed to be a thing](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/214886185?sort=0&amp;page=0&amp;path=1)

it IS cosmetic. if you think having extra hand cannon ammo on your chest plate is pay to win or giving some kind of an advantage than you are blissfully ignorant to what pay to win actually looks like.

microtransactions is the future of this industry, as sad as that is, it just rakes in far too much money to go anywhere. instead of trying to be part of some massive bash against bungie i instead would give them props that they've stuck to their guns so much about contents being only cosmetic stuff. because in call of duty they put VERY good weapons inside their loot crates and i saw a twitch streamer spend $300 on crates and didn't get 1 of the 3 weapons. **THAT** is unacceptable practice. but people spending $80 on a black hawk moon skin that doesnt give them any other benefits? that is very harmless.

in fact, even battlefield 1 is going to have micro transactions for their loot crates and those, too, contain exclusive loot crate weapons. whats even worse is that you don't get the weapon to drop immediately either. you have an RNG chance at a ""puzzle piece"" and then you need multiple puzzle pieces to construct the weapon.

I saw you say packs of Magic cards never caught on by you (I'll call bullshit since that game is globally popular) but that is no different. Money for a selection of random cards that are more than likely worthless while you search for that ultra rare and powerful chase card.

And that's even worse than destiny because destiny packs are strictly cosmetic. Card packs while using the same concepts of addiction and randomness contain actual POWER behind the rarity that gives you legitimate advantage if you get lucky.

130,"you're right but i would argue you have game development time lines a little wonky. 

release schedules don't *only* exist to accommodate development times, they can also exist in order to generate the most cashflow possible. what i mean by that is bloodborne released and if you read interviews Miyazaki has said they actually planned to do 2 separate DLC releases too. split it up into the first half culminating in fighting ludwig and maria and do the Fishing village as DLC 2 going through the glass and fighting laurence and the orphan. 

either way, last minute they decided to combine the DLC and release them as one packaged expansion. 

that means they had both packs developed inside the time frame you outlined. that very well could be what happened here too. they might have DLC almost entirely finished and are instead choosing to release it in 2 releases because the longer they draw it out the more money they can make. they make season pass sales to the hardcore, they sell pack 1 to people who want to see if they care at all about dark souls dlc, then they release dark souls 2, they sell more to the people who liked dlc 1 and want to do 2. they sell to people who don't like snowy areas so they skipped 1 and only bought 2. then they release a GotY edition that includes the games and packs and they sell more of those to the holdouts. its iffy imo but it makes dollar sense (cents? ...no, bad pun).

&gt;***tl;dr -*** you don't know that both DS3 dlc aren't done right now but they're employing a staggered release schedule to make more money. perhaps they didn't do that with bloodborne because they wanted to get it out, close the book on that game and move on to their other projects",2016-10-26 18:15:21+00:00,d98treh,3.0,t1_d98qw4z,3389.0,darksouls3

unless you don't know how resistances work and why a weapon with 3 damage types is a bad thing compared to a strong weapon with one to two elements?

first of all your build is really not in the neighborhood of where most pvp players want to be, 170 is a bit high so to put on two clutch rings is begging for a ass kicking in most pvp (if we were talking sl120).

but because of how split resistances work, if you wanted to have a build with the exact same stat distribution you have here you would be much better off going with no faith, 75 intelligence and using the Moonlight Greatsword with a magic clutch ring. 

you'd have a 650 attack sword, without having to use a timed buff, with one element for resistance checks and the utility of actual weapon arts in addition to the normal greatsword set, and only one clutch ring lowering your defenses.

I'm excited to play with the Onyx Blade but that doesnt change the fact that it is still unfortunate that the buff doesnt apply additional dark damage instead of adding a third type is all.",2016-10-25 22:17:00+00:00,d97o0f6,8.0,t1_d97niad,719.0,darksouls3

This tightly enclosed casing of the Switch won't have the ventilation or the fan available to keep it cool if it were to try to run something like true Skyrim Remastered.

for comparison sake, look at iPhone games. because of the crispness of the display, the graphic processor, games on an iPhone often can look crisper/better (if not on par) than games on ps3 did (maybe other than something like Last of Us). It could easily work something like that. the games will be crisp, they'll look better than ps3/360, but they can't and won't be close to current gen. 

you're right the article is speculation, but its actually the most ""technical"" speculation and in my humble opinion an article that has an in-depth look at what the processor will most likely look like based on actual comparisons to what is out there combined with information confirmed by Nvidia, that article is kinda what the standard expectation should be until Nintendo confirms otherwise (and if it was on par with ps4/x1 they would be shouting that from the rooftops day 1)",2016-10-21 14:16:33+00:00,d91rc5b,5.0,t1_d91qxpn,590.0,DestinyTheGame
169,"you're contradicting yourself with that argument.

&gt;""It can run the skyrim remaster though""

If that ""wasn't posted by Nintendo you have absolutely zero reason to believe"" it.

neither Nintendo or Bethesda have confirmed that Skyrim Resmaster is coming to the console, despite seeing it in the trailer. Nintendo released a confirmed list of games coming and that game is not included. Nintendo even said in their press release they selected a sample of games that show what the console COULD do. that means it wasn't even necessarily real gameplay but could have just been test footage. it could very well be another version of skyrim closer to the ps3/360 version released but the selling point being you can bring it on the subway instead of improved graphics. still cool, but different.

relevant article: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-not-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-despite-a/1100-6444660/

also, [this is the article talking about the nvidia pieces](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/analyzing-the-nintendo-switchs-tegra-processor/1100-6444670/) its not a dumb article, is quite extensive and this should be what people believe until nintendo shows them otherwise (which they likely won't). there isn't really a lot of technology out there that has industry people saying ""HOW THE HELL ARE THEY DOING THIS"" and anyone who knows about hardware can take one look at the form factor of this console and confirm that it will 100% not be able to do what the current gen consoles can do. Do you not hear your x1/ps4 fan when you've been playing for an hour fighting to keep your console from melting to liquid? this console can't do that, so it HAS to be a fair bit weaker.",2016-10-21 14:06:21+00:00,d91qx76,3.0,t1_d91qibn,617.0,DestinyTheGame
170,"Also, you should look up whether skyrim is actually coming or not because they haven't confirmed that title despite being in the trailer. Kinda the same as ""reading just the headline"" don't you think? Nintendo official statement was that the trailer just showed a selection of games representative of what you can do with the features but of the developers confirming games Bethesda actually hasn't yet. So yes it's possible that they release something more on par with the 360/Ps3 version and call it something different based on the mobile capabilities. Make the draw for this version mobility instead of graphic fidelity. Would still have a very healthy install base for that reason alone.

It is a technical impossibility for it to be on par with PS4 and X11 for cooling capabilities alone. Second, it is QUITE possible for.

There is 0% chance that this thing can perform like the X11/PS4 for the sheer reason of cooking alone. It looks like an awesome system for what it is. Think of it more as the reverse of the vita. It's not for taking your console to go it's for being able to play your portable games on your big screen too.

The processor is more or less an ARM which makes it actually more of a mobile processor than a console level one. Because destiny left last gen they wouldn't do this.

236,"no, thats not really fair. there are modes for everything. supremacy encourages/rewards/is built around close quarters combat. where shotguns shine. i would not equip a shotgun for combined arms on the giant maps, i would equip a good sniper rifle.

so therein lies one of the biggest problems with destiny right now:

their current map designs are SEVERELY bottlenecking to one specific playstyle. the combined arms giant maps obviously encourage sniping over other options, the new maps and most others encourage shotgunning. in BOTH map versions the special-weapon-of-choice for that map can meet or exceed the performance of your primary (which i agree is a problem)..

but bungie refuses to fix shotguns. they honestly did a lot of good with their sniper nerf. the new flinch mechanic is good. the change to what class of sniper rifle can end a super with strong armor stat is smart.

why are we still having shotguns that can snipe people at mid range? this from the developers who gave us the halo shotgun which is nearly perfect for how a shotgun should work: even in close range it required a shotgun shot + melee. still a remarkably quick time to kill, but also allowed for counterplay and gave the recipient and his teammates a fighting chance.

right now, if RNG blesses you and you get a Rifled Barrel + Rangefinder Matador or PC+1 you are killing too fast, too far in a game with a relatively high time to kill compared to games like CoD, Titanfall, etc.

dude, i went off topic. basically my point is: I agree. they need to fix shotguns so that ""the use of special weapons as primaries"" is alleviated a bit, but at the same time, on topic:

there are guns that are good for certain situations. for a game mode where you or a mate needs to physically be where the opponents body dropped to get credit for the kill, a sniper rifle is simply the wrong choice plain and simple. because either you are not getting your own crest or you are adding to the list of things your mates have to do to make it so that your contribution matters. in that way, a sniper is more of a weight to his team than someone using something else, no matter how good a sniper they are they would've been better moving with the team in close quarters combat.

that isn't to say you HAVE to shotgun either. high RoF auto rifles, pulse rifles (especially the new IB one!), TLW, shotguns, sidearms, these all work well inside the framework of Supremacy. they put you in the fray with your mates making team fire in the tight corners more likely, picking up crests easier, (maybe even more importantly) being there to *deny your opponents kills*.

in the end, its just better to not snipe in supremacy!

edit: damn. sorry for wall of text!",2016-10-06 20:14:40+00:00,d8gxc1a,6.0,t1_d8gv5jh,2666.0,DestinyTheGame
237,"Only if picked up dude. Which is back to my original point. You are more helpful when you are helping collect crests. Sniping from the backlines just means less time spent near teammates for team engages, less bodies actively collecting.

You do realize that if your sniper kill orb gets denied by an opponent you get no point credits, right? And that by you hanging back and not running with your squad you are playing against the meta and putting yourself and your team on an uphill climb right?

I don't care much if a team ""could win"" with snipers. The point is they win *in spite* of sniping, definitely not *because* they were sniping",2016-10-06 19:23:51+00:00,d8guu9p,4.0,t1_d8guipx,390.0,DestinyTheGame
238,"No, they're not bad but people who use them kind of are.

If you are a supremacy sniper you are pretty much entirely reliant on your team collecting for you. You don't help as there are fewer people pushing on for the crests your drop with your shots that means the group of 6 around that corner you can't see are waiting for the mates you left alone to go collect your kill

I'm sorry but as good as a sniper as you are or may be, snipers tilt the scale in favor of the enemy team. If I see a sniping team I praise my solo-queuing Stars that I get a free win as long as my team plays even halfway together.

You'll say ""I've seen teams that can win with snipers"" or ""I've been in teams and we won with snipers""

To that I'd respond: ""good work. That sniping team sounds like they are the top 1% of players and would've fucking mercy ruled the other team if they had played to smarter supremacy tactics and NOT sniped.""",2016-10-06 19:13:40+00:00,d8guc5v,2.0,t1_d8gt9mn,1301.0,DestinyTheGame

247,"&gt;Day 1 buyers of Destiny have paid $170 for the last 2 years of content, and that content has been absolutely anemic compared to the amount of content that MMOs deliver

you just made my point. destiny players paid $170. ONLY counting the release of legion (which i think there were actually 2 expansions in WoW in the last 2 years iirc, i don't play the game though.) 

WoW players have paid $420 in the last 2 years (60 for legion, $15x24 for the other months of those two years). why would destiny's content NOT be more anemic than theirs? i don't know much about modeling/etc but i have to think the art detail of destiny is a bit more involved than WoW as well. so yeah, i feel quite confident that bungie has done an excellent job keeping players around for THOUSANDS of hours for maybe a fraction of the content, but also a fraction of the price.

&gt;And no, they won't stop ""trying to make extra money because we're getting sad."" What they will do is change their practices to be more consumer-friendly if they realize that people will refuse to give them money otherwise, and that they could make more money by being less greedy.

written, seemingly, by someone who expects the world is full of butterflies and rainbows. please show me an example of that concept working exactly as you describe it. because whats more likely, as others have pointed out, that a community-wide boycott of these practices don't make them start giving us everything we want for free, they instead incentivize harder because it is an activision directive, not a bungie-led one, likely, and they care more about your money.

refusing to buy microtransactions they'll just make them more enticing. other users have put it more eloquently than i can, but the cost of operation in the realm of video game development is increasing. overhead costs for servers, scheduled maintenance etc. its not the same as it was in the past where they put the data on a cartridge and that was that.

295,"oh i see sorry for misunderstanding your initial argument. though, you were very precise to pinpoint one small point that was meant more as a joke than an actual statement point making a case for the necessity of a reboot.

my point was that the destiny that we have now is boiled down to an embarrassing repetitive grind where we do the same content over and over for another faction package, another set of armsday rolls all for a small expac that we burn through in a week and then complain about content draught.

everyone on this topic of destiny 2 is working strictly in hypotheticals. you actually have no source that says that even in the midst of a reboot and overhaul we don't still use our same guardians. the article certainly didn't say progression would be reset. it said its still ""being considered"", but there is nothing definitive yet. I'm saying in my original post that our guardians are tied to a destiny that is very different from the vision of what it should have been.

everything could be entirely fresh, or yes, it could be a lot of the same and we still grind faction rep but we restart at rank 0 except now it all works inside a framework that is more in line with the original vision for even how factions might have been supposed to work.

first off, i love your ""playing since alpha"" qualification. a large majority of us have, friend. myself included. i don't know that that alone necessarily gives you any authority or knowledge that any of the rest of us don't have. just saying. 

i think most reasonably tempered players would be fine with a reboot of the franchise including a character at level 1 and faction reps/whatever else at 0 as long as we kept our emblems, grim score, something to show hey, we have some seniority here, we seen and stepped in some shit before this. 

outside of that, since literally everything right now is conjecture, i suggest you ease off the gas a little bit there, warrior. ",2016-09-28 20:19:12+00:00,d85zm6k,5.0,t1_d85yp4g,1112.0,DestinyTheGame
296,"so you clearly are somebody wildly unfamiliar with the development woes of destiny then? no other explanation for that kind of cheekiness.

what we got as Destiny 1 was NOTHING like what the game was supposed to be in terms of storytelling, progression, exploration, etc.

there were drastic 11th hour changes that *crippled* the game we were supposed to get but there were deadlines that had to be met so we got a compromised product that wasn't what their vision for the game was in the first place.

so destiny 2 is being described as what the original pitches for destiny 1 sounded like. except this time they hope to have their team concrete enough to deliver that product. and hopefully they will. 

you can't see a wipe/reset like this happen once and start in with the ""THIS IS THEIR ONLY MOVE FOR THE REST OF TIME"" because its happened once, and even that is a rumor.

beyond that I'm confused how to respond to you because your comment is seemingly pretty ignorant to the actual rumored news... they are far from ""hard reset add new items problem solved"" they're changing how we explore/interact in areas almost making it sound like planets will be quasi-open-world spaces where we can hit a social space, get quests etc and walk out the front gate into the wilderness. kind of like how its done in the borderlands series, as well as developing a stronger more concise story.

if what you're complaining about is them building the stronger, more fleshed out destiny world they described 2 years ago and giving us that big of improvements? i say go for it.",2016-09-28 19:50:42+00:00,d85y73m,3.0,t1_d85xkuh,739.0,DestinyTheGame

have your sun singer who is not assigned to a cannon to pop radiance with a Heart of Praxic Fire or Starfire Protocol equipped and throw fusion grenades like crazy at the boss. his dps will still be quite high but each instance of Viking Funeral now adds 5% extra damage. this can stack 3x so that your warlock is giving you an extra 15% damage, your tether gives you damage, and your bubble gives you damage.

by the time you have heard a rumor of characters not coming over, the time has *passed* for you to think your voice can change anything.

you don't develop a game overnight. I'm sorry but destiny 2 is probably more than a year into its development and at that point has firmly established whether or not your character and gear will transfer. you won't change anything.

that being said, do you really want to be rank 1,236 with new monarchy (and still not have the ship btw) in destiny 3 or 4? no. that would be dumb af.

it would make more sense if destiny 2 started with some cataclysmic event that kills your guardian and separates you from your ghost and the world is ravaged. then your ghost finally finds you like 200 years later or something and resurrects you (perhaps you are disfigured and the ghost fixes you aka character creation) but they explain that you are *the* guardian from the first storyline.

350,"not at all actually. i love cosmetics and i spent $30 on radiant treasures to stock em up because i have extra disposable income and i can.

but if you **need** cosmetics so badly that you'll post this bitch/moan posts but you won't A) accept the fact that they give you a (albeit very slow) free way to get the stuff you want eventually or B) put in your money and get what you want, THOSE are the people who are just sad.

it either is or isn't important to you. if you don't think putting real money into it is worth it, then its not important to you. if you DO pony up, then it is. otherwise there is a free option available to those who want it, but don't want to pay. thats really the end of it. there isn't really an argument to be had here. its how most games are going. cosmetic/skin preferences fetch premium prices and game companies profit.

they're not a not-for-profit charity, of course they soil themselves at the thought of truckloads of money. good for them, i'm sure they're raking it in this week, again: good for them.

sony users aren't going to ""speak with their wallets"" against this because they benefit. so PS users pay for this and xbox doesn't. next time something like this becomes available, it will be like ""the company with the best exclusivity last time was the one that all the destiny players bought content on"" so then we will have it be microsoft who gets it next time.

back when playstation 2/xbox were the thing, there were some crossover multi-platform games but the two brands had more distinct flavors/offerings. if you liked certain things, you played xbox, if you liked these things you probably played ps2. with last gen and current get those differences barely exist at all.

now, even exclusives are just slightly different settings but similar concepts. almost every AAA game that really booms in popularity is a multi-platform game. so then both companies have to lock down exclusivity deals where they can to try to persuade you to purchase their console.

yeah, destiny is getting a year (or more in this fluke of a case) exclusivity on some crappy random pieces of gear. and that sucks. Microsoft got a year of exclusivity with Rise of the Tomb Raider, which sucked for me. its just the age of gaming we live in.

D2 was originally going to try to release this sept. until they delayed that by a long time.

likely you were supposed to get all that exclusive stuff along with d2 in ""fall 2016"" but now that has changed and you still get it with d2, but we all have to wait for d2 now.

its not that it doesn't suck, of course it does, but we don't know if there is a bigger reason for that content to have to be tied to d2, maybe there is.

also, for exclusivity stuff, are there any other PS games that have this extreme level of exclusivity? because i know the CoD exclusivity on ps matches what it was on microsoft. every deal is different and we don't know how much money Sony gave to bungie to help with development. if it was a substantial enough investment i can see them saying ""look, if we put this much in, and this game is going to be as big as you say, then we want if someone is 50/50 on console choice and wants to play destiny we want them to absolutely pick our console"".

because as other exclusivity deals go, i would never pick one console over another based on 30 days of exclusivity. but a year? that might do it for me...

we also have an entirely new race of enemy. while that may seem ""small"", its not. that is a lot of development time to implement new animations, models, mechanics for a new race of enemy.

625,"nope in consistency with my first point, this isn't a matter of we keep see-sawing back and forth. i don't think they handled the messenger right either. damage falloff needs to be a thing. the problem with the messenger was the kill potential combined with essentially no damage falloff. and if there was any it wasn't enough to change how many bursts were required to kill across map. instead of nerfing the entire damage of that class of pulse they should have played with damage drop off. the drop-off of damage should not be normalized across all pulses, ever, either.

my point remains that no gun should ever MISS due to rng. nobody likes rng, nobody. even if the damage is very small, every shot you take counts. 

tl;dr - play with damage drop-off distance/severity but *no more RNG bullet whiffs*",2016-08-03 15:08:51+00:00,d62jhkc,5.0,t1_d62j1uc,581.0,CruciblePlaybook

damage falloff is one thing, but missing entirely is unacceptable. none of the other guns miss 100% randomly (not including bloom) because they're outside range, they just do less damage.

669,"&gt; You don't decide what is harmless.

you're right, thats why we have rules that people adhere to. the stuff the ""troll"" said didn't violate any of them. he was being obnoxious and hyper but he didn't break any rules in what he said. if we let every single persons little sensitivities dictate what is and isn't allowed to be said in chat then SE would have to take out the chat window altogether, not gonna happen.

&gt; Op felt it was disruptive for him and is absolutely allowed to bail and find decent people

yes, but he did that in a way that violated ToS. what he *should* have done was if he personally just couldn't take another minute with that group and they rejected the vote, it was his responsibility then, if he still *had* to leave to eat the penalty for abandoning a duty. he could watch 30 minutes of YT at that point while his penalty ran out but he blackmailed the DF group to do it his way verbally admitting that he was going to intentionally AFK until they did.

the problem is not that OP was bothered, i get that. but again, we cannot police everything said in chat in an MMO. too many people have personal triggers, little things they can't deal with, sensitivity issues, etc. you can't police millions of people in a chat. perhaps OP should stop playing MMOs if he doesnt ever want to run into an annoying person. or if he does want to play MMOs never use party finder and always play with friends or premades.

ultimately, OP should have left the group, assumed the penalty because it was his own personal feelings that he couldn't handle that group anymore. not because they actually did anything wrong or violated any rules. instead he threatened them to do things his way or else. thats what my problem here is with op posting this",2016-07-20 19:37:13+00:00,d5jysnd,5.0,t1_d5jxkxu,1477.0,ffxiv

you're right that it isn't a job, etc but you're very wrong in supporting OPs actions. this isn't ""school"" but you are knowingly playing an online game with strangers, and they all have the ability to play the game how they want. its the nature of this kind of game. what that kid said did not break any rules whatsoever and it showed no sign of impeding progress through the content. for all we know he was plowing through his full rotations while making that ""joke"".

there is no reason to discuss instigator/catalyst etc. the OP did not like a harmless joke told by a party member, so he tried to dismiss the group (in a way that violates the written guidelines for what a dismissal should be). then when that failed because they didn't want to, and by the way they shouldn't HAVE to want to either because they too pay to play this game, then OP went and verbally confirmed that he would directly violate the ToS that he agreed to when he signed up to play this game and let his team deal with him being there AFK until they did something about it.

that is a direct violation of this kind of games ToS to admittingly going AFK.

there really is no defending OP in this situation. in fact 2 of the 3 premades both apologized for their friends ""psycho"" behavior. just a bunch of friends having fun in a dungeon. you cannot police what friends say with each other and with others when running dungeons, thats ridiculous. but again, OPs behavior is against the code of conduct that by playing this game he agreed to",2016-07-20 19:05:21+00:00,d5jx8fv,3.0,t1_d5jwmee,769.0,ffxiv

But the game isn't released and so on need to be part of the solution offering a better solution than just whining about it. Way it works is when you DC'd (happened to me because of lightning storms or whatever else) your character just stood still doing nothing and literally was afk. So when you came back regardless of coming back your character afk'd for some time.

Especially if you play ps4 the reboot time is long so that's a long afk. Should that be the case? No. BUT if it wasn't then there would be more people exploiting the system and that would ruin the game outright. If someone could pull the plug to appear ""DC'd"" but really they just rage quit but weren't penalized (because that's the only way for people like you to not be unfairly penalized) then almost every losing team would have at least 1 person do that - because there'd be no penalty

771,"for those bummed about his ""boring"" kit or the fact we have another vanilla fighter/tank there is something to remember about right now.

epic and paragon worked out this deal together to give paragon to ps+ subscribers. previously, epic had said the next character would be ""very exciting"" obviously thats not what we thought when we saw this guy (even though I'm very excited still). 

my thought is that they had a difference character in the pipeline, probably a female character since we haven't had any more of those yet, and she would be a more complex, ""expert"" difficulty hero that would have a very exciting kit.

however, with ps+ people being added yesterday its more likely that when they knew they'd be making that deal with sony they adjusted their release schedule to release an ""easy"" difficulty tank/fighter because the progression went:

New players ---&gt; hype teaser image ---&gt; video reveal ---&gt; hero release

in a matter of 6 days. so all these new players would be looking at this exciting cool video and all be trying to play a hero far out of their skill ranges.

Yes, you can maybe *sometimes* match a scout but the Mida is gonna get 3, even 4 shots off faster than you can get 3.

Comparisons against scouts aside, the hits to kill is awesome, the time to kill is not. With just slightly better aim you can use a Hawkmoon/eyasluna archetype handcannons. They also kill in 3 shots (2 head + 1 body) but can do so much faster. The next archetype below that (water star) can kill in 3 hits even faster with 3 headshots for the even steadier aim.

My point is, if TFC could 2-shot kill with 2 crits then it'd be op, but obviously used. 

It's just too slow and the range for a handcannon isn't worth the trade off in speed especially since TFC still does suffer even now from the damage fall off in last patch",2016-06-20 03:56:56+00:00,d4g87d2,1.0,t3_4owu0x,282.0,DestinyTheGame

920,"if i see another person who doesn't understand what a paywall/pay to win is I'm gonna laugh.

IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN.

the only people part of this discussion are people who are actively playing the game. a paywall refers to something that you have to pay for to get access to that you otherwise don't get.

THIS ISNT THAT.

you don't have to pay extra to get the IG, you just have to commit to the dlc. thats it. you pay the same price as someone who gets the dlc in december but because you said ""yeah I'm gonna buy it"" you get something for *free*.

if you weren't going to buy RoI because you don't care about destiny then i also don't care what your definition of a paywall is because you are not part of the conversation.

if you say ""yes I'm not buying RoI because i will just keep playing the TTK content but its not fair in crucible when i run into one"" bullshit. by that logic EVERYthing in RoI will be something you don't have.

on the developer side it pre-ordering is a huge help in terms of gauging your sales/interest/marketing success etc. 

have you ever participated in a test group or an experiment in university and been reimbursed like $20 for your time being there? its not completely different from that. your preorder gives them a confirmed sale, it gives them actionable figures they can look at when evaluating future marketing strategies, and in return they give you something free, as a bonus for committing early.

stop saying ""paywall"".

a ""paywall"" would be if Everis sells an exclusive exotic for silver only, only way to get it. that is a paywall, because beyond the price of a game you are locked out of getting it",2016-06-09 14:03:19+00:00,d42a06k,1.0,t3_4na8jr,12092.0,DestinyTheGame

You know that download size could include any number of things to make it larger right? The new patrol zone for instance is enough to add a considerable amount of data. That's likely why ttk was so big too, the dreadnaught.

That said, taken King expanded everything so much more than just a raid and a new patrol.

That being said I don't know anyone who is willing to almost double the price of Crota DLC to just get the same stuff from crota + another patrol area.

No, instead, since we've heard ""this dlc will be bigger than either of the 2 year 1 dlc"" then we can pretty reasonably assume that it is what those dlc were plus a bit more (the patrol) because everything else is constant between crota/HoW and this except for that patrol/social space:

• 1 raid

• 1 strike

• crucible maps

it *only* listed those two consoles but it didn't say ""exclusively on ps4 and xbox one"" it just listed them.

they could just not be putting effort into marketing for the old consoles because they want people to move to next gen so that when destiny 2 drops (presumably on next gen only) then everyone will be there.

it would be a very weird play to do an expansion as next gen only because the contact we have with those DLC experiences will exist simultaneously with what has already been established across console generations so it can't be that much of a leap forward without looking like a very awkward disconnect while at the same time, they can't increase the fps to 60 in dlc content only and then back to 30 in everything else, and they won't, surely, be upgrading our entire core game to go with this new DLC

You're right the stream seems odd just 4 days before but at the same time it doesn't make any business sense to reveal something on stream and then something different 4 days later because you're detracting from one thing or the other. If they show RoI on the 9th and then destiny 2 or something else at e3 no one will care as much about rise of iron because there's something even shinier

For that reason I really think the 9th and 13th will both reveal different facets of the same dlc. Maybe the stream focuses on the story and e3 on the raid? I could see the stream ending with ""... To find out what else is coming tune into the e3 stream"" or something.

planet destiny *has* proven that with hand cannons AA gives you phantom hitboxes that extend beyond the natural range of a head hitbox so it obviously works different with different weapons.

whether or not it HELPS is a different discussion because bolts being pulled to where an enemy was when they attach to the location may not be helpful when they have travel time (as in some bolts might get pulled to *behind* the opponent if they're running to the side and you're trying to lead them as it attaches to a location at a point and pulls in)

i can guarantee the infrastructure will be different (as or more powerful? so they say) but even if so, its a very different beast.

so not only would from software have a lot of work ahead of them, but nintendo would undoubtedly have to pay money to get from software to do this for them, and they are very unlikely to do that since the dark souls games do not fit the nintendo family of games at ALL. 

the few games that do come out that are dark/mature/gory on the system never do well, so i 100% doubt you will convince nintendo to A) bring a souls game to their family system, B) convince them that enough people will buy it to justify the cost required to do so and C) convince them to bring over the *third* entry in the series. taking the final part of a trilogy and porting it doesn't make any sense and them converting all 3 games to the NX is even less likely.

Player vs player should give the most, we'll call it 1.0x exp

Coop vs AI should give a little less because it's really not a challenge something like 0.8x exp

Solo vs AI should give something, albeit small, like 0.35 to 0.50 exp. that way you can still slowly earn card packs etc on your own while practicing.

Solo vs AI *used* to give exp and rep (a lot less than pvp) and only recently stopped and I think it was because there was no way for us to turn off the consumption of a paid boost.

So you'd buy boosts and then effectively be unable to play a bot match until you used up all your ""win"" boosts online because otherwise they'd be wasted on very low exp/rep games. It was stupid.

otherwise, those will all be available for ""slightly more"" (I'm guessing £30-£32) from their online store after release. 

the real reason to back is not for the add-ons, but for the stretch goals. because those are all *free* and will be available for separate purchase later for people who didn't pick up the game at time of kickstarter. THATS where the value is.

you don't save much preordering the add-ons. you save your money on the kickstarter. now that the invader pack is completed, the set is about $300 of value now for $110. 

so for $110 you are getting the game+stretch goal expansions.

basically, just ignore the add-ons for time being to understand the value:

to buy the **stretch goals** separately after release (because you miss the kickstarter) you will have to pay almost $200 for all the stuff that kickstarter participants are getting for free.",2016-05-12 17:28:31+00:00,d32xapq,6.0,t1_d32w63o,1463.0,darksouls

you are not talking about expansions. you are talking about **ADD ONS**. *those* are the things with the bosses you're talking about. and those are not ""bosses"" those are MEGA BOSSES.

the gameplay goes: Exploration --&gt; mini boss --&gt; Exploration --&gt; boss --&gt; Mega Boss (only if you buy an add on)

the BOSSES are absolutely included in stretch goals, mega bosses are not.

the **EXPANSIONS** are included in the stretch goals. look again here:

""Core Game Expansion"" and it includes the Pursuer ""boss"".

""Iron Keep Expansion"" includes the Smelter Demon ""boss"". 

both of those bosses are the same caliber of boss fight as the Dancer and Ornstein &amp; Smough. 

so you get the tiles, character minis, new cards, AND you get boss minis and yes they are to scale and yes they said they'd be big. you are very much underestimating how serious these stretch goals are.

So now they're at 150, fighting your lvl 110 ass and you're at a big disadvantage. So now you either have to stay disadvantaged or level yourself closer to 150.

150 isn't a switch they can just say ""you're right I'll just dial it back to 125"". Bloodborne made it so to be max power you need to farm a LONG time for blood gems.

the pvp covenants were better, the fact they have freaking arenas (that ACTUALLY WORK), the hit detection.

the notable exceptions being Dragonslayer Greataxe and Lightning Swordspear, other than those you're better off just going with a vanilla weapon. dark souls 2 balanced boss weapons as POWERFUL, but still fair.

They were a religious institution, gwyns family. So calling gwynevere sister doesn't make much sense since she wasn't technically a practicing religious figure like a nun.

because magic TECHNICALLY still has decent scaling up to 70. up to 40 is still better.

but the cap on str/dex after 40 is pretty fucking strict. so i still think 40/40 is best

best way to tell though is equip the item you're wondering about, go to rosaria to respec your character in cathedral of the deep and then play around with changing your stats. try 60/20, 40/40, 50/30 etc and see which is best because you can see the attack rating of your weapon on the right side of the respec window and then if you don't want to apply changes just cancel the respec and you're all good.

lets say we start at 0 and every level up to 40 is worth +2, and every level after 40 is worth +1.

at 60/20 we have +100/+40 (because you have 40*2 and then 20*1)

so its close, but its definitely worse. because those 20 points you didn't put into faith and put into int instead had less bang each level since you already hit one of the caps.

that being said, his helmet design is clearly designed to look like the same circle face-hole style. they also are clearly supposed to be ""humanoid"" too.

otherwise he looks eerily similar and his descriptions say: ""Yhorm is the descendant of an ancient conqueror"". in dark souls series we have few ""giants"" and ancient conqueror seems to be talking about the Giant Lord who fought against King Vendrick (likely what conqueror is referring to) and the timeline would make some sense then too since this obviously takes place *after* ds2 (items and descriptions of Hollowslayer Greatsword and the armor set)",2016-04-29 16:42:31+00:00,d2m9451,3.0,t1_d2m5j2x,4762.0,darksouls3

the main reason i think that happened is that you are talking about the one game in the entire soulsborne lineup that miyazaki did not direct. it wasn't his baby.

yes, it is ""canon"" and it is part of the universe and recognized as such, yhorm is obviously related to the giants from ds2, the petrified giant trees are there, lucatiel's gear is there, etc, it definitely ""existed"" but it was made by a separate team at from software while miyazaki was directing on Bloodborne.

so from that standpoint it makes sense that when he make dark souls 3 he stay true to HIS story, while still (very reasonably i might add, considering) incorporating some elements of dark souls 2 to say ""yes, that game was part of this direct universe"".

it was more a move of respect it seems like to me. because this is the continuation of *miyazaki's* dark souls and his (alleged) final foray into this universe he created so it makes sense that he ends his work on dark souls focusing on the lore and parts of the universe he was responsible for while just giving nods to the bits he didn't work on",2016-04-29 15:09:45+00:00,d2m4xzq,1.0,t3_4gzsaa,375.0,darksouls3

1178,"Right but I still say it has to be 120 because the faster you mentioned above will be worthless - it's not just about Attunement slots it's about the mana required to cast, you can't have 14 Attunement and use rings for the other slots because then you don't have room for a sage ring for speed, if you do that and Attunement spells then you don't have room for the rings that buff your attacks if you do those you don't have room for the ring that you need to lower your spell FP cost.

It's too much. So if it's at 100 then everyone will quickly look at it and say, ok, casting doesn't work at all at 100, a hybrid build is *""okay""* at 100 but the clear optimal build is ___ and everyone will use the same build to compete.

The sl meta in other games isn't arbitrary - it was chosen at a level where all builds become equally viable so as to have varied build options and at 100 that's impossible. Your character for instance is a great melee character with honestly poor casting power. I had a 40/25 dex int split when I started before respeccing after learning how scaling works, and it did SHIT damage. Like double digits damage with a +7 staff. Needs way more stat investment than I had.

You can't truly be finished in 80-90 range and max your stat, as well as give yourself enough vigor to not get wrecked. You may be a better than average player and be able to deal with lower than optimal stat break points but Still. I think it will NOT be 100 for the same reason it will Not be 250:

There won't be variation. You can NOT build even a poor caster at 100 and any level determination that doesn't allow other build types to participate won't be where the community lands. Sure, magic is a bit less viable in this game than others but the fact remains being a quality str or dex and dipping into the magic stats just means it will be mirror matches ALWAYS.

It will be 120 for sure so mages can participate. Magic in this game requires a LOT of investment. You need the mana/att slots, you need a lot of stat since it seems to cap around 60 and you get really big gains still from 50-60 and that's when you really see your power and even with those criteria met, you still need endurance because spells cost stamina and dexterity is needed so your spells don't take so long to cast (not sure how much you'd want).

look at dark souls 1, nearly every boss referenced another, visual easter eggs everywhere to reveal an area bosses character, their background, etc.

as is, muriel isn't any harder to kill than a steel or rampage building health and attack speed or honestly even just attack speed/crit. she absolutely needs a balance, but not in how her shields are scaled but maybe they can back off a bit of their effectiveness. a small nerf to their late game effectiveness and a slightly bigger nerf to the early game strength will go a long way to fixing her. who cares if she is a health/cdr shield support if the shields are a little less? yet it still allows her to tank, save, and shield as she is supposed to do.",2016-04-08 19:16:56+00:00,d1vauzd,3.0,t1_d1v999x,2103.0,paragon

first off, i think you're right to build feng mao tankier now but i have a few notes:

one, that life steal isn't really enough to make a big different but the biggest problem with your build is the 100% crit bonus. thats not actually possible in the game. since it is a ""Unique Passive"" you cannot have it twice. right now you're getting +50% from Blade of Agora and +50% from Hunger Maul but in the actual game it will be capped at +50% so one of those cards is a wasted card.

here is a deck i put together trying similar things:

it's a BIT more efficient.

in the end my build has +50 more physical than yours, more energy defense, more physical defense, capped crit bonus, higher crit chance, and 1,000 more hp than yours. trading off a bit of attack speed. if you're wanting to play ANY PART tank, that 1000 hp is HUGE. at least give this a shot. i was standing in the middle of some real ugly situations yesterday and just getting tickled.

build path:

&gt; adamant edge (3 strike, 1 strike, 2 strike)

&gt; brightsteel plate (3 wound, 3 wound, 4 celestial guard)

&gt; blade of agora (2 strike, 2 strike, 2 strike)

&gt; golden veil (2 barrier, 2 barrier, 3 wound)

&gt; adamant edge (2 strike, 2 strike, 2 health)

&gt; quartzblade (2 strike, 2 health, 3 health)

edit: also, if you don't end up needing both resistance types each game, you can sub in an attack speed weapon. for instance:

&gt; adamant edge (3 strike, 1 strike, 2 strike)

&gt; brightsteel plate (3 wound, 3 wound, 4 celestial guard)

&gt; blade of agora (2 strike, 2 strike, 2 strike)

&gt; redeye nitro (3 kinetic, 3 kinetic, 2 wound)

&gt; adamant edge (2 strike, 2 strike, 2 health)

&gt; quartzblade (2 strike, 2 health, 3 health)

that still gives you +1100 hp, 197 physical, 132 resistance, 44 crit chance, +50% bonus and still gives 52 attack speed. so thats closer to your build but still with a LOT more hp and damage",2016-04-07 15:55:27+00:00,d1tnv6u,1.0,t3_4dr3u1,7597.0,paragon

so at this point, on your next +3 points, sell your 9pt card and buy the same thing but don't with all (3) cost upgrades and now you're tied with the other guy.

so all things considered, you were ahead. because you were ahead in the early game and on the same level mid game.

the only trade off is those 4 extra deck slots you used to do this. but i think that seems fair since every build has a lot of deck wiggle room",2016-04-05 20:23:32+00:00,d1r66fb,1.0,t3_4di9t6,509.0,paragon

1303,"again though, you don't wanna compare him to those two. yes rampage can tank more damage/tower dive, and grux can get more kills, sevarog is more a combination of those two and muriel.

if you're a good sevarog your kda could look like 0/2/16 cause this dude is supposed to eat damage for the team, root, etc.

the other thing to remember on his passive is that you don't HAVE to get to 20/40/70/100 stacks to get benefit. you get benefit from every single minion you siphon. you just get a *bonus* at those checkpoints. if you don't believe me go use siphon on any jungle or lane minion at start of game, you get +3hp for every siphon kill even your first one.

if you manage to kill a hero with it counts as 3 stacks. 

basically what I'm saying is his passive is a neat trick, but you can completely wreck with him without ever stacking one stack. it doesn't give you an overall damage bonus, it only gives Siphon a damage bonus (which is awesome), but his overall effectiveness isn't dependent on that passive.

i prioritize sevarog because he has immense team-play capabilities that grux and rampage really don't have *as much* as. grux can pull an enemy, yes. rampage has a stun rock, yes. but sevarog has a really precise dash that can be used to sandwich enemies, a great root that holds them in place and THEN slows them, and a huge swing that, if flanking from the jungle, can knock opponents into your tower.

one particularly strong play i pulled yesterday was flanked a murdock, knocked him under our tower, then rooted him there so he ate 4 blasts from the tower and died.

sevarog is certainly good where he is but just requires a different mentality than when looking at him vs grux/rampage/feng because his role is different from them",2016-03-30 16:25:55+00:00,d1j804m,3.0,t1_d1j4lvs,4397.0,paragon
1304,"of course. heres the deck I built for him.

and you are right. early game you need to farm jungle and lanes if you can. so the first two items i build are pure physical. I do a Fountain Spike outfitted with all 2-cost Strikes, then an Adamant Edge with all 3-cost Major Strikes and use that power to farm jungle and minions until I get to 27 total card points.

at the 27 cp mark i sell both the Edge and Spike and replace them with a Lords Ward (Advanced Chrono, Advanced Chrono, Advanced Mana) and a Pendulum of the Lords (Advanced Chrono, Advanced Chrono, Greater Health).

After that I put in either of the 2 armor plates to match what the enemy team is using. usually doing two of the 2-costs and one of the 3-cost defenses (selling harvester key usually at this point).

for equipment #4 if the enemy team is split i MIGHT go with the other armor piece, but usually i can get away with not doing that and doing my second Pendulum of the Lords (Advanced Chrono, Greater Health, Advanced Chrono).

Finally, a fun piece of equipment I like is Drink the Spirits. passive that on kills *or* assists you heal for 5% of your max health and it gives health/mana bonuses. so i do that last, selling my health potion, and slot (greater health, 2-cost mana, 2-cost health). this usually doesn't happen, only in super long games that get to 60 card points.

i see people stacking physical attack damage on sevarog, thats wrong imo. he doesn't hit hard enough for that to be viable.even late game, stacked with cards, there are other characters that just do more than him in that regard. that being said, some of his spells are somewhat powerful even if you don't put ANY points into attack.

last night i was playing him focused on cooldown+mana with a secondary focus on armor+health.

most games i end up sitting on 3700 hp, 2 stacks of my siphon armor, and a good amount of kills/assists. he's still very tanky, has a good escape in his R1 after he's blocked for his team and with cooldown reduction and mana you can SPAM the hell out of your Siphon and it does a respectable amount of damage. in fact in one particularly late game i played, i think i had 44% cdr that build? i was able to cast siphon almost as fast as that slow auto attack, and it was chewing through them and the mana cost of that move is so negligible that popping a mana pot kept me almost capped while i did so.

hes not meant to really be a jungler in the sense that he's supposed to dish damage. the tanks we have now, steel, rampage, they are kinda dps/tank hybrids. you can build them tank and then still have them doing decent damage. sevarog feels more like a tank/support. his offensive abilities are a bit lacking but stacking cooldown so you have Root up almost all the time is HUGE for your team. coming out of the jungle and rooting, your team gets hits, they run, root them again. its great.

hes also really good being lane support with an adc early game where you can root them before they run back under tower and get early assists.

1310,"where other characters can use their abilities however they want feng mao has a bit of strategy to ""combos"" you can string together. He has both offensive and defensive stacks. You can have THREE stacks of one or the other (each stack is worth 4%, caps at 12%. used to be 10% and 30%.. this was part of todays nerf)

**STACK FOR DEFENSE**

&gt;SWEEP

&gt;This is his auto attack. For each hit he lands with this he generates a *defensive stack*. so hit with 3 auto attacks and you're at max defensive stacks.

&gt;HAMSTRING

&gt;This is the E (circle) ability that is in a circle and applies a slow. this ALSO generates a *defensive stack*

Once you have generated those defensive stacks you can pop your shield to make use of them! those defensive stacks make your Conversion Shield a more potent shield.... speaking of which:

**STACK FOR OFFENSE**

&gt; Your offensive stacks are not (i don't think) general offense stacks, but they JUST effect sweep, your auto attack.

&gt;CONVERSION SHIELD

&gt;This is the right click (R1) that gives you an over shield. For every hit you take while shielded you get 1 *offensive stack*

&gt;REAPING DASH

&gt;This is your teleport Q (square) attack. You get one *offensive* stack for using it.

-------------

so basically you should come in, do any combination of 2 auto attacks + hamstring, pop your shield while you keep auto attacking. minion hits on your shield count so having them around is a side bonus. keep auto attacking once the shield is up, if the opponent starts to run, teleport to them to make sweep even more powerful and keep up with the sweeps until they're dead.

his super still deals plenty of damage, they increased the base duration of it by 33%. yeah, they took away a lot of the strength but it now lasts 8 seconds instead of 6 early game which is actually pretty helpful.

not to mention the fact that smash and grab does more damage now too, and is a readied ability more often than your super.

he has more consistent, damaging neutral game now even though his super was nerfed.

also, his health gain is more than fair. compare what it *was* (most games getting 800-1000+ hp by mid/late) to someone like steel: 15% cc reduction, or rampage, a bit more regen in jungles, etc. it is in line now with the other heroes. if left as it was, he would have a passive that is MUCH greater than the actual triggered ability of sevarog. He has to actually use one specific move on minions, with a 6 second base cooldown, and that specific move has to deliver the killing blow, to get only 3hp per minion. much harder to pull off than the wide cleaving of *any* of grux's attacks to achieve greater effect.

it *seems* much harsher because we had seen him in his previous state. but objectively compared to the other heroes, he's in a much more balanced place now. play with him a while before solidifying your opinion.

you ever seen a grux dive a core and activate super? bruh... like 85% of core can be destroyed by him alone during the time his super is active. 

it seems ""knee jerky"" because he was too strong before.

as for the passive health gain, think about it: sevarog just came out and also gets +3 hp per kill (still less than grux's was) and his requires you to use a specific ability to do so, with a cooldown, and not much damage dealt. theres no way crux's *passive* should surpass an ability you have to actually do specific work for on sevarog",2016-03-29 15:47:01+00:00,d1hs7gb,2.0,t1_d1hpbbk,3862.0,paragon

grux's changes were a bit more brutal. but thats only because it was a mistake for him to be as strong as he WAS. he is in a very fair place now in terms of his passive. although his super DID get nerfed a little too hard. ",2016-03-29 15:36:46+00:00,d1hrq9x,1.0,t3_4cfxwb,260.0,paragon

1) if his passive had started off stating 2hp/kill up to a max of +200 free hp, and i never knew about how it used to be i would probably say ""oh ok thats neat. a free 2 cost card just for playing into the mid/late game"". it's because we know how strong it used to be that we feel like its a knee jerk.

his passive now feels more in line with an ability like steel's -15% CC. its not godly, but its something. thats kinda what a passive should be. dekkers slight team mana regen etc.

his passive could not remain as strong as it was because sevarog now achieves the same thing, permanent stacking hp buffs , however, with sevarog, there is no one-shot sweeping cleave, it requires a specific move to be executed, not just auto attacks, and even then you only get stacks at 20-kill intervals. grux's PASSIVE would have been worlds better than stacks that have to be laboriously built using one specific method with sevarog, it had to change.

i think the feng mao changes are very reasonable though (even biased because he's my main). so i still trust their method of slight adjustments.

A) not surprising 

And 

B) still awesome

If you told me ""every hero at rank 10 unlocks a gilded gold recolor"" I'd be like cool that makes sense you can only get a gold hero at rank 10. Now we have where it's not ""gold"" but it's the paragon equivalent... I'm not seeing the issue really? For the money to get the pack you get a taunt, and a flashy skin that shows off your commitment.

Couple other random notes:

You don't have to race/no-life it to be world first Gideon. I imagine most players will have several master skins someday.

Most important... You don't have to buy these. You can unlock them QUITE easily just by playing. By the time you reach rank 10 (which you can still do without buying the pack) you will definitely have made a fucking shitload more than 73,000 reputation so then you just use that and get the skin for free

Seriously epic has been more than fair so far. Free game, free characters every 3 weeks, a fun game, beautiful graphics (which isn't easy), I don't expect them to put all the man hours down that they have to to do a brand new costume for each character when you can get those for free too.

Now if everything they try to sell for real money only is also colors then we can talk but I bet the stuff that is real money only purchases will be more unique",2016-03-22 23:03:32+00:00,d19rrpk,1.0,t3_4bjg4f,6475.0,paragon

no arguments just a few notes/questions:

• have you checked out gideon today after the patch? i haven't had a chance to yet, but apparently minions now will move out of aoe circles which is going to make him, imo, one of the worse add clearing casters because meteor does little damage multiple times i feel like depending on how they did the whole ""avoid aoe"" thing on minions there could be a scenario where he can no longer wipe the waves and needs to meteor twice which would *suck*

i agree with all your comments about Feng being the biggest problem. Kallari and Grux are fine as is. like you said, grux is strong with ultimate but his damage otherwise seems fair and his limited range/mobility options balance that even further. 

kallari, too, plays how i feel she should. immense damage from her super and a good ranged but other than that she needs to get the hell out of there because she's squishy as hell. if you play smart around her invisibility and keep track of where she could be she's not a HUGE problem...

but feng mao is a real problem. the damage of kallari's super, a self shield, a tankier body by default, and auto attacks that hit like specials. our Feng player  wants to pretend his 22-0 score is because he's good, but he can't do that with any other character. he's definitely trend a *little* too strong at least.",2016-03-22 15:56:05+00:00,d198wf2,1.0,t3_4bhpv4,3655.0,paragon

i would say you're right, reduce very early game dmg but more importantly is tune his autos to be more fair. i understand he has a stacking mechanic for his autos but they're just too great.

point OP was making is that he and kallari do similar super damage, but Feng also has large, sweeping melee hits that are still *very* powerful even without super up, has a very effective self shield and is already built tankier than kallari by default. he shouldn't do as much dmg as kallari if he is going to have all those other benefits. so Epic has a lot of options with how to balance him but one thing is for sure: he needs to be",2016-03-22 15:50:45+00:00,d198niz,2.0,t1_d1980sr,831.0,paragon

Master Challenges will cost real world money. there is a master challenge for every character. it unlocks a Challenger skin right away (just a cool recoloring of standard skin) and gives an xp boost to all characters permanently, and at rank 10 gives you a Master skin that you can only get if you paid the real world money for that character.

1470,"""at a very dangerous point in its game life""?

how long have you been an industry expert? or are you accredited because you are younger than 25 and own a home console so therefore you are ""that kind"" of expert?

a game company does not have to have complete transparency for their title to remain successful and there are a lot of factors at play that our ""endearing"" entitled community doesn't even consider. they have had some pretty high level personnel changes occur in your timeframe that certainly will change some of the timelines. we've already seen that the ""tentative"" release window for destiny 2 had to move, i think its reasonably fair to assume there is some degree of restructuring happening.

the game was a HUGE commercial success but at launch and following launch with each expansion, reaching huge numbers for the first release in a new series. activision will be putting a lot of weight behind destiny both now and future and they have business people who are a great deal wiser than you or most people on this subreddit planning years ahead of what we see right now.

is the communication ideal? no. but the game is going to be fine. the instal base was huge, and the amount of salty whining going on is not a sign of people who have given up but junkies who are literally going through an excruciating withdrawal and they want a fix.

destiny is not the same as the division, i guess that needs to be said again and again.  you shoot stuff and get loot, but its not the same. there is no ""real"" pvp in division, the dark zone is fun but there are no matchmade teams, no competitive modes like trials or IB and no good ol hectic team deathmatch or control, so you already have a victory for destiny there with the guys who like some competitive FPS action, then you have the fact that the division is essentially a glorified Destiny patrol planet turned into a game. sure, the loot system is hefty, but even the missions themselves are no more deep than planetary patrol missions, just a little longer. there are also ""hard missions"" but nothing quite like a raid. even the setting is very played out and tired. destiny didn't do a great job developing it's lore, but the basis is there for a very strong future in an unknown universe. post pandemic american city? how many thousands of times has that been done? it's a fun game, will hold peoples attention for a while, then when the next big destiny update comes out, almost EVERY SINGLE destiny fan will come back, frothing at the mouth. likely to pick up even more players too.

someone in another thread pointed out Star Wars Battlefront, *THAT* is a game in trouble, that is a game who's disappointments outweighed the good and its install base is falling away, destiny is fine. its a game a year and half old, of course some of the original people will have moved on to the other great games out there, but new content and they'll be back immediately.

so my point being the exotics exist in concept and maybe even exist in a test build somewhere but they're probably being delayed while the perks are balanced/looked at.

conversely, it could just be a disappointing tactic to drip feed exotics to people to keep them coming back, even though when i gave them my money for taking king it was under the promise of ""TTK includes X number of new exotics"" and then the game actually released and only contained less than half of that number!",2016-03-09 18:49:27+00:00,d0to51a,6.0,t1_d0tlyv0,2902.0,DestinyTheGame

they will not release an exotic weapon that essentially undoes the balancing changes made to an ability bringing it back nearly to its former glory (and depending on the blink distance part, maybe even better). they wouldn't release sunbreaker helmet that gives them their golden-gun surviving super armor back for the same reason

the 2.0 nerf for blink included 2 changes:

• Blink movement ability activation delay increased by 0.07 seconds (0.26 seconds to 0.33 seconds)

• Blink movement ability visuals now changed to better telegraphing direction: clearer activation FX and trail FX

so the exotic would negate the only actual nerf there, decreasing the cooldown time, and then *adding* a further blink distance

that exotic will not be released with those perks. the model will still be released, but the perks will be different, just as they did with the Ram helmet (when datamined the ram originally had the self res blinding exotic perk that would later be the Purifier Robe exotic perk) ",2016-03-09 17:27:08+00:00,d0tkg0j,4.0,t1_d0tj58j,1762.0,DestinyTheGame

wouldn't you agree a big chunk of money is better than no big chunk of money? so even if that income source dries up, which it won't because people in an MMO will always pay for new aesthetic pieces, they wouldn't then immediately move on to selling exotics.

it comes down to: they won't have to move to anything else because people WONT stop buying things for silver because new shaders, dances, sparrows, aesthetics we haven't even explored yet, they'll always be a thing, and people will always pay to look like a special snowflake, myself included, they would never have to resort to anything else and the beauty is if you don't like it, don't buy it. the only thing my hotline bling dance does is let you know that you just got bootycalled when i snipe yo'ass.",2016-02-24 21:03:22+00:00,d0ceymb,1.0,t3_47eosa,2044.0,DestinyTheGame

say what you will about the action gameplay, setting, whatever. but their approach to minimal HUD design was huge. i actually really liked not have the currently equipped weapons displayed in the bottom left. i was smart enough to figure out what i had equipped at any one time and it left that much extra space for unimpeded visuals/immersion.

the sound was amazing, rivaled only, possible, by Demon's Souls. Latria in Demon's Souls is an example of exemplary sound design. I still remember being frozen in my steps because the bell chimes of the enemies and the extremely distant cries of a locked up prisoner was just terrifying.

health bar design i say goes to bloodborne because of a couple things, it was very easy to see the health remaining, it was VERY minimal, the smallest health/stamina bars we've seen so far. yet at the same time was very stylized and actually looks like design effort was put into it. it matched the games visuals.

Dark souls 2 is a close second because it, too, had a specifically designed look to it, but it was FAR too big. especially high vitality builds, that bar just got too big.

but yeah, its clear the stalker is different from us, yet Hunhow says we were alike. that makes me think he was a child like us, now matured and fully developed in his suit. if we can do what we do using only a Somatic Link, imagine what we could do if our legs worked and our bodies were matured and we were physically in the suit?? i mean, activating our Focus ability to appear, without the cover of our frame, and melt everything with an energy beam that just shoots out of our body seems powerful. maybe the stalker was one of these Tenno children that was never put in stasis, continued to grow and inhabits his suit always. could also be why we never kill him and he always retreats at 10% health. he doesn't have ""revives"" like we do because if he died, we just killed his actual self.

ill paste some of the Ordis dialogue from the limbo quest I've been referencing, he makes a pretty strong case for limbo being an actual sentient being, not controlled by the mind of someone (at least thats how it sounds to me)

Operator, I think I know why we're finding Limbo parts scattered throughout the system. His final rift walk was a miscal... disaster. Well, perhaps when you occupy his frame, you will use more... caution.""

logistically speaking, this neuro-link style of control though, whether you like the ""kid"" angle or not, does make more sense than me having enormous Saryn breasts, and then immediately gender swapping into the massive bulge of Nezha then back to Mirage then Rhino.

I've been working through the limbo quest and Ordis keeps talking about him like he existed as his own entity. He tried experiments, failed, and his body was torn apart and spread around the galaxy so now we find his components, rebuild him and can take control of his frame.

So was he what the stalker is? A being that is of himself? Maybe if the stalker ever does fully die his frame would be available to us like limbo and the other frames? I dunno. Noob thoughts.

On the other front, I quite like the operator angle. Sure, we could have been in the suits and that would've been fine but it also would have been done before. Maybe not space ninjas per-se, but some overpowered action hero ripping his way through waves of enemies. This is a very surprising twist that I liked DE took a risk on.

https://www.mugenmonkey.com/bloodborne/9461

with 50/50, your spells will be powerful, but not maximized. Call Beyond will be more or less a waste of bullets because that spell wants to be at 70+ arcane to start really benefiting. but your other spells will be powerful. at 50 arc, Darksky Eye hits for about 240 in pvp, which isn't bad for 1 bullet.

the church pick, at 50 arcane, with two ARC scaling gems and one 27.2% triangle gem can have an AR of 575 which is quite high considering both that it will be pure magic damage as well as how fast that weapon is! the best part is that with how they fixed scaling gems, at 50 arcane and that same setup (2 scaling gems + 1 percentage gem) you can pretty much use those weapons at full capacity, assuming that the weapon has at least a C arcane scaling.

the 50 bloodtinge also allows you to fully utilize the transformed bloodletter as well! if you bring the skill up to 15 you can use simons bow in bow form. 

lots of fun options!

1667,"then don't wield the bowblade or the chikage! the chikage self-damages, and you will be forced to stay in that mode because the skill side of that sword will do nothing for you, same with the bowblade. the blade part will be like a soggy noodle without any skill, so it will only serve as a bow, which is defeating. 

with the Kos Parasite you get access to a good, far reaching weapon, no compromise to its maximum power and a GREATLY powerful crowd clearing move with the L2. between that and the bloodletter, you don't need anything else. i also don't think you need more than 45 vit (what i always use, and do fine with), and 15 endurance (both kos and bloodletter are plenty forgiving in terms of endurance usage, and your hunter tools require none).

and yes, i know about spells, but in fact 70 is the *soft* cap. 99 is the hard cap for skills.

you also don't need them to hit like trucks, your L2 on your parasite will, the parasite itself will, the bloodletter will hit like a bullet train, and so will the evelyn if you need bullets. 

what arcane gives you access to is 1) novelty, cause let's be honest, we all want to be successful with a build that is outside of being cookie-cutter... and 2) some strategic tools. the Accursed Brew can be great for catching an opponent, unlocked. the executioners glove puts good pressure on them to then chase them down with the bloodletters rolling attacks. and I've found beast roar to be a fantastic set up to the parasite's L2 explosion because as they get up they HAVE to roll away, and the hits are too rapid to escape them all, its quite good. not to mention Darksky Eye will still do a lot of damage at 50 arc

this is the build id suggest trying if it were me, in fact, i think i may! haha:

so its not full 50/50 but: https://www.mugenmonkey.com/bloodborne/8950

at 45 vit and 15 end you still have over 1800 hp and 120 stamina respectively

your bloodletter will have an attack strength of: 693

kos parasite will have as high as: 445 (depending on how masochistic you want to farm) or a more realistic: 375",2015-12-03 16:37:37+00:00,cxlsbdc,4.0,t1_cxlrst0,757.0,bloodborne

Evelyn, one of the best guns in the game

1672,"well, partly i think a majority of their animations are imaginative and don't need the same motion capture that most games do. like in a game like Last of Us or something, Joel needs to move like a human, so a lot of intensive motion capture tech needs to be used with a lot of time to tune the details. but in bloodborne the enemies, and even the ""human"" character, are very ""caricature-esque"" and they can get away with interpreting their own animations. a lot of the animations are very exaggerated and clearly not from motion capturing a real person (the dodge roll is quite extravagant... if that was from a mocap suit i am impressed!)

i also think it could be because they are editing and repurposing animations from their past games... a little editing and the dodge roll from demon's souls could be used for the dodge roll here, but on that, I'm just completely guessing.

but really, i believe its because they are actually artists. that's what clearly sets these games apart. from enemy design, npc design, character animations, level/locale design, the lore...

there is no question something about the From games are different from anything else released. for them it truly is a labor of love. they are actual artists. not that games aren't art if made by other studios, but where another studio might make a game that looks pretty and is fun to play, their goal is more or less ""make an accessible and fun game that looks good"" but From Software seems to want to do something more, its almost philosophical. their lore touches on some heavy subjects, their enemy designs are very cerebral and intentional. if you see something truly horrendous, it often times serves a metaphorical purpose rather than just ""gross for gross sake"".

1791,"debbie downer? why? I'm excited about the fact that we don't have numbered releases. those change the perception of the experience too much sometimes and canpush players out of joining in at certain points if they didn't pick up the first couple iterations. like if it's billed as an rpg, i would feel way less comfortable jumping in at the 3rd or 4th installment because of the seemingly daunting lead everyone else has on me. conversely, i feel like at any point (never got into WoW, more into some other mmo's) because their expansions aren't numbered and they're just more extensions of an already existing game, i can jump in at any point and be given the tools i need to immediately catch up.

it could be that instead of destiny 1, 2, 3, 4, we have these major retail expansions, like taken king was (and who knows, if they did intend to keep their original release schedule and had to fit taken king in earlier maybe future ones could be even bigger, would be cool!). theres not really final fantasy xiv and then Final Fantasy XIV 2 but that game has gotten a ""second"" game in Heavenward expansion. thats how mmo's release their sequels until the next full iteration of the game comes out.

even though destiny says it isn't an mmo, and people say it isn't, it really does have a lot of those similarities. raid loot lockouts, weekly quests with lockouts, daily resetting quests/tasks with rewards, micro transactions for aesthetics, dlc's that add maps for multiplayer/dungeons/loot, even the 10 year model is very mmo-like in scale. it is like a free to play mmo, and the expansion approach would work really well especially with items like that light level boost where a new player can say ""i can start now, hit level cap by the weekend and then be in it!"" 

not a debbie downer at all because i LIKE that approach! Heavensward was very much ""Final Fantasy XIV 2"" without being called that and thats what I'm suggesting could be the case with destiny.

tl;dr - definitely don't want people to see me as ragging on destiny or the model I'm suggesting could be what we're seeing because i LIKE the idea of the mmo structure and moving away from the console player specific viewpoint of ""it has to have a number after it"".

i actually honestly think KF is the best raid so far.

they pulled that off in addition to having CE come out. while it was imperfect, it was still a good diversion of time and kept people in destiny longer. and they still managed to have the time to get KF designed/done for the sept release so i think they could do that again. a medium sized raid (even if its designed by the B-team) while still working on the Destiny 2 raid

it would be the biggest mistake in the games lifetime so far to not release a raid soon, even if its not as big/good as vog/kf because there are so many other options they will just lose people to those games for good. 

i think we will see one raid dlc and one dlc similar to HoW and honestly i think thats what the cabal one will be, just personal speculation. but once more, i don't think activision is dumb, and even if they have to hire more people to get both raids done (dlc one and destiny 2 one) i think they will because giving people a reason to come back is imperative if you want your game to be a 10 year game.

sure, doing this body shot, switch, primary shot, strategy will get you a one hit kill 25% of the time, the other 75% of the time you are just strictly worse than a good sniper player with a normal sniper rifle.

this is how any endgame is a game that has mmo similarities.

you don't need to be over 300 light for any content other than the raid, so why would it matter? also, there isn't a raiding mmo or game worth time that doesn't lock its best gear behind the raid or whatever the highest end game stuff is.

if you're 300 there literally isn't content you can't do. you can do all the strikes, the nightfalls, the dailies, even when light level enabled crucible comes around you are at a light level at 300 that is almost indistinguishable between you and a 320 (which by the way isn't even possible right now anyway).

on top of all that, you actually don't have to raid, as running trials of osiris can give 310-320 light drops as well so if you like crucible then that is an option as well. the lighthouse chest guarantees a primary of 310-320 light with a chance at dropping 310-320 exotics and legendary armor pieces.

not good enough to get to the lighthouse? the silver package is easy to get even when losing, and i got a 318 Alchemist Raiment out of that.

tl;dr - don't play a game with loot and and an end-game if you don't like the model. bungie didn't create this model, its very commonplace. you don't need to be 300+ anyway unless you are wanting to be cutting edge for whatever next challenge they release. next time light level increases 310 will probably be the LL for mission rewards anyway. just decide if you're a hardcore destiny player (keep raid grinding), or if you're just a casual player (stop at 300 and enjoy all the other content)",2015-11-09 15:55:48+00:00,cwu5q3o,1.0,t3_3s54e6,1847.0,DestinyTheGame

that number represents the direction of the recoil with 100 being pure/perfect vertical recoil, and the lower the number the more horizontal the recoil direction is. so in that category, RS has the definite advantage and that, imo, is what makes the gun even remotely considerable for replacing the NM in some peoples hands. a more vertical kick is easier for some people to control than horizontal.

also, my RS rolled with hidden hand, bringing my AA to ~69. so with the higher AA and the vertical recoil pattern i find hitting very far distances with full precision bursts much easier, which compliments my shotgun in CQC that much more

1861,"1) as i said to the other person, it *shouldnt* be part of the discussion as in it doesn't have anything to do with the design/philosophy of how coin acquisition is set up. it absolutely needs to be addressed/fixed, but once that fix is in place they can leave the rest the same. 

2) i was going off experience (i hadn't yet seen anyone get 1 coin before so i wasn't even aware that could happen).

3) all our resets (about 1-2 passages per character that went mercury), when we got to a red bubble we took the next two rounds less seriously and just played experimentally/for fun. we didn't go try-hard, we experimented with new strategies, new routes, new weapons, not caring if we got the other 2 losses because we'd be recouping coins. ended up losing (while not ""intentionally"", definitely easier targets than we would have been) and resetting our cards. that style of play isn't for everyone, and for those people exists the option to hard reset at the cost of coins. should coins drop from wins as well on rare occasion? yes. i think a win *could* net you 1 coin and be fair. but then it trivializes boons.

maybe the ultimate design is that they don't want you to have all 3 active every card. because at the point that they just start showering you with all the coins you'd ever need then they may as well just build the boons into the card by default. what would be the point? if they're always providing you, for free, with all the coins you could want without any work, why don't they just take away boons altogether and make the lighthouse goal:

and because of that there would likely be situations where people are selling their services, or volunteering or whatever, to do this:

3 players start up the match and get paired with a team that is only 1 win into their card, or even better, 0-2 on their card. 2 of the players leave during the flight in from orbit and switch to their characters that are at 7-0. keep doing that until you get to lighthouse, playing awful teams, then the ones that got to lighthouse switch and get the 0-2 his character through. 

unfortunately, this is an online game and there is always the dirtbag community ruining good potential features for everyone else. its not bungies fault as much as its their fault. ",2015-11-02 15:32:27+00:00,cwlnga4,1.0,t3_3r4rek,63075.0,DestinyTheGame

[Warpriest](https://www.bungie.net/en/Armory/Detail?type=item&amp;item=2372257456&amp;itemname=Worm%20Gods%27%20Servant)

[Golgoroth](https://www.bungie.net/en/Armory/Detail?type=item&amp;item=2372257459&amp;itemname=Devourer%20of%20Light)

and [Oryx](https://www.bungie.net/en/Armory/Detail?type=item&amp;item=2372257463&amp;itemname=Of%20Light%20and%20Hunger)

i assume there will be other rewards on top of the emblems, like #48-#50 calcified fragment containing more story about each of those bosses, which will likely unlock whatever the hard mode exotic is (be it something unseen by anyone and maybe the twist surprise that luke smith is so ""excited about"", or Touch 2.0). either way, i will be trying to get to 320 for whenever those are unlocked/discovered

btw, the current working theory is maybe killing war priest either in 1 pass (would be very hard under 320) without him devouring ANY pylons.  - OR - killing him in 2 passes but splitting up 2 players to each tower so that it eats all 3 of them on the first oversoul, giving him all 3 powers at once.",2015-10-26 15:32:29+00:00,cwdflxk,5.0,t1_cwdavhl,8656.0,DestinyTheGame

1913,"Ok so i think there is plenty hidden behind 320.

Hard mode challenges are in the game sometime (you can see the emblems in the kiosk) for the raid bosses. There are 3 of them. They will probably require very tricky methods of doing things like killing golgoroth in one turn with never losing gaze (meaning killed in one pass of 6 alternating bubbles) 

Killing warpriest before he devours any of the pylons.

Whatever they are, they likely won't be completeable at level 310, 320 will be almost surely required.

Since there are 3 the speculation is that those are also our remaining 3 calcified fragments, which gets us to 50/50 and could unlock another old hunger quest (since there's also a shader tied to the completion of that that hasn't unlocked yet). Maybe this upgrades our touch of malice to 330 or something else.

While it's all speculation, bungie hasn't made the mistake yet of truly making a level cap useless yet and I doubt they started now.

1935,"my point was if you have to have a reason to not buy the emotes, there are numerous others you could go with; not liking microtransactions in general, not liking destiny, not liking bungie. 

but the thing is your fear IS validated. future releases likely *will* have more ps exclusives. but bungie is not going to say ""well, xbox users didn't spend money on the emotes so we're going to release everything we were going to release but without the ps exclusives""

no, if they are still under contract with sony than more likely it would be: ""we didn't make enough money to release a full-sized DLC to everyone like we hoped so instead we are going to release more bite sized dlc. here is a new strike and 2 new crucible maps for everyone, for ps users here is an exotic gun and an extra strike for you still""

what my point was that the contractual obligation to give sony players exclusives exists with or without your microtrans money. you holding back on purchasing **for that reason alone** just serves to hurt the xbox community more likely, and if not that, than bungie.

i hope I've made sense, typing at work and unsure if I'm conveying my point properly... the PS exclusives are contractually bound. 

so if you're going to not buy emotes, fine, but don't do it for the stated reason. if you like destiny and bungie, support them and buy some emotes, likely the dlc will only get bigger and better the more cash flow these transactions generate

tl;dr - holding back money won't stop exclusives. in the very worst case, bungie will release a PS exclusive dlc pack altogether. because one way or another, they're getting exclusives because of a contract deal, regardless of how hard xbox users strike.

edit: more micro trans money = bigger/better/more dlc most likely. if you like the content you've been playing then don't boycott it! support it! like it or not, sony will likely continue to get their exclusive stuff, not contingent on how much $$ they make",2015-10-22 19:31:02+00:00,cw9741p,3.0,t1_cw96nln,641.0,DestinyTheGame

all i know is, you're going to refuse supporting their new payment model based off one weapon and one strike (if the same as last time), and in doing so not support the full release.

think about Crota's End. ps members got 4th horseman first (big whoop), as well as a strike that people didn't even like that much.  but *everyone* got a raid, and new raid armor, raid weapons, crucible maps, crucible playlists, storyline, etc. 

same with HoW. granted, PoE was not at all as good as a raid, that DLC saw some dumb ps exclusives, but gave everyone the queen's weapons, skolas, *trials of osiris!*, good characters, fun content.

so if you want to not support bungie in their micro transactions because you don't like destiny, then fine, make that what your post is about. but if you're going to jeopardize the scale of the communities DLC, or try to create a movement of people who think like you, why? because of one gun and a strike that you get eventually?",2015-10-22 16:47:11+00:00,cw9092x,1.0,t3_3ps9d8,4172.0,DestinyTheGame

1955,"So someone who has First Curse.... here is what i think they should do to improve it:

Leave all perks as they are, but add this to the ""First Curse"" proc:

&gt; **The First Curse**:

&gt; Precision kills while aiming down sights grant increased range, stability, and precision damage until the next reload.

i've heard people say that it seems ""overpowered"" but i don't think it would be. it would be just as good as Crowd Control on a gun of this archetype. someone posted a video of a Judith-D (hakke gun in same damage class) with crowd control and it was very good but not unfair.

if this gun had to spend 3 bullets to get a kill, then only could 2 shot the next two opponents (and even then only skilled enough to get headshots), and then would have to reload the remaining odd bullet, it would still suffer from the limited range, the slower reload time, and the odd missed bullet. it would make the gun fun and challenging to use, worth the time investment, and the exotic slot.

1957,"it, statistically, is ""worse"" than other hand cannon archetypes.

there is really no way to 2-shot with this gun, it does 95 per headshot only at the closest of ranges, the drop off happens quickly. so it will almost always take 3 shots to kill, but at the lowest fire rate. granted, 2 body shots + 1 headshot is enough to do it, but still contending with a slow RoF.

guns like the Ace of Spades, Hawkmoon, Fatebringer, Fulcrum, Revelator, Byronic Hero, etc are the next archetype down, these are in a much better place. they still require 3 shots to kill but the do it faster. so statistically speaking, they are a vast improvement. add to this the fact that with the lucky bullets the hawkmoon can 2 shot people, and there is no chance that the First Curse can beat it.

The First Curse needs a huge buff, either in terms of making it a scout rifle range almost, or buffing damage after the first headshot kill so that it can 2-shot the next opponent following the skill proc.

You clearly have never coded *or* worked on a test team. While my coding experience is quite limited I was a game tester for several years part time. The way this bug is achieved would not have been found in most cases in game play testing. IF on the off chance someone were to think to try to quickly perform part of the super, enter menu and come back out mid super, they may have done so not wearing the GF helmet, again, the chances pre-release testing would find this in any game is minuscule at best.

If you had any code experience though you wouldn't have said something so narrow minded. The bug couldn't be allowed to exist another day. It was ridiculous and game breaking. Crucible was a joke. There is a lot of things to consider when looking at what about  relationship between that helmet and the super needs to change and what ripple effects that change could cause. Fixing something like that, depending what the relationship between those two items is, could take more time than would be appropriate for them to leave the bug in game. 

If you remember the nail perk on black hammer was the same way and the perk had to be entirely disabled while they looked at and considered a fix and the collateral effects of that fix

2217,"Here are my thoughts, I'm slightly biased because this is my favorite weapon. But i see so many people using it incorrectly.

the final bullet is not a little bonus damage, it is *DOUBLE* damage. thats substantial. i see so many people using the auto-fire for the first 10 bullets and then continuing to auto fire on the final bullet, this is wrong. while that is definitely the fastest dps you can dish out, it isn't the most efficient way to do it because any missed bullets from a gun with moderate recoil like this one is going to be a lot of quickly spent life for nothing.

the first 10 bullets should be fired in quick succession and then the final bullet should be used as a precision-prioritized single trigger pulls. you can pull off ridiculous damage this way. the gun is VERY powerful.

also, it is a JUGGERNAUT in the raid. this is because the aura's used in the daughters fight and the oryx fight make you invincible, meaning the life drain on the final bullet does NOTHING. you can unload down to that final bullet and just wail on anything for as long as you want at full health. (it sucks at the shadow phase when you can't recover health so use your sniper or shotgun here... i say shotgun because you don't need a sniper for the sniper phases when you have a Touch of Malice).

in terms of damage to the daughters, when stacked up and damaging both daughters, we had 2 people using black spindle, 1 person using a 307 raid sniper and 1 person using a 308 1000-Yard Stare and i was outdamaging them by a good bit using just the final bullet full-auto on the daughters from inside the bubble. its godly.",2015-09-25 14:59:07+00:00,cvdsi8p,1.0,t3_3mc1z8,4539.0,DestinyTheGame

so i need to test more obviously but this is what i have gathered with my group.

damaging him in first phase, emptying bombs and then stacking and burning him again can deal about 25% to him, which will mean you can kill him in 4 rounds (plus the final ""finisher"" push)

but it seems like if you DONT fire shots after bombs the stagger phase  + well-executed bomb phase will deal 20% and put him to the end in 5 rotations. will do aoe circles 2 times this method guaranteed while in the first method we had knocked him down to 49% the second time and only did aoe's once and went straight to shadow phase.

now on the bombs it seems like they all have to be executed simultaneously because if the explosion of 3 goes off before the last one the last one isn't counted. so only 3 go off. we had one player lagging behind and consistently his bomb was being triggered on the countdown. we swapped him with a more responsive player and our damage went back to where it should be",2015-09-23 18:49:49+00:00,cvbnmml,2.0,t1_cvbn5dm,672.0,DestinyTheGame

• luke did apologize with the following quote:

&gt; ""I am Luke Smith, Creative Director on Destiny: The Taken King.

&gt; Many, many years ago, I wrote to you each week in this spot. We talked about Battle Rifles, we talked about stuff we weren't going to talk about, and at some point I did a horrible hand-drawing of an upcoming map and teased you with it in the Weekly Update.

&gt; Anyone who knows me knows I can be sarcastic, anyone who remembers podcasts I've done knows that I can be pretty blunt, and anyone who’s watched me in a ViDoc knows I'm pretty unpolished.

&gt; However, most of you don't know me.

&gt; Reading my interview with Eurogamer and imagining it came from some random developer of a game I love - that random developer looks like an Asshat.

&gt; But that Asshat was me - and those words rightfully anger you.

&gt; I'm sorry.

&gt; My words made it sound as if Bungie doesn't care about their most loyal fans.

&gt; We do care. We are listening. And we will make it right""

he didn't do that because he begged to, bungie obviously was like ""come here, write an apology now""

2244,"OK TINFOIL HAT TIME. but i've got some suspicious items i have personally found, and a wild theory:

&gt; THE FACTS

at intervals of collected calcified fragments we get important missions from Eris. the most notable being at 30/50 and 45/50 which are the two last steps to the Touch of Malice quest. but no way to get to 50 yet.

as we've seen on this reddit today new Tier 3 bosses are introducing fragments we thought currently unavailable as 46 was found this week.

&gt; UH OH look what I found

looking at destinydb.com today i searched for ""classified"" and found a lot of stuff. one of the two that stand out is [this](http://destinydb.com/items/2754424714-classified). its an item i got for breaking down a Black Hammer. it didn't seem to do anything, but Eris got a quest icon and all it did was turn in for 100 Crota's Bane rep. would have thought that was it, except it acted the same way the sleeper simulant fusion rifles do...

so then i got to thinking: if we had to turn in multiples of the rifles to the gunsmith maybe eris wants multiples of these? especially since there are so many different icons in the DestinyDB description of it... could be multiple black hammers, could be other hive-themed weapons.

then i saw [this](http://destinydb.com/items/1069694698-classified). A lone, solo, ""classified"" fragment. what if triggering something in eris makes her give us this fragment it is the last, 50/50 and it THEN unlocks a quest with her? fair to assume we can get to 49/50 with the other rotating Tier 3 Court bosses, but there is at least one rune that will be more hidden than that. the only other option i can think is that it is a reward for hard mode oryx instead...",2015-09-22 21:18:41+00:00,cvanb4x,1.0,t3_3lz0zb,7175.0,DestinyTheGame

up until today everyone thought that only 45 were available but then the Tier 3 Court boss changed and number 46 was found... stands to reason there will be a few more bosses that pop up too.

but then in [this list](http://destinydb.com/search?q=classified) of classified items there is one and only one ""Classified"" fragment...

if there are 3 more court bosses that get us to 49/50 maybe there is the 50th one that we get from giving eris enough Black Hammer Fragments,

my question is, it was that way with Crota too when your character cleared Crota for the first time he was guaranteed one special weapon at least.

my question is this, was that only for week 1 or was that a feature that existed past the first week? like if i made a brand new character and leveled up and did crota does it still work? any help is appreciated!

in the end, your comment is trivial because there isn't one ""right"" way to do the fight. if this method made it substantially easier for our group then it is equally as valid as your method for your group. there isn't a correct way to do the fight when ours obviously worked, didn't trigger enrage or any other danger mechanics and with 2 new players with us that run easily did it first time with no deaths",2015-09-21 16:12:20+00:00,cv94iu7,4.0,t1_cv93c4l,1889.0,DestinyTheGame

Since there's only one bubble only have to have one person look for thralls once and then dps. It so simple when we found this out the fight is actually literally braindead.

• kill adds

• 5 dps team goes to the corner to the right of starting point up top. 4 of them shoot the bubble down the 5th one shoots golg's knee to turn him that way

• gaze holder goes halfway up the left side hallway and waits for sound of bubble drop and grabs gaze, when bubble drops the team goes straight down to it, gaze player gets gaze and runs back to the corner left of where you started (right behind team).

• night stalker bow + sniper = 80-100k crits! All 5 dps until the timer runs out (count it down) and jump out.

• kill adds again and repeat.

For some reason this works so stupid well. It's consistent because it's one bubble and adding the 20% dps from the other gaze holder. We beat it 3 times, both times doing the 6 bubble method and went near enrage each time that way, did it this way and killed him so damn fast nowhere near enrage",2015-09-21 15:03:19+00:00,cv91ylz,2.0,t1_cv917c7,1279.0,DestinyTheGame

2313,"destiny, though they don't like to say it about themselves is an MMO. it just is. and in an mmo this happens and its standard, normal, and expected. and shouldn't be any less so for destiny.

Final fantasy XIV is a popular example lets use that. (btw my tone with you is completely cordial, I'm not trying to be an ass, you seem like you actually want to dialogue so i am being genuine).

&gt; YEAR 1

in final fantasy you had the release of final fantasy xiv for $60 (along with a subscription fee of $15 a month). so after a year of XIV you have already paid $240 for the game. in that purchase you got a core game. levels 1-50, with a raid, dungeons, quests, and pvp. throughout the course of the games life, for a little bit over a year, they released ""content patches"" ""2.1"", ""2.4"" etc. these included things like 1 new dungeon, a new weapon quest, an extension onto the raid, a new kind of raid more for casuals called Crystal Tower, etc. small bits of content added regularly (due to the monthly sub fees)

in destiny, you had a $60 base game. so you paid $60 for year 1 of destiny and it was a core game, level 1-34, with a raid, dungeons, quests, and pvp. with no subscription fees, you can't expect the same ""free"" content as with an mmo like ff XIV, so we had 2 little content patches... DLC. These added weapons, a new raid, new dungeons, new armor, new vendors, and a new dungeon more ""casual"" in nature, the Prison of Elders.

&gt; AFTER YEAR 1

in final fantasy even though you had a subscription fee, a $60 core game, then the expansion comes out. it costs $39.99 (same as destiny), adds a new raid, new dungeons, new classes, new weapons, new maps, new quests. a release that almost matches the length of the first game (almost). a lot of content for $40. subscription fee still exists. if you do NOT buy this expansion, you're screwed. the dungeons that used to give rewards, those are no longer the ""hard dungeons"" because the level cap raised. those rewarding dungeons before now don't have any rewards drop at all. the rewards that used to drop in those dungeons moved up to the new ""currently hardest"" dungeons. this is like what happened to nightfalls. if you don't buy the dlc you can keep playing the old dungeons, but you get no rewards. *even though you're still paying $15 a month you don't get the new content and your old content no longer is rewarding or worth it*

in destiny, its $40 we get new classes, new quests, new weapons, new zones, a new raid, new ""dungeons"". a campaign almost the same size as the original. its the same thing. the level cap of guardians increased to 40 for those who bought the dlc. the hardest content moved up with them, same as all other mmo's.

this is where the entitlement comes from. destiny just basically moved to Destiny 2. OP bought destiny 1, and he bought the **DLC** for it, but he did not buy the **EXPANSION** and he should not expect for things to stay the same as a ""10 year"" game is moving forward. mmo players pay 15 a month on top of the game price to see this same kind of lock-out tactic, destiny players pay no such monthly fee yet still think they shouldn't ""be treated like this"". its the price to pay for more content since we aren't paying a monthly sub fee to cover development costs.",2015-09-15 20:53:44+00:00,cv2ro6q,3.0,t1_cv2qwcy,1082.0,DestinyTheGame

&gt; ""All I can do is go on strikes that are done with in 10 minutes and earn mediocre gear because the Year 2 stuff requires level 40. Bungie can't be serious...""

you're right that doesn't at all scream ""i need new stuff too but for free"" at all...

&gt; ""I can't buy any gear from anyone at the tower because you HAVE to be a level 40""

yup...there it is again..

congratulations on buying it ""sometime"". you will get to do the new stuff then, buy the new vendor items then, do the new nightfalls then, but not now. this isn't dlc like dark below was dlc, this is an expansion pack. and in EVERY mmo, the content moves ahead and leaves late adopters/people who didn't get it behind. it's standard. 

in final fantasy xiv for example, popular mmo right now, if you didn't buy the expansion that just came out in the last couple months, you don't get any new weapons, you don't get new vendor gear, you can't upgrade your weapons to the new cool weapons, you can't go to the new zones, you can't play the new dungeons, and your old dungeons that used to give good rewards now give *no* rewards, so you literally do them for nothing now. essentially, your game came to a standstill unless you got the expansion. you could still PLAY the content if you liked the gameplay mechanics, but progression for you is done until you pony up.

but for running most content, they're all pretty straightforward and simple. monk/dragoon have a bit more positional attacks, not that hard. the only reason i said ninja is because the unintuitive nature of 3 symbols that in certain combinations = moves without any real on-screen help for rememberng the combinations.

1) the stack gets consumed after one kill. it increased your odds, but if you didn't get the exotic you have to go back to xur, buy more 3 Of Coins and then try it again, its not repeatable if you don't get it on the first kill. they said the item is far from a guarantee, meant for those who have a lot of extra coins.

2) the feature that they added in a patch long ago (when people were farming outside the Nexus boss fight in that strike) will apply here. Whenever your party wipes, the odds of good engrams dropping diminishes more. So each time you wipe without resetting in orbit, your rate for dropping a good engram is worse (and since exotic is just a rare drop, it will make it even harder to get)

and I've seen no toxicity. I'm sure it exists in the bleeding progression groups, but for normal pick up groups, naw.

I'm just back after a year away, left after Second Coil, so I'm working through Final Coil now and there are a lot of people willing to jump in and teach/learn. put a PF post up yesterday for turn 13 and it filled in about 30 minutes. i was the only person out of the 8 who hadn't done the turn. they were all i200 and came just to teach a newby and help. we wiped probably a dozen times as they let us do the fight synch'd to the proper level so i got the full experience. they were super patient and a GREAT hang.

i would call myself ""casual"" as I'm not looking to push progression bleeding-edge style. i usually am a step back. so for instance i won't be doing A1-4S this cycle and will wait until A5S+ are out and then do this one. so i didn't try turn 5 until turns 6-9 were out. but i *DO* like to be bleeding edge on the other challenging things that aren't the raid. like jumping into the 3 primal extremes etc when those dropped and getting those on farm.

effectively, making it a bigger % swing in health for the same hit, making the DRK seem squishier. so i agree, it takes a smart drk to not make it the worst experience.

sidenote, it drives me crazy as a healer in the leveling dungeons (especially vigil) when the tank won't put grit on, and each tickle from the enemies is spiking him like crazy and he responds ""i want to dps"".

with less hp, and not having more of a block modifier to make up for that missing hp you actually DO *seem* to take more damage as your health bar will dip deeper and farther than your warrior counterpart from the same attack. the healer can heal the same amount to you as to the warrior, sure. but an attack they could have ignored on the WAR they might not be able to on the DRK because it could have put them closer to a death threshold. so, effectively, the same attack on the two different tanks stands to be more damaging, overall, to the dark knight.

its like we're both going crazy now because we're explaining such a clear concept to someone who isn't getting the most basic of ideas.

yes, the have a ""pet"" (turret) but you don't micromanage its' abilities like the summoner. you use the ability once to through out a turret and it does only one job. the only way you can interact with it is a Hypercharge move on a long cooldown that just makes it stronger, but you can pretty much throw it and forget it almost entirely. it can basically just be thought of as an additional DoT, as it requires no upkeep from you after placing it",2015-09-08 15:59:51+00:00,cuuiovg,4.0,t1_cuuhw4k,1288.0,ffxiv

2477,"You're right I'm not a developer at the size of destiny, in fact, I'm fairly new to developing. I'm just a very early starting indie developer; but I can tell you while there are ripple effects to coding, there are enough knowledgeable devs on the bungie team to know how to effectively fix something like the thorn and tlw. While certain changes certainly can have far reaching effects, when the competitiveness of your game is almost completely nullified by one-two specific guns, there is no excuse for not balancing those weapons. It's as simple as a pvp-exclusive damage tuning (which actually IS as easy as changing a value). There isn't an excuse and there was no transparency. ""We know it's broken"" is not transparent.

I mean; it hasn't been broken for 3 weeks; it's been broken for 1/3 of a YEAR or more. I know destiny doesn't have the same hot fix infrastructure set up that the call of duty games do for weapon tuning/balance but they're still a good example, they tune their weapons TTK, recoil, attributes etc almost weekly. And you know whenever an OP combination is found out in those games it's only a matter of days in most cases before cod team squishes it.

At the launch of the game there would be patches almost every other week tackling guns down to the single gun itself. Patch notes included exotic tweaks to a lot of different weapons individually.

I'm not gonna be salty enough to make a post about it like OP, but I'm not naive enough to think bungie was even trying to fix these things the last few months. Their ""transparency"" is worthless when it isn't truth. The pvp changes coming to thorn in the ttk patch could have CERTAINLY been implemented sooner.

I played XIV from launch on ps3 up until the end of the last college semester. I was playing it on the sony systems at the house i was living, but both the ps3 and the ps4 after it belonged to my roommate and the square enix account i was using is linked to his playstation and i can't play on my character without his account which he's not comfortable sharing..

i want to buy the game again on my own console, which will mean starting over, which is fine, i don't mind! but my last character was a big crafter/collector. had about 6.5m gil, a ton of level IV materia/etc... 

my question is: since both characters still exist on the same server though, and I'm sure my friend wouldn't mind this one time thing, but can my old character transfer items and gil to my new character? i mean, its my gear/gil/items, i worked hard for those things, played the character religiously, got up to t8 in coil before i lost access to the system!

is there a problem with me giving my own stuff to myself? will XIV trigger that as a gil scam or anything? for a low level to be given such extravegant gifts? or will they actually investigate the transaction and see that its kosher? i mean, most gil sellers don't complete nearly all endgame content do they? would love any advice because it would definitely make starting over easier if i could at least get SOME of my items back off my alt character...",2015-08-28 14:38:32+00:00,cuindb8,1.0,t3_3iq74c,2169.0,ffxiv

The only way you'd ever see something like that happen is if they also disabled your ability to disenchant those cards, which they won't do because of those of us who would still want/need to disenchant those. If those packs are halved and I can open 200 of them for the price of 100 packs at regular price than I will never buy another pack at full price, I'll buy half price packs, getting dust at double the rate and only craft the cards I need, so now there are no packs being sold at full price, and less packs being bought even at half price because now I have a cheap effective way to get dust.

So then let's say they make less dust/no dust. Now if I get those packs I'm either stuck with inventory I don't want, I'm not getting dust for extras (which isn't fair to me with a full collection), or I'm stuck with shit which isn't fun.

This game was not designed to be played free. It's free as a *limited* option, it's supposed to make them money and this decision would have rippling effects that decreased overall sales. ",2015-08-28 00:54:23+00:00,cui4p4x,1.0,t3_3infnd,11227.0,hearthstone

to add on to your assessment of costs, i can almost guarantee that blizzard has in-house artists on salary that can provide them with the simple artwork for an alternate hero still. and that person is not going to get the same compensation as a contract artist.

You clearly have no experience with competitive card games in any form or fashion because otherwise you have stopped making the same points you keep making.

Unstable Portal, Piloted Shredder. These are NOT the same as Sylvanas, ragnaros or boombots. All those last three can be set
Up to do what you want so it's not rng, it's a poor pilot. If you want a certain Ysera with your Sylvanas, clear all the other creatures, Mage hero power your Sylvanas to 4 and run her into Ysera. There you just made it now rng.

Again, you clearly are not a competitive veteran because real competitive players understand that (unstable portal style cards aside, which are true rng) all of these card games have effects like that and it does NOT make them uncompetitive. 

Magic the gathering is one of the most popular competitive card games on the planet. They have COUNTLESS ""look at the top __ of your library. Put a creature from among them on the battlefield; put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order"". Or there were cards that said ""play with the top card of your deck revealed, if it's a land card you can play it""

Magic has a mechanic called ""Clash"", you and the opponent you clash with reveal the top card of your decks, the card with the higher mana cost wins. Magic literally has joust and yet it is still the most competitively played card game ever.

These style cards can be manipulated by players who actually know what they're doing, and they won't be understood by players who just slap cards down. These cards are NOT deterring competitiveness of the game. ""End of story""",2015-08-13 12:09:38+00:00,cu1hhqg,6.0,t1_cu19t6m,26083.0,hearthstone

• when you cast boom, the 7/7 part of him is almost always immediately taken down because its too big of a threat. that threat still exists in rhonin and he will demand to be dealt with, if he's not killed, it would seem like you're doing just fine anyway

• when he IS taken down you get your arcane bolts. 3 arcane bolts = guaranteed 9 damage split randomly. with the bomb attacks+procs you are looking at anywhere from 6-10 damage split randomly. in the case of the bombs then you have a benefit because the 1/1s can trade with little minions but there are some other things to consider in certain mage decks:

&gt; • if theres a firewaker in your hand when rhonin dies now your rhonin matched boom as a 7/7 but if you play flamewaker+bolt+bolt+bolt you just death a guaranteed 15 extra board clearing damage.

&gt; • if theres an archmage antonidas in your hand or on the field you now get the 9 damage off bolts *and* 3 fireballs to end it all.

&gt; • if you play with malygos and play him after rhonin dies you have 24 damage headed for their board :O

so boom will be better in some matches but i may actually prefer rhonin myself!

i think they're wisely being safe with this set as far as power levels go because they don't rotate sets like magic does, adding 120+ cards every couple months could quickly turn the game into the broken mess that legacy mtg can be. its not ""fun"", it's just turn 2 or 3 kills from every single deck because of broken interactions.

i think this set is nice, they're giving us new tools but keeping them from breaking anything. very few cards have come out that are like ""oh shoot! this works amazing with ____"". some, but not many.

at the same time, stuff like joust, while not incredible on its own, *does* slow down an aggro-heavy meta by giving control decks the upper hand within that mechanic.

Hawkmoon shouldn't have a 1-shot kill ever, gjallarhorn was op, thorn was def op, tlw TTK was way too short, black hammer was too strong against bosses and enemies with limited movement, and players manipulated the system too much with ice breakers recharging special ammo and switching out to other weapons",2015-07-17 16:56:02+00:00,ct6qhob,2.0,t1_ct6q22k,630.0,DestinyTheGame
2651,"people abuse the ice breaker in replenishing their special ammo reserves, i honestly think thats why it got the recharge nerf.

additionally, almost everyone who played at the e3 showroom have already said that weapons felt different (and in line with the new weapon changes no less).

auto rifles handled better, pulse rifles we good but slightly harder to hit with, the hand cannon performed very well up close, but at a distance it kicked a fair deal making it harder to knock off multiple head shots, and shotguns had a less forgiving range.

its not them nerfing our favorite weapons to move us to new weapons, its that they're setting up EVERYTHING for a flush new vision for all weapons moving into the TK. the whole landscape is going to be different, including new exotics being in line (ideally) with the power level of the exotics we have. 

plus, they didnt nerf exotics all across the board... a lot of exotics got buffs too. thorn didnt really get nerfed that hard. still falls under the new hand cannon limitations, but got a net buff on damage if you're good with it and can stack the poison DoT, the necrochasm is not only benefiting from the overall auto rifle buff, but also from a handful of it's own AWESOME sounding buffs (more stability, more ammo in mag, 100% precision explosion proc, bigger blast radius and more damage), hard light go some big buffs itself.

they really did level out a lot of stuff, while taking away some exploitable things that people really shouldn't have been surprised by...

icebreaker nerf, because people were abusing ammo regen when recharging your IB and switching to something else wasn't the intention, black hammer nerf because it was stronger than it should have been. its still quite good, but no longer OP. hawkmoon should never have had 1-shot kills, TLW needed a nerf because its TTK was insane and way out of line of other weapons in the game, and if people didnt think Gjallarhorn would eventually be nerfed, they're crazy... the Gjallarhorn trivializes so much content, and even creates tenuous situations within the player base with LFG posts going as far as to discriminate against those without the weapon for most end-game encounters (and no doubtedly would've been the case again in new content).

the patch is going to have critics because people are upset to see their favorite weapons change, the things they're familiar with, change... but the patch, on the whole is very well thought out it seems. I'm sad to see some of my favorite weapons nerfed, but i think even the nerfs will be manageable in capable hands, while also making guns like Hard Light, Necrochasm, Monte Carlo, etc, usable!

2654,"that does sound awesome but I'm a little confused about the individual sale point. this game doesn't use true rng on the boosters, and you are capped at how many copies of a card you can hold.

4x common, 3x uncommon, 2x rares, 1x mythic.

i actually have all the cards in the iOS version, it doesn't allow me to buy boosters anymore because i have the max copies of all cards. one of my boosters even had 2x mythics (leliana and archangel) because i was nearing the end of my booster pool and hadn't got them yet.

what I'm saying, is you can only get a finite amount of boosters before  you are *guaranteed* every card in the game so individual sales isn't completely necessary!

the rest of what you're saying: HELL YES.

Maybe the fix for this is harder to fix. The fix for the helmet was to just add a cooldown to the ability. This thorn glitch is harder to fix than that as many guns across multiple weapon classes share the perk. You can't just change it for ""x"", that will cause a ripple effect to other areas almost assuredly.

Also, the ""glitch"" of the gloves weren't really a glitch other than the grenade orbs literally were ""dying"" and the perk was doing what it was meant to do. Ghosts and shells like those work that way (same reason a Ram can punch a dead ghost orb to replenish health). That perk was working ""as intended"" but it was just utilizing a method that gave it too many ""kills"" to be fair.

With the thorn glitch you are literally manipulating underlying game mechanics. I don't know the trigger, best guess is similar to how switching a secondary/heavy depletes the ammo, when you switch off thorn it ""depletes"" the magazine, then refills it because of the ""primary"" attribution but doesn't reset the fact that it went down to the bottom of a clip.

basically you're right, until we play with them, some of these skills could turn out to be lackluster, but as is, they definitely outclass the existing guardians in terms of overall utility in pvp. in pve, i think there will still be a case to make for invisibility, defense bubble, and self-rez",2015-06-18 14:51:53+00:00,csaqfbg,4.0,t1_csaq57i,470.0,DestinyTheGame

2912,"i almost guarantee they will be allowing another upgrade.

would be so stupid as this package includes the original 3 pieces too, for new players they're not going to expect them to level up, get some of the weapons from those expansions and then all of sudden can't get them high enough to keep using them. and there aren't going to be enough new items to completely replace 3 sets of gear.

so no, i think we will be able to ascend again. same as when our guns were ""maxed"" at 331",2015-06-16 18:54:30+00:00,cs8nw91,1.0,t3_3a2auc,3682.0,DestinyTheGame

2914,"i hope to, but without a png, the lightning is very hard to cut out from its' background. you'll see 4 layers here, a font/icon layer, the guardian, a class-colored gradient, then finally oryx. the only stormcaller image I've found so far is a jpg, so its hard to cut out the lightning, the same is problem with the nightstalker, the titan was easy to cut out. but I'm trying!",2015-06-16 18:05:44+00:00,cs8lwb7,2.0,t1_cs8lj5s,534.0,DestinyTheGame
