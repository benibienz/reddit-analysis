We also haven't had many, if any, trials/pieces of content that could warrant wanting to do that. (you could say the maze but id wager not many people did that).

So we actually don't know if Gumi *would* drop the ban hammer, but COULD they? **YES**. (and there have been ""confirmed"" bans in Japan build for similar activity)

Please take a look at just 2 of the articles in the Terms of Service that I think relate to the known exploit for manipulating the Maxwell fight:

&gt;**A. Services Use Restrictions. You agree that you will not, and you will not assist other users:**

&gt;*(i)* engage in any activity that interferes with a user's access to the Services or the proper operation of the Services, or otherwise causes harm to the Services, the Company, or other users of the Services; 

This one quite obviously explains itself. But I won't explain why, because:

&gt;**A. Services Use Restrictions. You agree that you will not, and you will not assist other users:**

&gt;*(m)* exploit any bug or vulnerability in the Services or in any product of the Company to gain unfair advantage. You agree not to communicate the existence of any such bug (either directly or through the public posting) to any other user or third party;

I think that should just about do it. If you care enough about this game that you need to exploit it to get a mediocre (for now) unit, then you obviously would care if your account was stripped from you. The terms make it clear that any violation is grounds for them deciding to permanently ban those accounts. Maxwell isn't *that* good. Trust.

*(if you want to read all the terms for yourself (because there are even more that could pertain to the exploit) you [can find them here](https://lapis-news.gumi.sg/en/content/userpolicysin/index_i.html#en))*",FFBraveExvius,"For those of you using and exploit on Maxwell.

I can't take credit for the build though! Moose Torrent made a video on youtube outlying the build. You should subscribe to his channel, he's a fun dude and makes some gun builds.

[His video on this build shows off its obvious fun-factor in pvp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIJPGin21D8)

However, I only based my build off of his with more of a focus on PVE and jolly cooperation specifically, increasing the level a bit (to 125) and changing some points around, specifically giving up some faith for luck to get a lot of out Anri's blade. 

The goal remains the same: **Always have self heal ticks active**.

Without using *any* of the spells or buffs you have passive health regen from:

• Anri's Sword

• Blessed Caestus

• Sun Princess Ring

When you're exploring with your host/etc you will always get back up to full health without using any of your FP.

If you get invaded, or before you fight a boss you can buff with Blessed Weapon, as well as the buff from your chime (unlike Moose's build, we only use this one bell chime. our FTH/spell adjust isn't high enough to get the 3/hp per tick from the Sacred Cleric chime. but thats ok because this build has access to Anri's sword, which gives us 2/hp per tick which then equals 4/hp with the chime, as opposed to the 3/hp you get from the higher faith value in his video so we actually are still netting an additional 1/hp of regen over the original build for our purposes!)

ANYWAY.

you also are outfitted with Deep Protection for extra OOMPH and Atonement so that you can be the PVE tank you're meant to be! You have all kinds of defense and self healing, no reason to let the host take all the pain!

Hope this proves fun for anyone. I have been LOVING this build. I win most arena matches with this beast too since I almost always am at a health advantage even when making some otherwise unfavorable trades! (on that note, i have found myself recently popping the Blessed Weapon+Deep Protection and then using the Caestus instead of the chime Art and have had pretty favorable results!)

Everybody had the option of buying the $20 version to get access to the game and then updating once they saw more of what the $100 pack offered. I mean, without the Master Challenges the $20 didn’t really differ that much from the $100.

Second, these Master Challenge skins are entirely free in-game! Playing primarily Gideon, I have gotten to just rank 7 as of last night. In that grind alone I could have paid the 73,000 for the challenge and I would almost be to my second stack of 73,000 by tonight. And from what I understand about the grind from 8-10, I will probably get another 73,000 before I’m done! It is *not* that unreasonable an amount of reputation for the in-game purchase. 

Now here is why I think the Master Challenge skin being the same molten skin for all characters is **actually a good thing!**

There will undoubtedly be a LOT of skins for *every* character. Epic has made it clear that we will be getting the game for free, and *a new character every 3 weeks for free for everybody*!. They are only planning on making money from boosts and cosmetics like skins and taunts. So I think it is safe to say that their money-making skins in the future will be quite inventive and exciting to make us consider to put in optional money for that cosmetic feature. I think that is a reasonable expectation!

So then, why I think the Master Skin being universal is a good thing: It is **instantly** recognizable for what it is! 

The Master Challenge skin, unlike the future skins/costumes, represents something specific: a LOT of time and mastery of a character. It takes about 100 hours to get Master Rank with a character (that's what an Epic dev said if your win rate is about 50/50). When you see molten skin, regardless of the character, you know what it took to get it. It wasn’t just someone who put $5 on their mums credit card to get that flashy TwinBlast skin where he's wearing a Hawaiin Floral shirt unbuttoned, it's someone who is most likely going to know the ins and outs of that character.

For me its a “status” skin, and wasn’t meant to be an inventive completely unique skin treatment. It's the same as if they gave you a “golden” version of that hero, which I think most people would just accept as the master skin, but Epic just went a different route aesthetically.

**If all future DLC skins are color swaps as well then let’s agree to riot**, but until then, let’s accept the master skins as they are: statement colors. It’s a universal symbol for “I know the **SHIT** out of this character. GLHF.”

Would love to hear if you agree? Disagree?",paragon,Counterpoint: Why I think the Master skins being the same for all characters is good!,https://www.reddit.com/r/paragon/comments/4bmyet/counterpoint_why_i_think_the_master_skins_being/

We got our Touch of Malice early and it seems like there is nothing to truly chase in the Hard Mode (outside of the slow and seemingly impossible grind to 320).

So then there's this quote from Luke Smith saying that we have, mathematically, only seen 5/13 of the raid. Looking at PSN trophy data, it showed less than 1% of players have beat HM oryx. So that made me think he is talking about the 5 normal mode loot points (Warpriest door, Warpriest, Gologroth, Daughters, Oryx). so if you've beat the hard mode then you will hypothetically be at 10/13 of the raid done.

We know there are 3 Challenges (because you can see their emblems in the kiosk), and we also know we're missing 3 Calcified Fragments!

at 15/50, 30/50, and 45/50 fragments, we triggered the exotic quests from Eris for our Touch of Malice weapon. But we finished Old Hunger and did not receive the shader for completing the quest (as can be seen in the kiosk). 

Everything I've said has been known, so here we go with the theory!

We grind our levels until we're strong enough to complete the 3 Hard Mode Challenges. Killing bosses certain ways. We get the 3 calcified fragments that are missing from these challenges which begin the quest for the new Hard Mode exotic weapon...

I believe that weapon to be an exotic void Heavy weapon, the ""Blade of Oryx""! I even have screenshots to ""support"" my theory:

[In the final, ""secret"" cutscene after the credits, and after we have defeated oryx in the storyline, we saw Eris walk up the sword ominously. she touches the sword and it crumbles, leaving behind a floating stone. THIS IS THE EXACT SAME SHAPE STONE WE HAVE IN OUR SWORD HILTS](http://i.imgur.com/MPH9JZc.jpg)

This works on so many levels imo. One, we only have the 3 swords from the quest line, which always felt like, although they were awesome, there were missed opportunities with this awesome new weapon type. The crystal in her hand there is purple, like a void weapon. This fits the pattern: first raid - solar fusion rifle, second raid - arc auto rifle, third raid - void sword!

what do you guys think? i love the swords and i think if i had the sword of the Hive king i would never use anything else!

tl;dr - my theory is that the HM raid, after completing the 3 challenges, will initiate an eris quest for us to claim the Blade of Oryx, [this image is what gave me this idea and now I'm hoping with all my heart!](http://i.imgur.com/MPH9JZc.jpg)",DestinyTheGame,My theory for our reward after completing the 3 Challenges in the Hard Mode King's Fall Raid (King's Fall HM Exotic Weapon theory),https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3qpw9i/my_theory_for_our_reward_after_completing_the_3/

They need to implement a deterrent instead.

Maybe it's a 10-15 minute penalty for leaving a game. Maybe it's decreased exp/rep/loot for subsequent runs after leavin. Maybe it puts you in a lobby exclusive to other quitters/abandoners.
