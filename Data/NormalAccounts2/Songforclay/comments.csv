No no you don't need a chemistry background at all. In LCA you will find people from everywhere.

But to stay on economics, in Consequential LCA they use a lot of economic models to look at marginal changes on the market of a decision. Some people are also working on way to give a value of those impact so that companies have more incentive to make the right decision.

After that I kind of depend of what side of Prince you enjoy the most, the funky side, ballad, pop, rock ?? 

Personally I would skip his first album (but still listen to it but later maybe) and maybe start with the second one ""Prince"".  Lovesexy, Around the world in a day and 1999 are also very good albums.

and try to find a live show too, I think this is where Prince is the best. ",2015-09-13 05:14:26+00:00,cuzrc6f,1.0,t3_3kqv83,4397.0,PRINCE

It is not an method you can do in your head while at the supermarket but a lot of studies have already been done so if you have questions you might find answers by looking for ""product you want""  + LCA
