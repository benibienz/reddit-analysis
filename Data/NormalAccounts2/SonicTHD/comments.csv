And this is a kinda good because when a character really dies, you get surprised like ""holy shit he died"".

But I don't like the idea of just perma-dead Pietro, I mean, in the future, hidden by Wanda, he could be alive, but just keep him dead just because ""it's a war movie"" and ""Fox has Quicksilver now"" and ""he should be dead to contradict this Marvel Never Kills thing"".

Fredbear's has purple, when Freddy's has black

And also, there's just one Fredbear, Stage 01 needs to be a Freddy, and since there's theories talking about that, the community created the animatronic Spring Freddy to explain this

About Spring Bonnie, isn't the same animatronic, is like Withered and Classic Freddy, same character but not same animatronic and design.

The Fredbear's one is FNaF World one, and the Freddy's one in the Stage 01 one, which explains why there's posters of Spring Bonnie with black props when the FNaF World one has purple props.

The book also shows evidence saying there's a yellow Freddy Fazbear suit, which obviusly can't be Golden Freddy since he isn't a spring suit, so Spring Freddy confirmed?

Stage 01 also has clows, which is like FNaF 1 stage, so probably is the same restaurant, which explains why Stage 01, the first stage of Freddy's. Which isn't like the FNaF 4 one.

About the vents, there's any explaination about it, probably just a gameplay thing. Tbh these vents do anything for the bulding.

The toys **are** possessed, there is five kids on the minigame SAVE THEM, one for wich toy, wich is perfect. Another proof they are possessed is because Phone Guy and the technicias don't know what happened if they, they said it was their technology temperaded, but they don't really know. And the white eyes of course, how they could change their normal eyes to black and white dots?

Imagine, you want to make a draw of Funtime Foxy, and you don't know what gender she is. So a guy draw her like a woman, people wich belive she is a man will dislike and hate the draw, and if the person draw like a man, more people will dislike and hate.

Is common people on the community don't respect other people opinion about that, like Fredbear design. A lot of people hate the model like a copy of Original Freddy (like me), and other people hate the idea of he been a un-nightmare version of Nightmare Fredbear.

Is hard to make a art, or a animation, or something wich there's this big controversy behold the community. Remember the drama of David Near's? He disable the commentaries because a lot of people was saying ""mangle is obviusly a woman you cunt"" and some shit like that. Is a kinda sad and nonsense this things.

561,"""Baby's wasn't opened in 83!""

For me I agree with you, but people are saying it was to be the sister location mentioned.

""Freddy's was.""

We don't know when the first Freddy's opened, but since FNaF 1 Phone calls Phone Guy said it was in 72 (wich don't makes sense a lot by the technology).  

""Fredbear &amp; Friends was a promotion for Freddy's, but due the crying child dying, Fredbear doesn't become the main attraction""

Dude, for me FNaF 4 stills in 87, since the HTML's in the teasers, the ""Was it me?"", the Toys and Funtime Foxy figures and the New Spring Bonnie suit. I know SL obviusly says is in 83, but for me can still be in 87 and i don't think i will change my opinion. Since, there's anywhere in the games saying about another bite.

""Let's say Freddy's closes in 85"" well, i agree with that, since after Fredbear's: &amp; Friends closed by the springlock incident, the Originals back to the Stage 01 location, wich was the original location, and closed in 85, because is the same year as the murders.

""The springlock incident happened at this time""

Actually no, because needs to happen in Stage 01 era, when the Originals wasn't in that location. Probably they was in FFD: F&amp;F location, wich probably happened there.

""Afton is Purple Guy"" ""So the story of SL probably happens 1985-1987"" 

I mean, SL techincly needs to happen after FNaF 1, since FNaF 4 had the FNaF 1 phone call, wich don't makes sense if it was before. Mr. Afton can be easily another parent of William/Purple Guy, since is interesting how we never heard his first name. And Purple Guy just died in 1995, techincly like the books, so SL is probably between 92-95. I know HandUnit said about Freddy's success, but he could was talking in the past, since the Classics era was a faillure.

""But he did have an idea that a springlock malfunction happened at a sister location of Freddy's (that wasn't Fredbear's)""

How if the only locations wich existed was Fredbear's and Freddy's? FNaF 4 should be the final game, and we could easily solve the lore with the first four games, SL shouldn't existed. And yes! It's a important thing for the plot, since this springlock accident can explain why Purple Guy want's to kill the kids.

""Spring Bonnie came before Bonnie""

This don't makes sense. Well, makes sense if we're talking about Spring Bonnie and not New Spring Bonnie. New Spring Bonnie was created just in 87, because he is a Bonnie, a propety of Freddy's franchise, wich Fredbear's before was bought by Fazbear Entertainment couldn't be used. Spring Bonnie could be existed before Bonnie, BUT JUST IF Spring Freddy and Spring Bonnie was created in 72, and Freddy's guang was created after just for FFD: F&amp;F, wich for me don't makes sense a lot since the spring mechanism is a characteristic of Fredbear's franchise, wich Fazbear Entertainment could just used if they bought Fredbear's franchise or something like that.",2016-10-12 19:22:06+00:00,d8p7i39,2.0,t1_d8p6klc,1126.0,fivenightsatfreddys

I said Mendo because now we know Lolbit is canon, and tbh i don't liked alot that, Scott put a character from another universe to be canon.. is strange but okay

I made a theory in the past wich i think anyone made before, talking about (Omega) Scott Cawthon, Scott's Head and Sad Desk Man guy was representations of Scott Cawthon himself, like Revenge, Anger, Sadness, blah blah blah

So i think Sad Desk Man is techincly the sad and creative side of Scott, wich cares about people opinions, wich explain why he's sad because a lot of people hated FNaF World, and also he created FNaF 57, Foxy Fighters, Foxy.EXE and Chica's Magic Rainbow, wich this means he is a creator, not just for robots

Afton is Purple Guy, and problably Purple Guy is Purplegesit, as Purpleguy said he was ""just a sprite"", uh okay

So how the hell would Scott put that on the game? Just to make peopl crazy and lie? Or because he was the first animatronic created on FNaF World universe? This dont makes any sense

Also, about his quote, is the same post he talk about Silver Eyes is canon or not, i couldn't find in his steam history but i remember a lot this post, he said ""the book is canon, in some ways"", wich means some parts of the book are canon, like why Purple Guy was never put on the prison? Solved, because they don't had the bodies to put him there

I mean, you really think Scott would do these things for lie and for fun? This dont makes any sense!

And about Freddy's been created in the 70's, i still think this dont makes sense, since Phone Guy could be exagereting, like saying ""it's actually (random number next to 20), but in resume is 20 years', i mean, how the hell they would created the franchise before 77? Or even before 80's? ""Its a fictional universe"" still needs a little sense, and if this can be true, Fredbear could be created in 1970 or even in the 60's (Like somehow Candy's was created in the 60's, so why not FNaF too?)

This isn't like FNaC or PGS, these things are official

I problably get wrong about FD, but if these attraction was made by Scott's help, so techincly is revelant

- The gameplay kid can't be the bite victim, because he died and Scott techincly confirmed that on Matpat's video.

- The other who was traumatized by the bite was the brother, so makes sense

- The gameplay has a lot of similarities with FNaF 1, the room design, the Nightmares and Classics designs, and even the secret phone call in the game wich is from FNaF 1 who talks about the bite

1081,"It's nice when someone understand that, and this startest a big whole conversation and a massive theory (thanks to LAK132, this beutifull) for understand that

And i think is simple

So:

We know Fredbear's characteristics are the purple, and of course the main character as Fredbear

Well Adventure Spring Bonnie is something wich we never saw before, and if he would be Springtrap, he should be like the Adventure one too, something like Adventure Toy Bonnie and Adventure Shadow Bonnie wich makes sense

So definitilly. This Spring Bonnie isn't the same as Springtrap

So, FNaF 3 and 4 tells a story in diffeent locations, FNaF 3 focus on Freddy's and FNaF 4 focus on Fredbear's

Wich means Stage 01 minigame is the one behind Springtrap location

And New Spring Bonnie (i'm talking about the Adventure one, i like to call him like that) is from Fredbear's

Now Stage 01 has Spring Bonnie and a mysterious yellow bear

Can't be Original Golden Fredy (the un-withered one)

Because as i said before, by the logic FNaF 3 focus on Freddy's, probably the Stage 01 location is where Phone Guy tapes are been recorded

Wich makes sense, because Phone Guy is talking in a Freddy's location how he said

He said also they had two especial designed suit, spring suits

I think is obvius by design about Golden Freddy never was a spring suit

Wich means that's why by this phrase the community created the aniamtronic by this proof called Spring Freddy

Because makes sense, a Freddy been a protagonist on a Freddy's restaurant, or you think is a new type of Fredbear with Brown/Black hat?

What about Original Golden Freddy?

By some facts in FNaF 2 like his plushie or the custom night, it's pretty safe saying he is real

So why he was created?

Probably to be a version of Spring Freddy but without spring mechanism

Or to stay in the stage when Spring Freddy was using in the restaurant or when he was abandoned by the springlock incident

I belive in the first one because the second means the Spring Bonnie should be abandoned, but he's there on the Stage

So that's it I think

A little resume:

Fredbear's - Is where has Fredbear and New Spring Bonnie, the one who appears in FNaF World

Stage 01 - Probably the first Freddy's, wich has Spring Bonnie, the one wich turns into Springtrap, Spring Freddy, Golden Cupcake (by the easter egg in the same game wich focus on Freddy's) and probably Original Golden Freddy as a substitute without the spring mechanism

But there's chances to be in 83 thought, but to be in 87, how we talked before, we need to know why and how the company was using the spring suits again...

And a point, I think in Fredbear's just had 2 spring suits, because probably the other two we saw in suit mode are the same on the stage (wich means the shadows are the Shadows), but this thing of the Shadows is a kinda complicated by me like now, because how you said and what we talked, the springlock incident could be the Purple Guy incident in the boo, wich means ""what are the Shadows?""

-Poopet

-Chroma Freddy (IT'sREAL1111oneone!!!)

-Phantom Bonnie 

-Desk Fan (i know he is already on the list but just saying he isn't a animatronic/charachter &gt;.&lt;)

And some other categories about fangames wich could be put

-TRTF (1,2,3,4,5,FB) (Don't hate me about that, stills a fangame with a lot of characters...)

-TJoC

-Final Nights (1,2,3)

-FNaF World (enemies, bossess)

-FNaF World Beta (Halloween Edition enemies, Trailler enemies)

-FNaF World Minigames (Enemies from Foxy Fighters and FNaF 57)

-FNaF World Attack Characters (Virtua-Freddy, Mimic Ball, etc)

-FNaF World (DeeDee's fishes, why? I dont know ;-;)

-FNaF World Unused Characters (Just Brow Boy and a fucking Turtle)

-Canceled and uncanon games (PGS:E, PGS 2, FW, TRTF:R, or others)

I think I put everyone wich I could remember....

I know a lot about FNaF and fangames characters, i search a lot about these things, that's why i put a lot of characters you could put...

I know again you won't put everyone, because wich will gonna be the list so giant and we couldn't handle with it, but is just options to add

2. And Foxy too. The light is just a mechanic, has a similaritie with FNaF 2 but could be explained without this

3. Stills a possibilitie, because if Nightmare Mangle (wich i know isn't canon but i don't care) coild be explained by Phantom Mangle wich doesn't shows her entire body so can explains Nightmare BB like Phantom BB and the drawnings. 

There's any proof about Mike is the nightguard in FNaF 3 tbh, but the proofs are in FNaF 4 because Plushtrap, wich they can't be explained, so the only explaination is he is the nightguard in the third game. But in FNaF 2 there's any proof about Mike worked there. Nightmare BB and these things about the flashlight and the hallway can have different explainations, but no like Plushtrap wich don't has any explaination.

BESIDES, to explains the flashlight, the ""Fun With"" hallway, the Nightmare Fredbear just been a head, Nightmare BB and everything, he needs to work like a **nightguard**, wich is impossible because FNaF2 location had just 3 nightguards, Purple Guy, wich he is the nightguard because i remember in the Save Them he has a **phone**, wich don't makes sense if he isn't Phone Guy, so he was listen the phone calls because he is the nightguard, and that's why he is the only guy in the restaurant, because the place is locked, is in the night, the only nightguard, and the others are Jeremy and Fritz, wich don't makes sense like some people says he chnged his name.

Nightmare BB doesn't looks a lot like BB, one point about that is his colors, wich are red and **purple**, BB has red and **blue**, this can be explained by the fact the bare BB head on the box don't has any hat, and some drawnings on the place probably are inaccurate.

Phantom Foxy is understood, because like he said in FNaF World ""Too much Foxy's isn't enough""

Explaining that, for the fans Mangle is a unique character, not a Foxy character

Wich if Foxy don't appeared in the game the fans would be so pissed of

And Phantom Freddy probably because community loves Golden Freddy...

Phantom Chica i don't know, but my straw-gaspping could be just a ""nostalgia"" for the first game, wich have the second game models, why not from the first?

And yes, there is six souls for the six phantoms, the Toys souls from Toy Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Mangle, BB and the soul of Puppet

I made a post about a girl can't possess a male animatronic, because i think is a kinda wrong and strange, but okay

I NEVER SAID THAT

I dont know why everyone thinked im transphobic just because a opinion about a soul possessing a robot

Okay i probably said some words wich sounds like im one

But jesus how many times i need to say? IM NOT

And now we are here, and you downvoted for what?

Because for my misunderstood past?

Because i never saw or heard about trans kids?

For me isn't normal, but is pretty good to know what is your sexuality option and how you are inside of you

* Or she was created in the first opening of the FNaF 2 restaurant, with the Originals, Funtime Foxy and Puppet, wich explains her drawning on the wall of the office from FNaF 2, wich the color is purple, not red like Balloon Boy

She is not withered because she is made of plastic, wich possibly Cupcake isn't withered too

She just don't appears in Save Them on the Parts &amp; Services because or the restaurant changed her colors to be BB (wich her appearing on the office is a hallucination of a old memory of her), or she somehow isn't in the minigame like BB, wich i belive in the last thing

I seriusly think he don't used the Golden Freddy suit, because obviusly, four fingers wich stills don't makes sense, the metals inside who could kill him, and the soul who will try to kill him too. I think is safe now the we back with the Spring Freddy theory or like you said, Purple Guy was arrested and they catch the suit of Springbonnie again... I don't know im confuse now with this everything and i need to look again the calls and the drawnings and everything

* Stills a straw-gaspping

* Dude, about the name of the FNaF 4 restaurant, okay you said is a question of the company bought the restaurant and etc, but stills don't makes sense put Fredbear been the main character of a restaurant wich isn't in his name! Well, whatever been Freddy's or Fredbear's.

* About FNaF 4 been before FNaF 2, yeah i think now you used the Purple Guy hiring, is a pretty good proof to say the game is before. But for now i think i shouldn't talk more about FNaF 2 and FNaF 4 timeline, because like i said, this conveser made me confused. I need to see again the FNaF 2 calls, the drawnings of the kids on the walls, the FNaF 4 minigames, Purple Guy changing his apparence, everything the remake the timeline, because wasn't enough the Drawnings VS Phone Calls thing wich made two different timelines, but now we have this hole thing with Purple Guy being hired and fired and he changing of apparence. We have this newspapers of FNaF 1 too wich is making more and more confuse. Well, for now let's say yes, FNaF 4 is before FNaF 2, but stills don't makes sense these kids are the Toys, like i said, different places, and is pretty good saying these ""theory"" of they been the Toys is straw-gaspping because they ""looks like"" the Toys... We don't know if the sister is the pink girl or the orange girl yet (i know you made theories about she been the orange girl but isn't safe saying she is yet) and Purple Guy been in the FNaF 4 restaurant. I belive he killed the kids and they are the SL animatronics, wich makes more sense. Well i don't know much now, because this everything is making me confuse. We can't say me or you are right in something, because there is more, but yes, i think you're right about FNaF 4 is before FNaF 2... Well for now...

* Your point in the company fuck off about everything makes sense, you winned in that.

* Phone Guy dont said previous employees, he said about the first guard who was working before Jeremy, who was left to the day shift. He never said about ""he was fired"" or something, purple could just escaped for the other location. Also, is the company or the restaurant we're talking about? Because if i know, is the restaurant who hire employees, not the company. Yes Fredbear's is know from Fazbear's, but if i know is the restaurant who hire him. Probably im fucking wrong and im saying shit. Well, first we don't know what restaurant was the place who Purple was arrested, but probably is the restaurant before FNaF 2 because, he was solved because they never found the bodies, and the restaurant after this found the bodies inside the animatronics, wich like you said, they hidden them. The restaurant don't really knows who is the murder of that kids, so they could easily let Goy still working in the restaurant. How? Okay, so probably he was arrested in the first location, wich is GGGF minigame. In that minigame he was different, and after this in Save Them he had another apparence. So this could be a reference of William in the book change his apparence and his names to still working in the restaurant and still murder the kids. ALSO, in FNaF 2 location we never know if the restaurant or the police found the bodies, was never mentioned in anywhere. In the newspaper of FNaF 1, is mentioned ""Freddy's will closed...after the incident wich happened many years ago"". What incident? The first murders! Many years ago could be like 2 or 3 years before 87. In anywhere, was mentioned they found the bodies of another murder in the second pizzeria. There was a investiguation who happened yes, but we never know if happened something. Wich could means why they re-opened again. So, years before they arrested Goy, but was solved because no bodies. Goy changed to GGGF sprite to Save Them sprite like in the book (wich Scott said somethings happened in the game universe) to still working in the pizzeria and kill more children. After the FNaF 2 restaurant was closed, Goy goes to work in another place, wich stills has his apparence of Save Them minigame, wich the company don't knows if he is the same guy who they arreested years before.",2016-08-10 02:23:10+00:00,d6bakav,26.0,t1_d6b99ev,1984.0,fivenightsatfreddys

And yes human fingers matters a lot, the hand in FNaF 4 has a hidden fifth finger hidden (i think i talked this with you last week, i promise to show a image, well i will try now), it's everything just perspective

But if this hand has really 4 fingers, don't makes any fucking sense, because every Spring suit **needs* has 5 fingers for humans, why would they create a suit who can wear but without a fifth finger? Don't makes any sense

2276,"I loved how you see the story, you think like me :P

But there is some errors in my opinion

The first location of Freddy's was Stage 01, with Spring Freddy (Fredbear wasn't in that place) Springbonnie (Pre-Springtrap like you said) and Golden Cupcake (FNaF 3 easter egg, he totally could existed there)

The animatronics (Freddy and friends) like Phone Guy said, was created 20 years before 1992 (it can't be 93, because paychecks), so 72

Well, we know Fredbear was created first then everyone, in Fredbear's V1, so probably after 92, the same year or 93-95 was created Freddy and his friends, too act with Fredbear in Fredbear's:F&amp;F

So in 80-84 was created the first Freddy's wich is Stage 01, and after Fredbear's created his own Spring Bonnie probably in 84 (he don't appears in the commercial in 83)

After the two restaurants closed because the springlock incident, Freddy's reopened in 85 with finally the Originals who was in Fredbear's but now is in Freddy's V2, and that where happened the missing children incident

And what you said about Golden Freddy is totally truth, you're totally right about he be one of the replacements and don't be a springlock animatronic, but in the FNaF 2 drawning he wasn't interacting with the kid, he was stop just smelling, and the kid looking to him when the others was looking to another corner

Shadow Freddy technically is a counterpart of Golden Freddy, but he first mimiced Fredbear, like Shadow Bonnie mimiced first Spring Bonnie

After that, they need it to mimic counterparts of Freddy and Bonnie, wich was Golden Freddy and Toy Bonnie

Different to Golden Freddy, Toy Bonnie was his last mimic of Shadow Bonnie, because don't existed more of them (probably if exists a Funtime Bonnie in SL, Shadow Bonnie will finally change of form and mimics him)
Pbut Golden Freddy changed his forms, in the second he was Withered, in the first was Classic, and in the third Toy Freddy soul transformed into a Phanom version of the model of Withered Golden Freddy

Shadow Freddy mimiced this three Freddys:

- Withered in FNaF 2

- Classic in FNaF 3 minigames

- Phantom in the easter egg in the office in FNaF 3

And what you said about the Withereds and the Spring suits you are totally right

So this can means the company are trying to find the owner of that restaurant to know if the springlocks are safe

This can explains why they appears again in FNaF 4, wich shows a Bite, wich shows the Toys figures, wich shows Funtime Foxy figure, wich the teasers has a lot of 87's, every sends to 87, but after November of 87, FNaF 2 gameplay

What can explains the FNaF 2 calls?

We know obviusly they're pre-recorded

This could makes sense (this theory about e drawnings), because in the calls Phone Guy never mentioned the Toys

And the ""new animatronics, new system"" could be just Funtime Foxy and Jay Jay (since Puppet is a marionette, and holy shit the animatronic in the draw is obviusly JJ)

But he mentions the old models, like been the Withereds

Also, forgget about what i said about he dont mentioned the Toys, he said:  

""Uh, so the company decided to go in a whole new direction, and make them super kid-friendly""

He obviusly is talking anout the new versions of they, the Toys!

And he said they created Funtime Foxy in that place after the close down of the last pizzeria to make Foxy more friendly

Sister Location is like impossible to exists before 1993 or 1987, look how futuristic are the animatronics. If Scott made this game in that years, i will kill myself, because is logicly impossible

Just if existed a first and oldest version of Baby and friends, and they turned a sister location of Fazbear Entertaiment like Fredbear's

""There Was Never Just One""

But how Phone Guy said, probably they created Funtime Foxy in that place

And he mentioned the Toys in that phrase

I dont know what to think about it, because we need to solve the story without Sister Location, because originally, this game wouldn't exists, so we need create a timeline wich just involves FNaF 2,3 and 4 (FNaF 1 has a only story about the first five murders, any other game was planned to exists before the phame)

First i made a theory about FNaF 4 is between the FNaF 2 Phone calls and Save Them, and the FNaF 2 gameplay

So, in Save Them we see Golden Freddy being possessed, but how if FNaF 4 didnt happened yet?

That's when Paper Pal Budy enters

He is the most mystery charachter, anyone cold understand why he moves in FNaF 2, like Freddy and Bonnie in FNaF 3

The kid could posssibly him, because fix with the timeline, and solves the problem with the fifth kid in GGGF

The Happiest Day thought could be two thins:

The Happiest Day of the souls to being free, wich is simple

Or the party for the FNaF 4 kid, just for him

Puppet, wich is the Fredbear plushie, makes the party with the others 4 souls and make a good party for the FNaF 4 kid

He wearing the Golden Freddy maks could be a symbolism or something

About Shadow Toy Bonnie and Shadow Withered Freddy being in different colors, could possibly because one mimics a Toy and another possess a Withered, but they have something connected

After that probably the suit was inactive, and Puppet put the kid in that suit, that's why is smelling, because there is a body inside, yes, but how if you says the suit is a hallucination?

And the Endoskeleton is visible in Withered Freddy, the ear and the feets and some Endo parts who we can saw, i tought it was about the endo, but no he has

And the murders is before the calls because Phone Guy said the animatronics are acting strangly, and he creates some theories, but he doesnt know if he is right about it

So

FNaF 2 Murders - FNaF 2 Calls - FNaF 4 - FNaF 2 gameplay

So this makes sense, because in Save Them, Golden Freddy and Puppet are possessed, but how if the bite don't happened yet?",2016-07-21 22:48:12+00:00,d5llofe,4.0,t1_d5lle6s,440.0,fivenightsatfreddys

If you belive it's a restauranto too like me, so this stills a thing

FNaF 2 is in 87, but was locked for investiguations since the summer, and re-opened again in Novemember. between that time, the company focus on Fredbear's V2, Phone Guy said in the calls ""we are looing for the old owner"", to what? Re-open Fredbear's

The bite happens and in november FNaF 2 happens

I belived one time about Mangle did the bite, but for sadnees she didn't. You said Fredbear bite the entire head, well, Phone Guy didn't said it was a bite just in the frontal lobe. The kid could lost his frontal lobe after that bite, but don't means the bite needs happen exactly on the frontal lobe. And no, can't have two bites, since we never saw something about other bite.

And the spring animatronic stills a animatronic. Phone Guy don't said it was a total normal animatronic. Fredbear was in ""robot mode"", the Spring animatronic can be in the suit mode or in the animatronic mode, he was in the animatronic mode, so he do everything what a normal animatronic do. Also, we saw Endo-02 in the backstage, which means he is a normal Endoskeleton for normal animatronics, not by spring animatronics. He probably is used when the animatronic is in the stage, wich could be the thing with Fredbear.

And let's say my proofs:

1. the Toys Figures. Okay, you can say the Toys was based on these figures, like the Classics being based on the plushies. BUT the Chica Beak teaser shows a question ""why the chica beak is out?"", because that's a huge clue about these figures are the toys, wich means 87.

2. Funtime Foxy mangled figure. Okay, the toys can be based on these figures, but makes sense about the figures is based on the Originals (Un-Withereds), right? So why the fuck the company will do a figure about Foxy but white and a kinda female? This don't makes sense! And no, Sister Location can't be in 83 or other year in 1980, because Sister Location is too much futuristic. So that figure needs being based on Funtime Foxy from FNaF 2, this obviusly is in 87.

3. the 87's in HTML's teasers. This is obvius, the only teaser who has ""83"" is the Plushtrap teaser, any other had. Also, the 87 in Nightmare Foxy.

4. Was It's Me? This is obvius too, he is talking about ""i did the bite?"". Don't exists other bite, just in 87

Andi dont get it your question

What do you means ""physically""? You mean he possesses himself?

Well, there is no motives to Puppet dont give him life, but the interesting fact about the kid appearing from nowhere and the head appears means something. We never understood why Golden Freddy is like that, teletransporting and floating. There is proofs he is a real suit, but the people don't care.
 
This thing of being hidden probably to be a easter egg or this means something, like why he has this ""powers"" or something. Puppet could give him life, yeah isn't showed in the minigame, but i see there is something hidden who i can't see about it.

About Happiest Day, iguinore it for *now*, because this is a huge piece to say ""The kid is Golden Freddy and blahblah"", what im trying to talk about it's how this could fix if the kid isn't Golden Freddy.

The timeline is saying, just if Scott isn't telled something to us who can agree with your theory.

About the explaination, i get it.

And about the bodies, yes, obivusly they aren't in the same places who we see in the minigame, could be somewhere or Purple Guy scrapped they.

And no, Golden Freddy isn't a spring suit, and he is already possessed, if he is a spring suit do you think the soul will colaborate?

But, okay, isn't the problem about the kid be Golden Freddy, well it is too, because everything we see in FNaF 1 is a lie.

The question is, if FNaF 2 calls and Save Them are before FNaF 4, how could the kid be Golden Freddy?

I was thinking about what you said about ""they need time to stop the animatronics walking during the day"", and i think isn't like that.

FNaF 4 happened after the place shut down, for investigations.

Well, what we see in Save Them could be two things:

Purple Guy is there because he killed the kids or he will hidden de kids

Purple Guy is there because he is a nightguard

Okay, we don't know about Afton Industries and everything, but i think the ""onwer"" or something important with the industries wouldn't be a nightguard...

Well, iguinore what i said now

So, Purple Guy is in there, for what?

About these kids and the phrase ""Save Them"", he killed the kids

I mean, why Puppet wake up Freddy?

To stop Purple Guy

Well failled

And i was thinking about the cutscenes in that same game

He is awakening the animatronics

Puppet awakes the animatronics

And in the minigame he wake up Freddy to stop Purple Guy, Save Them, but he can't

So this is talking about the murders in the second restaurant

So, like Phone Guy said before, the animatronics was a kinda strange with the adults and about they walking during the night

Like i said in the post, he said is about system fails or night modes, but he said ""i don't sure""

So is obviusly possessing

So Save Them before this night

And in Night 1, the bite doesn't happened yet

Also, probably the place wasn't opened yet

They said Fredbear's was looked for years, and they was looking for the owner

Looking for the owner, FNaF 4... They want to re-open the restaurant

So if Fredbear's isn't opened yet, if the bite didn't happened, if Golden Freddy is moving (sometimes when you start the minigame he is in different places, can be in the hallway or in the backroom)....

This means Save Them before FNaF 4

And if you say about the murders is in Night 5-6, my point stills up, because in that calls he talks about Fredbear's being closed

The point is, what Happiest Day represents if the kid isn't Golden Freddy?

Is probably hidden in the others minigames from FNaF 3

We should look more what the cake represents and why Scott choose that animatronics

And probably, we need to iguinore Happiest Day and the Birthday and look for more

I know, a lot of similarities, the end is the stage, the exit it's the party, the masked kids are the night 3 kids, the kids are the bullies, and Puppet is Fredbear Plushie helping him...

I'm not. Why are you?""

I can, you can

Just because is AU don't means we can use to proofs somethings

Like a second proof, who isnt so strong because is AU, but is important to think about it

And yes, Give Gifts is what i dont talked about, and makes sense about what you said

But still can't explains Go Foxy

Seriusly, Scott don't is like Kane, what is there is in there, isn't a metaphorical thing showing the four originals plus Puppet

And what we read in the newspapers fix a lot with Go Foxy, this place is probably the same of FNaF 1, and where he is running is the way for the backroom

And like i said, just because the bodies are in blindspots doesnt means the police could look for the place to find the bodies

In the hallway is anything to hidden one body, is like you go with that way and boom! There is a bodie sit on the wall

They should pass the hallway to get in the office, how they dont saw the bodie?

In Give Gifts we saw Golden Freddy in the last second

But there is something interesting, when the kid appears, the jumpscare happens

And if we pause like 2 seconds, we gonna see the Withered Golden Freddy is the ""mask"" of that kid

This could means Puppet dont gived life to Golden Freddy, but the soul gived life to himself

We dont know if Golden Freddy is a ghost or a suit, but in anyways, he has this ""powers"" of teletransportation and floating

He is kinda different to the others, he is more powerfull

So i think Puppet gived life for the four and the fifth kid could gived life to himself, that's could explain why he is ""powefull""

yeah, a curiosity is the bodies is hidden in camera blind points, but this cant means they police dont looked the entire restaurant to find it

And this can't explains the fifth kid in Go Foxy and Michael in TSE

Because like Scott said, TSE is based on the games, and FNaF 1 explains about the first murders, and the murder of the fifth kid, who turns to Golden Freddy and in the book is Michael

I know TSE is AU, but he said the book has similarities like the games, this couldnt be one of them?

""And Purple Man is taller than Withered Freddy, although Withered Freddy is fucking huge. Withered Chica's sprite looks nothing like her actual model.""

Truth, but like i said, is impossible to the sister made the exactly model of Mangle, and also, is totally mangled on the floor, is isnt acctually build it

But Nightmare Mangle has some things differents to Normal and Phantom Mangle, so probably Nightmare Mangle is based on the toy, but the original and the phantom arent

""It's the mask of Mangle.""

Mangle isnt a charachter, Mangle is Funtime Foxy but mangled

If the pphantoms are really hallucinations based on the masks in the box, so he should created a Phantom (Funtime) Foxy in his mind isntead of a Phantom Mangle

""Because he's REAL. He has a child drawing of him, GF is a real suit, we're hallucinating of that suit. Mike hallucinates of his younger brother that died in 87. Not the suit, because the physical suit wasnt in 1.""

I was talk about the ""green sticks"" on that draw, wich means bad smell, so means he is a real suit too, because, hallucinations dont smells :P

Well, there is achance to what we see in FNaF 2 is the suit himself and the souls trying to control him

And about his jumpscare, isnt a heart attack like the Classic, he is literally coming for you

And, yes in the Thank You image he is, but in game i dont think he is gigaint, for me he is totally normal

a plushie of Golden Freddy!

Means what? Merchandise

The company knew it about him, but how?

Because they created him, and maked merchandise to promove him

But okay, we see the boxes with the Toys and the hook of Withered Foxy

Well, in FNaF 2 final newspaper said the old models was having a transformation to be the Classics, so probably the hook of Foxy is there because isnt more good to use, and they used other parts

Thats can explain probably why Phantom Freddy probably dont have a leg, a leg of the Withered Golden Freddy (or of the Withered Freddy) is in the box!

""Don't judge accuracy of minigame sprites please. Just don't. It's obvious that's Mangle and you know it.""

(Also, i agree with you, the Classics in FNaF 3 looks more like the Originals :P)

""We see his physical form there, HE IS THERE. He even has a reflection.""

But how if the mask is in the wall? He has two masks?

"" Phantom Freddy too as Phantom Freddy is GF, and GF is who the bite victim becomes.""

Well there is a problem here...

FNaF 2 calls happened in summer, before FNaF 2

Phone Guy said abot Fredbears being closed for years and they are searching the old onwer

to? re-open the place! FNaF 4!

So, FNAF 2 tapes is before FNaF 2 and FNaF 4

Phone Guy said someone stolled a yellow suit in the back, and in the next day they have a party

This means? Murders! Save Them!

And in this minigame, Golden Freddy is already having his ""ghost powers"" or something

But how if the FNaF 4 kid and the Bite of 87 didnt happened?

Also, if you say the Svae Them is after FNaF 4, nop

Because the Toys arent moving

Well Mangle is moving, but dont in the restaurant...

And BB is missing

So the bite didnt happened yet, so...

BLOWMIND the kid isnt Golden Freddt AND he cant be Puppet too 

Well, my theory says the 5 Phantoms are the Toys souls, wich makes sense, because every Toy has his form in Phantom version

But Toy Bonnie don't, why?

Because the community loves Foxy too much?

Also, rememebr Adventure Phantom Foxy loading screen?

""One more Foxy isnt too much"" or something like that

So... i think this explains

and the sixth, Puppet, who we see in Bad ENding he isnt with the Classics, like a shinning mask in the back hidden like Golden Freddy

So, probably in Good Ending, when the souls is free, his mask isnt there too

So means he stills in the earht, with the toys souls, to revenge their deaths and take care of Springtrap and finishi him for all

Probably he made the fire, but didnt worked so much :P

3143,"Golden Freddy is his name

Also, the Golden Freddy you're talking about in Stage 01 is Spring Freddy

Let'me explain

Fredbear was created

After that they created the five animatronics, Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and Cupcake

After that they created Freddy's, with Spring Freddy, SpringBonnie and Golden Cupcake

This Spring Freddy can't be other Fredbear, because he was based on Original Freddy from Fredbear &amp; Friends, but the color and the spring mechanism by Fredbear

After that, these two restaurants closed

And the ""replacements"" could ne the Originals or just costumes of Freddy and Bonnie (drawnings of FNaF 3 office)

But anyways, the second Freddy's was created, with the Originals

And they created Golden Freddy, based on Spring Freddy but without the spring mechanism

Probably he was created to be a replacement of Freddy sometimes, or for one day to use him based on Spring Freddy

I'm saying about Golden Freddy is a suit because in FNaF 2 we have his plushie

What this means? Merchandise

Merchandise by the company

But why if the Golden Freddy is a ""hallucination"" like the people says?

Because he isn't

He is a real suit

Well, now you want to my explaination about his hallucinations (FNaF 1) and his power of teletransportation and floating (FNaF 2)

Because he is a ghost

Well, half suit half ghost

Why? People says because he don't has Endoskeleton, so that's is the away to the soul of the child moves

But his Withered form looks like he has a Endo inside him, so probably because...

 The soul is too strong and powerlles like Puppet?

About the Classic version, can be a total ghost, or a half suit and half ghost, because there is a possibilitie to the company remaked him too like the Withereds...

So that's it, Spring Freddy, Fredbear and Golden Freddy aren't the same charachter",2016-07-08 02:08:25+00:00,d53pem7,5.0,t1_d53p1lr,570.0,fivenightsatfreddys

3145,"Because is obviusly

First the names

Fredbear and Golden Freddy

Golden Freddy is a Freddy, like Withered Freddy, Shadow Freddy, Phantom Freddy...

But Fredbear is Fredbear, he just have Nightmafre Fredbear and Shadow Fredbear (and the Adventures)

Second, the color of the bowties and the hats

Fredbear has purple bowtie and hat, Golden Freddy has black bowtie and hat

Is simple but important

Plushies

These two charachters has they own plushies, with the same differences

Fourth, the designs

Fredbear is fat (or chubby), and he is a spring animatronic

Golden Freddy is like Freddy, but just golden, and don't have spring mechanism

I think this explains everything",2016-07-08 01:39:49+00:00,d53oafi,3.0,t1_d53o3zv,276.0,fivenightsatfreddys

Is obviusly 87! The girl with the toys explains that!

Or Golden Freddy isnt Fredbear

If you belive about Golden Freddy being a hallucination or a ghost or a suit, well, ok

But the people needs understand about Golden Freddy isnt Fredbear, because obivusly, bowties and hats, and their designs

Okay, second thing

Stage 01 isn't Fredbear's

Is the place who Phone Guy is talking, the first Freddy's

The sister location he is talking is Fredbear &amp; Friends, who happen the springlock incident

The FNaF 4 location is Fredbear's, but re-created, like you said, they are trying to contact the owner, why? Re-open Fredbear's

He dont said Was, just said Propety of Me

3163,"Okay, im seeing what you're talking about

In things of businesses, yes you're right

But this isn't chnages the fact about (i will say again and the last time) FREDBEAR SAID IN THE PRESENT

He dont said ""It Was By Me"" or other thing

Its my Propety

Its mine, stills mine, and will be mine

Also, about the Comapny being called Fazbear is a good point

Lets remember FFD

They created the first animatronic: Fredbear

And after they created the secundaries: Freddy and his guang

We know Freddy secind name is Fazbear's

But after that the company created FFP

Wich was a partner restaurant

But like Phone Guy said, the principal restaurant is FFD

So why the company is called Fazbear if the restaurant called FFD has the first animatronic called Fredbear?

Exists a chance to Fredbear second name being Fazbear too, still a chance

""Youre straw-gaspping"" yes i am, but seriusly this makes sense a lot

They are bears, same family, family, name, Fazbear, makes sense

Well, after the death of FFD, Freddy assumes the restaurant and its the new ""favorite child"" of the company, makes sense

In terms of businesses, yes FFP has FFD now

BUT we cant forgget Nightmare Fredbear phrase ""Its my propety""

HE IS SAYING NOW, DONT IN THE PAST

But, now FFP has the propety of FFD, but Nightmare Fredbear says other thing...

This means FFP will open the restaurant with the name FFD

Also, let's remember, okay Scott delete the ER...

But why he put if isn't wrong?

And yes, obviusly e springlock incident was before FNaF 2 

But i will say again: the main charachter changes a lot

Oh okay let's open a restaraunt!

We have the original charachters, Freddy and his guang, and we can use they to make happiness again and they will no more being abandoned more!

Or we have the dangerous charachter who isnt Freddy, and he has spring mechanism who killed two guys in the past! 

So why the heck they used Fredbear and Spring Bonnie?

Because they are trying to re-create FFD!

Phone Guy said in FNaF 2:

We are trying to contact with the owner of thr original location

Remember! The FNaF 2 was recorded in the summer, before FNaF 2!

So they are trying to find the owner, to what? Recreate FFD!

But if the restaurant is with Fredbear and everything:

So why dont put the old name?

There is a problem? No any problem!

So why is too much nescessary to put FFP if dont makes so much sense? Okay makes, because Fredbear is a Fazbear!

But he isnt Freddy

It's to much nescessary to the restaurant being called FFP? No there is nothing

They will don't lose the propety or something, is just the old restaurant, isnt other franchise of FFP

Well, is kinda, but isnt the same name :P

You say it doesn't matter if he is saying is his propety

Well matters a lot

If he is saying ""its my propety"" so its his propety, Scott don't put they for nothing

Like the ER thing, could be a error or something

And yes, Fredbear being the main charachter changes a lot

And also, i remember now, where did you see about FFP has everything?

Because i never saw that

Okay, FFD was dead after the springlock incident

But this means the propety is pass to FFP? No!

The propety still by Fazbear Company, Fazbear Entertaiment has the propety of the two restaurant, isnt FFP who has everything

Okay, he was the only restaurant by the comoany, because FFD was dead

But remember, what if they are trying to re-open this restaurant?

Isn't a bad idea! They are using springlocks again!

So why is the problem to the restaurant being called FFD?

Because, Fazbear Entertaiment has the propety, don't FFP, just because FFD don't exists more this don't means FFP has everything

And i will say again: **Fredbear can't be the main chatarachter of a restaurant wich isn't in his name**

He is the main charachter, he has the propety, this don't makes sense if FFP is the name

Yes this means a lot, if you enters in the Burguer King to see Ronald McDonald, just because Burger King buyed MC Donalds, this has some sense? Of course not!

If the restaurant is FFP, they create another Freddy, its simple

They could use the Withered Freddy and the Withereds to create another FFP! They dont have spring mechanism to put people in danger!

But no, they are using spring mechanism, they are using Fredbear again

No! The propety still by FFD!

But look, like KFC and Pizza Hut, they are by the same company, so dont makes sense if one restaurant has another if the company has the two restaurants, they can do whatever they wants

And like i said, dont makes sense Fredbear being the main charachter of a FFP restaurant, and will never do if FFP owns FFD, because Fredbear and Freddy are different charachters, just if they changed his name

Why the teaser of IndieDB dont has the ER more? I don't know! Error probably?

But still dont makes sense, Fredbear said ""its my propety"", dont is propoety of Freddy, is propety of Fredbear, FFD, and this cant change

Pizza Hut don't owns KFC just because he is more popular and has more money

#FINALLY SOMEONE AGREES WITH ME

Also, in FNaF World, the Adventure Fredbear loading screen said ""the first""

And no, this can be used for a theory, isn't just because is uncanon because we can't use

And also, yes, the minigame TKTTC is possibly F&amp;F(or FFD V2), because the animatronic is Original Freddy, we see his same head in the GGGL

So possibly, 73 was just Fredbear, and probably 83 they created the other guys and the show

Because isn't normal a show has the phrase ""since 1983"" probably that's for the restaurant, so probably they changed the name FFD for F&amp;F

And after that, they created FFP, who has the other three guys 

And possibly after that, F&amp;F (or FFD with the name changed for the show and the new charachters) they created they own Spring Bonnie (because we need him to the Springlock Incident, because Shadow Bonnie)

This is wrong, Fredbear is a springlock suit, he needs to has 5 fingers

And i know why you said that, because the image of his hand in the backstage (i know the hand image, but im to lazy to put the link here)

But if you see, there is a five finger hidden in the hand, because the finger and one part of the hand have the same colors, so is like we see just four fingers, but if we look better, is like impossible don't see the five finger there

About the Adventure models, yes you can use a evidence, don't is nescessary to be canon or not, but...

Adventure Withered Freddy has the same models like the two guys, and they aren't the same model in the original universe

Fredbear don't have brown eyes, i know, the minigame shows that, like Spring Bonnie (02) shows yellow eyes too, but in FNaF World, they have blue and green eyes

But we don't know the color of the eyes of Golden Freddy when he was created, so if Endo-02 is his Endoskeleton, so he has blue eyes too...

And the Thank you image of Classic Golden Freddy is just a recolor of a jumpscare of Classic Freddy in the first game, his eyes are official black with white eyes, Scott is 2 lazy

Fredbear plushie who we see in the minigames is hautend, the original plushie don't have this white eyes, possibly has blue eyes too

But is officialy confirmed about the plushie of Golden Freddy has white eyes, why? We dont know...

Fredbear has grey teeth in the minigames... And?

Possibly this is a error of color, like his eyes...

Nightmare Fredbear has a counterpart, but Golden Freddy IS the counterpart :p

I dont get it the teaser being a evidence

The 1 9 8 7 custom night is a good thing, but Fredbear wasn't created after FNaF 2, like Shadow Bonnie and every other charachter, so possibly this don't counts...

To get the Good Ending minigame, we need complete the Happiest Day, wich means they have some connection

But the kid story is different to the dead kids story, but why this is connected with the Good Ending if the Happiest Day shows other end of other story?

And i don't know if the FNaF 3 guard is Mike...

Yes, but is possible to know

In case, Go Go Foxy has te Pirate Cove, so possibly could be the restaurant of the Originals

Save Them shows a murder, and in the tapes of FNaF 2, Phone Guy said the police is in the local, so a murder happened in there

Also, i don't agree the floating head and his ""power"" of teletransport are hallucinations, is him, but different

Also, the Withered Golden Freddy jumpscare is like he attacking you

But, when you said he is a suit and real, i automatic i loved you

But heres the thing: what Happiest Day really represents?

Because, this game shows the good ending, the good ending for the souls

Dont makes sense if this is the good ending for the FNaF 4 kid, because his things is different to the souls things

He is just a kid who died by his brother, and the souks wants revenge by a son of a bitch who killed they

the kid can't be Golden Freddy

I will see two possibilites: FNaF 2 and the Phone Guy tapes are in different times, and the other who actually he is calling to Jeremy

First: Different times

Phone Guy said the robots still walking in the day, and Fredbear's still not opened, because he said the restaurant still closed, but the company is looking for the owner

In that time, happened the killing of the children who possess the Toys, wich is the minigame Save Them. In that minigame, we see Withered Golden Freddy moving, wich is they are possessed. But how, if the kid of FNaF 4 isn't still death yet?

Also, how explain de minigame Go Go Go Foxy with 5 kids dead, if the kid of FNaF 4 is Golden Freddy, the fifthy kid from this minigame is what?

Second: FNaF 2 and the tapes in the same time

Ok, now, how Phone Guy said, the Bite happened in the 6 or 5 night call, because the company is looking for the owner of Fredbear's, and the police is in there

But the murders happened before Jeremy get the job, because, the Toys are trying to kill him, they are posses yet, back again to Save Them minigame, wich NEEDS be before FNaF 2 gameplay, but Withered Golden Freddy is moving, but the Bite happened in the night 5 or 6, but Save Them is before FNaF 2....

They created the four Spring animatronic: Fredbear, Spring Freddy, Spring Bonnie and Toy Spring Bonnie

Remember the springlock failures?

So, we don't know what happened, but if the Shadows theory is correct, after the death of the employees in the suits, maybe the company Fazbear stopped to make negociations with Afton Robotics, and possibly after that, the company closed

Look, i don't speak english, will be hard to explain but yeah

So, the second head isn't the extra part we see in her, we have the second hand (FF has one hand and a hook) and a third eye (appears in the floor in Kid's Cove)

So, okay, if we have two eyes with the same color (one in the head) and a hand WICH is the same color too, so that parts are extra parts of her

My ""straw-gaspping"" is the employees put more parts on her, because this ""extra parts"" are impossible to fixed, like the Head, wich don't have more ears

Look, i know what Phone Guy said, but like i said, the restaurant could be re-open AFTER these tapes of FNaF 2

Is obviusly 87 because the TOYS FIGURES

And the Fredbear &amp; Friends is a FREDBEAR RESTAURANT, ok, have the name Friends and the Originals, but Fredbear still the main charachters

In FNaF 4 restaurant, is just Fredbear and Toy Spring Bonnie, isn't there any other aniamtronic, except the Shadows

And is impossible exists two Freddy's opened in the same year or something like that

The restaurant of FNaF 4 isn't the sister location, yes i know that, but it is F&amp;F, because Phone Guy said Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria, he is in the Freddy's, and isn't in other restaurant, so the only possible ways is the F&amp;F or the FFD

But we know, the FNaF 4 location isn't the sister location, because is in 87, so who is the sister location?

3740,"I'm confused now, what are you trying to say?

If the sister location talked in FNaF 3 tapes is the FNaF 4 restaurant, is wrong

Because like i said, he says ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria"", so is impossible, because the main charachter of the FNaF 4 restaurant is Fredbear, and isn't Freddy or other version of him

The game says that animatronic is Fredbear, also in one teaser, the purple hat, says ""Propety of Fredbear's Family Diner"", and in the second teaser, of Nightmare Fredbear, says ""Propety of me""

The only Spring animatronic who is a Freddy is Spring Freddy, and he appears in Stage 01

Fredbear &amp; Friends is a restaurant who, obviusly by the name, Fredbear us the main charachters, and the other 5 charachters gang is his friends: Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Cupcake and Foxy

After that, the F&amp;F restaurant closed, and the gang turns the Freddy's gang, wich obviusly, Freddy is the main charachter

After that happened FNaF 2

So, back again about the tapes, if the tapes is in the Fredbear's location, this is impossible, because the tapes say ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria"", wich means the sister location is F&amp;F or FFD

And like i said, this tapes aren't in the FNaF 2 location, or the FNaF 1 location, because they have Spring suits, and these restaurants don't has

So, if we don't know any restaurant CALLED FREDDY's with Spring suits, so possibly, existed a restaurant called Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria before the Originals gang comes out of F&amp;F, wich is the Stage 01 place

And remember, a Fredbear suit can't be in a Freddy's location or a Freddy can't be in a Fredbear's location

The only place who happen is Fredbear &amp; Friends, but the name is F&amp;F, and isn't Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria, how Phone Guy said in the tapes

Because, we cant let it go some things, like this

I will force you to belive Fredbear did the bite, if you want how i get this answer and why he did, you can ask for me my theory

But im happy you still strong, because the community forces to the people belives what they want, like Golden Freddy is a hallucination, because for me, isnt, but the community wants to you belive is, like Fredbear did the bite of 87 or 83, and the 83 case is totally stupid

Is the fact about Nightmare Fredbear shows a totally different design

If we goes in that way, Fredbear is more chubby than Golden Freddy

Also, there is two restaurants, one with Fredbear, and the other with Freddy in main charachter

The Stage 01 shows the first Freddys, with Spring Freddy and Spring Bonnie

Fredbears was the first restaurant of all, with Fredbear, and after the opening of Freddys, they took the idea of a new Bonnie and created another Spring Bonnie

The proves in FNaF World and in the minigames shows that

Also, Fredbear is a spring suit, Golden Freddy isnt

Spring Freddy is a Freddy with the spring mechanism, based on Freddy and Fredbear of Fredbear and Friends

Is like more obvius that, because if Nightmare Fredbear is a Freddy, why he dont have the same design of Nightmare Freddy? Like just a recolor like Golden Freddy

Merchandise of him, makes him real, so my ultra straw-gaspping is he is a animatronic based on Spring Freddy, but with the same design of Original Freddy, of course without the spring mechanism

But what we see in FNaF 2, is a half ghost and half real, because he is possessed, but is like a ghost, but is real

About the book, ok is AU, but the community needs to stop, is AU? Who cares! Has parts who is like the original universe, answers

We cant iguinore just because is AU, its needs to has a attetion

The book gives answers about why Purple Guy was arrested and why we still seeying him in the games: There is no clues or facts to put him in the jail

Is the same thing with FNaF World, he has somethings, like saying Fredbear was the first animatronic, this needs has a attetion, dont just iguinore just because is AU

About the employee, why he is trying to kill us? There is no fact! The kid is trying to run of Fredbear, he dont know is a man in the suit!

The employee maybe is walking on the restaurant, or something, but there is no facts to say he will kill us

About Fredbear plushie, he dont have fear of the animatronics, yes i know that, but he said ""Run for your life"" because maybe he thinks the man will kill you. We just now there is one killer, why a normal guy is trying to kill us? I dont understand.

But things i still dont get it:

""Okay at this point I'm done with you. You obviously didn't bother reading my post most likely as the first thing I even wrote was me saying it was NOT Fredbear's.
""I never said they take place in Fredbear's Family Diner.
I even mentioned the fact he has merchandise of the Pre-Withereds, and how tiny toys of said prewithereds exist too.""

I read your text, and the only thing i understood is the tapes was recorded in Fredbear's, but i still cant understand about the pre-withereds, and toys, i dont get it

""Sorry but this part makes absolutely zero sense to me. The Spring Bonnie suit is the FFP one, which is true cause the FNAF4 minigames is a FFP, but apparently it cant be there because it's in Fredbears? Fredbears was years before the FFP. It's probably closed for good at that point""

Im saying the Spring Bonnie suit who we see in the floor could be the Pre-Springtrap suit, from Freddy's, and that Freddy's im saying is the first, with Spring Freddy too

But in the post (what i get it) you said that Fredbear's was in 87, right? So how you said Fredbear's is totally before Freddy's?

3987,"About Spring Bonnie is the suit who was tooked, is because the suit is in Fredbear's

But we don't see the suit in the backstage, just with Purple Guy, stuffing someone....

Could be a employee? Could, but could be a kid? Possibly too! 

But yes, this is straw-gaspping, but the fact of his sprite is looks too much similar with Spring Bonnie (Freddy's), the only problem is the ears, who has three folds too, but looks like two too, so it's a problem

But about the Fredbear suit is in the FNaF 2 restaurant could be possibly too!

But i dont think the suit who Purple Guy used is the same we see with the employee.

There is 2 suits of Fredbear with we count (or maybe just one), but that suits is from Fredbear's, is there for the robots.

But the kid maybe saw a murder, but we dont know what murder was

Could be the first five childrens? I dont think, because that happened in Freddy's V2, in 85-86 (because Pirate Cove), or could be Fredbear &amp; Friends too!!

But after the book, is like confirmed about Purple Guy used the Fredbear suit to kill the childrens

And thats why the kid is afraid of Fredbear, because he see it Fredbear killing children, with Purple Guy inside, and thinks is Fredbear the real monster

But if the Spring Bonnie suit who we see in the easter egg is the suit of Freddy's, soo is the suit who was in FNaF 2 location, because that suit can't be there, because is the Fredbear's location

But if was Fredbear, so its another story....

But i dont get it why you think the tapes are recorded in Fredbear's, is like obviusly was recorded in Freddy's, because Prize Corner things and the Toys, and i dont think Phone Guy recorded somethings and is saying other things in live...

The man who is wearing the Fredbear suit is just a employee, he isn't trying to kill you or something, and the kid thinks Fredbear will kill him

About Fredbear plushie, maybe he thinks like the kid, about the employee will kill him, and that's why he said to run

But something interesting i noticed, remember what you said about ""the hair in the fredbear body suit""?

I dont think that is hair, could be just stuffing or something part of the suit (i forggot the word)

But if that is hair, and the employee who we see in the easter egg is a kid...

Could be that kids and what the kid saw...

3989,"Yeah, but in 1983 (or 84), we have the first Freddy's, who cames with the first Spring Bonnie

After that, possibly Fredbear &amp; Friends came with the second Spring Bonnie, and that's the SB who we see in Fredbear's

I think is nescessary to we has the second Spring Bonnie because Shadow Bonnie 

I know this theory about ""spring lock incident"" couldnt be the death of two guards in that costumes, but we see in Shadow Bonnie minigame, he has three ears folds, so the second Spring Bonnie is the suit who the guard died

About the 84 year, is because we dont see that Spring Bonnie in the commercial, so probably he came after with the first Spring Bonnie

But i know and agree about Bonnie needs exist before Spring Bonnie, because the names

But Fredbear's Family Dinner could be before Fredbear &amp; Friends

No im not talking about the restaurant in FNaF 4, im talking about the first Fredbear's, the first restaurant, who only has Fredbear

So this is how i think:

Fredbear's Family Dinner - (75-80??) Fredbear

Fredbear &amp; Friends - (83) Fredbear, Originals (Un-Withereds) and Cupcake

Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria - (83-84??) Spring Freddy, Spring Bonnie, Golden Cupcake

Fredbear &amp; Friends - (83-84??) Same restaurant but with the new Spring Bonnie

After that Fredbear &amp; Friends clossed because the Spring Lock incident, and the main charachters (Fredbear and ""Toy"" Spring Bonnie) can't be used

In the Freddy's, they stop using Spring Freddy and Spring Bonnie, and put the Originals to replacemant, and created Golden Freddy to be a replacement of Freddy sometimes

I knew it about the tiny toy chica, the 87 on the teasers and everything, and i still think FNaF 4 happened in the Summer of 87!

But....

I dont agree about the tapes happened in the Fredbear's

Because Phone Guy mentioned in the first night ""welcome the to you new summer job at the new and improved **Freddy Fazbear's Pizza**""

He automaticly says the restaurant is the Freddy's

Also, he mentioned the Toys, why if he works in a other restaurant?

""There's a music box over by the Prize Corner""

Well, after he said about the Prize Corner, so he can't be in the Fredbear's

About the company trying to contact the owner of Fredbear's, maybe because:

Or the Bite happened

Or They Are Trying To Re-open The Restaurant


Well, i dont know about that, just about one thing:

In the Night 6, Phone Guy says someone took a yellow suit, that suit is Spring Bonnie (Freddy's)

Why? Because Purple Guy appears in the FNaF 4 with the Spring Bonnie suit!!!

Why Fredbear's have that suit if they have his suit? (Toy Spring Bonnie)

I think Purple Guy took the suit, kill the kids in the FNaF 2, runned to the FNaF 4 place. After that, the restauran closed. The Bite occured, and in november they re-open the FNaF 2 restaurant.

Remember in the newspaper? ""Grand Re-Opening""

But i really liked your theory ;)",2016-05-29 13:48:21+00:00,d3o0d4f,1.0,t3_4ljok0,20229.0,fivenightsatfreddys

4269,"Well i said ""Toy Spring Bonnie"" the Spring Bonnie from Fredbear's, because is difficult difference him to the other Spring Bonnie, so i put Toy

Well, your timeline isn't a complet absurde, makes sense if you look good...

But about Spring Freddy is because Golden Freddy wasn't a Spring aniamtronic, because his design (the designs are important) isn't like Springtrap, which is a Spring animatronic

About the name ""Spring Freddy' is because we really don't know his true names, but about Spring Bonnie makes sense if his names being with Spring too

Heres my timeline:

Fredbear's Familly Dinner (V1) - Just Fredbear

(Close/evolved to open a new restaurant)

Fredbear &amp; Friends - Fredbear, Original Freddy, Original Bonnie, Original Chica, Cupcake and Orignal Foxy

Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria (V1) - Spring Freddy, Spring Bonnie and Golden Cupcake

Fredbear &amp; Friends - Same location but with now Toy Spring Bonnie

(F&amp;F and FFP V1 close because the Spring Locks faillures, and rumors to a muder in F&amp;F)

Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria (V2) - Original Freddy, Original Bonnie, Original Chica, Cupcake, Original Foxy, Original Golden Freddy, Jay Jay and Puppet

(Close because the muders)

Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria (V3) - Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, Toy Cupcake, Funtime Foxy, Balloon Boy and Puppet

(Closes about the second muders and possibly the Originals [maybe the Toys too] with the children bodies insides)

Fredbear's Familly Dinner (V2) - Fredbear and Toy Spring Bonnie

Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria (V3) - Re-opens (FNaF 2 gameplay)

(FFP V3 closses about the Toys with bad fuctions, and possibly FFD V2 clossed because the Bite of 87)

Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria (V4) - Classic Freddy, Classic Bonnie, Classic Chica, Cupcake, Classic Foxy and Classic Golden Freddy

(Restaurant closses because don't exits more people who likes the restaurant, after this [possibly the same year or 1995] Purple Guys comes and is killed by the souls of the first Crying Childs)

Fazbear's Fright - Springtrap

(The place get burned because mystery reasons [possibly Puppet])

4270,"Well, Fredbear was the first animatronic in the series

But we actually know about a other version o Fredbear, just the Nightmare and Shadow

But i can say Golden Freddy isn't Fredbear

Well, 99% of the Reddit belives Golden Freddy is a ghost, actually he is, but he was made by the company

He is half suit half ghost

Why? Because his plushie in FNaF 2

That is other thing who is the difference with Fredbear

The plushies

And other thing:

Fredbear's Design

I made a theory about Fredbear is actually fat, but 70% of the Reddit call the theory ""stupid"", but about Fredbear's design is a proof to make his difference with Golden Freddy

Now you're confusing about ""Spring Freddy""

Well for me i don't really know if he exits or not, but kets say exits becuasw FNaF 3 phones calls blah blah blah...

Well, backing about Golden Freddy is a suit, we have a explaination about why he was made it

First came Fredbear

Second came Freddy

Third Came Spring Freddy 

Fourth came Golden Freddy

Freddy was made to be a partner of Fredbear, probably

And the company makes a new restaurante, based on Freddy and Bonnie, but with the Spring mechanism

After they, came Toy Spring Bonnie to Fredbear &amp; Friends, after the two restaurants closed because the spring lock faillures....

So they made Golden Freddy, to be like Spring Freddy but without the spring mechanism

Probably Golden Freddy was a partnert to Freddy (like Freddy to Fredbear) or was a suit if Freddy gets problems, or they made and never used....

4313,"Well, i think that animatronic isn't Golden Freddy

Okay he is fat, but after 90% of the fandom trying to make me a slave of this theory, i think i agree saying that animatronic is Spring Freddy

But if he is Spring Freddy (or Original Golden Freddy), he isn't posses yet

Because i have this timeline

Fredbear's V1

Fredbear &amp; Friends

Freddy's V1

Fredbear &amp; Friends (with now Toy Spring Bonnie)

Freddy's V2


Well, so much probably the kids died in the Freddy's V2 (place with the Originals + Puppet and Jay Jay), because in the minigame Go Foxy we se the kids death

But Stage 01 is in Freddy's V1, so how could be Spring Freddy possess after the death of the 5th Crying Child?

But makes sense saying he could be Fredbear, because this 5th Crying Child is dead in the minigame of Go Foxy, so how could 2 souls to the same animatronic?

Makes sense your theory! But if doesn't existed this 5th Crying Child, makes sense saying the FNaF 4 Child could be Golden Freddy

Besides, like you said, we don't know now what mask are in the Happiest Day, Fredbear or Golden Freddy?

But anyway, the Spring Lock incident possible create the Shadows, and the Shadows mimics Fredbear and Toy Spring Bonnie in FNaF 3 and 4

So much probably he was talking about Fredbear &amp; Friends

Also he says ""the central location""

So if Fredbear's was the first restaurant, and evolved to turn Fredbear &amp; Friends, so Fredbear &amp; Friends is the sister location, the central location

And in the minigame Go Go Go Foxy, we see the Pirate Cove

Well, we never see the Pirate Cove in Fredbear's (FNaF 4, because is probably Fredbear &amp; Friends was in that location), so is probably about the muders was happen in FNaF 1 location...

The Shadows, the Shadow Spring Bonnie and Shadow Fredbear

I know you gonna say WTF again, but i will explain

We really don't know how the Shadows existed

The only way who they can existed is the Spring Lock incident, who maybe happen in Fredbear &amp; Friends (or if you belive is a cartoon, Fredbear's V1) and the employees died

We see Shadows in FNaF 4, so maybe they are the Shadow animatronics, and they are mimicking Fredbear and Toy Spring Bonnie, so makes sense the employees died in the suit

Also i don't think soo the ""two children from the newspaper"" are the shadows, or they are Paper Pal Freddy and Paper Pal Bonnie, or they are the same children who died with the other 3 (or 2) children

So if the Sister Location who Phone Guy mentioned is the who happened the Spring Lock incident, so probably is the who born the Shadows

4670,"Well.. I made a theory about that :p

The poster is because, that's a hallucination

Well is him in the poster, but he is creating the hallucination, his real form is when he appears in the office

And he isn't the only who make this! Puppet make this too (when he is coming to you and his face and body appears in the cameras in FNaF 2 and when he appears in FNaF 3 in his normal form)

And the gigaint head is because he don't have Endoskeleton, and the is only the soul is controlling him, and he can't controll a lot of parts in the same time, so he controlls the head and the mouth and attack you

But maybe he has, because a lot of images explain his body (In FNaF 2 and 1) has a Endo, so maybe is because he is Real and is a Ghost

Isn't like the Shadows, Golden Freddy was created by humans (than he appears in the wall of the office with the draw of Jay Jay), but when the soul possess him, he have a lot of power (like Puppet), and turns into a Real Animatronic and a Ghost

But maybe Classic Golden Freddy is just a ghost mimic Classic Freddy, but i have 100% sure his Withered form isn't a real ghost",2016-04-23 02:08:18+00:00,d2duoly,8.0,t1_d2dtqhw,1662.0,fivenightsatfreddys

But he is different to the Withered form, he is more... Old you now? Is the color

So this is his ""Phantom Form"" or something like that? I don't know

I just saying is imposible Golden Freddy appears in FNaF 3, if the real ending is the Bad Ending, if is the Good Ending, the Phantoms are the Toy Souls, and is impossible to being 7 Phantoms (5 Toys Souls + Puppet soul), but is possible Shadow Freddy turn into a ""Phantom"", but i don't see his eyes like to Springtrap or the Phantoms.

5310,"*clap* *clap* *clap*

I want to talk to :P

So, lets start

Yeah totally agree about this, and when i see in the first time this bite, i never agree that is the bite of 87.

So, to make this theory a truth, i will put more facts that why its dont the bite of 87.

First of all, everyone says the child is Golden Freddy or the Paper Pal Budy, well, okay...

So, if he is Paper Pal Budy, this cant be the bite of 87, because in FNaF 2 he is already possessed, so FNaF 4 cant be after FNaF 2

Ok, but Golden Freddy? Yeah, the bite can be in the day of night 6, because he just appear in that night, and the phone guy talks about blah blah blah...

BUT he said the FFD is already closed, so Golden Freddy is already possessed BEFORE the night 1!

And thats why the Toys is in no more function, cause one of them is a responsable to the bite of 87...

Toy Cupcake



Nope, Mangle, of course.

So, one of the new animatronics is a responsable of a accident, and thats why they are discarced, and why the Originals are back in 1993...

So, yeah, the bite of 87 is from Mangle, and no more!",2016-03-03 02:54:46+00:00,d0lkkq0,1.0,t3_48pxit,1131.0,fivenightsatfreddys

The minigames, the bullies has similarities to the 5th night minigame, but the childrens in the 5th minigame is his friends, killed, cause Purple Guy.

5324,"""Four Game. One story""
Because in the livestream, MatPat and his friend are talk about the FNaF 4 is a different history, or something i forggot.
But anyways, the four games are the same history.

""What is seen in the shadows is easily misunderstood in the mind of child.""
For me its a reference from the shadows of the two animatronics: Fredbear and Spring Bonnie.
But or they are the first versions of the Shadows Animatronics, or they are just Shadows, BUT Fredbear is already in using in suit mode, is that why i belive they are the shadow animatronics.

""In the FNaF 4 minigame, why would the tiny toy chica be missing her beak""
I will say the truth, im the first moment i see the toys, i see the beak, so she is a toy from Toy Chica, like the Toy of Toy Bonnie in FNaF 2, after win the night ""Double Trouble"" (i think is that night, or is that or is the ""New and Shine""), so, yeah, the game is in 87.",2016-03-02 18:47:30+00:00,d0l0amq,1.0,t3_48nay7,2939.0,fivenightsatfreddys
