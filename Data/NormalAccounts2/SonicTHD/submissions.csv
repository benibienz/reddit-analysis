Well, after that post I made about Adam Warlock, I want to open more with you guys about some other things, principally Quicksilver thing.

Idk if you guys are full of posts like ""When Quicksilver Will Return?"" or ""Where's the Soul Stone?"", but I still want to talk about him.

Okay, people says Quicksilver can return as a cameo or even revived by Thanos in Infinity War, because the Soul Stone, or Reality Stone, or the Time Stone idk.

But let's be honest, do you think this will happen?

Do you think there's hope for his return?

I want him back, because for me Quicksilver could be a good character to be explored (is funny when you see my nickname and i'm talking about Quicksilver).

In X-Men Universe he is a badass teeneger, when in MCU he isn't so fast like the other...

I mean, why they killed him? 

""It's a war movie, someone needs to die"" yeah makes sense Joss Whedon, like Avengers 1. But you revived Coulson, a character, which let's be honest guys, it wasn't a big thing, it was just a iconic and a kinda important member of Shield, if AoS never existed, he never turned so important for the universe.

I'm not saying Coulson shouldn't be revived, I pretty like him and his death was a kinda sad, but let's think about:

Joss revived a member of Shield, just for the series, okay he is important now, but when you guys got a character which is pretty much important, Quicksilver, you guys instead of let him alive, because he is a superhero and important, you guys killed him for ever.

I mean this sounds a bit fuck up to me.

His death was important for the Wanda personalitie construction, like her brother was like the guy who take care of her, and when he died, she turned into a woman, she lives now by her own, and do her own choices, this is good.

But you guys (when I say ""you"" i'm referring to the team behind the MCU) could made a hint to say he is alive, or saying ""he is in Hawaii"" or something, but nop, let him ded because he isn't important.

Like Kevin Feige said, he is 100% dead, and they don't has any plans for him, and for me, they will never have plans for him.

And if he appears on Infinity War Just as a cameo, this won't be fun, because is like Marvel Studios saying ""Oh, look he is back for some minutes, now let him dead again because he needs to be dead, and you guys will have just this"". Will be more good if he returns or he don't appears in the movie tbh.

But why let him dead? People says because the MS VS FOX thing, but idk.

I seriusly want Quicksilver return's to MCU, his death was a good thing for the construction of Wanda, but he can't stay dead. I mean, if Coulson, Bucky, Pepper, Loki and Groot returned from the deads, why Pietro can't too?

Also some people said he has a contract for nine movies, idk if you guys know about this but I heard about this somewhere, this is true? And even if is, idk if this a big thing for his return.

So, what do you guys think? Why Marvel Studios killed him? There's any hope for Pietro, and if there is, how you think he will return? I mean, the Infinity War thing don't sounds a possibilitie, as this sounds like a crazy thing just to revive him. I think if he returns will be something which makes sense like the Coulson Hawaii project and the Winter Soldier project.",marvelstudios,"So, let's talk about Quicksilver",https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/5do7go/so_lets_talk_about_quicksilver/

Whoa, my first post here since I came to this sub. But I was searching some things about Infinity War in the comics and about Adam Warlock (which before the search I thought he was Captain Marvel, lol, sorry :S), because of course,  he appeared in Guardians of the Galaxy as a cocoon. And tbh, I will be a bit disappointed if he appears in Infinity War.  

I know, Adam is a important character in this saga, principally because the original Infnity War was around Magus (Right? Idk, I need to search more about Magus too...), but for me, if he appears on Infinty War he will be more like the principal thing to defeat Thanos, like what happened with Vision VS Ultron in AoU.

But tbh, in AoU sounds interesting Vision be the character to defeat Ultron, but when I think about the same thing but with Adam VS Thanos, sounds pretty boring for the INFINITY WAR.

I mean, it's the INFINITY WAR, the movie which will links everything on the MCU, and every second needs be epic. 

And will be more interesting if the entire Avengers fight Thanos to a death battle, instead of just the Avengers protecting the earth when Adam will be the one to kick the purple ass. Which one of those options sounds more epic for this movie?

Or even if happens a battle between Avengers + Warlock VS Thanos, would be more interesting seen the entire Avengers and Warlock defeating Thanos (something like Vision, Iron Man and Thor VS Ultron thing in AoU) than just the Avengers in the ground when Adam do the ""Finish Him"" in Thanos, I don't want he been the key to defeat Thanos, I want something epic, like, it's pretty disappointing seen the entire group of Avengers in this entire MCU timeline, when in the ending we just need Warlock.

And tbh again, I want Warlock in the movie, as the entire characters in this timeline, but I don't want too, because probably he will be the character to defeat Thanos, when will be more badass seen everyone versus Thanos, and not just Adam finishing the thing. I would like he been in the movie, he just don't be the big hero.

And I hope the Russo Brother's don't do this in the movie, because I pretty think he will appear in Infinity War, not just because he is a important character in the original saga, but because what if one of those ""spoiler movies"" in the Phase 4 is a Adam Warlock movie? I mean makes sense why it's a ""spoiler"", right?

Anyway, I just made this post to spell this out this feeling, and what do you think guys?",marvelstudios,Here's techicnly why I don't want Adam Warlock in Infinity War,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/5dipso/heres_techicnly_why_i_dont_want_adam_warlock_in/

I mean, we all know about the three brothers, the Crying Child, ded on 87, the Brother (Which i still thinking is Mike) and the Sister (ded probably in 83 or some other date).

People are saying Afton is the father of these children, which is funny because in FNaF 4 the Purple Dad theory wasn't so strong

But i'm thinking, is Afton the father?

I mean, this could be possible?

It's nescessary be the father?

What if these children aren't actually the son's of his partner Henry?

I mean, Henry, Phone Guy, Scott Cawthon, Scott's Head, Sad Desk Man, is techincly all a representation of the creator Scott

Since we're thinking Henry is actually Phone Guy, and Mike is the brother, this would techincly explain why there's photos of Scott Cawthon on FNaF 4 gameplay

""WHAT? AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME RIGHT?""

Some people is saying some easter eggs are just easter eggs, not canon, like this photos of Scott, the FNaF 1 phone call, or even Funtime Lolbit head

But guys, this is FNaF, we can't just let everything in a trash and say ""it's not important""

So yeah, im taking seriusly the photos

So, the photos are in the FNaF 4 gameplay house, which it's pretty like Mike/Eggs one, another proof he is the brother

Since that Bidybab easter egg on the Eggs house (which for me it's real, thanks Rafagamer), the house of Eggs can be connected with Circus Baby 

So, or the house of Eggs is the same as the minigames and Afton took some old things from the house and put on the FNaF 4 gameplay house, or Eggs is living on the FNaF 4 gameplay house

And these things explains alot the photos

But why Afton is using the kids from his partner for experiments?

Probably because Henry was working with Fazbear Entertainment, which Afton's hate them because that incident with the springlocks and blah blah blah

Like in the book

Probably Henry abandoned his partner and Afton create a whole hate to him too, and is using his kids for experiments.

Phone Guy could working on Fredbear's when Afton was playing with his young son

In SL never says Afton is the father, since Eggs was ""confirmed"" to be Mike and the brother, explains why Ennard used his sister voice on Private Room

Also, like Baby said, he is knew, and what a type of guy would **spend his nights on a place like that?**

And the cutscenes of the sister never said anything characteristic of her father, so isn't confirmed Afton is the father

Since sister location was confirmed by Scott, a lot of people thought ""IT'S THE SISTER LOCATION MENTIONED IN FNAF 3""

And a lot of people still thinking the same thing after... Night 4 *thing*... You know, i don't want to use spoilers here

But i still can't see this is the sister location mentioned in FNaF 3, heres why:

Well, due the fact about the Night 4 *thing*, is a big proof saying the restaurant was opened in 83 or something

We don't know when happened Stage 01 (wich is obvius is the tapes location), but we know there was after Fredbear's opening

And as far we know, we know about the easter egg in FNaF 4, Fredbear &amp; Friends

A Tv Show, a commecial? For me is the two things

Makes sense right?

So, techincly existed Fredbear's Family Diner: Fredbear &amp; Friends, wich had Fredbear and Freddy's guang, no?

So, on the tapes of FNaF 3, phone guy calls Spring Bonnie suit as ""spring Bonnie suit"". Don't get it? Is like he's saying ""we have a spring and a normal suit of Bonnie"", wich means exists a Bonnie before the restaurant.

And i mean, who created the spring mechanism was Fredbear's franchise.

AND in the same tapes, when Phone Guy talks about the sister location, he says ""central location"" or something like that

Is like saying ""the company has the restaurants, and the sister location i'm talking in the central location of all of them"", wich makes sense if is FFD: F&amp;F, due the Freddy's guang and Fredbear are in there, and due the Tv show probably the restaurant is the most famous and rich.

And another thing: in the time of FNaF 3 was created, SL was nothing

Scott just had the idea for SL just after the Halloween Edition of FNaF 4, like 7 months later.

How for the lore Circus Baby would be the sister location mentioned if in that time don't existed Circus Baby in Scott's mind?

Don't makes sense if Fredbear's was the other location? Since in that time we just heard about two locations by Fazbear Company?

Just if Scott did the same thing as FNaF 4 in Sister Location, because.... Yeah, you know what i'm talking about, again, any spoilers here please

But Ennard can still a proof of the Paper Kid Theory

Remember what i said before SL? Pre-Ennard was a animatronic wich was based on Paper Buddy and has the soul of the Crying Child of FNaF 4

It was before SL, but what if stills the same thing, but instead Paper Budy was based on Pre-Ennard?

You never thinked about why Ennard wants to get out?

Remember how the crying child hates Fredbear's, and his home, and probably the nights?

I mean, if he possessed Paper Buddy and now Ennard, makes sense why he wants go get out

He hates that place

Probably the kid never saw the world or wants to see the world because that experiments or whatever

Like Ennard

Ennard probably hates that place, like he said in Night 5, he doesn't want to hurt anybody, he just want to get out of that place

And if the protagonist is Mike = Brother, like my old theries (but now of course without the ""Nightmares"" part), this techincly would be justice, since the brother killed him, and now Ennard, or i mean, Crying Child, needs his body to get out. He died for his fault and wants ""revenge""

Funtime Lolbit (if it's a real thing) could be created before FNaF 2, we don't know yet, but i think New Funtime Foxy was created after Funtime Foxy from FNaF 2, as Phone Guy said they really created her in that restaurant, so we know it's after the second game

It was so close, and how Scott said before the annunciament of SL, the lore was complete

I talked about this in the past, and here's why i think **couldn't** be a lie

If you don't know, the creator of this theory is Matpat, and he said the springlock incident was by a death of two employees wich died in Fredbear and New Spring Bonnie suits, wich after they turned in shadow versions of they called the Shadows

But let's see, you don't agree this is a straw-gasping?

There's any proof wich actually confirms that

Also, it's strange that two employees died at the same time (Thanks to DarkSlayerX reminds me this)

""Scott confirmed that saying the part of 2 Matpat's video was great and he was right with everything""

If you dont noticed, he wasn't talking about that video, he was talking about [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1kw1RmzrPc)

Wich again, is a video wich Matpat talks about Purple Phone theory, wich Scott said that was one of his mistakes on the video

The Shadow Springlock Incident was talked about the next video, wich for Scott is techincly ""part 3""

So yeah, Scott never confirmed about that theory

And again, there's any proof about this could be true

Just ONE thing in the series wich is techincly a proof, when Shadow Spring Bonnie (or Glitch Bonnie for others) appears in Stage 01 minigame, wich to Shadow/Glitch exists in that time, he should died in that time

But this can and cannot bee a proof, it's the only thing wich techincly confirms that

""Okay, so what do you think are the shadows?""

I will never agree they're hallucinations or representation of Purple Guy wearing the spring suits

I still belive they're souls

So, what's my theory?

[This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/4v8vmi/theory_how_is_the_origin_of_the_shadows_and_a/)

Yeah, i made that a long time ago, wich says the Shadows are dead kids killed by Purple Guy in Fredbear's V2 (FNaF 4 restaurant), wich are the persons in Fredbear and New Spring Bonnie suits in the Backstage and Purple Guy easter egg

And this can be true, since the Shadows are in the minigames, and FNaF 2 is after FNaF 4

And the springlock incident?

Phone Guy said about the springlocks was prohibited to use, but he talks espcially about the Spring Bonne one's

So this can be the same springlock incident from TSE, wich Purple Guy almost died in New Spring Bonnie suit and get crazy as fuck to revenge because the company said ""fuck you it's not my problem"" and startest murders to fail the restaurants and the company

This makes sense, right?

I said in the same post i wasn't beliving in this theory because the fact, if the crying child is Paper Pal Budy, that two victims in Fredbear's wasn't Paper Pal's Freddy and Bonnie, wich they was the Shadows, so wich means the crying child controls the three Paperpals in the same time like FNaF World, wich don't makes sense!

Actually this techincly makes for me now, because he controls just Budy in FNaF 2, and in FNaF 3 don't controls Freddy and Bonnie at the same time

But wouldn't makes sense the Shadow Cupcake theory, but i think and you guys think it's nonsense this theory too... But stills possible tbh

So yeah, that's what I belive

**TL;DR: The shadows aren't victims by the springlock incident, and they're actually [kids killed in Fredbear's](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/4v8vmi/theory_how_is_the_origin_of_the_shadows_and_a/)**

But this is interesting if we look a old phrase by Scott he said in the past:

""Can be the lore be solved with the first four games? Yes""

I mean, WHATA FUCK

We know SL will give us answer about that ending, but what answers

And if this answer can be in the first four games, so where is it?

In FNaF 3 minigames?

In Phone Guy phone calls?

In the sources?

No, ANYTHING can explain that thing

SL can be the thing wich can solve this night 6 minigame

WHAT THAT THING MEANS?

Why she said ""I will put you back together""???

Who the fock she is to say that?

Who is the other animatronic besides Puppet and Golden Freddy wich is powerfull and can explain that final phrase?

I mean, probably you gonna say ""She is mangle, she put the kid together in the fnaf 3 minigames with the cake""

Well

1- We don't know if she is Mangle soul, wich for me this theory about the garden kids are the Toys souls is a kinda straw-gasp just because they looks like Balloon Boy and has the Toys figures, don't really sounds perfect in my eyes

2- We still don't know if the kid is 100% Golden Freddy, because there's the fifth kid in the other three games, wich absolutyly isn't Shadow Freddy or Puppet or whatever other thing

~~wich know when i was writing this i noticed this could be a  prove about phone guy isn't purple guy and i could used this before scott revealing everything~~

I made a mistake on that post

Nothing about FNaF 1, i still right about that

I said in the post this was like with FNaF 4

Well this is my error

Because i said on the past, about this thing of FNaF 1 is like on the 4, because Scott said in the past that was the final game for the final part of the story

Well, you guys remember the original title of the game, right?

FNaF: The final Chapter

Well in a few months after, we saw was changed for FNaF 4

Well, why he changed the name?

Just because the game is a continuation of the other games?

I dont think so

Well if i can remember, Scott said this was the last game, but i think he said this **before** he changed the name

And this can be explain why FNaF 4 is some things wich is techincly unsolved, like if BV is Golden Freddy, Puppet, Paper Pal Budy

Who the fuck is the sister ~~or cousin~~ and why she talks on the night 6 ending ~~wich i still don't think she represents Mangle and she is her/his soul~~

And there's a ""Cliffhanger"" in the game

I think you know what means this word

If you don't know, it's like a thing for a continuation, like when you watch a Marvel movie like Civil War and in the ending after the credits (this isn't a spoiler, is a imaginary exemple) we saw Captain America being revived after his death on the movie

Saying that will be a continuation

So, what and where is the Cliffhanger on FNaF 4?

On the final

When appears the box

Im talking about how this can be possible

The five kids death

No, the fifth kid isn't Shadow Freddy, or Jay Jay, or Puppet, or another animatronic, this fifth kid is obviusly Golden Freddy soul

He could be Puppet to be honest, but there's Give Cake to the Children

Okay, but what if we're wrong?

I mean, what if the Puppet junpscare is a mistake by us?

What if this Give Cake isn't Puppet?

We know about Fredbear plushie right?

So, what if, this kid from Give Cake is the plushie and the fifth kid of the murder is Puppet?

This could explains Happiest Day AND the proof wich my friend /u/SpringPopo show to me about the crying child wich ""kills"" Purple Guy is actually Puppet called in the files

Or even better, the Give Cake is Puppet and the fifth kid is the plushie

I mean, this can be possible to BV be Golden Freddy right?

But tbh, Nightmarionne and the Jack-o's could be too

We know there is two Jack-o's, and they could represent the two pumpkins in the offices of FNaF 1 and 3 on their own Halloween Update

And Nightmarionne or could represent Phantom Puppet + Puppet hallucination on the cams + his mask in the same cam, or even could be Puppet himself

BUT Nightmare Mangle is techincly **IMPOSSIBLE** to be explained

Why? Because he never saw her

I mean, he saw her in the first time in FNaF 3, like Phantom Mangle (Review my theory about the phantoms are the toys souls)

But he don't saw her entire body, so how Nightmare Mangle is totally like Mangle or Phantom Mangle in question of design if Mike never saw Mangle's body completly (this proves Phantom Mangle isn't a hallucination too)

In other ways, he saw the Funtime Foxy head on the box and her toy figure mangled in FNaF 4, but jesus, do you think the toy will be EXACTLY LIKE MANGLE? I don't even think his sister saw Mangle too, so that toy was mangled randomly, but Nightmare Mangle? No! It's the same body design

In other ways, do you think Mike could remember the exactly same body of Mangle after years? I don't even know how many arms she has!

The only way he could know how is her is:

- Phantom Mangle, well he never saw her body, techincly, but still a hard possibilitie

- Nightmarionne is really Puppet soul wich created Nightmare Mangle how he knows

So, i was talking with you guys about Foxy being a un-withered animatronic before VS he always was withered

And i started to think about something

I have a friend (i will not say his name) wich i was talking about Foxy suit and Spring Bonnie gender, and he said something interesting to me:

Me: You don't think Scott some day will confirms Spring Bonnie's gender?

Him: Nah, Scott will never say. He could said in the past, but he really want the fandom go in fire.

I mean, Scott is a nice man, but...

My friend is right?

In one post he said the gender of Mangle: Yes

I mean, wtf, i know what this really means, is like a person asking ""Mangle is male? Yes, Mangle is female? Yes""...

So he techincly confirmed Mangle has two genders? Or probably he was just joking?

Or when comes out FNaF World, when he said in Spring Bonnie loading screen:

""Male? Female? Who cares, it's a rabbit""

He could joking too, but... I mean, everyone cares

""Robots don't have genders"" jesus i hate this phrase

Is obvius a robot don't has, but we are talking about the character, not a robot

When a person says that is like he talking ""You don't see this whole drama about gender's is actually stupid?""

In my opinion, no

Think about a person wich is making a fanart about that character

He don't know if he is male or female, and if for him is one of the two, people will be piss off because for that person the gender is different for another

Actually people cares about it

And this thing with Classic Foxy or Original Foxy is the same thing, people cares about his design

Well, not a lot, because when I talked about Fredbear is fat, 90% of the people said my post was stupid and nonsense

Jesus, why people don't cares about it? Means a lot!

Design and gender, people cares about it

And we back for what my friend said

Is Scott really wants the fandom go in fire?

I don't agree with this, Scott wouldn't wants that

But.. He wants?

We see, Scott is a nice developer, he made FNaF World for free because for him the game wasn't good, jesus we need more people like him in the world

But... What if Scott really don't cares about this whole thing with gender and design? What if he really wants the community go in fire?

In my opinion, no

This things is like what he did with the Kitchen in FNaF 1

He said ""I want the people go with the imagination about that room""

What if this same thing is about the genders and the designs?

Possibly he wants to the community makes your own opinion and choice, about a *important* characteristic of that character

He don't want the fandom go in fire, he just want the people choces the perfect thing for him.

That's why he don't confirms anything, that's why he is amazing

In my opinion, he don't should do that, i think would be more nice if he confirms once for all this things, but in other ways, he is right...

Is like when i asked why you guys belive why Golden Freddy is Fredbear

Well, i solved every animatronic wich people said it's a hallucination

Why? Because he is a character, and would be good if he actually exists

But why every time when i say ""Golden Freddy isn't a hallucination"" or ""The phantoms aren't"", why still people who says they are hallucinations?

Remember, there is a difference between **ghost** and **hallucination**

Ghost is just a thing wich exists

Hallucination don't

GG easy

Well, back again, why people always says ""Golden Freddy is a hallucination"" or ""Jay Jay is a hallucination""?

You know, if you like one of them, you know he actually don't exists right?

""Uh but every animatronic don't exists in real life idiot""

Im not talking about in real life, about in game universe

Why saying Golden Freddy is a hallucination if he don't really exists and is just a soul of a child?

So you favorite ""animatronic"" is the soul of the child, right?

Because the animatronic don't exists if you say he is a halluciantion

I understand the Phantoms and the Nightmares thing, because they was introduced like ""these guys don't exists"", been ""solved"" by me or not, they don't be real makes really sense

But why Jay Jay? Why Endo-02? Why Golden Freddy?

I will list every animatronic wich people says it's a hallucination now:

* Golden Freddy

* Jay Jay

* Endo-02

* Paperpals

* Phantoms

* Shadows

(I don't want to talk about the Nightmares, because is pretty safe saying they are just nightmares and it's to polemic to talk about for now)

Second, im not a kid who don't know to write, im a person with 15 years old wich lives in a country who is difficult to learn english, so please guys, don't compare me with a kid of 9 years old wich is making theories about Foxy is a good guy

So, you guys know i made a discussion talking about the year of FNaF 1, wich could be 92 or 98

I seriusly expected find a answer to this, because is confusing me

And the most people are hating this post with just a simple phrase: ""Scott games are realistic""

First, i want to say: I WAS WRONG

Well, not everything wrong

Buzzek shows me a image showing animatronics in 2015, wich they can't move and everything, so why would be animatronics in 20 years ago wich could move and **jump** in us?

Well, when i saw that is seriusly understand why

Well, okay, but for me, a animatronic like Withered Foxy can totally jumps with his weight

To be honest, i don't know what is his weight, even you don't know, is just a stupid speculation of looking to him

Okay, but this don't made me angry, about i was wrong

I make mistakes okay?

What made me angry is about a whole text i made to theorizing in peace, and everyone downvoted and hated this because one mistake: a single phrase

Seriusly guys, why?

Because okay, one or two persons trying to fix my phrase it's okay

But holy shit, 90% of the commentaries is just about this? What are you problem guys?

And i saw again what is the most problem in this community

Hating

Yes, isn't the kids or stupid theories, for me the most cancer exists in this community is hating 

I mean, i know exists people who are nice guys, like PurpleGeist and SpringPopo, but the most people here hate weach other

You don't agree with that?

Since i started to post here, i saw many people hating and hating, don't just my theories or posts, but everything

Isn't a reaction of downvotes this, is a reaction of the whole hate exists here

You don't agree?

Oh look, different opinion

Hate

Oh look, different theory

Hate

Oh look, unoriginal game

Hate

Oh look, porn

Hate

Oh look, a simple mistake

Hate

You guys can't be nice? Why hating everything?

I understand you can dislike something, or downvoting, it's something totally right and i can understand

But why so many hate with everything? We can't just be in totally peace?

I made the discussion to talk about one single thing, and i could understand the year couldn't be 98, wich i belive but the year can be 92

But no, people are hating just because one thing:

A simple mistake

And like i said, i understand if i made a mistake and one or two people trying to fix it, but seriusly, everyone?

You guys totally iguinored what i said about FNaF 1 year to hate the post, why?

Because one single emotion here: Hate

Well, sorry for this entire drama, i don't care more about Downvotings, so you're free to say your opinion

If you think this whole post is stupid and is just drama by me, so yeah, sorry, but be nice with me in the comments

In the beggining of the game, in the newspaper, there is a secret text hidden, wich says:

""""Blah. Blah. Blah, Blah. Blah. This ad has nothing to do with anything relevant to the game. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah. Chances are you won't make it past night three. Blah. Blah. Yackity Smackity. Blah. Blah. This probably isn't the best choice of a summer job, since you most likely won't survive the week. I'd recommend being a cashier, sack boy, or work in a warehouse. They are all very respectable jobs, and you probably won't be killed by them. Well, you might. But it would be unlikely. Blah. Blah.""

Now look what he said in the text:

**""This probably isn't the best choice of a summer job...""**

We know FNaF 1 is in november like FNaF 2, but he calls this job a ""summer job""

And this same text appears in FNaF 2 newspaper again!

**Edit: Holy god, in Steam page of the game is called again ""summer job""**

**""Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds!""**

**Scott calls again the game is a summer job, but the game is in november!**

So for Scott, a summer job is in novemeber, how? The summer is June, July and August, November isn't fall? 

I don't know why Scott said that, but [this could disprove the theory about the tapes of FNaF 2 are in the summer and helps the theory wich the drawnings says the previus opening had the Originals](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/4vvjph/discussion_thread_the_restaurant_before_fnaf_2/)

**Warning: English isn't my first language, so watch out with the errors, i fell there is many of them, don't judge me. You're free to fix a error or every of them**

People knows and i think is pretty safe, the restaurant was opened before FNaF 2, but closed because murders and investiguations


Phone Guy talks ""Welcome to your new summer job""

He pretty says he is in the summer, but the gameplay is november

So, the theory himself said the calls os before FNaF 2 gameplay, when the restaurant first opened

And he talks about the last location, with doors and everything

So he is pretty saying the restaurant opened like ""right now"", saying the moved to the new location

The restaurant he was talking about is obviusly the FNaF 1 restaurant, but in the time with the Originals, before they turned into the Withereds

So they moved to the new location, wich is FNaF 2 location, and after they closed for investiguations, and re-opened in November of 87

Remember the newspaper of the beggining of the game?

""Grand Re-Opening""

Okay, now i explained the whole theory, there is a thing wich the community doesn't really know

People don't know how is the restaurant in that time

Well, there a strange thing involving this: The phone calls and the drawnings

Why? Because one says a thing from the past but the other says another thing

What i'm trying to say?

The Phone calls said when the restaurant opened in the first time, they had the Toys, Funtime Foxy, BB and Puppet

But the drawnings said when the restaurant opened in the first time, they had the Originals, Funtime Foxy, JJ and Puppet

Yes, this is getting confusing

Well, let me explain everything

In FNaF 2 phone calls, Phone Guy mentioned the Withereds in the backroom and the Toys, saying ""They spent a small fortune on these new animatronics"" 

Okay, so Phone Guy says about they had the Toys before FNaF 2 gameplay and the Withereds still withereds

But the drawnings, of the kids, in the office, prize corner, Kid's Cove, shows other things

We see Original Freddy in one drawning

After we see Original Freddy, Originak Bonnie and Original Chica in another, and it's Original Bonnie because his collor is like Withered Bonnie, not like Toy Bonnie, he has a dark blue

After we see Jay Jay in one drawning. No isn't Balloon Boy, he can have blue too, but the most color he has in the red, so if it was Balloon Boy, he should be red, no blue like the drawning. So i assume that is Jay Jay

After we see Mangle and Puppet in another drawnings

And finally Original Golden Freddy in one, smelling

So, this drawnings says the animatronics before FNaF 2 gameplay was the Originals

""But these drawnings could be from the previous location!""

No, because two things:

* In the drawnings, above them it says ""My Day at the **New** Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria"", wich is saying that is the new location, totally new

* Original Foxy is in the previous location, wich we can see in Go Go Go Foxy, and Phone Guy assumed they created Funtime Foxy in that location, why would the last restaurant had two Foxy's?

And in the newspaper, says ""Look at the new face of Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria!"", is pretty like saying ""Look the new style of the animatronics in the re-opened Freddy's!""

And some theorists behind this theory with the drawnings, says the Phone Calls was recorded in Summer of 19**86**, why? I don't know, but probably because to say about the time to the Originals transforming into Withereds :P

Well, the drawnings says the first innauguration had the Originals, but the phone calls mentioned the Toys and the Withereds

That's the problem, we can't know how was the restaurant before FNaF 2, and what guang of animatronics they had

So this is a discussion thread to talk about this: What hint you belive? The Phone Calls or the Drawnings?

I belive in the Phone Calls, but i seriusly trying to find a solution to the drawnings, so that's why im making this

I'm calling the theorists who started this, is pretty good to call them to solve this big mystery

#**WRONG**

FNaF **2** started this, not the first

What we see in FNaF 1 is about one single murder, the murder of the first five childs

JUST in FNaF 2 is showed a big whole story, with a second murder, a single murder, the Shadows, the year 87....

The true lore startest in the second game

Everything related with the Toys souls, the Shadows souls, the Puppet death, Purple Guy Death, the Crying Kid Death, the ""Mystery Murder"" in Fredbear's V2.... EVERYTHING STARTEST IN THE SECOND GAME

When Scott created FNaF 1, for him it was his last game of all

He couldn't create a new whole lore, if he thought it was his last game

So he created a single story for that game

The phame of the game helped Scott to create a new big lore, with mysteries, more murders, secret restaurants, everything

But FNaF 1 stills canon, and the story he tells is true and is canon

""What do you mean Sonic?""

I mean

Purple Guy killed five kids

The ""two kids"" in the newspapers are the same kids from the five kids

What we see in FNaF 1 is just about the murder who we saw in GGGF

The newspaper telling about ""two kids lured into a backroom"" are two kids from the five kids, in the newspaper he says first about the two kids, after he said about ""now five kids are linked to the incident"", he didn't said NOW MORE FIVE KIDS, he said now are FIVE KIDS, NOT MORE TWO

And this proves more the FNaF 4 child can't be Golden Freddy, because stills a fifth kid to posses a animatronic, and is nescessary to be Golden Freddy

What FNaF 1 shows, the five animatronics possessed, are linked to these murders

Five animatronics, five victims

And there isn't any more two kids, why would Scott talked about more two kids if the game are just five animatronics? They would possess the Cupcake and the Endo-01?

I mean, why he would tell another murder if he won't make more games, it's was his last game

He needed it to explain a single story, a single murder explaining the five possessed animatronics, not another story with two more kids with any other animatronic to possess, the Shadows don't existed yet, just when? FNaF 2

So, what FNaF 1 shows about the murder, is a single murder, explaining a murder of five kids, wich possess the five animatronics in that game

And this situation can be in Sister Location too

Sister Location shouldn't be existed, Scott said ""i dont want to make a fifth game, the fourth game will be the final chapter"" before trolled us

So wich means, what we saw in FNaF 1,2,3 and 4, is a single story

Sister Location can't changes anything, because he shouldn't exists

So in these four games, tells a story, a lore, and we can solve the lore without Sister Location

Sister Location can shows another story, another restaurant, another murder, BUT CAN'T CHANGES ANYHING OF THE OFFICIAL LORE, like FNaF 1 with the 2,3 and 4 games

Is strange, but i kinda make the people angry with my theories

I knew it before i started to post here, someday a person will hate my theory

Because is talk about what the community created and they can't more disagree about it, like saying Golden Freddy isn't a hallucination (or any other charachter thought) or talking about he isn't Fredbear

The community somehow created this felling of ""THIS IS THE TRUTH, AND ANYTHING CAN'T DISPROVE THAT"" wich i could disprove everything easily, and is funny how the person knewning he is wrong, he stills think his theory is right

GOLDEN FREDDY IS FREDBEAR, AND ANYTHING CAN'T DISPROVE THAT, EVEN THE LOGIC!

And about the Hallucination things, do you know, if you like Golden Freddy, or Jay Jay, or Shadow Bonnie, or Phantom Foxy, you know if you call them ""hallucinations"" you're saying they don't really exists, right?

I mean, why the people wants to they been hallucinations? Where is the fun in that? Wouldn't be more good if they would be real?

And about my theories, i just ask me about one thing:

Am I doing right?

Am I doing good theories?

Make the people angry is saying my theories are good and disproving something who the most of the people belives and it's wrong?

If i am wrong?

If every charachter i prove is real is actually a hallucination?

If Golden Freddy is Fredbear with any sense?

If other person solved the story before me?

Why? Well

In FNaF 1 newspaper, the animatronics are mentioned by ""charachters from a cartoon"" or something like that

Wich proves about a TV show, or a cartoon 

Well, now why it's a restaurant too

The Since 1983, don't talks about just the TV Show, but the restaurant too

The first FFP had Spring Freddy, Springbonnie and Golden Cupcake, like we saw in Stage 01

Stage **01**

Is like saying that is the first location of FFP

But if he is, why in FNaF 3 calls Phone Guy mentioned Springbonnie like this? With the ""Spring"" adjective?

Because exists the official Bonnie

The Bonnie and Freddy, Chica and etc is in Fredbear's Family Dinner, or how i like to call: FFD: F&amp;F

Because probably the first location of FFD has just Fredbear, like FNaF World said, the first animatronic, and after they ""re-opened"" the same restaurant but with more charachters, and created the tv show and the other sister location based on Freddy, Bonnie and Cupcake

This is the most stupid thing i ever seen

What we saw in FNaF World is totally parallel to the original universe, everything we saw is totally based on the games

There is a lot of information in the game

Fredbear is the first animatronic

Shadow Bonnie design is Toy Bonnie because White Rabbit

Phantom Freddy have a leg

Shadow Freddy, Shadow Bonnie, Jay Jay, Endo-02, Paperpals aren't just ""random things"" or ""stupid hallucinations""

~~BB is the most favorite animatronic~~

Desk Man, Henry and Scott Cawthon (i made a theory about that, postig in future)

Baby appearing in the final of Update 2

How Adventure Phantom Foxy phrase fix with my theory about the Phantoms are the toys souls

And probably there is much more

I know everything is great, like the most of the designs of the Adventures aren't accurates (like Fredbear or Endo-01), but they means something

You can use to be a proof, isn't just un-canon isn't just truth

What we see is a total truth, in any of this things Scott lied about something, the game has a canonical revelance and can be used for theories or proofs

Isn't like the Book or the Halloween Updates, wich can be used for theories, but for curiosities and no for proofs, wich they are AU

First, FNaF 1 was the first game, and anyone expected about a second game, wich Scotts dont expected too

In FNaF 2 opened a door showing more about the history, showing more things and more murders

But what we see in FNaF 1 can't be linked with anything, because in the begining, Scott just telled about five kids murdered who becomes the five animatronics

Isn't any more two children, these two are from the same ""vanish""

Just if the Cupcake and the Endo-01 are possessed too

What we see in FNaF 1 is just five children, there isn't Shadows, there isn't Toys, there isn't Puppet or Paperpals, is just, Freddy Bonnie Chica Foxy and Golden Freddy

Dont makes sense Scott tells about more two children if we didn't knew it if he could make a sequel

So that's my explaination, now let's see the newspaper:

""Five Children now reported missing""

He isn't saying more five children, he is saying ""Now there is five""

""Five children are now linked to the incident in Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria""

What incident?

The last incident about the two children lured into the backroom!

He isn't telling about a new incident with more five children, no! He is talking about the other incident!

But now are five linked! He isn't saying ""now are MORE five"", he is continuing the last history, but with more three children

Is the same incident, but now with more three children discover

Stupid idea but i dont have anything to do

So, her beak is missing because is obvius

She is a toy

We see Funtime Foxy mangled in the room of the sister

Probably these toys are like the toys of the Funko, who you can make abominations with all random parts

And these toys appeared after FNaF 4

The Toy Bonnie figure appeared in FNaF 2, it's a trophy of beating the night ""New and Shiny""

And this toy appeared after in FNaF 3, but is like a black carbonized, and we use him to enter in the Shadow Bonnie Minigame 

So, now with all this, let's answer the question

The answer is like obviusly, this figure shows the year is 87

You could say these toys are the figures of the Originals (Un-Withereds)

But the fact her beak is missing is because Scott is trying to tell us the year is 87, and that figure is based on Toy Chica

Like he said, the phrase says ""tiny toy chica""

Don't says ""chica figure"" or ""tiny chica"" or just ""toy chica""

He's saying ""**tiny** toy chica""

Like saying ""toy chica figure""

He is like saying the figure is Toy Chica

Also, in the live, Matpat was talking about red herrings presents in FNaF 4, and this phrase was like a answer to Matpat

Matpat: you say there are no easter eggs, but why are there so many red herrings?

Scott: Why would tiny Toy Chica's beak be missing?

The Adventure Mangle suicide saying ""See what you've all done?""

And the Ball Boy destroyed teaser saying ""Madness Takes Many Forms""

Well i think i could find a explaination

When we play FNaF World, 8-bit Fredbear talks about ""The Puppet Master""

Who is trully Scott Cawthon.

Okay, we see Scott Cawthon is angry

You don't saw that? Lets read his text in the final: 

""Most people are content playing through the game on Normal mode, but not you... There is always an over-achiever in a bunch. I guess that's you. So it's your fault then, for my misery. It's never enough for you people. Don't you get it? I can't do this anymore! I won't...

It was fun being the puppet-master, but now I grow weary. It's time to put you in your place.

Now let me show you how this game ends""

And after win he:

""Ok. Alright. I get it. Was this the ending you really wanted? Coming all the way here just to kill me? Was I REALLY the villain in your mind? I mean sure, this is definitely one way to bring the story to a halt, but surely there was a more satisfying ending. I just do what is demanded of me! I fill your insatiable gullets with more and more and more! And now your here to show your gratitude. Well congratulations then. I haven't brought this story to an end; you did. So feel good about yourself for ending the story by killing the storyteller!""

He seems a bit angry, but with who?

You

Probably is because this every thing of hating FNaF World, or other things who the community made like saying the games is bad or something

""Was I REALLY the villain in your mind?""

Now lets remember the teasers

Where are Adventure Mangle and Ball Boy?

In a black place

Totally black

Probably it's the place who we fight with Scott Cawthon in the final

And why they are destroyed?

Scott is anrgy, with the people who hates the game and the franchise with no motives or who dont see his entire time of working to in the final see many people saying shit of the game

He destroys Ball Boy and kill Adventure Mangle

""See what you've all done?""

And the phrase of the other teaser:

""Madness takes many forms""

He is crazy of anger, we see that when he is transforming in his ""Omega"" form

And the part ""Takes Many Forms"" probably because there isn't one Scott in the game, bu three

I made a theory in the past talking about Scott's Head, Scott Cawthon and Desk Man being probably emotions and personalities of Scott himself

Probably this makes sense with ""Takes many forms""

Or probably is about his transformation to the final boss of the game, because he is crazy in anger

But isn't 6 am yet, is 4 am

He get out of his room trying to find what is going on

He is walking on the hallway

He feels the fear and his arms and knees shacking

He can't stands his flashlight good enough

He finally get in the final of the hallway

He goes to the kitchen

When he is in the kitchen, he sees your familly

Your mother, brother and sister are in chairs

There is blood

He saws his father

He is sacking

He made something

He is holding something

A knife

There is blood

I think he is crying

But he feels the presence of his son

He says:

""I don't wanted to do that""

""Isn't what i planned""

""I don't wanted to go in that way""

""But they couldn't telled for the police""

""i'm sorry""

He knows what happened

The father is moving his head

So slowly

When he moves for complete

He is smilling

His eyes are white

They are so lighting

The kid is shacking

""You can't""

The father run for the next victim

The kid run

He runs for the room

The hands turns into metal claws

The skins turns into a black transparent skin

But first, we need know some things

- FNaF 2 phone calls is in the summer of 87. The restaurant opened in the summer (or other month i dont know) and closed in the summer because murders. And in november he open again.

- FNaF 4 is in 87, because the Toys Figures (Toy Chica figure beak) and the figure of Funtime Foxy mangled. Also the teaser of Nightmare Foxy and the HTML numbers.

Okay, knowing that let's go with the theory

So, let's remember Phone Guy calls

He says the animatronic can walk during the day

So the bite is before this calls

Also, he says they are looking the original owner of Fredbear's, and the place is closed for years

So if FNaF 4 is in 87, so this game is after FNaF 2 phone calls

And this can make possible the bite in the game be the Bite of 87

So we know that

FNaF 2 Phone Calls - FNaF 4 (Bite of 87) - FNaF 2 (Gameplay)

Ok, let's remember other Phone calls

Phone Guy said the Toys are acting ""strange""

And someone stoled a suit

What this can means?

Murders, or more special, Save Them

We see there is five dead children in the restaurant

And Purple Guy is there, okay not with the suit, but he is there

So, if the Phone Calls in FNaF 2 is in summer and before FNaF 4...

So Save Them is before FNaF 4 too...

Okay, now let's focus in the two charachters:

Golden Freddy and Puppet

Withered Golden Freddy is in the minigame

He is ""teleporting"" and he is ""blinding"" every time

He is already possessed

And Puppet is in the minigame moving too

But how if the FNaF 4 kid died after this minigame?

How if the bite is after Save Them?

Now you see why is impossible to the kid possesses Puppet or Golden Freddy

Also, remember

Save Him and Go Go Foxy

There is the crying kid and the jumpscare of Puppet

There is a fifth kid and the jumpscare of Withered Golden Freddy

So there is kids possessing these two charachters

Now i know you gonna ask:

""BUT HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE BIRTHDAY OF THE KID AND THE ""HAPPIEST DAY""?""

Well, i can't

These two minigames show a lot of similarities

In FNaF 4, the stage is the door of exit in FNaF 3

The ""bullies"" in FNaF 4 can be the ""friends"" in FNaF 3

Puppet kid can be Fredbear Plush trying to make the party

The kids in the minigames of FNaF 4 can be the kids with the mystery masks in FNaF 3

So, i want to talk about what is goin on bewteen:

POPGOES Canon story made by Kane

POPGOES Un-Canon made by Kizzy and probably with Phisnom

Before we start, i need to say somethings:

#I DONT SPEAK ENGLISH GOOD, MY NATURAL LANGUAGE IS PORTUGUESE, SO PROBABLY THIS TEXT WILL HAVE A LOT OF ERRORS, BUT TRUST ME, THIS IS THE BEST I CAN DO 

Kane, Kizzy and Phisnom, please dont hate me, im trying to telling my opinion and find a solution here, i will love to be your friends and everything, but please, **hate isnt the answer**

And this is for every guy who is reading this text too, please dont hate me. Im not trying to represent the community or whatever, im just a random guy trying to find a solution, understand me ;)

Also, to every mod, please dont ban this, im respecting everyone here. If you don't like my opinion, so iguinore, but ban to other people can't see it is wrong, everyone needs to talk your opinion public don't being a dick, if is something wrong in the text, please say in the comments and i can fix

Also, this text is big

So let's start

Kane is a nice guy, and tells the story with us is good (CALM DOWN PHISNOM, I WILL DEFENDS YOUR OPINION TOO""

Kizzy is a creative guy, and makes a website trying to put the pieces together to find the **TRUTH** is awesome!

And i dont know so much about Phisnom, but i think he is a talent guy to make that incridble fangame

Okay, after telling good things about the three guys, lets make they angry :P

Okay, we need to think:

Why the people make the theories?

Why?

Find the Truth (Lol Gem Stone)

We everyday we are making theories and theories to find the truth, and we want to know **THE TRUTH**

If we know the truth, probaly the other guy theory will be wrong, but like Scott said, probably a lot of **people will not accept this**

We dont want to create other story or other strange thing like the Dream Theory and the Adult Theory

(Lol now i make Kane, Kizzy and Phisnom angry in one verse)

We don't want other story, we want THE TRUTH

The fangames existed to telling other story, sometimes telling a story of a different place (FNaC, ONaF) or change the official story from FNaF (TRTF, PGS)

But these fangames put more mysteries, and what we do?

Making theories about this game

To?

Find The Truth

Okay, now let's talk about Kane ""telling"" the story

First of all, he tells and he don't tells the story to us

He make the game, but don't telled the story one second after

We made theories and he confirms that theories

BUT, let's remember what he and Phisnom said:

You guys will take one week to find the truth

Okay, so what is the better thing to do?

Telling the truth ONE WEEK AFTER

Kane confirms the theories and theories in the same week of the launch of the game

Well, is bad because he don't respect Phisnom, because Phisnom wants to the people find the truth

BUT, if don't existed Kane?

Probably Phisnom will be act like Scott, how?

**NEVER TELLING THE TRUTH**

In my opinion, this is worst

Because, i don't know, Scott will tell the truth one day

He will or not? We don't know

But if he will tell the truth one day, possibly he will acts like Kane:

Confirms a big theory telling the entire story

Remembers that video who the guy made the entire timeline of the games?

What happened if he was right and Scott said he is right?

I know: the community will be crazy and angry

Because i think what moves the FNaF community isn't just the fanarts, models and animations

Is find the truth

But what is the right thing to do?

Telling the truth someday? Yes

But when the popularity starts to fall

I mean, the people stops to make theories, fan arts, models and everything

We know someday this will happen if Scott stops making FNaF things, probably will be in a long future, but will happen

In that day, the right thing to do is telling the truth

And that's what Kane need it to do

He said like, when POPGOES was born likely, he said i think everything

The right think to do is wait and wait more, one month is good

But different to Scott, Kane had a help, Phisnom

And they need it to be partness and chosse the right time to say the truth, and don't hidden for forever, but say in the right time

Okay, now let's see what is the problem about FNaFLore and Kizzy

Remembers what i said? The people wants the **TRUTH**

Don't a un-official story

If the official story is confuse, and can't be explained, so talks with the creator of the story, Kane

But like Kizzy said, his story don't makes sense

But... What doesn't makes sense?

For me the story is complete, after Kane said everything, and everything fix perfectly

I want to know what is the problem?

Is a plot twist wich we dont know? Like the game was a dream of Jeremy in hospital? What is the problem?

And now, Phisnom is with Kizzy to create the un-official story

But remember: we wants the official story

And if the official story has a big problem, like it was a dream, we need to know to see what we will do

Because, seriusly, the dream theory is stupid, dont just in FNaF but in every fan game

Making a total drama saying we can't accept the truth and everything...

Well, if the official story has a plost twist like the dream theory, so IN THIS CASE WE NEED CALL THE DEATH OF THE AUTOR TROPE

But for now, what we know, isnt anything wrong with the history

If there is a huge problem, we need to know and make a good story

But saying there is a problem and we need re-write the story, wich the canon story (about what we know) is good, what is the problem?

Just because Kane revealed everything in the same week of the launch?

Okay, he made a BIG MISTAKE, and cant be fixed, but isnt nescessary to make another story to fix that

If do you guys want make another story, so make, but will be un-official, and the community **probably** will choose the official story, wich dont has any problem FOR WHAT WE KNOW NOW

Okay, but what is the solution for everything about this?

**First: Be friends**

And dont need to hate anyone just be ause a big error, everyone makes mistakes, so the right thing to do is saying sorry to Kane

And Kane, don't be angry with Kizzy and Phisnom, Phisnom is angry with you because you made a mistake, and the right thing to do is accept your mistake, and say sorry to Phisnom

**Second: PGSLore Website**

If Kizzy and Phisnom still wants to do they story, okay they made, and they made his website

Yes Kane, you made a fangame, wich is fair use, and the website isnt a problem

**Third: Put the official story in the website**

 Kizzy needs to put the OFFICIAL STORY too, because the people needs to know the canon story, because is wrong saying the uncanon story is the truth and anything what Kane made isn't

If do you guys dont want to put the official story in any way, so the right thing to do is create another fangame telling your story, because the POPGOES story is the Kane story

Okay, but like i said in the inicial part of the text:

You guys can hate the other, you guys can make the website without Kane story, Kane can saying he is right and everything

What im telling is just **MY OPINION** and **MY ADVICE** about everything is happening

Im not a important guy from this community, im just a random guy trying to fix this

And please, don't hate me Kizzy, Kane and Phisnom, you're nice guys and i will love to be your friends, **hate isnt the answer**

If you read everything, thanks a lot

If you want to say something in the comments, please be nice, and i will be nice with you ;)

Thanks guys and peace!

We know Shadow Freddy mimics Fredbear, Withered Golden Freddy and Classic (Golden???) Freddy in the series

But the ""thing"" who we see in the third game is like his second form in FNaF 2, but more ""old""

So, is possible to this time he mimics Phantom Freddy?

If you think the Phantoms are hallucinations or not, i don't care here

Because, is anything who he can mimics, because

We don't see Withered Golden Freddy in FNaF 3 anywhere, like just a head or a arm, to we know

And, it's safe he can change his forms everytime, like...

If this Shadow Freddy is the same from FNaF 2, what happen with the Classic version who we se in the minigames?

So that's it?

He mimics Phantom Freddy and that's why he has this color?

Because, like Phantom Freddy, if we brighten him, his color turns to gold

And when we brighten Shadow Freddy from FNaF 2, his color turns to more purple

So, what do you think guys?

Also, he is like his Tombstone, but in form of a ""animatronic"" if i can say

Now Gemstone

This is more hard, but i will try to say

Gemstone could be him because he says ""Fritz is lying"", but how he nows that?

If is because he was Jeremy in the past?

Also, i don't remember where i saw that, but in a image of Gemstone, i see him holding the phrase ""London"" or something that

The ""straw-gaspping"" is about the FNaF 2 song, London Bridge, and possibly, he killed himself in there

I know, a big straw, but this is the best i can do now

This is my opinion about models:

A lot of people will disagree with this, but for me, the models needs to released for the public.

You made an awesome and a very accurate model, but not releasing it is like torture.

One of my examples who puts them to the public is Mistsberg, who for me, has models which are so accurate (except for Nightmare Chica &gt;.&lt;), and is good, so he releases them.

But there exists another person who has made accurate models, and that is GaboCOart.

Oh my god, his models are the best models I have ever seen! I don't know if there are other models which are this totally accurate! They should released for the public.

But these models are just for Cinema4D, and I remember a guy asked about the Adventure Classics models for SFM, and he said he will release them.

But think, what if he doesn't want to release them? What will happen?
Total torture, the animators will are still using models which are in-accurate, when there exists a person who made them and doesn't want to release them!

Sounds familiar? Yes, Scott Cawthon.

Not everyone can create a model as accurate as his, because he is the creator of course.

But he said to the public he doesn't want to release them.

And I'm still thinking, why?

But I have found the answer.

A lot of people are making stupid animations about shipping and porn and put it on Typhon Cinema.

That is why I think, why the creators dont want to put them to the public, because those people exist.

I will not put Zacju as an example because he uses the inaccurate models to do what he do, but the accurate ones he will use in the new series, holy shit,it will be his best idea!

But thinking about it, it's okay that those stupid people exist ,but what about the people who want to create animations with the intention to be to be scary??

After Shimmy, a lot of new animators appear, like Maxie and Crystal!!
These are awesome animators, and these people need to have accurate models!!

But is it just for them? No

When E_A made the Classics models, omg, they are the best models I have ever seen (after GaboCOart), but he released them just for the Pimps, and that is torture for the public who want to make awesome animations.

After that, the release of them happened, just because a lot of people prayed for E_A.

But yeah, I know that there exist people who make shit, but we need to look for people who make awesome animations, and for calling more people who really want to make good animations, and thats why I think every model accurate needs to be released

She appears in Ladies Nights

In FNaF World, Phantom Mangle is mentioned by he and she

Funtime Foxy is Female (holy fock is obvius!)

A Endoskeleton don't have a gender

So what is the point?

Mangle don't have a gender

Well... Or she has the two genders or don't have any

Because the head of Funtime Foxy is female, but the Endoskeleton head don't have gender

So is more possibly saying she is the two genders (female and ""no gender"")....

Or whatever this going be confusing

The point is Mangle isn't female or male, is... what im trying to say

That's why FNaF World says ""he"" and ""she"", because we can call she whatever we want, because she isn't 100% female and don't have any part of a male gender

So Fredbear

We really don't know how are his design

But a lot of people thinks he is like [this](http://orig08.deviantart.net/e51a/f/2016/049/5/5/fredbear_and_shadow_fredbear_sfm_by_lak132-d9s7fpr.png)

But i don't think so

And what is the first ""fact"" the people uses to say he is ""skinner"" like Freddy or Spring Freddy?

The Adventure form

Adventure Fredbear is exactly like Adventure Classic Freddy

So the people says if 

Adventure Fredbear = Adventure Classic Freddy,

So, Fredbear = Freddy

[But let's compare these two charachters AND Adventure Withered Freddy](http://imgur.com/1uNvHlX)

Okay, Adventure Fredbear, Adventure Classic Freddy and Adventure Withered Freddy has the same design

[But Withered Freddy and Classic Freddy, in the original universe, DON'T ARE THE SAME DESIGN](http://imgur.com/nhaRNyf)

Well, if we go in the same logic like ""Adventure = Original Universe"", Fredbear and Withered Freddy should be like [this](http://imgur.com/8Y6ZZfh)

So yeah, this thing of ""Adventure = Original Universe"" don't makes any sense 

""BUT IF THIS ADVENTURE ""CLASSIC"" FREDDY IS THE UN-WITHERED FREDDY?""

[He isn't, because Scott said the game has the Classics, so yeah, he is Classic Freddy, and not ""Un-Withered Freddy""](http://imgur.com/MVbkZSu)

""OKAY, BUT [HE ISN'T FAT LIKE THE NIGHTMARE VERSION](http://imgur.com/z68Xy5z), BECAUSE [NIGHTMARE FREDDY ISN'T LIKE UN-WITHERED FREDDY](http://imgur.com/ekRRB1p)""

Well, this is true, and makes sense

[But lets think about the Withereds and Nightmare Fredbear](http://imgur.com/IMQz0cu)

We don't know how is the Un-Withereds and Fredbear, the only thing to know how they are is if we edits the Withereds and Nightmare Fredbear

But Scott never made the Un-Withereds and Fredbear models, he made the Withereds and Nightmare Fredbear

When he made the Originals and Fredbear models, he needs be like the Withereds and Nightmare Fredbear, because if isn't, will no makes any sense

Is like made the Withered Chica with open mouth and after makes Original Chica with no mouth (like Classic Chica)

He needs be accurate like the Withereds and Nightmare Fredbear

The others Nightmares are based on the Withereds, but Nightmare Fredbear is based in anything, because Scott don't made the Fredbear model yet

So, if Nightmare Fredbear is fat (or chubby), Fredbear needs be fat (or chubby) too!!!


Also, Fredbear ISN'T Freddy

Fredbear can't be like Freddy because isn't Freddy

Fredbear came FIRST

Remember? The first animatronic is Fredbear

Just after him Fredbear &amp; Friends open and cames Freddy

So why the restaurant will make other animatronic like Fredbear but just with brown skin?

BECAUSE FREDBEAR AND FREDDY ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENTS!

[Exited types of Freddy's, and exited types of Fredbear](http://imgur.com/4wW8u0M)

ALSO, THAT'S OBVIUS! BECAUSE IF FREDBEAR = FREDDY, WHY FREDDY ISN'T CALLED BROWN FREDBEAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

So is impossible Fredbear can be skinny like Freddy, because they has differents desings, and they are different charachters

And that's is the same situation with Spring Freddy, because if Fredbear cames first, and after this cames Freddy, so why Spring Freddy needs be like Fredbear if his names is Spring **Freddy**?

""OKAY YOU LITTLE SHIT, SO HOW DO YOU THINK FREDBEAR IS?""

I think he is like [this](http://imgur.com/2CemKd6)

Yes, a Un-Withered edit of Nightmare Fredbear

He is like this, he needs be like this

Scott probably made the Fredbear model secret, but no matter what, he needs be like this, or will don't makes any sense with the Nightmare version

Maybe Scott just made the Adventure Fredbear design because he was too lazy to make another design

Also, Adventure Fredbear was the third Adventure design he made, after Adventure Endo-01 and Adventure Endo-02, so makes sense why the others Adventure Freddys are like him

So yeah, you can still think Fredbear is skinner like Freddy, and Fredbear is Freddy, or some shit, but you needs understand if Fredbear is skinny, don't makes sense why Nightmare Fredbear is fat",fivenightsatfreddys,"[THEORY] Fredbear is Fat (Or Chubby, Whatever)",https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/4igjhc/theory_fredbear_is_fat_or_chubby_whatever/

Okay, first, who we play in FNaF 4?

The brother, of course

So he is having these Nightmares because the death of his brother right?

But who is making these nightmares?

Something powerful 

Something scary

The Nightmare

Nightmare is called that because he is the fear, he is the real nightmare

Okay, but stop to think, to Nightmare being the ""Final Boss"" in the series, he needs being so important right?

About Golden Freddy (or Shadow Freddy, but in that i dont belive), he could be him

But i was thinking the most powerfull character in the series

Puppet

He totally could be!

Look, if he is Nightmare, why he is making all of these Nightmares?

Revenge

And what Puppet is doing with the 10 crying child souls?

Revenge

All is about revenge

He is revenge his friend

So he create the Nightmares based on the brother fears:

The 4 bullyings (including him)

The Animatronic who did the Bite

And the boss, who is making all of this

Makes sense right?

Also, is possibly the Nightmares are the souls of the childs transformeds to kill the brother too, including the FNaF 4 child trying to kill him, but this is other theory

Makes a lot of sense right?

But wait... Who substitute him in the Halloween Edition?

Exactly 

Why we don't have a Nightmare Puppet? And just a fusion with him and Nightmare?

Because Nightmarionne is Nightmare

Sounds crazy, but is like call Nightmare Foxy and Nightmare Mangle the same? Yes, but in this case, makes a lot of sense

I think after the Halloween Edition a lot of people understand the difference in these two animatronics, but i will talk about this anyway

First i want to talk about Fredbear isn't Golden Freddy

- Fredbear is the first animatronic created by the company, and he uses Purple Bowtie and Purple Hat. Also he is the protagonist of the restaurant Fredbear's Family Dinner. And he has Springlock mechanism.

- Golden Freddy, or like in the old days, Original Golden Freddy, a animatronic to substitute Spring Freddy in the new Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria, but with no Spring Lock mechanism. After that, a powerless soul posses him and he turns part real animatronic part ghost animatronic.

Bonus: 

- Spring Freddy is a Springlock animatronic based on Original Freddy from the location Fredbear &amp; Friends. He is the protagonist of the restaurant Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria.

Ok we get it the difference know, right?

Also i want to talk about the Fredbear's desing.

He is fat.

No no, he isn't like Spring Freddy or Original Golden Freddy, **HE IS FAT**

Nightmare Fredbear was the first time who Scott made a model of him, and he maybe don't but differences things like with the others Nightmares.

So with we Un-Withered him, he will be fat.

And no matter what, he is fat.

We don't has similarities things with the other two animatronics, because he is unique

Second, i don't think Fredbear is in the rule of ""The Freddy's"", but i'm 99% sure not

So yeah, we have four possibilities:

* The restaurant will be the first Fredbear's, before the first Freddy's, before Fredbear &amp; Friends, everything, the first

* To you who belived Fredbear &amp; Friends is a Cartoon, maybe the restaurant will be the ""sister location"" who Phone Guy mentioned 

* Maybe is the Fredbear's from the fourth game, a little before the Bite of 87

* The Restaurant with the others animatronics who appears in Happiest Day

I think could be the second Fredbear's or the Happiest Day animatronics, because:

* Fredbear and Toy Spring Bonnie are suits too, soo maybe a guy can put him in the suit and will kill you

* Shadow Fredbear and Shadow Spring Bonnie are in this restaurant, soo..

* Is a new group of Animatronics and mysteries

First of all, my first theory is [why the Phantoms aren't hallucinations](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/49m1ph/theory_the_phantoms_arent_hallucinations/), if you wanna see, read this theory first and go to the other theory, because i think you will like :P

Warning: My english isn't 100% good, if you don't understand anything what i say, sorry

So, we will understand who is Jay

I will start with a question:

What is Jay Jay?

I search a long time ago about what is the significance of JJ, and i found some interesting thing...

In Chinese language, JJ sounds like a word, who in they language is ""Old Sister""...

So yeah, she is the old sister from Balloon Boy!

Okay, she is the sister of BB, but where she is from?

Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria...

No the first reastaurant with Spring Freddy, Spring Bonnie and Golden Cupcake

The restaurant with Original Freddy, Original Bonnie, Original Chica, Cupcake, Original Foxy and Puppet

(Obs: I call the Un-withereds Originals, just because is more easy call they like that :P)

Yeah, she is from the restaurant after FNaF 2!

That's makes so many sense, because she is old than BB, and the only thing we see about her is a drawning of her in the OFFICE OF FNAF 2! 

(This maybe involved other theory about the restaurant of the Originals is the same of the FNaF 2, but for now we will don't talk about that theory)

""Okay, but if she is the time of the Originals, why she isn't withered?""

Because is the same reason why whe never see a Withered Cupcake or a Withered Toy in FNaF 3...

PLASTIC!

She and Cupcake are the only animatronics who are made of plastic in the time of the Originals!

And the Toys are made of plastic too, and thats why they are in perfect form in the box in the office of FNaF 3!

This material take YEARS to discompose, then the material can survive more than thirthy years!

The Withereds/Originals are made of leather, and yeah is a strong material, but he can't survive a lot of time than the plastic!

Joking Jester is in the Parts and Services room, in a place who the camera can't see her, with Withered Foxy, Withered Golden Freddy and maybe with the Cupcake too!

     TL:Dr
     * JJ is more old than BB
     * JJ is from the restaurant of the Un-Withereds (Originals), before FNaF 2
     * She isn't withered because she is made of plastic, like the Cupcake

Spring Bonnie has his form in Freddy's

Shadow Bonnie has his Spring Bonnie form

Shadow Freddy has his Fredbear and Classic Freddy forms

Also, the Un-Withereds too

- Shadow Spring Bonnie

- Toy Spring Bonnie (Fredbear)

- Original Freddy, Original Bonnie, etc...

Is like you discover Good really don't exist

And what is the point of this post? Make drama?

No, im here to explain the teaser, in my represetation

First of all, what are the REAL significate?

Scott was sad about a lot of people hatig FNaF World, and he makes this teaser with the phrase: **See what you've all done**

But for me, now this has other significate

For me is like he saying this to the people who belives Mangle did the Bite of 87, but they wants a new game

And maybe this new game is bassed on the Easter Egg of FNaF 1 about 1-9-8-7 night

Because, i think in the original concept, the third game was the last, but no, the people wanted more

And maybe this teaser is like Adventure Mangle is the represetation of the theory about Mangle did the Bite of 87

Is dead

Because the people wanted like this

Is the same case of Purple Guy is Phone Guy, is a lie, but a lot of people turned sad after discover this

Well, we can't change the story, Fredbear did the Bite of 87, but for me, this teaser represent the death about Mangle did the Bite of 87 Theory

If the tapes of FNaF 2 are recorded before FNaF 2

And Fredbear's Familly Dinner (FNaF 4) openned after FNaF 2 tapes and before FNaF 2...

So Fredbear really did the Bite?

Look, i was saying he can't did the Bite because the FNaF 4 child needs be dead before FNaF 2, and in FNaF 2 Phone Guy says ""They walk in the day!"", so this is before the Bite of 87

But IF the tapes are recorded, so when he says ""They walk in the day"" is before when the restaurant clossed in the first time, and before he re-openned again in FNaF 2

But he says ""Fredbear's was clossed for years"", and wee see Fredbear's in FNaF 4 (and FNaF 4 IS IN 87), so FNaF 4 is after the tapes and before FNaF 2

But in FNaF 2 we don't know if the Toys walk in the day, and probably not, so this significates the bite of 87 is already happened?

Look, if you don't get, i will explain:

(THIS TIMELINE IS **IF** THE FNaF 2 TAPES ARE RECORDED)

- Freddy's V3 (Toys Era) oppened, and here happened the calls of Phone Guy 
- Freddy's V3 closses, after the second muders
- Fredbear's V2 (FNaF 4) re-open, after years
- Freddy's V3 re-open (This is when FNaF 2), and the calls before the first closse down is now recorded

So, after the restaurant close down in the first time, happens the Bite of 87 in Fredbear's (FNaF 4)? Because the child is already possessing Withered Golden Freddy (or Shadow Freddy, or Paper Pal Budy, whatever)

Also, remember the 1-9-8-7 night in FNaF 1 and appears Classic Golden Freddy? 

So he jumpscares because he dead in 87 OR because he dead in the Bite of 87?

Also, if the Bite of 87 is in Fredbear's, why the Freddy's stop using the Toys? I think they need something like one of them make a accident to be in no more fuction

Maybe we will finally see him moving in this game called ""FNaF: Sister Location""

Shadow Cupcake appears in four cameras, and if you clicked, you go to minigame Chica's Party

Also i can't understand why the people call him Phantom Cupcake, why????

So if you read my theory about the phantoms, you know is impossible one more phantom existed, also the cupcake is TOTALLY BLACK! Is obvius is a Shadow animatronic

Yeah with """", because he existed, hallucinations don't, and he is like the shadows -_-

But first we talk about the Golden Cupcake

We never see him in the game after this

I have a theory he was from the first Freddy's, with Spring Bonnie and Spring Freddy

But we don't see him in the minigame Stage 01...

Also, maybe the Shadow Cupcake is a shadow version of the Golden Cupcake, that's makes sense right?

But, the Shadows are the shadows from the Fredbear's animatronics (Shadow Fredbear and Shadow Toy Spring Bonnie, before they new forms in FNaF 2) so...

Okay is confusing, but if the Shadow Cupcake is a shadow from Golden Cupcake, henneeds to belong to Fredbear's, like the originals Shadows, right?

Is so fucking confusing, but we never see Toy Spring Bonnie before FNaF 4, but we see Shadow Toy Spring Bonnie in Stage 01, so he existed in that time, right?

So if we never see Toy Spring Bonnie before FNaF 4, maybe the Golden Cupcake belongs to him, right?

FNaF 3 and FNaF 4 have differences in theirs plots:

FNaF 3 talk about the first Freddy's, and the end of the Shadows

FNaF 4 talk about the Fredbear's franchise, and maybe the beginning of the Shadows

So what is the point?

I don't know!

Just Scott can explain that story to us...

But now you read my entire post and you maybe are laughing because i belive Golden Cupcake and Shadow Cupcake existed...

BUT THINK ABOUT THAT! IF THEY ARE JUST EASTER EGGS OR HALLUCINATIONS, WHY SCOTT PUT THEY IN THE GAME????? UH?

That's why i belive in they

And you stop laughing because i know you belive Toy Spring Bonnie is female you dumb

So yeah, i want your opinion about that, you belive in they or not? If belive, why is your explaination?

So yeah, the guy who in the past said ""Spring Freddy MAYBE CAN'T EXISTED"" know changes of opinion

Why?

That simple! I found OTHERS PROVES!

First of all, who started all this?

Phone guy, lets talk about that call:

""Right now, we have ***2 specially designed suits***, that double as both animatronic and suit! So please, pay close attention while learning how to operate these **SUITS**, as accidents/injury/death/irreparable and grotesque maiming can occour. First we will discuss how to operate the mascots when they are in Animatronic form.""

""Uh, hello? Hello, hello! Uhm, there has been a slight change of company policy, concerning you and the **SUITS**. Uhm, so. After learning of an unfortunate incident at the sister location involving multiple and simultaneous spring lock failures, the company has deemed the ***suits*** temporaily unfit for employees. Safety is top priority at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, which is why the ***classic suits*** are being retired to an appropriate location, while being looked at by our technicians. Until replacements arrives, you'll be expected to wear the temporary costumes provided to you. Keep in mind, they were found on very short notice, so questions about appropriateness/relevance should be deflected. I repeat, the **CLASSIC SUITS*** are not to be touched, activated or worn. That being said, we are free of liability, do as you wish. As always, remember to smile. You are the face of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.""

Okay, so you maybe se parts i put * two or three in the word ""suits"":

***suits*** = Is the word suit is talking about Golden Bonnie and Fredbear OR Golden Bonnie and Spring Freddy

**SUITS** = Is the parts who the word is talking about Golden Bonnie and **Spring Freddy**

(OBS: Golden Bonnie is how i call Spring Bonnie-01, Un-Withered Springtrap, Spring Bonnie from FFP or whatever, i am thinkig about Golden Bonnie [FFP] or Toy Spring Bonnie [FFD], why i am invent this names? Because is more easy to make a difference to the two, beucase when i say Spring Bonnie i talk about one or the other, and is difficult to make difference in theirs names, OK? OK!)

If you see, in the parts with **SUITS** is obvius the Freddy's has other Spring Lock animatronic

And in the parts with ***suits*** Phone Guy maybe is talking about Fredbear or Spring Freddy, he don't makes this especific, NOW ACCEPT THAT!

But yeah, after this, Spring Freddy existed!

BUT we don't know the golden Freddy in the Stage 01 is Spring Freddy or Original Golden Freddy

""WAIT WAIT! You say Spring Freddy existed! Finally, BUT THIS MAKES GOLDEN FREDDY A GHOST! HE NEVER EXISTED!""

Hehe

I will never accept Golden Freddy is a ghost, because is so fucking strange, and Scott can't make this with one of the original seven, you understand my point?

And how i can't prove he isn't a ghost?

Withered Golden Freddy doesn't has the sames withered parts like Withered Freddy, if he is a ghost he needs mimic with something like the Shadows

""BUT HE DISSAPEAR AND APPEAR YOU IDIOT!""

For me and his posses, he doesn't has Endoskeleton, just the soul of the child can control him...

Maybe he was created to take place Spring Freddy, but the restaurant maybe change his color likes a bear, or something like that...

That explain everything for you? No? So respect my opinion

Btw, back again

We don't know the golden Freddy in Stage 01 is Spring Freddy or Original Golden Freddy, BUT we know Spring Freddy existed! And maybe Scott will makes a Adventure form for him in a future or something

     TL;Dr
     * Phone Guy says in the calls existed two spring locks suits in his restaurant, so that's prove Spring Freddy really existed
     * For me Golden Freddy isn't a ghost, because Withered Golden Freddy
     * Scott needs make difference in the two Spring Bonnies names ;-;

That's all guys!

So fisrt, the spring lock uses springs (really?), so maybe the ""SLE"" uses a Endo and Springs, right?

Er no, because if you see Springtrap, he has a Endo feet different to the others principal two, and when we see the face of Purple Guy, maybe he has a different head, to put a human head, and backward he has some metal parts and eyes, also we can't forgget about the five fingers and how they move, and they have a metal part, different to the toys fingers.

So existed a SLE?

Well, i think...

But if existed no just one?

Remember the 4th Night Minigame in FNaF 4?

Wee see two Endoskeletons, well we can confirm the black one is the Spring Lock, but the silver? Is or is the Endo-02?

He is the Endo-02 or a especial SLE just for a one animatronic (maybe Fredbear, because he is fat)?

Well, we can't say he is or not :/

The only thing i can say is his arm, and he has 4 fingers, but if is a hidden finger backwards the 4th finger? Yeah don't hate me i speculate so much ;-;

But IF they are THREE SLE?

Well, we just see ""two"" (maybe one) SLEs, but if the SLE of Freddy's is different to the Fredbear's? 

We can't compare the black sprite with the Springtrap Endo, but maybe there is the same, or not...

Well the only thing we can say there is a Spring Lock Endoskeleton, but we can't say existed others two, like Spring Freddy...

So yeah, you belive existed one SLE? Maybe two? Maybe three? Or everything what i said is bullshit?

No no no, not a hallucination you little smart, animatronic ghost like the three Shadows and the Phantoms

But i never belives that, why? Is so fucking injust, because... I don't know! Golden Freddy was should be real!

Wait wait, i don't saying the Shadows and the Phantoms aren't real, they are, but Golden Freddy....

Is strange to think he was never be a REAL ANIMATRONIC....

Is strange, no?

* He kills you, different to the Phantoms do. ""BUT THE PHANTOMS ARE HALLU...' SHUT THE FUCK UP
* His Withered form is different to the Withered Freddy, if he was a ghost, he needs mimic something, like the Shadows...

So, a lot of people says about a mysterius animatronic called ""Spring Freddy"", obviously a springlock Golden Freddy

But i never understand why the people BELIVE he existed

Well im here make another theory (who a lot of people will hate me so much to talk about another complicated situation) to discover why Spring Freddy **MAYBE CAN'T** existed

Okay, first of all, i want talk how i love so much a theorist called LAK132, because he made a awesome theory called ""The Two Spring Bonnies"", and how he explain that theory, saying too Fredbear and Golden Freddy aren't the same!

But i see one thing im him, he used so much the minigames.

And he calls the Golden Freddy in Stage 01 ""Spring Freddy""

And i think after this, a lot of people belives he existed, but yeah...

**SO DON'T HATE ME LAK, IT'S JUST A THEORY**

Okay, so Spring Freddy is a animatronic who belongs to Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria, with Golden Bonnie (AKA Spring Bonnie01) and Golden Cupcake (this is speculation, but i belives he belongs to FFP too). 

For some people, Spring Freddy is Withered Golden Freddy, but for other people isn't...

So first i will say he is Withered Golden Freddy:

He can't

Because if we see Withered Golden Freddy:

* He don't have five fingers
* His entire suit isn't likes from a spring lock animatronic
* His Endoskeleton (maybe Endo-02) isn't like a Spring Lock Endoskeleton (we really don't know really exist a SLE, but for now exits)

""BUT HIS 4 FINGOR ARE TO FAT, SO CAN BE PUT 2 FINGERS IN 1 FINGER, RIGHT?""

No, a Spring Lock animatronic needs 5 skinny fingers

Ok, but IF Spring Freddy isn't the Original Golden Freddy (AKA Un-Withered Golden Freddy)?

Ok, so why the restaurant will created another Freddy?

Spring Freddy maybe is the first Freddy, and after him the restaurant put Original Freddy from Fredbear's &amp; Friends in his place, but why the restaurant put another Freddy, called Golden Freddy?

And we never see a Withered or normal Spring Freddy in the games

""YES, THE FREDDY IN STAGE 01""

Maybe not, because if the Freddy in Stage 01 is Spring Freddy, or he is Withered Golden Freddy, well this is impossible because my reasons, or he is Spring Freddy and the restaurant created a Golden Freddy with Freddy, and that's makes any sense

But, i can't say he don't existed, because we have one thing:

Phone Guy call in FNaF 3

In one part he says:

""Now we have TWO SPRING LOCK SUITS...""

SO SPRING FREDDY REALLY EXISTED?!!

Maybe

Because in that time, the restaurant is belongs to Fazbear Entertainment, and they are owner from Fredbear &amp; Friends too...

Maybe the two Spring Locks he was talking is Golden Bonnie (AKA Spring Bonnie01) and Fredbear!

But... Fredbear belongs to another restaurant, soo... Wut?

Yeah i'm like that, but maybe i have a explanation for that:

Maybe after the incident with the Spring Locks failures, the company maybe put Fredbear and Spring Freddy in no more fuction, and they created the Original Golden Freddy to put him in the place who Spring Freddys was, and after this, they put Golden Bonnie (AKA Spring Bonnie01) too, and they open the restaurant again with the four Originals, Puppet, Cupcake and JJ...

But this don't have so much sense... You agree with me?

So the conclusion is:

     TL;Dr
     * Spring Freddy can't be Withered Golden Freddy
     * We don't know if Spring Freddy existed or not, but after these all, maybe we can say never existed a Spring Freddy


And that's all!

So, in the final we see all the masks in the floor, and the balloons flying away...

They are free? NO

They are going to possess the animatronics

Why? Puppet give the party who Golden Freddy wants, because in his life, his party starts with bullying and tears, and finish with a tragedy

The child needs a party, so Puppet make the party, with they friends, to in the final, they possess the animatronics to start they revenge...

Also, in the Bad Ending, we don't see the Puppet mask

ALSO, we just see five Crying Child's in the 5th Night Minigame

So why Puppet don't go with the childrens?

Because his revenge isn't finish

Purple Guy still ""alive"", and he needs to take the others childrens with him to the same place with the first five...

But the toys is in no more fuction, so he turns the souls into GHOSTS

That's why they can't touch or kill you

""BUT THE PUPPET APPEARS IN HIS NORMAL FORM IN CAM 6!!!""

Exactly! THAT IS A HALLUCINATION!

He is confusing you, to take your attetion in the Camera to ""attack"" you in the office

Also, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME HE DOES THIS!

Remember FNaF 2? Remember his face in the camera of the hallway with the bathrooms to the corner?

He makes these hallucinations to attack you when you look in the camera

But in the mechanic of the game he will attack you in all situations, but think in the real life, he needs to attack you when you are distracted...

THIS ARE HALLUCINATIONS, BUT THE PHANTOMS DON'T! THAT IS WHAT YOU NEED UNDERSTAND!

And, talk about they revenge again, maybe is him who sets on fire the Fazbear's Fright to finish Purple Guy once of all...

""AH, OK YOU LITTLE SHIT, BUT THE TEASER ITS ALL IN YOUR MIND?

Finally the teaser!

Ok, if i told you this is a lie?

But, who is saying that?

The Phantoms? No, is you

Your Head

Well, when i say you i talk about the Security Guy

You say that, ""the Phantoms aren't real"", ""they will never catches me""

You say that to not scary with it, to stay calm and control the cameras and survive to Springtap

But, you can't, you still scary with they, and they put erros in the systems

How the errors appears? Of nowhere? No, they do that, and you still saying that this is all your mind, but isn't

Also, maybe they do that with yours systems to you get out of the place, to Springtrap don't kill you, and they put the place on fire, like the music Chica of Groundbreaking...

Also, talk about musics, can i tell a exemple of the situation of the security guard?

This is the End

Ok, i know that music is not composed from Scott, but think and read these verses:

""Just tell yourself that this is all in your head""

""This can't be real
It's in my head""

""We're voices in your head""

Is the sam situation of the Security Guard!

You still saying these Nigtmares are just things of your mind, but they aren't, and they say to belive they are, to confuse your head and kill you more easily...

""BUT THE NIGHTMARES AREN'T REAL TOO, AND THIS MUSIC IS FROM NATE, NOT FROM SCOTT, SO IT'S NOT OFFICAL YOU STUPID, YOU ARE CRAZY?""

Look, i don't really know the Nightmares are real or not, but for me they are

""WHAT? YOU SAY THE PHANTOMS ARE REAL NOW YOU SAY THE NIGHTMARES ARE TOO? WHO ARE YOU? A FUCKING BABY USING A NAME FROM A FAMOUS GAME WHO SAY A LOT OF SHIT? GET OUT OF THIS COMMUNITY, THIS PLANET, THIS UNIVERSE YOU LITTLE SHIT BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH...""

Look, first of all, i can stay where i want, and talk abou my opinion, because this community is public

Second:

Everyone belives JJ are a hallucinations
Everyone belives the Shadows are hallucinations
Everyone belives Endo-02 are a hallucination

But they aren't, like the Phantoms and the Nightmares, and a lot of others animatronics

Scott confirm in the FNaF World Teasers these four animatronics are real, so, why the Phantoms can't be real too?

Why everyone say before the FNaF World teasers they are hallucinations?

Because they can't explain what they can't understand

Every animatronic, every charachter, every thing who breath, walk or move, is real

So, i will finish this theory with a little text:

""They can't explain what they can't understand""

     TL;Dr 
     * The Phantoms Aren't Hallucinations, just the souls of the Toys animatronics transform into ghosts by the Puppet
     * The Happiest Day is a party for the Golden Freddy soul before they possess the animatronics
     * Puppet still in the earth with the toys souls and he put the Fazbear's Fright on fire
     * They can't be in the mind of Mike because Phantom Freddy and Phantom Foxy are in Withered forms, and Jeremy or Fritz are old
     * Phantom Bonnie doesn't exists because Foxy and Mangle are the most popular and favorite animatronics to the fandom, if they don't be in the game, a lot of people will talk about this to Scott, and the game has a Bunny animatronic

So, thank you to read this theory, that is my first theory what i post here, and i confirm everyone will hate me in this months when i will post here.
And i pray so much you belives in my theory, but if you don't, ok i can't to say what do you need belive

Bye!
