Yesterday, I hit the cap and got the message that says no more gold for you today. I was so in the groove I decided to keep playing multiplayer anyway. Won another game and afterwards I said ""huh""?! The game gave me 30 gold. Played another, won, and again 30 gold. This kept happening all day. Has the cap disappeared? Or is this just a very fortunate bug?",magicduels,No Gold Cap??!,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicduels/comments/56ry9i/no_gold_cap/
