0,This RDA has always been fine. But I did try adjusting the pins. It still reading much higher than the coil is built to.,2016-03-24 16:39:10+00:00,d1bxsz7,2,t1_d1bu2iy,4957,electronic_cigarette
1,I force it to read a new coil often. But it is not reading anywhere close to what it should anymore.,2016-03-24 16:38:18+00:00,d1bxrie,4,t1_d1bv0hp,3612,electronic_cigarette
2,That's the problem. I've had this Koopor Plus since the beginning of Feburary. It's always read accurately on anything I've put on if. But since yesterday it hasn't read anything right.,2016-03-24 13:13:10+00:00,d1bpb42,2,t1_d1booha,1238,electronic_cigarette
3,Thanks! That does look very similar!,2016-03-18 18:29:58+00:00,d14t3s1,2,t1_d14s22z,1473,whatsthissnake
4,Turns out it was the juice. I guess green apples taste like Clorox and rubber to whoever mixed that batch. Tasted just as bad on a different tank.,2016-02-23 20:40:28+00:00,d0b15vc,7,t1_d0b0cyo,1016,electronic_cigarette
5,See it started happening on a coil I had ran for a few days with no problems.,2016-02-23 20:18:09+00:00,d0b03xy,5,t1_d0azru6,437,electronic_cigarette
6,I was loving that tank too. Now I have to use my triton 2 which isn't terrible but not nearly as good. I've never built but Hopefully I'll be able to build a nice setup for my velocity which I just got yesterday.,2016-02-23 19:55:26+00:00,d0az2o9,3,t1_d0axw40,1558,electronic_cigarette
7,No but it is not like a nasty juice gunk taste. More like a chemical taste.,2016-02-23 19:06:33+00:00,d0awuqm,2,t1_d0avpqn,1489,electronic_cigarette
8,I am new to Reddit and I am on my phone. When I tap the reply button nothing happens. But anyway I am not talking about the new coil taste because it happened to a coil I had been using without issue. But when I changed coils the taste was still there.,2016-02-23 19:03:07+00:00,d0awp61,1,t3_4781q1,1554,electronic_cigarette
