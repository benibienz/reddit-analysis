I have tried Forcing it to read a new coil by removing the RDA and holding the fire button. I have replaced the batteries. I have tried ""resetting"" the board by holding down fire for 12 seconds with no batteries installed. Still reads way off.",electronic_cigarette,Koopor Plus OHM's off,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/4bq897/koopor_plus_ohms_off/

I've had the TFV4 for a while now. I've used the quads the triples and the sextuple coils. All great imo. But now I'm having a problem. I was vaping this morning and I was getting a little low on juice in my tank with a triple coil installed. No problem. Flip the cap open fill with a new juice (different flavor) and go to town on it. one problem. Tastes like ass.  I assume that maybe the juice was low enough the wick had dried up and I didn't give the new juice enough time to wet it. I run to my local shop and buy a new coil (wound up getting a free sextuple one as well). Pop in the new triple coil prime it, fill it, and wait. 15 minutes and a few no power draws later and I fire it at 50w to test it. Low flavor and density as expected. Move up in ten watt increments as i usually do with a new coil and start noticing the terrible taste is still there.  Pop in the sextuple. This time I wait THIRTY minutes after priming and filling and you guessed it, still bad taste. Any ideas?? 
 
Let me add that it's not a nasty juice gunk taste it is a burnt type taste.
