1,"I'm using cooler ""Noctua NH-L12"". yeap my computer is working like a radiator, emits a lot of heat. Maybe you could lead me to safe, well explained site for newbies how to overclock my computer? I was trying to do it with MSI afterburner on my GPU, but it makes things even worse. Btw. maybe its possible that my computer gets BSOD because of to high temperature? in my room fells like 25-28C while I'm playing.

2,"Hello everyone. I have asrock motherboard and it lets me to turn on X-boost, but after I'm playing games with it on high graphics (rust, ark survival evolved, the culling, etc.) my computer freezes and getting blue screen. Blue screen says: *** STOP: 0x00000101 (0x0000000000000019, 0x0000000000000000, 0x0FFFFF88003317180, 0x0000000000000006).

My PC specs: Motherboard: ASRock 970 Extreme3 R2.0 CPU: OctalCore AMD FX-8350, 4100 MHz GPU: AMD Radeon R9 290 (Hawaii) 4gb DDR5 512bit RAMs: Crucial BLS8G3D18ADS3 8gb - x2 Sticks

Without X-boost seems I do not have that problem, but without X-boost I lose FPS. Please help me

Edit: my PC frozen and gave same Blue screen even without X-boost mode enabled when I was playing CS:GO
