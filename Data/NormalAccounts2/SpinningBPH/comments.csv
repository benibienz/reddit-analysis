1,It truly is - I am the current renter. My husband and I are closing on a house in Rockville so we are moving out and are just helping to advertise. We have LOVED living here and it will be very bittersweet to leave.,2016-07-11 03:13:44+00:00,d57fm2s,2,t1_d579tgf,10127,washingtondc

6,"Welcome! My husband, 1 year old golden doodle and I live in a basement apartment of a rowhouse in capitol east, right next to Lincoln Park. We absolutely love it here, the neighborhood is amazing. Restaurants/bars and the eastern market metro are about a 12 minute walk away. Lincoln Park becomes an unofficial dog park (but it is not enclosed) and we also love Kingman Park and the best is Congressional Cemetery for dog walking - check it out!",2016-06-20 17:42:07+00:00,d4gvt3i,1,t3_4ov0xv,76494,washingtondc

9,"Thank you so much, this is helpful. Why did you choose the county immersion school over TB (because of the high ESL/low PTA)? Was it hard to get them into a county immersion school?",2016-06-15 20:00:16+00:00,d4amw6u,2,t1_d4am56z,906,RockvilleMD
