27,"I've seen numerous good things about the hinge pin from Mike. And my pro hunter does have a bit of a wiggle when open. The trigger is also a touch heavy. A stronger lock up spring doesn't sound like a bad idea at all. 

It's possible to float the forearm, just not in the traditional sense. Floating a pro hunter forearm gets the edges away from the barrel, either via pillars, o rings or a hanger bar. It helps mitigate the need for exact forearm placement during shooting. 

I was referring to a barrel maker like Bullberry, and a few others which names escape me right now. 

I know there's a potential for head space issues on a single shot, that was my biggest concern. 

I'm aware that it's not supposed to 'eject' shells like an H&amp;R rifle, but merely pop them out to grab. My issue is that it won't even pop them out. The extractor lip glides past the shell.
