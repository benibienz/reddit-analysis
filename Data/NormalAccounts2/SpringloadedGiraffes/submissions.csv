I've been lurking around your sub for the last week or two, looking at all the different advice on various things. 

I was raised with poor financial discipline, and am trying to take responsibility through a savings account. 

I have my day to day banking done with Scotia bank, but feel a different account would discourage me from spending. I've been sorta looking into Tangerine, as I've seen it mentioned lots on here. I just have one question: what's the difference between a regular savings account, and a TFSA? Other than the obvious ""tax free"" part. 

I'm going to be starting out small, biweekly amounts of $250 into my savings.  Based on that, which account type should I go for? Thanks for any and all input!",PersonalFinanceCanada,Need a little help,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/4u8k14/need_a_little_help/

My criteria:
Moose 100-400 yards
Deer 100-400
Good for learning long range (600+)
Cool but moderate ease to reload (changed)
Ideally mild recoil, 338 wm was not my friend. 

I was thinking 308 or 300wm, but like short cases, and was thinking of trying a weird/wildcat caliber. Please help!",longrange,Need some help!,https://www.reddit.com/r/longrange/comments/4o5z98/need_some_help/

That being said, there is a few issues I'd like to address,and I'm hoping anyone in the great white north who owns one will have some insight. 


1. Is there a Canadian retailer for the Mike bellm stuff? I'd love to get the hinge pin, trigger kit, hammer kit and lock up spring kit. (And anything else I might need).

2. What is the best way to float the front end? Pillars or hanger bar? Is there a certain way to pillar bed them, or  is there a retailer in Canada that sells hanger bars? Does screw  torque make that HUGE a difference? 

3. Any Canadian places to get aftermarket barrels that aren't T/C made?

4. Is it difficult to reload for a single shot? Is it true you have to full length size or the shell won't eject? 

5. My current barrel is having issues extracting spent shells. I've emailed the S&amp;W center, and they told me to ship them the barrel so they can 'adjust' the extractor. Is this the only option, or is there an aftermarket solution?


I've looked up answers to these questions numerous times, and have gotten conflicting answers. I really love the look and feel of this gun, so I'd like to solve the issues it has so I don't get forced to sell it.

Obviously, if you look them up, the accuracy reviews are very hit and miss, more so leaning towards negative. The problem is, most of the reviews are from early/mid 2000.

So, has anyone purchased a recent one and have any input? Has Thompson Center stood up and made them a little more consistent? Or are they still riddled with issues?

I recently picked up a Rem 700 sps tac, the 20"" heavy barrel .308 version. It comes dressed in the original stock with the grey inserts where hand placement is. 

I'm already looking to upgrade too a better stock/chassis, and wanted to know if anyone here has any input on the magpul hunter setup with the DBM bottom metal kit. Or if someone wanted this same stock but found a better option?

The big reason I like the magpul hunter is the quick and decently priced conversion to the ACIS(AICS?) magazines , and it's ergonomics. 

My gun will primarily be a hunting rifle, with some target shooting maxing at 800 yards. Any and all input or recommendations are greatly appreciated!",canadaguns,Magpul hunter or ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaguns/comments/48sgc3/magpul_hunter_or/

I'm mainly interested in getting a savage 111 in 7mmRemMag with an MDT LSS chassis. No idea on the stock yet. 
I've spent enough time with a crappy rem770 in 7mmRm to know two things:


1.7mmRm is a fun caliber, and definitely the choice for me, and 2. That will probably kick like hell in a chassis that light!


So now I'm asking, would that caliber in an LSS chassis be a shoulder killer? I really like the idea of a light magnum I can walk with, but still bench shoot 700 yards for giggles.  Advice?",longrange,Recoil help,http://www.reddit.com/r/longrange/comments/3be1fc/recoil_help/
