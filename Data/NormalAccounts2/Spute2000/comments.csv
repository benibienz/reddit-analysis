16,"You've got a pretty good athletic swing.  It sounds like you compress the ball good.  What I see:

1) your take away starts by twisting your left wrist.  This probably means you are bringing it around so that the club head is inside your hands and will be laid off at the top.  A drill to help this is to put a ball directly behind your club head so that when you start your backswing, it pushes the ball backwards.  It should roll back along the target line.  Think 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock. Push the ball back to 3 o'clock.

2)  You begin your downswing by lunging forward towards your target.  Keep your body quiet and rely on a good shoulder turn to generate the power.  You'll be surprised how effective that is.  ",2016-10-07 17:48:18+00:00,d8i5l31,1,t3_569d15,52805,golf

- I give appropriate gimmes and take them when offered.  It speeds things up and improves morale within the group. 

- I play my hole out as many strokes as my handicap allows.  The most I can take is a 7 so if I am laying 7 and not on the green, I pick up and write 7X on the card.   Yes- it happens. Don't judge.  If you do not have a handicap, be mindful of where your partners are.  If they are laying two and waiting to putt and you are still trying to hack your ball out of the bushes and laying 7, PICK IT UP.   Take a triple bogey or something and move on.   

- All OB's are played as such and stroke and distance apply. Provisionals are always hit.  

- I never improve my lie.  That said I won't put a swing on a ball if there is a potential to hurt myself or damage my clubs.  I don't get paid to play so I don't care what people think.  If you are playing with me and facing the same situation, I'll tell you to move it or move it for you.  It isn't worth it.  

- Breakfast balls are ok by me.  

In a tournament, none of the above apply.  It's strictly by the rules for good or for bad.  Also, if you play a money game, establish what is acceptable right away.  ",2016-09-26 20:06:42+00:00,d833m1t,1,t3_54l32v,17262,golf

Down swing- you lift up as you swing down which will cause you to thin the ball you did.  Stay level and keep your body quiet throughout the swing.

106,"Both points of view will never be satisfied under any single decision.  Given that:

One solution-  Stop micro-officiating golf.  Stop allowing anyone with a tv to call in an infraction.  No other sport allows it.  Only those who are hired to officiate should do so and we accept the outcome of their decisions, no matter how good or bad.  How many football, basketball, and baseball games have missed calls?  Every one them but we see uncalled penalties on damn near every play.  If you took digital officiating out of it and left it to the players and officials (a centuries old method), things would get missed for sure, like the sand issue.  So let's ask ourselves the question- Can we be ok with that?  If an infraction happens that is so minuscule that we cannot see it beyond reasonable doubt, is it possible that it is so insignificant that it could not have benefited the player in that instance?  In other words, did Nordqvist REALLY gain an advantage by knocking that sand?  The game is already technical enough that I feel officiating down to this level is very, very bad for the game.    

Another solution-  put a camera on every move of every player from the first swing on Thursday to the last on Sunday and have a team of referees sitting in a booth reviewing in real time.  I believe the field is entitled to the same level of scrutiny as the leader is under on Sunday.  For example, if you have a 2-way tie for 15th place and your opponent moves a grain of sand, it could mean a few grand to you.   But is this answer good for the game?  I think it ruin it.

But golf is a self-policing game where honor and integrity are the fabric of the sport.  It is a game of inches and degrees and evidenced by yesterdays incident, the infraction would have gone unnoticed to any human eye if they were standing in the bunker with her.  I can say with some confidence that she did not intentionally bump the grain of sand.  Further, it is likely that this subtle error/infraction happens more often and and in varying scenarios than we might think.

They do not hit as far as the TM's but that is ok.  The trade-off is that they hit higher and thus, have less roll.

Gary is in for par.  The example does not say where he placed the ball.

Some recommendations:
Trump is entirely over rated.  The views are great but the golf doesn't quite meet the price point.  I would suggest going further south to Orange County and take in Pelican Hill and Monarch.  The courses are better and the amenities are great.  You get incredible ocean views and, well, it's not as tough to get to.  Trump is anything but convenient.  In addition to Torrey, look into The Crossings and Aviara.  There are some good choices heading south from LA.  If you need some more suggestions let me know.

The right decision is to square up and make a true swing but take a 75% swing.   and 2) follow through.  Most mishits come from executing a decent swing until contact...then it's ""look up to see how sweet it is"" and the club stops moving thru the arc.  It's either a chunk or a blade across the green.

The difference on the score card is likely going to be the lack of penalty strokes on the easier course.  So what's the take-away??

254,"I just came from a lesson the other day correctly almost this same swing.  Here are the two big things I discovered and saw right away with yours:

1) on your take away at :12, your clubhead is behind your hands (at 7 on a clock).  It should be ahead of your hands (at 5 on a clock).

2) at :16 you have reached the top of your swing then you lift your right elbow up to get ""just a little more oomph"".  At :17 you killed everything you are striving to do!  Your club breaks plane and ""crosses over"" and is now pointing to the right. You then start to dive in to your downswing. Your left knee folds in towards center and now everything needs to be compensated for. You'll see at ;20 that you start to lift up which opens you to the right and that is exactly where you hit it.   

Pause the video and drag it slowly across to slow your slowmotion down even more.  You'll see a lot of movement in your body during the down swing which is almost entirely caused by over-cooking your backswing.

Take a look at any front facing video of a pro.  They rarely take their club past parallel.  You'll gain much more control and power scaling it back.  You just have to learn to trust it.  ",2015-09-30 00:09:08+00:00,cviqbou,1,t3_3mwchp,2346,golf
255,"It is possible it is interfering. There is no doubt that you will experience fatigue integrating a golf/weight lift routine into your life and the recovery time gets tougher as you get older.  It will take you a little time to adapt your swing to your increased strength and a little time to find your touch.  At least it was/is for me when I go to the gym a lot.  I don't lift the day before a meaningful round but will try to get a good one in two days before and then the day after.  If you go to the gym right after a round, be mindful of your back.  It has spent the better part of a day twisting and contorting in ways it really isn't meant to.  Then if you pile a ton of weight on top of an already exhausted back, it could be big trouble.

The other thing-  pause the video and take it to :08.

287,"Thanks for the compliment.  

I would need to know a bit more about your recording process.  But I'll take a stab at it...  The first approach I take is to work big to small.  That means- what do you sound like live and what elements of your live sound need to be captured in a recording.  The second is the songwriting.  Is it authentic story telling that has a beginning, an end, and an emotional peak.  Or is it a contrived, manufactured song that sounds like the band is just filling in the blanks.  And lastly, what is the band looking to achieve in a sound.  I'd ask you all to identify your top 3 recordings and tell me why you like them and if this is what you expect your band to sound like (each member has a different point of view on this). Then determine if we can make everyone in the band happy given the what we have to work with talent-wise, equipment-wise, and if you can afford to pay what you need to pay to get it.

To optimize your studio time, be prepared.  Record yourselves at practice.  Put your phone in the middle of the room and hit voice memos to record one song at a time.  You'll catch a number of natural elements of the band.  Second is to do some pre-production.  Rent some mics, a board, and mix down to a laptop (garage band, pro-tools if you have it, etc).  Play around with different mic setups with the drums.  If you have enough, mic each drum individually and do your best to isolate his sound.  If not, specific mics on snare, bass drum, high hat and overhead mics on cymbals and toms. LAY OFF THE EFFECTS.  The song you posted sounded like you had heavy gate and compression on the drums and it takes all ambiance out of the sound.  You can do all that in post production.    Take the same mic approach to your guitar.  Bass, keys, and vocals go direct.  Grab a few takes of a song then abandon that plan and put a few mics around the room and do a few live takes.  You might be surprised how good you sound that way.   At the end of the day, you have all the core recordings you need where you can now match and layer takes to see what works and what doesn't.  Add effects slowly and lightly.  It is so easy to over-effect a tone that it will fuck up the whole song.

good job of keeping an open mind.  Keep posting your stuff.   ",2015-09-03 15:01:09+00:00,cupasm0,3,t1_cuoouos,57382,Bass
288,"If you were striving for a retro 80's feel, you nailed it.  It has a serious Joy Division/INXS vibe.  

My unsolicited feedback is:

I would have asked for a bigger punch at the chorus.  The feel for the first :30 sets a great suspenseful tone and when the chorus hits, the keyboard is doing what the guitar should be doing.  Vocally he doesn't take advantage of the room he's given to use his instrument.  He stays in that monotone space when he could have blown the doors off his vocal range if he has any.     Nice bass riff and dynamics coming out of the chorus.  

Overall production sounds a bit flat.  The drums are all high hat and snare.  You are not lost in the mix but it's not driving it either. Two thoughts on that- keep the same bass line but play a low octave or stay where you are and go double time.  That should create the punch I want from this. If you drop the octave and bump the kick drum...it could get tasty.  The keyboard...well, let's just say it isn't kicking out a melody that is going to stay with me.  It got a bit much by the second verse.  Pull it down in the mix.  

Vocally it's not up to its potential.  Hitting ""fall into my engine"" with a double-track or harmony would not hurt.  Take a vocal run coming out of the chorus that helps build the tension into the first hit of the chorus.",2015-09-02 21:07:16+00:00,cuokr8c,1,t3_3jckjb,31629,Bass

In your opinion, are we ever likely to have the rule changed that would deem a fairway divot to be Ground Under Repair? It is one of my least favorite rules that penalizes a player for having achieved the objective of keeping the ball in play in the best possible condition of that particular hole.  If I hit a ball in a fairway, only to find it in a sand-filled or replaced divot , technically I see this as a man-made repair that temporarily alters the natural and INTENDED condition of the fairway.  Unfilled or unreplaced divots I view differently and will use this as the value proposition for the rule change:

Change the rule to allow any ball at rest in a sand-filled or replaced divot to be moved no closer to the hole.  No relief will be given if the divot is unfilled.  This should encourage more of the asswipes that don't fill divots to do so, thus promoting better healthcare for the course.

The Bankers Handicap formula uses two par 3's, 4's, and 5's each.

24 x 3 = 72

343,"The first step is having a clear understanding of the game you have, not the one you want. By that I mean, if you can't drive it 300, don't look to carry fairway bunkers, cut corners, etc.  Have a good idea of what your miss-hits are and when they might occur and make an adjustment.  For example, if you find you tend to miss fairways on the back side due to fatigue, use a 3 wood or a long iron to keep it in the fairway.  Also, having a game plan before a round and sticking to it helps.  I drive the ball an average of 270 but don't have a great FIR stat.  So for any par 4 that allows me to drive with my 4 iron to 200 yards or more and leaves me a wedge in, that is a no-brainer.  Why risk pumping one OB, into a hazard, or anywhere but the fairway with my driver, which has a high probability, when I can hit to a club that has an even higher probability of getting me a GIR.  Another valuable strategy is to just aim for the center of the green.  No golfer can hit it the ball on a dead line the exact same distance 2 times in a row.  We all experience a variance in the results.  So, aim for the center and let the ball leak left or right and hope that it leaks to the pin side!  If not, it's in the center, take your 2 putt par, go to the next hole and repeat.",2015-08-06 17:53:04+00:00,ctttcu9,1,t3_3g0lo3,7310,golf

It's tough from the camera angle but, is it looks as though your feet are aiming down the center of the fairway but the club head is aiming left.

427,"Think about the slingshot.  No one pulls back on it at the same speed it achieves when it's released.  Once I trusted that mentality, I gained so much more control and distance that my FIR stat become something to be proud of.  Slowing down your backswing and allowing for the pause at the top gives you the time to ensure you have committed to your swing thoughts.  

The other adjustment I made was to choke down on the grip about an inch.  It feels like a foot but I swear I didn't lose a yard in distance and the ball flight was far more consistent. ",2015-06-28 15:44:45+00:00,cslgr68,1,t3_3bdmxf,35950,golf

430,"Is your ball flight a fade?

It looks like you have a lot of forward press with your driver. If you brought the handle more towards the center of your body it might help align your shoulders a bit better.  The other thing I see is your right hand.  I would say that you could turn it over just a touch and extend it down the grip a little more.  Maybe take your palm from facing up to facing out towards the target.

Your iron swing looks pretty good dude.  You have the right hand grip adjusted on that setup unlike your driver.

432,"Do you think it's possible that Fowler and Speith might help usher in the new era of youth golfers?  

I hardly see teenagers at my local public course.  But what's interesting to me is that many teenage golfers I know that do play, are doing so at a very high level.  I think there are more playing at par or better than ever before.  But here's the rub- they are almost all playing at private clubs and are the children of upper class families.  It illustrates the polarizing effect of the sport -  teenagers can and do enjoy the game however in order to enjoy the game, they want unrestricted access and that doesn't come cheap. 

In my eyes, there isn't a better way for a kid to hang with a group of friends for 4-5 hours than by playing golf.  It forces them to abide by a set of rules of the course and the game.  Both of which expose you if the rules are broken.  ",2015-06-26 17:57:10+00:00,csjn8kt,2,t1_csjeffp,13583,golf

- Keep Buck and Norman. Get them a consultant and get to work tomorrow.  Faxon does not look good on tv so he has to go and should be replaced with Paul Goydos.  He's great on tv.  Buck wasn't stellar but to me, he showed some promise.  And the guy is a pro.  

- Find a way to carve some gallery-freindly space into the hills.  There has to be a way.   

- Get a quarter and flip it.  Heads= I replace the poa.  Tails= I don't.  

One thing to consider-  it is a very wet place typically.  We just caught it in an unusually dry time.  It's rainy through mid-july so it's likely to have a different outcome if the weather is ""normal"".  ",2015-06-22 23:47:10+00:00,csfc7k6,1,t3_3aquww,14544,golf
