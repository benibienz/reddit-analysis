The rules were invented long before cameras entered the sport.  So it is fair to suggest they shouldn't be the source that conveys infractions for any viewer (in person or not) to call the penalty?  I say no.  First, it's a game of honor and any pro is more often than not going to call the penalty on themselves.  Second, these pro tours each have a rules official with every group.  Those two ideas alone should be enough to monitor this great game. I guess what I am saying is, if you can't catch it with the naked eye (which was the extent of technology at the time the rule was created), in real time, then play on.  And by no means should anyone not directly involved in the group (players, caddies, officials) be allowed to call it in.  Imagine what would happen every NFL Sunday if we opened that up. 

I see the value of replay in other sports- it serves as a confirmation of a call, for good or for bad, made by a human at the time of the infraction.  I don't know of any other sport that allows the use of replay to determine an infraction, after the fact, and an assessment of penalty for said infraction doled out whenever the officials figure it out - all while the game continues.   Penalties are there to change the game - to punish one side and benefit the other.  By nature it creates competitive advantage.  But I think we need to act within reason, continue to serve the game as it has been done for centuries, and back off the literal ""grain of sand"" degree of examination that can only be caught by HD camera.  If we are not willing to do that, then let's blow the lid off this shit show and expand the use by posting cameras on every shot of every player no matter where they are on the leader board. It gives the guys out of contention a fair shake at improving their income by knocking competitors out of position over some grain of sand BS or oscillating ball dilemma that you gotta be sure is happening out there but goes unheard of or unnoticed.

I have now focused on compound lifts because it makes me feel better that I am hitting more areas in a single set/rep.  I see some body comp changes but I am still way too heavy for my taste.  I have cut way the eff back on carbs, sugars, and portion control.  I am still a 40"" waist and I need it to change.  I'd like to get to 190 and a 34"" waist.
