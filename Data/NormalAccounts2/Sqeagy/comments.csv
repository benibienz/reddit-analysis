32,"Cause it promoted special camping. Games would be drawn out in 3v3 (longer than usual) simply because people would just wait for the special to spawn in. Personally, I felt it was one of the worst times to be a fan of any 3v3 game modes simply because they took way too long to finish.

Of course, the idea might be better suited for 6v6, as that is 6 more people on the map running around. But 3v3s are too slow for that to be an effective counter. Especially since 3v3s, especially trials, have a lot of people rely on special. You kill a team fast enough, which does happen, you can repeatedly deny a team special, putting them at more of a disadvantage. ",2016-11-02 14:54:44+00:00,d9iejdg,8,t1_d9ie7zb,396,DestinyTheGame
33,"Yup. Except Invective and IB were worse cause you would get full ammo, switch while dead and have full special.

I personally believe that nerfing range on all shotguns isn't the problem. As a shotgun lover, I can honestly say that Party Crasher/Matador archetype might need a bit of a nerf in either the range department, or a nerf in the impact department. 

The stats that sucks about them currently is fire rate, stability and reload. But the problem with that is that with it's range, impact and the ability for most people familiar with their OHK range to close the gap easily make those stats irrelevant. 

Now, that might be the case for every shotgun mind you. Every shotgun user who is mobile enough can get the kill. But because of that archetype's range and impact, when two shotgun users charge one another, chances are if one of them is using that archetype, those shotguns can easily either get the kill with a sliver of health remaining, or it results in a trade. Which again, sounds like what would happen with most shotguns anyway. But the higher impact and range of these particular shotguns mean that more often that not, they're going to get kill mainly because if you're using a different shotgun (Patch A, Invective, etc..) you have to get closer than they do to actually secure the kill, while they have the advantage of their OHK range being a bit farther back.",2016-11-02 14:49:39+00:00,d9ieak6,8,t1_d9id616,1456,DestinyTheGame

35,"They did try starting with no special ammo to start, at least in 3v3 modes. But sidearms would start with ammo because of that perk, so the people would just switch when they died, have ammo and than camp special boxes.

122,"Just because my I have a high amount of shotgun kills doesn't mean I'm unbiased. No one's saying that shotguns didn't need the nerfs. What we're saying is that the things you want on a sniper would break snipers. A shotgun is accepted as a OHK weapon because it's range is close to very close range. Does it need a range nerf? Potentially. But a shotgun user will still be able to close the gap, as they learn how to be mobile. 

I don't use snipers. Probably the lowest amount of kills of all my weapons (but if anyone knows you would, right?) but I know how hard it is to use. I know that, as someone who would challenge snipers Pre-RoI, I would either get domed after shooting them with a pulse rifle, or it would leave me one shot, which would result in a quick swap of weapons or teamshot. I've seen good snipers post DLC continue to effectively use their snipers, and I've seen that I'm able to more effectively challenge snipers now with my pulse rifle, which is good. 

Shotguns had their nerfs. Snipers got theirs. Ultimately, Bungie made their choice not because what this sub felt, or what the other online boards felt. They made their choice based on info they gathered and tested themselves.

I can judge when to use my shotgun and when to use a primary. Just like a lot of people who play the game will most likely have more special kills than primary kills. 

If you're so busy giving away people's stats, you should provide your own before you go running your mouth and looking like a fool.

By the way, googling Destiny Shotgun Nerfs, shows at least 5 times shotguns received a range/perk/damage nerf, including having an entire perk remove. ",2016-10-02 05:20:00+00:00,d8agzg7,5,t1_d8agtlm,333,DestinyTheGame

You're pissed at shotguns, we get it. But you actually said that shotguns never got the nerf they deserved? Did you play this game at all?

As for invaders and parrying, just watch. As I've leveled up, I've noticed that you can stun lock people with two hits if they miss a parry before they're able to parry again. So if you hit twice, be careful about the third hit. At least in my experience, the third is either parried or they dodge out of the way to heal.

I personally use the vendor Patch A Shotgun. It's a very good roll, sporting Rangefinder and Rifled Barrel and it hs a better fire rate than a Conspiracy, so when I shade step around people's shotgun's blasts I can usually get two shots off before they can turn and fire another.

A Warlock's Sunsinger is also great for raiding and PvP (due to self rez and those Firebolt grenades which can hit multiple people) However in PvP, a well coordinated team/good sniper will easily shoot you down before your animation is even finished. If you do pick Warlock, I'd recommend leveling your Gunsmith so you can get the Tlaloc ASAP. It goes hand in hand with the Sunsinger subclass.
