I have a gold tier bounty from two weeks ago that I never finished because I stopped two games short. Not wanting to keep it any longer, I went to LFG and searched for a group, getting into one after about 5 minutes. I planned to get my games in quick and leave after the first loss. 

That plan went astray after we kept winning. We had some really close matches, thankfully securing the wins each time. We had a really close match at 6-0 where we got matched up against a team that was all 10+-0, all sun singers and got nervous. We started losing, to the point we were losing 4-3, the 4th round being a game where they all self rez'd and got the win despite being hit by a tether. We got into the next round and saw that one of them had been kicked out, costing them the match. I messaged one of them, saying we were sorry and that they should've won, but they were cool about and both teams wished GG to another. 

Our team kept trucking along, and to our mutual excitement we had hit 9-0, still holding our mercy. We got our adept rewards (I got my hand cannon back &lt;3) But we all agreed that we wanted the Scarab emblem. We kept going, winning the next two games, losing the third and our mercy. My two teammates were not as old as me, saying they had one more match in them to try and get it. We load up into the game. My teammate went real quiet.

Turns out, it was the same team where the third teammate lagged out. I messaged the guy I messaged before, giving a friendly ""Round 2?"" And was happy to see ""Rematch :)"". We didn't do so good, so whenever both my teammates died I ran around the map and picked up all the special. Needless to say we lost 5-1. I got an invite to the other teams party after it ended, surprised to see a friend request from the guy who messaged me. When I joined, the first thing they did was wish me a GG. The 2nd thing they did was talk about how I was driving them crazy with my constant running, calling me ""The fastest pink power ranger they've ever seen."" 

So to sum it all up, went flawless, had a lot of laughs got my old hand cannon back and made 4 friends out of it.

So, I hit LL 312 this weekend. Not the highest I'm sure compared to others, but apparently on my friend's list I'm one of the highest. Now, I always set myself offline when I play because the people I do play games with will invite me anyway, and I hate getting invites from people that added me but I never added them. Today, I forgot to set myself offline after turning it on because of party chat issues. Here's what ensued because of that mistake.

Got a game/party invite from another player. I remembered the person's GT because I had helped them with the nightfall the previous week, but I never actually spoke to them. I join the party and mute my headset, mainly so they didn't hear me cough due to being sick and much to my surprise, both people in there were younglings. They wanted to do the normal raid, and I decided to stick around to help them out because they never did it before. As we go in orbit, I hear the younger one say ""So this is the girl you were floating with?"" I'm a guy, was playing on my female hunter. Ignored the comment and kept the mic muted.

So we search for more people, I tried LFG but for some reason .net was down. Finally, they get an invite from someone who's doing the raid and completed it. They join the other party and I get invited several seconds later. Imagine my luck when the other 3 people in the party were in fact younglings. So they start up the raid after I get in the game.

Here's where it gets interesting. 3 out of the 6 people didn't know how to do the entire raid. The person who was hosting (a youngling who was very....rude to say the least) ((he was the only one of these kids who had completed it) started them at Oryx. The group elects me to be the runner, and the host elects himself Floater. The group wipes 5 times before the kid who completed bothers to ask ""Have you guys ever done this?"" At this point, I got annoyed because he was explaining what to do in a terrible way, not mention the platforms or the order being counter clockwise. I unmute myself, explain the mechanics behind the first part, while surprising the original two younglings who thought I was a girl and let them run it a few times and wipe so they understand what to do.

Now I tried to explain to them that the 4th person doesn't need to step on their platform, they can jump to where the sisters are to help kill them. Every time I tell that person to go to the sisters platform the Floater screams at the top of his lungs to stay near his platforms. I stopped caring about it for the next couple runs and let it slide.

Now, as I was running to get the relics during the attempts, I noticed something odd. The floater was somehow dying before anyone else during most of our attempts. I didn't know how this was possible since the floaters supposed to be on one of the sisters' platforms. So I slowed down one of my runs a bit and noticed he was on the ground. Trying to kill the ogres, with a sword. Not even an exotic sword. Regular Legendary, not even 280 light sword.

After we wiped I told the floater he should jump on the sisters platforms. The kid stopped for a second, like he was stunned someone was giving him orders, and said ""I don't take orders from you B****! I completed the raid before."" The other 4 kids pointed out that not only was I 10 light levels above him, I had my HM emblem on. He continued to stay on the ground and kept dying right next to where an ogre died, preventing us from reviving him. With 4 people shooting at him (another kid would die some of the runs) and my ToM, the damage wasn't enough to stagger him and the floater raged quit.

The 4 remaining kids were annoyed that he was acting like that, and that they weren't gonna beat Oryx. The two original kids who invited had to leave but asked me if I could help them with the whole raid in an hour. I stupidly agreed. What I was invited to an hour later was an 8 man party with two Irish kids screaming at top of their lungs at whatever game they were playing with, and 3 other people they had found arguing with one another. I left the party, turned off my xbox and sat in my chair wondering what had just happened.

Let me just point out: I have no problem playing video games with kids. My job usually consists of either playing video games or board games with them. But one thing I've learned from my job is that some kids are intolerable.
