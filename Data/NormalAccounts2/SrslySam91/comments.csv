Your objective is to kill the enemy titan. Not players. Supports for example will not have a high KDA..nor should they. While i agree the matchmaking is fucked in its own way, it would be asinine to implement s FPS system to match a moba. 

You may have a great k/d in smite but have low player damage, low objective damage, etc and that doesnt tell the full story. Sorry but thats an arena players attitude toward things. ",2016-11-15 05:45:00+00:00,da0xnzf,1.0,t3_5d08db,10079.0,Smite

Your kit doesnt provide much help in a team fight other than your silence and execute on your ult..youre still very single target oriented.

Youve made your point about the pen not being needed. I havent played Than in a very long time nor do i play him often in ranked matches. Im just trying to explain that builds should change every game. Its a bit pointless for you to try and go strictly tank on him when its not going to provide much for your team. However an item like beatstick with its passive will be of more importance in a team fight. You lose 5% your health from activating an ability, right? At level 20 with the items youre talking about youre going to lose around 100-130 health most likely every time you activate it. Lets say you miss your heal..that extra health can come in handy, so you shouldnt use it willy nilly.

100,"I am Diamond 3, and i play regularly against Gmasters. Im also diamond Nem with 83% win rate. Yes the build works, and yes you have power. 210 power with 2.11 attack speed is by no means weak? Regardless of crit or not im still hitting hard. Also exe is fine pen when you consider nems passive and ult. 

I typically do build Asi over soul eater since the nerf to it, however with the crit build i find that the extra iAS and the ""oh shit"" heal from it come very effective. 

Why do you keep saying 2.11 attack speed is not enough? You can build bruiser on Nem and do perfectly fine..use of auto resets are key, and while 40% crit may be RNG youre not going to miss so many in a row that you fall behind in a box match..

Not sure why youre trying to BM me when your facts arent even all there. Towers? when im hitting for 100+ full build in my attack chain you definitely dont need more pen..and the attack speed helps more with the crit build vs more pen. 

Youre blowing smoke when you have no numbers to back your statements. The only thing i agree with is asi&gt;soul eater, however like i said the extra attack speed and 5% more flat life steal also the 20% heal you get *if* you dropped to where Asi would even proc in the first place is going to save you in a boxing match over Asi. And yes ive tested the numbers to prove it, go do it yourself if you so please.

You do realize im talking about Duel right? Not conquest? Id like to hope you can read the title, but clearly youre underestimating anyone who builds crit apparently. Even though ive directly given you examples of how it works on Nem better. 

Stop acting like the build wouldnt work when i played gmaster ullr/apollo back to back games and beat both using it (and diamond 2 freya) but alrighty.

Edit - in Duel you always go for objectives over kill potential. But what im saying to you is that when your kill potential is that potent you dont need extra pen for objectives when you already shred them. 

Youre playing artemis. How are you gonna counter build crit nem? With hide? Shield? Because those 2 items work in favor FOR nemesis. I want you to build them so that you dont have the option of not attacking me while my shield is up.",2016-09-02 04:01:59+00:00,d76d5lj,4.0,t1_d767py8,8841.0,Smite

Also the point is burst damage. Smite is a burst game (sort of unfortunate) and a well played Ullr can make more work with max cdr/pen vs ich/attack speed. He has way to many AR's that means hes hitting basically 6 shots in a short burst vs hitting 2 or 3 autos. Albeit this takes precision axe + 3/1/2 combo with the resets in between, but it can be done and is more efficient.

124,"First: ap/ab you get the jist. Just an obvi moba term that 99.9% of these folks will understand clearly and pointing it out is QF pointless in the discussion. 

2nd: wrong. Youve got 3 excellent and powerful AA resets that when combined together can burst a fuck ton of damage instantly. (3/reset followed by 1/reset followed by 2/reset) you get far less of that if you build straight AA rather than trans/max pen and cdr. IMO its more so a skill based thing, because building ability means that theres more risk when you miss. But its certainly not weaker outside of full build crit which gets counter built easily anyway with thorns. 

Third: i was most definitely talking about defense. I am rank 10 nem and i understand her kit quite well and how to play against. Typical Nem build will have flat pen in it and on max cdr her ult is up for nearly every engagement. In a strictly 1v1 scenario youre better off building that winged blade vs actual protections. If you didnt know she *takes quite a lot* of protections from her opposing team. 

You do realize that Ullr being a stance switcher hunter is the reason hes the exception here right? Obviously you wouldnt go ability based on Xbal or Rama. However Ullr is still most potent ability based early-late *if you land your abilities* so like i said theres a skill curve here to be understood.",2016-08-19 04:13:30+00:00,d6nn950,2.0,t1_d6nludt,2332.0,Smite

Im not saying duel is broken based on the fact i usually don't play Ss tier gods - if anything i think that the current meta of hunters and golden bow are broken just because it gives late game carries a huge lead early game meaning you cant do anything against them. Youll get out poked, out cleared, and the most important is that your objectives will fall much quicker due to them being carries. 

Youre trying to call me an inexperienced bad player due to the fact i think Susano is overpowered. You also assume that i have no idea how to counter build.

I guess we could discuss how strong Razor actually is, I'm not sure if I'd put him above the spiders or in the range of bisky. 

Razor comments on how ""scary"" and talented Killua is, and Killua's abilities are basically tenfold by the end of the series compared to that on greed island. Maybe ""much stronger"" was the wrong terms, but I do believe Killua surpassed him at that point. ",2016-02-05 04:23:43+00:00,czoh4oh,4.0,t1_czo1yjm,23987.0,HunterXHunter
297,"Hisoka was not fully prepared for Razor's throw though. It caught him off guard. The fact that he was able to react so quickly to it and put up any sort of defense shows how quick his reactions are. Also you see at the very end with razor's most powerful return (when he volley'd gon's jajanken throw before gon passed out) and Hisoka deflected it back to him. Because at that point Hisoka actually decided to put forth the effort because he deemed Razor a worthy opponent. 

That's the thing about Hisoka - I don't think we've seen him truly go all out. If we're judging strength by timeline of events, at the end Killua was much much stronger than let's say Razor. However Hisoka was debating whether he should kill Illumi or Killua and fight the other, meaning he thought at that point both would be worthy opponents. 


This is great man. I've been wanting to theory craft so bad about this show (buddy still hasn't finished it yet, he's scared to lose it he says haha so he doesn't want to binge it) and seems I can get some good discussions here in /r/hunterxhunter. My favorite part about this show (sorry for being a broken record) is that someone ""weaker"" than another person has no inclination that they will lose the fight. Technique and experience plays just as much a role as strength does, if not more. When it comes down to it - does anyone in the show enjoy fighting more than Hisoka? Hisoka felt comfortable enough during the PT arc that he said he would have to defend himself if the members attacked him, although he said it with a serious tone you still got the feeling that he knew he would be able to best any of them. That's why he had his eyes set on Chrollo, because he would be the best fight for him. 

Let me ask you this - is anyone in the show actually a better *fighter* than Hisoka? Take into consideration technique, abilities, experience, and just flat out intelligence. There is one thing that Hisoka loves in life, and that's to fight. Idk man, I think that there's a lot of closed doors still revolving him and I truly don't think we've seen his full potential yet. 

I wouldn't put him top 5 just because that's considering meruem/netero/royal guard are 5 people right there. I DO however put him in the category with maybe zeno/chrollo/silva.",2016-02-04 21:01:41+00:00,czo04ln,2.0,t1_czny8aw,2596.0,HunterXHunter
298,"Hmm. See, I really don't think that any of the RG would have a chance at beating Netero. When Meruem tried to ""kill"" Pitou (for speaking out of term) he mentions that ""you're strong. I was trying to kill you"" so I do believe that she is quite powerful, and you could even say that because of the fact she didn't die when she got hit and look at how Netero lost limbs when he took a hit could be an argument that she would be stronger than Netero. 

BUT, I do think that Pitou/RG has more ""defense"" than netero does. When you look at their abilities though, none of them would be able to beat Netero because they wouldn't be able to get close. I think maybe Pouf would because of his special ability, but I don't know if he could do enough damage (also Netero could probably track him since he has incredible speed anyway) and if you look at Pitou fighting him, there is no way she can counter his speed. In term of raw strength she may have him beat, but in term of Nen control/speed she doesn't come close (maybe an exaggeration but you get the point) which leaves Youpi, who doesn't have a real ""technique"" but is just raw power. He wouldn't have the means to be able to fight Netero.

I do want to mention this though - Hisoka is more-so balanced to fight ""technical"" Nen users rather than someone like Uvo or Gon who mainly just have incredible strength. Hisoka can beat you with his wits, and outsmart you. Also using his bungie gum really comes in handy in sticky situations (get it) but if it came down to it I do agree that he's not RG status, my big thing is just that we do not know for sure. 

I think it's kind of up for grabs still, depending on which way the series will go however. Will the RG/Meruem still be considered the upper tier compared to the next opponents that will be introduced? Or will opponents stronger than them exist? My thinking is that if they come out with some new antagonists who are considered stronger than that upper tier of ants, then we'll find out how powerful someone like Hisoka or Chrollo really is. I do think it will be interesting to say the least. 

Remember when Netero was saying that Morel and Knov were just as strong as he is? Obviously Netero was being facetious, but we honestly don't even know how strong people like Pariston are or those Zodiacs. I do remember hisoka doing his ""grades"" at the end for all the hunters, so that could give inclination that they're much weaker than the Chimera Ants..but we don't actually find out for sure. 

Also - in regards to illumi/hisoka, remember when Killua was having the heart to heart with Illumi and Hisoka was hiding in the shadows saying ""do I kill Illumi and fight Killua with his bloodlust? Or do I kill killua and fight Illumi at bloodlust.."" meaning that he still thought he was capable of winning, but both being a good fight nonetheless.

346,"Im amazed, honestly fucking amazed at how poor bungies test/design team are. How do you not think something like this through? I mean how do you not foresee this happening. Its just incredible to me that a company of this stature can be so bad at decision making.",2015-06-27 17:38:44+00:00,cskn7fc,1.0,t3_3bbklt,455.0,DestinyTheGame
347,"Oh man. I appreciate the reply - never even occurred to me that connection might play into the perk being activated when it shouldnt. Does make sense though, and we all know that pvp servers in this game arent much to brag about. 

Why a company such as bungie has a lack of dedicated servers is beyond me.",2015-06-27 17:36:52+00:00,cskn5fd,5.0,t1_cskg90r,15589.0,DestinyTheGame
348,Interesting. Id need to see actual evidence as that because i assumed it was that if you start firing simultaneously as you ADS it can proc. Ive never not had an excellent connection and i get it to proc a good amount of the time. ,2015-06-27 06:12:22+00:00,cska922,3.0,t1_csk4cc5,14333.0,DestinyTheGame
349,"The guns are hawkmoon-esque, however nothing can outclass the last word unless youre intent on opening up an exotic for your special/heavy. Tlw is still bugged where that extra precision damage procs even when ADS, and when it does you crit for 111 damage. I just find that the fire rate of tlw is unrivalled and honestly the perk procs quite often. 

In trials there isnt a reason to use up an exotic slot for your special. Id say a legendary primary is more suited for regular crucible.",2015-06-27 01:48:40+00:00,csk3mpy,1.0,t3_3b9dw5,1343.0,DestinyTheGame

351,It would be pointless when simply switching to one of the other guns would be faster than changing ele types. The only benefit is not having to level all 3. But thats not much an issue these days.,2015-06-24 05:08:42+00:00,csgrpeg,1.0,t3_3ax2fp,892.0,DestinyTheGame

358,"Because thats not the type of class they are? Titans are supposed to be clunky, slow yet very tanky compared to the other 2. Hunters are obviously tuned for agility, where warlocks are the in between mix. 

Now its another story as to why a helmet like the ram is for a warlock and not a titan, but seriously. Yeah i also wish my warlock could go invisible, i also wish that if im using blink on my warlock i could use sunsinger as well. Oh wait, thats right subclasses have at least a little diversity in this game and you want to further ruin something this game lacks?
