So its Cupid (me) and Khumba in duo together vs neith/terra. We had a poseidon mid vs izunami, Thor mirror for jungle, athena vs sobek in solo. Our athena was stomping sobek, our poseidon was getting stomped by izunami. 

As a Cupid/kumba duo our early clear was obviously not as good as neith/terra. Not to mention our mid laner didnt help me with back harpies so we got to lane late anyway.  

Terra dov dov at level 4 and picked up FB, not much i could really do there. Also terra would continuously aggro vs me instead of wave which made it hard for me to have any push or poke. So needless to say i was off to a rough start. Our poseidon surrendered once he got 0-3 (not sure how you lose lane to izunami as poseidon) and he afkd for a bit. 

So athena starts taunting me, even though i got focused every fight. Our jungler did not even poke his head into the left side of the map (literally didnt drop red, back harpies, etc) until after 12 minutes. Several opportunities were there to gank but instead he camped solo lane with athena. 

My thing is this: i understand i was 0-5 at one point. However i was not just mindlessly killing myself or putting myself in terrible positions. I had a mid laner who refused to rotate or call missing, a jungler who was literally MIA for the first 13 minutes, and a solo laner who BM'd even though she was 2v1 the whole time against an underleveled sobek. Meanwhile i was getting 3 man rotated constantly with no rotations from my mid, and not even a warning (was warded when i could, and wasnt out of position often). I literally got dove under tower for 3 kills, and the times i had a 1v1 with neith i got ganked because of no knowledge that others rotated..even tho *my* team didnt rotate. 

I ended up getting some efficient farm and then caught up to where neith fell off late game, and my carry started to pick up. 

Didnt mean to have a story time here but basically im trying to say that you shouldn't be toxic to people on the sole fact they arent having a positive scoring game. Me and khumba split pushing and picking up a triple kill is what secured the game, not to mention i was actually a factor in team fights once i got caught up so i was able to put in damage and push. When you have tunnelvision and only look at one aspect of the game without factoring in all the other issues, you seem ignorant. 

I wouldve loved to not fall behind early but thats what happens when they have 2 strong early game gods against us in lane. You failed to capitalize on them diving me repeatedly (could have gotten EASY ganks) because you were to busy camping solo lane. Dont blame me for dying when you could have been better teammates to prevent it. Taunting someone and not stopping to think you couldve done something to help is what seperates the pub stars from players who actually understand the team concept of the game. 

That was much much longer than expected. ",Smite,Think about everything that factors into a game before you BM someone who may not have a good K/d in your game.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/5a4n8m/think_about_everything_that_factors_into_a_game/

I want to get back into ranked Conq, although im weary of solo queuing still. 

Anyways - ive been jungling my last few games and so far ive been playing Awilix. I feel shes a good starter and im going to work my way into some Nemesis (i have her rank X) and try her soon. My issue for now is that with casual Q i almost always go wrath for my starter on Awilix. This is due to me being nervous of having newer teammates that won't be able to clear properly so it helps secure some jungle buffs, but also early gold furys.

I watch a lot of streamers/tubers such as Weak3n so im quite familiar with the current meta and rotations. However in casual queue i usually get stuck after my initial solo wave clear + elemental creeps. Typically you go to mids after that but my mid laner usually never rotates. Now lets say they do actually rotate, this is when i go straight for back camps yeah? (after wave if one is pushed up) but after that i usually get a little lost. 

Typically after mids/backs hopefully i have enough for boots then when i return i get the other back camps and my speed then blue buff and elementals. Then i start looking for ganks. Is there any spots specifically i should be rotating to? Or just being aware of whats available on the map?

Imo the quests are very stale..and boring. Theres no incentive for getting your 50 kills and/or assists done in 2 games vs 5 games. I understand you want to be fair, but you should also try to give more incentive to those who do put in the time to get better and play better.

The wave clear is awesome - and shes a ton of fun to play with Fatalis and just kite everything. But i have some issues with her. 

She does no damage. Literally. Players are not going to be standstill while you auto so the chance of you actually landing both hits of the auto attack are slim to none. This means she does *half* the damage as other hunters. In hindsight she can potentially do way more if you go crit/qins because you get 2x autos everyone you use just one, but like i said youre certain to never hit both of them on the same god. For now ive been building boots/devos/wind demon/d bringer/titans/fatalis. 

My next issue is that she has no survivability. In order to do *any* damage you must go full glass cannon, and she has literally no escapes because her ""stealth"" takes longer than xings ult to activate (little bit of an exaggeration) so theres really not much you can do there. 

Her ult is kind of dumb. The radius is *so* fucking small that its extremely hard to predict when using it and you miss half the time. The radius needs to be bigger to more so scyllas 2 or nox's. 

Lastly - ive kind of went over this but i love the ""boomerang"" attack chain she has. However this is a double edged sword because youre not likely to consistently get both of them to hit. Trying to kite and predict their movements leaves you wide open and you get dumpstered by any mobile god. 

I would love to see a few changes from her: i think her 1 makes it so that they stop coming back to her when she autos but im uncertain if this gives her the regular damage rather than the 50% damage from her normal chain. My idea would be that instead of splitting it off and not returning to her make it so that it does return to her but for a few seconds if you land the first hit then the 2nd fall back hit is guaranteed to hit the same god. 

Also, her 3 needs to be faster. Plain and simple. Many have said it, it needs to be a thing.

Honestly episode 212 i think when Gin fights Jirocho..that shit hit me hard man. You build up such a relationship towards these characters (and there's so many diverse and unique ones) and you never see to much of their actual, true ""faces"" so to say so it makes the build up for moments like this one so intense. I mean i was hollerin at the TV it was so epic. Like that fight was on the Hunter x Hunter level of epicness of fights and they just blend in the comedy so damn well with just the right amount of badass to make it fit for a broad audience. 

While theres so much trolling go on, every character is funny in their own way. I legitimately enjoyed *almost* every single character, and ones i didnt were the ones deliberately made to be annoying so that you dont like them.

Its extremely unlikely that you will outplay them hard enough to be behind a full 3-tier item (or even 2 for that matter) and catch back up. You MUST go for a counter build of sorts if you have any hope of prolonging the game. I just played an erlang mirror where i got up 3 kills/3 lvls/2.5k gold. The guy was still copying my build.

In those situations you certainly want to build a different route. Some gods do have ""set"" builds on them, but trust me. You can always catch someone off guard with an interesting item that they may not expect and that will at least give you a better chance. But when you follow the same build youre just keeping yourself at a further disadvantage. Why would you attempt to out box me when youre 2 items behind and youve got the same items as me?

Alright. Rant over. Im aware its being changed next patch so thats good. But im scared theyre gonna revert it back to how it was before hand. Thus why i question the play testing team for hi rez. What exactly in the fuck do they test lmao if purp pot hits live server like how it was and if these dumb spawn timers hit live -_- 

Tl;dr - you die once in duel after 10 mins even if youre dominating the game then you lose the match, gg.

Such a cool playstyle on him that allows you to be super aggressive. So far ive played freya/hades/ullr. Freya gave me the most trouble because i couldnt push objectives fast enough and gave her a kill (even though it was 8-2 me, late game freya is no bueno) but otherwise..hes just good. Can backdoor titan easily with ult and Asi (not encouraging you to scumdoor anyone). 

My question to you all: what to build? Ive tried so many that work well on him that it kills my OCD. I like to have a go to build besides the counter building for certain matchups. The main thing is idk if i build trans or not. I built it against ullr and that was my best match. The core of the build stays similar though, i went trans/ichaval/boots/asi/exe/qins but didnt get chance to sell ichy. I actually dont like defense on this god. Hes a warrior which gives him higher base protections, and ill only build defense vs a mage for sustain. But i do love throwing in a frostbound for either mage/adc matchup. 

Although i also have a good crit build that dominates too, although its a bit more glass cannon. Boots/asi/exe/wind demon/deathbringer and then def item if you want it or health item. This is a one shot build basically but i dont think it holds up as well in something like duel.

However the better scenario would be to change the passive to abilities. 

Im not sure how tricky it would be for some hunters who have mainly steroids and not many contact abilities, but in that case frostbound the way it is, is really strong.

But anyways back to the point at hand. Why does everyone underlook the fact Hisoka caught a ball that was rallied back by Razor? This means that the ball was traveling faster and with more power than when Gon hit it..since Razor ""ralleyed"" it back it means he had more momentum on it and indeed added more power. The fact that Hisoka caught this with nothing but his Aura is quite impressive if you ask me. Think about it - razor was at full power by that point because he recalled his nen beasts.

They did it with stone cutting so clearly its an option. 

But mages are absolute trash now (again were talking about Duel specifically before you get tilt) and have been since the start of S3. 

For people like myself who either dont always have the time for conquest, or dont know enough people to be able to queue up with (solo queuing Conq is cancer) Duel used to be an enjoyable way to test your skills and builds. Now it consists of people being able to skip bans and play any of the same top S-tier gods with the same builds doin the same shit. There is *zero* skill involved in Duel anymore and the fact you get items like soul eater that make it impossible to get your initial 100-0 burst from a mage because they heal right back up and continue to out sustain. 

Sure you can still win as a mage, but then again you *can* win while playing Sylvannus if you find someone shitty enough. But when i have to sit here with a 10+ min queue every single game only to play the exact same gods just has me wondering..why am i playing? Honestly i personally took a break for dark souls and some other games but like i said i enjoy being able to hop on without to much commitment and jump into a match. 

But im having issues now where i just cant stay calm playing this game. The amount of BMing shitters that sit under tower and never fight me until everything is 500% in their favor and sit fountain the whole time if i do get push then it gets pretty frustrating.

I made a post a while ago regarding why people put Kil and Gon in the same tier list when Killua is far superior to Gon. I think Gon for example may have closed the gap a bit, but remember Killua waited to train/fight when Gon got hurt or couldnt use Nen. Even so, Killua counters Gon in every aspect except for aura capacity due to Gon being an enhancer..but its not like he would ever land a jajanken on Kil anyway. 

Back on topic - do you think if the series continues and theres a huge time skip or something, 1) will Killua be intent on training hard still? Since Kil doesnt have much motivation to be ""stronger"" necessarily im not sure if he would be putting in to much effort. 2) Kil doesnt want to be an assassin anymore, so would this lessen the potential Zeno was talking about? Or would it greaten it? Obviously the training for assassins is different than the average Hunter. 

Honestly i would be fine with the series shifting down the line to give Kil a little more of the spotlight rather than Gon as the MC (although with the current arc its hard to see Gon even being apart of it) because if you think about it..killua may be the strongest 12 year old ever in the HxH world. Think about the gap between him and Gon at the beginning, and everyone praised Gon for how good he was. They couldnt open the testing gate whereas Killua opened the (3rd?) gate which IIRC was 16 tons or something. Physically Killua was at least 10x stronger than Gon. The thing he lacked was motivation and willpower due to the needle. 

So do you guys think Kil will live up to Zenos hype? We don't even know the full extent of Zenos power himself, but hes obviously insanely strong with a huge aura cap (300m En for example) and if he thinks Killua has the most potential in the family then he clearly thinks he would surpass even Maha sometime down the road. The question is how many years would that take, and would it even happen now. 

Personally i think Killua may not want to fight as much or worry about getting stronger now. So he may get a bit weaker. BUT in my ideal world of what id like to see then i think this is how things could go down:

Illumi hits up Hisoka and asks to help him capture Alluka. He offers either A) help tracking the troupe or B) offer to heal him with Nanika. In the mix of things Alluka dies either from Illumi, or Hisoka.

To me this would be one of the most interesting cross-universe fights between hxh/dbz, but i cant ever make enough points for any hxh character to top a dbz uni character. If were comparing gons 24k aura capacity (number may be a little off, rusty memory) to that of say..goku in DB with around 135 power level, i dont think its even close as far as which power scales higher. Goku at the point of the tournaments was considerably stronger than Gon at that point. 

So lets say Roshi is sitting around 150 PL and Neteros aura capacity would be at least 350k+ (if youpi was at 440k+ its reasonable to assume netero would at least be somewhat close to that) it may be a closer fight. 

Now the facts - 1) strength: Roshi blew up the moon with his Ki. I don't think even with a prime Neteros Zero Hand that he would be a planet buster. So strength obviously goes to Roshi.

2) speed - neteros 100-type is faster than the speed of sound (correct me if im wrong) but i do believe (if im not mistaken) Roshi *himself* can move at the speed of sound. Im not fully 100% on this, but Roshi can use mirror image and some other techniques as well. But for purposes of this matchup we will give speed to Netero (although roshi is faster than netero himself, i think neteros 100-type would be unavoidable)

3) experience - has to go to Roshi. Much older than Netero, been in more battles and survived. Goes to roshi.

4) willpower - probably again has to go to Roshi here. Although a clumsy, jokingly character, when he gets serious then he means business. 

5) intellect - trying not to be biased, but referring to #4 roshi outclasses netero here by far IMO. Hes obviously a master of martial arts, and due to his very old age hes soaked in a lot of knowledge. Albeit he was way weaker in dbz comparing to the others he still had a good grasp of comparing power levels of everyone. 

Winner? Turtle Hermit, Master Roshi. For posting purposes i tried to balance it out a bit by giving Netero a speed advantage, but im just not sure that any HxH character is on par with any late DB/Early dbz characters. Maybe post rose Meruem would be comparable to a King Piccolo of sort, but that may be a stretch as well seeing how K.P was a planet buster at that point. 

Still 2 of my favorite characters from both shows. I gotta soft spot for the oldie badasses. Also the non chalant, carefree attitudes make them likeable. But they always have the switch they can flip when they need to be serious and the 2 of them are extremely smart. 

Do you guys think Netero would stand a chance with his speed? Would it even matter? I dont think he would hurt Roshi with any of the attacks..but he may be able to catch him off guard.

Im a bit iffy on my answer but i do believe it wouldnt kill him (killua).

My question to hi rez is this; if youre going to give a god speed and retarded mobility then their power should not be off the fucking roof. Especially early game. I mean Jesus christ himself woulda got dicked down at level 3.

I play on xbox, so duel is about 98% unplayable atm. You only have 6 bans. And susano/chronos/kali/hou yi are the absolute 4 bans, with gods like baka/nemesis/loki/amc/apollo/anhur taking up the other spaces. 

Notice anything? *one* mage there. Not even he bo or freya gets a ban anymore. Why? Because mages are terrible in this meta. You have zero tower push whatsoever. Hunters can get decent poke on a tower after a kill even in the early game 3 sec spawners. For a mage even at end game youre going to need at least a full wave and 15 sec timer. 

Balancing the game around Duel would be cancer as fuck, so we shouldnt do that. But it would be enjoyable if they could balance it separately.

In all my time with dota/smite and other mobas i can say that nothing is more frustrating than duel in smite. I know everyone is tired of hearing the same rant over and over but it truly is the most broken game type in smite. 

Hunters are just to good. I mean you cant even initiate against a frostalis hunter as a melee without being half health or dead by the time you get to them. Theres no room for good matches anymore because every game turns into a snowball or a snooze fest. The addition of bull demon is excellent for joust, but utterly broken and stupid for duel. It can either severely help a snowball or it can cost you the game if youre dealing with a turtler who just comes to invade. Yes wards help, yes its always situational..but i just cant believe that 99.9% of the pop play the same handful of gods, and you only get 6 bans. If you don't ban any of the top 6 then expect a mirror match (the worst duel) and so forth. 

The best thing is for me not to play it but i actually like the idea of being able to play a game type without worrying if my team is going to be garbage and not rotate lanes correctly, or if my jungler is fuck all. 

Im not the only one right? Besides giving up on duel is there any way you all prepare for these matches to not get so frustrated? I suppose i could take it less seriously (its a game) but i always want to try and win. But i find that if i lose, majority of the time is from my own frustration and anger vs the opponent actually out playing me. 

Grandmaster would be cool to get - but idk if i can play cookie cutters to get there. If you csnt beat them, join them is the common theme..but i find hunters disgusting in duel because of how little skill they take and that means its 0 fun.

First off, I love Hisoka. Such a unique character and they did an amazing job illustrating him. One of the things I most enjoy about HxH is that the winner of a fight is not as clear cut as say dragonball, or any other shounens. Usually when you meet one of the antagonists early on in the show like they did with Hisoka, that usually means that they're in the lesser-tier of opponents later on in the show (if they make it that far). 

I've seen a lot of threads around the internet saying that Hisoka wouldn't even beat most of the Spider members, yet alone Chrollo. However personally I think that Hisoka is really good at judging others' ability/potential (i.e; Gon/Killua) and if he thought that let's say Feitan or somebody would be a worthy fight then he would have tried fighting one of them. So that leads me to believe that in his mind he thinks they would not be worth the time. 

Out of everyone in the show, you can do a pretty good guess on just how powerful they are. When Netero interviews Hisoka during the exam, he ask's him ""who would you least want to fight"" and after Hisoka answered he also said ""although right now the person I want to fight the most is you."" Early on I didn't even catch this until I re-watched the anime. I like how HxH writes the characters because if you think about something like DBZ, if you're weaker than your opponent then there's really no way for you to beat them. However in HxH, wits and intellect play such a huge role.  Like when they're fighting Youpi and Killua is going off on him he says ""they all have less than 10% of my raw power yet they're putting up a fight"" so just because you're weaker, you still have a chance to win the fight. 

What I want to know though is what tier would you put Hisoka into? I honestly think that the author could go many directions with his character. We really have no idea just *how* strong he is, because like you saw in the heavens arena arc Hisoka deliberately let his arms get taken off just to make it a better fight. Also I feel that Hisoka will purposely fight with less strength and not go all out because he'd rather just have a good fight. 

He's obviously not in the meruem/netero tier, but could it be possible he'd be in the royal guard tier? Personally I think that he falls between maybe the ging/chrollo - royal guards. You don't really find out how strong Illumi is either, (although I think hisoka is stronger than illumi, because in the anime Illumi was afraid of Hisoka being mad at him) so I really hope that when new material comes out that Hisoka will be around still.

Quick list of what I consider the ""tiers"" in HxH- 

Meruem/Netero
Royal Guard
Ging/Chrollo
Phantom Troupe/Bisky/Morel/Knuckle/Shoot
Killua/Gon

Apparently theyre pretty good players who stream regularly, and they started doing something where they will carry a 3rd through flawless. We had our team of 3 plus another friend in our party and he was watching one of their livestreams as we played them. 

Before i get into this - had they used a 3rd who was of similar skill to the 2 players doing the carrying, i dont believe we would have won. I think we *could* have won, but i highly doubt it. One of the players was top 5 DTR, and both of them moved extremely well in the game. They had little to no stagger time and moved quite fluid, i applaud you for that. 

But with my praise out the way let me also state this - you play with a mouse and keyboard. That is absolutely not fair, and it absolutely makes me feel different about you know and the fact you were shit talking through the match. As a veteran CS player who scrimmed with professionals back in 1.6, you can not tell me that its a level playing field using a mouse vs controller. If i could use a mouse on this game trials would not even be enjoyable. You simply can not match the accuracy of mice and keyboard play vs console controllers, any true PC player knows this completely. 

So the fun part. Map was cauldron (drag) and 2 of us sniped while 1 used a shotty. Me and my teammate were using spears. Mine has FR/APR, his FR/field scout. 

I do not appreciate hearing highly skilled players/streamers lie about who they play and their tactics. We never FR'd them at all. Hell, we *never* dump ammo deliberately in any match even if the opposing team is. 

I got one body snipe on them and it was my last bullet in the gun. That was the ONLY shot that wasnt a critical with my sniper. Immediately they bitched and moaned about how we were FR'ing (my friend never even shot a FR bullet) when we absolutely were not. 

I think its pathetic that 2 players that highly ranked and skilled would sit there and try to find a ""cheapness"" in their loss. you could have said good game, but instead you choose to lie and make excuses? Also, the *only* reason you got t bagged at the end was because of the way you ran your mouth and accused me/my team. 

I already acknowledged i dont think we would of won if they had a true 3rd of similar skill, but honestly someone who uses a fucking mouse and keyboard vs controllers should never, EVER talk about being at a fucking disadvantage. 

truly you made my day, firstly because i was excited to play some skilled players and secondly because we beat you AND caused you to be extremely salty about it. 

For a console/controller player they were highly skilled from me watching a bit of them play. However when i found out you use a mouse and keyboard, your skills became nothing more than average in my eyes. You truly have no clue the advantage you hold and you dare complain yet alone lie and make excuses about someone else and the gun their using? 

Pathetic. I thought id see some class but apparently not. I wish that one of us streamed from our POV.

Ive been to the lighthouse a dozen times and its not the items anymore that make me want to play (for the most part everything was obtained pretty quick, and everything now is just repeats) but i enjoy playing good competitive maps and teams. 

My original team for trials we steamrolled the first few weeks. Weve yet to not go flawless when playing together as each of us have a pretty good handle on things. Ill switch up teams sometimes and have ran flawless with randoms even. 

But with that said..the map this week just irritates me. The way bungie is setting these maps up in rotation is just silly. Almost every map promotes cheap and cheesy gunplay, and all but one map have been 1 sided spawns. 

Typically i wont complain about the overuse of thorns or felwinters, spears etc because i have those items myself and i can switch out regarding the team im playing. This isnt a problem with my normal group, even on a cheesy map simply because we believe that our team will be superior even if they resort to final rounding every round (because 2 can play that game) but my distaste resides mostly when i play with a group thats not my regular. 

When people start emptying their spears to final round, or blink/shottying you each match it can be very frustrating for a group thats not accustomed to facing those types of players. I got no problem with someone using the best item available, and its in the game so i cant blame them for using what they want. In the end its their choice and they shouldnt have to handicap themselves because we deem their play as cheap or cheesy (head glitching final rounders for example).

What it always comes back to though is the absolute poor taste of maps bungie has chosen. Youve put maps in the rotation that support this type of play, and at times its almost unbearable going up against a couple sunsinger locks who just spam you with firebolts and thorns/shotties. 

And this doesnt even bring up the fact at how disgusting the constant delays and lag are, due to non existant dedicated servers meaning im probably playing off a host in Australia. Look theres nothing you can do about how cheap some of these weapons are (trust me, i have them too so i know first hand) but you can do something to help the lag, and the completely 1 sided 1 dimensional maps that promote such cheesy gunplay. 

Destiny pvp to me has always been a hit or miss. It can be fun, but it can be just horrid at times also. There are so many 1 shot mechanics that revolve around pvp that for anyone to determine an actual ""skill"" level is just impossible. Trials was supposed to be a test of skill, and teamwork. Instead it feels more like a test of ""who can get to this spot first"" or ""who can thorn the guy on the other side of the map first"" and then you add in the supers and etc and even heavy, it just turns into a non competitive cheese fest and you play the ""who is more patient"" game. 

Just some cluttered thoughts i decided to throw into this post. To sum it all up i am mostly just disappointed with the map selection so far in trials. Maps like blind watch, or even firebase delphi would be so much more enjoyable (talking about trials specificially, not control or anything) because there is a multitude of ways you can play them. For trials there wouldnt be a true 1 sided spawn on either of them, and you could choose to play aggressive or passive and each could play out either way. 

Anyway enough rambling. Map selection has really made trials turn sour for me. People will always use the same guns so dont misread my words, what i want to see are maps that can actually counter that play by using the environment for several different playstyles. The map this week is just bad man.
