Well again, I used to do this too when I had migraines every day.  I was young and in my 20's and I wanted a life.  Migraines didn't stop me because, again, I was used to the pain then.   

Having said that I DO know a lot of people say they have a migraine when they just have a headache, which does make it harder for the rest of us who do, but I usually wont discount anyone who says they have one, because what if they really do like I used to, and someone is rolling their eyes at them.

I remember being 26 and sitting in the office with my eyes watering from the pain, but getting on with things because jobs don't care if you get migraines every single day, they don't pay you to curl up in bed.  

I don't get them nearly as often anymore because of lifestyle changes and medication, so when I do get them they are much harder to deal with than they used to be.  My pain tolerance for them has gone down. ",2016-11-07 19:50:20+00:00,d9pzjun,3.0,t1_d9pzdig,209.0,breakingmom

113,"I hear you.   I live in a 150 year old duplex... I didn't even know that duplexes this old existed.  I thought it was newer concept... nope.  House was originally built without indoor plumbing for the mill workers in this old mill town.   They eventually closed off a quarter of the kitchen and half is the bathroom and the other half is a pantry of sorts with a sink and a few cabinets.   The rest is one big giant room with an 8 foot counter on one side with a few cupboards underneath and that is the extent of my storage space. 

It has yellow linoleum floors in the ugliest pattern imaginable.  I have to prepare all the food on the kitchen table because there is no counter space anywhere near the stove.  Speaking of the stove, the exhaust fan has a pull string and is basically just a hole in the house with a fan... a relic from the 50's.

We have ONE outlet in each room of the house with the exception of the living room which as two.  I get it, old house, one lamp per room back in the day, but in this day and age of electronics galore we have several fire hazard electrical strip situations going on in each and every room. 

Our windows are also old as the house, old pulley windows with half of the ropes snapped so we are holding some of them up with pieces of wood. BUT my landlord is replacing the windows because my kids have recently tested high for lead, because a 150 year old house has to have lead paint somewhere... its the windows.

121,"Well in the US bill collectors can only doc your paycheck if they receive a judgement against you in court. 

The way to avoid this is to call the collector, try to set up a payment plan.  Tell them what you can afford a month, that may only be $25 a month.  If they refuse that, they will probably proceed with a court case, at that point it has at the very least shown that you TRIED to do something about the debt, so make sure you have record of that.   Once it gets to court, depending on the judge, they may just grant the payment plan you can afford.   

Make sure when you are filling out your financial affidavit for court that you are filling in everything down to how much you spend on toilet paper and tampons.  When my husband went to court for a bill they agreed to the payment plan of $50 a month because his expenses for regular things, bills food etc exceeded his income, they granted the $50 payment plan after the bill collector refused it. 

If you let it go to court and don't show up or they find against you and order a garnishment they can go up to 25% unless your state has other protections.

I wouldn't throw all your cloth diaper dreams on one cloth diaper style.   Like Bumgenius didn't work for my kids because they were shaped all wrong for their body and those puppies were NOT cheap.   So this is an example of what I had and what worked for me. 

For the tiny infant stage, Charlie banana worked pretty good because they were slim and fit the tiny body, but prefolds and covers worked best at containing EBF runny poop.  After 3 months I exclusively used Happy Flutes because of soft inside material and their ability to be adjusted to fit either kid, which I got for a bargain right from china on aliexpress as well as some charcoal bamboo inserts also super cheap on that site.  Their all in ones are what I used for the first 2 months on the youngest until I decided to just give it up completely.    I had 11 bumgenious diapers that I spent a good $175 on and never used. 

If I had just the one kid in diapers I would have been doing it the whole time, I never thought it was hard or inconvenient.  But when the youngest was born the middle child was just 13 months and it all was just too much with two under two and cloth diapers. 

Most people who cloth diaper suggest getting just a few diapers in different styles to see what works best before sticking with a brand.

If something falls in nap time I always leave the house an hour early and we take a little drive while the kids nap.

I guess it has to be colored and have some kind of taste to it because that amount of juice and water tastes nasty together.. but they like it.   I also want to make sure that no matter the food offered I have something that my kid will actually eat.  Only thing worse than a tired kid is a tired hungry kid. 

Never stay for the whole party, parties that are not family parties are 2 hour max.   We come, we play a bit, we eat a bit and we leave. Depending on the age you will have to chase your kid for the entire party and who wants to do that shit for 4 hours.  Leave after the cake, but before the gifts.

242,"OK so here is my take on things like this. 

I have three children. When I had my oldest 10 years ago searching for stuff about kids on the internet just didn't occur to me.  I never checked milestone charts or worried when he was extra fussy, I didn't even know the phrase ""sleep regression"" until I had my second 2 years ago. 

When I take my kids to the pediatrician they ask me developmental questions.  Like ""does he like to crumple paper"" and ""Does he wave goodbye"" and if I say yes to the questions I don't worry.  

All kids develop differently.  My oldest walked at exactly 12 months.  My second, not until he was 15 months and my youngest now almost 14 months does not walk, he ONLY says Daah-Deee! and nothing else at all.    I am not worried because I know he will walk and talk eventually.  

I answered ""no"" to one of the pediatricians questions once, and she said ""Well honestly... he doesn't seem delayed, and I think we should wait until the next appointment to see how is before we think about any intervention""  He started doing whatever it was she asked like 2 weeks later. 

Milestone markers are ""average"" not concrete.   Everything is fluid and until your pediatrician worries, I wouldn't.  I hear so many people say that their kids walked at 9 months or 10 or 11, some not until 18 months... all kids are different and there is a huge range in learning abilities.  

I think one of the reasons its easy for me not to compare my kids to other kids is because I have three.  Each one did things at a different pace.  Kid 1 walked early, but kid 2 talked early and the last one is taking his sweet time to do anything at all. ",2016-10-05 16:01:30+00:00,d8f5b45,1.0,t3_5604ot,747.0,breakingmom

292,"We have a thing in my family called ""The bad chair"" its seriously just a time out.   The chair sits in whatever room and he acts up, he sits in the chair.  People don't like to use the word ""bad"" when diciplining kids, so you could call it something else... but we use it, whatever. 

I find that time outs work if there is a specific place for them to sit, rather than just a spot on the floor or whatever.  There has to be something tangible there that they don't like.   My kids is a bench.  It took only about 2 weeks before we could just say ""Go sit on your bench!"" and he would go without us having to carry him there.   He cries, but he can not get up until someone comes to get him and I always sit on the floor in front of him and we have a little talk about why his is there.   So the rule for time, is that if he is sitting there quietly we will come to get him in 2 minutes and talk.  If he is crying or screaming like a crazy person, he has to sit there until he stops crying and calms down, and then we come and get him and have our chat. 

Oh and if we are visiting relatives we pick out a chair when we get there, and if he acts up its ""Nanny has her own bad chair, if you are going to hit people she will let you use it""

So this happened to my 10 year old at 8 too.  Doctor said he was overweight and he definitely had a belly. 

Anyway, healthy options.  I would pack a healthy lunch and not have him buy school lunch.  My son was eating high calorie school pizza and mac and cheese.   This change should also go for the 6 year old it wont hurt for him to eat healthy too.  You can actually find a LOT of good ideas on the internet for great school lunches that kids will actually eat.   Eating healthy dinners, and paying attention to serving size, would be a good change too and that will benefit the whole family.  

I wouldn't require him to use the elliptical or treadmill at home, that would be singling him out, though if he wants to jump on good for him!  Instead start an exercise regime for the whole family.  We started with after dinner walks. 

I do require my kid to take one extra curricular activity, either at school or private, because he does not go outside after school.  So he was taking tai kwon do, and they do a lot of warm up cardio stuff.  The pounds dropped off of him when he started that and it was something he enjoyed and he had no idea that it was physical fitness, just that breaking wood with your feet is super fun!

We did after dinner treats every day for years, but one day we just stopped it and the kid didn't even notice. He asked and I had to be like.. you don't need a treat everyday!

386,"It definitely felt like a fairy tale at the time and looking back it still looks that way.  It was a pretty awesome time for us, even with the going through the divorce part. 

I met my ex when I was 20 and he was 26, N was 22 at the time, and we all met at the same time because me and my ex started working at this big company together on the same day and N already worked there, we were together for 6 years total, married for 3 of those years.   N and I got together officially when I was 26 and he was 28.

My ex and I were just not compatible.  I mean, we had enough good times to make it seem like we should be together, but we had nothing in common at all.  He didn't really like me as a person but he liked that I did everything for him and all he had to do was go to work and come home.   

Somewhere along the line he forgot that we decided to get a divorce BEFORE I started talking to N again.  Somewhere in his mind he remembers it as me cheating on him, when that never happened.  He also believes or has convinced others to believe that I am an evil narcissist and he was in an emotionally abusive relationship.  He even went so far as to email N and tell him that he was making a big mistake and I don't have the ability to care about other people, just myself.  N's response to that was ""He didn't know you AT ALL did he?""  No, apparently he did not. 

He was also an alcoholic that refused to admit that he was.  He would drink a case of beer after work everyday, and he thought that because he didn't drink during the day or at work then he didn't qualify and his drinking habits were fine.

Current husband was the guestbook attendant at my first wedding.  We had a polaroid guest book so he took the pictures while people signed their names next to them.  It was a cool idea. 

So he, my husband (N) and my exhusband (J) sat in neighboring cubicles at the office we ALL worked at, so we all knew each other from work.   They became friends and then N started hanging out with me and J, N would come over our house after work and we would all smoke insane amounts of weed and hang out watching stupid TV and eating lots of food that I would cook. 

So I got laid off from my job, N had stopped working there months before, J kept working there.  N was working part time and I was collecting some sweet Massachusetts unemployment, which was full pay, for a whole year as this was back in 2003-04 when everyone and their brother was unemployed.  So N and I would spend every afternoon together.  We became best friends and I did fall in love with him, but I was also in love with J.  So J and I got married and N jumped the first flight to Vancouver a week later. 

My marriage was pretty awful, we were married for 3 years, had a baby and in that time I never really talked to N, we were awkward and afraid.  And then one day after J and I had decided to get a divorce I was sitting up late and I got a message on AIM that said ""You're up late?"" From N.

Call your insurance company or do a provider search on their website.

Open your own bank account now if you dont already have one and have all your income deposited in that account.  Take out of any joint account what you can get away with.  If you cant take any of it out without him freaking out, get copies of bank statements each month to keep track of joint spending, and HIS spending of your joint money.  Record the balance of any savings accounts.  When you are served FYI bank accounts are first come first serve.  If he takes it all out you are SOL.  You may be able to get some back through the courts but you may not. 

Start researching attorneys in your area or if you have an employee assistance line at work, call them up and see if they can help you find a lawyer... that is how I found my amazing lawyer who worked on a low payment plan for low income people.  Meet with one for a free consultation to discuss divorce and custody stuff that is available in your state. 

Find a therapist, again if that assistance line exists you can use it for this too.  Do this.. seriously do this. 

Start trying to figure out how much it will cost you to live alone and also see if your state has a child support calculator available online so you can get an idea of how much he will have to pay you.  

And seriously... one step at a time.  Baby steps if you must.  One phone call a day, one google search for information.  Don't overwhelm yourself. 

Document everything he does from now on, from saying mean shit, to that big purchase you think he might make.

404,"When I was married to my ex husband we decided to get a divorce when I was 7 months pregnant.  I was, at that point, a stay at home mom even before I gave birth.   So because my ex and I decided that I would stay home with the baby for a year, we lived together, in a tiny 2 bedroom for a year and half.  Not speaking, not sleeping in the same room... nothing.  I stayed home for the year, and then I went to work.  It took me about 6 months to get up enough money to finally leave.  

I am not going to say that year was easy.  It wasn't.  We still went to family functions together and I still made dinner for him, we basically did everything we did before the divorce was decided, except speak. 

So he would go to work at 10am and he didn't come home until about 7:30, so I had already made dinner and fed the baby, baby was always in bed by then and I would just go into the bedroom and close the door.  He would sit on his computer for the rest of the night and sleep on the couch. 

I had support, not particularly support from my family because they were pissed that I was getting divorced, but I had a few really good internet friends (I did not have any real life friends at the time) who helped me hold my head up an get it done.   I mean, don't get me wrong, there was definitely a period of mourning at the beginning.  Where I sat around in my pj's all day and ate a ton of food and just basically was miserable.  But I could only do that for so long.  Eventually I just started saving money.. mentally preparing, finding out about apartments in my area, figuring out what I would do for childcare, finding legal help I could afford. I started taking the baby to my moms on the weekends and going out to lunch with just me and baby.  Taking time for myself.  

You can do this.  If you really want to leave you will come out of the funk and you will take charge of you and your baby's life.

Every single bill that I pay is listed and when it is to be deducted, either with the first or second paycheck per month.  

As far as amounts, thats going to obviously be different for what your family needs and what your bills are.  So, I live in an area that has a super affordable grocery store, thank god for Market Basket because Stop and Shop and Shaws and even Walmart are too expensive.   So I feed a family of 5 at $200 biweekly or $400 a month, I shop biweekly because I spend less this way.  You need to see what you spend on groceries now an decide if that is what you want and/or need to spend in the future.  

I also budget in for things that I need monthly, like toilet paper, paper towels, diapers, cat food/litter.  Stuff I don't buy at the grocery store because I can get them cheaper on a trip to Target, but they are things we definitely need.  

Gas, We budget in $30 a week for gas, super low right?  That is because we only have one car, my husband works from home 2 days a week and only works 20 minutes away.  This depend on how much you travel, how far your husbands commute is, how many cars you have etc. 

For all the kinds of bill listed above you should be able to go back into your banking history and get a good idea on what you spend on average a week or month for these items. 

Then there are the other bills.

Rent

Car loan

Car insurance

Cable/internet

Cell phones

Credit cards etc.

These kinds of bill are usually the same every month so very predictable.   Easy line items in the ""money out"" section of your budget. 

So as far as other expenses.  I budget in $75 a week in MISC items.  But that does not mean that is the amount we spend.  These items include ordering out pizza, any activities or field trips that I have to pay for for school, anything like.. oh I want to make this for dinner but I am missing x ingredient.   Date nights for me and my husband.  This seems like it would all cost more than $75 a week, but we will usually spend less than that so the overage adds up and we can do bigger things. 

You should base your starting budget on what you spend now, and then if that goes over what you are bringing in you need to find places to cut.

My husband, to keep up with the expenses of 2 in diapers and one in formula for 2 years has worked almost 70 hours a week.  Sometimes working 7 days in a row, sometimes working overnights and then sleeping for 2 hours and then working his regular day shift. 

And after all that, he still helps out when he isn't working.  He still gets up for night feedings.  He still wakes up at 5am when the kids get up, he still does dishes and sweeps the kitchen floor.  He still makes them lunch on weekend when he isn't working and he still gives them baths and whatever else he can muster when he is not working.  

Child care isn't part of his job or my job, its our life now.  We had kids, we both take care of them. Period. Kids are not chores they are a now a part of your life that you HAVE to do, like breathing or eating. 

I take care of these kids all day, I clean as I go because the amount of cleaning that these kids require is absurd.  I am 'on' 24 hours a day, I never get breaks, I don't get to drink my coffee in peace and some days I can't even get a shower in unless both kids nap at the same time.  I work hard while he is working hard.  So do you.  So why are you the only one who is working hard when he isn't working hard?  

It wasn't always this way.  I had to talk to him, tell him that I was overwhelmed that just because he is off of work that doesn't mean there is no work to be done here.  Why do I have to work from sun up to sun down and beyond while he gets a good 10 hours of break time?   He got it.  He changed. ",2016-09-08 13:52:54+00:00,d7e6490,1.0,t3_51rbkk,1037.0,breakingmom
479,"Well as far as the ""everything by the book"" daycare rules.  I would look at that as a good thing.  She is protecting herself as well as the children that she takes care of.  There is a ""book"" for a reason, it is for everyone's protection.

As far as your husband dropping the kid off and no one being there to take him.  What is that about?  How was there no one there, like no adults and a bunch of kids running around?  I wouldn't leave until someone met me and took my kid, but sometimes that has to wait a few depending on what the provider is dealing with at the time.  

As far as the toddler falling... toddlers fall all the time.  I don't even rush to my kid when he falls.  I kind of wait and see if he gets over it himself because he very rarely gets hurt bad enough to need my attention.  I sometimes I am handling whatever the baby needs at that time.   I only have 2 kids to watch and sometimes even my hands are too tied to pay attention to all the things going on. 

It sounds like you have found a decent place, her insistence on following the rules is something I would take as a good sign.  

Your kid might just be adjusting if he is not eating a ton or he could just be doing that baby thing where hey don't eat much for a few weeks just to freak out their mothers.  This is a thing, trust me.

496,"Ok, this is what I don't get when people argue child support, no offense intended but let me explain. 

My child support calculator for my state sets the cash amount, it is a formula, that is just how it works.   So according to the calculator if you add my and my exhusbands income together he is making 80% of the money.  According to the calculator it costs around $830 to pay expenses for a child in a month.  And because he makes 80% of the income, he pays me 80% of that amount, so $650 a month (he actually pays less because we decided to split extra curriculars 50/50)  this does not pay for things like unpaid medical bills.  There is an allowance for the fact that I pay for my son's medical insurance etc.  

That money goes toward taking care of the household that the kid lives in too, rent and things.  There is no way to divide everything up with any kind of reliability, which is why it is done by this percent. 

If the kid was living in a tent, and didn't have clothes to wear and wasn't eating anything but ramen and the person who owed the child support was paying $1200 a month, that is one thing.  But having to account for what my ex's money goes too, would not be possible. Accounting for like, percentage of time he is with me, with percentage of bills that would be the kids, like electricity... how do you calculate how much he uses individually?

So say I get paid $500 a week in salary and my child support is $150 a week.  So $650 is deposited into my bank account a week.  

I pay bills out of my bank account, rent utilities and food, school supplies, shoes etc.  kid is taken care of and everything is fine. 

I spend $150 on school for me, having the child support makes it easier for me to afford kid expenses so I can now afford $150 a week on school.

Who is paying for school? Is that $150 coming out of my $500 paycheck? Or is it coming out of my child support? 

It's like having a pitcher of water, and someone gives you a glass of water saying ""here is some water for the kid to drink"" and you add that glass of water to the pitcher and then pouring out a glass for you and one for the kid.

This was far before the internet was something in every household, we didn't even own a computer.  It all happened in the halls of the school, where I was verbally bullied and sexually assaulted.  We are talking about other 13 year olds grabbing at me in the cafeteria and putting their hands between my legs in the computer lab.   I thought I deserved it for having my first crush on a boy.  That boy just happened to have an older 14 year old girl who also had a crush on him... she started it... so many others finished it.  Don't get me wrong... teachers knew this was happening.. .I had gone to the people I trusted within the school and they did nothing. 

I remember that I used to miss the bus on purpose so I had to make the hour walk to school instead.  I remember the day I took the pills and I remember waking up in the hospital.  

Every single time I hear of a teenage suicide due to bullying I just cant take it.  I remember that desperation, the feeling of complete helplessness, the fact that NO ONE would help me no matter how hard I begged for help.   And I know that some of these teens reach out and they still don't get help in this age of the anti-bully. 

The only thing I can do now is keep the lines of communication open with my kids, make sure they know that I do not tolerate bullying from them and if they are the ones being bullied they can trust that I will do whatever I can to make it stop or to give them the tools they need to get through school unscathed.

It wasn't fair to him! He was not going to get the mom time that my first son had when he was a baby, he was going to have his needs overlooked because a new baby was coming, because I was pregnant, because I was selfish.  

Well, I can tell you now, my youngest is 12 months today and my toddler is 25 months yesterday, I barely remember feeling that way at all.  You know how you feel now?  Where everything is falling into place with your kid, where you are feeling content with having a kid everything feels fine the way it is?   You will feel that again.   

Motherhood is a strange strange journey, but nature has prepared us for it in a way we could never predict.  Having 2 kids will become normal soon enough and then everything will fall into place again.  You wont think about those guilty feelings again. 

I always say, and so many of you Bromoms have seen me say it.  When you have a baby its as if someone hads you a full glass of love, you think this is all the love you can offer because it is SO MUCH... you think, how is it possible that I am going to have another baby... will I get an empty glass? and will have I have to fill it with half of this love I have?  Will my first kid suffer because so much of his love is taken away?  Well its not like that... you don't get an empty glass, you get another full one!  Everything will fell right again with time.  You will do great! ",2016-08-24 19:38:57+00:00,d6v2msv,1.0,t3_4ze5fq,2596.0,breakingmom

634,"I feel like I didn't bond with my second child at all, even 2 years later.  I also feel like its completely my fault. 

He was very much wanted.  We tried for him for 5 years, fertility clinic and all.  Birth was not bad, it went on for 46 hours, but 46 painless epidural hours.  He was born and cute as can be.  Pretty easy baby.  We had some trouble with breastfeeding at first but then at 3 months old that all fell into place.... and then... I got pregnant, and then my milk dried up and I felt extremely guilty for getting pregnant by accident even after years and years of infertility, I had ruined our breastfeeding relationship that I had worked so hard for and I robbed him of his time with me as a baby.  

He was a good baby, but I was pregnant and it was a hard pregnancy because it hadn't been enough time for my body to heal.  

Now he is high energy, loud and crazy.  Our personalities are complete opposite and maybe that is the reason we never really bonded.   Don't get me wrong, he is my child and I would jump in front of a train for him, but I just never got that bond that I got with my other children.

645,"My kids school was at the bottom of the hill we lived on.  Its a huge hill, the walk alone would take 20 minutes down.  We lived in an apartment complex and the bus stopped way too far away to be worth it, it was almost as far away as the school.   My husband worked from home so he would drop off and pick up the kid.   All was fantastic while he was doing drop off and pick up. And then I had a baby and became a SAHM and he started working in the office so pick up and drop off was now on me.   Drop off was painless.  Kid was in 3rd grade.  So, pull up to curb, kid gets out, drive away. 

Pick up?  We had to park, in a parking lot that held 30 cars max, and we all had to go in and wait in the lobby, the 20 ft by 20ft lobby.  So the parking lot, everyone would park on the grass, in the driveway to get to the school, double park in two lines down each parking row, so if you did get a space, once you got back to your car with your kid you had to wait for the other asshats to get their kids and for them to move.  

So once you got in there you had to wait with all the other parents and grandparents and they would release kids by grade.  They would come up to the velvet roped off area and you had to yell ""THAT ONES MINE!"" and point to your kid, and the teacher/attendant standing there had to cross you off a list. 

I was doing this pregnant for a while and it was fine, no biggie.  So then I had that baby and promptly got pregnant with another kid.  I would carry the baby with my pregnant belly to the school everyday to pick up the kid, take the baby out of the seat, drag him inside, go through the dance of picking up the kid and then put the baby back in the car for the 5 minute drive home.  

Because I just got bigger and the baby just got bigger I needed to park closest to the school as possible so I would get there at 2:30, where the baby would then scream his head off in the back seat for a half an hour because god forbid we were in the car and not moving...

Oh and did I mention there was no cell phone signal there? ",2016-08-23 00:27:29+00:00,d6sltpm,1.0,t3_4z3kgd,2026.0,breakingmom

It took about a month for it to go any kid of smoothly because until they knew who you were you had to go up to the door, ring a bell, they would open it and ask which kid was yours.

Over the years we have had to come to terms with the fact that rules are extremely different at each others houses.  We both have very different parenting philosophies, he believes that kids should have zero screen time and that video games, computers and electronics are strictly for adults.   I am the complete opposite.  I think this day and age not letting your kids at electronics and computers is doing them a disservice.  So he is a regular kid at my house who does the same things most of kids at school do to reading only non TV at dad's, even if dad is watching it.  This is only one of many examples, but this is the most extreme.

One of the things we do is communicate strictly over email. When my son was a baby it was because we just couldn't talk without yelling and now its just the norm for us.   We do not speak to each other in person other than to say a polite hello at little league games and science fairs.  Its shitty and I have tried to change it for my sons sake but my ex refuses to have any kind of relationship with me at all.

He can not communicate with anyone around him except in whines and cries.  So imagine he shit his pants... because of severe loss of memory and very little understanding of the world, he doesn't know that what has happened is that he shit his pants, he just knows that there is something gross and smelly stuck to his butt... so he starts whining trying to get the attention of the person he knows loves him and takes care of him to let him know that he needs help.   Now what if that person started sarcastically whining back at him instead of showing some compassion to his situation and coming to help, or you are just plain ignored.  This makes you sad and lonely and feeling abandoned. 

You can apply this logic to lots of situations.  Like hunger, tiredness, not being comfortable in the seat your caregiver put you in and your foot is falling asleep.

736,"Well its really good that they have a court ordered custody agreement.  That pretty much governs everything.  But he can absolutely set boundaries about the phone calls.  He has to be stern and it may even take years to get through to her, but allowing it to happen is only making her continue doing it.   I would encourage him to write her an email stating it, outlining that phone calls after a certain time like 8pm should be for emergencies only.  That way he has proof and can not accused by her of something crazy like neglect and her saying something like ""He refused to take my phone calls after 8pm! What if the kid was hurt or in the hospital!""  That would obviously be an emergency.  When it comes to custody I am a strong proponent of ""everything in writing""

As for my ex's fiance.  I cant imagine anything I wouldn't want her to talk about with him, I mean, as long as she isn't threatening him or telling him I am a bad person then anything goes really.  I am sure you wouldn't do something like that, but just treat the kid as any other kid that you would run into that is 2.

If I were him and she was calling that late to basically accuse him of abuse I would tell her ""Do not call me unless it is an emergency. If you have a problem, write me an email and we will discuss it""  That way you also have a record in writing.

I am always polite, and try to talk to her (I dont think she likes me very much at all), after all she is a large part of my sons life.

If you are not currently engaged or planning a wedding I wouldn't go as far as telling your son that he was getting a new brother.  Just that your boyfriend has a son just like you have a son, and that he lives with his mom, just like your son lives with you and that he will come and stay a lot. 

As for my relationship with my sons future stepmom.  We do not talk directly about much of anything, only polite 'Hi how are you's' when we see each other at school events and little league games.   All correspondence regarding my son goes through me and my exhusband and no one else, not even my husband who I have been with now for 9 years.

If your husband is self employed and has the tax returns to prove that his income is sufficient and steady for at least the last 2 years and the DTI is within range they really shouldn't be denying you.   I have seen a lot of self employed loans get denied over DTI, not strictly because of the self employed status. 

They should be giving you a letter that tells you why you were denied exactly, its the law.  Most lenders will tell you what you need to show in paperwork to fix that reason, lenders want to give out home loans they make a lot of money off of those.

* Work

* Do the dishes

* Take out the trash.  

My list includes

* Taking care of 4 human beings (yes he counts) Its a full time job so is comparable to his ""Working"" its not less valuable because I don't get paid. 

* Cleaning (I listed each job separately, like washing the kitchen floor, scrubbing the toilet)

* Handling all the finances

* Cooking all the meals

* All the grocery shopping and putting the groceries away

* Planning and executing any and all family outings. 


There was more to my list, but you get the point.   The reason we got into this fight was because he kept not doing the dishes, he would let them go a week and then we would have no clean dishes and a huge pile of rotten dirty dishes stinking up the place and then I would be tasked with doing damage control and spending an entire day ignoring everything else I had to do just to catch up on dishes. 

I asked him if he would like to start doing the dishes every night like he is supposed to or would he like to split this family needs list up to be a bit more equal.  I do not call the stuff that needs to be done around here 'chores'  I call them family needs, as in the family needs these things done, therefor the entire family chips in.  

He seems to be invalidating your feelings.  You need to tell him that no, you should not feel however he thinks you should. THIS IS HOW YOU FEEL and he needs to listen to that and believe it and not to force what his opinion is on your feelings.   He needs to change his perspective and for ONCE take into account that your feelings are valid and that if he doesn't want to believe that he needs to know that your marriage is in jeopardy.  Basically everything that is coming out of his mouth is manipulative and he is manipulating you into allowing him to be a lazy ass, and as far as I can tell its working. 

Yes standing up for yourself might shatter your marriage, and that sucks, but living this way is not exactly doing you any favors. ",2016-08-11 01:42:02+00:00,d6co5ry,1.0,t3_4x5fzu,2847.0,breakingmom

I like gas better, but have had electric for the past 18 years.  

I like gas better because there is better control over the temperature.  Like I could be cooking something on high but the recipe I am using calls for lowered heat at a certain point.  I can lower the heat on a gas stove instantly, where as there is a cool down period that goes with electric.  You can skirt this by lifting up the pan off the burner, but thats hard to do if the pan is heavy.  This also goes for turning up heat, instant larger flames, a bit of a heating up period that comes with electric.  So you can better gauge how much heat you are getting from your burner instantly instead of waiting. 

If you know what you are doing the taste is the same, its not like you are cooking over wood or coals where the burning material effects the taste.  

My mom has always had a gas stove, never electric.  Whenever she uses my stove she burns things because she doesn't get how they work. ",2016-08-08 18:30:57+00:00,d69bts2,1.0,t3_4wrmww,453.0,breakingmom

My husband was a basement dwelling single guy for a long long time, his sister is a single party loving lesbian who does not want kids.   So when I showed interest in their son, and I had a 1 year old already they were like... dude, you better keep this one... she COMES WITH A GRANDCHILD!  And then I had 2 more.  They live an hour away and do not understand why we are not spending every single weekend at their house.  They usually take over most of the childcare when we are there, they are early risers, up before 5, so they take the kids and let us sleep in, they play with them, take them in the pool all of it. 

My parents on the other hand were grandparents at the ripe old age of 33 and 34, they were divorced at the time.   My sister was a teen mom, they were not even done raising their own kids, let alone a grand child.  So they didn't really do the whole doting grandparent stuff because they were pissed.  Don't get me wrong, they love their grand kids, but grandparents in their early 30's?  I'd be pissed too.  

So they do interact with their grandkids but not as much as my in-laws.  They talk to them, they give them gifts, but they would never get up at 6 with them.  My kids are 10 years, 2 years and 11 months.  My mom has babysat for me once, my dad... never, not once in 10 years.  When we are visiting them its adults talking while kids play on the floor and are chased and entertained by their own parents.

At that moment you need to go to her, give her a hug, take the baby and tell her to get some sleep and that you will handle it""  BEST ADVICE EVER GIVEN ON THE PLANET.  It happened with both pregnancies, he took the screaming baby and let me sleep for 2 hours until the baby needed to eat again, I can not even tell you how much that meant to me. 

Trust your husband.  No seriously.  Trust him.  Don't expect him to do everything the way you do it, and don't expect every way you do things with the baby to be the 'right' way.   Let him figure it out.  Basic things like diaper changes and stuff are kind of standard, but let him figure out how to soothe the baby when its not hungry and just needs comfort.  Don't nit pick at his ways unless they are truly dangerous. 

And more importantly give each other some slack.  New parenthood is hard on everyone involved.  Take deep breaths and pick your battles.  ",2016-08-04 15:54:17+00:00,d641sx9,1.0,t3_4w537b,1182.0,breakingmom

There wasn't any jealousy, I think because he was very young when his brother was born, he had just turned a year old the month before.   

Just recently, like in the last few weeks they have started to play together sometimes.  Its very cute, I will catch them sitting quietly while Ollie shows his baby brother how to do something or he pretends to read a book to him.  He gets very upset when his baby cries or is upset, he brings him toys to try to make him feel better.   I remember when he was very small, only a few months old and he was crying in his rock and play and I came in and he was covered in toys that Ollie had brought him in an effort to make him feel better.   But he also rips toys out of his hands for no reason and throws them across the room, so regular brother stuff even this early. 

Its hilarious and fun a lot of the time.  Just a lot of work. ",2016-08-04 14:14:50+00:00,d63x7zy,5.0,t1_d63wteb,590.0,breakingmom
887,"The hardest part right afterwards was having a toddler who was into everything and I was stuck sitting down breastfeeding.  And you know how it is when they are little, they don't know what they are doing at the boob so you kind of have to sit and cant move.    I ended up getting a [baby pen](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Baby-Playpen-Kids-8-Panel-Safety-Play-Center-Yard-Home-Indoor-Outdoor-New-Pen/29589506) and threw some toys in it so I could just throw the toddler in there and feed the baby. 

They are now 2 years old and 11 months old.  Leaving them alone together for any length of time now is an issue.  Like the toddler is always sitting on, rolling over, standing on, or hitting the baby.  I am lucky in that I live in an old house, so I have two rooms that are connected by a double doorway.  Originally supposed to be a livingroom and a dining room.  We have it set up as a living room and a playroom.  I have a baby gate separating the rooms which I leave open during the day and if I have to make dinner I put the toddler in the playroom and close the gate.  I also have a 10 year old from my first marriage and when he is home and not spending the night at his dads he watches them for me. 

We plan on having them share a room, but we are not there yet so the 11 month old is still sleeping in our room.  They will most definitely wake each other up and I am just not cool with that right now, they both wake for the day at the exact same time somehow though at 5:30am

The beginning was a shock, when everything was crazy and I couldn't for the life of me get into a routine, because newborns don't fall into a routine for like 3 months.  But 8 out of 10 times now I can get them to nap a the same time so I have a minute to myself and can shower and all that. 

But I would say the absolute hardest part of all of it is being a SAHM with two people who can't really talk to me and who demand stuff from me at every moment of my day.   Some days I feel like these two rooms are my prison and I get really sad and depressed about it.  There is always someone touching me, wanting to sit on me, wanting me to play trains, wanting me to play blocks.  Always someone crying, screaming, whining.   I was prepared for all that, I was not prepared about how I would feel about it.   I get sad and I get frustrated at all this.   But most days are fine and its going through the motions.

900,"This is just from my experience in my state.  I could not even try to serve papers to my ex from another state unless I first established residency in that state.   

I am currently not allowed to move out of state with my child.  It does not say that in our custody agreement, but if I did try to move out of state my ex could file for an emergency hearing to stop my move. Which he is allowed to do even if I want to move in state.  It would then be on me to prove that the move with my child would be in his best interest, there are very few reasons my state would allow an out of state move.  One of them being for a better job that pays substantially more and would improve his quality of life... thats actually pretty much it.   If however the judge granted me my move and the travel time for my son to visit his dad was substantial it would be on me to figure out how to get the kid to him at his visitation times, not on him to drive to he next state to get him or pay huge amounts of money to pay for plane tickets or whatever. 

If they already have a custody agreement take a look at it and see what it says regarding moves.  There may be laws in your state that are similar to this.  Most of that stuff can be found online if you know what you are looking for. 

I would say first look up custody laws in your state and see what they say regarding out of state moves.  Then if your son can not afford a lawyer I would try to find out if your state has any low income family law help.  I had to apply through the state and it only cost me a few hundred dollars for an lawyer.   If you get a hearing and her move is blocked and it has nothing about moving like when he has to be notified get it put in at the same time.

I threw up the entire time I was pregnant with my first.  When I was pregnant with my second I was 100% fine until I was 4 months pregnant and then I started throwing up.  The only reason I would have known I was pregnant was because I was under intense medical monitoring.  

The third surprise pregnancy, I got my period, 4 days of regular but light bleeding.  When it stopped I was like... I usually have my period for like 2-3 weeks, that was weird.  So a few days later, because I had a bunch of pregnancy tests lying around from the fertility treatments I took one.  Didn't even look at it because I KNEW it would be negative and left it in the bathroom.  Came back 3 hours later to throw it away because my oldest was coming home from school and there it was in all its two line positive glory.

The thing about divorce and your kid? Don't feel bad about that, seriously.  I am a firm believer that divorce is harder on grown kids than young ones.

No.""  She was in her 60's! and didn't even have marriage problems, she was just done.  

Literally the best thing you can do for that is stay out of it, or if your mom wants to bad mouth your dad just tell her that you aren't interested in hearing it and doesn't she have some friends she can bitch to about that?

[ShoppingList](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shopping-list-grocery-list/id360112255?mt=8) I went through several different grocery store apps before finding this one.  It is the best, you can add the prices from your grocery store so you can make a grocery list on a budget and its actually accurate to pricing. It took me a few shopping trips to get all my regular items priced but it was worth it. 

Google sheets.  I know, it sounds lame, but I have my whole budget mapped out on a spreadsheet and I can access it and change it from anywhere. 

Like games? [Monument Valley](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monument-valley/id728293409?mt=8) is one of my favorites.  I can keep going back and playing it even though I've played through a few times already. 

Edit to add. In light of /u/vilebunny suggesting kid apps to keep your kid busy, please for the love of all things apple order yourself a case immediately.  iphones are fragile little creatures, I also suggest a ballistic glass screen protector.  You can get them from aliexpress for like $2 each instead of the ones on amazon, who basically order from ali, hike the price to $14 and then sell it to you.  

I am adding more... do you have Amazon Prime?

&gt; See, I don't make my kids share in the middle of using something. I teach sharing but I guess not in the conventional way yes, you need to share but there are limitations. For instance, I have two toddlers, when toddler #2 is playing with something that ""belongs"" to toddler #1, toddler #1 is NOT allowed to go over and take it, nor can he have it back right now, he can play with it when toddler #2 is done, because he clearly did not want it until he saw his brother playing with it, he is sharing his toys then.

&gt; But if toddler #2 is holding on to toddler #1's comfort item, he can definitely have it back right now, because that is NOT a toy for toddler #2 to play with.
So I guess I do force my kids to share, though I think that the old philosophy of requiring kids to give up something they are playing with right then at the will of others is not the way to go.

You on the other hand don't see that you did anything wrong, because that was not your intent.  Someone can do no wrong and still offend, thats ok, it happens.

That said.  I always said my favorite part of toddlerhood is when only I can understand what my kid is trying to say.  I dunno, it feels like I am in some kind of secret club.  No one understands my son, he is 2, and he jabbers on in all kinds of languages.  My oldest son went through a stage where everything he said had a french accent.  

As for the tantrums, that sounds normal to me too, but probably because that is how my toddler is.  The screaming is so annoying.  If he is screaming enough to have a tantrum or hit me or scratch me, which he has done both, he gets put in the gated off playroom and I walk away.  Telling him ""You do NOT hit!"" Leave him until he calms down.  I mean, he is in there with basically all his toys, how bad can it be.  He will eventually calm own and go on playing, and I will go in and ask him if he is ready to come and be with Mum.  

Toddlers are hard, its just their nature.  But like I said, if you do have concerns you just ask the doctor at his next visit, there is no harm in asking and they will understand. ",2016-07-16 21:16:04+00:00,d5exwsh,1.0,t3_4t6f25,1486.0,breakingmom

Look at it this way, his temper, his inability to show you affection his flat out meanness, that he isn't doing anything to improve... is that who you want to live with for the rest of your life?  Life is short.

However, I have three children.  The first two were conceived with the help of metformin and clomid and the last was a complete surprise, unplanned natural pregnancy.   

So a PCOS diagnosis does not mean it will be difficult getting pregnant but it doesn't mean it's impossible either.   If I had a dime for ever unexpected PCOS pregnancy I have seen on PCOS forums and even my own friends.  

It's ok to grieve.  It's not an easy thing to hear and facing the reality of it can be an emotional mess.  You take your time, there is no rush or time period that you need to set yourself to feel better.

1122,"How is your level of cooking ability?  I ask because I am an every 2 week shopper, it saves me money this way, and it takes a fair amount of creativity at the end of the two weeks when supplies are running low. 

So, I don't ""Meal plan"" per se, but I do have staples and I pretty much buy the same list of things every time I shop. 

We have meat every day, we don't eat pasta, I buy it for the occasional easy lunch for the kids but my husband and I do not eat it. And beans are friggin gross. 

So, [here is a link to my shopping](https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/4qaj11/i_think_i_spend_a_shit_ton_on_food/d4rhhlp) as I explained it in another post.  I make sure that I have a lot of seasoning things around, like soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, good mustard, a full spice rack, etc.  and I just throw stuff together most nights.  

I buy fresh produce, but I also buy a big bag of potatoes, carrots and sweet potatoes because the fresh produce is used up the first week so it doesn't go bad, so we need things that last for the second week. 

If you have stuff in the cabinet and fridge and you have no idea how to put it together you can use a sight that has an ingredient search and find new things to make.  I don't worry if I am missing and ingredient or two because I can usually leave it out or substitute something I have that I think might work.

I am fortunate that I can install a window air conditioner, but we only have one on each floor.  One is in our master bedroom and one in the livingroom.   I keep the kids rooms cool by putting window fans in each room facing out, so the hot air is blowing out and the cool air is being pulled in from the hallway. 

My livingroom and playroom are like one big room so the kitchen is the only room without AC, I put up curtains over the door into the kitchen to keep the living area as cool as it can be.  Cheap tension rod and some curtain rings did the job there, I can open it when its cool.

Mediation doesn't have to be the final step, just so you are aware of that.

Do not allow them to bully you. 

So as far as advice.  Go in with base custody agreement you want.  Like if you only want him to have every other weekend or whatever you go in with that.   I say this because he may agree to that and that's cool, but if he comes with his own, which could be on the complete opposite spectrum and he wants full custody with you having visitation then you can bargain somewhere in the middle.  

Make sure you come in with all your bases covered, and I mean ALL OF THEM.  What will happen on long weekends? Will he keep him until Monday?  What if fathers day falls on your weekend? Will you switch?  Who takes the kid Trick or Treating, every other year?   Easter, labor day, your birthday, the kids birthday... seriously, get it all in there.  Christmas, Christmas Eve, Thanksgiving, school days off.  Don't ever assume that 2 or 3 years down the line anything you unofficially agreed to that is not in the court order, like long weekends will stick.

1210,"In my experience there is a point where you just cant reason with some arguments.   I obviously have little information but I can tell you what i do with my son.  And that is do not let him finish.  When my son is talking back. 

Go to your room! ""But I want..."" GO TO YOUR ROOM!  ""BUT I WANT TO..."" GO TO YOUR ROOM! 

Repeat until he gets frustrated and storms off to slam the door.  Its not a perfect way but it gets him out of my hair and to a place where he will calm down.   My reasons for this is I already heard what he wants and he cant have it.  I am not going to listen to him say the same thing over and over at me.  

When he was that age this worked sometimes.  There were times where I had to carry him to his room over and over not saying a word.  He already heard my stance on the matter and I was not listening or responding again.  

I am a firm believer in explaining to kids why they are in trouble rather than resorting to screaming anger, but lets all be honest here, sometimes the only thing that gets through to them is losing your shit enough to scare them into fucking listening to your god damn authority.

1216,"I am a SAHM, with a annual household income of under 55k a year.  We are a family of 5.  Two adults, one 10 year old a 2 year old and a 10 month old, so everyone here is eating solids.   I spend $450 on groceries a month, with an additional $100 on top of that for paper products, diapers, laundry detergent etc. 

How do I do it?  Well for starters I live in Market Basket country, and you really cant beat that in and of itself. I shop every 2 weeks, not once a week, I found that I spent more when I went every week.  I make sure that I shop the flyer for sales, so if I am going to be buying deli meats, I buy whats on sale, usually I buy a pound each of some kind of meat, turkey, ham etc.  And then I buy 2 pounds of land o lakes american cheese.  We eat a lot of eggs, I usually buy 3 dozen eggs.  3 gallons of milk.  I get yogurt, 14 of them exactly, the only ones who eat it are the babies and they don't get it everyday.  but there is one per day. four 8oz bricks of cheese, whichever is on sale.   One giant box of cereal for the 10 year old.   Low carb pita bread, 2lbs coffee, almond milk, salsa.  A few cans of cream of chicken soup, tomato soup and cream of mushroom.  You can make so many things with just those.  A few cans of diced tomatos.  2 boxes of chicken broth. 2 boxes of pasta.  2 Bags of tortilla chips. 2 loaves of bread. 

Then its meats, I will again shop sale.  I will get 3lbs of ground beef, 3 lbs of boneless chicken.  Usually a few packages of chicken drumsticks. The next week I go I might get pork chops or pork loin, italian sausages, etc.  instead to change things up.  1 beef roast. 

For produce I will get 2 large bunches of bananas, watermelon if it is available, strawberries, blueberries, apples, lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes.  Fresh garlic, broccoli, carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes and green beans.  Yellow and red onions. 


For stuff I don't have to buy all the time but have on hand to put into meals.  Rice, I always big a giant 5lb bag of jasmine rice.  Assorted cream soups for sauces, all sorts of spices, brown sugar, soy sauce. Various condiments. Tuna, I for some reason always have like 10 cans of tuna in my cabinet. 

For the trick to how it lasts 2 weeks.  I make sure that the deli meat is consumed first for lunches.  Sandwiches for everyone for lunch for a few days, you can always put different stuff in sandwiches to make them different like onions, lettuce, tomatoes.  Egg salad sandwiches, tuna sandwiches, so many lunch sandwich options, and it doesn't have to be boring like your mom's boxed school lunch sandwiches, you can dress up anything. 

I can make a pound of chicken feed a family of 5 just by cubing it and adding it to some vegetables for a stir fry over rice or for a tomato chicken veggie pasta dish.  Same thing with ground beef, add it to a sauce and serve it over zucchini noodles if you don't want the startchy white carbs of pasta.   Also cubed chicken+cream of chicken soup+ $2 bag of frozen mixed veggies and you've got yourself some chicken pie filling you can serve over rice. 

That beef roast I mentioned, put it in a crock pot on high with soy sauce and brown sugar and some garlic and cook it until you can pull it apart.  You now have pulled teriyaki beef for tacos or nachos.  Send the husband to work with some pulled beef a pita bread or some tortilla, some chopped tomatoes and lettuce, some grated cheese and thats better than any frozen burrito you can buy. 

I have perfected my shopping over the years to last long and cost less.  There is more to it than just whats in this post but its starting to get long.... 

I also forget to add to my grocery list, school stuff, juice boxes, snacks etc.

I will say that I had to make all these straps myself because they don't sell them long enough to go from the top of my furniture to the floor, it seems that old houses are a thing that the safety industry just kind of overlooks.

I super glued all the straps in their positions and then used some super heavy duty thread to sew over and over it so that they will not break at all.

I was brought up atheist.  My parents would say not, but lack of religion is how I was raised.  No church, no talk about any gods, nothing.  We were not baptized.   I would consider myself an Atheist, as does my husband who was brought up Catholic, and my ex husband who was brought up Christian. 

We celebrated Christmas and Easter as non religious holidays, because, what does a Christmas tree and a fat man in red and a rabbit giving out chocolate have to do with religion anyway? 

We do the same with my kids, we have the advantage of our families not pushing the religious side of it, they go to midnight mass and do all of that, but we don't.  

When my oldest who is 10 came home talking about religion because his fathers family is very Christian, we told him that there was a nice big book of stories, and a lot of people believe those stories to be true, myself and his dad and step dad do not.

How I dealt with it had a LOT to do with how my husband handled it.   He knew he fucked up, he knew it was on HIM to do what he needed to do to gain my trust back and not on me to do it alone.  That was HUGE.  But, it was also on me to try to forgive and not just be constantly bitter and angry.  Don't get me wrong there was a lot of bitterness and anger, and I definitely expressed these things liberally at the beginning.  But there was a point, where it was clear that he was doing all he could, and I just couldn't keep beating a dead horse about it, if I kept doing that I would always feel bitter and I would never get past it myself. 

One of the things that really mattered was what our relationship was like without the romantic couple part.  Meaning he and I were best friends before we got together as a couple, so the bond of that friendship was what we fell back on, and still do in tough times in our marriage, when things went south.   The romantic couple relationship took a back burner for a LONG TIME.  We are talking a few years.   We coexisted as friend, best friends, which at the root of everything is what we are.  

As for his part, he never got angry at me when I needed to talk to him about what happened, never blamed me for holding it over his head, never told me I should just ""get over it""  He was understanding and he sat and listened and told me he was sorry, and he cried when I cried, and he sat there and listened whenever I had to scream and yell at him about it, and he apologized again every time I had to talk about it.  He never got angry at me for his mistake, he never blamed me for his mistake.   He was completely transparent and never did anything that would risk my trust again, and that made it easy to trust him again eventually.

For my part I tried not to bring it up in every fight... like he didn't do the dishes... ""WELL YOU ARE THE ONE WHO BETRAYED ME!""  No, that's not fair.    I didn't bring it up in fights at all, unless we were fighting over that particular thing.  I tried to look forward, not backwards.

I would go to walmart and stand in front of the formula for an hour... looking...deciding, and ultimately leaving with nothing.   When he was 4 months old everything kind of clicked into place, the breastfeeding was great, we were doing it and loving it... and then I got pregnant by accident and my milk supply dropped, so I was now newly pregnant and up feeding this kid every hour at night because he was too young for solids and it was hell.  I cried when I decided to stop, I was devastated for me and for him.  But once I did stop... oh the relief!  The guilt faded pretty quickly. 

So on to my third... THIS TIME WE ARE DOING IT FOR A YEAR! But he had a weak latch, and you cant exactly get a baby to suck harder, they suck how they want...  so my supply just dropped and dropped.  Finally gave up at 2.5 months.  Again with the guilt.  But a few weeks after I stopped OH THE RELIEF!  And the guilt faded and I felt great.  

You do what you feel comfortable with, you stop on your own time... each time I held on and held on and held on... one more week, one more day... one more feeding until I just could not go on anymore.   If you feel done, then you go ahead and be done.

I understand where you are coming from, my sister had her son when she was 15 and when she turned 21 just kind of dropped him off at my moms house for three years, and only saw him on weekends.  But that was my mom, not his dad, so getting him back when she was ready was easy.

The reason why I think you should do 50/50 at first is because if you do go ahead and give up primary custody and go to a ""dad"" kind of schedule, I have a feeling that if you ever want to change that, say a few years down the road, after you have had some freedom a judge is going to see that you just gave that up, and your ex might use that to his advantage to not allow you more custody time.   You might feel like 50/50 is enough freedom, you might not. But I don't want you to have regrets about that either.

1333,"First things first.  You are not horrible. 

When I got divorced I was 26 and we did almost 50/50, so basically its not like a week on and a week off like a lot of people do, its more like every other weekend and days during the week and it adds up to about 50/50.   I have primary 'physical' custody, which basically only means he goes to the school system in my town. 

So, if you wanted to go 50/50, you still get a lot of freedom.  Its super, my husband and I used to have long weekends together and (ex gets the oldest from Thursday night to Monday morning, every other week) and it was so nice, going out all the time, having the freedom to have no kids around.  Ex also gets him every other Wendesday and Thursday nights. Man those morning getting up for work were easy.    I think 50/50 is the best of both worlds really.   Its fair to both parents and kids and both parents get their alone time and freedom.  

Of course if you want to do a weekend schedule and not have primary custody, that doesn't make you a bad person.  It makes you just fine and normal.   However, know that if you agree on that right up front if you want to change it down the line, the chances are slim.  Custody agreements are hard to change.  

If I were in your shoes I would try 50/50 and see from there and then if you still don't feel that is the right schedule for you, you can try to change that. ",2016-06-17 19:48:05+00:00,d4dgkuf,1.0,t3_4okz0a,701.0,breakingmom

I am not from Florida, I have been there one time for a wedding and I was there all of 2 days.  I KNOW there are alligators in Florida.  I know they are everywhere, and can be seen walking down the street even... I have animal planet on my TV.  

However.  If I was at a Disney Resort with my family, and we were on a man made beach, I would not automatically assume that there was a threat of alligators.   If there were signs posted warning of alligators, I would probably not be anywhere near the water, but from the news sites that I have visited there is always this line ""There are no warning signs of gators in the area, but there are notices posted against swimming in the man-made lake."" I have seen a lot of people from florida posting in other subs, and I have noticed that they keep saying, there should have been a gator warning, as there are gator warnings on a lot of signs in florida that are near water, though I don't know how true that its.   Of all places, a Disney resort that caters to out of state visitors, you would think that gator warnings at a body of water would be a thing that they would put up? 

So where I am from there are signs not to swim in a lot of lakes.  But we don't have alligators, so we still walk along the water, and we even put our feet in, because swimming means swimming, not stay away from the water.   ",2016-06-15 16:22:42+00:00,d4ac7lr,1.0,t3_4o80ls,1455.0,breakingmom

My husband went into the court, the judge asked him why he hadn't paid.  He explained he had offered the collector what we could afford without going into complete financial ruin.  The judge looked at the affidavit, looked at what we offered per month, which was just $50 and said ""Looks like what you are offering is fair considering your income, $50 a month it is""

1396,"My 10 year old is a screen junkie.  He has his own gaming PC and an ipod touch. I am not too worried about it.  He has one single interest and thats video games.  He has been fascinated by them since he was about 2.  He literally is not interested in anything else.   We still have mandatory reading time at night, but most of the time we buy him video game related books, he complains less.  He watches ""youtubers"" don't even get me started on those annoying bastards. 

I grew up in a house with the tv on all day, for background noise, so we do the same thing just because that is what I am accustomed to.  Its fine, the babies very rarely look at it, even when there are kids shows on. 

We do not let the almost 2 year old have our phones or tablets yet.  The baby is too young.  Youtube videos for him are chromecasted to the the tv in the livingroom and they are limited to those videos of trains.  I will not allow those unboxing videos, I hate them, and my kid gets irrationally angry when he cant have the toy featured (my husband put one on one time).  

We plan on getting the little babies those kindles for kids.  

Screens are a big deal now, they are part of our everyday lives.  There are giant screens built into refrigerators now for christs sake.  I do not believe that they should be or can be avoided.  By the time these kids are in high school everything is going to be a screen, not teaching them about them, or not letting them use them is, in my opinion, a doing them a disservice.

She was so mean to my mom all the time even as a toddler, so when my mom had another baby all of her closest friends would say ""Why? How can you have another one with her?""

So, this is what I do. My house is never truly 100% clean unless there are people coming here.  So.  While the kids eat breakfast I will clean the kitchen table off and wipe down the counters.   I wipe off the bathroom counters after I take a shower.

After the kids go to bed my husband and I pick up the toys and the livingroom and playroom floor get vacuumed.  Once a week the kitchen gets a more thorough cleaning, with the floor mopped and the counters are then cleaned properly.   This is also when the bathroom gets a more thorough cleaning with the husband distracts the kids. 

I think one of the things that makes it a little bit easier and less overwhelming is that my husband helps and definitely does his share.

Throw in some soy sauce (1/4 cup) and a little bit of brown sugar (2 tbsp) and garlic powder, add some frozen vegetables, cover and cook for like 5-10 minutes until the veggies are tender. Serve over rice.  

Grilled cheese and soup is also quick and not too terrible. 

Quick salad with ham or turkey and cheese added, I have a kid who loves salad, but if yours doesn't that may be an issue. 

Quick pasta and veggies. I will put pasta on to boil and a few minutes before it is done I will throw some broccoli into the water to cook with the pasta.  While that is cooking I make a sauce in a pan out of sauteed mushrooms and butter, add some Parmesan cheese and a bit of garlic, you can also add a bit of cream to it, heavy cream is good but I have used half and half with good results.

First kid I was in labor with minor pain for 12 hours.  Like I was uncomfortable and everything, contractions every minute forever but nothing that I would call earth shattering pain or anything.  So when I started to stall out at 3 cm they gave me an epidural first and then the pitocin.  Didn't feel a damn thing after that, I could still feel the contractions happening, but there was no pain at all.  Was in labor for another 14 hours, so 26 hours total.  Pushed the baby out in a half hour.  Pretty good really...

Second kid I was in labor, and I stalled out at 6 cm and was given pitocin again, but the epidural this time came after.  Again, I was in pain, but nothing I couldn't handle, but my doctor wanted me to wait until 8cm to get the epidural so I did.  Pushed the kid out with two pushes, all in all pretty good.  Total labor 46 hours. 

My last kid was born only 13 months after my second, so I went into labor and went into the hospital and had zero time to get an epidural and he was born in 3 hours, completely natural, no pain meds.  

None of those times did I have a birth plan or any expectations as to what was going to happen.  I knew going in that everything was up in the air and I had very little control.  I think that is what made it all so easy for me.

Then one time he says  ""I think I have diabetes""  Oh yeah? What makes you say that?  ""Well, I have been drinking a ton of water today and my pee is still bright yellow! It should be clear!""   Uh, yeah no, thats not a symptom of diabetes.

1663,"Well first things first. 

They cant garnish your wages unless they get a court order. 

Second.  Call the attorney, tell them you can pay x amount a month, and literally give them a number you can afford, and even low ball it, even if its $25 a month.   They will do one of two things.  They will accept your payment plan and you can start paying them $25 a month or they can take you to court. 

When they take you to court you will have to fill out a financial affidavit, which will itemize all your expenses and your income.  MAKE SURE YOU ARE THOROUGH, not just big bill, but everything down to what you pay for tampons.  Usually they actually have spaces for that.  Its a court form, you can probably find it online for your state. 

So, when you get to court, the judge is probably going to ask you  whats up, you say, I offered a payment plan I can afford, the attorney refuses to take it.  The judge may make you pay a larger amount but they also should see that you tried to make a payment plan and the attorney refused it and may just make you pay the $25 a month... 

Second.  find out what that statute of limitations on debt collection is in your state.   Mine is 3 years, meaning if the debt is 3 years old, and I haven't paid a dime in that time, they can no longer take me to court for it.  They can try to collect until the end of time, but that doesn't mean they will get anything, and they have no legal recourse. 

So, if thats the case and they cant take you to court or dont, then you will carry that debt on your credit report for 7 years from the date of the last activity.  SO, if you have a debt that is 3 years old and you have NEVER made a payment on it, EVEN IF IT HAS PASSED FROM COLLECTOR TO COLLECTOR A MILLION TIMES, it will fall off your credit report in 4 years, or 7 years from the last date of activity, and that means last date of activity from the original lender, and you will never see it again. 

Edit:  Also, a word about credit... if you have a debt for like $25 on your credit report that is 6 years old.  If you pay it now, it will most likely lower your score, instead, just wait the year and let it fall off.  Credit works in age of debt as well as amount.  

I took a course on credit and how it works, also credit karma has been recommended as a great way to monitor your credit by the credit bureaus since before credit karma was even a big deal.  ",2016-05-22 01:07:39+00:00,d3epsh5,1.0,t3_4kg5yx,4292.0,breakingmom

You are not.  You are a good person, with good goals and a plan to make yourself better.  That doesn't make you selfish or controlling.  Dominance is not a fault!  Don't let him convince you that it is.   Sharing your life experiences with friends is not a fault.  It makes you an open person who trusts people to like you regardless of what you have been through or how fucked up your family is.

You will leave, and you will follow your plan and you will make a great life for you and your daughter.

I deserved a man who desired me not because I was super skinny or chubby or extremely overweight, but because it was me he desired, not some preferred version of me. 

My husband would NEVER tell me that my body grosses him out.  Christ thats just not cool under any circumstances.

My 9 year old has been on countless vacations with his father and I would NEVER tell him that he had to take my kids with him. 

So, I see you are getting a lot of hostile responses. You seem to be blaming this on the fact that others do not have kids, so here advice from someone who does have kids, and only some of the time, as well and I know how hard it is to have to be the bad guy and make your kid sad. 

You tell your exwife no.  You take your son on the trip.  Yes, your son is sulking now, but knowing 8 year old kids, he will be happy once he goes on the trip, and will enjoy the trip.  He may even be sad afterwards and say that he missed his brother being there and so on. You just keep saying ""Yeah buddy, I know, its sad that we couldn't take him, but we can still have a good time""  All normal responses.  But, he will get over it in time, life is long, and problems get bigger, he will be disappointed a lot, specially if he has a mom who will make him feel guilty for things.  It's your job to do what YOU think is best.  There is no court that will make you take her child on vacation. 

You have a responsibility as his parent to explain the situation to him, and you might be the bad guy, hell you already said he sees you as the bad guy... That will happen a ton of times in the future.  But then you be the one who took him to Disneyland, so.   

Tell your son that you are sorry that his little brother can not come, and that you are sad about it too.  Tell him that you will allow him to pick out a special gift to bring back for him. 

It would be unfair to cancel the trip, for you and your son.  ",2016-05-19 18:16:29+00:00,d3bwd2p,1.0,t3_4k3ebu,5381.0,relationships

Jams and jellys are also acidic enough for water bath canning with approved recipes.  The canning sub is pretty good for recipes and canning know how. 

Pressure canning is for low acid foods but I do not trust myself to that method yet and its a bit more pricier to set up.

I would find one who does monitored cycles, or definitely ask for them.

What clomid is going to do, hopefully if it works for you, is create many follicles that will hopefully contain eggs.    My RE did an ultrasound to measure the follicles to see if they were ready, and I was given a shot to start ovulation, which releases the eggs, then I was instructed to have sex for the next 6.  

I believe wholeheartedly in monitored cycles, because you are only allowed to take clomid a limited number of times, you cant just keep taking it.

It IS going to be HARDER than you ever expected. But remind yourself that it is SUPPOSED to be that way.  That the super duper hard stuff is only a couple of weeks.  You will get into it sooner than you think. 

You WILL think that you made the biggest mistake of your life... but keep reminding yourself that feeling that way is NORMAL and it has happened to all of us. 

You WILL CRY, most likely louder and harder than the baby does, a few times in the first couple of weeks...  You will probably do this somewhere on the floor in the corner of one of the rooms of your house.  Your husband will not know what to do... and here is my advice to him, given by one of the best L&amp;D Nurses ever... ""At some point, I promise you, she is going to start crying... At that point, you need to take the baby from her, and tell her to go lie down and get some rest""  Trust me on this one. Show him this post if you must.. 

A lot of first time moms say they take their babies to the bathroom with them... seriously, don't torture yourself.  Put the kid down and go pee... a little crying isn't going to kill him. 

Babies are so good at knowing when you are hungry and plan on eating... then they get hungry too... If you plan on nursing do yourself a favor... Get some kind of side table you can set up next to whatever chair you are nursing in.  Cut up all your food before sitting down... put the plate of food on this side table, attach baby to boob, set baby on some kind of boppy, and proceed to eat with your free hand. 

First and foremost, breathe... don't be to hard on yourself if something doesn't go the way you planned.  Dont blame yourself if the baby gets a rash or a cold, their immune systems are shit.  Don't be afraid to ask for help, and don't feel bad if you have to demand it from your husband with threat of castration.  

And when you have a baby who wont stop fussing, you have spit up in your hair and you smell like the cutting room floor of a butcher shop (dont ask, you'll see) we bromo's are always here to listen.

I have a few tactics. 

I have a dry erase board in the kitchen.  If he does not do his chores, he gets stuff taken away, and when I say ""does not do his chores"" that also includes, doing chores, but doing them badly.   He has three things that he loves.  His computer, his PS4 and his ipod.  So for example... if he doesn't put the dishes away or clean up his room he loses his fun stuff in stages.  SO, say he fucked up today. 

He would get all of those three things taken away and the dates and Items are written on the board. 

Ipod lost until  May 18th

PS4 Lost until May 20th

Computer lost until May 22nd.

If he screws up again within that time things get pushed back in opposite order.   SO the first thing to get pushed would be the computer, to the 23rd.  Screw up again, then the PS4 gets pushed to the 21st and so on. 

So thats the first thing. 

The second is hard labor.  

You want to talk back to me? Ok then... go clean the bathroom, scrub the tub and the toilet. 

You want to stomp around and act like an ass... go wash the dishes (we dont have a dishwasher).

If he doesn't do anything wrong during the time his stuff is taken away to be further punished.  He is allowed to have days taken off the amount of time his stuff is take away by asking me if I have housework for him to do.  Usually to get a day taken off the computer it is a whole day of cleaning and chores.  Each FULL day of cleaning only gets one day taken off of ONE item, it does not push back the day for all three.

I was like you at the beginning.  I got mad at all the stupid shit he pulled, the laziness, the stupid shit with the fucking school calendar, the lunches.. .its all oh so familiar.  The difference is he pays me child support. 

So, first word of advice.  Get your name taken off that account.  You can still deposit his spousal support into it without being on it.  You can totally do that without closing it.  There is absolutely no reason that after 1.5 years you should be paying for his financial mistakes.  My child support is direct deposited from my exhusband work, his name is nowhere near my account. 
 
Now the kids stuff.  How old are the kids?  Mine is 10 and he knows that permission slips and stuff like that have to come to me, because dad will not fill them out.  His dad will take them, not look at them, and throw them away.  He will go so far as leaving them at school and bringing them home only on the days he comes home to my house and not his. Smart kid. 

Sad lunches.  I make sure that I keep cash on my sons lunch account so that when dad gives him something gross or cheap he has the option of getting something that he will actually eat. 

Basically I had to let go. Stay out of his shit completely, do my best at my house and pick up any slack for the kids sake.  It becomes less of a pain in the ass when you get used to it.  Is it fair? No.  But it makes your kids life easier. 

Sorry your ex is an ass. But there is an end to custody shit... its not forever and thats what gets me through. 

Edit.. after thinking about this I did want to mention this... NSF fees on your bank account don't affect your credit score.  The only time that will effect your credit score is if the account goes into the negative long enough for the bank to close the account on you for inactivity, then if you don't pay the balance due, they can send it to collections.   What it CAN effect however, is your ability to open a checking account in the future, because it can be considered account abuse.  ",2016-05-12 20:22:18+00:00,d3359dp,1.0,t3_4j2klv,1066.0,breakingmom

Tickle his belly a little and get in his face and blow raspberries to make him giggle.  Take diaper off and change it quickly while making silly faces at him.

I had so many tests done, and no one ever did anything about it and I was a kid and what could I do?  So I stopped complaining about it and just living through it.  Its really amazing what a person can get used to.    But after I had my first kid and discovered what life could be like without them was when I decided that I was going to do something about it. 

Its worth it. Now when I get a migraine its nice to know that I can take an imitrex and wait 30 minutes and it will be gone... instead of dealing with it for 3 or 4 days like I used to. ",2016-05-11 13:54:04+00:00,d31a29s,3.0,t1_d319tkv,390.0,breakingmom

1800,"So not similar, but maybe?

I have had three children.  My first two I had epidurals, the first was 26 hours of labor and the second was 46 hours.  I am so pro epidural its not even funny... with my last child it just solidified my decision to have epidurals the first time.  Because I had a super quick 0-10 dilation in 3 hours and it fucking hurt like hell and fuck that shit, epidural 100%.   Don't feel bad about that.  Birth hurts, like seriously hurts.  Why not get pain relief when it is available?  Especially after 15 hours... that is a win in my book. 

The breastfeeding... now, I have had chronic migraines since I was 4 years old.  Migraines do NOT fuck around.  They effect your life in such a negative way, that I personally don't think medication is an OPTION at that point, its a necessity.  

When I had my first I failed breastfeeding because I didn't know shit about supply and demand.  I thought that once the milk came in that I was good to go, and I could pump and feed out in public and not pump during those times and my milk supply would be A-OK... boy was I an idiot.  With my second I was determined and I was really great at it.. My son was thriving and he was a great latcher and a great feeder.  Then... at 4 months PP when everything was going great... I got a surprise pregnancy and my milk supply dropped to nothing.   I was devastated. It was going so great!  I was doing what I was so determined to do!    It wasn't fair! My poor baby wasn't getting what I had promised him.  But you know what... dude is fine. Formula fed from 6 months.  He is a crazy, healthy, mischievous mess.   

When I had my 3rd, I thought that I could make up for both of my breastfeeding failures with him.  But he was a shitty latcher and a weak sucker... milk supply dropped super early because he was so lazy.  Switched to formula at 3 months... dude is 9 months now an totally cool..

I think everyone that has ever had to quit breastfeeding for whatever the reason has had super guilt.  It sucks and you feel like shit.  But you also need to take care of yourself, and 8 months is a good run!  ",2016-05-11 13:42:28+00:00,d319mnt,1.0,t3_4iuwep,761.0,breakingmom

That is no way to live seriously.   I am now almost 36, remarried, two more kids and fine.  Divorcing that guy was the best decision I have ever made. 

My advice to you, don't let emotion cloud your judgement when it comes to the divorce.  They make it a legal process for a reason.  Get your custody agreement and child support settled first, like once you decide to get a divorce, you can get a temporary agreement pretty quickly, it just says how everything will work before everything is final.  Don't trust the other person to do the right thing, and follow through with stuff.  Even the most amicable of divorce intentions can go bad overnight.

He wakes up at midnight, and comes into the livingroom, tells me he doesn't feel good and promptly throws up.  Fever check and its at 104.5.  I took him to the ER, where the ER doc said he had seen three other kids the same age with the same thing that night. An hour and a chest xray later and he ended up having pneumonia. 

With my middle child it was last year, he was feeling cranky and hot.  I took his temp at every diaper change rectally.  First time it was around 102.  Second time 104.  Tylenol wouldn't touch it.  Last temp check it came up 105.3... ok ER time.  We go to the ER and they check his temp and its at 104.9.  They give him motrin and an hour later its down to 102 and they send us home with a possible roseola diagnosis.  

Fever breaks overnight and the next day at around noon he was covered head to toe in a nice roseola rash!

Ok so a few tips from me.  

Bring a bunch of different toys, stuff that isn't big, don't give them all at once, rotate them out.   

Bring snacks, good ones too.  Like treat kind of snacks.  Our older baby is a little older than yours so old enough to chew reliably on his own, and we bring fruit gummy snacks, that is our bribe food.  Whatever is the favorite snack, bring it.   Pack a small cooler if you want to bring fruits, we usually only do a small lunch box sized one and are gone for 4-6 hours at a time.  Bring more food and drink than you will think you need, at least double, just in case. 

Listen to music that you enjoy, that has a sweet melody.  My son likes Death Cab for Cutie and Mumford and Sons.  Anything faster or slower gets on his nerves, but pick what works for him. 

With any luck you will get a few naps out of him.  But be prepared to stop like halfway somewhere you can get out of the car for at least a half an hour, and eat something at that point so the stop seems like it was for a purpose other than just walking around.  

Bring an extra change of clothes, paper towels, clorox wipes and a plastic bag in case of unexpected car sickness.

For the last two years I have not been medicated because I just got really tired of it.  Nothing seems to help, birth control regulated my period but caused a ton of other issues, I switched at least 10 different kinds looking for one that made me feel better with the least amount of side effects. Metformin made me shit myself on a regular basis, but it gave me babies so that was worth it, I was on the for 5 years total.  Spironolactone cleared up my acne and made my facial hair thinner but that was about it for symptom relief. 

I am just tired of it honestly, and the fatigue is always dismissed as not caused by PCOS. Last time I had tests done by an endo they tested everything and it all came back nothing but obvious PCOS.

Through amazon this month I got 12 of the Bounty Huge rolls for $22.50 because they had a $2 coupon. Thats $1.87 a roll, even without the coupon its $24.50 which is $2.04 a roll, if you bought he same deal through Walmart it would be $33.54 or 2.80 a roll!  

With the toilet paper I buy Quilted Northern Ultra Soft and Strong, because PP hemorrhoids that I will probably have for the rest of my life warrants quality toilet paper.  $21.25 for 48 double rolls, thats $0.44 a roll. Walmart has it for $11.91 for 24, that's $0.50 a roll. Thats not such a huge savings as the diapers or paper towels but its better than nothing! 

I also get other stuff that may be the same price in stores, like tampons and garbage bags.  If you have 5 items per shipment (different items, not say, 5 of the same item) you get 15% off instead of the 5% you get with less items.  So I get a box of tampons, and a box of trash bags every other month, on the months I dont buy the paper towels and toilet paper. 

It takes a lot of time a research to get the best deals, you can change your orders or cancel items or orders whenever you want if the prices change or say, you found your paper towels somewhere else on a super sale or had a physical paper coupon this month. It offers a lot of leeway.

2113,"Our income sounds familiar.  I only have $150 for groceries until the 15th, and $40 for gas.  My husband makes less than $1000 over the cut off for any kind of financial assistance. These are the things that I do, they may not help you but they might!  I am feeding a family of 5, one who is still on 32oz of formula a day.  

So, I found a butcher in my area who has 'truck sales' once a month.  Shit is CHEAP! I buy all my meat for the month in one go, usually 10lbs of ground beef, 20lbs of boneless chicken breasts, and maybe a pork butt that I can cut in half and make two crock pot meals out of.  I portion everything smaller than I usually get it in the grocery store, because serving sizes end up being more along the lines of what you are supposed to have. Usually costs me about $75 in meat for the whole month, and I always have extra at the end of the month that can carry over if its needed.  At this point in the month I still have a freezer full of meat, so I don't have to get that on my grocery trip. 

I also found a produce market in my area.  The thing about this is that it is a little more expensive than the grocery store, but the produce is more often than not, local, so its super fresh and lasts in the refrigerator much longer.  As an example, I buy zucchini from the grocery store and it goes bad in about 5 days, from the produce market, usually 2 weeks.  I end up wasting a LOT less this way, saving us money in the long run. Usually spend about $50 per trip, which I make twice a month. 

I buy target brand formula. You might not be able to do this, depending on what kind of formula you are buying or your kid will drink, but its the exact same as similac. I know they have a target brand equivalent of almost all the major formula brands.  A large tub lasts us a week, and I get it for $23.  

I only cook meals that are large enough to feed my family with proper serving sizes, or maybe a tiny bit larger, no seconds, no leftovers.  If my husband needs food for work I make him a big pot of soup, separate it out and he takes that, sometimes I make two pots in smaller quantities and he has two choices for lunch that week.  Kale sausage and broccoli cheddar are favorites, both super cheap and easy to make. 

So this week, $50 of my grocery bill is going to the produce market and $100 at the regular grocery store. 

I also do amazon ""subscribe and save"" for diapers and wipes.  You have to buy in huge quantities, but if you plan ahead it works out as cheaper in the long run.  Example: We use Huggies Little Movers diapers for BOTH kids in two different sizes.  We get the Size 4 and Size 6.  Size 4 in a box of 152 from walmart is $46, but its $36 from amazon with the subscription.  I get paper towels and toilet paper this way as well.  It took a lot of researching to find the products that are worth it, but diapers was one of the big ones. 

All of this saves me on average about $250 a month. Which doesn't seem like much, but when your budget is super tight it makes a huge difference.

2124,"I wake up at 5:30 with the 8 month old and head downstairs as quickly as I can trying not to wake the 21 month old.  

Change diaper, make bottle. Sit him in his rock and play with his bottle and put on the news. Watch the news for an hour alone. 

10 year old wakes at 6am, comes downstairs and sighs in disappointment that I am up and he cant use the PS4 because the tv is occupied.  He goes back upstairs. 

6:30, 21 month old wakes up and husband brings him downstairs, he changes his diaper while the the kid screams because he hates his diaper changed.  Husband puts him down and goes into the kitchen to get him a sippy cup of milk, where the kid does one of two things, he either comes over and bothers his baby brother or screams over the gate to the kitchen because dad is taking too long getting that milk ready. 

7:00, I insist that the 10 year old come downstairs and eat breakfast and get ready for school.  My husband gets ready for work, and one of us gets enough energy up to make a pot of coffee. 

8:00, 10 year old leaves for the bus.  Depending on what day it is, husband either goes upstairs to work, or leaves for work.  

8:30, breakfast. I give the toddler his food in his high chair and feed the baby his fruit/cereal and then give him a bottle. 

After breakfast we watch Cars. Infant falls asleep and toddler makes a mess while I contemplate cleaning the kitchen. 

10:30 toddler goes down for first nap. At this point you can pretty much guarantee that the baby is up, so all opportunity for me to take a shower today has been shot to hell. 

Pick up the kitchen as much as I can, pick up the toy mess in the livingroom/playroom. Reddit for a little while, pay bills, make phone calls that need to be made, etc. 

12:30 toddler wakes up and wants lunch.  Feed the toddler his lunch and purees and bottle for baby.  Baby will now fall asleep again and the toddler will again make a mess. Kitchen is now a bomb from lunch.  Lunch food and crayons all over the floor under the high chair. 

1:30, put baby on the floor and watch closely so the toddler doesn't try to trample him. Kid needs to learn to move, cant keep him in a rock and play forever! Proceed to repeatedly tell the toddler ""GET OFF YOUR BROTHER!""  Look away for a minute and the toddler is hammering on the babys head with a wooden fire truck, baby starts screaming bloody murder.  Scoop up baby. Floor time is over for today! Assess injuries. 

3pm, 10 year old comes home from school.  Repeatedly remind him to do his chores. Over and over until they are done.  Put toddler down for his second nap, put baby in swing to try to force another nap so I can finally take a shower.  Pick up livingroom again, decide if you should do some of the huge pile of dirty dishes or take a shower, only enough hot water for one.  

4:30 Toddler and baby both wake up. Feed baby bottle, give toddler snack and try to plan dinner. Fail. 

5:30 insist that 10 year old watches babies because dinner has got to get done somehow and that toddler is going to lose his shit soon because he is hungry.  

6:00 husband comes home from work, dinner should have been ready by now but its not.  Rush cook something, clean up cooking mess and set the table for dinner after trying to get the 10 year old to do it in under 45 minutes and giving up and doing it myself. 

6:30 Dinner. Everyone sits down to dinner, more food gets added to the floor. Toddler barely eats, baby whines the entire time so we have to all talk over it.  

7:00 Bath time for the toddler which husband does, while the 10 year old does his after dinner chores of clearing and washing the kitchen table. I feed baby purees and bottle. 

7:30 both baby and toddler are put down for bed, most often than not they both go to be without complaint.  10 year old repeatedly asks to use the PS4, even though his chores for the day are only half done and he still hasn't done his homework. Fight about that, he ends up in tears at his desk doing his homework

9:00 10 year old goes to bed, husband and I do a half assed job cleaning up a little bit, then sit on the couch, either I am on my computer or crocheting, he is on the PS4 or his tablet, he falls asleep in the middle of a video game at around 9:15 and starts to snore.

10:30 I insist he goes to bed because his loud snoring is making me insane and I would like to watch some TV if he is going to be asleep. 

11:00 go to bed, lie in between snoring 8 month old and snoring husband. Get mad, get about 4 hours of sleep.... 

5:30, baby wakes up.... repeat...repeat...repeat.

When stuff like this happens its you vs them. Shut it down BEFORE you lose your temper, because thats not fair to you, you dont need that stress. Hold your ground!

Like if you guys are playing a game and he fake punches you once, he gets a warning. ""Do NOT do that again, or you will not be allowed to play the game anymore""  Notice I said ""you will not be allowed"" not ""we will not play anymore""  I find this is more effective, why? Because the he will see that just because you have to punish him, does not mean you have to punish yourself.  So, if it happens again.  ""OK, I told you not to do that, so now you cant play anymore""  Take his controller away.  You can still play and he can go to his room.  There may be a degree of foot stomping, crying and screaming, and thats fine. Ignore it, its just like toddler tantrum, but you have to show no fear.  Play the game if you still feel like it, watch tv, do whatever you want.  Deep breaths, ignore. 

Disclaimer: this might be sanctimonious, but I dunno... but fair warning.. you said it was ok.

I feel like if you let a kid, even a 5 year old kid, do the same thing over and over 10 times and you are not bringing down the hammer earlier than that they know that they can keep pushing and doing it because they know the punishment is well into the future, and not the next time they do it.  Does it work all the time for me? No, kid will sometimes do it a 3rd time even after the punishment is given, at that point I yell, because I fucking said no, and I already punished you for this shit 20 minutes ago and NOW I am letting you play again and you pull the same shit?

2140,"I left my husband when my oldest was 17 months old.  I left and took my kid with me, and I googled around and found the state family law assistance line for my state, gave them a call.  They actually have lawyers that volunteer for this stuff, you still have to pay but it is on par with your income, and you can set up a payment plan.  There is definitely legal help out there, look into it. 

I got a weird schedule as my kid wasn't nursing, he came at me with 50/50, I requested every other weekend for him because my son was attached to me because I was a SAHM.   What happened was something in between that schedule, which was every other weekend and every other Wednesday and Thursday night for him.  I had him the rest of the time. I think 50/50 like one week on one week off is way too much away from the primary caregiver at this age, your lawyer should be able to make a good case for that. Do not agree to anything, do not sign anything, wait until you have legal representation, and get on that NOW. NOW NOW NOW.  Once that happens you will usually get a temporary order, which basically dictates what happens with kids/housing/bills until the final divorce is drawn up.  When doing the final divorce make sure you take into account every single holiday including Halloween and mothers day and fathers day and how long weekend will work, the whole 9.  I realized early in, as my lawyer said is always come in with an offer that is less than what you want (* I mean less than what you WANT HIM TO HAVE), the judge will be more likely to offer a middle ground solution, and your husband might think that those things are a good compromise.  In a way there is a lot of game to it, play it smart, document everything even if shit is going great.  You never know when something weird will come up, or if somewhere in the middle of the process he wants to become vindictive. 

On the very first night that I had to drop my 17 month old off for his first overnight visit with my ex, I dropped him off, drove directly to the liquor store, back to my moms where we were staying, and proceeded to get shit drunk at my moms kitchen table.  BUT, it gets easier over time.  Eventually once your schedule with your ex is in place and you are in a grove you will adjust to your new normal.  You will eventually enjoy the break of when he is gone for the weekend.  You will most likely still miss him, mine is almost 10 now and if I had my way he would be at his dads a lot less, but its definitely ok now.

I do not think having 2 kids has been bad for our marriage.  But I think that says a lot about our marriage, and not whether or not having more kids was a factor in that.  Dude is my best friend.  We have our moments sure, just like any marriage, you cant be with someone for as long as we have and not have issues, thats just the way life is. 

Our marriage is pretty solid, so throwing stresses at it doesn't really phase it.  Our ability to love each other so much that we hate each other at times has shown us that we can get through anything as long as we stay us, we stay S&amp;N.  We make sure that we are a united front.  We are team S&amp;N and that comes first.  Problems within the management team get addressed first and immediately, because when management has a falling out the whole unit suffers.

2148,"Not OP, but my husband isn't a lazy asshole.  I mean, yeah he has his moments of laziness, like this weekend when I asked him to pick up for me and he fucking didn't, but on the whole he does a lot. 

He works full time and usually obscene amounts of overtime.  Sometimes 60-70 hours a week and even some overnights.  (I have 2 under 2, a 21month old and a 8 month old, on top of a 9 year old who is his stepson) He takes the kids immediately after he gets out of work, so that I can make dinner.  If we order out or something he still takes the kids and I sit at the kitchen table on my laptop for a few hours. 

He cleans but not a ton, he does dishes when I ask, its his responsibility to take out the trash and clean the litter box.  When he isn't working diaper duty is 100% his, unless of course one of them is eating or something, two in diapers is like 20 diapers a day sometimes, so he knows I do like 90% of the diaper changes. 

He lets me sleep in on every single day off he has, and on days he works from home if I happen to be up a lot with the 8 month old he will let me sleep in until he has to work.  

If I am having a particularly bad day he will send me to bed, or I will leave the house and he is cool with that, even if he has had a bad day at work.  He sees it as he got away from the people who made his day bad, but the people that made my day bad never go away, so he lets me escape them. 

I would say that if I was to take the hours where we are both 'not working' which I mean as the 8-9 hours he is working. (him working his paying job and me working my non paying SAHM gig) We have that time split evenly between the kids, like I spend just as much time alone doing my own thing as he does during those 5 hours a day when we both have kid duty. 

I feel like without this kind of balance where when we are both 'off' of work that we parent as a team then.  I think that if we didn't do it this way there would be a lot of resentment built up that someone isn't pulling their weight with the kids, which seems like that may be the issue you are having. 

Parenting takes up 100% of your day for mom AND dad.  I feel like I see a lot of women on this sub who's spouses think that parenting takes up 100% of the mom's day, and maybe 5% of theirs.

My kids are pretty decent. I mean that toddler is crazy and basically threw a tantrum for all of Easter, but he was wearing a suit, so that kind of made it less annoying to watch.

I have to convince my husband all the time that our life is pretty good.  He has always been the type to measure happiness with money in the bank and material things, but I grew up without a lot of money so I don't have the same kind of expectations.

Technically you can test a few days, like 3-4, before your missed period and get a positive but you will get the most accurate results after you have a missed period. So according to your 25-30 day schedule I'd say you can test between the 6th and the 11th of April, but you may not get an accurate result until some days afther the 11th.  If you want to test every day, get the dollar store tests, they are the same as expensive ones. 

As far as contraception there are so many options, you just have to research and chose what you are most comfortable with.   My husband had a vasectomy, but before that I used the Nuvaring, and that was after years of successful birth control pill usage.  Some people LOVE IUD's, because of the ease of not having to deal with it, just insert and done.   Some hate them because of the side effects, same as the pill.   And of course there are always condoms!   I would say talk to your GYN about your options, what you are comfortable with, ask how stuff works or google it.

I asked my 7 year old at the time, he couldn't smell it either.  I was walking around the apartment and sniffing trying to find the source.  Like it was strong and it was driving me insane.  I could NOT believe no one else could smell it. 

A SOLID 3 hours later my husband can smell it just a tiny bit.  He is like... uh, I can smell it now, but barely.  I was like dude... I thought I was going insane! So we made the decision to call the fire department.  So first a police officer arrived and went into our place and was like yeah, I smell it but barely.  I should say we were on the bottom floor of a 3 story building. 

SO the fire department comes and they go in and now they are knocking on doors evacuating the building, we are watching this from our car because it was all of 2 degrees outside. 

Turns out they had replaced the boiler that afternoon, right under our apartment. The process had knocked some debris into the chimney and it was now blocked.

I wake up at 6am everyday when the 8 month old who sleeps next to me wakes up.  I go downstairs, change his diaper, pee and make a bottle for him. 

While I am doing that the 21 month old wakes up and my husband brings him down, changes his diaper and gets him a sippy cup of milk. 

I sit on the couch and watch the morning news while my husband gets ready for work and my 9 year old fights me on his morning routine of getting ready for school. 

Either my husband leaves for work or goes upstairs to work from home, kid goes to school. 

8:30 am, the two kids get breakfast.  I spoon feed the 8 month old still and when thats done he gets a bottle and I clean up the kitchen while the 21 month old finishes eating, and then he gets crayons and paper.  He fucking loves crayons. 

So then we all go into the livingroom and I reddit while the toddler plays and the baby jumps in his jumparoo.  I will pick up the livingroom like 5 times and I will go down to the basement and put laundry in. 

At 11:30 both kids go down for a nap, the toddler usually sleeps for 2 hours, the baby 1 hour.  We then have lunch, which pretty much goes the same as breakfast.  We hang out and watch Cars... again.  We watch cars everyday, my toddler calls it Kapow! and asks for him by name. 

I pick up the living room again and plan dinner in my head.  Son comes home from school and watches the babies while I do the days dishes and maybe take a shower and start preparing dinner so I have less to do when the time comes. 

Then I make dinner.  Husband comes home or downstairs depending on what day of the week it is.  Then we eat dinner.  Oldest kid cleans up table, husband does dishes.  Husband does bed time with the toddler and I put the baby down.

On to recovery, make sure he doesn't do anything too soon.  I have heard so many dudes, including my husband say ""I didn't rest long enough and I paid for it"" So, I would say Monday-Tuesday, he may be able to walk around the house and stuff, but no lifting anything or keeping on his feet too long.

They just smooshed it around the high chair tray or ignored it.  But they wanted to eat so bad, lunging at food, crying when we ate and they couldn't. 

My youngest is 8 months now and does not have his pincer grasp going on, not even a little tiny bit.  My kids have all been about 2-3 months behind on the milestones, its no big deal. 

So after some failed baby led things we went to purees.  I make them myself so they aren't the watery version you get in jars, they have some bulk to them, and I will even mix them with cereals to make them thicker.  I feel like that way they get used to swallowing texture and not watery stage one foods, but thats a personal theory about my own kids.  

I'd say give it a shot, see what works, if you are feeling like its not working then switch it up and try something else.  I did purees for a few months with my first and second, like 2 or 3 I think? And then I started introducing little chunks of banana and strawberries and by then it only took them about 2 weeks to get that down and purees went away completely.

I felt a real need to get into a grove that I was comfortable with and having him home that long felt like he was getting in my way.  We have family near by but none that actually give a shit enough to help, I have been on my own every day since my husband went back to work. 

Patience yes.  This is a huge one.  They are now 20 months and 7 months old and some days I will put the toddler in the pen with some toys, the infant in the swing and go sit at the kitchen table sipping coffee browsing some reddit, as long as they are occupied and quiet I can take a breather.  Also taking deep breaths and ignoring the screaming is something you have to do from time to time. 

Right now the pen is primarily used so the baby can have floor time to learn how to roll and crawl without the threat of the 20 month old.  He has no idea that babies cant be stepped on or leaned on, and no you cant hit them in the head with trucks or shove toys down their throats.

2231,"My two youngest are 13 months apart almost to the day. July 23rd and August 24th.  

So, its hard at the beginning, and I hope for the first few weeks you have some help with the toddler while you are caring for the infant.  We were super lucky in that my husband could spend some time home.  Its hard to recover, and cluster feed and so one with a toddler that age wandering around. 

Ok so about the guilty feelings, you will be surprised, its easy to love a new child.  Seriously.  I get this question a lot, when it comes to loving more than one kid and I always say the same thing.  Look at it this way, when your first kid is born you are handed a glass, in that glass is love, filled up to the top.  Now, when you have a second or third child, you are not handed an empty cup and you have to split the original one into two separate half cups of love.  When your second child is born you are handed another completely full cup.  There is no limit on love. 

The hardest thing that I have dealt with is things like... leaving baby number 2 to cry or fuss longer than you would have with your first.  Because well, the toddler has to eat, and I cant very well make him wait 45 minutes for lunch that I am now in the middle of making just because the baby is fussing.  You finish making the sandwich and THEN go get the baby.  

There is a LOT of letting go, there will be times when the toddler is screaming and the baby is crying and you are standing in the kitchen making a bottle and you cant please everyone, so you let them whine and cry and you finish making that bottle on your own time.  A little crying never hurt anyone. 

I suggest you get a baby pen, something like[this](http://www.target.com/p/north-states-superyard-colorplay/-/A-13971309?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;CPNG=PLA_Baby%2BShopping&amp;adgroup=SC_Baby&amp;LID=700000001170770pgs&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;location=1021925&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwq6m3BRCP7IfMq6Oo9gESJACRc0bNYm2ZhOs7zYFotE-I2zNwdpT2LpeH1DG1NmtXyia2FRoCvunw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) so you have a place to put the toddler when you are breastfeeding and cant get out of the chair.  Put some toys in there and sometimes you will get cried at over the top but sometimes he will play nice while you feed the baby. 

Some days your husband will come home and you will toss the baby at him and head to walmart and browse every section in that place, hardware has never been more interesting.  Trust me. You will need that time away.

This town was made for families.  I love having kids here, lots of parks and a real sense of community.   There are activities all the time for kids at our community center and in our picturesque downtown, every single small town parade is just the fire truck and little league teams, its very ""New England"" post card.   I read the police facebook and they list the days activities, which usually read ""Gave an old lady a ride to the grocery store, speeding ticket issued on main street, report of a loose dog on elm street"" 

We are about an hour away from Boston, thats really nice for taking the kids to the New England Aquarium or any of the other amazing museums in Boston and the surrounding towns.  

I would never leave, even though it snows and shit.  I am a lifer. 

Edit to add a few things:  We have a ton of things in our tiny downtown that are new because it is growing.  We have a very awesome Thai restaurant, that is basically Thai home cooking its amazing.  We have a very respectable sushi place, a micro brewery, we have pizza shops and there are some great restaurants, also is a few really great bars that have live music.

I cant leave them alone together or the big one tries to murder the little one.. not on purpose, but he doesn't understand that you cant try to shove something down the babies throat and have him survive it, and no you can definitely not lay on top of him or hit him with a truck. 

My husband understand that being with the kids from 9-5 is part my job.  Taking care of the bills and the food and the and doing the ""business"" of being adults is the rest of my job.  He knows that him working does not discount the fact that he is a parent, and he also understand that the time he gets a break from the kids, is after they go to bed... the same time I get my break from the kids. 

Equal partnership.  Housework and childcare (after 6pm and on weekend) are our shared responsibilities, just because he works 40 hours a week doesn't mean its my job to work 168 hours a week.

I grocery shop every 2 weeks instead of every week.  When I was shopping every week I was paying $175 a week for a family of 4 (there are 5 of us, but the 7 month old doesn't eat much!) and now I pay $200-$225 every other week. Saves me about $300 a month.  This includes meat and fresh vegetables, because we have a butcher shop near us that has a 'truck load' sale once a month, where I buy all my meat for the whole month.  There is a fresh produce market near me as well, and although its a bit more expensive, its fresher than the grocery store and tends to last much longer in the fridge so I dont end up throwing any of it away, which is basically throwing away money.   

With the butcher shop I purchase, for example, 20lbs of boneless chicken breasts.  It comes in a giant plastic bag, so what I do is I separate it out and vacuum seal the portions for each meal with my foodsaver and then freeze them.   I find that by doing it this way, we are eating proper portions of meat, instead of the huge portions you get in a standard chicken package from the grocery store, which is a waste.  I also tend to cook enough food for one serving per person.  We are not starving, we are all satisfied, but this pretty much guarantees none of us are over eating. 

The following is cut from a post a few weeks back and has some of my quick recipes. 

**Quick stir fry:**

I usually have the chicken cut up into cubes before hand, so I just pull it out and throw it in a pan with some oil, brown that. (you can use almost any meat, its pretty awesome with kielbasa)

Throw in a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables. Dump in some soy sauce, garlic and a few tablespoons of brown sugar. And like a 1/4 cup of water. IF you like a thick sauce, throw a tablespoon of cornstarch into like 4 tablespoons of water and throw that in at the very end while its boiling.

If you put the rice on before you started all that it will be done right in time for you to throw this over the top.

**Baked Mac and Cheese** (like my grandma used to make):

Throw in a pot of boiling water a whole box of elbows. While that is cooking grate 2 8oz blocks of mild cheddar cheese.

When the mac is done, in a baking dish layer the elbows, a layer of cheese, a layer of elbows, with a layer of cheese on top. Sprinkle on some bread crumbs, cook in 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. Totally done. 

**Mini chicken pot pies.**

Get a container of those grands biscuits, roll each one out into like an 8 inch round, and line a muffin tin. (preheat oven according to biscuit directions)

In a sauce pan, throw in a can of chicken, a can of cream of chicken soup with added water per the can, and a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. Just heat that through until the soup has all mixed together.

Add that mixture to the muffin tin and fold each one over, cook according to the directions on the biscuit, usually 15-20 minutes.

You can do the pot pies like Pizza too, you just have to add jar sauce, cheese and peperoni, or any other pizza topping you prefer and bake that, its even quicker than the chicken pot pie. Even quicker is if you use canned beef stew... those ones are really good.

**American chop suey:**

Put on a pot of water to boil, add whatever shape pasta you want.

In a large saucepan throw in a pound of ground beef a chopped onion and half a chopped green bell pepper. Brown.

Add three cans of tomato soup, and about 2 cans of water.

Add garlic, oregano, parsley, basil, salt and pepper and about a 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.

Add the cooked pasta to the tomato soup mixture and just heat through. For some reason when this is served its like boiling lava. Let it cool... seriously.

Thats just a few, I can probably dig into my brain for others, but this is all I can think of at this moment.

**Oh quesadillas!**

Two tortillas and anything you want put in between with a bunch of cheese! You can do chicken and salsa, you can do ham and cheese! You can do spinach and feta and chicken! You can do pizza! These are the quickest.

Leaving and taking your kid home to NJ would be something that your husband has to agree to or a court would need to order.  If you just up and left that could be considered kidnapping. I dont know about your state, but in my state you are not allowed to move to another state unless you have extenuating circumstances that would provide a better life, like a high paying job, or a new spouse with a high paying job.  You as the one who moved are likely to be the one responsible for paying the kids way (or your ex's) form CA to NJ for visitations as well.  You can usually find the info you need online about that stuff, and absolutely make sure you have an attorney and a court ordered visitation agreement.   You can promise each other to be as amicable as possible and sometimes it is like that in the beginning, but things can get ugly real quick.

The 19 month old thinks that only an awake baby is a fun baby, so we went through a stage at 2 months where the tiny one was always cranky because he couldn't get any damn sleep.  We ended up putting a baby swing inside a baby pen, that way we could throw the swings music on and that would distract from the screeching and the toddler couldn't get to him to poke at him.  

At this point 75% of the time I can get them to nap at the same time so its easier, but it took a while of training to get to that point.  The other 25% of the time are counted as my bad days and thats when my husband knows to help out more when he gets home. 

I found that at this point 6 months in it has become easier to keep a routine, not to say that it doesn't get completely blown a lot of the time, I just count it at a win if I can get the routine followed 4-5 days out of the week.  

The baby sleeps in a pack and play in our room still because no way he can sleep in with is brother yet.  We also had a pack and play set up in the livingroom for quiet day naps and so that the baby had a place to play independently, because with a toddler around, the floor is pretty much a no go, considering he will always try to kill the baby.

I guess my grandmother never liked my dad, and told my mom that he was cheating on her (he was... though, so at least thats true)  So my grandmother hired a lawyer, and then put deep pressure on my mom to follow through.  We were living in a 2 family house, my grandmother lived upstairs and owned the house so its not like my mom would have been homeless with three kids. 

So out of sheer stubbornness they both decided not to talk it out or try to work on it and they were just at each others throats until the divorce was final.  I was 9, my brother 10 and my sister 13.  

Before the divorce?  Family dinners, family vacations, watching tv together in the livingroom.  It was all very sitcom.  And then immediately after the divorce... nothing.. no family dinners, no family vacations because my mom couldn't afford it, we all barely spoke anymore.  It was all super sad. I am sure that had to do with our ages too, but I know a lot of it had to do with my moms severely broken heart. Then, very shortly after the separation my grandmother died, she had ovarian cancer, and my two uncles sold the house right out from under my mother.  She fell into a serious depression, and she had to so some serious self care. And even though we were taken care of, and she loved us, she wasn't home much.   I had to grow up pretty quickly because I was primarily on my own. My mom worked 2 sometimes 3 jobs, and she spent a lot of her free time at the gym working out because she needed it for her depression. 

She was a good mom, I cant deny it, she is the 'original broken mom' in my world.  I am amazed at what she was able to accomplish with the hand she was given.  Single mom of 3 teenagers? Working all the time, watching her kids grow up from a distance. So sad.

2376,"**Quick stir fry:**

I usually have the chicken cut up into cubes before hand, so I just pull it out and throw it in a pan with some oil, brown that. (you can use almost any meat, its pretty awesome with kielbasa)

Throw in a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables. 
Dump in some soy sauce, garlic and a few tablespoons of brown sugar.  And like a 1/4 cup of water. IF you like a thick sauce, throw a tablespoon of cornstarch into like 4 tablespoons of water and throw that in at the very end while its boiling. 

If you put the rice on before you started all that it will be done right in time for you to throw this over the top.  


**Baked Mac and Cheese** (like my grandma used to make)

Throw in a pot of boiling water a whole box of elbows.  While that is cooking grate 2 8oz blocks of mild cheddar cheese. 

When the mac is done in a baking dish layer the elbows, a layer of cheese, a layer of elbows, with a layer of cheese on top.  Sprinkle on some bread crumbs, cook in 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Totally done. 

**Mini chicken pot pies.** 

Get a container of those grands biscuits, roll each one out into like an 8 inch round, and line a muffin tin. (preheat oven according to biscuit directions)

In a sauce pan, throw in a can of chicken, a can of cream of chicken soup with added water per the can, and a bag of frozen mixed vegetables.  Just heat that through until the soup has all mixed together. 

Add that mixture to the muffin tin and fold each one over, cook according to the directions on the biscuit, usually 15-20 minutes. 

You can do the pot pies like Pizza too, you just have to add jar sauce, cheese and peperoni, or any other pizza topping you prefer and bake that, its even quicker than the pot pie.  Even quicker is if you use canned beef stew... those ones are really good.  

**American chop suey:**

Put on a pot of water to boil, add whatever shape pasta you want.

In a large saucepan throw in a pound of ground beef a chopped onion and half a chopped green bell pepper.  Brown.

Add three cans of tomato soup, and about 2 cans of water.  

Add garlic, oregano, parsley, basil, salt and pepper and about a 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.   Add the cooked pasta to the tomato soup mixture and just heat through.  For some reason when this is served its like boiling lava.  Let it cool... seriously.  

Thats just a few, I can probably dig into my brain for others, but this is all I can think of at this moment. 

Oh quesadillas!

Two tortillas and anything you want put in between with a bunch of cheese! You can do chicken and salsa, you can do ham and cheese! You can do spinach and feta and chicken! You can do pizza!  These are the quickest. ",2016-03-01 00:11:21+00:00,d0iq6lo,3.0,t1_d0ip696,1716.0,breakingmom

Like I have bags of chicken cut up into cutlets for grilling (already in a marinade) or cut into cubes for things like stir fry, all in the freezer, I just have to take it out of the freezer and into the fridge the night before and about 15 minutes is saved by not having to prepare the meat for cooking.

2381,"Some days it feels like all I am doing is making and cleaning up food.  But I take a lot of short cuts. 

I will make breakfast in the morning for the 19 month old and feed the little one homemade babyfood that I have frozen.  I will usually make french toast because its easy, or throw some waffles in the toaster.  If I have fruit its a fruit and cheese kind of breakfast because I just cant be bothered to cook some days.  Way less clean up.  

For snacks I do fruit or animal crackers or cheezits or goldfish in a snacktrap.  So easy with no time consumed.  

So lunch I will do a ham and cheese sandwich or PB&amp;J because there is barely any cleanup involved in that one. 

The only meal I spend a lot of time on is dinner, but I used to work until 6 so I can whip out a pretty decent meal in about 20 minutes.  After that dinner dishes are the husbands job. 

So I guess its not too much time at all on a regular day, but if I am short on food that can be prepared quickly and its not shopping day it can take up a lot of time. ",2016-02-29 15:01:03+00:00,d0i2rut,1.0,t3_48ah24,1396.0,breakingmom

He took 4 weeks off of work at the beginning and it was definitely divide and conquer, he took the toddler and me the infant because breastfeeding.  It was a help and a hindrance if I am to be honest... I mean thank god he was there, but it was like ""When you going back to work dude... you're in my way!""

I can promise you it gets better.

Like they worked from 2-4 months but then didn't work from 4-6 months and then when I tried them again at 6 months they worked really well.  It was just that the shape of his body didn't match with the shape of the diapers at that particular age. 

My suggestion for you. Make sure that the rise is snapped to the correct size and then snap the hip snap closer than the top snap.  It makes for a really awkwardly shaped diaper once snapped but you will end up with tighter leg holes and a looser waist size than what can be accomplished with a neatly snapped diaper.   

I hope that makes sense, if not I will add pictures. ",2016-02-21 00:28:24+00:00,d07l5nl,1.0,t3_46siyy,4246.0,clothdiaps

Are they more valued now because they can survive or do they survive because they are more valued?""  

Now a days I think there are so many sanctimonious moms because they didn't feel appreciated enough when they were kids.

2537,"I see this every time there is a comment about stay at home parents on Reddit.  There is always someone that says its so easy they have no idea what is wrong with other people other than laziness.  But I'll tell you this...

When I had one kid I was totally cool with being a SAHM it was fun, it was so easy, BUT my kid was easy! He still is, he is a unicorn I swear.  He didn't touch anything he wasn't supposed to, he made no mess, he didn't cry, and he loved to play by himself. 

Then I worked for 7 years and now I have three kids and it is so hard! There are days where I have to question my own sanity. Sometimes I wonder if I am in a nightmare.  These two kids are difficult.  Would I rather be working? HELL NO! Why? Because I had severe social anxiety, when I have a job and a boss I basically live in a 24/7 panic attack.  Staying home I only have my self to answer to.  

Two days a week my husband works from home and sees me with the kids and he tells me ""you are doing gods work... You are a saint to do this all day!"" 

What I am saying with all this is that, it's different for each stay at home parent, some people have it easy, like i did with my first, because they have easy kids or a spouse that helps out more, some people have grandparents near by and places to drop their kids, some people have daycares even though there is a parent at home full time.  All of these instances fall under ""stay at home parent"". You never hear the whole story, just ""I do it, why can't you?"" even though that person may have 3 day full day daycare, or M/W/F drop offs at grandmas.  You never hear about the temperament of their kids.  

It's like, easy because you can sit your kid down and leave the room to do dishes and they won't break everything, try to climb anything or try to murder their baby brother? Because that's what happens in my house! 

You always here the stay at home moms who have it hard go, ""wow your lucky that it's so easy good for you!"" (To their face at least!) But those parents who have it easy don't usually say ""wow, that sounds tough, your doing great though!""  It's always ""well your not doing it right then.""

Have you had any significant change in your life recently?  My neurologist once told me that any change in your life can trigger migraines.  Even something simple like changing the grocery store you go to.  Especially amongst those of us who get them chronically.

And I got over it about month 7... yeah, it took me that long.  My advice for you, make sure you have help the first couple of weeks home, at least until you dont feel like you've been hit by a truck.  I was lucky in that my husband got a month off, so that was a huge help.  

After that it hasn't been so bad, yeah, its an all day job, there are no breaks, because usually naps do not line up. Some days they are both whiney and by the time my husband gets home from work I am running out on some random errand... like I just HAVE to go to walmart, it can not wait!  

There are definitely days where the big one tries to hurt the little one, not on purpose but just because he doesn't know.  A baby pen for the big one has saved my life so much... set it up fill it with toys, great way to get him out of the way for a while.  Tummy time or play time for the little one happens in the top of a pack and play... if I put him on the floor the big one tries to ""hug"" him, or as I like to call it, smother.. but all the same. 

Make sure your husband knows that you doing shit like bringing him lunch in the middle of the day is a luxury he will no longer have.  It is a pain in the ass to leave the house with both the kids and I ain't doing it to pick up the slack for something he could have easily done in the morning.  Make sure he knows that the amount of parental support you are going to need is going up exponentially, that he will be left alone with 2 babies on a regular basis, because you can not be expected to take care of them by yourself!

And on the good part. They are so cute together.  The big one brings the little one his favorite toys when he is upset and crying, trying to make him feel better.  He says 'baby' and pets his head. and I cant wait until next year when I have two toddlers running around playing with each other.  

The hard part is the first few months, you get yourself into a grove and you stick to it day after day.  

Dont neglect yourself.

Now, what YOU have is probably enough to get him supervised visits only.  Suicide attempts are fucking serious business, an no judge is going to disagree with that, you can even argue that you believe that he would try to hurt himself and your son in one of his attempts.  

Now, he can call the cops and say you are refusing to let him see his kid, but I guarantee the cops will be like ""Well where is the court order for the custody agreement that says she has too.""  Seriously, you are not breaking any laws, you ARE letting him see him, and he has no way to prove otherwise. 

But, just to make yourself feel better.  Document document document, everything he does, keep a journal of things he does when you see him and he is at your house, conversations phone calls the whole 9.

I told him that there are a ton of different belief systems, that some people believe in God and some don't, some believe is other things, and some don't.  I told him the everyone is free to choose whatever they want to believe in, including him.  He told me that he believed in God and I told him, that's great!

If it was something severe like whooping cough or the flu or the worst of all things, the stomach bug, then thats a different thing altogether, but common cold? Not really.

*  He is a great father, he is so into his kids its not even funny.  Every day after work he plays with them, he is that dad that comes out of the bathroom after bath time soaked from head to toe with a huge smile on his face.  

* He was and is a great stepfather to my oldest son, never once did he even doubt that he needed to play a role there and he has stepped way up.

2683,"&gt; I'm going to have help from him from here on out. But I hate the way it's being done.

I am going to start off by saying that I am a happily married woman.  I cant say I was always this way but one of the reasons I am happy is because I finally decided to believe my husband when he says he has no idea what to do.  His brain just doesn't work the way mine does. He doesn't see the mess, he doesn't see me struggling, he just sees things getting done and assumes everything is a-ok.  I have to make sure that I tell him exactly what needs to be done, how when and how much.  I cant expect him to read my mind on what I need done and I am more than happy to tell him what to do if thats what he wants me to do. 

&gt; I want him to feel some remorse for burdening me the last year and especially the last three months. I want him to see all that I have done and really appreciate it.

I understand this feeling so so so much, because my husband is relatively unfeeling when it comes to empathy.  BUT, I can tell you that this type of feeling is only going to harbor more and more resentment on your part when he doesn't or cant deliver.  

The best advice I can offer you is to get him to do what you need him to do, he needs you to tell him what that is specifically.  Its a team effort. All teams need a leader, and on this team it is you.  If you are still telling him what you need and he isn't doing it then you have an even bigger problem, and that is a respect issue.   

I am not going to say that everything in my marriage is perfect, my husband drops the ball all the time even when I tell him specifically what I need done.  What that does is it causes a situation of 'WTF dude, you said you would do what I needed if I told you what that was? Right now I need you to do the damn dishes.""

The judge will usually take into account school systems, and things that benefit the kid, you will have to prove why the new place is a good place, but then it falls on your ex to prove why the move would be detrimental to your kids. 

As for regular custody, make sure that one of you has ""residential"" custody because that dictates the kids school.

And I did say it was only at night so a single feeding a day, it is known that less milk is often produced at night, and since that is already the case, my period has dropped my night production enough to cause a slight problem.  I have been subscribed to this subreddit for over 2 years and I have seen this concern pop up here before as well as in other mom subs, which is how I knew this was an issue with some people and not others.

I do this for a long time because I do not want my overall supply to decrease so I nurse him a ton during this time at night, but it is never enough.  Once he is given a bottle, which is pumped breast milk, he is completely satisfied and happy and the crying stops and the smiling and giggle resumes.  If there was something else medically wrong, the crying would not stop and would continue at other times of day, instead of him being the smiling happy baby that he is.   

I am wondering why you are not recognizing that women have supply drops when they have the period?  Do you think this is something that happen to women on a strictly psychological basis?  I am saying that because you attribute my problem to anxiety, which I do not experience.  It is no coincidence that this has gradually gotten worse up until the last two nights, I have noticed a gradual shift in his eating patterns as the days have gotten closer to my period.  Here is an excerpt from Kellymom:

&gt; Low milk supply associated with menstruation: 
Some women experience a drop in milk supply from ovulation (mid-cycle) until the first day or two of the next menstrual period. A woman’s blood calcium levels gradually decrease during this period of time, and for some women the drop in blood calcium causes a drop in milk supply. 

I did not ask for advice regarding supply, your advice is good for someone with that question. I am not worried about my overall supply, I am confident that everything will be back to normal once my period ends.   My question was for other women who experienced this and I was wondering if it ended up lasting as long as the full period or for just a few days.

No offense but when my baby is screaming hungry, refuses the boob completely for a 2 hour period because he isn't getting enough I refuse to believe that ""the worst thing I can do is supplement"" and I honestly find it insulting for you to say so. 

It is actually true for a lot of women to have a supply drop during their period, there is even a section on it on kellymom and it has to do with low calcium in the blood stream at the time of menstruation.

2897,"My sister had her son when she was 15.  She is 38 now and making upward into 6 figures.  Having a kid young ruins your life only if you let it.   There were times when she was young where her future was questionable, but that is when my mom shut that shit down.  She did not have the option of dumping the kid off on her parents, my mother was a single mom to three teenagers. 

My mother made sure that it was my sister who was responsible for that kid, she made sure that it wasn't her who had to figure out feeding, or getting the kid to his pediatrician, she made my sister do those things.  She made her stay home with the baby, it was not her job to get childcare.  

My mother had to parent a child that had to parent another child, its a hard thing to do.  However, she did also make us all help, one reason was to show us younger siblings that having a baby young was a fucking stupid ass thing to do, and also because my sister needed the help, and we were her family, who else would help her? 

I have on occasion watched those 16 and pregnant shows and I have noticed that these kids are spoiled, OR their parents stop parenting them once they have kids.

I don't work, so at least I don't have to do that, but my husband works 6 sometimes 7 days a week and during that time I take care of our three kids, two of them still babies.  

So we were at the shoe store because since having my last kid none of my shoes fit.  Everywhere I go my feet are killing me and I am on my feet a lot. So I am looking at the clearance shoes trying to decide between two pairs of very ugly sneakers.  I never pay full price but I always want name brand for my feet.  

My husband during this is walking around pushing the double stroller looking at the expensive shoes.  He comes over and says ""Why don't you buy real shoes? Like ones you like?"" Uh, because I don't care what they look like, they just need to be under $40 and fit. And he says ""No... Come here...get these."" And he points to a pair of $60 black and pink new balance sneakers.  ""You deserve to have fucking shoes that fit for Christ sake!"" I started tearing up and he walked away with the fussy babies while I tried on shoes that I actually liked. 

When we left the store I am feeling guilty for buying something for myself, I mean, I am still wearing maternity clothes because I can't manage to justify new clothes for myself and I say as much and he says ""Stop it.  You are the rock in this family.  We would not be where we are or be doing as good as we are without you. It's true""

2920,"ok so it obvously is different for everyone, but I can tell you about my day.   I have a 16 month old and an almost 3 month old...

I wake up every day at 6:30-7  get both kids downstairs, one at a time.  I get the big one his morning milk and put on the news, and I nurse the little one.  

Little one goes down in the swing and then I make the big one breakfast.  While he is eating I put on my pot of coffee and maybe eat breakfast myself.   

I take my coffee and the big on into the livingroom, put on curious george and sit on the couch with my travel mug full of coffee (less dangerous if the kid gets it by chance) and get on reddit.  He plays on the floor and watches george so I can finish my coffee.  

Once I am done with my coffee I will usually sit on the floor with him and play for a while, an hour or so, and then he takes his morning nap at 10-11:30.  So when I put him down for a nap the little one wakes up and nurses.  So I feed him for a half hour and the coo at him for a little bit.  I put him back in the swing or bouncer or rock and play and then I pick up the breakfast dishes and any mess my husband left for me while he was getting ready for work. I usually get shower in here too. 

At 11:30 big baby wakes, I feed him a snack and he plays in his playroom for a while.  I try to fold laundry and then realize that I cant do this with big baby awake because he just pulls it all off the couch and I have to refold it, I give up.  

At 1:00 big baby has lunch.  I feed him his lunch and try to eat some lunch as well.  He usually throws his food around and refuses to eat so I end up having to feed him a yogurt so that he gets something in his system.   He will then have a sippy of milk in the livingroom and I an now nursing little baby.  I watch Grey's Anatomy and sit on the floor with the kid.  He is pretty independent and will play alone but I engage him when he wants to play. He also has a snack at around 2:30.  By 3pm big brother comes home from school (9 years) I make him put the clean dishes away and go get started on his homework.  Big baby goes down for second nap at 3:30-4.  During this time I try to see what kind of dinner I can pull together because I did not plan and everything is fucking frozen.  I decide to order pizza. 

5:15, husband gets out of work.  He gets home at 5:45 and is now in charge of both babies, other than nursing of course, while I get dinner together (if I am cooking that is) for a 6:30 dinner.

7:30 big baby gets a bath by dad and gets put to bed.  Little baby will nurse once more at around 8 and he will be out until at least 2am.  I sit and watch tv or reddit or talk to my husband for a while.  Bed by 10. 

Every day is a variation of that but that but its pretty consistent. Its boring, and routine, but I kinda like it.

Coach runs over with ice, me and my ex husband run for the plate from different sides of the field.  By the time I get there he already has a black eye, and it's already swelling up!  The coach asks how he is.  He says ""I'm ok... I'm going to take the base."" Because they asked him if he wanted a substitute to run for him.  He gets up, brushes himself off and takes his place at first base.   It was a long inning and he was on the field for a long time.. They eventually brought him home and he scored a run.  This was when I found out that my very sensitive son can be tough as nails when he wants to be.  They won that game, and the championship game the next days!  His team had an undefeated season and even now 5 months later he still has a bit of a black eye, the doctor said it will go away eventually and he had a pretty bad hematoma... But damn...

2945,"Jeez..  Your husband would have probably divorced me by now.  I haven't had sex in a year... yes I said A YEAR!  Why a year?  Because sex is extremely painful for me during pregnancy, its just not happening, the few times we did try ended up in tears and who wants sex to end in tears seriously.  My youngest is 11 weeks yesterday, and NO I am still not ready for sex.  Previous pregnancies have shown me that it takes a few months for me to feel comfortable with sex again. 

Am I withholding sex? No.  I am not maliciously withholding sex. Though a lot of people see it that way. Does my husband want to have sex.. you bet your ass he does. Do I? Of course!  But you know what?  My husband understands that there is absolutely nothing to be gained for him, for me or for our relationship by me forcing myself to have sex.  

Not to mention I am exhausted from three kids and I am always cranky and pissed off it seems...  I know that sex is a HUGE part of a marriage, but its not all there is.  We will get back to it very soon, but if I had to deal with the guilt over it I would probably resent him and thats not how we want to be.   He does not make me feel guilty about it, nor does he pressure me.  Its not like he hasn't gone periods of time without sex before... as I am sure your husband has as well.  He just needs to wait until you are ready.

When I got divorced we had a long distance relationship for an entire year.  During this time he was living with another woman...  He came out to visit me for 3 months and then went back home to her for another three months to get his shit together and move 3000 miles again.... Those three months while he was my SO living with another woman... jesus... I cant even begin to explain how hard that was and how many times we fought. 

He came home for good and we became a couple.  He was still talking to her... he was still email her... when that all stopped it took a long time to win back my trust, probably a year... 

We break up a year into our relationship, he would not let me go so I did the only thing I knew that would drive him away for good.  I cheated on him, with several dudes in the span of a month.  He never stopped calling or emailing and we still hung out... this time it was took a while for ME to earn his trust back...

About a year after that I caught him recording us having sex without my permission.... this.  This was the big one that almost ruined us for good.  After this we did not have sex for over a year.  Eventually though we did get past it, with time and perseverance.  It literally took over a year for us to get past that one issue, that was a breach of trust like no other.  The thing that helped with this issue was that when I was at my whits end and I was on the verge of leaving because nothing he was doing was making anything better he asked me ""What do you need me to do to make this better?""  And when I told him what I needed he followed through 100%, it wasn't even that he did what I asked him, but the fact that he was willing to do what *I needed* to feel better, not what he felt should have been *good enough*. 

Since all of that happened we have gotten married and had two children.  We had them back to back with a 13 month period.  The youngest is now 8 weeks... we are overtired, overworked and we haven't had sex since the little one was conceived. 

How do we make it work?  Well, first and foremost and the obvious answer is we are best friends.  We have troubles but even though we are mad at each other and we are having a period of war, we can still sit down and make each other laugh, we can still go out and enjoy each others company.  We still enjoy being together even when our relationship is shit because we can fall back on our unwavering friendship. 

We communicate well... and not the way people think.  I find that the easiest way for us to communicate effectively is to do it through text.  I know it sounds stupid but its a really good reason to have AIM still!  If we need to talk and its too hard we get on our computers in different rooms and hash it out.  Why is this easier?  There are no raised voices, no attitudes, no snarky inflections, just cold text that says exactly what you need it to say.   He cant hear me angrily smashing keys... furiously typing a million miles a second.  

The biggest thing in all of my and my husbands fights and falling outs and problems is that when something happens, we both want to fix it.  Its not like he really wants to fix it and I am ready to leave and he has to convince me to stay, or vice versa, its holy shit... we are really having an issue here... WE need to figure this out, because at the end of the day the love is still there, we just need to fund the ""us"" again. ",2015-11-03 01:10:52+00:00,cwmb8mf,1.0,t3_3r9uk2,8955.0,breakingmom
2997,"My husband and I have been through some serious shit in the last 9 years and I can say with complete certainty that if only one person is trying then it will not work. 

My husband broke my trust in a way that halted our sex life for more than a year.  It took a LOT of work on his part and on mine too, but more on his part because he was the offender, to get us back in a decent place. 

What really saved us was our friendship. When we are fighting or having a hard time the one thing we can always fall back on easily is our friendship.  While we are dealing with our problems as a married couple we just become friends again.  

The important part being that we both wanted it to work and we BOTH were acutely aware of how dire the situation was and we both worked hard on a lot of occasions to fix our relationship because we love each other more than our problems. 

We are going through some shit right now that we are working on.  But like I said we are both completely dedicated to repairing the issue.  If you have checked out, you have checked out, and if you don't see him trying then he is not trying hard enough.

With my husband when he said he was 'trying' and i decided that he wasn't trying hard enough, I had to tell him very specifically what I needed from him, he wasn't a mind reader.  His willingness to do what I needed was what made all the difference, but if you are telling your husband ""I need this specific thing from you"" and he is still not doing that then he is not doing whatever it takes to keep you together, but this also goes both ways...

I am rambling a bit now... but seriously... it takes two people to fix a marriage, if you have checked out, you have checked out..  It happens.  ",2015-11-02 20:43:27+00:00,cwm0ic0,1.0,t3_3r97qj,1296.0,breakingmom

3005,"I have a 15 month old and a 2 month old.(and a 9 year old but he sleeps just fine) .. my sleep tricks, or as I like to call them ""brainwashing techniques"" are:

I have never rock my kids to sleep... like never, well maybe the first month, but after that no, but if they fall asleep in my arms so be it.  But I also want to stress that I don't let them cry it out either.  So at night kids sleep in cosleeper next to my bed for the first 4-5 months or so.  I will feed them so they have full tummies and they are good and drowsy and then put them down.  I turn off the light, but I will usually have the TV on, because who wants to go to bed at 9 when the baby goes.  I am right there beside them, so if they get fussy, I will put my hand on them or stroke their forehead, but if that doesn't work I pick them up and rock them, until they calm down and then its back in their bed. (this obviously does not apply when they wake up to eat, they get to eat, and then I do this again) I use pacifiers as well.   I use this same method when they are older too when I work on moving them to their own room.  Put them down, leave, if they fuss I go in to calm them and then leave again, I will do this multiple times and sometimes its frustrating the amount of times, but usually it takes two months and then I can just put them down to sleep and they go right out no problem by the time they are 9-10 months.  Usually I start this around 5 months. If there is a particular hard night and my kid wont sleep no matter what I do, then its time for the exception of all night swing sleeping, I do this as a last resort, but it does happen.  Another thing I employ early is a sleep CD, I have one of instrumental lullabies that I start using immediately when they move into their own room.  This is another way I can get them to nap at places like the inlaws, I just have the playlist on my phone.  

For naps, my kids always nap in a swing, right up until the grow out of it, or rock and play that vibrates.  When I put them down for naps I put a blanket on them, its ok for naps when small because I can see them, they are usually immobile, because of swing straps and there is no way they can suffocate. I chose a blanket for them that will last, I like carters blankets or circo because they are very well made and last a long time.  Every time they nap they get this blanket.  It makes them associate sleeping with this blanket, and it becomes their comfort item and as long as they have it with them, they will sleep anywhere.

3020,"I divorced when my first was a year old.  And no he has zero chance of getting sole custody, and if you are still nursing he will most likely get very limited custody at that.  He would literally have to PROVE, like he cant say ""oh she is a heroin addict and beats our kid"" and expect a court to believe him.  Proof is huge with courts.  Also you would have to be on more than therapy and meds to get your kid taken away. 

My advice to you: 

Go to your attorney ASAP.. no joke.  Get a temporary order of separation.  This will say how, custody wise, things will be before the divorce and final custody agreement is ordered and filed. Then, start making a list of everything you want... EVERYTHING...seriously do not leave a damn thing out.  What you want for custody, what holidays you will each have, how you will split Christmas, MAKE SURE YOU GET HALLOWEEN AND FORTH OF JULY IN THERE! Mothers day, fathers day, your birthday, the kids birthday... I am not shitting you, you will be surprised how shitty it can be when Halloween falls on your ex's night year after year and you can never go trick or treating with your kid! 

Make sure you have all your financials in place, pay stubs, tax returns, make sure you keep track of your expenses, because you will have to provide that to the court for child support calculations. I kept a file box with all of this stuff.  If he is doing things like calling you insane and you guys cant communicate in person, start communicating by email only, you can even have that put into your temporary order, that way you have a record when he starts being an ass, or promises something like ""Oh I will only take the kids on the weekends"" and then decides that during a court appearance he will start fighting for 50/50 custody and so then you will have that in writing and it wont be a he said/she said situation. The downside of this is you have to keep your cool at all times.  I used to have someone proof read my emails before I sent them. 

It seems like your baby is young, but also think of things like, who will pay for extracurriculars?  Will that be included in your child support (it usually is unless otherwise specified) or will you split it 50/50.  Who will pay for uninsured medical expenses, who will carry the health insurance.  How much vacation time will you each get with the kid in the summer?  Like will you get a full week to go away? Will he? 

Keep in mind that child support usually starts the day one party moved out.  So make sure you keep track of that date.  If he refuses to pay you from day one, he will be liable for back support to that date.

When I was a kid we used to get a ton of toys for christmas. One year the day after christmas day, my mom said ""You need to clean your rooms before you can bring the new toys in there"" Well not one of us cleaned our room.  She asked over and over for three days.  And then finally she took all our new Christmas toys, put them in large garbage bags and put then in the basement.   I asked her, ""OMG mom! How did we react?"" She said we did not even care, and completely forgot about the toys after a few days.   I was probably about 5... 

SO the point of this story, is not that you should just get rid of the toys in a mean way, its that, he will eventually get over and not care that you have gotten rid of some things.

/u/alovelylark has a good suggestion, but this does not work with every kid and if your kid is anything like mine, he will only give kids in need his shit toys, like the mcdonalds toys or broken one or some random nerf dart...  I have to forcefully take them away...

This is my strategy, I take out all the toys, empty the toy boxes and storage. Leave in the room only the storage boxes you want to remain.  I take the favorite of the toys, and put them in the ramining storage, everything he plays with currently, favorite items that are full sets.  I will even keep a particularly sentimental item and I may put it in basement storage for his little brothers some day.  Everything else gets bagged up and donated, or thrown away depending on the condition.  

Its a necessary evil.  My sons room usually ends up looking like the back room at toy store, and I have tried letting him help sort the toys but it never goes well.

For the first one I got the Madella In Style.  It was a good pump, no question. It did the job, was small and portable, but it did have some draw backs for me.  It was limited in pumping settings, it had a dial on it that changed the degree of suction but thats it. Also it is an open system so it cant be resold and shouldn't be given away.  I also found it difficult to hand wash the pump parts. 

I figured when I had my youngest that it wouldn't hurt to try a new brand pump because it was free so why not. 

I got a Spectra S2 and this is a better pump by far.  Not only can you set the degree of suction but the length of time the pump draws.  The pump parts are easier to clean by hand, there is a handy night light on it so that it is easier to pump at night.  It has a 'massage' setting to encourage let down.  And finally it is a closed system, so that when you are done with it, it is save to pass on to a family member or sell second hand.  Edit to also add. It has a handy place to set down a bottle in the back of it.

3139,"My story is a bit different because I planned on getting an epidural, natural drug free child birth was never in my plan.  

So pregnant with my third child, I was due just 13 months after my second was born. My midwife said to me ""When you go into labor, you get here immediately, no laboring at home, no taking a shower or a nap, you get in here ASAP""  Advice I kinda blew off because my first I labored for 26 hours and my second 46 hours.  Both of those with epidurals.

I went into labor on the night of August 23rd, and I was like... ok, this just started, its not too bad, this could go on for hours and hours, and because I had two kids at home I decided I would wait until morning to go in.  Unfortunately at 1:30 in the morning on the 24th I had to go... there was no more waiting.  I had to wake up my two children and bang on my sisters door at 2 in the morning so she could take them. 

I got to the hospital at 3am.  When I got there I was having contractions about every 2 minutes.  I could still walk, though when a contraction hit I had to stop and lean on my husband until it passed.   When I was checked at the hospital they told me I was 3cm and the baby was super high up, so this was going to be a WHILE. 

So I settled in for the long haul.  I notified my nurse of my intent to get an epidural, and then waited.  I bounced on the a yoga ball for about 30 minutes but at that point my contractions became too painful and I got into the bed.  That was at about 5 am. When I was checked at 5am, I was 5cm and baby was still super high up.  At that point the nurses were preparing to order my epidural because I was literally screaming through contractions.  I could not physically do anything else.  

Now, let me say right now that having a baby with no pain meds when you are not at all mentally prepared is tough.  Like I said I had zero intention of ever giving birth without enough pain meds to knock out a horse.  There was a point where I went into complete panic because I knew that there was no time for the epidural and this baby was coming without it.  

So at 6am, I screamed at my husband, because there was no one else in the room ""THIS BABY IS COMING NOW!"" because little dude went from 6cm and super high up to 10 cm and taking his exit in 30 minutes.  I heard the nurse screaming for the midwife in the hallway and I heard her say ""She says the baby is coming out now, I believe her""  So the midwife went to check and at that moment I had a contraction and out came my third child, I did not push consciously, my body did it on its own. 

Now, this story is not meant to be frightening, it was frightening for me though, but there is a good side.  The midwife said at my 6 week appointment that fast labors like that can be super intense and the pain is often much worse when dilation happens so quickly. 

WITH THAT SAID...

I am seriously surprised at the recovery difference from natural labor as opposed to epidural.  I was in much less pain the next day, I felt great, the baby was less sluggish from the drugs and he was alert and an amazing breastfeeder.   I felt amazing.  If I had another, which I don't plan to! But if I did I would try to go natural again. ",2015-10-12 19:44:19+00:00,cvx9ps3,1.0,t3_3ogxji,10740.0,BabyBumps

3147,"My son is a bit older than yours so this may be a bit different. 

He gets himself out of bed, he is responsible for getting his snack and juice for school, I will make him a sandwich or he will buy lunch.  He is required to get himself dressed and be ready for school without prompting.  He takes showers on my insistence because somewhere between 7 and 8 he started telling me that he didn't need showers, but he is old enough to stink now.  He walks to and from the bus stop alone.  He has to finish his homework first thing when he gets home from school.  He is allowed to ask for help, and I practice his spelling words with him, but everything else is his responsibility. 

He cleans his room, with much prodding and sometimes punishment. He feeds and waters the cat. Cleans up the baby toys for me twice a day. Folds and puts away his laundry. He cleans up the dinner table after dinner, including wiping down the table, and he puts clean dishes away. He collects any recycling that needs to go out on Sunday night and make sure it is in the bin for Monday pick up. He brings in the recycle bins from the curb on Mondays after school.  If he was a bit bigger and could lift more he would be taking the trash out on Monday mornings before school, but he cant lift the bags yet... we are working on it. 

The only thing he gets an allowance for is watching his baby brothers.  If I require him to watch the babies for more than an hour, while I cook dinner or something, I will transfer $5 into his savings account. I feel like the babies are not his responsibility so any help he gives me there is rewarded.  The rest of his chores are unpaid, because he is a functioning member of this household and should help, the rest of us don't get paid for it. 

I have only left him home alone once.  Its not like I dont want to, its just that I dont have the opportunity.  I am a SAHM and his stepdad works from home, there is literally always someone here. 

His punishments include taking away his ipod, video games or shutting off his wifi.

You will need to either bomb the house, which is a giant pain, or get yourself a new vacuum asap and vacuum several times a day, carpets, furniture, everything.

Both my first and second pregnancies I was on metformin for the first 12 weeks to reduce the chance of miscarriage.  For my final pregnancy, I actually got pregnant naturally (shocking surprise!) and was not on metformin for the first 12 weeks.

Here are the tips I got from my mom who had me when my brother was 15 months old.

""Don't ever expect to leave the house again... its not worth it""

""Food shopping? BWAHAHA... yeah. Good luck""

""You are going to breastfeed? Why would you do that to yourself?""

""It could be worse, you could have two babies AND your sister""  (To be fair my sister is a bitch and has been since she left the womb.)

It's only been two days for me, and I haven't even been home for a day yet.  I advise you to do whatever you can to make sure your husband has time off to be with you for the first week at least.  I would also advise someone you are close with, your mother, your best friend, whomever you have that you can bribe, to clean your house for you while you are in the hospital, and then possibly stay with you for a week or come over every day to help out. 

Good Luck!  I am here, going through the same thing... it will be ok.  We can do this shit.

Lysol brand bath tub cleaner OR Mr clean brand tub cleaner both work excellently to remove soap scum and get the tub clean with minimal effort.  I use a sponge on a stick contraption I found at Walmart for tub cleaning, because fuck all that bending.  I use either for cleaning the rest of the bathroom. 

Dawn brand dish soap.  I have tried the generics and they just don't hold a candle.  I used the generic for YEARS, thinking it works the same! and it is cheaper!  Then one day I got regular Dawn and I will never buy generic again.  Finish dish washer bricks with the red dot thing in the middle work the best for the dishwasher, they are a bit more expensive than the other ones, but I never ever had to run a load through twice and the dishwasher I had was ancient. 

Tide powdered detergent with Bleach Alternative.  The powdered detergent cleans clothes so much better than any liquid or pod.  THe only downfall of the powder is that I find I have to start the washer fill a bit with water and add the detergent and then the clothes or there is a risk of not all the powder dissolving.  

I use old fashioned PineSol to clean my floors... BUT NOT THE KIND YOU BUY IN STORES.  I have to order it directly from the company on their facebook page because a few years ago they changed the formula, not only does the new stuff do a shitty job, it smells terrible...

3347,"I found out I was pregnant 4 months postpartum.  Don't be embarrassed, these things happen all the time!   My first two children were made with the power of science, so you can imagine my surprise to actually have a natural pregnancy. 

I can not comment on the c-section stuff, because I have had vaginal births, however, the toll on my body has seemed a little harder.  But I seriously cant tell if it was because my pregnancies were so close or I am just having a hard time being pregnant with another baby to take care of.  My son is 12 months old now and I am 37+6. 

If you are 16 weeks and still breastfeeding, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  I assume your 10 month old is having some solids now.  Mine was just 4 months and still EBF, unfortunately at 8 weeks my supply dropped and I could not sustain that relationship anymore.  I just was not making enough to be his sole source of nourishment, so we had to make the tough decision to switch to formula. If he had been on solids I am sure I could have continued, but he was just too small.  It went great honestly.  It was really hard to be up 4-5 times a night to BF, and be pregnant, so formula made things a lot easier on me. 

I am seriously done being pregnant, but I am worried about how my little dude is going to deal with this.  One, I have never spent a night away from him so the first time we are away from each other for more than a few hours will be when I go into the hospital.  Two, I am bringing home a new baby and there is literally no way for me to explain it to him or even prepare him.  

I feel tremendous guilt over the entire thing, like he did not get any time with me alone just him and mom.  My first child was 8 when my second was born so he had plenty of mom time, where he was the baby.   I have no idea what to expect afterwards because I have never had two babies at once, I just plan on taking one day at a time and dealing with things as they come.  I am trying to have zero expectations.

I am a mom, but that doesn't make me any less of a person who deserves to be something else than just a 'mom'.  I am a woman, I am an artist, I have hobbies, I have a husband and am a sexual being.  I am so many other things than just a mom, and sometimes those things take a back burner because my kids need me.  And sometimes the kids take a back burner, because they have a dad who is just as capable of looking after them.  That does not make me a bad mom, that makes me a person too.

I love my kids, adore them, they are the reason I was born.  Does that mean I want to spend every single friggin waking moment of the next 25 years with them?  No.   Does that mean that sometimes they can become overwhelming and I deserve a moment to myself?

&gt; He has piss-poor skills in budgeting

So this is my husband as well.  I would start off saying, that his spending all his money and not being responsible is hurting the family, that you understand that old habits are hard to break, but you are perfectly fine sitting down with him and working on a budget with him.   I can see you saying a lot in your post ""He needs to change"" But a lot of people dont know HOW to change and end up falling back into their old habits, if they are not taught good habits that make sense to them. 

&gt; One example is that he brings a can of Sprite to bed every night and as a result the cans will pile up by his side of the bed. 

Another thing I can sympathize with only in this case I am the guilty party... I leave shit everywhere, my night stand was a disaster.  What helped here was a small step trash can right next to my stand, that way when it got out of hand I could quickly clean it up with little effort, as the trash can was right there.  Just another one to empty with all the others on trash day.   Try coming up with solutions to other piles around the house that make it easier to do instead of just ""You need to do this""

&gt; I'm tired of telling him ""No, and I don't care that your friends want you there.

I've got one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVJBJY?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00) in my kitchen, its huge and ridiculous, but it works.  Probably because its so huge no one can miss it.  It has everyones stuff on it.  My days out of the house, my husbands and even the kids, everyone's chores, doctors appointments the whole 9, everyone has their own color.  This way no one feels like they are being singled out because they cant follow their schedule.  

&gt; The credit thing.

Well credit is tricky.  Anything his mom has done can be removed after 7 years, not 7 years after it was opened but 7 years after the last activity, and that does not include multiple collection agencies either, it has to be 7 years from the original date of last activity on the ORIGINAL debt.  I don't know how old he is, but you can check his report on CreditKarma.com and see if any meet those qualifications, at that point if there are any you can have them removed, you don't even have to call, you can make an online dispute and get it taken care of because of its age.   Thats the first step.    And really if he wants to just use your credit for stuff, uh... thats not how it works.  If he wants to be on the loan of if you are using his income to qualify, he has to have his credit checked. 


The ""I need a partner not another kid"" is a very good way to put it.   Marriage is a team sport, there is not single person marriage, it does not work that way.   Though I can not stress enough that in this conversation you need to also offer realistic solutions, if he does not like the solutions you are offering you need to say, well how would you fix this then... listen and then offer changes if that doesn't work for you.  Things he can do, things you can help him with to be able to accomplish the goals.  Its important that you are realistic with each other.  Expecting someone to change so much of their own accord just does not work.  I know you are picking up a lot of the slack but its important as well that if you are asking him to be a team with you that you are willing to put just as much work into 'team building' exercises to make your daily life run smoother.

I consider this a consistent schedule because either way he is up for 2.5-3 hours in between naps.   There is no way I could get him to nap at 10am on a day he wakes up at 9am, he would scream his head off for two hours and that helps no one.

I am almost a whole 9 months pregnant, and I haven't had sex in probably 6 of those months.  Because pain.  No I wont put out for my husband just because he is frustrated, because yeah so am I, but I am the one that has to pay for it in the end.   When my last baby was born we didn't have sex for 4 months postpartum because again, pain.  He is also an adult and should be able to deal with that without becoming a big baby about it. He knows I am not 'with holding' sex because I am being an ass, he knows that I just cant physically and emotionally do it, and he does not want me to be in that state of mind when we have sex, its not fair to me, and certainly not fair to him, or even us together as a couple.  And really its not like he has spent every single day of his life since puberty in a relationship, and he has had many years of only being able to jerk off, and oh well.  Thats life. 

When it comes to the 4 year old, its early still and the baby is new.  He will get used to it, but my advice to you when he tries to get in trouble on purpose, is that you need to ignore him.  Put him in a time out and then just pretend he isn't there, even if he is screaming his head off.  I realize this takes extreme self control, I had to deploy this method when my son was about that age, but only because he was being a little ass, and not because he had a new sibling. Once he realized that his bad behavior is getting zero attention he totally backed off.  

This time is also a good lesson for him, that yes, he is not the only one anymore.  I had to explain to my 9 year old that babies have zero way of taking care of themselves. That yes he had his time as an infant with me the same way, he got the all day cuddles and the cluster feeding and now it was time to share mom because thats what big brothers do. 

You are so soon out of just having a baby, you need to cut yourself some slack.

While prefolds and covers have their place in my stash of diapers, I do not use them regularly because, while trifolding them into a cover is a good idea, I find that my babies lack of bootie makes them scrunch up, causing poop issues.  I am not a fan of the snappi, like, ok its works but I find it hard to put prefolds AND THEN a cover on my baby whom I have to cleverly restrain because he is insane. 

I have a few AIO's but my baby is also a heavy wetter, making AIO's last for 30 minutes tops.  The AIO's that I really love are the ones that also have a pocket where I can stuff extra inserts, which basically, in my opinion, just makes the super pockets. 

I love my pockets, as I find its not too hard to stuff them, it takes about 15 minutes sitting on the couch watching tv, same amount of time it takes me to fold prefolds and put them away, and they are super soft on my baby's skin as the whole inside is a stay dry layer, and its super quick to put on one and take one off, especially when the baby is loosing his mind and twisting and turning on the changing table.

Ok... these are things I did as a routine **2-3 times a day**.  

1. Get in a cold shower, cool at least if you cant stand cold, never hot
2. Use a scrubby [luffa](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=35851183) and [Seltun Blue shampoo](http://pics2.ds-static.com/prodimg/14551/300.jpg).  This is about the only time you will get a good scratch in because its less abrasive than say, your finger nails. 
3. Rinse and scrub with a gritty oatmeal soap bar. 
4. Out of the shower, pat dry. 
5. Apply hydrocortisone cream, if you can get your doctor to prescribe a higher concentration than what you can get at the pharmacy that works. 
6. Over the cream apply baby powder, it keeps your clothes from sticking to the rash, which seems to make it so so much worse.
7. Be naked whenever possible!

Granted, all of that will give you about 15-20 minutes of relief but it is better than nothing.   In a real desperation I would use that lidocaine spray for sunburns, but that stuff can also be sticky, so the baby powder was super necessary then. 

One of the things that also helped with the itching was Claritin, its a safe list medication, as long as you don't get Claritin d, I used to take the children's and it worked well at half dose.

That salary after taxes and insurance and a 401k would be Just over $800 a week.  So thats $3460 a month... so lets talk mortage...

Mortgage/rent payment average in my area, ON THE LOW END is about $1300 a month. 

So I am going to use my bills as a comparison. 

Mortgage/Rent $1300

Utilities (Electric/gas/oil/phone/etc) $400

Car payments $350

Gas for commute and travel $200

Food $600 (that is a really LOW estimate for people with kids)

SO then we are looking at things you need like laundry detergent toilet paper, shampoo, that is at least another $100 a month. 

What about things like childcare?  Even part time childcare in the US costs about $150 a week... 

Add all that up and we are looking at $3550 a month in just everyday expenses, not even extras like unexpected car repair or surprise $2000 medical bills, both of which can drain a savings account in one shot. 

So....is $2000 a big deal, yes, yes it is. 

Edit to add: When I was working full time my husband and I were pulling in $62k combined.  Now that he works and I stay home we only pull in about 55k (BEFORE TAXES)... because if I did work full time daycare would cost us $26k a year...

3754,"My last two births I had no husband home and was home alone with the baby from day one.   It was ok honestly.   When they are so little and new like that it is mostly eat, sleep, poop, lie around like a potato, repeat.   This third and final I will have my husband home, but I am kind worried about getting sick of him being here... so...  

My tips for you:

Do not be afraid to PUT THE BABY DOWN. I see so many new moms who even pee holding their babies because they feel guilty putting them down... its ok to drop them in a swing or bouncy seat.  You deserve to pee hands free damnit! 

Dont forget to eat, like seriously... You will feel like total junk if you do.  

If you are breastfeeding, set up a breastfeeding station where you plan on doing that, things to include:  WATER... I can not stress this enough, the second that baby latches you will have never been so damn thirsty in your damn life.  The REMOTE if you are near the TV, your computer, tablet or phone, nursing can be extremely boring, and snacks for those days when the baby just wants to eat for an hour and you forgot to eat again... 

Make sure you husband knows your expectations for when he gets home from work.  Gone are the days of ""I just need to relax for an hour before engaging with you""  He needs to know that until shit calms down he will be 100% ON the second he walks in the door... I mean, he gets to pee if he has to and get a drink but thats it man, thats it. 

Decided ahead of time if you are going to have him get up in the night with you or not.  I personally did not have my husband get up because he works sometimes 70 hours a week and I was nursing.  HOWEVER, he must understand that there will be exceptions to this rule.  Finding yourself crying hysterically in the corner in the middle of the night with a screaming baby is not an unheard of thing... make sure he knows that even though he has to work now is the time to step up and grab that kid and let you get some sleep. 

I say this a lot on this sub because it was the best piece of advice I have ever heard from a nurse.  This woman was in her 60's, and she was sitting in my hospital room with us late one night just chatting and she looked my husband dead in the eye and said ""There WILL be a point where she will start to cry, do her, yourself and that baby a favor and take that baby and let her sleep""  

There was one night where my husband woke to me sobbing, like ugly cry sobbing, because the baby had been nursing for 3 hours in the middle of the night and I was desperately looking for a pacifier like a crazy person.  He looked at me, picked up the baby and sent me to bed, he said he found the pacifier and the baby stopped crying and they hung out for 2 hours while I slept until he needed to eat again.  It was exactly what I needed... it was 2am... he did in fact, have to work the next day.  He was amazing. ",2015-07-20 19:29:58+00:00,cta129e,1.0,t3_3dz9di,1467.0,BabyBumps

I ain't the best wife but my husband isn't going to cheat on me, which, lets be honest, is what he has done.

I see that you are adamant about not leaving him, and I am sure you have your reasons, (I am going to assume is for security and family reasons, kids etc.) and I am not going to try to convince you otherwise because I can see that you are set in that.  But he has done this a few times now, even when he gets caught he does not care.  

So as far as I see it you have two choices:

1.  You need to start not being bothered by this behavior, or basically look the other way.  I know that sounds like shitty advice, but he is not going to stop doing this, thats pretty clear.  So you can either be super crushed and upset every time he does it or you can just stop looking for it, and turn a blind eye when you think it might be happening.

2.  You could just up and leave like everyone else says.  He is not going to change, he will continue to do this and he will eventually cheat physically.  

The decision that you need to make here is what are you willing to put up with?  Are you willing to put up with the cheating and flirting and lying in exchange for a marriage, and kids and a sense of security?  OR are you not willing to put up with that, are you not willing to sacrifice your happiness for his?   

I think in either of these scenarios you need to seek counseling, NOT couples counseling because I don't think that is going to work for him, I think you need to seek your own counseling so that you can work through what it is that you really want and and NEED in YOUR life and your childrens lives.

Honestly, you getting her an interview and then her being offered the job and she not taking it could potentially make you look bad, it makes it look like you wasted your companies time on someone who is unreliable. 

She is a grown woman, she needs to step it up, you helping her because you feel bad for her is just enabling her, just like it sounds like her mom is doing.

They started at 2 in the afternoon one day and I didn't go into the hospital until the next morning at 8am, and didn't end up having the baby until the day after that. 

Your best bet is to call your doctors office and see what they say before going in which is what you did and was definitely the right thing to do.  I mean, some people can have false labor that totally feels like the beginnings of early labor, so even though the expense is there its always best to be checked.

Now I am not saying that is going to happen to you, but you MUST protect yourself and get a custody agreement out of the way as a priority, not just to protect you but so you know whats up.  

My son lives with me (residential custody, it basically dictates which town my son goes to school in, mine), but he goes to his dads every other weekend from Thursday night-Monday morning, where he is dropped off at school, or incase of summer, at my house.  He also gets him every other Wednesday and Thursday nights.  

Make sure you have stipulations for whether or not you get the kids on Mothers day and Fathers day if they happen to fall on opposite parenting weekends.  Decide which holidays you will switch, is 4th of July important to you? Easter? or does it not matter who's day that falls on, stuff like that.   Who will the kids trick or treat with, will you switch every other year or will you always all go together? 

Make sure on weekend drop offs and pick ups there is a time specified, like my ex picks up my son at 5:30 on Thursdays and he must be home by 8:30 on Monday morning.  This is more important than you think.  

Make sure you make stipulations for Monday holidays, will the kid be switched back on Sunday still or will the other parent get to keep them for an extra day?

4015,"Clomid is relatively cheap so you if your insurance doesn't cover it, it shouldn't be too much out of pocket.  

Unfortunately clomid is not something you can take indefinitely, you can only do it so many times.   Usually they will start you out on the lowest dose because of this.   

Basically a monitored cycle is this:

They give you clomid to take on cycle day 3-7 or 5-9, what they do then is around cycle day 12-14 they will do ultrasounds to see if clomid is actually working to create follicles on your ovaries (follicles contain the eggs)  They will make sure they are measuring the right size and then give you a trigger shot, that forces your follicles to burst (ovulation) releasing the egg.  Then you have sex for like the next 4-5 days.  The trigger shot us HCG, the hormone that indicates pregnancy so they tell you not to home test and possibly get a false positive. 

I feel like clomid without being monitored is a waste of time, it was for me, I had two unmonitored clomid cycles with a regular OB who gave me very little instruction.   They had no way of knowing if clomid was even making me ovulate, it could have just been creating follicles and having them not burst, because sometimes it doesn't work.

Usually lenders will look for 2 years of work history, however, if your credit is good and you are making enough money to afford the payment they will sometimes not think that is that big of a deal.     So I am assuming you are leaving your husband?  Do you have a job currently?   You will NOT get a loan if you do not have a job and steady income. 

When banks calculate your loan they will look to see if you can afford to pay the mortgage+insurance+taxes.  If this is more than 1/3 of your monthly income, you will not get a loan.  

However, I would not try to purchase anything until the divorce is final, there are laws about that.   Your spouse, whether on the loan or not, may have rights to that house because you are married and he could absolutely have a right to its worth in the divorce.

4057,"Well, I have had 2 vaginal births, super ass long labors (26 and 46 hours respectively), and in both of those cases, and more often than not (from what I have heard from other moms) the doctor isn't insanely involved in the birthing process.  You will spend 90% of your time with nurses, whom you have also never met.  They will consult with the doctor, but usually not while the doctor is in the room.  They will say ""I need to check with the doctor on what he/she wants to do"" and that is pretty much it.   With and induction you might see more of the doctor, but I cant imagine much more.

4060,"Congratulations! As a fellow sufferer of infertility I always love hearing success stories!  


I have been cloth diapering for 11 months now, and I will tell you what the deal was for me. 

I started out serious about only using one size diapers, because I didn't want to have to buy newborn stuff and use it for like a minute and then have to pack it away.   I am glad I didn't buy newborn stuff, because I have a moose child and there is no way the newborn stuff would have fit him beyond month. 

The first couple of weeks I used small size prefolds and covers.  I loved these for the EBF poops because they contained it the best.  Used Snappi's with the prefolds.   I stopped using prefolds because the constant wetness against my son's skin started giving him a rash, so I switched to pockets. 

I LOVE pockets.  I used those for a good 7 months straight.  I have a combination of Charlie Banana, BumGenius, Glowbug and Happy Flutes.   My assessment of each:

Charlie Bananas:  Work very well for small babies, does not seem to be great for larger chunky babies because their inserts are too narrow. Though they were perfect for when he was under 15 pounds. 

BumGenius: Very well made, fantastic inserts that can be sized with the diaper, comes with a doubler, durable. Fits great. 

Glowbug: Eh, they are ok but way overpriced for china cheapies and they do not hold up.  I am down to 4 from my original purchase of 12.  Inserts are ok, still use them in my Happy Flutes. The thing I liked the most about them were that they sized down small and fit my sons body shape better than any of the other One size diapers. 

Happy Flutes:  I have some pockets and some AIO's.  Love them, they are like glowbug diapers but on steroids.  Very soft lining and the AIO's have a pocket for additional inserts.  Great for naps.  Super affordable so I could buy MORE than I ever needed and they have super cute prints.

At about 9 months the pockets stopped working for us, NONE of them sized right to fit my sons shape and size.  I switched to prefolds and covers. 

I used Ozocozy indian cotton prefolds and Best Bottom covers exclusively.   We had a great run actually, the wetness was no longer bothering my sons skin and we had exactly zero leaks with prefolds and covers, I was just not happy with them. 

At 10 months we switch back to our pockets... minus the Charlie Bananas and BumGenius diapers, we use exclusively Happy Flutes now and they fit him fantastically.  

So basically the whole reason for this post is to let you know that I would buy several different kinds of diapers, they dont all work all the time!  I did not believe it when I first started out and had convinced myself that ""I will make whatever I buy work for us at whatever cost!""  NOPE!  I was proven wrong with a lot of peed on clothes! 

So... here is what I have:

15 Happy Flute Pockets (2 inserts each so 30)

7 Happy Flute AIO's  (1 Doubler each so 14)

I can get away with doing laundry every other day, but if that was my whole stash I would have to do everyday with a newborn.

Not in use currently but am expecting another babe in 8 weeks. 

11 Charlie Banana OS Pockets (2 inserts each 22)

10 BumGenius OS Pockets (1 insert each + Doubler so technically 20)

5 Best Bottom OS Covers

18 infant size prefolds

24 large size prefolds

4 glowbug pockets (2 inserts each 8)

2 newborn snappi's and 4 large snappi's

I expect with a newborn and all the poopy diapers to still have to do laundry every other day, even with all of that.   


I have a large stash, but that came about because of trial and error. And I have also sold a few things over the last few months.  But I have seen some HUGE stashes on here, and mine kind of pales in comparison to theirs!  My advice is variety variety variety. ",2015-06-29 15:17:20+00:00,csmfsqw,1.0,t3_3bgc5u,55489.0,clothdiaps

4065,"It took me at least 2 months to get my son to latch properly, I know a lot of people say that 2 weeks is normal and anything other than that isn't, but seriously... no.  Some babies are just slower in getting the whole breastfeeding thing down.  Breastfeeding can be more difficult or less difficult depending on the person.  I was also in serious pain for 3 months EVEN THOUGH he had a great latch and we had already had a tongue tie clipped.   So many people said ""pain is not normal!""  But for me it totally was and eventually it all fell into place and everything was fine. 

I agree with u/brolee said, try a bottle of about an oz, and then try to get her to latch on the breast.  Everyone will be more calm and not completely starving.   It also takes time to get the hold down.  I discovered that one of the most important things in breastfeeding is the position of the baby/breast.   Everyone has a different shaped body so its going to be different for everyone.  Once you get into a hold or position that you are comfortable with you can always tweak it a little to make it more comfortable for you, adjust in small increments.

How?

I made the OB do a dating ultrasound at 8 weeks because I would not believe it until I saw it.

With my first birth, I had zero idea what I was going into.  I was like, yeah labor... women have been doing it since the beginning of time, I suppose I will handle it when it comes.   So I went and I was ok for a while, the entire labor was 26 hours, about 12 hours in they gave me pitocin after my water was broken and there was no progress.   I did ok, but I was exhausted.  I got the epidural just so I could get some sleep!  The rest of my labor was painless.. no joke.  I was happy, laughing with the nurses, joking around with my mom.  When it came time to push I could concentrate on pushing and not the pain.  Pushed for 20 minutes and baby was out, did not feel them stitching up my tear, did not feel the nurse pushing on my stomach when the placenta would not detach.  It was a great experience. 

For my second baby I was in labor for a total of 46 hours.  I had PUPPS all over my abdomen and legs, I was a miserable mess.   I labored for approximately 20 hours before I asked for the epidural.  They did not want to give it to me because I was handling the contractions so well.   I was 6cm and they were again bringing out the pitocin, and I was tired.   They relented and gave it to me.  I could no longer feel the PUPPS, I was relaxed, I was again just chillin with my mom and my husband.  We were joking around, talking to the nurses it was a very fun relaxed time! 

At the 46 hour mark I had a lot of pressure, but again no pain.  I had an awesome anesthesiologist and he placed that thing perfect, I could still move my legs, they were just slightly numb.  I was asked if I felt like pushing and I pushed twice and he came flying out.  Again, a nice relaxing birth.  Did not feel the stitches for my tear, did not feel the placenta being birthed.  It was as a relaxing birth experience as one could have.  I did skin to skin for about an hour and a half, they took the baby to give him a quick look over and the epi was removed and instantly I could walk, took a shower, and then chilled with my baby for the rest of the day.

4141,"I have seen this model of doctors office more and more, mostly by women on this sub.  My doctors office rotates between OB's and midwives.  I see a different person every time I go in.  The reason they do this is because on any given day they only have one midwife and one OB on call at the hospital they are affiliated with.  

Mostly I think, or it just makes sense to me, that they do this so that you will know, or at least have met the person that is delivering your baby.   They cant have 3 OB's in the office and then expect that OB to be in the hospital every time one of their patients goes into labor, there are still other pregnant women who have regular appointments day after day, and it would do them a disservice to have their appointment cancelled.   

It makes sense in largely populated areas.  My doctors office has something like 15 providers, they are BOOKED so tight sometimes it is hard to get an appointment, so it makes sense that on any given day there are 13 there to take appointments and 2 on call.   

THEN if you go into labor, you will give birth with the on call midwife, and you will only see the on call OB if there is a complication or need for more invasive medical intervention.  I really really like this model.  The reason I really like this model is because when I had my first baby I saw the same OB for my entire pregnancy, I ended up having my baby on my due date, but my OB was unavailable for delivery and saw the on call OB, whom I had never met ever.  This way I will at least see a familiar face no matter the availability of my providers. 

The other thing too is that my doctors office even though they have OB's are pretty hands off when it comes to pregnancy, they don't treat it like a medical condition, they treat it as just a natural part of a womans life.  So when I go in, its like... ""oh, you have had an uneventful pregnancy, do you have any questions or concerns, and if everything is a-ok then its great! see you in a month!""

I really like that, I am not treated like a woman with a medical condition, I am treated like I am experiencing any other natural function my body can do.  

I definitely agree that its not for everyone, if you feel you need a more one on one approach then absolutely try to find a provider you are comfortable with, but I really enjoy the way this kind of office works.

I only use prefolds and covers when I KNOW I need to be leakproof for more than 2 hours, like in the car or out shopping. ",2015-06-16 21:16:51+00:00,cs8tmf3,1.0,t3_3a204a,16578.0,clothdiaps

4201,Thats... highway robery!  I had my first uncomplicated birth in a Boston Hospital and the total came to $23k... that was 9 years ago.

4203,"I dunno, I don't even care that I am judged, and I judge other moms secretly and out loud to only my husband.  I get judged for cloth diapering, but damnit those things are adorable, and that is basically my reason for doing it, saving money, meh... good for the environment? sure I guess... but LOOK AT THIS ADORABLE SPIDER MAN DIAPER I HAVE!  My 11 month old doesn't crawl... and? So what?!  I refused to give my oldest cows milk, because back when he was a baby the ""no artificial growth hormone!"" milk was not a thing. SO WHAT! He hated it anyway. 

Lets look at this for example...

An old friend from high school came to my house today with her 3 year old.   He was super good for a 3 year old, he didn't have to be told what to do most of the time, he was excited about a new place and was touching everything, but I have kids so I don't really care. He was polite and said please and thank you.  But he had his moments. I don't have any shame in telling someone else's kid how to behave in my home, and she trusts me enough to allow me to do that.  

BUT... he is 3.5 and still uses a pacifier and is not even close to potty trained.   Hey I know all kids are different, and I know its harder for other people when their kids wont cooperate... I GET THAT... but in my head I'm like...dude... just throw the pacifier away DO NOT LET HIM CONTROL YOU!

This is not a big deal and she is a nervous parent, she feels like she is failing her kid because her MIL critiques and picks on everything she tries to do as a parent and that is fucking terrible!  She FEELS super judged all the time and that makes her question her actions and do things that MAKE HER THE TARGET OF MORE JUDGING!  

I tried to give her a mom pep talk.  Let her know that she is doing fantastic and she is the mom... no one else.  Her decisions are hers and she is making good ones.  She said the last time I saw her that she was jealous of me because I was a confident parent.   I want everyone to be a confident parent, because we are all doing ok.   I wish I could help her more.

4205,"My husband was like... ""oh ok..."" even though we had been trying for 5 years and we were on clomid and I think it was disbelief.   But when his son was born, he was a crying mess. Still is, I think he cries about something every day.   

When our son was 4 months old and I presented him with yet another positive pregnancy test, he kinda just stood there for a minute.  Looked at me and said ""Is this yours?""  No, I stole someones gross pee stick just to fuck with you.. .  ",2015-06-16 12:22:24+00:00,cs89vc2,1.0,t3_3a0e1o,21559.0,BabyBumps

4207,"29+4 also This is my third... and will be my second labor in just over a year.  I am ok I guess.  The only time I panic is thinking of dealing with a newborn and a 13 month old.   I am assuming it will be easier than it has been because I will have a new baby and NOT be pregnant, which is not how my 11 month old has lived his life so far!

I am getting psyched up to lose weight and get in shape more than the baby coming, because I have to be in better shape to have the stamina for two babies. 

I am really looking forward to not, and never being pregnant ever again! Husband is getting snipped!  ",2015-06-16 12:16:07+00:00,cs89qdo,1.0,t3_39zpls,35302.0,BabyBumps
