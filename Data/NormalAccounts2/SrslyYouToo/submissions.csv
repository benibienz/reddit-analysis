It is a woman and a man, woman has a small child with her and they seem to have known each other long ago and have just bumped into each other.  They are standing there talking for at least 30 minutes, I am not really listening until I hear this:

""Yeah it was nice, I went and was like OH is this what stay at home moms do all day!?  They just have BBQ's and have drinks and relax?  Wish I had it that easy!""  To which the guys laughs and asks her what she does for a living, she is a party planner.  Which I know is a hard job, but gawd, yeah where are these SAHM moms that relax and have parties all the time?  Because I would totally join that fucking club. 

AND THEN

I was sitting in the break room and this girl comes in.  She says that she isn't ever going to have kids because ""Kids these days are spoiled brats and its awful""  To which I reply, ""Well yeah, some people spoil their kids, but thats not universal across the board of all kids""  Then she talks about screaming toddlers and how she doesn't think that its that hard to tell your kid to shut up.   I looked her right in the eye and said with a laugh in my voice ""I have three kids and if you think its easy to get a 2 year old to stop screaming if they want to scream you are 100% wrong and have no idea what you are talking about""  Surprisingly after that she listened to what I had to say about kids and how 2 year olds don't have a brain that is developed enough to understand things like adults and reasoning with someone who has no idea what reasoning is, is not a thing that you can do, period.   I dunno, maybe I changed her mind on screaming kids, but I seriously doubt it.

One. I hate school, I suck at it.  The last time I tried I failed miserably, but like, I was going through a divorce with an infant and I had a boyfriend who was acting like an ass.  I was having stress at work and it was just all around a bad time. 

Its online, which is hard for me.  I do great in a classroom/lecture environment, I do shit online.  I am not a self learner, but I don't have any time to go to a class. 

The debt.  My husband is going back to school right now on his company's corporate dime, so at least he wont have student loans, but here I am... thinking of going thousands of dollars in debt. 

My husband and I made this decision together.  Because he is afraid that if something happens to him, say he gets sick or dies, or if we get divorced that I will have no way to support myself and the kids.  And sadly he is correct. I have no degree and no marketable skills for this area of the country.

The 2 babies will just make a trip around the block and then my husband will bring them home.

We are getting our new windows installed this Thursday, which is awesome, I can not wait to get rid of these awful 150 year old windows and all the drafts and bugs they let in.  But since the kids can not be here when the lead windows are being disposed of the window installers will be traipsing around my apartment unsupervised for an entire day.   This is my safe space... I do not like people in it when I am not here.  Let alone a bunch of strangers.   So that is problem #1. 

Then, well I haven't worked for 3 years which has done amazing things for controlling my anxiety.  So now that I have been working for a few weeks all that working anxiety is returning.  Social anxiety sucks for working in a retail environment when you are seeing and speaking to over 100 people each day.  

There is one type of interaction that happens at least twice a week that ruins my day and sticks with me for days. 

So I work in a store where at least 50% or more of the people that come through my register are mom's or dad's with kids.  I always behave myself.  I say hi to the kids, I don't offer stickers to the screaming ones or the ones where the moms is like ""You are going to be in trouble when we get home!""  If I do offer, I always ask the mom quietly first and never the kid directly.  If the kid asks I always look to the mom for approval, and sometimes they say no, so I have to say I have run out or give some other kid friendly excuse.  

But at least once or twice a week a mom or grandmother will come to my register with a pile of stuff, throw it all up on the belt point to one item and say ""Please don't let kid see this!""  And then proceed to allow their child to watch me like a hawk.  Kids love to watch you scan things.  Like, they just stand there and watch because its the only action going on.  They don't try to distract the kid or anything!  And then when the kid does see the item, despite my best efforts, the parent always gives me an attitude for the remainder of the transaction.  

Then for a few days after I go over and over it in my head.  How could I have done that differently, how could I have done that without the kid seeing... and then I go through all the other things like.. well its not really my job and I did the best I could and it is really not fair to me that they are putting me on the spot like that and not helping.   

So this happened to me yesterday.  The kid was standing RIGHT THERE watching everything I did because some kids like to watch the scanner.  The kid saw the item he was not supposed to see, said ""Who is that for!"" and instead of the mom making up some excuse like ""Well its for your cousin, or a friend at work.. they are having a toy drive at work..."" I dunno anything! She looks at me like.. you fucking ruined it! and told the kid it was for him.  The formerly smiling polite mom turns into a huge bitch. I keep going over in my head how I could have done it differently and I couldn't have, she didn't help me like some people do by distracting her own kid, and I did the best I could.   I am sure she is home with her item, and is over the interaction, but I am still sitting here obsessing over the interaction, because that's what anxiety does.  I need it to stop.

We are absolutely soul mates, he is everything to me.  Every time I tell anyone about how we got together they say the same thing ""Wow... that sounds like a fairy tale"" and I always say that yes, it was a fairy tale.   

We have been together since 2007, and we met in 2001.  Its been a long haul.  For the first year of our official relationship he was 3000 miles away.  He used to write me multiple love letters a day.  One time he sent me a package and in it was jacket, and when I put it on I instinctively put my hand in the pocket because I just knew he put something in there.  It was his student ID, (he had moved to go to school and that was long done) that sounds dumb and cheesy but it meant something to me, and it still sits in my wallet behind my drivers license where it has been for the last 9 years. 

He would send me songs to my email and when we finally saw each other after a year of long distance he gave me 3 mix cd's which I transferred to my itunes and all those songs that he emailed and the ones from the cd's are what make up my only playlist that I listen to in my car.  

I try my best to do things for him that are still on par with the way we were back then.  For our 5 year wedding anniversary I made him one of those photobooks with quotes from our love letters and other things, pictures of us through our relationship and the kids.  It was just an elaborate love letter, a long one.   I found a deal and paid just $20 for it.  He didn't get me anything.  He said he didn't have any money, but I know that it just didn't cross his mind that he would have to get me something.  I cook meals for him that he likes.  I make room in the budget for him to get beer every once in a while.  If I run to the store I will bring him back a candy bar he likes. Stupid little stuff like that just to show that I am thinking of him. 

He works full time, I have recently started working part time.  I do all the house management, from doctors appointments to paying bills budgeting our small income to keep up with expenses, coordinating weekends and vacations. I do most of the cleaning and most of the childcare because I am here all day and he is working.   I don't have a problem with our division of labor, it works for me. 

What I do have a problem with is the fact that for the first 3 years of our relationship I was cherished. I was appreciated.  It was obvious that he was in love with me.  I asked him tonight to think of the last time he did something nice for me without me asking first.  When was the last time he planned a date night... or even suggested it.   He said he planned our kid free weekend that we just had in September, but all he did was turn to his mom while we were all in the kitchen and go ""Hey, what do you guys think about taking the kids overnight?""  And that was it, me and his mom planned the weekend and I planned the details of what we would be doing.  We had agreed ahead of time to do it, it wasn't like he asked his mom and surprised me with the gesture.  

I feel like when we have sex its just him wanting to have sex and its a chore to me because I don't feel like he loves me, but that he just puts up with me because he married me and had kids with me.  He doesn't think about me or show me that I am loved, just that he wants to have sex with me.  That is the only time I get anything resembling affection, when he is trying to convince me to have sex with him.  I feel like he knows I am a good wife but he doesn't think thats out of the ordinary and that he can just rely on me always being here so it doesn't matter what he does. 

I guess I just always pictured us as that couple, the one that you read about where the old man still gets his wife flowers every week for 50 years.   I know he loves me, I know he loves me more than life itself.  I know that.  But sometimes its hard to believe.  Or I just have unrealistic expectations.  I dunno.

The doctor asked me ""Would you like a 30 day supply or 90?""  I said 90, because less of a pain in the ass right?  

So I bring the prescription to the pharmacy, and my insurance company refuses to fill a 90 day prescription and only allows 30 days at a time.  FINE..  So for the past three months I have been refilling it every 30 days.  When the pharmacy calls me and tells me that my insurance company will no longer cover the medication at that location and I have to get it through the mail order pharmacy.  FINE, they transferred the prescription for me, and they already have a profile on me and my prescriptions because its directly through my insurance plan.    

I go into their mail order system find my 90 day prescription refill in the system and request a refill, they say that since this is a new set up they have to contact my doctor.  The pharmacy contacts my doctor and when they don't hear back they cancel my prescription.  Cancel it.  No one called me, or emailed me or notified me that my order for my prescription for my medication that I take twice a day every single day, was cancelled.  

I found out because my doctors office sent the refill information to my original pharmacy, and they called me to let me know that my insurance wont cover it there anymore.   

No word still from the mail order pharmacy so I called them and she said ""The prescription has to be for a 90 day supply""  Well it was for a 90 day supply I saw it in your system, but you refused to fill for that much for the first three months, don't you have record of that? ""The prescription has to be for a 90 day supply"" OK, well I see you cancelled my order, was I going to be made aware of that?  ""The prescription has to be for a 90 day supply?""  Ok.. yeah I get that, but I am asking other questions... are you going to answer them or continue to spit this scripted info at me?  ""I am not on a script ma'am, the prescription has to be for a 90 day supply""  But the original one WAS for 90 days.. Whatever, forget that.  If this happens in the future will I be notified that my refill requests are cancelled or will I only find out when my medication doesn't show up and I run out?  ""We need a prescription for a 90 day supply or we can not fill it""  At that point I just hung up on her because that was some serious bullshit.

My son is 10, he is a unicorn.  He is a great student, he is polite, he barely ever gives me problems at all about anything and he has a heart the size of the moon. 

When he is at my house he is allowed to be a 10 year old kid.  He is allowed to play video games, he is allowed to watch tv, he has a kindle fire and an ipod touch, and his very own computer in his room. 

When he is here his chores are always done and his homework is always done... no problems at all.   

To put in perspective how his life at his dads is: 

He is not allowed to play or watch anyone play, video games at all, even when dad is playing. 

He is not allowed to watch tv, even if the adults are watching, they send him out of the room. 

He is only allowed to read

His dad sleep until the last minute with only enough time to get himself ready for work, never has time to give the kid a proper breakfast and on weekends his dad sleeps until 11 or 12 and he is not allowed to do anything between when he gets up at 6am until dad gets up.  He sits quietly in his room until he wakes up. 

So with all that... lets get to this.  He came home from school today after spending the night at his dads last night and said this:

""Dad says I am not allowed to do homework at his house anymore and that I have to do it here before he picks me up."" Why? ""Because I always forget to do it at his house"" 

I am convinced that the reason this came to be is not because he forgets, but because he wants him to play less video games here, or have less fun. My exhusband is too lazy to ask the kid ""Do you have any homework tonight?""  So he has to spend the hour after school every day before he goes off to dads doing homework? 

He is not allowed to watch tv... his reason ""You watch tv at moms""  He is not allowed to play video games... his reason? ""You play video games at moms""   This kid is not allowed to do anything over there except sit in his room in silence because I allow him freedom to be a kid at my house...

Kid has been asking me for 2 years when he will be old enough to go in front of a judge and ask that he only goes to dad's every other weekend.  In my state it is 13 years old.   I told him I will absolutely do that for him when he is old enough.   He is not being abused, his dad is just an ass and is too strict for his own good, so like... I cant get him out of visitation because he makes my son read y'know.   But I think come February when the tax return comes in I will be getting a consult with an attorney to see if I can do anything for this kid because this is getting fucking ridiculous.

He comes up turns his music on his headphones super loud and leaves.  So now I am trying to watch a movie that I had the volume super low, with music blaring from his headphones.  

He comes upstairs, sits down and starts reading his book for the class he is taking and then at 10:45 when I am just about ready to roll over and go to sleep he starts typing away on his computer, and he has one of those super loud clicky clacky keyboards.  I am like really?  Its fucking 10:45! I want some quiet.  So then that makes me an asshole because now he has to practice some courtesy and he fucking hates that. 

Whenever I am busy doing something, like cooking dinner or doing dishes or crying because I am upset, he tries to grope me, grab my ass, trying to kiss my neck.  I have to physically fight him off sometimes because he thinks its funny and a game, even though I yell at him. 

If there is trash or some kid toy or spoon or whatever on the floor of the kitchen he will walk by it 100 times and never pick it up.  He knows I will do it eventually.  I have left stuff there as an experiment to see how long he will leave it and I have gotten up to a week before I snap and get it myself.  When I have told him about this he says ""I was giving you the same test!""  Why asshole?  You never pick stuff up to begin with? That makes no sense. 

I take care of this family...that is all I do.  I make dinners that he likes, even if I am tired and they are a lot of work.  If he wants a video game or something I make sure I squeeze it into the budget even though all my clothes have holes in them AND are all maternity clothes even though my youngest is a year old.   I pay all the bills, I make sure I can take his $50k salary and stretch it so we can have a house and electricity and internet and food for a family of 5.  

The petty revenge part is basically giving him some of his own medicine.  Like I made a pot of coffee this morning, but only made enough for me. I will not be calling him in for dinner when it is ready, I will just sit down and eat with the kids.  I will be going to bed without warning and shutting the TV and light and he can find me fast asleep in the bedroom when he notices I haven't been in the room with him for a while.  I will no longer do sweet things for him just because.

So like, yesterday I found out my 1 year old has elevated lead levels, so cue panic about that.  My husband backed into a parked car on Saturday so I am also dealing with insurance and repair and appointments for that with two babies.   I start a new job on tomorrow night, and today... 

I was just changing my 2 year olds diaper and he is freaking out FREAKING OUT.  He usually doesn't like his diaper changed but he never freaks out like this.  So I look in the diaper, a spot of green pus... oh fuck. 

Try to check out his penis and he freaks, it is so swollen and there is definitely green pus leaking from the area. So him not being able to sleep last night makes complete sense now and the fact that he only took a 20 minute nap.  Called the doctors office they say to bring him in, give me the name of the doctor that is available.  I wait for my husband to come home because one car.  He gets here and I tell him how I HATE that doctor, how she is an old lady who is very abrupt and I am not really interested in her looking at or handling my uncut 2 year old painful penis.  So he decides to take him to urgent care.. 

I mean, all these problems are small ones comparatively but piled on top of one another? In less than 4 days?  I don't know if I can take this, I really don't. 

Top that with the fact that the FSA account has been shut off because of their error and they refuse to turn it back on even though the situation has been resolved, so now I have to pay out of pocket for my $400 endo appointment last week as well as my $250 appointment from last month, and whatever this appointment is going to cost and get reimbursed.  As if we have that kind of money lying around.  My bank account has $3 in it.  

So after all that thank god for my husband.  Seriously.  I love that man.  He took the 2 year old to urgent care so I didn't have to go and be that completely insane irrational scared mom, and I can totally be insane at home instead. 

My poor kids.  Its like they can't catch a break!

There are no laws saying that you cant rent to someone if there is lead, there are no laws that say that landlords even have to test for it.  All they have to do legally is have you sign a form when you move in that says ""Yes I understand that I am renting a home that was built before 1978 and I understand that there COULD be lead paint here""   Thats it.  When we moved in the landlord told us that they did not test for lead, but they did paint over all the surfaces with a lead sealer kind of paint.  I was like... ok that should be cool.  I have kept the kids away from the windows by blocking them with furniture and things like that just as a precaution.  But I had no idea that opening and closing old painted windows could create lead dust... that could get into the air and all over the toys and into my kids mouths. 

So this house was built somewhere in the 1880's. It is a duplex, I didn't even know they built duplexes back then.   I guess I had a false sense of security about this kind of thing from so many years of living in Massachusetts, I just assumed that landlords had to test for and remove lead paint before being allowed to rent them out which is the law in Mass.  Nope. 

Well my 1 year old came back with high lead levels.  WTF. My 2 year old did not when he was a year old and we were living in the same place.  They were not high as in ""you need to rent a hotel room"", but high as in ""He as been exposed... you need to find out the fucking source before it gets worse""   

So I have ordered lead test strips on Amazon and I will be testing everything from the windows to the painted wood toys we have.  

I am just devastated.  We can't move, since we moved in here rent prices have skyrocketed to way out of our price range.  Even in poorer towns with shit school systems... this is our only option right now.  So approved ways of keeping lead dust and exposure down are being researched and the entire house is getting an overhaul.   I will be repainting all the windows with a lead sealer paint.

Anyway, I could be freaking out for nothing because I guess the foot prick has a tendency to be really really wrong... but I will not be the one who takes him for a real blood draw, like from a vein.  I cant stomach it, my husband will have to do it... and hopefully it comes back negative.

First, my inlaws had stayed this past week at the beach, they requested that my son stay with them last night, and since it was my ex's weekend I had to ask his permission and then go pick him up.  That was yesterday, we picked him up and my husband backed my brand new minivan into a parked car... Right in front of my ex's house.  Lots of damage, I have go get the insurance inspection at 8 tomorrow morning with two toddlers in tow.  And the damage to the other car was also substantial... I see a rate hike in my future. 

So today we go to the beach, which I hate, with the two babies to pick up my 10 year old and to attend the seafood festival they have there every year.  5 minutes inside the cottage and the two year old trips over the one year old, who ends up slamming his head on the floor resulting in a bloody nose.  So that's how it started. 

We walk down the the seafood festival and it's loud and smelly and there are a million people.  Not a good time for my homebody babies. So we walk around, eat some food.  They have this stupid train ride for kids, my 2 year old is completely train obsessed. My inlaws keep asking him ""do you want to ride the train?!"" With zero intention of riding the train.  They just expect a 2 year old to wait and look forward to a train ride AS IF A TWO YEAR OLD HAS THE ABILITY TO DO THAT! So of course he freaks every time they ask and there is no train ride. I tell my husband if they ask him one more fucking time I am taking my kid directly to the train and then we are going fucking home. 

So they ask him again, and I am like just go to the train! So we go.  The kid rides the train and is happy, but he is exhausted.  We head back to the cottage because I am fucking done and it's time to go home.  2 year old screams for the entire 15 minute walk. We get to the cottage and my husband says, yeah we are leaving.  So my 10 year old goes into the cottage to get his stuff with my FIL and comes out crying.  Like WTF.  FIL looks pissed and I don't even care. 

Turns out my FIL tells my 10 year old that he wanted to take him to dinner and back to the strip but the only reason we are leaving is because his brother is screaming.  Fuck you! We are leaving because we NEVER planned on staying anyway! Your plans don't matter to me, especially since you have not even said a thing to us about them nor do they take into account two babies who are exhausted and hysterical! 

It took me 5 hours to get my kid to tell me why he was teary eyed all night.  Fuck that guy!  I usually let his bullshit go, like when he says fucked up stuff about politics or picks on my husband because he isn't the tradesman that he wanted but a computer geek.  But this shit takes the cake.  It'll be a while before we see them again that's for sure.  

I can't seem to relax, and I start work this week too.  I don't want to work but we are broke.  I don't want to work in retail during Christmas but I have to because I need to work around my husbands shifts and I am SUPER stressed about it.

I have seen on another post recently where people will use a stick blender to mash up the tomatoes before canning.  I liked this idea so I went with that method.  I boiled it for the correct amount of time but it just seems really watery.  I am pretty used to store bought tomatoes and they are a lot thicker when opening.  Is this just the way it supposed to be?  Will it thicken when it cools?  Did I do something wrong?

Its at a retail store.  I have not worked in retail for almost 20 years, so I am stupidly nervous about it. 

I have never been nervous for a job interview.  I guess its probably because I haven't worked in over 2 years and that I really want to get a part time job to get out of the house and if I don't get this job I will be super deflated.   It will only be 20-25 hours a week, and it would only be for probably just above minimum wage, but I want to feel like I am accomplishing something for my family.    Our budget is $200 short every month.  I make it work somehow by piggy-backing over months and our bills are never late, but that leaves zero money for anything else.  No date nights, no fun stuff, I had to borrow from the electric bill to get my 10 year old new shoes for school. 

This little part time retail job would save us financially.  I would be able to get out of the house for a few hours a week and on the weekends and feel like a human being again and not a maid to small mental patients who don't speak English.  We will have money to hire a babysitter and go to dinner and feel like a couple again, not just slaves.  

Its 12:30 and my interview is at 3. I am all dressed and ready already and I want to just go and drive around until I have to go in there because driving makes me calm, but my husband worked an overnight shift last night so we could, y'know, be able to buy food next pay period.  So I am alone until he wakes just before I leave.  Kids are napping so at least there is that.

But super tight now.  I am looking for work, the problem with me looking for work is I am only qualified to make like $15 an hour... but if I am going to work and put the kids in daycare I have got to make a minimum of $17 an hour.   Like on what planet is that going to happen?   My husband is passing my resume around at his ""Corporate Giant"" of a company and seeing if anyone will bite because they pay very well even for their lower positions.  They will look past no college degree over experience and they seem to be perfectly happy to hire family members of other employees as favors. 

BUT I don't WANT to work full time, but like woe is me right?  If we want to eat, and be able to like buy things, and live in a building with a roof on it, then I have to work.  

My resume is great, my husband has looked at it and he has no idea why I haven't gotten any interviews.  I know why...  One, because I don't have a college degree. Two, because I have been out of work for 2 years and three, because I am applying outside my skill set.   You see for the past 8 years I have been a mortgage servicer... no one even knows what that is.   Because all the huge companies that service mortgages like Wells Fargo and Bank of America have huge centers for mortgage servicing and none of them are anywhere near where I live.   I have done mortgage servicing for small Credit Unions or mortgage companies with in house portfolios of like 2000 loans.  I have been the ONLY servicer for these companies, with me doing 100% of the work, and being responsible for the well being of 2000 mortgages.  Mortgages don't take care of themselves like car loans, they have to be babied.  

But there is no mortgage servicing work around here and I do not want to be a processor, or a closer or any other of the million steps in the mortgage process because this industry is unpredictable and every single person I know that works in it has been laid off at least 3 times in the last 8 years... no fucking thanks.   I want something with some semblance of stability. 

So barring me miraculously getting a full time job with decent pay I am trying to wrap my head around working retail on the weekends.  I have no problem with retail, I kind think part time retail might be fun, as I used to do way back when... but I am very very conflicted with giving up my weekends with my family, particularly my 10 year old who is only here half the time.   

Money sucks.  

But the only thing that is keeping me going in this bullshit situation is that on Saturday I am spending the day with my best friend... my best friend since I was 13, the only other woman on the planet who seems to WANT to be my friend and doesn't think I am some kind of loud mouthed, crass, inappropriate, trucker vocabulary using, crazy person.   My husband is meeting her for the first time on Saturday and I said... just wait until you meet her...she is so sweet you will have no idea how this relationship works.  And he said... ""Well, I bet she just gets you, thats what I see in other women... they don't 'get you'""  and he is right.  She is my hetero life mate and I can't believe we lost 15 years together!

We desperately want our own room back, not to mention on the 2 days a week when husband works from home I have no place to put him down for a nap because we retired the baby swing a few weeks ago. 

We have two cribs in the toddlers room, one has been turned into a toddler bed for the toddler, but the other one the baby refuses to sleep in because he is scared to death to be in the room alone with his brother.  Understandable considering the one time we did manage to get him to sleep in there his brother threw a book at his head while he was sleeping.  There is nothing in his room... I don't even know where he got the book to begin with!

Anyway, yesterday I tried again to have the baby sleep in his crib in their bedroom.  He went to sleep just fine but when it was time to put the toddler down for his nap a half an hour later it went great, left the room and it was quite for about 20 minutes, until the baby started screaming bloody murder.  The toddler woke him up and he realized he was alone with him. 

So my 10 year old... this kid is a friggin unicorn always has been, his heart is bigger than he is, says.  ""Mum, why doesn't Isaac move into my room""  What? You want to share your room with a baby?  ""Well he only sleeps in there right? and I am at dads most of the week, its not really a problem and I want him in there""

So the baby moved into the 10 year olds room last night in the pack and play just to test it.  We had our room to ourselves for the first time in 2 years and baby slept until 7am... SEVEN, he has been up before 6am every day of his life, and he slept ""like a baby"" in his brothers room.   We are moving his crib in there this weekend.

My name is Sharla I live in the Northeast US and I am a SAHM and I am 36 years old.  I had originally planned on only staying home for a year, but here we are over 2 years later.   I have three children all boys.  Oldest is 10, then a 2 year old and a 1 year old.  Two youngest are 13 months apart.  Oldest two were fertility clinic babies and the last little one was a surprise oops.   

I have known my husband for 15 years, together for 9 and married for 5.  He is my soul mate and the best thing that has ever happened to me. He was at, and even IN, my first wedding (drama bomb!) and I may or may not have left my exhusband for him.  We were long distance, living in different countries and time zones, for the first year of our 'official' relationship while I started my divorce. (He jumped country when I got married the first time)  I am pretty much obsessed with him like a teenager school girl, even after almost 10 years. It helps that he is just as obsessed with me.

For a bit of history:  Normal childhood with divorced parents, grew up in a suburb of Boston MA.  Moved out of my mom's house on my 18th birthday and have been on my own or living with a boyfriend or husband every since.  I did not go to college and I worked in the banking industry on the Mortgage side of things.  I have been engaged three times and married twice.  Oldest son is from my first marriage and was a year old when I left his father. 

I am a great cook. I crochet when I am not too tired and I read a ton. I recently got into canning and have like 30 jars of pickles in my basement right now.

I complain all the time that it takes me forever to clean because I have a 2 year old and a 1 year old and I can barely leave them alone for 5 seconds before the 2 year old is trying to kill the 1 year old.  So while they are eating lunch or one of the two is napping I try to clean up the kitchen.  Most days it just gets surface cleaned, table cleared, counters wiped, that kind of thing.  If I am feeling super ambitious I will wash the kitchen floor.  

So my husband gets up this morning and is getting ready for work.  He is stomping around here like some kind of asshole so I ask him why he is so cranky.   I even go up to him to give him some sexy kisses and he just looks at me with this shit face and says ""This place is fucking disgusting!""  Yeah no shit asshole.  NO ONE helps me clean thats why, and I watch two babies all god damned day.  Ever think of helping?  Sweeping maybe?  CLearing off the counter you just fucked up with all that shit you just put there?   How about the food wrappers or dirty dishes you left on the table?  No?  THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!

If you don't help you don't get to fucking complain. How bout that?   

School doesn't start until the 29th and my oldest is home and grounded from all his stuff so he is watching the kids while I deep clean the kitchen.  I guarantee that it will be a fucking gross mess by tomorrow afternoon because no one gives a shit about it other than me, except when it gets out of hand because its been a few weeks and surface cleaning only goes so far. 

OH did I mention that I only go into our bedroom to sleep.  There is probably 4 articles of my dirty clothes on the floor, the rest of the room looks like some bachelor pad gross bullshit.

Some people might see that as me being online all day and ignoring my children, some of you probably wonder what the hell I do all day if I am a SAHM who has so much time to post things online.  

Well.. Its because my entire life, every single day from when the sun comes up until it goes down is me alone with my 3 kids and husband.  From 9am-6pm its just me and two babies who barely talk. The only person who texts me is my husband... not even a lie.  Maybe twice a week I get short little texts from my mom and my step mom, but its usually asking some question about the kids, like what they want for their birthday.  That's it.  There is literally no one else. Its me, all day every day alone. 

My husband, works.  He has made some really great friends at work.  He has a group of people who has a chat going with all day, it used to be called the 'bro chat' and now it has chicks so its just like 12 friends that work together and have a funny fun chat all day while they talk to people about their computers.  He literally socializes all day everyday.  Not even just in the lunch room but the entire 9 hour day. 

They go out to dinner often, having taco Tuesdays.  He works for a large corporation that literally every single person on this site has heard of.  They are large and global.  They have team building dinners, like tomorrow is one of their outings.  His department is going out to a pub having some food, they get paid for this.   Then, afterward he tells me that one of the guys is having a party.    Great, I ask him if he plans on going.  

I have never told him he couldn't go to things.  As a matter of fact whenever these things come up I am the first to be like... ""Dude go! Have fun! You need to socialize, its good for you, friends are good for you!""  Sometimes I am the one that has to convince him to go.  I know lonely and I don't want that for him. 

So lets keep in mind that I just heard about this outing on Monday, even though he surely knew about it for weeks, and that the party afterwards I just heard about a little less than an hour ago. 

So I say, I dunno how I feel about the after party for two reasons.  One, I have to drive him and pick him up.  I don't even want to think about the meltdown that is my 2 year old when we pick up daddy, drive all the way home only for him to leave again, doing dinner alone with 2 babies and a 10 year old and then handling bed time alone.  If he didn't take our car he has no way home after.  The dinner and bed time doesn't really bother me, I have done it before alone, its not that bad. 

and reason #2.  I am lonely.  I have been having a hard week with the kids, every day is stressful because the 2 year old is literally constantly trying to kill the 11 month old.  I am constantly pulling the older off the younger, catching him banging the baby's head on the floor, STANDING ON HIM, kicking him... all of it.  Its constant.  I separate them a lot but I cant keep the separate all day.   I have no one.  I feel like a hostage or a person on house arrest in solitary.  

I haven't had any fun in months, or years I dunno which one.  I haven't had a conversation with anyone but my husband or MIL or mom since March. MARCH.  

So back to the title.  I tell my husband this, that I have no one and that yes I want him to have fun and if he wants to go he should absolutely go.  But that I am feeling a little jealous and sad and I explain how he socializes and I stare at the wall.  He comes out with ""I cant even go do anything without you making me feel like shit about it"" He blew up on me like I am some kind of controlling bitch.  I was like... Uh no.  I always support you and encourage you to go out..ALWAYS.  This is literally the very first time I have said anything like this.  

I guess I will just smile and play like I am happy, because my feelings of unhappiness are just me attacking him apparently.   Maybe I should get a skirt and apron and some pearls and just be done with it.

Ever couple of minutes he will try to climb over my laptop and head butt me.   I have thought in the past that this kind of behavior is because he wants attention, but I have since found that he just finds kicking me and punching me and headbutting me hilarious.    He has been like this all day.  If I sit down to play with him, instead of playing he kicks me and punches me.  If I push him away he concentrates his pushing and kicking onto his baby brother.  

Baby brother is gated into the playroom right now to protect him.  He is having a blast having all the toys to himself.   

I am sitting here being hit and not doing anything about it because I just cant anymore today. I give up and I am completely defeated by a 2 year old.   I am ignoring it and pretending he isn't there waiting for him to get bored and leave.  

I am going to cook dinner shortly and then husband will come home and we will eat and then take the kids and go somewhere to go for a walk while its still summer and possible.

But I need advice on the fight with my mom...

So some back story.  My mom has been seeing a naturopath for a few years.  During her time with this woman she had decided to become an herbalist.  Great.  Whatever makes you happy.   I have been super supportive of her.  Showed entusiasm when she gets excited about a new tincture she is making, gone to her house and seen her collection of herbs in jars of high priced vodka...awesome mom! You do what makes you happy!

Over the last 5 years whenever I see her she is offering me some natural remedy for stuff, like anything at all.  Its constant, its every single time I see her.  I usually say ""Oh yeah? Thats cool"" and then change the subject.  Recently since she has been doing this herbal stuff she is even more agressive about it. She has convinced several of her friends to ditch western medicine all together and get these tinctures from her as well as convincing people to see her naturopath.  Fine, that is their decision. 

So yesterday she comes and stops over, and I am already on edge because I am not feeling 100%, which is the reason I got an appointment with an endo.  So I tell her that I am waiting on a referral to an endocrinologist.

She starts in on ""I can make you something that will make you feel better, you don't even need to see a doctor!""  

My response as always was polite.  ""No thats ok mom, I am just going to go to the endo and see what he says""  

She keeps on ""My friend wont even see a medical doctor anymore! they are idiots and have no idea what they are doing! You should really see my doctor!"" 

""Mom, You know I cant go see your doctor, insurance doesn't cover her (uh...duh, because she isn't a real doctor!) and I don't have $500 to blow""  

""You should really find the money, you don't need medication you need herbs""  

So I lose it, seriously... ""Mom, stop pushing this, I don't believe that what you are pushing on me works.  I have always been respectful of your interest in it but you need to be respectful of my non interest in it""

""You have no idea what you are talking about, you haven't even tried it. It WILL work""

""No, mom, it wont.  Like I said, I need you to respect that I do not believe in that kind of stuff, you need to respect that.  I have been nothing but supportive for years, you need to let it go""

Well the conversation went a little longer than that and she kept insisting, I kept telling her no until I just fucking lost it and she stormed out.   My husband, who has witnessed her pushing this shit on me for years said that he was amazed I had been so patient with her over the years and he was surprised I hadn't flipped out sooner. 

I feel guilty though, like should I have yelled?  Probably not.  But should I apologize?  I feel like I should, but also that I shouldn't.  She is extremely manipulative when it comes to these things and she would never admit wrong doing.  I think that I feel bad about the interaction only because she is my mom, because I would not feel guilty about it if it was anyone else.

Seriously. Sick of it.  I have had PCOS since I was 13, there is really no effective across the board treatment for PCOS, like they can give you birth control pills to clear up that 24/7/365 period, they can give you metformin for that insulin resistance, they can give you spironolactone for acne and that fantastic lady mustache. And they can do all sorts of stuff to get you pregnant. No one can touch the fatigue,or the general feeling of being unwell.  

Recently had some blood work and I was told I was borderline hypothyroid.  Sure...just another thing.  I looked up the symptoms, awesome.  The memory loss? Yup.  Sudden weight gain? sure why not.  Itchy as hell skin? Fantastic.  Oh...is that why my hair is falling out? I thought that was the PCOS. No sex drive? check. Pretty much ever single symptom... all of them.  And this one new this week! HUGE swollen ankles, way bigger than they ever got when I was pregnant.  So uncomfortable. I have a call in to my doctor about that, waiting to see what time they want me to come in tomorrow. 

I feel like crap.  I am depressed about this whole situation.  I am sad all the time.  I am a terrible mother.  My 11 month old fell off the changing table yesterday.  My house is a fucking mess.  My 2 year old is a hell child.  My 10 year old is barely hanging on emotionally in his early puberty state. My husband is not supportive in this at all.  

Last night I asked him why he had not taken the large amount of cardboard boxes that I broke down and folded neatly out to the trash on trash day, when I have asked him every trash day for the last 5 weeks.  He says ""Well if you want something done, there is no reason why you can't do it yourself!""  Just like last week when I asked him to help me pack me, him and our three kids up for a 4 day vacation in the mountains and he told me ""Why didn't you get up earlier to do this?""  Its like... why? What does that matter?  Why do I have to get up earlier to do ALL the work when you could just as easily help me and we can both get it done in half the time?  Why do I have to do ALL of it?  Why doesn't he need to help?  

I told him that when he wants to have sex he can just take care of that, because why should I have to do anything when he can just do it himself?  The logic is his not mine. 

Editing to add:  My mom just came by, I told her about the doctor and she again AGAIN tried to push her herbal tinctures on me.  Saying that I shouldn't even being seeing a medical doctor and that I should be paying $300 out of pocket to see her naturopath. No.  I have never been disrespectful of her herbal non traditional medical beliefs.  I have always been supportive.  But every single time I see her she goes on and on about how I need to use herbs and not trust western medicine.  NO NO NO! SO I fucking lost it.  After politely declining at least 5 times in 5 minutes I fucking lost it.  I yelled at her to respect my non beliefs in her 'medicine' the way I respect her belief in it.  Her response ""Well how will you know if you dont try it?"" ""You could at least try it""  ""Why wont you just try it!""  So after me yelling at her to stop it she stormed out crying... fine.  You throw a fit because I won't drink your home brew tinctures... sure.

However, today he is working 8-5 and then he took on an overtime shift from 10pm-7am, which means me and the baby are sleeping in the livingroom because his office is in our bedroom. 

Today the baby has his 9 month appointment (yes at 11 months because our pediatrician only works on Fridays and I love her so much I forgive the inconvenience of appointment difficulty) from what I remember there is definitely blood work and shots. 

I also have to put the kids to bed and then take those three hours before I go to bed to clean the fuck out of my house.  My mom is coming here to watch the kids on Saturday night so husband and I can go out and she is a neat freak who will complain about how gross my house is.  Husband can't help because working. 

THEN, next weekend we are going away for our first family vacation as a family of 5 instead of a family of 3.  I have lists and spreadsheets to organize everything that I need to do and pack and bring.  Its only 3 nights, and its in a hotel that has two pools and a playground so it will be ok,BUT we are meeting up with my brother and SIL and their 2 year old whom I was just informed has hand foot and mouth, he will most likely be better by next Saturday, but we are going to be super diligent about the kids interactions and not sharing cups and I am grabbing some of those disinfecting wipes for hands, there will be a lot of wiping.  So thats just another thing I have to worry about.   Their poor kid is always sick, I dunno, he needs more vitamin C in his life or something!

Now, don't get all hate on her because she is an awesome woman, and you know what?  I don't babysit either... no one, not friends, not family... nope, not a chance.  The ONLY time I babysit is for my sisters 13 year old because thats barely doing anything... so yeah, no little kids no babies.   So because of my no babysitting rule we barely ever ask anyone to watch our kids, with the exception of my husband parents because they would rather our kids live with them than with us, so they jump at any chance to take them no matter what. 

Ok, moving on.... Now don't hate on me but my husband and I have gotten into Pokemon Go, because I am fat and I need to walk around for hours and if I can collect stupid game characters while I am doing it I have motivation.  Last night in our little tiny downtown we walked down to the river and I dropped a lure and we sat, and within 5 minutes people were showing up and we met another couple who have a kid the same age as one of ours.  They told us that there was going to be a huge walk in Portsmouth on Saturday night.   So, they invited us to go... we are like... ugh...no babysitter.  So as a complete desperate move I sent the text message to my mom ""Uh... is there any way you would want to babysit the kids at my house Saturday night from like 6-10pm?""  an HOUR later I get ""Sure!"" 

WHAT?!  My mom never leaves the house really... just to go to work, let alone leaves the house after 9pm... I am kind of stunned and very grateful.  I am super excited to just walk around downtown Portsmouth with my husband doing something silly, and maybe popping into a bar for a drink.  

Also... there seems to be a lot of hate for Pokemon Go (I get it, because there are people out there being dumb asses about it).

Edit: HAHA, my mom actually asked what we were doing so I told her we were going to play pokemon.  She is like ""I heard that's a dangerous game!""  Yeah... its only dangerous if you do dangerous things... like, you wouldn't walk across the street without looking would you?  Or would you normally trespass into someones back yard?  Or visit a secluded spot alone?  Or go walking in dark places at night alone?  No.. no you wouldn't.  But some people still do those things even without a game to play.

She has been on our coast since Sunday, and she is leaving for New Zealand on Sunday.  So because we are caring relatives and her and my husband are super close we are at my inlaws for the weekend. 

I spent the entire day packing up all the things we need to be away for the weekend with two under two, a 10 year old and a husband.  I did laundry, I packed the van, I got gas, everything I would need so we could leave the second my husband got out of work. My husband, who worked from home today, just had to pack his own bag.  It would have taken all of 5 minutes, with him already working in our bedroom and all, you would think he would have done it... Nope.  Packing in a hurry when there are two cranky babies who just want dinner and to hang out in the living room with mom and dad before bed like always, is not ideal.  It's rage inducing. 

I put the 10 month old in the van, I see my husband bringing out the 23 month old with one shoe on.  Where the hell is his other shoe? ""I thought you packed it"". Why the fuck would I pack one shoe?  So the kids whine the entire hour drive, they refuse to eat, and by 9pm they both refuse to sleep.  My husband just left to go to pick up MIL and SIL from the bus station because they spent the last two days in NYC and now the babies are finally asleep and I am sitting in their living room alone with the tv. 

My 10 year old is pissed and cranky that it's going to be 60 degrees and raining all weekend and he can't go in the pool, as if the weather is somehow my fault.   So now it's going to be 2 days of entertaining 2 babies and a 10 year old stuck in the damn house with nothing to do.  Just kill me.  

And then through all this there is the fact that my SIL is moving to Fucking New Zealand and it will probably be years before we see her again.  I may not see her very often but I really like her! She is a tornado, never tells you she is visiting until she is on a plane and you have to pretty much rearrange your life at the last minute to see her, but despite that I genuinely enjoy her company! She is going to miss most of my babies lives, more so than when she lived in California. My husband is completely heartbroken by this, they are their parents only two children.

Now, its fine for shopping, or regular short walks down grandma's relatively flat street. But we live in a very hilly town, we like to walk trails, and that duoglider is shit on slanted old sidewalks.  

We are looking for a side by side double jogger.  Our price range is $250 max.  

So.. we are looking at the [Babytrend Continental](https://www.babytrend.com/joggers_double/DJ96181.html) My husbands favorite for the single front wheel.

[Babytrend Navigator](https://www.babytrend.com/joggers_double/DX60402.html) I had a single version of this when I had my first 10 years ago and I loved it, but I don't know how different the double would be compared.  

And last but not least the [Joovy Scooter x2](http://joovy.com/scooterx2/) I like this one because it has that bar across the front and also because its super cool looking...

So now on to the questions.  When I had a babytrend years ago that was a single, we had no problem wheeling that thing over relatively flat forest paths and up over hills and grass and it was super stable.  The double version of that has 2 front wheels and my husband is worried about maneuverability in that kind of environment with two wheels and is pro single front wheel, but I think it would be good because more stability up front with the two wheels. 

The Joovy has double front wheels but they are small, and probably would only be good over city streets and parks. 

We do not jog, we just walk a lot and visit more rugged settings, so there would be no active running with it so thats not a factor.

So a whole day of this gets to him and he is a miserable mess by the end of the day, basically screaming and crying whenever his brother comes near him. 

The 10 year old, with only 4 days of school left comes home crying today because he is being bullied on the bus.   I know my kid is going to get bullied, you can tell by his personality. He is sensitive, but he is also a smart mouthed jerk, so... y'know.   I feel terrible, but I don't think that there is a lot I can do about it other than give him the tools on how to deal with it.  He refuses to even talk to me about it so I don't even have the information to go to the school with, but I know he will tell my husband (his stepdad) about it, because he always opens up to him. 

I have a feeling that I might be depressed.   I just don't know how to handle this stay at home mom thing anymore.  I think of going to a moms group but then think about how difficult it is to just go to the store with two kids and cant even imagine a situation where I can watch my toddler and my baby at the same time.  My toddler is not easy, he is a runner, as in his legs are already pumping before his feet even hit the ground and he doesn't listen.  How am I even supposed to handle going to a park with him?  The only park in my town that is suitable for his age and is gated is closed everyday from 8am-6pm during the week because its at the rec center, and that is where the rec center summer camp is held. 

I feel like everyday that goes by when the kids go to bed and the house is quiet that I just ran a marathon where at every mile marker someone was there waiting to punch me in the face.  I have no life, I have no purpose other than to keep these kids alive, and I am barely doing that.  Everything I do seems pointless.  I cant even sit down and play a game with my kid because no matter what it is, 2 seconds in he is throwing everything at my face and jumping all over me.  Playing with him is not fun, its painful.  He doesn't respond to distraction or punishments, timeouts or smacks on the butt, he does not care.  He laughs it all off and goes back to what he is doing.  

I am having no luck trying to teach him anything at all, I want to put him in 2 day a week daycare just to see if someone else has any luck teaching him anything at all.  But we cant afford it. $190 for 2 days just seems ridiculous to me.  No matter how many times a week I go over the budget and rework everything, try to cut spending, nothing works.  

I cant even get a job! $290 for each kid a week for full time daycare! That is $580 a week.  If I do the math on what I am capable of earning after taxes its $520 a week take home and that is a high estimate.  I feel like there is no relief for me.  That I am going to be stuck in this miserable rut dragging my poor kids along the way.  

There is no end in sight, not for anther 4 years at least when these two little kids are in regular public school.  4 years. What am I supposed to do with that?    

There is no help for me, obviously my husband works full time plus overtime, everyone I know works full time, everyone.  All family members, all friends every soul that I know.   I am just stuck here everyday, in my 2 room prison. Waiting out the days, counting the hours until bed time.  How is this a way to live?

However, I have always wanted one of those spider plants that has the white stripes.  My mom had one that was huge and always had a ton of babies hanging off of it.   I have been saying it for years.  

So I was at my husbands godmothers house and she has two of the most beautiful spider plants I have ever seen.  We had just moved into an apartment that has a ton of light so I asked her if she would give me a few babies to plant.   So she took about 6 babies off of each plant, one totally green and one green with white stripes and planted them for me. 

Well I brought them home and my cat proceeded to basically eat them down to grass.  I was determined to save these plants.  I went to ikea, and got some hanging pots and replanted what was left of these sad sorry stumps of baby plants.   I managed to get 4 out of the green one and two out of the white one. 

Well all of the green plant survived, its looking good. Hanging in my livingroom.   Only ONE of the white plants survived and I have been taking extra care of it, making sure it watered properly and that its getting enough sun, all of that.   It is finally at a stage where its starting to really become something, its got like 9 leaves now, a few are really long. I am so excited.  

I tell my husband that when the weather is consistently warm I am going to move them both out the the screen porch.   So one day I get out of the shower and he says  ""I moved your spider plant out to the porch""  I was like dude... I am not ready to move it! Not until its consistently warmer at night! Bring it back in please.   So he brings it back in...

Now three of the long leaves are broken.... THE FUCKING PLANT WAS FINE BEFORE HE MOVED IT. 

He knows how much I have gone through for this stupid plant.  And then he goes and breaks three of the 9 leaves on it and I am just stupidly heartbroken.  I know its just a plant, but I saved that thing from the brink.  I was so proud of it, so excited to finally have one.  

I know it will be fine and just grow new leaves, but it took me probably 10 months to get it to where it is now.  ",breakingmom,Seriously... just don't touch my stuff!,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/4navuu/seriously_just_dont_touch_my_stuff/

So like 10 doctors, fertility specialists, endocrinologist.. all of them over the past 22 years, and the best thing they can offer me is fucking metformin or birth control.   And birth control is the one with the least amount of side effects for me.   The one side effect that I hate about birth control.... rage.  

Its going to destroy my marriage and it makes me a terrible mother.   The stronger the hormones the worse the rage.  The problem there is I need birth control with strong hormones or it doesn't fucking do anything.   

The shitty thing is, the only thing I hate about the PCOS enough to do anything about it is that I don't want to have my period every day of the year.  That's it.  I can deal with the mustache and the beard, the fatigue and the weight gain.  I can not deal with bleeding every single day.  I can't.  The last time that happened I was suicidal. 

BUT no one will approve a hysterectomy for me.  I don't want the stupid ovaries gone, I just want the uterus to go.  I don't need it... its fucking up my life and happiness and I have to take hormonal birth control at 35, which I am not completely comfortable with the risk of that.  But what else can I do?

We went to eat, we drove around and ended up at this farm in our area that recently built a farm store.  We walked around we looked at the veggies, the awesome cheese selection, and then we went home. 

So today I looked at my facebook messages for like shits and giggle and did you know that if a person who is not on your friends lists messages you, you do NOT get a notification?  So there is a message request... So I click on it.  Its an old friend, and she says ""I think I saw you at (farm market) on Saturday, So I thought I would say Hello""

WTF...

Now full disclosure, lets put a back story on this shit shall we?  I am the bad guy in this story... I will fully admit that upfront. 

We met in 8th grade, she lived down the street, we became super duper best friends fast because we were both new at the school. So we were super best friends... I moved away in the middle of 9th grade and we lost touch. 

Fast forward 6 years I am 19 and I am working at Ames and one day she just.. walks in.   We hug it out, and we start talking again.  Weirdly enough that week my boyfriend, who I was living with, up and moved out of our apartment while I was at work, shutting the phone and electricity in the process.  I had to walk to a payphone and the only person I could think to call was her.  

She comes and picks me an all my stuff up at midnight.  Takes me to her house that she lives in with her brother and father. Her father says I can stay as long as I want, even gives me my own room.  A week later... My friend MOVES OUT! Went to live with her boyfriend.  Leaves me living with her brother and father.  It wasn't that big of a deal. 

So I start working for her father, he was a carpenter that did custom work.  So I start running errands for him, helping him sand things and stain things.  Helping him at clients houses with clean up and supplies shuttling... We work together every single day for a year... my pay is basically room and board. 

We get too close. Inappropriately close.  We end up being together for almost 2 years if you can believe that... Age difference was 26 years, so I was 20 and he was 46.  So obviously we break up eventually, because HELLO! And he didn't like it, so he basically threw all my stuff on the lawn in the night and that was it.  I never talked to him, or her again.  That was 15 years ago. 

So I am going through a plethora of emotions right now.  Its like being hit with a ton of bricks.  She said she saw me but froze and couldn't say anything.  I understand that, I pretty much did the same thing when I saw that she messaged.

So far its been a few hours of awkward small talk over facebook messanger... I don't even know how to feel right now.  I wish I could hug her.

Its like... you ever have one of those friends who you think about all the time and wonder what would happen if you ever found each other again?  Met by chance in the grocery store or walking through the mall?   This is twice now with this girl... 

I want to hug her... I want to talk to her like we always did, long conversations in the front seat of her car drinking coffee and chain smoking.  But right now its just small talk through a computer screen.  ",breakingmom,"Ever think to yourself, remember that friend I had...

Its been a long time since husband and I have had a day to ourselves to just go on a drive, or to fart around a farmers market.  Tomorrow is that day.  

BUT, I am afraid something is going to ruin it.  Or my sister is going to call us back early because my 22 month old is an insane person.  I don't think she fully understands how crazy he is.

He hits me when I say no, he bites me when I say no, hell, he bites me for anything at all.  He will sit with me on the couch and proceed to kick me and dig his fingernails into me, hit me etc.  He tries to lie on top of his 9 month old brother, he kicks him, he pinches him, he stomps on his hands, hits him in the head with toys.  

You can not put him down in a store an have him hold your hand, you cant put him down anywhere except his own house or he is off like a rocket.  He refuses to hold your hand and if you do hold it he is one of those kids that screams ""Ow! Ow! Ow!"" trying to get the attention of other people around him with a ""Look she is hurting me!"" thing. 

He has to be strapped into the stroller anywhere we go, or a shopping cart when we are out shopping.  We cant take him to the older kids school stuff like band and chorus concerts, the only place we can take him is the sport practices because there is a large expanse of park area he can run and we can chase. 

He is currently locked in the playroom, well its gated, he can see me.  THere are enough toys in there to fill a preschool so he is good to go.  He is currently playing quietly, as I need a break from the constant slaps, kicks and bites. And frankly so does his baby brother. 

My first child was not a 'toddler'  he was well behaved for a 10 year old at 2, he never got into anything he shouldn't have, he never required baby gates or child locks... I have no experience with this kind of child.  

We try distraction and that does not work, he is very stubborn and when he sets his mind to something he will insist on doing it.  We have to remove him from situations constantly.

He wants me to wake up one morning with a libido that wont stop and an affinity for extreme kink and everything would just be perfect for him... and for some reason he believes that badgering and guilt tripping is a sure fire way to make this happen. 

And before everyone suggests therapy.. it ain't happening.  Not only do we have no time or money to attend, he wouldn't give a shit anyway.  If he isn't going to listen to me about my feelings, why is he going to listen to anyone else.

Like right now. SOMETHING in my house smells.  I cant fucking find it.  Its making me insane.  I thought it was the litter box, because it was coming from the room that the litter box is in. Changed the litter, nope not that.  Opened the window in there, maybe air out the kitchen and it will go away.  NOPE.  The window is just spreading it around the house. Dirty dishes in there? Not that either. For a visual, the house I live in is a 110 year old duplex.  It was originally built without indoor plumbing.  So at some point someone walled off the end of the kitchen split it in half and made a bathroom and a small room with the kitchen sink in it, which is were we keep the litter box.  

No one else can smell it.  So no one else can help me find it.  Its infuriating! My husband thinks I am insane.  Tonight after my sons karate class I am emptying that room and basically hosing it down with bleach... I cant take this.  It better solve the problem or I am going to start sleeping in a tent in the backyard or something.  

Edit... I THINK it may have been solved.  I found a clove of garlic on the floor, kind of under the fridge, so like not pushed all the way under but I couldn't see it just standing in front of it.  It still had the the natural paper around it... it didn't smell bad because I held it up to my nose.  But since I threw it away I cant smell it anymore.

Like literally.  There is a pile of dirty dishes in the sink, on the counter next to the sink, as well as on the stovetop.  Dirty dishes everywhere... we dont have a dishwasher... I didn't think it would be a big deal when we moved in here.  I was so wrong. 

The kitchen table is covered in stuff, dirty dishes from breakfast, trash, empty boxes and packing debris. Junk mail scattered across the floor. Food on the floor under the high chair.  Dirty laundry piled in front of the basement door. 

Livingroom looks like a tornado came through, toys everywhere. Clean laundry scattered around the room because that seems to be my 21 month olds new thing.  At least 2 empty bottles, one from this morning and one from breakfast.  Empty sippy cup, ripped up junk mail...how long does it have to be there to be labeled trash and not super fun rippy baby toy?  

I am surrounded.  But I am sick, like head cold, exhausted, stuffy nose, burning sinuses, scratch throat, headache sick.  If I walked into someone elses house that looked like this I would be disgusted.  I am disgusted.  I need to clean, but I dont even want to move, let alone do stuff. 

The tv is on, we are playing all kids tv today, the 21 month old is napping and the 8 month old is legit watching tv because I just cant, and he cant be on this floor... gross. 

My husband is working from home today on a day he would normally go into the office just in case I need help.   He is a good dude. 

This is the very first time I have been sick with 2 under 2... I don't know if I will live through this.  Because when I come out on the other side, I will most likely have 2 sick babies.

Its not like anything big and tragic has just happened or is happening, its just the regular stresses of having 2 under 2 and a selfish husband.

So lets start with the fact that my 9 year old left this morning on a flight to seattle with his father to visit his aunt and her new baby.  Awesome for him I am sure, except I hate when he is flying and I hate when he is so far away from me, so I am kind of bummed about that.

Then, its fucking raining and cold.  For some reason my kids get super cranky, tired and clingy when it rains.  Its like yeah, I know rain sucks but you dont have to be assholes to ME about it. I didnt make it rain!

The 21 month old is a fucking nightmare today, hitting the baby with shit, trying to crush him.  I have had to keep the baby off of the floor so that his brother wont step on him.  The toddler also hasn't eaten anything of substance today because apparently he hates everything and he has had two packages of fruit snacks and like 6 strawberries and its 4:30pm.

The baby, having had to been kept off of the floor all day is pissed off.  He is 8 months old, he doesn't want to just lie down in shit all day, he wants to move around the room!  Touch everything, put everything in his mouth.  He does not want to be in the jumper, not the swing... nothing. He is miserable and I dont blame him.  He wants to learn to crawl, but I would rather he did it while alive.  I have a gate to go across the big door between the living and playroom on order so that I can reliably separate them, but it wont be here for a few more days. 

My husband... well he works from home a few days a week and because we lack space his computer is set up in our bedroom.  Which is fine, except he is a fucking slob.  He leaves trash/dirty dishes/beer bottles all over the place up there, not to mention the mess of all his other stuff all over the place.  I ask him all the time to clean it, and to keep his shit off of my dresser.  I like my dresser clean, with my jewelry box and my baby boxes on top, bad enough we have to put the tv on it, I dont want it covered in his shit either.

So I go up there today and he has cleared all of my stuff off of my dresser and put two tv's on it, so he can play video games and watch tv or whatever at the same time... Its like.. where is my room?  Why is this room suddenly YOUR bedroom.  WHere is my relaxing space to get away from all you assholes at night?  What am I going to do with my stuff?  

Oh I know, I will just put everything of mine in some boxes and put it in the basement and maybe I'll buy a futon for the kitchen because clearly if I want my own bedroom that is the only place for me to do it.  FUCK YOU MAN!

Not only that, because of my murderous toddler I cant leave the babies alone in the livingroom for more than a few minutes at a time and I have to be able to listen for them.  So doing something like washing dishes is out of the question.  Our kitchen sink is an a pantry off of the kitchen and we dont have a dishwasher, so you have to stand there with the running water for a half hour and you cant hear the kids.  And I refuse to do them during nap time because that is the only time I have to take a shower, and then there isn't enough hot water left to do dishes. 

I asked him a few weeks ago to do me a solid, JUST make sure the dishes are done every night before bed, because I just cant do it during the day. He agreed because I make dinner and after dinner we both get a kid and do bed time... i do the baby, he does the toddler. He is supposed to do them after bedtime is done, but I still have to get on his ass about doing it.  Well, he has not done it the past two days and my house smells like a fucking dumpster.  Rotting dirty dishes are stinking up my entire 1st floor.  I took a shower during nap time and then washed a few dishes until the hot water completely ran out.  I know he is going to come down from work at 5:30 and go into the kitchen and start doing the dishes ONLY because he knows I am pissed about it, and then I am going to have to yell at him to stop doing the dishes because SOMEONE has to watch the kids right now because SOMEONE has to cook fucking dinner, because this toddler needs to fucking eat soon or he is going to lose his shit. 

The toddler has been climbing all over me.. right now he is kicking my side as he lies on the couch watching Inside Out.  I am deep breathing trying not to lose my cool. I am completely touched out and I am completely angry at everything.

Like seriously.  I like being home with my kids when they are little tiny babies because I really cant stomach someone else doing the first year.  So the reason I am home still is because we had My second kid BigO with 5 years of fertility treatments and then BOOM 4 months PP I got a surprise natural pregnancy with LittleI, he is only 8 months old now..  

I cant keep doing this. I can not keep staying home but we can not afford $2000 a month on daycare.  If we could afford that amount of money a month we would own a home by now.  But I need to fucking do something else.  

I do love staying home, I dont have anyone to answer to but myself, I don't have to worry that I am fucking up in my job, I dont have to feel like I am letting people down if I call in sick.   But I would rather go out and work and come home and rush to get dinner ready and baths done and feel like my life is in total chaos, I am happiest when my life is controlled chaos.  

I need to be super busy all the time, and I need it to be stuff I cant get out of, like having to get to work or I'll get fired, or having to make dinner in a rush because I have three hungry kids.  I need everything to be on deadline or I will NOT get anything accomplished. 

Not to mention we need the money, my husband just got a promotion but even with that we are still living paycheck to paycheck and buying a house is still going to be a few years and a few raised off.  But I would like to have some money, so that when we need something like my oldest needs a new baseball bat and baseball pants for little league, I dont have to rearrange my entire budget to get those things or 'wait until payday' to do that.  

We have been looking at a way for me to work a part time job, but I am in banking... there are no banking/mortgage jobs that happen after 5pm. I would work part time nights in a call center or something like that but everyone advertises start times at like 6pm, and there is no guaranty that my husband would be home by then so I cant be reliable. 

I just need to do and be something other than 'Mom'  I dont even feel like a real person anymore, I am just an extension of my kids and that feels really shitty.

Today though?  If any of you read my post on the private sub you will know what I have been dealing with today.  I am sad and angry and I have zero patience.  So of course my kids are running a marathon around my sanity and it doesn't look like its letting up. 

Its raining here. My kids, all three of them, are very much affected by the weather, especially rain.  So the 21 month old wont nap, but he is exhausted.  He has been spending the last week trying to actively kill the 8 month old.  He sits on him, he tries to crush him, he threw a 12 inch board book at his head yesterday, he tries to shake him in the jumparoo. Last week he beat him in the head with a wooden fire truck when I looked away for literally 5 seconds.  Its a constant battle.  

The 8 month old seems to have had it with that other kids shit.  He still laughs at him when he talks to him, but if he comes near him with anything in his hand he immediately starts crying.  Poor little thing.  I try to keep them separate as much as I can but there is only so much I can do. 

The toddler refuses to do anything except the few things he isn't allowed to do.  For example, the tv cabinet has three doors on the front.  I have them velcro'd shut.  This has worked for months, but of course he has figured out that he is strong enough to open them.  He opens them, tries to climb in, hangs on the door, puts his toys in, takes out stuff he isn't allowed to play with etc.  (I have to wait until friday to buy child proofing to keep them shut...too long in my opinion)  He gravitates to the one exposed outlet in the room.  Even though there is a small table in front of it and its blocked 90% of the way with a baby pen, he still manages to squeeze in there because he is determined to electrocute himself.  One of the rooms we are confined to all day is a dedicated play room, train table, work bench, 1000s of toys. But nope.  That one outlet and the stupid tv case doors. 

Punishments of any kind do not work, redirection does not work, time out does not work. 

He refuses to actively play with me if I try to play with him.  He will walk away from me, take stuff away from me, throw stuff at me, he doesn't want to play with me, he only wants to play with dad, and I am not dad.  But he doesn't want me doing anything else either.  If I am on my laptop he will close it, rub up against it, try to slam on the buttons, try to climb on my lap, try to touch the screen (its a touch screen laptop). If I put it down and try to give him attention, he again refuses to play with me all over again. Its a dance we do every single day. 

The baby is whiny and tired, refuses to sleep though because rain.  Doesn't want to be on the floor, no swing, no jumparoo, doesn't want to be held, doesn't want to eat.  Just whine and scream.  He just learned how to scream for fun... so we have been doing a lot of that.  

I am taking deep breaths, I am ignoring the tantrums and I am sitting here writing this forcing my body to relax.  I will get through this day, just like I have so many days before it.  Sigh.

My husband and I have been through some rough times, like, not paying the rent waiting to be evicted, empty cupboards,  unemployed rough times.  When we got on our feet finally and we were both working we went through a few years of horrible infertility, and after finally having a baby a few months later had the shock of an unexpected baby, which doubled our expenses and the cost of 2 in daycare made it impossible for me to work.  He has been working insane amounts of overtime, we are talking 20-30 hours a week, just to survive.  And then at the start of the new year his company took away all the overtime and hired a bunch of people instead. Cheaper for them... harder for us.  If this kept up we would be in the negative by next month and no way to pay rent for the month of June.  He only scored two days of overtime in the next 2 months and he only got that because he was pestering scheduling. 

But yesterday his boss pulled him into her office, told him that after 2 years of being basically their best employee, and being unfairly looked over too many times, he got a promotion! With a fucking enormous 12.5% pay raise. TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT!  Oh my god ladies!  He doesn't have to work overtime anymore, and we can pay the fucking rent without issue!  We can go on that planned trip to the mountains this year with my brother, who makes a ton of money, and not feel like the poor people that we are!  We can start paying down our two stupid credit cards and putting money in savings. 

Its about time something amazing happened for him.  He is a good man, a good dad, and he can be a good husband on occasion.  A small weight has been lifted.

Saturday night my husband worked an extra overnight shift from 7:45pm to 6am.  He works from home for the IT helpdesk of a huge corporation that everyone here would recognize if I mentioned it, so they are 24/7/365.  After two years of consistent 10-20 hours a week of available overtime, it just dropped off. We can not survive without his overtime, so he has been pestering scheduling for whatever they have and he takes whats available no matter how shitty.  

So he goes to bed at 6am, and he gets out of bed at noon.  So like 10 years ago my husband went into a pool or hot tub at a gym somewhere and ended up with a case of Tinea, (this is relevant to the story I swear) its reoccurring, and when the weather starts to get warm, he breaks out and then is forced to spend several hours a few days a week covered in selsun blue shampoo.  He decided to do this yesterday because it was Sunday and we usually sit around the house with the kids and do some cleaning on Sundays. 

Now because he slept until noon I didn't get into the shower until 1, so I am in the shower and he busts in to the bathroom and yells ""SERIOUSLY!""  So obviously I am like what the hell?  He says ""My fucking parents just stopped by!""  WTF. No.. not allowed.  My MIL knows that this kind of thing is unacceptable to me, I have told her on several occasions that if they want to come to my house we need notice, I even warned her that they would not be let in. I am a very private person, husband and I are extremely introverted.  I was not brought up in a family where people were allowed to just barge over whenever they wanted. (his family is the type where everyone's house is open all the time 24/7, they all live within a 5 mile radius of each other).  So super brownie points to my husband, because he TURNED THEM AWAY!  

He was like, ""Fuck that! I am in my underwear! covered in blue shit, you are in the shower, kid (9)
 is in his underwear and look at this place! Its a fucking mess!""  They didn't even text us or anything.  They live an hour away.  They were up here because they have been house hunting in our area, so they knew well in advance that they would be up here, and they never once mentioned they would be or asked if it was ok if they could stop by. 

This was a test. I guarantee it.  They have been house hunting up here for almost 2 years.  They want to move closer to their grandkids, which is great and I understand that, but they are assuming that because they will live closer, we are going to have the same open door policy that they have had with the rest of their family.  This was a test to see if they would actually be turned away if they showed up unexpectedly or if they would be let in out of a feeling of obligation and guilt.  Well I am glad I was in the shower and my husband had to make this decision for himself, and he made the right one.   Not to mention he told them I was in the shower, so its not like he obviously consulted me and I had to be the bad guy.  +1 husband

Ok, so bad husband. 

Since my husband has been working at this job, he works 3 days in the office and 2 from home and any overtime he works from home.  The good thing about this job, other than its a fantastic job, is that he is making friends and I love that, because he really needs friends in the area who are interested in the stuff he likes.  So I hear about something he affectionately calls the ""Bro chat"" at work, which started out with like 4 or 5 dudes in a private chat room in his office.  Recently he has been talking about how the bro chat has increased its number and on some days there are like 15 people, including a few women.  

So a few times in the past couple weeks he has been like ""So and so (female coworker) is into this video game! and she is super funny over in the bro chat! She is super awesome!""

Ok fine, I don't care, I know I have nothing to worry about as far as cheating or whatever, but still.  I was like, yeah, shocker there are women who are into video games! Who knew! And he is like, ""Well I have never met any! Where were these girls when I was younger!"" I just looked at him blank faced and he says ""Probably in the house playing video games like I was!"" 

So kind of just laughed it off the first time this conversation occurred, because whatever.  I know my husband, he is shit in social situations and what is acceptable to say to people, even his wife, he puts his foot in his mouth so much its shocking, he cant really help it and is super embarrasses when it is pointed out. 

So then we have this exact same conversation again yesterday afternoon... girl in bro chat... girl likes video games...girl is awesome etc.  I have no idea if he was talking about the same girl or not because I don't pay enough attention to the names he uses. Also he has these new female coworkers friended on facebook and some of the comment on his posts.  

I say to him all enthusiastically ""You know! I cant wait until I go back to work in the fall, and I meet some super awesome guy there and I can not wait until I can come home and brag about how awesome he is to you, and wonder out loud where guys like him were when I was younger!""  -1 husband.

This has required me to sit in the room with him until he falls asleep.  Which takes longer than normal BECAUSE I AM IN HERE! But he doesn't get out of bed and scream at the door when I am in here.

It worked for 2 nights and then today at nap time I hear a huge thud and I go upstairs and the little shit is standing in the middle of the room with the biggest shit eating grin on his face! 

This kid, he is going to be the complete death of me.  I have no idea what to do with him.  He does whatever the hell he wants, if you say no, he laughs in your face.  You can try to redirect him over and over again and he does not give a shit, if he is set on doing something there is no stopping him.  I have currently 4 child gates in my house and I an looking to buy 2 more, I also have a baby pen that I can put him in if I need to change the 8 month old or feed him or basically anything that distracts me from him.  He can climb out of the baby pen too by the way, it just takes more time than just hopping out of the crib.  I am screwed! 

He does stuff like come up to you scream in your face ""OW!"" and then hit you with something.  I mean, at least he warns you that he is about to hurt you?  The other day I had the baby on the floor rolling around having fun.  The 21 month old was sitting with him, being nice and my 9 year old walks in from school.  I am literally 3 feet from the babies, I look up at my oldest because he asks me a question and in that second this kid decides this is a perfect time to REPEATEDLY HIT HIS BABY BROTHER IN THE HEAD WITH A WOODEN FIRE TRUCK!  So now the 8 month old is screaming bloody murder, and the toddler is laughing his ass off. What? Dude! That is so wrong.  Little dude has like 5 little round bruises on his forehead. 

I never leave the house with the kids alone because I cant handle him and the baby out of the house without backup.

He threw basically a 4 hour tantrum at my fathers house on easter because we wouldn't let him play in the dogs water dish.

So I didn't notice because at breakfast I just picked him up by his armpits and put him in his chair, did the same thing when taking him out of his chair and he is in fleece feety PJ's with a busy pattern so there is no visible wet spot, you cant tell just by looking at him.  So, I am like.. whatever, maybe he wasn't wet when my husband got him up. But then I go up to his room to put him down for a nap and his fucking bed is soaking wet! Which tells me that not only was his diaper full when he woke up, his pajamas were wet.  So I message my husband again this time fucking LIVID because this poor kid has been walking around here soaking wet for 3 hours, because I hadn't picked him up to notice, because I assumed his father changed him. This lazy ass who just wanted to leave the house and didn't even bother to tell me that he was wet. 

God, there is no alcohol in the house...and its before noon anyway.

This morning we had to get two cranky babies and all their gear ready for all of us to spend the night at my inlaws.  So I get out of bed and kick into rush mode and take a shower and get everything ready.  I am doing this in a bomb mess of a house, a house that I picked up twice yesterday.  Not only did I pick up twice yesterday I managed to crochet a dinosaur toy as an Easter gift for my 2 year old nephew instead of showing up empty handed on Sunday because I know my brother and his wife will have bought gifts for my kids.  That sounds like a lot accomplished while taking care of 2 under 2 doesn't it? 

So last night while I was putting the finishing details on the dinosaur I asked my husband if he could do some dishes and pick up so we don't have to come home to a mess on Sunday night.  He does the dishes and nothing else and even though I picked up twice yesterday the house is a new mess, you all know how it is.  And he did nothing else.  So my house is a mess, I ask him, why didn't you do this? I was finishing that toy, I didn't ask you to mop the floor or scrub the toilet, just pick up the stuff.  He said I should have planned better and made the toy earlier so that I could have picked up instead of expecting him to do it.  !!!!! For some reason he doesn't see the flawed logic in that, that basically he is saying that I should have planned better so he didn't have to do anything at all, oh well excuse the fuck out of me dude! 

So as we are arguing about this the kids are whiney.  Did I mention we were on our way to the inlaws... To spend the night?! Something he and I both agreed we were NOT going to do, but then he decided at the last minute that yes we are going?! So I say we weren't even supposed to be going to see your family today! We agreed to it, and now I will have to deal with these whiney messes of babies all day! And he says... Get this. 

""You should have NEVER had kids!"" In a tone of complete disgust. 

I don't know about you guys but to me that says ""You are not fit to be a parent""

So now I know how he really feels about me.  So we get to his parents, we bring everyone inside and I left to get coffee.  I haven't decided yet if I should go back now or like 5 minutes before we are expected at his aunts house, which isn't for another 2 1/2 hours.  But right now I am sitting in my car, drinking my coffee, wondering if it's possible to fall out of love with someone in an instant.

Last fall at my kids flag football game I met another mom, her oldest is in the same grade as my oldest.  We had actually met once before at a little league game. She has a younger son who is probably closer to 3 now and I have an almost 2 year old.  I also have a 8 month old.  So we talked at the game, and she came over here with her youngest to play, we have a dedicated playroom so it makes it easier for us to be here, as she lives in a small apartment. 

So after that we texted back and forth a few times but something always happens, sick kids, surprise appointments, you know how it is. So then I hadn't heard from her in a few months.   Yesterday I get a text from her, asking if I was still interested in getting together. I say of course! I am always free, and I am always home, whenever she is available is most likely good for me.  She says ""great! I can probably come tomorrow but I have to double check, I will let you know later tonight.""  Ok great! Then I didn't hear anything. 

I don't know, like whats that about?  If you call someone to invite them out, or basically invite yourself over to someones house how do you just ignore it?  I guess I feel it would be different if I had initially contacted her and asked her to come over and she had said ""Yeah, let me check if I am free"" to be polite y'know?

I am always understanding to parents, I know how unpredictable life gets when you have kids, but its not hard to send a text ""Tomorrow turns out its not going to work, maybe next week""  Seems reasonable, and doesn't take a ton of time to pull of.  Everyone always has their cell phone with them all the time. 

This is actually not the first time this exact thing has happened. Probably something like the 3rd or 4th.   But I wont say anything or complain.

I woke up at 6 this morning with the babies.  I came downstairs passed the 7 month old to his father and jumped in the shower.  After I was all ready I went out to the driveway and cleaned out our trade in, like completely, there was 3 trashbags full of trash/kid stuff/baby trash.  I then drove to the car wash, washed the truck and then vacuumed it out.  I came home at 9:30 ready to leave for the dealership and my husband...surprise, has not gotten the babies ready.   So I throw that stuff together and we go to the stupid ass car dealership. 

We sit down with the dealership dude, who was new, and a young nice dude, and he didn't feel like a sleezy car salesman, so that was pleasant.  My husband tests drives this perfect minivan while I stick back at the dealership with the babies, walking around the lot with the double stroller. 

We sit down to do the paperwork, which takes forever, and then we wait.... we waited an hour.  The longer you sit at the dealership the least likely you are to get a loan... because it takes them a LONG time for them to find a bank willing to give you money.  

So the finance guy comes out, and he looks grim... just like I said in my previous post.  He tells me he has a loan for us, but its for a ridiculous amount of money monthly, and I say no... ""Thanks for trying though!"" and I go to walk away.  He stops... ""Well, let me see what we can do.""  So I sit... he comes back with the same kind of ridiculous price... So again, well thats too bad... maybe next time! and I get up to leave.  Wait... wait... 

So like I said last post our trade in was insanely upside down, we knew that was going to give us problems.  So in the end, I suppose because of my willingness to walk away, we got 50% more for our trade than they originally quoted, and the dealer incentives covered the rest of our upside down loan.  So basically the trade and incentives cleared out the stupid old loan and we still ended up with a loan for less than the list price, and much less than we thought we would have.  

Our payments are a little higher than I anticipated because they made us take a shorter term than I originally wanted..  But they are still manageable. 

We ended up waiting an additional 1.5 hours after the papers were signed to leave.  We did this, at a dealership with 2 kids under 2 trapped in a double stroller with fuck all to do.  

I am sitting at home now, relieve that we got rid of that shitty trade, that was on its last legs with a failing transmission.  I am drinking some craft cider, eating those pink and white frosted animal cookies, and everyone in the house is asleep, its so quiet after a stressful day.

But there is a brand new minivan, with a dvd player and satellite radio sitting in my driveway... so that's pretty awesome.

I hate the general feel of the inside of car dealers.  Why does it feel so uncomfortable and cold, why do they make you sit there for hours?

So.. we have this 2006 Nissan xterra.  We needed a vehicle really badly and we had super horrible credit.  We ended up paying a bit too much and with the super high 'bad credit' interest rate we ended up with we are super upside down on the thing, like..we are talking just under double what its worth.  We were desperate. 

So we have outgrown it by a lot.  We have 3 kids now, as opposed to the one we had when we got the truck, and two car seats and a 9 year old barely fit into the thing.  Like super cramped.  So tomorrow morning we are headed off to one of the two dealerships we are visiting to check shit out and see what we can do. 

I have already applied for a loan through our bank, got one of them stupid pre approvals.  But that loan does not take into account our horrible trade in or our credit.  Just my husbands income, which is way better than it was last year. 

We tried to buy back in September and it did not work, the credit was too bad and we couldn't get a loan with a payment that we were comfortable with.  I mean, they could get us a loan, but the payments were just too fucking high. 

So now, here we are 7 months later and we are trying again.  This time my husbands income has increased by 20K a year and our credit scores have gone from shitty to 'fair'  We really need this.  

I am not looking forward to sitting in a car dealership tomorrow with a 20 month old and a 7 month old while my husband takes a test drive, nor am I thrilled about waiting for a loan denial.

Where your not supposed to play video games or watch tv or whatever, so they have all these little shows at the school.  We always go, every year.   This year was the first year we all went with all the kids.  

So we get there and everything is promising.  Some weird dude with a bunch of tribal like drums is playing some music, the 19 month old is miraculously sitting on dads lap paying attention and I have the 6 month old in the carrier strapped to my chest. 

So we get a good 15 minutes out of it, and the 19 month old wants to run around, so we give him a little room and he starts bothering other kids and other people so we try to reign him in... this is where the tantrum started. 

My husband kept taking him out into the hall, he would run around and then get super mad that he couldn't go back in the room with the drums, so we would go back in a few times, but he threw himself on the floor for the third time bumping his head so my husband and I switched kids.

He held the 6 month old and I stuck the 19 month old in the carrier facing out, where he proceeded to throw a 35 minute tantrum. I am telling you, it is easier to deal with a kids tantrum if they are strapped to your chest facing away from you.  He couldn't do anything except hang there and be insane and I didn't have to have him doing it on the floor in peoples way.   Now, I am standing in the school lobby, with all the PTA moms walking back and forth while my 19 month old loses his shit strapped to my chest. 

The other moms talked to me, tried to get my kid to smile, we talked in scream voices over his ridiculous screams.... for 35 minutes.

I am sitting at my kitchen table now, a little bit beaten, but I survived.  The moms were not mean about it and honestly I wouldn't have cared if they were.  The one that talked to me through the whole thing even invited me to a moms group right in my town that I did not know about.  So thats pretty awesome. 

But I have to keep taking him out, if I dont he will do this until he is 8.  He and I stay at home 90% of the time, he has no idea how to act in a setting like that.

Yesterday I managed to shower, get dressed, clean up a little bit.  I made dinner when I got home from karate class with my 9 year old, I was handling it. 

Today? I wouldn't call this 'handling it' I am sitting in my livingroom on the computer obviously.  Kitchen a mess, still in my PJ's, livingroom completely covered in toys.  19 month old just went down for his afternoon nap, 6 month old is in the pack and play... whining.  I cant do anything for him, he isn't hungry or wet, he doesn't want to be held.  What he wants is to be able to sit up and play like his brother, but he cant... and that really pisses him off. 

I am patiently waiting for my 9 year old to get home from school.  I am ashamed to say that I rely on him more than I should.  He is one of those unicorn kids, he totally has his 9 year old bullshit moments, but I know that if I ask him to watch the babies, he will, without complaint.  He loves to help out and I really have no idea how I would do it without him.  He gets a generous allowance for watching them, and watching his brothers is the only 'chore' he gets paid for... its a big job. 
 
I am home all day with the babies, all day every day.  My husband and I have been talking about getting me back to work.  He can easily get me into his department making almost $20 an hour.  We would have a ton of money, I would have some kind of fucking life.  But I cant manage to convince myself to put the 6 month old in daycare.  So that has been put on the back burner to be discussed in another 6 months. 

I am not one of those moms who plays with their kids.  That makes me sound like an ass, but I am the caregiver, my husband is the playmate.  He would make a great stay at home dad. But he has a higher earning potential than I do.  So, basically the 19 month old plays by himself all day and then plays with dad later.  I will do some things with him, like color with crayons and read a few books a day but I dont play with him a lot. 

I have horrible days, and as much as I want to be a SAHM, I don't think I am cut out for it. I miss working, but then again I dont.  I dont miss having a manager, I dont miss pissing off clients, I dont miss pissed off clients yelling at me, I dont miss worrying about calling in sick when the kids are sick. I dont miss the panic attacks I have every night around 9pm where I go over my day trying to figure out what I might have done that day to get me fired.  The only thing I miss about working being around other adults all day without my kids there. 

The big kid is home... the little one is finally sleeping in his swing and the 19 month old is screaming in his crib refusing to nap.  Well he can stay in there for another 20 minutes, because he will nap if it kills me.  I'm jumping in the shower. I am cleaning the kitchen and I am starting dinner, and I will put a smile on my face and pretend that I am content.

When he was 2 or 3 I could leave him the run of the house and take a shower and everything would be fine when I came out. No kidding, it actually happened.  Great kid. 

Littlest is 5 months old.  Super sweety, major cling to mom issues, and he is so cuddly.  Loves to be with mom, wants mom, mom fixes everything.  

My middle child.. oh boy.  I don't even know.  He is 18 months.  He is awesome, funny and adorable, he is LARGE for his age, like he wears 2T clothes, and he has no idea how big he is, so he is bumbling bulldozer.  He has a very large personality and when we take him places he is 'that' kid.  The one who steals toys, takes drinks from all the other kids sippy cups, is generally insane.  Its hard because he is large for his age, people always assume he is older, and therefor look at me like I am the worst mom ever for not teaching him manners, even though he is only a baby.  

I don't really feel like I have any kind of bond with him.  When he was 4 months old I got pregnant with the youngest, so he didn't get all the attention that he should have gotten because I was sick and the uncomfortable and tired.  But on the lines of that, he never WANTED the attention.  He plays by himself and is cool with that.  He would prefer not to interact with me and he has always been that way.  Very curious in a, when he is a teenager I am going to come home one day to the tv taken apart, kind of way.  He wants to figure things out, all by himself. Help is not wanted and most often results in a fit. 

So on top of this one of the biggest thing is this.  He says 'Daddy', he'll say 'kitty', he says both of his brothers names, he says 'spongebob' he can say 'Choo Choo!' and 'Thomas' because that is his favorite.  He says his grandfather name, he says a lot of things.  One thing he has never said, never not ever?  Mama.  He wont say it, refuses. 

I think this one thing is really holding me back.  I know he can say it.  But he will NOT.  Completely refuses to, and if you ask him to say it he gets furious!   My husband says he understands and he feels bad, but really he shouldn't, its not like he made the kid this way!   He says that even though he doesn't seem to care about me, certain things happen.  Like when I have to leave to bring the oldest to karate he freaks out and screams and when he gets hurt or is upset I am always the first person he runs to.  And thats all true..

I remember when my first started saying 'Mama' it was one of those... well awesome that he can say it but does he ALWAYS have to say it!?  And now this one wont say it at all... its is really hard.  I just want him to call me 'Mama', and the fact that he wont is breaking my heart. ",breakingmom,My middle child...,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/42tl8n/my_middle_child/

I come across as pretty negative, but in reality I am a pretty positive person.  I try to think of the best of my situation at all times.   I usually dont feel like shit about my life, I am usually pretty upbeat about everything.  I have rough days with the kids and usually a trip out or a nice morning sleeping in will take care of it.  I am constantly trying to convince my husband that our life doesn't suck.  He is always complaining about how everything sucks because he doesn't have more money to buy himself toys.  I am always saying, dude, our kids are great, we have a roof over our heads, food in the fridge, all our bills are paid and we are still in head over heals love for each other... what more do you want!?

But today...today fuck everyone and everything. 

I, like most of you, am in a constant battle of dirt vs soap in this house.  Clean the kitchen, satisfied with my work, sit down and 30 minutes later the table is cluttered, someone left their dirty peanut butter knife on the table for me to clean... you get it. 

If I am to spend money on anything I spend it on my kids, or my husband or something that could be used to improve our living situation.  I never spend money on myself, not even for my birthday or christmas.  Everyone got a christmas gift this year, including my husband who got an $80 raspberry pie computer thing he has been talking about for ages.  I got nothing, because there was no more money for me. 

My 5 year anniversary is this Friday.  I actually made a post recently about how much I love my husband, how our relationship was awesome, how much he and I are still in love blah blah gag... and we are..  But, there is no money to spend the day out like we wanted.  My inlaws are taking all three kids and basically all we can afford is to sit with them and the kids at their house, which is so depressing.  I even got my husband and anniversary gift, which I already gave him.  It was one of those photo books you can personalize, I put in it quotes from our old love letters and pictures of us through the last 9 years, telling him how much I love him, he cried like a baby when he read it.   He never even intended to get me a gift, even after I gave him that. 

We recently got him a credit card, so we can start to rebuild his credit.  I told him that for it to work as fast as possible, he needs to use it and pay it off right away, so for like, gas for the car and then I will transfer the money on the statement date, because that is a regular expense I budget for anyway.  Credit cards that sit unused don't help your credit, nor do ones that have more than a 50% balance on them (I mean they do, but 30% is the happy medium).  So why is this relevant?  He got this stupid old laptop no one has been using from work so he can play around with it, but the hard drive is shot.  When he got the credit card in the mail he said ""OOOOHHHH I can put that hard drive thingy on my credit card :D) I was like, dude, we don't have extra money to buy that, something that is basically a toy for you is not a good way to use that card.  So when I told him if we still wanted to go to the museum for our anniversary then we would have to put it on the card, but we could just pay it off next pay period without an issue.($30)  His response ""Ugh... I dont want to go down the road of putting stupid stuff on this card &gt;:("" 

So just incase you missed it:

New hard drive on credit card for his enjoyment, great idea = :D

Only date out in the last 2 years with his wife for your 5 year anniversary, stupid stuff = &gt;:(

I just want to feel appreciated.  I don't want to feel like the lowest man on the pole in the family that I take care of.  I don't work, but I take care of 2 babies all day, I clean, I cook him 3 meals a day because we are on a diet and thats the only way it works.   I pay all the bills and work the family budget. I do 100% of the grocery shopping.   Its not like I am just sitting around doing nothing.  I am the team captain of this family, and I get zero recognition for it.  

The other night in bed I asked my husband.  ""How many times in the last month have you asked me for money to buy that hard drive thing?""  About 20 was the answer.  And so I asked ""How many times in the last month did you ask me if there was money available for you to get me an anniversary gift?""  He didn't want to answer because he knew the answer was zero. 

When I was driving to target today to buy baby formula and diapers, I was in tears the whole way.  I fantasized what it would be like if I got into a car accident, then maybe if I wasn't home for a few days he would see how important I was. (not suicidal...don't worry about me please)

I came home and the kids were napping so I unintentionally passed out on the couch.  My husband knows I am depressed, but when I am depressed he basically treats me like I have the plague and I am intent on giving it to him, so its like angry avoidance. 

I wish I could drink or take something to just numb myself right now, but I stopped breastfeeding recently fearing that I would regret it... and here we are two weeks later and my son does terrible on formula, so I had to buy the sensitive kind and I am, so far, unsuccessfully trying to boost my terrible supply again... 

Its just a lot and I am unsure how to deal with it all.

Lets just get the fact that I just had 2 babies in the same year out of the way too, its just an excuse, and all I hear these days is ""But...but you just had two babies!

When I was a kid my mom thought I had an eating disorder I was so thin.  I ate like a fucking pig and never gained a pound.  But thats what happens when you are 12 right?   So moving on to high school.  18 and 106 pounds soaking wet. I was SMOKIN' ladies. Totally gorgeous.  Moving on... I was 22 and 110lbs.  Still looking good.  26 years 135. Not great, not bad.  30 years 165... ok now we have a problem.  35 years  200 lbs.  TWO HUNDRED POUNDS ON A 5'3 FRAME!

Its too much! I cant even have sex the way I used to be able to.  My husband?  Fat.  I don't care I love his pillowy softness.  Our sex life was fine even though he was fat and I was skinny.  Now?  Its like how the FUCK do we even do this?! Not to mention the total turn off of parts of my body that are not supposed to jiggle... shudder. 

I am wearing XXL MATERNITY pants right now and they fit... let that sink in.  

BUT I am doing Keto, because lets face it, its really the only diet that works with minimal physical activity and I still get to eat bacon.  I have been doing it now for a week and I have lost 3 pounds. 

I am pretty sick of people telling me ""Its OK you JUST had a baby, you just had TWO babies!""  Not cool man.  Don't make excuses for my complete disregard for my physical health.  

I am 35.  I have no wrinkles on my face, and I also have a baby face, which is not really a look that is complimented by a double chin. I could pass for a 25 year old if I lost weight.   And lets me honest we all look in the mirror and go ""Well I don't look that bad!""  And then I am in the mirror with someone, like my fat husband, and I see that I am pretty much on par with his size and I think... holy shit... this has GOT to stop. 

I will do this! If I can quit smoking cold turkey after 20 years then I can lose a few pounds.  (though smoking WOULD help me lose weight.. mmmm cigarettes... no.. no never mind)

So I am going to bring everyone back to April 4th 2001.  I was 20 years old and I just started my first non-retail job working for a call center for a pretty specific brand of things, I am not going to say the brand because not that many people have this story...so...  Anyway.  When you started at this company, it was for a particular line of products, and they had an 8 week training class.  They taught us how to use every single product they had, and now to troubleshoot issues, what meant broken, what meant user error.   I was in a class of 8.  Call centers have high turnarounds so they hire a bunch of people at once, and end up with 2 or 3 six months in.  

One of the things we needed to do what walk into the call center with our headsets and ask other employees if we could sit and listen to their calls.  One day I sat with this one guy, N, he had a bunch of artwork that he had done all over the walls of his cubicle, he had a pile of magazines and BUNCH of toys.  He didn't even look at me when I asked if I could sit down and during the hour that I sat with him listening to calls, he never once turned around and talked to me.  I sat there reading magazines, because back then smart phones were not a thing.  

A few months into that job I started dating a guy from my training class, D.  We pretty much moved in together immediately, and we were together 24 hours a day 7 days a week for 3 years, because we worked together.   We would hang out with other people from work, N being one of our regulars.  He came with us everywhere, and then he stopped working where we worked, but he still hung out with us. 

I ended up getting laid off and collected unemployment for almost a full year.  My boyfriend, D, was still working at that office.  N, was working at a bank near where we all lived and since he was only working until like 3pm, and I was unemployed he would come over every day and we would do stuff, like go to lunch or a walk in the woods.   When D would come home from work we would all hang out together and smoke insanely large amounts of weed. 

In 2004 I married D.  N was at the wedding, he was the guestbook attendant, we had one of those polaroid guest books, and N had volunteered to take the photos of our guests, and then have the guests sign next to the picture. 

Two weeks after D and I got married N moved 3000 miles away, to another country.  Even though we had been such amazingly great friends for the past 3 years, N and I lost touch... Except for one thing.   It was 2004 so Livejournal was still a thing.  I would write in my journal as if I was just writing, but I was writing to him, and he knew it, we just never discussed it.   He would do the same, knowing that I was reading his. 

In 2006 D and I had a son.  And shortly before his first birthday, in March of 2007 I was sitting up at night, because I had some serious postpartum insomnia, not to mention my marriage was quickly falling apart.  D and I had decided to get divorced when I was 7 months pregnant, but he was supporting me for the first year of my sons life because he did not want him in a daycare.  When on my AIM came a message from N ""You're up late"" was all it said.  This kicked off a conversation that lasted a bottle of wine and 5 hours, until 4am, when I finally said ""You know... I didn't realize until you had up and gone and I was married and it was too late, that I was really in love with you""  

The next morning I woke up to a Livejournal post that simply said ""What the Fuck was that!?""  This kicked off a year long, long distance, emotional affair. Our entire first year of our relationship is memorialized in Livejournal posts that I can go back and read whenever I want. Us talking about how much we miss each other, how everything is insane and how we are about to ruin a bunch of lives, how our hearts were breaking from not being together.  THe modern day love lever...stuck on some server somewhere. 

About 2 months in his girlfriend found out, my husband found out, we decided on many occasions to stop our relationship and work on the ones we already had.  That we were being stupid and a fantasy relationship with 3000 miles in between was stupid.  But we kept being drawn back together.  Checking the journal, when we knew we shouldn't. POSTING when we knew we shouldn't.  Texting when we knew we shouldn't.  

I left my husband in January of 2008.  Moved in with my mom.  And on March 21, 2008, I was sitting in the airport waiting for his plane to land.  

We spent a blissful 3 months together, visiting places we had when we were just friends, museums, parks, coastal cities with fancy restaurants.  It was perfect and amazing. In June he flew back, to pack up his life, to ship his world home, to me.  He flew in for the last time on August 16, 2008.  

We had problems about a year in.  He was being kind of a deadbeat.  I was living in a tiny 2 bedroom apartment in a horrible neighborhood, I was working my ass off as a single mom to take care of me and my kid and he was basically living with me, but contributing zero to my rent or bills. I was dealing with a shitty divorce process while trying to make a decent life for me and my son.   He was being arrogant and mean and I had had enough so I broke up with him. 

We were broken up for an entire year.  But we never stopped constantly hanging out, and he did whatever he could to regain my trust.  He made me promises to get better, to be that guy that he was from 3000 miles away.  Its all recorded, written in those Livejournal posts, all the promises he made.  

We got back together in September of 2010, and we were married on January 22, 2011.   We got married so quickly because one night in December we were lying in bed and it was snowing out and he said ""If there was a justice of the peace at the window right now you would marry me huh?""  And I said of course, and so a month later, we were married in my moms living room on the coldest day of the year after a blizzard had come through the day before. 

The last 5 years have been the best of my life, I am amazed that I can count myself amongst the happily married.  Recently I decided to go through and read all those old Livejournal posts because for our anniversary I had a photobook made, and it has a ton of pictures of us and I wanted to quote some of our old love letter posts in it as well.  

Towards the end I found the posts from when we were broken up, when he promised me he was going to change, and how he was going to be a better man.  As I was reading through them I realized that he had fulfilled every single promise, made every single change.  He did this because he loves me, and this has made him the most amazing man I have every known.  

And here he and I are 5 years and 2 kids later and we still laugh together and we still love the same.  When aren't together we constantly text each other, hell we even do it when he is working from home and is upstairs.  We still giggle and joke and hug and kiss like a new couple in their honeymoon period.  

Years ago I once asked him ""How many years do you think it will take of us being together where we don't tell each other 'I love you' 20 times a day""  His response ""I will never stop telling you I love you, all day every day for the rest of my life"" And after almost 9 years he never has.

So on our anniversary, we are dropping off all three kids with his parents, and we are headed into Boston for some art museum perusing, a place where we can walk around for hours holding hands, and then we will probably get some sushi.  

I am one of the lucky ones.  I actually found my soulmate, though I fucked it up the first time and chose someone else, I did manage to find the one. 

And if you made it all the way down here... thanks for reading my sappy story.  

Edit to add:  This picture was taken on March 22, 2008.  The day after he came back.  :)

Every year my ex husband tries to get me to pay for this super expensive summer camp for my 9 year old.  Its $1000 for 6 weeks... its a day camp from 8:30-4 with a field trip a week. 

Now this sounds totally awesome, and it would be except for a few things.

First is that we can not afford $500 to send my son to summer camp, I am a stay at home mom, I just don't have the money. 

Second is I am not going to drive him to camp every day, pack two babies in the car at 8am and then again at 4pm.  

Its a good program and we live in a super rich town but in the ghetto neighborhood.  We can barely afford to live here and the primary reason we haven't moved is because last time I even mentioned moving to my exhusband he took me to court to get an order to make me stay in this town. (he didn't win) We just decided to stay because we happened to find a place that was affordable and we wouldn't have to make my son change schools. 

I told him that I do not object to him going to the camp, but if he is to go, he needs to pay 100% of the cost as well as find transportation for him AT LEAST 50% of the time because it is just too much.  He works so even on his custody days I would be the one responsible for drop off and pick up.  

I just feel like this dude has relied on me and my husband for far too long.  He needs to skip a weekend because he is going away with is girlfriend?  Yeah of course my son will stay with us, because he fucking lives here and I know that even on my non custody days I am responsible for him.  Need to skip a whole two weeks of custody days because your company is sending you on a 4 day business trip to Amsterdam but you decided to make a trip of it and stay two week?  Of course again, we are not going to say no. 

He thinks that just because I don't work that I have all the damn time in the world to cart the kid back and forth to camp every day.  

He does not understand that I have other kids, and that now I have three kids that split my attention.  He thinks that because the 9 year old was here first that he should be the favored one and get all my attention while my husband takes up all the responsibility for the other two.

I am now awaiting either an angry email telling me that I am a horrible mother and narcissistic because I wont sacrifice my whole summer and entire family, putting my budget into a downward spiral, to his will.  Or a court summons... whichever. ",breakingmom,Aaaand here we go again...,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/3zfqyp/aaaand_here_we_go_again/

You can possibly imagine that I did not PLAN on getting pregnant with my third when my second was only 4 months old.  I had been infertile, had both my first kids with years of infertility treatments, and then all of the sudden POOF third kid completely naturally. 

When I got pregnant with my third kid, the second was exclusively breast fed. I was thrilled about that, because I had failed breastfeeding with my first.  I was planning on going a full year, but by the time I was 6 weeks pregnant, my milk had already turned back to colostrum and I was not making enough for him and I had to switch to formula.  Not a decision that was easy to make, but necessary. 

I thought, ok, failed that breastfeeding relationship too.. I have a THIRD chance! I will make it this time!  Now, even though this baby was one of those babies that did the whole nipple crawl and started breastfeeding minutes after he was born, and for a whole 45 minutes, he has always been shitty at getting the milk out.  His latch is awesome, he has great form, however he is just a weak sucker.  

When I got my first PP period last month I had such a huge supply drop and combined with his weak suck I had to supplement.  I had zero choice, he wouldn't even latch and would scream because he was so hungry.   I got past that first period but this time he is having NONE of it. 

My supply is so low that he wont even latch for more than a second, and when he realized that the flow is so low will scream his head off.  I have sat with him for over an hour trying to get him to latch and eat before giving up and giving him a bottle.  Which makes him instantly happy. 

He was up every hour last night nursing whatever small amount he was getting until 4:30am when I gave up and just gave him a bottle, where he finally slept until 7.   I have tried the whole lot of things, prenatal vitamins, calcium supplements as recommended by KellyMom. I have tried pumping all day to up my supply, letting him nurse for hours at a time, its just not there.  

So this morning I said to myself.  FINE if he wants a bottle he can have it and my husband sent me to bed at 7 and I slept until 11:30. Having my kids so close together I always said that I would stop breastfeeding early, but now that the reality of it staring me in the face I am having a hard time dealing.   

On one hand it would be nice to be able to sleep for more than 2 hours a stretch, and it would also be nice to get drunk, or smoke some weed once in a while without having to worry about the THC content of my milk.  

I am still nursing sometimes, because he likes to do it for comfort and sometimes still refuses to sleep without it.  I know that once I go down this road my supply will just continue to dwindle until there is nothing left and he only has formula and thats ok I suppose.  

I just would have liked to make one of my breastfeeding goals... I had three chances, and I failed all three.   ",breakingmom,Bitter sweet.

Before I had my 2nd kid I was infertile, but my doc said that it is possible for pregnancy to 'reset' your fertility and now I have all these stupid hormones that I have never had.  I am raging hard at my family today and I just cant take it  

Today for example.  The baby is going through his 4 month sleep regression so he is up all night wanting to party.  The 17 month old is a jerk, like serious jerk, he hits and throw things.  We have tried everything to get it to stop, but this kid does not care.  He was ""that kid"" at my nephews 2nd birthday party a few weeks ago.  He does not listen, he does not care.  He stole toys he drank out of everyones drink, he threw a tantrum when he couldn't open the Thomas the train set that was not his.  It was a disaster. 

My husband does not listen to a word I say, to the point now that he doesn't even hear me speaking two feet away from him.  I can ask him how his day was, or be telling him a funny story about something the kid did and he is completely oblivious.  He gets so upset that ""He works so much he doesn't get to spend time with his kids!"" but when he isn't working he has his nose in his phone. 

My 9 year old is leaving to go to Vermont this weekend with his dad to visit his cousins.  I am packing his bag and even though the kid owns 5 pairs of jeans, somehow there are no only two pairs.  OH FUCKING WELL looks like your lazy ass alcoholic dad is going to have to do some laundry because those jeans are NO WHERE in this house, did he fucking EAT THEM?!

We have a 9 year old, who we will call E.  An extremely smart, polite, well behaved 9 year old.  

I mean this kid has always been easy, as a toddler he never got into anything he wasn't supposed to, at 2 years old I could leave him the run of the house and take a shower and I would come out to him happily playing on the floor.  He never touched anything that wasn't his, never had tantrums nothing.  He has been calm and cool his entire life so far.  Until recently.  He got in an argument with some other kid at school, but like guys... he is 9 years old.. of course this happened.  So a note was sent home, there was no physical altercation, no hitting, just some yelling, and probably some talking back to teachers. This was the FIRST NOTE ever sent home from school ever.  This is the very first time he has gotten in enough trouble at school for them to feel we needed to know about it and it wasn't even that big of a deal. 

So my exhusband finds out about it obviously, and I get an email from him this morning... the TL;DR is... E is having some serious behavior and academic issues and I think we all (meaning me and my husband and him and his girlfriend) need to sit down together and come up with a plan of action to address these issues with him. 

What fucking issues? Seriously... the kid got in trouble ONCE. Academic issues? He consistently gets A's and B's!  

So I reply back as politely as I can that I do not believe that this is abnormal behavior for a 9 year old.  That I read the notes and doled out a proper punishment and the issue is now closed.  I also told him that I believe that E is a good kid and that this is the very first time that he has gotten in trouble, and that if he had a ""behavioral issue"" we would be constantly hearing from the school. I told him that I actually asked his teacher during parent teacher meetings how his behavior was and she repeatedly assured me that I had absolutely nothing to worry about.  I also said that to make a big deal out of this to the point of calling a family meeting, which we have never had, would make E feel like he was a bad kid, which he is far far from. 

I was nice, and polite, I told him that I respectfully disagreed with him and that I believe that since we have such a hard time communicating even after all these years that a meeting would be a bad idea and that emailing, as we always have would still be the best corse of action. (I always want a written record of what is said between us)

But you know what?  Every time there has been a large life change for either of us, like when he moved in with his girlfriend or when I had each of my other kids, he has tried to make a mountain out of an imaginary mole hill and taken me to court trying to get primary custody of E. Well dude just bought a house, I am betting he is trying to build an invisible case that E is ""Having behavioral and academic issues"" living with me so that he can try to get custody.  Well guess what asshole, just because you write an email saying so doesn't make it true... I have report cards with all A's and B's and there are no records of him having behavioral issues with the school.  I am so mad.  I don't want to have to hire a lawyer with my husbands tax return money.  If this is what happens I am going to be so so so fucking pissed off.

But even if I wasn't nursing and we had a babysitter there is no cash for that stuff.  My life is in this room... 

I dont begrudge my husband his good time, he works a ton and he provides for us and he loves me so much, I am just sad for me, I want to have fun...

I'm currently sitting at my kitchen table waiting for bread dough to rise wondering why I even fucking bother to care about this shit at all but I'm a sensitive person so it does.

My sister.  Her and I have never been close, we literally live within walking distance of each other and still only see each other on major holidays.   So my sister in law is from Japan, and she goes back to visit her family every year or so.  My sister asks her yesterday when the next time they are going, and my SIL says in two years because next year her parents are coming here instead.  My sister asks if the next time she goes if her husband and her daughter and her could tag along, because who doesn't want to visit Japan? My SIL is so polite and said 'yeah sure, that would be fun!' And right at that moment my husband walks in the room and I say ""Hey! They are all going to Japan in two years!"" To which my husband jokingly responds ""oh man! We better start saving now!"" I am going to put it here that my sister and basically my whole family knows that we would never be able to afford a trip to Japan! But without any prompting my sister says ""You can't go! This is a family trip! (I am assuming she means her husband and daughter as 'family' here referring to her immediate family) I could never go anywhere with you!""  I just stood there in stunned silence and turned away to make the gravy.  

I told my mom about it today and she said ""You should have spit in her face, that kind of thing warrants spit in the face""  It's not like I am not aware of who my sister is, a few years ago I was watching a movie and there were sisters in it and I thought to myself ""Man, I wish I had a sister."" It took a few minutes to dawn on me that I actually did have a sister.   I just feel really shitty about it.  I mean, just last week I said to my husband ""Maybe I should call Lani and see if she wants to go downtown for a drink or something"". Well fuck that now!  I am done hoping for a relationship with her.   I have tried to since I was little as she is my big sister but she has shown me nothing but contempt over the years.

My experience with silicone spouts is that they leak, my kid likes to turn his cup upside down and smoosh the tip so it leaks and he can play with the liquid that comes out... not only that, silicone tips seem to just leak when the cup is on its side.  

I am not interested in paying ridiculous amounts of money for a sippy cup made of aluminum or some shit.  I am also not interested in those ""cup"" type cups, my kid refuses to drink out of it unless there is a spout and I am cool with that.

Lots of very encouraging stories from you ladies as I lost it before we moved house and I was convinced it was gone forever.  

So today I was getting ready and I was in the bathroom where I keep this little wooden basket of costume jewelry.  I noticed that a silver chain was hanging out of the basket and I knew it was the pearl necklace that my dad had given me when my grandmother died, her name was Annie Pearl, so I decided to wear it.  I picked it up and put it on thinking... I thought that was in my jewelry box... Wonder how long it's been in there.  So on a whim I picked up the tangled pile of fake costume necklaces and pushed into the middle of the ball AND THERE IT WAS!

She hated me and my siblings so much that she has alienated my father from us.  I barely see the man, twice a year if he is lucky.  My kids barely know him.  My 9 year old has seen him every other Christmas and maybe once of the summer his entire life. 

But.. something has changed.  We went to my dads for fathers day, which is weird because we never do anything with my dad on fathers day, but we were invited by my stepmother so we stopped by.   While I was there I was telling my dad about how my 9 year olds baseball team had won their championship little league game and how during the final game he got hit in the face with a fastball and how bad ass he was for getting back up to play.  And my dad says ""He plays baseball? You didn't tell me he played baseball!... why didn't you tell me? I would have come to a game!""  He sounded broken hearted but seriously?  I have been telling this man about my kid and his activities for the last 8 years and he has never once shown any interest, never once wanted to come.  Its always be a 'thats nice...' and that is the end of it.  I didn't mention the baseball because I hadn't even spoken to my dad the entire season.   I talk the guy every 6 months maybe. 

So after fathers day my stepmother started texting me about twice a week.  Asking how things are, asking about the kids, they even invited us to apple pick with them in September.  I answer her back and I am polite and fill her in on the kids and stuff, but I really do not want to talk to her.  

Am I hearing from my dad more during this time you ask? No... not at all.  I hear from him even less now.  

My husband thinks that my dad and my stepmother got in a fight after we left about how he has no idea what his kids or grandkids are up to and that she is trying to have a better relationship with me for his benefit.  But the thing is, its not like she is the entire problem.  My dad alienated himself from us for all these years, granted her attitude did not help and he is a one of those people who has to please all the time.  But this is a man who is closer to her nieces and nephews than he is his own children. 

I am bitter about the whole thing and I do not want to talk to her, but I am not an asshole so I do.  My husband is sympathetic, says she is trying and I should be nice and maybe try to build a relationship with her.  But why should I?  She has been a bitch to me for over 20 years... thats not something a person just lets go.  And when I say bitch I mean, like... I would go to my dads house and she would lock herself in her room so she didn't have to talk to me, kind of bitch.   The whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth... I want to know what her motives are.   I also want to know why, if my father feels like he needs to have a better relationship with us, why am I not hearing from him instead.

I have had two other babies before this.  I have had epidurals both times and epidurals are the fucking way to go in my opinion.  I planned on getting one this time too but I did not.  I got to the hospital in labor at 3am and little 'Mr. I ain't waitin for your pain relief' decided he wanted out at 6am.    It is extremely hard to come to terms with an unplanned natural birth when you are in the throws of it.  I mean, I am actually feeling great about it because I don't have any post epidural side effects, but at the time I was like... FUUUUUUCK this shit!

My husband, being the caring sensitive individual he is, stayed away the entire birth because I told his ass not to touch me.  I probably would have clawed his eyes out had he even looked in my direction, though I was so disoriented and confused by the pain that I seriously wouldn't have even noticed if he had left the room.  

However, I do remember screaming in his direction ""THE BABY IS COMING NOW!"" because there was literally no one in the room with me other than him and I wanted someone down south to actually catch the baby so he didn't slide out onto the floor.   Good thing the nurse and midwife came in when I said that, because literally a minute later he was out. 

My husband later said to me ""I have never heard you scream like that before""  No shit dude, and you will never hear it again either, my baby factory is closed for business.

My first I was in labor for 26 hours, had an epidural, pushed for 20 minutes, basically a pain free labor.  Second  was 46 hours, epidural, two pushes and he was out, another pain free labor. 

This time... I was just so sick of being pregnant.   I asked my husband, who is a nipple guy, if he would do some uh... stimulation so that maybe we could jump start labor.  This was on the night of the 22nd.  I woke up the next morning with painful contractions 10 minutes apart.  As I waited out the day they got farther and farther apart, so by 2pm they were at an hour apart and they stayed that way until 10pm on the 23rd.  I said to my husband, hey, why dont you try one more time, see what we can accomplish.  So after 10 minutes of stimulation I was having super painful contractions at 30 minutes apart.  I told my husband I would get some sleep and see what the deal was.   By 11pm they were a solid 10 minutes apart, and I was getting zero sleep.  By 1am they were 5 minutes apart and I was really hoping to wait it out until morning to go in, because I have two other children who were sleeping at the time! 

I tried calling my sister who lives 5 minutes down the road and was my previously agreed upon baby sitter and she did not answer her phone.  I called her husbands phone and nothing, I even called her 12 year olds phone... I just told my husband to drive over and bang on their front door and wake them up which thankfully worked.   He came back, picked up me and the kids and we dropped them off and headed in to L&amp;D.   When we got here at 3am, my contractions were now three minutes apart.   I was in a lot of pain at this point and when I was checked at about 3:30am I was 4cm and baby was super high up, -5 station is what they said.  

They had me bounce on the ball and walk around, and by 4am I was to the point where I was screaming.  I told my husband the next time a nurse came in I was going to ask when I could get my epidural and I figured that it would be a while, because I was not dilated a whole lot and baby was still high.  But by the time a nurse came in my water had broken and I was losing my mind.  Its really hard to come to terms with having a 100% med free birth when you had always gotten and had always planned on getting an epidural.   

At about 5:45am I was screaming that I had to push and there was no way around it, they checked and I was 8cm...  So super fast progress there.  With the next two contractions I was yelling ""THE BABY IS COMING NOW!""  And one of the nurses said ""She has had two children... I believe her!""  So the midwife felt down to check and as she did that I had another super contraction and my body pushed without me having any say in it at all, and my little Isaac came crashing into the world at 6:02am, 3 hours after I arrived at the hospital. 

It was definitely a different experience than my other two labors! But they say that happens.   My husband later said to me ""I have never heard you scream like that before"" and I said ""And you never will again!""   

Honestly, I know my personal limitations and if I had not gone that fast I would definitely have gotten my epidural.  I can not take that kind of pain.  I am glad that we have chosen this to be our last child, so I do not have to worry about that again!   

Its 12:30am on the 25th now and I am sitting in my room alone.  My husband is home with our other two boys and I am bored and can not sleep, my baby is getting his hearing checked and I am waiting for him to return.  He is nursing like a champ and doing fantastic.  I hope that at some point I get some sleep tonight, but really I just cant wait until Wednesday when I can GO HOME!  I despise hospitals, I always feel like I am in a prison when I am stuck in one.

He is 9 and has been doing it since December.  He loves it.  There is this other woman who's kids go at the same time as mine and we have this ""Mom's sitting in the waiting room chatting"" Friendship.  This woman is literally the ONLY other person I talk to besides my husband and I get totally bummed out every time I show up to class and she isn't there.   She is a nurse and works odd shifts, so sometimes her husband drops off her kids.  But we have a nice little Tai Kwon doe mom friendship going on. 

I am HUGE pregnant, due in 11 days.  So every time I show up recently she asks me how I am feeling and we discuss pregnancy for a few minutes and usually move on to other topics, as you do.  

However, lately there has been these two teenage girls sitting in the parent viewing room.  That obnoxious kind who butt in to everyones conversations as if they have something interesting to say and everyone tries to placate them and its uncomfortable for everyone.  Until today I had NO idea who these kids were, they obviously did not take the class and they had no siblings in the class either... Well today I found out who they were. 

So me and my nurse friend are sitting in the back of the room chatting, not loud, but no one else talks to each other so pretty much everyone can hear us, its not that big of a room.   I was telling her how my husband was acting like a first time dad, and how he wanted to leave the hospital bag on the enclosed porch so we can grab it as we ""run out the door"" and she laughed and I just said it was because he had two cousins give birth on the highway this year so he is a little nervous.   So the topic moves to that video that has been going around about the woman who gave birth to a baby in the car as her husband drove and how I was shocked he was so calm.  Never did I become graphic, never did I mention anything other than, ""This woman had the baby while the car was moving and the dude was like ""oh hey! Look he is here!... do you want me to pull over?""  I am sure a lot of you have seen this video.   Well halfway through me telling my friend about this video this teenage girl turns around in her seat and says...  ""Excuse me, could you STOP talking about that!""   I was in shock... I did not even know how to react, but good thing I didn't have to!  Because this girls MOM was sitting right in front of her....

She screams ""TEENAGER! YOU DO NOT SAY THAT TO PEOPLE! OH MY GOD SERIOUSLY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING! GO WAIT OUT IN THE LOBBY!""  The girl gets up and storms out of the room followed by her mom.  A few minutes later the mom comes back and I say, I am sorry, I didn't mean to be offensive and she goes ""NO NO I am sorry! cocky teenager thinks she can just say anything to anyone.... I START WORKING HERE NEXT WEEK! That is my husband in there who just started teaching here too!... oh man I am mortified...I am so sorry!""  I said, ""This room is usually full of moms, and y'know sometimes we get carried away talking about mom things."" and she said ""Of COURSE! Dont worry about it!""  

So the girl comes back in and apologizes to me and my friend and I say ""Oh its ok""  Like you do.... 

But the whole thing to me was hilarious.  I said something along time lines of ""I guess we will be seeing you a LOT then huh? Have a good night!""  to the mom when I left, I really felt bad for her, she seemed really nice....

It seems that he is always crying.  He cries about every single thing that happens to him.  So far we have had three crying spells just today.  

He has always been a bit emotional, but oh man.  Is this like, developmental? What the hell is going on!   I hate to be a jerk but I am just so sick of it.  

Tonight for example, he was upstairs in my room with my husband (his stepdad) playing some video game online with one of my husbands coworkers and his son.  TWICE he came down crying.  For the record, I hate when they play video games together.  My husband isn't the nicest person behind a controller and since my son has been playing video games with him since he was 3, he may have picked up some bad habits, so basically they just do shit to piss each other off, and they trash talk each other and sabotage each other constantly.   I have had to, on more than one occasion, stop games because of the bickering.  Don't get me wrong, a lot of this is done in jest and they laugh a lot when playing too, they enjoy messing with each other and a lot of times its an 'all in good fun' situation, but tonight I guess it got out of hand. 

My son tends to do shit that is cheating or mean in a game, my husband will say ""Hey, dont do that""  And thats what happened, they are playing against other people and not by themselves.  And my son gets all upset and whines ""WHAAAAAT! I didn't dooooo anything!""  My husband tells him to play fair because its not just the two of them, there are other people, friends, playing too.   He loses his shit, throws his controller down and pouts... causing them to lose.  My husband gets mad, tells him he cant act like that... tears... he comes down the stairs and cries into the chair.  Big exaggerated whine cries, that he is only doing for sympathy. 

It took me a while to get this whole story out of them.  I tell my son, no more games tonight if he cant play fair.  He cries some more, my husband goes back upstairs.   For an entire 10 minutes I listen to these fake sob cries into the arm of the rocking chair... So I did what any self respecting mom would do and I said ""If you are going to continue to cry because you didn't get your way, you need to go to your room and do it there"" 

That is just an example!  One day he was crying because he forgot his baseball hat at his dads.  Earlier at karate practice he cried because he didn't put on his shin guards properly and the teacher had to show him the correct way to put them on which he interpreted as ""in trouble'  I saw the whole thing, she was instructive about it, he was not in trouble. 

Crying.. he cries more than the 12 month old! I dont know how much more of this I can take... please tell me its a phase... please!?",breakingmom,Whats with all the damn crying!,http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/3gsrpa/whats_with_all_the_damn_crying/

That I am in some kind of weird limbo, like I am sitting in a waiting room. 

I have a 13 month old and I am due in 2 weeks.  So, out of the last 22 months I have been pregnant for almost 18 of them.   I am just sick of it.  I feel bad because I have spent the first year of my middle child's life feeling like I am in this limbo.  Its not really fair to him.  I also have no connection to this new baby AT ALL.    I dont know if it was because the way in which I got pregnant with this one was so different. 

So with my first child, who is now 9, my exhusband and I spent a year in a fertility clinic trying to get pregnant.  I have PCOS, I do not ovulate on my own ever, for any reason.    My current husband and I spent 5 years having completely unprotected sex.  Nothing.  We spent 2 years in a fertility clinic, finally getting pregnant with my 13 month old.   And then, 4 months postpartum, after only having sex twice since the birth, we get a surprise natural pregnancy... two weeks after we decided that we did not want to do the fertility clinic thing again and we were done having kids.   The sex was also an obscene amount of time after my 2nd postpartum period,  which told the doctors that I had ovulated about 12 days late. 12 DAYS!  

Everything about this pregnancy is foreign to me.  Like ok, natural pregnancies are not something I ever thought I would experience, let alone a surprise oops pregnancy.   When I found out I was pregnant I was devastated because I had JUST started feeling myself again after the birth.   I am not young, I am 35... it says ""advanced maternal age"" in my medical file for gods sake.

I am never surprised anymore with her and her ridiculous tinctures and supplements.   I never give her grief for her beliefs, I usually just try to make small talk and ask her questions about the stuff so that she can feel accepted, I am not going to fight with her about it, because well, she is an adult and can make her own decisions, and any argument would fall on deaf ears anyway.

BUT yesterday I was at her house, bringing the kids to see her because my husband worked an overnight and I wanted to give him an empty quiet house to sleep in.   Its a regular visit, listening to her complain about how horrible she feels (she has Lyme disease) how her medicine isn't working, how she is now taking rattle snake venom or something just as ridiculous.  (keep in mind that all these 'natural' remedies are prescribed by her naturopathic 'doctor' who charges her thousands for these things) I 'yes' and nod and ask her questions to pretend that I am interested.  

At some point in the conversation she drops this bomb ""90% of breast cancer resolves itself, its the chemo that kills people""  I don't even know what we were talking about when she said that... I just kind of heard it, couldn't believe I actually heard it, and just moved on.   Then a little farther down in the day, I was talking about how my son just had his MMR vaccine and how even though I know vaccines don't cause autism, I can see how people believe the MMR changes their kid, because sometimes it makes kids all kinds of cranky and a mess for a few weeks.   My mom just rolls her eyes and says that it DOES cause autism.  

I kind of just stare at her for a second...  I mean, I know she has weird beliefs about modern medicine, and I dont even know why I was surprised at this statement, so I say... Uh, no it doesn't there has been too much research disproving that.  She says her naturopathic doctor said so! and she did INTERNET RESEARCH! God knows why... she is way beyond ever having to make a single health decision for a baby, she doesn't even have a uterus!  But anyway.  I get slightly annoyed and I say, well, I dont think it does, as do MOST people.  And then my stepfather, who this entire time has not even been involved in the conversation says ""You are just the type who would be brainwashed by the government!""  

I hate to admit it ladies... but I lost it.  I got up, packed up my kids stuff woke my 1 year old up from his nap and I left.  The whole time my mom is laughing at me saying ""I didn't even say anything!... what is your problem!""   I mean, ok believe what you want, but don't insult me.  I didn't insult you!  I am always sympathetic to her crazy medical beliefs, I never tell her she is wrong, or that her treatments are ridiculous.  But I get called brainwashed by a man who...ready for this?  Literally believes in chem trails. CHEM TRAILS! 

I dont even know what to do now, I am not the type to hold a grudge but holy god, I am so mad.  It seems like such a stupid reason to be mad, because I know how they are, and I know they are basically crazy.  My poor grandfather lives with them, he can barely hear and he has no voicebox so he cant talk.  But he refuses to get a hearing aid and now I know why.  During this entire exchange, he was silently laughing, probably thinking... SOMEONE finally sees the crazy that I have to endure living here!

I know they are like this... this should come as no surprise, but its bothering me so much! I dont know if I am bothered more about what they said or if I am bothered more about the way I reacted.  I am usually so good at placating their insanity that I am disappointed in myself for not being able to be cool during this situation.

None of what is happening to me right now is a surprise, I know I am supposed to be uncomfortable and sore. 

So they call me this morning, say the midwife I have my appointment with tomorrow morning will not be in and they want to reschedule me for noon... BWahahaha.  Yeah no.  I have all these last appointments scheduled months in advance because my husband has to take time off for me to get to them.

Its so stupid.  Yesterday my husband and I had to go about the fitting of two rear facing car seats in our truck.  We have a Nissan Xterra.  One convertible seat and one infant seat.  We also have a 9 year old that has to fit back there too. 

So you would be surprised, unless you own one, how narrow the back seat of a Xterra is.  It looks like a nice big truck, and it would be if I only had to put two car seats in and not a third older child as well.   

When we had my 1 year old we registered for a convertible seat, so that we would have it when we needed it.  We never considered or even thought it was a possibility that we would need to actually put two car seats back there.  But here we are because life.   So we go to put in the two seats, infant seat in the middle, and convertible on the side.  If we put them both on the sides there would be no way for my 9 year old to get in the car, and I personally dont think it would be fair to him, he was an only child for 8 years, I dont want him to lose his window seat, and this was the best way to get him the most room anyway. 

So we try put in the infant seat, no problem, husband then goes to put in the convertible seat, rear facing... its a not go.  It will not fit, its too wide and not only that the front passenger seat would be rendered useless, as it would have to be all the way up to the dash.  This is our family car, his commuter car is a Ford Focus... uh. no. 

So we try this seat front facing, its still too wide, the thing is a beast, again when I picked it out, I was not anticipating having to put two back there... ugh. 

So we go out and buy a new one, we spend $150 on a Graco Nautilus, because I am not buying any more seats for this kid.  I love that it will have a high back booster with a 5 point harness my oldest had a high back booster that just used the in car seat belt, and it is a really great quality seat.   We get it home and we realize that particular model we got does not have a rear facing option, so we front face it, and it fits and there is still plenty of room for the rear facing infant seat and the 9 year old.  

I realize that at 1 year was when I forward faced my 9 year old because back in 2007, that was the recommendation.  In 2011 was when the recommendation changed.  I never once felt guilty when I front faced the 9 year old... why do I feel guilty now?  It not like the safety of it has changed, just the fact that we know whats safer has changed. 

On a positive note we are giving away the original huge convertible seat to a friend of ours who has a daughter two months younger for free, so I feel good about that.

Which, ok, thats not too bad right?  But I am super depressed now, I shouldn't be because I am literally at the tail end of this pregnancy, but this last week has been so hard.  Partly because I have been pregnant now 17 out of the last 21 months and I just don't feel like I even had that 4 month break in between.  I feel like I have been pregnant for the last 2 years.  

It is summer, and this summer was supposed to be fun, it was supposed to be me and my 9 year old having the first summer as a SAHM in his life, because I divorced his dad when he was a year old and I have worked full time ever since. We were supposed to spend days at the beach, toting his 1 year old brother along, going to the park, taking a big camping trip that I promised him we would take because we had to skip the camping trip last year because I was pregnant.  

But because I am pregnant again we cant take the trip and its so hot and humid out and I am so hugely pregnant I cant lug him and the baby out to the beach.  My physical ability now is so limited that I am lucky that I can even walk across the living room.  

I have been having stupid fake ass contractions this entire day, and if this is anything like my previous pregnancies this will go on for WEEKS.  I am ruining my 1 year olds sleeping habits because I cant carry him up to his room anymore so he has been having his naps in a pack and play in the living room. He has not slept in his crib in weeks, and he was so good at it.  He has also been sleeping down here with me at night because of how hot and humid it is in his bedroom, that on top of him having a stupid summer cold and he got his MMR a week ago and he hasn't really recovered from that either so its been crank ass cranky pants ever since and by the end of the day I just want to tap out and go to bed at 6 when my husband gets home.  

I also have that stupid cold so its a coughing fit every single night which causes me to pee my pants, which makes for underwear changes in the middle of the night, I also pulled an abdominal muscle while coughing and now that hurts all the time too. 

My husband doesn't really get it, I mean, he is great and he tries so hard but he is just naturally bumbly.  He trips over himself and his words constantly.  Like last night when we were lying on the couch and he had his head rested on my thigh and how he was saying how much he loved my pregnant body and how I have been pregnant so long that he is developing a fetish and then he said... ""I cant believe I have a fat wife""  yeah he totally said it.  He said it because his preferred body type is what I would call 'thick' or 'chubby'  and for the first part of our relationship I was really skinny.  The more weight I gain the more attracted to me he seems to be.. Which, ok why am I complaining about that? Because I was always thin, I hate being overweight, even if its because I have had 2 babies in 2 years.... I look in the mirror and all I see is a monster.

I worry about leaving my 1 year old to be in the hospital when I have never spent a night away from him, I worry about bringing a new baby home to him and how he is going to react to that.  

I worry that I am going to come home from the hospital to a huge mess and be super uncomfortable and mad because everything is scummy and there is a sink full of dirty dishes and I worry that my husband wont get the stuff I need him to do done before the baby is here.  

I just need my body back.  I need to feel like a person again.

We are the WORST when it comes to second hand smoke! 

So I hate the smell HATE IT, to the point where I have sought out nonsmoking apartment buildings for the last 4 years.  The last complex I lived in had a rule that you had to walk over 50 feet from the building to smoke... so many people ignored this rule, like smoking on their balconies bad.   When I would smell cigarette smoke coming in my window I would go out and walk the building and find out who was smoking on their balcony and then call the office and report them.. yes I am THAT woman.  But seriously, do you know how hard it is to find a nonsmoking apartment building? 

So when I found the current place I live in I thought how lucky am I?  Its a duplex, owned by an old couple, but they have a no smoking on the property rule, even for guests, cant even smoke in our backyard. Awesome!  Our attached neighbors dont smoke, but the trash family on the other side do... like every single person in this house smokes,I wouldn't be surprised if the baby smokes, not only that they smoke a shit ton of weed like, enough weed that sometimes it smells like someone is smoking weed at my kitchen table, which whatever smoke your weed.  

I never smell cigarette smoke during the day and these people smoke all day long outside.  But every single night my entire first floor smells like smoke, its almost as if they are smoking on my front lawn in the dark and I just cant see them.  There has been a constant cigarette smell coming in my living room window now for a half hour... A HALF HOUR!  A cigarette takes 7 minutes to smoke... yes 7... ex smoker, I know how long it takes.

He looked at me like I was insane. 

So last year when I got pregnant again I found out that they dont make it the same and it SMELLS DIFFERENT NOW! Which is pretty much the worst thing that could happen.  So now if you want the original smell you have to order it directly from the company, and I have no idea how long that will last.  

I NEED it.  Seriously... This is the largest order I have ever made from them, I usually get it 2 bottles at a time... I am comtemplating ordering some every few months just so I can build up a supply incase something happens and they stop making it.  It is my favorite smell.   

I have lost it ladies... lost. my. damn. mind.  Though its nice that my husband doesn't give me shit about it, he thinks its funny...

I have a 12 month old and a 9 year old... I am sick as a god damn dog and my husband works insane amounts of overtime so I am usually alone all day with the baby. 

ANYWAY...  So last night after what is now almost 8 days of this stupid ass cold I was trying to get to sleep at 2am. I sleep on the couch because pregnant, and bed is too soft, husband sleeps upstairs.  Every time I would fall asleep I would be awakened by a huge coughing fit, along with basically peeing myself because pregnant.   Did you know Poise pads don't work when you are laying on your side?  Yeah... they don't.  So after the third yes THIRD underwear change I was about to lose it but I lie down for one more chance at sleep.  I was awoken by yet another coughing fit, this one though caused me to pull an abdominal muscle on my left side, right on my bump, which is now super painful every time I cough, try to stand, walk whatever. I pee again and I now have no clean underwear.  I am at a fucking loss. 

I am sitting on the couch in wet underwear sobbing... I dont know what to do, its 3am.  I have to get up with the baby in like 3 hours, I have to take the 9 year old for his Karate test this evening while towing along the baby, now in pain and on no sleep... I dont know what to do.   I text my husband, please come downstairs. 

He does, he takes one look at me, sits down beside me and asks me whats going on, I tell him basically that whole story, and now I am completely ugly crying.  He goes down the basement and gets me some clean underwear out of the dryer, while I am in the bathroom changing he makes a bed for me on the couch with a million pillows so that I can sleep sitting up so when I cough and pee it wont leak everywhere.  He tells me he is going to call in sick because obviously he needs to.  

I sleep a few hours and the baby wakes up at 6:30 and he comes downstairs, takes care of the baby, breakfast for him, the 9 year old and himself.  He tells me to go back to sleep so I do.  I wake up a few hours later, he is packing the kids up for a walk downtown and he is off and I am alone.  So I lie on the couch and drift in and out for a few hours.  While he is out he has a nice heart to heart with my 9 year old (his stepson) about all the stuff he is going through with the new babies around and him not being the center of attention anymore, kid comes home happier than he has been in months. 

He gets back... feeds everyone lunch, makes me coffee, and THEN takes the kids out so that the 9 year old can spend some of his birthday money leaving me AGAIN home alone on the couch in my pillow pile.  

I complain about him a lot because he is a man child, but that man fucking loves me death.  ",breakingmom,"I don't usually post these, but damn the man deserves it (husband brag)",http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/3e3ha2/i_dont_usually_post_these_but_damn_the_man/

Before I knew it was 1 in the afternoon when I woke up.  Man did I need the rest, but it totally screwed up my sleep schedule. 

I did not fall asleep until 2am, and for some ungodly reason I was up at 5:30am, have been up ever since. It is now 7am, baby is still sleeping and my oldest is due back from his weekend at his dads at 8am.  At that point baby will be up for the day and I guess so will I. There will be coffee today... lots and lots of coffee. 

Its also going to be in the 90's and humid today.  At over 34 weeks pregnant that just doesn't work for survival.  I actually left the house yesterday and almost passed out in the parking lot of Target it was so hot an humid.  I have had the AC and fans running since last night, because we only have one on each floor and we need to circulate the air overnight to cool the whole place effectively. 

Me and the baby have been sleeping in the livingroom so that is one less room to cool upstairs.  Ugh.  I need this pregnancy to end soon and believe it or not I would rather have a very rambunctious 1 year old and an infant to take care of than be pregnant EVER AGAIN.

I will live through this day... stupid summer cold and 3 hours of sleep... time to gather all my mom energy and just power through... wish me luck. ",breakingmom,I might survive the day... might not.

Well... nothing ever goes as planned.   Saturday was ok, hot and gross, but I got to jump in the pool and it was awesome.  Sunday was the kids birthday party, and it was 95 degrees and humid and being outside in that at 34 weeks pregnant was dangerous and I had to lie down in our air conditioned room a few times and miss part of the party.  Ok, fine.   Monday I came down with this terrible cold!  Like seriously?  Like I need a summer cold when I am so pregnant.  Why are summer colds so awful anyway?  Why do they always have to be the be all end all of colds?

So Tuesday we were supposed to stay all day, get dinner from this place my husband loves and go home late.  NOPE.  I was so sick we had to leave early.   I felt terrible from being sick and guilty because our plans were fucked up.  

So we get home and my husband lets me lie down.   Wednesday I wake up and the baby who will be 1 next week, has got this summer cold from hell... totally knew he was going to get it, so I dont know why I am not surprised.  My husband has been working insane amounts of overtime and so it has been me, hugely pregnant and sick... alone with a cranky sick 1 year old.   

On Wednesday I actually had to ask my exhusband a favor and have him take the 9 year old to karate.  I make it a point never to ask that dude for favors because he will just hold it over my head for the rest of my life.  

I am still super sick, the baby is STILL super sick.  He hasn't eaten much in a few days, surviving on milk alone.  He will have a few bites here and there but not the insane amounts of food he usually eats.   He is still full of energy and no fever so theres that I guess.  But I still have to chase his little butt around all day and all I want to do is just take some cold medicine and go to bed... but pregnant and baby and cant.  

Lord help me... I need this stupid cold to go away, my house needs to be cleaned, my kitchen floor needs to be washed, my bathroom is disgusting and I have nesting to do.

Today is the day my inlaws are throwing a big birthday party for my boys. One is turning 9, and the other one. Yes it's my babies first birthday party.  My kids birthdays are 10 days apart so obviously one big party.  So I literally have two friends who both RSVP to the party and I am super excited that they are coming.  They both live at least an hour in opposite directions from me so I don't get to see them often.  

So one says two days ago that she isn't coming... Of course... I just knew it.  But ok, if you had something come up that happens.  Then the other one text me this morning about getting home late last night and is not coming.  The party is the the afternoon it's not like it's at 8am... 

Whatever. Maybe I shouldn't be bitter but Jesus.  I looked at my husband and said, ""see this is why I don't have friends."" I mean cmon, make a fucking effort.  I have kids too obviously and I would never RSVP to something and at the last minute say 'jeez, I just don't feel like it' and not go.  I would pack up my kids suck it up and go and make the best of it.  

Whatever. Another disappointment from both of them.  I mean these women don't even know each other and both of them constantly cancel on me.  I have been trying to get together with 'we were out late last night' for a whole year, she has cancelled on me 4 times, and this is the type who cancels because 'the baby doesn't feel good' and then posts pictures of her at the beach later that day.  With a different friend.

But I only have these two friends so I keep getting ditched and I keep holding on to the friendship like some kind of pathetic child.  Ugh.

So I am super pregnant right now (almost 33 weeks) and my son turns 1 on the 23rd and my oldest turns 9 on the 13th.  I am too pregnant to organize and throw a birthday party so they are doing it in their giant backyard with their pool... they are paying for everything, organizing everything, doing all the food and decorations... the whole damn thing.  All we have to do is show up. 

My husband is basically working constantly until Saturday morning, so day shift today with a 4 hour break, and an overnight shift until 7am, and then a short day shift tomorrow and another overnight shift.  He is going to be exhausted.  But he will be able to sleep on the way to the inlaws and he will be able to sleep when we get there, and then Saturday night we are going to go out to dinner and leave the boys with the inlaws.  We have only been out alone once since little was born.. once in a whole year!   I am super friggin excited. 

We are having the party on Sunday and then Monday is my oldest birthday and we will be spending the day out doing stuff with him, mini golf, beach and so on.  Oh did I mention my husband has a 4 day weekend for this?  The first time he has had any extended time off in 2 years?   OH MY GOD ladies... I am so friggin excited for this weekend I can barely contain myself.   The inlaws will take the baby all weekend and I will be able to get some rest!  Lying in the backyard, floating in the pool..

I was always a nervous worker, even though I was a good worker, my husband is the same way and he is a grouchy mess all day on Sundays usually.  

I thought that when I became a SAHM that this would go away, because Monday is just like any other day... same schedule as Saturday and Sunday, and Tuesday whatever.   I worked for 18 years, I suppose something that gets ingrained into you like that takes a while to go away.   

I have been a SAHM for 15 months. Every Sunday night around 10pm without fail my anxiety spikes and I worry about Monday.  I can always think to myself and rationalize it away, because what does Monday have that any other day has? Nothing.   

When I became a SAHM I was 6 months pregnant with my 2nd, I had a 4 month old infant that I was getting used to when I found out I was pregnant again and now I am 7 months pregnant. I keep hoping that once I am not pregnant anymore, and I am confident in my body and can actually function well on a day to day that this will go away. I can finally get stuff done around the house, and feel like a productive member of the family again.

So my husband and I are having our third kid (well my third, his second) and we will now have two in car seats so we have been looking at trying to get a new vehicle, maybe a minivan or a crossover with a third row seat.  Basically because two car seats take up a lot of room and my 9 year old would be squished. 

So because we are upside down on our current SUV and we own an old Ford Focus outright, we are contemplating trading in them both and getting a brand new car.  The focus would cancel out any upside down money we own on the SUV and we would just have ONE NORMAL CAR PAYMENT.  No old cars that need a ton of work just to pass inspection each year, no worrying what is that rattle...  We have discussed this and we figure it would definitely work for us, I am a SAHM, my husband works from home 50% of the time and his actual work is only 20 minutes away.  Cool, we can make this work and we will save money that we desperately need.

So my husband spent last night at the dealership, we don't know what the deal is, and he is waiting for his lunch break to call the dealer back.  In the meantime I have texted my mom...

I tell her the plan... She insists that I go to her car dealer... which is a Ford dealership.  I don't want a Ford, we are trying to get a Nissan.  I tell her nah, we are just going to go with this guy, we like him.   She tells me of ONE horror story of a friend of her husbands that went to this dealership, bought a used car and now it wont pass inspection 2 years later... Uh yeah, thats the risk you take with used cars. 

I say, actually this dealership has awesome google reviews, and we aren't in the market for a Ford or a used car, so going to a Ford dealership isn't really where we should be. She insists, no matter what reasoning I give.  BUT YOU NEED TO GO TO THIS GUY THAT I BOUGHT MY CAR FROM BECAUSE HE IS AWESOME AND BLAH BLAH BLAH...

Yeah... no.  I am done talking to you now.   

So now because I was like yeah, I'm done now, if you are going to repeatedly insist I do what you want because of one dude I don't even know giving a place a bad review, then I am done talking to you.. SO NOW because of this she wont be speaking to me for a few weeks now, maybe even a few months.   

She once told me a story of my great grandmother, who lived in the north end of Boston.  She was in her livingroom and happened to look out the window and saw her sister walking by and because her sister walked by her house and did not stop to say hi, she didn't speak to her for the rest of her life.  My grandmother, who was in labor with her third child, looked out the window of the hospital, and saw that my grandfather, who did not have a car, got a ride to the hospital from a woman from work because she was going there anyway, never slept in the same room as her husband again, and then separated when the kids grew up.  She never believed that he wasn't cheating.

However, every single time he poops there is MAJOR pee leaking, (the poop stays in) everywhere.. from the back under the bum, to the legs around the front and even sometimes through the top of the diaper.  Most of his poops are still peanut butter consistency, and its like the second he poops it creates this barrier to any liquid and it just pours out the sides.  There is never any indication that he is pooping, and I change him every 1.5 - 2 hours because he is a serious heavy wetter.

So, when I am pregnant I always have this craving for the smell of original scent Pine Sol.  It is really my only pregnancy craving and it comes up every time.  The first time I was pregnant was in 2006 and I was working at a credit union branch that was located in a BJ's.. I was sitting at my desk one slow ass day talking to the other loan officer and I said to him ""I know its out there"" as I gazed over the warehouse floor ""Do you think someone would notice if I just went and found a big bottle and opened it just to smell it?"" This single dude was horrified and had no answers for me other than a blank stare.  I bought two huge bottles and cleaned my bathroom and kitchen with it twice a week just so I could smell it. 

During my pregnancy last year I took a special trip to Walmart to get some and I went to work cleaning the bathroom, but it didn't smell right... I thought it was just me, I was horrified that I was not going to get my fix, but I googled it and found out that those bastards changed the formula which resulted in a change in that years old wonderful smell.   That smell that reminded me of when the janitor at my 150 year old elementary school would mop those beautiful old wood floors.

I searched and found out that you can go to their facebook page and order directly from the company the original formula Pine Sol, so ladies that is exactly what I did.  They send out two huge bottles.

I still had one unopened bottle under my sink, so tonight I made my husband help me clear the entire kitchen floor before he went to bed and I went to work and mopped my kitchen floor at 10 pm.   My entire first floor smells amazing now and I am sitting here in silence by myself enjoying the smell and being kind of sad that when I wake up in the morning it will have gone.  

This is how simple it is ladies, its the small things that bring so much joy.  And as I sit here I am reminded how much of a broken mom that I am, or just a regular mom, when mopping my floor and sitting in a clean silent house is where I find my happiness.
