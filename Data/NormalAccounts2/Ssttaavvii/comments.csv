I was friends with her. Happiest and beat friend someone could have. Extremely caring person and always helped if needed.

On a crazy note: me and my dad might have been the last people to ever see her that day. I need prescription  glasses and I didnt have any at the time, so i dont know if it was or wasnt her.",2016-09-18 03:38:42+00:00,d7rdglp,1,t3_5389ro,35423,AskReddit

My gf and I took her son to see Deadpool; he's turning 5 this year. He enjoyed it just as much as we did. He doesn't curse and we covered his eyes during the sex scenes. He didnt understand the humor but he died laughing when deadpool got shot in the arse. 

I'm pretty open when it comes to showing kids things and explaining in detail about it. They're going to learn sometime. Doubt we'll take him to this; since it'll be all adult jokes. Deadpool had childish humor he could understand.",2016-08-08 05:42:58+00:00,d68pcla,1,t3_4wman7,36781,movies
