I wouldn like to join a guild doing heroic aat.  I've been playing every day since 1 day before hard launch. I don't like using line though and would prefer to just use in game chat for raid communication.

Please let me know if I might fit in to your guild. 
Thanks!",swgoh_guilds,Looking for guilds doing heroic aat raid,https://www.reddit.com/r/swgoh_guilds/comments/59f56t/looking_for_guilds_doing_heroic_aat_raid/
