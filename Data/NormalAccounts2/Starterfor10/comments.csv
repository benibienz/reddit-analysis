1,"Wow no need to swear. You're right it has nothing to do with geometry. It has to do with the person as a whole and ALSO whether their body type aligns with your preferences. Some guys don't like fat girls, hence that particular guy will not be able to find a fat girl sexy even though countless other men will. So for that particular man, what happens when his SO doesn't fit with his natural inclinations? Do you love their body as a body? Or do you love them as a whole whilst overlooking their body ? That's my question? Not whether a woman who is not a supermodel can be attractive. Of course they can but not to everyone ",2015-08-31 02:36:19+00:00,culews8,2,t1_culea87,1150,AskReddit
2,"Thank you, this is a balanced and honest reply which I've found difficult to come by due to most people refusing to entertain the idea that not every woman is attractive and physically desirable (to the vast vast vast vast vast vast vast vast vast majority of society) ",2015-08-31 02:29:52+00:00,culep69,4,t1_culefq3,482,AskReddit
3,Okay maybe I am wrong but regardless most men at least have a preference and a body type that naturally turns them on more than others. So my question still remains as to whether one can truly love a body that does not align with their natural preferences. Just because you love a person it doesn't mean than you have to love their body. You can love them despite their body ,2015-08-31 02:24:12+00:00,culeiiy,4,t1_cule69o,623,AskReddit
4,"I do understand where you're coming from but I get hung up on the thought that guys will feel resentment over what they cant have. Given the choice almost all men would go for the same type of body - perky or at least shapely boobs, toned plump butt, thin to curvy but not significantly over or underweight etc , that is their natural preference - so In my mind if I don't fit their natural preference I am denying them something/ they will never truly and fully love my body, they have just grown to. I just can't sway my mindset around to the other side - don't you ever fantasise about other boobs, other butts etc even thought you love your partner and their body? Surely that's natural? And normal even ",2015-08-31 01:59:27+00:00,culdp1u,2,t1_culd156,1242,AskReddit
