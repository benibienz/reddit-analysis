I have a bit of a strange question/maybe request for you all.

I have recently just started getting into asmr and I am really enjoying it! My favourite right now seems to be binaural ear massages.

Now there is just one problem.. for some reason the sound of cupping the microphones makes me so uncomfortable. Kind of makes my whole body cringe and feel very awkward. And it is in every single massage video..

So my question is, do you know of any ear massage asmr that has no talking and no cupping?

Seems like a stretch but I figured I would reach out and see what you all have.

Thank you! :)",asmr,[Question] Such thing as no cupping massage?,https://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/4t73ls/question_such_thing_as_no_cupping_massage/

This woman was married to a man who was a typical mama's boy and their relationship was just beyond weird. Really creeped me out to be honest, more than the usual stories I read on here.

So when the DIL decided to leave the husband finally, the MIL couldn't stand to have her baaaaabbies (grandkids) taken away, she should be the one raising them of course!

So what do they do? Shoot her out of their car, into hers while they are driving with the boys in the back. I've witnessed enough crazy for today..

Here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8iT9DZG2Lc) to the episode if anyone is interested, and sorry if it has been posted before!

(I already tried /r/thenetherlands and they didn't like it lol)

Anyway! So I have just moved to The Netherlands last week from Canada to live with my SO. I am in a very tiny village in Friesland and unfortunately most of my friends only really speak Frisian.. Now this is a problem obviously since literally the rest of the country speaks Dutch..

I am hoping to start language courses soon but I am suspecting it won't be for another month and I really would like to get a head start.

In the meantime, since I cannot get a job until I have permanent residency it has become very hard for me to make friends. My SO works full time and I have no idea how to make friends here without a job or a hobby I guess.

So I suppose what I am trying to do here is hopefully connect with some more expats, or residents of The Netherlands who can not only help me improve in my learning, but also maybe become a friend!

So, just a bit about me: I am a 21 year old woman, I love everything cats and am super in video games. I really enjoy staying in and watching anime but will never be opposed to sit at the pub and have some drinks or go out clubbing either. I am also a musician who currently owns an ocarina and a flute!

If you would be interested in helping me/being my friend please do not hesitate to send me a pm :)

I have been looking into how to get forms to prove my marital status (so they know I am not married to anyone here) to complete my residency application.

So far I have only been able to find 2 things I think i moght have to do. Option 1 is to visit Toronto to request the forms and get them notarized and all that fun stuff. The problem with this option is I do not live too close to Toronto and I can't reallyo afford to take time off of work to travel to Toronto more than once for the forms.

Option 2 is called a certificate of non-impediment. Now I have been reading into this and I cannot figure out if it's only for people who are wanting to get married out of the country, or if I can use it as my proof of marital status.

If anyone has any information or straight up knows exactly what I need please let me know. I need ti get the ball rolling asap.

Tell me why you think I should give you the ticket and we see what we can come up with!

You need to have a valid passport to go (obviously) and it would be much preferred if you had a way to get there too :) Wouldn't mind tagging along myself if this is the case ;P If not, we can always bus down together which is fine!

A little bit of background on me, I'm a 20 year old female, who is clearly into Marianas Trench, I have lived in Guelph since May and I would love to see myself making a new friend out of this who is also into MT :)

I have 2 jobs and struggle with getting enough sleep in between them and talking to him. Literally had 2 hours of sleep and shifts at both jobs but still found time to speak with him.

My issue is I don't think he pays enough attention/never initiates texting, skype, or phone calls nearly as often as he should.

I feel exhausted, I don't want to be the one always initiating.. But he thinks what he is doing is enough or that we always run out of things to talk about, which I disagree with.

I need validation in my relationship and I can't explain it to him without him thinking I'm bitching and whining at him. When in reality, I get so annoyed because he never listens or takes what I say into account..
