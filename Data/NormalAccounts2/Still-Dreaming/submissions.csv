I installed Windows 7 on my macbookpro 9.2 without the use of bootcamp. I tried everything to use Apple's ""simple and easy"" bootcamp but I just got error after error and it would not work. So I partitioned my hard drive myself and installed windows via a USB I created on a windows machine with Rufus. To get the Windows drivers I googled ""macbookpro 9.2 windows drivers"" and the only helpful link was from Apple.com with a 500mb file ""bootcamp 5.x"" that contained an .exe and a bunch of drivers. Of course attempting to run the executable gave me an error ""this version of bootcamp is not intended for this computer model"" even though apple.com said it should be. Anyways I installed the individual drivers it had packaged in the 500mb download and it got /some/ things working like wifi but there are a lot of things that aren't working such as keyboard media keys, touchpad right clicking and tap-clicking, the built in speakers, etc etc. 

Thank you.

Is there anything like that for videogames? I know on g2a (online key shop) you can purchase 10 random steam keys for 2 bucks which was actually kinda fun when I did that. But I want physical video games (mainly retro) and was wondering if anyone knew if a thing like I'm describing exists?

Thanks.
