477,"If they opened it up all weekend, you wouldn't be able to move an inch due to all the people crowding around. It works pretty nicely with how they do it on Thursdays now since it's before the race weekend actually begins and it's all very casual. For the rest of the weekend they're all business and having an endless amount of fans to trip over trying to get a pic of Lewis or Seb on their snapchat would be a pain for everyone trying to do their work. 

Other leagues are all significantly less popular than Formula 1 and with that comes more of an ability to keep the garages/paddock/etc open. Once you scale that popularity up to the global scale of F1 it starts to make more sense to keep access more limited throughout the weekend. And is what makes it that much more special when/if you *do* get that chance.

Leveraging yourself to buy appreciating assets is a totally different discussion, and is how much of the wealth of the US has been built. 

When I bought my 458 in April, I was offered financing at 2.49%. Paying off such a loan (any loan) is a totally risk-free ""investment"", i.e. you most definitely get a 2.49% return on paying off any part of the balance. If you can invest the money totally risk-free and get a 2.49% return net of taxes, and the liquidity of that investment is high, then it's almost a no-brainer decision to take the loan.

The way instagram works via location tagging and hashtags makes photos way easier to share and be viewed. Plus if your shots are naturally good and well-received they'll rise to the top 9 of a hashtag and stay there for awhile giving you great exposure. Just because some people choose to use the app to post pictures of their asses or morning coffee doesn't mean others can't use it and have success with it as a serious form of marketing/promotion.

If you showed the Alonso @ Melbourne crash to someone who doesn't follow F1 they'd no doubt assume he died in that.

1086,"I just went this year for the first time (and plan on going again next year) so I can offer some advice. 

Your best bet would be to stay in Milan which is about 20 minutes away by train. I booked an airbnb literally right next to the Porta Garibaldi station which made getting to the track so easy. 

If you have a 3 day ticket (definitely get one) then you can to to the Thursday pitwalk. During Friday-Sunday there is a shuttle bus service from the Monza train station to the track entrance where you walk about a mile or so to get in, but this doesn't exist on Thursday so your best bet is to catch a cab from the station. We found someone at the station also going to the track and split the fare, and made friends with the taxi driver who gave us a discount all weekend. The pitwalk starts at 2PM but if you want to see any of the big teams get there EARLY. We got there a little after 2 and had a good view of the Marussia/Sauber/Lotus/Force India garages but Ferrari/Merc were absolutely packed and you couldn't see anything unless you were up front. 

I had tickets in grandstand 6A right near the end of the main straight and it was a really ideal spot. You could catch the cars right as they started braking into T1 and could see DRS overtakes right before. It's also a good location to be in if you plan on doing the post-race track invasion.

On the Friday session if you have a grandstand ticket, you can sit anywhere you want except the Centrale stand in front of the pits. I sat in the stands next to Ascari for a bit and then 6C (which was packed very early on) and 6B. If you plan on taking pictures, Friday is definitely the day to do it. There is a very good general admission area right around second variante and the lesmo corners which is great for pics and seeing the cars up close. I spent a lot of time there on Friday. I walked ~20 miles throughout the day too, definitely make sure you have comfortable shoes and bring some water/snacks. Saturday and Sunday you have to sit in your assigned seat. If you're in the stands bring sunscreen and a hat because you WILL get burned without it. 

The easiest way for me to get there was to take a train to the Biassono Lesmo stop which drops you off a few minutes from the entrance by the second lesmo corner. From there it was about a 30 minute walk to our seats. If you get off at the Monza stop it puts you in the actual city of Monza and you have to take a bus to the entrance of the park (not the circuit) which is about a 1-1.5 mile walk to get in. Our friendly taxi driver brought us right to the track entrance though which was nice. On Sunday they will have free trains that run from Milano Centrale to Biassono Lesmo but it will be SO CROWDED so make sure to leave early. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes to an hour after the race on Sunday to catch a train back from there, the platform is tiny. 

After the race sneak onto the old circuit if you can and climb to the top of the banking, soak in the history and have fun with others doing the same. Monza is absolutely incredible to attend in person, the place has a special feeling to it unlike anywhere else. I plan on being there every year that it's on the calendar from now on.

1165,"I got MM brand new when I was a kid (gold cartridge and all, pre-ordered at Toys R Us), and I got up to Ikana Canyon but couldn't get through it because 1) it was too hard for me back then and 2) it was scary af for me back then. So for a period of ~14 years always in the back of my mind was this empty feeling of defeat/curiosity over never finishing Majora's Mask. I still have my original N64 plus MM, but over time my N64 finally stopped working so I had no way of ever finishing it which bummed me out. 

Fast forward to earlier this year when the new 3DS and Majora's Mask 3D were both released. I bought both on launch day, and over the next two months finally went through the entire game and beat it. The ending combined with my childhood nostalgia/closure made me well up. The game was so different for Nintendo and the Zelda franchise but in such a great, wonderfully put together way.
