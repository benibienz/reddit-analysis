The average Mcdonalds employee makes between $7.25-8.00/hour so in reality by buying irl items with gp has a higher opportunity cost then if you would have just bought it with real money.

So with that perspective you'd have to have requirements in order to get into the Varrock GE since I would see Varrock being mid-level player area where as Lumbridge was the starting gate, but still a pretty low level area. So if you locked Varrock behind requirements youd probably end up rendering it useless. But those are just my thoughts on the matter. Everyones allowed an opinion though of course :)

178,"I liked the event, even though it became repetitive after awhile it was an easy half hour to gain alot of gp and or xp/bxp while also be immersed in some of the lore. Loved the way they handle the treasure chest where you got everything you needed without having to buy keys or get golden tools. But golden tools were there for people that wanted to purchase them
