**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**


I have downloaded and installed Windows 10, as well as all of the suggested drivers for the Asus z170 Motherboard. On completion of this I am trying to change over my graphics from the preinstalled intel graphics that are on the motherboard. When ever I go to give the Sapphire Graphics power it will not give me any displays to my monitor via the VGA cable or DM1 cables. When I take the power off of the Sapphire Graphics card, it returns to displaying. I've tried many of the suggestions from tomshardware but none of that seems to work.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

-Switched Monitors - Same Result - Card Plugged in = No displays | Card not plugged in = Displays Work

-Uninstall Intel Graphics Boot in Safe Mode, Shut down Plug in Graphics Card Reboot, No displays, Unplug graphics card, Intel graphics magically reinstalled them selfs

-Try to download new drivers from CD Rom in Package, Installer Failed

-Try to download new drivers from the Site, Installer Failed

-Opened up BIO's Change Advance Settings of Graphic Configure from Auto to PCIE, Save and Restart, go back into Bios right after and its been changed back to Auto





Im at my wits end with and would really appreciate your help with this.
