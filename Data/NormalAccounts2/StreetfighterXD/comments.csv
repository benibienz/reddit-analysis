16,"**Assessment:**

*Enemy strengths:*

Enemy is a numerically superior force, primarily composed of undead melee infantry.  

Standard modern tactics of massed musket formations would be ineffective against standard slow zombie hordes. No accuracy for headshots, no hydraulic shock for instant bodyshot kills, etc. 
Most modern forces had phased musketeers into their primary line infantry role and relegated pikemen to a support role. 

Both artillery and cavalry would also see diminished effectiveness due to the undead's immunity to shock effects - ie they do not panic. 

Enemy force is also able to convert killed opponents through reanimation but what timescale this can occur over is unclear.

*Enemy weaknesses:*

Increased rate of decay inherent in reanimation spells will cause personnel loss and debilitation in the mainstay undead infantry over time. Depending on climatic conditions estimate enemy to become combat ineffective within 1-2 months.

**Strategic approach:**

*Primary objective:*

Deny enemy movement into friendly territory and thus fresh corpses to reanimate. Project power to frontline and engage in attrition warfare to stop enemy advance.

 
**Tactical approach**:

Three-pronged tactical approach centering on pikemen, cannons and cavalry. Pikemen would pin and block enemy infantry force while cannons and cavalry would be used to target necromancer leaders.

*Infantry*

Like regular infantry zombies would not be able to penetrate a pike thicket without external fire support. Pikes would impale the front 1 or 2 ranks of zombies, which would remain animated instead of collapsing, forming a wall of undead flesh that prevents the ranks behind moving forward. 
Stalemate but in favour of human armies, which have access to heavy fire support.

*Fire support*

With cannons, use solid shot for long-range attacks against necromancers to suppress command and control. Provided necromancy doesn't provide any direct attack or defence spells (ie lightning bolts and force fields), a cannonball hit would instantly destroy them. I'm also assuming that necromancers, while technically undead, retain enough human intelligence and emotion to also feel fear, which means the impact of nearby cannonballs would provide a suppressive effect and reduce their effectiveness as commanders. 
Cannons loaded with grapeshot could also be used on the frontline to shred zombie bodies but would probably have a low cost-effectiveness ratio given loading times and low mobility. Primary use of grapeshot cannons would be to open holes in the undead lines to permit infiltration by human units.

*Cavalry*

Ultimately dragoons and other firearm-wielding cavalry could either outflank the main undead infantry or infiltrate through aforementioned cannon-made breaches to eliminate individual necromancers. This would be the riskiest part of the strategy as cavalry would easily be overwhelmed by enemy infantry if caught in close-quarters combat. The tactic would thus rely on a rapid infiltration, target elimination and exfiltration from enemy lines while avoiding encirclement.

28,"Yeah, there is a 2km-long wire inside the launcher that spools out when the missile is fired and that's what the control commands are transmitted along. 

""ATGM"" stands for ""Anti Tank Guided Missile"", emphasis on ""Guided"" - this is actually the general distinction between 'rocket' and 'missile' in military use - rockets are unguided and just fly in a straight line from when they are launched until they hit something or run out of fuel, whereas a missile can change direction to hit a moving target.  

Many ATGMS use what's called ""Semi Automatic Command Line Of Sight"" or SACLOS, which means the operator has to keep the target in his sights and the missile should fly there automatically. The American TOW (Tracked Optically Wire-guided) ATGM does this.
The Malyutka uses ""Manual Control Line Of Sight"" (MCLOS) which means the missile has to be steered by a guy with a little joystick, which is super tricky. 
Some ATGMS use a long wire that connects the missile to the launcher (wire-guided), others use radio commands (radio-guided) and others shine a laser beam at the target that the missile detects and follows (beam-riding).

Modern ATGMS were developed in the 60s-70s and really changed tank warfare. Used to be that the only thing that could beat tanks was other tanks (and planes, to a lesser extent). So if you had tanks and the other guy didn't, you win.

Then suddenly there were these relatively cheap missiles that could be fired by two guys on a hill that could reliably hit and kill an otherwise invincible tank from a very long way away, often even outside the accurate range of the tank's main gun. You could design a new tank with thicker armour but then someone would just design a new ATGM with a more powerful warhead in it.

It was a big equalizer for modern warfare and only recently have there been improvements in protecting tanks from ATGMs. The Israeli ""Trophy"" system was designed after Israel lost lots of tanks in the Yom Kippur War",2016-11-14 03:28:22+00:00,d9zcnhz,6.0,t1_d9zb6ec,2125.0,CombatFootage

I was reading a statistical/psychological analysis of his given speeches and they found that he concentrated overwhelmingly on the concept that America (and hence, himself) was a subject of mockery by its rivals. ""They're laughing at us"" was the main theme, not ""they are a danger to us"". 

So what I'm concerned about is the Chinese activities in South China Sea and how Trump will react. It's not unrealistic to expect him to drastically increase American naval presence in the area as a show of force (so the Chinese won't 'laugh at us') and that exponentially increases the chance of an armed exchange between US and Chinese forces. 

All it takes is two naval battlegroups within combat range of each other, radars on, weapons armed, crews at attention, and then all that needs is one mistake to be made in the command structure of either force and suddenly there's missiles flying and there's dead Americans, dead Chinese.

103,"PG-13: 80 per cent audience and tickets sold

R-18+: 20 per cent audience and tickets sold

That's the metric they've been working off. We love movies, we treat the good ones as highpoints of human culture. To movie studios, they're just products. Ticket sales-investment=profit. That's how they have the money to fund movies in the first place. 

Deadpool was very important because it's turning that metric on its ass, you can make comic book movies and sci-fi for an R-18 Western audience and still make a cockload of money. 

However the counter to that is the China market, which has recently opened to more foreign films and represents a massive (as in, as big as again) untapped market. To get to the China market however the movie has to pass the Chinese Film Classification Board, which is an instrument of the Chinese Communist Party. China still has by Western standards very conservative rules around film classification so and won't allow films with explicit sex, overt homosexuality, excessive coarse language or percieved pro-Western anti-China themes. 

Best recent examples of China-market films are the Warcraft movie and Independence Day Resurgence. No sex scenes, no real swearing, no overt gayness (IDR snuck some very low-key gayness in) and importantly no complex English wordplay. 

So Deadpool obviously wouldn't fly in the Chinese market but did exceptionally well in the saturated Western market. 

Remains to be seen what long-term trends occurr but expect this dynamic to persist for some time, at least until Chinese studios can produce indigenous films that compete with Hollywood offerings for quality

117,"Presumably, the entire city is obliterated (the Tunguska superbolide was thought to be roughly equal in power to the Castle Bravo nuclear test, or 1000 times the power of Little Boy which was dropped on Hiroshima). 

This causes the near-total decapitation of the French government, instantly killing monarch Charles X and heirs along with his entire court. Notre Dame and the still-under-construction Arc De Triomphe are reduced to rubble. 

The destruction of the city can only be interpreted one way by the inhabitants of 19th-century Europe - an Act of God, vengefully punishing the citizens of Paris for their sinful ways. 

This event reverses European progress toward the Enlightenment begun two centuries earlier and short-term political changes made during the French Revolution. Apocalyptic fervour is capitalized upon by both the Vatican and grassroots religious movements, leading to attempts at religious revolutions in many European cities. A series of religious leaders - the Bishops and Cardinals - take power in Versailles, which becomes the new capital of the Holy French State.

Further effects to the timeline only appear decades into the future.

It walks across the Australian plains searching for food and when it picks up your scent it will never stop pursuing you, like the Terminator. It makes a sound like frogs ahead of the rain like ""WONK WONK WONK"", which looks silly as shit in text but sounds scary as fuck echoing across a floodplain.

193,"""Meanwhile in the newly unified Republic of Korea, heavy riot police units have been deployed in the former North Korean capital of Pyongyang and other northern cities in response to continued rioting and violence. 

Protests continue in the capital of Seoul and other southern cities.

Societal pressures and spiking unemployment caused by the mass migration of largely unskilled refugees from the north after the signing of the Treaty of Vladivostok in April have caused widespread civil discontent in the technologically advanced and consumerist south. 

Meanwhile China has moved more troops and weapon systems into Lioning and Jilin provinces in a bid to stem another tide of refugees pouring north from the former Hermit Kingdom. Clashes between former DPRK military personnel and PLA forces have been reported with UN-backed humanitarian forces repeatedly denied access to the border region. 

Tensions have already risen between the Republic of Korea and longtime rival Japan as the expanded Japanese Navy, recently reformed from the Japanese Self Defence Force (Navy) deploys more vessels to the disputed Senkaku Islands in response to the PLA Navy gaining access to the Sea of Japan. 

ROK president Jae Park called for calm and said that successful reunification, although long-desired by many Koreans both north and south, would take time and effort.""

212,"**TL:DR** Bring 1 card of expensive superheavy tank and 1 or more cards of medium-priced workhorse tank. Use them together for maxium effectiveness. Do not invest soley in superheavies, the enemy will send ATGM planes / choppers to kill them easy. Hide them until you need them, use mediums for your line work. Bring out the superheavies for pushes/repelling pushes.



Superheavies (100+pts) are there to kill mediums (65-85pts), which are there in turn to kill everything else on the ground (except AGTMs and entrenched inf). Light tanks (-50pts) are worthless, buy something with an autocannon/ATGM/GL instead. (the exception to this is the Scorpion 90 available to Commonwealth. 30 points for a suprisingly decent gun and amphibious capability plus a little extra FAV, works great as a sort of sniper FSV/recon hunter in my experience)

In tank-only battles, quality beats quantity. One 150 point effortlessly destroys three 50-point light tanks. Even if their guns can reach the superheavy, they won't dent 20+ Front Armour. 
Two 75 point mediums might get a shot off (ATGM-armed Redfor mediums might even land an ATGM hit and hurt a bit) but the super's return fire will delete them.

However just as the superheavy is the natural predator of the medium tank, the ATGM plane is the natural predator of the superheavy. As soon a the other guy gets eyes on your superheavy, he's gonna throw ATGM planes (A-10, SU25, etc) at it. Usually, unless you see it coming waaaaay off an intercept it with ASF, that ATGM plane is going to kill your superheavy. You might knock it down but it's achieved its purpose.

Yeah ya can lad, but you have to commit to 2 quadstacks of ASLAV-25 (from the recon tab, not the vehicle tab) plus a few mortars and make sure they are perfectly lined up on the starting at pregame.

when game starts, Fastmove em through to the other side of the contested town. Smoke the approach road and the town itself. 
On all but the biggest maps heli inf gets to the central town at more or less the exact same time as motorised inf. Your ASLAVs will burst out of the town at 150kph, autocannons blazing, as the choppers are helpless in descent phase . It's a long shot but if it works you will knock down the majority of the choppers as they are landing, sowing chaos and confusion. If it doesn't work your ASLAVs will get stunned by rocket salvos and then slaughtered by ATGMs and intact disembarked infantry",2016-09-22 05:04:52+00:00,d7x3qec,6.0,t1_d7v9je2,108896.0,wargame

236,"France has been a secular state since the Revolution and they have banned the wearing of many religious items including large Christian crosses and burquas in a bid to curb religious tension in French society. 

It ties into a much bigger geo-social-political issue around Europe and Islam, however. 

Effectively, the (short-lived) Burkini ban translates to a ban on being Muslim in public. It's a signal to anti-Muslim French voters that the party will act aggressively toward Muslims, in response to recent Islamic terrorist attacks and the mass migration issue. Those anti-Muslim voters will welcome it because they think it is the first step on a social/legislative path that includes stopping all Muslim immigration and (in some cases) eventually reaches the expulsion of Muslims from France. The anti-facist elements oppose it for the exact same reason. 

Basically it comes down to progressive multiculturalism versus nationalism. 

To the nationalists, Islam and Muslim is a seen as a threat not just through risk of terrorist attacks but also on a much larger social scale - huge waves of millions of young Middle Eastern / North African (acronym is MENA) men flooding into Europe to pillage, rape and murder. The left and anti-fascists are traitors to France and Europe by enabling this through political correctness taught by 1960s-era socialist professors in government funded universities. 

To the pro-immigration/anti-fascist crowd, the anti-immigration crowd represents the resurgence of violent far-right nationalism transitioning to fascism, and we all know what happened last time fascism got popular in Europe. They designate the people entering Europe as refugee from Western-started oil wars in the Middle East and argue Europe has a responsibility to shelter them and possibly share its wealth. They basically see a possible re-run of Nazi Germany foresee Muslims (and other unpopular minorities) in the place of Jews this time around.

303,"They are real, they are a [carnivorous subspecies of koala](http://australianmuseum.net.au/drop-bear) that ambush prey by - you guessed it - dropping out of trees onto their targets and biting with large teeth. 

They normally hunt smaller prey like wallabies but with the arrival of Europeans they had access to larger prey animals (pigs, especially) and grew larger over time, kind of like feral cats. 

What is exaggerated about them is that they will deliberately attack humans (that's like saying vampire bats will deliberately suck your blood). However like all other Australian wildlife they have been known to attack humans and are dangerous to smaller people and children. 

They are distinctively repelled by the odor of Vegimite (famous Australian vegetable spread) and bushwalkers can protect themselves against dropbear attacks by spreading Vegimite behind their ears, the same way you can fend off magpie/crow attacks by putting zip-ties on your bike helmet",2016-09-06 04:21:24+00:00,d7b4nk3,3.0,t1_d7b0eyd,7331.0,AskReddit

I havent checked the subreddit in a few days and suddenly boom there's all these posts! Awesome to see people liking the game!

Love the feedback, love it. 

While I can't easily make major behavioural changes to the units (auto attacking certain units etc) I can change what damage certain unit types do to other unit types. 

Right now artillery does very little damage to tanks, I've tried to set it up so a tank can quite easily close the distance between itself and the artillery piece and destroy it without taking much damage. Artillery is more for sniping the SAMs and anti-air before sending in the choppers at the moment. 


And.... this is all just a proof-of-concept. I've got a bunch more updates for the demo on the way at the moment (including player chat and a more traditional RTS construction system) and them I'm planning a Kickstarter campaign to develop it into a full game.

So I could for example switch it from a satellite/aerial map to a vector street-style (or pirate-themed) map and suddenly all players would see that change. Likewise for the polygon borders. 

But it's definitely something I'd want players to be able to do in the full version.

415,"Supply routes will be a big part of the game since all you ever read about in military history is how 'they managed to cut off X German supply route' whereas videogames are more about head-to-head clashes. 

Like in Wargame units will need supplies to function (in RULE this will be represented by the Fuel resource which will stand in for not just fuel but also food, ammunition, medicine, spare parts, etc) and it will need to be transported to units before they can use it. The game will set up automatic supply lines from your base to your units at the front when you ask for them but these will be vulnerable to attack. 

So logistics will be very important, even more so than in Wargame. Players wont just be able to steamroll over an entire country - or if they do to fast, they'll end up like the Wermacht on the Eastern front, outrunning their own supply trains and getting cut off. 

Supplies will also need to be transported from where they are generated in the environment (from oil rigs, mines, farms, lumber camps etc) to your base (where your warehouses and fuel silos wills store them). 

So it won't do you any good to take over a valuable resource area if you don't have the capacity to transport those supplies back to your heartland. 

That's about as complex as the economy mechanics will get. 

There will also of course be secondary bases etc that you will be able to fall back from if they are destroyed. 

There's also the Insurgency feature - so say you live in Anytown USA and player xxNooblordxx completely conquers it and covers it with his territory. You can't spawn a regular headquarters in Nooblord's territory but you can put down an Insurgent Hideout, which is much harder for Nooblord to detect, but can only produce low-level infantry and vehicle units. So you can be a thorn in Nooblord's side until he either commits enough resourcez to crush you again or withdraws",2016-08-12 05:34:30+00:00,d6e7bet,,t1_d6e6ihs,1755.0,wargame
416,"Next feature I'm working on is the territory mechanic (which is actually probably the most central mechanic of the game).

So when you place your HQ for the first time it will generate a coloured polygon on the map around your HQ building, about 1 square kilometre's worth. That will be your starting territory. You can only build buildings and extract resources inside your own territory. You will be able to claim surrounding territory using your units (they will have a little 'claim territory' command) and so your territory will expand outwards over time. 

I want to set up Western Front-style showdowns between big players (most likely big player alliances/clans like in Eve or other MMOs) except they will be conquering huge armounts of real-world territory like ISIS or Nazi Germany. 

I want the battles to make the mainstream news, like the big Eve Online battles do.

It's been made on a $2500 shoestring budget and all the code is hodgepodged together. An AAA product this aint, yet. 

Aaaaaalso I should add that that only the APC can cross water, but it can't carry anything (more coding yet to do). 

So by all means turn Hinchinbrook Island into your own personal kingdom. 

My guiding principle behind the game, and what I hope to make it feel like when it's finished, is 'Wargame on Google Maps"". But the whole world is the map. So wherever you live, you can start your empire there and build outwards until you encounter someone else.

I've got the resource system worked out too - instead of command points like in WGRD I will have Cash, Raw Materials and Fuel, all of which have different sources and uses, and you will actually have to get from places that you would in real life - ie you can get fuel from where there are real-life oil and gas fields (like the Middle East) and Raw Materials from where there is lots of mining (like Australia). 

There will be also options to passively extract raw materials and fuel from forests and farmland (because Fuel in the game also represents food and ammunition, like Wargame). 

Cities will generate Cash and all three resources can be traded for one another.

So zoomed out, it will be like Wargame Campaign with a dash of Civilization, zooming in it will be more like Wargame, but in your hometown, firing rocket artillery at the next town over. Take that, you pricks.

444,"There is a decent chunk of British riflemen gunning down Zulu warriors en masse, yeah, but at the end there is a very poignant scene where the Zulus and British both sing at each other, that highlights that they are actually quite similar.

The Zulus are also presented as very brave, willing to literally stand still as living targets for the British so the Zulu commanders can assess their firepower.

It's important to remember that the Zulus were also an aggressive expansionist military empire, just like the British. A generation earlier Shaka Zulu had turned a small African tribe into an army of conquerors, developing innovative military strategies, tactics and equipment such as the ikwla short spear. His nephew Cetswayo continued that trend after Shaka was assassinated by his half-brothers. 

The Zulu Kingdom and the British Empire had been on a collision course since for years. Many innocent tribes such as the Xhosa had been caught between their expansions.

487,"**Wall of text below because I've spent a good few hours thinking about this in the last week or so:**

I was rereading it a few days ago and that's all I could think about, a long-form HBO style adaptation. 

Lots of hurdles though. When you pitch a World War 3 series in 2016 people would expect something set in 2016, with drones and cyberwarfare against China or some vague terrorist group ala later Clancy fare, not against the Red Army in the 80s.

RSR was so popular at the time because everything was cutting-edge, most people hadn't even heard of stealth fighters or anti-satellite warfare or depleted uranium rounds. That's bread and butter to us these days.

So if you wanted to make a show about it you'd really have to double-down on the 80s nostalgia factor, emphasise the haircuts and music and old cars without making it silly. 

'The Americans' on FX does this really well, so it shows it's doable.

But I just don't see it flying these days. For one, the current global dynamic is different. There's no Soviet Union, no monolithic military threat over the horizon with flags and uniforms and clear objectives. It was simpler. Today's bad guys are faceless fanatics that could strike at any time and the increasingly totalitarian security apparatus of our own governments. It makes for a very cynical, paranoid environment where you can't be sure to trust your own state. That never happens in RSR (at least on the US side). 

If you look at the big flagship HBO series right now - House of Cards, Game of Thrones, they tap into that sense we have of being suspicious of our own government, suspicion of state power, surveillance, extrajudicial killings, etc. The engaged viewer is proud of themselves for being aware of the concept of 'power corrupts', not just cheering for their home team. 

RSR's plot begins with a fundamentalist Islamic terrorist attack against a major superpower, kickstarting a major conflict using the latest military technology. Sound familiar?

Good sci-fi or speculative fiction always has a comment to make about the environment in which it is published, not just in which it is set. So Game of Thrones is actually a comment about the corruption of political power in the real world, not just story set in medieval fantasy land. Similarly War of the Worlds (pre-WW1) was about the threat of foreign invasion of a superior military force and Lord of the Rings (written partially in the trenches of WW1) was a comment on the dehumanising horror of large-scale war and industrialisation). 

So a Red Storm Rising series made today would have to be set in the 80s but have something to say about the world of 2016. There's some early easy parallels to take advantage of (a wide-reaching conflict fought with the latest technological advances is started after a terrorist attack against a superpower by fundamentalist Islamic terrorists, for example) but the social commentary doesn't really evolve from there (aside from 'soldiers on both sides are human too'). These days the biggest theme that everyone is exploring is 'well we won World War 2 and the Cold War, the War on Terror is very different, and how are we changing the nature of our own societies as we fight it?) 

That being said I'd love to see the Battle of Alfeld or the Dance of the Vampires directed by Michael Sapotchnik (who directed Hardhome and Battle of the Bastards, the two best battle sequences of Game of Thrones). Shit would be wild.",2016-07-18 01:59:46+00:00,d5gbd1k,4.0,t1_d5gam6t,1335.0,wargame

This was 2009 however. 

As for the Soviet plunging missiles IIRC in the 1980s they didn't have suffiencient accuracy to hit a moving ship, instead they would just have just airburst nukes above the general idea of where carrier battlegroups were. 

Their plane or ship-launched ASHMs might had had top / plunging attack profiles but they'd be moving at much slower speeds than an ICBM, and also wouldn't be able to carry decoys.

492,"Eugene pls buff ECM

But yeah that tied into the contrasting themes of the two armies - the West focused on high-end, high-tech glass cannon units with low availability and lots of ammo consumption. They were running out of shells and ATGMs toward the end. 

The Soviets anticipated this and instead banked on higher availability, fully expecting to take massive casualties in the opening phases of the war but start to make progress once NATO's fancy toys were expended. Their key vulnerability turned out to be fuel shortages, with the huge tank armies extremely greedy for already-scarce diesel. 

A lot of Clancy's predictions were spot-on - even in Desert Storm US munition expenditure was much higher than forecast and the Americans had to initiate emergency restocking programs especially for smart bombs and ATGMs. They always had been very proud of their bombs and missiles that could fly through the window of a building but they hadn't realized that they'd need thousands of them. 

That was another great part in the Dance of the Vampires chapter when the Backfires launch the huge surprise volley of Kingfish anti-ship missiles. Ticonderoga has the fancy Aegis computer-controlled intercept system with all its counter-missiles and CIWS but there were 160 incoming missiles and the ship only has 90 counter munitions. Even though only about five or six missiles end up getting through its enough to kill a troop carrier and cripple several ships including the carrier. 

Makes you think about what could go down in the South China Sea if people make enough bad decisions. 

The PLA have actually adapted one of their ICBMs, the Dong Feng 21, into an anti-ship role. 

Even with the fancy new stealth ships like the Zumwalt, the US ship-defence meta is still based around a Dance of The Vampires scenario - countering a huge number of ship or aircraft-launched anti-ship missiles coming in horizontally a few metres above the water. 

None of it is designed to counter a single massive warhead coming down at a 45 degree angle or higher at Mach 10 or 12, that can deploy its own decoys and dodge from side-to-side. They are designing anti-missile lasers for this exact purpose but even one of those missiles could crack an aircraft carrier in two.

It's just straight up East Vs West, head to head Batman V Superman fight night. No shadowy group of international conspiracists manipulating things behind the scences (aside from the Politburo very loosely I guess). 

Almost all of the characters, Western and Soviet alike, are just loyal soldiers doing their jobs, serving their countries, putting their training an intelligence to use, worrying about families back home, increasingly growing weary and tired of the war. 

For a technothriller writer I think this is one of Clancy's most human books. All the characters are just little cogs in these huge war machines crashing into each other but they're human beings without a doubt.

523,"Every criticism levelled at modern big action movies after Transformers 4 and Pacific Rim 1 can be put down to the China market. 

They have to meet certain criteria to both pass Chinese Government approval and appeal to mainstream Chinese audiences.

These criteria are: Emphasis on visual effects over plot (complex dialogue doesn't translate well into Mandarin / Cantonese but CGI explosions are universally understood and enjoyed), positive depiction of Chinese characters and the Chinese government (Asian-American characters won't cut it, they have to be Chinese nationals), zero sex scenes (subtle flirting is okay) and zero overt homosexuality (which directly clashes with increasing calls for more LGBTI representation in Western cinema. Independence Day 2 struck [a very careful balance with this](https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jun/23/why-independence-day-resurgence-gay-couple-denied-close-encounter) by having two male characters refer to each other as 'baby', hold hands in the face of death and display very close emotional affection, but never kiss or do anything overt). 

This will be the trend in major blockbusters for the forseeable future - simpler plots, no sex (especially no gay sex), lots of CGI. 

The deeper more 'intellectualist' stuff that Western audiences are used to has already moved to long-form TV shows designed to be binge-watched off streaming services (Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, True Detective). These have intricate, complex plots with lots of dialogue, graphic depictions of sex (including homosexuality) and serious violence. 

The big blockbuster movies will continue to be derided by Western critics but continue to be reliable successess in the international (Chinese) market for several decades until Chinese audiences, too, mature their tastes like Westerners have ",2016-07-01 02:56:50+00:00,d4uvhrb,2.0,t1_d4utx3d,2684.0,movies

527,"Also beware the ant-march (single columns of units mindlessly driving into enemy fire). 

This is the number 1 cause of uncessary unit death and ragequitting in Wargame. 

When you deploy a new unit at a location, it is spawned at the base of the closest Reinforcement Zone arrow and is given an automatic Move Fast order to the location you deployed it at (indicated by its blue 'ghost'). 

Never, ever deploy units directly to the front lines. You WILL forget about them (especially on big maps where units take up to 10 minutes to reach the front lines) and they WILL follow that fast move order into the depths of Judeo-Christian Hell itself. 

Always, always, always deploy your units well behind the front lines, preferably into a forest or town, so if you forget about them (which you will) they won't be spotted and gang-fucked by the various sexual predator units available to the other team (artillery, bombers, choppers, etc). 

You will spend most of your playtime zoomed in on the front lines (with your camera spread roughly equal to twice the maximum range of your tank guns). 

Nothing is more relieving that zooming back out for a second during a lull and seeing that group of reinforcements you ordered, fresh and ready just behind the front lines. 

Conversely nothing is more frustrating than paying close attention to your front lines and suddenly hearing the warning BWARR BWARR klaxon and seeing a big bunch those red names pop up because your desperately-needed reinforcements just drove directly into an enemy infantry trap or directly through a pool of burning napalm (they will totally do this).

Also familiarize yourself with unit queuing, which is vital for infantry deployment at early-game. 

Infantry assaults on towns should always be microed (you should be watching them every step of the way ready to alter their orders) but in some situations you will need to send out a lot of infantry on different missions (for example setting up a spread-out ATGM / MANPAD net). 

Infantry transports are there to get infantry to the front lines then fuck back off to the rear (unless they are the stronk Soviet IFVs). 
You never want your infantry sitting still on the front line in their transports. They'll take 1 hit, explode and take your infantry with them. 

What I do is order all the various infantry squads where I want them to go (towns and forests only, never open ground) individually. Then, select the whole column of infantry transports, hold Shift, click Unload, then click Fast Move and then click somewhere nice and safe behind friendly lines (then release shift). 

Order queuing issues new orders to units as soon as they complete previous orders, regardless of timing. If done right, the transports should drive in, dump troops directly into cover, and drive out. If not done right, everyone will die horribly",2016-07-01 02:37:06+00:00,d4uuszl,,t1_d4u8urz,,wargame

529,"Using the missiles only on the Tunguska also has the added benefit of luring out the enemy SEAD plane, which can ONLY target units with Radar Guided weapons active. SEAD planes also have exceptional ECM (flares) which means they are pretty well protected against IR missiles. The trick is to wait for the SEAD plane to come out then either send your own fighters after it or wait for it to overfly the Tunguska (which is unlikely because your opponent will likely monitor it the whole way since it's such a valuable unit) and then turn on the guns once the Tunguska is out of the line of fire. 

This isn't just a game about sending huge waves of tanks. There is a very knife-edge-duel meta mechanic amongst the top-tier units, most of which pay for themselves many times over if used against low-tier units. 

As said previously in the thread, 170 points of T-72BU will absolutely shred 800 points of low-tier 50-point Blufor tanks, even if they rush all at the same time. 

That 170 point T-72 can die to a 100-point ATGM plane or chopper quite easily, however, so you need an 80-pt Tunguska to guard it, plus 50-point recon so it can see far enough to use its ATGM effectively, and so on and so forth. 

Never sink the majority of your points into a single unit type. Your opponent will just spend less points buying its counter and you'll lose.

534,"Okay let's run through the scenario. 

China is Australia's primary trading partner. China is also the US's primary trading partner. Trading is integral to the economy of all three countries. 

China's economy has exploded and they are rapidly expanding military capabilities. They are laying claim to the South China Sea (and by extension the entire Western Pacific, which the US has held since beating the Japanese in World War II). 

Let's say the US Navy mounts a naval challenge to the PLA Navy. 
There's three outcomes to that:

1 - the Chinese back down and dismantle their various island bases, suffering a humiliating political defeat and likely leading to political dissent / turnover inside the Chinese government. This outcome is unlikely, given the Politburo has already committed to building the bases and thus committed themselves to claiming the South China sea and the riches it contains.

2 - The Chinese government refuses to back down and in response the US withdraws, ceding control of the South China sea. The US, in turn, suffers the same humiliating loss of prestige and its role as international security provider is increasingly questioned. This encourages yet more expansionism from China and Russia, leading to yet more annexing and invasions elsewhere in the world in the next several decades, possibly leading to large-scale wars.

3 - Both the US and China refuse to back down and at some point a shot is fired by one of the navies. Depending on decisions made by leadership this shot is returned and a battle commences. The US Navy's superior technologies inflict serious damage on the still-outdated Chinese navy but the Chinese deploy the repurposed [Dong-Feng ICBM in an anti-ship role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DF-21#DF-21D) and sink several US ships including nuclear aircraft carriers. 
Where it goes from there is anyone's guess, but it's nowhere good. If it's a war, Australia backs the US and becomes a target for Chinese strikes on Darwin and other bases. If there's simple diplomatic and economic fallout, Australia still has to choose between China and the US as major trade partners, akin to a single child choosing which divorced parent to live with. In all likelihood we would choose the US, thus losing our lucrative Chinese markets. 
The US-China trade relationship is the most important in the world and is the 'drive shaft' of the global economy. War between the US and China would cause economic impacts never before seen in human history.

Language like this indicates you consider geopolitics to be some sort of umpired game with rules and everyone gets equal footing. It's not. 

It's more like gangland warfare. Only strength prevails in the end. China is rapidly increasing its strength, which means it feels confident to make moves like this.

Is it morally right? No, but neither were the invasions of Iraq or Ukraine and they happened anyway, because they were performed by big countries with powerful armies. China's watched that happen with little meaningful consequence to the invaders and figures it wants a piece of the action itself.

So China's subject to international law. How would you propose we enforce that law? Trade embargoes? China is the world's supplier of domestic products and the world's consumer of raw material, this would cause economic chaos, especially to countries like Australia and the US.

542,"yeah obviously they would need to design new campaign scenarios with different setups aimed at increasing balance. Maybe give players more control over what units appear in the reinforcement menu and when, perhaps. It just seems like something that would be easy enough to do, even with 4 or 5 players per side. Coalition vs coalition would make a lot of sense, with each player controlling a faction within the coalition. 

The campaigns have to fall back on hold-back-the-horde scenarios because the AI is so terrible and cheesy and that's the only way to provide sufficient challenge. 

But just like you said if you add a second player that artificial suddenly vanishes, and is replaced by actual human difficulty. 

Also Im just spitballing here but what about 'campaign-level' decks? Just as players design their own decks made up of unit cards to take into battles, why not let them design strategic-level decks made up of 'battle-level' deck cards to take into the campaign?

Right now the meta of the multiplayer game is balanced toward coalitions and high-end units (SOVKOR protos versus NORAD protos). 

That's because the game is mainly 30-to-60 minute engagements then suddenly BAM all over, reset. Everything is short-term. Investing in large numbers of cheese units is a waste, because you'll never bring them in enough time and volume to counter the protos.

But what if you couldnt throw B-5s or T90s at M1A1IPs with gay abandon because you needed to save them for the next battle, like campaign makes you do?

Community numbers still pretty deece, lad. 

You can do 1v1s on any map except the big 10v10 maps I guess. Even though 1v1s go off they're a major fuckaround to try and manage all the units, stick to team games.

Controls are a bit fiddly if you're unfamiliar but you either get the hang of it quicksmart with hotkeys and all that shit or get repeatedly rekt like New South Wales at Origin.

561,"I'm just saying if that was their attempt at censorship it was pretttttttty amateur. Did it fool you? 

Didn't fool anyone else either. 

But again I get it. You're anti-Libs, anti-big business, anti-authority. That's fine, that's natural, especially for an /r/aus poster. It's all good.

But if you were here on the ground in FNQ, involved in the actual Reef conservation process, you wouldn't be making statements to the effect of 'tourism companies are helping destroy the Reef for profit'. The reality is actually quite the opposite. 

I didn't mean to take it this far but I myself actually am involved in Reef conservation, professionally. One of the most important principles we operate under is stakeholder engagement and cooperation - everyone whose actitives affect the reef, including tourism operators, farmers, developers, etc - need involved in the negotiation / solution process. 

That's the only way to produce an actual positive outcome for Reef health. Otherwise it's 'us versus them' instead of 'let's work together'. Pointing fingers at them and saying 'you're destroying the reef' gives you a lot of Year 12 anti-authoritarian environmentalist cred, but that merely makes them into an adversary, not a partner. 

Now you'd say 'but we can't let them get away with it' or 'you're an apologist' or 'they're all colluding with their mates in big business/government etc' and that's also fine, but how's that strategy been working out so far? Stopped any bleaching? 

These guys are more than used to being accused of bad guys and they're pretty sick of it. Bringing them in and giving them a seat at the table gives us an opportunity to come up with some legislative/regulatory environmental framework that might actually work from their perspective. The alternative is what happened beforehand - the farmers, the tour operators, the devs, they all throw their support behind candidates that can campaign against 'inner city greenies' who 'don't understand north queensland' - and that WORKS. Thats one of the features of democracy. 

Just sitting back and saying 'Queensland is a mob of anti-environmental bogs intent on destroying their precious natural gifts' doesn't change the political reality. 

The negotation process however does exactly that, slowly, over time, with great effort.

What undoes that effort, in mere moments, is comments like yours. 

Hence my massive reply.

568,"This'll end up with nothing but a 0 comment score because you'll downvote me and no-one else will read it, but what the hell, I've got five minutes spare:

&gt;Show me tourism operator reports which identify nature, scale or cause of reef problems

[Quicksilver Tours in Cairns performs daily Reef Health Information surveys at Agincourt Reef and others through their BioSearch program](http://www.quicksilvergroup.com.au/products/reef-biosearch.html). 
Quicksilver also contributed vital surveying data on bleaching to GBRMPA's Coral Bleaching Task Force and the Department of Environment for the recent mass bleaching event.

[The Association of Marine Park Tourism carries out the primary control program against the Crown of Thorns Starfish, which has killed more coral than bleaching and cyclones combined in the last 10 years](http://www.ampto.org/services.html).
AMPTO, too, provided invaluable bleaching survey data to the Bleaching Taskforce and the Department of Environment for the recent mass bleaching event.

That took me about 30 seconds. I could go on. As for the actual reports, they're available on request (or in the websites, I didn't look to deep but then again I was trying to make a point)

But anyways let's get to the second sentence.

&gt;they cash in on an endangered natural resource

Technically, you're not wrong. The Reef is their primary source of income because it's what people are paying to see. But people are paying to see healthy, vibrant coral, not bleached or destroyed coral. So even by the logic of cold, hard capitalism, tour operators have a vested interest in *preserving* the Reef, not destroying it.
But hey if you want to see them as Captain Planet villains instead of the front line of Reef defence, your call. You're not correct, but your call.

Third sentence: 
&gt;our government censors information about the reef's problems because they fear it might affect tourism income

Again, about 30 seconds on Google gets me [a media release from Greg Hunt in April](https://www.environment.gov.au/minister/hunt/2016/mr20160407.html). The first line is 'the current coral bleaching event impacting the Great Barrier Reef is major and significant'.  
Whole lotta censorship going on there, obviously, when the Environment Minister is pointing out how bad things are from the get go.

But hey like I said this comment wasn't going to change your mind, it never was. I get that, it's fine. And now maybe by this stage I've shot my mouth off enough that the downvotes will get to double digits, not just -1 or -2, because I'm going against the narrative.

582,"All great suggestions. However I've already exceeded my budget for features in the game. I'll be launching a kickstarter soon to fund the addition of extra features and hopefully that will lead to the development of RULE into a fully-fledged AAA game. 

The full version will include all of the features you mention, including advanced pathfinding (right now land units CAN cross bridges but only using Road Movement, this is a little button in the top left on PC and at the bottom of the screen on mobile. Select your units, move them onto a road, toggle road movement on, and order them to move to a location, also on a road, on the other side of the river. They should cross the bridge). 

There'll also be a wide variety of defensive-oriented units including engineer units that can lay landmines, construct barricades like barbed wire, sandbag walls and tank traps, also specialized infantry squads with anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile launchers. 

Units will also be able to 'dig in', which will greatly boost their stealth and cover bonuses but render them immobile. 

I'm more than keen to get more players into the game in its current state. Why not share it with your friends, if they're into the same genre of games? I've found a lot of people are a little hesitant to share their email address (usually fearing identity theft and spam) but this version of RULE only uses the email address for password recovery. New players can make up a totally random email address that doesnt lead anywhere if they want, as long as it uses regular email format.

A quota system for women/indigenous/immigrants would breed resentment in a really big way. 

Quotas are inherently anti-meritocratic. They don't actually close opportunity gaps between demographic groups, they artifically (and temporarily) close outcome gaps instead. Essentially they'd be band-aids, but worse. 


Besides, the whole concept flies in the face of modern equity theory (that someone's gender/race/belief/characteristic X shouldn't affect their chances for success in society, only their intelligence and abilities). 

So think about what the response would be from the alt-right, when they can hold up examples of women or Indigenous people in positions of power and wealth and say 'they only got there because they were female or black, this is why you can't get a job'.

668,"Hi everyone - 

Thanks for checking out the game!

This is a really basic free-to-play proof of concept of what RULE could be. 

If you didn't know, RULE is my pet project, a free-to-play browser-based massively multiplayer real time strategy game that's played over satellite maps of the real world. 

The demo version in the link is played on limited geographic regions made using Mapbox.com. 

The idea is that the full version of RULE will be played on a map of the whole world, so no matter where youre from you can turn it into a battleground with your friends.  

In the meantime, new maps of new areas can be made and featured in the game. Put a request for an area (think an area around a city, not a whole country) in the comments and it could end up as the next playable map.

This demo's been made on a shoestring budget so features are really limited at the moment and there's all the regular bugs (frame rate stutter, connection issues, gameplay issues, server crashes etc). Stick with it, though, and it can be a lot of fun. 

Soon I'll be launching a Kickstarter campaign to try and raise funds to turn RULE into a fully fledged game with a map of the whole world. It will still (and always) be free-to-play. If you think it's a fun idea (I sure do) then why not think about contributing?

Wargame occurs on a smaller scale but the closest we get to it is the ability of SEAD planes to fire radar-seeking missiles against SAM vehicles. In Red Storm Rising it's a whole mechanic/system that's critical to the outcome of battles.

I used to be very ideological about the Great Barrier Reef and argue with my bogan FNQ mates about it. I was like 'guys we need to stop the Libs / coal industry / climate change because the Reef will be gone in 100 years if we don't'.

Of course it's gonna be a political football, because everything important is a political football these days (the last example of bipartisan support I can remember was supporting the 2003 invasion of Iraq).

 Labor had my environmentalist vote prior to this but the Libs have seen their $500 mil and raised them a billion, so guess who gets my vote now. 

Like I've said elsewhere, climate change is the Big Bad of this whole saga, (the Darth Sidious, if you wil)l, but you won't solve it without the big players (US, China, Russia) at the table, and they aren't at the moment, so let's focus on battling the short-term immediate problem of water quality (the Darth Maul, if you will). 

I've got no love for the coal industry whatosover but the narrative from the Greens and elsewhere in the conservation sphere has unfortunately boiled down to a literal three-word-slogan, ""Coral not coal"" (it's stapled over the mouths of Liberal and Labor's candidate's faces on election signs all the way through Cairns).

If it comes down to coral versus coal, that translates to environment versus economy. The Australian people have consistently chosen economy as the more important issue time and time again, and the conservation lobby just keep deploying the same messaging time and time again, and keep losing, time and time again. I reckon if we're going achieve meaningful protection for the Reef we have to change that messaging. But that's just my take. 

An interesting aside here - it's waaaaay better news when a conservative government announces significant environmental funding because there's much more chance of that promise actually surviving long enough to be carried out. When progressive governments promise big, conservative governments often get elected on a platform of 'undoing reckless spending' and environmental spending is a prime target for slash and burn. 

Campbell Newman's government was an excellent example of this, undoing much of the Bligh Government's environment commitments. 

If conservationists were smart they would focus their lobbying and deal-making on conservative parties, not progressive parties. We don't know who the next leader of the Liberal Party (and consequently the next conservative Prime Minister) will be. It could be some hardnose like Scott Morrison or a crazy like Cory Bernardi. So we don't know how much of Labor's big spending promises they're going to slash. 
However regardless of who's in the top seat they're less likely to slash their *own* commitments then they are to slash Labor's. 

Food for thought anyways

740,"The other less-discussed advantage of mortars is the ability to quickly generate walls of smoke where you want them. 

Tube arty does create larger individual puffs of smoke but they are less reliable in creating a long unbroken line of smokepuffs, plus you want your tube arty to be lobbing HE and actually killing things as opposed to mortars which can only really stun all but the squishiest targets. 

I make a point of taking at least one wheeled mortar carrier with my armour if only for the purpose of dropping smoke on my own superheavies when theres a chopper or ATGM plane incoming. 
When you run into land ATGM units you can use the mortar to blind them or stun them into total inaccuracy. 

This can give you a big edge in fights particuarly when a 30-point mortar carrier can neuter the primary advantage of a 150-point Soviet superheavy tank. 

Like Sandy says in the guide, smoke is also a complete necessity for infantry assaults against vehicles. There's nothing like blanketing a treeline full of ATGM carriers and tanks with smoke then nipping a few transports full of infantry over no-man's land.

745,"The more I watch of this season the more I keep seeing it as a giant mixed RPG/RTS game (the ""Real-Time Strategy Role Playing Game Of Thrones"", if you will). 

Each episode is one 'turn' of the game, split into different phases including like Strategy, Engagement, Dialogue, Recruitment, etc.

Every named character in the show is a playable character with a different skill build, divided between two primary skill trees, (Combat and Intrigue). 

Each primary tree divides into many different sub-trees, for example the Combat tree includes Swordsmanship, Archery, Stealth, Command, Armour, Agility, etc while the Intrigue tree includes Disguise, Convince, Seduce, etc. 

Characters also have inherent perks and talents like Attractive (eg Margery, Danerys, Loras) , Economics (Littlefinger, Tchyo Nestoris), Strong (Sandor Clegane, Gregor Clegane) etc that affect their skills. 

Gameplay would consist of a mixture of large-scale strategy like the Crusader Kings or Rome Total War GOT mods, third-person action games like Assassin's Creed or the Witcher 3 and conversation trees like the Telltale Games series. 

One of the standout elements of the show is how quickly characters' fortunes change. Daenerys is a good example, rapidly gaining, then losing, then gaining again massive forces. 
Often they do this in a single scene by convincing or betraying another character or taking advantage of some legal/custom mechanism like inheritance. 

This would be reflected in-game by the importance of Recruitment Events (a character has an opportunity to rapidly recruit a large number of units). Often these two would be tied together, but not always (for example in 'The Broken Man' Jon Snow succeeds in a critical Recruitment Event and secures the Wildling army by passing a Convince Test on the Wildling clan leader, with Tormund's assistance. However he later fails a Convince Test on Robbet Glover, even with Sansa's assistance, and therefore fails the Recruitment Event. 
However, Danerys achieves her massive Recruitment Event by assassinating the Dothraki Great Khals (who aside from Khal Moro are unnamed and therefore just high-level NPCs).)

This would differentiate the RTS aspect of the RTSRPGOT, because in most RTS games, units are produced by securing resources and investing them in unit construction / upgrades.

In my GOT game the focus on unit production would instead switch to a focus on gaining unit loyalty, which is where Intrigue skills would be of assistance.

The visual tone of that film is exactly in line of what I imagine while reading Reacher books. Bleak, cereberal, sudden bursts of intense violence, grey characters, forays into clinical horror. 

Brolin would be a satisfactory Reacher for sure. My pick for matching Reacher's experience has always been [Chance Kelly](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0446257/) (Godfather from Generation Kill). 

Blunt would do fine in Brolin's role as the mysterious CIA agent, recruiting Reacher off the street/in some scenario to do the Mexico mission. That does compromise the cynical reason the FBI are involved in the first place but whatevs

Heres my advice, the next time Eid is on (it's the end of Ramandan and it changes every year so you have to look it up) try rocking up to a mosque and say you're intersted in learning about how they do things. Odds are they will sit you at a table and start feeding you all kinds of delicious food (it's part of the Eid deal, it's a big feast to end the fasting period so they do a massive cookup and essentially open the mosque to anyone). 

If it were up to me I'd swap out one of the existing boring public holidays and make Eid a public holiday like Christmas.

Nah everyone knows the top level red tanks are apex predators that have evolved to prey on blue tanks. You have to think outside the box to defeat them, not just send your superheavies on suicide charges, thats some World War 1 shit.

Tell you what's got longer range than an ATGM? Mortars. They are the natural predator of the light ATGM carrier and they are also extremely useful against ATGM-equipped red tanks.
Bring a single 30-point mortar carrier with your tanks, bind it to a control group (I use 4 for mortars and 3 for arty) and you can constantly be popping smoke pretty much anywhere you like, well beyond your own tanks' area of operations. Their pinzy little shells won't actually hurt a T-80U but they'll contribute to stun/suppression enough to knock down the chance of a successful ATGM hit at maximum range. 

So that helps neutralize the ATGMs

849,"It's probably because I'm terrible at this game but in my experience flanking tanks is not worth dividing the forces. 

Unless you're facing some mythical superheavy like that 170pt Japanese Shiki with 20 front armour, the mechanics of it don't really work out, and even then they don't with non-ATGM launching units.

The range, power, turret rotation speed and hull turn speed of most modern tanks in the game means they're quite well protected against flanking attacks from other tanks, especially if you're sending an equal amount of points against them.

Say you have two 50pt cav tanks versus a 100pt heavy tank. If they don't have ATGMS the cav tanks can't really damage the heavy through its front armour so you try to flank it, right?

So you send one cav tank straight at the heavy and another around on a flanking mission. 

EVEN if you manage to perfectly time it and your flanking tank doesnt get ambushed by hidden infantry or ATGMs or picked off by a chopper or jet, that heavy is just going to kill the first cav tank in one or two hits with its heavier gun, and then by the time the flanking cav tank even gets within range it's going to have rotated - if not its entire hull at least its turret - to then do exactly the same to the flanking tank.

Unless you have more points to spend flanking is a net loss, and if you've got more points to spend, why not just buy your own heavy to go head-to-head with the other heavy? Or buy an ATGM chopper? You're far less likely to run into ambushes doing a super risky flank manouver.

Heavy tanks have one window of vulnerability against lighter tanks and that's the time it takes them to turn their turret and hulls to present their gun and front armour. That's like two or three seconds, tops. It's certainly less time that a mad dash out of cover for a light tank, which probably won't even get that far because it runs into hidden inf or gets poached by a passing chopper or jet.

My two cents, anyway",2016-06-01 01:54:28+00:00,d3r7h33,3.0,t1_d3qrmdb,23230.0,wargame

851,"""1/3 of the Great Barrier Reef dying"" is completely inaccurate and is an example of why they tried to remove references in this report.

35 per cent of coral in the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef has experienced fatal bleaching. That's in the very article you linked. That's one third of one third. Not a third of a total. 

This is exactly why because the actual data on bleaching gets misreported, then exaggerated, then there's a worldwide perception that half or the entire Reef is gone or will be gone shortly and it's just not accurate. 

What happens then is the thousands of people that were going to come and spend millions of dollars visiting the reef - thus providing one of the main sources of funding for Reef recovery and awareness - don't any more. 

So misreporting can both destroy the FNQ tourism economy AND actually hinder efforts to help the Reef recover in the same go.

Not saying that bleaching hasn't happened or that a lot of coral isn't going to die - it is - but it'd be much better if we used the actual real-world numbers instead of manufacturing a doomsday scenario out of Chinese Whispers.

But nah as long as we're aggressively criticising the government it's OK, right? Never mind the hundreds of millions of dollars, the dozens of agencies like GBRMPA and AIMS and the National Environmental Science Programme or anything like. 

What's important is that we always consider anyone in a position of power to be bad guys, because that makes us the good guys becuse we're not in positions of power.

857,"Let me weigh in on this as a former FNQ journo that has written a lot about crocs in the past. 

It's not as simple as 'oh that Krazy Katter, what a character, how bout we cull idiots instead, hur hur'.

The question is 'what happens when one takes a kid?' Not a bumbling tourist but a local kid at the beach in broad daylight? Attacks like that have happened before. Where does the sympathy / outrage go then?

Yes, the crocs were there first, but their population is expanding back after the big culling programs were stopped in the 70s.

So, despite the constant and increasing awareness efforts from local councils, government bodies and environment groups, the odds of encounters between humans and crocodiles continues to increase. 

This time it was a tourist swimming where it really wasn't wise to swim and vastly increasing her odds of being hit by a croc. Really not smart on her part.

But the more the crocodile and human populations expand - FNQ is one of the fastest growing regions in the country - the more the likelihood goes up, even when people are doing their best to be smart and not be in the water when the crocs are. It's just mathematics. 

And as we've seen, awareness isn't always enough to prevent it happening. 

There are plans being kicked around to set up exclusion zones around population centres where any croc found within a certain distance of a population centre is immediately culled, while crocs found further out are trapped and relocated.

888,"That analogy doesn't stack up at all. Fires consume all available fuel if left unattended. That's not how bleaching works. There's also no equivalent to a fireman's hose that can instantly stop bleaching if the requisite will is found. 

What it's more like is a big garden, which is wilting worse and worse every summer. So you can water the garden but the wilting continues. How do you fix this? You can look into the soil you've got the garden planted in, the amount of sunlight they are getting, even if your airconditioner is venting straight into the garden bed (as mine does, in my actual real-life house. Not good for garden health). 

Now if your only worry is one of those aspects, say, the sunlight, and you put up a shadecloth then go about your business thinking that will stop the wilting, you'll likely be unpleasantly surprised when it keeps happening. However if you diagnose more causes of the problem and treat them you've got a better chance of saving your garden and enjoying its flowers for years to come. 

Only focusing on climate change - and manifesting that as only criticising the LNP (which I've got no allegiance to mind you) for supporting the coal industry (which I've also got no allegiance to) isn't ACTUALLY going to stop bleaching, at all. It's far to easy to counter that argument by wheeling out the old 'jobs and growth' mantra, and it's working.

So, since we can't fix climate change overnight, by ourselves (even if by some miracle the Greens took power and banned all Australian fossil fuel use and production immediately, China would make up for it in about nine to ten months), we can look at the stuff we can actually do something about here and now. 

At the top of that list is water quality. Hence the post.

But nah you're probably right. Let's label any deviation from the 'down with the the fat cats' narrative as apologism. I'm sure enough downvotes and Guardian articles will reverse climate change soon enough",2016-05-30 07:33:22+00:00,d3oxo2m,3.0,t1_d3owdb8,3846.0,australia

893,"Quick bit of background for me here so you understand why I made the post. 

Awareness is great but can be counterproductive if not handled correctly. There's a lot of steps between 'awareness of problem' and 'solution of problem', and bad awareness can stop those steps from being taken.

I work in Reef conservation, specifically the media section of an environment science organisation in North Queensland. You won't find many more people interested in keeping the Reef healthy than us. 

Since it's our actual job - it comes down to us, not Greenpeace or the WWF - to deliver solutions instead of just identifying issues, we have to approach the issue in a non-absolutist way. We source the majority of our funding from the Queensland and Australian Governments and we also work closely with tourism, agricultural and other industry groups (because these are the guys that are having the biggest day-to-day interaction and impact on the reef.) Everyone wants to help, but everyone's also got stakes in how they currently do business and how they currently affect the Reef. That translates to 'we have to play a bit of politics' in order to get any changes happening.

Now, the coverage on the bleaching event has been global. All over the world. Most of the data they're using has been pretty accurate. About 50 per cent coral mortality in the northern section, less than 30 per cent in the central section and basically none in the southern section.  However thats too long for a headline and journalists will always go for the maximum impact possible (I know this because I used to be one). So the headlines say 'HALF OF REEF DEAD' or '95 PER CENT OF REEF BLEACHED'. Go into the actual text and it clarifies '95 per cent of the reef has experienced SOME FORM of bleaching (this can be very minor)' or that half of SOME INDIVIDUAL REEFS have died (which is tragic and is the problem we're trying to solve). 

What happens when people read the headline but not the article (as about 80 per cent of readers do) is they start wondering who to blame. The most obvious target is the coal industry (supported by the current government). So that's them out of the negotiating room. Second is the cane and banana farmers on the Queensland coast. So that's THEM out of the room and back to their farms doing thing the way they also did things. 
Third, if they're planning on visiting the Reef, they cancel their tickets. No point seeing dead coral, right. So that's millions lost out of the FNQ economy and the tourism industry out of the negotiating room.

So any deal you were trying to set up, to maybe secure an extra few million for monitoring or to educate farmers about best practice or to get the tour industry to distribute pamphlets or endorse messages is all gone. Off the table. So we go back to square one, again, the Reef is still screwed and we're all just angry at each other. 

Now people down in Brisbane and Sydney and Melbourne can make statements like 'this is all because of climate change, which is all because of coal, which is all supported by the LNP, screw the LNP and screw coal, and while we're at it screw the cane farmers and the tourism industry, they're getting rich from destroying our precious Great Barrier Reef'. They can do that quite easily. But in two more weeks the issue will have moved completely out of the media cycle and will only pop up in the Environment news section yet again. People in Brisbane and Sydney and Melbourne will go back to discussing other issues as they did before. 

But the problems on the Reef will remain. Runoff will remain. Job losses in the tourism industry will remain. And, unfortunately, even if the Greens get elected and they stop all coal mining overnight, climate change will remain. 

So that's how it works, from my perspective. We'd like to think that by spreading enough awareness we can solve all the problems of the world. It's a very optimistic and first-year-uni view of the world. However in reality, solving big problems is much more about long negotiation, compromise and more compromise. We leave the hand-wringing people who don't have a horse in the race.",2016-05-30 04:49:55+00:00,d3otym0,3.0,t1_d3ormnz,4760.0,australia
894,"Yeah but to stop the coal mine you've got to get between Indian magnates with billions of dollars and MORE billions of dollars, and convince the Queensland and Australian governments that doing so would gain them more votes then they'd lose. Go for your life. The Murdoch press will paint you as an anti-development hippie like the rest and you'll be ignored.

Got a solution for that aside from 'I hope people don't read Murdoch press?' Me neither. 

Tell you what makes the job harder though. 

So say we get Greg Hunt up to Cairns (which we did) to talk about bleaching and how we're going to fix it. We get the cane famers, the tour operators, the scientists and the politicans (all the people you need to fix the problem) to come to the table. Gravy. Let's get working OH NO WAIT a bunch of dreadlocked protesters in tie-died shirts that smell of patchouli oil have rocked up with signs saying CORAL NOT COAL. 

So instead of talking about ways to reduce coastal runoff instead we're now talking about how fucking annoying hippies are and nobody's at the table and we're back to square one. 

So thanks, fuckwits, you've derailed the negotiations that might have actually resulted in a positive outcome for the Reef but hey at least you got to chant slogans on national TV. Clap yourselves on the back and spend some more Greenpeace money on dope. 

If I sound a bit personally involved in this, it's because I was. 

The coal mine, associated construciton, transport and waste are all going to have an environmental impact but they're also going to generate a (highly variable depending on who you talk to) amount of jobs.

Guess which issue was number one in importance to both Coalition and Labor voters? Jobs. Guess what was number five? The environment. Which number comes first? No cheating on your fingers, now. 

So no, you're not wrong. And no, things aren't as black and white as my statement. They're grey. Endless, convoluted political clusterfucks of grey. Only through lubing up and diving arse-first into that clusterfuck can we actually hope to come out the other side with an intact Reef, however. Blaming it all on coal is the opposite. It sounds noble, but it's counterproductive.",2016-05-30 04:31:05+00:00,d3otg01,3.0,t1_d3oqah7,6104.0,australia
895,"Aw goddammit this again. At no point have I ever said that climate change wasn't the primary factor. **Climate change is the primary factor.**
All I'm saying is water quality is the overlooked exacerbating factor that results in these extreme mass bleaching events by lowering  the health and resilience of coral. 

The reason *why* I'm pointing this out is not that I'm a paid shill for the coal industry (that's /u/whtyiederp's role), it's because water quality, specifically sediment, fertilizer and nitrogen runoff, is something that we can take direct action against. Right here, right now, in the current election cycle. It's something that's achievable by the Queensland and Australian governments on their own. 

Climate change, well that's a global thing, because, you know, one atmopshere per planet. To stop climate change you have to convince basically the entire population of the world using fossil fuels and switch to renewables, countering centuries of historical inertia and the vested interest of some of the most wealthy and powerful organisations in the world. If you've got a way of doing that in the next few years, let us know, it'd be dead handy. 

To improve Reef water quality you need to convince less than a thousand cane and banana growers to change up their farming practices a little bit. (well, that and make some major capital dredging projects extremely expensive for their backers). Just things like GPS-tracking their tractors so they don't compact dirt as much or using subsurface fertilizer gear instead of sprayers. They are mainly old grumpy Italian men so it'll take some convincing but it's totally doable. That's why I'm focusing on it, because it might actually contribute to fixing things soon.

If you want to push the climate change thing, that's fine, you're not wrong. But like I said unless you've got a quick fix for the paramount challenge of human civilization in the 21st century, how's about we *just consider for a second* some smaller-scale stuff we can do in the meantime?

South of that there's less than 1 per cent mortality, which is well within average.

Is there a mass bleaching event? Yes. Is a lot of coral going to die? Yes. As much coral as being reported in the papers? No.

Is 95 per cent of the entire Reef bleached? No (95 per cent of the reef has experienced 'some form of bleaching' which can include extremely minor bleaching akin to a sunburn that will quickly be recovered from). 

Does climate change cause bleaching? Yes (but this year there was also an el Nino effect added on top of climate change)

Will protesting the Adani coal mine stop bleaching? Not a goddamn chance.

951,"'Oppressed' is a serious word. It implies active efforts to dominate, destroy, etc. 

That's not whats happening here. The rich are just looking after their own and using their resources to maximise their opportunity. The poor lack the same resources and hence can't maximise their opportunity. That's just the difference between rich and poor. No-one is actually going out of their way to stop through legal or forceful means a plumber's daughter from being the next prime minister or richest Australian. 

Yes that plumber's daughter does have a lower chance of achieving that compared to a graduate of the King's School, but them's the breaks. The system's designed to provide equitable opportunity, not equal result. Every experiment with providing equal result has led to bigger problems - corruption, inefficiency, actual oppression - than they solved. Look at Cuba, Venezuela, Russia, China. 

So yeah, the rich run Australia, but the rich run everything, and have since we started putting grain in pots at the start of the Stone Age. That's how the systems have developed. I'm all for changing the system but if we deploy language like ""oppressed underclass"" it gets waaaaay too easy to make us an object of ridicule like I just did. 

""What are you complaining about? There's kids getting their hands cut off by ISIS for being Kurdish and you're claiming you're on the same level because rich kids went to a better fancier school? Pull ya head in lad"" - that's what the average working adult Australian will think of this. Not because they're brainwashed by Murdoch, not because they're trying to suppress dissenting youth, but because they're comparing their own lives and childhoods with ours and seeing a fuckload of complaining instead of hard work and perseverance. 

That's why articles like this, and arguments like yours, are ultimately counter productive to the desired outcome, which is -ostensibly- increased quality of life and individual opportunity for all Australians regardless of birth circumstance. Because they're too easy to construe as loud complaining to cover personal shortcomings instead of actual identification of flaws in the system.

There are poor people, middle class people and rich people. This has been true of every post-hunter-gatherer human society.

The language 'oppressed underclass' is completely unwarranted. It evokes imagery of despotic regimes like the Nazi Party or the Khmer Rouge. 

Putting working-class Australians that didn't attend private schools in the same class as, for example, the Kurds, the Hazara or the Tibetan people, or the Tamils, or other actual oppressed underclasses cheapens the meaning of the term.

No Australians are regularly pulled from their homes by government / military forces and beaten on the street.

972,"*commencing 9/11 controlled demolition anti-conspiracy rant*

Controlled Demolition theory falls down when you consider risk versus reward for the plotters:

* no point placing bombs in the towers if they're gonna fly planes into them. The exploding planes alone accomplish the goal of a terrorist attack (death, terror, spectacle) even if the towers dont fall
* Highly risky for any plotters as failure of the hijackers to hit targets dead-on would invariably lead to inspection of surviving buildings and discovery of explosives

Additionally:

* demolishing buildings of that size requires huge, unconcealable preparations
* Less bulky explosives (ie thermite) are demonstrably incapable of severing the main steel beams of the towers

Long story short the Controlled Demolition Theory is bunk.

On the Australian panel program 'Q and A', disabled minimum-wage earner Duncan Storrar said 'rich people don't even notice' a small tax break but to minimum-wage earners it can make a large difference to quality of life. The response of panel member Kelly O'Dwyer, who is the Assistant Treasurer and Finance Minister of Australia's governing centre-right Liberal/National Party, was seen as extremely vague.  Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Wilcox was seen as elitist when he argued that minimum wage earners already pay minimal tax (while wearing a highly visible bright gold-weave tie, Mr Storrar was wearing a casual hoodie).

Mr Storrar countered that he 'pays tax whenever I go to the shops, I pay tax whenever I fill up my car' and that raising the tax-free threshold could mean he could tell his daughters 'Daddy's not broke this weekend, we can go to the pictures'.

""I was attending a friend's bachelor party, which was turning out be quite a lively affair. A wide variety of alcoholic beverages, female entertainers and drunken revelry ensued, including patrons throwing wine casks at each other. Truly a fun night.

One of the attendees was an older gentleman, perhaps in his late thirties, while the other partygoers were in their early twenties. This struck most of us as a little odd but the fun continued anyways. This older gentleman is drinking cans of beer and rum/cola mixes faster than anyone else and quickly becomes inebriated. 

Unfortunately I'm rather tall which causes the older man to identify me as the prime target for physical confrontation. At several times during the course of the night he challenges me to a fight, even going so far as to throw wine casks at me and even attempting to choke me into unconsciousness. Due to my superior size I am easily able to push him away.

Toward the end of the night I see the older gentleman unconscious on a mattress in front of an oil barrel filled with burning logs. His sandals are lying discarded near his feet. 
Gleefully taking advantage of this opportunity for revenge on his many slights against me over the course of the night, I quickly scoop them up and drop them into the fire. That'll show him, I think with no small measure of satisfaction.

My desire to boast of my petty revenge is too great, however, and I confide in one of my friends as I leave the party.

""John, my good man,"" I say to my friend John. 

""Yes?""

""Do you remember the older gentleman who continually harassed me during the party?""

""Yes?""

""I threw his sandals into the fire!""

""Hah! Well done!""

""Yes, indeed!""

1099,"I don't know a whole lot but I did grow up with an equally-sized brother and we engaged in hand-to-hand combat daily. 

Having said that:

If he's on the ground and you're standing up, hes immobile. Unless he's Conor McGregor it's unlikely he'll be getting to his feet without you permitting it. 

If you want to be absolutely sure he won't get up you can jump down there with him and go for a rear naked choke, which I find is the best option for stopping someone doing anything. 

Striking to the head is always a bad idea unless you're out of other options. Bone versus bone equals broken bone. His skull is one big solid bone and your fist is lots of little fragile bones. Do the math. 

If you really, really gotta hit this guy, go for the body. It's less expected (everyone is always expecting the haymaker to the jaw, like the movies) and if you get him in the stomach or under the lungs he'll make an embarrassing whimpering noise and go down like an empty sack. Much lower risk of permanent damage (think Houndini's death) and acheives the same effect. I know this not because I've done it but because it's been done to me. I got my brother in the ear with a right hook one time and really pissed him off, he went straight for my gut and I went straight down and stayed down. Boy did I feel like a little bitch. That's the effect you want.

Do not, unless absolutely necessary, start putting the boot into the guy while he's on the ground. Dog act, plus a really decent chance of doing permanent damage. Assault charges, grievous bodily harm, you get the idea. Counter-productive. Getting down there with the chokehold is a much better option in my opinion but it also puts you down on the ground with him, and if he's got friends they are going to stomp on your head. That nearly happened to me one time too

1131,"IMO if it was required reading it would shut down a lot of the race debate within a generation. 

I'm Australian, and our education on race in early school was basically presented thus:

""Aboriginals lived peacefully in Australia until Europeans turned up and slaughtered them with advanced weapons. This was bad.""

There's no explanation as to WHY Europeans had guns and Aboriginals didn't. This is the key point of contention that can be brought up again and again when someone argues ""all people are equal, all races are equally smart and capable"", someone arguing against that can simply ask why Europeans were the race that ended up with the advanced technology that enabled them to conquer the world (as you did). 

That answer isn't provided anywhere in the high-school version of racial equality theory. The only conclusion someone can make when they try to apply that concept to the real world (where whites had advanced technology and blacks didn't) is that it's false - white people really are just smarter and black people really are dumber. 

This is the underlying principle of bascially all white supremacist theory - if we're all the same, why were white people the ones with the guns when everyone else had spears?

Guns Germs and Steel is the answer to that. The TL:DR version is ""Europe had the best conditions and species for farming"". Farming gives you bigger food surpluses and a sedentary (non-nomadic) lifestyle, which in turn enables division of labour away from food production and toward technological development. 

Many other socieites (from the Sumerians through to the Incas) also figured out farming on their own and developed advanced technology independently (for example the Chinese had compasses and gunpowder while Europeans were still throwing spears at each other) but the lack of key factors (the right domesticatable species, the right trade link that enabled mixed technologies, the right geography) prevented them from developing at the same rate.

Europe was like the Goldilocks region of human development. Everything was 'just right' - the summers are warm and bright (so you can farm) but the winters are cold (so you have to learn how to build complex houses). There are many easily farmable species (wheat, yams, hops, goats, sheep, etc) and lots of effective trade links to the Middle East, Asia, Africa and elsewhere which enabled Europeans to add technology from those places to their own, such as horses from the Middle East. 

Everyone really ought to read this book. It would dispel the argument from the SJW crowd that whites somehow cheated their way into power at the expense of other races (partially true, colonial slavery enabled massive economic growth in European soceities and America before the Industrial Revolution) but also destroys the notion from the Stormfront mob that whites are inherently superior to other races and their vast empires are evidence of this (they aren't, they just lucked out on a starting location). 

Good book but a bit of a doorstopper, like 800 pages or more. You can get to the main points listed above within the first fifth of the book however, the rest is mainly step-by-step explanations ",2016-04-28 03:38:45+00:00,d2k9rfj,6.0,t1_d2k59qm,6980.0,changemyview

1149,"&gt;Japan had no plan to invade Australia

I keep seeing this tossed around casually like it proves our military forces are irrelevant. 

90 years later we can say confidently that Japan had no plans to invade Australia but during the actual war it sure as shit looked like they were on their way. Not a lot of other reasons to try and fight their way through the mountains of Papua New Guinea. 

So what happens when someone else decides they could do a better job of running this underpopulated and resource-rich landmass than we currently are? 

Do we just assume 'oh they're trade partners so they won't do anything'? Russia and Ukraine were major trading partners. So were Germany and Poland. 
Do we assume the Americans will swoop in to the rescue? The ANZUS treaty isn't actually binding, just an understanding.

We need the capacity to defend oursevelves.

1183,"Bourne Ultimatum was good but didn't thrill me the way Shooter did (no helicopters were shot down and there was no equivalent of Kate Mara in a white tank top).

Michael Clayton and the American had basically no action and are straight conspiracy thrillers.

Every Mission Impossible since 3 has gone further and further into lighthearted camp territory, thus diminishing their qualities as effective conspiracy-action thrillers (although increasing their value as fun family/date movies and thus opening weekend take).

Departed leans back toward straight conspiracy. Lots of unexpected executions and a decent shootout at the end, but not an action film.

Jack Reacher? Eeeeeeeeeugh. Like, I get it. Tom Cruise liked the character, the studio liked how famous Tom Cruise already is, and Lee Child liked how much money the studio gave him. Everyone's happy, except fans of the Jack Reacher books. Like, it wasn't BAD but it wasn't great either.

Want to see what a Jack Reacher movie should have looked like? 
Watch Sicario (which now that I think of it is the current reigning conspiracy-action champion). Swap the positions of Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin's characters, downplay Benico Del Toro's character and you've got a Jack Reacher movie right there. Everything fits. The bleak, cerebral landscapes, the tight, clipped dialogue, the intense, white-knuckle violence, etc etc.

1212,"This is actually a conclusion that people involved with Reef sustainability are trying to point people away from. 

Yes, the bleaching is a problem, and yes, the Reef is facing severe health impacts, but a lot is being done to help it become more resilient and recover faster. 

It's also important to remember that there are different levels of bleaching, kind of like the difference between first, second and third-degree burns.  Level 1 and 2 bleaching (which is the majority of the bleaching in the current mass bleaching event) is usually not permanent and coral stands a good chance of making a full recovery, provided conditions like temperature and water quality return to normal (and the heatwave has finished, water temperature is dropping again). 

Level 3 bleaching (the common image of bright white coral) is severe but coral can still recover. At the key tourism dive sites off Cairns and Townsville there is less than 5 per cent Level 3 bleaching, but it gets worse the further north you go. 

Mortality (coral dying) is the fourth level of bleaching and so far we have seen single-figure averages for coral mortality across the affected areas, most under 5 per cent. 

So yeah, it's a bad mass bleaching event, but we've had bad mass bleaching events before.

If climate change continues to worsen (which it probably will) and if water quality gets worse (it might not, there's a lot of good remediation programs going on at the moment) we'll see big bleaching events like this happening on a regular basis, and we will probably lose species of coral. 

HOWEVER it's important to remember that the GBR is composed of many thousands of species of coral and a lot of them have higher tolerances to heat and bleaching. There are also species of zooxanthellae that are more resistant to high temperatures. Selection pressure through future bleaching will start to promote these species and we'll see them taking up more of the real estate on the Reef, which will be adapting over time to bleaching conditions. That's kind of what life does. 

It's a question of if it can adapt fast enough, and if we can slow down the change of conditions sufficiently",2016-04-13 05:30:09+00:00,d20tybl,2.0,t1_d20n41y,12900.0,australia

You get that there are people out there trying to stop us looking after the Reef, right? They do that by making us look like foaming-at-the-mouth anti-development greenies with no relevance to the average working Australian (whose support is the one we need because they decide governments). Guys like Andrew Bolt. Smart, highly-motivated demagouges. They are specialized at finding the inconsistencies in the argument and tossing it on the ground. Look a the views on Bolt's column posts about the Reef.

I know all this, because I do this for a living (oppose guys like Bolt). 

We need calm, rational discussion. We need to prove that we're correct and prove to everyone else that the other guys are incorrect. 

So the idea that we simply downvote-salvo anyone who steps outside the 'libs&gt;coal&gt;climate change&gt;destruction of the reef' narrative is ultimately counterproductive. /r/aus subscribers hit the blue arrow by the first full stop if the lead sentence doesn't agree with this narrative.

1252,"You are correct, and it'd be great to see that happen on a large scale. 

However I do think you are leaving out some factors. 

Germany can innovate with renewables because it's already one of, if not the most, industrialised and developed country on Earth, and has been since the start of the industrial revolution (world and cold wars notwithstanding). 

All the necessary infrastructure is in place.

Now it would be awesome to see the price of solar and wind and tide energy come down to reachable levels but they still have to plug into a grid. In Germany that's easy because the grid is hundreds of years old and the population is relatively stable, if not shrinking. In Kenya or Cambodia or Brazil the population is exploding and the grid is both highly unreliable or insufficient. 

Wind and solar are great but they also are 100 per cent reliant on environmental conditions - the sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always blow. But coal and oil can always be counted upon to burn when needed.

Plus, the guys in charge of development in China and everywhere else that's developing have been looking at Western approaches to industrialisation and development. That mainly means coal power. 

This isn't to say they won't build wind and solar. They're going to build wind and solar, which will keep pushing the price down, and thats super awesome. 

But they will keep building coal and oil plants as well, faster every day. They will build anything and everything necessary to get to where the West is. 

I think this is the part left out of the climate change debate, particularly on Reddit, which is natural because Reddit is the young poor and smart being angry at the old rich and dumb.

On top of that, temperature alone doesn't cause bleaching. Water quality and other impacts factor into it. How do you determine who's responsible for the water quality impacts? The dredgers? Tour operators? Farmers? How do you separate their impacts from natural impacts like flood events, and then how do you develop a fair system to make sure polluters pay and non-polluters aren't punished?

This is not to say don't worry about the Reef. Definitely worry about the Reef. There's a lot of cumulative pressures - not just the obvious stuff like climate change and coal dredging but also pollution and nutrient run-off from the coast. 

Because all these pressures link and feed into one another, its difficult for scientists to say 'X causes Y and A causes B', because the industries behind X and A can argue that they are less culpable and call the data into question. 

It's easy to see the net outcome on Reef Health but the question is how to go after the polluters. 

The Reddit response will of course involve the keywords ""Coalition"" ""coal"" ""corruption"" ""greed"" etc but remember that these are established industries - farming, mining, fishing, etc - , people work in them, they have families, and they have plenty of horror stories of heavy environmental regulation strangling operators into bankruptcy. It's worse when individual operators or companies have tried to reduce their own impacts but get shut down anyway because of a knee-jerk reaction from the government. Prawn farmers in the Burdekin catchment were particularly hard hit by this.

*Too bad, the Reef is sacred* is the usual Reddit reply, but then again for most of us, environmental regulations don't determine whether or not we can pay back loans or make rent, which affects the thinking.

It was on a small largely deserted island just off the coast of Queensland, Australia.  My family and I live on the coast near the island and often go there for fishing or camping trips.
The island has two large rocky hills on it, one of which terminates abruptly in a sheer 20-metre tall cliff face, with a pile of broken boulders exposed at its base at low tide. 

I, being 14 and thinking I was just The Most Awesome Guy That Ever Awesomed, attempted to freeclimb the cliff. I'd done it successfully not a month earlier, thus reinforcing my Awesomest thinking. Easy, I think. So I head off. My older brother calls to me ""Don't you try to climb that cliff again, you'll bloody kill yaself"". 

*Says the Non-Awesome Older Brother Who Has Never Awesomed At Any Point In His Life Of Non-Awesomeness*, I think, and start climbing the cliff.

About ten metres up I reach for an outcrop and fail to test it properly before shifting my weight onto it. The handhold turns out to be a separate rock, which pops cleanly out of the cliff face. 
The fall is somehow very fast and very slow at the same time. 

I have a lot of dreams about falling and suddenly gaining the ability of flight before I hit bottom. It's a pyschological thing about despair and hope, you can look it up. 

*Maybe this is one of those dreams* I think on the way down. 

Nope. Immediate, gravity-driven reality, plummeting me toward a pile of jagged rocks.

I only survive because I've managed to twist in mid-air and get my feet underneath me, like an extremely overconfident 14-year-old-human version of a cat. That, and the one rock I land on is of the flat, wide and non-jagged variety. 

Had I landed a metre in any other direction, I would have been ripped into bloody shreds. As it happens I hit the flat rock feet-first. The bones of my heels fracture and my little toe is partially severed, hanging by the tendon.

After realizing no, I'm not actually dead and yes, I did just fall off a ten-metre high cliff onto jagged rocks and am in severe pain, crawl over the rocks to yell back to where my brother and cousin are fishing. No more Awesomest attitude from me. 

My brother and cousin sprint over yelling ""what happened?""

I can only choke out ""I fell!""

1308,"I actually looked into this for an assignment at university and my argument was that the human development of language - effective language - depended on the mutation of a new gene called [FOX-P2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP2). 

This gene, which isn't present in Neanderthals but is present in humans, is what enabled us to encode syntax in our language. Syntax allows us to add and understand extra layers of meaning in our vocalisations, which in turn enables us to spread detailed information effectively and (most critically) enable us to build tools out *of more than one type of material*.

Take this example: Chimpanzees have a word for 'snake'. An actual word. It's a specific noise that they make whenever they see a snake. When other chimps hear 'snake' in chimp language, they jump into the trees to get away from a snake they have never seen. It's a handy skill. They have words for a lot of different creatures (they use the word for 'baboon' to describe humans). 

However, while a chimp can say 'I see a snake!', he cant say 'Yesterday I saw a snake hanging around that log over there', which requires syntax coding (information (snake) plus context (time and location)).

Likewise chimps (and Neanderthals) can make tools - previously thought to be a human-only skill - by modifying existing materials (breaking and chewing sticks to make them sharp to retrieve grubs, cracking nuts with rocks, bending branches and ferns to  make roofs). 

However only humans could make tools by combining materials (tying rocks to sticks to make axes and spears) and importantly they could spread that knowledge to other humans accurately and quickly in a way that Neanderthals couldnt",2016-03-11 03:12:07+00:00,d0vjrj3,8.0,t1_d0vgfat,7386.0,todayilearned

1357,"I came up with a decent open-ended-ish Game of of Thrones strategy game. Sort of a group-based RPG (like Final Fantasy) mixed with a Total War-style strategy game. 

So you would control a single character with their own skillset and recruit followers from the game environment who would also have their own skillset. 

Skills would basically be broken down into either Combat or Intriuge categories and be further broken down into subcategories. For example Combat skills would include physical direct combat abilities like Swordplay (with Westerosi, Braavosi and Dothraki variants), Archery, Agility, Stamina, etc, but also Commander skills  that affect their abilities during the RTS phase of gameplay.  Intrigue skills on the other hand would include things that would affect the diplomacy and recruitment phase of gameplay, like Convince, Seduce, etc.

There would be either open-ended gameplay with the aim of conquering as much of Westeros as possible and taking the Iron Throne, or specific story objectives (like reclaiming an ancestral homeland or revenge-killing a certain character). 

The meta challenge would be balancing the player's skills with the allies picked up through recruitment. For example Daenerys has Missandei in her retinue, who has the Translation intrigue skill, which comes in handy for diplomacy, but she also has Daario Naaharis, who has high Dothraki swordsmanship skills. 
Players would gain and lose followers through their journey (some would die, others would leave/be recruited by other characters) like when Daenerys lost Jorah (and his high Westerosi Swordsmanship skill and Heavy Armour equipment along with him).

The Clash of Kings mod for Mount and Blade would be a low-res preview for this. That, with the ASOIAF Crusader Kings mod for the RTS/diplomacy segements. ",2016-02-25 00:39:48+00:00,d0co4tr,2.0,t1_d0cej6i,13544.0,todayilearned

They'd much rather be able to focus on hardcore things like ice.

They rate a drug on two factors - what it makes you do, and what you're willing to do to get it. 
Alcohol can be troublesome based on what it makes you do (risk-taking behaviour, aggression) and also what people are willing to do to get it (usually breaking into bottle-os in Indigenous majority communities). 

Weed greatly decreases risk-taking behaviour and it's unusual for people to commit break-ins to get their hands on it, or money for it. Welfare is normally more than enough. 

Ice on the other hand is a big problem on both counts. The unpredictabilty of someone on ice, combined with its hyper-addtictiveness, make it their main drug of concern.

So much of their time and paperwork, however, is to do with minor possession or trafficking charges for weed. 

However, a lot of dealers traffick both atm so finding the potheads usually leads them to the bloke selling ice. 

However it's highly unlikely that the police services are going to start publicly supporting decriminalisation unless the political climate changes drastically. They will likely be the last calling for decriminalisation, not the first.",2016-02-10 10:25:34+00:00,czum45r,3.0,t1_czui62j,14024.0,australia

1413,"I know everyone is saying recon but what is important is EXCEPTIONAL recon. It's worth the price tag. 

I used to ragequit because by ASLAV-25s would even be able to spot the ATGM that killed them, which makes them seem kind of pointless for a recon vehicle.

I never really understood the difference between the Recon value levels (they all seemed to die equally quickly to hidden ATGMs regardless) but I got on top of it after reading a few threads. 

Basically 'Good' recon will reveal an enemy in the woods after they fire at you, ""Very Good"" recon will reveal an enemy in the woods before they fire at you and 'Exceptional' recon might sometimes allow you to see the enemy in the woods even before they see you, thus completely negating their ambush (unless they, too, have high-end recon in the woods with them). 

This is why Exceptional Recon is so expensive, because it is so valuable. 

So now for forest fighting I bring in the LRPV recon jeep, which goes for 50 points (fwaaaaar) but also comes with a Mark 19 grenade launcher, which matches range with infantry RPGs but critically aims and fires MUCH faster and can rapidly stun-lock an entire infantry squad, so I can send it into the forest with my Diggers or Commandos and it will actually kill Spetznas and Li-Jian squads. Autocannons have the same effect, but neither the grenade launcher nor the autocannon are going to get that quick first shot off unless they can see their targets through the trees before the enemy units see them.

There is a quote in the SandyGunFox guide from the US Anti-Tank School - ""If you can see it, you can hit it. If you can hit it, you can kill it.""

1430,"I'm gonna go on a maaaaaaaaybe borderline racist kinda thing here but bear with me. 

Socialism was designed by sedate political scientists to gradually and peacefully replace the capitalist governments of medium-sized industrialised European countries (Germany, France, etc). Instead, it was implemented by hot-blooded youths in undeveloped, basically feudal Asian and Latin American countries via violent peasant revolutions. 

The cultures aren't compatible. There was never the cultural focus on discussion, negotiation, compromise that was assumed in Marx and Engles's vision of socialism. Neither was there the necessary wealth, education or infrastructure (I hate to call it 'civilised culture' but that's kinda what it was) already put in place by a century or two of capitalism first. 

So the 'socialist' aspects (share stuff, help each other, don't be greedy) of places like Venezulea are far, far eclipsed by the  'revolutionary' aspects (if someone is wealthy it's kinda okay to shoot them in the face). 

Give it 40 or 50 years of trying to build a functional socialist state from a mostly agrarian peasant base (like Russia, China) and you get fuck loads of dead people and corruption. But not much real socialism.",2016-02-03 11:53:42+00:00,czm5j7j,2.0,t1_czm48md,5208.0,worldnews

1460,"Capitalism IS opportunism, my friend. It's the very essence of it. 

So let *me* get this straight:

* I'm not owed the development of a videogame (not arguing that, which is why I want to pay people to help me develop it)
* You're not owed an iPhone if you walk into the store with $5 (also makes perfect sense, unless the store is a fake version in mainland China)
* If Apple only sells iPhones for $5 they and the manufacturers (who are, coincidentally, also in mainland China) go out of business. This also makes perfect sense and is the basis of my response:

I have a limited amount of money to spend on the game. I'm not a rich dude, not by a long shot. If I spend too much on the icon artwork I have no money left over for coding, testing, distribution, etc, all of which I need to make the game. So I came to this sub to find someone willing to do the job I needed done, quickly and cheaply. I figured an arena of freelancers would be highly competitive and I would receive the best value (game production) for my (highly limited) money - which I have, you know, successfully done, because I've already hired one of the people that applied after seeing my post. 

So I am, as you advise, PAYING for the development of my videogame. 

However you're coming to me not with a value for money proposition but with an emotional argument. I'm not sure how many jobs you've gotten using this technique in the past but I'm willing to bet it's not huge.

You could have come out with an actual bid for something higher, negotiating and offering higher-quality product in exchange -  and if your work looked good enough I would have hired you for that higher rate and you would have been the one that ended up with the money in his hands, not the other guy.

What I suspect is that you don't believe your work is good enough to be worth more than what I'm offering (despite your 18 hours days and tens of thousands of hours of improving), so instead of fronting up a portfolio and knowing I'll probably knock it back, you take the easier path: complaining.

""Respect your fellow humans,"" you demand. 
I do, provided they earn that respect.  I'm offering them a chance to earn some money. All I ask is that they respect me in return by offering good work in exchange for that money. 
You want to be altruistic? Go right ahead, distribute your alms to the poor. But I have work I need done, altruism isn't going to do it for me.

A South Korean invasion of North Korea is a net loss. 

Let's play out the scenario:

Your South Korean leadership decides 'fuck it, let's deal with these commies once and for all' then starts rolling across the DMZ with US backup. 
NK shells Seoul and kills upwards of 50,000 people in a few hours. 
US and SK technological superiority devastates NK from the air before ground forces sweep across the DMZ and liberate all of North Korea. 

Now what?

South Korea owns the former North Korean territory, and that's way more trouble than it's worth. They now have to deal with millions of impoverished North Korean citizens that have been exposed to nothing but Juche indoctrination for their entire lives. How exactly are they meant to integrate into South Korea's ultra-high-end tech economy? What jobs are they going to work?
What happens is they immediately form a giant cadre of second-class citizens as they flee into South Korea as refugees, forming enclaves in Seoul and the other SK cities. 
Unemployment, crime, civil unrest - they all go through the roof. 
We're getting further into hypothetical future territory but it's not unreasonable to expect multinational corporations pulling out, currency devaluing, etc etc etc.

All bad news for South Korea.

Thats why the status quo has been maintained on the Korean peninsula for so long: nobody wants the Korean War to restart. Absolutely nobody except wargaming fans in the West who want to see modern US military equipment used against something other than RPG-wielding insurgents in the Middle East.

To me ASoIaF works as a giant allegory about climate change (retrospectively, considering GRRM started them before anyone was talking about the ozone layer). 

Think about it. A world filled with various human societies constantly preoccupied with war, greed and religious extremism, causing them to ignore the approaching weather-based apocalypse. 

Swap out Starks, Lannisters and the Lord of Light for America, China and ISIS and you've got a pretty close analogy. 

I guess the Night's Watch would be the global climate science community. They were put there to do a specific job (guard/warn against the dangers of said apocalytic weather event) and are ignored while also falling victim to pathological infighting. 

And it's just as likely to turn out the same in Planetos as it does in Earth. No-one will win the Game of Thrones because by the time someone kills everyone else the climate will have changed and everyone will die anyway.

Additionally - the weather event will last for longer than an average human lifetime.

The only real difference is on Earth the gradual warming will cause a breakdown of agricultural systems after the 2030s and 40s while on Planetos there's... you know... ice zombies.",2015-12-21 05:14:37+00:00,cy6ap83,4.0,t1_cy69er0,2681.0,gameofthrones

~~ACTUAL~~ SEVERE problems.

The analogy is whingeing about a stubbed toe when the bloke next to you has his leg cut off. Yes, your toe hurts. The fact the bloke's ragged stump is gushing arterial blood onto the pavement next to you makes complaining about your stubbed toe ludicrously inappropriate and grounds for being instructed to shut the fuck up

Bikies here get into gang fights and sell ice. That's a problem. 

Indonesian-backed forces reportedly carry out mass rape and torture of highland communities on the PNG side of the border. Thats a SEVERE problem. 

We have occasional power outages in Australia, especially during cyclones. That's a problem, but we can be confident of the power coming back on at some point. 70 per cent of Western Province has no fixed power supply, at all. That's a SEVERE problem.

Cost of living here is high. That's a problem. However wages are also high and there's a wide range of welfare assistance available. 
The Treaty Villages on the south coast are still waiting for disaster relief funds to buy such luxuries as rice, flour and clean water, three months after they were promised. That's a SEVERE problem. 

Big corporations pay less tax than some people approve of here in Australia. That's a problem. In PNG big corporations dump mine tailings into major river systems and destroy entire societies. That's a SEVERE problem.

1724,"&gt;with basic income people will be able to become entreprenurial or creative in the arts or science

this argument assumes altruistic, selfless motivations and a vast well of untapped scientific/creative genus for the majority (if not all) of the population. As with other social strategies on this end of the progressive spectrum (socialism, communism) it willingly overlooks the unfavourable, antisocial aspects of human personalities (greed, stupidity, corruption, laziness, nepotism) as a core part of its theoretical structure. 

It doesn't really address disincentives to work, capital flight, social opposition, disincentives to innovation and competitiveness, drug and alcohol abuse, etc.

The idea that there's millions of Da Vincis out there that could blossom overnight if they were released from the shackles of this troublesome need to work for a living is a fantasy. What's going to happen instead is an entire generation that's going to grow up knowing there's little reason to try very hard at anything because their needs will be taken care of whatever they do. 

Innovation mainly comes from necessity (it is too difficult to do X, so I will invent Y to make X easier) or profit motive (I could make fuckloads of money off X if I can market it properly). 

It rarely comes from altruism (everyone's lives will be improved if I invent X). 

In a basic income economy, necessity and profit motive - the primary innovation drivers - are negated, and only altruism remains. While humans have great capacity for altruism, it usually only becomes evident in times of great need - natural disasters, etc. In times of safety and plenty, human personalities mainly revert focus back to competition as their instinct to create and dominate heirarchies kicks back in. 

TL:DR basic income is a bad idea because it assumes humans are inherently good and want to cooperate for the greater good, when in reality they are not inherently good and only cooperate for short-term gain",2015-10-27 02:11:44+00:00,cwe4wuo,2.0,t1_cwe2wfv,3174.0,australia
1725,"Because that someone is meant to be out working a job, producing a product or service, and contributing to the growth of the economy, thus providing some of that $30k to someone else. 

Creating an entire class of people that are nothing but consumers would cause huge problems, both for the economy and society. 

Consumers are also producers, that is the basic idea of human society. If you're not producing something you are living for free off someone else's labour so why the fuck do we let you keep living in the village? 

So this guy that wants to stay at home playing videogames isn't actually covering his food and rent with that 30k a year. WE - the other working taxpayers and companies - are covering his food and rent for 30k a year. 
The videogames he buys are being paid for in part by the videogame companies themselves, and by everyone else. No new wealth is being created by this guy. Money is simply being recycled through him (and taken out of the system as he buys weed from Daz down the street, who takes it to Bali and spends it on ladyboy dancers). 
Thus the incentive to innovate and produce is vastly reduced. Paying for your own products to be consumed is a net loss, in the end.

Why not go somewhere else where there's money to be made?",2015-10-27 01:55:38+00:00,cwe4b2l,2.0,t1_cv4nlsz,3413410.0,circlejerkaustralia

1727,"I saw the problems with basic income theory summed up best in another thread which I have been completely unable to re-locate. It went something like this:

""I think the underlying problem with basic income theory is that it was developed by well-meaning affluent academics that have little real-world experience with poverty or welfare. Free money (welfare etc) doesn't always get recycled into the economy through work and expenditure. A lot of it gets hoarded by those at the top of a poverty-line food pyramid (drug dealers, loan sharks, etc). Additionally if you think people can't live on $30k a year without working extra, think again. Basic income, like communism, willingly ignores the unpleasant parts of human personalities (laziness, greed, corruption, stupidity) as part of its core structure. When exposed to actual human systems it will be immediately exploited, break down and have to be replaced.""

Not that I'm a fan of Ayn Rand, but 'each according to his needs' results in a net loss for the system because it eventually requires make-work, sinecures, hyperinflation and results in corruption and massive inefficiency. For examples see the Soviet Union and pre-Xiaoping Communist China.

That's the best thing about capitalism - despite the prevalence of Rich Old White Men In Expensive Suits - is that it actually has an answer for what happens to people that don't want to subscribe to the capitalist value system of hard work and innovation. That answer is poverty and starvation. As we've seen that's plenty of motivation to get away from.

Lucas didn't make Phantom Menace for the 35-year-olds who saw the originals as pimply teenagers. He made it for their kids. Hence Jar Jar and kid Anakin.

The whole movie was designed to attract a new generation of fans, not pander to the old generation of fans. And it was smart, too.

Plus we could see the deployment of strategic-level equipment like heavy bombers, submarines, recon satellites, etc. 

Nukes would be an issue but they could handwave that as the effects of the  MAD concept. 

Battles were run a weird way in RD - 20 minutes of realtime combat then stop and pick it all up again next turn (representing 12 or 6 hours later). 

No time limit would be better. Plus, units that you had in neighbouring strategic sectors could be brought in (provided there was no combat in that neighbouring sector) on a time delay (like 10 or 15 minutes) and they could only deploy from the deployment zones that linked to their strategic sectors. 

So if you engaged that scout force when there's a tank battalion one sector away, you know they might be turning up halfway through the battle. 

Might have to tweak the deployment system just a little. Instead of a single deployment zone having a fixed 'deployment point' (which invariably acts as a chokepoint and gets ambushed in gameplay) instead you could have units spawn on a wide front of the map edge (provided the terrain was compatible).

For a faction so focused on infantry and air to only have access to medium-cost basic dogfighters (the Phantoms and the Mirages) is baffling. 

An ASF hornet, even one priced over 150 points, would settle a lot of my gripes about the way Eugene has presented ANZAC.

1807,"If you like Commonwealth hit-and-run you could probably put together an ANZAC moto deck, which has great infantry (Diggers, Commandos) and a metric fuckton of 150kph amphib transports (ASLAV-PC, Stolly) to put them in. Plus they get the Vickers and ASLAV-TOW for that sweet AT goodness. They are lacking in anti-air but if you chuck enough RBS-70 manpads in amongst the other infantry, you should be ok.

I don't really see it as 'hit and run' - nothing can fight effectively in withdrawal (except expensive tanks) and ceding any territory eventually results in income disparity in the enemy's favour. 

Using moto is basically a contest between yourself and the REDFOR airborne heli rusher to get to the middle town first. Whoever wins that initial race gets the town for the first chunk of the game (until someone napalms the living fuck out of it, that is) So its more 'race and hold' as opposed to 'hit and run'.


150kph land vehicles get to mid of almost any map at pretty much the same time as a heli rush. If you pop even one or two smoke rounds slightly ahead of them (say on the far side of the town your are assaulting) you can charge into town and instantly shit out enough specialized infantry to make life seriously unenjoyable for someone trying to take the town off you. 

You have to do it right, tho. If you don't smoke the far side proper the Hinds can get sight on your column as you're approaching the town and they'll fuck you up. Rockets, ATGMS, autocannons versus thin-skinned transports. All bad times.

One counter is to chuck a couple of ASLAV-25s (available in both VHC and REC flavours at a steal at 25 points each) and have them push through the town on Move Fast while your infantry deploy into the urban sectors behinds them. 

They will emerge from the town at 150kph, autocannons blazing, into a field of slowly landing REDFOR choppers. They will of course die heroically but not before killing / stunning several times their value of transport choppers or high-end gunships. 

After taking to town be sure to send a steady stream of supply trucks, or you'll run out of ATGMs and MANPAD darts pretty quick. What I do is spawn a four-truck squad of 15pt Unimog Cargo and queue a large number of runs between the town and your FOB. Hold shift, Move Fast click on one of your ATGM or MANPAD squads, Move Fast click on your FOB, Move Fast Click another squad, repeat until you've clicked each squad. Better yet, divide up the four-truck squad and do each inf squad individually. It's a heavy investment of micro so do it in a lull, but it will save you a lot of points buying new supply trucks in the long run.

Ask about what they do, and how they do it well. 

Everyone **does** something - they have a job, they have hobbies, etc. The key to having more than a two-sentence conversation about what someone does is to ask them **how they do it well.**

So, if they're an accountant, whats the trick to being a good accountant? If they play hockey, whats their strategy out on the field?

The purpose to this is two-fold - one, it creates more things to say and extends out the conversation organically, and two - that person will get more confident and interested in the conversation because they have a chance to talk about something that they are interested in. They will also **proud** of their ability to do whatever it is they do well. You don't have to be particularly interested in what they're saying or even understand the finer points but if you can get someone talking about what they like, they will automatically feel better toward you.

The only real risk is your conversation partner becoming self-conscious and closing themselves down saying 'I dont want to brag' or 'I must be boring you'.

The only thing they're lacking is a Deathstar recon chopper like the Akula or the Apache Longbow (or recon tanks but seriously who uses those)",2015-09-22 05:54:25+00:00,cv9xhte,1.0,t3_3lwh8a,2400.0,wargame

1881,"Re-bind 'move fast' to a more accessible key (I use 'Q'). Be careful because the unit will use roads wherever possible and will sometimes drives straight into enemy fire.

Always use 'attack move' when ever you think there's a chance your units will encounter enemy forces, this will make them stop to fire (greatly improving accuracy) whenever an enemy unit gets in range.

Don't deploy forces (place their order ghosts) straight onto the front lines. Deployed forces fast move to their deployment zone and ignore everything on the way. You will forget about them (they'll take a long time to get there from spawn) and they will drive straight into enemy fire and die. 

Use 'fire position' (default T) when ordering bombers to attack. Don't click on the enemy unit directly. Jets can't see ground units on their own so more often than not you will lose sight of the target, causing the jet to break off the attack and either circle uselessly before running out of fuel and evac-bingoing, or simply fly over the top of the target like a dickhead and get shot down. 

Learn order queuing. It will make infantry effective (ie they will deploy from vehicles when they reach their destination and not just sit there waiting to be murdered). 

Deploy tanks in groups of 2 at the very max. Only deploy line infantry in groups of 4, to maximise firepower per urban sector. Everything else should be in 1s or 2s to minimise the effects of morale damage

We have it backward. The media doesn't control the populace, the populace controls the media. Producing a newspaper is expensive. Journo salaries, printing costs, distribution costs. If you're printing something that's driving away readers and therefore sales and advertising, you gotta stop.

So most editors gauge the most populist angle possible and go with that.

Abbott is the leader of the Liberal Party (which is the more powerful half of the Liberal National Party).

Communications minister and deputy leader (and previous party leader until he was usurped by Abbott) Malcolm Turnbull has been growing in popularity pretty much since Abbott was elected. 

After an aborted attempt earlier in the year, Turnbull has now challenged Abbott for the leadership. 

Now the Liberal Party of Australia will decide who is their leader, and as they are the currently elected government party of Australia, this will also determine the Prime Minister of Australia.

Ironically the Liberal Party won government after their opponents, the Labor Party, went through several leadership changes while in power. Much of their current platform is based around opposing this kind of behaviour.

1986,"I debated about this in another thread on /r/combatfootage where someone quoted Eisenhower on the waste of resources and ingenuity on developing weapons as opposed to social infrastructure (hopsitals schools etc).

While I'm as much of a bleeding-heart pinko as the next Redditor I did have to point out that building schools and hospitals is all well and good but if your neighbour decides to build tanks and fighter jets instead, then invades and takes over your country (schools and hospitals included) then that effort is just as wasted. 

These narratives about the waste of military expenditure have formed in a post Cold-War environment of unquestioned American military supremacy, where the US outspends Russia and China combined on weapons, where our primary enemies are now mostly impoverished fanatics fighting asymmetric wars. In that environment, spending billions on fancy and impressive weapon systems does seem immature and a waste of resources that could go elsewhere.

However before 1990 (my birth year and I'd wager close to the birth year of many of us here on Reddit) there actually was a real and very present need for these things, because there was another huge super-powerful army just over the hill also spending billions on developing fancy, impressive weapons. And it wasn't a dick-measuring contest, it was a deadly serious competition with *dominion of the entire world* as its prize. 

And the USSR lost. Look what happened to them. Two decades of chaos, economic collapse, corruption, civil conflict and degradation, from which they are still recovering. 

Look what the US won after the Fall of the Soviet Union - nearly a decade of peace and unchallenged supremacy, economic growth and the spreading of its culture around the world. The peace thing (aside from Kosovo, Somalia, etc) came to an end in September 2001 and the economic growth thing came to an end in 2008 but hey, what can you do.

**TL:DR**
Wanting the money spent on weapons to be spent on advancing the human race is all well and good but the human race is divided into countries that often go to war with other. We complain about this but we live in the most powerful of those countries that has won the majority of those wars by spending all that money on weapons, allowing us to have safe and comfortable lives that in turn give us time to complain about the money spent on weapons.",2015-09-09 00:13:08+00:00,cuv1cfy,4.0,t1_cuueyxz,36150.0,wargame

Due to their Valyrian heritage providing them a genetic link with dragons, Targs's blood is fuel for Blood Magic. 

The Baratheon family (Stannis, Shireen and Gendry) included have Targareyan heritage, hence their DNA can be used to power Melisandre's magic. 

With this understanding, it shows why Melisandre has so much interest in Jon Snow, because under the RLJ theory he's got much more Targ DNA than any Baratheon. 

With access to him Melisandre could perform truly powerful blood magic spells, considering the varying potency of spells derived from Baratheon DNA, who only possess a small percentage of Targ blood. ",2015-09-07 05:12:29+00:00,cut6r4a,1.0,t3_3jx361,14726.0,gameofthrones

2006,"The Crown Of Thorns is native to the reef but human activity has altered the conditions they live in. 

Specifically the sugar cane farms on the coast result in a lot of dissolved inorganic nitrogen entering the water table and being washed out to the reef in flood plumes. 

The nitrogen artifically boosts the survival rate of the larval Crown Of Thorns, in turn causing the outbreaks.

2009,"COTSBot is a cool, attention-grabbing idea but it's unable to target starfish underneath coral, which is where most of them live. 

There's a range of different methods currently being discussed to help control Crown of Thorns numbers but the most practical and cost-efficient method is still direct culling by divers. 

Right now there is one (1) boat employing about 10-15 divers doing this, for the entire Great Barrier Reef. Surprisingly they are putting a serious dent in the numbers of the starfish at key tourism reefs. With a little more funding and some new technology (such as pheromone attractants and repellents) we could expand that program out to target the 'super spreader' reefs where the starfish spawn.

2034,"If ISIS was a mainly urban-based resistance movement composed only of the young men and women of fighting age you described, I would agree that any military action would be a mistake. Socially, sending the army of a first-world superpower against a civilian/paramilitary insurgency makes it look like big guy vs underdog and draws more recruits to the resistance, which is exactly what happened in Iraq and what has provided the majority of their fighters. So socially, that's mainly about belief systems, and you fight against that using belief systems. The Troubles in Ireland are an excellent example - the IRA did most of their work with car bombs and rifles, and they weren't defeated with tanks and planes, but through negotiations and discussions. 

However, ISIS is different. They aren't just boys running through city streets. They are an army - out in the desert, with their own tanks, heavy weaponry and even aircraft. They have ranks and sometimes even uniforms. They've got Iraqi, Iranian, Syrian, Jordanian etc ex-military personnel running the show. They've got highly experienced Chechen mercenaries, etc etc.

So using a belief-based system to counteract them will not work, because Wahabi Islam is not going away. We might be able to cut down the percentage of the young stupid Muslim guys reading their websites and joining up but we won't dissuade the mercenaries or top leadership. 

So before we can start trying to educate young Muslim men on peaceful and moderate interpretations of Islam, before we can start dropping aid packages and rebuilding schools and hospitals, we've got to destroy or at least heavily debilitate ISIS's military capacity. As in we have to blow up their tanks and APCs and artillery pieces and whatnot.

And we have to do that from the air, so that there's no Western soliders on the ground in the quagmire getting IED'd every day. 

This isn't an easy or simple solution and there's no guarantee it will work. But ISIS has no production capacity. They cannot manufacture more guns, tanks, planes, etc. They also have no permanent source of income aside from donations from various places in the Muslim world (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, etc). 
A strategy needs to be developed (if it hasnt already) to disrupt ISIS's finances. Right now they are paying the mercenaries and their professional soldiers with the proceeds of looting and ransoms. That money will not last for ever. Once it runs out they will lose their ability to pay the mercenaries, who won't risk getting smart-bombed for no pay. 

Then, we can start a de-escalation strategy. But we have to take out what infrastructure and heavy equipment they have now, while we can. Because they are using that heavy equipment to continue their campaign of terror and prevent any 'soft' strategy from being used",2015-08-28 02:55:33+00:00,cui8gnc,6.0,t1_cuh8cby,70581.0,australia

2037,"Good points, but there's no solution to ISIS other than a military one at the moment, and calling it a solution is a massive stretch. More like temporary mitigation. Right now the thing that is destroying infrastructure, social structure, creating refugee problems and more insurgents... is ISIS. 

They're not like the insurgent movement in Iraq. That was young guys running around wiring old Soviet artillery shells to explode next to US patrols. 

And there's no real 'soft' option for dealing with them (negotiation, aid, de-escalation), because ISIS is a 'hard' problem (they have lots of guns and bombs and tanks and shit) and they have consistently demonstrated that they're willing to target civilians. 

If we do nothing, they will continue to slaughter the innocent. If we do something, they will have less capacity to slaughter the innocent.

An actual solution to ISIS would have been to not invade Iraq in the first place in 2003 - a couple of million people all over the world were like 'hey this is a bad idea' but they weren't listened to.

So that leaves us with a military solution, here and now in 2016. 

Why are we backing the Americans? Same reason as since World War II - protection. We need them in case some shit goes down in our part of the world, like an Islamic revolution in in Indonesia, or if China decides to annex us in the 2020s or 2030s.

Pretty much anyone that's received an extensive education in Westeros is either of noble blood (and thus fairly invested in maintaining the status quo) or a Maester (who have no economic or military resources). 

So a democratic revolution (like the French Revolution) isn't likely, because of the different conditions between Medieval Europe and Westeros. Westeros is more like 1500s - 1600s Europe (and has been stuck that way for a few thousand years due to Planetos's erratic weather cycle).

What's more likely (and indeed what's happened) is a religious revolution (like the Iranian Islamic revolution). These are what happens when a large, uneducated yet religious population grows unsatisfied with the leadership classes. They're different from civil wars (ala Robert's Rebellion or the War of the Five Kings) because they are, essentially, a class struggle.

It would have the widest temporal scope of the Wargame series so far (1960s to 1990s) and would have to include the Six-Day War, the Yom Kippur War, the Iran-Iraq War and Gulf War I. 

These Middle East conflicts have been some of the only times a lot of the post-Korean War units in Wargame have actually seen combat.

Hypothetical campaigns could include large escalations of the Arab-Israeli conflicts in which NATO and the Soviet Union became involved, or perhaps an escalation of the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, again with overt US involvement. 

I think that's a prime candidate for another game in the Wargame series. Whether it gets made or not is up to Eugene. 

I think right now what would be on my wish list would be a map creator - as in, an actual map creator with the terrain and everything, not just something to edit command zones and spawn points. 

I live in a tropical part of Northern Australia, which on Google Earth looks remarkably like many of the maps in Red Dragon.

I've spoken to a few friends with young kids about this kind of thing. 

Their outlook is, basically, 'I don't give a fuck what you think'. 

Having kids is stressful. Really, really, really stressful, especially if you're young yourself and working at the same time. 
They don't just scream in public places, they scream all the time, everywhere, no matter what you do.

You get no sleep and eventually you become accustomed to the endless screaming so it doens't grate in your ears the way it does to others. 

It's hard to offload kids so you can just fuck off and have a good time. Babysitters are expensive, people arent always available. 

Eventually after a few years you get into the mindset that you're tired of missing out on things like going to the movies or out to dinner just because you have kids. This concept becomes more valuable to you then the disapproving looks and comments of strangers, none of whom you give a fuck about after six or seven years of endless kid screaming. 

They're only experiencing it for an hour or so out at dinner. You're dealing with it nonstop.

'How selfish,' they might say. 'Why don't they stay at home and let the rest of us enjoy our dinner/movie/whatever'.

'Go and fuck yourselves,' the parents would say back.

In their mind, it's not as if reproducing absolves them of the responsibility of common decency. They are simply past caring. Your snarky comments and dirty looks are nothing to them. Absolutely nothing. 

They're dealing with barely sentient shit-ejecting property-destroying screaming machines on a 24-7 basis. They couldn't care less about your enjoyment.",2015-07-13 23:36:51+00:00,ct2b2qz,3.0,t1_ct1l46x,45721.0,australia

As for the Boy That Cried Wolf - I'm taking us into semantics here but the end result of the fable was that there eventually WAS a fatal wolf attack, right? So, for the analogy to hold true, Australia (or more accurately, Tony Abbott personally) will suffer a major terrorist attack. 

Additionally, I'd argue again that it's appropriate to criticize Abbott for leveraging national security threats to increase government power and reduce individual freedoms. 

But he isn't manufacturing ISIS. They are real, they are targeting Westerners and others that don't align with their ideology. There's piles of bodies all over the world attesting to that fact now.

If we hate Abbott *that much* that we're willing to argue terrorism isn't actually that much of a big deal, then I think we need to take a serious breather and come back to this whole thing with a fresh perspective. 

Because, goddamn - this sub's frontpage is a nonstop cycle of online news stories from the SMH or ABC or even the occasional News Ltd outlet, and any mention of terrorism or Abbott seems to produce the same reaction from /r/australia commenters:

""Abbott's making it up to take away our freedoms so Murdoch and big coal can make more money"".

2318,"There's oodles academic theory out there about this but my take on it is thus -

We live in nations, right? Groups of people all working and living together. We do this because it allows a net increase in productivity and greater protection from external threats (we rally together against wolves or bandits or whatever)

Due to this we have the greatest interest in threats to productivity and new external threats.

The new external threat is terrorism. They are bad guys, out there, coming to kill us, Australia, as a people. That's a very simple message. Good vs evil. Very easy to teach to kids, very easy to communicate via media. 

Domestic violence is much more complex and less clear-cut. It's also [much more common, making for less media interest](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-08/davoren-maintaining-the-veil-of-silence-around-domestic-violence/6455060).

Is he compensating for his insecurities and need for control? Should we consider what happens under someone's else's roof their business? Is it condoned by our culture and history, etc etc etc. Basically talking about domestic violence makes us feel uneasy and guilty and turns us on each other. It doesn't unite populations, because the enemy IS the population. 

Now of course we SHOULD be talking about domestic violence but the truth is that people would rather talk about terrorism, because they are more scared of it and therefore more interested in it. It's human nature.",2015-06-29 03:50:09+00:00,csm2860,4.0,t1_csm1h8x,1621.0,australia

Without a common enemy, society unravels. Humans arent designed to live in large groups (we evolved as nomadic, tribal hunter-gatherers and yet we live in globalised cities of hundreds of millions). 

The whole reason we started living in groups was to combine food stores and present a tougher target for predators and raiders - not because we liked each other's company.

As soon as the bad guys go away, our loyalty reverts down from the national level back to the family level. There's no reason not to screw over your neighbour any more. 

This idea is one of the only bits of credence I give to false-flag 9/11 conspiracy theories. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Western society was left without a major external threat for ten years. 
In that time survivalist secessionsim became a major problem in the United States (for example, the Waco seige). 

Suddenly 9/11 happened and those problems vanished. The survivalists focus their negative attention on terrorists, not the US government.",2015-06-29 03:01:44+00:00,csm0vkd,7.0,t1_csls0yr,17932.0,worldnews

2322,"Yes, Abbott is spinning the terror issue for political gain. He is a politician, it's what they do. 

However I would disagree that Australia has a low risk of Islamic terrorist attack. We're a developed, progressive, globalised, largely Christian / secular multicultural society and a key ally of the United States. Through those criteria we are everything the Islamic State is not, and therefore a high-priority target. 

Put simply we are crusader infidels that must be cleansed from the earth.

As demonstrated Australia has already produced several ISIS recruits of its own. 

I think it would unwise to an extreme degree to simply assume Australia is not a target. 

This does not mean that we should burn mosques to the ground and export all Muslims (like a lot of the Facebook groups I've seen advocate for). The less hysteria, the better, both in dealing with terrorism and life in general. 

But we cannot ignore this threat, because it's very real. Which means the politicans will take advantage of it. 

What we ought to focus on is level-headed and rational arguments to determine the best response (protecting Australians against terror attacks), not deploying hyperbole against the other side of the political spectrum ('the PM that cried wolf').

I hate to say it guys but we can't deny that there is a group of people out there with a clearly demonstrated objective of attacking and killing the civilian populations of Western countries. 

The shooter at the beach in Tunisia deliberately prioritised English, French and German tourists over African or Middle-Eastern people. 

Lindt Cafe and the Bali bombings also demonstrate that Australians are targets for terrorism.

Failing this method, smoke the whole treeline. They can't shoot you if they can't see you.

2367,"Order queueing deployments is your friend. It's a quick investment of heavy micro that can save you a lot of time and distraction.

Say you've got 200 points built up and you need to take that town fuckin' pronto, but you've also got other shit going on elsewhere on the map. 

You can spawn several 4-squad blobs straight into the town, but more often than not you'll forget about them for ten minutes and leave them sitting there inside their transports scratching their balls, waiting for that cluster bomb to hit them and deliver delicious points to Ivan. You hear the klaxon, spacebar over to them and there's nothing but flaming vehicle wrecks and a few PTSD'd survivors.

Here's your fix.

Once they've all spawned at deployment, pop your camera over, select them as they're cruising along the road, hold SHIFT, click UNLOAD, click FAST MOVE, then click somewhere safe.

The transports will keep Fast Moving to the town (as normal) but once the get they're they'll automatically disembark troops (most of which should automatically garrison into urban districts) and get the fuck outta there.

If you're using IFVs, leave them just behind the town, so they can come out and contribute fire if needed. Same goes for gunship transport choppers like Hinds or Heavy Hogs.

If they're APCs, send them to the very far flanks as an early warning system against choppers, or back to the CV as bodyguards against SF infiltrators. I've saved my deployment sector from cheeky little fuckers creeping out of the woods many times this way. It must be frustrating for the baddies after they micro an SF squad ALL the way around the back. 

If you're using soft cheap transports, fuck them WAAAAY off away from anywhere. Not near front, not the flanks, not the CV. This also goes for fat soft transport choppers. After they've dropped their troops the only thing they can do is die and feed Ivan points in Destruction. If it's Conquest, consider sending them to the front for suicidal recon (and hilarity). Always funny to see a 50-point ATGM vehicle get spotted and artied because they flung a missile at a 5-point truck. 

It's a bit fucked up when you consider they did this in real life, in actual wars.

One last tip for Airborne - those choppers are a lot slower than you think. Often they arrive at that critical central town at the same time as 150kmhr wheeled transports would anyway. You need to have landed and deployed by the time the enemy is visible. If they see you and the choppers are still wheeling around in the air adjusting their skirts, they're going to fuck you up, so land and deploy BEFORE the town, not on top of it. Failure to do so will be harshly punished.

 Try to use their extreme mobility to your advantage and hit flanks. Airborne is about moving a small amount of high quality inf to where they are unexpected and then fucking off. It's not for Call of Duty cinematics where you fly bravely through AA, invariably get hit, spiral sickeningly to the ground and explode yet four main infantry characters survive and end up winning a war by themselves. 

I usually only ever use choppers for sending SF and recon inf to the flanks, never for assaulting towns with massed paras like VDV or Airborne. They die just as easily as line or reserve and they're a lot more expensive.",2015-06-17 04:40:13+00:00,cs98n0n,1.0,t3_39qowb,287893.0,wargame
