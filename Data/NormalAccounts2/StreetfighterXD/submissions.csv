I'm setting the funding goal at $10,000AUD, which is obviously nowhere near the budget of a final-release videogame, but it will enable the development of a far more complete demo version (ie one made by a professional game development team) which can then be matured into a full game later down the track. 

So this is our chance, really, to make this game into a real thing that covers the entire world. I think it's got potential to be among the most-played video games in the world, and that's not an exaggeration.

1. Production buildings: Barracks, Factory, Harbour, Airfield, now produce all the mobile units in-game, each with their own unit build queue of 10 maximum. The Headquarters now produces Production structures. This gives much more flexibilty in unit production. 

 2. Chat system: finally players can now communicate in-game. Click the 'chat' button in the top bar to bring up the Chat window. Players can type directly into the text field for Global Chat (seen by everyone) or click on a player's name to chat to them privately. Let's.... let's not do the Nigerian Prince thing, guys

3. Revamped Alliance system: Used to be automatically-inclusive alliances - Player A and B ally together, if player B allies with player C, Players A and C become allies automatically. This sometimes caused all players to end up allied to each other, which was no good, because this isn't a World Peace simulator. 
Now, Player A and B can ally together and if Player B and C become allies, A and C remain un-allied until they choose to do so. It's all about choice these days folks

4. Bunch other little bug fixes etc.

SETTING:

It is 400 years after a second Long Night was defeated by an alliance between Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryean and Tyrion Lannister. Many things have changed. 

An industrial revolution sees smog spewing into the air over King's Landing, Oldtown, White Harbour and elsewhere. Firearms, including machine guns and artillery, have made the armour of knights irrelevant.
Motorcars and primitive aircraft have replaced horses and the again-extinct dragons. Ravens now sit in rows atop telegraph wires, cawing to each other.
Industrialised farming takes advantage of years-long summers to produce enormous food surpluses, with the population booming into the tens of millions.

The North, the Westerlands and the Reach are thriving democratic states while facism rises in the Stormlands, the Vale and Dorne. All the Westerosi states are experimenting with colonial empires in Sothyros and the recently-discovered Nessos to the west. To the east, communist revolutionaries overthrow the oligarchs in Slaver's Bay, establishing a vast socialist state from the Jade Sea to the eastern edge of the Free Cities, which are finally debating forming an economic and social union of their own. 

Industrialisation lifts a thriving middle class of merchants and other service providers out of the commoners, while the value of peasant labour drops drastically, sending millions flocking to the cities looking for work.

A complex network of alliances established by the old royal families has prevented large-scale wars between the various nations for a generation. 

But now, another long, dark winter approaches. The lessons learned in the past are forgotten in the continuous jostle for wealth and power. As the past threatens to return and swallow the Realm whole, an uncertain future looms.

The assassination of a minor noble sets off a spark that will set the world ablaze, yet again.

Theres's this bloke in his thirties there and we're all in our twenties so it's a bit suss but we continue the pissup. This bloke is smashing down rumbos and tinnies like there's no fuckin tomorrow and he's off chops before anyone else got started. 

I have the misfortune of being a big tall skinny wanker so he picks me straight up. Hes always coming up to me during the night with his wok-eye fuckin drunk face and being like oi lad wanna blue and I'm like nah mate I'm good ay. 

So he keeps this shit up all night. Chucking goon bags at me when I had my nice shirt on and I'm getting pretty fucking dark at him. He even tries to MMA chokehold me but he's half my size so I just push him off. 

Anyways fast foward to the end of the night and this cunt is sprawled out on the mattress in front of the fire barrel with his thongs off his feet, out cold. I'm getting ready to walk down the road to my mates place to crash but I spy the unconscious dickhead and his abandoned thongs. Fuck yeah, I think, and quick as a flash snatch his thongs and chuck them in the flaming barrel. Get that up ya, ya fuckin wanker.

I can't help but have a skite as I walk out, there's two of my other mates there that also share my opinion as to the dickheadry of this dickhead. 

""Oi Jonno,"" I say to John as I walk past.

The airlock's paltry few cubic metres of atmosphere howled as it raced away into the vacuum beyond the vents.

Background noise ceased. All Jake could hear was his own breathing, cycled back through his shortwave comm.
Control cut back in through his organic, static-laden huffs.

""EVA-MC One, you are clear. Good hunting.""

Paul keyed in over the secondary channel. ""Hunting? More like pest control. Exactly like pest control, in fact.""

Jake tried to laugh back to cover his nervousness. He could feel the vacuum clawing at his suit seals. ""Yeah. Just another bug hunt.""

Paul's return scoff crackled over the radio. ""Relax, rookie. First time is always a bit freaky. You'll do fine. Just think of the hazard pay, it's what I do.""

The hatch opened.

Grimy white-painted titanium gave way to an inky-black field. 

Disorientation immediately took hold. 

Before the two space-suited figures, an impossibly vast milky-green sphere hung in the blackness.

That sphere was DX-3, the latest planet discovered by humans and by far the most interesting. Not for the planet itself - according to all data it was a barren rock wrapped in nothing but sulfur and methane - but for the ring of asteroids that circled it, glinting like chips of greenish-blue ice.

These weren't regular asteroids. They were alive.

A whole biosphere of space-borne organisms riddled each rock, leeching rare super-dense minerals like tantalum out of their strata.

The  extruded the minerals from their tips as glassy crystals, acting like natural collection mirrors to boost their photosynthetic intake.

The crystals, by weight, were the most valuable substance known to mankind.

Humans had found the DX system two years ago and several space mining corporations had already set up shop in the asteroid field.

But there was a problem. Like all ecosystems, the Void Reef had predators. 

They saw the first one less than five minutes after exiting the airlock. 

An amorphous, armoured shape, nearly jet-black and invisible against the darkness of space, flinging itself from one asteroid to the next. A Macrophage. 

When it landed, it wrapped itself around the Void-coral and absorbed its organic mass in second. The priceless crystals were absorbed along with it, ruining their molecular structure and rendering them worthless. 

This is why Jake and Paul were there, jetting through the emptiness on compact Extra-Vehicular Activity rigs. They were exterminators.

Paul keyed over the primary channel. “This is your first one, rook,” he said. “Got it locked?”

Infra-red sensors in Jake’s helmet picked up the Macrophage’s heat signature as it gorged itself on the Void-coral, and orange targeting graphics sprang into life across his face plate.

“I got it,” Jake said shakily. His thumb clamped on his joystick’s safety switch. The high-powered railgun mounted on his EVA unit’s right armature swung out, blue status lights blinking along its length as its magnetic capacitators charged. 
“Target locked.”

“Fire.”

Jake’s finger squeezed the trigger and the Macrophage blew apart, gelatinous chunks of flesh tumbling away into the void.

“I got it!” Jake yelled in triumph.

“Nice hit, rookie,” Paul keyed over the short-comm.  “Pop your scan and the check for any more.”

Jake’s railgun automatically swivelled back into its nacelle, beginning its six-second reload sequence. Jake released the safety and hit the scan button. His console screen showed a blue sphere expand through the surrounding two cubic kilometres, then bleeped, showing nothing but the neutral green icons of local asteroids.

“Scan’s negative,” he said.

“That’s drinks, then,” Paul keyed back. Cones of condensing gas issued from his propulsion rig, spinning his bulky exosuit to align with the mothership’s ventral airlock.

“Don’t regulations say we have to scan twice before we end mission?” Jake asked.

“Hell with that,” Paul shot back. “I’ve got two weeks of overdue leave starting the minute I take this suit off.”

“But the regs say we should scan twice. I mean, we don’t even know anything about Macrophages. For all we know we could be making the problem worse. Like, my dad, back on Earth, he had bad rats in his apartment, so he was laying out poison baits for them. Turns out they were gene-adapted and were just eating the baits, you know, because their digestive systems could break down the compounds. The were feeding them to their babies and everything. I mean, he had more rats after he put the baits then when he started.”

“You talk too much, kid. Hit your jets. We’re heading back.”

Jake’s thumb hovered over his booster toggle. He knew his first spacewalk would be recorded for trainee evaluation. But Paul was the senior ranger, his word was law while both of them were in the void.

Screw it, Jake thought, and punched his scan button, watching the blue sphere expand through space again. The same neutral green asteroid icons appeared. Nothing. He reached for the booster toggle again.

Abrupt warning tones screaming from his console stopped him. 

The screen was flashing, dozens - hundreds - of red icons popping in, surrounding them. Like they had always been there.

His suit’s central processing unit spat out analysis data. Macrophages, it said. 107 contacts.

The chunks, he realised. They’ve re-formed. Each one, a new Macrophage.

“PAUL! CONTACT!” Jake screamed into the comm, fumbling for his railgun safety.

Paul’s reply was lost over the buzzing alarm - Jake could see his exosuit suddenly tumbling, as crawling black blobs clung to his shoulders, his helmet, his propulsion rig.

Jake saw plumes of condensation - suit atmosphere, not rig gas - issuing into space.

Paul’s mic went dead.

“Oh, God,” Jake breathed.

His railgun went live, orange targeting graphics racing across his faceplate.

A one-round capacity, with a six-second reload. 107 contacts.

The red contacts were swarming in on him. His screen was solid red.

Jake squeezed the trigger.

""EVA-MC One, mission is go. Popping the hatch.""

The airlock's paltry few cubic metres of atmosphere howled as it raced away into the vacuum beyond the vents.


Background noise ceased. All Jake could hear was his own breathing, cycled back through his shortwave comm.
Control cut back in through his organic, static-laden huffs.
""EVA-MC One, you are clear. Good hunting.""

Paul keyed in over the secondary channel. ""Hunting? More like pest control. Exactly like pest control, in fact.""

Jake tried to laugh back to cover his nervousness. He could feel the vacuum clawing at his suit seals. ""Yeah. Just another bug hunt.""

Paul's return scoff crackled over the radio. ""Relax, rookie. First time is always a bit freaky. You'll do fine. Just think of the hazard pay, it's what I do.""

The hatch opened.

Grimy white-painted titanium gave way to an inky-black field. Disorientation immediately took hold. Before the two space-suited figures, an impossibly vast milky-green sphere hung in the blackness.

That sphere was DX-3, the latest planet discovered by humans and by far the most interesting.
Not for the planet itself - according to all data it was a barren rock wrapped in nothing but sulfur and methane - but for the ring of asteroids that circled it, glinting like chips of greenish-blue ice.

These weren't regular asteroids. They were alive.

A whole biosphere of space-borne organisms riddled each rock, leeching rare super-dense minerals like tantalum out of their strata.

The coral extruded the minerals from their tips as glassy crystals, acting like natural collection mirrors to boost their photosynthetic intake.

The crystals, by weight, were the most valuable substance known to mankind.

Humans had found the DX system two years ago and several space mining corporations had already set up shop in the asteroid field.

But there was a problem. Like all ecosystems, the Void Reef had predators. 
They saw the first one less than five minutes after exiting the airlock. 
An amorphous, armoured shape, nearly jet-black and invisible against the darkness of space, flinging itself from one asteroid to the next. A Macrophage. 
When it landed, it wrapped itself around the Void-coral and absorbed its organic mass in second. The priceless crystals were absorbed along with it, ruining their molecular structure and rendering them worthless. 

This is why Jake and Paul were there, jetting through the emptiness on compact Extra-Vehicular Activity rigs and armed with remote-controlled railguns.
They were exterminators.

Paul keyed over the primary channel. “This is your first one, rook,” he said. “Got it locked?”

Infra-red sensors in Jake’s helmet picked up the Macrophage’s heat signature as it gorged itself on the Void-coral, and orange targeting graphics sprang into life across his face plate.

“I got it,” Jake said shakily. His thumb clamped on his joystick’s safety switch. The high-powered railgun mounted on his EVA unit’s right armature swung out, blue status lights blinking along its length as its magnetic capacitators charged. 

“Target locked.”

“Fire.”

Jake’s finger squeezed the trigger and the Macrophage blew apart, gelatinous chunks of flesh tumbling away into the void.

“I got it!” Jake yelled in triumph.

“Nice hit, rookie,” Paul keyed over the short-comm.  “Pop your scan and the check for any more.”

Jake’s railgun automatically swivelled back into its nacelle, beginning its six-second reload sequence. Jake switched it to ‘safe’ and hit the scan button. His console screen showed a blue sphere expand through the surrounding two cubic kilometres, then bleeped, showing nothing but the neutral green icons of local asteroids.

“Scan’s negative,” he keyed.

“That’s drinks, then,” Paul keyed back. Cones of condensing gas issued from his propulsion rig, spinning his bulky exosuit to align with the mothership’s ventral airlock.

“Don’t regulations say we have to scan twice before we end mission?” Jake asked.

“Hell with that,” Paul shot back. “I’ve got two weeks of overdue leave starting the minute I take this suit off.”

“But the regs say we should scan twice. I mean, we don’t even know anything about Macrophages. For all we know we could be making the problem worse. Like, my dad, back on Earth, he had bad rats in his apartment, so he was laying out poison baits for them. Turns out they were gene-adapted and were just eating the baits, you know, because their digestive systems could break down the compounds. The were feeding them to their babies and everything. I mean, he had more rats after he put the baits then when he started.”

“You talk too much, kid. Hit your jets. We’re heading back.”

Jake’s thumb hovered over his booster toggle. He knew his first spacewalk would be recorded for trainee evaluation. But Paul was the senior ranger, his word was law while both of them were in the void.

Screw it, Jake thought, and punched his scan button again.

His console screen showed the blue sphere swelling through space again. Jake watched it go. The same neutral green asteroid icons appeared. Nothing. He reached for the booster toggle again.

Abrupt warning tones screaming from his console stopped him. 

The screen was flashing, dozens - hundreds - of red icons popping in, surrounding them. Like they had always been there.

His suit’s central processing unit spat out analysis data. 

Macrophages, it said. 107 contacts.

The chunks, he realised. They re-formed. Each one, a new Macrophage.

“PAUL! CONTACT!” Jake screamed into the comm, fumbling for his railgun safety.

Paul’s reply was lost over the buzzing alarm - Jake could see his exosuit suddenly tumbling, as crawling black blobs clung to his shoulders, his helmet, his propulsion rig.

Jake saw plumes of condensation - suit atmosphere, not rig gas - spraying into space.

Paul’s mic went dead.

“Oh, God,” Jake breathed.

His railgun went live, orange targeting graphics racing across his faceplate.

A one-round capacity, with a six-second reload. 107 contacts.

The red contacts were swarming in on him. His screen was solid red.

Jake squeezed the trigger.

Unlike the preceding Gulf War, Coalition forces acted extremely swiftly to secure oil infrastructure during the 2003 invasion as a strategic priority, ostensibly to prevent Iraqi forces setting oil wells alight to 1) create massive smoke clouds as cover against Coalition airstrikes and 2) deny those resources to the invaders.

In the absence of evidence for the Coalition's stated goal of removing the Iraqi Government's (seemingly non-existent) weapons of mass destruction, and under a more realpolitik (and cynical) interpretation of the US's motivations, the goal of securing Iraq's oil supply seems to be a likely cause for the invasion.
