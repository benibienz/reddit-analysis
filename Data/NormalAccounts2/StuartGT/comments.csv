7,"&gt; 30th November Horizons Beta - 15k users per Steamstats

That 24hr Peak Concurrent occurred during [ED's Black Friday discount sale](http://i.imgur.com/kjqDRjn.png) (25th-30th Nov; £10/€13/$15), following a record high of 18092 on 29th Nov.  As [you can see on SteamDB](http://i.imgur.com/vsVemwv.png), that high didn't last long - within three weeks it'd tapered off to normal (due to many reasons: learning curve, lack of story-driven gameplay, poor matchmaking, etc).  The May peak of 6909 lasted a week.

What [SteamCharts](http://steamcharts.com/app/359320#All) is good for is showing the concurrent players averaged-per-month, and how they've increased by over 35%:

* From Jan to Jul 2016 = 3223 (peak avg in Jan of 3667)
* From Aug 2016 to Today = 4424 (peak avg in Oct of 4626)

The 24hr Peak Concurrent for each month has also increased by a similar percentage (33%):

* Jan-Jul = 6635
* Aug-Today = 8854

What this does show is that as the game improves CMDRs are returning, new CMDRs join, and the playerbase is more stable &amp; consistent now (for 3+ months) than it has ever been.

*While i see that overcharged is being significally reduced, it still would be the ""35%-45%"" damage increase you state there. Unless the standard beam laser will be more than 45% stronger than the burst laser, which i consider unlikely, the modified burst laser will be the stronger weapon overall, without even considering that your plan still includes to make the beam laser being the most intense on capacitor use and heat Generation. So while the base idea of what each laser type should do is sound, i wonder if you also have any plan on how to adjust modifications so the beam laser stays viable after Engineers?*

Overcharged gives a 35-45% damage boost, Short range can give 20%-40% for beams, which is in the same ballpark, but you're right it's smaller and comes with the range downside and other problems. I agree it's an area worth looking at more - I'll raise it for discussion but I don't think we'll make major changes before it's been attacked in beta.

Beams do have a limited set of modifiers available to them, firing rate/ammo/jitter all behave a bit weirdly (or not at all) when applied to beams - We fixed some of those issues as part of this change though, I see no reason we couldn't improve short range a bit and open up Overcharged on Beams to bring them up to parity while maintaining a choice. No promises till I've discussed it with the others though 

***

*On the subject of having to reroll items:*

 Mephane's point about *Focused* being repurposed and having an odd relation to *Long Range* is entirely valid, that's our mistake. Not currently sure what the solution is going to be but definitely taking it on board for the next discussion. The intent of these changes is that no-one should have to re-roll items unless they *want* to try an alternate option, if your loadout worked before, it's still effective now - there are just other options to go down. If you see exceptions to this or areas that we've gotten wrong then Please do let us know, that's why we're posting these early for feedback and can still make changes.

*On Rapid fire:*

Mea culpa on this one, I was using an incorrect calculation for its total DPS when we looked at balancing (reduced firing interval and increased rate of fire are NOT the same!) and as currently described its dps is going to be too high, I'll edit the OP with the updated proposal that leaves it on an even playing field with Overcharged - in summary, the range on the rate of fire improvement is being pulled up from the low end, so it'll be substantially higher on average, but the Damage per hit penalty is increasing to ~10-15%.

***

*What's the point in Rapid fire now if you have negative dps?*

The DPS increase is about the same as Overcharged give or take some variance, before adding side effects. Updated OP for clarity, best roll has 66.6% increased fire rate and 13% reduced damage per hit =&gt;44% DPS increase.",2016-11-21 13:58:38+00:00,da9hicn,2.0,t1_da9gpeh,1632.0,EliteDangerous

Greetings Commanders!

The next release we're currently working towards is a 2.2 update which will be arriving soon, along with a short beta. 

We wanted to take the time to discuss the changes we're making to give you folk a heads up, and explain our thinking a little. We've separated the various changes out into their own posts to keep the feedback channel nice and clean. Mark and I will hopefully be able to jump in to answer follow up questions.

So have a read and feel free to discuss in the threads, your feedback will be greatly appreciated.

#Engineer Blueprint Balance

There are one or two focussed changes to reduce the power where blueprints are overpowered or too prolific, the changes here are primarily about buffs to make making a lot more blueprints into competitive choices for players, and defining roles for some where their intent wasn't clear. Note that while there are a lot of buffs, we're not intending to increase the maximum power of engineered vessels (it's actually shrinking slightly compared to base ships), but there will be a lot more ways to reach that power. None of these changes are final until they've been tested in Beta, feedback welcome!

Where Blueprints have been modified this will affect existing items, which will be updated as if they had been always rolled with the new recipe – removed attributes will be stripped off, new ones will be rolled, existing ones will be mapped into the new range (for example if you previously got an 8 on a 0-10 attribute, and the attribute is now 5-25 you will get a 21). These changes are based on discussion from Sandro, mike &amp; myself, comments in Italic are explaining the rationale behind each set of changes.

###New Recipes:

* Unlock Grade 5 Burst Laser from Broo Tarquin.
* Unlock Grade 5 Beam Laser from Broo Tarquin .
* Unlock Grade 5 Mines from Juri Ishmaak.
* Unlock Grade 5 Missiles from Liz Ryder.
* Unlock Grade 5 Torpedos from Liz Ryder.
* Unlock Grade 5 Railguns from Tod ‘The Blaster’ McQuinn.
* Unlock Grade 4&amp;5 Hull Reinforcement Thermal/Kinetic/Explosive resistance Blueprints from Selene Jean.
* Unlock Grade 4&amp;5 Armour Thermal/Kinetic/Explosive and Advanced Blueprints from Selene Jean.
* Unlock Grade 4&amp;5 Shield Booster Thermal/Kinetic/Explosive Blueprints from Didi Vatermann

&amp;nbsp;

# Blueprint Changes:

###Overcharged (Weapon):

This Blueprint is just too powerful overall, and used ubiquitously. We’d like to rein it in overall (while still leaving it king of raw DPS), especially when combined with projectile weapons that are not affected by the active power draw:

* Damage Modifier slightly increased (to 35%-45% from 30-35% at G5).
* Fire rate modifier removed (was 8%-20%), primarily to differentiate from rapid fire.
* Added clip size reduction modifier (-15% to -25% at the top end, though as the fire rate modifier has been removed you get more damage per bullet and don’t fire for much less time).

Overall this will reduce its DPS boost with a perfect roll from +62% to +45% before side effects, this is still the highest of all Blueprints.

###Focussed (Weapon):
This recipe didn’t express a clear purpose, and was generally underwhelming. It is now being improved to hit harder but less often (overall DPS boost) while gaining more ability to pierce targets. With its existing hardness piercing this weapon is very capable of punching at ships above its own class.

* Range modifier removed (conflicted with Long Range too much).
* Damage increase added (+27%-+40% at G5).
* Rate of Fire reduction added(-22% to -35% at G5).
* Active heat penalty flipped around to avoid overly penalising low level versions.
* Armour piercing increase added, increasing chance to breach the hull by up to 25%.


###Short Range (Weapon):
This Blueprint wasn’t in a terrible place, but needed a bit of an improvement.

* Active Power increase removed (was +10% to +30% at G5).


###Long Range (Weapon):
This blueprint was heavily under-used, and quite underpowered to go with it. While the increased range does affect damage falloff, this isn’t as big an effect as it needed.

* Damage Penalty reduced (down to 10-15% from 15-25%).
* Active power increase removed (was +20% to +50% at G5).


###Double Shot (Weapon):
No major changes here, but coupled with our separate improvements for slugshots, the Grade 5 version gave a little bit too much.

* Clip size for Grade 5 version reduced to 6 (from 8).


###Light Weight (Weapon):
Another highly under-performing Blueprint, straight up buffs here, it’s similar in theme to Efficient but still distinct.

* Damage Reduction removed (was up to 5%).
* Reactor power requirement reduction added (10% to 20% at G5).
* WEP draw reduction added (10% to 20% at G5).


###Sturdy (Weapon):
This blueprint is the least used across almost all weapon types. We think the purpose of it is fundamentally a useful one (especially as we open up options to fight as shields drop) but the effect needed to be much bigger.

* Health increase doubled (from 50-125% to 100-250% at G5).
* Heat reduction added (20%-30% at G5)


###Optimised (Shield Generator):
The intent of this blueprint is fine, but it's underwhelming compared to alternatives, so it's getting some improvements

* Reactor power draw reduction improved (20%-40% from 13-30%).
* Mass reduction doubled (16-40% from 8-20%).


###Thermal/Kinetic (Shield Generator):
These two recipes have exactly the same change, to make them a little more attractive when compared to Reinforced.

* Module health increase added (+20%-40% at G5).


###Kinetic/Thermal/Explosive (Hull Reinforcements):
All of these single-type resistance blueprints have the same change, reducing the penalties to make them a more competitive choice compared to Heavy Duty or Advanced. Especially if you are willing to sacrifice resistance to one type in favour of the other two.

* Penalties for off-types on all single-type resistances reduced (to 10%-15% from 10%-20% at G5)


###Kinetic/Thermal/Explosive (Shield Boosters):
All of these single-type resistance blueprints have the same change, reducing the penalties to make them a more competitive choice compared to Heavy Duty or Resistive. Especially if you are willing to sacrifice resistance to one type in favour of the other two.

* Penalties for off-types on all single-type resistances reduced (to 4%-6% from 12%-13% at G5)


###Resistive (Shield Booster):
Just a little bit too good as it was, though the change here is relatively small.

* Resistance to all types reduced by 2% (to 10-13% from 12-15% at G5).

&amp;nbsp;

#Special Effects:

###Auto Loader:

While this is a useful effect, it’s not really performing up to the level required for now.

* Reload rate increased by 50% (now reloads one shell every 2 fire intervals rather than every 3).
* Clip size reduction removed (was 20%)


###Concordant Sequence:
Shield restoration effects are cool, but this one pales in comparison to Regeneration sequence.

* Duration of regen boost doubled.
* Effect of regen boost doubled.


###Corrosive Shells:
This is a special that is a bit of a non-choice as it is very effective but has no scaling with size/number. We’re not making changes right now, but we are looking at adding some kind of scaling here.

###Dispersal Field:
We’re removing the innate damage penalty from this one.

* Removed innate 10% damage penalty.


###Emissive Munitions:
Emissive munitions are a bit too good at their job, and the side effect of increasing emissions so far that gimbal weapon tracking automatically maxes out isn’t really what was intended. 

* Duration Reduced (to about 30% of previous)
* Emission increase reduced, it’ll still light you up to about the level of a hot anaconda, but will not automatically max out all gimbals.


###Feedback Cascade:
This is a bit too much of a “must have” special effect in many cases, and doesn’t scale with the number of guns or their size at all, making it a bit of a non-choice. The effect is semantically similar (though overall weaker if you’re only using a single small weapon), but should feel more interesting.

* Effect of feedback cascade changed, rather than setting the healing rate to 10% on the first trigger, each hit will deal bonus “damage” to the pool of health to be healed, so multiple hits will reduce the shield healing received. With a cap at the old 10% mark being their maximum effect. The number of hits required to reach this cap will depend on the power of the railgun and size of the shield cell, but is in the range of 2-5.


###Overload Munitions:
We’re removing ammo capacity penalties to make this one a little more attractive.

* Remove 20% ammo capacity penalty.


###Smart Rounds:
We’re removing Flight Time penalties to make this one a little more attractive.

* Remove 20% increase to flight time.

&amp;nbsp;

Full patch notes on other related changes will be available nearer the time. Balance changes/improvements to non-combat recipes will come in a future pass.

101,"&gt; The point of discounting fallout by the way is to make the game and the new dlcs coming similar to the full price, and simply including the new dlc in the full tag price. The point of doing the same with who bought horizions full price is simply to take more money off of who didn't wait.

What?  You realise you've described the same scenario for both games (buy on release, pay more; buy later, pay less) but apparently Fallout's is ok and ED's isn't?

&gt; My brother's account for instance has base game + horizions and got paid less than 30 $. 

So he bought ED in Nov 2015 ($15), and Horizons in a recent sale ($20).  Good for him for waiting: 11 months after ED's release, and 7+ months after Horizons' 2.0 release.",2016-11-16 12:36:26+00:00,da2n4fw,5.0,t1_da2mz2s,373.0,EliteDangerous

116,"&gt; Back to your 45k played more than 4hr. Ok good. 5%. MMO 5%. It's still good to you? A game without subcription? Sure w/e.

As long as more than 1% (total, not just Steam) are playing it, and there is a vibrant community, I'll consider the game ""good"" (i.e. active, which is what I assume you meant). Without subscription makes the game have no financial-to-time commitment (""I've paid £10 this month, so I should play it a lot to get my money's worth""), and also allow the ""spare"" cash to be spent on other fun games too.  Currently I'm playing ED, Civ6, RL, and started Remember Me which I found forgotten in my Steam library.  I'll buy more games in the Xmas sales too.  If tied to a subscription, I'd buy fewer games.

&gt; When i bought the game i bought it as it is. ""Steam words not mine"". So i expect it too remain it as that or become better.

It has. Dozens of new features, hundreds of improvements, thousands of bug fixes.

&gt; Second of all, from steam page they say is a single player game. Sure but they don't specify it's a ONLINE MUST GAME. They changed that on the way, before that you didn't needed to be online.

[A broadband connection has been a **minimum requirement** since day one](http://web.archive.org/web/20150403103724/http://store.steampowered.com/app/359320/).  I assume you check System Requirements before buying a PC game?

&gt; Third of all, just because this area of the industry can't be really brought to court, doesn't mean it isn't fraudlent. I mean No mans Sky DID IT and got away with it and even if another one does the same IT WILL BE THE SAME FREAKING THING.

You haven't clarified what fraudulent thing FDev is apparently doing.  If anything, you sound burned and/or paranoid *because* of what HG did (fully deserving of chargebacks for false advertising missing features btw).

&gt; Fourth of all: If you buy a phone, and after 2 hours they put another operating system on it and it will break, it will be acceptable? HELL NO. Warranty baby. Games don't have that, no entertainment has that. And you can pretty much abuse all you want.

Now you're going off-topic on one hell of a tangent, which has zero to do with ED.

&gt; From my point of view, he put money in something that should have become what he believed in, he played a portion of the game, untill now, seen the game isn't what they said it will he wants the portion of the money from the ""pre-order"" that he didn't used back. Why isn't allowed?

Because the OP didn't buy a multi-pack (bundle?) of separate expansions/seasons, they bought the LTXP: one product that has so far delivered what was advertised, with more to come.

&gt; Remember SLAVERY was legal. Just because the law is loose now doesn't mean it's alright.

Tangent. ""Someone else wanting a part-refund on a Lifetime Expansion Pass for a game, is analogous to the banning of slavery."" Hahahaha! Are you ok?",2016-11-15 18:30:07+00:00,da1ku5o,6.0,t1_da1jt5c,1230.0,EliteDangerous

122,"&gt; Again i only speak of the Steam users, but looking on steamspy the average people played out of 90k it's 17 minutes. 

From SteamSpy:

&gt; * Playtime in the last 2 weeks: 17:58 (average) 04:34 (median)
&gt;     * Median shows that ~45k players played more than 4hr34m, while the chart indicates ~22k players (25%) played 20hr+.
&gt; * Playtime total: 64:35 (average) 17:20 (median)

You may want to check the [definition of ""average""](http://uk.lmgtfy.com/?q=average+definition).

***

&gt; He didn't buy the game. He invested.

Nope, he definitely bought ED, and then bought the LTXP. Whereas:

&gt; Invest (verb) = put (money) into financial schemes, shares, property, or a commercial venture with the expectation of achieving a profit.

***

&gt; Sure it delivered a game, but if the game became a state where grinding is the best way to play it it's like the game never happened.

Your definition of ""best"" may match some other players' opinions of Elite (""I have to grind"") is not the same as *everyone* elses. I've never grinded in ED once. Back to the OP on that point: as they were playing since release, if they felt the game was an unenjoyable grind, why buy the LTXP and instead *wait* for changes so they didn't feel ""grinding is the best way to play""?

&gt; FDEV does the same thing as HG.

So, are you elaborating that the ""grind"" perception of ED equates to ""You can see the No Mans Sky example. It was clearly a fraud, yet the law is on their side. FDEV does the same""? Having grindy elements is now **fraud**? :O",2016-11-15 17:57:03+00:00,da1j6o7,4.0,t1_da1hsnw,1656.0,EliteDangerous

Hahahahaha!  Please elaborate on how FDev ""does the same"" as HG, when the former communicates with the community daily, and releases information of upcoming features and improvements
months in advance.

&gt; you don't want to invest in them

Buying a game isn't an investment, it's a purchase.

&gt; I mean there are 900k people that bought this game, yet only less than 1% play on regular basis.

SteamSpy shows that of Steam ED owners, around 90k play on a regular basis (10%). Don't confuse ""concurrent players"" with ""fortnightly players"". This statistic of course ignores all the non-Steam ED players...",2016-11-15 17:18:51+00:00,da1h984,2.0,t1_da1duvs,4145.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; When you are deaf to hear community you end up losing people. 

FDev's team communicate daily with the community on here, the official forums, and social media: see the [dev tracker](https://elitedevtracker.com/).

&gt; When a game gets improved his player base grows, is this the case? [I don't think](http://steamcharts.com/cmp/251570,359320#All).

SteamCharts historical graph is flawed: for historical data 3+ months ago, it uses the peak concurrent for that month, skewing the graph. Meanwhile, their average playerbase per month figures are great indicators, and show ED is very healthy.

[SteamDB has a more accurate chart](https://steamdb.info/app/359320/graphs/) ([image](http://i.imgur.com/cZeGGVb.png), proving the Steam ED playerbase is more stable now: for a record 3 months straight the 24hr peak concurrent players has stayed higher than 5350. It also clearly indicates the spikes that occurred during sales in 2015 (which skew SteamCharts historical graph).  Horizons released in the Dec 15th dip *after* the record peak btw.

Here's [7D2D's page](https://steamdb.info/app/251570/graphs/) if you would like to see: it too receives playerbase spikes whenever a discount sale occurs, then the playerbase tapers off. Still a very fun game (I own it too) if you like Team-ZombieHorde-Survival-MineCraft gameplay (the survival-crafting genre is **very** popular with the 12-25 age bracket).

Note that Steam players make up around 50% of the ED playerbase: in January there were 1.4m owners, and of them 670k Steam ED users, with considerable crossover (FDevStore purchases can get a Steam key free, and vice versa).  There are no stats for the non-Steam playerbase (majority of which are the early backers).

&gt; As I customer I have seen my goods not arriving at all

Not true. Since your LTXP purchase in August 2015, you have/will receive(d):

* 2.0, 2.1 &amp; 2.2
* every future expansion, of which there has been no official release dates (only estimated release windows for 2.3 and 2.4)
* beta access to all of the above, including 1.4 and 1.5

You have received what was promised.

&gt; Speculations say beta of 2.3 will probably come in february 2017 meaning probably this season will be delayed of almost a year.

Back in February 2.3 was slated for Autumn/Fall (Sep 21st to Dec 20th).  If it releases in March then it would be delayed by approx. three months. Likewise 2.4 was Winter (Dec 21st to Mar 20th), currently expected around Jun/Jul, so delayed approx. four months.  No need for exaggeration.

&gt; RSI refunded me almost without problem(that's another story).

CIG started giving refunds with little issue after their ToS changes in June, and the much-publicised Streetroller refund drama involving California's Attorney General. All backers prior to June 2016 are entitled to a refund due to not yet receiving a product, either Squadron 42 or Star Citizen.

&gt; Considering the expansion I bought for full price tag got deflated so fast.... I can't really see a point for who like me bought horizons at launch, exept ofc for ""premium"" access. And then again if I wanted another 3 month earlier ""premium"" access to beta, I would had to pay again.

**Wait, I thought you bought the LTXP (as per your OP), not the Horizons Season Pass? Your story is beginning to leak through holes...**

Anyway, Horizons' price was discounted in sales, as all games do, from its initial £30 (to ED owners) in Dec 2015. See Fallout 4 for example: released in Nov 2015, and 33% off in Feb 2016.

&gt; I wonder how much time it will take them to implement microtransactions on credits, at this point.

CIG have promised that. FDev have publicly rejected that idea. Be careful not to confuse the two business models.

&gt; I have plenty of reasons to not allow this thing keep going. It might just be me. It might not. Waiting 10 years to see the outcome looks quite a stupid excuse to me.

If you're not willing to support a developer for the long haul, then you shouldn't buy LTXPs (note: that's ""buy"". Not ""pledge"" or ""pre-order"" for which a chargeback is valid).",2016-11-15 17:06:00+00:00,da1gm5s,3.0,t1_da1cfnm,5221.0,EliteDangerous

130,"&gt; One year later I find myself with a delayed first expansion

2.0 ""Planetary Landings"" was released in December last year.  2.1 ""Engineers"" in June, 2.2 ""Ship Launched Fighters"" in October.

***

&gt; I feel betrayed by FD and their plan to develop this game

Since 1.0's release in Dec 2014, there have been [66 client &amp; server updates with 6075 documented improvements](http://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/Version_history) to the game.

***

&gt; I'm starting to think they will actually cut down this project at some point and keep going with their other projects, not making this game consistent ever.

Why?  FDev have around 300 employees, of which 49% of devs are working on ED as stated in the [recent financial report](http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/FDEV/12958316.html) ([ED's devteam](http://i.imgur.com/XwoaI40.png)), and some of the remainder (51%) are [working on Season's 3 and 4](/r/EliteDangerous/comments/4l4f3c/ask_him_anything_david_braben_cocreator_of_elite/d3k96iy/).

***

&gt; Should I proceed with a charge back in your opinion?

From [Which's guide to chargebacks](http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/advice/how-do-i-use-chargeback):

&gt; **When can chargeback be used?**

&gt; Chargeback can be used in cases of goods not arriving at all, goods that are damaged, goods that are different from the description, or where the merchant has ceased trading.

None of the above are valid claims for your Lifetime Expansion Pass purchase.",2016-11-15 11:52:57+00:00,da153m2,1.0,t3_5d20y0,1644.0,EliteDangerous

177,"Nope. This was the vote that is mistakenly referred to regularly (from [Chairman's Letter $19m](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/13266-Letter-From-The-Chairman-19-Million)):

&gt; **What should we do with the crowdfunding counter after we reach our goal?**

&gt; 1. Take the funds raised counter down after $23 million (mission achieved!) 5%
&gt; 2. Have the funding counter display the amount towards the current stretch goal / feature, not the total amount once we reach $23M. 7%
&gt; 3. Keep it up through development and continue to offer stretch goal rewards in addition to extra features and development milestones. 88%

&gt; Total Votes: 20995

In the same letter (emphasis mine):

&gt; Some Citizens have asked if $21 million will mark the end of the funding campaign and the stretch goal unlocks. **The answer is no**: For a couple of key reasons –

&gt; The first is that the goal of achieving $20M in development funding will actually be reached approximately at $23 million in funds raised. This is because we display the gross amount of funds received, but out of this we had to pay Kickstarter (approx. 10% of funds raised), Paypal/Credit card providers (approx. 4-5%), we have to reserve the fulfilment costs of the physical goods you have pledged for (over $1M right now) and finally the costs of building and maintaining the RSI site (which is a significant but very worthwhile investment, more so as some of the planned features like “organizations” rolls out).

&gt; There are also additional running costs beyond the development to be contemplated – customer support for the growing community, the cost of delivering terabytes of data and longer term hosting servers for the dogfighting and then later the persistent universe itself.

&gt; Finally there is one very important element – the more funds we can raise in the pre-launch phase, the more we can invest in additional content (more ships, characters etc.) and perhaps more importantly **we can apply greater number of resources to the various tasks to ensure we deliver the full functionality sooner rather than later**.

CIG simply told the SC community that they would be increasing the scope.  Chris even went on to calm concerns of scope creep in [Chairman's Letter $20m](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/13284-Letter-From-The-Chairman-20-Million):

&gt; There has been some concern about “feature creep” with the additional stretch goals. You should all know that we carefully consider the goals we announce. Typically the stretch goals fall into two categories;

&gt; The first are goals that involve features we already have planned or have implemented, but we couldn’t create content because of budgetary constraints. The first person combat on select planets is a great example of this type of goal. We already have FPS combat as part of the game in ship boarding, and we already have most of this already functional thanks to CryEngine, as we essentially have Crysis3 functionality out of the box. But creating all the environments and assets to fill them is a huge task, so we were planning on not doing any planetside combat initially, simply because of its cost, with the idea that we would slowly roll it out once the game is live. But with the additional funds we can now afford to create some of this content earlier rather than later.

&gt; The facial capture system is an example of the second type, where we identify technology and equipment that will make the game better and allow us to be more nimble and economically efficient in continually creating content for the ongoing universe that we are aiming to support. The motion capture system and sound studio were goals that feel into this category.

&gt; But both types of goals are carefully considered — we don’t commit to adding features that would hold up the game’s ability to go “live” in a fully functional state. Also remember that this is not like a typical retail boxed product — there is no rule that all features and content have to come online at the same time! As you can see from the Hangar Module we plan to make functionality and content come on line as it’s ready, so you should look at the stretch goals as a window into the future of functionality and content additions we plan for the live game.",2016-11-10 10:34:58+00:00,d9u5ven,6.0,t1_d9u1lij,12585.0,starcitizen

211,"&gt; both very late

As I said: 2.1 was delayed by 6 weeks, while 2.2 was delayed even longer, perhaps two months; rushing a release is not a good thing wouldn't you say?  So far FDev have communicated months in advance any delays to their promised release timetables: professional and trustworthy I'd say.  I prefer that to having no notice until the last minute, and then delays of years.

If you class a couple of months as ""very late"", distrustful and shady, what do you class for CIG's frequent last minute notices of delay:

* Arena Commander: 6 months; was scheduled for Dec 2013
* ArcCorp Beta: 15+ months; beta with roaming NPCs was scheduled for Spring 2015
* Star Marine: 18+ months; was scheduled for Mar 2015
* Squadron 42 Ep1: 23+ months; was scheduled for 2014 (KS), then 2015 ([BAFTA](http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2787306-1438681995-bafta.JPG)), then 2016 (Bishop Trailer)
* Star Citizen: MVP looks to be delayed until 2018/2019; was scheduled for late 2016 (BAFTA)

Seems unusual to spend $300+ in one recent weekend on a project with so many unannounced year-plus delays, then gripe about another game's pre-announced two-month delays.

Originally, the LTXP was available to us from KS (Nov 2012) through to the end of Premium Beta (June 2014), for a minimum of $50 depending on pledge/backing tier.  Owners of the LTXP gain beta access to every update and expansion, as well as on release.  The gaming media - that followed Elite Dangerous' alpha/beta development - publicised this.

Following the announcement of Horizons at Gamescom (Aug 2015) and many community requests for the LTXP to be made available for purchase again, it was put on sale for a pricey $180 (including discount) simultaneously with Horizons' pre-order ($45 inc discount), and was available for around a month IIRC.  The high price was justified as to not disrespect the early backers, but still offer ""ok"" value (Horizons inc Beta was $60 inc discount) to the fans who wanted to own all expansions and simultaneously support future development.

* ED Season 3 (if that model is how they continue, rumours of individual DLC expansions) released &amp; updated via 3.1, with 3.x in development &amp; scheduled; features currently unknown (only MultiCrew and Character Creator are announced, for 2.3).",2016-11-06 20:09:41+00:00,d9ojp7e,3.0,t1_d9ohg9v,2893.0,starcitizen

&gt; So developing a different game with cash supposed to go into the other game provides benefits

Same engine (Cobra).  Also the same cross-dev process as we see with SC, Sq42, AC &amp; SM.

We won't see the cross-dev benefits from Planet Safari until a much later season, when alien creatures are added to the game.

The detail of AI, number of NPCs, world generation (total number of assets), scripts, etc, are all limited by the CPU power and RAM available.

323,"Any factory-overclocked GeForce (that supports Boost) can have the issue, where the GPU's firmware isn't configured correctly for the overclock.  Nvidia's Boost tech dynamically adjusts the GPU &amp; Mem clock speeds based on demand (i.e. from black space that doesn't stress, to explosion pyrotechnics that can), but breaks when up/down-clocking to/from overclocked configs.

Top-end brands like Asus and Gigabyte very rarely show the same issue.

Enabling KBoost via MSI's Afterburner app is the simplest way to overcome the problem, and is easy to test.

It's also worth checking for a [firmware update](https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios); newer firmware revisions will correct whatever bugs the manufacturer found with the original.

The soft player limit for instances in the Human Bubble of space is 32 (not 24) as defined by Frontier back in early 2014, and has been greatly exceeded by large groups of players out exploring the Milky Way, seen in many gifs and videos.

From [today's AMA, here's David Braben's comments](/r/EliteDangerous/comments/599rwj/ask_him_anything_david_braben_obe_fdev_ceo/d96tdby/) on it:

&gt; We don't have a hard player limit, but a soft limit based on various network quality stats, as this will naturally improve as network infrastructure gets better. We are continually tuning and tweaking how the system works.

&gt; There are many elements other than players that affect the system, like the presence of NPCs (which also have to be present and synced on all machines), and keeping room for these, which apply less far from human space - hence the bigger numbers achieved there.

&gt; There have been continual subtle bug fixes going in, so please do report unusual behaviours.

Most other MMOs use fully server-authoritative networking, which introduces a small-but-noticable response lag when a player takes an action.  Frontier chose a hybrid server &amp; P2P networking for faster twitch gameplay responses between players in battles and co-op.",2016-10-25 15:32:56+00:00,d974iaz,9.0,t1_d973ok0,1045.0,Games

&gt; The main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.

&gt; Really big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to £80 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.

The early backers who pledged high enough get all expansions free, exactly as Frontier said.

&gt; Greetings Commanders,

&gt; We hope you’re geared up and ready for ship-launched fighters, the Beluga liner, VIPs, passengers, alien archaeology, volcanism, and much more, because The Guardians and Elite Dangerous 1.7 updates will be blasting out of the Frontier Developments’ fighter bay on **Tuesday October 25**.

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/CbiGG05.png

&gt; The Guardians: Elite Dangerous

&gt; If you own Elite Dangerous: Horizons, or the Commander Deluxe Edition, in less than a week you’ll be able to download the 2.2 update and hire fighter pilots to assist you in combat situations, build smaller ship-launched fighters in your larger vessel and send them in to battle and pilot and carry passengers in the beautiful and vast Beluga liner to new and exciting tourist destinations.

&gt; Game-changing improvements for every Elite Dangerous Commander coming in 1.7

&gt; In addition to the amazing headline features in The Guardians there is also a huge host of changes and additions coming free of additional charge to all players of the main Elite Dangerous game too! They enhance every aspect of the Elite Dangerous experience.

&gt; Navigate your way across the galaxy map with increased ease using the navigation filters, take in the new, detailed and beautiful starport interiors, ferry passengers to the most amazing locations in the galaxy, store modules for more flexible use between ships, transfer your vessels making you ready for any occasion or visit Interstellar Factors – a shady group of contacts who will allow you to pay off your fines or collect combat bounties no matter where you are in the galaxy.

&gt; There’s so much to discover in both the Elite Dangerous 1.7 and The Guardians updates, but you’ll have to uncover some of the mysteries yourselves.

&gt; If you haven’t picked up the Elite Dangerous: Horizons seasons of expansions yet, you can take advantage of these game-changing features by visiting our [store](https://www.frontierstore.net/games/elite-dangerous-cat.html), or purchasing Horizons through [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/359320).

&gt; Hello Commanders!

&gt; There have been a number of threads and posts about the status of exploration scanning in the beta, including the detailed surface scanner module. This post is just to let folk know our thinking - I'm posting it here for maximum visibility.

&gt; For reference: currently in the beta, when entering a new system, you can use the basic discovery scanner to discover stellar bodies (up to the range of the scanner).

&gt; Discovered bodies will show in the system map as graphical representations, but in the planet map they will show as grid spheres. 

&gt; You can perform a basic surface scan to learn details about the body and replace the grid sphere with a visual representation of the body’s surface.

&gt; Some folk have suggested that they would prefer to have the surface of a body revealed in the planet map by the initial basic exploration scan, as that detail can inform them whether they wish to investigate the body further. This is a reasonable suggestion.

&gt; Other folk have suggested that bodies discovered by a basic scan should remain as blank spheres in the system map until they have received the attention of a detailed surface scan, as the mystery would entice further investigation. This is also a reasonable suggestion.

&gt; And yet other folk think the current system is good to go and this is also clearly reasonable. 

&gt; So it’s fair to say there are some different opinion on this matter .

&gt; Whilst we can’t supply guarantees or ETAs, we just want to make clear that the current implementation does not necessarily represent the finished version of exploration scanning (or exploration in general, just the version that will go out with 2.2 The Guardians.

&gt; So please feel free to make suggestions for improvements (in this thread would be a good place to pop them) and to let us know what you think of the current implementation.",2016-10-21 11:47:11+00:00,d91mhc7,1.0,t3_58mpz2,970.0,EliteDangerous

[Two months ago at Gamescom, stated by Chris Roberts in the Q&amp;A](http://imperialnews.network/2016/08/gamescom-day-4-coverage/):

&gt; * Quantum travel is at 0.2c so the systems are scaled down for fun reasons – the tech can handle 1:1 scale but the travel times become too long.
&gt; * Systems are 1:10 distance between planets because it felt right about time investment with travelling.
&gt; * Planets are 1:4 or 1:6 for the same reason – time to travel and get down from orbit.

You're still correct here though: the performance is tied to 2.x' shoddy networking *telling* the client computer what to load-in from storage (e.g SSD).  As more players join your shared server in Crusader, the networking bottlenecks, starving the load-in queues (amongst a lot of other processes).

&gt; As you know, November 26, 2013 marks the end of Lifetime Insurance (“LTI”) availability for Original and Veteran backers. We made lower-cost LTI packages available as a reward for the group of backers who made Star Citizen possible in the initial campaign, which culminated with the close of a grace period on November 26, 2012.

&gt; Q: Why don’t you offer LTI on the base ships for New backers?

&gt; We promised that our early backers would get the benefit of LTI over later backers. On the other hand there are almost twice as many new backers as early backers and some of them are upset that they didn’t have the opportunity to obtain LTI by backing early. Offering LTI on the limited ships at a higher priced for New backers seems the best compromise. We feel that if we extended this to the standard ships it would be too much, but our early backers would be ok with the New backers having the opportunity to obtain LTI (at a slightly higher price) on the more expensive and rarer ships as it gives them a nice benefit and helps make the game better by raising more funds.",2016-10-18 20:54:20+00:00,d8xshw8,2.0,t1_d8xqx87,1767.0,starcitizen

&gt; The bug fix is expected to go live in our next point release which is planned for the end of this week/early next week but we’ll have more news on the exact time in the normal patch notes forum.

I would just like to take this opportunity to clarify a few misconceptions. The AI has in no way been reduced, it remains the glorious, improved version from the update. The only action that we’ve taken so far has been to remove the engineer weapons to allow us to investigate the issue and address a key bug. Once this bug fix goes live we’ll be able to see how the AI is performing and then, over time, should we feel that the balancing is right to introduce a very select few high end engineers weapons to the highest ranked NPCs we will investigate that option. However, that won’t be immediately as we want to ensure that the balance is just right.

&gt; I have been checking out the new AI in the game and although I can understand that some people believe it is too difficult I would really like to apeal to FD to take it easy whn it comes to nerfing it. Before this update the game was far too easy. Enemies often did not even shoot back at you. They often flew without shields. It was common for a player to encounter three ships at once and kill them all without them barely shooting back.

&gt; The AI now is lethal. Sure, it needs to be reduced a little **but not nearly as much as people say.** When I encounter two or three enemies I should get my behind kicked. That is realistic. That is what wings are for.

&gt; **People moan on this forum that there is no reason for players to play together. FD has given it to you. The AI should not be piloted by monkeys as it has in the past.** It is clear to me that this AI has been written to make launched fighters viable and important. I understand that there may be cases that the AI is way too overpowered but for the first time since this game launched, the combat is at last a challenge.

For realism's sake, obtaining pictures of something is easier than obtaining other surface details.

I know Brett introduced a new rule stopping zero-day accounts from posting in the ED off-topic forums, because of toxic, non-ED fans circumventing bans.

From what I saw in the tech demo footage CIG have created two custom planets, with 20 sq.km of custom scripted content providing ~10min of gameplay, none of which is playable by gamers. As announced, the dual authored/procedural planetary tech v2 won't be in 3.0 (it'll have v1), an update that itself is expected to be released to the Public Test Universe* sometime in 2017.  The tech demo is graphically very pretty.  As 3.1 through 3.4 arrive, more of Stanton's content should arrive.  Only by 4.0 will other Star Systems be added.

Meanwhile, the number of features, content, improvements and bug fixes added in 1.7/2.2 is orders of magnitude higher that what CIG have added to the PU in the past 9 months via 2.1 through 2.5.

If anything, it is CIG's development pace that has been severely lacking, e.g. Star Marine, Squadron 42 Ep1.  Squadron 42 ""Prelude"" (a few missions) is expected ""early"" 2017, while Ep1 now assumed to be late 2017.

* Star Citizen = 2016

659,"&gt; gives you dlc for the entire development cycle of the game

I would agree - wherein development cycles of said games lasted 1-2 years.  Not 6+ in this case.  Hence the availability of the Lifetime Expansion Pass (also a well known concept) being available for the first 20 months of development.

&gt; The definition of the word season as webster is concerned is not what I'm discussing.

I've noticed, else its meaning of ""three months"" would disprove your discussion immediately. Therefore, ""a season"" is ""as long as you want it to be"" wouldn't you say?

&gt; Calling it a ""Horizons season pass"" implies that there is going to be additional DLC released beyond the base ""horizons"" that the pass covers. That's not the case.

Why?  Horizons Season Pass implicitly states to anyone that it is ""A Pass For The Season of Horizons"", otherwise it'd be called either ""Horizons And Onwards Season Pass"" or ""Lifetime Expansion Pass"".  Furthermore, what the store page has clearly said would be included in the Horizons purchase, from day one:

&gt; 2.0 – Planetary Landings   
&gt; Available Now   
&gt; A whole new angle on the galaxy. Journey from the stars to the surfaces of strange worlds, and hit the ground running in the new Scarab Surface Recon Vehicle. 

&gt; 2.1 – The Engineers   
&gt; Coming Soon  
&gt; Introducing an all-new mission system and game-changing loot. Craft exotic weapons and modules for your spacecraft and build a ship unlike any other. 

&gt; 2.2 – The Guardians   
&gt; Still To Come   
&gt; Take what comes and strike back with double. Bring a second ship to every combat encounter with Ship-Launched Fighters. 

&gt; 2.3 – The Commanders   
&gt; Still To Come   
&gt; Team up and take on the galaxy. Forge your own identity with the new Commander Creator, then share your bridge with Multi-Crew and fly with friends. 

&gt; 2.4 – ????   
&gt; Still To Come   
&gt; A secret revealed in Elite Dangerous: Horizons’ final expansion.

***

&gt; Were it the case I could buy standalone horizons at a discount and elect to skip the following dlc's, which in this case are just updates.

Are you talking about buying just ""Planetary Landings""?  That's not an option, never has been, and was never offered.

Secondly, why?  If someone didn't want Horizons at $45, they could have waited.  This past weekend it was discounted to $20.",2016-10-04 22:45:02+00:00,d8e7hb5,5.0,t1_d8e6fbd,1493.0,EliteDangerous

Allow me:

* Season pass = access to updates released during that season.
* Lifetime Expansion Pass = access to all updates released from now until the end of time.

&gt; I was under no impression when I picked this up in early access that I'd essentially be buying the game again several times over as they added new content to it.

Where have you been given that incorrect information?

&gt; So buying DLC for **a game that has drastically changed every time I log in** seems counter intuitive to me.

Yeah, how dare the developers continually update and improve the basegame for free too!

&gt; Never mind the content contained in these DLC packs, so far most of which I assumed was eventually going to be added to the base game.

Assumption is the mother of all fuckups.

&gt; My primary issue is calling them season passes and then saying ""LOL there's gonna be like 6 seasons.""

So: a pass for each season is self explanatory.

* These objects can be manually flown between, without SuperCruise, but [it takes a bloody long time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7E0DEp5yI).  This is only possible *because* the objects are persistent in the ""large world map"".
* All star system objects are fully physically modeled with the correct orbital mechanics.  [This superb video shows timelapsed mechanics at play in both SuperCruise and normal flight/driving (recorded on Xbox)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwte6iXCQ8).
* Of the 10k authored systems in the Human bubble, and 400 billion prog-gen'd systems, some have had orbital mechanic bugs.  While most have been fixed once reported, [Mitterand Hollow has stayed as a novel tourist destination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVgeRWMQ8c0).
* Unknown Signal Sources, and planetary Points Of Interest are not persistent; they're ""randomly"" generated on the fly determined by the current ""state"" of the Star System itself (e.g. a system in Civil War will have more small battle related USS').
* While the locations of Asteroid belts/rings are persistent, their objects aren't, and are generated procedurally during the forced instance transition (e.g. dropping from SuperCruise into a belt).  If you manually fly from one planet to another ringed-one outside of SuperCruise, the asteroid objects (currently) won't generate correctly - this is a known ""bug"" that FDev have set a low priority to fix.
* Instances are bubbles around players, not objects (e.g. a planet) on a map.
* During a forced instance-transition (e.g. entering SuperCruise) the client contacts the server for P2P instance matchmaking, hence transition delays in popular areas (e.g. around a Community Goal station) while in Open/Group play.  In Solo the transitions are under a second - no matchmaking required.

724,"/u/Lorien_Silmaril would be correct.  As Reddit sitewide bans are handled by Reddit admin, and cannot be circumvented by subreddit moderators, Derek posting here means his sitewide ban has expired, and was temporary.

The mods have little choice but to allow Derek to post in the public subreddit *named after him*, and created for the purpose of archiving and discussing his activities. While they have an option of banning it is unlikely Reddit admin will see that as anything but subreddit harassment and censorship - assuming Derek doesn't break any temp/perma ban-worthy Reddit rules of course. I expect infringing comments will be removed, pending edits to abide by the rules and be re-approved, as subreddit bans can be reversed by Reddit admin if they deem it necessary.

Sitewide permabans are dished out by Admin following repeated rule-breaches if they feel the sitewide temp'ban punishments were ineffective.",2016-09-27 14:21:00+00:00,d8443js,5.0,t1_d840arc,6562.0,DerekSmart

774,"&gt; Strange Kotaku didn't mention that.

They did:

&gt; When Chris returned from Gamescom in August, 2013, fresh off the release of the Hangar module and buoyed by new backer funds, he asked Erin to found and lead a UK studio focused on making Squadron 42, Star Citizen’s single-player campaign. Erin agreed, handed in his notice, and by December he and a few ex-members of his core team at TT Fusion set up a small office in Erin’s house. By January 2014 they had moved into offices in Wilmslow and rapidly started to grow.

&gt; It quickly became clear that England had advantages over Austin and LA. It was cheaper to hire staff who were no less qualified. Today the studio has more than 180 staff, but the first 30 or so largely came from Erin’s previous studio. This was a core group of developers who had all worked together before and had an established way of doing things.

&gt; This efficiency created its own problems, however.

&gt; “It started to become clear that deadlines weren't going to get hit in other studios,” a source at the Manchester studio told me. “For example, the multiplayer demo at PAX East in 2014. If you remember the live stream… any CIG livestreams were just horrible, but that first major livestream was to show off multiplayer and it just didn't work at all. That was because [the LA team] didn't hit the deadline for multiplayer. They were still patching the game on the show floor ten minutes before they were going to show it; of course it didn’t work.

&gt; “When it became clear certain deadlines weren't going to be met, [the other studios] would sort of borrow a couple of our employees for a few weeks. A couple of employees became a couple more for a few more weeks, and a few more, and it started to accrue.”

Kotaku clearly describe how the UK studio quickly became the most efficient and reliable studio, due to their established initial ~30 dev team led &amp; managed by Erin (all ex TT Fusion).",2016-09-23 15:34:52+00:00,d7yyimv,4.0,t1_d7yxvx9,806.0,starcitizen
775,"[RockPaperShotgun say it best in their summary here](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/23/star-citizen-interviews-inside-development/):

&gt; To briefly (and crudely) summarise, it sounds like Star Citizen has struggled from being overscoped, from building upon the rarely-used CryEngine then struggling to find people experienced with it while needing to replace a lot of the engine’s guts, from having too many studios and not communicating well between them, from trying to make all parts at once rather than starting small, from shuffling people around as priorities changed, from poor planning, from trying to add more and more, from bottlenecks of technology and staffing, and from Roberts being too involved in too many ways on too many levels.

I think that most if not all of those issues have now been resolved/surpassed. For over a year now Chris has had the confidence to delegate responsibilities to ""new"" (relative to the 2011 dev start) arrivals Sean &amp; Brian, alongside established leaders Erin &amp; Tony, and this core team have helped bring the overall project - and Chris to a certain extent - under control.

While SC &amp; Sq42 (Ep 1-3) will arrive much later than announced/planned (2015/2016), and possibly missing promised features on initial release, they will be fun games definitely worth playing.  Brilliant games?  Time will tell.",2016-09-23 15:26:37+00:00,d7yy4nt,3.0,t1_d7yvssa,3051.0,starcitizen

[Chris Roberts interview, October 2012](https://www.themittani.com/features/exclusive-interview-star-citizens-chris-roberts):

&gt; Basically I’ve been working with a small team over the course of **the past year** to get the early prototyping and production done. The team has varied in scale from just me, essentially, to about 10 people. That’s just the actual work though.

&gt; We’re already one year in

The OP-linked Kotaku article:

&gt; Roberts set up his studio virtually and, besides a few freelancers, delegated a lot of the grunt work to third-party contractors who already had established teams of developers. He contacted Sergio Rosas, Roberts’ art director back in the 1990s, who now ran an outsourcing company called CGBot in Austin, Texas. He also hired a studio called Behaviour to create assets for the prototype.

&gt; As this small team started to work on the prototype, the project attracted the attention of a couple of people working over at Crytek, the game engine’s developer. Sean Tracey, Paul Reindell and Hannes Appell were all fans of the Wing Commander games and lent a hand where they could. Appell, for instance, who is now director of cinematics on Star Citizen, created videos to show off the prototype to investors using the assets that were created by Behaviour and CGBot.

&gt; Even as a prototype, Star Citizen was a global game. Chris, working out of LA, was joined by developers in San Francisco, Austin, Montreal, and Mexico (with a little help from Crytek out in Frankfurt).",2016-09-23 14:16:28+00:00,d7yuz12,2.0,t1_d7yuaue,999.0,Games

808,"Copy pasta:

&gt; Hey everyone,


&gt; On Saturday September 24th we are looking to gather a group of CQC players with beta access to test the 2.2 build of CQC.


&gt; The major goal of the exercise is to avoid the situation that occurred with 2.1, where CQC launched with major game breaking bugs because they were not caught in beta. Remember those super overpowered heat beams that took two months to fix? How about that problem that is still the bane of our collective existences where bugged lobbies leave us waiting to start a match even with a full room? If only we had caught those things in the 2.1 beta!


&gt; Well, now the 2.2 beta is here, and the hope is that we can give the CQC module a good going over this Saturday, and identify any major bugs that may need fixing before 2.2 rolls out to everyone.


&gt; Of course, until bots are added [hint hint Fdev], we can’t play CQC by ourselves, so this is where we need your help. If you have beta access and want to help us test, please let us know below and come join us this Saturday.


&gt; We will start at 12 pm EST/ 5pm BST on Saturday September 24th. At the moment, we are looking at making it a two hour session, but we will see how it goes. If we’re having fun, we may just keep playing.


&gt; We will use discord to stay in touch and coordinate while we play. Here is the link to the server: https://discord.gg/JCMShJg


&gt; Testing deathmatch will require a minimum of 4 players, while testing team deathmatch will require a minimum of 6. The bigger the group the better however, so we hope that you can join us! At the very least it will be fun, and we will be saving ourselves a heap of annoyance and frustration in the future if we help start 2.2 with a clean, smoothly working build of CQC!

&gt; ###How to participate:

&gt; * On Saturday September 24th at 12 pm EST/ 5pm BST join the discord (https://discord.gg/JCMShJg) for coordination information and chat, and log into CQC (Arena) on the beta build!

&gt; * Post any bugs that you may find here:https://forums.frontier.co.uk/forumd...ac-Bug-Reports and then post the link to the bug into this thread, so that we know what has already been logged and we don’t waste time repeating the same bugs.

&gt; * Have fun!

&gt; ###Helpful info:

&gt; Bug reporting guidelines: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/211968-Bug-Reporting-Guidelines-and-Template


&gt; ###TLDR:

&gt; * What: Beta Testing the 2.2 build of CQC
&gt; * When: Saturday September 24th, 12 pm EST/ 5pm BST
&gt; * Where: 2.2 Beta CQC module and on discord here: https://discord.gg/JCMShJg
&gt; * Why: Because we do not want to start 2.2 with CQC badly bugged (I’m looking at you 2.1)!",2016-09-22 14:29:42+00:00,d7xh0fw,1.0,t3_53yxn2,3657.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; * Balancing for heat attack weapons (Retributor, Thermal Shock and a few others), overall intention is to keep single weapons having a purpose, while reducing the power of heavy stacking:
&gt; - Having an active shield now statically prevents 25% of the heat from getting through
&gt; - Adjusted the diminishing returns curve, getting someone to 100% is easier, getting them past 100% is harder, getting them into hull damage is MUCH harder, and the final cap is now 220% rather than 300%

958,"&gt; Why even call the other ship then, if your current ship is capable?

I said ""one or more ships"".  Changing home system perhaps?  Joining a trade CG but knowing you'd like to do some combat and/or mining after multiple trade-runs?

&gt; not all of us have 12 hours a day to play this game like I'm sure you do.

I have on average 16hr of total gaming time a week, of which I use around half playing ED.  Work, family &amp; social life take up the rest :)

&gt; a mod of the Elite Dangerous sub is criticizing people for not playing the game their way

Mod-Me didn't criticize you, Personal-Me did; Mod-Me is impartial.  And Personal-Me finds it amusing some gamers play for ""efficient"" instead of fun; do they get frustrated when their current fun activity is only 80% as profitable/efficient as a less fun activity? Is the most efficient way the only fun way?  Fun is subjective, but surely ""the ~~optical~~ optimal *(e: whoops!)* way"" feels like a chore? My gaming time is limited so I find fun things to do and play - why doesn't everyone else?  Aren't real-life goals and tasks rewarding enough for gaming to be about playing like it is for me?

I find missions fun, but then I haven't done thousands of them.  I assume any activity is boring after so many repetitions, despite any developers' attempts at variation. 20+ mission types can only go so far, until more are added.

No worries, but I won't wait while one or more Ship Transfers occur, because I'll be having fun doing whatever in-game takes my fancy at that time.  Heck, I'll probably not even collect my ship(s) for an hour or two *after* they arrive.

Of course, if someone doesn't actually enjoy playing the game, there is very little to say until whatever content they want is added.  Thankfully we don't have to restrict ourselves to one game only :)

As to going somewhere in the bubble to do what they want, why wouldn't they go there in the ship designed for the task?  Or buy a new temporary ship that does the job good while their ship-that-does-the-job-best arrives?

Simply put, Ship Transfer is not for the job of ""buy Taxi Hauler and jump 300LY away, call for my big slow ship"".

971,"Secondly, from the [original Poll Thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=286967):

&gt; Hello Commanders!

&gt; We’ve had a big response from you folk about 2.2 regarding ship transfer, so first things first, thanks for all of the feedback! It’s always extremely useful, and helps us make more informed decisions. It can also sometimes kick start or reignite discussions, by effectively bringing new evidence into circulation, allowing us to re-examine issues with a broader perspective.

&gt; We’re very happy and excited to be bringing ship transfer into Elite: Dangerous, as we feel that it offers dramatic improvements to game play, by allowing Commanders more freedom to have the right tools (ships) at the right place. However, there’s clearly a lot of folk that are not so happy about our choice of implementation: specifically the concept that your ships can be summoned to your current starport instantly. Whilst most folk seem to be on board with the idea of transporting ships to your location, the time transfer takes has raised some concerns.

&gt; Clearly, the benefit of instant transfer is that, assuming you have the credit funds, you always have the appropriate ship to hand at all times. I will summarise for reference the main concerns that have been raised about having instant ship transfer:

&gt; * Instant transfer is likely to have a less plausible/desirable explanation for how the feature works in game lore.
&gt; * Instant transfer will lessen the need to have decent frame shift drives in ships other than one, “main” explorer type vessel. 
&gt; * Instant ship transfer will remove any potential game play from deciding when/if transfer should be initiated.
&gt; * Instant ship transfer undermines the scale of the galaxy.

&gt; These are interesting arguments that have got us talking about this feature in the office once more. After much debate, we are coming around to the idea of having a delivery time for transferred ships. It also follows, that if we have delivery times for ship transfer, we should have them for module transfer as well, as both actions use the same concept. But before we go ahead with this, we want to take a final reading, as it were.

&gt; So we’re going to run a simple, official poll. I know that there’s already been one, which has had lots of responses; think of this as a final safety alert. As with all polls, it would take a significant majority of a large voting base for us to take the results as anything more than interesting anecdotal evidence, so I’d like to stress that if you have a strong opinion on this issue, please vote, and tell your Elite playing buddies to vote as well.

&gt; We’ll run the poll until Monday next week. *Unless there is a significant, majority vote against ship transfer delivery times, along with a high turnout*, we will likely be moving towards implementing plausible delays into ship and module transfer, though such a change may affect when the features comes online.

&gt; I’ve tried to make the poll as straightforward as possible, with just two options, please take a moment to read through them before you vote. Basically, it comes down to instant travel versus delivery times. We’re not very interested in having minor delays just for the sake of appearances – if there’s to be a delay, it should try to be roughly appropriate to a bulk freighter’s ability: reasonably slow compared to an explorer type vessel, but able to reach any destination – eventually.

&gt; Note there will always be a credit cost component to ship transfer, though it will likely be lower if there is also a delivery time component. Also note that the delivery times used in the poll (5m minutes and 100 minutes) do not preclude further travel outside the human bubble, say to Jaques, with an appropriate increase in time.

&gt; Thank you for your participation!

&gt; The poll itself can be reached at this URL: https://www.elitedangerous.com/en/shiptransfer-vote/ 

&gt; For your convenience, the options in the poll are are shown below:

&gt; * POLL: Should transferring ships and modules to your location take time?
&gt;    1. No, the transfer should be instant.
&gt;    2. Yes there should be a delay of 5 minutes minimum, 100 minutes to cross the human bubble, edge to edge.

***

&gt; The delivery time would be a minimum of around five minutes, representing basic logistics of getting your ship loaded into a bulk carrier, followed by an additional time cost per light year to be travelled. The ballpark we are looking at would mean a delay of around 100 minutes if you transfered a ship from one edge of human space to the other (around 300 light years).

***

&gt; There would be no chance of losing ships transported by bulk freighter. Cost (in either case) will be proportional to ship value and distance to be travelled. If we end up with a delivery time, the cost will be lower than if we have instant transfer.

***

&gt; Although we might impose limits, theoretically very long distances could be traversed by bulk freighters, so, yes, traveling to Jaques would be possible, with an extremely long delivery time.

***

&gt; For clarity: the reason we are looking at ballpark figures of 5 mins to 100 minutes is two reasons:

&gt; * There's an amount of basic logistics in getting a ship booked and loaded onto a bulk freighter, hence a minimum 5 minute delay.
&gt; * We will use a X seconds per light year formula to simulate the speed of a bulk freighter.

***

&gt; The idea is that the delivery time can tick down regardless of whether you are playing the game or not.

***

&gt; We are talking about the ability to have a ship stored at a distant location transported to your current location. The same for stored modules.  At no point are you (the Commander) able to fast travel - you must always manually fly a ship.

***

&gt; In general, the ability to fly back and pick up a ship has a few issues: that you are doing the journey twice (even if the first journey is in a faster ship) and that you are forced to leave a ship at the pick up location. In addition, your time is completely filled by the logistics task. The ability to have ships delivered, even at non-optimal jump rates, is arguably better.

&gt; Secondly, just because we currently don't have bulk freighters in the game does not mean that we won't have things like this in the future (regardless of whether we have timed or instant ship deliveries) or even that they don't exist in the lore already (I believe the concept of mega freighters has always existed in Elite lore in some way). 

&gt; And although we may finesse the final times to be a little faster or slower, the concept is that these freighters are built to be able to get everywhere, with minimal crew, but not amazingly quickly.

***

&gt; (Responding to a question about sending a ship from your current location to a remote destination) Personally I quite like it, but it's outside of the current remit for 2.2. *If* we end up with timed deliveries, it sounds like the kind of thing we could consider in the future (no ETA no guarantees! :) ).

***

&gt; A lot of folk have been asking about exact formulas for ship/module delivery times. The answer is that we'd have a minimum time (e.g. 5 minutes) and then extend this based on a ""seconds per light year"" formula, to approximate the kind of times a bulk freighter delivery system might result in. The example times I used for the poll represent the kind of times we're considering. It's possible that we might reduce them a little, but they'd likely be in that ball park, and I'd rather folk were shown the longest possible times for the poll to focus their mind on what the consequences could be.

&gt; And just to be clear, this is not ""design by committee"". It's a very useful way for us to take a snapshot of player sentiment a feature's details. As I stated in the initial post, we're leaning towards having a delay, but seeing that there are interesting pros and cons on both sides of the fence, we think a poll, in this instance, will provide us with useful information. The final decision, as usual, will be ours to make. Great though this poll and debate are turning out, I don't want to give the false impression that it's the ""new"" way of doing things. It just happens to be, in our opinion, a good thing to do at this time.

***

&gt; The feature ""ship transfer"" may come in a little hot, or delayed, based on decisions we make about how it's going to work.  The community is not to blame for this! It has just created an interesting question that means we might have to take more time over than we originally thought.

&gt; Also, about the idea to allow Commanders to action ship transfer to systems other than the one they are currently at (a ""push"" rather than a ""pull"" if you will): I have stated that I *personally* quite like the idea, at face value. However, we haven't looked at it closely yet. Clearly, it's a significant increase in scope (anyone who says otherwise is incorrect) and we'd have to have a serious think about potential ramifications. This does not mean we will never look at it. It simply means that we aren't going to look at it for the foreseeable future. It's certainly not ""the way we wished it worked"".",2016-09-12 23:14:52+00:00,d7k8na2,2.0,t1_d7k8jfj,157.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; * POLL: Should transferring ships and modules to your location take time?
&gt;     1. No, the transfer should be instant.
&gt;     2. Yes there should be a delay of 5 minutes minimum, 100 minutes to cross the human bubble, edge to edge. 

&gt; As I stated in the initial post, we were already leaning fairly strongly towards having delivery times, but we wanted to get a snapshot of player sentiment to help us with our final deliberations.

&gt; **39,902 people voted**, of which **38,045** have validated Elite Dangerous accounts. We’d like to thank you for your participation.

&gt; ###Seventy percent of the vote was in favour of having delivery times.

&gt; This result has helped us confirm our decision to move away from having instant ship transfer, which we arrived at after much internal discussion, helped in part by vigorous debate on our forums, Reddit, etc. 

&gt; It’s always great to be able to include feedback from you, the Commanders who play Elite: Dangerous, and we feel this has been a positive experience.

***

&gt; We're still pushing ahead to try and get ship transfer in for 2.2, we just don't want to guarantee it, just in case.  At a guess (i.e. not to taken as the ultimate fact) if it doesn't hit 2.2 beta, it would hopefully drop in before 2.3.

***

&gt; We'll be finessing the final times, which might end up being a little shorter (we wanted to be as extreme as possible in the poll to make the potential consequence as clear as possible), but it will likely be in the same ball park, as these times will represent bulk freighter transport, which is not fast.

***

&gt; *Q: Bulk Freighter NPC models?*  
&gt; No, sorry.  It's just how we rationalise the delivery times.  However, it would be cool to have visual representations of these in the future (no ETA, no guarantee).

***

&gt; Transporting ships to Jaques will definitely take a much longer period of time, given its great distance from the human bubble.

***

&gt; It's probably worth noting though that, regardless of how long the final delivery times are (they might get a little shorter than the numbers stated in the poll, but they probably won't be on the fast side), you won't have to swap ships (or buy endless amounts of Sidewinders) when retrieving a ship. 

&gt; In addition, ships with small jump ranges can be transported even if they could not make jump distances required for the journey.

***

&gt; We're looking to implement a ""sell ship remotely"" feature at the same time as we add the ship transfer feature, to allow Commanders to sell ships docked in distant systems.

976,"When lower than the Blue Zone, the throttle is telling the Distributor to supply less power to all thrusters - main and maneouvering - for more precise adjustments, e.g. during docking.

* Blue Zone = max power to man. thrusters, medium power to main thrusters.
* 100% throttle = max power to main thrusters, medium power to man. thrusters.
* 0% throttle = low power to man. thrusters, zero power to main thrusters.

All popular space dogfighting sims have arbitrary speed limits (ED, X, EVE:V, SC, XW/TF, FS, EM, etc) as with pure Newtonian the combat suffers (FE2, FFE, IB, off top of my head).

FA Off allows you to accelerate (from zero) in *all* directions faster than FA On. The power distributor has allocated power to all thrusters to allow for maximum maneouvering.

FA On allows you to decelerate faster *along the velocity vector*, as it's primary job is to counter Newton's Laws Of Motion (as I already said). The PD has allocated power to slow you down to a standstill, at the expense of maneouverability. Hence ""Flight Assist: On"".",2016-09-12 19:57:21+00:00,d7jzric,7.0,t1_d7jvvr5,4770.0,EliteDangerous
977,"&gt; “Blue zone” makes no sense in space

Less energy diverted to main forward engines, allows more energy to be used by the maneouvering thrusters; the Blue Zone is the optimum power setting for those thrusters.

&gt; FA off still doesn’t fly like a space ship would

In what way?  Except for the arbitrary speed limit (which most space games have), Newtonian physics applies.

&gt; You ignored that FA off has different acceleration/deceleration than FA on.

FA On continually uses thrusters to correct the ship's movements (i.e. counter Newton's laws of motion), using a proportion of available energy; FA Off does not, so the thrusters when activated have more energy available.",2016-09-12 18:29:59+00:00,d7jvi86,5.0,t1_d7juxnx,706.0,EliteDangerous

* 7 months ago - [""Do you believe Sq42 will be released in 2016?""](/r/starcitizen/comments/40fsop/do_you_really_believe_sq42_will_be_released_in/)
* 4 months ago - [""Could we actually get SQ42 in 2016?""](/r/starcitizen/comments/4ibv9f/could_we_actually_get_sq42_in_2016_this_line_in/)
* 3 months ago - [Huge discussion related to CIG meeting their date targets, and announcing delays](/r/starcitizen/comments/4lpkst/cig_wont_present_at_pc_gaming_show_after_all/)
* 3 months ago - [Devs commenting that AI is still being designed, ""leaking"" the delay, is dismissed by community](/r/starcitizen/comments/4ngsbs/sean_tracy_brian_chambers_indirectly_leak_that/)

In response to anyone asking ""when are the games coming out?"" they are readily replied ""Sq42 is scheduled for 2016"", which is unfortunately misleading if CIG know that they won't meet their end-of-year target.

Copy pasta:

&gt; The table below sets our every ship's official maximum cruising speed, boosting speed, pitch, roll and yaw stats. I have catalogued the data directly from in-game Outfitting using the best available unmodded thrusters and applicable minimum mass. The '+' signs denote Enhanced Thrusters, where available.

&gt; As per Outfitting, Speed and Boost are given in metres per second. Pitch, Roll &amp; Yaw are for degrees of motion per second (so 45.0 Pitch would mean that the ship would take 8.0 seconds to turn 360 degrees).

&gt; Hull is each ship's starting hull mass and Mass is the total tonnage that the ship (once outfitted, fuelled and laden) must not exceed in order to achieve its best flight model. Not all ships can achieve this minimum mass easily and some cannot at all without modding (see Notes, below).

&gt; ###Notes

&gt; This table was compiled in version 2.1.5.

&gt; The stats are taken directly from Outfitting and have not been 'flight verified.'

&gt; In each case I outfitted the ship with max size, A rank thrusters and reduced its mass to beneath the minimum, which provides the optimal flight model. Where applicable, I did the same for Enhanced thrusters.

&gt; This is a data catalogue, not a user guide! Some ships are impractical if not dangerous if outfitted to achieve the optimal flight model ... no liability is accepted for insured or insured losses incurred ...

&gt; I have however included each ship's hull mass. That gives an indicator of how achievable the optimal flight model might be. For example, a Python and an Orca will both achieve max speed / turn stats at or below 720 tons total mass. But the Python's hull starts at 350 tons, whereas the Orca's starts at 580 tons.

&gt; Some ships (e.g. the Viper III) cannot achieve their minimum mass without modding. Where this is so I record the mass actually achieved over the minimum, e.g. for the Viper III: 72.5 / 60.0, meaning I'm reporting the stats at 72.5 tons but the ideal would have been 60 tons.

&gt; Naturally, none of the stats above taken into account engineered mods - they are 'vanilla'.

&gt; Be aware that a key component of manoeuvrability is acceleration (in every plane). Outfitting does not provide stats for acceleration / deceleration either forwards and backwards or using lateral thrusters. These properties differ considerably from ship to ship and are very much a part of each ship's character. Some players have conducted valuable research into the same. One example is the table provided by Cmdr Cliffson here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/182465-Pitch-Roll-and-Acceleration-for-(nearly)-Every

&gt; If anyone wants to put the data above into a spreadsheet or similar and link, by all means carry on - post as a comment and I'll edit into the opener with grateful acknowledgment.

&gt; Finally, all comments and corrections are of course welcome as ever.

1221,"In the main campaign description titled ""Future Plans"" (bolded emphasis mine):

&gt; We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features. **A good example of this is planetary landings.** We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add **leaving the ships** so you can **explore space stations** or **board enemy vessels** or even just to **look around your own.**

&gt; The main reason for **treating these as expansions** is so we can approach these with the **proper development resources** that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.

&gt; Another avenue we intend to explore is other platforms, but for now the focus is very much on the Windows PC release. Only once the initial game is done will we start to look at other platforms.

&gt; **Really big expansions are likely to be paid for** while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to **£80 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.**",2016-08-30 15:37:19+00:00,d72p7en,3.0,t1_d72oomd,700.0,EliteDangerous

1226,"&gt; Sure, I might have had to pay additional money after purchasing the base game to get access to features that in a big, open space exploration-style game really should be baseline in the experience, like planets, and upgrading ships.

Planets are in the base game.  Space would be a bit empty without them.  Landing on planets was announced in the KS and throughout development to be arriving in a paid for expansion - this turned out to be the Horizons season.

Upgrading ships is included in the base game.  Horizons added the ability to modify upgrades.

The Cobra Mk4 wasn't a pre-order bonus.  It was a bonus for buying Horizons before 5th February - so a ""12 weeks after release"" bonus?  And as others have already stated, it's a low-end ship that isn't particularly effective.",2016-08-30 12:45:35+00:00,d72ig5f,1.0,t3_50aq2p,2990.0,EliteDangerous

1290,"&gt; none of this applies to shutting off the game, OR even just shutting off my computer. Let's say I pull the plug on my computer and shut all power down to my machine. Am I even using software at this point? No I am not.

&gt;  Unless Frontier defines ""cheating"" in the context of Elite: Dangerous, personal interpretation of the word is not legally binding.

These are very good points, and the latter applies equally to ""hacks"", ""mods"", etc.  Good lawyers could argue both sides, but FDev clarifying in the ToS would be better.  However, changing the ToS would open the door to refunds for those who don't wish to accept the new Terms, as the licence agreement (for playing online) was changing.

FDev's best option is changing the in-game rules regarding combat-logging, unauthorised exits, etc, and an appropriate in-game message:

&gt; ""Warning: Open Play has strict in-game credit penalties for disconnecting from the game servers, so please ensure your internet connection is stable.  If you are encountering difficulties, please play in Group or Solo mode.""",2016-08-28 17:01:48+00:00,d7047o9,6.0,t1_d703pyg,749.0,EliteDangerous
1291,"While the statement does end with that ""broad catch-all item description"" (for want of a better phrase), from a legal standpoint rule 3c technically reads as:

&gt; You are not permitted:

&gt; use...

&gt; * cheats
&gt; * OR automation software
&gt; * OR hacks
&gt; * OR mods
&gt; * OR any other unauthorized software  

&gt; ...designed to...

&gt; * modify
&gt; * OR defeat

&gt; ...the...

&gt; * purpose
&gt; * OR experience

&gt; ...of the Game

This is very common in contracts, to group together similar entities/restrictions within the same rule/enforcement.

&amp;nbsp;

Rule 3e is similar:

&gt; You are not permitted:

&gt; use any...

&gt; * robot,
&gt; * OR spider,
&gt; * OR scraper,
&gt; * OR other automated
&gt; * OR manual means

&gt; ...to access...

&gt; * the Game
&gt; * OR any Online Features

&gt; ...or copy any...

&gt; * content
&gt; * OR information

&gt; ...from the...

&gt; * Game
&gt; * OR any Online Features

We have seen many examples of game companies restricting/punishing cheaters/hackers/exploiters, even [banning multiple purchasers](http://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-cheaters-are-having-a-hard-time/), and likewise FDev should enforce a no-tolerance policy too.

It'd be amusing (and good publicity for the game) if someone chose to sue FDev (or any game company tbh) for ""restricting me to Group/Solo when I repeatedly cheated to avoid in-game activities in Open"", as the gaming media and community at large would side with FDev over cheaters.  If Magistrates ruled that refunds must be given to cheaters, then that'd set an unfortunate legal precedent that'd open a *huge can of worms*.",2016-08-28 16:32:41+00:00,d70330c,4.0,t1_d7026wh,1404.0,EliteDangerous

1295,"PvE is indeed FDev's focus.

Player-killing (by SDC, other groups and individual players) is indeed killing the Open Play game for players unaccustomed to games with unrestricted PvP.  The Mobius private group is very popular for this precise reason: lack of a PvE-only mode.

SDC's behaviour doesn't damage the game.  They create drama &amp; discussion, and also [publicity in the major gaming media](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-01-griefers-or-saviours-the-elite-dangerous-players-causing-a-rift-in-space).  When their victims move to Group or Solo mode, the overall game doesn't lose those players.  Same goes for PKers, which all unrestricted PvP games have.  Do some players quit after being killed?  Yes, just like in other games.

Indiscriminate PKing has definitely killed the Piracy role.  Proper Crime &amp; Punishment mechanics need to added.",2016-08-28 14:30:59+00:00,d6zysh9,10.0,t1_d6zy0p3,1512.0,EliteDangerous

1490,"I've personally been guessing 2H2017 for Sq42 Ep1, as CIG getting it released is critical to secure further development funding for SC.  Last night's impressive-looking demo will create a short-term spike in hype and purchases, but their costs are huge: 4 studios + outsourced studios + Imaginarium + Hollywood talent.  We already know that F42 UK alone burns through around $20m annually, and back in 2014 they had a total devteam-size of ~260 (employed and contractors).

Unfortunately, both Mass Effect ~~3~~ Andromeda and COD:IW are solid competitors to Sq42, and so the latter will be (unfairly?) compared to them, especially as they'll release first, have established engines and devteams behind them, and enormous marketing budgets.

Meanwhile, games like ED and Dual Universe are targeting the ""multicrew, first person, real people"" features in a released game sooner than SC's backer-estimated date.  This also doesn't count ""unknown"" games as it's normal for major publishers to announce upcoming games 6-9 months ahead of release - what if Bethesda perhaps have been dev'ing a similar space game since 2013?

What I am most amazed about here at Gamescom is simultaneously how much is being added with ED's 2.2 update, while FDev so far provide zero information on 2.3 onwards.  Season 3 now looks like to be arriving early-to-mid 2017, and 2.3 surely can't arrive before January 2017, with 2.2 arriving mid-October.  I still assume Season 3.0 will bring *both* SpaceLegs™ and AtmosLandings™, with 2.4 being the ""link"" (serious Alien threat?) between seasons.

1590,"&gt; Of course I think like that - I didn't back a VR centric game.

&gt; VR wasn't even a feature when I backed or they did their Kickstarter and they only briefly dabbled in it in the early years because they had a developer who built the code in his spare time to use it.

From the [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen/description):

&gt; **Virtual Reality is here!**

&gt; We have backed Oculus Rift and will support it in Star Citizen / Squadron 42. Who doesn't want to sit in their cockpit, hands on your joystick and throttle, swiveling your head, to track that enemy fighter that just blew by?

Rift support was [added to the hangar module in Feb 2014](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/13600-Hangar-Patch-111-Released) as part of the $12m stretch goal.  [VR then partially worked in Arena Commander following its release](http://www.pcgamer.com/star-citizen-interview-with-chris-roberts-at-e3-2014/) (off topic: at this time 268 internal/external devs working on SC/Sq42), but a later update broke the support. I no longer have my DK2 so I don't know if VR is still supported natively (without VorpX).

At SXSW 2015 Chris said [VR support would return with AC MultiCrew](https://youtu.be/t45Ls1otq1k?t=32m53s) as part of the CryEngine 3.7 codebase implementation/merge.

Chris in the end-of-2015 livestream said that [in early 2016 CIG would refocus on VR support](http://www.roadtovr.com/star-citizen-to-refocus-on-vr-support-in-early-2016/). ",2016-08-07 14:40:17+00:00,d67t4jx,5.0,t1_d67rtm9,2730.0,starcitizen
1591,"&gt; They asked the community, ""should we keep the kickstarter going and increase the scope of the game or should we just stop and make the game we originally talked about?"" The backers almost unanimously voted to keep going, knowing full well that it would add many years to the project, but result in a much better game.

This is not correct - historical revisionism. A vote was part of [Chairman's Letter $19 Million](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/13266-Letter-From-The-Chairman-19-Million) and asked:

&gt; ###What should we do with the crowdfunding counter after we reach our goal?

&gt; 1. Take the funds raised counter down after $23 million (mission achieved!) = 5%
&gt; 2. Have the funding counter display the amount towards the current stretch goal/feature, not the total amount once we reach $23M = 7%
&gt; 3. Keep it up through development and continue to offer stretch goal rewards in addition to extra features and development milestones = 88%

Only #3 asks ""continue to offer stretch goals"", but the question itself (and three answers) asks about the funding counter, not continued stretch goals.  Earlier in the letter CIG state that they **already plan to increase the scope**:

&gt; Some Citizens have asked if $21 million will mark the end of the funding campaign and the stretch goal unlocks. The answer is no

&gt; the more funds we can raise in the pre-launch phase, the more we can invest in additional content (more ships, characters etc.) and perhaps more importantly we can apply greater number of resources to the various tasks to ensure we deliver the full functionality **sooner rather than later**.

The [next letter](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/13284-Letter-From-The-Chairman-20-Million) even addressed concerns that scope creep would lead to delays:

&gt; There has been some concern about “feature creep” with the additional stretch goals. You should all know that we carefully consider the goals we announce.

&gt; But creating all the environments and assets to fill them is a huge task, so we were planning on not doing any planetside combat initially, simply because of its cost, with the idea that we would slowly roll it out once the game is live. But with the additional funds we can now afford to create some of this content **earlier rather than later**.

&gt; we don’t commit to adding features that would hold up the game’s ability to go “live” in a fully functional state.

After all the stretch goals were completed and the full scope established, [CIG released a timescale](http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2787306-1438681995-bafta.JPG) (Jan 2015).  We now know that only one of those milestones were reached: Persistent Universe Alpha.  Everything else is almost a year behind schedule.  There aren't Multi-Crew ships/battles in AC, ArcCorp (Social Module) is still in alpha (beta was described to be fully alive with interactive NPCs walking about their business), Star Marine is ""arriving in 2.6"", Squadron 42 Episode 1 ""in 2016"", and Star Citizen Commercial Release is years away.",2016-08-07 14:02:40+00:00,d67s15g,7.0,t1_d67a4f4,47036.0,EliteDangerous

The vast majority of the gaming media appears to think differently to that.

While there are indeed a few hundred very active SC fans promoting each news video and article on various Reddits, or comparing new games to it, that isn't an indication of the space sim or overall gaming communities.

Cheers for the interesting link, I've been having a quick read through while watching a film, but I can't see where what I say is wrong - any chance you can point me to the relevant page or appendices?

[This diagram](http://goflightmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/G-Axes-1.gif) from the link I provided summarises it very well - lateral G-forces are applied during yaw, and the body can withstand them the least.

Indeed the human spine can withstand G's perpendicular much better than parallel, but only in the forward/backward (main thrust) directions, not side/side (yaw), as I said.

Here's a fellow SC fan also explaining the practical issues, from their different perspective and experience background: https://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/144997/urgent-devs-have-fundamentally-misunderstood-yaw-g-forces-and-the-human-body",2016-08-06 01:46:33+00:00,d666vzk,11.0,t1_d665ooa,2105.0,EliteDangerous
1625,"&gt; Humans handle G's much better with Yaw than Pitch.

[This is false](http://goflightmedicine.com/pulling-gs/): the human body can withstand G-forces 1.5x to 2x higher in pitch compared to the cross-horizontal (yaw) axis.  We're most resistant to the forward-horizontal (main thrust) axis, upto 11x the yaw axis.  Rolling allows a pilot to ensure that the more G-forces are directed vertically on the body than *cross*-horizontally.

&gt; Sure, but it shouldn't fly like an airplane. There is no point for that. 

See above - taking the human body to its limits, in which it can withstand more in pitch than yaw.

Edit: added ""cross"" to the end of the first paragraph to be consistent with the former statements.",2016-08-05 23:42:42+00:00,d662fd4,9.0,t1_d655gs3,51262.0,EliteDangerous
1626,"&gt; No, I didn't. It was an example of the progress being made. I never said the one single video was evidence of the atmosphere being finished.

Nobody asked about ""finished"".  You stating ""they have all of it"" was incorrect.  They are *working on it*, and you provided an example of that.  Until we can play it, the game doesn't ""have that"".  Once it's in the PTU then that statement is true, otherwise we're in kind of a Star Marine or Squadron 42 situation (respective release dates of early and late 2015).

&gt; No, **they have it**, it is in the implementation stages.... I suggest you watch the video, because you clearly haven't. The atmospheric flight model is finished, and being tweaked.

Again, no they don't.  Exact quote from the video: ""we have **begun** implementation of the **first stage** of our atmospheric flight model"".  Perhaps you should re-watch it?  Meanwhile as above, until we can play it in-game, they don't have it.  Otherwise, we had Star Marine in April 2015.

&gt; These two situations are not comparable, **since one game is in development**

None of SC's trailers state that.  Furthermore, technically  both games are in development as FDev have no plan to finish with ED for 5+ years.

&gt; Elite's trailer is meant to show what is in the game, and set the pace for playing the game.

Which one, they have a few? Why is a trailer meant to, do all game trailers do that?  On the topic of ""meant to show what is in the game"", someone needs to tell Blizzard, Valve, CDProjectRed, id, etc, that their cinematic trailers should do that too.

&gt; SC's trailer is meant to show what is coming.

Trailers plural.  I don't recall seeing mentions of ""pledge for this concept idea now, not actual gameplay which is coming soon"" in them.",2016-08-05 23:21:48+00:00,d661n1h,12.0,t1_d65zzhk,2576.0,EliteDangerous

1628,"&gt; No they don't, because there hasn't been any persistance before 2.4 anyway. The game world simply being there doesn't equate to ""persistence"" lol. You think the ""PTU"" is called ""Persistent Test Universe""? That makes no sense.

[CIG haven't thought that since October last year](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/15043-Monthly-Studio-Report):

&gt; Todd has been working with everyone involved in the FPS part of the **2.0 Baby Persistent Universe release**, ensuring the quality of the FPS stays on par with what the backers are accustomed to seeing from Star Citizen.",2016-08-05 22:32:33+00:00,d65zqvr,12.0,t1_d65zdde,579.0,EliteDangerous
1629,"&gt; Then you alluded to their (possibly) far-off release date as a negative.

Most likely due to the [previously advertised release timetables](http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2787306-1438681995-bafta.JPG).

&gt; you're just being very dismissive of CIG's capabilities for no good reason.

No they weren't.  I cannot see anything in Meritz comments that even imply that. If anything, *you* made that assumption, especially with the previous (defensive?):

&gt; Look, you don't know enough about the SC development cycle to really talk about this.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; But now they're saying ""were about 70% there, it will be finished in 2-3 months""

Unfortunately, CIG have missed almost every one of their timescale projections, so there is no historical precedence to say that this one will be reached - a delay is most likely.",2016-08-05 22:28:11+00:00,d65zksk,12.0,t1_d65eoy2,27461.0,EliteDangerous

1631,"&gt; &gt; Meritz: And we get back to the beginning where I said that adding a shader or two does not equal atmospheric planets.

&gt; You: I never said it did.

Actually, you did:

&gt; &gt; Meritz: Also, ""atmospheric planets"" do not mean just planets with a fog shader thrown in. Where is the weather? Is the flight model different than in space due to friction and drag?

&gt; You: **They have all of that**, and already include realistic effects on the spacecraft flying through the atmosphere.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; &gt; The flight model must be different than in space, dependant on gravity, pressure and so on. Terrain must be different. Environmental effects such as pressure, enviro hazards, temperature etc. should be there.

&gt; There is a video of their interview, **and no gameplay video was shown,** but the summary was ""We're currently testing it"".

So, they don't have that, and it's somewhere in the implementation stages.

&gt; The working model they show where they can tweak atmospheric effects on the ship's flight model (going back to the difference between Earth and Venus) **is what I was talking about being finished.**

An internal tech-prototype demo isn't ""finished"" tech.  Neither are effects shaders that give the visible impression of atmosphere, as /u/Meritz stated.

&gt; If it is good, I hope its not another trailer, cause Frontier is really bad with their trailer/gameplay ratio.

Careful, as by that FDev's ratio of trailers to gameplay is bad, then you're consequently stating CIG's is worse (awful?).  SC's trailers over the past few years have shown ships and characters in scenarios and gameplay *still* not possible in the currently released modules.",2016-08-05 22:13:58+00:00,d65z0s9,10.0,t1_d65xn4y,2022.0,EliteDangerous

1636,"&gt; **Added??...** Lets not run before we can walk.

&gt; Lets start with fixing the basics

TBF I had to guess, as your OP gave no indication.

1. *Balancing the game*  
That's very vague...
2. *Crime and Punishment*  
There have been lots of excellent ideas posted about this - relating to the insurance cost of the destroyed vessel, combat rankings of the CMDRs involved, etc - and I'd like to see some of them added too.
3. *Making power play a thing that might create player interaction*  
PvP merits would be very welcome, and bonuses for earning merits in Open play.  Voting for expansions/exploiting is incoming as shown in the API leaks.
4. *Instancing*  
While the automatic UPNP still needs much improvements, manually setting Port Forwarding in your router, or simply buying a quality router, improves instancing massively.  Cheap/free routers aren't up to scratch.  A test in the launcher would be helpful for diagnosing UPNP/port issues.
5. *Combat Logging*  
Has to be resolved, with longer timers in Open Play, and banning based on gathering a CMDR's combat logging data for analytics.
6. *Making each career viable*  
This is vague too...  piracy is very much broken currently, so I'd like to see that resolved.  Exploration could use more rewards.
7. *Giving explorers things to actually explore*  
More POIs, USSs, stellar phenomena ideally.
8. *Dynamic trading*  
It's already dynamic.  If you're wanting dynamic on a small scale, i.e. affected by an individual CMDR's efforts that's unlikely, as FDev are focused on group-wide efforts which we already see in-game: BGS wars, trade routes becoming overused, etc.
9. *Engineer tasks based on skill not mining*  
Would be nice.

I assume this means Content Mods, approving/removing rule-infringing posts and comments? If so I'm happy to help.

1. Around a year. Reddit for over two years. Been following NMS's development since 2013.
2. Very rarely posted. I imagine a link to a gaming-media article but I'd have to check my post history (currently on mobile).
3. One of the main mods at /r/EliteDangerous, and generally well regarded by the CMDR community. Co-ordinate cross-promotional activities with the many smaller Elite-related subreddits. Obviously have experience with Reddit's modtools and removal reason templates.
4. No reason to.
5. 8, mostly on a factual basis. Opinions are only used in moderating when explaining rules and their application.
6. UK, so currently GMT+1.
7. I'm active on Reddit from 9am to 1am, and moderate where appropriate throughout.",2016-08-04 13:57:40+00:00,d63wioa,1.0,t3_4vxi7n,105689.0,NoMansSkyTheGame

Frontier's Community Manager Ed Lewis has done [somewhere in the region of 70 livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/user/FrontierDevelopments/videos), with around 20 ED dev guests taking part.  During these streams the devs answer questions from chat, with Update-focused streams taking questions from the forums and our subreddit too.  [Ed does a personal stream every weekday too](https://www.twitch.tv/edwardclewis/profile), from 12noon UTC.

We've also had [Dev AMAs on the ED subreddits](/r/EliteDangerous/wiki/ama), and the [devteam join in the discussion forums daily](https://twitter.com/ED_DevPosts), being especially active on patch/newsletter days.

We can only speculate, although I'm amazed they though MoCap data could be integrated in such a short timescale, game alpha &amp; beta tested, ready for late 2015 release.

It does appear Illfonic weren't synced with the changes (64bit, etc) being made to StarEngine at CIG, resulting in the issues then found during code merging.  We've seen the alpha-demo gameplay footage, played live at CitizenCon 2014 no less, and it certainly appeared that Illfonic did as CIG asked (make an FPS out of an FPS engine).  We won't know the complete details until any NDAs involved expire, but responsibility of that de-sync, partially-wasted contract work, and resultant delay lies with CIG.",2016-08-01 20:29:43+00:00,d602ziw,11.0,t1_d601qrw,1511.0,starcitizen

1693," SQ42 is part of the commercial launch. Coming out this year still, unless we hear otherwise. It was always part of the plan from the beginning.

Be real, that isn't what ""Fall 2015 - First episode of Squadron 42 released"" says.

&gt; What you're saying was also irrelevant, since what /u/Hironymus said happened long before the stretch goals stopped.

The above plan was shown at the BAFTAs in Jan 2015, after the stretch-goals ended in late 2014.  What Hironymus said...

&gt; They didn't promise any release date. They gave us an estimated release for the initially pitched product.

...was shown to be incorrect by that plan.",2016-08-01 19:55:20+00:00,d601a2d,9.0,t1_d5zzpj7,1915.0,starcitizen
1694,"&gt; 1) So they had a handful of systems (50 is still a handful of systems compared to 4.X billion) until a month before launch with little variation on those initial systems

A month before (16th Nov) launch (16th Dec) ED had 2400 Star Systems.  Two months before (16th Oct) had 500 Star Systems.  All fully modeled with most if not all [42 different planetary bodies](http://lavewiki.com/_media/lw01dg5.jpg).  Station variety was poor until the modular Orbis and Ocellus stations, and after release the modular Outposts.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 2) Still got nothing substantial about leaving the seat anytime soon.

Agreed - Frontier release information on upcoming features 3-6 months prior to their launch.  Hence we won't know what's arriving in Season 3 until Gamescom.

What we do know is that the Cobra engine is very flexible (used in practically all their games), and already capable of FPS mechanics (ala The Outsider before Codemasters killed it), while ships have had interior layouts drafted years ago.  We just have to wait and see.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 3) The point being Elite forces it's faithful to pay the cost of another game to get content

No it doesn't.  As shown with my price correction above, *at most* it is 75% at launch, if the opening feature is something the CMDR wants.  Many did/do not.  CMDRs can still play together in the areas they want to play together, and then buy in a later point - when the features they are interested in arrive at the value they perceive to be good (e.g. $20 or less).  The Engineer mods give a reasonable advantage in PvP, but not one that overrides superior piloting skill.  ED's primary target market is clearly not the ""$25 and get everything"" crowd - it's a space/flight sim that offers the most immersion (and fun!) when paired with HOTAS, TrackIR/VR, VoiceAttack, etc - but instead the enthusiast space sim'ers (!?) who are willing to splash out on tech that's also transferable to other games.

For those who enjoyed the game and were in for the long haul, the Lifetime pass was on sale again last Summer for $190, saving $300 as per your cost projection.  Whether it returns to the store this August is at this point unknown.

Frontier don't appear in any rush to promote to new gamers either, so if someone wants to buy ED when SpaceLegs™ (or whichever feature) is released (in whatever year) they can; they'd sold 1.7m units of ED/Horizons by the end of May.  Brett has said they're very happy with the regular playerbase size (70k via Steam, unknown via other platforms) and with Planet Coaster releasing late 2016 they're financially sound.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 3a) ""trust us, it's worth it even though we have nothing to really tell you right now beyond a few mechanics, it's super cool!""

As a substantial backer and promoter of SC/Sq42, I assume you can relate to established fans of a creator/company's track-record wanting to fund their/its development vision where possible, and trusting in their ability to deliver.  I jumped at the chance to buy the LTXP last Summer, after foolishly not buying it during development.  Some were rightfully angry when offline mode was canned and the barebones nature of the game's release - they should have delayed and released later with 1.1/1.2 included from the offset.  Combat Training is playable offline at least, and Solo only needs a 56k modem or tethered 2G Mobile.

$60 for both SC &amp; Sq42 are great value, if what is promised arrives.  I'm happy with my remaining KS backer account, after selling the others for considerable profits during the crazy valuations of 2014-15.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 4) We have seen Planetary Landings, they have show it to us many times over the course of the year, so there is no doubt that Star Citizen will have this in game by the end of the year. Never mentioned SQ 42 and the rest of what I said is already a part of the game.

As with Elite, I wait until SC features are confirmed/locked-in before becoming hyped (for want of a better word). Following repeated delays and loose promises (how the phrase ""weeks not months"" must now haunt CIG), with partial-reasoning only given months after the deadlines, I have become obviously skeptical that dates will be met.  Assuming CIG's funding stays solid we'll hopefully see an SC release late 2018 which I'm ok with.  Without a Sq42 trailer at the AMD-Sponsored PC Gaming Show at E3, no gameplay footage since the Morrow Tour, and MoCap still recording last fortnight, many are similarly skeptical of a 2016 release happening (even Q1 2017 looks improbable tbh).  While it's fair that visitors to CIG's studios have seen the assets in development (ships, stations, planets, etc), until they're successfully transferred from CryEditor to StarEngine, and appropriate game mechanics included, I won't see them as ready.  Same went for PLandings™ in ED during Ed's livestreams: ""ok, so we can drive around, now what?"" (which they later showed with bases and POIs).

&amp;nbsp;

As to using features as a ""weapon"", my first reply was to correct some of the incorrect information you had provided - ""handful"" of systems, and Season pricing - and add my thoughts on CIG's ability to keep to their own deadlines and promises.  Apologies if it came across as an attack, as that wasn't my intention.",2016-08-01 19:46:48+00:00,d600uj8,10.0,t1_d5zwhp3,5405.0,starcitizen

1699,"&gt; They didn't get beyond the handful of systems until a few weeks before release.

I'd like to correct you there:

* ED Alpha 4 (15th May 2014) had a handful of systems in a ~6ly³ area of space, and introduced trading and cargo mechanics.
* Premium Betas 1 &amp; 2 didn't change the ""bubble"" size.
* ED Open Beta 1 (29th July) increased bubble size to ~21ly³ containing 50 Star Systems.
* ED Open Beta 2 (1st Oct) increased bubble size to contain 500 Star Systems.
* ED Open Beta 3 (28th Oct) increased bubble size to contain 2400 Star Systems.
* ED Gamma (22nd Nov) opened up the full Milky Way.
* ED 1.0 (16th Dec) general release, with 15 unique flyable ships available - currently its 22 uniques (+2 in CQC) and 7 variants.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Elite has yet to release anything coming close to just getting out of your seat and walking around, let alone boarding or FPS mechanics.

Of course not, but then they haven't given a timescale yet - we'll likely find out at Gamescom as what to expect during Season 3.  Last Summer a substantial number of CMDRs didn't think Planetary Landings was coming that year, and we saw what happened there... we got Elite Dangerous socks!

The freedom that Vive gives allows a small amount of faked ""walking around"", and the spectacular VR is of course a welcome bonus, especially seeing the scale of the ships in-game ([non-VR demo of ship scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2LI6lbmkQw)).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; they charged $60 for the privilege and asked for faith that the rest of the updates would be worth the money

It was never $60 to existing ED owners: it was $45 (including sales taxes), for the Season of Horizons (2.0 to 2.4), and is currently $20 during Steam's VR sale.  It was originally $60 for new CMDRs, who got the basegame included for the extra $15.

As you're no doubt aware, from Kickstarter to the end of Premium Beta, the Lifetime Expansion Pass was available for purchase for $50 - with a clear statement that expansions would fund post-release development.  Assuming 2.2 to 2.4 follow the same timescale as 2.1, they are delayed from their original planned release (Summer to Winter respectively) by 6 weeks.

Note that Star Citizen's price of $45 doesn't include sales taxes, but that's only a small percentage extra in the appropriate territories.

As to Star Citizen and Squadron 42's upcoming schedule of content/mechanic releases, it's better to err on the side of caution as [we've been disappointed before](http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2787306-1438681995-bafta.JPG).",2016-08-01 13:42:40+00:00,d5zkcf9,8.0,t1_d5zhe9q,5810.0,starcitizen

1780,"###Copy pasta (updated):

Hello everyone,

We have an update coming for both Xbox and PC. Downtime is expected to start from 3PM BST (2pm UTC) and is expected to last around 60 minutes. 

Xbox update will be available for download from 3pm BST (2:00pm UTC) and will be 351MB. If this doesn’t automatically start, you may have to power cycle your Console by holding the power button for 10 seconds!

Let us know if you have any trouble with it. 

Edit - we're also increasing the length of the CG this week due to any downtime getting in the way of progress. More information on that in the community goals thread very soon.

- Various text fixes


Xbox One

- Updated New Logo and Idents
- Improvement to user settings when switching players

Render

- Make the render feature system more robust against GraphicsConfig.xml being broken

1794,"&gt; I just want a vast increase of acceleration, deceleration rate and travel speed in Super Cruise

I'd like the increased acc/dec option too, either through the OP's idea or optional alternative drives - e.g. Military FSDs (in the vein of previous Elite's Military Drives) that are more efficient but with downsides of hugely increased fuel costs and illegal waste products (Radioactives in FE2).  Top speed of 2001c is quick enough :D

&gt; quantum drive in Elite

Too slow at it's max speed of 0.2c.  It'd take 35 minutes to travel from Sol to Earth.  More prominent/spectacular graphical effects to Supercruise would be welcome though.

[Our subreddit's traffic stats](/r/EliteDangerous/about/traffic/) show different, and we gain new subscribers every day.

Regarding the playerbase, [average concurrent players per hour](http://steamcharts.com/app/359320) (only Steam stats are available) have decreased 20% since ED's release on Steam.  Those numbers are expected to rise again when 2.1.05/1.6.05 arrives - it's re-balancing Engineers modifications to make them much easier to obtain.

FDev definitely released ED too early (without Community Goals and Wings) but they were committed to their 2014 release promise, if later than the KS-estimate of April 2014.

This was part of our discussions with him regarding some PvPers who were banned for *very* tenuous infractions (most if not all forum mods are PvE-minded).  

While I agree that moderators should remain impartial when mod-posting, when ""mod-hat off"" (or non-distinguished comments here on Reddit) they are allowed their own opinions to expressed, even if controversial.

Wishing harm to another game is always controversial, and usually counter-productive.  From what I've seen in the ED forums SC thread is mostly piss-taking at SC's development and the devteam.  Posts from extreme users, pro and anti, often disappear (moderated), with regular modposts stating ""discuss the topic, not individuals posting the thread"" when users attack each other.

1897,"&gt; I see a mention of /u/Accelerwraith mentioning she works at a museum but doesn't give where she works.

From the [wiki on ""Doxing""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing):

&gt; Hackers and amateur detectives alike can harvest the information from the internet about individuals. There is no particular structure in place for doxing, meaning a hacker may seek out any kind of information related to the target.

&gt; It is important to note that a hacker may obtain an individual’s dox without making the information public.

The user stating the ""museum"" part effectively shows they doxxed.

&gt; That seems a little different

It is very different yes, but still deplorable and not excusable, as you rightly say ""Two wrongs don't make a right"" which I completely agree with.  Hence me saying he was an idiot.",2016-07-20 17:59:44+00:00,d5ju3fn,4.0,t1_d5jtfmv,834.0,DerekSmart

That's not legally correct.  If DS took ILCS to court over the public ""defamations"", ILCS would have to prove professional diagnosis (which they could not) and therefore most likely lose the case, as the onus is on ILCS to prove his published information was legitimate.

On a tangential topic: DS states many things that could be considered libelous, probably because - as he has repeatedly stated - he *wants* CIG/RSI to take him to court.",2016-07-20 17:50:24+00:00,d5jtnhh,4.0,t1_d5jtcmq,381.0,DerekSmart

~~They are [hiring more QA members](https://www.frontier.co.uk/jobs/cambridge_vacancies/qa_/) too  (thanks /u/42rael).~~

Meanwhile, since 2.1/1.6 (containing 1337 itemised improvements) was released on 26th May, three updates have followed:

* v2.1.02 &amp; v1.6.02 (25 itemised improvements) on 3rd Jun 
* v2.1.03 &amp; v1.6.03 (157 itemised improvements) on 22nd Jun
* v2.1.04 &amp; v1.6.04 (7 itemised improvements) on 1st Jul

See [Version History on the ED Wiki](http://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/Version_history) for a summary of every update, and links to the full, unfiltered changelogs.

The [next major update is expected soon](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/4pnmgp/the_engineers_21_feedback_and_planned_updates/d4mdiwh), either late July or early August, to resolve many of the issues with Engineers-related gameplay - and that doesn't exclude a minor bugfix update arriving sooner.",2016-07-19 13:27:45+00:00,d5i3ov0,1.0,t3_4tkjl5,9190.0,EliteDangerous

In full:

&gt; We wanted to reiterate some examples regarding the rules of Player harassment. **If a player has been blocked from a private group, or a group/individual has taken every step possible to remove a player from their gameplay, then attempting to circumvent this in any fashion is a serious offense and action will be taken accordingly.** Attempting to re-establish contact with an individual who has blocked a player through secondary accounts or other methods of attempting to evade the block are against the rules. Action can and will be taken against both the accounts in question and the main accounts of players that we deem to be harassing players through this method. 

&gt; In addition taking action such as seeking out and targeting specific players purely for the purpose of being disruptive, to cause offence, or to upset players within the community can also be considered harassment. **A perfect example of this is deliberately attempting to disrupt public livestreams such as the charity ones mentioned before.** This includes, but is not limited to, the capturing of footage and releasing it publically in an attempt to create upset or gain notoriety through the actions listed above. 

&gt; **We have previously stated, and it remains true, that Frontier are not able to manage group specific rules. Players considered to be breaking these group rule sets as established by group moderators should be removed from those groups by said moderators.** In addition, running a livestream in Open does invite the potential for players to approach and impact your gameplay and running a livestream in which you are declaring war on another group and they come and take action against you is reasonable and should be expected.

I have bolded the relevant sections.  The Federation CG supporting CMDRs were not part of a charity/event livestream, so are not covered by the second paragraph.  The first and third paragraphs count here: Mobius should kick the CMDR, who cannot then circumvent the kick.",2016-07-10 15:33:29+00:00,d56pzg6,9.0,t1_d56pmaq,666.0,EliteDangerous

You've unfortunately misinterpreted.

&gt; * Going into July '16: &lt; 3,000

Those are daily peak concurrent Steam players btw, and are a poor representation of the playerbase as they focus on peak times during the day (7pm-9pm UTC) and have spikes especially during key events (e.g. Horizons' release).  Consider this: if 500k CMDRs all login simultaneously for 5 minutes every month, yet don't play for the rest of each month, is the game successful as the ""peak concurrent"" stat would show?

The Steam players-per-fortnight is a more useful gauge of the overall Steam playerbase (data taken from publicly available archives of Steamspy):

* 23rd Apr: 60k (72k owners)
* 15th May: 53k
* 20th Jun: 77k
* 2nd Jul: 77k
* 16th Aug: 80k (277k owners)
* 11th Sep: 68k
* 11th Oct: 121k (386k owners)
* 13th Nov: 71k
* 18th Dec: 171k (record high - 617k owners)
* 21st Jan: 101k
* 20th Feb: 99k (730k owners)
* 31st Mar: 69k (2.0.08)
* 26th Apr: 74k (2.0.09)
* 27th May: 76k (2.1)
* 3rd Jun: 80k (2.1.02)
* 28th Jun: 65k (latest - 770k owners)

Although it also shows a downtrend, the fortnightly ""38% of December's peak"" is less dramatic than the oft-mentioned daily concurrent ""17% of December's peak"".

Meanwhile, the [average concurrent players](http://i.imgur.com/U2vnxe3.jpg) (abbreviation: ACP) is useful too (from Steamcharts), which clearly shows that the playerbase numbers have barely changed in the past six months.  Furthermore, the ACP during the past 6 months (Jan-Jun: 3249) is 76% of the ACP for the whole term prior to Horizons' release month (Apr-Nov: 4300).

&gt; The playerbase is halving almost every yearly quarter

As I've shown above, this is a false conclusion.

The game does need many improvements though, I agree with that.",2016-06-29 15:56:40+00:00,d4somi0,1.0,t3_4qg2bj,2240.0,EliteDangerous

Unfortunately, while cross-platform multiplayer games are rare, they all will have this ""synchronising updates"" problem.  PC-only would have less waiting obviously.

Hopefully, once the PS4 version of ED is released, MS will speed up their validation process as Sony's is *much* quicker.",2016-06-22 21:03:46+00:00,d4jx848,5.0,t1_d4jwubc,482.0,EliteDangerous

This is completely incorrect information.  If you are attempting (naively) to cite SteamCharts as your source, that is 4500 *concurrent* players - i.e. at the same time. There is no daily total players stat anywhere. 

[Steamspy shows 66k Steam CMDRs](http://steamspy.com/app/359320) during the past fortnight, a drop off of 8% since 2.1's release.

These stats also exclude non-Steam CMDRs, which make up 45% of the playerbase, of which there is no data.

&gt; when 2.0 launched the game went from 10,000 players to 18,000

1. To pirate goods from them (trader/miner/smuggler).
2. To gain their bounty (criminal).
3. To protect/attack the system's power (Powerplay).
4. (hopefully in future) to stop a mission affecting influence (Minor Faction).
5. Because you're there (tough).

The counters to these:

1. Give some goods to the pirate - this is what trader's are supposed to do anyway, instead of running &amp; getting themselves killed.  Giving away 20% of profits is better than 100% loss &amp; rebuy.
2. Run, or be a better criminal &amp; kill the attacker.
3. Run, or be a better Powerplayer &amp; kill the attacker.
4. Stay out of another player group's main system.
5. Stay out of popular systems, e.g. Eravate.

Alternatively:

1. Wing up when in Open - this is a multiplayer game.  See /r/EliteWings, /r/EliteTraders, /r/EliteMiners, etc.

What I'd also like to see are the direct benefits to Open play as suggested by Sandro recently, of doubling effects of Merits and Influence for actions in Open play.  This would give more incentive to Open play also.

If some CMDRs only want to quietly do whatever-activity in-game, on their own, then Solo is the best mode for them anyway.

&gt; Hi everyone!

&gt; We have the passenger gameplay coming as part of the 2.2 release, and there’s one aspect we’d like your input with. One of the reasons for passengers travelling is tourism, so we’re building a database of tourist locations in human space and beyond for the passengers to visit. We know that you’ve visited wonderful places and discovered some great sights, so we’re calling on you to post the place that you’d like to visit if you were a tourist.

&gt; To submit your suggestion you should provide the following information in a single post in this thread:

&gt; * Location name (this should include system name, body name and lat/long if the location is on the surface).
&gt; * A screenshot of the view.
&gt; * Your Commander name – this will be used as a location selected by, if it’s used.

&gt; The entries selected will be included in game, although we may not use them all for the initial release.

&gt; This thread is for submissions only, please do not conduct discussion in this thread to make it easier for us to keep track of submissions.

&gt; If there are multiple submissions for the same location then we’ll attribute the Commander who first suggested the location in this thread.

&gt; In a few weeks we’ll provide an opportunity for any travel writers to provide descriptive entries for these tourist locations – more information on that soon.

&gt; Thanks!

There are hundreds (thousands?) of Discord servers out there, all with excellent communities.

&gt; Was it this one?

There was no such suggestion from yourself prior to the vote.  Seeing as you're happy for your comments to be open, here is what you posted at the time:

&gt; Having been on the receiving end of doxxing in this game I can say it remains truly staggering to me that people take this shit so seriously that the line between real-life identities and in-game personas blurs.

&gt; Having said that... I think there's a case for being able to talk about the actions of various CMDRs.

&gt; How does the community police itself and determine its own standards of conduct if not informed as to what people are doing?

&gt; Should people that are cheaters, hackers, doxxers, loggers, griefers, bigots, etc... be afforded the anonymity to move from system to system and group to group ruining the game for people as no-one can report on their actions so they're free to do so again and again?

&gt; I don't think it's a cut and dry issue, is what I'm getting at.

&gt; On the one hand, banning it would stop the N&amp;S shitposting from groups like SDC and the constant cries of ""Hacker!"" ""Combat logger!"" etc... as well as preventing doxxing (which actually matters)... but conversely it allows cunts to flourish unabated because FDEV don't have the facility to shut them down.

&gt; There are some means of conduct within a community that is a matter of ethics/standards and that is for the community itself to decide... is what I'm getting at.

Very good contributions, but no mention of ""consulting the subreddit at large"" *prior* to rules being implemented.

What of course has been actioned is usage of /r/EliteCombatLoggers, who are doing an excellent job of archiving CL-videos, and publishing the summary data on this subreddit.

While I admire your obvious passion for being a member of the Council, and consequently your frustration at us simply removing you, your objection is unnecessary - Reddit isn't and won't ever be a democracy.  Modteams manage their respective subreddits, and the Council here is to help us discuss and define rules and events to better /r/EliteDangerous, nothing more.

As to the timing of my replies, it's difficult to respond when I'm asleep (5:30am BST).  I was awake until 3am BST finishing some work, so a good 5hr after my initial PM to yourself.  You could of course have been patient and waited for my reply, but you chose alternatively avenues.

2399,"And here is my reply for all to see:

***

Heck no, SpyTec agreed with our conclusion of course (as did Murdoc) but was unnecessary for approval (SpyTec's opinion obviously being biased against you following the personal attacks).

As to the public attacks, [starting from this comment](/r/EliteDangerous/comments/4giabt/serious_constructive_nonabusive_feedback_on/d2j6ogr) - many of which have been removed (but are still stored on Reddit, visible to mods and admins, and can be re-approved).  Completely off-topic to incite conflict and drama, *in your own serious thread* of all places.

Whether there's a huge public concern about a prior conflict of interest (i.e. 6 months ago), or whether its just hyperbole from a small, yet vocal, number of disappointed CMDRs, is at this point unknown.  This is no more important than a soap-opera drama subplot, and from comments I've seen, the number of CMDRs who appear to think this is of interest is around 70.

Regarding ""I didn't tow the party line and agree with everything the boyking and his team of yes men wanted"" you realise this is a subreddit - and we're discussing merely moderation, and a Council helping define the subreddit's rules and events.  This isn't a political party running a country, or a multi-million pound company, or charity helping starving third-world populations.  **It's a fan forum**, a popular one admittedly. Drama is not welcome, and (successful) attempts to create it are logged appropriately.

Some CMDRs are indeed upset, and we'll do our best to accommodate their concerns where appropriate.  However, keeping *everyone* happy with their individual preferences is impossible.

Your valid points in the Council discussions were noted, and we're taken steps to implement some of them.  As per my initial PM your contributions have been excellent.  The public drama-inciting comments not-so-much.

And Godwin's law is proved true once again.  I believe something like ""such drama, much hyperbole, very salt"" would be applicable here.",2016-06-06 13:26:32+00:00,d3y0jmp,2.0,t1_d3xzaxv,2436.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; Breaking down the cost by month is irrelevant. You're still dropping the mass cash at once. That's like saying ""Just buy that $30,000 car!, its only $400 a month!""

Mod-me definitely does.

&gt; the 1.6 players have been saying

All of them?  You'll need to provide links to these obscure sources that reference ALL 1.6 players.

&gt; since all the new rewards, the new AI, etc. are are for/using stuff that is inaccessible to them

Again, source links.  CMDRs who cannot cope with the new AI of low-rank NPCs really need to practice more.  Blaming the fact they can't have 10% damage bonuses isn't really going to help.

As to PvP, like in all MMOs to stay competitive you need to buy expansions (or pay the $10 monthly subscription to play the latest version...) else you can become outclassed - assuming an equivalent pilot skill of course.

&gt; Its not going to get better as seasons progress. You won't be able to play the base game only soon enough.

For competitive PvPers?  That's a possibility, but if they're competitive they're playing all the time, and $45 per year (on release; or $30 five months later) to a game you're playing all the time is great value.  Less than $4 (or $3) per month :)",2016-06-04 19:47:38+00:00,d3w15e3,6.0,t1_d3w0g92,1252.0,EliteDangerous

So you've not played ED then - why are you trolling here?  Otherwise you'd know that large ships (since the Anaconda was released) have small mounts perfect for turrets, to help defend against smaller ships trying to outflank your primary weapon arcs.

&gt; Doesn't change the fact that they are charging for fixes to the game.

&gt; Given the speculation about what might be causing this bug, and what it means for the game - I thought I'd clarify a few things on the technical side . Sadly it wasn't as simple a change as an un-initialised or out of range value, my head would be a lot less hurty this week if it had been!

&gt; So, to try and explain. 

&gt; The data for a module in Elite is split up into a set of blocks: things like power consumption, vulnerability to overheating, health, and of particular interest in this case, Weapon data. Weapon data is about 40-50 values controlling everything from the more obvious rate of fire &amp; range, to slightly obscure things like how fast the beam fades after you release the trigger. More or less any combination of values is allowed (you want a laser shotgun? sure, take a pulse laser and set the Rounds Per Shot value to 12). This flow is identical between players and npcs, even stations and skimmers actually.

&gt; Prior to 1.6/2.1 the cached pointer each weapon held to its data was a simple affair pointing at a bit of data loaded from resources, but as part of the changes to make items modifiable I had to change this so it could also be a pointer to a block of data constructed from a base item plus a set of modifiers - ideally without the code reading that data caring (or even knowing) where it actually came from and therefore not needing to be rewritten to cope. This all works great in theory, and then in practice, up until a few naughty NPC's got into the mix and decided to make a mess. I'll gloss over a few details here, but the important information is that a specific sequence of events relating to how NPCs transfer authority from one players' machine to another, combined with some performance optimisations and an otherwise minor misunderstanding on my part of one of the slightly obscure networking functions got the weapon into an odd state. The NPC's weapon which should have been a railgun and had all the correct data for a railgun, but the cached pointer to its weapon data was pointing somewhere else. Dangling pointers aren't all that uncommon (and other programmers may know the pains they can cause!) but in this case the slightly surprising thing was that it would always be a pointer to a valid WeaponData - It's correct enough that it'd never have tripped any of the sanity checks or asserts that something was wrong, and yet.. clearly it's not right either!

&gt; What did this do exactly? Well in that example the weapon would have thought it was a slugshot: it'd make decisions on ammo, when to fire, how much power to consume and heat to generate as if it were a slugshot. It then tells the game to fire 12 shots but now we're outside the areas that use the cached data, the weapon manager knows its a railgun and dutifully fires 12 railgun shots . Depending on which machine this occurred on exactly it would either be as a visual artefact only that does no damage, or (more rarely but entirely possible) the weapon would *actually* fire 12 shots and carve a burning trail of death through the space in front of it. The hilarious part (for people not being aimed at) is that the bug can potentially cause hybrids of almost any two weapons... In my testing I've seen cases of railguns firing like slugshots, cannons firing as fast as multicannons, or my favourite absurd case of a Huge Plasma Accelerator firing every frame because it thought it was a beam laser... Ouch.

&gt; Why does this never occur on players? Well AI and players aren't governed by different rules in combat - but one thing AI's do that players never do is transfer authority between machines (it's rather hard to move out of range of yourself after all), which is the trigger at the heart of this bug. Removing modified weapons from NPCs earlier in the week will have reduced the frequency of the problem as it's more-or-less tied to how many modified weapons are in the session, the fix included in the build Zac mentioned coming soon should stamp it the rest of the way out. With the usual caveat of programmers: I fixed the problem I found, can't promise it's the last one!


&gt; Much as I love the insane weapons, and part of me likes having the proof that actually the system is hugely flexible... lets add them when we mean to next time! er... Sorry

You bought Open Beta.  It didn't say ""includes Lifetime Expansion Pass"", which prior to June 2014 was available for £35.

&gt; So I'd have to spend a combined £79.99 to get what anyone else can buy for £39.99.

Nope, for your £50 you have had open beta (started June 2014), gamma access (Nov 2014) and beta access to all 1.x updates since release (Dec 2014).  Buying Horizons now at £20 would get you non-beta Horizons access. £50+£20=£70 btw.

* Buy Horizons and get 2.0 to 2.4 upon their release for no extra cost.  
* Buy Season 3 and get 3.0 to 3.x upon their release for no extra cost.

As each Season progresses, more updates are released and the price is reduced - as with all games price reduces over time.  Choose to buy when you want.

I agree that we will unlock the number of 2 huge gimballed weapons that the community managed to unlock during the CG. These being the huge burst laser and huge pulse laser.
If the burst laser is not available for 2.1 release, we will replace it with the huge mutli cannon.

Fair enough. I'm more concerned about improvements to the flight-model, character control, and overall combat; the mechanics of trading, mining, exploration, faction-warfare, etc.

Or more specifically, when the designs of those improvements &amp; mechanics will be finalised and implementation is to begin.  Character dress-up surely is one of the least important aspects of a Space Sim's gameplay.

&gt; Why are people quietly drifting-off

It's normal for all games to have player dropoffs a few weeks/months after release, and spikes when new updates/expansions/DLC are announced/released.

Check SteamSpy for statistics on the current playerbases of the top AAA games released in the past year, and you'll see the patterns and data.

* SC/Sq42 stated that they would be split into separate purchases at some point.  KS &amp; pre-alpha2.3 backers received both for one price, and *really* early backers received Sq42 ep2 too.  New Citizens pay much more over time compared to the early backers.  We don't yet know post-beta/release pricing until those milestones are met, although we have hints ($60 for SC and each of Sq42's three episodes).  There has been talk of expansions (yet).
* ED stated that key features like Planetary Landings, Walking in Ships, EVA &amp; Ship Boarding, etc would be released as paid-for expansions.  Hence the Lifetime Pass that was available for $50 until mid-2014 (start of Open Beta).  New CMDRs pay much more over time compared to the early backers, although the price of each Season Of Expansions decreases by 75% within a year (during sales) of its release.

Of course ED doesn't have anything resembling Sq42: Story-driven single-player experience, with a heavy focus on in-engine cut-scenes, and gameplay solely based on missions involving combat via both space flight-model and FPS (both modes in development).  COD:IW is stated to have all those features and so appears to be the competitor to Sq42.

2785,"&gt; I'm fairly certain this isn't the case - or maybe it was for a brief window, or maybe there was some other option for a brief window.

The *brief* window was 6 months, from [August 2015](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=172800) to [February 2016](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=230150).

&gt; this whole ""$15 more to test for us""

Beta access for the whole Season of Horizons is currently $10

&gt; I was sold a Season Pass that promised 3 add-ons.

And the Season pass will be giving you the *5* add-ons (2.0-2.4) as promised, when they are released.

&gt;  Now they want me to pay about 50% of the price of that pass just to participate in the beta for one of the 3 add-ons... that I already paid for in advance.

1. Buying into beta is optional.
2. It's price is 25-30% of the Horizons Season Pass (depending on currency).
3. Buying the beta upgrade will get you beta access to ALL of Horizons' betas, not just 2.1 beta.
4. You didn't pay for beta access in advance - if you had, you would have paid ~$20 extra, prior to February 2016.

&gt; I would argue that ""the entire season of content"" implies ENTIRETY. Breaking the beta out later, after charging people for the season pass under those pretenses, seems very dishonest to me.

You get the entire season of content, from when they are released.  Beta is pre-release.",2016-05-07 13:37:57+00:00,d2wbpho,4.0,t1_d2vlhn4,61635.0,EliteDangerous

If a player has been blocked from a private group, or a group/individual has taken every step possible to remove a player from their gameplay, then attempting to circumvent this in any fashion is a serious offense and action will be taken accordingly. Attempting to re-establish contact with an individual who has blocked a player through secondary accounts or other methods of attempting to evade the block are against the rules. Action can and will be taken against both the accounts in question and the main accounts of players that we deem to be harassing players through this method. 

&gt; In addition taking action such as seeking out and targeting specific players purely for the purpose of being disruptive, to cause offence, or to upset players within the community can also be considered harassment. ~~A perfect example of this is deliberately attempting to disrupt public livestreams such as the charity ones mentioned before.~~ This includes, but is not limited to, the capturing of footage and releasing it publically in an attempt to create upset or gain notoriety through the actions listed above.

2975,"&gt; Because the people who were and are in the Discord admin/mod drama are also part of the subreddit community. You can't say that they are unrelated since you are dealing with the same people. 

What CMDRs do outside of the subreddit (bar doxxing other CMDRs) doesn't concern me, and it shouldn't.  I don't concern myself with whether they are mods or users of other forums, play other games, where they go on holiday, etc.

&gt; By the way, this is not just directed at you but the whole mod team.

Again, it doesn't matter.

&gt; Look what's happened here. The friction between members of the council and SpyTec &amp; Rhea carried on from Discord.

I can't prevent personal friction between CMDRs.

&gt; Since the ED Discord server was described as the official subreddit discord, you cannot separate them. If you ignore this then its pretty much saying ""whatever my left arm does is no concern of my right arm"". I know the mod team and Rhea wants to keep these completely separate now and I get that. However this is no longer possible because the same people are involved in both.

There is only one Mod who is a member of both the subreddit and Discord modteams, and that's /u/CMDR_Shazbot - who does a fantastic job on the subreddit.

2993,"&gt; By that logic, it sound's like you telling me not to post anything unless it's at peak time so I can generate the most discussion and highest amount of karma.

If you're targeting a large discussion then posting between the hours of 8am and midnight GMT will attract more traffic, than posting between midnight and 8am.  See the [subreddit's traffic stats](/r/EliteDangerous/about/traffic/).

&gt; I post things in order to post things. Do you see my karma count? I don't care about karma.

Good to hear :)

&gt; But can you see how a post without the ""I hope ED has this implemented soon!"" could promote the same (Or even more) discussion?

No.  The post would then not be relevant to this subreddit, and more appropriate to /r/space or /r/nasa, and almost certainly attract *more* discussion too.",2016-04-27 14:49:55+00:00,d2jd1ac,9.0,t1_d2jcn0z,546.0,EliteDangerous

Not necessarily.  The subreddit has an average of 15k daily visitors, of which only around 250 would have seen the original due to its off-peak posting time.

&gt; How do you classify what is able to and what is not able to promote discussion about the game? Does the game's title simply have to be somewhere within the title itself, or does the post content need to blatantly be about Elite: Dangerous?

There is no hard and fast rule as it depends on the content being submitted.  ""Content"" in this case being:

* The Title and/or Linked Third-Party Article/Image/Video (for Link-Posts)
* Title and/or Body-Text (for Text-Posts)

3011,"&gt; The posts that end up being removed could be talking about a new earth-like planet found in real-life space. This in itself does not relate to Elite:Dangerous the game, but it does create discussion for players to talk about, for example, what system this planet might be found in, the geography of the planet and how similar it might be to an earth-like some explorer found in-game.

If its a link-post titled to inspire discuss about *the game*, or a text-post with description inspiring discussion about the game, then they are perfectly welcome content.

&gt; Interesting discussions about real-life space would promote discussion about E:D because E:D is trying to simulate real-life space.

And if they're titled/described appropriately in link/text posts then are perfectly welcome content.

&gt; By your logic, the old posts about funny NPC names should stay, and THIS post should have been removed. It does not reference Elite: Dangerous at all. He could have made that same rig for any flight simulator.

It isn't.  The title *is part of the content* as it briefly describes *what you are posting*.

If the title or content don't mention the game, then there is *little effort* made to inspire discussion about the game.

3050,"A collection of suggested changes which you're welcome to discuss:

###Cheating

* What classes as cheating - does logging out to menu while in combat count?
* /r/EliteCombatLoggers or a megathread?
   * Should the megathread allow naming of cheaters in post titles?
   * Either method effectively keeps the ""content is uninteresting"" videos off the main sub feed (i.e. ""great, another combat logger"").
   * The subreddit/megathread could be linked to within the AutoMod-created weekly Q&amp;A sticky thread, or on the sidebar.
* The Council could maintain a publicly viewable list of cheaters, split into two sections:
   * CMDRs that have cheated once/few times (once could be a mistake). What number should this be limited to?
   * CMDRs that have cheated many times.  What minimum number should this be set as?

###Council

* Council is expanded to include around 20 members.
* Council subreddit is made viewable to all.
* The new Council members to be nominated/selected by prominent subreddit-active groups.
* As currently, Council and Modteam discuss subreddit changes and vote on them.
* As the Council subreddit is viewable, CMDRs can pass comments to Council members to include in discussions.

###Community Voting

* The community votes on implementing changes voted-in by the Council/Modteam.

&gt; doxxing

&gt; It would be very unfortunate for some people here if we were to disclose personal information about your moderation team

&gt; we have the tools and the information.

Hahaha!  As a UK citizen my privacy is pretty much non-existent (due to Government policy).  If I was at all concerned about being doxxed about my history I certainly wouldn't use my *real name* on Reddit or other social forums/media.  Frankly, trying to claim you've got skills because you can search via Google or online UK Government records is a bit of a stretch.

As I've always stated since I became a mod, I always aim to be honest, open-minded and transparent - like I am in life.  So to save everyone the trouble of doing a few Google searches, here's my eventful history for everyone ;)

* Married and divorced.
* University education.
* Work in IT Business Support.
* Regular music festival goer: 30+ major festivals and counting, UK and abroad.
* Friends and family all over the world.
* Play pool competitively - I'm a bit shit tbf.
* Drink regularly, and smoke weed on rare occasions - usually at festivals (legal in UK btw).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ""criminal background"",""cheating"" or ""illicit activities outside the game""

And now the *best* bits:

* 8yr ago used the UK legal system to wipe off £50k of debt accrued during my University time - I'm now getting a 3% APR mortgage yay!
* 8 different convictions on my criminal record.
* 6 minor offences resulting in fines, ranging from ""smoking controlled substance in Leicester Square"", to ""drunk and disorderly"" - at Download festival, an achievement in itself!
* Bed &amp; Breakfast at the pleasure of Her Majesty for 3 of the minor offences.
* 1 medium offences: excessive speeding which temporarily cost me my driving licence.
* 1 major offence: assault causing actual bodily harm - beat up an out-of-line bouncer (who was 1 foot taller and 40kg heavier than me).

3063,"&gt; They are scaling distance in order to keep travel times reasonable - why would you scale travel speed?

Mathematics: if you scale distance, velocity is also scaled (as I showed above).

Now, if they're *shrinking* the systems, as a few others have commented in this thread, that's different.  Like with No Man's Sky, where they're using fantasy planet sizes and shrunken stellar distances for gameplay purposes.

But CIG could at least say that, and give details, instead of these mixed (incorrect?) messages. The ARK starmap shows the Crusader system as being 5AU across, which would take 3hr to traverse at 0.2c.  If it truly takes only 20 minutes to traverse it, then the QD max speed must be 1.75c (almost double the speed of light).",2016-04-26 02:27:33+00:00,d2hf4pl,7.0,t1_d2he9f2,1265.0,starcitizen

Why does he now have such difficulty giving similar, prepared answers to the *known-in-advance* questions, like with what he actually says (thanks to a Goon for the transcription, sorry for the wall of Chris-text) to Q2:

&gt; **Q:** *It seems to me there have been a lot of lessons learned in online gaming over the last 15 years. My question is, have you been in discussion with former colleagues from your Origin or wider afield and has this influenced your thinking on your development strategy for SC? I ask because one of the truly enjoyable aspects of some of their games have been around player economy and socialization (thinking SWG particularly).*

&gt; **A:** Well yeah, you know ABSOLUTELY I mean... so when I started... this... I uh... you know... obviously ULTIMA ONLINE's one of the sort of original grandaddys of MMOs, it was... started development when I was still at ORIGIN and I know a lot of the people that LED IT, you know obviously, ah... RICHARD GARRIOT LORD BRITISH STAR LONG... and quite a few other folks too, so, uhm... (long pause) ... had... a fair amount of discussions in the early days, ah, you know... long time ago... subscribed to... STAR WARS GALAXIES! and WORLD OF WARCRAFT! and all the rest of them, so... yeah a lot of that's, sort of uhh... kind of has SHAPED... what I wanna do with... Star... ehm-it-did-ah-ee it's ESSENTIALLY it's kinda like I look at what OTHER THINGS DO and I go, ""ah I like that bit"", or, ""I don't like this bit"", or ""I really would like this kind of experience"", that's usually KIND OF why I make games, cos I sort of SEE SOMETHING that I would like a certain way, and there isn't a game out there that sort of DELIVERS that experience and SO I GO AND MAKE IT, which is really how STAR CITIZEN came about cos I sort of felt like the TECHNOLOGY was ready to sort of build this IMMERSIVE WORLD that I've always wanted to venture out in... ah, and, ah, I you know, I have to say that, that the SOCIAL ASPECTS which I think you're asking about here is, ah, one of the things that's really COMPELLING and even in, ah... what you can see right now in, sort of the early stages of SC ALPHA where you know, really, you can't... you know we don't actually have that many systems of gameplay to support the SOCIAL ASPECTS, but people are JUST DOING IT ANYWAY, so, you know, ah... someone gets STRANDED out in a location and they'll go into the chat and say, ""hey, come rescue me"", and when, we haven't... we're not... we ARE going to have support were you'll have a RESCUE BEACON and it'll show up on a MAP and, you know, you can PAY PEOPLE to PICK YOU UP and stuff like that, but... right now it's all sort of completely informal emergent behaviour, that the... that everyone that's playing is sort of doing, so people are rescuing other people, or, people are like getting together and crewing up ships and going off and getting involved in... you know, ENCOUNTERS and ADVENTURES and ah... 

&gt; ...it's... it's REALLY COOL and we actually have, you know a BIG FOCUS of... uh, the WORLD and the SYSTEM we're building is we're... we're... building PLAY for people that wanna play solo definitely, right which is sort of that old PRIVATEER model but... there's a HUGE FOCUS on how we build... GAMEPLAY that is that sort of... GROUP OF FRIENDS EXPERIENCE were like you and your buddies are flying a CONSTELLATION or ahm, you know, you're out there interacting with other players like SOMEONE NEEDS HELP they need to be REFUELLED or REARMED or SAVED OUT IN SPACE or... ahm... you know... all these kinda things we are BUILDING systems to do that, we have a pretty EXCITING, ahm... sort of... NEXT STAGE COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM that will UNIFY WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THE WEB and also what'll happen in the game, it's still , you know it's in the EARLY STAGES and we're working on it, so it's not gonna debut right now, but I definitely think that's gonna be PRETTY COOL were you'll be able to... ORGANISE your GROUPS and CHAT GROUPS and FRIENDS and ORGANISATIONS and... and... be... ah, you know... NOT IN THE GAME or IN THE GAME and uh, sort of have FULL PRESENCE in, sort of the CHATS so not the sort of very rudimentary basic one that we have in the game now, uhm, it's just gonna, we're gonna sort of basically UNIFY IT uhm (mumble) platform so you could... ARRANGE on these sort of... chat... SETUPS... for, you know, and your GROUPS and arrange GROUPS and say, ""hey let's gather for a game, let's go adventuring together tonight at..."", you know... X PM or whatever and later on you go in the game it's already set up, you set it off offline maybe on your... ah... you know... PC or maybe on your mobile but... it's all the same kinda sort of CHAT so you could even have someone PLAYING the game and you could see... say on your... whatever, your ANDROID or IPHONE, ah... and you could be CHATTING with some people that are playing the game IN THE SAME CHAT THING and it's all, and you'll see where they are in the STAR SYSTEMS and so we're, we're gonna have a PRETTY COOL ah, you know there's a lotta focus anyway, it, the upshot is that we're focussing a lot on SOCIAL ASPECTS, getting people together, I mean I definitely am always impressed every time we have an event cos... ah, you know, all these people say, ""HAI, you know this, ah yoh way, ya know NEW BEST FRIEND AND I ONLY MET HIM THROUGH STAR CITIZEN"", and you know, really it, you know, YES we're a computer game that sits, everyone sits in front of a computer and interacts but, you know, meeting real people on the other end and, so we're thinking about how we can get people to work together, co ordinate together to ACHIEVE THINGS as well as just have, you know, the LONE WOLF GAMEPLAY and then of course we have sort of the BIGGER ORGANISATION META GAMEPLAY as well, planned in there

&gt; So I'm thinking when ALL OF IT'S IN which obviously, you know, TAKES TIME because, HAHA, it's wildly ambitious, a-ahaha, it will be um... ya--ehhhh I think socially probably you know our goal is to be... ahh... you know, something that people will look at and say, ""THAT IS HOW YOU IMPLEMENT A SORT OF SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT IN YOUR GAME"", and I think if you'll look at what we do with the, you know, the WEB side of things and HOW WE DO IT ON THE COMMUNITY SIDE you can definitely see that that's sort of our objective

&gt; It is normal for Reddit to be the place where the average joe discusses topics important to them, stop preventing that.

We aren't banning/stopping discussions about FDev preventing cheats and exploits.

&gt; If someone witch hunts they are breaking the rules, you're not.

Hence we'll now remove such posts.

&gt; Until FDEV does something we should put pressure on them and go case by case discouraging cheaters, IIRC some have been punished. Community pressure is the only way shit gets done, can't you guys see it. FDEV obviously needs guidance (as per Braben's post a while back). Every big change we have, it is something community requested. I have played many games, Elite has by far been the most influenced by the community.

3112,"&gt; Correct. Less than 10% of owners. That's what I call a small minority.

10% of Steam ED owners.  It's worth noting comparative game playerbases:

* GTA 5 = 26%
* Fallout 4 = 22%
* ARK = 16%
* DOTA 2 = 14%
* Witcher 3 = 12%

&gt; So?? You're implying 55% is not a representative sample??

The hardcore Elite fans: lifetime expansions passes, Horizons pre-orders, and early backer accounts, were all purchases direct from FDevStore - outside of Steam.  While some have migrated to Steam, the non-ED ownership is still 650k+ (it was 340k at the launch of ED on Steam).

Meanwhile, 300k+ Steam ED accounts were created once the price was discounted to £10.

It is completely unknown whether the Steam stats are a representative sample.  However, Community Manager [Brett C did say this](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?p=3765448#post3765448) nine days ago:

&gt; Game is far from dying, there's a fair share of players in solo, groups, as there are in open. To me, the player counts look quite healthy actually :)

&gt; #COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT: CMDR CORPSE NECRUMUS

&gt; We stumbled upon Corpse Necrumus's stream last week, when he was turning in 11 months of exploration data. Not only had he been out for 11 months, but he'd been doing econimical jumps only - we watched as he turned in a stunning amount of data, and sent over these questions about his trip to learn a little bit more about this dedicated Commander. You can see at timeplase of his 9 hour stream in the video below. 

&gt; Please note that Necrumus' tale does contain some tragic details about a friend of his that recently passed away, so it does make for an emotional story. The questions were sent to Necrumus in advance... he replied exactly as seen below.

&gt; [The Return - Timelapsed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8fsox6JxDc)

&gt; ###1 – That was an impressive trip. Can you give us the final tally on how much you made? Did you make it to Elite? Give us the full details!

&gt; I made exactly 582,332,653 CR and it took 7 hours and 36 minutes to turn in, and I livestreamed the entire event on twitch! so Yes, I made it to Elite and beyond! :D

&gt; ###2 – How long did this trip take? What was your motivation when heading out? Why did you choose do it?

&gt; My Trip took 10 Months and 1 Day - from the 27th of May 2015 to the 28th of March 2016. My motivation for heading out was just that I had always dreamed about being able to fly to outer space and exploring vast Nebulae and

&gt; My original Destination was the crab nebula, but seeing that it would be quite boring to fly in a straight line all the way out to the crab Nebula, I decided to make various checkpoints, in this case, either specific stars, black holes, or nebulae along the way. The idea to do it economically was because I wanted to do something different than most explorers do these days :) I wouldn't however have made this trip if it wasn't for my friend Thomas who encouraged me to do the trip when I was uncertain if I could actually do it. May his soul rest in space. he died on the 13th November 2015, two days later, I get to know, at the same day I reached the Crab Nebula that My friend had committed suicide, at that point I first didn't know what to do. he had always watched the pictures I took of nebulas and other stuff and commented on it. I looked around, and in the far distance I saw the Heart and Soul Nebulas, I decided I'd go there as a acceptance of his passing, and I swore I would complete the journey economical route, so I continued, but after the Heart and Soul Nebulas, I started my journey home (again via Nebulae and stars) To tell the entire trip shortly: I began at LTT 15449 and went to the following checkpoints: Mintaka, Rigel, Witch Head Nebula, EZ Orionis, Orion's Nebula, Running Man Nebula, Flame Nebula, Messier 78, Barnard's Loop, Horsehead Nebula, Orion Dark Region, Vy Canis Majoris, Thor's Helmet, Seagull Nebula, Rosette Nebula, Jellyfish Nebula, Monkey Head Nebula, Crab Nebula, Heart &amp; Soul Nebulas, NGC 7822, Cave Nebula, Elephant Trunk Nebula, North America Nebula, Pelican Nebula, Sadr Region and finally The Pleiades Nebula. after that I went home to the bubble where I grinded Merits in Powerplay for Li Yong Rui's bonus. So you could say half of the journey was because I wanted to see nebulae, and the other half was to honor a deceased friend. :)

&gt; ###3 – Did you have any scrapes along the way? Near misses where you thought you may lose it all?

&gt; I had 3 close encounters and times I was worried I'd lose it all. the first one was When I fell asleep in front of the computer, and woke up to the heat alarm in the ship going in full force, thankfully it was only at 101%, so I had only taken heat damage to modules. Second one was when I had about 1000 lightyears left to NGC 7822, I came to a big black gap where there were no stars to go to, and I didn't have a viechle hangar, nor weapons because of me heading out back in 1.2 so synthesis was out of the question. I managed to deplete my fuel to low enough to make the few jumps in between the few stars there though. The Third -and worst one- was when I was grinding Merits. I had outfitted my ASP (same old ""Da Sneaky Gobbo"" as I used for exploring) and I jumped into a fight against a Dangerous Imperial Clipper (Bad Idea) he broke my canopy, so I charged my frameshift drive, but noticed It was going slowly, so I was panicking and thinking ""WHY?!"" then I remembered that I was trying to low-wake, so I quickly selected another system, and jumped out with 39% hull left. but it doesn't end there - I decided I was gonna land on a planet to repair. but because my canopy was not possible to see, I went on the oposit side of the planet, realizing this, I finally saw a statinon above me in just outside of the planet, a station I was wanted at, but I decided this time it was all or nothing, I boosted in, turned on silent running and managed to get in with more or less a minute to spare... I really almost had a heartattack with that one... Shoutout to S7 and Capn' Murica from the Code for keeping me calm and focused via teamspeak.

&gt; ###4 – Any highlights along the trip, what did you see?

&gt; Oh there were tons! I've taken quite a few pictures during my trip which I'll show pictures off in a tribute video I'm going to make for my deceased friend, but I think the most awesome place was when I jumped to a black hole with a supernova-like nebula around it. (This one in particular is called CYOIDAI GH-U E3-3. Check it out!) I also have a video of it on my youtube. I also found a Earth-like that had no name on it within 1000 Lightyears of Sol! Would you believe it that there are still untagged systems that close to the bubble?! :D

&gt; ###5 – You’ve played a lot of Elite Dangerous, how  many hours? Why do you play so much?

&gt; At the point of this question being asked, approx 4200 hours  (3210 on steam, and about 1000 hours before it came to steam) I Play Elite: Dangerous so much because it is my passion, it's the best game I've ever played (personal opinion, don't hate me! D:) I just love all aspects of it, Exploring, Pirating (which needs to be fixed a bit actually, because right now it's hard to pirate now with all the ""no-pirate-in-mind""-thinking that is going on), PvP, Combat overall, Trading, Smuggling, Mining... hell, I even love CQC, allthough I wish they'd fix the matchmaking, because that part, and sitting in a queue (for sometimes 3 hours without a single match) is annoying. I think one improvement that could be made there, would be if you could still chat in CQC in the lobby, so people actually don't just sit there and don't have anyone to talk with. it gets lonely! :D I also look forward alot to all the coming patches, but being a roleplay ""Onionheadabusing Misanthropic Hallucinating ex-military Terrorist-Pirate"", I especially look forward to 2.3 when we get The Character Creation and Multicrew. and I can't wait to see what ""big secret"" you guys have for us in 2.4 ;)

&gt; ###6 – What do you think of the Elite Dangerous Community?

&gt; I love most of the communities, there are some people I strongly agree with, and others I strongly disagree with. I'll mention no names here, as it would be rude to a certain part of the playerbase ;) 

&gt; ###7 – Are you involved in any other Community Groups yourself?

&gt; Yes I be a Crew Member of THE CODE! YARRRR!!! ye best be sure tae drop the cargo demanded when asked to, cause being selfish and keeping it all to yerself shows what kind of friend ye'd be. we pirates of the Code share our loot with our mateys, So ye better obey or Ye will soon have yer ship blown up, or be asked tae drop twice the ammount for trying tae escape! and if you even dare to combat log in front of me, I'll mark you on my kill-on-sight list ;) - Oh, and if Interdict you alongside Capn' Murica and you see this, feel free to say hello to me, afterall we are all crazy pirates, and we enjoy having fun!

&gt; ###8 – What’s next? Another big exploration trip?

&gt; Next I will be in The bubble mostly, doing PvP and piracy, but I'll also help out people if I can, and if I don't have orders to destroy specific targets ;) Also, I will at some point go to the Skull and Crossbone Nebula, and also to Sagittarius A. But the only thing that I currently know when it will happen is that the 13th of November 2016 I'll be going to the Eight Burst Nebula, this time not economical route though. and I'm doing so as a memorial day from one year of my friend's passing. he wanted me to go there at some point was one of the last things he told me. I intend to as before, uphold my honor. People can feel free to join me for this, it's entirely optional. A timestamp will come later if people are intrested in following me there. don't worry, it's just about 2000 light years away from the bubble. I will probably stream this event aswell.

&gt; ###9 – Anything else you want to say?

&gt; Whatever ye do ye Stationlubber, don't take me last Code-Noodles, that there be a plasma accelerator Death Sentence! if ye do so, prepare yer rebuy screen an' get ready tae walk the plank! The Code is Red - Long Live The Code! ;)",2016-04-18 12:07:51+00:00,d27epgv,1.0,t3_4fbcod,3129.0,EliteDangerous

It'd be history repeating itself, as per [what happened with Freelancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer_\(video_game\)):

&gt; Initially in 1999, Roberts announced the game would be available on the market by fall 2000. However, the project suffered delays and by Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2000, Roberts said the earliest release for the game was at the end of 2001.

&gt; In June 2000, Microsoft started talks to buy Digital Anvil. Roberts admitted that his team required large sums of money, which only a huge company could provide, to continue developing Freelancer with its ""wildly ambitious"" features and unpredictable schedule; the project had overshot its original development projection of three years by 18 months.

&gt; Roberts left the company on completion of the deal, but assumed a creative consultant role on Freelancer until its release. Microsoft instructed Digital Anvil to scale down the ambitions of the project and focus on finishing the game based on what was possible and the team's strengths. Features such as the automated flight control, conversations that had different choices of responses, and sub-quests were abandoned.

&gt; Microsoft announced the project was on schedule, and Digital Anvil added all the planned content for the game by October 2002.

&gt; The game shipped to retailers on March 4, 2003

Publisher money and production would at least mean the game would get released within a few years - although which features survive is anyone's guess.",2016-04-18 11:54:29+00:00,d27eejn,1.0,t3_4fb6ro,5739.0,starcitizen

3193,"C &amp; P #2:

&gt; **Zac (continued):** We've recently move over to a discord server and we're finding it far easier to manage so we will be increasing the number of groups in there. Again, these will be groups that help and support the wider community in a variety of ways. 

&gt; I don't believe that FD truly are ""out of touch"" with groups. My question to you would be how can we help and support your group to work with all these other larger groups to support your community and the wider community as a whole. Let us know what events you're running, how can other community members get involved, what's cool about them that people would like? What cool activity are ToC doing that the community might want to know about? What content are you making? Ultimately all we want as a Community team are players that love to enjoy and play the game and we want to help support all corners of the communities to improve everyone's game experience. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **SuBSynk:** *In ToC our RP/cannon is very strong with what could be a book of lore and history; we do not openly and on mass recruit members on forums and anyone not fulfilling the members guide requirements are removed. We have never sought publicity, except in RP situations, and we are one of the largest player groups, most effective PvP teams and strongest PvE groups in the ED gaming sphere.* 

&gt; **Zac:** It's a shame to hear you won't be applying for a wildcard event. This confidence and enthusiasm is exactly the type of group we would like to see putting their name forward for the event.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Ben Ryder:** *This is incredibly exciting. One question regarding the selction process. Is the length of time spent in the minor faction creation backlog taken in to account?*  

&gt; **Zac:** There are no concessions being made. Simply because it would be impossible to work out. Groups who were in batch 1 will obviously have had more time to grow and the most recent batch has had a delay in being implemented. However, we have the wildcard option. Whether people qualify through that or the top 5 they are all going to have to show a huge effort to be able to get through. There will likely also be more options for factions to become a power in the future so they can keep going. This isn't the end of factions but one point that a faction can become a power.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Goose4291:** *Zac, many thanks for clarifying this further, and it definitely looks a lot better to a lot of folks than when you first dropped this on Friday.  However I've just got to ask, shouldn't the groups competing have their Powerplay mechanics (i.e. bonuses/loyalty module and mechanic ethoses) finalised so the rank and file know what we're getting into before we start working to put them into the game? Also, some sort of Primer might be helpful for people to distinguish and identify who they should put their efforts behind (in terms of lore, ingame interactions thus far et all). I'd write one, however I know I'd be accused of massive bias!*  

&gt; **Zac:** There will definitely be more news and profiles during the voting period. Right now this is asking groups ""who wants to put their name forward"".",2016-04-17 11:01:12+00:00,d267bvy,2.0,t1_d267brb,14.0,EliteDangerous
3194,"C&amp;P:

&gt; Hey guys, 

&gt; I'll try and go through and answer a few questions. There are a few here that I will need to wait until next week to check but I'll see if I can get a few in now. 

&gt; I just thought I would take a second to explain exactly why this is for me, one of the most exciting activities we've done to date. I truly believe this could be an incredibly fun and interesting event. 

&gt; The key here really is all about bringing the community together. There is so much opportunity with this event from propaganda, group politics, alliances and coalitions. The stories that groups that could come from this event could be incredible! 

&gt; For me it's not even about whether you personally enjoy powerplay or if you don't engage with that side of things. For me this is bigger than that. This is the first (yes ideally we would like to do more of these in the future) time where groups will be able to demonstrate, through huge amounts of effort, their dedication and be recognized in the history books of Elite. That's pretty incredible. 

&gt; I should just clarify a couple of points while I'm here too. 

&gt; The Powerplay faction and power being added by groups will not have any other additional rules or powers then powers that currently exist. The winning group will work with the development team to ensure that any additions to the game are suitable and will need to complete a manifesto to help steer that addition to the game and what the power would be like and represent. But the way that the actions that the Power takes is determined by player action, as with all of Powerplay.

&gt; I should also clarify that the list at the bottom of the post are people who have registered their interest. They will be checked before the vote to check for eligibility. If they are eligible groups will then all go through to a vote and the top 5 voted will go through to the wildcard games during beta.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **atak2:** *Another potentially exciting event reduced to grinding in private groups. Also the way Frontier are picking player groups outside of the game to take part... Sigh*  

&gt; **Zac:** We haven't picked any groups. ALL groups will be determined by player actions. (They have expanded and developed their minor faction the most) or through the community (a vote) and themselves (completing CGs). We aren't selecting ANY groups.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;


&gt; **Mephane:** *Will the competing community goals be identical? I.e. same task, same system? Because even such seemingly minor details as a different location can have massive impacts on player participation. For example if travel time is too long, people will choose the CG where they spend less time jumping around or in supercruise. Or if one CG is bounty hunting in a system with HAZRES, the other is smuggling, bounty hunting is far more likely to come out ahead. Yet make it bounty hunting with no RES in the system, and good luck finding enough people for more than the starting tiers.*  

&gt; **Zac:** Yeah, we have considered this. We will be making them as equal as possible. Our initial thoughts are to have them all AT THE SAME SYSTEM with the same activity each week. So it's truly fair. Obviously anything can happen and can be changed if the devs believe it to be the right thing to do. But this is definitely something being considered heavily.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;


&gt; **Goose4291:** *Will there be opposing CG's running counter to each groups so people can oppose certain factions, like we did with Lugh?*  

&gt; **Zac:** There will be 5 CGs running for each event (wildcard and rise to power). People can oppose a group by supporting another.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;


&gt; **Goose4291:** *I don't often agree with you, but you're right on this one. 3 of these groups going forward for this are pro-imperial. Do we need another Imperial power?*  

&gt; **Zac:** The list is still growing and this list is only for the people who will attempt for the wildcard place. There are 5 other groups that are already qualified for the final that we are waiting to hear back from. Even if the winner of this list was an imperial faction you might want to wait for the other groups to be confirmed first as they will be 5 of the 6 groups in the final. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Avering:** *So, the Wildcard Games starts on the 12th of May. Any idea when we get the list of factions trying out their luck in the vote? I would guess you wouldn't leave only one day for that.*  

&gt; **Zac:** The vote will need to start soon. We need to know the groups that will be in that wildcard event by the end of April really for the CG set ups. So expect it to start relatively soon. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Lord Rog:** *Yeah, given that they even lost their home system it is strange that the Imperial Inquisition are included on this list. If they can't even keep control of the system they were given then they don't really deserve to be here.*  

&gt; **Zac:** It's up to the people as to who ""deserves"" to be here. The groups with the most ""pledges"" will be going through to the wildcard play off. Then it's down to them to perform. In addition TIIQ might have lost their home system but they have still expanded a number of times which is the stipulation of the rules for entry. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Silk:** *Count Adle's Armada in! We can be the champion of the people. :-)*  

&gt; **Zac:** A big contender just steps into the ring ladies and gentlemen.


&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Cosmos:** *So we have this nonesense instead of real guilds and sandbox emergent gameplay?*  

&gt; **Zac:** They aren't really one and the same. It's not that you get this ""instead of"" something else. I don't think it's right to compare this event using the current game mechanics with requests for future content.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **SuBSynk:** *Was drunk last night sorry, but in all seriousness this is a very unfortunate turn of events in my opinion. FD really need to get in tune as to what is happening in their galaxy regarding player groups. Most of their ""triple A"" groups are a shambles and only ""triple A"" because of the aggrandizement of their true situation (basically sucking up to FD with emails etc rather than in-game activity). Mobius is not a true player group with RP/cannon or even a vision that binds them (I have respect for the Mobius project but it is not a player group in any way).*  

&gt; **Zac:** Actually being a triple elite group isn't just for groups that have factions in the game. Yes that does include groups that are in game factions but we also have ""groups"" which are actually people who run sites and groups for large groups of players. For example the Elite Dangerous Subreddit, Elite One Subreddit etc. Connecting large groups that are community and content focused with groups that promote and publish Elite Dangerous content mean they can work closer together.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **SuBSynk:** *TIIQ are basically all talk and no action; just look at the system map for their home-world and all of their expansions. Emperors Grace do not even exist anymore and if they are still ""triple A"" that is indicative of how out of touch FD are....Code no longer even exist (as i predicted about six months ago). SDC is not a true player group either but rather a collection of PVPers that have gathered from many other groups, EIC are still around but quiet at the moment. I could go on and on.*  

&gt; **Zac:** I wanted to take a moment to debunk a few of these myths and clarify a few points here. Emperors Grace still exist (as Raf says below) but they are not currently a triple elite group, SDC are not a triple elite group and have not been one previously, Code are still active and I know this is a topic that CODE leadership have reinforced on many occasions. TIIQ run a huge number of community events and EIC are still very much active, I suspect that's why they put their name forward for this wildcard event. 

&gt; More importantly though is to look at how community groups are selected for Triple Elite. We've made a number of posts explaining who they are and what they do. Effectively they are groups that create content which support the community as a whole. by having them connected together they can collaborate and support each other in key events to make their events even better. They are groups that have proven to make great and engaging content. The forums (which you mention above) are there for the same purpose on a large scale as the forums are more manageable. All of the groups involve have contributed considerably to the community. Whether that be weekly AMA sessions on the Elite Dangerous Subreddit and the Elite One subreddit, 12 week Olympic event that TIIQ have been championing, weekly/daily lore streams, weekly PVP events and tournaments, seasonal events such as the EIC Halloween event, the 1,000 man distant worlds excursion which had so much community involvement, Hutton truckers mug CG, or their buggy racing event, or their jumps an numerous events vs CODE in open, involvement in every Mayhem schedule, Christmas charity livestreams, educating ed episodes, 10,000 rescues of commanders out of fuel and additional amazing content from fuel rats and much MUCH more. 

&gt; The thing is we work with and promote and support all groups that want to create content. Look at the newsletters from new year, we've supported groups big and small and we've had countless (well more than 10, that's past my fingers so no more counting can be done) community groups CGs and these are all available to everyone, just like the wildcard entry is available to all groups. However, connecting large groups, sites and players who make exciting content for the community can only be a good thing. ",2016-04-17 11:00:58+00:00,d267brb,1.0,t3_4f5lsb,15471.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; #The Dangerous Games: The Rise to Power!

&gt; Greetings Commanders, 

&gt; For almost a year now, the Pilots Federation have been processing requests and applications from brave groups of pilots who have wished to establish their own factions throughout populated space. 

&gt; We've seen fleets of Commanders supporting their faction. Some factions have suffered at the hands of others and some have expanded and grown considerably over time. 

&gt; Across the galaxy there are many powerful leaders fighting for control, power and glory. But these leaders are not infallible. For a while now some of the most sizable factions have been gaining power and influence and will soon be contesting to be recognized as a power within the galaxy themselves.

&gt; I'm extremely delighted to be able to inform you about some upcoming activities relating directly to groups and factions which will allow groups to be able to make their mark in history as we approach an event we call ""The Dangerous Games"". 

&gt; The top five factions based on a mix of factors such as their expansion and influence will be competing against each other for the incredible honour of becoming the first ever player-created power in game! We’ve taken the top five player factions as they currently stand and these groups have already qualified for the event. 

&gt; What's more, we’ll be opening up invitations for one lucky wildcard entry to join the other five as they go head to head. So make sure you carefully read through the details below as they explain exactly how The Dangerous Games will work and how your group can apply to be the wildcard entry. 

&gt; ###The Rise to Power

&gt; The Dangerous Games: Rise to Power will be held across four weeks. Each week will have a new type of CG (Community Goal) that the competing groups will all take part in. For example, one week could be a trade CG and the next could be mining. There will be a CG for each competing group and their task is to ensure that the CG is completed or at a high tier than their competitors. Groups will be ranked each week and given points based on where they were placed for each CG. At the end of the four weeks one group will emerge victorious. 

&gt; Everyone can get involved by either supporting or competing against any individual group or CG they wish. This means that every faction should be looking to gain support and favour with other Elite Dangerous Commanders and forge alliances to support their Rise to Power.

&gt; The Rise to Power four-week-long event is due to start on the 30th June 2016. Factions will not be made aware of the type of CG, system or any other information before the event goes live. 

&gt; The five factions who have qualified for this event are being contacted and once we have confirmed that the 5 factions are happy to enter and accepted their invitation we will publish it below. The top factions are taken from now. Any changes to factions from now on will only effect future games, and not this one. 

&gt; \**[5 qualifying groups will go here]*\*

&gt; ###Wildcard

&gt; There is room for one final group to participate in the final event. As a wildcard or people’s choice, this faction will have earned their place in The Dangerous Games through their ability to rally Commanders to their cause. 

&gt; In order to ensure there is a smooth running of the main event, we will be holding a The Dangerous Games: Wildcard event during the Horizons 2.1 beta. Five factions will compete in the Wildcard event, which will be held on the beta servers (see below for further details). Groups that qualify for the event may be able to send through a roster of players that will be given beta access for the event duration if they don't already have it. Confirmation to follow. 

&gt; We are expecting the Wildcard games to start on the 12th May and continue for four weeks. They will run in the same way the main event will run above. 

&gt; ###But how do I register my faction as a wildcard?

&gt; Groups who have a faction in game which has expanded at least once will be eligible to put their name forward. Groups must email community@frontier.co.uk with the subject line The Dangerous Games: Wildcard to be considered. Please include the name of your faction and please send it from the group representative that was given when the group first registered. 

&gt; All the registered groups will be added as a poll for the community to pledge to (Vote on). The top five groups will then go through to The Dangerous Games: Wildcard event and will compete for a chance to play in the Rise to Power and try to claim the glory of becoming the first ever player-created power in game! 

&gt; We're looking forward to seeing all the groups campaigning for votes and support. Remember to get as involved in the community as possible. We will be highlighting groups through spotlights, campaign posters, livestream interviews and more. 

&gt; If you haven't yet been able to register your faction or expand that faction don't worry. There are always ample opportunities for strong factions to force their way into power, and more events will be coming in the future. For now though, get involved by offering your services and your Commanders to the highest bidder, or the group who best aligns with your group’s values! 

&gt; Good luck Commanders!

&gt; ###UPDATE

&gt; ###The Dangerous Games - Pledges

&gt; The following groups have valiantly put their name forward for The Dangerous Games: Wildcard. They will go through a vote process to determine the top 5 groups. The groups who have put themselves forward so far (still pending checks that they have met the entry requirements) are...

&gt; * Achenar Immortals
&gt; * Black Birds Squadron
&gt; * The Imperial Inquisition
&gt; * Battle Vortex
&gt; * Planet Express",2016-04-15 19:31:39+00:00,d24dvhw,1.0,t3_4eycwh,410.0,EliteDangerous

3217,"&gt; ED has good quality, just not as much depth as some desired, although that could be an outdated perception.

As one of the mods over at /r/EliteDangerous, I would say the perception that ED is ""a mile wide, an inch deep"" is outdated.  To paraphrase the old statement:

* Following the updates 1.1-1.5: ""a mile wide, a foot deep"".
* For owners of Horizons: ""two miles wide, a couple of feet deep""
* And once [1.6/2.1](/r/EliteDangerous/comments/4exinj/elite_dangerous_newsletter_120_the_road_to_beta/d245vw9) arrive: ""one/two miles wide, a few yards deep""",2016-04-15 18:14:31+00:00,d24aein,4.0,t1_d247ixl,3749.0,starcitizen

Edit: copy &amp; paste of the summary list as linked by Another_Ape:

&gt; ###2.1 The Engineers, loot &amp; crafting:

&gt; * Engineers have their own backstory and specialization
&gt; * Engineers are spread throughout human space (initially ~30 engineers)
&gt; * (using loot) with engineers ""you will be able to improve and upgrade the stats on every module of your ship, and add rare, experimental effects to your weapons""
&gt; * Example: Laser that recharges Wing member shields upon friendly fire
&gt; * Player ranks/alignments/other parameters affect options offered to them by engineers
&gt; * There is a minimum requirement for player ranks/alignment/stats for using an engineer's service
&gt; * Engineers are found on isolated surface facilities
&gt; * ""Most Engineers are very secretive... and so you need an introduction, and need to find out how to find them""
&gt; * Missions can lead to introductions to Engineers
&gt; * Some Engineers will introduce you to others
&gt; * Wrecks will be added (unclear if surface only or space as well), loot and crafting gameplay will be associated with wrecks, concept art of SRV scanning data recorder in wreck was shown

&gt; ###1.6 General changes:

&gt; * Persistent, mostly generated NPCs will be added: mission givers + engineers, will have some form of mug shots based on the future commander creator/character editor
&gt; * Relationship with minor faction will determine which character will be mission giver
&gt; * NPCs will give feedback about the situation of a minor faction and ways to support them
&gt; * Options screen will have collapsible sections for easier navigation
&gt; * Adding new huge and large weapons (concept for large+huge multicannon shown)
&gt; * huge beam laser
&gt; * huge pulse laser
&gt; * huge multi-cannons
&gt; * large multi-cannons
&gt; * Missiles getting revamp, won't penetrate, but can damage multiple external modules (drives, utilities, hardpoints), minor increase to shield damage 
&gt; * Asteroid graphical fidelity improvements
&gt; * Star light has been fixed so that it retains its colour over distance
&gt; * Bookmarks will be added 
&gt; * Systems/planets/stations/asteroids can be bookmarked
&gt; * Bookmarks have a custom text, can be edited and deleted
&gt; * Bookmarks will be visible on the galaxy map and can be selected as navigation target in route planner
&gt; * SRVs will leave tire tracks on planet surfaces 
&gt; * Community goals will be marked on the galaxy map and system map, will also appear on any bulleting board regardless of system
&gt; * Community goals may have multiple commodities involved.
&gt; * ""Revamp"" of outfitting screen, different classes have different purposes, will become more clear 


&gt; ###1.6 AI changes/fixes:

&gt; * Flatter difficulty curve for low rank NPCs, more challenging high rank opponents
effective missile + torpedo usage at high ranks (when opponent shields are down)
&gt; * Increased damage avoidance by high rank AIs
&gt; * High rank AIs flee for recharging shields before attacking again
&gt; * High rank AIs will try to counter players who use the reverse thrust tactic
&gt; * AI can't use energy weapons when overheating anymore
chaff spam decreased, only using chaff when taking damage from turrets/gimbals
&gt; * AI doesn't get stuck rotationg in one place anymore
&gt; * No more hatch breaker spam
&gt; * Better pip management for fleeing and pursuing
&gt; * Scan &amp; ram: ""As far as I am aware, the fix for this issue should be included with 2.1.""



&gt; ###1.6 Changes for/to missions grouped by broad high level concepts:

&gt; #####Personalisation

&gt; * persistent mission givers, treatment of player depends on player ranks/reputation/alignment
&gt; * Docking greeting messages change depending on alignment/rank
&gt; * NPCs remember having had contact with the player before
&gt; * NPCs inform player about the status of a faction (civil war etc.)
&gt; * NPCs inform player about the effects their actions are having (status changes for minor factions)
&gt; * Mission selection improved depending on a factions status

&gt; #####Progression

&gt; * One additional positive alignment level will be added to faction alignment (Hated, Disliked, Neutral, Liked, Allied, +?)
&gt; * The mission board in station services replaces the old bulletin board
&gt; * Expanding the functionality of the inbox so that messages will persist

&gt; #####Variety

&gt; * More missions are available at the neutral reputation stage
&gt; * Rank requirement for missions are removed - the rank will now be an indication of difficulty + rewards
&gt; * Missions will be generated around players's Pilots Federation rank
&gt; * Three stage hierarchy governs mission generation:
&gt; * Minor faction state
&gt; * Market type at the port (e.g. mining missions in extraction economies)
&gt; * Government type of minor faction (e.g. dictatorships =&gt; overt assassinations)
&gt; * Missions will provide description why they have been offered and what effect their completion will have
&gt; * ""Barrier of inconvenience"" for some of the mission elements reviewed e.g. ""not having to drop out of supercruise to listen to alternate offers""
&gt; * ""The time limits for missions as well as which elements make them easier, or more difficult are being reviewed and addressed.""
&gt; * The cockpits will receive a clock
&gt; * USSs for missions will now generally be located at specific bodies within a system, not randomly spawned as time goes by
&gt; * Bodies with USS can be detected with the discovery scanner, normal range limits apply
&gt; * Nav beacons can be scanned (in normal flight) to receive system exploration data and to reveal mission locations
&gt; * USS placement depends on specific places like ""traffic lanes"" and ""hubs"" in a system
&gt; * USS can be scanned from supercruise to reveal more information about them!

&gt; #####Consequences

&gt; * Exact indication of influence isn’t (!) part of the mission changes (only indicates positive/negative impact) as of 2.1, unlike reputation and state changes, which are indicated
&gt; * ""With minor faction states we’re intending making their effects more noticeable on available missions, ship traffic and composition, and markets."" (Less subtle changes)
&gt; * ""authority response if they are attacked will be sharper.""

&gt; #####Rewards

&gt; * ""treasure"" locations as new additional mission reward type (missions may lead to cache with vouchers/other items =&gt; crafting! )
&gt; * Crafting materials as additional mission reward type as well as hard to obtain commodities and ""salvage only items"". Some commodities possibly only obtainable through missions. 
&gt; * ""varying rewards for effects on minor factions which are getting a balance pass to make changes in state more likely as well as more noticeable""
&gt; * ""rewards will be balanced to scale better with difficulty and also be more lucrative if you’re well regarded by the minor faction""
&gt; * ""conducting a pass through the mission templates to make them more reliable and address issues seen in the current build""
&gt; * ""adding more scenarios for the various mission types and also to better reflect the active states in the system""

&gt; ###Elite Dangerous Xbox One News

&gt; It’s an exciting time to be an Xbox One Commander as our cargo holds are brimming with Elite Dangerous Xbox One news. 

&gt; As you may have read earlier today we have our next major game update just around the corner. When this update goes live we have a number of additional changes coming for Xbox One. There will also be an additional Xbox One update happening in the coming weeks, which will contain some fixes and will also bring Paint Jobs and Game Extras to Xbox One Commanders.

&gt; By the next major 1.6 update Xbox One Commanders will be able to enjoy the following:

&gt; * Three new languages - bringing French, German and Russian text to Elite Dangerous on Xbox One.
&gt; * Private groups - Create and join Private Groups in Elite Dangerous on Xbox One. Using your Xbox One Gamertag you will be able to create a private group for up to 1,000 fellow Commanders. You’ll need to be following each other in order to gain access to that players group. 
&gt; * Customisable controls – Every button, including the context sensitive mapping can be changed. This long awaited feature will allow you to truly customise your own playing experience.
&gt; * Game Extras - Paint Jobs, Paint Job packs and other game extras such as Bobbleheads are coming to Commanders on Xbox One. Whether you’re an explorer, part of a pirate faction or a committed trade enthusiast, a large selection of colours, patterns and themes has you covered. Make sure to check out the details below for how the store will work! 

&gt; We’ve also got some exciting news to announce for Xbox One Commanders in the very near future, so keep a look out for the newsletter and on our social media channels for the latest information.

&gt; ###How Game Extras on Xbox One Will Work

&gt; As an Elite Dangerous player on Xbox One, you will be able to purchase Frontier Points on your Xbox One console and through the Xbox Store on your internet browser. It’s important to note that this isn’t a new currency we’re implementing anywhere else, and it can only be spent on game extras in our Frontier Xbox One store. 

&gt; With Frontier Points, Xbox One players will have access to the Elite Dangerous Frontier Store content exactly as it stands now for PC players, and all future additions to the store can be included at exactly the same time for Xbox One players, too. Using Frontier Points allows us to maintain parity across all of our products and platforms.

&gt; A quick example might help you understand Frontier Points: if Gary purchases 1000 Frontier Points at £9.99, he can then immediately spend those points on paint jobs and other game extras. He buys four paint jobs at 250 points each. 

&gt; We have some more exciting announcements that we’re looking forward to sharing with you. Keep your eyes peeled for more news and updates soon.",2016-04-15 10:51:00+00:00,d23txgv,1.0,t3_4ew3tg,1458.0,EliteDangerous

Yes, with one minor amendment ""1st infiltrated a private group **and/or** the streamer is taking part in a specific event or charity stream?"".

&gt; Ultimately it is not down to us to determine what we think the TOS means. I personally think its fine to post these videos to reddit and I'm fine with the mods allowing them to be posted based on what you think the TOS means.

&gt; Only frontier can determine if any transgressions were made in a). stream sniping and killing streamers and b). then posting footage of those (extremely entertaining I might add!) ganks.

3243,"&gt; A perfect example of this is deliberately attempting to disrupt public livestreams **such as the charity ones mentioned before**. This includes, but is not limited to, the capturing of footage and releasing it publically in an attempt to create upset or gain notoriety **through the actions listed above**.

I've bolded the two sections which directly refer to the previous paragraphs on the TOS page, therefore their context must also be included:

&gt; In light of recent issues relating to the way a small collective of players have been approaching and **targeting specific private groups and other community events** such as charity livestreams, we wanted to reinforce an important part of the existing rules regarding in-game harassment that every player agrees to when creating their account. 

&gt; If a player has been **blocked from a private group**, or a group/individual has taken **every step possible to remove a player from their gameplay**, then attempting to circumvent this in any fashion is a serious offense and action will be taken accordingly. **Attempting to re-establish contact with an individual who has blocked a player** through secondary accounts or other methods of attempting to evade the block are against the rules. Action can and will be taken against both the accounts in question and the main accounts of players that we deem to be harassing players through this method.

Now, the three paragraphs together describe **infiltrating Private Groups to disrupt a livestream event** - not limited to Charity (we haven't made a false assumption).  The video posted above, and the one yesterday, do not show evidence of Private Group infiltration, nor an event taking place.  This is the rule interpretation we have decided to take, because it's a clear rule that can be applied and enforced, and it also aligns with the ""Streaming in Open play"" warning FDev give.

If we were to take the stance that *just* disrupting *any* livestream (no private group or event requirement) breached the TOS, then that would lead to accusations of ""this person killed me while I was livestreaming.  TOS breach!"".

Again, as FDev said, **it's about context**.  Both these videos were in Open play (not Private Group), and weren't a specific event.  One was Wanted, the other not paying attention. They are simply videos of one CMDR killing another CMDR - and we certainly won't be classing that as breaching the TOS.",2016-04-15 08:45:17+00:00,d23rwi5,4.0,t1_d23pakl,8594.0,EliteDangerous

3286,"&gt; however i can not agree on your stance with idea threads, your reasoning behind why this forum doesn't need an unpopular opinions thread.

I'm unsure of what you mean.  Idea threads to discuss improvements to flaws already happen daily here, which is awesome.  An unpopular opinions thread implies discussions are generally blocked by the this community, which doesn't happen.

&gt; 1) what your asking for in an idea thread is almost unobtainable with out Frontier's permission and they wont give that information to the average user.

The stats and heatmap? FDev implementation is the only way they'll appear, so I'll keep pushing for them, as the community wants them added too.

I didn't say they weren't, and I've never said they aren't welcome.  A thread isn't necessary, as our community is free to express their constructive criticisms as they see fit :)

3. Play PvP instead of PvE - the flight-model is one of the best created for space games (bar Freespace 2).
4. As Star Citizen is currently an alpha/incomplete game, comparisons are foolish.  If anything, selling powerful ships - without a visible credit-earning economy in place - is either a cash-grab (ships are horribly overpriced compared to buying UEC for real money) or Pay-To-Win (where earning ships via missions, trading, etc will be a ridiculous grind).  
4b. Whereas ED's model allows CMDRs to play the game, and buy Seasons when the price/content ratio satisfies them.  The game is released, playable, and is widely regarded as the best for VR, and one of the best gaming experiences for Head-Tracking, HOTAS, Voice-control, etc.

&gt; ###6] What events or notable activities have Mobius been involved in?

&gt; While we may not have the equivalent of Community Goals influence, we have had in past, run Twitch competitions with paintjob &amp; bobblehead giveaways, we also have teams of players that take part in CQC Arena, (though nothing officially liaised with Mobius PvE community yet, we have to come up with a kick-ass team name). We would like to bury the stigma that none of our members have any 'real space' combat experience by winning a competition or two.

&gt; A true inhouse event for Mobius PvE has been the player pushed expansion of the in-game faction known as ""The Order Of Mobius"". 

&gt; This faction shares our real world group name, and many pilots have made the system Azrael their home base. 

&gt; Every time there is a conflict zone war for the in-game faction, many human pilots have been encouraged to go win us some influence in the system war. It provides great entertainment, especially when the TeamSpeak server is used and everyone is having fun in wings or solo and the communication can be 'free flowing' to be polite about it.

 

&gt; However, our mainstay and greatest contribution is the continual event of providing safe haven for players that do not wish to participate in PvP space but still retain a community and interaction with other players of the same mindset. 

&gt; While some members are brand new to the game, we also have many Commanders that have simply had enough of the killing and have been long term players of the game, and have come into Mobius with a view to share their experience. With this in mind, and to best leverage this abundant experience, we are trying to start up tutorial services to assist new players in their preferred professions of Trader/Combat/Explorer/Miner. 

 

&gt; In the end, we remind players that there is no final cut-scene, there is no boss-fight level 150, the goal is not always to make billions of credits, collect one of every ship, or get every permit and badge. The goal is to enjoy the game. It is encouraged and other members lend their advice, experience and humour to assist where possible to make the Mobius experience a good one.

 

&gt; -Commander Saberius

&gt; ###7] What’s next for Mobius?
 

&gt; Obviously we'd like to see our group grow so that even more Commanders get to experience ED in a friendly environment where the focus is on enjoying the game with other players.

 

&gt; We've got a few ideas for future activities, a Mobius focused podcast is something we've discussed, and our player faction has peaked the interest of a number of our group, so we are very interested to see how that works out.

 

&gt; However, to be perfectly honest, we are very much steered by our members, with such a diverse range of players and interests there is never a shortage of suggestions, be it for the group as whole, or for individual parts of our community. So our main focus is on continuing to provide an environment for people to enjoy the game in, supported by our social media channels and the great contributions of our fantastic community.

&gt; ###8] Anything you’d like to tell the community about?

&gt; The Elite Franchise has always been a pure PvE game up until this Version; it was always about the lone commander making their way across the galaxy while inventing their own story for being there.

&gt; Elite: Dangerous changes all that with multiplayer, some see this as an opportunity to make you their content while others see it as an opportunity to add content for others.

&gt; The MOBIUS ELITE PvE group offers players the opportunity to play with others while not being the content of others. Our private group of over 20,000 members is very friendly and pilots consider every other pilot they come across as a friend and ally. Hundreds of other groups use our group to role play in or to conduct group events in security. 

&gt; We have one simple rule that any intelligent player can follow and that is to not spoil another commander's game while playing within our group. 

&gt; Commanders wanting to join our PvE community have two choices as we have two groups. 

&gt; The ""MOBIUS PvE"" group caters for those in the AMERICAS time-zones, while the ""MOBIUS"" group hosts the EURO/APAC time-zones.

&gt; See you in the Black.

&gt; This week in the community spotlight, members of the PVE group Mobius tell us why they wanted to create the group, and why they wanted to make a space for players to interact in a friendly and productive way.

&gt; ###1] Mobius are one of the longest running Elite: Dangerous groups, what do you guys get up to? How have you lasted so long?
 
&gt; The secret to growing the group this large and lasting this long is very simple: We provide a safe and friendly environment for everyone to use but never tell our members what to do in it. The group's rules couldn't be simpler (basically don't spoil another's game), and inside of the group players are absolutely free to do whatever they want. From the start the group's motto has been ""Ut Quisque Est Sua"" (To each their own), and we believe this is the key to the group's success. 

&gt; Also, it seems that the group's policy acts as a filter and with a very few exception, from time to time, all our members prefer friendly interactions rather than confrontational ones. This reflects also on our forums at www. elitepve.com where you can find one of the friendliest community's I've ever seen. Only a rather small percentage of our members use the forums regularly (between 4000 and 4500) but those who do are always friendly and eager to help each other. We can count on one hand the times our moderators had to intervene. No doubt this is a non-negligible part of the group's success.

&gt; -Commander Flip Martin

&gt; ###2] How did you first start out? Tell us a little bit about your group’s history?

&gt; Our group came into life on August 31st 2014 and by the end of the second week we had passed 100 members. By the time the game launched in December 2014 we had over 1500 members and this was showing no sign of stopping. It was then obvious that our group wasn't going to be something small or that only a few players wanted to be part of it. This is when the community began to freely offer to help us grow, Commander Dexter Wolf got our Forums running and Commander Forked supplied a 400 slot TeamSpeak server. This was only the start of our community.

&gt; Over the following year, word-of-mouth attracted players to our group because we were a multiplayer group that didn't go around killing each other. Players in our group could now play elite the way they wanted to play it, the idea of playing alongside other players as opposed to playing against them was our greatest selling point. To continue growing our community, Cmdr Vulcor Created our Facebook group and it is currently managed by Commanders Andy Bulman, Saberius, DuckOfDeath and Xariann. Our Forum is supported by Commanders Flip Martin, JohnLuke, Xebeth, Emanon and UnmarkedBoxcar. When frontier announced Player Factions our community got together and created a faction for them to get behind and support, this is when ""The Order of Mobius"" was formed and is currently supported by Commanders Lase Mooray and Lion Freeman. 

&gt; Thanks to word-of-mouth, the Mobius group has become the default go-to group for multiplayer PvE and is now the largest in-game group.

&gt; -Commander Mobius

&gt; ###3] Congratulations on reaching 20,000 members. Is this something you thought would happen when you first started out? What does it mean for Mobius? How hard is it to manage a group that large?
 
&gt; Thanks, 20,000 is quite an achievement for a single group! When I first started the group I let commanders know that it was going to be a leaderless group, no one was going to be telling anyone what to do and all that was required was that members didn’t spoil another commander’s game.

&gt; I never set out to make a large group, it was something that just happened. As word spread about a dedicated PvE group players just signed up and continue to do so. Being the largest Group in Elite: Dangerous is something to be proud of. Though I maybe the founder of the group, the Mobius group is rightly owned by the PvE community, as without them the group simply wouldn’t exist.

&gt; You would think that managing a group of 20,000 would be difficult but surprisingly the group manages itself, players in our group all adhere to the group policy of not spoiling another commander’s game. Because we don’t tell others how they should play the game, hundreds of other groups have chosen to also operate within the Mobius Group knowing that if players fail to follow a simple group policy then they find that they are kicked and blocked from ever entering the group. This ensures that our group remains secure from undesirable players.

&gt; Frontier have been very supportive of our group. Each time we hit a technical issue with our group size, Frontier was quick to resolve it and even with our recent issue of hitting 20,000 members, Frontier was again very supportive and opened up a second account to expand our group into. We have since balanced both groups to ensure that they are equally populated and even having the two groups they are both still the largest private groups found in the game.

&gt; -Commander Mobius

&gt; ###4] What is it about Elite: Dangerous that keeps you coming back?

&gt; It has to be a combination of the sheer size and breadth of the game coupled with the great community in Mobius. I’ve played computer games for over 20 years, and generally you reach that point where you think, “well that’s it, done it all, seen it all”, but even after more than 14 months in Elite: Dangerous there is still loads of stuff I haven’t done, and of course more keeps getting added!

&gt; Then there is the Mobius community, being able to randomly wing-up with a complete stranger in a RES, or join with a group of like-minded Commanders in a CG or CZ just adds to the enjoyment and makes the galaxy feel alive. ED is one of those games where you get more out if you put more in, be it playing together in-game, or discussing load-outs, tactics, ships, or simply coming up with stupid things to do on our very active forum.

&gt; There is also the future to look forward to, what I’ve seen of the plans for the game are very exciting and bode well for an even greater experience.

&gt; -Commander Xebeth

&gt; ###5] What are your thoughts about the Elite: Dangerous Community?

&gt; The community on the whole is awesome, there are so many groups that are creating positive content for Elite: Dangerous like Lave Radio and tools like INARA that was tested within our PvE community before it went live to the public. We have the Twitch streamers, the Hutton Truckers with their quirky humour, and the Fuel Rats with their in-game support. Like us, these are the type of people that bring positive content to elite and are what makes the community great. Elite attracts all types of players, be that the Player that prefers to play alongside other commanders in a dedicated private PvE environment like ours, or those that enjoy the random PvP encounter in the open group. The game allows us to play in the way that we find enjoyable.

&gt; Our own PvE community is a beautiful sight with the way that players have banded together. Our minor faction in-game has had the opportunity to gain some real traction, which has been completely due to the community members really helping out. Having people come onto our forums to ask how they can help, even if they have only a small ship, has been amazing to see. In recent times the work of the community allowed the faction to expand into a neighbouring system, to which we are currently in our second war. For some people this has been their first real experience of working in a wing, it certainly has been mine (in a meaningful sense). Given the size of the galaxy it can sometimes be hard to come across another player, let alone one interested in winging up. Going into a combat zone as part of a wing (or joining one when you get in), having the chance to inform other CMDRs that a Clipper has turned up, watching as 4 ships pummel it and having the chat after when it is destroyed really makes you feel part of something bigger.

&gt; Another thing I have noticed as part of this war is when you see CMDRs in Supercruise. Previously there would be the hollow scanner marker and that was it, now you will get a ""o7"" or a ""Hello"". When the combat zones move, it is great working with another CMDR to find the new locations, then informing them of where to go. It is all this interaction that builds a real sense of community and community spirit. All I hope is that this time we win the war, there will probably be some partying going on in one of the stations!

&gt; We have a community that certainly tries to get everyone involved, in a way that they are comfortable with. Everyone has their own play style and if someone wants to help out, our community will help to find a way they can contribute. Giving advice on what will help the faction, where to trade, what ship is good for this or that, or how should I kit out that ship. All this is done with no one feeling their solution is 'the right one', just a different way.

I haven't done so here, therefore see above.

But we can improve it, and we will improve it.”

&gt; “There are missions out there I know almost no players have seen,” he says. “But we haven’t communicated it properly. There’s so much in there, and what we see from play patterns is that many do the same thing over and over. In that cycle, they just don’t get to see some of the variation. I’m not blaming players. We got it wrong.”

&gt; Braben adds that even when he was playing the game in a certain way, he wasn’t seeing everything. “I wasn’t making friends with the minor factions. I was missing out on missions. And most players do that,” he says. “It’s a shame, because the missions actually drive you around the galaxy. But if you keep going back to the same place, you won’t venture very far. We need to change the way we communicate that.”

&gt; The initial release of Elite: Dangerous doesn't mark the end of development. We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features.

&gt; #Everything you need to know about the Planet Coaster alpha

&gt; Hi Everyone,

&gt; We’ve put together this post to give you all the details you need for tomorrow’s Planet Coaster alpha release. If you have any additional questions that need answering, feel free to ask them as a reply to this thread and we’ll try and update the FAQ at the bottom the post. :)

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###How do I get access to the Planet Coaster alpha?

&gt; You need Planet Coaster Early-bird access. If you don’t already have it you can get it from the Frontier store by either purchasing the Early bird edition if you are a new customer which includes the full game at release and alpha access from tomorrow or by purchasing the Early bird upgrade if you have already pre ordered the game without Early bird access.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###What’s included in the alpha and how will it work? 

&gt; The Planet Coaster alpha is a very important part of the development process. Planet Coaster is the Coaster Park Simulation game we’ve always dreamt of making, and real-world player feedback is a vital part of that. In order to ensure that we get useful feedback on key areas of the game we will be releasing key features over the course of the alpha. These will fall into three phases, they are as follows.

&gt; * Phase 1: Modular building and Paths
&gt; * Phase 2: Adds Coaster Building and Landscape editing
&gt; * Phase 3: Adds Community Functionality and Blueprints

&gt; You’ll notice that the Coaster Building is placed in Phase 2. That’s because it is not yet finished to our satisfaction – there are several areas we will improve. However, the hands-on feedback from experienced players who have used it to date has been good, and we do realise you’ll want a coaster builder from the start of your Planet Coaster experience, so we added a cheat code for you to unlock the current state of the coaster building tools in the first alpha build!

&gt; For your ‘sneak peek’ at where we are with coaster building, simply follow these instructions: 

&gt; To access coaster building, open a map and select the ‘Rides’, ‘Scenery’ or ‘Buildings’ tab, then select the ‘Search’ option (a magnifying glass) and enter the code ‘underconstruction’ (all one word in lower case) to enable the coaster construction tab.

&gt; In addition to the key features we’ve mentioned above there are also a number of other things that will be included in the first phase of alpha such as some a selection of amusement rides, pre-built parks, shops, two themes (modern Planet Coaster and Pirate), and of course a Kraken!

&gt; As we enter the other phases of the alpha we may well add additional changes such as content, an increased (but not final) level of park management simulation and of course bug fixes and optimisations.

&gt; It’s really important to remember that this truly is a work-in-progress alpha. Which means that any plans we’ve mentioned could change based on the development process and player feedback. It also means that, whilst we have of course tested the release, you should not be surprised if you find bugs and issues within the game. If you do, please tell us! Your feedback is exactly why we are releasing the alpha builds - it allows us to make the game even better!

&gt; In order to access the alpha release you will need to log into the Frontier Store and then visit the ""My downloadable products"" where you will be able to download the launcher. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###How long will the alpha run for, will it end? And will there be a beta? 

&gt; It’s not possible to give an exact date right now for when each phase will be launched and when the full release will be (although we’re still aiming for Q4 2016). We are super passionate about taking on player feedback and we need to remain flexible to any development time that may require. However, we can confirm that all Early Bird owners will be able to play the most recent iteration of the alpha or beta between now and launch.

&gt; We currently expect a relatively short beta period close to launch, and we also expect there to be a couple of periods of down time right before both the start of beta and the launch to get the game and our servers ready. Apart from this, you should be able to play for the whole time, and we’re really looking forward to seeing your creations.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###What are the minimum specs required to play the Planet Coaster alpha? 

&gt; You will need the following minimum spec in order to play the alpha:

&gt; * Windows 7 64bit or newer
&gt; * Intel Core i5 -2300, AMD FX-4300 or better
&gt; * 8GB Ram
&gt; * Nvidia GTX 560 / ATI Radeon 7850 Graphics card with 2GB of Graphics Memory or better


&gt; It’s important to remember that this is an alpha and during that process there are both optimisations and new feature additions which can change minimum and recommended specs considerably. So these are likely to change over time.

&gt; We’ve had great feedback about how Planet Coaster is already looking, even in alpha. It will improve even further – we are developing a true leading edge AAA game, with high poly counts, sophisticated rendering, a deep simulation, many characters and incredible animations. The higher above the minimum spec your PC is, the more the game will be able to reward you with an improved experience.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###Can I share my save in Planet Coaster with a friend who also has alpha access? 

&gt; The community features are currently planned for phase 3 of the alpha process and there will be advanced, integrated ways to share content as part of that. However, for those who simply can’t wait to be sharing their builds there is a more tech savvy way of sharing your saves. Simply follow the steps below.

&gt; * Go into this folder where saved games are kept
&gt;    * C:\Users\*usersname*\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Planet Coaster
&gt; * Zip up the folder to then email on to your friends to share
&gt; * Your friend should then place the zipped up folder in the same directory on their machine
&gt; * Please note: the whole folder needs to be copied and sent, not just the save file within


&gt; After following these instructions you’ll be able to load your friend’s park in the same way you’d load a pre-existing park in the game.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###What controls do I need to know for the Planet Coaster alpha? Will there be a tutorial? 

&gt; There won’t be an in game tutorial or tool tips when the update goes live tomorrow. This is because the game will change and grow significantly from the current alpha phase of development. However, we have put together this [handy tutorial video](https://youtu.be/c60qDADjX7s) which shows you some of the cool features you will want to know about ahead of this first phase alpha build!

&gt; In addition we have an in-game controls help button in the top left corner that players will be able to access. It is displayed as a question mark and will list controls that players will find useful.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###Frequently Asked Questions

&gt; We’ve also had a number of other questions that should be added here to help ensure the most useful information possible. We hope to be adding to this section based on questions we receive on this thread so feel free to ask away.

&gt; * Q: Will the alpha be available on Steam. 
&gt; * A: The alpha will only be available from the Frontier Store. We aren’t able to confirm any details regarding Steam just yet but one thing is for sure if we launch on Steam we will make sure that everyone that has purchased on our store will have access to a steam code, should they wish to add it to their library. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; * Q: Will I be under NDA in the alpha?
&gt; * A: The alpha does not require any NDA or similar agreement, and you will be free to talk about it.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; * Q: Can I record my gameplay, upload to social media sites and generally share content publically?
&gt; * A: Yes, please do! We look forward to seeing your creations in action!

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; * Q: Will I be able to save my current park progress
&gt; * A: Yes, you’ll be able to save your park. In fact if you’re tech savvy you can even share that with friends (see the “sharing saves” section above) right from the start.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; * Q: Where would I submit feedback or a bug report?
&gt; * A: We’re adding an alpha feedback forum where we’d love to get your ideas, suggestions and game feedback. In addition you can post on our bug forum, for any bugs you’ve found in alpha. To view this forum make sure you are logged in with your store account and have Early Bird available on your account.

3457,"Copy &amp; paste of the forum post - most of the forum replies are praising the CMDR's piracy ideas, not the combat-logging (which I've reported to mods there):

&gt; #I do hope Season 2 helps Piracy - Today's experience just confirms to me it doesn't work very well...

&gt; So I thought I'd drop a couple of loads of Land Enrichment units off to Vennik today to kill 20mins...

&gt; As I was flying towards Nixon Enterprise station, I was interdicted by a CMDR who I could see was wanted, oh dear a pirate or griefer?

&gt; I submitted to the interdiction, so as to allow myself a quicker FSD cooldown, and as soon as we entered normal flight I was relieved to see terms issued by the pirate... Good! Not a mindless griefer!

&gt; Great I can ""play along"" and pay up! Piracy mechanics actually at work! He wanted 100T of cargo! Cool! He's stealing cargo off incoming traders to no doubt sell them probably not just for the profit, but also to even contribute towards the CG. Nice!

&gt; So fair enough I think... I'm already at a halt, but deploy my cargo scoop and landing gear as a sign of submission, and then go to type something to the effect that I will pay up...

&gt; While doing this, the other CMDR then starts to nudge me, and after not many more seconds then I'm being fired upon... Seems all bets are off now... Do I continue trying to type in a message to him? Do I scoot over to the right hand panel and faff about handing over cargo? Do I still trust him as a ""legit pirate"" and not just a griefer?


&gt; So here we have the pirate mechanics showing their fragility, or in truth basic lack of existence:-

&gt; * No easy way to say, ""Don't shoot I comply!""
&gt; * No easy way to pay up to the demand... Faffing about in the right hand panel in a short amount of time, while under threat of fire?
&gt; * A 15 second EXIT from the game, which risks a pirate thinking any inactivity is the victim about to teleport (EXIT) out.

&gt; So frustrated that my best efforts to ""play along"" having failed... Annoyed that I could have just have taken the EXIT option for an better outcome most likely... I can't even be bothered to press ""J"" to jump, so I just ""pull the plug"" - I can't be bothered to faff now, or worse still die due to what I perceive as a daft frustrating misunderstanding due to the poor mechanics.

&gt; However, I then enter into the game ASAP again, back into OPEN, in the hope he's still there in that location/instance so I can catch the CMDR to hopefully try again, and make the mechanics work! I want to be pirated! I want the game to work!!!

&gt; The moment I appear, I'm under fire... Clearly the other CMDR is frustrated at the way his interdiction has gone... I ""pull the plug again"", but enter in ASAP yet again, desperately hoping a third attempt might end in me being able to actually do this ""properly"" and simply hand over the 100T of cargo. Alas, the moment I appear, I'm under fire again...

&gt; I give up, and go to SOLO, where of course none of these problems exist... (as such)




&gt; Now other times I've been pirated - ignoring griefers - it has managed to work at times, but undoubtably many Pirates are quicker to shoot than they'd like (or should) simply because the game doesn't orchestrate/control/help piracy. And of course ""victims"" are always wary due to the number of ""griefers"" simply flying ""pirate colours""...

&gt; * Give better coms?

&gt; * Allow a pirate to dictate their terms?

&gt; * Maybe even allow a victim to ""offer an I surrender"" mode?

&gt; * Maybe allow a victim to more easy pay the demands, without having to faff in the right hand panel, all the time which the Pirate is thinking, they're exiting the game...

&gt; * Maybe increase the ESCAPE time to 20-30 seconds so pirates are no paranoid about 5 seconds of lack of activity/coms?

&gt; * Maybe if you press ESCAPE and are trying to exist the game, show the countdown in game to all other players... ie: So a Pirate can see you are trying to sneak out via this mechanic.

&gt; * Allow a rank/score for the pirate to show (victims) how good they are at their trade. Getting cargo, no mindless destruction.


&gt; It just frustrates the hell out of me I want to play in Open and actually don't mind being ""pirated"". I want to see the game working and ""alive"". But the game is so weak in this area, it drives me go to SOLO just to skip these frustrations and not suffer due to the misunderstandings and resultant faff 


&gt; Note: Criticize if you must for ""pulling the plug"". But frankly, IMHO, if the game is running under flawed ill-considered mechanics, and even my best attempts cannot make it work correctly, I give up! Getting attacked (or destroyed) because the game can't ""facilitate a piracy transaction"" between to willing participants just does my head in!?

&gt; Note: I actually caught the CMDR later on for a chat, and explained I was actually trying to pay when he misconstrued my inactivity as an EXIT attempt, if only to make him feel less frustrated by the whole debacle 



&gt; This is of course not a unique post. Many people have posted their suggestions to improve/tighten up piracy. I do hope something is planned... I want to see a logical and workable mechanic in action! It has to work for the TRADER --&gt; PIRATE ---&gt; BOUNTY HUNTER food chain to even stand a chance of working as it could/should.",2016-03-22 08:39:59+00:00,d18x6l6,1.0,t3_4bgiik,2962.0,EliteDangerous

3510,"*[C&amp;P for the firewalled]*

Number of discussions around the forum regarding the P2P networking nature of the game and wanted to give some basic support to other players.

(Network engineers, Server admins and general geeks can ignore )

#Quick basic Network 101:

In general:

* If you start the conversation from your computer to the internet (like browse to a web site; check email; etc) as **you initiated** the conversation your router (normally provided by your ISP) will allow the conversation to work. The reply from the internet - results of your browsing / your Inbox / etc. are allowed back to your PC as the ISP device knows you asked for it.
* If you didn't start the conversation though and receive some data by default your router will block it.

This is to protect your PC at home from unwanted connections (attacks)

#How other games work:

Your normal multi-player games, like Diablo 3 / BF / WoW etc use a P2S model (Peer to Server) - the games company uses centralised servers and hosts the game along with your character. **You initiate the connection** to the server and it replies back with the results. Everything just works ! Your actions in game are performed on the server itself - all you are doing is instructing the server what to do and it replies back with the results.

**Note:** This is why combat logging on these types of game can be stopped - the server hosts your character and if you combat log (suddenly disconnect from the game) they can hold your character in game for a period of time.

#Elite Dangerous is different:

It uses some P2S links (login, mode selection, some character based transactions like buying / selling, etc) but in order to cut down on bandwidth, costs, and a whole host of other things Frontier decided to also use P2P (Peer to Peer) links. When you are about to meet another player in game you both need to set up a direct P2P connection to each other. Over this link you send information about what you're doing in space (moving, firing, etc) and generally it works quite well.

**Note:** This is why combat logging in ED can't be stopped. Your PC hosts your character (with some server validation) and if you combat log (suddenly disconnect from the game) there isn't a server hosting you to continue presenting it to the other player. The P2P link drops and the other player has no information about you any more.

This is where the problem starts for many people:

* If you initiate the conversation to set up the P2P link to the other player there isn't a problem for you - outbound is always allowed
* If they initiate the link, then remember as you didn't initiate it your ISP router will block it by default.

#How do Frontier get round this problem ?

Frontier can fix this in one of 2 ways, both available now in ED:

* They can use uPnP (default setting)
* They can use port forwarding

uPnP is supported by most ISP devices and technically it should work. It's a networking method of allowing unsolicited connections inbound from other players (IE you didn't start the P2P link but you told your router it was OK and it allows it to work) However, for it to work there are 2 things that have to be right : your ISP device &amp; your PC. If one of them is wrong then uPnP won't work and you generally wont meet many people in ED if at all.

Remember though if you initiate the P2P link then technically even with a faulty uPnP setup it should work. You have no control over who initiates that link (AFAIK) which might explain why some people can see everyone and others only a subset (discounting bugs and things in ED :D)

#How can check yourself if uPnP is working on your computer:

* Check this [LINK](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001367.htm) - describes some settings on your computer (windows)
* A better option if you trust MajorGeeks (I do) is to download this software and run it - [LINK](http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/universal_plug_and_play_tester_\(upnptest\).html) - it does some tests and can enable services if they are disabled.


Sometimes the problem will be with your ISP router - it may just be too old or buggy :(

#What if you can't fix uPnP - Port Forwarding:

You can change to use port-forwarding but unless you understand what you are doing it can be a little complex and beyond what I wanted to describe in this thread.

In short - 3 changes: 

* Alter a configuration file located in the ED folder to use ports and not the uPnP service (AppConfig.xml)
* Change your ISP router and enable port-forwarding
* Allow traffic in and out through that port on your PC through any firewall you have installed

There are plenty of guides on the internet that describe how to do this (for example [HERE](http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-Port-Forwarding-on-a-Router) [HERE](http://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/) etc) If you are not sure then you need to find the right guide for your router - check the manufacturers website.


#Final comment:

Ideally I would like FD to do 2 things in the Elite Dangerous menus that I feel would massively help players &amp; their own support staff:

* Enable a toggle to switch between uPnP and Port-Forwarding (to make it easier - the router is your responsibility though)
* Enable a test button to determine if your set up is actually working inbound by FD initiating a test P2P link*

Good luck :)

&amp;nbsp;

^( *I know you can see that you're connected to the server on the main screen but AFAIK that's using the P2S links to the Frontier servers.)",2016-03-16 17:21:37+00:00,d126f7s,1.0,t3_4aot4o,85.0,EliteDangerous

3517,"&gt; Any intelligent person wouldn't need clarification to see your claim was completely false. FD's last trading update was 100% clear that Engineer's would not be released this April.

Yet the wording was enough to confuse enough community members. I'm sure you'll remember from the day the news initially broke.

&gt; Eh, why??? It's irrelevant to your dissemination of a false Engineers release date.

It brought clear communication from FDev's CEO that minor updates *would* be released prior to 2.1.  Which of course include native Oculus VR support.  You may have read about that.

&gt; This is factually complete cr*p as anyone with the slightest knowledge of FD's dire financial state will agree. FD will pay no tax because it is making massive losses.

3519,"&gt; Aren't you the guy who recently falsely announced ""2.1 Engineers is scheduled for release in April""

An intelligent person would see that my post was phrased appropriately to ensure that clarification was sought and received from Official sources as quick as possible.  Having four separate forum moderators respond within the first page shows I gained the attention of FDev.

As a moderator of this independent subreddit I like to keep our community as informed as possible.  Official statements that are vague will breed discontent amongst the community - it's best to clarify any points that are too vague.

Also, see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/48mcv8/bad_news_cmdrs_no_new_fixes_until_next_planned/d0lzh62) (you'll recognise the OP).  Multiple major gaming media websites linked that thread as part of a story.  FDev nipped it in the bud within 24hr.  Hopefully less miscommunication will slip out.  No harm done though, free publicity for the game, and a huge marketing bonus when the official VR announcement arrived last week, countering previous fears.

And what he *actually* said was (with full context):

&gt; Q: You’ve stated that the networking solution, mixing peer to peer and servers, is already in place. Is this something though that is going to involve long-term financial support after launch from Frontier to keep the Elite: Dangerous universe running?

&gt; A: Yes, and we’re planning ways of doing that. I’m always concerned with games that are server-based that you can’t then play them after the publisher or whoever turns the servers off. We’ll structure it in a way that you could play it entirely locally, so it would survive time if that makes sense.

3565,"&gt; I'll shrug off the fact you're calling me foolish for investing in FD's product on ""good faith"". 

I wasn't.

&gt; The rough part is, I did fund them at a higher dollar value than retail, I just didn't pick the ""lifetime"" package.

As I said, that was your choice.

&gt; Maybe I'm the fool for that, and maybe one of us is grinding the same broken missions after a year and still defending the developer/investment.

Grinding = doing something that you don't find fun, repeatedly, to increase something (XP, level, credits). Apart from mining which I tried and didn't like, I've enjoyed everything in-game, and never seen the need to repeat the same actions over-and-over.

&gt; Do you really believe the product they delivered last year reflected their KS, marketing, and forum posts?

* KS &amp; marketing = yes
* Forum posts = which ones?  There were quite a few...",2016-03-11 23:28:25+00:00,d0wkqin,7.0,t1_d0wkmpm,186.0,EliteDangerous

3567,"False analogy.  Alternatively:

&gt; You go to sandwich shop, order a meatball sub. The clerk charges you $4.99, tells you it'll be ready soon.

&gt; The timer dings, he hands you a meatball sub. On the menu you saw ""coming soon, 1yr after meatballs: jalapenos"" and foolishly thought they would be added immediately, for free.  You also saw ""a free sub every year for life, with new ingredients as they arrive"" for $15, but ignored it.

&gt; When the jalapenos arrive 1 year later, he begins work on a meatball &amp; jalapeno sub, hands it to the guy in line behind you. The guy hands him $4.99.

&gt; You ask him where your jalapenos are, at that point he tells you:

&gt; ""Meatball &amp; jalapeno subs are $4.99, and I appreciate your previous business that helped us get here. Meatball subs have been available for a year, and so now I'm adding a new ingredient.  If you don't want jalapenos, you don't have to pay anything more than $1.99 for a meatball sub.  Did you enjoy your sub from last year?

&amp;nbsp;
***
&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Them saying they'll focus on it after the initial release, and selling it to us a year later aren't really the same thing are they?

Yes, especially as one of the dev updates during KS stated that the first expansion would be released within a year of the initial release.

Furthermore, £80 pledge tiers and higher gave ALL expansions free.  You made the choice not to fund high enough.",2016-03-11 22:53:12+00:00,d0wjiju,5.0,t1_d0wj3ne,685.0,EliteDangerous

3569,"we can land on planets, if you buy the expansion season - as promised in the kickstarter under Future Plans: 

&gt; The initial release of Elite: Dangerous doesn't mark the end of development. We intend to continue **expanding the game** both with new content and new features. A good **example of this is planetary landings**. We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add leaving the ships so you can explore space stations or board enemy vessels or even just to look around your own.

&gt; The main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.

&gt; **Really big expansions are likely to be paid for** while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to £80 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.

And in the FAQ at the bottom:

&gt; Can I land on planets?

&gt; Yes, but **not in the initial release.** Our aim is to make planetary landings a much richer experience than ever before and that requires considerable development effort.

By the current ruleset, if they're near identical, yes (per 24hr).

&gt; But also ask yourself if the community, whose interests you serve, has a problem with a user posting an E:D related screenshot showing an extremely high level of dedication.

We received two anonymous reports about the submission stating ""duplicate post within 24hr"".  I saw that it was a near duplicate post within 24hr of another, inspired a discussion of 4 comments (1 from this thread's OP), 83% upvotes (from 30 votes total), and at the time of removal hadn't received a new comment for 8 hours.

The overall community clearly had chosen to engage in discussion within this thread instead, while the other had died off.  Keeping it in the *New* feed served no beneficial purpose to the overall community, except showing a breach of the No Duplicates rule.

3647,"[Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-03-no-mans-sky-questions-answered) say it best:

&gt; There's a magic to No Man's Sky, one reminiscent of other mystical space-faring adventures such as Star Raiders or Noctis: the kinds of games you'd glimpse in a few stolen hours around a friend's house and then dream about for months afterwards. It's a slow game, and if you're playing aggressively it seems that it can be a clunky and frustrating one at times. This isn't going to be for everyone - the systems, as abundant as they may be, may well run dry for most players after a mere handful of hours, and many more may find that space is too empty, too meaningless, despite Hello Games' best efforts to fill it with some sense of purpose.

&gt; What's left at that point? Nothing but the beauty of it all, and the fantasy of getting in your ship and heading to the skies, pointing it somewhere, anywhere, you care to go. No Man's Sky probably isn't going to satisfy all those drawn in by its spectacular premise, and by that intoxicating reveal; it's too weird, too different, to ever really do so. What it does, though, is deliver on the promise of that initial trailer. It's a proper sci-fi game - at times strange, lonely and cold, yet full of heart-lifting spectacle. And that, for me, is more than enough.

Also, the lack of substantial multiplayer means it'll be a ~30hr experience for me at most.",2016-03-04 10:35:24+00:00,d0n76ad,1.0,t3_48wr57,1808.0,EliteDangerous

3658,"Please remove the direct tag to the CEO who's not currently in this thread - it's rude.  Tag one of the community team if you feel it necessary.

I agree that the playerbase should be getting much better and clearer communications.

However, on the topic of CIG and Star Citizen information being perceived as better, you may want to look up their communications of:

* Star Marine delays - CRoberts is annoyed that the community ask about it, despite it being 10 months overdue and heavily promoted for a year.
* Substantial ship design changes - the community weren't informed despite said ships being still on sale, while Ben is annoyed that the community expect to be informed.
* Continual missing of deadlines - 2.1 due December and 2.2 due Jan (1 update per month cycle was touted in November), Starliner two months late.
* feature postponing or removal - no Sq42 campaign co-op, ""we'll only start thinking about offline servers after release"".

CIG release a huge amount of videos, and while they have a lot of padding (""this week the audio team recording some sounds for ShipA"") I would definitely like FDev to communicate more about their development.

The weekly Dev Updates (when active) are great but more information is needed - concept art, specific tasks (""this mission type is being worked on"", ""BGS dynamics being looked at"", ""missile balance""), interviews and Q&amp;As with the team, etc.",2016-03-03 15:22:08+00:00,d0m2kym,2.0,t1_d0m1ah7,2037.0,EliteDangerous
3659,"&gt; multicrew - fucking seriously rad (run around the interior of a big ship while in flight too)

Running around a ship's interior for me was fun for about 30 seconds.  Nothing to do except go from A to B, with the odd two-second immersion-animation, which really grates after the dozenth time.

&gt; Yaw rate - 'nuff said.

Design choice of both games for small sized ships.  Larger ships in SC yaw &amp; roll slower than the fighters.  Currently flyable ships are much larger in ED: Cobra Mk3 ~= Redeemer, FedCorvette ~= Reclaimer. Also, fast/slow yaw is not content.

&gt; mission arch - WOW a real recon sortie with a little lore and narration

ED's missions each have some Minor Faction-related lore.  Vocal narration is the strong point for SC here.  Otherwise it's standard fare: go somewhere, shoot ships, perhaps push a button; rinse-repeat.  Will there be tens of thousands of dialogue recorded for SC to be varied enough to be not tedious?  Or are the audio-missions only for Sq42?

&gt; and this is how you know StuartGT may not be trustworthy here.

You may want to elaborate further on this.

&gt; dedicated repair, refueling, restocking dock at Cry-Astro station (omg something convenient and putting you back in the saddle for fun all fast? :/ what a concept)

Same for ED: land at a station, outpost or planetary base, and repair/refuel/rearm in seconds.

&gt; SYSTEM TRAVEL - WAY more interesting inter-system mechanics imagine no supercruise, just enter the system, and jump to the station or location you want

Currently QD travel in SC is restricted to one planet, its three moons and some orbiting POIs.  In his recent BBC interview, CRoberts said that by the end of 2016 we'll be able to travel to other systems, via jump points.

At max QD (0.2c) it'll take 7 minutes to travel from Earth to the Sun, 28 minutes from Earth to Jupiter - realistic scales of course, SC could scale (fake) system sizes.  Supercruise is *much* faster, with added opportunities for interdictions and Signal Sources.

3740,"As the text-post title is misleading, here are some clarifications:

* The forum thread's opening post (copied above) was created 9 days ago.
* The OP here is not the OP on the forums.
* ""Invasion"" refers to CMDRs of Smiling Dog Crew attacking CMDRs in the Mobius private group.

Here is [Zac's mentioned response](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/46erkx/smiling_dog_crew_presents_okinura_community_goal/d04kbrc), since the OP omitted it:

&gt; Hey guys,  

&gt; It's really disappointing to see players actively griefing other players. The fact of the matter here is that Mobius is a private group where players decide to come together and play in a specific way. The idea that someone decides they want to be disruptive without any real reason or gain is a shame.  

&gt; However, ""griefing"" in itself isn't against the rules. There is no evidence that I can see that suggests that the players in question altered the game in any way in order to gain an unfair advantage. In addition, groups are made in a way that allow players to join together and play in a way they want. However, it is the admins of those groups that manage which Commanders have access to the group and which do not.  

&gt; It is something that David Braben and the developers are aware of though. Only recently I heard David answer a question on this subject in a community interview and I know that it's something that has/is considered by the developers, and I know that creating a friendly and enjoyable game experience is something that is taken very seriously.  

&gt; I should also mention, the offending players have been removed from the Mobius group. I know this because the Mobius admins got in touch when there were some technical difficulties with managing their group permissions to remove these members from the groups. The members were successfully removed and the technical issues have been resolved.  

&gt; On a personal level, I must say, on the most part we see community members taking part in PVP or roleplaying piracy in a way that works for everyone. If a trader is stopped and asked to drop their cargo, they feel better for the experience and not having to rebuy their ship - That player is more likely to continue to trade. The pirate can then plunder another day.  

&gt; It isn’t piracy if a player deliberately tries to ruin another player’s experience. It is unfortunate to see players trying and taking pride in this kind of experience.",2016-02-27 15:51:02+00:00,d0fuj6p,1.0,t3_47va65,3589.0,EliteDangerous

3877,"&gt; So linking to the direct imgur page, with the full gif displayed (and still works with hover-over extensions) doesn't gain traction?

Correct - due to tablets, smartphones, and browsers with hover-over extension disabled or not installed.  Embedded links are immediately accessible to /r/gaming (and consequently /r/all) users.

&gt; Maybe I'm just naive but I really don't see how it makes any difference. 

Unfortunately it does.  Other subreddits work differently, however this one is the most popular for games by a huge margin.

&gt; Still, people can click to look at the main page and there's nothing there linking the videos, the names of the people and groups who organised it.  And in your belatedly edited post which isn't even close to the top, you linked the video yes, but didn't mention Distant Worlds or anything.

It now mentions Distant Worlds, but the rest was unavoidable.  Top comments are voted for by the community.

&gt; Look your not apologising or anything, just perpetually trying to justify why I shouldn't have any beef. I'm giving up now.

I've offered my apologies to Erimus One, the content creator.

&gt; Again, thanks for the exposure, just wish it could have been handled better. Right now there's a gif going round the internet of some ships jumping. Those clicking the actual reddit will know ""Elite Dangerous"" and nothing more. Shame, such a wasted opportunity.

Those that visited /r/EliteDangerous during the enormous exposure will have seen the many Distant Worlds content posts there, top-voted by our CMDR community.  As new redditors and subscribed CMDRs visit the sub in future, they'll continue to see content posts relating to the expedition, as CMDRs post news of their travels towards Beagle Point.

Best of luck in your continued adventures :)",2016-02-21 07:27:23+00:00,d07x8e4,8.0,t1_d07wf1u,2434.0,gaming
3878,"&gt; I do take issue with your grabbing without permission

Understandable, and I should have contacted Erimus One for permission first, for which I've offered my apologies via their YT account.

&gt; and linking to i.imgur instead of the direct page... We could have linked to the game store there too

To reiterate, only quality content embedded in Reddit links (immediately accessible) gain traction on /r/gaming, and are consequently upvoted and commented on increasing visibility.  External links are simply downvoted and skipped by this subreddit's community, due to the enormous volume of content posted here (thousands per day).

Furthermore, high quality gifv's are limited to 15 seconds, so for maximum impact I created a new gifv as opposed to using any of the original sources (full youtube footage, or the low quality gif's).

Meanwhile, ~10hr ago I edited my [topmost comment in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/46lznd/50_out_of_53_starships_hyperjumping_from_the/d066t7o), which is the most visible, to include the source video and credit as appropriate.",2016-02-21 06:30:01+00:00,d07w1pu,6.0,t1_d07vcbe,1821.0,gaming

* **Thousands of new potential CMDRs reached.**
* PM from Zac regarding the publicity: ""Hey Stuart its incredible, it really is.""

In summary, what I did:

* Took the most spectacular 15 seconds from Erimus One's video of the excellent, record-breaking event.
* Titled &amp; described it appropriately for Imgur, and published it.
* Titled it appropriately for /r/gaming: concise, snappy, and included game name.
* Created post at the start of peak viewing time.
* Once the post had gained traction (~20 minutes), messaged the [ED Discord](https://discord.gg/0V5hfT4eO8gB0nIz) community (300+ concurrent CMDRs) to help with replying to the many comments/questions about the game.
* Personally replied to ~100 comments about the game.
* Once it hit #2 in /r/gaming, also posted in /r/EliteDangerous to highlight CMDRs to help reply to game queries as well.

Well firstly, it was $45 to existing players.  And there was drama about the pricing.  Hence the drop to $38, and a sale price of $30 a week ago.

&gt; instead of introducing content further into their own game

Further content did arrive to the basegame (new ships and missions - some broken unfortunately) on Horizons' release, and will continue to arrive in the [upcoming 1.6 (available to all players)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/46f1ut/dev_update_18022016/): loot, weapons, and large revamps to missions, NPC characters, faction gameplay, and signal sources.  More improvements will arrive in further updates - 1.7, 1.8 etc - while Horizons (as per the expansions promised in the Kickstarter) will gain other additions.

&gt; H1Z1 split into two game modes for $20 and people are freaking out.

It was originally free-to-play, with pay-to-win drop boxes.

&gt; Why aren't people mad that Elite Dangerous literally just made them pay twice full price

Choose to buy =/= made to buy.  The game continues without the expansion, which was 75% (of full price) on release, and will continue to drop in price during 2016, likely to $15 in Winter.

&gt; for content that should have been put into the original game?

&gt; #- The Gladiators Challenge -

&gt; During the first four weeks after the launch of Arena (16 February to 15 March), three named accounts beginning with ‘FDEV’ will be playing CQC on an ad hoc, but regular, basis. 

&gt; If you manage to get in a game with them, and take a screenshot, you will be entered into a prize draw. There will be 5 amazing prizes up for grabs in the draw including...

&gt; * 2 x Premium Elite Dangerous goodie bags, including a cap, a beanie, three faction mugs, signed artwork.
&gt; * 2 x Elite Dangerous: Horizons Season passes.
&gt; * 1 x Every paint job in the Elite Dangerous store!

&gt; The draw will be done on March 16.

&gt; To be in the chance to win, all you have to do is get into a CQC match with either **FDEV Rhino, FDEV Wolf or FDEV Jet**, take a screenshot of you playing against them (perhaps the leaderboard at the end of the game), and email the screenshot to **community@frontier.co.uk** with the subject line **‘CQC Gladiators’**. Your email address will be added to the list of entries, and winners will be drawn at random at the end of the four weeks.

If the system has a nav beacon then these can now be scanned and the scan will reveal these mission locations as well as providing any exploration data for that system.  

&gt; There are now concepts of different parts of space within a system, like traffic lanes and hubs and different contents can be generated at each. They are also created spatially rather than by time range so you can no longer just sit and wait for one to appear, you will need to look for it.

The instancing player limit is 32.

/r/EliteRacers have regular events involving 20+ CMDRs in the same instance.

While ED doesn't have controllable space like in EVE, Player Groups often fight against each other in multiple-wing vs multiple-wing battles.  [Here's an 8vs8 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcjE1p2HKBo) from last week of two warparties scrapping, during which multiple CMDRs jumped out for repairs and back.

The instancing bugs relate to cheap/ISP routers or heavy firewalls (University networks) confusing the UPNP networking that ED uses for matchmaking - each update brings more CMDRs into successful instancing, but it's by no means perfect yet. 

Manually setting up Port Forwarding works flawlessly, assuming the CMDR's router fully supports it (some cheap/ISP routers don't).  Most CMDRs who enjoy PvP or Player Group activities do this, and so rarely have issues until 20+ global CMDRs are together - pings between Europe, USA, Australia, Russia, etc.",2016-02-12 21:51:15+00:00,czxt8gn,5.0,t1_czxq8c1,4460.0,Games

If your router(s) support port-forwarding, I'd advise [using that instead](https://support.frontier.co.uk/kb/faq.php?id=33), as it has the double-benefits of being more secure and stable when compared to UPNP.

Seriously though, what the one dev has [achieved in the time since 1999 is amazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wraith_(video_game_series)#Evochron_Legacy_.282016.29), and his passion for the genre and his own series is clear.

Unfortunately, the graphics/visuals in EL aren't anywhere near cutting edge, as he's simply limited by time for artistry.  Creating high-fidelity assets - models, graphics, textures and effects - the majority of gamers expect takes a ridiculous amount of time.

Ship creation for Star Citizen is a great example of this: their [open development process](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZgzbirTbLMj9oLJlMKYpefDo4cL430UQfmhy2HyUJU) shows how long it takes for said assets to be ready.  It's fair to say Chris Roberts has been surprised how long it takes his teams to create assets to the fidelity he wants - hence the large delays past his few announced timescales on flyable-ship releases.

Yes.

Not automatically. You have to manually request a Steam key from your FDevStore account, which only takes a second.

&gt; and how many people wouldnt instinctively add it to Steam, even if its still going through the same external system. People pay more for a key for something like GTA if its for Steam than direct to Rockstar.  Like you say, its not important, but i'd bet 3/4 of ED players will have added it because they can, the rest either seeing no point or arent playing it etc.

If you request a Steam key, or buy it from Steam, FDev pay Valve ~10-30% of the sale's revenue.

4217,"From my [Development Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/407t02/horizons_and_its_included_expansions_the_known/), these are the changes relating to Minor Factions and the BGS confirmed for 2.1 so far:

&gt; * Greater information feedback for Minor Faction interactions.
&gt; * Faces for specific NPC contacts like mission givers, in 2.1.
&gt; * The NPC contacts a CMDR will interact with depends on their reputation with the contact's Minor Faction.
&gt; * New mission board layout, better for working with Minor Factions, showing how they can be helped.
&gt; * NPC contacts will advise any changes in a Minor Faction's state, which also affects available mission types.

FDev go into more detail of each item, so feel free to check out the official sources linked in my post.

Also these are vague/broad improvements confirmed for sometime during Season 2:

&gt; * Improvements to mission generation, which is dependent on the current station's market.
&gt; * New military, ranking and Powerplay missions.
&gt; * More Community Goals to expand the human bubble.
&gt; * More differentiation between systems and stations, e.g. rundown station in a poor system.
&gt; * Community Goals to create new and upgrade planetary ports and settlements.
&gt; * Big improvements to Powerplay, involving non-pledged CMDRs, and the relationship with Minor Factions.
&gt; * Player-Group sponsored Minor Factions will have the opportunity to become a Power.
&gt; * Better population modelling and effects for Minor Factions.",2016-02-09 12:44:53+00:00,cztd4ji,1.0,t3_44w0k9,9189.0,EliteDangerous

At no point did FDev ever say that it would all be implemented, by the game's initial release or otherwise.  It's a *design* document archive, not an implementation/timescale/roadmap archive.  During Open Beta &amp; Gamma I was amazed by those who thought so many DDA features would get added in the 10 weeks to release :/

We're of course seeing more of the DDA being implemented this year, alongside Loot &amp; Crafting which was regularly requested by Alpha backers.

Ok, it's clear you're trolling as you're changing topics: *your* thread is about Horizons (expansion pack released ~2 months ago) being priced more than ED (released ~14 months ago), so why switch discussion onto your opinion of the first Season's updates?

4261,"&gt; You also forget their cancelled projects, like the Outsider.

I didn't need to, as that was [back in 2011](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/01/20/frontiers-the-outsider-has-been-cancelled/), cancelled by the publisher Codemasters.

&gt; But its cool. You keep making excuses and pretending everything is ok. You don't want to look up the information obviously, and you refuse to see the signs

If you have the impression that they don't have any money, I'd advise checking their latest [Trading Update](https://www.frontier.co.uk/investor_relations/reports/news/?artid=560&amp;pageNum=0&amp;blk=275): 1.4m units of ED sold, revenue for FY2016H1 up 50% on FY2015H1, £8.6m in cash reserves.

Planet Coaster begins its open Alpha in March, and is [already massively hyped](https://redd.it/42r6gl) as *the* upcoming themepark game, with [trailers and videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?q=planet+coaster&amp;sp=CAM%253D) of it already having a combined 800k+ views, 9 months before its expected release.

Everything looks good to me, unless you have sources that show otherwise :)

&gt; like the entire console release that was never planned.

Planned from the start, as per the Kickstarter page:

&gt; Q: Can you release “Elite: Dangerous” on the (iPhone/iPad/Console/Mac/Linux/Oculus Rift/Raspberry Pi) platform?  
&gt; A: Yes. It would be great. The PC version comes first though, and then we will look at the demand for other platforms. If the game exceeds its target, then there will be scope to increase the number of platforms. We will discuss with the backers in the design discussion forum, and how to address the issues that will arise, but I have every hope that we will cover some or all of these platforms.

ED's also coming to the [PS4 once Microsoft's timed-exclusivity expires](https://twitter.com/DavidBraben/status/573505047008444416), and there's a high chance of a SteamOS release too, given ED's status as one of the best AAA games with native SteamVR support available.",2016-02-05 15:18:37+00:00,czov8pl,13.0,t1_czonraw,21137.0,EliteDangerous

If you've seen the Dev Diaries, it's clear that the game has been in development for the past 2 years.  Compare it to RCTW whose 3rd Dev took over the project 9 months ago.

&gt; Why would positions become redundant when you add a project?

They didn't ""add"" a project; two projects ended/ing, one project announced (and as I've pointed out above, already on-going), one on-going (Elite Dangerous).  In project terms: that's two down, two still on-going.  In management terms: staff that can't transfer from the finished projects to the on-going ones, you make redundant - their job doesn't exist anymore.

Reasons for a business owner making staff redundant:

* Skills don't match a new projects' skill requirements. E.g. a tablet app coder isn't suited to engine coding, or a 2D artist is no good at 3D asset creation.
* Overheads of multiple locations aren't financially viable, compared to one location. E.g. closing Canada office: no need for two sets of admin &amp; finance, not to mention communication issues.
* Staff don't want to move from one location to another.  E.g. Canada to UK: understandable for a dev to say no from a family POV.",2016-02-05 00:23:29+00:00,czo86zl,11.0,t1_czo5ytw,3605.0,EliteDangerous

4315,"&gt; FDev announced their FPS module summer 2014 and SC's was in alpha before 2015.

Different development timescales of the two companies.

CIG announced their Galaxy of 30+ Star Systems in their 2012 Kickstarter, pushed up to 100+ in further crowdfunding, but we've yet to see more than a couple of planets.

&gt; It's been just under two years since FPS was announced. Find me some footage, friend. Any evidence at all besides the first announcement.

&gt; None? There you go. It's cut content by now.

Does that mean Star Citizen's 100+ star systems have been scrapped too?  Or its mechanics of trading and hauling cargo?  No it doesn't.

Both dev teams are working on different priorities and timescales.  FDev show us footage of upcoming features within 9 months of their release - if SpaceLegs is coming 2017 we won't see anything about it until August 2016.",2016-02-03 13:14:05+00:00,czm74qm,6.0,t1_czm1tvz,19596.0,EliteDangerous

* [Screamride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screamride) was in final testing in advance of its March release, published by Microsoft Studios for Xbox One.
* One ED developer - Ben Parry - left Cambridge as he moved up to Manchester for family reasons.  FDev arranged with CIG for him to transfer to F42. He regularly [posts on the ED forums](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/search.php?searchid=6920407).

Approved for discussion - the OP was reported by CMDRs for breaching the [EULA and TOS of Elite Dangerous](https://www.frontierstore.net/ed-eula/), but we have allowed the thread to stay open.

Combat Logging isn't **explicitly stated as not being permitted** in the above linked document, under sections ""3. Licence Restrictions"" or ""4. Acceptable Use Restrictions"".

However, it is, I quote,[**""counted as cheating""**](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=143287&amp;p=2201167&amp;viewfull=1#post2201167), which **IS covered** in TOS section 3(c), and [Frontier's stance on Combat Logging](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=105778) is as follows:

&gt; Hello Commanders!

&gt; This is a quick update to let you guys know what we’re looking at regarding the issue of “combat logging”.

&gt; For clarity’s sake, “combat logging” is when a Commander ungracefully exits the game (e.g. using ALT + F4 then shutting down the game process) to avoid defeat, destruction and damage. 

&gt; Commanders might use this exploit the moment they are interdicted or the moment before they are about to be destroyed.

&gt; Although this is flagged primarily as a multiplayer concern, the issues (and solutions) apply equally to the single player game.

&gt; First things first: we do consider this an undesirable exploit. It’s not “part of the game”.

&gt; Because we don’t have an all powerful server running the moment-to-moment game play simulation, there is no infallible arbiter to take control of a player’s ship when they ungracefully exit.

&gt; So what we’re doing is logging telemetry that will help us detect when this exploit is explicitly being used.

&gt; Right now, all we’re doing (and have already started doing) is looking at and implementing methods of collecting and analysing data. 

&gt; At some point, however, we will start to take action against Commanders using this exploit. I can only suggest that you should avoid using this exploit if you want to avoid any penalties issued for its use. I'll just repeat: please avoid combat logging - we're taking this issue very seriously.

&gt; On a related, but separate track, we’re looking at introducing benefits to Commanders that persevere and stick it out through dangerous encounters, as well as general credit costs and rewards balancing.

&gt; I’m not quite ready to talk about these in more detail just now. Obviously though, they can never counter the potential costs of ship destruction, but we want to look at a range of disincentives and incentives both to counter this issue.

&gt; I hope this helps clarify our position a little.

###Please keep your discussions civil and on topic :)

*Edited for clarity.*

4405,"Are you /u/u_r_s_u_s reincarnated?  I miss that user's amusing use of out-of-context information, and misquoting data and phrases.  You source and comment in such a similar fashion.  Anyway, let's get back to business...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; &gt; The Elite Dangerous franchise is the core game and Horizons, and 1.4m is the number of copies sold by end of 2015

&gt; That's not what the FD's statement says.

[The statement says this](https://www.frontier.co.uk/investor_relations/reports/news/?artid=560&amp;pageNum=0&amp;blk=275):

&gt; The Group’s Elite Dangerous franchise continues to perform well - at the end of December 2015 a total of 1.4 million paid units had been sold

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Where's your evidence that ""The Elite Dangerous franchise"" is the core game and Horizons, and not all other Elite Dangerous items on sale?

&gt; &gt; From the article you linked: ""We sold 1.2 million Elite Dangerous units up to the end of the half year in November"".

&gt; Doesn't say games, doesn't say copies.

It doesn't say items either - it says units.

A quick check shows FDev refer to game sales as ""units"" (shock) - [from the Year End accouncement](https://www.frontier.co.uk/investor_relations/reports/news/?artid=525&amp;pageNum=0&amp;blk=275):

&gt; At the end of August 2015 it had sold 825,000 paid units (excluding free ‘demo’ units)

&gt; Up to 31 August 2015 the Group had sold approximately 825,000 units of Elite Dangerous

Not ""T-Shirts with Elite Dangerous logo"", or ""Alliance Logo Mug"", but ""units of Elite Dangerous"".  There's only one thing called that: the game.

Note that at that time (August 31st), there were [~300k CMDRs on Steam](https://archive.is/IoGpw).  Following the various sales there are now ~750k CMDRs on Steam (ED+EDH) - 450k new Steam CMDRs.  825k+450k=1.275m... add on the new FDev store CMDRs since August 31st...

&amp;nbsp;

You're the only person inferring that ""units = copies + merchandise items"", while the rest of us including the gaming media see ""units = copies"".  Is this because most of your other negative statements so far have been shown to be flawed or simply false, so you're looking for issues where there aren't any?",2016-01-28 18:10:21+00:00,czfd8jw,15.0,t1_czfaz8e,3109.0,EliteDangerous

The Elite Dangerous franchise is the core game and Horizons, and 1.4m is the number of copies sold by end of 2015 - I thought that was relatively straightforward.

From the article you linked: ""We sold 1.2 million Elite Dangerous units up to the end of the half year in November"".

Planet Coaster is their second franchise, also mentioned in the linked document.

You can see the numbers of Steam ED &amp; EDH players by looking at Steamspy &amp; Steamcharts. Record Steam average was reached (7.5k) during Christmas holidays, and all time peak concurrent of 18k was during Black Friday (average hit 6.5k that weekend).",2016-01-28 12:11:51+00:00,czf0zf7,13.0,t1_czeqc5q,30699.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; Xbox One moderator Rhys Constance stops by to tell us all about his life as a moderator on the [XBox One Subreddit](/r/xboxone), and why he loves Elite Dangerous so much.

&gt; ###What is your involvement in the Xbox One Reddit?

&gt; I am a moderator there. I help moderate the forums, organize game nights, giveaways, AMAs and events as well as manage the wiki pages, which include a list of all current and upcoming games for the subreddit and several other topics. Oh, and the twitter account too!

&gt; ###You’ve showcased Elite Dangerous a few times on the front page, can you give us an example of a few things you’ve done to help us out? Why do you get involved?

&gt; We have held 2 separate AMA’s (One with David Braben and one with the rest of the Xbox One team), done 2 different skins for the subreddit and we have ran 3 really awesome contests. My favorite was the “take a selfie while playing Elite: Dangerous” contest. The entrants were hilarious!  

&gt; We do these things because our community wants them. We are on a mission to be the best Subreddit on the internet, and we go out of our way to obtain and curate the best content for our subscribers wherever we can. There was loads of positive buzz and curiosity on the subreddit surrounding Elite: Dangerous in its early stages (It was the first game in the Game Preview Program) – So I reached out to Frontier to see if we could work out something awesome! Luckily for us and our community, you thought this was a fantastic idea.

&gt; ###Tell us about the Master Chefs and how that came to be?

&gt; This is my favorite thing ever. 

&gt; Zac from Frontier approached me, saying that he wanted to do something REALLY special for our subredditors to celebrate launch day. After a little back and forth, we decided it would be amazing to have our very own rare trade good inserted into the game! I made a contest thread and stated that the most highly voted suggestion would win.

&gt; A subscriber by the name of dmorg18 wrote up a hilarious parody of the Halo series main character, The Master Chief, altering the games story were toward culinary warfare. The Master Chefs were born.

&gt; It won by a considerable margin, and Zac and I both thought that there was NO WAY that this was going to get the green light, but it turns out the guys in the lore team absolutely loved the idea, and went all out, writing their own epic galnet political intrigue subplot for them!

&gt; ###How much work goes in to making the amazing designs you do on the Xbox One SubReddit?

&gt; In a word – Lots.

&gt; Reddit is designed in such a way that we need to hard code the CSS, and manually make all the graphics and animations frame by frame. Its very difficult, which is the reason its not so common on Reddit. There are 3 members of the team who share the CSS coding, graphics work, animations, concept and well…. Everything. Myself, MikeyJayRaymond and ClassyTurley (Hi guys!). Each theme takes us a few weeks, and well over 100 man hours. It is a labor of love!

&gt; The Elite themes were both something special, we introduced many elements never before seen on Reddit such as “holographic” animations that mirrored the games GUI (which unfortunately caused some performance issues to begin with). The second theme was actually 4 themes in one, and you could switch between each of the game’s factions with their own unique theme.

&gt; ###Working with developers must be fun, how does it feel to get so much support from the devs behind the titles you enjoy?

&gt; It’s fantastic! When you are a regular gamer, its really easy to see developers as a bit of an evil, faceless entity – but once you get to know the people behind the games, you garner a whole new perspective. They are just regular old people like you and me! Some of them are really fun too. Brian Fargo from InXile and the developers of Octodad are particularly hilarious.

&gt; ###You came all the way (from Finland is it?) to the Gamescom Elite Meet – what made you decide to do that!?

&gt; Yes, I came from Helsinki, Finland for the meet up! I came because Zac invited me! Elite is one of my favorite games, and the opportunity to meet you guys and maybe schmooze an AmA out of David for the subreddit was too good to miss! I couldn’t say “hell yes” fast enough! 

&gt; ###How long have you been playing Elite for?

&gt; Actually I’ve been playing Elite ever since I was about 8 years old, so 22 years. Elite has a really special place in my heart. My parents divorced around the time I was 8, and it was a bit rough on me (it always is when you are so young), but no matter what was going on around 8 year old me, I could always escape to Elite on my NES and be a space fighter pilot. Any time I hear the cheesy and upbeat NES theme for Elite, I cant help but smile!

&gt; I also played all the other versions of elite on PC, and was super excited when you guys brought it back to the current generation.

&gt; ###What sort of stuff do you enjoy doing in the game? Do you get involved in any community activities?

&gt; I am a huge astrology nerd, so of course I’m huge into exploration. I’m one of those weirdos who actually reads the detailed scan results for planets and stars. I also enjoy quite a bit of space combat and smuggling on the side if I’m forced to hang around in civilized space.

&gt; I take lots of screenshots, and have made a few popular chronicles of my travels. Here is 2 examples;

&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/3dr2wt/elite_dangerous_is_stupidly_beautiful_part_2/

&gt; I also fly for the eliteone subreddit faction, E.X.O and wing up with them whenever im not 6000LY from home.

&gt; ###What’s next for the Xbox One SubReddit?

&gt; Well, we are never without something on the horizon! You don’t get to be the best subreddit on the internet by sitting idle!",2016-01-27 12:27:15+00:00,czdr5w7,1.0,t3_42x8ha,180.0,EliteDangerous

4423,"&gt; Wherever you got that from, it wasn't the source you claim. Those accounts do not show a ""running costs"" item. And the total of the costs figures they do show is £21m/yr.

[The accounts you linked](http://frontier.co.uk/docs/files/Frontier%20Developments%20Annual%20Report%202015.pdf) are what I referred to.  Page 15: Outgoing Flows are £19.3m - the financial consolidation of the costs of FY2015.

&gt; Again, false. Those accounts explicitly state Operating Profit £1.9m. 

From the above linked document on page 1, 9, 11, 13 &amp; 18: Adjusted Operating Profit = £2.5m (I typo'd £2.4m).  That's what matters to business-minded people.  If you're going purely off the FY2015 period's Profit&amp;Loss statement, then the profit was £1.6m - but that isn't the whole picture.

4425,"Thanks for being patient :)

Firstly, I believe in transparency:

* I'm a backer of both games since their first weeks at Kickstarter - SC 6 days in, ED 1 day in.  Both basic game only backing.
* I upgraded by ED basic to open-beta.
* I sold my SC KS [account for a profit](https://redd.it/3oc34n), and bought back in for $30.
* I bought an ED LTXP legitimately for £93 (via the Russian Ruble); my own fault for not buying the LTXP for £35 the previous year.

Now I'll break down your questions into sections, and reorder them, as it'll be easier to respond and discuss as a whole that way.

#10 Year Plan

I laughed when I first read this.  No, you do **not** say this.  Ever. ""Hi, buy my game.  It'll be awesome in 8+ years"".

Contrary to what some say, this was never mentioned during Kickstarter, I was there (sorry for sounding patronising).  On the same note however, those initial backers who expected everything from the Design Discussion Archive to be in-game from release?  They need their heads' checked.  Release... was Gamma plus a few welcome features and fixes... which was Open Beta plus many welcome features and fixes.

FDev's 150-180 devs working on ED are developing new improvements in tandem, with the many features/fixes/additions from many small teams (3-5 per team at a guess) crosslaid in a nightmare of a project-management-flow-chart.  Things take time to develop.  They don't have 10 years, but they already know that.

#Star Citizen

Will be released late 2017 at the earliest.  A good few promised features will be initially missing, and added after release - Chris Roberts and the RTV team have been clear about this during the past couple of months.

Sq42 doesn't compete with ED as it's a completely different game genre.

#Star Citizen AND Elite Dangerous

This part amuses me.  So many idiots of both communities argue over which is best, yet the CEOs of both say ""support the other too"". The reason?  Space games aren't popular, and never will be.  Get over it.  Support as many as you can, because before you know it we won't have any new ones coming.  I've been there.

My [mega post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/407t02/horizons_and_its_included_expansions_the_known/) aims to collate what we know is coming this year, and FDev have 150-180 devs working on it - alongside what we don't know is coming.  Their communication of in-development features is restrained to say the least, and they definitely need to inform us all more.  Acting like spoilt brats won't get it.

When Star Citizen arrives, late 2017 (at the earliest), ED will be approaching the end of it's 3rd season, with information about Season 4 already established.  Based on what I've already read, we'll have everything noted in my mega-post, plus whatever major new features for Season 3 FDev are already working on, and dozens of other QOL improvements too.  Contrary to popular opinion, ED will have the clear edge, in both content and features.  Will ED's networking be fixed by then though?

...

Honestly, I don't care what happens to ED when SC is released.  I play many games now, and I'll play many games then.  If ED is awesome, I'll play it.  If SC is awesome, I'll play it too.

(Question not asked) Do I think FDev are ripping us off with Horizons?  Yes, but only in that for ED owners a £10 voucher for ship-skins as a bonus after the discount.

Should Horizons and its season of expansion be communicated better?  Definitely.

PS: I'd go into more detail on various topics, but my brain kinda hurts.",2016-01-27 02:55:36+00:00,czdeg1w,5.0,t1_czdanmz,5799.0,EliteDangerous

Please define meaningful.

I get a huge amount of joy exploring a new, randomly chosen planet in my SRV.  The only way I can describe it is it feels like the last 45 minutes of The Martian to me: ""I go here, I'm the first to do it.  I go there and see that?  The first.

1 million km in diameter (the large world map size) is only 0.7% of the distance from Earth to Sol (1AU = ~150,000,000km).  Unfortunately the former orbits the latter.

If the Solar system is to scale, then at 0.2c it'll take ~35 minutes to travel from Earth to Sol.  In that time you could get a third of the way to Hutton Orbital from Alpha C.

Note that if CIG scale down the System sizes, the max speed of 0.2c would also be scaled down, as velocity = distance / time.

4472,"&gt; it confuses the hell out of us, which is understandable.

Fair point. Hence amongst my [initial response](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/42kzro/stumbled_upon_this_awesome_album/czb66rl) 10 hours ago to BegoBogo's question of ""how do you know they are in development"" I commented:

&gt; In game development, a major feature usually takes 9-12 months from initial design, through underlying tech creation, implementation, asset &amp; art, and finally QA. Multiple major features and many minor features are developed simultaneously, sharing tech where appropriate.

FDev are so brazenly restrained with information of in-development features, to the point of announcing details piecemeal within 2-3 months of release (or 5 months in the case of Horizons, the only outlier), which they'll have worked on for 3-9 months prior.  That may be satisfactory for the traditional gaming industry, but it isn't for a game that was Kickstarted with a collection of expansions under development (there's that word again ;) ).

My aim is to help the community gain at least *some* knowledge of what's coming up over the next year, as they frankly should get solid details - shown by the price drama of Horizons' reveal and negative-review-bombing at its release.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Elite is damn near close to dying and I wouldn't be surprised if it makes it out of 2016 as an active project.

It is very healthy, and the active playerbase grows each quarter:

1. Steamspy stats of 750k CMDRs (ED+EDH):
   * 690k ED, 60k EDH
   * 14% on ED played in last 2 weeks
   * 52% on EDH played in last 2 weeks
2. Steamcharts stats of concurrent CMDRs (ED+EDH):
   * 7k = average in past 30 days
   * 8.5k = record average, late Dec '15
   * 12.5k = peak in past 30 days
   * 18k = record peak, during Black Friday weekend
   * 13k &amp; 11.5k = previous record peaks, during Sep '15 &amp; Jul '15
3. 1.4m+ total ""copies"" have been sold, of which 650k+ CMDR accounts are *not* connected to Steam, therefore there is no playdata on them.
4. All Horizons' pre-orders (and LTXP too) were done through FDevStore, so no playdata on them too (unless they connected account to Steam).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; how much was Elite on release? $49?

$60 on release.

&gt; Then they release ANOTHER game for $60 that's now in Early Access?

Horizons is currently $45 to existing players, or cheaper if they wait and buy it during sales later this year, when more of its updates have been released.

As features arrive to both the basegame and Horizons, and sale-discounts drop Horizons to ""value""-level for those holding off, more players will return and new players jump in. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; If games like Star Citizen and No Man Sky roll around and are even 25% of the game those devs have showcased, Elite will be a memory of the past.

There's no need for hyperbole. I'm a Star Citizen backer, and play to buy NMS assuming it scores 70%+ in PC reviews; I look forward to playing both, alongside other upcoming space-games of smaller-scopes.

Star Citizen will be great to play when it's released late 2017+, at the earliest.  It is currently pre-alpha, with the critical techs of networking/instancing, party-play, intra-System, and inter-System (jumpgates) travel still being developed.  The Crusader System will likely be completed (one planet with 3 moons so far) by Autumn, allowing testing of full intra-System travel.  CIG in recent 10FTx, ATV and RTV episodes have been stating that some features will arrive post-release. Meanwhile, being a single-player campaign, Sq42 will be a fun two dozen hour playthrough.

No Man's Sky (June 2016) will offer an excellent fantasy-space exploration game, that I'll likely play for maybe 60 hours.  There's unfortunately no evidence of tangible multiplayer, extensive Faction-play or a creativity-construction toolset; unless many gameplay features have remained ""hidden"" this past year NMS will be unlikely to keep players gripped like an MMO.",2016-01-25 02:20:24+00:00,czar0wb,8.0,t1_czap5kw,2842.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; David Braben and Frontier Development were in San Francisco for GDC 2015, it's been a good week for them with new updates to the game and a pair of Game Developer Choice Awards. 

&gt; I had expected to talk about the game, and future plans but we managed to quickly go off track and talked instead about the science behind cosmic catastrophes, a subject close to my heart. 

&gt; This was brilliant.

From this statement I assume you're thinking that ED is dying?  It is very healthy actually:

1. Steamspy stats of 750k CMDRs (ED+EDH):
   * 690k ED, 60k EDH
   * 14% on ED played in last 2 weeks
   * 52% on EDH played in last 2 weeks
2. Steamcharts stats of concurrent CMDRs (ED+EDH):
   * 7k = average in past 30 days
   * 8.5k = record average, late Dec '15
   * 12.5k = peak in past 30 days
   * 18k = record peak, during Black Friday weekend
   * 13k &amp; 11.5k = previous record peaks, during Sep '15 &amp; Jul '15
3. 1.4m+ total ""copies"" have been sold, of which 650k+ CMDR accounts are *not* connected to Steam, therefore there is no playdata on them.
4. All Horizons' pre-orders (and LTXP too) were done through FDevStore, so no playdata on them too (unless they connected account to Steam).

It is, and will be great to play when it's released late 2017+, at the earliest.  Being single-player, Sq42 will be fun for two dozen hours.",2016-01-24 02:45:05+00:00,cz9m4tk,8.0,t1_cz9ebdu,14146.0,EliteDangerous

4584,"C&amp;P for the firewall-victims:

&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; Following up on last week’s update revealing the addition of faces and contacts for mission givers and engineers, in this updated I’ll expand on the role of engineers and how they factor into crafting. Note that in last week’s update I referred to them as ‘mechanics’, but we’ve since settled on the term ‘engineers’.

&gt; Engineers are individuals who provide the blueprints (which describe the materials and items needed for a specific modification) and can then apply them to the weapon or module. They are characters with their own back story, preferences and specialisations. Initially we’re looking at around 30 engineers dotted throughout human space and we will be able to add more in future updates.

&gt; One of the reasons that we chose mission givers and engineers first for the characterisation treatment is because in both cases you have an ongoing relationship which can change over time with the character. For the minor factions this is measured by your reputation with that minor faction (although factors like Pilots Federation rank will influence the deference with which they treat you), with the engineers the measure is taken from a variety of stats throughout the game and dependent on the nature of the individual.

&gt; For example we have an engineer who is closely aligned with the Federal Navy and so your rank with the navy is his key consideration, so the higher your naval rank the better blueprints he will be able to offer. As well as naval ranks, the Pilots Federation ranks (including combat, trade, exploration and CQC) will influence some engineers. Some engineers will be affiliated  with minor factions, so you’ll need to manage your relationship with them as well. Some will use your stats for mining or trading in illegal goods as well as a host of other indicators.

&gt; As well as these initial governing factor there is a separate reputation with them, which must be cultivated along the lines of their governing factor to gain their trust and so more capable blueprints.

&gt; Not all engineers are immediately available to all players. The factor that governs their relationship with a commander has a minimum threshold that must be reached for them to deal with the player.

&gt; Each engineer has a specialisation, meaning that the deal with specific weapon types and modules. This is because they are experts in squeezing a bit more performance than the norm in their particular field. We are looking at having a secondary specialisation for engineers, just to help balancing the distribution of specialisations and of course we can add more engineers in the future. Or even remove ones if circumstances require it!

&gt; The engineers are spread geographically to add more geography to the map, but also to fit with the individual’s characteristics. They tend to be reclusive characters who are found at their own, isolated facilities on planet surfaces.

&gt; As well as working towards the 2.1 we’re also preparing a minor update to be released next week (assuming testing goes well) with fixes for season one and two clients. We’re also processing the latest batch of player group minor factions (batch 4) and the approved changes and additions should be added to the game next week.

&gt; Thanks!

&gt; Greetings Commanders, 

&gt; It's been a while since the last Answers from the Devs thread so we wanted to take a moment to get some of your questions and get the answers directly from the team. 

&gt; As always, if you would like to ask a question to be answered in the next thread, post it below and we will hope to get it answered. 

&gt; I would like to say a big thank you to Ozric for compiling these questions too. 

&gt; Zac

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Q:** Is the digital art book (as promised to Mercenary Edition and earlier backers) still coming?

&gt; **A:** Yes, absolutely. The team is working on it at the moment, and we’ll have more information on that for you as soon as possible. 

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** Do throttle setting and size and class of interdictor module have an influence on the potential outcome?

&gt; **A:** The size and class of the interdictor affect the range they work in, but all other things are equal, and the throttle plays no part.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** Will ED support Nvidia VR SLI where each GPU renders each display and/or AMD Liquid VR for AMD users?

&gt; **A:** This hasn’t been decided yet.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** Will there be a ""first landed on"" credit at some point?

&gt; **A:** This isn’t currently planned, but we have more coming for explorers on planet surfaces in Elite Dangerous: Horizons.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** When will we see Private Groups enabled on Xbox One?

&gt; **A:** This is something that is currently being worked on, but don’t have a release date yet.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** Will there be any more security, police or navy missions coming to Elite Dangerous?

&gt; **A:** Yes – we plan to revamp the military missions to make them feel more like a career, and you were actually working for them.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** Does destroying Skimmers or other SRVs affect our combat rating?

&gt; **A:** Yes. 

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** Are there ships that are exclusive to Horizons (and future seasons)?

&gt; **A:** It’s likely that some ships will be season exclusive. The Cobra MK IV is an example of this already – it’s only available to those who purchased the original Elite Dangerous separately. 

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** Is there any news on the possibility of multiple commanders on one account?

&gt; **A:** There are currently no plans to add this.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** It appears that some NPC names are used more than others, how are NPC names determined?

&gt; **A:** They’re randomly selected from a list for the ship NPCs.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** What happened to Bat Crazy Roy? I haven’t seen him since Beta

&gt; **A:** He’s hiding from you.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** Back in February, Sandro mentioned some ideas/plans to introduce some kind of ""hidden cargo"" for smuggling purposes, has this idea been discarded or is it still on the list?

&gt; **A:** This idea is still on the wish list.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** How far is the maximum expansion range for a minor faction and how does replacing another minor faction in a system work?

&gt; **A:** The maximum expansion range for a minor faction is about 15LY, and you don’t replace a minor faction you are adding a new minor faction to that system.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** Will the Federal Fighter and the Imperial Fighter be added to the main game when ""ship-launched fighters"" is added during ""Horizons""?

&gt; **A:** Yes! 

&gt; ***

&gt; **Q:** Are you able to tell in advance whether or not a surface outpost has a landing pad large enough to accommodate your ship?

&gt; **A:** All surface ports have large landing pads. The ones that cannot be docked at are found only on medium sized settlements.

4660,"Forum thread OP:

&gt; What do you guys think? I have seen many people talk about instancing but Frontier Development has yet to comment on the issue. For me the encounters I have with other players is the most fun I have and as of 2.0 I feel it has gotten worse, This is by far my favorite game that I play and I hope to hear that this issue is actually being taken into consideration and frontier isn't happy with how it currently is. 
Some of the issues that have been brought up are as follows.

&gt; Not being in the same instance as players on your friends list when neither of your instances are full.
unable to have any meaningful PVP between player groups because no one can seem to get in the same instance.
The over all dead space feeling of not running into other commanders in systems, logging off and back on to find the empty system you were just in is in fact not empty jumping out and back in brings you back to that empty instance.

&gt; please feel free to add constructive and engaging conversations about this topic. 

&gt; If you are also experiencing instancing issues please head over to this [bug Thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=224071) and leave your 2 cents so that maybe frontier is compelled to give us an answer as to weather or not they plan to fix this.

&gt; The first expansion, Planetary Landings introduces players to planet surfaces and the first all-new Surface Recon Vehicle (SRV) the ‘Scarab’. Scanning airless planets and moons brings new gameplay as players detect signals, crashed ships, mineral deposits, outposts and fortresses. Alone or with friends players will explore, mine and engage hostile forces as they attempt to infiltrate strongholds guarding valuable rewards. Players will explore new worlds, coasting over mountaintops, diving into canyons, landing on the surface and rolling out onto the surface in your SRV, all without loading times or breaks in gameplay.

&gt; Elite Dangerous: Horizons will continue to introduce new features and gameplay as the season continues into 2016, enriching the Elite Dangerous experience with new activities and new ways to play.

&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; This week sees the release of the latest Xbox One Content Update, this brings the Xbox One version into line with the season one components of the PC/Mac 2.02 release.

&gt; Characterisation and a more personal connection to the game world has always been one of the goals for Elite: Dangerous. It’s such a massive play space that it’s easy to feel dwarfed by it and the current impersonal contacts inside the game only enhance that perception. In an interesting coincidence I saw some [lovely concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/400t1y/i_added_a_few_characters_to_local_missions_just/) (*link added by StuartGT*) that fans had created for personalities and as part of the mission flow. This is something that we’re working on as part of the 2.1 release (as with the 2.0x point releases some of the changes will be applicable to season one owners).

&gt; We’ll leverage the work we’ve done on that Commander Creator to provide headshots of specific contacts. The focus for this will be mission givers and mechanics (these are loot characters) and the intention is that every mission giver in game (also equivalent to the minor factions) will be a specific individual. This should be consistent for all players.

&gt; Your relationship with the minor faction will determine who within that organisation you will deal with, so the better your relationship with them, the higher level character you will deal with. So maintaining a decent reputation with that minor faction is a wise policy!

&gt; As well as providing a face for your interactions with that minor faction they will offer more information about how the minor faction is doing and how you can help them. This will be accompanied by a number of changes to missions to facilitate this, there will be more details on this over the coming weeks.

&gt; Mechanics are individuals with their own characteristics, history and specialisations who will facilitate crafting. They are spread throughout human space and they are the people to see about implementing changes to your weapons and modules. The release of season two saw the first steps in loot and crafting and this will developed to a much greater degree in 2.1 - we’ll delve into more details on this soon as well.

&gt; Over the past year we’ve made a number of changes to some of the visuals (most notable are the asteroids) to improve performance – note that this had nothing to do with the Xbox One release as that uses a different profile. This has impacted the visual quality of the asteroids and we will be addressing some of the causes of that in the 2.1 release. Some of those changes were due to changes in other areas of the game (such as environment map capture) needing to be rebalanced. Whatever the cause we’re evaluating the lighting, fog, shadows and loading issues. Some of these fixes we may limit to certain graphics quality options to make sure all our players enjoy good performance and improved visuals with respect to their systems capabilities.

&gt; Thanks!

&gt; Over the past year we’ve made a number of changes to some of the visuals (most notable are the asteroids) to improve performance – note that this had nothing to do with the Xbox One release as that uses a different profile. This has impacted the visual quality of the asteroids and we will be addressing some of the causes of that in the 2.1 release. Some of those changes were due to changes in other areas of the game (such as environment map capture) needing to be rebalanced. Whatever the cause we’re evaluating the lighting, fog, shadows and loading issues. Some of these fixes we may limit to certain graphics quality options to make sure all our players enjoy good performance and improved visuals with respect to their systems capabilities.

&gt; Thanks!

Fallout 4 was one of the most successful games of 2015, released in November, and yesterday it had a peak of 2.2% concurrent Steam players, 62k out of 2.8m.

So... based on your words, does that mean Fallout 4 is performing *even worse than nothing*?

Other ""Best Of 2015"" examples, using SteamSpy's peak concurrency stats:

* Metal Gear Solid 5 = 1.2%
* Witcher 3 = 1.2%
* Rocket League = 1.5%

And just for fun, as the **most played** game on Steam by a country mile, DOTA2 only managed a *paltry* 1.5%.

&gt; We speak to Dr Arcanonn, the 'lead researcher' of the [intersterallar research group](http://i.imgur.com/0cgKey3.png).


&gt; ###1 – WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE CANONN GET UP TO? WHAT ARE THEY ALL ABOUT?

&gt; In addition to long debates about biscuits, we theorise and conduct research into the Unknown Artefact mystery, on a grand scale.

&gt; We have hundreds of CMDRs flying around the galaxy looking at places of interest, tracking down (and, ahem, occasionally pirating) suspicious NPC convoys, observing and recording UA behaviour, as well as securing our own home system. We want to be there as the mystery develops and want to ensure that humanity follows the ‘right path’ when the time comes.

&gt; We have also been investigating other mysteries, such as the disappearance of SS1 and the source of the Cerberus plague outbreak.

 

&gt; ###2 – WHAT IS YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE CANONN? WERE YOU THERE WHEN IT FIRST STARTED OUT?

&gt; I am technically the lead researcher for the group, however, my council makes most of the decisions for me now, whilst I eat biscuits.

&gt; Luckily they still seem to listen to me when I say something, but to be honest I do a lot of nodding and appearing to mull things over… In truth I’m just waiting to get back to the soft play area I’ve had installed in the lab using the donations from the members.

&gt; Some say that it was me who started the whole thing, and I must confess I sometimes look at myself in the mirror and say ‘I never asked to be a celebrity, leader of an interstellar organisation, or de-facto ruler of an entire planetary system, but I’ll take it!’

 

&gt; ###3 – HOW DID THE CANONN FIRST GET STARTED?

&gt; I put up an innocent post about a possible correlation between Soontill Relics and Michael Brookes’ endless proclamations of ‘SoonTM’. The subject of UAs cropped up, and was initially thought to be a hoax, but this changed when Michael posted in the thread the, now legendary, question ‘have you listened to them?’

&gt; The hunt was on and, when CMDR RedWizzard finally found and secured one, we really listened to it.

&gt; Days of observations, recordings, speculation and tens of theories later, a hidden morse message was found within the Unknown Artefact sound.

&gt; Eventually I pulled together a team to start posting to Galnet. This required a group name and, after much discussion, ‘The Canonn’ was chosen. From there, it’s just snowballed.

 

&gt; ###4 – WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CANONN’S MOST INTERESTING MOMENTS/PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENTS?

&gt; The recent [Educating Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoCiZVf_ea0) live stream was fantastic and is attracting more scientists to us, and to the mystery, daily. Reaching the thread limit on the Forums three times is pretty huge, too (now over 30k posts total). Also, we were recently mentioned on an official Galnet, which was a nice surprise, if slightly scary!

&gt; In terms of the UA mystery, and these aren’t all exclusively Canonn achievements, but, finding the Morse code, figuring out the encoded ship images and discovering the ‘UA Shell’ around Merope are probably the biggest so far.

&gt; CMDR RedWizzard, who captured the first UA, also wanted to add:

&gt; “On a personal note, the fight to liberate that first UA from the convoy was epic and meeting up with more than a dozen other Cmdrs to do the first listening test was amazing. The whole thing is probably the most exhilarating gaming experience I’ve ever had.”

 

&gt; ###5 – HOW CAN PEOPLE GET INVOLVED WITH THE CANONN?

&gt; Jump into the [thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=222049) (search ‘UAs Barnacles’ on the Frontier Forums) and join up on the website at http://canonn.science.

&gt; Everyone is welcome, and it doesn’t matter if you’re already involved with other groups. Whatever your play style, the Canonn will have something for you!

 

&gt; ###6 – WHY DO YOU DEDICATE SO MUCH OF YOUR TIME TO THE ELITE DANGEROUS COMMUNITY?

&gt; The Canonn was really a community effort from day one, and the number of CMDRs involved has ballooned over that time. The camaraderie and cooperation is unlike anything I’ve experienced in a game before, and it really enriches the experience on a daily basis. Elite fans really are ‘elite’ fans!


&gt; ###7 – HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN PLAYING ELITE FOR?

&gt; Since ’84, of course!

&gt; ###8 – WHAT’S NEXT FOR THE CANONN WITH HORIZONS OUT NOW?

&gt; Our (virtual) Capital Ship, the RSV Gnosis, is in the seemingly very special Merope system with as many CMDRs as possible to conduct a deep scientific survey of all its airless planets &amp; moons, in our shiny new SRVs.  Initially we were looking for anything we could find – and now we’re looking for Barnacles!

&gt; Rest assured - we will leave no stone unturned – if there’s something unusual or ‘unknown’ to be found down there – we will find it!

 

&gt; ###9 – DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE YOU’D LIKE TO TELL THE ELITE COMMUNITY ABOUT?

&gt; To those CMDRs who are still not sure about joining a player group because they fear it will stop them being able to follow their own path: The Canonn won’t tell you how to play, and won’t be offended if you want to go and do your own thing. It’s all about fun, science, biscuits and cooperation for us, and we’d be honoured to have you on board!

&gt; Hi everyone.

&gt; I wanted to take a second just to pop on the thread and leave a quick reply.

&gt; First of all thank you for taking the time to leave feedback. I know we say this a lot but feedback truly is vitally important to us. The developers always read the forums and make adjustments based on this feedback. I can personally say that I have never known a development studio have so much focus on the community. From the very top all the way through the development team, your thoughts, feedback and concerns are taken and considered.

&gt; I think it's clear to see the passion and desire to support the community through the studio when you look at things like Horizons launch day and David Braben, Mike Brookes and a number of other developers ran AMA's and livestreamed Q&amp;A sessions for roughly 8 hours. This is just 1 example and I could list others, but my point is they really do value the community and we're really lucky to be going hand in hand on this journey to develop and grow the game together.

&gt; I know you mentioned the thread recently from Osidian Ant, I spoke with him over email last week and I will be replying to that thread shortly. I wanted to wait until some of the senior members of the rendering team were back in the office to discuss the technical aspects.

&gt; In terms of addressing your overall concerns. Despite our best efforts and the hard work of the QA department and developers, sometimes bugs will fall through. In addition to that there are also gameplay tweaks and additions that people would like to see. But every single patch and update brings with it a host of fixes and tweaks to the current game. You mentioned yourself that the last patch saw positive fixes and the team are still working hard to make sure that other bugs and tweaks that are on the list are being worked on too.

&gt; As a final reminder, and I'm sure you're all well aware, just make sure that all bugs are reported as clearly and as accurately as they can in the bug forum with as detailed reproduction steps so that the QA team can review each issue as smoothly as possible.

&gt; Thanks

&gt; #Q&amp;A Conundrums (cont.)

&gt; Q: Will we have maintenance or construction yards for us to dock at if we need to upgrade, fix or sell our ship or will that still be done at the port?

&gt; A: Yes. They may be connected in big orbital shipyards. You will be able to see ships that are under construction, that’s how you can tell it’s a shipyard. Simple maintenance could be just done in the docking bay. But certainly buying new ships you will have to go to a special place. - Progress Diary #5, 8:00

&gt; Again he is affirming that shipyards will be special places that you go to buy ships. Almost any old station will sell ships currently.

&gt; Q: Will space stations have their own weapon systems?

&gt; A: Yes. They will have cops that stream out ... but also on the station itself … the reason they weren’t in the original Elite and Frontier is actually from a gameplay perspective, it can very much spoil the enjoyment because it was actually quite fun playing around with the police ships … and also to make sure that the player has a warning if all they’ve done is pressed the fire button by mistake. - Progress Diary #7, 7:20

&gt; Confusing answer, since he apparently knows that adding powerful weapons to stations have made them less fun and impossible to fight near, even though the trailer shows off a fight in and around a station. Even more confusing since you certainly do not have the mentioned warning in most cases of blue on blue.

&gt; ###You're not a cop are you?

&gt; * “I always felt quite uncomfortable in Frontier that you could just trade illegal items through the bulletin board in full sight of everybody.”
&gt; * “In Elite Dangerous we want this to be earned. This is a reward, you get more trusted in a place and you can build up a reputation in a place to be trustworthy trading such goods.” - Progress Diary #4, 6:40

&gt; Any schmuck can waltz into any black market and sell whatever they want to anyone.

&gt; ###Passenger Liners

&gt; Progress Diary #5’s entire opening is dedicated to the topic of passenger transport, it should be clear that the entire subject is laughable since no passenger transport of any kind can be found in the game. The ships that were supposed to do this as a dedicated task have no real role in the game right now.

&gt; ###Hand me the hydro-spanner!

&gt; Not from Braben this time. Art Director Chris Gregory (why is this a different art director from before? do they have more than one?) says:

&gt; * “The player might have to take action to solve a problem within their cockpit, such as a fire, a toxic leak from their cargo, or maybe even an outbreak of trumbles.” - Progress Diary #8, 2:47
&gt; * “Taking damage or running low on power, might well cause your instrumentation to glitch or degrade”. - Progress Diary #8, 3:54

&gt; While the cockpit might react with smoke, or by breaking, that is the most interaction you get.

&gt; ***

&gt; ""There will be smaller ships going between an orbital station like this and the surface.” - Progress Diary #11, 2:17

&gt; I'd like to see them.

&gt; ***

&gt; * “I can see myself being chased through supercruise, down into a fight [inside an asteroid field].”
&gt; * “Or maybe I’ve hidden something here, left a little beacon where I can retrieve it.” - Progress Diary #12, 3:40

&gt; Of course, there is no way that an interdiction will end anywhere but free space. If you do crash into a ring by accident, you will both be thrown out in separate instances. There is also no way to stash things, if you jettison cargo it will despawn.

&gt; ***

&gt; Finally, in the capital ship battle video the capital ships are shown using large weapons against each other that they do not use in the game.

I remember thinking the initial release of the game was quite barebones. And rewatching them all helped me to realize just how little has changed. Here is a collection of every half-truth from the pre-release material I could find. This is not including newsletters, blog posts, and forum posts. Although I would like to do those too, it's quite a bit of work. If you have any examples to contribute feel free to post them in this thread.

&gt; #TIER 0 - KICKSTARTER PROMISES

&gt; *Material in this tier has been presented on the kickstarter pitch page and can still be seen there today.*

&gt; ###Damage Model

&gt; “In Frontier and Elite ships either blew up or they didn’t. In Elite Dangerous we plan to have damage models. You’ll see things spewing out ... also the odd cargo canister which you can scoop up, even from a ship that’s not destroyed.” - Dev Diary 1, 2:00

&gt; A [picture](http://i.imgur.com/4oaL6Cs.jpg) of a heavily damaged anaconda model is shown. The damaged anaconda shows up again in the “Cobra Teaser” video, responding to missiles fired from an attacker.

&gt; ###Heat

&gt; “As you maneuver more and more rapidly your ship gets hotter … if combat goes on too long other people will start coming in because they’ll see you from long range.” - Dev Diary 1, 3:20

&gt; This doesn’t seem possible, unless you’re in the same instance to begin with, there’s no way to detect anyone from “long range” regardless of their heat level.

&gt; The entire Dev Diary 2 is amazing, I don’t know how to describe it, just watch the whole thing. Pure poppycock from start to finish. The following three examples are all from that video, the first example is a space station being built:

&gt; ###DIY Space Station

&gt; * “Imagine a super rich colony, trade is booming, they decide to build a space station.”
&gt; * “Orders go out for parts, things like that.”
&gt; * “You see the space station as a skeleton (scaffolding) initially.”
&gt; * “You see it get more filled in.”
&gt; * “With time, orders for kit that goes inside the station goes out.”
&gt; * “Dignitaries from the surrounding areas will want to be brought in [when the station is complete].”
&gt; * “These will all be mission contracts for players to take up.”
&gt; * “El Presidente will want to do the opening ceremony.”
&gt; * “There will be assassination contracts out on some of them.”
&gt; * “You may find you’re carrying one of these dignitaries who is up for being assassinated.”

&gt; There was a “build a station” community goal but it had hardly any of these things and was a scripted one-off event. Braben in the video claims that these things will happen “all over the place”.

&gt; ###Famine

&gt; * “Imagine a world falls into a state of famine … complete crop failure … humanitarian aid is coming in.”
&gt; * “Government is putting out contracts for food in large quantities.”
&gt; * “It’s up to the player whether to profiteer from this or whether to act charitably.”
&gt; * “All the surrounding systems will be watching.”
&gt; * “Imagine a large warship arrives and blockades the system because they want the system to capitulate and be annexed.”
&gt; * “[Players] can choose to side with this invader or they can run the blockade.”

&gt; Again while ""famine"" is indeed a state a faction can have, it has nearly none of these effects.

&gt; ###Trade Disputes

&gt; * “Imagine you’ve got two very hostile worlds reasonably close to each other.”
&gt; * “A player discovers a very valuable mining resources … in a system that is currently unclaimed.”
&gt; * “Both systems will want the new system annexed.”
&gt; * “As soon as the news go out … they might both station warships in the system and start fighting over it.”
&gt; * “You can take missions from one side or the other side.”
&gt; * “There is the third way ... might try and mine them under the guns of these warships, although that might not be very effective.”

&gt; You cannot sell exploration data in this way. Factions do not respond like this, and you can't be endangered by other ships while mining because when you drop down into your own spot on a ring it is completely empty.

&gt; As a final insult he suggests that looting a convoy may in itself lead to something else happening, which of course, it won’t.

&gt; ###Call it In

&gt; In Dev Diary 3, Braben presents a scenario of trader anacondas being attacked.

&gt; * “It is possible that these traders were caught en-route and called you in.”
&gt; * “You came in as an escort for some ad-hoc deal made on the phone, which can also be broken later of course.” - Dev Diary 3, 1:30

&gt; You cannot call others from outside your instance to help, only police NPC are somehow able to detect your location and crime report beacon to jump in, even so this rarely happens. He also suggests player bounties will be significantly higher than NPC bounties, which I don't see being the case.

&gt; ###The One

&gt; * “One of the things we want to do … is to ensure that no one role is a massive generator of cash.""
&gt; * “What I don’t want ... is to be forced to forever asteroid mine or whatever it is.” - Dev Diary 3, 2:30

&gt; Very amusing. The balance has shifted slightly over the course of patches but certain playstyles have always been much better at making money than others. It was a bigger problem at launch, long after the alpha and beta I might add, but it is still a problem.

&gt; ###Use the Force

&gt; “Groups of players can force the price up.” - Trading Dev Diary, 2:10

&gt; While flooding the market to drive prices down is possible (but not useful due to cost), I can’t think of a way to force prices up.

&gt; The main body of the pitch text reads ""Take part in multiplayer co-op mission alliances, free-for-all group battles and team raids to bring down planetary economies.”

&gt; I’m unsure what this means, but I can’t think of anything in the game that it would be right now.

&gt; #TIER 1 - DEV DIARY DELUSIONS

&gt; Now that horizons is out in its most dull, barebones state, it is amusing to note that Braben says “if every planet was just a differently coloured heightmap that would be disappointing.” - Elite Dangerous Development Plan, 1:30

&gt; The original concern and justification for not including the feature in the first place is the reality of today. 

&gt; ###Use Your Imagination

&gt; * “This time if you enter a system that is in a state of civil war … you’ll be entering a system where … you are aware of craft fighting around you.”
&gt; * “Vipers holding off the attacking forces of the planet.”
&gt; * “By the time you reach a space station you are very much aware this is an oasis in chaos.” - Art Director John Laws, Art Journal, 1:25
&gt; * “If I go to a system and it’s in a state of peace … a good trade place, then what I want to see there is advertising ships.”
&gt; * “I want to be aware of traffic, busily going about its place.” - Art Journal, 2:10

&gt; Of course, there's barely a way to tell systems apart, the only thing that sets a civil war system apart is a few scattered combat zones and checkpoints (that nobody can force you to go through, making them entirely useless.)

&gt; ###Angle the Deflectors

&gt; * “The plan is that for the smaller ships there will be a single shield.”
&gt; * “But as the ships get bigger and bigger, much like with the original elite, the Cobra had a front and a back shield. We’re planning that.”
&gt; * “It would have two shield generators which would deplete separately.” - Shields Dev Diary, 1:30
&gt; * “On a very large ship we’re expecting to have as many as half a dozen different shield generators covering different bits of the ship” - Shields Dev Diary, 2:00

&gt; All ships now have a single massive shield generator no matter how big.

&gt; ###Q&amp;A Conundrums

&gt; *Braben also took the time to answer some community questions. His answers are fairly revealing, and sometimes just confusing.*

&gt; Q: When flying with your friends, can you share nav map information, for example points of interest of where you are heading?

&gt; A: Yes. - Progress Diary #1, 5:00

&gt; This is, even after wings, untrue. Signal sources cannot be shared and you probably all know of the issues with horizons points of interest not being replicated properly.

&gt; Q: Since space travel will be long at boring (at times)... will there be time wasting activities?

&gt; A: No. You don’t design a game to have really long boring frustrating sections in it. - Progress Diary #1, 5:50

&gt; This is just golden, considering that in the starting system of LHS3447 takes some 10 minutes of flying in a straight line to get from the drop point to the stations. Do I even need to mention hutton orbital? The game is defined by long, boring and frustrating travel.

&gt; Q: Will it be possible to dock with capital/motherships?

&gt; A: Yes. We will have various kinds of capital ships. Both giant freighters and also military ships. They won’t have the full function of a space station, but you will be able to dock, repair, refuel, depending on the type of the ship. You will also be able to dock with shipyards which will be separate from the space stations. They will each have different functions, you might be able to trade but in a restricted way. We’re also planning ship-to-ship docking where you will be able to exchange goods. - Progress Diary #2, 6:45

&gt; None of the underlined things are possible or in the game in any way.

&gt; Q: Will we be able to name our ships?

&gt; A: Yes. I don’t think it will have a lot of relevance. - Progress Diary #4, 5:30

&gt; You can't name your ship, even cosmetically.

&gt; Greetings all,

&gt; First of all I want to take a moment to thank Obsidian Ant, as always, for his highly constructive and positive way of addressing these points and seeking feedback. 

&gt; I'm sorry for the delay. I wanted to wait until one of the senior members of the rendering team were available to discuss the thread in question. I know this has been raised before and we understand it's an important topic. 

&gt; Some areas of the game, as mentioned previously, have been removed for optimisation. As an example, asteroid shadows were removed because they caused significant frame rate and stability issues. 

&gt; Other changes have happened because they themselves rely on other things that have seen changes. For example envmaps/lighting. Some areas of the game have seen development (which is likely the areas you are mentioning) and some, such as asteroids are still awaiting some additional work. 

&gt; The team are reviewing a number of areas such as fog, lighting, shadow and loading. It's not possible to give an exact answer as to when these areas will see fixes will be exactly or give more detail on those fixes but I can certainly assure you all that the development team are actively working on them. 

&gt; Thanks,

&gt; **Q - KakerMix:** *This is cool and all, but without being able to influence where our chosen minor faction expands when we get it to an expansion state means that this information isn't anything we can use properly. What if the minor faction rolls the dice and expands into a diametrically opposed power-controlled system that is costly to control? We as players can see ""Yes don't expand here it's bad"" but the computer decides to anyway and the players are stuck with a negative situation because while we can make a minor faction expand we can't choose where it can go, thus killing a lot of the strategy.*

&gt; *Personally I want as little to do with Powerplay as possible until it gets a heavy rework, you say these things and all I think is 'oh man they are going to ruin the background sim like they ruined the potential of Powerplay'. When can we oppose a Powerplay faction without having to join another Powerplay faction? Why do I have to pledge to a competing power in order to fight a different one? I can do the same things the same ways and follow the same rules, but if I don't have a pledge to a power it doesn't count?*

&gt; **A - Michael:** A method for selecting where to expand into is something we have discussed and would like to see added.

&gt; Powerplay will be getting some love and having mechanisms for a minor faction to resist a power is also something we'd like to add.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Q - adrinker:** *I appreciate the response.  I hope that you have also a way to make the galaxy feel more alive, and less predictable. The profit-making methods are too well documented, and too repetitive. I'd love to see procedurally-generated life added to the bubble, where as right now every system is a mirror of another system.* 

&gt; *We should be making a player story, not just grinding out the same activity for credits that will inevitably support more efficient grinding.* 

&gt; **A - Michael:** While I agree we can add more life to the galaxy there already players and player groups with some great stories. They're often the highlights of keeping up to date on the forums!

&gt; ###Happy New Year everyone,

&gt; I hope you all enjoyed a good Christmas and New Year! I managed to complete my journey to Sagittarius A* and am now back in civilised space – I didn’t quite make Elite for it though. For the first dev update of 2016 I shall go into some of the details of the galaxy simulation to help guide the ever increasing number of players backing minor factions. Don’t worry if this is all new to you, I’ll start with the basic concepts and expand from there.

&gt; Minor factions are political entities with star systems that vie against each other to control assets within the star system. Assets of a system include starports, outposts, surface ports and surface installations. The strength of a faction’s presence in a system is displayed as their influence level. Influence levels are increased, or reduced by player activity such as completing missions, trading and bounty hunting. Whichever minor faction controls the primary starport for the system is considered the controlling faction for the system.

&gt; The minor faction that owns a port will determine the laws for the jurisdiction for that port. This is commonly dictated by the superpower allegiance of the minor faction, and its government type.

&gt; Currently there is little direct linkage between minor factions and powers, although powers can influence certain aspects like laws and markets within their dominion and grant state and influence bonuses to allied minor factions. Conversely minor factions that are diametrically opposed to a power make that system more costly to control. This connection between powers and minor factions is something we’d like to strengthen during season 2 and beyond.

&gt; There is a cap on the amount a Faction can change in influence per day, which is determined by: the size of population (the bigger the harder), the faction state, the amount of player activity that day, and any Power influence on that system. Influence is calculated on an approximately daily tick.

&gt; As well as affecting influence, player actions also drive the state of that system which can include a range of effects from famine through to lockdowns, the following actions have different strength effects on economic states:

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/Ivuum68.jpg

&gt; Ownership of an asset can change at the conclusion of one of the following states:

&gt; * War
&gt; * Civil War
&gt; * Elections

&gt; These conflict states take priority over economic states and are triggered by the factions’ influence level relative to other factions in the system. Conflicts cannot end before their minimum duration. Conflicts that reach their maximum duration are considered to end in a ceasefire, and no assets change owners. A faction can only take part in a single conflict, no matter how many systems they are present in.

&gt; Player activities shown in the Actions Table above, and through related missions, push the faction towards and away from economic states by adding points to pools. Once the pool is large enough it will queue the state with a countdown after which the event will trigger, assuming it has the largest pool.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###State Flow 

&gt; When a state triggers, all other economic state pools are reset to 0 apart from Outbreak and Famine which are halved, unless it is Famine or outbreak when they are all reduced to 0.

&gt; All States have a countdown before they trigger, a minimum and maximum duration, and a cool down before which the state cannot occur again, even if it has been interrupted.

&gt; When certain states are active, they can modify which player activities can affect the faction’s influence:

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/fjZiJfw.jpg

&gt; States also modify the “wealth”, “security”, “development level” and “Standard of living” stats if the faction controls a star system. The prices and production of certain market goods are also affected when economic and conflict states are active.

&gt; There’s still quite a lot we want to do to develop the socio-economic simulation further. Better population modelling and effects is one major addition we’ve discussed. There’s also a desire for greater feedback for the player in their interactions and in the longer term, we are looking at automated colonisation and lots, lots more!

&gt; For fun here are the minor factions who are currently present in 8 or more star systems:

&gt; * Sirius Corporation
&gt; * Kalkinja Blue Brothers
&gt; * Alioth Independents
&gt; * League of Amemait
&gt; * Sanuma Gold Dynamic
&gt; * Purple Natural Incorporated
&gt; * Noblemen of Rikbakara

&gt; * HIP 2327 Prison Colony
&gt; * United Allo Free

&gt; Will one of these minor factions become a power over the coming months? :-)

###And some quick Q&amp;A from the forum thread:

&gt; **Q - Epicthetrumble:** *That's all well and good, but... how does any of this affect players in any way? Apart from minor changes in certain statistics that only the most obsessive players would worry about, most of which only have to do with trading, none of this has any real effect on what players experience in the game. Even civil wars, which one would think would be a pretty big deal, have zero effect on players who don't enter combat zones. There are no visible differences in what NPCs spawn, what happens in USS, what missions spawn (unless it's a war, and even then it's very limited), etc. To the average player, who doesn't obsess over what happens in the faction information panel, the background simulation seems to pretty much solely exist for its own sake, with everything they actually see, apart from the economy, being for all intents and purposes completely random.*

&gt; **A - Michael:** To highlight just a few: it feeds into what traffic is generated in a system, what missions are available and the markets. It also effects the laws applied in a system. I agree we need to do more with it, but it already affects all areas of the game, although maybe too subtly in places.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Q - wstephenson:** *Based on what you've shown here, the logic in the minor faction part of the background simulation would appear to be quite manageable. Yet we often hear complaints here about bugs in the BGS where players do not see the expected effect of their actions.*

&gt; *Are these bugs genuine, or are they only perceived as such because players are not aware of the full ruleset (i.e. doing hundreds of missions for a faction whilst the system is in Lockdown)?*

&gt; *What have been the sources of genuine bugs that have been found in the BGS? Programming errors in the implementation of the above logic, records of player actions getting lost or not applied to systems when you process the tick, or are there complex network interactions between neighbouring systems/factions/powerplay?*

&gt; *For a system in isolation without NPC trading, it would seem feasible to ensure that the minor faction influence and system state game logic is correct, either by unit testing or black box testing via simulated inputs - so if there are still real bugs in the BGS, what can be done to resolve them?*

&gt; *And finally, two questions about the sim itself: Does the simulation of NPC trading affect faction influence and state, or is it assumed to result in no net change? What is the difference between Wealth and Standard of Living?*

&gt; **A - Michael:** Part of the reason for posting this update was to provide a bit more clarity on how the system works - some genuine bugs have been found, but there's also a lot of misconceptions, or assumptions about how it works.

&gt; There is NPC trading in the simulation, but that's done as aggregate, rather than modelling individual ships.

&gt; Only players can change influence and state.

&gt; Wealth is the accumulation of resources where standard of living represents how comfortable the citizens are.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Q - adrinker:** *This is unfortunate, because it really doesn't help the state of the game with regards to content. This is basically micro-powerplay. Can you take some time to compile and address the significant posts out there that address the real issues of the game?*

&gt; * *Where is the focus/updates on polishing Horizons?*
&gt; * *Where is the varied terrain*
&gt; * *The planets need so much more to make them a viable experience. There are almost no responses for what is planned on that front.*

&gt; *There are some very significant threads where people have invested time, yet the devs have not responded at all. It would be comforting to know what is actually planned for the future of horizons.*

&gt; **A - Michael:** Horizons is just the start of Season 2, there's a lot still to come which we'll talk about in detail as we progress through the coming months. Adding more gameplay to the surface is very much a focus.",2016-01-07 17:03:37+00:00,cyphkwm,1.0,t3_3zwbmc,369.0,EliteDangerous

Being there from the beginning (Oct 2012) I've seen the development as it's progressed, and knew that expansions would follow from 1yr after launch.  I was an idiot for not buying the LTXP when it was first available.

The price was a shock (£30 to existing owners), but knowing it'll be discounted during sales like ED was/is (Spring 25%, Summer 33%, Autumn 50%, Winter 75%) I can see the benefits of their financial model, if indeed it is unusual.  The basegame will be receiving updates too: missions, ships, profession improvements, weapons/shields, faction changes, etc.

I was surprised each time someone bought the game at full price *outside* of the sales (£40 before August, £30 after), as it didn't make sense to me; why buy after a sale had already happened, when you can simply wait until the next one?

Being a space fan, the enjoyment I've had from the game has been worth every penny - as with most cockpit-based space games I've played.  Now I have the LTXP, the additions coming to the game are a huge, welcome bonus :)

4889,"&gt; I'm quite salty about it.

Same here.  AMD's driver team are severely lagging behind the times, causing us [many frustrations with games](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2015-amd-radeon-r9-380x-review):

&gt; The only hesitation we have in recommending this or any other AMD card comes down to driver support. The games tested here mostly have mature drivers, which push AMD's hardware to the fore, while releases like Star Wars Battlefront have demonstrated a palpable advantage for Radeon architecture - but elsewhere, the picture isn't rosy. There are still stuttering issues in The Witcher 3's CPU-intensive areas months on from release, while AMD dropped the ball badly with a lack of day one driver support for Fallout 4, resulting in very poor performance. Just Cause 3 also exhibited hitching and stuttering issues, even on top-end cards like R9 380, R9 390 and Fury X. These sorts of issues cannot be resolved by tweaking settings because inherently, the GPU hardware itself is not at fault. We really need to see AMD match Nvidia's commitment to launch day driver updates with proper optimisation.

&gt; The issues we've observed all seem to be related to the driver's CPU overhead and its lack of multi-thread support - and even with the release of the recent Crimson driver, DX11 performance is still clearly under par.

&gt; Hopefully, AMD will resolve this at some point, but when similar issues continue to arise around the launch of key titles, it is clearly a cause for concern. We suspect that this will be far less of an issue when DX12 is the norm (AMD's driver performance there looks sensational) but the reality is that DX11 will remain with us for a long time yet, practically demanding that AMD ups its game. Class-leading hardware clearly requires a corresponding level of software support - and we hope AMD takes that onboard going in to 2016.",2015-12-31 11:40:42+00:00,cyh7n7j,2.0,t1_cyh5wwi,7362.0,EliteDangerous

From David Braben's statement earlier:

&gt; Requiring DX11 and 64 bit OS has enabled us to do truly stunning things on the planets. Elite Dangerous has always been 64 bit internally, but we couldn’t continue to support older 32 bit OS tech. **This has meant we needed a new minimum spec, so it needs to be a new game, and as a new game we can set a new minimum spec.** We do understand some of the issues players have mentioned with Steam because it is a separate game – for example wanting recorded play hours to be combined across the seasons. We know this is frustrating for some people, and so it is something we plan to address shortly.

5025,"[Alternatively, there's the commonly accepted definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game):

&gt; A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.

In ED we don't:

* assume the roles of characters (either literally or via a generic class)
* act out roles within a narrative (one at least affected by us individually)
* use literal acting
* use structured decision making (conversation/decision trees)
* have character development (+1 strength etc)

It could be argued that our ships &amp; SRVs have ""formal systems of rules and guidelines"", but our avatars certainly don't at the moment.

I wouldn't be so sure about that :)

* They already have a server/client model.  All transactions - FSD jumps, supercruise, purchases, trading, etc, are done via the server.  More and more new features are being added to the server backend.
* P2P is used for any multiplayer activities: PvP, co-op PvE, text chat, voice comms, etc.  It's gradually being improved and optimised, but there's still quite a way to go, with various compatibility issues due to some cheap/rubbish home routers that FDev need to work around.
* Rare as they are, Logoffski's and cheaters are slowly caught and shadow-banned.
* The planetside stations/bases are stored on the server, and so can be dynamically altered.  As opposed to 99.99% of spacestations that are stored client-side, and therefore require a patch to change.  They plan to gradually add spacestations stored serverside too, using the dynamic tech.
* They're looking into player-groups controlling planetside bases/stations, because the dynamic tech supports it.  They're not considering spacestations (yet).
* Hireable NPC wingmates are planned.
* NPC simulation persistence (it's called Tier 2 NPCs in the DDA) is coming soon™.

###Instructions to create your own custom menu background

1. Convert your video from .MPG to .WEBM, e.g. via [Zamzar](http://www.zamzar.com/convert/mpg-to-webm/)
2. Navigate to this folder: DRIVE:\Steam\steamapps\common\Elite Dangerous\Products\ELITEVERSION\Movies (Directory may vary depending on what drive &amp; game version you're using)
3. Locate the file called FrontEnd0.webm - this is the video that plays in the background of your main menu screen. Instead of deleting the file, simply rename it and give that name to your new video instead. (That way you can easily revert the change should you wish to)
4. Once this is done, the game will recognise the new video as the default one, and it'll play in the background of the main menu whenever you start up the game.

5117,"From the ""Everything we know so far on Season 2 (Horizons)"" link in the topbar, regarding update 1.6/2.1 titled ""Loot &amp; Crafting"":

&gt; * Some elements of Looting &amp; Crafting (L&amp;C) will be available in the initial 2.0 release.
&gt; * The actual L&amp;C System will be available during the first update to Horizons, most likely in Q1 (Jan - Mar 2016).
&gt; * Some looting and crafting will be available to people not upgrading to Horizons.
&gt; * Without being overly complicated it will allow a greater degree of customisation and power to the ships.
&gt; * Loot will be found in various place in the galaxy for example on planetary surfaces or in wrecked vessels.
&gt; * It will be based on a reward system to assist explorers, combatants, traders, miners and bounty hunters with each having different L&amp;C options available.
&gt; * Examples given at EGX included the ability to create different coloured and powered lasers along with and guns that would create malfunctions in enemy ships systems.
&gt; * The systems would also allow for the subversion and normal weapons and module types.
&gt; * FDev also commented that, ""we're looking at a method for one off boosts for jump ranges with loot.""

And under ""Core Game Improvements"":

&gt; * Some looting and crafting options will be available in the base game. L&amp;C related to planetary surfaces will obviously not be.
&gt; * Core missions are being enhanced for the basic game and include military, ranking and Powerplay missions.
&gt; * Missions can now be received in space, so they’re not always taken from the Bulletin Board and can be received from encounters with other ships. A variant on this are missions that can be triggered by scooping certain items in space.
&gt; * Timed assassination missions will be available from the Bulletin Boards, similar to the assassination missions in FFE you need to find your target at a certain time and place.
&gt; * This timing mechanism is also available for other mission types where the mission target can only be found at a specific time.
&gt; * Missions can now have multiple stages – this applies as sequences of the same mission type, so delivering goods to a station and then bring something else back.
&gt; * Note that this isn’t fully chained missions yet (which we define as different missions in a sequence), although these are planned as part of the Horizons season. A specific variant on this are tasks that have to be completed after a successful assassination. 
&gt; * A survival element to missions means that a player will have to survive specific encounters before being able to complete a specific mission, for example delivering secret information to a contact while being hunted. 
&gt; * Another aspect for a player to be aware of are those that require them to be completed without being scanned – something I’m sure skilled smugglers will have an advantage with. 
&gt; * Michael Brookes also said that ""There are a couple of other elements too – but I’ll keep them as a surprise for you!""
&gt; * Passenger Missions are still planned but will not be making an appearance in 1.5.

&gt; * Craig at Frontier commented, ""We're planning on introducing a variety of new structures, based on the CQC environments, into the main game during the Horizons season.""

&gt; * ""We do want to add more astronomical phenomenon in the future, but these will key into specific gameplay. The personal favourite of mine is comets.""
&gt; * According to Sandro Sammarco at some point in Season 2 FDev will take ""another look at weapons, including missiles (and mines). I can say with some confidence that missiles won't be reverted back to their initial values, but I agree that they could use some buffing (and mines too!)

&gt; * Asked about the possibility of Commander's requesting the delivery of a ship to a station of a Commanders chosing, FDev replied, ""This is something on our radar and is something we’re keen to implement in the game as part of a future update, but we have nothing to announce on that at the moment.""
&gt; * Regarding future CQC updates FDev responded with, ""We have something very special planned for the CQC tournament that everybody will be able to get involved in.

5133,"Prior to the latest sale, the Steam score was 72% positive from ~8.2k reviews (I last looked a fortnight ago) - it's currently 71% from ~9.3k.  So, a drop in 1% after ~1100 new reviews since the sale started, during which 145k new CMDRs joined.

For a game to achieve/maintain a ~75% positive score, there has to be 3 positive reviews for every 1 negative.

Maths time:

* 71% of 9300 = 6603
* 72% of 8200 = 5904
* 6603-5904 = 699 +ve
* 699/1100 = 0.635

During the past fortnight, ~63.5% of ~1100 Steam players liked ED enough to post a positive review, out of ~565k potential reviewers.

ED certainly has some gameplay flaws that become apparent after extended game time.  These however cannot be resolved quickly.

Meanwhile, it also has a steep learning curve, can be difficult at first, and doesn't hold your hand.  A fair proportion of today's gamers don't like those factors - they want to be spoon-fed gameplay, with difficulty and depth coming later as they get accustomed to a game's mechanics.  Early-access games are forgiven for this, and seen as a challenge, but released games are expected to be pick-up-and-play and easy-to-grasp.  ED chucks you in the deep end: sink or swim.

Reading the negative reviews, there are a fair number that reviewed/refunded within 2hr, citing difficulty of control and not knowing how to play - whether they've finished, or even attempted, the tutorials is an adequate query.

Completely agree, edited my post accordingly.

&gt; it's pretty clear there's a much smaller team working on the expansions, for instance.

FDev don't appear to wholly segment their Dev teams between projects (ED, Horizons, Planet Coaster, ED season 3).  Instead they're broken down by their discipline.  For example, they've an Audio team that are working on both current games. And the Stellar Forge (ED's procedural generation tech) team do updates for ED, Horizons, and no doubt prep-work for upcoming Seasons - new Stations &amp; Outposts, Comets, new PLandings (Volcanic, Atmospheric, Life-Bearing, Cities), stellar phenomena, etc - ready for the team of Artists to create in 3D.

There'll certainly be devs that won't transition between games: an artist specialising in the Pixar-esque Peep artwork for Planet Coaster, won't be constructing Stations for ED.

&gt; Key changes include:

&gt; * this will be the first time that consumers have had clear legal rights for digital content - specifically, the Act gives consumers the right to repair or replacement of faulty digital content such as online films and games, music downloads, and ebooks
&gt; * a 30 day time period to return faulty goods and get a full refund, the law was previously unclear on how long this period should last
&gt; * after 30 days, retailers have one opportunity to repair or replace any goods and the consumer can choose whether they want the goods to be repaired or replaced - if the attempt at a repair or replacement is unsuccessful, the consumer can then claim a refund or a price reduction if they wish to keep the product
&gt; * for the first time there are clear rules for what should happen if a service is not carried out with reasonable care and skill or as agreed with the consumer - the service provider will have to put the service right in line with what was agreed or, if that is not practical, must give some money back
&gt; * consumers being able to challenge terms and conditions which are not fair or are hidden in the small print

Steam take ~30% cut from sales we know, so there's that.  Maximise sales through FDev store first as its good business sense.

And Steam's no quibble refund can be gamed to play something then get your money back if you don't enjoy it, which could just prove as hassle for both FDev and Valve.  High learning curve of the game and all.

&gt; ###Community Spotlight: [CMDR Abacus (Ambassador Reinhard)](http://i.imgur.com/E05iWD5.jpg)

&gt; #####You get involved in the Elite community a lot – what makes you feel like you want to do so?

&gt; My involvement really begun when I was invited to be part of the wonderful EDDE team, the admins and moderators of [elitedangerous.de](http://elitedangerous.de), the fan-forum for the German-speaking community.

&gt; This was when I realized how amazing the elite community really was and still is. Very kind and welcoming to new members and full of creativity. Supporting the elite community always takes first place simply because the Commanders are well worth every effort.

&gt; In 2015 I even made it to Lavecon and loved every minute of it. So many famous Commanders, so many interesting activities and so precious few time available. It was like being a kid in a toy shop that is completely overwhelmed by the display.

&amp;nbsp; 

&gt; #####Tell us about your time as an ambassador? How did you first start? Any highlights from your time as an ambassador?

&gt; For me it started when Eddie Symons called for a German-speaking ambassador for Gamescom 2014. As soon as I read about it my application was on its way.

&gt; At that time I was already part of the EDDE team and had some contact with Eddie on our forum. At Gamescom 2014 I instantly felt at home with the Frontier family and made first contact with journalists from all over the world. It surprised me that I had to do a lot more presentations in English than in German and sometimes even in front of a camera!

&gt; My highlights there were the evenings after the show where we all sat together and enjoyed our well-deserved rest and chatted for hours.

&gt; For me it was out of question to get back for Gamescom 2015. This time we had a stunning big booth in the public area starring the Cobra model. It was an absolutely crazy and intense time with thousands of visitors. Witnessing a new Commander realizing the insane scope of ED for the first time is priceless.

&gt; I enjoyed my time in Cologne very much (again) with all the Commanders from the elite meet, Frontier and of course my fellow ambassadors.

&gt; Fun highlight for me was being on the XBox stage with Eddie each day and trying not to screw it up flying with a Gamepad.

&gt; The same year I managed to sneak into EGX - officially as group contact for the United German Commanders (UGC) - but I just couldn't resist to side with the EGX-ambassadors and support them a bit over the weekend.

&gt; Fun highlight (besides meeting the Frontier crew, the ambassadors, all the old and new Commanders...you get the point) was being welcomed with a warm 'You are crazy!' from Zac and some others from Frontier.

&gt; Being an ambassador for Elite is a privilege, an amazing experience and a nice way to say 'Thank you' to all at Frontier and the ED-community.

&amp;nbsp; 

&gt; #####Are you involved in any of the amazing groups and sub communities within Elite?

&gt; Together with more than 130 Commanders I am a member of the UGC. This is a very humorous and welcoming player community whose members engage in all aspects of Elite except piracy. We already organized or helped to organize several events like the 'Leornard Nimoy Memorial Run' where more than 150 Commanders all over the world participated or a joint racing event from the [French](http://elite-dangerous.fr) and the [German](http://elitedangerous.de) communities. We are evaluating racing events organised by AURA (Aulin Racing Association)[greetings to Commanders Schmutzhuhn [UGC] and Razoas [UGC-DF]] at the moment and will probably invite other interested CMDRs soon™.

&gt; We have friendly contacts to most - if not all - of the other player groups that are active on the EDDE-forum...not necessarily in-game but at least on the forum.

&gt; Many thanks to former, current, future council members (currently CMDR Luchslistig [UGC], CMDR ICHO TOLOT [UGC], CMDR Von Awesome [UGC]) for organising the community of UGC-Commanders.

&amp;nbsp; 

&gt; #####What sort of player are you in game?

&gt; I am especially fond of any sort of cooperative play in the galaxy and try every aspect of the game. Exploration is something special for me as this is the only activity where you get a glimpse of how mindboggingly huge Elite really is.

&amp;nbsp; 

&gt; #####How long have you been playing Elite for?

&gt; My first Elite experience I made with the good old wireframes on the Commodore 64. The kickstarter for Elite Dangerous took me completely by surprise and I needed some time to realize that this is really the successor of the worshipped Elite-games. I guess ED and the community will keep me busy for many years to come and I am looking forward to it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####Do you have anything else you’d like to tell the Elite community about?

&gt; Elite meets are always special for me. I have met a lot of wonderful people from Frontier and the Elite community at numerous occasions like the premiere event, Lavecon, Cologne Elite Meet and several smaller meetings organized by members of the EDDE-forum. Sometimes I know the names, sometimes even the voice but it is always fun and different when I can have a great time in real life with other Commanders.

&gt; It never ceases to amaze me how passionate, welcoming and creative the community is. So many Commanders record or even stream videos, write stories, record music, design ED-themed items or even games and so on.

&gt; Finally I want to send a big hug to the EDDE team for the fantastic time we had so far and looking forward to more on the Horizon, right on Commanders!

&gt; The names of these amazing Commanders are Ecodrive, Kaito, Higgs, Atlas, Exiter [UGC], Frame, Friedrich Nix [RoA], Hans von Stoffeln, Irrstern, klein Meme, Knoellchen, Luchslistig [UGC], Mc Cloud 2K9, Rabbit-HH [UGC], Saber Rider - [elitedangerous.de/forum](http://www.elitedangerous.de/forum/memberlist.php?mode=leaders)",2015-12-07 16:11:34+00:00,cxqctlv,1.0,t3_3vsxao,399.0,EliteDangerous

5241,"If they jump from a low-wake, then it'd be the same as option 3 for the Chaser: return to the initial system and carry on looking for targets.

&gt; ""dormant"" wakes will likely never be added as that would require a restructure of the entire instance structure so the wake scanner makes 0 sense.

As we already know, the servers (transaction/matchmaking) keep track of players in instances. My idea is as follows, based on current machanics:

* To jump away from the Chaser, the Target's client has to tell the server, hence leaving the wake. 
* Chaser uses the Wake Scanner, which asks the server the Targets destination.
* Upon scan success, the server stores the Chaser's &amp; Target's info in its matchmaking database (let's call the datastore ""Target Tracking"").
* Chaser initiates jump to the Target's system, and tells the server.
* Whether the target high wakes again, or low wakes, his client still must tell the server.
* When Chaser arrives in the Target's system, matchmaking server uses the ""Target Tracking"" datastore to spawn the appropriate Wake, allowing the chase to continue.
* If the Target instantly low wakes, then high wakes while the Chaser is in SC, the server-spawned low Wake is replaced by a spawned high Wake, allowing the Chase to continue.
* The ""Target Tracking"" entry is updated or deleted accordingly.

&gt; Not to mention finding where they jumped to is as easy as lining the wake up with potential targets. Get good enough at it and it's faster than using a wake scanner.

Except as you &amp; we rightly say, the Target may not be findable at the new location, hence the idea of Dormant Wakes.",2015-12-07 15:12:31+00:00,cxqaolb,5.0,t1_cxq9psi,1811.0,EliteDangerous

5244,"&gt; That's pretty dull game play, hoping someone eventually runs out of fuel. Wouldn't you rather just want to fight?

Personally the latter, yes. But each to their own, and think of the emergent stories:

Chaser #1: ""With my spare fuel tank, I've chased this noob-ganking CMDR back &amp; forth between two systems, and finally got him!  He's no fuel left so no escape now...""

Chaser #2: ""Been tracking this guy for 11 jumps now, from one random system to another and another.  The git led me into a trap where his wingmates were waiting - barely survived the jump out of there, 23% hull left.  Hope I make it back to a station...""

Target #3: ""After a long trip my fuel reserves were low.  Pirates spotted me for my cargo.  Haha the fools!  Tried chasing me so I jumped and low-waked, but the tank's almost empty now.  After hiding for a while I low-waked back into SC to check the System - they were lying in wait - but I had just enough time to refuel and jump again.  My tank's larger than theirs, so in a few jumps I'll be distant stardust to them...""",2015-12-07 14:25:52+00:00,cxq989k,7.0,t1_cxq8mt8,1300.0,EliteDangerous

Keep up the chase.  One of them will run out of fuel first.

Upon arrival, the pirate/bountyhunter finds no target in SuperCruise, they then know there's one of three possibilities:

1. Target low waked
2. Target jumped to another random system
3. Target jumped back to the initial system

Until wakes are left in dormant instances for 5 minutes - server-managed as clients communicate with the server every time they jump &amp; arrive, as per the matchmaking system - then only 1 and 3 can have actions taken.

* 1. Sit and wait until target reappears in SuperCruise.  Note that the target *doesn't* know the chaser has followed them there.
* 3. Jump back to the initial system and wait for the target there, while hunting for new targets.

&gt; 1. The heat generation from small Banks and low recharge make the size 4 SCBs quite useless on bigger ships.
&gt; 2. Size 5 SCBs are okay, but inefficient. What I mean is they recharge a bit better, but you need to couple 2 together w/1 heat sink to see much gain in shields. This heat generated up to 91% heat. Sure I didnt over heat, but I was sitting still doing nothing. Add boosting and/or firing weapons you would over heat. Well why not use 2 heat sinks instead? That's where efficiency comes to play. You have a limited number of heat sinks (4 per module), and most ships have 4 Utility slots. I am however focusing on the big ships that use 8 utilities as that is what I have been testing. You need all the heat sinks you can get and make the most out of them. #3 tells you why.
&gt; 3. Size 6 SCBs! This is the sweet spot for large ships. I use B6's for power management and an additional charge. Size 6 banks require one heat sink per bank. You keep you heat low and recharge a LOT of shields back. Check out that coriolis build above for the example. I only have one set of SCBs. I could have another size 5 bank set, but then I need more heat sinks. More heat sink = weaker shields. You cannot afford to have or use size 5 banks at the cost of more heat sinks to weaken your shields.
&gt; 4. Size 7 SCBs. Holy crap are these strong or what? Check out the Corvette fight to see those in action. I use 2 B7 with 2 heat sinks. So you need one heat sink per B7 charge. Its super effective nuff said.
&gt; 5. The corvette has one more internal slot than the cutter, and they are just better sizes for power management and combat. The corvette to me has room for a second set of SCBs (if you are good enough or jump out of the fight...wait 20 seconds...jump back in) Builds may vary.

&gt; #####Conclusion: For me Only size 6 and 7 SCBs are worth using heat sinks with.

&gt; ###Moving on to other things. Module damage.

&gt; In the module test video we used a huge PA. Just what we chose. There are many tests that could be done. Like pulses or cannons. Noting a few things about this test specifically about the my Conda. It had almost 4k armor! So this is a test with armor. Results may vary with no armor. I will have to test and see. Given I had so much armor the PA damaged modules 1 out of 4 times a 25% chance to cause damage it seemed. Observations:

&gt; 1. I would not stick around with no shields in a big ship
&gt; 2. The drive on the cutter are vulnerable now, and the Conda's drives are still easy to hit.
&gt; 3. Armor greatly reduces damage while ramming.
&gt; 4. Ramming does a fixed number of MJ damage based off velocity and angle (probably mass as well). (The Cutter CAN out ram a Conda, but results may vary depending on what alpha damage the ships take before the ram, and if they Shield bank before the ram)

&gt; ###Finally I come to Synthesis

&gt; Oh lets keep this short. Unless you are an explorer this isnt for you. I can see how useful it would be for the AFM repair, but when it comes to reloading ammo...well watch the reloading Synthesis video. I testing it out with rail guns because that runs out of ammo the fastest. After 5 hours of filling my 300 cargo space with materials I was able to refill 3 to 4 times. Now it only refills half the magazine so its not even that efficient. 5 hours gone in 13:37 seconds  see what I did there?...no? oh well. Anyway fights probably will not last that long in wing fights. Now torpedoes and Missiles I could see benefiting from the greatly...given that you can find the mats for them. Ever complain about running out of Multi ammo in your FDL? Well this can solve your issue, BUT you have to reload 4 different modules. The synthesis will tell you have many reloads you have left. Then back to another 4-5 hours of ""grinding"" with no actual profit being made.

&gt; #####Conclusion: IMO Dont waste your time. Unless you are prepping to explore for a long time.

&gt; If you made it this far and Read the whole thing I thank you for it. This is not a nerf or buff post. This is an observation post. I hope this helps.",2015-12-06 19:35:43+00:00,cxpd7a2,1.0,t3_3voxvn,584.0,EliteDangerous

5312,"&gt; 60 dollars is quite over priced for an expansion of this scale considering I've already spent 75 on the base game back in Beta.  If I'm expected to double what I've already spent to get the addition of planetary landings and some more ships, what does that say about the value of the base game?

Ok...

1. Horizons costs $45 to you, not $60.
2. You *chose* (not forced) to pay an extra $15 to get the extra playtesting time: 3 months beta &amp; 1 month gamma before release, and extra beta periods before each major release of Season 1 since.
3. Paying $45 (Horizons) is not doubling $60 (ED release), let alone $75 (ED beta).
4. The base game was on sale for $15, 11 months after release, 25% of its initial price. Standard policy for a ~1yr old game.

More free content is coming to the basegame: ships, missions, loot &amp; crafting. No doubt more - we'll learn of it in good time.

&gt; * Some looting and crafting will be available to people not upgrading to Horizons.
&gt; * Without being overly complicated it will allow a greater degree of customisation and power to the ships.
&gt; * Loot will be found in various place in the galaxy for example on planetary surfaces or in wrecked vessels.
&gt; * It will be based on a reward system to assist explorers, combatants, traders, miners and bounty hunters with each having different L&amp;C options available.
&gt; * Examples given at EGX included the ability to create different coloured and powered lasers along with and guns that would create malfunctions in enemy ships systems.
&gt; * The systems would also allow for the subversion and normal weapons and module types.
&gt; * FDev also commented that, ""we're looking at a method for one off boosts for jump ranges with loot.""

&gt; First of all, it appears EVGA have released a firmware update in an effort to help alleviate this problem in Elite and other games. Discussed [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3txi86/anyone_else_have_to_underclock_their_gpu_to_run/cxa1sih) by Reddit user /u/StuartGT (Thanks Stu). If you are to take on the responsibility of updating your cards BIOS please note that you'll have to do this at your own risk. I'm just providing information as much as I can 

&gt; The next interesting thing is that one of our awesome players recently came to us on a hunch after capping his framerate at 60 and removing this problem entirely. Essentially this takes the top-end of the strain off the card which is what is causing these high-end cards to fall foul of this bug. Please feel free to try this one, should you be achieving extremely high framerates and running into this error.

&gt; Feedback as always, is extremely welcome.

If your card is not by EVGA, then contact the appropriate manufacturer, or [find a BIOS update yourself](https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/) and risk the procedure without warranty support.",2015-12-05 22:50:36+00:00,cxohm4q,4.0,t1_cxoffqe,3760.0,Games

Depends what you mean by ""it"".  Until 15.10 in October, GTA5 was plagued by severe crash bugs ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/3p1qhl/amd_r9_390x_gta_1510_update/)).

I completely agree with your statement though, AMD (and Nvidia) will prioritise games based on number of users.

Unfortunately, more and more games need specific driver fixes from both GPU camps.  And since ED is such a **major** VR title, they should really be putting more effort into it.  Also all VR buyers will choose Nvidia instead.",2015-12-05 20:41:11+00:00,cxod5fk,3.0,t1_cxnkraa,72275.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; Keep an eye on GalNet for when the beta-only Community Goal goes live.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; Greetings Commanders, 

&gt; LHS 3262 Solutions has reported the theft of a valuable experimental data core. The core, which has been in development for some time, has been described as being “of great importance” to LHS 3262 Solutions, and a generous reward has been offered for its safe return. The precise location of the thieves is not known and Security services in the LHS 3262 system, where LHS 3262 Solutions is based, have been unable to track the thieves, but they have determined that the criminals recently visited three systems: Eleu, Pijan and Baris.

&gt; LHS 3262 Solutions has stressed that the core must be recovered soon, before it degrades and becomes unusable and are offering a rich reward for the first pilot to return the item to their facility at Whitworth Park on Akan.

&gt; As an additional reward, the pilot that returns with the data core will also be awarded a special code to obtain a new ship paint job of their choice.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; Community Goal:

&gt; ###Find the Stolen Data Core

&gt; * LHS 3262, Whitworth Park on Akan, search for clues to recover the stolen data core.

&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; This week saw the beta release for Horizons Planetary Landings and an updated 1.5 beta build. An update was released on Tuesday and we’re planning another update before the end of the week.

&gt; There’s a ton of changes and new features to get to grips with so if you want to know more about them then watch the Commander Training Live stream from Tuesday evening with Adam and Ed – [you can view it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhGyDAKkUQg)

&gt; It’s also worth taking a look at [Sandro’s Quick Start Guide here](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=205118)

&gt; The beta itself has been busier with many of you eager to see the planets up close and that’s generated some excellent feedback on the new features in the update. We’re reviewing issues and comments and addressing as needed, some of the changes in the beta 3 release as a result of that feedback. While we often cannot respond directly to these discussions, they are noted and feed into our internal decision making on changes.

&gt; I’ve mentioned this on the forums already I’d like to reiterate that the current SRV death behaviour of returning to port is not the intended behaviour, you should restore to your ship – unless your ship has been destroyed. Also if your SRV is destroyed then you shouldn’t lose your exploration data, again unless your ship has been destroyed. These fixes should be in for next week’s build.

&gt; We also have some additional changes coming for explorers to integrate some of the new features into their progression a little more. The first addition is an exploration rank increase when finding materials for the first time. Subsequent material finds will provide a small increase to the Commander’s explorer rank value. Searching planets by driving in the SRV will also accrue explorer rank increases and the bonus is scaled depending on how far away from Sol you are.

&gt; Based on testing and feedback we’re extending the base fuel range for the SRV, and with the materials capacity by preparing in advance you can have plenty of refills for the fuel. In addition the bonus effect from the fuel synthesis is also going to be changed so it improves fuel efficiency rather than boosting the shield. This change might come in a bit late for the 2.0 release, so may come in 2.1. Another change to synthesis is that we’re toning down the damage bonuses before the Horizons release.

&gt; For the detailed surface scans we shall increase the payouts for these for the Horizons and 1.5 release.

&gt; And to finish up Zac has been busy putting together some fun activities over the Christmas period – we’re supporting SpecialEffect with a 24 hour charity livestream. You can find our more on this and the other [events we’re running here](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=205161).

&gt; #Paul Watson, [HCS Voicepacks](http://hcsvoicepacks.com/)

&gt; Paul Watson from HCS voicepacks tell us about his love for the Elite Dangerous community (and how they've been invaluable) and explains what voice attack is, and how HCS voicepacks work hand in hand with the voice control technology.

&gt; ###1 – What are HCS voicepacks?

&gt; An HCS Voice Pack is a massive collection of pre-recorded vocal responses by a chosen actor. Each response is designed to realistically react in real time to your given vocal command, using a microphone. This creates a very convincing illusion of being accompanied by a virtual assistant.  For instance, you speak into your microphone the command, “Take off”, and the response by the virtual assistant would be, “Yes commander, ascending to 30 metres, handing you the controls”.  Not only does the the virtual assistant respond vocally, it will also carry out the manoeuvre for you.  Some of the virtual assistants contain additional responses, factual and educational material about our galaxy and the constellations, quantum theory and more. 

&gt; ###2 - What gave you the idea to do packs for Elite Dangerous?

&gt; The packs, the sets of pre-recorded files themselves are dependent on software called Voice Attack. I saw Voice Attack back in 2014 and saw it being used in games just for key presses. After more research and Googling I saw the text to speech responses being used here and there – nothing major, just confirmation phrases, boring stuff. I quickly downloaded a demo, and started playing around with it – My partner is less able than most and has difficulty using a mouse and keyboard, so I tried to set it up with The Sims for her… and failed, so I put it down.  A little later I saw Elite: Dangerous and entered the Beta stage, set up a profile to use with Voice Attack and started showing it off on YouTube –  I built a larger profile with all the responses required to fly the ship and do the other stuff – then shared that to 100 users in the Elite: Dangerous community. Then got in touch with Gary from Voice Attack and opened dialogue for the first time in June 2014 with him. Explained to him that I had a plan :).  Since then, Gary has developed most of what Voice Attack does today around the work I’ve done with the packs themselves and feedback from the people using them.  

&gt; ###3 – You’ve had a lot of support from our community, can you give us some examples?

&gt; The community have been invaluable.  After all they are the people using these packs, and since the very beginning, the early adopters were offered the chance to suggest more responses for each command so that I could give them a more varied set of them, instead of just one single response – They quickly responded with many of these – I then compiled them, the additional educational stuff and then gave it back to them. The extra stuff from the community and the educational additions gave the pack real value; It was the community that wholly suggested  “This has some real worth” and things like “I’d pay for something like this if it was Norman Lovett”. So… it became a saleable commodity in its own right very quickly from that point. Organically it started to grow, and with that, along came more requests for more and more SciFi legends.  

&gt; ###4 – How has it been working with the ED community? Has it been a rewarding experience?

&gt; I’ve learned a great deal from the community in terms of what they want from the packs, and tried my very best to work with them, and deliver exactly what they ask for.  And so far, all the packs have been very well received by the community – we’re fortunate to have a collective of wonderful people in the community. And I am absolutely blown away by the massive amount of kind emails – People saying extraordinary things about how much it has changed their experience whilst gaming… Others explaining that they can’t play the game without the packs, loads of others. It is very rewarding, and I sometimes have to take a breath just to take it all in, I adore it when I know people are really enjoying using a virtual assistant. Many people tell me that they feel like they are real. I always think about the ramifications of that, should somebody end up emotionally attached to their virtual assistant ;). 

&gt; ###5 – Which voicepack are you particularly fond of?

&gt; I use most of them - Although Jazz is the pack I use for most. I find Jazz the most believable, I’m not sure why but Jazz seems to have all the bases covered for me. I think it maybe down to how I first imagined how a ship’s virtual assistant should sound like. Jazz certainly fits the ship very well.  But she is complimented by Midnight and also Minus… I don’t know, I love them all.

&gt; ###6 - It must have been a lot of fun but hard work to put these packs together? Can you talk us through the process?

&gt; It starts with a bunch of comments from the community – They name drop Tom Baker, Brian Blessed and all those names they want as a virtual assistant.  I sit and think about casting carefully.  Then I wait. And then one day, I wake up, decide who I’m going to try and cast, and just get on with it quickly – booking studios and all that stuff.  The main script is identical for most stuff in the packs, the commands and so on, so that bit is simple.  The additional flavoured stuff and naming the characters is pretty challenging sometimes – For actors to be able to perform believable lines, they have to have belief in the character… So I find writing up background stuff very hard indeed.  Once all that’s done and out of the studio, the post production is just lots of tiresome file renaming and Voice Attack profile work, which of course I have helpers for.  It is a very mundane part of the job, but the people I have helping with that are brilliant!  And testing the profiles once done is very rewarding – that’s the moment when you see all the work getting it done coming to fruition – A whole new virtual assistant is born!

&gt; ###7 – What made you decide to work with Elite specifically? Are you a fan of Elite Dangerous – do you get much chance to play yourself? If so, what kind of player are you?

&gt; I don’t think I would have paid much attention to Elite had my school friend not shown me the game all those years ago.  A dear friend of mine, he had the original Elite.  I used to watch him play it, yes just watch! On a dining chair he’d place next to him at his computer – he’d say, “right! Sit there, don’t touch anything! Just watch this” – So I’d sit and watch, I was about 11 or 12 – And that’s all it was, something I watched, occasionally he’s let me have a go – albeit minutes before his flapping hands would usher me away from the keyboard.  That was many decades ago, I knew as soon as I saw Elite: Dangerous available I just had to get it.  I just wish that my friend was here to share in the wonder of it all today.  Sadly he died 4 years ago, I miss him immensely.  But he’s always at the back of my mind, and with me each time I play the game, or I’m in the studio, or writing stuff.  He’d have loved all this.

&gt; I only play in the Rift – I love it.  And I usually always play solo, and mix up what I do – that’s the real beauty of it – you can do whatever you wish.  I’ve got about 3-4 ships, favourite is the Asp and around 50 million credits too, so I’ve put a fair amount of player time in – fitting it in with the pack work is painful – I get very disappointed that I don’t have the energy to play sometimes, especially around the times we have to update them all.  But I am looking forward to an entire day sometime soon, where I can sit and do nothing else but explore and stuff.

&gt; ###8 - *question missing*

&gt; ###9 – Is there anything else you want to tell the ED community about?

&gt; Just about how grateful and blessed I feel to be part of the community.  It’s magic!

&gt; ###10 – What’s next for voicepacks?

&gt; Buzz Aldrin if I can get him, not for an entire pack, just 20 lines that will work in conjunction with the rest of the packs ;).  I’d like that personally, I’m sure others would too.  On a serious note, I’d like to see them much further forward than they are right now – at the moment they do have limitations, so when we make the profiles we have to do an awful lot extra to make them work outside of games – Perhaps with new technology and some creative coding…. Well.

&gt; I have elite and I plan on getting SC, since they seem to be going for different aproaches.

Good for you, more space games is a good thing.  I'm once again a backer of SC after buying a fresh account during the blink-and-miss-out £23 daily sales, after [selling my Kickstarter account](https://redd.it/3oc34n) for a tidy profit, and look forward to playing it upon release late 2017.

I also plan on getting No Man's Sky (mid 2016) and Infinity Battlescape (late 2017), and have played dozens of space games during the past three decades.  It's great to see the genre rejuvenated. 

&gt; Sc is going for quality over quantity, while ED seems to be going for quantity while still having decent quality, and I want to see how this strategies play out in the end. So, what is your opinion on this matter?

Different development strategies by teams with different experience.

Frontier have been a multi-million-pound company for around a decade, and are experts of Procedural Generation gaming tech.  As a LTXP holder, I'm looking forward to seeing the game improve and expand through the years ahead.

With CIG's companies (~15 different entities now) having stabilised following their initial creating since Kickstarter, resulting in considerable and repeated delays (astonishingly foolish target dates tbf), its good to begin seeing some final results with 2.0 on PTU.  While release is still a couple of years away I'm enjoying watching its continuing development.

&gt; **Athan:** *So, that ""Glide Complete"" was at ~7.5km altitude, but also ~50km from the outpost. Which one triggered it? i.e. could you have glided at 2500 m/s for longer if you'd stayed higher? Or is it that 50km from target instead, meaning no way to extend the glide (and in fact you'll want to be lower when you hit that boundary)?*

&gt; **Mark Allen:** The glide currently disengages at ~7km above (an approximate) floor height, 11km short of face-firsting into the landscape, or when you come in too steep (60 degrees plus). If you don't want to take in the views you can dive bomb in a fair bit faster  - I've certainly managed orbit to landed on a small world within a minute, given an inappropriate disregard for safety.

&gt; **David Braben:** You can come out much closer if you prefer.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Majogl:** *Wow, i must say... Unless you get really close to that Icy surface, the textures don't look good at all... Hope that's gonna get better before horizons launches... Even from 100 meters above the planet, the icy ridges and hills just looked like random blobs of white...*

&gt; *Also is the gravity in this clip modified in any way? Europa is supposed to have roundabouts 0.13G and based on the hang-times of the SRV it seems higher. It could be just a feeling though.*

&gt; **David Braben:** On the textures - looking at the clip on Youtube does look a bit more blurry to me than the original. You will see for yourselves on Monday!

&gt; On the gravity - the SRV does stick you to the surface using the thrusters on the wheels, unless you manually thrust. The gravity should be correct.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Kris:** *If you look HUD it says 0.1G.*

&gt; *I don't think gravity is tied to driving model 1:1 (there is difference, but it is not 1:1). Gameplay over realism.*

&gt; **Jon Pace:** The real number of 0.13G was being clipped by the precision of 1 decimal place. I've upped this to 2 decimal places.

&gt; **David Braben:** It is, but is being overridden overtly rather than covertly - as each wheel as a directable thruster in it (visible in some of the multiplayer videos we've uploaded), which can stick you to the surface.

&gt; [Here's a video of what came next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9F0HC18sSI). The tumbling down the slope (oops) gives an indication of how this works.

And if so can you give us a vague indication of when they might be implemented, e.g. Horizons, Season 3?

&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; As I write this we’re all busy pushing to get the Horizons Beta released – we’ve announced that it will be released Monday 30th November.

&gt; There are a huge amount of changes for this release which always complicates testing and development. As I’m sure you’re aware we’re switching to a 64 bit-only client for Horizons (season 1 will remain available as a 32 bit client as well as 64 bit) which allows us to simulate the planet surfaces to the fidelity we want. This is obviously a big change and we’ll need you guys to help hammer through the game to shake out any issues once the beta is released.

&gt; I’d like to thank everyone who chipped in and organised sending us pizzas over the weekend and beyond – your generosity is much appreciated!

&gt; While Horizons Planetary Landings beta is available, access to the 1.5 beta will continue and will operate on the test servers. This required us to shut down and update the test servers, which is now complete. The 1.5 update will go live for Xbox One, PC and Mac at the same time as the Horizons store release. Issues addressed applicable to the 1.5 update that are found during the Horizons beta will be included in the 1.5 release.

&gt; One such change coming to both will be the increased speed of shield recharging while you are docked to complement the changes we’ve already applied to Shield Cell Banks. We’ve also fixed a number of issues raised during the 1.5 beta.

&gt; One of the big tasks for the Horizons Planetary Landings release is to populate the various settlements and ports throughout habited space and beyond. We’re using a different system to do this than we used for the star ports in orbit which gives us more flexibility with them. This means that we can more easily add new ones or upgrade existing ones, so this will feature in community goals moving forwards. We’ll take care to balance the community goals overall so season one only players can still participate in some of them. 

&gt; Placement of star ports in orbit involves interaction with Stellar Forge, so offering the same flexibility to change as with surface bases is a lot more complicated to do. We do plan on allowing the same level of changes in future, though. Note that this doesn’t mean the automatic creation of new facilities right away, but it’s a necessary part of that direction which is very much in our long range plan.

&gt; As well as the 1.5 release for Xbox One we’re working on the First Discovered By, Private Groups, DLC (such as paint jobs) features, as well as Horizons of course! We’ll provide more details on all these as we approach their release.

&gt; We’re also continuing to further improve the VR experience. HTC Vive and Steam VR support will be added to both the 1.5 and Horizons Beta as well as various bug fixes and tweaks. We’re continuing to work with Occulus, and will let you know as soon as there is any conclusion.

&gt; Thanks!

While there are no plans for further costs (subscriptions, expansions, etc) following release, apart from buy-limited-credits-with-real-cash and two more episodes of Sq42, the cost of running the servers may lead them to change their minds.  Couple of years until Persistent Universe is released, so anything can happen from a business standpoint.

5611,"&gt; My GPU (a EVGA GTX 980SC) is not at all overclocked past the speeds it ships with

It's *factory overclocked*, i.e. exceeds Nvidia's reference specification.

The crash occurs because GeForce Boost misinterprets periods of low-usage gameplay and incorrectly downclocks (based off reference speeds, not the factory overclocked speeds) the GPU, incorrectly causing the Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) protection.

These issues can be resolved if the card manufacturer (EVGA in your case) has fixed it with a new BIOS ([check here](https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/) and [more specifically here](https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/index.php?architecture=NVIDIA&amp;manufacturer=EVGA&amp;model=GTX+980&amp;interface=&amp;memType=&amp;memSize=)), or by downclocking towards/below Nvidia reference speeds, so GeForce Boost can work as intended.

&gt; Anyone else have to underclock their GPU to run Elite?

Yes quite a few CMDRs do - those with certain models of factory-overclocked cards.

&gt; 100% stable in all other games and Furmark.

[These TDR errors occur in plenty of games](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=geforce+tdr) - most recently The Witcher 3 - until Nvidia bypasses the issue on a game-by-game basis via driver updates.

&gt; ###[Gregg Chamberlain, Platform Lead/Senior Tester](http://i.imgur.com/7BCufqM.jpg)

&gt; ###What does an average day at work look like for you?

&gt; I get in around 8.15am and get settled in, get a drink and a couple of biscuits ready to start the day. I then prepare all the servers that are required for that mornings work. There could be up to seven. First thing I do, in conjunction with other Leads, is I specify any tasks and targets that we need to focus on for that day to the other team members. 

&gt; Most of the rest of the morning is taken up in making sure that issues coming in from external sources, including server logs, are being looked at, bugs that we find are being correctly reported, new features that are filtering down are having Test Cases written for them and, when available, ran though, liaising with production and other departments, and assisting them in identifying possible issues and getting them corrected, where possible, before they get to the public.

&gt; Just before we come back from lunch I update all the servers again to make sure we are always on the most recent builds on all our environments and we carry on as we did in the morning.  Investigating, reproducing, escalating, testing, reporting and always making sure that our team is focused on the correct areas.

&gt; One of the main responsibilities of a Lead is to make sure that we are focused on the correct aspect of the builds we have going out. So after a launch/update we make sure any new issues coming in are investigated by our respective teams. Once they have been dealt with we move on to the next content updates and make sure the new features work correctly and that they do not adversely affect existing systems, reporting everything we can, and give feedback where needed. 

&gt; Now depending on work load the day for me ends around 5.30 – 6 where I get in to my car and spend 20 -30mins in the Cambridge traffic.

&gt; ###What aspect of the game have you worked on that you are most proud of?

&gt; I am proud of the whole game in general as I have been working on it since Alpha and have touched every aspect of the game from Trading to Mining, Combat to Community goals and CQC. But the area that have spent the most time on was trading. I wrote the original test cases back before we released, and that was key for  me gaining the understanding of the game and its mechanics.

&gt; ###What's your favourite thing about Elite Dangerous?

&gt; The accuracy and the beauty of it. Especially with Horizons coming along so nicely. One minute you are flying though a 1:1 star system passing the local primary star and then you are landing on an airless moon in that system looking back up at the star you were just flying past.

&gt; ###What was the biggest challenge you came up against during game development?

&gt; Its size. As a member of QA you always want to make sure that the quality of the build going out is perfect. We are the last line between the guys coding, programming, drawing and designing  the game and the people going to play it. But trying to make sure every system, mechanical and actual are where they should be, looking correct and having the right AI/NPC/Function was daunting. 

&gt; ###What have you learned from working on Elite Dangerous?

&gt; Having the people putting the game together and the QA team all on the same site is invaluable. Things progress at a faster pace. If you have an issue you are only a step away from an answer.

&gt; ###Federation, Empire, or Alliance? And why?

5664,"&gt; In this week's Community Spotlight we talk to CMDR Kerenn about the Fuel Rats. Read some AMAZING Fuel Rats stats below...

&gt; [Fuel Rats logo](http://assets.vg247.com/current//2015/10/elite_fuel_rats.jpg)

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###1 – What exactly do the Fuel Rats do?

&gt; Awesome. We do awesome !

&gt; But seriously, The Fuel Rats Mischief is a ragtag bunch of commanders with three guiding principles :

&gt; * We have Fuel.
&gt; * You don't.
&gt; * Any Questions?

&gt; Meaning we bring Fuel to people who ask for it. If it sounds simple, it's because it is ! If you ever need fuel, hop on over at fuelrats.org and see for yourself.

&gt; I say that but every day we do the following : welcome distressed commanders, reassure them, locate them, keep them safe (by logging out to main menu where you can follow things through and save PRECIOUS oxygen), jump hundreds of light years in a matter of minutes, teach them how to friend someone, create a wing, enable a wing beacon, refuel them, teach them about the different types of landing pads (no, your Clipper won't dock at an outpost), teach them about fuel scoops and scoopable star types (KGB FOAM for everyone !), how to filter the Galmap and plot a route...

&gt; We also do training drills for our newest members to make sure they know which button to press at what moment, and train dispatchers to coordinate all that jazz.

&gt; We then keep a record of every rescue attempt made to tie-in to our next project, which we will talk about in due time.

&gt; Service Above and Beyond Expectations !

&gt; P.S. : It doesn't matter if you're Fed, Imp, Ally ; if you indulge in the plays of power, if you're a pirate, a trader, an explorer. We refuel any and every commander that comes to us.

&gt; P.P.S. : Due to the nature of our activity (Player with Player) we had some people say ""I play Solo it ain't fair !"" but... We've got a Private Group for that (cue in obscure forum reference where - was it Michael Brookes who said it ? - a Frontier guy said ""Solo is just a Private Group of one person"". So.. You know... If you ever run out of fuel in Solo (and don't want to come in open), you know who to call. We can be discreet. No one will know. Shhh, there there, it don't hurt.

&gt; P.P.P.S. : I feel I should mention we have Rats from all over the world. Australia, Finland, Sweden, Azerbaidjan, France, Germany, USA, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Cuba, UK... we've got the galaxy covered in all timezones !

&gt; P.P.P.P.S : Oh, and by the way, we do this free of charge.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###2 – What is your involvement in the Fuel Rats?

&gt; I bring Fuel to stranded pilots. Who knew ? Sorry...

&gt; So, everyone enlisted in the roster (accept no substitute !) is involved in the same manner : The Fuel Rats is an anarchic collective, meaning everyone's on the same level and free to act as he sees fit. Yet as each and every Rat represents the Mischief as a whole we make sure to be the best we can be at all times. Although people wanting to take some responsibilities can and will do so (and then be held accountable for everything that ensues).

&gt; For example, we have an IRC host and cleaner extraordinaire (Orange_Sheets), a Twitter Duo (Rusticolus &amp; Cowbelle), a Science Team (Domaq and others), some Techies (DukeOfEarl and more) and a Website administration team curating stories and pictures.

&gt; Now back to me. I volunteered to represent the Mischief in the Player Group Initiative Forums (soon joined by Cowbelle) and that's pretty much it. I recently finished recording ""A Brief History of Fuel and Rats"" which I'll publish soon™.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###3  - How did the Fuel Rats first get started?

&gt; That one is easy ! On December, shortly after the game came out, Commander Surly_Badger flew to Hutton Orbital. Or at least he tried. It did not end well. Contemplating the countdown to his demise, he wondered if there could be any way to transfer fuel from one ship to another.

&gt; Cue in 1.3 Beta and the ability to equip Fuel Transfer Controller. And here we are.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###4 – What are some of the Fuel Rats’ proudest achievements?

&gt; Oh boy, fasten your seatbelts.

&gt; * Furthest Active Rat : Arrakaij beyond the 65 Kylies line. He brought limpets all the way over there.
&gt; * Furthest recorded save : Paul Kavinsky &amp; Rusticolus at 31.5 Kylies Core-ward and 4.5 Kylies ""Up"". It took 48H.
&gt; * Furthest in-system rescue : 0.33 LY travelled in supercruise (can't find a name, tho)
&gt; * Longest recorded time exploring saved : Rusticolus helped a pilot who was out for 5 month.
&gt; * Longest trip worth of data saved : Rockslice saved a pilot that travelled 70 Kylies without trouble.
&gt; * Closest call : Kerenn, with 00:01 seconds of oxygen remaining.
&gt; * Fastest response time : Kerenn, with 03:33 between The Signal and the ""He's safe !""
&gt; * More than a few dozen Case Red rescued with under 00:05 seconds of oxygen left.
&gt; * Operation Neospike : 7 commanders (Domaq, Paul_Kavinsky, Rusticolus, Cpt_Shinobi, Surly_Badger, Anuranium and Muffindrake) work over three (3) days and use more than 540 limpets to help an explorer with a broken fuel scoop travel 3.6 Kylies.
&gt; * Then two other ""mini-neospike"" took place : Delvan, Watar, Veryinky going to help someone stranded near a Black Hole 741LY away from the bubble and 8.000Ls in system ; through the Aucocks Region.
&gt; * Domaq went on to rescue a pilot over 500LY away and escort him back with jumps only 5LY long. They covered &gt; * 150LY in one sitting until reaching a station with repair capacity.
&gt; * Most successful Rats : Ravenov &amp; Radlock (over 150 rescues to their name), Kitsune The Fluff, DarDevel, paul kavinsky (over 100 rescues each)
&gt; * Number of Rescues Operations : over 4000 with more than a 95% success rate.
&gt; * Number of Rats : 1000 with more than 400 active and a 100 ready at all times.
&gt; * Number of official cheerleaders : One (Ziggy Stardust)
&gt; * Most Visited systems : NLTT 48288 &amp; MCC 811
&gt; * Most illustrious place to refuel someone : Anuranium at Saggitarius A*
&gt; * Most language spoken in a Rescue : 4 (Kerenn speaking spanish to a brazilian guy who explained to his friend how the australian rat would be of help all the while finnish rat watched with bewilderment as things happened).

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###5 – How can people get involved with the Fuel Rats?

&gt; Simple ! There's a registration page on our [website](http://fuelrats.com/), or you can pop in IRC.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###6 – Why do you dedicate so much of your time to the Elite Dangerous community?

&gt; * We have fuel.
&gt; * You don't.
&gt; * I don't understand your question.

&gt; No but seriously, why not ? We do this because the community is worth doing it for. We also do what we do because we can. And because we like that warm, fuzzy feeling of saving someone. It's like smoking (which is bad for your health), you never forget your first limpet in (which is good).

&gt; We do it because it makes for AWESOME stories around the campfire, because we can see the sights, because we can honk through systems and make money that way, because of the adrenaline from the RAT RACE, because it gives us a place to belong to and mates to come back to, because it creates a link between people that would otherwise never know each other, because it breathes life into the big void between the stars, because... Damn, mate, there are so many reasons to dedicate our time to this community.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###7 – How long have you been playing Elite for?

&gt; Me myself and I pre-ordered the Mercenary Edition. I actually learned of it's existence back in Alpha and pondered wether to back it or not, but waited to make sure a release date was announced. Had I known then what I now know, I'd have backed it so hard your ship would take hull damage from it, like those lamp-posts around landing pad (what's up with those, anyway ?)

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###8 – What’s next for the Fuel Rats?

&gt; Someone asking for Fuel.

&gt; A fun project we never took the time to see through to the end is collating all our rescues data in a GalMap of ""Hot Spots"". We'd also like to have dates and a timed progression so it could flare up like a christmas tree. Frontier, please release a stand-alone Galmap.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###9 – Do you have anything else you’d like to tell the Elite community about?

&gt; The Hardest question! Er, let me see...

&gt; The Fuel Rats: If we can save you, we probably will*

&gt; I didn't ""ram"" him, I ""nudged"" his thrusters to jump-start them.

&gt; Don't forget your Fuel Scoop. No Fuel Scoop? No Problem. This is fine.

&gt; Truth is we have too many slogans. So I'll just end this with a big Shout-Out to the Explorer's Forum, lots of cool people there, mature and all, wicked sense of humor, tight-knit community inside the community.

&gt; To the Mischief, I love you all. Of course I do. You know I do.

&gt; Also Thanks to Zac, Ed, Brett and the forum moderators for what you do.

&gt; Thanks to Frontier and everyone involved: The Artists, the Interns, the cleaning guys, the administrative personnel...

###[PLEASE VIEW THE ARTICLE ANYWAY](http://www.idigitaltimes.com/elite-dangerous-horizons-lead-designer-reveals-new-information-about-srvs-multi-crew-489867) TO GIVE TRAFFIC AND SHOW SCOTT &amp; IDT YOUR APPRECIATION FOR THE ELITE DANGEROUS COVERAGE :)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###Elite Dangerous: Horizons Lead Designer Reveals New Information About SRVs, Multi-Crew Combat And More

&gt; It's been a big year for Elite: Dangerous, the galaxy-spanning space sim from Frontier Developments, and the rapidly-approaching debut of [Elite Dangerous: Horizons](http://www.idigitaltimes.com/stream/elite-dangerous-horizons) -- the first ""season"" of premium content for Elite: Dangerous -- has us pretty confident the game's momentum will extend into 2016.

&gt; Back in September, [we gave you a heads-up](http://www.idigitaltimes.com/elite-dangerous-horizons-might-finally-fill-those-empty-seats-your-ship-473930) about Elite: Dangerous' upcoming crew system, two weeks before Frontier Developments [confirmed Multi-Crew](http://www.idigitaltimes.com/elite-dangerous-horizons-getting-multi-crew-ship-launched-fighters-and-pilot-478235) was on Elite: Dangerous Horizons' developmental roadmap. But we couldn't stop there. Now, Elite: Dangerous and Elite Dangerous: Horizons lead designer Sandro Sammarco is sharing some new details on the surface recon vehicles (SRVs) being introduced in Planetary Landings and some of the studio's other plans for Elite Dangerous: Horizons.

&gt; To give a bit of context, these questions were submitted to Frontier Developments shortly before the studio's CEO, David Braben, announced plans to launch the Elite Dangerous: Horizons beta later this month. This is why we didn't dive into specifics about the upcoming testing period. But we did manage to get some new information on how SRVs will fit into the existing [Elite: Dangerous](http://www.idigitaltimes.com/stream/elite-dangerous) gameplay loop and the ways Elite Dangerous: Horizons will change the game for those uninterested in driving across the surface of the airless worlds coming in Planetary Landings. Sadly, our (admittedly weak) attempt at coaxing a release date out of Frontier Developments was not successful.

&gt; But enough chatter. Let's get to the interview!

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **IDT:** *What happens if you die in an SRV? Are you returned to your ship or do you respawn on the planet you were exploring?*

&gt; **SAMMARCO:** If your SRV is destroyed whilst you are in it, you will be transported back to your ship, now minus that particular SRV. You’ll need to use a different SRV or purchase a replacement before you can deploy planet-side again, but SRVs are cheap in comparison to ships so replacements should be easy. In addition to losing the SRV, you will be processed for any outstanding fines or bounties for the jurisdiction your ship is in when you are returned to it.

&gt; **IDT:** *Will the SRV have costs/expenses separate from players' ships? Will players need to set aside re-buy money, similar to the rainy day fund most players keep to replace their ships and cargo?*

&gt; **SAMMARCO:** The main goal for SRVs is that they’re fun and disposable. While there are costs involved in setting up a ship to carry SRVs, the vehicles themselves will not be particularly expensive – we want to encourage players to use them and throw them around the worlds without too much regard for their safety, not keep them garaged in fear of being bankrupted. If anything they are more akin to mildly costly munitions than very expensive ships. You won’t need a rainy-day fund, just a handful of credits to pick up a new SRV.

&gt; **IDT:** *Are players' ships still vulnerable to attack while the pilot is driving an SRV?*

&gt; **SAMMARCO:** A ship landed on the planet surface is vulnerable, even if you are outside driving an SRV. It’s an important thing to consider and a key gameplay concern. We’ve made it so you can dispatch your ship into orbit, however, where it will be safe from harm until your recall it. You won’t be able to make such a quick escape, but you won’t have to worry about your ship when it’s miles in the distance.

&gt; **IDT:** *Will players ever have a way to transport docked ships from one facility to another?*

&gt; **SAMMARCO:** Hopefully, yes! This is currently in the list of smaller features planned for delivery at some point during Elite Dangerous: Horizons. Horizons is a whole season of expansions so there will be opportunities for us to add lots of fan-requested features along the way. However, we don’t want to undermine the vastness of space: you will be able to pay to have ships delivered to your current location, but you won’t be able to “fast travel” to ships berthed at other locations. Those distances have to mean something.

&gt; **IDT:** *Will any ships be large enough to hold multiple fighters? If not, will other human members of the crew still have vital roles in combat situations?*

&gt; **SAMMARCO:** Some of the larger ships should have the capacity to carry multiple vehicles! That being said, the idea for multicrew is to make sure all crew members on board a ship can contribute significantly to its combat effectiveness.

&gt; **IDT:** *Will players be able to leave a sign of their presence (like a flag or plaque) on explored planets?*

&gt; **SAMMARCO:** Not initially, though I wouldn’t want to rule out something like this at some point during the Horizons season. It’s certainly a fun feature, and an exciting thing for other players to find on a vast world.

&gt; **IDT:** *Most of the pre-launch Elite Dangerous: Horizons coverage has focused on SRV gameplay. What sorts of changes will Elite Dangerous: Horizons have for those who prefer to stay in their ships?*

&gt; **SAMMARCO:** To use just a couple of examples: there are new resources for players to collect, called materials, that will allow them to do neat things like resupply weapons without having to dock, increase their frame shift drive jump range and more. And of course, for pilots brave enough, you can fly close to the ground and engage targets directly in your ship. That’s something you’ll often want to do if you’re working with a Wing – providing air support to friends working on the ground will give them an advantage.

&gt; **IDT:** *Has the team narrowed down a launch window for Planetary Landings yet?*

&gt; **SAMMARCO:** Yes! We’ll have an announcement soon!

5688,"&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; You might remember a month ago we mentioned we would be launching a new competitive community CQC tournament, and I just wanted to confirm some of the details of how the event will work. There’s a lot of information in this post, but we think it’s really important to be as clear as possible. There will also be an updated FAQ on the post below, so feel free to ask your questions and we’ll be sure to check in and answer them as often as we can.

&gt; The tournament will be broken down into three phases:

&gt; ###Phase 1: Preparation &amp; Celebration

&gt; Phase one starts now. Players need to be sharpening their skills and unlocking the upgrades they want to use on their accounts. You will be using your own accounts for the qualifying periods, so getting the unlocks you want for then is going to need to happen now. In addition, to help you out we’ll be running a series of community events to get you ready for the tournament. 

&gt; We’ll have pro tips from the best players in the community and Frontier, an opening ceremony held during our 24-hour Charity Christmas Livestreams as well as some practice sessions and events to get involved in! 

&gt; During this time we’ll be running a competition to find some community shout casters for the live final so keep your eyes open for more news!

&gt; ###Phase 2: The qualifying heats

&gt; The qualifying heats will start early next year. We’re still working on the final dates but we’ll make sure to let you know with plenty of time to spare.

&gt; Each month there will be a separate qualifying heat. You will have three weeks of practice matches and one qualifying period of a week. There will be four heats over four months. 

&gt; The tournament will be run in Deathmatch mode. We might run future tournaments in team-based matches too, but that’s not for now. 

&gt; The top four PC/Mac players and the top four Xbox One players over that week (16 PC/Mac and 16 Xbox One players by the end of the qualifiers) will win the following prize:

&gt; * A seat at the live final and a chance to be an overall winner

&gt; * Travel to and from the event 

&gt; * Accommodation during your stay

&gt; * Food and drink at the event

&gt; * A winner’s goody bag

&gt; ###How do I qualify?

&gt; Players will be ranked and given a tournament score for that week. The score will be generated using a complex system which uses a number of factors, such as XP gained over the period, battle rating and other stats. These are designed to lean heavily towards skill, but there is also a requirement for you to play regularly through the week in order to have the best chance at qualifying. 

&gt; We will be keeping the maths behind the scoring a secret to avoid players trying to engineer or game the system. We will be running practice qualifiers during the off weeks in order for players to get used to their scoring and get their eye in. 

&gt; Each winner will go through a rigorous anti-cheating and fair play check. It will include fair play best practice such as ensuring that players complete a high percentage of their games, as well as deeper anti-cheating checks which we won’t talk about. Players that we find to have cheated in the past in any way will not be eligible for a seat as part of our fair play policy. 

&gt; There will be a reserve list created for those close to qualifying. If someone is unable to attend or drops out with enough notice, we will use this reserve list to find a replacement (if possible). 

&gt; ###Phase 3: The live final

&gt; Once the qualifiers are finished we’ll be holding a live final. The full 16 PC/Mac and 16 Xbox One players will then attend the live final.

&gt; On the night there will be a host of activities streamed live for everyone to watch and get involved in. These will include things like live exhibition matches against some of the best Frontier staff, pre and post-game interviews and of course the tournament finals themselves. 

&gt; There will be two separate tournaments and the $15,000 USD prize pot will be split between both tournaments. This means both finals will have a prize pot of $7,500 USD. To be able to play in both tournaments you will need to qualify in the top 16 of both the PC/Mac and the Xbox One qualifiers. 

&gt; All the equipment for the games in the live final will be supplied. You will not be able to bring your own equipment. The Xbox One tournament will be held on Xbox One consoles with gamepad. The PC set up will be with a choice of HOTAS Joystick and throttle (using Saitek X52s), mouse and Keyboard, and Xbox gamepad. You will be using a fully unlocked account in the final which has been specifically set up for you. You will not be using your own personal account. 

&gt; Both the PC and Xbox One tournaments will have 2 live semi-finals where the top 4 from each semi will progress into one final. 

&gt; There will be a live crowd at the event and more news on how to get hold of your tickets, dates and location will be available closer to the time. 

&gt; ###Supporters and partners

&gt; We’re delighted to say that during the tournament we will be supporting SpecialEffect. This charity do fantastic work, helping those with disabilities to enjoy video games. It’s a charity that is well-loved within our community and is always present at Elite Dangerous community events. 

&gt; We will also be looking to work with other partners through the event that would be keen on adding more to the tournament experience. This could take the form of prizing, promotions or any other forms of support which make the event even better! Again, we’ll have much more on this as soon as possible.

&gt; ###FAQ

&gt; Post your questions below **(or in the forum thread)** and we’ll keep an updated FAQ of all the answers. We will also be updating this with full terms and conditions prior to the event going live.

The OP is correct.  Horizons pre-order only allows new CMDRs to play once Horizons is released. Edit: never mind, you've edited your comment to agree with the OP :)

The flowchart you linked even states that:

5690,"&gt; All they had to do is turn SCB's into a single module that replenished a moderate amount of shield and follow a LENGTHY cooldown.

5691,"&gt; Sorry, no. Wrong on so many points.

Two points perhaps?

&gt; Multiple SCB's are now useless. Large ships can no longer stack them for useful recharge amounts. And no heat sinks aren't the answer at 4 ammo per unit and/or giving up slots that used to be boosters.

Heatsink(s) and/or booster(s), make your choice.  Smaller ships have fewer btw...

&gt; Hull reinforcement is a joke. What good does this do when opponents can simply take out your drives?

While they are attacking and taking out your drives, what are you doing, sitting there like a lemon?

* Do large ships still pack the biggest guns, power plants, and shields?  Yes
* Will large ships be *different* at 1v1 combat vs smaller ships? Yes

5695,"Space2504's OP:

&gt; A couple of days ago a Player Minor Faction was added to the Li Yong Rui HQ, it was automatically given control of the system, with an influence of 1%. This is now 20%, I would assume mostly based on trade and exploration data being handed in by LYR faction players.

&gt; Should this be allowed, it seems to give a massive advantage to the player faction, they effectively have the whole power working for them. The PMF in question are made up of players that do not take part in PP and play exclusively in solo. 

&gt; The faction was not aligned to the PP faction in terms of government, this has an affect on PP CC. What's to stop this being weaponised in the future, such that PMF's could be created in control systems/HQ deliberately to create issues for the PP faction.

&gt; As was mentioned in a recent interview with FDEV, in the future PMF's will be able to eventually become PP factions. Therefore should they be allowed the unfair advantage of being created in an existing PP HQ.

&gt; Just as a side note, this has really upset a very large number of the LYR PP players. Another straw added to their backs, along with the broken BGS. With the traffic at the PP HQ's it will make it very difficult for the PP players to effectively remove the PMF.

&gt; What do you think, should FDEV allow Player Minor Factions in PP HQs?

There is already a delay after activating a shield cell bank, roughly 5 seconds, so will this then be longer? Or, does the delay happen when the shield cell bank is turned on via the modules tab, so we need to wait before it can be activated?*

And are you going to nerf the AI then so NPCs don't cheat, don't have magic powers of invisibilty, immunity to masslock, ability to hide their true wing numbers? in short why don't you actually FIX stuff before pushing these nerfs on folks.*

Careful application of cells still offer tremendous benefits, and with heat management (from heat sink launchers for example) they are formidable. But spamming cells of a decent quality for the ship you're in will have the potential to cause more harm than good. This, coupled with a delay in booting up shield cell bank modules, diminishes (without removing completely) the benefits of having lots and lots of shield cells. And of course, hull reinforcement modules will grant *moar* hull; our intention is to bring these two forms of defensive internal modules slightly closer together. [Replying to NeilF's multiple comments also] I would argue that the goal here is not to make every combat fair - that simply makes no sense with the range of ship capabilities that may or may not be present. The goal is to mitigate against a path of least resistance (the argument being that everyone should just load up with as many shield cell banks as possible) during outfitting.

Looking at shield recharge times: this is something we will be looking at in conjunction with loot. The penalty for using a single shield cell is not going to blow your ship up (unless you were like at 1% hull and a million degrees temperature), but chaining use of cells should become a danger factor (initially to your modules). The delay for powering a shield cell bank module (note, there is *no* change to the activation cost of a shield cell) is significant, but should not be *completely* prohibitive (well, we'll see, and tweak as required!) Did I say *moar* hull from hull reinforcement packages? I really, really meant it...

&gt; **Michael:** You just need to adapt your tactics - the hull reinforcement is more valuable or use heat sinks to offset the heat damage. The change just means you can't spam using the SCBs without some preparation.

The delay between SCB switching will kill off large ships in intensive wing combat. Hull reinforcement doesn't help if the opposing player targets modules. What tactics can large ships use exactly to compensate for this nerf?*

&gt; **Michael:** You will need to assign more power to the SCB if you want to use more than one of them and manage the heat - I'd also question if the big non-combat ships are the best ships for large scale combat.

If so, how are large ships justified on the battlefield with said changes?""*

&gt; **Michael:** You're assuming that they should be. Big ships have their place, but make big targets so in a large dogfight I would expect them to be vulnerable unless well protected by smaller and more maneuverable escorts.

The tanking ability is technically gone, are we suppose to consider large ships to be DPS from now on, instead?*

&gt; **Michael:** You can tank the large ships quite effectively with the upgraded hull reinforcement packages and with proper heat and power management you can still use your SCBs - you just can't spam them like you used to and I repeat that bringing a big, slow ship to a dog fight might not be the best move anyway and if you do, then you have to prepare accordingly.

&gt; **Michael:** You mean like a battleship can be destroyed by a much smaller ship? The large ships have inherent from their size and how they're loaded out, but the SCBs were far too strong for them, but with the large ships you can still use multiples of them, you just have to prepare properly, so assign more power to them and have heat sinks at the ready. Use armour and hull reinforcements to tank them. A bigger doesn't always mean better.

As it stands, thrusters and FSD on large ships are very vulnerable even with hull reinforcement packages, is there anything that will be done to strengthen said modules?*

&gt; **Michael:** Not yet, but that is one of the weaknesses with those ships. With the loot system building stronger modules should be possible, but it will come at a cost somewhere else. You need to use the right tool for the job - you wouldn't use a Spectre gunship in an air superiority battle despite its amazing firepower.

&gt; **[Sandro (to everyone):](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3088696&amp;viewfull=1#post3088696)** As with all changes, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, so we look forward to everyone's feedback once the changes go to live test. A few points though: the heat generated from using shield cells is based on the rating of the cell bank. Using lower rated cells will give you less heat at the cost of less shield regeneration. And of course, heat sinks are effective at cooling your ship down. Using a cell every now and again isn't going to do much more than a little bit of module damage from heat, which in general is far better than taking hull damage (and it also plays into module malfunction more). It's also still possible to fit multiple shield cell banks and use them - you will need to manage power more carefully as there's a **twenty or so second delay before a shield cell bank boots up after being powered**. What these changes are for is to see if we can't decrease the effectiveness of shield cells, and especially chaining them, whilst increasing a potential alternative - hull reinforcement

&gt; **Sandro (cont.):** Now there's an interesting argument/fear about relying on hull rather than shields, which is sub-system sniping. A little while back, we decreased the size of pretty much all sub-system targets significantly and we stopped the power plant destruction from being an instant kill. Gimbal and turret weapons suffer from inherent confusion, limiting their ability to hit small targets and we reduced the range of most weapon's penetration. Even still, sub-system targeting needs to be useful, otherwise why have it? So will sub-system sniping become the new path of least resistance if shields break more often? That's something I'd like feedback about from these changes. If it turns out to be the case, we have multiple options to address it: we can increase module health, increase damage reduction for fitting hull reinforcement packages and of course scale back the penalties for shield cells, as well as offer protection from modules with the loot system. So the point here, as is always the case when we make design tweaks, to try out stuff in anger and get feedback from it that will ultimately help us improve the game.",2015-11-13 11:49:26+00:00,cwyshth,1.0,t3_3sniat,22.0,EliteDangerous

5781,"&gt; The Hutton Orbital Truckers are one of the most dedicated community groups out there. One of their representatives, and founding members, CMDR Vingtetun, told us all about what makes 'HOT' so special.

&gt; [Hutton Orbital Truckers](http://i.imgur.com/LUgcReP.jpg)

&gt; ###So when did the Hutton Truckers first start up?

&gt; Hutton Orbital Truckers were set up after the Hutton Mug CG as an antidote to the ""v"" in the PvP and PvE acronyms.  Our ambition at the outset was to create an environment for people to enjoy PwP gameplay - literally ""player with player"".

&gt; So many games these days are about who it is against - rather than who you are playing with.  Elite: Dangerous gives us a great opportunity to craft a co-operative environment for fun gaming.

&gt; In terms of ""who"" we are - the team behind our events - yes, they DO take a lot of planning:

&gt; * David Pearson (Vingtetun)
&gt; * Psykokow
&gt; * Simon Woolcott
&gt; * Snos &amp; Alvin (Alvin is our leader)
&gt; * Russell Pitcher
&gt; * Andrew Craib
&gt; * Eric Marcaigh

&gt; [Members of the Hutton team joined us to present a Hutton Mug trophy and meet some of the Frontier team](http://i.imgur.com/RQINLAm.jpg)

&gt; Plus a cast of extras and helpers including Alien (who does our paperwork), Teldja (who organises combat support) and a whole voice recording crew.

&gt; In terms of ""who"" the group are - a bunch of people who are happy to fly the 1.5 hours to Hutton with a cargo hold of scrap.  Or take a tonne of mugs to Sag A* and photograph themselves dropping it in.  Or help with someone else's CG ""just because we can"".

&gt; ###What we do?

&gt; Originally, we had a beer or two and by accident came up with the idea for the Hutton Mug.  Then the voting went live for a new rare item and we submitted it - and won.  After that, we set up the website, the Facebook group, the 24 hour a day radio station, recorded over 60 parody adverts and songs and were ""persuaded"" by the 3200+ people who took part in the community goal to do more.

&gt; Since then, we have crafted in game events for players regardless of whether they like combat, trading, exploration, playing solo, in open or in private groups.  Effectively, we are a hub for other groups to organise fun in game.

&gt; We had nearly 200 real Hutton Mugs made up as prizes, a stack of stickers, some team t-shirts, flight suit patches and even a spectacular trophy donated to Frontier last week.  Many of the Truckers donate prizes and their generosity to the community is staggering.

&gt; The whole thing is tinted with the humour from the original 1984 Elite.  We may not have blue slimy frogs, or fat black felines, but there is space in the year 3300 for humour and parody, and there's no reason to suggest that people in the far future wouldn't be as ridiculous as those we have around now.

&gt; ###Why do we do it?

&gt; For fun and because we can.  The buzz of running a 300 ship convoy... the endless stream of photographs and messages from people who have never been to Sag A*, played in a wing, used limpets to load up a type-9 with rares and the myriad other in game activities and whose eyes have been opened to ""having a laugh"" with other gamers.

&gt; ###What are our thoughts on the ED Community?

&gt; Assuming you mean the wider community rather than the EDC themselves (who are a cracking player group of over 6000 players), it's wonderful to see people who aren't just ""playstation generation"" gamers, but 1st generation gamers - from our oldest trucker well into their 60's flying with their children and grandchildren, through to those of us in our late 30's and early 40's, and now being joined by the younger player.

&gt; The vast majority of those we talk to and play with on a daily basis are wonderful, fun people.  The game, and our activities, takes effort - that means that the players we work with are passionate, dedicated and prepared to put effort in where it is needed.  I'm always impressed by the number of genuinely articulate and fiercely intelligent players of the game - it seems to attract a large number of very creative people.

&gt; The community won't let Frontier trip up - if something is bad, they will say so, and often with really well given reasons. Similarly, they're hungry for more.... as Frontier adds ""furniture"" to this room that they've built, the players really want an input into how comfy it is, what it looks like and what it will be used for.

&gt; ###The Acronym 'HOT'

&gt; Well - Russell and Andrew form HOPIT (the Hutton Orbital Political Information Team), we recently did the Galactic Intrepid Mug Proliferation Project... We drew the line at the acronym for Hutton Orbital Radio as admitting to our wives that we were spending our evenings with a .... well, you can fill in the blank.  So - draw your own conclusions about the names!

&gt; ###In terms of how we act around one another?

&gt; We often catch up in person for a drink or two, despite distances involved.  My work takes me throughout the world and I use that to try and catch up with fellow gamers.  We recently met CMDR Elenar at a pub in St Albans... he does look just like his portrait.  We all form part of the back-room team from events like Lavecon, Fantasticon and EliteMeet and yes, once the doors shut, it does all get a little silly.  

&gt; ###As for what I do?

&gt; As the other guys say - ""It's all David's fault"".  A recent post on the facebook group summed it up:

&gt; ""There's this squid guy and his crew. The squid guy, that's David.  He has spent his life ferrying sailors' souls to the afterlife. He gives us stuff to do.  We, his crew, are dedicated to the transport of the mug to the furthest reaches of the galaxy.... FOR ALL ETERNITY.""

&gt; I come up with the ideas, write scripts, run the Facebook side of things and broadcast with Psykokow on the radio (and am a beacon of sheer enthusiasm).  Everyone else does the hard work.

&gt; ###Activities?  It's a big list

&gt; * We trucked scrap to Hutton for a week as part of a CG with 3200 others
&gt; * We organised a fight against the CODE in beta with hundreds of vipers and cobras locked in combat
&gt; * We had a mammoth CQC session broadcast live to celebrate the launch of that update
&gt; * We had a convoy of 300 ships travel 21 jumps with mugs on board, using a 2 minute ""Battlestar Galactica"" style timer - all under fire from pirates and with the aid of groups like the Fuel Rats
&gt; * We started a mission to take mugs to every powerplay HQ, then on to a couple of special destinations and then via a particular nebula and on to Saggitarius A*
&gt; * We're taking Ed Lewis on as an Intern for his own convoy of hundreds of ships, bringing glue to Mapor to stick all the smashed mugs back together again.
&gt; * We helped at the Nebula CG, with many of our Truckers in the top 5% (and the Sothis gold one)
&gt; * We run Thursday training sessions for anyone wanting to know how to survive a pirate attack
&gt; * On top of that, we're taking over Alpha Centauri

&gt; ###As for what's on the Horizon?

&gt; The G.I.M.P.P. challenge is ongoing until January (for anyone wanting to earn a flight suit patch), we are in planning for a special Christmas event with Frontier and work has started on the Horizons Grand Prix series starting early next year - racing for the Hutton Cup (Bit like a mug, but shinier).

&gt; ###Where can you join?

&gt; We have a Facebook group - the Hutton Orbital Radio Truckers.  There are regular forum posts.  We have a private group - ""Hutton Truckers"" or just e-mail itookpart@huttonorbital.com to bother Snos and Alvin.  Hashtag #forthemug on twitter with any trucking tales.

&gt; Many of the people who join us are in ""formal"" in game groups and they join in as and when something suits them.  From the EDC, to the Fuel Rats, Dark Echo, Canonn Interstellar Research, the FGE and even a pirate or two, as long as you have a sense of humour and enjoy having a laugh, feel free to join in.

&gt; We can be found most evenings on the Lave Radio (our sister station) teamspeak server (laveradio.teamspeak3.com)

So I grew a bit disgruntled and found other games to play for abit.

Understandable and very unlucky to be honest: ED has been on sale multiple times during this past year, and was $30 a couple of months back.

The good news is that Horizons will be on sale at similar times during next year (Easter, Summer, Autumn, Christmas), so you can enjoy playing the core game until Horizons is priced to suit you.

&gt; ###Steam Controller for Elite Dangerous Review

&gt; First of all, this is just a post reviewing the steam controller, not if the steam controller is better than any other input method, I like controllers, if you don't, that's cool, Joysticks are great as well, to each their own. Also, if you're not familiar with using a controller for E D, this post may be confusing. 

&gt; So I just received my Steam controller, and after a couple of hours fumbling around I have come to the conclusion that it is a piece of...Incredible Hardware! and yes, for Elite: Dangerous as well, it functions AMAZINGLY!

&gt; My first impressions, I must say, were awkward and confusing, the default setup for the controller is clunky and uncomfortable, and doesn't make use of the controller as it should.

&gt; In the default setup the D-pad is used as, well, a D-pad, and the left joystick as the left joystick,(Notice on the steam controller these are swapped from the standard x-box setup, that's what makes it uncomfortable for me). The right touchpad acts as the right Joystick, but is also swapped from the x-box controller with the usual ABXY button placement, a little strange to get used to, but I like it better already. This setup does work using the advanced controller setting, and maybe isn't even all that bad a of setup if you get use to it, but my real revelation and love for this controller came when I realized that I could use the big D-pad as the left joystick (because it's actually another touchpad!) and the left joystick as the D-pad.

&gt; All of the sudden this worked so much better and actually feels really cool, and kind of futuristic. I now steer my ship with two touchpads, left for roll and pitch, right for yaw and vertical, click left touchpad for boost. The left joystick as the power distributor works like a charm, no click necessary, just push in the desired direction.

&gt; All the button combos in the advanced controller setup, for example, ""B+D-pad down"" to activate FSD also work using the left joystick as the D-pad, so that ""B+Joystick Down"" will activate FSD, ""X+Joystick Down"" for landing gear etc.

&gt; It was incredibly easy to do, and works instantly with the “advanced controller” preset in E D. My binding is called “Badben's Elite: Dangerous Binding” if you want to try it out. 

&gt; All in all, I think this is my favorite controller ever, and it's all because of the amazing customizability built in. It was so easy to make the controller work the way I wanted it to. If you are a controller fan, I definitely recommend this controller for Elite: Dangerous.",2015-11-08 19:42:54+00:00,cwt5n2s,1.0,t3_3s1efa,504.0,EliteDangerous

5815,"&gt; Elite is now 'multiplayer'. It's hardly ground-breaking though.

It's by no means finished yet... :)",2015-11-08 11:37:19+00:00,cwss1ao,5.0,t1_cwsk0b2,26149.0,EliteDangerous
5816,"&gt; I don't want to come across as condescending, but most of that list is nothing more than bug fixes.

Not condescending, but definitely incorrect - I should know as I created that wiki page ;)

I carefully listed all content/features that were added or improved upon, and *not* include many bug fixes.  Re-read through it and you'll see.

&gt; Other than that we have Wings, Community Goals and PowerPlay

I again suggest re-reading the version history wikia, especially the summary notes for 1.3 &amp; 1.4 (and their patches), to see how many different features have been added.

&gt; oh and a couple of ships

In total, 9 ships have been added since launch: 4 new ""hulls"", 4 variants of existing hulls, 1 CQC only hull.  Another 2 hulls (Corvette and Cutter) and 6 variants will be added with 1.5. 

&gt; speaking of which, how many times can you rehash/refit an existing ship and call it new?

I'd say once or twice, depending on the base hull.  Note that every MMORPG (and open world game) uses this exact strategy for their mob asset creation, except each mob is rehash/refit **dozens** of times:

* copy &amp; paste model making minor alterations (if necessary!)
* create a new skin
* perhaps assign a new in-game ability
* call it something new
* repeat

&gt; Let's face it - if you didn't have those 'new' features, you might as well be playing this with updated graphics, because nothing much has changed.

Isn't that the same with every game sequel?  Improve graphics; add a couple/few new features; improve existing features slightly; create new story, assets and art; release.

For Elite Dangerous, FDev not only had to create their engine's content codebase from scratch (FE2 &amp; FFE used a different custom engine) so add in *all* the features the game requires, but also add in massive-multiplayer - something that's **never been done** with a procedurally generated game of this scope, detail and graphical fidelity.

&gt; I hate to do this because I've posted about it already - but look at the 'content' that was released for free before GW2 charged for an expansion 3 years after release: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release

GW2 is a great example of how quickly content can be pushed out when you already have a feature-complete game engine &amp; codebase: in Arenanet's case it's one heavily modified from their [GW1 version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars_2#Gameplay). While the graphics are certainly superior to the original, asset and art creation is very quick due to the relative simplicity compared to games like ED (and Star Citizen, X Rebirth, Eve, etc) and the fidelity such games require.

Bethesda's games (as a similar example) suffer from the constraints of modern game-creation complexity too; it takes 5+ years to create the content, art and assets for an Elder Scrolls or Fallout game, using the gradually improved GameBryo (now called Creation) engine.  Gamers are already complaining that not enough has improved or been added to FO4 compared to FO3/FNV, yet it's only been released to the press, the public hasn't even played it yet.

Elite Dangerous was certainly released early - I classed it as being ""release ready"" after 1.2 Wings was added - and the engine's codebase is yet to be fully fleshed out as per what was described in the DDA, although we'll see most of it added over time.",2015-11-08 11:29:07+00:00,cwsrxi8,3.0,t1_cwsj4z2,27276.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; Hey guys, 

&gt; There is a server update which has gone live today. There is no downtime and this will take effect over the next 12 hours. 

&gt; Patch notes are... 

&gt; * Applying daily limits to minor faction influence changes, these limits are based upon the star system as well as the amount of player activity to limit the large swings we've seen in recent weeks.
&gt; * Influence levels reset back to their starting values for the minor factions owned by Player Groups who have been affected by these large swings
&gt; * Fix minor faction conflicts so that stations and systems can once again change who controls them

&gt; For minor factions who have missed out on a chance to take control of a star system or station by winning one of the conflicts that ended between 6th October and 2nd November, there's still the opportunity to take control of a star system by having more than 60% influence and not controlling the station that controls that system.

&gt; ###[Adam Woods, Producer](http://i.imgur.com/PvBLlag.jpg)

&gt; ###What does an average day at work look like for you?

&gt; It starts with a coffee. Freshly ground, black, with no sugar. 

&gt; I then head to my PC, and have a quick skim through my emails, flagging any that require my direct attention. Then it’s in to the various morning meetings we have. These are quick 10-15minutes stand-ups to get a quick overview from the leads and heads of departments, and allow us as a production team to distribute any important information or updates. 

&gt; Once back at my desk, I make a plan of action for the day as well as updating my build to get the latest version of the game. Depending on what phase of development we are in, the bulk of my day differs. High level there are 3 different phases:

&gt; 1. Plan it!
&gt; 2. Do it!
&gt; 3. Ship it!

&gt; **Plan it!** This phase requires my time to be spent talking with the teams to get the features/content that I will be looking after understood and the work broken down. Then I have to do a lot of electronic paperwork and get Jira (the task and bug tracking software we use) setup ready for the team to use. Elite is ever growing and developing, so we also have to look ahead into the future a lot, planning for what’s coming up next, to ensure that the team can move onto the next feature/update when ready.

&gt; **Do it!** The team will now understand 99% of the work expected from them to hit the goals for release (no-one can ever know 100% in game development, trust me...) so this phase sees me ensuring that the they have the right tools, software, design specs, and support from other teams to get their work done as smoothly as possible. During this phase I also constantly review the build and features along with the leads, heads of departments, and executives to capture feedback/requests that needs to be folded back into the game. I work with the teams to balance the pre-planned work with the feedback and requests that come up during development, which can be tricky at times.

&gt; **Ship it!** We are content and feature complete, and we are now exterminating those pesky bugs! During this phase I run around the studio...a lot. It’s similar to the previous phase, but here I concentrate on liaising with our beautiful QA department, and get the team working on the highest priority bugs. It’s a very exciting phase, seeing the various features polished and optimised, and the hype that starts to build as we release sneak peeks.

&gt; Of course, that’s the way I see it in my head, in an ideal world. It’s much more like a mixture of all 3 phases, with a huge side helping of laughs, songs, tears, sweat, blood, pizza, doughnuts and some of the largest, most complex excel sheets I have ever seen.  

&gt; ###What aspect of the game have you worked on that you are most proud of?

&gt; As a producer, I rarely work on anything that goes into the game directly (I have been known to check some things in, to the horror of the programmers. I’ve never broken the build though...yet). My role is more about helping steer the feature as a whole. 

&gt; I think the 1.2 ‘Wings’ update is probably the feature I am most proud to have been part of; it really opened up a whole new way to take on the universe. I remember shortly after we released it, I was docked in my trusty Eagle, looking for mission (I had my eye on an ASP, and needed credits). I took on an assassination job. The target turned out to be a wanted, Elite ranked Anaconda. I thought I could pull a ‘David Vs Goliath’ move. I couldn’t, and barely made it out of the skirmish alive. I headed back to the nearest Starport, docked, and paid for repairs. Dejected, and ready to head back ‘home’ (Sol), I was going through the launch procedure, when I noticed another human player leaving the ‘Port. I opened up comms with him, and asked if he wanted to help me hunt down the Anaconda I had just escaped from. We winged up and headed out to find my target once again. 

&gt; And we kicked his butt.

&gt; And thanks to the Wing feature, he could share in the bounty that was on the Anaconda. To this day, it’s one of the greatest moments in any game I have played.

&gt; ###What's your favourite thing about Elite Dangerous?

&gt; 2 things:

&gt; * First it’s the fact that, even after almost 2 years on the project, I still see brand new things every day. And even that’s before I start looking around “Horizons”. Most of my ‘Geeeez, I have never seen that before!’ jaw dropping moments come from checking out the vast amount of content that the players of Elite create every day. Which leads me onto my second favourite thing...
&gt; * The Elite community. You guys and gals are incredible, and it’s humbling to hear and see your responses to Elite.

&gt; ###What was the biggest challenge you came up against during game development?

&gt; Trying to keep on top of all the things going on! It’s hard enough in ‘normal’ game development (if there is such a thing?!) let alone when the play space is  a 1:1 scale Milky way, and you need to fill it with the necessary tools and gameplay to create a compelling place for players to ‘live’ and create their own stories as well as being able to follow the over arching story provided by factions, community goals, and Power Play.

&gt; Watching and reading the players reactions on the numerous videos, fan made comics, forum threads and player group sites, I think it’s safe to say that the team have done a great job so far.

&gt; ###What have you learned from working on Elite Dangerous?

&gt; Space is big.

&gt; No really, it’s huge.

&gt; And it’s a beautiful, dangerous and daunting place to be. It’s a combination of these and many other emotions that set it aside from other gaming experiences. 

&gt; ###Federation, Empire, or Alliance? And why?

&gt; Federation. All bow to the might of Zachary Hudson.

&gt; ###Tell the community a fun fact about yourself.

&gt; I have a phobia of the “Waltzer” fairground ride. 

&gt; ###If you could ask the community one question, what would it be?

&gt; You’ve just finished a delicious Sunday roast. Dessert is next. You have 3 options:

&gt; 1. Cold custard, warm pie
&gt; 2. Warm custard, cold pie
&gt; 3. Warm custard, warm pie

&gt; Obsidian Ant (/u/GrannyEye) has been making Elite Dangerous videos since the early days of beta, and now has more than 1.6 million views on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ObsidianAnt/videos). In this interview, the Ant (we're on informal terms) tells us about his creative process, and what it takes to get a station built in a nebula.

&gt; ###How long does it take to make each video?

&gt; This can vary dramatically from video to video.  Some videos take as little as 30 to 45 minutes to make, where as others can take 6+ hours. The average is around 2 hours or so. Generally though, it's the recording of the footage which can be pretty time consuming, especially for the ""Exploring Elite: Dangerous"" videos. These videos essentially chart my journey across the galaxy, and there are vast distances to cover.

&gt; I try to include as many interesting systems, planets and nebula etc. as I possibly can, and that takes time. Ultimately for ""Exploring Elite: Dangerous"" I may distill a few days play time down into a ten minute video. In contrast to that, videos like the ""Path to Pleiades"" which are about the nebula station CG, only need around 60 to 90 minutes of playing. Editing also varies in time, especially if I have a particularly difficult sequence of beauty shots I want to link together. All that said though, as I gain in experience the process is certainly getting a lot faster and easier.

&gt; ###Why do you feel inspired to make each video?

&gt; There's a number of things that can cause me to make a video on a subject. In the early days, it was the desire to see what was over the next horizon, what was in the next system. That was back during Premium Beta when we only had access to a limited number of systems. It was the curiosity of wondering what was out there, and I wanted to be able to relate that sense of awe and wonder to other people. As time has gone on there have been other things I have found equally inspiring, just a few examples; the way the game places certain stations near stars, the colour of a planet in contrast to a nebula it is within, the rich lore and history of the game. I enjoy trying to put all of these subjects into a format which people may find interesting or inspiring.

&gt; ###Why do you play Elite: Dangerous in general? What excites you most about the game?

&gt; Exploration is the big thing for me! I'm not just talking about the scanning of planets (in fact I don't do a whole lot of that), what I actually enjoy is the sense of adventure and discovery. I can spend ages on the galaxy map searching for a new destination or an undiscovered nebula. Once I find such a place, it may often take a long while to travel there, but all the while in my mind, I will be wondering what it will look like. Along the way I often find interesting looking planets or moons which I record footage of to add into a video. In terms of exploration there really is nothing else like Elite: Dangerous out there. I'm an avid nature buff, and like to explore forests, mountains and any other wild nature places I can. Elite, for me manages to hook into that sense of exploration I have. Getting down to the surface of planets is going to blow that wide open!

&gt; ###How long have you been playing Elite for?

&gt; Although I was old enough in 1984 to have played Elite, (I also owned a Spectrum 48k), unfortunately it was a game I never picked up. However I did play Frontier: Elite 2 on my Amiga, and it was a mind opening game. The manuals and the star chart poster added to that immensely. So, for the Elite franchise, I have been playing since 1993. Elite: Dangerous, I started playing the alpha access missions as soon as they were available to Premium Beta backers in early 2014. I backed the game on Kickstarter during the first days of the campaign and followed it pretty closely ever since.

&gt; ###Can you tell us about the Nebula video? You were a key part in making that CG happen.

&gt; The video was essentially a result of EGX. In my interview with Sandro Sammarco and Micheal Brookes, I asked them what they thought about the idea of a station within a nebula, and Micheal cheekily said there is a 'chance'. So I took that answer and ran with it, I posted a nebula station banner image to Twitter, which ended up getting re-tweeted over 100 times, at the same time as that I posted the Nebula video to YouTube suggesting that players push for such a community goal. So the player reaction to all that was fantastic, and they are the ones that made the whole thing blow up. A short while later, Zac Antonaci got in contact with me, asking for details about a potential nebula community goal and what the players might like to see. I posted a thread on the forums opening the discussion. To be clear there are a lot of people that have been pushing for nebula station for a long time, and they have done huge amounts of work with the community. My video is just one of the more visible cases, but that shouldn't detract from what others have done.

&gt; ###How are you enjoying interacting with the groups who are involved with this?

&gt; The various groups out there have been great! I have been in contact both in-game and out-of-game with with many of the well known groups. There is huge interest in getting a station out there in a nebula. Elite has some fantastic locations, and a station out there in a nebula will allow many more people to see these awesome places. Many of the groups have a huge desire to make that happen, and I stand in awe of their dedication and ability to organize so many players, who all work so well together.

&gt; ###What do you think are your favourite highlights from production, and also the finished products that you’ve come up with?

&gt; My favorite parts of production are editing some of the ""cinematic"" sequences together. Finding the right areas of space, and editing footage together in a certain specific way and then finding the right music to go with that gives me a lot of pleasure. Occasionally, the final clip gives me inspiration to find a few words, and when that happens I add some narration to the segment.  It's hard to point to a video that is my ""favorite"", because I see so many flaws in the work I do, there are often many thing I would change, or like to do better. But in many of my videos there are small parts that I am very pleased with. One of my favourite videos is ""This Galaxy"", which is a short music video without narration, it just seemed to come together very well.

&gt; ###What inspired you to make the videos in the first place?

&gt; Making regular Elite videos was never something I actually set out to do, it simply started with recording a few clips here and there, and making a few short videos to show what the game was actually like. During Premium Beta, a lot of players were interested in the game, but didn't actually have access to it - so my first videos were born out of that. Over time I realized how much I actually enjoyed making them, so started making longer videos, which in the end became regular releases.

&gt; ###What’s next for Obsidian Ant?

&gt; Horizons is the obvious next step, I look forward to the challenges of making entertaining and interesting videos on the surface of planets - it will all be quite different to what I have done so far. I also have a new video series featuring a role-played story arc. I actually started that in April this year, but I have since reworked and ""remastered"" them. This will be two series of videos each containing three episodes. There will be a story-arc running across all six-episodes. The first of those should be on my YouTube channel right now (or if not, then very soon) - and the series is called ""Commander's Odyssey"".",2015-11-03 12:34:24+00:00,cwmsdar,1.0,t3_3rcfuh,125.0,EliteDangerous

The page is for a quick reference to what content, features and key improvements arrived in ED and when, for the purpose of informing ED owners returning to the cockpit after time away.  Those CMDRs are mainly interested in the new gameplay improvements since they last played - the highlights of each major build version - hence the current order described as follows:

* Each major-update/expansion brings key improvements - the part returning CMDRs mostly care about.
* Subsequent patches mostly fix bugs and correct balance issues that appeared - they follow-on from the aforementioned expansion.
* Example: 1.3 added Powerplay, while 1.3.03 brought Powerplay balance changes.

For someone wanting to know everything that's been fixed, in chronological order, the page in isolation doesn't satisfy anyway as it omits ~90% of the changelogs' information.  Hence the dates, changelog links, and a count of each log's notes - expansions commonly have 300+ documented changes.

5929,"Anti-firewall C &amp; P:

&gt; #####Hello Commanders!

&gt; Good discussion! A little info for you folk, so you know where we’re coming from.

&gt; Your ship is vulnerable to enemy fire when landed, even if you're not in it. Once you travel beyond a distance threshold (that we're still playing with) or at you're command, the ship will launch and enter a holding pattern around that location, effectively removed from threat.

&gt; There will be a delay when calling the ship back, based on your distance to the point of its departure (again, we're still looking at these numbers). It will likely never get insanely long, as ships are capable of travelling pretty quickly, but it will definitely be a consideration.

&gt; There's a couple of reasons for our choice here. 

&gt; Technically, once you move far enough away from your ship, it doesn't really exist for anyone except you, so there'd be little to gain from having it stay (we will hopefully have other options for marking the location of your ship if you need to get back to it).

&gt; Because of this, having the ship leave reduces the possibility of it ""popping"" back into existence when other Commanders are in the vicinity as you return (this runs the gamut of being an incredibly unlikely corner case to a distinct possibility depending on where you landed).

&gt; From a design point of view, having something so precious as a ship be vulnerable when the Commander has little to no chance of rescuing it (if you parked your ship and drove off a long distance from it) seems undesirable to me. I guess I would see it as being akin to leaving your ship present in space when you left the game. My issue here is that there's no sensible player choice here, only a strong punishment and disincentive to using your SRV for any decent amount of ground travel time. 

&gt; The same logic applies to making the ship use fuel when waiting. Currently, it doesn’t, which I could argue contextually is because it’s running in emergency power mode, but which I’m just as happy saying that I don’t think the extra punishment of having the ship run out of fuel is worth the consistency gained by doing it in this instance.

&gt; I'm not saying that this sort of persistence isn't valid (some games do use mechanics to this effect, more or less), just that I'm not a big fan in this particular case, for the reasons above.

&gt; ###Location: Kaushpoos

&gt; ###Title: Unexpectedly effective pirate takes Kaushpoos traders by storm

&gt; Pilot communities were recently abuzz with news of a new pirate terrorising the Kaushpoos system, taking advantage of the increased trader activity as part of the initiative to construct a deep space station in the Pleiades . 

&gt; I was one of the first pilots to be interdicted by the now famous Commander Rappy the Rapscalion, as I hurtled through the void towards Nevile Station in my heavily shielded Python with a precious cargo of gold, I was interdicted without warming. Evasive action was immediately undertaken to resist the interdiction, but to my shock and confusion I realised my attacker was a tiny Sidewinder. 

&gt; Out of curiosity I submitted to the interdiction, and brought my weapons to bear on this unknown. Commander Rappy immediately undertook a vicious assault, weaving a heartrending tale of how circumstance forced this poor citizen to undertake the pirate's life to feed a family, imploring me for a measly four tonnes of cargo so that they could eat, decrying the amount of times pirates just seeking credits to keep their families alive had to spend measly reserves on new ships and parts after more skilled pilots blew them to pieces.

&gt; In the end no number of Shield Cell Banks would have been enough. Reports from other commanders flooded in, this plucky commander had succeeded in stealing not just scraps of our gold and palladium. 

&gt; No, Commander Rappy stole something far more valuable. Our hearts.

With your 4670m you can happily switch on AF in any DX10 (or lower DX) game with minuscule performance loss.  This is of course assuming that your 4670m is powerful enough to play those games anyway.

The discount continues until sometime after the initial Horizons expansion is released, the playerbase will be given warning when the discount will end.  Players therefore will have time to gauge opinion of others whether it's worth the purchase for them.  There's no need to blindly pre-order.

Or they can purchase it at a later discounted-sale price, e.g. at the end of 2016 when all of Horizons' expansions are out and they have full knowledge of them.  Or not at all and simply carry on playing ED's core game as it's updated.  No-one is forced to do anything.

ED doesn't have a subscription, can be played when ever, and will continue to be updated (new ships &amp; upgrades; new types &amp; structured missions; updates to Power/Minor-Faction gameplay; better trading simulation; etc).

With VR it's unbelievable - I had a DK2 for four months last year, sold it due to low resolution - and while I still find the game great fun on my 42"" LED now, the image is *flat* - I do miss VR. Yay for CV1/Vive soon™!

There's lots of areas where the game needs improvement, which I've stated if you check my post history.  However, I don't play one game constantly and split my gaming time (average 10-15hr a week) accordingly. Currently it's Mad Max and ED; every time I fire up Elite there's always something fresh &amp; fun for me to do :)

I can easily see the disgruntlement of other players who've say come from more established MMOs (EVE, WoW, GW2, etc) or space-empire sims (X-series, which I've played too) wanting more ""end-game"" in ED after hundreds of hours of playtime - station building, faction/sector control, etc.  I don't need those features myself, but I'd welcome them to bring in a more dynamic &amp; dangerous galaxy (I play in Open ~98% of the time) for me to lone-wolf around, and expect they'll arrive within the next year or two, as Power/Minor-Faction gameplay is advanced &amp; improved upon.

Unfortunately, AMD's DirectX 11 driver is inefficient compared to Nvidia's, meaning poor performance in CPU-heavy titles resulting in lower frame-rates and off-putting stutter when the processor is under load. We simply can't recommend an AMD card at this time in scenarios where CPU power is limited. Our tests with Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and The Crew are revelatory

They do support runtimes 0.5 &amp; 0.6 so will resolve the issues for Nvidia/Rift users, assuming enough DxDiags are sent in.

Once SDK 1.0 arrives, with all the feature differences it will have (especially no Extended Mode as removed since SDK 0.6), FDev will look into implementing it.  Any speculation on SDK 1.0 is futile as only Oculus knows what features will be in that revision.

Note: SDK 0.8 removes compatibility with runtimes 0.6 and below, 0.9 will remove 0.7 and below support.  VR applications are being constantly recoded to support the latest beta-SDK revisions as they arrive.  FDev have chosen to wait until the SDK is feature &amp; compatibility stable.

I'll repeat what I stated in the OP: ""Note that no issues are resolved for only PC/Mac, i.e. fixes developed during the past week/fortnight that didn't make it into the 1.4.1 Microsoft validation patch. MS's validation process takes 5-14 days.""

&gt; Your rant doesn't make any sense.

It does.  Today's update is identical for all three platforms.  As the Xbox update needs validation, the patch has therefore existed for at least 5 days, since the date it was sent to MS.  Consequently, PC/Mac players have had to wait 5+ days - for an update that was ready - for Microsoft to give the ok for Xbox update deployment.

&gt;  The primary goal will be to destroy your enemies and their infrastructure through orbital bombardment from capital ships and/or an array of smaller spacecraft including bombers, interceptors, and corvettes.

&gt; A match begins with each team being allocated some combination of space stations, planetary bases, factories, and AI controlled defense turrets. Each player will start with a moderate amount of credits with which they can buy ships and equipment. Every couple of minutes a factory spawns a cargo ship which will transfer raw materials to the nearest space station or planetary base for processing into credits. These credits are split evenly among the members of the team however if the cargo ship is destroyed its owners lose the credits. Players are able to donate credits to other members of their team so that they can pool resources.

What's the reason for the new patch delays?  Does this mean the PC/Mac updates have been held back two-weeks, for MS authorisation of the corresponding Xbox update (despite not having full cross-play between platforms)?

Even if the combined Xbox/PC/Mac update was sent to MS for authorisation a fortnight ago, haven't new fixes &amp; updates for PC/Mac been created since then (without the MS red tape)?

6151,"C &amp; P for the firewalled:

&gt; Dave Hughes is the creator of [Elite Encounters](http://daftworks.co.uk/eliterpg/index.php/Welcome), a ""traditional Roleplaying Game (RPG) set in the universe of Frontier Developments' ELITE and its sequels Frontier: Elite II, Frontier: First Encounters and the forthcoming Elite: Dangerous."" Community Manager Edward Lewis was lucky enough to experience Encounters with the creator himself as DM, and thouroughly recommends checking the RPG out if you ever get the chance!

&gt; In this interview, Dave tells us about the challenges he's faced when putting together an RPG with a dense rule set and complicated mecahnics, and explains exactly why he loves Elite Dangerous and the game's community. Don't miss out getting involved with Dave's amazing charity work [here](https://www.justgiving.com/selezen/). Dave will also be at [Fantasticon](http://www.fantasticon.co.uk/) this week, so if you like the sound of an Elite Dangerous RPG, and you live in the area, don't miss out!

&gt; #####What exactly are you involved in with Elite: Dangerous?

&gt; I am writing the Elite Encounters Roleplaying Game as of one of the writers packs from the Elite Dangerous Kickstarter.

&gt; #####What inspired you to make Encounters? Why Elite-themed particularly? 

&gt; Elite was the first thing in my life to awaken that need to write something. My first ever ""fan fiction"" (although it wasn't called that back then before the internet came out) was written to explain why my Elite commander had been busted back to Harmless between playing the Spectrum and Amiga versions. From there Elite was my main science-fiction ""universe"" to live in, so to speak. When I got into roleplaying games and a group of us wanted to play a sci-fi game, I suggested an Elite-based one since some of us were fans of the game, and we decided to give it a go - I wrote up a system that evolved for a couple of years before university ended. When the writer's packs came up in the ED Kickstarter all that came back to me and I jumped at the chance to be able to do an official RPG set in the Elite universe.

&gt; #####What's your favourite thing about Elite Dangerous?

&gt; There are so many things to choose from! The audio is very very good, but what blows me out of the water is the graphics engine and the visual design. Every hyperjump is awe-inspiring, and the stars and stations rushing towards you as you exit is breathtaking. The diversity in the ship designs and the detail inside the cockpits is incredible. I don't have to use my imagination any more to fill in those polygons from the original Elite. I can't speak for everyone, but  it's all just like I imagined it. :-)

&gt; #####How did you first get Encounters off the ground?

&gt; I remember when the writer's packs became available in the ED Kickstarter. I thought ""I wish I could put together a 70,000 word story and do a writer's pack. Then as the KS drew to a close I suddenly remembered the RPG I did at uni and almost kicked myself for missing the chance. I had a long chat with Michael Brookes, where we discussed the RPG and what it would contain and although he was concerned that it was stepping a bit close to the line of what a ""novel"" was, he graciously allowed me to go ahead with it. Following in the footsteps of so many others (and with lots of advice from Michael), I did a Kickstarter to get the funding for the pledge and have been lucky enough to have some great supporters.  I got funded, made the pledge, rolled up my sleeves and started writing. OK, it's rolled on a bit longer than expected, but it's getting there!

&gt; #####What else are you involved in?

&gt; I have a couple of Elite websites - one for the RPG and one that tries to tie together the very disparate universes of the original Elite and Frontier: Elite 2. I also do a [live stream every Monday](http://www.twitch.tv/cmdr_noctivagus) on Twitch where I play Elite Dangerous. I dabble in a bit of fan fiction and graphic design when no-one's looking as well. Just after the ED kickstarter finished, I was honoured to be invited to be part of the team creating the background information about the Elite Universe for the fiction authors. That was a surreal, rewarding experience. 

&gt; #####You must have had some fun playtest sessions, what have been some highlights?

&gt; Definitely! I've managed to organise games at all of the conventions over the last couple of years, and the Lave Radio guys participate in an audio-based gaming session. We (Anthony Olver, James Vigor, Dan Grubb, Ben Moss-Woodward and myself) also did a live video session for the 30th Anniversary that hasn't finished yet! There are other groups testing the system as well, and the 24 hour stream I did recently featured a few games that helped with testing - including guest players from Frontier Developments!

&gt; #####Where are you up to with development?

&gt; I've finished the background sections and the main character based rules and systems. Pretty much all that's left is the ship combat, miniatures system and some polish to the commodities lists. I'd say about 80% there if I can just get past this bout of writer's block!

&gt; #####How hard is it to develop something like this?

&gt; It's definitely harder than I first thought. I underestimated the amount of work that goes into developing an RPG. Writting a novel is about 70,000 to 100,000 words - The RPG currently stands at just shy of 200,000 words, and there's added complications of tables, statistics, graphics and so on to worry about. The game system itself was relatively easy, but trying to develop a miniatures combat system that is faithful to the computer game whilst not being too complex is a real challenge.

&gt; #####What's your favourite thing about the Elite: Dangerous community?

&gt; I love how supportive and generous the Elite community is. For many many years I've said that Elite fans are the most genuine and caring people on the planet, and for the most part that has remained true through a huge period of expansion. I couldn't wish to be part of a nicer, better community. Of course, having an amazing community management team helps too. ;-)

&gt; #####How long have you been playing Elite for?

&gt; I started playing Elite in 1985 on the Sinclair Spectrum. That's about 30 years now on and off. Community projects and fan-created media like Frontier Astro, the Elite BBS and, most importantly, Oolite have played a big part in keeping Elite at the forefront of my consciousness until the long wait for Elite IV was over.

&gt; #####What can we expect from you in future?

&gt; Once the RPG has been completed and published I'd love to actually write that novel I've been trying to do for nearly 20 years. I'm also hoping to do more livestreaming of Elite Dangerous (as well as other games) because I've found it really enjoyable.

&gt; Thanks Frontier and the Elite community for the support and advice over the last few years with the RPG and other little projects. My main website is at [daftworks.co.uk](http://daftworks.co.uk/eliterpg/index.php/Welcome) and has links to the RPG website and the Elite website.

6164,"We in the Council are currently discussing the issues outlined in the OP.

In the meantime, I do have a few comments to add here.

As the *issue* arose due to a thread's title, I'll begin with that.  We all agree that ""rape"" has multiple meanings, depending on the context, and that its use is offensive and disrespectful in the *more common* meaning.

However, the context is not obtainable from the title alone - the OP has to be viewed.  The title was therefore ambiguous, and if taken in the wrong way, the **more common** way, it is disrespectful.  As /u/Deathwatch101 has already stated, to Seize was the intended context there, so why not use it?  ""The forceful seizure of Vesuvit, etc"": clear context, therefore faster to understand, and little chance of causing confusion or offence.  I.e. a **better** title!

The Sub's rule ""Be respectful to each other"" covers the infringing title anyway.  As the **more common use** of the word ""rape"" is sexual and offensive, its use in the title which gave **no context** is disrespectful.  A title change takes a few moments, job done, everyone's happy.

&gt; ###Answers from the Devs 15/10/15

&gt; Hey guys, 

&gt; It’s been a couple of weeks since our last “Answers from the devs” thread. So we’ve compiled a new list, sent them over to the team and got the following answers for you.  

&gt; As always if you have any burning questions post them below (/u/ZacAntonaci_Frontier) and we’ll compile a new thread soon. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####How many of the 30 ships are in the game currently? Any news on what the final ones to be announced are?

&gt; Here’s a list of the ships we’ve announced so far, and as an extra treat we’ve added the names of the five ships coming as part of Elite Dangerous 1.5. Remember, these are just the ship names, and we’ll be revealing loads of exciting details about them in the coming weeks. 

&gt; 1. Sidewinder
&gt; 2. Eagle
&gt; 3. Hauler
&gt; 4. Adder
&gt; 5. Imperial Eagle
&gt; 6. Viper
&gt; 7. Cobra MK III
&gt; 8. Diamondback Scout
&gt; 9. Lakon Type 6 
&gt; 10. Diamondback Explorer
&gt; 11. Imperial Courier
&gt; 12. Vulture 
&gt; 13. Asp Explorer
&gt; 14. Federal Dropship
&gt; 15. Lakon Type 7
&gt; 16. Federal Assault Ship
&gt; 17. Imperial Clipper
&gt; 18. Federal Gunship
&gt; 19. Orca
&gt; 20. Fer-De-Lance
&gt; 21. Python
&gt; 22. Lakon Type 9
&gt; 23. Anaconda
&gt; 24. F63 Condor (CQC only)

&gt; And to come:

&gt; 1. Imperial Short Range Fighter (CQC only)
&gt; 2. Lakon Keelback 
&gt; 3. Viper MK IV
&gt; 4. Asp Scout 
&gt; 5. Federal Corvette 
&gt; 6. Imperial Cutter 
&gt; 7. Cobra MK IV (for owners of Season 1 and Season 2)

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####What is the minimum spec for Horizons? 

&gt; We don’t have a final minimum spec just yet because we’re still working on the optimization. We’re hopeful it won’t be significantly different from the current game. However it will require a PC that supports Direct X11 as Horizons uses compute shaders. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####What are the technical issues with Oculus, is this a move towards exclusivity for VR platforms? 

&gt; We now support both Oculus Rift (via the 0.5 SDK) and SteamVR/Vive. Because of some changes to the Oculus SDK, we are working closely with Oculus to support a later SDK, but we cannot use 0.7.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####If I reset my commander data, what happens to my friends list?

&gt; Absolutely nothing, your friends list is tied to your account. If you want to reset back to zero and start with a clean slate then more power to you! Good luck Commander. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####Will there be more decals in the store?

&gt; There will be more decals coming to the store and we are looking at new and interesting ways to use them in the future with Elite Dangerous, and I think you’ll be excited when you see what we have planned.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####When are you going to release paint jobs for the Diamondback Explorer?

&gt; Paint jobs for the Diamond Explorer, and many of the other ships in the catalogue, will be coming to the Frontier store soon! 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####Can we get an update on the Mac version of Horizons? 

&gt; Unfortunately neither Open GL nor Metal on Mac support Compute Shaders and these are vital for Elite Dangerous: Horizons. We have investigated the issue at length and found that all other options currently simply won’t allow us the performance that a game of this size and detail needs. Once Macs are able to support compute shaders, or other technical options are available, we will certainly be keen on supporting that platform. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####How much cargo will an SRV hold?

&gt; The Scarab SRV will be able to hold two units of cargo, however on the planet surface there are other things to do and collect which may not require much storage. More information on that… soon. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####Do you think that having the ability to have a ship delivered to a station of my choosing would be possible in the future?

&gt; This is something on our radar and is something we’re keen to implement in the game as part of a future update, but we have nothing to announce on that at the moment.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####Are there any plans to improve the navigation system and add functionality to it?

&gt; Every aspect of Elite Dangerous will be continually iterated on and improved… The navigation system is no exception. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####Will landing on planets give you more exploration data?

&gt; Landing on planets will eventually net you more exploration data. This isn’t something that will appear at launch in Elite Dangerous: Horizons though but there are new things to discover on the surface and a new way to find them. More on this coming soon!

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####If you are in orbital cruise, can you accidentally crash into the planet by entering too steep? 

&gt; If you’re flying straight at the ground and you decide not to pull up as you approach the planet surface, you will most certainly crash!

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####What's the plan on making your CQC tournament a cool viewing experience?

&gt; We have something very special planned for the CQC tournament that everybody will be able to get involved in. We’re continuing to develop CQC and spectators are certainly something we are keeping in mind. We’ll have the full details soon, but make sure you get practicing your CQC skills right away!

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####Is it going to be a possibility of getting the lifetime pass released again?

&gt; It’s not available at the moment, but the lifetime could return to the Frontier Store again at some point in the future. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; #####Will skimmers be able to be piloted/controlled by players, or just NPC's?

&gt; At the launch of Elite Dangerous: Horizons, the Skimmers will be NPC-controlled assailants – challenging and varied opponents to take on as you explore the planet’s surface. We’re looking in to the possibility of making them pilot able as part of a future update but we can’t promise anything at this time.",2015-10-15 16:45:25+00:00,cw0sp8s,1.0,t3_3ovjeu,250.0,EliteDangerous

6192,"Obligatory C &amp; P:

&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; As I’m sure you can imagine work on the Elite Dangerous: Horizons Planetary Landings release is continuing at pace and this week – one of the major new features is the ability to drive the SRV on the surface. We’ve approached adding the SRV in the same way that we did when originally adding the flight controls into the game. They key here is to have the driving as a fun experience in itself as well as with the gameplay elements layered on top of it. As with the ships we have a robust physics system at the core and it’s with the controls we turn that into a fun experience.

&gt; The SRV has some cool advantages over normal vehicles you get to drive in game, the most obvious of which are the thrusters. These provide two key features, the first is the ability to boost of the surface allowing for powered jumps to get out of craters or to cross chasms. While in the air you can you can manually adjust the thrusters in the same way as in a ship with Flight Assist turned off. This allows for some amazing acrobatics as well as allowing you to reach locations that would be difficult to reach with normal driving. It’s also useful if you get yourself stuck!

&gt; As with the rest of the game the surface of the worlds you can land on is recreated on a 1:1 scale, not only spatially but with gravity as well. Gravity has a big effect on the handling of the SRV and here the thrusters provide their second major function. When testing the SRV in different environments there are edge cases with very low gravity and extremely high gravity where the SRV becomes impossible to handle. The thrusters help compensate for these extremes in handling, but only to a limited degree – it feels very different driving on a tiny moon compared to a massive terrestrial planet.

&gt; As already mentioned making the driving fun in itself is an important goal for us. While the thrusters do add to a large extent (there’s something quite magical with boosting out of a crater and into the sunrise!) the actual contact with the vehicle and the surface provides a lot of feedback. Similar to sand buggies, if you try to push the SRV’s performance then you need to work harder to keep it under control. Feedback is very important here – the ships audio and VFX, along with the handling, create the response you need to let you know what’s going on.

&gt; The SRV is equipped with a turret optimised for engaging local opponents like skimmers (see last week’s dev update for more information on these) and other SRV’s (if hostile players are in the area). In theory you could take on a ship, but ship mounted weapons are much more powerful than the SRV’s so it’s best not to! You should also beware some of large defensive turrets – these are equipped to tackle low flying ships, but pose a threat to SRV’s as well.

&gt; Combat is just one feature of the SRV, it’s capable of carrying a small number of cargo canisters and also has a new device for finding things on the surface – more on that in a couple of weeks time!

&gt; Next week the second batch of player group backed minor factions should go live. Thanks to some brilliant feedback from our players, we’ve made progress with fixing some odd behaviour with influence levels – we hope to address this next week. 

&gt; Exploration data should be operating smoothly now after some issues since the 1.4 release. If you do encounter a further issue then make sure to raise a bug and we’ll investigate. 

&gt; We are currently working on a client update for PC/Mac and Xbox One, all being well these will be released next week. As well as various fixes we’re adjusting the NPC interdiction so it isn’t quite as punishing as it is at the moment.

&gt; Thanks,

Cool, and like with other games they can play ED whenever they feel like as there's no subscription.  I've personally never seen the appeal of playing one game only - currently playing Mad Max and Witcher 3 alongside ED - I can't play any game day-after-day-after-day.

&gt; if no mans sky makes a full game like £50 and you can do everything ED has promised over seasons, well then this game will be well and trully up shit creek then.

No Mans Sky is only a competitor for ED on exploration &amp; crafting terms - it's definitely the forerunner on PGen'd planetary life, and we've yet to see crafting mechanics of either game.  But on everything else - combat, trading, piracy, missions, factions, co-op, PvP, roleplay, VR support, realism - ED is massively ahead.  Hello Games have stated players should see NMS as a single-player game, due to the rarity of seeing another player, why is fine by me and the majority of players waiting for its release.",2015-10-14 17:24:12+00:00,cvzlrsu,12.0,t1_cvzkcyi,2086.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; Going for geek points here but I’ve met William Shatner and shaken his hand. The autograph is probably one of my most treasured items! Met captain Kirk and helped build the whole Galaxy, that’s small club isn’t it?

&gt; #####If you could ask the community one question, what would it be?

&gt; I ruined this by getting Ant to answer my earlier maths question! (sorry) 

&gt; I guess I’d be curious to see how people think the game will be thought of in another 30 years, where will technology and gaming be and what influence or space will ED take up in the path there? Using all the various VR devices that are coming out while the games been in development has really made this all feel like a pivotal time in games and tech so I’m curious to see how history remembers this point in time.

&gt; ###Matthew Dickinson, Head of Technical Art and Rendering

&gt; #####What does an average day at work look like for you? 

&gt; Every day is different! I work as the Head of Technical Art and Rendering which is a cross company role. Most of my time is spent on Elite although I do have work to do on our other awesome game (Planet coaster!) Being a Head of Department means I have a lot of meetings to go over things my team is looking at or things that may influence them. Monday morning is probably the busiest time for me, for example we have a leads meeting for each project first thing to cover the week ahead and any issues from the previous week. 

&gt; After that we get into what we call the work streams, these are basically the threads of work we do, so we have a work stream for planets for example. We go through what everyone is up to and any issues, try and make sure everyone is aware of any deadlines or impacts from other departments and if we have any issues stopping people working or needing further discussion this is where we do that. 

&gt; Across every week day morning we have a different leads meeting to discuss these work streams so a few months ago we’d talk about Elite in general on a Monday, Game-play on a Tuesday, Xbox on the Wednesday, Thursday was the point release meeting (1.3-1.4 etc) and Friday is Horizons day. The planets team work stream is three times a week, tech art once, render twice and then all the other ones in between to go through separate issues.

&gt; So yeah that’s quite a lot of meetings! When I can make it back to my desk I spend a lot of time working through various issues. My background is a technical artist so I spend a fair amount of time writing tools and looking at process and procedures to help the artists out.  The rest of the time is spent on the render side of things, the two go hand in hand quite nicely and I find it really rewarding to be able to work with all the talented artists and talented coders we have. 

&gt; As many of you know we use our own engine so there’s quite a lot of things we do to try and always improve how people work. Having our engine gives us a huge amount of flexibility to change things but that comes with lots of additional decisions and choices. On top of that we have lots of tools that help the senior/lead artists keep track of what people are up to. This helps us find performance issues at the point we build things rather than having to find things later when they’re in game. As you can imagine we have a galaxy of assets so it can get quite complex in terms of tracking what changes we make and finding things that might be breaking something further down the chain.

&gt; As I’m writing this we’re coming to the end of the horizons work so I’m spending a lot of the time working with the team on what I call “the glue” how we integrate all the separate features together and make sure everything works smoothly. When you work on such a large feature as this, you often find that it can be a long way into the feature before you see things come together. 

&gt; For example the initial work focused on generating the planet geometry and materials separately so we could get the right results with each before we bring them together. Then we work on letting the Artists create all the features on the terrain, how bases are formed and built, how lighting works, rocks, ice and all of that. Then these individual elements are folded back to the main game. We do this to try and let people work for as long and as uninterrupted as possible to maximise efficiency as once everything comes together you get more bugs and issues. All of that work ends up in a horizons version of the game that we keep separate until we’re ready to bring that to the main game and work on “the glue” then it’s on to QA and design to get the game-play working and all the features integrated fully. Meanwhile we focus on mopping any performance issues or little tweaks.

&gt; #####What aspect of the game have you worked on that you are most proud of?

&gt; Tough question! There’s so much overall. It always amazes me to look back 3,6,9,12 months etc and see where we were. This time last year we were focusing on getting the first version of the game out and were just starting to understand the sheer size of it! Here we are now we’ve made some 400 Billion star systems and we’re letting people land on a huge chunk of those planets. The sheer size of the game is massive, every star known to mankind is in there and that’s a tiny fraction of what’s in the game, we’ve built the rest from science as we understand it today. 

&gt; Everything in the game we’ve strived to make as real as possible, it’s life size and the sheer size is mind boggling. Has anyone ever done anything close to this size and believability? I don’t think so and there’s definitely a feeling in the studio that what we’re doing now is as ground breaking as the original game when it came out all those years ago. 

&gt; That aspect I think is really important; to do justice to the original vision, stay true to what David wanted but also to bring it right up to date, it’s a massively rich experience and to have worked in such a senior position on something like this makes me quite humble. How many people get to say “yah the galaxy? Yah we made that!” It speaks volumes about the talent and dedication we have as a studio to get to that point, not forgetting the fans who joined us on that journey. 

&gt; #####What's your favourite thing about Elite Dangerous?

&gt; Like above I think the sheer scale and the boundless ambition. For every release we do there’s so much that we’d want to go back and add double/triple/quadruple! The to-do list is just massive and as long as we can we’ll be chewing through that to expand what’s there. 

&gt; One of my personal highlights is seeing where people go, reading the forums and seeing the strange places people have discovered is amazing. I’m really looking forward to seeing all the worlds people are going to be exploring when we release Horizons. I keep meaning to try and calculate the approximate surface area we’re about to unleash on people. If anyone wants to guess It would be really fun to see in square km what we’re about to unlock! 

&gt; (So we went and did the maths and turns out if you unwrapped all the land-able planets you’d create an area 10AU by 10AU (1.5 sextillion Olympic swimming pools if you think that way) which would be equivalent of a square with a length the same as Jupiter’s Orbit, so imagine driving from one side of Jupiter’s orbit to the other and that would be the length of one side of this area. Which just illustrates the size of the space in our galaxy! That’s several trillion planets all laid out and it can’t even fill our solar system. If you’re still feeling geeky then at 40kph it would take you 4000 years to make that 10AU drive. Thanks to Ant Ross for going through those numbers!)

&gt; #####What was the biggest challenge you came up against during game development?

&gt; I guess three things stand out for different reasons, in no particular order:

&gt; * **Planets:** I’ve spent quite awhile “looking after” some aspects of this with Producer Eddie and others, we’ve got a sizeable team of people working away on all the aspects and while I’m not going to try and claim any credit for their work I’d like to think that I’ve helped steer them on what I believe is the right road. What we’ve done is basically a lot of the stuff we wanted to do when we built the planets in season 1. For various reasons we used some different techniques but now it’s great to get back to how we wanted to structure them, fully science-based as much as we can make it.
&gt; * **The galaxy map:** This was where I spent a lot of time during year one on the project we had a small team and a lot to do. To represent all the galaxy’s 400 billion stars on a map in real-time where you can zoom in and out at will was a big ask. That’s on top of the artist element as well. As supposed to the planets the galaxy map had a lot more of my decision making in and the end result is pretty close to the original vision we discussed as the most viable way of doing it. Again all the guys did an amazing job and we spent a long time talking through things with David on a weekly basis. If you’ve not noticed yet David is hugely passionate about space and we had a lot of long conversations about how science met vision and what you’d see in various parts of the galaxy. It was also a key aim of mine to use the map to generate the in-game locations. Originally the plan was to generate the in game background by using a lot of separate techniques the map didn’t have but we worked hard to make sure the map was the focus and there’s only a few more expensive things we do when we generate the background for each location. This really helps tie the game together from my POV as the player can explore the galaxy via the map and get a flavour of the sky around any star before they get there.
&gt; * **Lastly was CQC on Xbox One:** it was a goal very early on that it had to run at 60fps to make it fun and playable and we did a lot of work to get to that target. It’s hopefully not noticeable but we changed a lot of things when players play CQC to allow us to optimise everything as much as possible. We did things this way as we’re very conscious of players feeling we might change the game negatively to support new features, we’ve really avoided doing that and always taken a harder approach to make sure we keep the main game as players love it. To get the game to run at 60fps in CQC mode was a big achievement.

&gt; #####What have you learned from working on Elite Dangerous?

&gt; Space is big.... and to-do lists can only ever get bigger!

&gt; #####Federation, Empire, or Alliance? And why?

&gt; I like the lone wolf approach personally!

6224,"&gt; Horizons is £39.99 last time I checked
&gt;&gt; Add £39.99 a pop to every single season

Your statement comments on purchasing of each season (e.g. Horizons), thereby implies ownership of the previous season (in this case ED).  Owners of ED get £10 (or equivalent currency) off Horizons - therefore it's £30, not £40.  From the exact page you linked it states ""For a limited time all **existing Elite Dangerous players will receive a £10 loyalty discount**"".

&gt; Also see the thumbs down on my honest opinion, so this isn't the best place to ask about ED frankly the fanboys are pervasive.

&gt;&gt; Not worth it, base game is pretty empty and broken only thing to do is mercilessly grind the same old repetitive tasks ad infinitum. Add £39.99 a pop to every single season, your going to end up with the worlds most boring and expensive game totalling around £200-300 quid, don't say I didn't warn you.

You want quantum travel.""

&gt; ""It's a huge play area. No one's going to feel compressed here. And that's what we're putting you in.""

6259,"""How would you do it differently?"" was my question.

&gt; At the very start they said that they started it with no experience.

Of running an MMO, this is their first.  Of designing &amp; managing different database layers and communications - between servers, other servers, and clients - it appears they did.

&gt; How about hiring **someone** who has a clue? For starters.

Who from the MMO industry would you choose: a producer, backend developer, frontend developer, server db admin, instance designer?  Or all of them, each from different MMO backgrounds and conflicting ways of doing things?  You can't exactly poach an entire production team from a top MMO dev. Note: prior to ED there was no major/successful MMO based in the UK, therefore hiring/poaching would mean persuading those to move countries ""Hi, you work for Blizzard?  Come to England and work for a small 300 employee company, we're taking a gamble on bringing Space-Sims back.  No, it doesn't rain much here at all"".

&gt; Secondly, this whole presentation is about how they store different kind of data differently. But to me 'differentness' isn't apparent.

Yep.  They've used MySQL and MongoDB depending on the data-fetch/sync requirements, as both DB formats have their benefits - sounds like *differentness* to me.

&gt; They built their own ad-hoc distributed database. Well done.

If it meets their requirements, then why not?

&gt; Heard about how Apple bought FoundationDB? Now those people do have a clue.

Because Apple bought them?  [FoundationDB's version 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoundationDB) was released August 2013, ~1.5yr after ED's development began, i.e. too late.  Their development appears to have slowed somewhat too, as it appears the last stable version was released 10 months ago, and they ceased downloads in March this year.  Do they have a clue how to develop an end-user application using their DB?  Who knows, but as Apple appear to have blocked (public knowledge of) external firms using them we'll never know.",2015-10-13 00:16:05+00:00,cvxkdlg,7.0,t1_cvxjekc,1590.0,EliteDangerous

6272,"No worries, I'll try to answer in detailed pieces if that's ok:

&gt; do you think they can pull that off, I mean the whole procedural generated atmospheres, nature, creatures and cities

Yes - genuinely - but it'll take a little time of course.  Back in 1993, Frontier's CEO David Braben released [Frontier Elite 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier:_Elite_II) (coded solely by himself!?) had PGen'd planetside cities, missions, gravity effects, just on a much lower quality scale due to the hardware available.  David has been an expert of PGen for 30 years (Elite 1 used it), and [Frontier Developments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_Developments) now has just shy of 300 employees, with around 110 devs working on ED.  Check out this PGen atmos-cloud footage from their [PGen dev blog](https://youtu.be/iTBvpd3_Vqk?t=4m1s) from 3 years ago - the whole video's a great insight too.

Two years ago Hello Games showed us the first footage of No Man's Sky's PGen nature and creatures, which they'd been developing for two years.  They had a team of 5 back then, and have since been developing their excellent tech into what promises to be a fantastic game for explorers.

Here's some YT footage of [creating basic PGen cities](https://youtu.be/-d2-PtK4F6Y) from a coder.  Surprisingly, only today we've been shown some [demos of a basic PGen system](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3oda8b/inspired_by_eds_new_footage_ive_been_working_on/) a coder's created, while awaiting ED:Horizons and NMS.

&gt; seems like creating a whole new game on top of that one.

Kind of, but the base game, engine, mechanics etc are already done - they're being extended/added to.  Frontier's [Stellar Forge](http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e&amp;id=76df98203b) has already created the data that defines the galaxy: star systems, planetary compositions, chance of life, etc.

For atmospheric planets, ED's flight model is already in-place (space), it needs to be adapted to allow for the variations of atmos/cloud/storms density, and their effects on each ship's flight mechanics.  PGen will create the gravity, atmos, clouds &amp; storms from the Stellar Forge data.

For nature and creatures, lots of 3D assets (modular) need to be created, and basic AI (creatures) that's *simpler* than the ship AI already done.  PGen the lot.

Cities will be the difficult area - not the cities themselves, but the human inhabitants - although with Frontier's smaller, secondary dev team working on [Planet Coaster](https://youtu.be/o16e9daqGko) for late 2016 release, they'll have PGen NPC-civilian code ready made for ED.

&gt; Were the sales really that good to support this kind of a project, it seems pretty big I hope it's not just false promises. Star Citizen is doing the same, but the money they got from kickstarter and ship pledges are much more than what Elite started with.

ED Kickstarter raised £2.2m, while Frontier themselves allotted £9m of reserves to its development, which started 6 months prior to KS.  By [August 31st 2015](https://www.frontier.co.uk/investor_relations/reports/news/?artid=525&amp;pageNum=0&amp;blk=275), 825k units of ED had sold, and in June 30th they had over £10m in cash reserves with no debt.  It's now estimated that ED's overall development budget (money available) is around £35m - approximately $40m lower than Star Citizen's $91m raised so far.  Note that this estimation excludes all ED unit sales since August - PC/Mac, new release on Xbox, Horizons pre-orders, Lifetime passes, etc - the revenue from which will go back into development of ED, it's expansion Seasons &amp; Planet Coaster.  In February 2016 they'll likely release a 6 month financial statement, as they've done previous years.

Even when you're not chasing someone, it still ruins the MMO-feel when random travel companions disappear even though you know they are there. Just in another instance now.

These immersion/game-killers are key issues that Frontier are gradually fixing with their matchmaking server.  Winged companions now *almost* always appear with you in instances, and while chased-targets are less reliably paired/matched it has improved a great deal since earlier this year.

Due to their unusual choice of P2P networking model, part of the difficulty Frontier encountered with matchmaking is players' router incompatibilities/peculiarities when handling UPNP traffic.  

Thankfully, the lengthy Xbox Game-Preview-Program (identical platform) and PC/Mac 1.4 Beta of CQC (game lobbies) together helped them isolate and identify many of the network-traffic bugs caused by the routers, and code fixes/workarounds.  [Here's an example CMDR](https://redd.it/3nd812) who saw a huge improvement just last week.

Some users still must port-forward to get the best results, but they tend to be owners of cheap/old/free-from-ISP routers that are regularly poor at UPNP.

6313,"&gt; Is there any place in game that you see more people?

Not currently.  Frontier plan to increase the instances sizes (player limits) as the networking and matchmaking improves.  Instances are created dynamically where needed, and players can cross instances with minimal effort.  A star system (e.g. Sol) could have a thousand players in it:

* Hundreds in orbits of planets (e.g. Earth, Mars), in separate 32p instances.
* Hundreds travelling between planets, in separate 32p Super-Cruise instances.
* Hundreds in or around stations/outposts, again in separate 32p instances.

&gt; 32 players? I thought this was supposed to be an mmo?

Everyone affects the same galaxy simulation and ED does meet the definition of MMO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game

&gt; a multiplayer video game which is capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously. By necessity, they are played over a network, such as the Internet. MMOs usually have at least one persistent world

The phrase originated following ED 1.0's release, by Scott Manley.  Many promised features were missing.

Those that describe(d) ED as M.W.I.D. want(ed) more content and depth to the in-game mechanics - more things to do, more ways to do said things, and more reasons to do those things.

Since 1.0 major features have been added - Community Goals, Wings, Powerplay, and now CQC, as well as many, many, many smaller improvements, like Galnet being fleshed out, player-group-sponsored Minor-Factions, better matchmaking.   Update 1.5 ""Ships"" soon to arrive, the Horizons content/features next year, and so on.

So:

* More things to do?  Check
* More ways to do said things?  Kinda (so far)

&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; This week has been another busy week and saw the simultaneous release of both Xbox One and the CQC update for PC and Mac. There were a few bumps with scaling out the servers,  which should be addressed today. As with previous releases we plan a minor update to sweep up some other issues as a title update for the Xbox One and minor update for PC and Mac once this is ready.

&gt; As part of the release some of us took part in a live AMA on Xbox One subreddit with a long list of questions that we had fun going through – I think we managed to answer most of them! You can read the AMA here:

&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/3nlmdg/its_frontier_developments_developers_of_elite/

&gt; Thanks to everyone on the subreddit for their questions. Later in the day Ed Lewis hosted some [live chats](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7glm5rbPHKw-XsTFLUu5N6dlLrvZA_1Y) with a number of developers and thanks again to everyone who took part.

&gt; Alongside the releases we also announced a CQC tournament with total prize value of over $100,000 - which includes some cool cash prizes of $15,000 for the final – you can expect more details on this soon! 

&gt; Next on the horizon (I can see this pun being used a lot :-) ) is the start of the second season of expansions with Planetary Landings and the accompanying 1.5 Ships update. I talked a bit last week about the mission changes coming, so this week I’ll look at some of the new enemies you’ll encounter on the surface in the Planetary Landings expansion. 

&gt; As can be expected there is a significant difference between the offensive and defensive capabilities of the ships and the smaller SRVs that you drive on the surface. While it is theory possible for an SRV to shoot down a ship – it’s really not something I’d recommend! From the ship’s perspective this is balanced by the SRVs being hard to hit, although if they do manage to hit, it would be devastating.

&gt; To provide the ground operations a more reasonable level of opponents we have added ‘skimmers’ which are capable of limited mobile operations to defend locations. Skimmers are remote controlled security and defence drones primarily designed to protect positions and restrict movement. They are designed to be hard to engage with ships, so the SRV with its rapid fire guns is the best way to tackle them. Be warned that while most rely on their armour, some may have shields.

&gt; They are remotely controlled and will usually have a command and control system or relay nearby – these define the area in which the skimmers linked to that system can operate. They are specifically designed for operations on planets and are very manoeuvrable, although incapable of space or high altitude flight. They operate best close to the ground.

&gt; Skimmers utilizes many standard manufacturing patterns and are built by  various corporations across the galaxy – including big names like Core Dynamics. They are available in different variants, each suited for a different role:

&gt; * **Core Dynamics S4 ‘sentry’ skimmer** – this is the most widely used skimmer in the vast semi-automated security and protection industry throughout the galaxy, and a mainstay product for Core Dynamics. Comes as standard with a belly-mounted standard recoil-ready small weapon mount, which will take both kinetic and thermal weapons. Designed with an automated alert system so a single pilot can operate multiple such drones.
&gt; * **Core Dynamics S5LM  ‘guardian’ skimmer** – Based on their S4 skimmers, but with reduced weight, and with an enhanced missile launcher weapon mount. A more expensive solution, but often used to protect higher value installations. It sacrifices armour to carry the weight of missiles and so is more vulnerable.
&gt; * **Achilles Corp Stinger-2 attack skimmer** – Smaller and quicker than Core Dynamics offerings in this sector, and also cheaper to buy. It has no weapon mount, but carries explosives, and can be directed by its pilot to self destruct, taking out its target.  Some installations use these skimmers to form a last line of defence for sensitive bases and outposts. In essence they are a flying bomb. The Achilles Corporation cut down its range of skimmers just to the Stinger-2, but it is rumoured they will be launching new skimmers to their range in the next few years.
&gt; * **Core Dynamics S9 ‘goliath’ skimmer** – A very effective solution to your security needs. Using four surface thrusters this armoured and well-armed skimmer is the most effective on the market. Its greater cost means it is generally only used by military clients, and use is not permitted in some jurisdictions given their offensive abilities. 

&gt; While most skimmers are usually found near bases, given the recent rise in scavenging of shipwrecks, some transport vessels with higher value cargoes now carry automated distress response packageswhich include skimmers, and they are deployed automatically in the event of a crash to secure the site and help protect any survivors.",2015-10-08 15:45:50+00:00,cvskt4m,1.0,t3_3nzfx4,97.0,EliteDangerous

Edit: Meanwhile, here's some [clarifying information](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-video-game-that-maps-the-galaxy) about the accurate data &amp; procedurally-generated data used to make up ED's Milky Way:

&gt; Today, Braben has returned to the game of his youth for a sequel, Elite: Dangerous. This time, he used astronomy rather than the Fibonacci sequence to arrange his galaxy. “**I wanted to make the galaxy as accurate as possible so that the results of that exploration would make sense to people**,” Braben said. “In the game, every single star in the real night sky is present, some hundred and fifty thousand of them, and you can visit each one. Even the clouds of stars that make up the Milky Way are included: some four hundred billion stars, their planetary systems, and moons are present, all waiting to be explored.”

&gt; The positions of the stars were drawn from the numerous publically available sky surveys, which Braben and his team at Frontier, the Cambridge-based game developer, collated and merged. They used procedural models based on physics to fill in gaps where data was missing or incomplete. “As you move farther from Earth, the data becomes increasingly sketchy, but the galaxy still runs by the same rules,” Braben said. “**The hundred and fifty thousand star systems are taken from real-world data**. But once you move beyond a few hundred light years we can only see the very brightest stars individually, so we use procedural techniques to augment the data.”

&gt; Floor van Leeuwen helps run the Gaia satellite project, which aims to chart a three-dimensional map of the Milky Way, at the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy. According to van Leeuwen, models of space such as those seen in Elite: Dangerous are crucial to expanding our understanding of the universe. “Computer simulations have played a very important role in astronomy for many decades,” he said. “The kind of problems encountered in astrophysics are almost always well outside what can be represented through simple clean equations.”

&gt; It's Dale's first week, please welcome him to Frontier Developments!

&gt; #####Dale Emasiri, Social Media Community Manager

&gt; #####Welcome to the team, Dale. Are you excited to start working with the Elite Dangerous community?

&gt; Most definitely. My interactions with the community at large, through playing on my own personal account, has been pretty great. Except for that one time when that one person killed me. I wish I could remember the name, because I’m a bit better at the game than when I played some months ago... and I’d like a rematch. 1v1 me bro! ;) I’m also looking forward to meeting the community face-to-face in the future should I be at an event or trade show. This is the best part of Community Management, in my experience.

&gt; #####What will your role be on the team?

&gt; Although I will have some part in all aspects of the CM team’s activities, as we all do here, I will be mainly in charge of Social Media. This means that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and all those funky places we have will be manned for the most part by yours truly. It means I’m on Facebook all day and no-one complains or questions it. Good deal, right? ;)

&gt; In a more serious note, it means that I’m the go-to guy within Frontier whenever it comes to Social Media. I’ll be building the profiles of our social networking presence, and trying to make the interactions/engagements with you (the community) more personal and a heck of a lot more meaningful. Hopefully we can all have a bit of fun with that!

&gt; #####What sort of experience do you bring to the job?

&gt; I’ve worked in the games industry for over five years in one form of ‘relations’ role or another. I started in the industry as a support representative but quickly realised that I was more interested in being part of the gaming community and creating a fun experience for those playing the games I’m working on. This led me squarely into a community role just over four years ago. I’ve been working community-related roles ever since, progressing to the role of Community Manager some years ago, and most recently for the last year and a half I’ve been working as the Social Media Manager at Wargaming Europe. My work over the years has involved so many games across different genres, and in various stages of its lifecycle – from new releases, to older titles with years of history within the community. I bring all of this to Frontier, alongside a beautiful mane of hair, which is sometimes shinier than Ed’s!

&gt; #####Federation, Empire, or Alliance and why?

&gt; Arissa Lavigny-Duval, because I wanted to be Empire. Initially I thought of pledging to Aisling, but she has no combat missions. I love me some combat – despite being pretty mediocre at it! – so I cruised over to Kamadhenu and signed on to a real faction. (Oh man, I’m going to get flaaaaaaaamed for that one.) Clearly it was the right choice, though, because Emperor... ggwp.

&gt; #####What excites/impresses you most about Elite Dangerous?

&gt; The scope. I remember the first time I was shown the Galaxy map and discovered I could scroll up, down, and pan around. It’s so impressively large, and also incredibly pretty. I love combat and this is definitely an excitement, but there’s something thrilling in mapping out a new system. It’s got something for any kind of pace I’m looking for, whether I’m relaxing or wanting to take down some pirates.

&gt; #####Tell the community a fun fact about yourself.

&gt; I have two passports, two legally recognised first names, and have travelled a fair bit. Totally not an international spy.

Yes, roughly 25% of the first post's suggestions, 20% of the second post's.  The second definitely has better &amp; more important points, almost all I agree with.  And as we both agree more of them have been confirmed as incoming (1.5, Horizons).

What we have seen implemented so far is as you concisely summarise: value tweaks, bugs and small improvements, all requested by the community  *Very* few developers I've seen over the years have done that alongside new already-planned major features - whether or not players like them admittedly, opinions are subjective of course (Powerplay doesn't interest me personally, although many players enjoy it).

My point was simply to counter Xaduha's false claim that suggestions ""do not work"" and instead they take time to design &amp; develop :)

6437,"&gt; The assumption was that FDEV wants our feedback, of course.

And they do, and listen to.  Of the *top quality content* (sub search) that you posted, the following are the in the top 10, and over three months old - i.e. potentially enough time to implement (alongside their other planned additions/improvements of course):

* [ranked #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3a1x1r/maybe_the_next_major_patch_needs_to_just_focus_on/) - at a quick skim through it appears 25% of the reasonably upvoted (5+ points) suggestions have been implemented in 1.3 or 1.4.  Including what's planned for 1.5 we're probably looking at 33%.  Even more including the Horizons Season.

* [ranked #9](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/2q3xlv/update_wishlist_everything_that_needs_fixed_or/) - again a quick skim through I'd say 20% has been implemented so far (incl 1.4), and much more is incoming with 1.5 and Horizons.

Unfortunately many of the top suggestion threads have been posted within the last two months, which is an unreasonable timescale to expect a seasoned developer to fit in and implement, when their dev plan is already planned out for a large feature improvement/addition timescale.

The only key suggestion that **many** players wish for (since Gamma last year) that FDev have shown little indication of implementing is Player Heat Maps - which I am, like many others, disappointed about.

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion:**

You now supply some evidence that game developers have been able to implement a similar-ish amount of community-suggested small/large improvements to their in-game features, in approximately a similar timescale. 

I predict you'll find a few dev teams, perhaps less than 10 (out of hundreds currently developing) that have accomplished this.  Up for the challenge?

&gt; I wanted to post up a quick update for tomorrow morning. As you may already know the game servers will be down on all platforms from aproximately 8am and will last for up to 6 hours. While we bring you 1.4, CQC and the full Xbox One launch. 

&gt; If you would like to know more about the transition from Xbox One - Game Preview Program to the full game check out [this thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=187093).

6448,"&gt; ###How to prepare for the 1.4 launch

&gt; In preparation for the v1.4 update, please check the following points to minimise any potential issues:

&gt; * Back up any custom key bindings you may have created. These are located in the following folder on your PC: %localappdata%\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings
&gt; * Please make sure that your router supports UPnP and has it enabled if you plan to play CQC (or Open Play). If UPnP is not supported by your router, please see [here for a workaround](https://support.frontier.co.uk/kb/faq.php?id=33).
&gt; * A launcher update containing several fixes and improvements will be released alongside the update. To ensure you have the latest Elite: Dangerous game launcher, please get the latest launcher from [our store page here](https://www.frontierstore.net/downloadable/customer/products/) and install this before updating the game. The new launcher versions releasing alongside v1.4 should be: **PC v0.4.3497.0, Mac v0.4.3450.0**
&gt; * Check that the launcher is not blocked by your anti virus program or firewall, additionally check if your router has any content filtering options activated, these can interfere with the update process. 
&gt; * Planning to play CQC? Firstly check to see if your NAT type is open for the best matchmaking experience. For details on changing your NAT type, head to our [support article about it here](https://support.frontier.co.uk/kb/faq.php?id=202).

&gt; In general this update will be similar to the previous major patches. The servers will go down, while they are updated, the downloads for the new launcher and game client become available. As soon as both are installed and the servers come back online, everything should be good.

###See [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3nlfc4/scheduled_server_downtime_an_ama_and_a_4_hour/) for information on tomorrow's scheduled server downtime, Ask-Me-Anything and 4 hour Livestream.",2015-10-05 16:56:35+00:00,cvp2g8a,1.0,t3_3nlbvk,1035.0,EliteDangerous

6451,"&gt; ###The Canonn Community Goal

&gt; Polaris.

&gt; For eons, mankind has looked to Polaris for direction. Human history is laden with it’s undeniable influence and lingering myths. Even now the North Star calls out to us from beyond the void, bringing us to our new home. We are the Canonn.

&gt; Astronomers, Historians, Explorers, and Scientists. Brought together by the mysteries surrounding the recently discovered Unknown Artefacts we have become hunters &amp; researchers. Brothers &amp; Sisters. Though our foundation lies in the depths of the unknown and in the vastness of the galaxy, we have chosen a home system for ourselves. Using Polaris as a guide we have chosen to inhabit the closest populated system to our friend, that North Star.

&gt; That system is Varati.

&gt; Nearly halfway between Sol, the cradle of humanity, and Polaris, the ancient guide of ocean borne mariners, there lies Varati. A place of solitude and peace. A place for science. We invite all of humanity to aid in the journey to knowledge and understanding. Come be apart of the wonderful truth as we discover it together, whether you are a member of the Canonn or not. We invite all to participate in something we are calling Operation: Stockpile.

&gt; Doctor Arcanonn says it better than I ever could:

&gt; “We are welding and drilling the place in to submission. The real issue is looming though. We need supplies. I’m not talking about tea and biscuits either, we’ve ‘scienced’ up a way to produce those indefinitely. We need those difficult to find things, things to tinker with and experiment on. So, we are announcing OPERATION STOCKPILE. We can offer more than a dozen of these new, rare, ‘EGX’ style paint jobs for the commanders who can help us the most, along with some other goodies. Back to the mission, these things are our life blood. We need them. Hangar bay doors are open to everyone!”

&gt; We are currently looking to acquire various relics and technologies to begin our research. Unique rewards await those whose efforts shine the brightest. A few prizes will also be given away at random! You do not have to be in our group, we are simply the hosts for this event. For those wishing to partake we ask that you assemble at Bond Hub in the Varati system on October 11th, 3301 at 17:00 galactic time. The event will run in open for four hours and will end at 21:00 galactic time on the same day. Be advised, there are no large landing pads so small or medium craft are a must. For more information on rewards and participation rules please ~~click here~~ see as follows.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; Location: Bond Hub, Varati System

&gt; Time: October 11th at 17:00 to 21:00 server time

&gt; Rules: Event held in Open. Medium &amp; Small landing pads only. Allow a referee to scan your cargo. Points will be given based on certain cargo. Sell cargo on the Bond Hub black market. A referee will re-scan your ship to ensure all cargo sold. Back to hunting!

&gt; Scoring: Collect ?????? ???????? (to be revealed when the CG beings, no cheating by pre-stockpiling!!)

&gt; Questions: Ask the Canonn Council Anything!

&gt; Public Prize bracket:

&gt; * Grand Prize: 1 XL Elite Logo Shirt / 1 FDL Poster / 1 EGX Skin
&gt; * Runner Up: 1 FDL Poster / 1 EGX Skin
&gt; * Third Place: 1 EGX Skin

&gt; While bigger name space sims like Star Citizen still continue to be developed, Frontier Developments has been forging ahead with its massively multiplayer online space sim Elite: Dangerous which allows players to pursue any kind of career they wish in deep space. Whether it’s trade, combat or even piracy, the game’s 1:1 scale and enormous scope presents limitless possibilities. As Elite: Dangerous is poised to release on Xbox One, the development team is just getting started with its epic space adventure.

&gt; GamingBolt had the chance to speak to Gary Richards, producer for Elite: Dangerous on Xbox One, about the game’s debut in the Game Preview program, the upcoming CQC update on Xbox One, how essential the Cloud is and much more.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ""None of the improvements we’ve made would be possible without huge numbers of players joining us in the Game Preview, stressing the servers, pushing the game and providing feedback.""

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *What prompted the decision to bring Elite: Dangerous to the Xbox One?*

&gt; Gary Richards: There’s really nothing quite like Elite Dangerous on console, and we heard requests from console players asking for it. Our in-house engine, COBRA, is the technology behind Zoo Tycoon, Kinectimals and a number of Xbox games which gives us a really solid foundation on Xbox One. Another huge advantage of coming to Xbox One was Microsoft’s nascent Game Preview Program and the chance to launch on the first day of E3 while the game was still in development. We developed in the open on PC and Mac too, and we’ve always found Early Access to be invaluable to development.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *Can you tell us how the Game Preview program has made it possible to bring your game to Xbox One so much earlier [October] than it probably would have before?*

&gt; Gary Richards: Xbox One’s Game Preview Program is really just Early Access for the first time on console. We found players understood it immediately and were excited to play the game before they ordinarily could. Since launch in June anyone who jumped on early will have been able to see the regular progress as the frame rate increased, new features were added and bugs were ironed out. None of the improvements we’ve made would be possible without huge numbers of players joining us in the Game Preview, stressing the servers, pushing the game and providing feedback.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *Can we expect Elite Dangerous to run at 1080p and 30fps on the Xbox One?*

&gt; Gary Richards: Yes, and higher. We hit 1080p30 in the massively multiplayer open galaxy, and 1080p60 in our dedicated PVP mode, Close Quarter Combat.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ""The cloud is essential for Elite Dangerous. The entire galaxy lives on our cloud servers, and it’s those servers that make the game’s unique features possible. ""

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *What is the one technical feature about the Xbox One that you are excited about?*

&gt; Gary Richards: I remember reading tweets before launch saying a console version of Elite Dangerous should be ‘impossible.’ Well, it wasn’t impossible, but squeezing 400 billion star systems and a fully-working, full-sized replica of our Milky Way onto Xbox One was a monumental challenge. That said, for me the greatest achievement was both technical AND creative.

&gt; Elite Dangerous is a deep game with a control scheme designed to make you feel you’re in the cockpit of a real starship in 3301. On PC or Mac those controls can be mapped all over your keyboard or custom flight stick, but on Xbox One we always have the same number of buttons. We worked hard on our new gamepad UI and controls to make it feel natural and responsive. Our team managed to bring Elite Dangerous to Xbox One without cutting any technical corners, AND without cutting any creative corners. That, to me, is exciting.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *Elite Dangerous is a pretty resource intensive game on the PC and obviously the Xbox One is a mid-range PC at best. How do you plan to realize your vision with a fixed hardware such as the Xbox One?*

&gt; Gary Richards: The new generation consoles are actually considerable machines, and development is aided by the set benchmark. PC is always a ‘moving target’ in a sense, but you always know what’s inside an Xbox One. And that means we can keep optimizing with that target in mind. One thing that’s remained consistent is that we’ll never throttle one version of the game to benefit another. We shipped on PC last December and on Mac in May, with the optimizations we made on Mac all fed back into the PC version. The same goes for the Xbox One release. We didn’t cut content or features on PC to make the game work better on Mac and Xbox One; we actually improved the game’s performance, wherever you play.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *Microsoft recently released a 7thCPU core for developers. Are you taking advantage of this latest SDK update for the XB1 version? If yes, how it has helped development?*

&gt; ""Whether you play on PC, Mac or Xbox One EVERYONE is participating in the same galaxy. There’s one story, one economy, one Powerplay state and one galaxy – all living and changing based on player actions on the cloud.""

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *What is your take on DirectX 12? Do you think it will improve games graphics and development on both the PC and Xbox One?*

&gt; Gary Richards: We’re excited about the potential of DirectX 12, for sure. Not much more to say right now.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *A lot has been said about cloud gaming and the impact it can have on Xbox One. What is your take on this? And do you think Elite Dangerous could utilize it in the future?*

&gt; Gary Richards: We already use it. The cloud is essential for Elite Dangerous. The entire galaxy lives on our cloud servers, and it’s those servers that make the game’s unique features possible. It means we have a power struggle spanning countless star systems that every player can participate in. It means wars are won and lost based on player actions. It means players can cooperate towards massive community goals like building star ports or preventing plagues. It means whenever you’re the first person to discover a start system or planet, you’ll forever have your name attached to it as the discoverer. It means we have an economy players can manipulate. And most important of all: it means whether you play on PC, Mac or Xbox One EVERYONE is participating in the same galaxy. There’s one story, one economy, one Powerplay state and one galaxy – all living and changing based on player actions on the cloud.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *How is the CQC mode shaping up on the Xbox One version?*

&gt; Gary Richards: We beta-tested CQC first on Xbox One because we wanted fresh players on the new way to play, without bringing hundreds (and in some cases, thousands) of hours of expertise to the table, but we’ve found players on every platform have taken to CQC in the same way. Wherever you play it’s the same crazy PVP battleground with no up and no down, in these intricate custom-built arenas where threats can come from anywhere. Elite Dangerous 1.4 ships the very same day as Elite Dangerous for Xbox One, so Mac and PC will get CQC at the very same time. We’re going to keep supporting it going forwards, and we hope it becomes a really competitive space. We know the e-sports community doesn’t come for free, so we’re going to be developing it in a measured fashion, and if that community wants us, we’ll be there to support them.

6471,"While I don't have a similar ISP, I can imagine the trouble you could be having with UPNP through such a connection, as any part of their setup could be breaking the port forwarding required by ED.

I would advise speaking to your ISP and:

1. asking for a fixed External IPv4 address.
2. choose a 4-digit random number (e.g. 5164) and ask for said port number to be forwarded through IPv6 to your fixed External IPv4 address.
3. asking for help to configure your router to forward the selected port to a Local IP (e.g. 192.168.0.2).
4. set your computer to use the same Local IP instead of obtaining automatically.

Once done this should give you a stable direct communication port - from your computer to the internet - through which ED can use.  This port can be tested by browsing to: http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/

Then configure ED to use said port instead of UPNP: https://support.frontier.co.uk/kb/faq.php?id=33",2015-10-05 11:19:14+00:00,cvosps5,1.0,t3_3nk4pd,3780.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; So is this demand letter merely a strong-arm tactic to bully The Escapist into retracting the article, or will Cloud Imperium Games actually deliver on their threat and pursue a libel lawsuit? That only leads to further questions. Could a defamation suit like this actually even make it to court? If it did, it’s almost certain that extensive financial documents would be subpoenaed, easily proving or disproving the claims made by these anonymous sources at The Escapist. Would funds obtained by Cloud Imperium Games from their ongoing Star Citizen crowdfunding campaigns be used to finance the lawsuit? Is involvement with GamerGate really fueling any of this, as so many of my comments on my previous article claim?

&gt; All of these questions deserve answers, because we’ve reached a point in this…I can’t think of any word more fitting than scandal…where enthusiastic backers of the game stand to lose faith, development of the game itself is potentially affected, and a press outlet is facing a lawsuit for allegedly doing their job. All sides become impacted by this now, and despite any personal doubts I have about Star Citizen getting completed in any reasonable amount of time, all of these questions warrant further investigation. This has gone too [far] not to get to the bottom of things.

&gt; Our most recent interview with Cloud Imperium Games' Chris Roberts became a two-parter, following an [initial discussion on DirectX 12 and Vulkan APIs](http://www.gamersnexus.net/gg/2114-chris-roberts-star-citizen-on-dx12-vulkan-and-tech). Part two dives deeper into the render pipeline, network and render optimization, zoning, data organization, and other low-level topics relating to Star Citizen. A lot of that content strays from direct Star Citizen discussion, but covers the underlying framework and “behind-the-scenes” development operations.

&gt; Previous encounters with Roberts have seen us discussing the [game's zoning &amp; instancing plans](http://www.gamersnexus.net/gg/1854-chris-roberts-pax-east-instancing-and-zoning) in great depth; since then, the Roberts has brought-up the system numerous times, expressing similar excitement each time. It is clear to us that the zoning and instancing architecture have required a clever approach to problem solving, evidenced to us by a previous pre-interview conversation with the CIG CEO. In a pre-shoot talk, Roberts told us that he “loves engineering problems,” and had considered the instancing system to be one of the larger engineering challenges facing Star Citizen. The topic of instancing was again revisited in this sit-down, though at a lower, more technical level.

&gt; ###Canonical View of the Render Pipeline &amp; Graphics Optimization

&gt; This part of the interview was almost entirely for my own knowledge. We review a lot of hardware – especially graphics hardware – and understanding the underlying software empower our ability to competently test components. Seeing an opportunity to learn (and, ultimately, produce more content), I asked for a canonical view of the render pipeline as it pertains to Star Citizen and CryEngine.

&gt; * “Because it is threaded, essentially stuff gets pushed onto the render thread. So what happens [in] the cumulation of the main thread, render gets called, and render basically – on the main side – starts pushing the objects. In CryEngine they're, called 'render objects.' They get pushed off to the render queue. It gets pushed on with the information about the object, including its location in 3D space, because it's got to be threaded so you can't [depend] on the stuff that's sitting in the main thread. So [the engine] pumps all this stuff onto the render thread, then the main loop goes about doing its stuff again, while the render thread carries on doing its stuff.

6558,"Initial *estimated delivery date* for Star Citizen was November 2014, listed on the Kickstarter.  Once they kept adding stretch goals on CIG website it became obvious this wasn't going to be met.  In May 2013 CIG began stating newer targets that edged into 2015.

All of the missed [target release dates are listed here](http://starcitizen.wikia.com/wiki/Anticipated_Release_Schedule) on the Star Citizen wikia.

Hangar Module:

* Slated for Summer 2013, released end of August 2013 -- ok.
* ""So, when we've got to the point that all the ships are in the engine, and I can do that- it will probably be before the single player game and before the single player alpha comes out- I'm going to let our backers have that app, so they can sit around and look around in their ships, and walk around them"" -- Two years later, a **lot** of the **initial** ships are still missing.

Arena Commander / Dogfighting Module:

* ""in December (2013) people will be able to sort of dogfight and play"" - May 2013
* ""delay the dogfighting module for a couple of months"" - December 2013
* Released 4th June 2014

Delays to Planetside &amp; Persistent Universe obviously continue from the AC delay, yet they still have [missed estimates given in January this year](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/c76652a2e2401ae71b6bf4c603d4cb28/201429752/tE4iXb3.jpg):

* Planetside Beta for Spring 2015 - we only now have alpha of PS/ArcCorp
* FPS Beta for Spring 2015 - delayed
* AC 2.0 Multicrew for Summer 2015 - delayed
* SQ42 for Fall 2015 - delayed
* PU Alpha for End 2015 - delayed, alpha will be Puny-Verse (large world map) instead and build from there.

As [I stated in my post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/3mpj0x/escapist_star_citizen_controversy_reaches_a/cvgzrnq), it would be simpler if CIG stopped announcing release targets as they consistently give us bad estimates.

6560,"I purposely avoided the article's title of ""Eject! Eject! Is Star Citizen Going to Crash and Burn?"" due to its click-baity nature; chose the file-name instead &amp; also added keywords of topics covered.  ""Boiling Point"" is of course in reference to the actions, whether idiotic or wise, of Derek Smart.

I'm perfectly happy waiting for SC's eventual release - likely 2017 at the current rate of development - as there are plenty of great games to play now and planned, Fallout 4 especially.

As to the article itself, and the topic of delays, I feel these two comments sum it up quite well:

* Jason Eurich ""The article is talking about a serious threat to a company that has, for a long time now, been unable to deliver on their promises. These issues could end up being the death of Star Citizen and the author of the article did a good job thoroughly explaining them.""
* Owen Diamond ""They have missed I believe almost every single deadline they ever set for 3 years running right? Wasnt FPS suppose to be out in Spring? Wasnt the original AC/Dogfighting module delayed by like 6 months? Is the FPS module even out YET 6 months later? Where is the PU alpha they said would be up and running 12-18 months after the kickstarter?""

Most recently Chris Roberts stated two months ago that Star Marine's alpha/beta release would be ""weeks away; not months"".  The SM Alpha will likely drop sometime during/after CitizenCon now that they've postponed Jukes and 0G combat (to be added later) which were slowing its development.

CIG's time projections should simply be more realistic, or not stated at all.  Why announce release targets when they are **repeatedly** incorrect?

6621,"Full copy &amp; paste for the advert-spammed:

&gt; It's been a hell of a year for Elite: Dangerous, the space-based, massively-multiplayer title from Frontier Developments, and it doesn't look like things will be slowing down anytime soon. In the months since launch, the studio has published three sizable updates, including the Powerplay Update that went live earlier this summer. A fourth, the upcoming Close Quarters Combat patch, will introduces a new PvP mode that exists entirely separate from the primary Elite: Dangerous experience.

&gt; And a chat with Frontier Developments product manager Ben Dowie, recorded in the studio's PAX Prime booth, suggests there's still plenty more for Elite: Dangerous players to look forward to. The cost may not sit well with some segments of the Elite: Dangerous community. But Dowie, along with Frontier PR and Communications manager Michael Gapper, offered a compelling argument for any fans (or outside observers) still on the fence about Elite Dangerous: Horizons.

&gt; Without a doubt, the most impressive thing I learned during my conversation with Dowie and Gapper was the sheer scale of the Planetary Landings expansion. It's one thing to know Elite: Dangerous will soon let you visit/explore the various planets included in the game. But it was genuinely difficult for me to maintain composure when Dowie revealed Frontier is creating scale models of each celestial body in ED. That means there are billions, maybe even trillions (or more), of square miles of planetary surfaces opening up to the community when Elite Dangerous: Horizons debuts this holiday season.

&gt; The studio takes pride in its realistic approach to science-fiction, right down to its recreation of the Milky Way, which includes all of the stars, planets and other celestial bodies we've already discovered in our home galaxy. Complicated mathematical equations help Frontier fill in the gaps, based on scientific data from around the globe. And the studio is looking to bring that level of detail to every planet in the Milky Way when Planetary Landings debuts. They've even considered the gravitational changes a pilot would encounter, based on the size of the planet, when landing.

&gt; ""We're going to be taking people down to the planet, in real time,"" Dowie told iDigi. ""Eventually, you'll find yourself close and the gravitational pull of the planet will start to shift the flight model. So the feeling of the craft, and how you have to control it, will suddenly start to change.""

&gt; The gravitational changes will also be evident when players are driving their recon vehicles, reminiscent of the Mako from Mass Effect. Of course, gravity won't be the only force affecting your driving. Just as you'd expect, Elite Dangerous: Horizons will feature worlds covered in ice, sand and other such terrain that makes for rough driving conditions. Mountains, valleys and other such geographic changes will also impact travel times. And Dowie says all of these factors will impact the way it feels to drive your rover.

&gt; ""There's a real tangible sense of weight,"" Dowie said. ""You can drive around, get up to about 100 miles per hour, bumping across ravines and feeling the gravity as they float through the air.""

&gt; The new surface recon vehicles won't be the only potential addition to Elite: Dangerous players' fleets this year. New ships are expected to hit Elite: Dangerous before the end of 2015, bringing the total count to 31. And the upcoming addition of new looting/crafting systems will ensure players have plenty of options for modifying their ship(s) to their liking. But Dowie says players shouldn't expect the vessels in Elite Dangerous: Horizons (and/or future expansions) to get much bigger than they are now.

&gt; ""I don't think we're going to end up allowing people to fly capital-ship-scale things,"" Dowie said. ""We want to keep it personal. We want to keep people feeling like they're actually a Commander. Once you get to a ship that scale, it starts to get a little bit more implausible. But we are going to be doing some interesting things in Season Two.""

&gt; Ships may not be getting much bigger but pilots can still expect meaningful changes to be introduced in Elite Dangerous: Horizons. Neither Frontier employee could/would elaborate but the duo did tease the possibility of bringing co-pilots into the equation. When asked whether or not we might finally see extra chairs being filled, either with AI crew members or other Elite: Dangerous players, Gapper smiled and complimented my ""astute observation.""

&gt; ""We're going to make people think about ships in a slightly different way."" Dowie promised.

&gt; Planetary Landings will also incorporate content from Powerplay, including all of the factions introduced in the update, bringing the galactic conflict in Elite: Dangerous down to a global level. Horizons players will be able to take sides in local disputes, between star ports and other such settlements, which may eventually begin to impact surrounding worlds. Over time, these ""local"" engagements could give one faction a foothold in an area where they'd previously been unrepresented. Or you might see a group forced off of a planet and/or completely out of the system.

&gt; Unfortunately, the duo couldn't answer all of my questions. Despite hinting at many of the subjects in our interview, Dowie couldn't offer any sort of information on the specifics of the crafting system coming to Elite: Dangerous or the tougher locales one might discover while exploring. But the studio is confident the four expansions being released as Elite Dangerous: Horizons will justify their $60 price tag.

&gt; ""Planetary Landings is an enormous undertaking. We've had people working on that since Day One. And those poor guys have been sat away in the office...no one knew what they were doing...and they finally got their day,"" Dowie said. ""We just want to give people as much value as possible. That's why we put out the Loyalty Discount. We don't want people to feel like they've been robbed of anything.""

&gt; It's the last bit that's proven to be most contentious, following the Elite Dangerous: Horizons reveal at Gamescom, with some fans expressing disappointment over the news. Those new to Elite: Dangerous will have a relatively inexpensive entry-cost, since Horizons includes all of the content from last year's release. But existing Elite: Dangerous players will need to fork over another $50 for a copy of Horizons, despite already owning a substantial portion of the content. And that's not sitting well with some fans.

&gt; ""Since Day One, when we did the Kickstarter, we always said 'Elite: Dangerous is going to be this' and we're going to commit to paid expansions,"" Dowie told iDigitalTimes. ""What we want to do is give people as much value as possible. So, when we look at sixty dollars, we think the four massive updates we're going to do over the season actually represents enormous value. You just have to look back at this last year, at how much people got, and we're going to be replicating that in this next season.""

&gt; Before Frontier can turn its full attention to Elite Dangerous: Horizons, the studio must finalize the Xbox One port of Elite: Dangerous that's currently only available to Game Preview participants. Last week, CEO David Braben told fans Frontier is hoping to release the completed Xbox One port on Oct. 6, but the executive's wording has some wondering whether or not that date might slip by a few days/weeks. It also leads to renewed questions about cross-platform play and the effects that PC/console players might have on one another.

&gt; Dowie says PC and Xbox players won't ever be flying in the same wing, or even see one another in Elite: Dangerous. But the product manager did confirm every version of Elite: Dangerous and Elite Dangerous: Horizons will share the same universe data. There won't be separate economies for PC and console players, separate servers for those who do/don't own a copy of Horizons, or platform-based forks in the game's narrative. Frontier says events in Elite: Dangerous and Horizons, whether political or economic in nature, will always be reflected on all platforms.

&gt; ""If the story changes, it changes for everyone,"" Dowie said. ""We can't have the Emperor die on the Xbox and be fine on the PC. It's a real galaxy....when we tick over to next year, it will be 3302. And we want this story to keep going for years to come.""

&gt; When asked how they see things growing, Dowie and Gapper offered up a variety of scenarios, many of which hinge on groups of players fighting over the various resources/fortifications available on a given planet. Proxy wars seem like an interesting possibility, as the resources or territory needed for certain tasks eventually put PC and console communities in semi-direct competition with one another. Players from different platforms won't ever be able to solve their problems with combat; however, but Frontier wouldn't mind seeing platforms take opposing sides in faction wars.

&gt; Elite Dangerous: Horizons will also have plenty of non-PvP content, too. All of the new planets can be scanned, for data that can be sold in other systems, if exploring is more your speed. Planetary Landings will also introduce new resources and other valuable items, data and new resources will give scavengers and miners incentive to step outside their ships from time to time.

&gt; ""It's like the different parts of a recipe,"" Dowie said. ""We've got all the different ingredients. It's just finding the right mix to have something that's really exciting.""

&gt; Iain M Norman is constantly tinkering away at something Elite: Dangerous-related. Mostly behind the scenes, Iain is part of the 'local friendly volunteer' community team, and he's the narrator and part-time script editor for the Elite Dangerous fan mockumentary Dockers. 'You should definitely listen to if you’ve ever wondered what the community’s mug obsession is all about. Speaking of mugs I’ve also lent my voice to various adverts on Hutton Orbital Radio, assisting a little with the success of the recent and immensely fun Hutton Mug CG,' says Iain.

&gt; 'I work from home for a small music education website called Gigajam,' Iain explains wryly when explaining why he's got so much time to work on extra-curricular activities. 'I’m very passionate about music, listening to, creating and recording it, and most of my day is spent helping others do the same through Gigajam.' 

&gt; Iain explains that the Elite: Dangerous community fills a gap that comes about from working at home. 'Home working is great for lack of interruptions, and just being able to get on with things, but the flipside of that is it can get lonely. The Elite community fills in that gap, with the forum, and various ED groups on Skype I’ve made many new friends that I talk to every day. It’s great to be able to take a break and have a chat around the virtual water cooler, or spend a lunch break recording some Dockers lines, and generally keep an eye on the forums.

&gt; 'I love the forum. It’s one of the most friendly game forums I’ve ever had the pleasure to be part of. From a moderators point of view it’s easy to sometime see the doltish side of things, and now and then I might have to plead for less hand-baggery, but overall the forum is a great place full of great people.'

&gt; Ultimately, it's the community around the game that keeps Iain coming back, but the game is where it all started. 'I treasure those magical moments that happen inside the game, those moments where I find myself in a completely different place psychologically. I’ll look around my cockpit, look out at the stars, watch a beautiful planet slide past, or weave between the icy rocks of a gas giant’s ring and I’ll think ""Bugger me I’m really in a spaceship!"" for a moment.'

&gt; Iain explains that forum moderation would take up much more of his time if it wasn't for the collaborative efforts of the rest of the team. 'It could be very different, moderating would take up all of the team’s every waking hour if it wasn’t for the back room secret squirreling of fellow moderator and boy genius programmer Andrew Sayers. You might not see him on the forums much but the time he spends building us time saving tools saves us all hours of pain.'

&gt; The recent Hutton Mug community goal caused quite the storm amongst the community, with thousands of you getting involved. Iain had a hand in arranging and supporting those who wanted to help. 'Encouraging people to get involved and engage with community is so rewarding. We never thought over three thousand people would contribute scrap towards Hutton Mugs for example, and it’s great to have played a small part in promoting that and helping people discover the community side of in-game activities.

&gt; Talking of mugs, Iain also has an update for those who got involved and are waiting for the real-life mugs to turn up. 'David Pearson, head plotter and planner of the Hutton Radio Guys has organised a convoy to pick up the first shipment of mugs once the CQC update is released, that’s going to be the 10th of October hopefully, keep an eye out for that.'

&gt; Elite holds an important place for Iain, who has been playing the series since he was 11. 'I was around a BBC-owning friend’s house and he showed me Elite for the first time. Then I co-piloted the Electron version with my best friend from primary school until I was able to play myself when the ZX Spectrum version was released. Ever since then I’ve been obsessed with space games, always looking to relive those formative years. Nostalgia is a very powerful emotion and it’s a mammoth task to try and live up to people’s childhood memories and fantasies, just ask George Lucas, but Elite Dangerous hit the mark for me. The first time I got in a sidewinder in alpha and found myself rolling a target to vertical on the scanner and pulling up to get them under my crosshairs and I was right back in my ‘80s bedroom, 3am in the morning, Elite, and a cup of cocoa.'

FDev certainly need to communicate better and more, especially regarding bugs/flaws that are discovered and progress of resolution - this has been the case since I first joined the forums back in early 2013.  Apart from patch notes information has reduced somewhat, but it didn't start at a high level anyway.

Each beta has been buggy, with relatively little resolved during testing, hence their reason for increasing the beta time - now called Stress Testing involving more players.

The thread you linked to is a good example of the lack of debug data FDev are able to work with, only 77 participants.  Thinking optimistically, all of them will have submitted tickets yet it is still nowhere near enough, considering the scale of the overall playerbase and different configurations (computer specs, network setup, etc) being used.

Thankfully, I think the Xbox GPP has provided FDev with a great base to identify and resolve P2P/UPNP issues, as the console is a constant.  Unfortunately its initial development certainly diverted some of their resources away from PC, as did Mac development as promised by the KS stretch goal.  Horizons is also on a KS promise: ""Planetary Landings around a year after launch"".

However, with the steady revenue from game sales and the three formats being now *deployed*, from now onwards development can be focussed on fixing, improving and adding to what already exists.  Three major updates coming live in 3 months: 1.4 October, 1.5 November, Horizons December.

6655,"&gt; Fast paced shooters are not peer to peer. Shooters like Battlefield run client side hit / server authoritative models where the client sends hit information to the server which simply verifies if the hit was possible or not and sends data to the person who got shot. If Battlefield and CoD and CS:GO can work with a client/server model, there's absolutely no reason that it wouldn't work on a technical level in ED.

CoD uses peer-to-peer.

The launcher should be improved with a UPNP test to ensure the player can connect correctly, before they can click play (for the first time).  The test could be re-run whenever the player wishes if they're having a connectivity issue, and generate a log for support.

Don't most other MMOs have character servers, where-in once you've created your character on one (e.g. UK3) you can't simply login to USA2, without creating a new character?  Connecting to a different continent's server also usually brings a much higher latency, making it close to unplayable.

FDev are attempting (and getting close) to a networking-model that doesn't restrict players with very fast &amp; stable connections from playing together.  As support-tickets come in, the team are identifying bugs/incompatibilities and resolving them.

I still think semi-authoritative servers to augment/reinforce the P2P and main match-making servers would be much welcome, to also help limit cheating/hacking.",2015-09-14 17:27:01+00:00,cv1c6xq,6.0,t1_cv1b3o9,1677.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; Hey guys, 

&gt; As you may have read in this week’s [Dev Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3kelk2/devupdate_for_sept_10_2015/), we are shortly ending the CQC closed beta and moving into stress testing. To support this, and to celebrate the launch of CQC, we’re opening the test servers for all our players and hosting a series of events that we’re calling ‘Mayhem’.

&gt; All of our current players will get access to the test servers next week, with the scheduled events starting on the week beginning September 21st.

&gt; The full program of events will go up on the [community site](https://community.elitedangerous.com/news) next week, giving you enough time to clear your diaries and brush up on your piloting skills.

&gt; For the [official livestreams](https://www.twitch.tv/elitedangerous), hosted by Community Manager Edward Lewis, **we’ll be bringing in special guests from the development team to take on the community** in tense CQC matchups and showcase other aspects of 1.4.

&gt; We’re pulling together a team of the best Elite: Dangerous streamers to add their own flavor to the mix, arranging events and hosting their own streams throughout the Mayhem period. 

&gt; If you’d like to help us out through streaming or other promotion, please email community@frontier.co.uk with the subject heading ‘Mayhem’ and we’ll be sure to add you to the program. We’re looking for events that are going to get lots of commanders involved, hitting up those test servers to give them a thorough run through.

&gt; Hello Elite Dangerous Community,

&gt; I am representing The Code to make an official response to the situation in that occurred in Alpha Centuari, Hutton Orbital.

&gt; We are aware, from your feedback, that you were discontent toward how we executed our blockade not for the reason that you believe in the invalidity of piracy, but our method. 

&gt; Let's start with appropriate warnings. Many of you reflected the issue that insufficient warning was provided before you were fired upon, and we do have case studies of a few that posted in our complaint forum (which are compensated in Cr). We admit that there are interactions that were ill handled and insufficient reaction time, and treatment were given, leading to the impression of ""The Code is griefing."" 

&gt; We formally apologize for those cases, our principle stipulates that we open communication and provide sufficient reaction time for pilots to respond to the situation. We do not tolerate nor endorse opening fire without any communication with the exception of those that fire upon us first, or have previous conflicts with us that were not resolved (player group wars, etc). 

&gt; Our formal procedure includes that we request our target to stop after interdiction, if the target attempts to flee, open fire on us, or stall/unresponsive, we will make use of lethal force to varying degrees based on the situation and member discretion. Any pilot that feel ill-treated are free to file a complaint against us (provided that Cmdr name(s) are provided).

&gt; Another point I would like to address that I read from the community is station pad blocking. This is an absolute mistake on our part. Pad blocking is not endorsed nor tolerated. We formally apologize to the inconvenience we caused by pad blocking, but please understand that some of our members legitimately went away from keyboard due to various reasons. We understand this doesn't excuse the behavior, but I would like to clarify on the behalf of some members who wish to convey their reasoning. Due to our vague stipulation on pad blocking before and during the Community Goal, we will not pursue the matter further internally, but will consider it a serious offense against the code and we encourage people to report any of our members behaving in such way.

&gt; Additionally, many questioned our Role Play reasons for committing to our blockade. 

&gt; Our initial intention is that we believe the CG is illegitimate due to it contradicting FD's post about how it should not happen in a system that already has rare goods. Then we further reasoned that its distance and potential duo rare goods will make it difficult for us to pirate considering its distance from our home, which is the Lave cluster.

&gt; The situation with the Camera Man developed from the initial hostage situation found here. We provided sufficient time and reasonable demand in that situation. Further more, more situations involving Camera Man include that we allow the Camera Man to record as long as he remains neutral. Unfortunately, said individual began badmouthing us in an unreasonable manner, which led to our engagement with the Camera Man. As a side note, the Smiling Dog Crew is not a part of The Code. Any future joint operation with any other player group will base on their compliance and compromise to our principles and methods.

&gt; Lastly there were accusation of hacking against one of our members. We take cheating and combat logging very seriously and has a zero tolerance policy in that regard. If we catch any of our member cheating, we will immediately terminate said individual from the organization. I cannot name the individual who made the joke in the stream questionable due to the rule in the FD forum about naming and shaming. The original quote is ""no one mind if I activate my speed hack, right?"" And ""I'm going 4000 C."" We concluded that this individual is indeed joking and has shown interest in submitting a request to FD support to deliver server data to prove said individual's innocence. Anyone interested in contacting the said individual personally to confirm the story is more than welcome to Private Message me for the name.

&gt; In conclusion, we would like to emphasize we have no interest nor tolerance for griefing, cheating, nor exploiting announced exploits to harm any pilots. Evidently, there are things that went wrong during this Community Goal, and we apologize for those mistakes. We intend to uphold our principle and continue to carry out potential interventions in the future with tighter integrity and alignment to our principle. This includes strict upholding of engagement procedures and announcing our presence prior to our operations with sufficient reaction time.

&gt; I will reply to any further concerns you might have regarding our announcement and general questions about The Code. 

&gt; Please keep in mind that we do care about our reputation and care about our relationship with the community, therefore please do not utilize this thread as an opportunity to insult myself nor The Code.

&gt; We welcome your criticisms and feedback, but insults do not help anyone nor are they productive to this conversation.

&gt; Thank you for your patience and understanding.

&gt; Sincerely,

&gt; Gluttony Fang

6724,"Instance sizes simply need to be larger, and the matchmaking server needs improvements.  The gameplay I've enjoyed myself, and watched (via streams), over the last few days have shown that the networking can support larger instance sizes.  Hopefully this will happen, alongside coding upgrades to the matchmaking server to limit large groups occupying instances (40% max?).

Wings simply give an advantage (i.e. playing the matchmaking server) to those who intelligently use them, as you correctly put:

&gt; forming a wing gives you more control over keeping your allies in the same instance whereas all those decked out Anacondas hunting outlaws were spread out.

So as you correctly surmise, the pirates were outsmarting the hunters by using well known in-game mechanics.  Oh.

Meanwhile...

&gt; Sure it can be said they should organise, but to be honest that's just making an excuse for the game.

It appears that you're saying traders *shouldn't* have to organise breaking through a pirates/terrorists *organised* blockade of a port/station.

&gt; In short, instead of releasing Horizons, I wish Frontier would release ""Wings, a second attempt.""

No.  The issues with matchmaking/instancing are not a result of Wings, so a Wings v2 will have no effect.

&gt; I wish they would get instancing right so that you don't have one instance of two and another that's full.

I personally have no qualms with insta-attackers, Open is supposed to be Dangerous after all.  TBH I enjoy difficult games anyway, Solo to me is ""easy mode"".

David Braben is the [majority shareholder with 53% of shares](https://www.frontier.co.uk/investor_relations/shares/), therefore the obligations of FDev are primarily to him, and his dream has always been Elite.

&gt; I'm just saying that the the focus is growth, not creating the best possible space-sim that they can.

Which aren't mutually exclusive, contrary to your statement; and the latter part is logically incorrect.

ED has provided FDev with 84% of their 2014-2015 revenue, and with Planet Coaster in development for Q4 2016 (over a year away), the ONLY option for the company is to continue creating the best possible space-sim that they can.

By David Braben's design/vision, FDev's growth is now irrevocably tied to Elite Dangerous: sales of ED core (until xmas 2015), Horizons, Lifetime Passes, future Seasons, in-game extras (skins etc), and merchandise.  They have to ensure the game's continual improvement and success, else they're simply willing the company to become unprofitable and fold.",2015-09-08 10:45:31+00:00,cuuaqm7,4.0,t1_cuuaf9o,1374.0,EliteDangerous

The full quote:

&gt; Looking ahead I see a multi-franchise game developer / publisher with its games being distributed on the most modern and best hardware platforms, achieving sustainable returns for our shareholders. Activision Blizzard Inc and Electronic Arts are good exemplars as to where we are heading.

Definition of *Exemplars*:

&gt; a person or thing serving as a typical example or excellent model.

In this context, those companies are exemplars of the former sentence ""multi-franchise game developer / publisher... etc"".

And it's worth noting that a large proportion (majority?) of FDev's external shareholders will *only* have heard of Activision/Blizzard, EA, Ubisoft etc, as it's very unlikely they'll be gamers - except for the ED fan shareholders - so mentioning a dev/pub house like CD Projekt Red wouldn't have the same communication.",2015-09-08 10:08:33+00:00,cuua8u9,2.0,t1_cuua1zw,889.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; ###Operational Highlights
 
&gt; * Strategic step: The first stage of transition was successfully completed as Elite Dangerous launched. At the end of August 2015 it had sold 825,000 paid units (excluding free 'demo' units) and generated 84% of Group revenues via a self-publishing business model including associated merchandise.
&gt; * Self-publishing contributed significantly to record revenues, up 139% to £22.8 million, a cash increase of £2.1 million to £10.5 million, EBITDA up 1,730% to £6.1 million and an adjusted operating profit up 171% to £2.5 million whilst still in transition.
&gt; * The Group expanded the reach of Elite Dangerous through subsequent releases on Mac and Xbox One platforms in addition to PC, and via the Steam and Xbox Live distribution channel in addition to the Group's own online store. The Group's COBRA technology facilitated the significant technological and logistical achievement of simultaneous multi-platform and multi-channel releases whilst players all share the same server environment.
&gt; * All remaining work-for-hire projects were completed, as Tales from Deep Space with Amazon and ScreamRide with Microsoft released.
&gt; * The organisation was restructured for fully self-published operations by centralising development in the Group's Cambridge headquarters and changing the staffing mix via targeted recruitment and redundancy at a cost of £0.3 million.
&gt; * The Group started the development of its second self-published franchise, Planet Coaster, which was also publicly announced.

&gt; ###Trading Update
 
&gt; * Up to 31 August 2015 the Group had sold approximately 825,000 units of Elite Dangerous. At the Gamescom show it announced Elite Dangerous: Horizons, a new paid-for season of expansions for the game, to a positive critical reception. Net cash balances at 31 August were approximately £10.7 million.
&gt; * An early video of Frontier's second franchise Planet Coaster was shown for the first time at E3's inaugural PC Gaming Show. The game is set to be publicly released in Q4 of 2016 and is available now on a pre-order basis. 

&gt; ###David Braben, Chief Executive of Frontier Developments, said:
 
&gt; ""This has been a great year for us, and the first part of our transition has been successfully completed. The process of the beta and then release of Elite Dangerous went very smoothly and the regular delivery of new elements for the game has helped build an ever-growing fan base.

While I prefer the Battlefield series over the CoDs, SC definitely won't have as much content until closer to release:

* very little progression - can only earn credits to temporarily rent flyable ships

* **very** imbalanced *classes* - certain weapons very over/under powered
* less players per battle - only 16, BF has 64

&gt; ###Greetings commanders,

&gt; Many of you have been asking us how long the Lifetime Expansion Pass will be available on sale for and we can confirm that the lifetime expansion pass will no longer be on sale from the 14th September 2015.

&gt; In light of the really amazing response we've seen to the announcement of Elite Dangerous: Horizons we thought we'd run a competition until the Lifetime Expansion Pass is no longer available.

&gt; Then, imagine our delight when this week's Peek of the Week dropped into our laps from the dev team and it was an in-game look at a planet surface! So we thought, let's run the competition to see who can identify which planet this is taken from. The winner will win the chance to name their very own planet!

&gt; All you have to do is take a [look at the image here](http://i.imgur.com/B6XTOho.jpg), see what clues you can gleam from it, and then take a guess by [replying to the forum thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=178311) with the following details...

&gt; * Planet name:
&gt; * System name:

&gt; You may have up to 3 guesses. Any more will not be included. The first person to give us the correct answer will win or, more likely, the closest person to the planet will win if no one has guessed the actual planet.

&gt; Terms and conditions are at the bottom, only [reply to the forum thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=178311) with an answer and include the planet and system in your answer. Best of luck!

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###Terms and Conditions

&gt; * Entrants must post on the forum thread to be considered in the competition.
&gt; * Anyone can enter up to 3 times. Any additional entries will be discounted.
&gt; * Entries should include the planet name and the system it is located in.
&gt; * Winners will be contacted through a private message to their forum account. They will have 48 hours to reply or another winner will be selected.
&gt; * TIP: You can make the forums email you when you receive a private message there.
&gt; * Planets and their location will be selected by Frontier Developments.
&gt; * Frontier retain the right to all copyright and content.
&gt; * Frontier reserve the right to veto or adjust the winners name suggestion both at launch and any time in the future.
&gt; * Frontier staff are not allowed to participate and are not allowed to be involved in any competition entries.

If you have a spare 20 minutes to test, may I recommend the following steps:

1. Update your router's firmware to the latest (if you haven't already).
2. Do a factory reset - should always be done after a firmware update.
3. Resetup your router as normal.

6991,"Have a copy &amp; paste - I'll add more as they appear:

&gt; #####There is talk of 'Freedom Fighter' roles. How will this affect a groups ability to 'carve out' a place in the bubble?

&gt; It could be used to counter a power’s emergence, but this is not planned in the near future

&gt; #####Once a group ascends to Power status...how will the group be treated...as a controlled entity by the founders of that group....or will the group be added to PP and be a PP Power, and basically become a Community 'owned' asset?

&gt; It’s added to powerplay and operates in the same fashion as the other powers. 

&gt; #####Can you discuss or lay out how player stories are expected to work? What CG's are available to the groups? What the frequency of CG's insertion would be for groups? Should they be used as modes of moving the story...or as culminating activities to a series of group actions, activities, reports?

&gt; GalNet stories are submitted in the usual fashion. CGs have to be approved, we’ll look at providing more detailed guidelines in the future, but the main issue would be using CGs to directly boost a minor faction’s influence or for doing things that could otherwise be done through the background sim. They can be used for story purposes, or as a call to arms or to develop a system.

&gt; The details on submitting a CG are on the main thread, linked to from the first post

&gt; As an example...a BGS Civil War breaks out. The group thinks a refugee exodus should occur based on the outcome of the war. They fight the war, get their outcome, the exodus occurs. Do we expect the exodus to be a quick report in Galnet (maybe with some RP by the group to move consumer items to a different system) or would this warrant a Trade CG within the new system to exemplify the movement of people and goods to that system (and could a CG be injected quickly enough to retain it's relevance to the story)?

&gt; It could work either way. How quickly a CG can be added depends on a number of factors and would be dealt with on a case by case basis.

&gt; #####If a group is already backing a minor faction, will it be possible to have that factions name changed to what the group chooses, or will every group get a fresh minor faction to build up?

&gt; If it’s already backing a minor faction then the minor faction remains as is, if they want a new name then they need a new minor faction.

&gt; #####If we choose a minor faction, would we be able to say who they where hostile / friendly / neutral / have a non aggregation pact ect.. with them?

&gt; Not specifically except by agreement with other player groups.

&gt; #####Can our faction be apolitical where we are friendly with all main powers, as a apolitical / non-political groups like the FGE and the Fuel rats or do we have to be hostile to one or more of the main powers?

&gt; That’s up to player group and any arrangements they make with other groups. The superpower alignment defines how they will be treated by the superpowers, minor factions can be independent, but that does not guarantee safety from the superpowers or powers.

&gt; I imagine there will be really interesting player led political affiliations and develpoments

&gt; #####How does adopting an existing minor faction work. Will you fill out the same details but the whole minor faction will change into your groups minor faction name and details? Or will it just show as you’re supporting them?

&gt; The minor faction details would not change, it would just be recorded that they have been adopted by a player group.

&gt; #####How is that going to happen? One day you release a server update and *poof* two dozen systems suddenly have a different owner that popped out of nowhere?

&gt; The minor factions would be added in batches through a server update as they are processed.

&gt; #####Due to the nature of the galaxy will the new minor factions be seen on both Xbox and PC/mac. The EDC has a very diverse group of members on different platforms who want to work together.

&gt; The minor factions are the same for all platforms.

&gt; #####Is there a limit to the name in terms of size and words. I take it calling the faction Elite Dangerous is a bit silly as would be Facebook group. Is EDC or FBEDC allowed?

&gt; The abbreviations shown in the examples would be fine, using Elite Dangerous wouldn’t.

&gt; #####Can we declare our minor faction as independent and neutral to all of the PP factions? We want to be the Switzerland of Elite and let everyone be apart of our minor faction and not keep getting enemy status on every passing ship.

&gt; You can declare it, but you would need to enforce it.

&gt; #####Is it okay if we don't have a faction leader at all? Would be important to communist factions.

&gt; Having no leader at all is perfectly fine. 

&gt; #####If our request are refused by developers, will we be warned and will we be able to adjust our proposal to be compliant ?

&gt; Within reason yes, but it isn’t a debate and our decision will be final.

SC: 100 star systems are planned for launch (from what we've seen 1 is ready).  Travel between systems is via Jump Gates, ala EVE and the X series.  Travel within systems will mostly be done via Quantum Jumps: a very quick and seamless (network permitting) 'boost', yet restricted to arrive at each star/planet/moon's focal point - i.e. a CIG-set location where all arriving pilots will converge.  While free unrestricted travel around planets and systems is possible using normal engines (~500km/s) this would prove unfeasible (days/weeks/months realtime).

ED: 400,000,000,000 star systems free to explore unrestricted, minus ~10,000 that are blocked off (via permits), and you can land anywhere on planets/moons with stations and points of interest to visit on each.  All are scientifically and mathematically accurate with size, mass, rotation, orbit trajectory, etc, based on current Astrological data - the stars match the constellations we can see (for real) from Earth, and can be visited.  Around 10,000 star systems are NPC populated in-game, with around 100 that are player hotspots.  Travel between systems can be done wherever you like using a Hyperjump, fuel permitting.  Travel within systems is done via a faster-that-light drive, allowing you to fly towards, around, orbit and pass stars, planets and moons in quick time (assuming the system in question isn't huge).

#####Trading

SC &amp; ED: Full background simulation.  Players' trading of commodities affects the economy.  Crafting options and loot available.

#####Instances

SC: targeting 100 max.  Instances are tied to Systems (100 ships/players max), Ships &amp; Stations (100 players max each).  A player can traverse one instance to another seamlessly (network permitting).  Benefits: upto 100 ships in combat (network permitting).  Limitations: upto 100 ships spread throughout a whole star system.  Note: gameplay currently lags when 8+ players are involved in arena combat.

ED: currently 32 max, no higher target mentioned so far.  Instances are tied to players and merge when players are close to each other.  Benefits: a star system could have thousands of ships spread throughout, each combined in upto 32 player instances.  Limitations: upto 32 ships in combat (network permitting).  Note: videos of 20+ players fighting/flying together are available.

#####Groups &amp; Comms:

SC: Planned.

ED: Currently limited to 4 (called Wings).  Large groups (i.e. Guilds) are planned and in development, and can be affiliated with NPC factions.  Voice chat ship-to-ship and within Wings.  Multiple text channels available including Wing and Station - group soon to be added.",2015-08-26 02:16:28+00:00,cuftjyx,2.0,t1_cufqhco,5358.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; #####Hey all!

&gt; As you may know we've been looking at how we can allow player groups the ability to establish their own Minor Faction in game. This is something we're super excited about and we’re now ready to accept applications for your own Minor Faction.

&gt; We've updated the main thread, but because it's not as visible I wanted to highlight it in a new stickie. In addition I wanted to invite you to ask questions and we will periodically answer them and update the first post for all to see.

&gt; Please note: The first set of questions won't be reviewed until tomorrow. I considered putting this live tomorrow morning but I was just too darn excited! I figured everyone could get their questions in now and we could go through the most common ones in the morning. 

&gt; Here's a copy of how you can establish your own minor faction.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###Establishing a Minor Faction

&gt; We’re now accepting submissions for groups to establish their own minor faction in game.

&gt; In order to apply for one you need to be registered on our groups list. To find out if we have your group registered check this thread.

&gt; If you have registered your group simply email groups@elitedangerous.com with the following information.

&gt; * Name of group:
&gt; * Name of minor faction:
&gt; * Type: (e.g Democracy, Criminal etc)
&gt; * Description:
&gt; * Location:
&gt; * Allegiance:

&gt; For those of you who have already adopted a minor faction we are allowing a month’s grace period from this post to register. After this we would ask that you register a new one.

&gt; All minor factions will be checked by the Dev team to make sure they are suitable to be added into the game and existing adopted minor factions will also be checked and a decision will be made over legitimacy of ownership.

&gt; Dev team decisions will be final and you will only be able to have 1 official minor faction.

&gt; Eventually, this will lead on to the possibility of your faction becoming a power and so it’s really important that you grow and develop your faction ready for when that opportunity becomes available.

&gt; Please do remember that frontier retain all copyright for Elite Dangerous.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###FAQ

&gt; Here's a list of questions we've answered previously...

&gt; #####Q: Is it okay if we use someone from the current lore as our Faction Leader, or does the Leader have to be made up entirely?

&gt; A: Sadly not, it’s best for the leader to be a new character.

&gt; #####Q: Where can we setup shop system wise, can we inhabit a system outside of the current Inhabited Human Space and colonize planets and become a power that way? Would there be repercussions for doing so? 

&gt; A: It needs to be an inhabited system already. That could be one far out, but that would make it very difficult to expand as expansion requires the system to be populated. We would advise picking a system within the bubble.

&gt; #####Q: Would we be able to claim a controlling/major station if we were to house ourselves in an NPC occupied system? If not, would we start at an outpost?

&gt; A: As long as there isn’t a player sponsored group in that system already then you will be the controlling faction for that system.

&gt; #####Q: Would we be able to form allegiances with active Major Factions as protection until we grow to a significant point? Likewise, could we resist a Major Faction the same way Lugh was able to fend off the Federation?

&gt; A: They can be part of one of the three superpowers, or independent. This would work in the same way minor factions do now.

&gt; #####Q: Will Minor Factions/ Powers have alternate methods of expansion than the current Top 10 Powers? Say, Anarchists spreading through cop-killing, Democrats via elections, etc.

&gt; A: The mechanisms will be the same as the current powers.

&gt; #####Q: Will Minor Factions be able to create their own Modules? If so, what can we base our ideas on and what are we limited by?

&gt; A: Ideally yes – we would look for suggestions and then balance them.

&gt; #####Q: Will Player Submitted Galnets look Similar or different when compared to the standing Powers and the current lore of the game? If so, can we have something to tell the difference between the current Player-Submitted stuff and the real Lore of this game?

&gt; A: All player submitted stories have the commander name at the bottom.

&gt; #####Hello Commanders!

&gt; Two pieces of news:

&gt; A fix will be landing for next cycle (this Thursday) for an issue that prevented powers from spending all of their CC for preparation when they had just recovered from deficit the cycle before. Several powers have suffered from this bug recently, notably Torval, Winters and Aisling.

&gt; Secondly, there’s an issue that prevents conflict zones from being generated unless there’s a planetary body in a system. This causes systems with populations but no planets to get a messed up and never allow such activities to succeed. I believe Archon has had a fairly rum do with this issue, though in fairness, this is also a problem for minor factions engaging in war outside of Powerplay.

&gt; Although the ultimate aim will be to allow conflict zones to be generated around other astronomical entities, this fix won’t be up and running for some time (month +).

&gt; Three of these systems are control systems and a few dozen are currently being exploited. We’re considering our options as to how to deal with these systems; it might be that we have to remove them from Powerplay in the short term so we’re looking at the impact and ways to soften the transition. 

&gt; We’ll let you folk know when we reach a decision; this is just a heads up that we will likely be implementing something at the cycle change next week.

7065,"With the large amount of queries you've put it's probably best I section my responses too:

#####General

1. Firstly, one big Galaxy without instances simply won't happen - this isn't EVE with time-dilation slowdown stuff.  Meanwhile, do you see others CMDRs in hotspot areas like Leesti?  If not then you've got a UPNP networking issue at your end.  I can help you resolve it if you want :)
2. Players controlling space/stations will not happen according to FDev, again this isn't EVE.  Instead plans are for players to align to NPC Minor Factions that do the controlling of stations.
3. Multicrew is planned for a future expansion season.
4. Apart from searching through Galnet posts you're correct here.  Lore isn't easy to find - like an in-game Elitopedia.
5. Each Station base model - and especially Outpost - have many interchangable modules, giving multiple different stations.  The assets from CQC will be brought into the main Galaxy, and hopefully we'll also see further modular Stations/Outposts brought in too.
6. Space is really big, it's fair to assume sensors need to be *focussed* in the appropriate direction, as they have to relay information at many times the speed of light.
7. Agreed.
8. There will be - comets, rogue asteroids, satellites, pirate outposts are all planned.
9. Supercruise (moved it here as its more appropriate) is necessary for travel.  Again: space is big.  You get slowed due to the approaching gravity well affecting the FSDs ability to warp space around your ship.  The trailers show only a short distance being travelled anyway.

#####A.I.

1. The AI demoness has already been working on this issue, so it should arrive in a future update, alongside much more difficult AI at higher ranks.
2. Nav Beacons will have their *reason* ~~brought into~~ expanded in the game soon™.

Overall I'm happy with the progress that has been made, although I'd like improvements/additions/etc to added quicker of course :)",2015-08-24 14:31:05+00:00,cudwmgt,1.0,t3_3i7ak3,2027.0,EliteDangerous

7076,"&gt; GTX 980 Classified (stock clock)

The Classified ACX2.0 is a vendor (EVGA) pre-overclocked GeForce, running at 1291MHz GPU, 7010MHz RAM: http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=04G-P4-3988-KR

&gt; If I run OBS, multiple OBS plugins and stream the game - I may crash one time in a 3-4 hour period.... Why is the game more stable then, than just running it on it's own?

This bit of info is the clue.  GeForce 900-series cards with Boost have a [known issue, that causes sporadic TDR errors when the GPU is underused](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/784294/boost-feature-causes-gtx-970-980-instability-in-low-utilisation-situations/), thereby minimising game(s) while the TDR *does its job* (a very bad job I might add).  970s &amp; 980s at Nvidia's recommended stock clocks don't have this issue.

When OBS is running alongside ED, the GPU will very rarely reach low-utilisation - therefore Boost can't screw it up with a TDR.

The Nvidia stock clocks for your 980 are 1126MHz GPU and 7000MHz RAM - try underclocking using an app like MSI's Afterburner.  Perhaps try even lower clocks to see if the ED-minimising issue disappears.  While losing a couple FPS isn't ideal, at least you'll have an answer to report to FDev in a support ticket.

Alternatively, contact EVGA support (your GPU will still be in warranty) for the up-to-date BIOS/firmware for your graphics card, including appropriate instructions on how to apply said update.  There are [BIOS versions listed here](https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/165092/evga-gtx980-4096-140930.html), but I can't know for certain which is correct for your card, without its Subsystem ID.",2015-08-23 20:40:26+00:00,cud5dlo,1.0,t3_3i46gh,1461.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; The main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.

&gt; Really big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to £80 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.",2015-08-22 13:30:02+00:00,cubri8u,3.0,t1_cubrap2,580.0,EliteDangerous

Your OP isn't discussing ED's pricing or it's gameplay, you're comparing it to SC with a favourable opinion to the latter, which it's worth noting: **Star Citizen doesn't exist yet**.

&gt; The realism and UI in Star Citizen is phenomenal, not to mention the dogfighting mechanics

SC's only become playable since the recent flight mechanics update, which is bringing it closer to ED's already established flight mechanics.  Before then SC was a point-your-mouse-and-click turret shooter, not a space ship combat game.  Enough gameplay stats showed that HOTAS &amp; joystick players were worse off to K&amp;M: ""the realistic space ship controller of the future everyone is a keyboard and mouse"" :/

&gt; Star Citizen seems to include everything, no DLC, no payed-for add-ons

When it's released (2017+) SC will no doubt be great, but why wait over 15 months to play a great space sim?  And don't forget SC is funded by very-close-to-pay-to-win mechanics of buy-a-ship and upon release pay-for-credits.  In case you've forgotten, **pay-to-win games are bad**.

And in SC currently you can only dogfight, shoot NPCs like duckhunt or race around the same track.  Not much of a game that *includes everything*.

&gt; I don't think I can swing $60 every year for new features

It's a good job many gamers backed ED &amp; SC on your behalf then, otherwise the space-sim/combat resurgence wouldn't be happening.  They paid a lot more, years ago with barely a sniff at content and only promises to hope for.

&gt; Hello Commanders,

&gt; Welcome to a brand new weekly blog in which we will shine some light on recently completed and upcoming community goals.

&gt; After the excitement of saving the galaxy from the terrible Cerberus plague we gave the community a little time to relax this week with a single, simple trading goal in the Apalar system. The Apalar Labour minor faction put forward a plan to transform their Industrial economy into a thriving High Tech Hub. Over 1,500 Commanders came to their aid, providing thousands of tonnes of polymers, semiconductors and superconductors. The community made short work of the task, completing it on Sunday the 16th. As reward for their efforts Apalar Labour announced a 30% discount on all technology commodities for a two week period. This discount began on the 18th and will run until early September.

&gt; The Apalar goal was interesting as we decided to provide special rewards for the top 5 commanders. This isn’t something we plan to do for every community goal, most of the time the normal top X% structure works well. Occasionally however, it is interesting to add some extra competition into the mix.

&gt; Without further ado the top 5 Commanders were: 

&gt; 1. CMDR Vinnyph
&gt; 2. CMDR Leo Sagan
&gt; 3. CMDR Drorelith
&gt; 4. CMDR DeathMagnet
&gt; 5. CMDR Alexbrentnall

&gt; This week we are back with a bang, with three interesting and difficult goals, all linked by a single faction, Emperor’s Dawn. These goals in the Dinkas, Kamcha and Jang Di systems all require players to provide different goods. One of them requires a supply of illegal Battle Weapons, another the rare Ceremonial Heike Tea. The final goal requires players to locate and supply Toxic Waste, which is both difficult to find and even more perilous to transport. Each of these three goals are twists on the normal trade goal and we are really excited to see the ingenious ways in which the community will meet these challenges.

&gt; If you are looking for the goals this week the breakdown below should help guide you:

&gt; * Jang Di – Sikorsky Orbital – Deliver Ceremonial Heike Tea to the commodity market
&gt; * Kamcha – Saarinen Station – Deliver Battle Weapons to the black market
&gt; * Dinkas – Blaauw Port – Deliver Toxic Waste to the black market

&gt; That’s all for this week, we will be back next week with new goals.

7101,"He'll have a different local IP to you now already, automatically given by your router's integrated DHCP server.

My previous post about fixing your local IP's is basically setting ""no router, I don't want you to choose my local IP, I want this one instead"".

Your router is given a WAN IP (e.g. 86.75.48.34) by your ISP - therefore both your computer &amp; your friend's appear to the Internet (and Frontier's matchmaking servers) to have the same WAN IP.  You can test this by simply visiting www.whatismyip.com on both computers.

Enabling guest network will isolate your friend's computer from yours (technically a separate VLAN), but he will still have the same WAN IP as you.

My thoughts are that as UPNP allocates ports to DHCP-enabled computers, and you both are using the same WAN IP (i.e. your router), then:

1. ED's servers are having difficulty separating you both, due to the switching UPNP ports your router's doing.
2. I've read about many father &amp; son players (on here &amp; in forums) who play from home together (same WAN IP) so I don't think what you're encountering is an FDev issue *exactly*.
3. Therefore I conclude it's a fault with your router's UPNP implementation - i.e. it's doing a rubbish job.  A firmware update may rectify this; it could be a known bug with your router.
4. Fixing your local IPs, and setting up port forwarding to your computers, would bypass your router's UPNP and *potentially* fix the issue.  Each of the computers would have set ports, allowing ED's matchmaking servers to ""maintain a lock on them"".

The only way your friend could use your router (and internet connection) **and** have a different WAN IP would be to use a VPN service - which would no doubt bring further port problems.

Note 1: all multiplayer games use ports to communicate to other computers, before UPNP existed us old-schoolers had to port forward manually for all games we were being server on.

Note 2: ED's UPNP implementation is rather unique, hence the trouble it has had since Alpha.  The situation is improving however, as FDev update and improve ED's UPNP code, and CMDRs replace duff routers with ones that do UPNP properly.",2015-08-19 22:24:54+00:00,cu8tbp5,5.0,t1_cu8sd5k,1553.0,EliteDangerous

* Default Gateway = your router's local IP, e.g. 192.168.0.1
* IP address = an unused local IP, e.g. you 192.168.0.51 and your friend 192.168.0.52
* Subnet mask = same as your router's subnet mask, e.g. 255.255.255.0

7117,"Copy &amp; paste:

&gt; Just popping in to clarify armour/bulkheads/etc, it seems there's still a lot of confusion on this point! Probably the best way is to illustrate it with an example - note that the numbers are pulled out of the air, I'm writing from home and don't have access to the real ones, nor can I check if I'm allowed to post em ;)

&gt; Assume a default ship has a 100hp hull with the default armour (also called bulkheads, interchangeable name) taking 80% damage from thermal and 120% damage from kinetic. Upgrading to the Reinforced or Military versions will increase the hp of the ship, something like x2 for the top end (giving a 200hp hull) - but do not affect the damage reduction. Mirrored and Reactive versions will both increase the hp and shift the damage type resistance (mirrored is better vs thermal but worse vs kinetic, Reactive is the opposite). Those damage reduction values do apply to hits to modules as well (as illustrated in the OP) but as these don't change between lightweight/military hulls, the only direct damage reduction comes from mirrored/reactive. What the armour does affect is the penetration chance as the ship gets damaged.

&gt; Hull reinforcements behave in a similar way to reinforced/military armour - increasing the hp, so the military armoured ship with two +10% hull reinforcements would have 220hp.

&gt; So what exactly does this mean for penetration/damage to modules? When the hull is at full health there is no difference what armour/hull re-inforcements you have fitted. As the ship becomes damaged there are some differences though. Take the following two ships:

&gt; 1. Default: 100hp
&gt; 2. Well geared (Military + hull reinforcements): 220hp

&gt; Assume they've both been hit for 50 hull damage so far this fight. And are now being shot by a normal weapon:

&gt; 1. Default: hull at 50/100 health, penetration chance: 60%
&gt; 2. Well Geared: hull at 170/220 health, penetration chance: 49%

&gt; Further down the fight, they've both taken 95 hull damage and are again shot normally:

&gt; 1. Default: hull at 5/100 health, penetration chance: 78%
&gt; 2. Well Geared: hull at 125/220 health, penetration chance: 58%

&gt; So.. Better armour does affect module damage, but not in the way people often expect! It's something we're looking at as part of the loot/crafting update Michael mentioned in a recent dev update (along with several other combat balance issues), until then we've bigger fish to fry ;)

&gt; There's several conflicting goals we're trying to juggle: To start with the question of randomised vs deterministic penetration - which is a highly subjective thing and from our investigation so far it tends to feel better for the attacker if deterministic, but better for the defender if it's slightly random.

&gt; We also agree that changing armour should have a bigger effect on the damage your ship and modules take, but even the best armour should never protect them enough to make targeting modules a useless strategy. Not to say we're out of ideas, just nothing I want to commit to here :)",2015-08-16 14:56:11+00:00,cu4vel2,1.0,t3_3h7d86,84.0,EliteDangerous

7138,"C&amp;P:

&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; The team is back from the Gamescom and it’s good to see so many new players giving the game a try. Naturally it was also exciting to tease what’s coming in Elite Dangerous: Horizons with the first release for that being landing on airless planets and moons. We do have the CQC (1.4) release before then so that is the focus for this week’s dev update.

&gt; We’re currently aiming to start the PC/Mac beta within the next couple of weeks, there’s a few things we need to finalise before that happens and we’ll let you know when that’s firmed up. As we’ve already announced we are aiming for a simultaneous release for both the CQC update and Xbox One retail release. To support this how we approach the betas is changing slightly. For the beta period we will focus on stability and major fixes rather than try to tweak everything in one go – this provides a path to a more stable 1.4 release. Throughout the beta period we’ll compile less severe feedback as well and see what needs to be included in a future minor release. The aim here is to avoid the flurry of minor releases after a major release.

&gt; As with any major update this will be built from our latest trunk which means that it will sweep up a host of fixes and tweaks that weren’t in the minor releases as well as the extra features and content we’ve already disclosed. The full list of changes will be posted in the change log as always, but here are some of the highlights:

&gt; There have been a range of network optimisations as well as some functionality issues such as islands not merging correctly coming out of supercruise. Some connection issues have also been resolved.

&gt; If the refinery is idle and has material in its hopper then it will try and allocate the materials to the bins.

&gt; We’ve added an option to the graphics option so you can disable the shader cache warming on start up.

&gt; There’s a change of changes for NPCs including fixing fighters not spawning from capital ships. Pirates will no longer scan a target if they’ve pirated it. Some other causes for unnecessary NPC chatter identified and removed – the variation on chatter has been increased as well. NPCs can now interdict other NPCs while in supercruise. NPC police responses have been rebalanced so you shouldn’t only get low value ships responding to crimes.

&gt; For Mac players wanting to know why Elite Dangerous Horizons is delayed beyond the PC release it’s down to a single issue, for the new planet rendering we make extensive use of compute shaders to maintain good performance. Currently compute shaders aren’t supported in the OSX version of OpenGL. 

&gt; And to conclude this week’s update, Oculus are about to release of SDK 0.7 for the Oculus Rift which removes the ability to roll back to 0.5, so we wanted to make you all aware of some important information.

&gt; Players using Oculus Dev Kits should continue to use the 0.5. Oculus Runtime for Elite: Dangerous. Upgrading to the upcoming 0.7 release will not be compatible with our game

&gt; As long-time supporters of VR and early adopters of Oculus, we remain in close communication with them as they work towards a production version of their SDK, but want to be open that without that SDK in hand, we cannot guarantee future compatibility.

&gt; We will keep you posted.

&gt; My average day starts at 7am with a trip to the gym, a love of food and lack of exercise doesn’t mix well!

&gt; When arriving at work I have a range of daily responsibilities starting with contacting customers directly to managing the support team, analysing our top support issues and resolving them with the development team and working to improve our support levels to every last player.

&gt; #####What aspect of the game have you worked on that you are most proud of?

&gt; Since joining in February, the support team and myself have done lots of things outside of the game to be proud, of including:

&gt; * Turn around response time problems with support tickets

&gt; * Improve our quality of service to help support your issues better (e.g. losing your ship)

&gt; * Introducing the customer satisfaction surveys

&gt; * Introducing bug reporting on the forums and separating the support issues from the bug reports

&gt; #####What's your favourite thing about Elite: Dangerous?

&gt; The scope of exploration. CQC is pretty fun too, minus the fact that the team are far better than me.

&gt; #####What was the biggest challenge you came up against during game development?

&gt; Personally, my biggest challenge has been to build a bigger, stronger, effective support team that can stay on top of your issues, be vigilant on any new problems that crop up and ensuring our supportive development teams can provide you with the fixes you need.

&gt; Since joining, the support team now have 10 new members of staff. We record your problems and get fixes developed for them. We have eyes and ears on the forums, Reddit and social media to help ensure we can help out with any issue you have, every day of the week. 

&gt; #####What have you learned from working on Elite: Dangerous?

&gt; Docking looks far easier than it is.

&gt; #####Tell the community a fun fact about yourself

&gt; Despite growing up with cats and being a cat person, I nowhave possibly the cutest shiba puppy that became internet famous for 48 hours.

Sure as it was more streamlined gameplay on park management.  But it was also easier for newcomers &amp; children to play, who fondly remember it (11 years ago it came out).  And it definitely had better coaster designing &amp; flexibility.  The expansions were good too, adding things not done in park games before.  Publisher Atari will have influenced the design decisions too (good or bad); Hasbro and Infogrames published 1 &amp; 2 respectively.  It's all on FDev now for Planet Coaster (abbr PC).

&gt; Also, with the release of Rollercoaster Tycoon around the corner

It's not in a state to be called alpha yet.  [RCTW is now on it's third developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_World#Development): first lot 'walked away', second lot were sacked by Atari after [releasing their trailer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-06-puke-rollercoaster-tycoon-world-looks)).  They switched game engine a few months back, and have released a few screenshots only.  The only thing going for it is promised Steamworks support, which Frontier are hopefully considering too.

&gt; and the lackluster communication about Planet Coaster, a lot of people don't know that Planet Coaster even exists.

PC was only announced at E3, and expected to arrive mid-late 2016, information will arrive in due time.  [Quite a few people already do know about it](https://youtu.be/ivAHFCHmIZo), and there's no rush to build hype until early/mid 2016 :)

&gt; but the odds aren't really stacked in Frontier's favor.

I'd actually say the reverse.  The gaming community lost trust in Atari after the [terrible RCT4 Mobile](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-18-rollercoaster-tycoon-4-mobile-review), know that the company is ""investors only, no gamers/developers"" and have switched their attention to PC, as seen in the comments on both games' trailer videos.

&gt; ###The founder of Frontier Development *talks* video games yesterday, today and tomorrow. And his relationship with *his* children and space.

&gt; During the recent Gamescom 2015 in Cologne, we had the pleasure to chat with David Braben, mythological figure of the game, father of the Elite series, and especially one with very clear ideas in terms of space.

&gt; #####David, what is the space for you?

&gt; ""I've always loved watching the sky, your gaze to the stars and feel that feeling of wonder one feels *when* watching. I find it a very introspective work to do on myself, because observing the sky understand *helps us see* how small we are. The space for me is imagination. ""

&gt; #####So *you* often look at the sky, perhaps with a telescope?

&gt; ""I do it often because I find it very funny. Also *I* learn the name of the heavenly bodies and identify them, it always helps to give you that feeling of wonder and immensity *I* was telling you about. The same feeling I've always tried to play in the Elite series, as in the new Elite: Dangerous "".

&gt; #####By the way, in the Elite series *you* have always tried to give the player the concept of infinity: Consider Dangerous, the new chapter, a further step towards the infinite gaming, or to another concept, perhaps more limited but detailed?

&gt; ""I think Elite: Dangerous is a step towards full understanding of how big the galaxy *is*.

&gt; After all, the beauty *is in* we have four hundred billion stars in the game. See, playing Dangerous is just like looking at the sky, as I explained earlier. To say, what you can see from the ground, in Elite: Dangerous there, and there is much, much more. It's a game *that's* very realistic, and it's crazy to think about how realistically immense *the* galaxy *is*. ""

&gt; #####Why did you wait so long to do a new Elite? After all we are talking about over twenty years (the previous Frontier: First Encounters, dates back to 1995)

&gt; ""Since 1995 I've done so many other games, but in fact Dangerous is the first space *game/epic* in a long, long time. Well, the truth is that there was no publisher willing to bet on a new Elite "".

&gt; #####Are you serious? We speak of a series beloved among players ...

&gt; ""Obviously, the publisher knew and appreciated the series, but did not believe that a space game open world could succeed. Too large, too long-lived, with no points or lives ... they were missing too many of the trappings of the games in which they were accustomed. Although it was a new Elite "".

&gt; #####And then you have to bet *on* crowdfunding ...

&gt; ""Yeah, Kickstarter, in 2012. It was the winning move, because we gave in the players' hands the future of Elite. And, because they knew how much they loved the series, here Elite: Dangerous has collected the funds necessary for the development. ""

&gt; #####From the first Elite *to* Dangerous ~~to~~ have passed thirty years: how it has changed the gaming industry in this period, in your opinion?

&gt; ""It's changed a lot. Every single game, thirty years ago, it was a challenge. Because there were new platforms, new devices, new programming techniques to implement. Now, however, diversification is smaller and more uniform development systems. However, I think the biggest change has been the digital market. Thanks to it we can point directly to the public. We can do exactly the games we want to do. First, however, we had to be accountable for our choices to publishers. It is a process quite similar to that of music, where the indie band depopulated without the need for record companies behind "".

&gt; #####And in this period, *has* David Braben ~~has~~ changed?

&gt; ""~~It's~~ *He's* become older and has white hair,"" he laughs. ""I changed a lot of things, but I consider myself a lucky person and I'm very grateful for that. And then I have a great team in ~~the~~ Frontier, ~~are~~ *am* married and have children. And I watch the games in a different way, and this process has led me to create, among other things, the project Raspberry PI"".

&gt; #####Having children has changed your way of developing games?

&gt; ""It changed the way I think about video games. First I thought about how different types of people would play ~~for~~ my titles. Now I think about how everybody gets them *to* play. ""

&gt; #####~~Programs yet~~ *Programming still*, or *do* you dedicate yourself to the design and management?

&gt; ""At the moment we plan more, but I miss ~~him~~ *it* very much.""

&gt; #####What would you think of a space game entirely procedurally generated (the reference is in No Man's Sky , he captures and smiles mischievously).

&gt; ""I'll tell you the truth: the rules are fine. Without missing *out* the game rules. The concept is that ~~the~~ procedural generation is a tool for the artists, not the solution to every problem. If you give in a player's hand only a procedurally generated *game*, you will fail. Take for example ~~the~~ spray paint "".

&gt; #####That's *used* for graffiti?

&gt; ""Exactly. The spray creates a fantasy procedural, but it is the hand of the artist to make a work itself. There is nothing wrong with having a random pattern, provided there is a rule that just lets us understand. The real question to ask is: where's the game? ""

&gt; #####Are you developing other games, as well as Elite: Dangerous? (Dangerous was released in December 2014, but Frontier regularly releases updates)

&gt; ""Of course, Planet Coaster, which incorporates elements of our Rollercoaster Tycoon *games* and pushing the AI ​​even further, to create an amusement park *more* realistic than ever. It will be released in 2016 "".",2015-08-11 14:34:24+00:00,ctz5wjz,1.0,t3_3glhbe,227.0,EliteDangerous

I suspect it's UPNP implementation is poor, causing the issue you're having: disconnects during high player activity; the router's crashing trying to route all the UPNP requests from different CMDRs.

You have three options at this moment:

* [Contact ActionTek](http://www.actiontec.com/217.html) informing them of your problems with UPNP and request the latest firmware &amp; instructions to update it.
* [Follow these instructions](https://support.frontier.co.uk/kb/faq.php?id=33) to setup port-forwarding in ED &amp; your router.  Note this may still not fully work, depending on your router's ability to port forward correctly.
* Replace your router with a better supported brand/model.  TP Link (I use them) offer great value products, while Netgear, D-Link &amp; Linksys offer pricier quality products.  Ensure your replacement router is compatible with your ISP (i.e. contact them) before buying.  As your current router supports multiple WAN types I can't determine which you're using.

I think you've misunderstood the FSD mechanics in ED.

Supercruise is in the same plane as a station/planet, using a warping effect around your ship - like the (incomplete) theories behind [Alcubierre drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive) - and is fully controllable, i.e. you can change direction and speed whenever you want.  This is used for in-system travel between stars, planets, asteroid fields, stations etc.  There isn't a loading screen, but merely graphical effects when entering/exiting Supercruise.  There is a brief pause in Open play while the matchmaking server resolves the instance (if other CMDRs are nearby).  In Solo play (and Open if out exploring) it's practically instant, less than a second.  So just like SC's in-system travel &amp; Eve's Hyperjump's appearance by the sounds of it.

Meanwhile the Frameshift Jump to travel between Star Systems, to another system's primary Star, uses the FSD to push your ship into Witch Space (alternate dimension, i.e. Hyperspace).

&gt; #####Release Date &amp; Prices

&gt; * The price of Horizons and what package you are eligible for can be seen by looking at this handy [flowchart](http://i.imgur.com/BI0Wzno.jpg).

&gt; #####Basic Information

&gt; * Horizons is a 'season' expansion to the original Elite: Dangerous release.
&gt; * A season can be seen as roughly 8-12 months long.
&gt; * The price includes the content you will get when you purchase Horizons, plus all other content released in the Horizons season.
&gt; * *Beta access has previously been a couple of weeks to a month in length. At present there is no confirmation if and when a Horizons Beta might be available.*

&gt; #####Planetary Information

&gt; * Trying to land on a planet without Horizons or the correct equipment will result in an emergency drop.
&gt; * All scenery is procedurally generated. No tiling of structures. The artists 'scultp' the code to avoid there being unlikely scenery that would look really out of place.
&gt; * *The Earth's Moon (along with other planets/moons) will be permit-locked*

&gt; #####Installations &amp; Discoveries &amp; Missions

&gt; * There has been talk by Ed Symons (Elite Producer) of 'hacking' been an option to bring down a surface stations shields. Not confirmed, just discussed between the team.
&gt; * Missions will be connected between star ports and the planets.
&gt; * There are different designs of bases on planets. Large ones will have landing pads, smaller outposts may be more orientated around missions.
&gt; * *There will be lots of things [hidden beneath the surface](http://www.gamesradar.com/elite-dangerous-horizons-will-let-you-land-planets/) of the planets.*
&gt; * *[This Guardian article](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/07/elite-dangerouss-planetary-landings-touches-down) also mentions ""shipyards""*


&gt; #####Surface Reconnaissance Vehicle (SRV)

&gt; * *The basic [Scarab has 6 wheels](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/07/elite-dangerouss-planetary-landings-touches-down)*
&gt; * *[David Braben is quoted](http://www.gamesradar.com/elite-dangerous-horizons-will-let-you-land-planets/) as saying, ""With time there will be [more SRV's] in the same way that there are different kinds of ships, one [that] folds up so you can carry it.""*
&gt; * The initial SRV (Scarab) will be able to carry 4-6 tonnes or 'units' of cargo.
&gt; * Entering your buggy will be a 'fade to black' transition scene. No Spacelegs™ at this time.
&gt; * Driving the SRV far enough away from your ship will cause your ship to take off and enter a low orbit supercruise of the planet or moon. This will be AI controlled 'for now' and would make the ship impossible to hunt down. *It disables all unnecessary modules to reduce its heat signature to practically zero, thereby preventing detection*.
&gt; * Requesting that your ship returns to the planet will result in it flying to your location on the surface.
&gt; * Your ship will appear on your SRV radar if you are close enough to it. 
&gt; * When you die on the planet you will return to your ship.
&gt; * *Controls for the buggy will be re-mappable as you can do for your flying your ship.*

&gt; #####Planetary Defences

&gt; * Debate in-house on on what happens to ships when you leave them and drive about planet - not decided whether someone else can destroy or just damage it. Note: This seems to be at odds with another statement that the ship will simply take off and fly around the planet in a low orbit supercruise. Speculation: It *might* be referring to what happens to your ship if you are landed at a moon base and the base is destroyed.

&gt; #####Future Horizons Updates

&gt; * Over the full season of Horizons more ships being released. (NOTE: This might be confused and in fact relate to the 1.5 update bringing more ships) This update would be in addition to SRV's which are due to be added in the Horizons season.
&gt; * The Unidentified Artefact will be woven into the narrative of the Horizons season. Confirmed again on the 9th August Twitch stream that there is an answer to what it is about and it is not a wild goose chase.
&gt; * Ed Symons said there is something else he is working on that he is more excited about than planetary landings, but that obviously he can't talk about it. It would appear there's still plenty of surprises within the Horizons season.
&gt; * *The reason for the cockpit panel between your pilot's legs will be revealed sometime during Horizons.*


&gt; #####Core Game Improvements

&gt; * Core missions are being enhanced for the basic game. This will move beyond basic A&gt;B structure and will include 'new interactions' and multiple staged missions. (Source: Sandro [here](http://www.twitch.tv/elitedangerous/v/10011323) at 1hr 35 mins onwards). Further confirmation on the 9th August Twitch stream that there would be chained missions.
&gt; * There has been discussion at FDev about player built structures, but that is no guarantee they will be in the game at some point.

Haha no worries, this whole thread is full of them and it's been great (so far) :)

&gt; Should an extra bit of content in the same game really be as expensive as the game itself.

Horizons isn't though: it's £30/$45 compared to ED's original £45/$60.  Whether it has all the feature/content update worth the price is yet to be seen.  Will the whole season of updates/expansions be worth double the price of traditional expansions?  We've yet to find out.

On the ship-buying and credit-buying (on full release) mechanics, isn't that perilously close to being pay-to-win though?  There'll always be bigger fish of course, but not *day one*.  There's a real risk of powerful players dominating space(s) and restricting/ruining the gameplay of starter players.

We'll *hopefully* be seeing those issues *fixed* though:

* Shield cells limited to one module per ship; the refinery is already limited to one per ship so the code is there already.  Fingers crossed FDev have listened to the sense on this.
* Bringing back weapon variants.
* Introducing explosives that damage shields, e.g. EMP missiles and bombs
* Bringing in more and easier to locate focal points (warzones etc) for CMDRs to congregate at.  Many of us want a player-heat-map filter for the Galaxy map that will also help locating large amounts of CMDR activity.",2015-08-09 14:02:48+00:00,ctwv7dj,14.0,t1_ctwnmhh,27958.0,EliteDangerous
7268,"&gt; I just find it an ugly prospect that in the end when both ED and SC cross the same mark, one will cost well over 200 dollars while the other has it all in its core game for around 60 dollars (45 if you hop onboard now).

That's true for all games with expansions though.  I can now buy [Civ5 Complete Edition for £35](http://store.steampowered.com/app/8930/), while I bought Civ5, G+K, BNW all on their respective release dates for considerably more.  Vanilla Civ5 is lacking in features compared to Civ4.  Am I annoyed that players who buy it all now get it cheaper?  No, prices drop over time.

At Star Citizen's full release sometime in 2017 (by the looks of things), potential buyers can compare what they get in SC, ED and NMS, for the prices *at that point*.  Until then it's daft saying ""SC doesn't charge for stuff but ED does"" when SC isn't yet out (only arena combat &amp; racing are playable, and laggy).

And remember for SC, players on day one will have powerful ships that they've pre-ordered, and credits will be available to buy for real money.  We don't yet know how that will play out for newcomers or minimum backers.",2015-08-09 13:51:50+00:00,ctwuyay,7.0,t1_ctwub5f,1742.0,EliteDangerous

Note that the ships in ED - even the Sidewinder - are huge compared to the Viper (BSG) and Starfury (B5).  You also see many times in both TV series those ships used - tactically I might add - as literally mobile turrets, flying in a single direction and (FA off) shooting at their target.

The top-speed limitation was brought in because of how during alpha/beta 1on1 skirmishes resulted in the chasing CMDR being at a major disadvantage to the fleeing-Newtonian-backwards-and-turreting CMDR.  This is scientifically accurate, but simply isn't fun.

On a side note, the flight model of the Condor (due to it's tiny size I guess) appears to be very zippy.  Looking forward to trying one out.

&gt; looking at those stream in/out seamless jumps makes me wish elite had more of this type of gameplay too.

It's seamless in ED Solo play too, transitioning to and from SuperCruise and exiting Hyperjump; it's the delays caused by the matchmaking server in Open that jars the experience, which as the tech improves will get smaller &amp; smaller.  Playing in a small Private Group is also very close to seamless.  The SC Multi-Crew demo was effectively a Private Group (12 players, 6 vs 6 was it?) so no requirement for a matchmaking-server-esque setup, until us Citizens start to play in the PU.",2015-08-09 13:35:11+00:00,ctwukpe,10.0,t1_ctwqhkc,16111.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; Where's the epic - dynamic space battles I could just randomly happen upon when trading to a new station?

&gt; Where's the social hubs where I can chill with other commanders

Has no interest to me, but I can see why others do, social hubs seem commonplace in MMORPGs so I guess they're frequented by players a lot.

I get how early buyers will pay more for games compared to later buyer.  I do think selling the expansion seasons separately to the core game is the better way forward.

After the first year of Horizons, it's easier for FDev from a backend point to manage the different types of player-account and what they have access to:

We’re working with Oculus to try and resolve this and will let you know when there is news on that. In the meantime we will continue to support the previous SDK release and will be including some specific fixes during the beta, for example making sure that the Powerplay map renders correctly to both eyes.

Seeing as Oculus were involved maybe they found something seriously broken with 0.6 that 0.7 resolves?  0.7 does after all include Direct Driver Mode:

&gt; Rather than inserting VR functionality between the OS and the graphics driver, headset awareness is added directly to the driver. As a result, Direct Driver Mode avoids many of the latency challenges of Extended Mode and also significantly reduces the number of conflicts between the Oculus SDK and third party applications.

&gt; Here's the information we have so far on the Horizons expansion, plus a few other bits of information about 1.4 and 1.5 updates.

&gt; #####Release Date

&gt; * Release date *of Horizons* will be somewhere around or between Thanksgiving/Christmas 2015.
&gt; * *1.4 in September*
&gt; * *1.5 before Horizons*


&gt; #####Planetary Information

&gt; * Trailer for Horizons can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4sAe16UTDg).
&gt; * Landing will be on airless planets and moons.
&gt; * Four planet and moon types in the release to land on: Ice, Rock, Rock and Ice, and Metallic.
&gt; * Some current moons and planets will change in appearance due to new information added via the Stellar Forge (which is responsible for generating the Elite Dangerous universe). This injection of data already exists on the system but is not currently in the game. You can watch a David Braben TedTalk on procedural generation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEVutbSqBI0)
&gt; * Game play extends seamlessly from space to the surface - taken from [Dev Update](https://community.elitedangerous.com/node/248).
&gt; * Planetary Landing will follow process: Orbital Cruise (like Supercruise) -&gt; choose anywhere (surface allowing) to land on the planet/moon -&gt; Deploy SRV (Surface Reconnaissance Vehicle) The basic vehicle is known as the Scarab.
&gt; * While flying above the surface in Orbital Cruise you can discover points of interest like landed ships and surface installations.
&gt; * Ships will handle re-entry in different ways. Smaller ships will be easier to handle in orbital supercruise than larger ones.
&gt; * You can't land on every airless moon/planet - some are closed off and require a permit. Any other in the universe is available.

&gt; #####Installations &amp; Discoveries

&gt; * Scanning planets and moons from space is used to detect signals, crashed ships, mineral deposits, outposts and fortresses. This information will be found in the same fashion as current Unidentified Signal Sources in space - taken from [Dev Update](https://community.elitedangerous.com/node/248) and Twitch on 7th August.
&gt; * You will be able to dock and trade at these outposts and fortresses, or you can just choose to land in the middle of nowhere and drive about using your SRV.
&gt; * Planets will also have rare minerals, pirate bases, crashed ships. You can fly and dogfight over the entire planet once you've descended to it.
&gt; * Settlements on certain planets/moons will be fortified. These can be attacked from the air or defended from the ground.


&gt; #####Surface Reconnaissance Vehicle (SRV)

&gt; * GIF of the basic Scarab SRV can be seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/Pdb6u6n.gifv) (thanks to /u/ArmyDude956 on Reddit)
&gt; * SRV's will take up module/compartment space and you will have to buy the ""module"" to transport the SRV in the cargo hold.
&gt; * Nearly all ships can carry an SRV, but not every ship can carry every SRV. Different SRV's for different tasks with with some cross over like ships.
&gt; * One ship (currently not in game) will not be able to carry an SRV. Speculation: Planet &amp; Moon bases/fortifications could have ground based defence craft. One of these might be one of the small ships seen in CQC and would not be able to carry a buggy.
&gt; * Gravity will affect SRV's differently depending on the planet.
&gt; * It will cost to buy an SRV as per normal equipment.
&gt; * The initial SRV (Scarab) will be able to carry 4-6 tonnes of 'cargo'.
&gt; * Top SRV speeds will be about 100mph.
&gt; * The SRV will not need to be re-fuelled.
&gt; * The SRV will carry a weapon(s) that can be used to attack bases on the planet.
&gt; * The different planet surfaces will all give you a different handling experience in the SRV.
&gt; * Driving the SRV far enough away from your ship will cause your ship to take off and orbit the planet. This will be AI controlled 'for now'. Presumably you will call for it to land when required. 
&gt; * Returning to your ship has been described as ""interesting"", the hint being that you can thrust/jump into your ships cargo bay as it is landing/taking off/thrusting above the surface of the planet.
&gt; * Thrusters on each wheel will allow you to jump. On low gravity planets, jets will rotate round and force you on to floor for traction - to stop you floating away.
&gt; * Thrusters will also allow you to get out of situation where you might get stuck. Self destruction is also an option.
&gt; * SRVs are very small, and difficult to track by flying spacecraft, and enable you to tackle some of the fortifications you’ll find planetside in a different way from what you can do in a spaceship.
&gt; * It will be possible to blow up another player's SRV using your ship, but due to lack of heat signatures and the very small size and agility of the SRV, this will be hard to pull off.


&gt; #####Planetary Defences

&gt; * Some 'surface skimmer' AI vehicles/drones will be remote controlled from a base on the planet. These will be 'almost land based' vehicles.
&gt; * 'Skimmers' will come in more than one variety.
&gt; * 'Skimmers' can be knocked out by destroying the control base, shooting them, or by destroying the 'relay towers' that exist on the planets surface. These towers give the 'skimmers' better range. Speculation: At the moment these are AI controlled, but it might be possible for players to fly these 'skimmers' from the base of a moon or planet.
&gt; * It's been suggested that 'Skimmers' can be destroyed, collected in your SRV and then sold on the black market.
&gt; * Debate inhouse on on what happens to ships when you leave them and drive about planet - not decided whether someone else can destroy or just damage it.
&gt; * Wings can be used on the planet surface in co-operation. Other co-operative play can be used to destroy bases defences. For instance it might be necessary to destroy a bases defences in a certain order before it can be taken over or destroyed.
&gt; * Cobra Mk IV - Photo [HERE](https://twitter.com/vloetlicht/status/629047150303932416) access available to buy in-game for all early backers, plus anyone who has the original game and pre-orders Horizons. The new ship is apparently 'better in lots of ways, better weapons placement and 1 more hard point.


&gt; #####Future Horizons Updates

&gt; * Loot and crafting will be a Q1 2016 update to Horizons. (Speculation: loot has been spoken about before in terms of leaving stolen goods stashed on a planet or you to return to or others to find.)
&gt; * Future planets updates in the Horizons season will include 'active volcanism' and 'ice volcanism'. At some point (before fully rendered 'atmospheric planets with life' there will be ones with weather systems.
&gt; * Most if not all content mentioned is already in game. No footage available as yet as textures have not been applied. This should be seen Soon! (tm)


&gt; #####Core Game Improvements

&gt; * Core missions are being enhanced for the basic game. This will move beyond basic A&gt;B structure and will include 'new interactions' and multiple staged missions. (Source: Sandro [here](http://www.twitch.tv/elitedangerous/v/10011323) at 1hr 35 mins onwards)


&gt; #####CQC Update News

&gt; * CQC (1.4) will be out on PC and Mac in September. PC version will follow 'one day after XBox release (fingers crossed, hopefully)'. Will be lots of other new tweaks.
&gt; * CQC will feature 3 new ships:

&gt; 1. Variation of the (Imperial) Eagle: more expensive and better in combat. 
&gt; 2. [Federal Gunship](http://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/Federal_Gunship): 'Look on the underneath at the back, a big area with an opening - not sure what it might be used for'. (Quote &amp; Tease: Elite Producer on Twitch)
&gt; 3. Federal Dropship Mk II

&gt; * CQC assets - ""Absolutely"" will be used in main game.


&gt; #####1.5 Update News

&gt; * One more free expansion tentatively called 'Ships' (1.5). This will increase the number of ships from 20 to over 30.
&gt; * Release dates: 1.4 *in September*, and 1.5 *before Horizons which itself* will be a Thanksgiving/Christmas release date.
&gt; * Atmospheric landings on planets with life will NOT be part of this Horizons release. That will come later in another paid expansion *season*.",2015-08-08 15:28:04+00:00,ctvykuq,1.0,t3_3g8zxu,842.0,EliteDangerous

To play now you need to buy ED @ $45 from either Frontier directly (and generate a Steam key if you wish) or Steam.  Horizons can then be pre-ordered for $45 from Frontier's store page, which will be playable mid-December-ish

&gt; Hello, Commanders

&gt; This morning we’re announcing Elite Dangerous: Horizons – another full season of major gameplay expansions for Elite Dangerous, beginning later this year with ‘Planetary Landings’.

&gt; I’ve been fascinated by the exploration of space since I was young, and especially with the almost unimaginable scales involved. Going down to the surfaces of planets was a key part of my dreams of exploration, and soon we'll realise that dream in Elite Dangerous.

&gt; We're beginning with airless, rocky worlds – places where a great deal of new gameplay can take place. These are planet-sized sandbox environments, with all sorts of things to discover hidden on them. You'll find surface starports, crashed ships, mineral deposits, hidden bases and more. 

&gt; These worlds are gigantic, and - like the open galaxy - you'll be able to go anywhere. You'll be able to fly over the surface in low orbit and choose your spot to land, you'll be able to venture out in your Surface Recon Vehicle and hurtle across the surface at high speed. You'll be able to sneak around or go in all guns blazing. The nimble SRV is tiny compared to your ship, and is virtually invisible on a long range scanner – ship-based weapons will find it very hard to hold a lock on them, but airborne and ground-based players can explore the same worlds together, so watch the skies!

&gt; As I’ve said already, I’ve wanted to do surface landings in Elite Dangerous for quite a while now – and we have been planning how best to do it since the Kickstarter. Elite Dangerous: Horizons is the first stage and a huge step. The quality people expect is, as always, very high, and the team have done a great job hitting that benchmark. These worlds will feel real and meaningfully unique.

&gt; You’ll read about some of the exciting things you’ll find on surfaces this week in the press and on our Community blog, but Planetary Landings is just the start. Elite Dangerous: Horizons is a full season of content extending into 2016, introducing new features and gameplay in each major expansion. As with Season One, this season of expansions is not just about planet surfaces, but other major features are coming too.

&gt; Of course support will continue for Elite Dangerous even outside of Elite Dangerous: Horizons, and we’re keeping the community together. All Elite Dangerous and Elite Dangerous: Horizons players will share the same galaxy together and you’ll retain all your progress whenever you choose to join our new season of expansions.

&gt; Elite Dangerous: Horizons will be available to pre-order on our store today, and I’m very happy to announce all existing Elite Dangerous players will receive a 25 percent loyalty discount off the Horizons retail price. Existing players will also unlock the exclusive Cobra Mk IV ship in Elite Dangerous: Horizons. The Cobra Mk IV will be available in the game only to players who joined us in the first year – forever. It’s our ‘thank you’ for your faith in the game, and you’ll see more of the Cobra Mk IV in Friday’s Peek Of The Week.

&gt; Due to popular demand, we’ve also decided to bring back for a limited time the lifetime expansion pass. It should appear in our store later today.

&gt; We’re committed to seeing Elite Dangerous grow the right way, and we hope you’ll join us planetside as we embark upon the exploration of our galaxy’s undiscovered worlds together. We have a great team, and I believe Elite Dangerous: Horizons will bring players closer than ever to the dream of touching other worlds.

&gt; There will be lots of questions, I know! Elite Dangerous’ Lead Designer Sandro Sammarco and I will be taking your questions in this afternoon’s livestream at 16:00 CEST, so please visit twitch.tv/elitedangerous for that. 

&gt; The Community team will do their best to answer your questions about the ongoing evolution of Elite Dangerous on our forums, and tune in to our Twitch stream throughout the week for more on Elite Dangerous for Xbox One, Elite Dangerous 1.4: CQC for PC and Mac, and Elite Dangerous: Horizons.

&gt; Thank you for playing, and Right On, Commander!

&gt; If there wasn't already a terrifying amount of world in Elite Dangerous, well, wave goodbye to that small sliver of your social life not spent in a cockpit. The first part of the space sim's second season of expansions will let you fly seamlessly to the the surface of planets and land. 

&gt; Planets can be surface scanned to find interesting locations and we'll be able to touch down and do some exploring in the specially designed Surface Recon Vehicle or SRV Scarab vehicle. Each world has been 'procedurally simulated' to be entirely unique, with its own gravity and locations to explore. Mineral deposits, forts, bases and crashed ships are all hidden across the solar system. 

&gt; Questing for a simulation that doesn't feel random, David Braben is focussing on building each world as realistically as possible. ""What we’ve done with Elite Dangerous is we’ve created rules where a solar system for example is generated from first principles. It all doesn’t just obey the rules of science but is formed by them,"" he says. ""You get bombardments of comets and all that sort of thing. It heats up so we know the exact chemical constituency of every planet. We know the temperature, we know how much it’s radiating. We know where the volcanoes are. We know what the weather is.""

&gt; Horizons will also see players working together on planets. Bases are protected by anti air guns so you can work together with those below in their vehicles to infiltrate and take out enemy fire. ""We’re extending Wings so they can work with ground vehicles as well so people can co-operate,"" explains Braben. ""They can do things like attacking surface bases, discovering them. There will be lots of things hidden beneath the surface of the planets. The beauty is it’s a huge expanse so you can scan the planet from low orbit. There are different sort of layers to it. Ultimately you can actually drive around in your own little surface vehicle that we're calling the SRV.""

&gt; More SRV's will be added at a later date but Braben is excited by the unique possibilities offered to players by the Scarab. ""With time there will be [more] in the same way that there are different kinds of ships,"" he explains. ""That one folds up so you can carry it. I just love that idea of setting down, not in any particular place and going from there and doing whatever it is you are here to do."" 

&gt; This isn't all that's offered by Horizons either. An update early in 2016 will add looting and crafting into the mix too. Elite Dangerous hasn't been skimping on extra content and this is yet another slew of expansions to the world. ""We have engaged a lot with the community. We see what people want. We’ve been very proactive when people say ‘this is an issue’ and we’ve addressed it  but also we  do have a long term plan for the game as well,"" explains Braben. ""But the thing to remember is this is not just one thing. When people buy Horizons they buy into the whole of Season 2, the whole set of expansions that you get. The comparison is looking at what we’ve done on the current season - where the game’s come out, we’ve had community goals, we’ve had Wings, we’ve had Power Play, we’ve got CQC coming soon. Each of these have other things in them. They have ships and other goodies. It’s not just the headline.""

&gt; Elite Dangerous Horizons will be £29.99 for existing players on PC and included with the game for £39.99 for new players. It will be released on PC first but will be coming to Xbox One and Mac next year. ",2015-08-05 08:11:37+00:00,cts3vi4,1.0,t3_3fup5l,84.0,EliteDangerous

The archive files haven't been cracked open.  Thargoid ship models could be in there, they may not be.  We simply don't know, but to state *they aren't* is an incorrect assumption.

In-game a Thargoid encounter could happen as any of the following, where-in the CMDR is:

1. Pulled out of Hyperjump into endless random colour space, slowly damaged by random coloured effects then blows up. Scanner showed nothing.
2. Is in normal space and fired upon with random coloured effects from an invisible enemy; slowly damaged then blows up.  Scanner showed nothing.
3. In in normal space and fired upon with random coloured effects from a visible Thargoid ship (model hidden in game files); cannot seem to escape, slowly damaged then blows up.  Scanner showed nothing.
4. Met by a visible Thargoid ship (model hidden in game files).  Scanner showed nothing.  Communications give gobble-de-gook.

7472,".ovl file extension is used for an archive.  While generic .ovl files can be extracted as they use the standard .ovl archive method, FDev have protected their content by customising the archive format.

However, I'm happy to be proved wrong.  Please find me **any source evidence anywhere** that someone has extracted from ED's .ovl archives any of the following:

* ship models (the only method found so far is via the DirectX render buffer
* ship skins
* station/outpost models/skins
* object models/skins
* heck, even full listings of all .ovl files' contents, i.e. simply the names of the files contained inside

Simply because the modding community would love to play with them, and have been attacking ED's .ovl files for over a year now... with no luck.  And they are considerably more skilled and talented than me.

&gt; **What does an average day at work look like for you?**

&gt; If there was ever such a thing as a typical day, it might start about 8.30 with a coffee (decaf, aeropress, as black as I can get it).

&gt; In an ideal world, you should never notice that Elite Dangerous' Online Services team exists as much of our work is behind the scenes engineering that joins the up a lot of moving parts into the living galaxy that we all love.

&gt; My mornings are usually spent catching up with the servers’ overnight reports, making sure the rest of the team has everything that they need and triaging any new features, bugs or support tickets. If things have gone well, then I can settle down to some new code or data wrangling to support the next release.

&gt; Sometimes lunch takes a back seat if there's a particular fix that we're keen to get into our players' hands, such as if a lot of people have become stuck and cannot get online. Otherwise, we often break out a game or two, such as a quick Nidhogg tournament or some alien stomping in XCOM. Artemis has started cropping up in conversation after this year’s LaveCon and we’ve even been known to pop into the live Elite Dangerous galaxy as our own Commanders.

&gt; Afternoons are normally the time to put on headphones and really get stuck into something, such as building out a new feature, deploying some code or data updates to the live galaxy, or chasing down some rare and unwanted emergent behavior. After an hour or two of poring over code, data and logs, I’m told my screens start to look like I’m staring at the matrix, but the patterns really are there!

&gt; We have players from all around the world so while the Elite Dangerous servers never rest, developers do like to sleep occasionally, so we've invested a lot in transaction reliability and server automation. Still, running a galaxy that scales for all of our players doesn't always give as great an experience as we'd like during our busiest times, so very occasionally things sometimes need a prod from home on an evening or a weekend.

&gt; **What aspect of the game have you’ve worked on that you are most proud of?**

&gt; I come from a Science and Engineering background, so it’s got to be the background simulations that run the commodities markets, stock the shipyards, conduct wars and generally bring the galaxy to life.

&gt; **What's your favorite thing about Elite Dangerous?**

&gt; It has to be the amazing sense of immersion that you really are a lone Commander out doing your own thing in the galaxy. I was so inspired by details like the cockpits and the creaks from my trusty Cobra when it boosts out of a starport, that I built my own custom controller last year. It turns out that simple things like changing targets, deploying hardpoints and activating the Frame Shift Drive are much more satisfying when activated by missile switches and flashing arcade buttons.

&gt; **What was the biggest challenge you came up against during game development?**

&gt; You’d think that nothing would hold any fear after implementing the background simulation, but it turned out to be quite tricky to keep track of whether players are online or not as their presence moves around the various galaxy servers. This might seem trivial, but it’s really important information that supports many features from friends lists to voice communications.

&gt; **What have you learned from working on Elite Dangerous?**

&gt; Working on Elite Dangerous’ servers has been a great opportunity to improve my experience of working with distributed data systems. Tracing and optimizing game transactions can take a bit of concentration to follow through multiple levels of caching and across different databases that scale to our load. Also, Fig Rolls are a surprisingly valuable and rare commodity.

&gt; **Federation, Empire or Alliance? And why?**

&gt; From all the time spent flying from the Alioth system in Frontier: First Encounters, it has to be the Alliance of Independent Systems for me. I’ve found there are a lot of opportunities for the right independent pilot in a coalition that depends upon cooperation.

&gt; **Tell the community a fun fact about yourself...**

&gt; I once spent a week at a distillery on Islay learning to make Single Malt Whisky. Oh, and the Big Red Button really does launch the game servers.

&gt; **If you could ask the community one question, what would it be?**

&gt; If you wanted just one more piece of information to be displayed in the game from any of the simulations, what would it be, and why?

* Elite Dangerous released in the year FDev KS promised - 2014
* Star Citizen wasn't released [in the year CIG KS promised - 2015](http://starcitizen.wikia.com/wiki/Anticipated_Release_Schedule)

FDev's only development mistake was not attaching ""beta"" to the title of ED upon release.

CIG's development mistakes are quite long.  Major delays on all modules so far - Hanger, AC, SM and Social - with zero evidence PU is anywhere close to the scheduled end-2015 alpha (which makes it over 12 months behind, PU beta was to be online end 2014).  And four weeks ago they publicly announced that the networking backend wasn't up to scratch and was to be replaced - the same was said during the initial AC delay.

ED's networking backend - while flawed - is functional &amp; works for the majority of players.  Therefore it's only fair to conclude that it is FDev who have the groundwork laid out.  CIG will of course catch up, and Star Citizen will be a great game for us all to play end-2016/mid-2017.

&gt; #Join us at Gamescom

&gt; Unless you’ve been living under an asteroid for the past few weeks, you’ll have noticed that Gamescom is just around the corner. 

&gt; This year our events team has gone all out on making this our biggest and best event yet, and there are loads of ways for people at Gamescom and at home to get involved.

&gt; If you’re lucky enough to join us in Cologne we’ve got something pretty special for you. There will be game demos showcasing the latest in-game content, a live stage show packed with information about Elite: Dangerous and our new announcement, daily prize draws, and an exclusive Gamescom ship paint job for everyone who visits our public stand. 

&gt; The first prize draw each day will be for everyone who joins us at the event, and there will be a second draw for the day’s very best players. There are stacks of amazing prizes, including copies of Elite: Dangerous, a Saitek X52 Pro, Mad Catz hardware and an Xbox One for one lucky winner.

&gt; We’ll have big announcements, interviews with the developers, tours of our stand, footage from attendees playing the game and much more. Every day we’ll be giving away exclusive Gamescom paint jobs for people watching at home, and for the first time we’ll be giving one winner every day the chance to name a planet in the Elite: Dangerous galaxy. 

&gt; To name a planet you’ll need to [tune in to the stream](http://www.twitch.tv/elitedangerous) and remember a specific phrase every day. Every person who tweets that phrase, along with the #EDGC15 hashtag, will be entered in to the 5PM CEST prize draw. Paint jobs will be given out regularly throughout the stream, and there will be a fresh batch of prizes every day from August 6 – August 10 so make sure you come back every day for a chance of winning. 

&gt; You can keep up to date with all the Gamescom chatter by following and joining in our official hashtag for the event: #EDGC15.

&gt;###Cerberus Plague Breakthrough

&gt;Medical personnel at Hart Station were unanimous in their praise for the many Commanders who delivered medicines to the Bast System as part of an ongoing effort to help those afflicted with the Cerberus Plague. A spokesperson at Hart Station released the following statement:

&gt;“We are immensely grateful to the 765 independent pilots who delivered medicine to the primary care facility here at Hart Station. Through their charitable efforts, we were able to bring relief to thousands of patients, and also to devote time we would not otherwise have had to our ongoing search for a cure. What’s more, we think we may have made a breakthrough in that area. So to all those who contributed, we just want to say a heartfelt thank you.”

&gt;Apparently, patients at Hart Station who were offered Ceremonial Heike Tea showed some improvement in their health. When other patients experienced similar recoveries, the local team ran tests and sent samples to Carl Simmons, Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock in BD-02 4304, who is leading research into a cure. He offered the following brief statement:

&gt;“Patients were offered the tea simply to lift their spirits, but it apparently contains ingredients that can actually cure those afflicted with the pathogen. The tea is quite rare, however, and is only found in Heike, so I suspect it will be quite a challenge to gather the quantities that we need.”

&gt; ###James Stimpson, Senior Designer

&gt; #####What does an average day at work look like for you?

&gt; I start my day about six AM when I’m woken up by my son. As soon as he’s up, everyone’s up so I generally get into work pretty early when it’s quiet and I can re-arrange people’s desks and blame it on the cleaners. I’ll get a cup of tea and a bowl of Wheetos and then I check through my emails to see if I’ve broken anything between leaving work and arriving in the morning, most of the time I’m in the clear.

&gt; What I do day-to-day has been quite varied on Elite: Dangerous. When I first joined the project I was helping out with new USSs and Community Goals. Then I moved onto Elite: Dangerous for Xbox One where I handled the new design tasks that come up when moving onto a new platform as well as designing CQC with Dan (Davies). My days can be spent in front of a script, in 3DS Max doing map layouts, talking to coders and artists to see how they’re getting on, writing documentation, sending emails to the boss men to get their thoughts on things, trying to organise everyone ready for a play test, and getting tea. Always getting tea. And biscuits. But not too many. Just a few.

&gt; #####What aspect of the game have you worked on that you are most proud of?

&gt; Compared to a lot of the people who’ve worked on the project I’ve not done that much in the grand scheme of things. It was a steep learning curve coming onto a game that had already been released and had a devoted fan base who already knew far more than I could ever learn. 

&gt; I think the way that CQC has turned out in general is what I’m most proud of. It’s taken a lot of hard work and we’ve hit many bumps in the road but we’ve ended up with what we feel is a really fun game in its own right. 

&gt; It’s taken a real team effort to get it all together; our coders have written magical code to get everything working (I’m quite sure they’re wizards), art have got us some fantastic looking assets to fly around and through, rendering have made things look even prettier, we’ve got badass particle effects going on, the audio continues to be outstanding, the UI team have worked miracles and given us everything we needed and made it very pretty, QA have been invaluable in play testing and of course, finding bugs, and of course the design team who have made something really fun to play. So I guess you could say the thing I’m most proud of is the team! (they better buy me donuts  for saying this).

&gt; #####What's your favourite thing about Elite: Dangerous?

&gt; The sheer vastness and expanse of the game. It’s freaking huge. It’s amazing how much there is yet to discover.

&gt; #####What was the biggest challenge you came up against during game development?

&gt; Getting up to speed on the project. There is so much to Elite: Dangerous and it continues to get bigger. It was quite daunting joining the project as everything design-side is quite technical. Just the weapons themselves are incredibly complex with so many different aspects you can tweak. 

&gt; #####What have you learned from working on Elite: Dangerous?

&gt; I’ve learned that people are incredibly passionate about Elite. I’ve also  learned that Sandy wants everyone to put  on weight (the number of treats he brought in for everyone on his birthday was amazing). 

&gt; #####Federation, Empire, or Alliance? And why?

&gt; I’d probably pick the Federation because I love flying the Fed Fighter.

&gt; #####Tell the community a fun fact about yourself.

&gt; I wrote a children’s book that I’m trying (and failing) to get published.

&gt; #####If you could ask the community one question, what would it be?

&gt; How do you plan on playing CQC? Do you prefer to hang back and support, or lead from the front?

&gt; Hello Commanders!

&gt; We are making two very small, but significant changes to Powerplay following the overhead simplification that went live recently.

&gt; We’re softening the overhead ramp up effect slightly. This will make overheads a little less harsh for large powers (powers that have over forty control systems).

&gt; We’re also slightly reducing the value representing an average number of exploited systems per control system. This benefits all powers because it means a control system needs less exploited systems to reduce the overhead cost.

&gt; The upshot of these tweaks is that no power should be running a CC deficit at the end of this cycle (barring herculean undermining). It also means that powers will be able to get bigger overall. It doesn’t affect the principles of preparation, expansion, fortification or undermining.

&gt; The reason we’re doing this is because we feel it would be unfair to drop a change mid-cycle that resulted in some powers instantly dropping into a CC deficit, effectively as the result of expansion into poor systems rather than undermining, and from no fault of player action in the cycle. 

&gt; As we’ve said before, we don’t mind bad choices in expansion hurting; we simply want to avoid such choices being the main factor for failure.

&gt; The change that occurred yesterday also included a rule to prevent expansion from causing CC deficit so hopefully, we should be finally nailing the coffin on expansion destroying powers as an issue.

&gt; At the end of the cycle, we’re also going to change a few more numbers. Specifically, we’re going to increase the basic success threshold for fortification, and increase the value of piracy, assassination and conflict zone success.

&gt; Looking at our numbers, there’s currently a large disparity between the amount of fortification and undermining. We want to tweak that balance to make undermining more difficult to counter and therefore more useful; the end goal of course is that we get some powers busting each other up by successful undermining.

&gt; As usual, we’ll be keeping an eye on the situation and we’ll keep you updated. I would ask that replies to this thread be kept on topic so we can process it efficiently; feel free to use the [other Powerplay thread to discuss other aspects](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=169489).

&gt; -Sandro Sammarco

&amp;nbsp;

###And some quick Q&amp;A's from Sandro too:

&gt; **Fergal:** Thats a shame, should Archon Delaine supporters pack their bags now? Any chance we can get our Resistance Pockets to spawn so we can pretend to expand?

&gt; Can we see the new formula?

&gt; Also any chance of making anyone trying to stop an expansion from Patreus, Delaine or Antal have to do what the in game UI says, go to the combat zone and kill military ships?

&gt; I understand you only want to give 1 merit per kill for these ships (not sure why), but allowing the other powers to ignore the combat zone (because its hard and you only get 1 merit per kill) and just bludgeon AI type 6s and sidewinders in Supercruise for 15 merits each makes expanding next to impossible (when the combat zones bother to spawn)

&gt; I was hoping some of these bugs would be sorted out before your delete Archone Delaine:

&gt; 1. you have to kill ships at combat zones called Pockets of Resistance for 1 merit each for expansion. These do not always spawn, so its impossible to complete.
&gt; 2. enemies can oppose expansion by killing Kumo Crew Transports for 15 merits per kill, compared with 1 merit per kill on actual military ships. This is easily a 15 to 1 advantage in making expansion fail.
&gt; 3. It says all slaves are legal in his controlled systems - they aren't. Slavery is still illegal in any control system that it was illegal in before.  34 Pegasi is a control system of Delaine, I've been fines there for carrying slaves.
&gt; 4. Text descriptions of his missions don't word wrap.

&gt; **Sandro:** The ""average exploited systems"" number has been reduced from 13 to 11.5. This reduces the amount of overhead a power pays for each of their control systems. All powers benefit from this tweak (the more exploited systems a control system has the better it is for the power).

&gt; The overhead ramp multiplier has been reduced from 5.8 to 5.4 for large powers that use the secondary overhead formula. This lowered ramp means such powers pay less overhead.

&gt; We are looking at the issues {described} in your ~~linked post~~ {numbered bullets}.  ^{edited ^for ^clarity}

&gt; We're also going to buff the merits for conflict zones across thr board, to bring them a little more into line with other activities.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Withnail:** Archon says ""good bye cruel world!""

&gt; What do you meant by increase the fortification success threshold? And can you clarify the piracy success bit?

&gt; **Sandro:** I believe the changes we've made have actually helped Archon.

&gt; Unfortunately, there does appear to be a bunch of folk who really dont seem to like him...

&gt; The fortification success threshold is the number of successful fortifications required to fortify a system. We're raising it, to take into account the relative speed and ease that such success can be accomplished.

&gt; For the other changes, such as piracy and assassination, we're going to increase the amount of success/merits obtained for handing in kill vouchers and Powerplay goods for undermining.

&gt; The end result is that fortification will take more work and undermining will take less, and be more personally profitable.",2015-07-28 13:42:27+00:00,ctiy9wp,1.0,t3_3ewbb3,87.0,EliteDangerous

&gt;Glad the information is interesting to players! Just going to address a few specific points:

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Zalifer:** One question I have is this. The module areas are shown here as spheres, yellow being internal. You mentioned that penetration depth is calculated and a ray is cast internally, so can I presume that these yellow spheres are only approximations, perhaps scaled up for viewing? Otherwise, depth is unimportant, since most are breaking the surface anyway, meaning a ray of very short length would always hit the target.

&gt; **Mark:** it's not scaled up for viewing - some of them are larger than intended and they're probably being scaled down across the board for the changes I mentioned anyway. depth is still important though, in the screenshot I've added several spheres are buried inside that aren't visible (for the purposes of demonstration turning on depth sorting makes it a lot more readable), remember that if you can penetrate far enough you can hit from any direction as well, so those spheres poking out the top could be shot from the underside if you're using something that pierces well. If you fire a shot from the correct angle to hit a near-surface module, yes penetration depth is more or less irrelevant. 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Schrefu:** Wow, such a nice and welcome explanation! Thanks so much!

&gt; Where do hull reinforcements fit in? Do they just increase the hull hitpoints? Do they affect the hardness and thus piercing? They're internal modules, is the same piercing ray applied to them?

&gt; Oh, and could we get such an image showing those circles for all ships? :3

&gt; **Mark:** You're welcome. Hull re-inforcements &amp; Armour at the moment primarily increase your total hitpoints (which indirectly reduces penetration chances - after taking the same punishment your hull health is higher which is factored into step 3). At one point they did also block internal shots, but we removed this before it was seen externally as we didn't have any way to telegraph to the attacker what was going on and it just looked like damage was going nowhere, the number of bug/exploit reports would have been immense! It's a common question - this is something we're planning to address when we review the penetration chances/distances on weapons but I don't have any specific details/ETA to discuss. 

&gt; As for releasing layouts of all the ships, 'tis not my decision  - Should probably wait until designers have had the chance to do the rebalances mentioned before publicising anything that we know's going to go out of date.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Pixeldemon:** Does selecting a sub-target module increase the random chance that the module will be hit? I'm speaking of the under-the-hood calculation, not the odds that the weapon beam/projectile will land on the appropriate spot.

&gt; **Mark:** It's all based on the physical hit location/direction, what you were targeting when the shot was fired has no effect. It's been raised whether we should nudge things based on what we think your intent was, personally I like leaving everything down to the mechanics though.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Viajero:** I really hope Mark keeps on detailing more of these aspects as there are still quite a few left out: effect of different types of hulls, malfunctions types, issues with bulkhead plates not protetcing certain modules etc etc etc

&gt; **Mark:** I do like doing little soapboxes like this when possible . I do stick to areas I know about in detail (in this case because I went through the discussions with design and wrote much of the code), which somewhat limits what I can rant about.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; Another major factor in the difference is the data available to our simulation ""In Elite: Dangerous, we use real world data whenever it's available to make objects as real as we can make them,"" says Assistant Art Director Jon Bottone. ""With a few exceptions, the surfaces you see are derived from the custom simulation based on things like the distance from the star and Newton's second law, the object's mass, temperature, composition, surface age, atmosphere, chemistry, tidal heating, radiative heating, impacts from other bodies during formation and so forth.

&gt; ""For familiar objects like Earth, Mars and our moon, we can use real height map data to build a truly accurate model of the surface,"" he continues. ""In the case of Earth and our terraformed Mars, we've used real height map data, simulated the levels of the oceans and added life to the surface in order to make the geography as accurate as we can make it. Those height maps are invaluable to making familiar planets look real, and if NASA is able to release that data for Pluto and Charon – or any other planetary body –we should be able to incorporate that in the future too.""

&gt; So why don't we just paint a new surface texture based on NASA's new images?

&gt; ""All our planets are built using a sophisticated simulation so that one day you can get close to them. Really close,"" Bottone says. ""Right now every planet can only be observed from afar, but Elite: Dangerous is designed for the future, and by sticking to the simulation and constantly improving it to make it as real as possible, we can be sure the canyons and mountains you see from space will accurately be reflected **when you skim close to the surface, or even land upon it**.""",2015-07-27 23:41:10+00:00,ctidg0d,1.0,t3_3etkxe,7676.0,EliteDangerous

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; Thanks to everyone who submitted their rare goods ideas to us here at Frontier. There were many great ideas sent to us, we were able to narrow it down to just a select few as seen by the poll here. 

&gt; Without further delay, we have selected the top two winners of the rare good competition poll as selected from your votes!

&gt;  &amp;nbsp;

&gt; ###In second place, we have the Sothis Crystalline Gold (99 votes):

&gt; **Name of Rare Good: Sothis Crystalline gold**

&gt; **Short Description:** When gold is exposed to the rare gas coming from thermal vents on the sea beds of the twin Earth like planets Sothis A5 and Sothis A6 it forms into a previously unseen crystalline structure unlike other crystalline golds. Scientist and Engineers are only just beginning to discover the varied technological uses for this rare form of gold due to its unique lattice. Already Sirius Corp are worried about possible 'hostile takeovers' of their far flung colony system. 

&gt; **System &amp; Starport:** Sothis - Newholm Station

&gt; **Means to Create:** X tonnes of gold

&gt;  &amp;nbsp; 

&gt; ###In first place, we have The Hutton Mug (271 votes):

&gt; **Name of Rare Good:** The Hutton Mug

&gt; **Short Description:** Delivered over vast distances by those in search of a profit, the Hutton Mug is only sold to commanders who make the painfully long journey to Hutton Orbital. Made from the salvaged frame shift drive plates of ships that run out of fuel before reaching the station, this is purely a vanity item commemorating the epic journey. Its value lies in its rarity and latent frameshift energies keeping your drink that little bit warmer for the journey. Availability: 1t. Smashing.

&gt; **System &amp; Starport:** Hutton Orbital, Alpha Centauri

&gt; **Means to Create:** Collect and deliver x tonnes of scrap/black boxes (basically, any salvage) to Hutton Orbital

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; Again, congratulations to our two winners - your rare goods content will be in the game soon!",2015-07-27 15:58:34+00:00,cthv09z,1.0,t3_3es7tq,130.0,EliteDangerous

* Rarely used stations prices boom/tank to attract trade.  If no trade comes then drastic things happen (as above).  Potentially lead to station failure/closure.
* Destruction/attacking of NPCs in a given system should have clearer repercussions - if pirates are attacked they go elsewhere or hugely increase their numbers, traders the same or hire more protection, if police destroyed then faction influence is affected leading to anarchy etc
* BGS tied better to PowerPlay, e.g. if Feds take control of an Empire system, then minor-faction influences in that system should be (de)buffed accordingly, eventually leading to system Civil War

&gt; **9. Alrai Sector MC-V b2-7** ~ Unremarkable in most ways, MC-V b2-7 is very popular with traders. 

&gt; **8. Kini** ~ Importing Microbial Furnaces, Bauxite and Rutile, Kini has an economy based around Refinery systems. 

&gt; **7. LTT 18486** ~ With a starport that is quite a distance from the star, the trading runs and missions that are completed in LTT 18486 are seen as lucrative if a little time-consuming. 

&gt; **6. Yakabugai** ~ Serebrov Station is one of Yakabugai's hotspots, with some commanders claiming they've found 'a station that has it all!' 

&gt; **5. Kremainn** ~ With resource extraction sites located close to stations, Kremainn is popular among bounty hunters. 

&gt; **4. Alrai Sector KH-V b2-1** ~ Alrai Sector KH-V b2-1 is a fairly unremarkable system, with no starports and no planets nearby, it is surprising that it's so high up this list. But as a stepping stone to another location it serves a huge number of commanders. 

&gt; **3. Potriti** ~ Some say Potriti is a good system to spot green pilots who need a helping hand, some say it's a fine place for pirates to track down their next mark, but all we know is that it's visited by a large number of commanders. 

&gt; **2. LHS 3447** ~ It may come as a surprise that the starting system isn't the most-visited system in the galaxy. Sneaking a peek behind the curtain a little bit: the player's starting system isn't recorded, only the first destination you jump to, so LHS 3447 gets no head start over other systems.

&gt;Hi all, 

&gt;You may remember a short while ago, Lead Designer, Sandro Sammarco wanted to discuss a few areas of powerplay with the community and get you're feedback. Being the community focused gent that he is, he wanted to give a second update of some thoughts and ideas and get your feedback on them too. 

&gt;So, have a read and then let us know what you think on the changes being suggested. 

&gt;Once again, from a personal perspective, I just want to say that this is a really great to have the opportunity to work with the community on changes in game mechanics. 

&gt;===

&gt;**Overhead Change**

&gt;We’re simplifying the overhead system to make it easier to work with. So first, a quick overview of how overheads currently work.

&gt;When a power controls a system, it has to pay upkeep for it each cycle. This upkeep is based on the distance of the system to the power’s home system and the population of the system. 

&gt;An additional cost, called system overheads is also paid at this time.

&gt;System overheads are currently determined by the total number of systems controlled and exploited by a power. The greater this number is, the higher the system overhead cost is. So the more systems a power controls, the larger the system overhead cost it pays each cycle.

&gt;The change we’re looking to make links overheads to just the number of control systems. So in basic terms, the more control systems a power has, the higher the overhead component will be in the upkeep cost for those control systems.

&gt;Not only should this make overheads easier to understand, it also means that control systems that exploit more systems gain an clear cost benefit for upkeep, adding another dimension to consider when choosing expansion.

&gt;[For those that want the actual formula](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/attachment.php?attachmentid=50847&amp;d=1437402270)

&gt;===

&gt;**Expansion Caps / Additional Data**

&gt;We’re also looking to make a change to expansion. Again, first a little history. At the start of every cycle, a power claims all the CC income from exploited systems and pays out all the CC upkeep for control systems and the systems overhead cost. Remember that upkeep can be modified for each control system based on fortification and undermining.

&gt;The result is a CC balance which will be positive or negative. If the number is negative, the power is running a deficit and bad things happen; systems fall into turmoil and there’s no CC for preparation attempts.

&gt;The issue we’re looking to fix is that even if a power runs into a deficit or very close to one, successful expansion from the previous cycle can push it into the red (or sink it even further if it was already heading into deficit).

&gt;We don’t like this: running a deficit is “the big bad” in Powerplay – it’s the moment when a power truly falters. We want to slow down the growth of powers that get too large (which is why we have system overhead), but we really aren’t keen on that growth actually tearing them apart – we’d much prefer that honour to go to the machinations of rival powers through undermining, rather than from ostensibly a positive activity.

&gt;So what we’re looking to do is prevent expansion attempts from succeeding if that success would mean that the power would tip into a deficit, or if the power was in a deficit before the expansion system’s upkeep was paid.

&gt;We understand that there is a cost to this: all the hard work for an expansion is lost (although merits earned will be kept). To mitigate this issue, and because we believe having accurate data helps Commanders in Powerplay, we’re going to add some additional information:

&gt;Initially coming through as a special report in Galnet that updates automatically (but assuming things go well, we’ll consider integrating it into the Powerplay interface), we’ll deliver statistics showing predicted CC balances for all powers at the start of their next cycle.

&gt;This report will take into account the current balance, the modified cost of upkeep - via fortification / undermining - and the cost of ongoing expansions assuming they will succeed, and display an estimated prediction for the start of the next cycle.

&gt;This should give everybody the ability to see if current expansions are at risk of failing: if you see the predicted balance for your power is negative you know that there won’t be enough CC to cover some or all of your expansions, so fortification (if available) should be the order of the day.

&gt;We think these changes are better than the far more deadly result of having expansion force a power into turmoil, and give Commanders additional information on which to base decisions.",2015-07-20 14:17:31+00:00,ct9oyig,1.0,t3_3dy3wj,524.0,EliteDangerous

7733,"the major advantage is lower network data-communication latency between players with stable connections.

In a client/server setup, if two players have a 50ms ping to their server, the communication latency between them is 50ms*2 + server-calculation-time.  If each has 100ms ping, then 200ms + server-calc-time.

In p2p setup, the latency time is dependent on the pings between players, so if the ping is 50ms then the latency is 50ms.  Much more responsive.

The difficulties some players keep encountering are due to one or more of the following:

* Matchmaking (which decides which players to p2p together) server issues - [half dozen fixes are on their way](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=165393&amp;page=2&amp;p=2524226&amp;viewfull=1#post2524226).
* Player's router/networking UPNP issues - some players have seen the issues vanish by setting up port-forwarding.  Therefore their router was causing the problem (poor UPNP implementation).
* Players trying to group up (ergo matchmake) with players a great distance away, resulting in high pings between them.  This issue isn't seen in client/server setups as players are **pushed** to play on their *local* server (UK/Europe, USA, Australia, etc), limiting high ping variation.
* Players with poor/unreliable internet connections.

A few players have suggested adding Supernodes to the existing P2P setup, to assist in congested areas by acting as P2P reinforcement.  This would be the best of both setups, as it's a hybrid of P2P and client/server.",2015-07-20 09:29:13+00:00,ct9j50l,3.0,t1_ct9ipoz,1820.0,EliteDangerous

7735,"Both FE2 &amp; FFE required the module - taking off from a surface station without one simply detonated your ship.  Meanwhile both games used Time-Acceleration to make landings &amp; takeoffs appear *quick*.

If we attempt to land on a planet at our ship's top flight speeds, it'll take far too long to reach the surface.  E.g. Earth's atmosphere is 700km deep; so from the edge of the atmos, travelling at 450m/s, it would take over 25min to reach Earth's surface.  Taking off &amp; leaving again would have the same time problems.  Not fun gameplay.

Supercruise is a more viable transportation method - up to a height FDev decide (8km like stations?).  Slowest speed of SC is currently 30km/s (Mach 88), which I imagine FDev will determine needs some form of shielding (like FE2 &amp; FFE), for entering or leaving atmos.

&gt; Hi all, 

&gt; Last week we put up an ""Answers from the devs"" post which looked at some of your commonly asked questions. We asked you on the thread to tell us what else you would like to ask and we would be sure to follow up. 

&gt; Never one to break a promise, here is the second ""Answers from the devs"" thread. 

&gt; As before, if you have more questiosn you would like answers on, pop them below and we shall get another list compiled shortly! 

&gt; **I keep hearing about Xbox One updates. Is there anything to keep PC players happy?**

&gt; Oh yes! The development team has never been bigger, and are split into multiple groups working on a number of different projects. A couple of weeks ago Mike Brookes mentioned there will be a trunk release for PC in one of the dev updates, we recently announced that the full game launch on Xbox One would be followed closely by the PC 1.4 CQC update, and of course we are - and have been for a long time - working hard on something we’ll be in position to announce in time for GamesCom. Our schedule is aggressive and we’re working hard to make it all happen.

&gt; **What exactly is the mechanism behind ranking?** 

&gt; There are multiple types of rank. Firstly you have rank within the Pilot’s Federation for combat, trade and exploration. These ranks increase as you successfully complete tasks pertaining to each type of rank. For example Selling exploration data will go towards increasing your exploration rank. Profit from Selling trade goods will increase your Trade Rank.

&gt; Combat works slightly differently, this is done on the number of kills, but the points you get for each kill are based on the combat rank of the target relative to your combat rank so if you are harmless and kill an Elite ship you will get a large number of points were as if you are Deadly and kill a ship below Expert you will not get any.

&gt; Then you get naval rank, which currently includes the Empire and the Federation. These ranks are awarded for completing missions for the appropriate navy’s high command. However, to gain access to such missions, you’ll need to be on good terms with the superpower involved. For example, you’ll only start seeing missions for the Imperial Navy if your reputation with the Empire is high. You can raise your reputation with a superpower by working with any minor faction that’s aligned with them. Trading, handing in bounties and supporting them in conflict are the kinds of activity that will increase your reputation with a minor faction, and when you complete them, a small amount of reputation trickles up to the superpower they are aligned with.

&gt; We are looking to give more attention to military ranks in the future, developing a more defined career structure. This should address issues of allegiance, as well as showing some love for the Alliance.

&gt; **When will we be able to walk on our ships?**

&gt; We have nothing to announce on this one, now or at Gamescom. Walking around on ships is in our plans, for sure, but it’s a very long way off.

&gt; **According to some members of the community, Solo players should have a limited or no effect on Powerplay - or, alternatively, playing in Open should offer Powerplay bonuses. Is this something you are considering?**

&gt; No. For us Solo, Groups and Open are all valid and equal ways to play the game.

&gt; **Currently it's more ""profitable"" from a merit-earning perspective to commit hostile actions in the territory of other Powers than to support your own Power's growth - unless you're willing to spend substantial credits on non-combat Powerplay actions. Are there any plans to change this, or is this working as intended?**

&gt; Powerplay allows the background simulation to dynamically change on a much larger scale than interactions with minor factions. These changes are generally at their most interesting when they involve conflict – that’s partly why the premise of Powerplay is about territorial control; conflict is a great way of generating drama. With this in mind, we’re happy that hostile actions are incentivised.

&gt; **I think everyone here would love to see a battle around a large station. Is that not in the game for technical reasons (eg the AI keeps on crashing into the station) or artistic/gameplay reasons?**

&gt; (From Michael Brookes) This is something we’re looking into changing – more details in the near future – or soon J

&gt; **How does the game calculate where to place you back in supercruise after an interdiction? Is it back to where you started to be or where you failed/submitted?**

&gt; Wherever you are in normal space when you engage the frame shift determines where you will be in supercruise, and when you drop from supercruise your location there is used to determine where you are in normal space. However, because the scale change is enormous (the frame shift drive does a great job at compressing space!) there is an amount of uncertainty during the transition. Of course, the acceleration and speed ships are capable of reaching in supercruise makes short work of any difference!

&gt; **We’d love to see the process of a ship design from start to finish. Will we ever see such a thing?**

&gt; We’d love to do this. We’ve offered glimpses of it with certain ships in the newsletter’s Peek Of The Week, but we’ll definitely look into showing a ship being designed from the first lines in an artist’s sketchbook to the finished model. Watch this space.

&gt; **Does the background sim take system economy (health and type) into account when determining NPC cargo?**

&gt; We are constantly looking at ways to refine our in-game systems. At the moment the AI archetype determines the amount of cargo they are likely to carry and the cargo is based on the economies of the starports in that system.

&gt;Elite is due to get a release date for the Xbox One and PS4 some time in the future, with a preview already available on XBOX to try out for an hour. But what changes should take effect for the day that it arrives on Next Gen consoles? Let's take a look at the grievances of the Elite community.

&gt;I've played a good few hours of Elite: Dangerous and I already have minor issues I'd love to see patched into the Xbox One and PS4 versions. But let me be clear that this is a fantastic game! Anyway, let me run through my quick list to give you an idea of what console owners may be in store for:

&gt;* The price of minerals is too low and therefore not profitable or worth doing.
&gt;* Exploration data could also be upgraded as the player isn't given enough of an incentive to do so - other than the universe is pretty.
&gt;* A small point that someone on Reddit made I completely agree with: Lower the scanning range on planets, so while exploring the player has to go close to the planet to scan them, therefore providing better visuals and experience.
&gt;* A greater variety of missions for those that aren't Elite would be much appreciated.
&gt;* More merits for getting cargo or resistance pockets - they're not really worth the hassle in the game's current state.
&gt;* An improved in-game chat feature.

7810,"For those trapped behind firewalls:

&gt; **Talk us through an average day at work for you**

&gt;My role as game designer varies dependant on the task at hand. We have to see gameplay systems through from the very beginning to final shipping, and we have to retain an analytical mind and see things as a whole. It’s about trying to work out the best things needed to improve the experience for the player at the end of the process. 

&gt;Currently my days are all about CQC, and we’re running playtests every day this week. As well as leading my crack team of designers and coders to victory over QA, I’m also constantly adding to list of tweaks to be made, issues that need to be addressed and feedback coming from the people playing the game.  When I’m back at my desk I’m responsible for managing resources for weapons, ships and modules:  setting up functionality and balancing numbers. I also work directly on the layout of the levels, setting out the positions of start points, powerups, destructibles etc.

&gt; **What aspect of the game have you worked on that you are most proud of?**

&gt;I’ve worked on a wide variety of things during my time on Elite, from early combat development to scenarios, weapons, ships and stations. I’ve been part of the design team since the early days and I’m immensely proud at what we’ve achieved looking back. Personally however, competitive multiplayer is something very close to my heart. It’s something I’ve grown up with on console and enjoyed more recently, particularly with Starcraft II and League of Legends. I jumped at the opportunity to work out how to bring that kind of experience to the Elite: Dangerous universe and even though still in its (hopefully) relative infancy, it’s been rewarding to see the great reaction of players to CQC so far internally. I’m very proud of what we’ve built with CQC.

&gt; **What’s your favorite thing about Elite: Dangerous?**

&gt; It’s still amazing to me what the game does with Super Cruise and the immense scale of systems, we’ve got accurately scaled star systems that aren’t just backdrops but actual playspaces, where gameplay can take part at any given point in a space. That’s a huge technical challenge and something we thought might be impossible at first, especially with multiplayer.

&gt; My favorite thing? Dead tie between the audio for boost and the model for the ‘Huge Plasma Accelerator.’

&gt; **What was the biggest challenge you came up against during game development?**

&gt; I think it would have to be designing the heat and stealth mechanics back in Alpha 1. We used the scenario “Predator and Prey” as our test case for our mechanics. We had this simple idea of what we wanted for the scenario: you hunt smaller ships while a avoiding a larger ship that can easily destroy you if it detects you. It turned out to be not that simple at all however. We had to work out how to get the AI, the sensor system, the radiator system and the internal systems to work in concert to give us the desired effect. Thus, silent running was born. We wanted a ship to still be visible on the radar at close visual range (even in silent running) but for it to drop into “fuzzy” after a few hundred meters, while at the same time we also wanted the “fuzzy” to last for several thousand meters.

&gt; We ended up using an inverse square curve for signature detection that felt like it was balanced on a knife edge but it did eventually give us the results we wanted. Having that scenario in amongst the other combat scenarios was ambitious for Alpha 1 but it really was a make or break as a test for our heat and stealth mechanics. I’m glad we were able to make it work in the end.

&gt; **What have you learned from working on Elite: Dangerous?**

&gt; A lot about astrophysics!  I dabbled a little bit in Stellar Forge when we first started using multiple star systems and it’s amazing the amount of details we have in there. Making your own star system is so interesting but also a bit of a minefield, the game really complains when I tried to make systems that were utterly gravitationally unstable!

&gt; **Federation, Empire or Alliance? And why?**

&gt; I’ve always preferred Federation ship design so I’d have to side with them in a pinch. The Federation capital ship is the clear winner on looks.

&gt; **Tell the community a fun fact about yourself**

&gt; I do like to maintain some hobbies that don’t involve looking at a screen and I’ve recently got back into model making. Mike Evans and I recently imported a pair of the new 1/72 Bandai X-Wings and painted them up, his looks a lot better!

&gt; **If you could ask the community one question, what would it be?**

&gt; For those who play on control pad, what do you have mapped to left and right on the right analogue stick?

Construction Beacons could be bought from an existing station/outpost, and dropped at the appropriate spot in the target system.  These beacons can be destroyed by opposing Guilds.

The beacon's cargo hold can be broken into &amp; stolen from, as per current piracy mechanics.  Gameplay continues like a Community Goal until construction is completed or halted.

Good idea :)

&gt; Guilds would expand their territory depending on the preexisting ethos they picked. I.e. one guild may use Patreus's mechanics e.g. taking military arms to prep a system. The only difference is when they expand into a system an outpost is built.

This could only work if an outpost/station already existed in the system, to deliver e.g. military arms or propaganda.  Empty systems would need a new expansion mechanic, perhaps a couple of Community Goals: 'expansion vessel' commodities are gathered, and once built it moves to the target empty system (chosen by players how?) to receive 'outpost construction' commodities?

&gt; there could be direct PvP ways to destroy each others stations

I like this amendment.  Tie Powerplay back into the Minor Faction influence gameplay, so say once a system becomes aligned to a Power:

* Minor Factions aligned to the Power receive an influence buff, e.g. 2-4% per day depending on Fortification.  An aligned Minor Faction is created if one doesn't already exist there.
* Minor Factions aligned to other Powers receive an influence debuff, e.g. 1-2% per day depending on Undermining.
* CMDRs can help/damage the minor factions' influence % as normal.
* Civil Wars will then trigger much quicker, and appropriate buffs/debuffs given to the warring minor factions.
* System's Controlling-Station is won/kept/lost at end of Civil War.

7856,"For those trapped by firewalls:

&gt;*Greetings Commanders!*

&gt;*One thing we keep hearing from you guys is that you’d like more information directly from the developers. We’ve been looking around on the forums, Reddit and social media, and we’ve pulled together a sample of the common questions you’ve been asking. We put those questions to the developers, and we’ve listed their answers below.*

&gt;*We’d love to make this a regular feature, so if you have any more questions please reply to the thread.*

&gt;*Enjoy.*

&gt;**Is there any chance of an AI system that is varied to your commander’s skill-level?**

&gt;The design of the current system uses a mix of rank matching and location modifiers. We don’t want to vary the experience purely on player rank as you lose the ability to create variety based on location.

&gt;We have noticed that some people are experiencing an issue in some scenarios where only ships of the same level are spawning. We have put in a number of fixes for this, but we are still getting reports of the problem. It’s something you can rest assured we’re keeping a close eye on.

&gt;If you want a tough fight, but you want to keep your reputation as a friendly pilot, then you need to rank up, find an anarchy system with a large population, and hunt down a strong single source. The strong signal sources have been designed to be challenging even for a complete wing, and there’s a military convoy carrying goods out there that should prove to be particularly difficult.

&gt;If you don’t care what people think of you, then you should get a large bounty, head to one of the larger high-security systems and take on some authority vessels. If you’d rather steer clear of danger then look for high security systems and keep your nose clean.

&gt;**How does ambient traffic work? Is it randomly generated?**

&gt;The proportion of authorities, pirates, assassins and bounty hunters in super cruise is determined by the level of security in the systems, and the population determines the number of ships. The higher your bounty the larger the authority response will be. Anarchies also get an additional boost in relation to the number of pirates.

&gt;**What determines how often I’m interdicted?**

&gt;Hostile AI will only interdict you if they are not over a certain skill level above your highest pilot federation rank - not just your combat rank. The difference between your level and the allowable interdicting AI level is based on the system security - the lower the security, the bigger the difference. So in low security areas you could be interdicted by more challenging AI opponents.

&gt;**What determines the spawning of AI in USSs and other scenarios?**

&gt;USS and scenarios depend on the intensity of the signal source as to what number and type and the skill level of the ships that spawn, they don’t take into account the player’s skill.""

&gt;Currently nav-beacons are hand crafted scenarios; however we are investigating changing this to be more like the starports and outposts, where the traffic is determined by security levels and population. The AI that spawns during missions is dependent on player pilot federation ranking at the time of mission creation, setting the AI skill level and reward for the mission appropriately.

&gt;**Is there any fixes planned for high end systems with game stuttering? The game seems to have issues with odd field of view settings or other high texture render times, even in SLI/crossfire?**

&gt;We are investigating some issues related to stuttering on certain systems. The field of view should be set to a sensible value unless it has been changed in the options. It might be worth trying to set it back to the default value. There could be a bug in which case, please report it along with screenshots and we’ll take a look. High texture render times should be reported as a bug, unless they’re running the game on Ultra settings on anything less than a top of the range machine.

&gt;**Have you downgraded the graphics in version 1.3?**

&gt;**You can see Greg Ryder’s original response to this question here:**

&gt;Please thank Granite for putting together a thread like this. The team is always striving to make things better, and we’ve found a number of things using the profiling tools on the Mac and Xbox One that have improved the PC build (thus the opposite to the fear they might lower the quality of the PC build). Elite: Dangerous is built to scale on PC (including 16k screenshot ability and hopefully one day 16k game when the monitors &amp; graphics cards exist!). We are certainly not inclined to downgrade the appearance of anything in the game. Exposing more tweakables for an enhanced Ultra is clearly something you guys are passionate about and we’ll see where it can fit in the current roadmap.

&gt;On the ships / galaxy map front, I’m not aware of any changes that went in for 1.3.

&gt;Dust / Fog: This was optimised due to a pathological case of overdraw (which looked very broken in a number of cases). There’s definitely no downgrade due to our Mac and Xbox One versions, but there have been some changes. Performance and visual consistency should be improved in the general case, however it does seem that some systems are not looking as good as they did. As ever there is no perfect solution. For a fair comparison, the exact same position and lighting conditions are needed (some viewing angles will always looks more awesome!), but we could have entire threads dedicated to discussions on how to light rings (and we’ve had many long discussions internally). I have a number of open issues in our system on the look of the rings, though currently no ETA for when we’ll be addressing them.

&gt;**And Gary Downing’s response to the question in regards to the galaxy map:**

&gt;The original calculation for determining the number of visible stars was a little bit crude. When we increased the visibility sphere to encompass human occupied space for the Powerplay update there was an exponentially larger increase in the number of visible stars near the core of the galaxy. This in turn led to lower framerates and very long route plotting times. The calculation was adjusted so the number of visible stars remained constant regardless of a particular sector's density. We picked a number (~2000 stars) that gave a smooth framerate and adjusted accordingly. The result is that you will see fewer stars in the core and more stars on the fringes than before, but importantly, the framerate will now be consistent.

&gt;There was also an additional optimisation that hides stars when they are sufficiently far from the camera. The reasoning behind this being that there was no point rendering stars that you can't distinguish from each other. Hopefully players should notice there is no longer any hitching when moving the camera through a zoomed out galaxy as a result of this change.

&gt;Apologies to those who have top-end PCs and were comfortable with the framerate in the core. The positive to take from this is now we have a consistent framerate we can tune up for faster PCs.

&gt;**What's the plan for database scaling?**

&gt;We’re constantly evaluating database, back end performance and stabilities and we update or scale as we need to. This is an ongoing process with more improvements planned for the near future.",2015-07-10 13:43:38+00:00,csyjw0p,1.0,t3_3cslqk,2238.0,EliteDangerous

7864,"relates to this I think:

&gt;On a somewhat related note, we’re also considering the concept of introducing a “collapse” state for systems that are undermined massively. It *could* be something like: if you undermine more than a thousand percent (for example) more than the fortification carried out, the system enters collapse. Repeating this feat on a system already collapsing would cause it to revolt and become a free agent, even if its controlling power was not running a CC deficit.

&gt;We think that this ability could do a few nice things. Firstly, it would offer commanders the ability to directly choose flashpoint conflicts and offer clear, tangible results. Secondly, it might encourage much more interaction between the powers, and potentially commanders – something we really want. Thirdly, it would give meaning to over fortifying and undermining, creating interesting dilemmas, even out of otherwise unintentional effort by commanders simply seeking merits. Thirdly, it would create “open-ended” races meaning that fortification and undermining where always potentially useful. Finally, it might open up interesting dynamics in terms of expansion; if a system revolted through collapse, it would then be available for any power to prepare.",2015-07-09 17:05:24+00:00,csxlart,2.0,t1_csxkvzb,591.0,EliteDangerous

7869,"From last week's [Powerplay: Ideas from the devs - Feedback wanted](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=163495):

&gt;So, here’s how merit decay should work, using an example of you being a Commander newly pledged to a power, who will be earning 10 merits per cycle from activities completed in each cycle:

&gt;At the end of the first cycle, you will have earned 10 merits. These merits are used to determine your Rating for the next cycle.

&gt;At the end of the second cycle, still assuming that you’re earning 10 merits for tasks each cycle, you’ll have 10 merits from activities in cycle two, and the merits you earned in cycle one will be added again, only at half value, meaning that you’d have a total of 15 merits (10 from cycle two and 10/2 from cycle one) used to determine you rating for the next cycle.

&gt;At the end of cycle three, you would be earning merits from activities from that cycle, plus merits earned from cycle two at half value, and merits from cycle one at a quarter value.

&gt;So if you earned 10 merits per cycle, in cycle three you would have 17.5 merits (10 from cycle three, 10/2 from cycle two and 10/4 from cycle one).

&gt;This trend continues; in its fourth cycle, merits are still awarded, only at an eighth of their original value. So, in our example, with 10 merits being earned each cycle, at the end of cycle four the merit total would be 18.75 (10 from cycle four, 10/2 from cycle three, 10/4 from cycle two and 10/8 from cycle one).

&gt;Merits are completely removed from your total on their fifth cycle, so in our example, merits earned from cycle one would be completely removed from cycle four, leaving us the same total of 18.75 (10 from cycle five, 10/2 from cycle four, 10/4 from cycle three, 10/8 from cycle two and zero from cycle one, as these merits have been removed).

&gt;TIER 3 CHARACTERS

&gt;Tier 3 characters are transient characters that are created when traffic is generated, these are typically pilots for NPC ships. Tier 3 characters are randomly generated from a global pool as needed.

&gt;They are identified by the following characteristics:

&gt;* They are not persistent
&gt;* They are randomly created according to the required archetype

&gt;* Players do not interact with these characters directly.
&gt;* The character is common to all online players.
&gt;* The character is created via an in-game invent – typically manually.
&gt;* The character can only be killed by an in-game event.

&gt; Tier 2 characters are characters that persist for players, but can be interacted with directly. There is a per player list of tier 2 characters

But that doesn't necessarily rule out wings of players following Tier 2 NPCs.  A Tier 2 NPC spawns for one player within their instance, other players join the wing, join the instance and interact however they wish with the NPC.  I would assume that the T2 NPC is then known to the whole wing.

The NPCs themselves (whether Tier 2 or 3) should feasibly go about their business, assuming the AI/pathfinding is improved to match.  Furthermore I would expect that along with T2 NPCs, T3 NPCs would become semi-persistent so that players can easily follow them from Station to Supercruise to Hyperspace etc.
