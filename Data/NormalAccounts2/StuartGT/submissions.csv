Until recently, Frontier were quite open with Elite Dangerous information via Dev Updates (sometimes weekly) and responding directly to queries (daily), but these were often in a sporadic fashion scattered throughout forums/Reddit/Livestreams/Twitter/Facebook. So its great to see them improving their communication via these posts, if anything with a Worms' Banana Bomb approach.  I Hope they'll continue this with their bug fixing and updating of Planet Coaster too.

**Are detailed notes of upcoming features like these good for a game's community?**

**Do they create greater demands on developers to *continually* inform their playerbase through expectation?**

I've copy-pasta'd the deep-dive Dev comments below, minus the *25% buff here, 20% nerf there* notes. Full detailed copies, including follow up comments from the devs in response to questions, are available in the forum &amp; Reddit threads (sources provided).

#Combat Balance

[Forums source](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/309693-2-2-Update-Combat-Balance-Adjustments) • [Reddit discussion](https://np.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/5e403c/22_update_combat_balance_adjustments/)

&gt; We'd like to continue the process of combat balancing based on feedback from 2.2 and watching how things have evolved since. Sandro, Mike &amp; I have been discussing some quite extensive changes that we'd like to share before the beta goes live and let people chew on what might be coming. These suggestions aren't final until they've been tested in fire! Our primary goal has been making a lot more loadout choices viable for a combat ship. There is a small change to gimballed weapons that mean they need slightly more skill to use at full efficiency, the rest of these changes are about rewarding player for successful use of the more difficult weapons, or about opening up new options.

&gt; ###Fixed vs Gimbal Weapons:
&gt; We think there’s still too big a gap between fixed and gimballed weapons – fixed weapons do have a substantially higher damage in most cases, but this isn’t offsetting the current benefit to time-on-target the gimbals provide. We’d like to make the choice between these two more interesting, but without making the raw damage gap wider. To do this we’re looking at giving fixed weapons improvements to efficiency and their ability to sustain fire, and making gimbals less of a guarantee to hit – they will still perform the intended job of levelling the playing field a little for new players or those using less accurate control systems, but do so in a hopefully more interesting way and to a slightly lesser extent.

&gt; In general with a high-end sensor you should have similar gimbal tracking as before, but with the maximum angle reduced from 30 degrees to 22.5 degrees (approximately the same size as the hardpoint HUD ring). With weaker sensors the tracking angle reduces, in a similar way to how distant/cold targets currently reduce this size, in the worst case with the weakest sensors the angle will be slightly more than half of what it is currently. Broken sensors will also disable gimbals - In a future build we’d like to make sensors explicitly targetable, but need more time to think through the ramifications.

&gt; ###Defending modules:
&gt; We want players to have a little more choices available to defend their modules once shields are down, and reduce the reliance on a shield-heavy metagame.

&gt; * Add Module Defence Packs purchasable in outfitting.

&gt; These modules are a lot like Hull Reinforcement Packs, but provide no hull health and instead act to protect modules. Each Module Defence Pack has two key stats: what percentage of damage it can absorb, and its own health. When weapon damage would hit a module the defence pack will absorb a portion of that damage to its own health pool, until it becomes broken and no longer functions. Multiple Module Defence Packs will apply multiplicatively (so two 60% absorption packs will absorb a total of 84% of damage (1-0.4*0.4). However they will only protect against direct damage that penetrates the hull, and cannot help against indirect sources like emergency drops or heat. These packs can be repaired by AFMs. Hardpoints only receive half protection from these modules.

&gt; We’re hoping that this addition gives people a way of defending their key modules once shields are down, and continue the fight past this point. It’ll be interesting to see if this opens up options in the meta that move away from relying on titanic shields and fleeing as soon as they burst.
&gt; 
&gt; ###Cannons:
&gt; These weapons are relatively powerful, but generally not enough to offset their current downsides. They’re also one of the weapons that have the highest difficulty to use when fixed rather than gimballed, so we’d like to reward players that can do so successfully a little more.
 
&gt; ###Plasma Accelerators:
&gt; These weapons have many of the same drawbacks as cannons, with the added cost that they are very power hungry and hot. Rather than just buffing them to be “hot purple cannons” we’d like to carve out a distinct role for these powerful weapons – breaking through the heavy damage resistance of tough engineered vessels.

&gt; These changes relate to each other: against stock ships, switching to Absolute damage is a penalty that offsets the damage buff a bit. Against heavily hardened ships it is a huge win. In practice we expect this to work out to between a 15% and 250% (yes, 250%) damage buff depending on your target, with the upper end requiring massive damage resistance from multiple engineered defences. Note that ignoring damage resistances means that any kinetic/thermal/explosive multipliers are ignored, but currently damage resistance from SYS pips still applies, this is under consideration.

&gt; ###Beam vs Burst Lasers:
&gt; At the moment these two weapons fill a similar role in a lot of ways. Beams see a fair amount of use but there is not a clear reason for people to choose burst laser. We’d like to adjust the trio of Pulse/Burst/Beam so that there is a clear choice that leads to each weapon: Pulse is the efficient compromise, Burst is the most efficient at turning WEP energy into damage but requires a lot of reactor power and increases heat, Beam generates substantially the most DPS, but drains WEP heavily and generates the most heat.

&gt; ###Torpedos:
&gt; These weapons are punished too heavily by ECM at the moment. We’re going to make a focused change and see how things settle before further adjustments.
 
&gt; ###Frag Cannons:
&gt; Frag Cannons have immense burst DPS until their clip runs dry, but were not pulling their weight in most combat situations. Their current incarnation has lead to them being used by a very small number of people, and most commonly in ambush/griefing attacks. We’d like to make them more widely useful without losing their distinguishing traits.

&gt; The Effect of this is that their burst DPS against shields is unaffected, but because of the reduced armour piercing they lose a fair bit of burst damage against hull, which should reduce the “on-shotting” nature they can have, while retaining full damage against shields. The reload time reduction gives them an 85% increase to sustained damage, and doubling their reserve means they can keep this up for longer. Frag Cannons are now one of the highest raw DPS weapons available - offset by their short range, the difficulty of hitting small targets with multiple projectiles and their reduced ability to damage hulls.

&gt; ###Railguns:

&gt; These weapons are very under-used at the moment, but we’re holding off on changes to them until we see how related changes take effect. Already in this build the Module Defence Packs will likely increase the reliance on hull and make module sniping more useful, and changes to NPC accuracy with railguns should make them less uncannily good with them. Our best guess is that they need a heat reduction, and the ability to pierce all or some of the absorptionof Module Defence Packs, but this will be considered later.

&gt; ###Missiles:
&gt; Missiles feel like they need some improvements again, but as with railguns, we need to see how things settle again before changing things further – they could be extremely powerful if hull-tanking becomes more common.

&gt; ###Reboot/Repair and Shields:
&gt; We’re making a change to reboot/repair and how it interacts with shields - primarily as an experiment to see how it reduces downtime between combats, especially for ships with very large shields.

&amp;nbsp;

#Engineer Blueprint Balance

[Forums source](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/309695-2-2-Update-Engineer-Blueprint-Balance-Adjustments) • [Reddit discussion](https://np.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/5e40as/22_update_engineer_blueprint_balance_adjustments/)

&gt; There are one or two focussed changes to reduce the power where blueprints are overpowered or too prolific, the changes here are primarily about buffs to make making a lot more blueprints into competitive choices for players, and defining roles for some where their intent wasn't clear. Note that while there are a lot of buffs, we're not intending to increase the maximum power of engineered vessels (it's actually shrinking slightly compared to base ships), but there will be a lot more ways to reach that power. None of these changes are final until they've been tested in Beta, feedback welcome!

&gt; Where Blueprints have been modified this will affect existing items, which will be updated as if they had been always rolled with the new recipe – removed attributes will be stripped off, new ones will be rolled, existing ones will be mapped into the new range (for example if you previously got an 8 on a 0-10 attribute, and the attribute is now 5-25 you will get a 21). These changes are based on discussion from Sandro, mike &amp; myself, comments in Italic are explaining the rationale behind each set of changes.

&gt; * 9x New Grade 4&amp;5 Blueprints, for: Burst Laser, Beam Laser, Mines, Missiles, Torpedos, Railguns, Hull Reinforcements, Armour, and Shield Boosters.

&gt; #Blueprint Changes:

&gt; ###Overcharged (Weapon):

&gt; This Blueprint is just too powerful overall, and used ubiquitously. We’d like to rein it in overall (while still leaving it king of raw DPS), especially when combined with projectile weapons that are not affected by the active power draw:

&gt; Overall this will reduce its DPS boost with a perfect roll from +62% to +45% before side effects, this is still the highest of all Blueprints.

&gt; ###Focussed (Weapon):
&gt; This recipe didn’t express a clear purpose, and was generally underwhelming. It is now being improved to hit harder but less often (overall DPS boost) while gaining more ability to pierce targets. With its existing hardness piercing this weapon is very capable of punching at ships above its own class.

&gt; ###Short Range (Weapon):
&gt; This Blueprint wasn’t in a terrible place, but needed a bit of an improvement.

&gt; ###Long Range (Weapon):
&gt; This blueprint was heavily under-used, and quite underpowered to go with it. While the increased range does affect damage falloff, this isn’t as big an effect as it needed.

&gt; ###Double Shot (Weapon):
&gt; No major changes here, but coupled with our separate improvements for slugshots, the Grade 5 version gave a little bit too much.

&gt; ###Light Weight (Weapon):
&gt; Another highly under-performing Blueprint, straight up buffs here, it’s similar in theme to Efficient but still distinct.

&gt; ###Sturdy (Weapon):
&gt; This blueprint is the least used across almost all weapon types. We think the purpose of it is fundamentally a useful one (especially as we open up options to fight as shields drop) but the effect needed to be much bigger.

&gt; ###Optimised (Shield Generator):
&gt; The intent of this blueprint is fine, but it's underwhelming compared to alternatives, so it's getting some improvements

&gt; ###Thermal/Kinetic (Shield Generator):
&gt; These two recipes have exactly the same change, to make them a little more attractive when compared to Reinforced.

&gt; ###Kinetic/Thermal/Explosive (Hull Reinforcements):
&gt; All of these single-type resistance blueprints have the same change, reducing the penalties to make them a more competitive choice compared to Heavy Duty or Advanced. Especially if you are willing to sacrifice resistance to one type in favour of the other two.

&gt; ###Kinetic/Thermal/Explosive (Shield Boosters):
&gt; All of these single-type resistance blueprints have the same change, reducing the penalties to make them a more competitive choice compared to Heavy Duty or Resistive. Especially if you are willing to sacrifice resistance to one type in favour of the other two.

&gt; ###Resistive (Shield Booster):
&gt; Just a little bit too good as it was, though the change here is relatively small.

&gt; #Special Effects:

&gt; ###Auto Loader:
&gt; While this is a useful effect, it’s not really performing up to the level required for now.

&gt; ###Concordant Sequence:
&gt; Shield restoration effects are cool, but this one pales in comparison to Regeneration sequence.

&gt; ###Corrosive Shells:
&gt; This is a special that is a bit of a non-choice as it is very effective but has no scaling with size/number. We’re not making changes right now, but we are looking at adding some kind of scaling here.

&gt; ###Dispersal Field:
&gt; We’re removing the innate damage penalty from this one.

&gt; ###Emissive Munitions:
&gt; Emissive munitions are a bit too good at their job, and the side effect of increasing emissions so far that gimbal weapon tracking automatically maxes out isn’t really what was intended. 

&gt; ###Feedback Cascade:
&gt; This is a bit too much of a “must have” special effect in many cases, and doesn’t scale with the number of guns or their size at all, making it a bit of a non-choice. The effect is semantically similar (though overall weaker if you’re only using a single small weapon), but should feel more interesting.

&gt; ###Overload Munitions:
&gt; We’re removing ammo capacity penalties to make this one a little more attractive.

&gt; ###Smart Rounds:
&gt; We’re removing Flight Time penalties to make this one a little more attractive.

&amp;nbsp;

#Powerplay

[Forums source](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/309692-2-2-Update-Powerplay) • [Reddit discussion](https://np.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/5e3vg6/22_update_powerplay/)

&gt; The changes to we're making to Powerplay are to address some issues raised by the community. The focus is to reduce the effectiveness of internal sabotage, and to make NPC ships belonging to the various powers more discerning, only getting in your face when you are actually engaging in Powerplay activities.
&gt; 
&gt; ###Logistics Consolidation
&gt; 
&gt; Issue: Players have limited means to combat internal sabotage by preparing expensive systems that drag a power into a CC deficit. 
&gt; 
&gt; Fix: Allow players a democratic vote to slow, or even stop preparation for the cycle.
 
&gt; ###Powerplay AI And System Security Updates

&gt; Issue: players pledging to a power are constantly targeted by NPC power ships regardless of their intentions. Additionally, police response in high security systems makes Powerplay activities overly dangerous.
&gt; 
&gt; Fix: Powerplay NPCs use more discerning rules to decide when to engage pledged players, only doing so if the player is actively taking part in a Powerplay activity. In addition, Powerplay NPC ship spawn rates are rebalanced to use less traffic, and authority response to Powerplay crimes are rebalanced to allow Powerplay activities in high security systems. 

&gt; * The NPC ship must perform a manifest (cargo) scan to gain knowledge of carried Powerplay commodities and Powerplay kill vouchers.
&gt; * The NPC ship must perform a basic scan to gain knowledge of wanted status, as per normal.
&gt; * Additional comms responses are used to inform the player of proceedings.
 
&gt; * When a player pledged to an opposing power commits a violent crime against a ship (NPC or human) pledged to the power controlling the system, the security rating of the system is halved (or reduced even more if necessary) when considering how fast police arrive and the strength of the police. This allows players to carry out illegal but necessary Powerplay activities in high security systems without being mobbed by overwhelming authority forces, whilst still retaining high security for non-Powerplay crimes.
&gt; * Aggressive Powerplay ships now all have interdictors. 
&gt; * Powerplay pirates will only visit control systems.

&gt; ### Success Value Tweaks
&gt; 
&gt; Issue: players were able to gain success in opposition and undermining through undesirable exploits, such as collusion piracy.
&gt; 
&gt; Fix: success value tweak and bug fix.
&gt; 
&gt; * Powerplay commodities will only be worth a single unit of success when used for undermining. 
&gt; * Powerplay undermining and opposition vouchers can only be obtained from ships belonging to the Power expanding in to or controlling the system.

[Also included are the updated mission templates](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/?p=4777547#post4777547):

It appears that the templates didn't properly update, we'll reapply those as part of this morning's 2.2.02 update.

The changes in summary are:

* Bring delivery and courier missions back up, although bring down the top end slightly for things like the extreme runs
* The passenger missions were a little too high for the normal bulk types, so bring them down a bit

Note that the expedition type has not been touched at all.

It's worth bearing in mind that they are procedurally generated so it is possible to get extremes and makes it a lot of fun to balance, so we'll continue to tweak as necessary.

Hi all,

I have been looking at the mission rewards and have located an issue with the the long range expedition missions. It's likely the reason you are seeing lower rewards on those missions. We will try to get that tested and push it live as soon as we can. Apologies for the inconvenience. 

As mentioned by the OP this is an ongoing process that we will be monitoring and hopefully continually improving.

Thanks,

The big thing I notice when it comes to deflection of criticism of the current state of Star Citizen is that every time someone brings up its faults and flaws someone simply brushes it off as ""early days"" problems and that progress is sure to be happening now it seems like they've ironed their kinks out. Yet if you look at what they've done and what they've shown I just can't see it. I mean shit, look at this laundry list of problems:

- After declaring they would be releasing Persistant Universe patches monthly, they've failed to actually meet that deadline even once.
- The tutorial for Star Citizen was so broken it took multiple updates to remove (not fix, remove) and still has nothing replacing it.
- After introducing a system for clothing it revealed their atmos system was a sham, and on top of that still haven't been able to prevent players from flying around space shooting air from their nipples.
- They still can't make ships spawn correctly.
- The game has sold ship concepts that are advertised as being crewed by a number of players larger than what the game can handle at present.
- Sometimes basic functions of the ship make it explode.
- Every new gameplay system that they've introduced that is supposed to show that the game is progressing towards its goals has been a threadbare bolt-on that does little to add depth to the experience.
- The two fundamental core gameplay elements of ship combat and person to person combat are dull, primitive and buggy. In an engine designed for FPS play they managed to make crosshairs not work. Ships control poorly and many systems related to ship weapons still don't work properly.
- The game has ships that allow multiple people to crew it but no systems that really justify doing so.
- In spite of attempts to speed up the atrocious animations, they still take too long and frequently don't work correctly in tandem with anything else.
- The patcher is still a murderous resource hog that downloads the entire game with every small change.


You can go on with that too (and quite frankly I will):

- The chat UI is still the same as it ever was in spite of Chris Roberts openly slagging it off live on air that one time. 
- They couldn't even program a timer for their own testing feedback systems. 
- They openly admitted once their crash reporter isn't reporting much more than ""game crashed"". 
- A not-insignificant amount of people in leading positions have moved on to other companies at a staggered and staggering rate. 
- Chris Roberts openly admitted in a recent interview with Kotaku UK that he makes unrealistic demands of his staff (often rudely) and puts the onus on them to spend months making an example to show him in how it doesn't work, with the justification that people told him he couldn't put certain systems in but they still managed it (as compared to how many that didn't, we'll never know and he'll likely never tell). 
- They once claimed a staff member falling off his bike crippled all production as a reason for a delay. 
- They haven't hit an actual release date promise in years. 
- This forum found multiple examples of concept art featuring parts of other games' concept art in it. 
- The ""one seat"" debacle highlighted a complete lack of communication between any different department and complaints made by paying customers were brushed off as coming from ""toxic dinks."" 
- They started refusing refunds on the grounds that the Persistent Universe showed they'd done enough and that this was the game in its base form in spite of the fact at least one developer referred to it as a pre-pre-Alpha.
- They changed the TOS to flat out refuse customers their right to refunds and claimed that chargebacks were ""illegal"" in spite of the fact that it's a system created by banks.
- Their new TOS is a complete fucking failure.
- They're keeping a list of people who asked for a refund for some weird reason. We know this because they incompetently let one refund-seeker stay in the CC of their internal communications.
- To them tweeting a ship name is corporate espionage.
- That entire email exchange with Beer where no one could even agree on what they were punishing him for.
- Every video PGabz makes is a giant neon sign showing how broken things are.
- SomethingJones has an archive of transcriptions of CIG interviews and shows that reveal even Chris doesn't know what he's doing half the time.
- They're still doing mocap.
- Chris Roberts takes multiple documented vacations a year while his staff apparently stay in working around the clock.
- They had so little to show at CitizenCon this year they had a 'documentary' to show that week which highlighted the fact they don't know what they're doing because they couldn't even properly make a demo. It shows Chris Roberts being a complete fucking twat to people.
- Chris Roberts begs for gifts from backers in spite of tweeting himself on vacations.
- It once took Chris Roberts 8 hours to have a meltdown about Derek Smart over something Derek Smart wasn't even involved in.
- When they added ""persistence"" to the game it didn't actually add anything meaningfully persistent.
- Star Marine is in the game, except it isn't because it's coming out uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

But no guys, they're trying. They're really trying and this sort of thing you'd see in any other company that was run by a tyrant if any of these other places were half as open as CIG. CIG is so open in fact that's why we have no idea on what real and tangible progress is occurring, what CIG's plan is, or if Star Marine is in the game or not. If you can read that from shoulder to toes (cause there's clearly nothing going on in the head of CIG and no one else is going to stick their neck out) and still sit there going ""Yeah I'm fine"" then holy shit get someone else to manage your money, and also have them put little safety covers on all the electrical sockets in your house.

This is the thing true-believers, even if you don't think it's a scam you're looking at a farce in progress. This isn't normal. This isn't even anything from the leaks posted here, this is all stuff that's out there mostly via CIG themselves. This is the kind of thing that comes out after a company goes down the tubes because of incompetence at the top and no real plan or idea of what they're doing. Five years into this thing and they're still throwing shit at the wall and hoping it sticks. Five years on and still no minimum viable product. Five years on and the best systems they could add were putting pants on and getting sent to your room. Squadron 42 has gone from a big campaign in 2016 to three separate campaigns to a prologue and a whole lot of hoping 2017 might be manageable. The one big thing they wanted to show everyone this year was just a mock-up they made because they had nothing to show for their work, and they still struggled to get any of that to run (and it fucked up during the presentation).",starcitizen,"Warning: SA Goons have compiled an extensive negatively-worded list of CIG's ""mistakes"" to attack the SC project &amp; push for its failure",https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/5bxred/warning_sa_goons_have_compiled_an_extensive/

here's the problem

CIG has to push out a new patch before years end. this cannot be 2.6 (with FPS mechanics) or 3.0 or anything star marine related because its so fucking broken

* their current matchmaking breaks every damn thing on the server
* it also breaks your client when two people try and use cover at the same time
*half the time you still respawn inside your bunk during a match
* the new arena FPS maps are still buggy as hell (clipping, wall walking, etc) and have to get redone
* the replacement arena maps are areas that have been wholly lifted from current areas, like grimhex
* roberts doesn't want ""maps"" but entire seamless areas (""Shoot in the same universe you can fly in."")
* this is not so good for the servers or players in ships flying around outside the hostile zone (which is why the arena style maps are still being worked on)
* the team is confused on what exactly they are putting together and what roberts wants to release
* there's a separate module for SM but roberts wants it folded into the universe 
* lag is bad, really fucking bad, even with less than a dozen players
* the instance network code is six months to a year out for rudimentary matches (24 to 36 players, small arena type maps, etc)
* a year+ out for higher matches (multiple areas, surface to air combat, 50+ players etc)
* the much touted ""local physics grids"" don't work for shit with FPS stuffs

they are discussing prepping the flight model changes and releasing that as 2.6 instead, with star marine being totally folded into 3.0. but this is a big problem, because chris said star marine is weeks away back in september

they are kinda fucked either way so I'm really interested to see what they do. if they really do end up pushing out 2.6 with star marine in its current state, I don't think the game will survive. its like, not playable. you can only wave your hands around and say alpha so many times before people start figuring out this is the game they just paid $2500 to play

current standing at the office is there will be no more numbered releases until 3.0 in late 2017/2018, after the sq42 prelude/episode 1 is released. I posted that awhile back but it's looking more and more like 2.5 will be the last patch for SC for quite awhile",Starcitizen_Leaks,"2.6, 3.0 and the state of FPS/networking",https://www.reddit.com/r/Starcitizen_Leaks/comments/5ap1p1/26_30_and_the_state_of_fpsnetworking/

We're glad your enjoying our improvements, as always our talented artists and coders have been working away together to push what we can do and constantly build up and up. This release we've focused on some of the tiling issues from the previous system and how we breakup the textures as well as getting more art control of the look and feel of the separate surfaces. On top of that all of the more interesting and better matched rocks and surface objects to add a bit more interest to the worlds. As always we're never satisfied so no doubt we'll be talking about what we do next at some point but for now sit back and bask!

***

We'd love to do another stream and more in-depth look hopefully as well with some input from the guys who've worked on the systems but haven't had the chance to chat and showcase their work. We're trying to juggle lots of new stuff and work out where the natural breaks in development are. The landable planets we're a big break from the originals so that was a good point, hopefully coming up will be a natural break or big step and we can sort of revisit everything up to that point. SO far the only big change from 2.0 is the material system which the lovely coder in charge of rewrote and what your seeing is the outcome of that as well as all the tweaks and fixes to the existing system.

***

*Indeed snow planet are far better than in 2.1.*

Yup The art team had some fun with that to understand what's need to make things look more natural.

***

*I can't go back to 2.1 now that you've spoiled us in beta.*

We're terrible people with black hearts who constantly force you to get new shiny things :P

***

*...lack of optical references on planet surfaces in flight mode at a view hundred meters up to a view km...*

It's something we're aware of yes, there's a section on the todo list with some options that we'll hopefully get to look at. The larger settlements do a good job but are obviously not something you see much when flying around the planet!

***

*Over the top but really cool would be a system that generates Planetary surfaces over time like in reality (like stellar forge a planet forge). Base substance (rock, water), temperature, Modificators (ionic wind, meteor showers, all kind of particle systems), deflectors (different thickness of material) and combined with a time modulation.*

The system does ""simulate"" what's going on, as always we look to improve but if you remember back to the live stream we talked through how the planets are formed by simulating geological processes and layering them correctly. Like wise the star and planet formation is heavily based on science and we attempt to use the mass of the galaxy to form things following actual science data. people can spot that certain suns will create certain systems around them for example and the presence of certain minerals and make up are dependant on the stars chemistry.

I once read an interesting paper from GTA which went through the process of building the game, they were pointing out that they essentially build the city so it functionally and artistically makes sense and then the designers come and populate it rather than trying to design the game and build a city round it. Elite is basically the same we aim to create reality as much as we can and then the design and gameplay build on that. (Obviously we fudge some bits when we need to but the underplaying principle is no random dice rolls to decide how the galaxy works it's all based on a process)

***

*Whilst you are about, could you possibly comment on the ambient light levels on the dark side of planets? This is where as you get closer to the planets they get increasingly brighter.*

Certainly! So I don't want to get into the design side of things that's not my area, however I will say traditionally we're against giving the players the option to experience the game in a very different way to other players, having an unofficial option to disable the backlight would I think alter the experience quite a bit! 

However back to the original question...... The current system is not what we consider finished, it's a cludgy fix to the problem of pure black lighting on the dark side of a planet, which yes is correct but isn't fun from a gameplay POV, people can't really see what they're doing and ultimately avoid those areas. At some point we'd like to implement a better solution which is more complex but accurate...

To give you an idea of how we light things at the moment; in addition to the main star we use the background as a ""lighting map"", the background map is essentially the galactic plane (and the planet your on if your on one) To create the effect we have now we artificially boost that map when your on the dark side. However clearly in some cases (around the core or nebula) the background map can be boosted far too much giving you that nasty flat look, as well as the opposite where the galactic plane is non existent and there's nothing but almost pure black which leads to very little change. The correct approach is calculate the luminosity of the stars around you in simple quadrants and make sure the lighting map reflects this. Once that's done we'd decrease or remove the boost and planets would get the right lighting all over, planets in the core would be almost day lit all the time and for planets near the rim you'd see a marked difference between a night side that faced the core vs the night side which faced out of the galaxy.

Hopefully that makes sense?

BTW I know you enjoy such things; if you haven't had a peek in the beta try flying in some rings near different coloured stars we've fixed a few bugs to do with the fog colour being constant when it should really reflect the main stars values more. Should create some nicer vistas!

***

*Are you sure it's a problem? From what i know, people actually want pitch blackness...*

We would like the dark sides to be playable without a radar mode essentially. We'd expect a greater degree of variation in that lighting though as I said planets facing out from the core would be almost black whilst planets further in would get more light. In the core there would almost be perma-day from the brightness of all of the stars constantly shining down upon you.

***

*Out of interest I assume the ambient lighting effect on asteroids is due to the same reason as the darkside of planets?*

Yes, the change came in 2.0 because we now update the lighting map every so often ~60 frames so that objects on the planets are lit with the bounce light of the planet correctly (ie if you drive over a red material you'd expect to see the underside of the buggy receive a red bounce vs a blue bounce from a blue material) Previously in season 1 we just generated the lightmap once on exit from supercruise as players could never move enough to find themselves in a differently lit environment (space stations/hangers use a slightly separate technique)

***

*Ah, so this explains why asteroids inside nebula are so brightly lit.   I guess it also means there are now a lot more variations in lighting within ring systems.*

Yup in S1 we'd generate the lighting before the user flew down to the rings, now it's regenerated within the rings which means you get some nicer visuals and obviously on a planet as the sky rotates this is what gives you the ""nebula rise"" lighting etc

***

*Looks like currently, according to vote results, most of players consider night sides without backlight to be more fun, than with it. So why don't give this group of players an OPTIONAL possibility to get their fun?*

Not wanting to get into a debate but generally if we implemented everything as an option we'd never get anything done. The maintenance cost for split paths gets very high, that's before you even look at testing things. Marking things as unofficial also isn't the way we want to do things going forward, if it's in the game my PERSONAL view is we should support it. Making it unofficial isn't a good get out clause to me. Also since the end goal is to make it realistic and correct then having an optional anti-cludge will result in the same debate when we fix it, people will be asking for us to keep the anti cludge and we'll still be stuck supporting multiple paths. Things which don't affect the game such as bloom etc I'm all for exposing options but anything that's fundamentally changing the game needs to be thought about very carefully. Ultimately we want to make the game awesome and enjoyable and to chomp through the feature list as quickly and easily as possible. 

Hopefully when we add the better solution you'll all enjoy it :)

***

*[Post about ship headlights]*

Long post! Basically (as I'm typing in a screen) short answer is lighting is very expensive, it's one of the most expensive parts of modern rendering. Increasing the number of lights or the overlapping of multiple lights really hits the frame rate. One of the most expensive parts of the game is actually the station tube lights, they suck up a lot of time. Increasing the range of the ship lights would be really awesome but sadly prohibitively expensive. We certainly tried running them further out and in fact the distances did get pushed when we shipped season 2 but not to the level your thinking of.

***

So the darkside of the earth (or moon/mars) isn't pure black, the stars provide a low level of ambient lighting. The final solution will mimic this much closer and you'll find the darkness of the dark side is related to brightness of the surrounding stars.

***

*Why is it that the dark sides of landable moons/planets suddenly ""brighten up"" after a few seconds?*

So the darkside of the earth (or moon/mars) isn't pure black, the stars provide a low level of ambient lighting. The final solution will mimic this much closer and you'll find the darkness of the dark side is related to brightness of the surrounding stars.

***

*anything new on ring casted shadows on planets?*

As with most of the suggestions people have mentioned they're on our very big list of things we want to do! We're doing our best to focus in issues that improve the game in the best way for the most people (ie bang for buck) some things that may seem like simple fixes are actually quite complex or depend on changes to another system that we already plan to modify so rather than fixing it twice we want to make sure we spend that time on other awesome things for you guys n girls  :)

***

*The problem isn't the fact that there is ambient light, it's the fact that there is too much of it.*

As I said we agree it's an issue and it's on the fix list. We could spend time twiddling the current solution which realistically just won't produce anything nicer or we can make sure we don't do the work twice and get on with the better version. I can't say when that's going to be as generally until it's either done or set in stone we don't like to discuss future things as inevitably if we hit a problem or need to change something you guys are disappointed. In the same way it's not practical to post up a list of what we're working on and have people vote on it as the issue's are a lot more complex :(

it's also possible we work on bigger long term things that are utterly awesome that if you knew about you'd instantly care less about this issue. [#1]

The root issue is to get the subtle lighting effects we need that work consistently on all the planets. Turning the system off will lead to complete darkness so that's not viable. I can guarantee nobody on the team has looked at the current solution and thought it's perfect and said we don't need to improve it.

***

Just to be clear I said ""could be doing other things"" not that we definitely are! I'm not trying to hint or hype at something just pointing out that some features need many months of work and thought as well as the fact we support many departments so sometimes not all the work we do is purely visual.

***

*[Related to #1 above] Yes! Full atmospheric landings along with procedural life in 2.3 confirmed!*

I can almost hear the marketing and community folk coming to take my keyboard away!

***

Yup the guys spent quite sometime making sure the distance holds together in the latest version, there's a lot of different blending techniques and tricks to break things up and avoid tiling.

I think I've said it before but atmospheres hide a lot of issues, you'll see in other games that atmospheric scattering gives you a lovely look but hides the distance and stops you noticing the terrain detail. We deliberately wanted to do things right so we're making sure the underlying terrain is correct and good before we worry about adding fancy effects which compared to the terrain work are actually quite simplistic.

***

*As the systems work now we have the same or very close to the same light intensity on distance planets from their parent star, was this a gameplay design decision or will we be seeing a greater dimness/darkness on those outer worlds in the future?*

Yes this was an art/design choice. Our eyes can't deal with the light levels that occur across space, our sun is relatively dim compared to others so many planets or areas would be far far far brighter than your eyes could handle (blinding white which actually some of the 2.0 inner planets on bright systems were and it wasn't pretty) or the opposite near infinitely dark. You'd really find very few that your eyes would perceive similar to earth. All the photos we're used to seeing of planets have had their exposure compensated for these things to create a look that would replicate what you would see at earth level brightness. We took a similar approach and made sure that the difference between places is correct but the ranges are far less great.

You can also argue that the nebula's are all the wrong colours as every nebula photo you see has been false coloured to highlight certain elements of the nebula such as the hydrogen clouds etc, we had a long discussion about if we should false colour all the nebulas the same way or not and in the end we went with depicting them as most people would imagine seeing them based on the various photos floating around. Another example where being correct looks wrong!

***

*Perhaps you guys should put something about this in your marketing blurb? I'm sure a certain other game company would tout this as ""Terrain 2.0""...*

It's cool stuff but we just see it as an incremental change and tweak/fix vs a new system, we have lots of things we'll enjoy talking about in more detail when we get there though :)

We'll have stuff to sing and dance about coming up at some point I'm sure and then you can expect lots of lovely marketing stuff ;)

***

*When we move closer to earth like worlds, currently they show simple displacement maps of terrain along with ""city lights"" where there is no sun. Do you think in the future when these are actually modelled, will they represent the current placeholder graphics accurately or will they change completely? Also most of the other space sims tried to create atmospherical landings in the past and they all had different approaches to it with problematic results. What do you think your solution would be like from your perspective to achieve seamless transition?*

I think that question is a little like asking a caveman who has just his lit first fire how his nuclear reactor is going! Now that we've started building planets you can land on which create realistic terrain we've obviously considered how we move things forward without having to attempt massive resets every time we change a system but we simply don't know the full feature requirement for those sort of things, we're aware of the probable cases and what we'd like. The systems we design now are meant to be more modular and upgradable to reduce the overhead of improving tech as we go but ultimately we'd have to be a lot closer to that goal to have a clear idea of how to do it. 

Elite is developed with a certain sense of what's reasonable at certain timescales, the further away a requirement the less weight we assign it in terms of design and consideration, as things get closer we think about them more, this is to try and avoid painting ourselves into a corner but also not to be wasting time thinking of requirements that are too far away. So for example we did zero thinking about planetary landings from our POV for season 1, we just needed to get the basic version and it was clear that worrying about we'd do in future would mean we couldn't hit that goal. Ultimately you'd all be waiting for season 1 right now still if we had to really have a rock solid plan for cities which clearly isn't how we want to approach development.

###More...

*This a bit officially confirms that Season 3 and Season 4 will NOT have atmospheric landings i presume?*

Nothing I say officially confirms or denies anything I'm not here to discuss marketing, launches, design ideas or anything beyond some simple feedback and discussion. By using phrases like ""decide as we go"" your really doing a disservice to the wonderfully talented people who work on the game, nothing is decided ad hock at the last moment. My comment was that as a company we've excelled at meeting deadlines and requirements in tight conditions and the way we do that is to rank and focus issues. There's a clear difference between making it up as you go along and not doing anything until something is all planned out. My example referred to how we managed to develop season 1 of the game and meet the deadlines required by making sure we didn't distract ourselves with unneeded details. It was clear when the decision was made that season 1 wasn't supporting planetary landings that we shouldn't hold ourselves up by worrying about them when the system for s1 was so simple. While we've moved on to landable planets we've had to make sure we consider greater requirements so we don't end up starting over again on another new system. What we do and don't support, what tests we have and haven't done and what the plans are aren't for me to say or comment on so I'm afraid you can't infer anything from my comments as I write them from the POV of disregarding anything we've not officially announced. I will say though that adding a pretty atmospheric shader and some nice flames is orders of magnitude simpler than the terrain tech we've built and are currently working on. As always the devil is in the detail.

I understand the enthusiasm but people will run themselves in circles over analysing comments from Dev's if they hope to find hidden meanings, we're happy to chat about things and shine some light on the work as well as discuss bugs but trying to predict future deliveries and plans from those comments isn't going to lead to much.

***

No problem :)

As I said in my quote for season 1 we didn't think about planetary landings while writing the v1 planets system, we decided earlier on we'd need a completely new system so to even consider how to do them with a system we knew we wouldn't be using would just have been a waste of time and money. Planets V2 started to be thought about seriously around the games original release and we worked from there on the basis of writing an expandable system for planetary landing that we could improve over time without costly rewrites. V2 is what your all currently flying and driving around in Horizons, we've updated it through the year to improve the performance and visuals. I can't talk about what we have a good idea of doing or where we are as 1) that's not my job to do and 2) it just feeds speculation. If I come out and say we have some internal tests that show X then straight away the conversation changes to how quickly you get x, does x do y? why isn't it out yet because 2 months ago I said we had some tests of x etc etc. 

As an example we had tests of the v2 system around 1.1 release time, it wasn't pretty, had numerous bugs and probably would have made you all think you'd never get anything. It took 10+months to get it to a shippable state and solve all the issues across the range of hardware we support. Not to mention testing things people had literally never tried before to get it to work.

I'm not a designer (luckily for you guys my gameplay ideas suck!) I'm in charge of technical art and rendering, all I can tell you is how we build and render the content.

Just to be clear we have no technical solution that we're willing to talk about right now, that's all. That's neither confirming or denying the absence or presence of anything just there's nothing I can add to that discussion right now. You can bet though that if/when the day comes we'll have been working on it for awhile!

As usual.... just before the end of Beta, Hutton is Hosting the ""Big Beta Bash"".

Hosted by CMDR Youneverasked and the Hutton team, this time the Hutton Truckers are taking on **all-comers**.

Date:

* **UPDATED 22nd October, from 5pm game time (UTC) onward (6pm BST)**

Venue:

* Ngalkin Citizen's Outpost

Teams:

* Truckers = **Type 9's with NPC crew and Taipan Fighters**
* Shiny Pirates = **Belugas with NPC Crew and Imperial Fighters**
* Team 'Numbskull' = **Keelback and Fed Fighter**

At the end of beta you lose it all anyway, so you had better blow it all in style. Everyone.... turn up and shoot stuff. Missiles, heat weapons, turrets, ramming, spamming ECM, chaff storms, mines, shock mines... the lot.

And if you get bored, demolition derby on the planet below. Will release coordinates later.

As usual, we're thinly disguising a test of the new fighters, the new ship, weapon updates and of course that shiny new style location as a big battle. Turn on your verbose logging. Throw everything you have at the matchmaking and shoot stuff.

Also as usual, anyone in a non-approved ship is to be attacked and destroyed by everyone. Yellow Haulers are our camera ships (they're the only exception).

If you cant make the start time, turn up later!!!! We'll be smashing things up for hours.

All convening on teamspeak.laveradio.com from 5pm game time (UTC).

Not open for debate on ship choices. You are in a t9 with a Taipan you are on one team, beluga and Imperial Fighter, you are on the other. Anything else, well... prepare to be blown up :-)

&gt; I think I'm your Pseudo-Sandro today suggesting a change ;) . One thing that's popped up a lot in balance discussions is that Incendiary multicannons are just too good all round, so we're considering dropping them a bit and would welcome some thoughts on how far that should go. 

&gt; ###Proposal: 

&gt; Change the damage type split to 10% of base Damage as Kinetic, 95% as Thermal (down from 20%/100%).

&gt; So the raw damage per hit would be reduced (5% increase rather than 20%), and the type split is slightly stronger. Note that in either case, there is a 10% fire rate reduction that applies after the damager-per-hit buff. This change would mean that the listed raw DPS for Incendiary is lower than the base weapon (94.5% to be precise).

&gt; Some numbers to chew on for unmodified armour/shields (a rarity I know, but it's a point of comparison):

&gt; - A standard multicannon deals 120% DPS to hull, 60% DPS to shields.
&gt; - The current Incendiary mod does 111.6% DPS to hull, 118.8% DPS to shields.
&gt; - The new proposal would deal 96.5% DPS to hull, 108% DPS to shields.

Update:

&gt; So a few updates worth mentioning:

&gt; In 2.2 beta several weapons already had their accessible levels of recipes increased. To pick two favourites Cannons should be available at G5 from The Sarge, and Plasma Accelerators at G5 from Bill Turner. Some Weapon types are still lower though and there's an update that should be going roughly alongside Beta 5 (it might be a little later) which brings all weapons up to at least level 4 recipes, with a few more at 5.

&gt; Even allowing for Overcharged's issues, Incendiary does still seem to be a little on the good side. For the next beta we're going down a slightly different proposal based on feedback and some internal discussion: Reducing its overall dps vs shields by a smaller amount (4%) but its damage against hull by more, so that there's a more clear downside while keeping very strong shield damage. This change should make it into Beta 6, and we'll see how it behaves alongside the other pending changes - it's by no means final.

&gt; Overcharged being king of the modifications is certainly on our radar, but making changes to existing items is a little more involved than these smaller tests allow at the moment so we're holding off on a change until other tweaks have settled in further.",EliteDangerous,Mark Allen: Incendiary Multicannon nerf proposal,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/55tacs/mark_allen_incendiary_multicannon_nerf_proposal/

&gt; Yeah, for a little more detail - there's been a bug that caused the flickering that was provoked by a couple of things that took ages to track down because the causes were... weird. One of them was during the interdiction crossing the boundary between spheres of influence between two planets that were both tilted off the system plane in different ways, and hitting the boundary in a specific direction.

&gt; With some of the downtime I've had not being directly on 2.2 features (I've been focussed elsewhere until dropping back in recently to help with bugfixing and balance) I had more time than previously to dig into it.

GameStar are a major German gaming print &amp; web magazine, and frequently publish articles and interviews detailing Star Citizen's progress.

Here are some of the translated quotes courtesy of SC backers, firstly from the video interview:

&gt; Ever so often people ask me whether Star Citizen will be a great game and I just don't know, but I hope. The project gets more and more impressive with every Alpha version and demo but is still lightyears away from a functioning onlinegame. With Crowdfunding numbers and ambitions of the devs growing the challenge for the devs rises aswell; they got a lot of work to do.

&gt; I think some players have a little bit of a wrong idea what Star Citizen is, it has more of an online roleplay game to it than you might think. You have to enjoy exploring the universe together with other players, looking for quests and adventures on your own and coming up with your own stories. You have to like needing a lot of time walking from one place to another on a single space station; or having to wait because your copilot is talking to a client. Star Citizen will live on me (and my friends) being able to put oneself in my role's position as pirate, trader, mercenary, explorer or whatever else. If you're looking for a classic and entertaining spacesim then you should focus on Squadron42. The singleplayer campaign will be Chris Roberts' first criterion. It will show whether the game mechanics and the engine work. And maybe it will finally release next year, atleast that's what Chris Roberts -not guarantee- hoped for when I was talking to him.

&gt; A few backers I have spoken to are disappointed about this slow progress; I can understand that. A lot people are as excited as on the first day though. And they are planning now what they might want to do in the online universe not even knowing when it will be ready. Chris Roberts can't answer that either. I understand this enthusiam aswell! For me, Star Citizen still is what I wrote about it in my first preview in 2012: spaceship porn. I dig those detailed ships and their sharp textures and computer voices. I like seeing the hands of my pilot when climbing into my cockpit. And that's why I enjoy playing the PU Alpha even if you actually cannot do that much in it. It is a small insight in this online universe and it lets me dream about playing this in an online environment with thousands other pilots whose ships I as pirate will all blow up.

&gt; I can salute CR's team what they accomplished to far, 64bit CryEngine and physicalized grids. And I am looking forward to land on planets and work with the rudimentary professions in the 3.0 Alpha if/when it releases at the end of the year. But I would not advise anyone to spend money on this game right now; everyone should make a decision on their own. Because, money that you spend on Star Citizen is spent on a dream; I hope this dream becomes reality; but I can't say for sure.

Then in the article's comments section:

&gt; Chris stated in an interview that all content for Squadron42 (graphics, missions) will be complete by the end of the year. There is still more work to do concerning some basic systems like the AI or the coversystem for infiltration missions. Those will take more time.

&gt; You are right, that was a mistake. I have watched the recording of the interview again (his conversation with Chris Roberts during Gamescom), and Chris talked about 2017. You hear that much during Gamescon, I've just mixed things up. Sorry about that!

&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, [PCGamesN are now reporting](http://www.pcgamesn.com/star-citizen/squadron-42-release-date) (citing GameStar as their source):

&gt; Squadron 42, will be more likely to arrive near the middle or end of 2017 than its current Q42016 window.

&gt; The timeline of its release has been one of the more obviously fluid points of Star Citizen's ongoing development, as an original 2014 release pledge has shifted smoothly from year to year. The game's own minisite currently has a ""2016"" marker for availability.

&amp;nbsp;

Keen backers who follow the SC development closely are already of the opinion that Sq42 will release later than the most recent planned window, but without an official announcement some of the community remain uncertain.  If GameStar's claims are true, then shouldn't CIG have announced the delay at Gamescom?  Is it a simple misunderstanding on the interviewer's part, or mistranslation from the community?  Will CIG wait until CitizenCon to affirm a 2016 release, in a similar fashion to last year's delay from [schedule](http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2787306-1438681995-bafta.JPG)?  Is a lack of gameplay trailer/footage just a teaser, or indicative of an incomplete game?

Personally, I think CIG should clear this up asap, and they are normally very open about development matters.  What do you think?

&gt; It just occurred to me that Elite doesn't really provide whole satisfaction to any of the Bartle types.

&gt; Achievers are left feeling empty when they finish grinding everything out, since now there's not much to do with those achievements once they're all collected.

&gt; Explorers are probably best catered to, the game world is mind-bogglingly huge, the problem is exploration gameplay is the most repetitive and boring of all, unless you're really just in it to see some cool, but mostly non-interactive, sights.

&gt; Killers aren't happy because of solo play and private groups, combat logging, menu logging, the ease of high waking, and the fact that there is zero incentive to PvP outside of the fun of doing it.

&gt; Socializers also have it tough, due to the extremely limited and rather unreliable implementation of multiplayer features and social tools. They're forced to organize and communicate on external platforms, and the game mechanics actively discourage group play for some reason.

&gt; All in all, it's not surprising that Elite has mixed reviews, considering that all 4 basic types of gamers experience a fairly mediocre version of what they really want.

&amp;nbsp;

**/u/Filosuperfan's [here](/r/EliteDangerous/comments/4wav62/a_super_deadly_serious_post_about_upcoming/d65gpxg)**
 (reformatted for readability)
&gt; Added??... Lets not run before we can walk.

&gt; Lets start with fixing the basics: 

&gt; * Balancing the game
&gt; * Crime and Punishment
&gt; * Making power play a thing that might create player interaction.
&gt; * Instancing
&gt; * Combat Logging
&gt; * Making each career viable
&gt; * Giving explorers things to actually explore
&gt; * (More) Dynamic trading
&gt; * Engineer tasks based on skill not mining

&gt; There is enough there to keep FD busy for a year.

&amp;nbsp;

While these issues have been discussed by us (the community) at length, the Gamescom livestreams and interviews offer a fantastic opportunity to **directly address them**, in full attention of both the community and the gaming media, for maximum publicity. Paging /u/ZacAntonaci_Frontier to please hopefully organise this :)

&amp;nbsp;

Please add your thoughts on anything that may be missing from above, or you'd like specific clarification on.

&amp;nbsp;

#Wake Markers

Bounty hunters (not bounty farmers in RES) scan wakes to chase their targets through space from system to system.

###Current mechanics

Clients communicate with the server for matchmaking data to setup shared P2P instances, and when CMDRs enter or exit shared instances, all clients communicate their information with the server which syncs the data to the other clients.  Wake markers are used to show that another CMDR has left the instance by high (to different system) or low (to supercruise) waking out.  If a CMDR leaves the instance by another method, they simply disappear.

###Improvements

* Increase time that a wake marker is visible, e.g. up to 5 minutes.
* Ensure wakes are visible in Supercruise and across instances:
   * Wake marker appears in Supercruise to all CMDRs, if a CMDR high-wakes from normal space at that location.
   * Wake marker is visible in Supercruise to all CMDRs, if another CMDR has recently dropped to normal space at that location.
* Wakes visible from Supercruise can be scanned for information.
* Using colours for ""instance exit"" context:
   * Yellow wake: appears when another CMDR exited an instance cleanly, via logout timer to the menu.
   * Red wake: appears when another CMDR exited an instance abruptly - lost connection, crash, etc.
   * Sync data from Yellow and Red wakes to the server, for analytics.
* Wake-Scanning sends a matchmaking request to the server, so that when your CMDR follows you're automatically synced into the other CMDR's instance upon arrival.  If the matchmaking fails for whatever reason, display a lore-appropriate message e.g. ""Wake lock failure"".

&amp;nbsp;

#Minor Factions

More visibility for CMDRs who actively work with Minor Factions, and give them some direct benefits.

###Current mechanics

Increased reputation with MFs gives missions with higher risks/rewards.  Helping a MF's influence allows it to expand its territory across multiple systems.  This data is synced at regular intervals with the server.

###Improvements

* At a station/outpost, news &amp; benefits for the top CMDRs with highest reputation with the station's MF:
   * Hourly/daily Station Galnet feed showing the Top 15.
   * Tiered bonuses/discounts for the Top 10 - from 0.5% for #10, to 5% for #1 - applying to all sales/purchases/missions/data.
* System Map shows the Top 10 CMDRs with the highest reputation within that system relating to all MFs present there.
* Galaxy Map shows a system's controlling MF, and the Top 3 CMDRs with the highest reputation within that system relating to all MFs present there.

&amp;nbsp;

#Powerplay

To be quick, all the above MF improvements, and everything [described by FDev here](/r/EliteDangerous/comments/407t02/horizons_and_its_included_expansions_the_known/).

&amp;nbsp;

#P2P Matchmaking

While the game's matchmaking has seen massive improvements since its initial release, certain client configurations can still prove problematic.

###Current mechanics

Matchmaking between clients either works or it doesn't.  Clients with problematic configurations don't know that they're encountering poor matchmaking.

###Improvements

* In the Launcher and in-game menu, add a P2P/Matchmaking test, to check for problems forwarding ports via UPNP.
* If problems are detected, direct the CMDR to submit a support ticket and check the support FAQs.
* Where appropriate, notify the CMDR that manually configured port-forwarding is more stable than UPNP.
* Optional in-game messages to notify the CMDR that a/some nearby CMDR(s) are unable to matchmake with them correctly.  Sync the data from these messages with the server, for analytics.

&amp;nbsp;

#CQC/Arena

More CMDRs playing means better matchmaking and more matches.

###Current mechanics

When in the gamemode lobbies (DM/TDM/CTF) it's unknown how many other CMDRs are currently waiting, or matches in-play.  It appears ""dead"".

###Improvements

* Display number of matches in-play: DM/TDM/CTF.
* Display number of CMDRs waiting: DM/TDM/CTF/ANY.
* Allow CMDRs to queue for any gametype, e.g. ""join next available game"".
* Optional in-lobby chat.

&amp;nbsp;

#Combat Training/Tutorials

~~More gametime when internet connectivity is unavailable, and~~ Promote the free demo for new CMDRs to try out the excellent flight model, sound, graphics, immersion, etc.

###Current mechanics

~~An internet connection is required at all times to play, although only a 56k modem or 2G tethered phone is needed for Solo play.  Although there's a free download of the offline Combat Training available, it's ~~unofficial and is unsupported.~~ not promoted on the official website or social media at all.

###Improvements

* ~~Free to download, requiring only a FDev/Steam/Xbox/Oculus account.~~
* ~~Make internet requirement optional, making offline play possible.~~
* In future, add a public scoreboard for online-combat training players, showing best 25 times for 24hr/week/month.
* In future, could be extended further to allow user generated content for testing: missions, ships, paintjobs, stations, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

#Playerbase Stats

Giving out information on the current playerbase shows how many CMDRs are currently active in the game, to easily silence ""game is dead"" critics.

###Current mechanics

Steamspy and Steamcharts show various stats of Steam players: hourly concurrent, daily concurrent highs, fortnightly playerbase, total and average game time.  Roughly 45% of CMDRs don't use Steam and so its stats are probably not representative of the overall game ownership.

###Improvements

* Stats released every fortnight:
   * How many CMDRs have played in the past two weeks.
   * Total gametime of all CMDRs in the past two weeks.
* Data can be obtained manually from server stats and publicly released, by the FDev Community Team in one of the regular publications (e.g. Newsletter, Comms Chatter).",EliteDangerous,"Improvements I'd like to see added to ED, using (mostly) existing game mechanics",https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/4ooxba/improvements_id_like_to_see_added_to_ed_using/

&gt; Greetings,

&gt; [DJTruthsayer](http://www.twitch.tv/djtruthsayer/) announced the other day that he had an epic lore announcement to make. He said he and some others had recently visited the Frontier Developments offices and was given information on a lore change that he could pass on via his Twitch stream as follows:

&gt; In Frontier First Encounters, there were multiple endings depending on player action. One involved the player stealing a vaccine for the mycoid virus from INRA and delivering it to the Thargoids, resulting in them rewarding you with a Thargoid ship, and meetings taking place between them and humanity's scientists. It was my understanding up until now that this was what happened as far as the Elite: Dangerous universe is concerned.

&gt; There was another ending where the player is instead given a more potent version of the mycoid virus by INRA and delivers this to the Thargoids instead of a vaccine, meaning no Thargoid ship was gifted to humanity and no exchanges of scientific data occurred. The announcement was that this is the actual history of events for Elite: Dangerous.

&gt; I've posted this in a couple threads but as yet haven't seen a thread dedicated to it, which surprises me. Perhaps I see a change like this as being quite important, more so than others.

&gt; [Here is a link to the announcement (2:36)](https://www.twitch.tv/djtruthsayer/v/71542627).

&gt; Mr. Brookes, please confirm this, as the implications of this change govern what we can realistically hope to expect from first contact in Elite: Dangerous.

I've bolded the key phrases which indicate that key portions of Sq42 - AI and Cinematics - are still in a **design phase**, therefore implementation cannot be started yet, and consequently release will **definitely not be 2016**. Furthermore, once Sq42's alpha process is finished (all features and content are implemented) the beta testing will take around 6 months, making 1H-2017 very unlikely too.

&amp;nbsp;

BC: Absolutely bursting at the seams - but **everyone is coming together** for good reasons - we cover some pretty good, strong topics... things that we need to get sorted... a lot of the times when we work remote we absolutely make good progress and time zone handover and all that stuff but if we can pull everybody together for a week like we’re doing now then we can churn through stuff a lot quicker. So, what are some of the things you guys are covering this week?

ST: Well there’s a lot of little stuff, but there’s some big ticket items - **some of the big ticket items all centre around Squadron 42 so we’ve got AI and Cinematics** and a lot of people think they are not necessarily related but within Star Citizen they absolutely are... **because we need to be able to signal these AI to transition to the very cinematic modes** that we’ve got. We’ve got so much performance capture that **we want** to allow this player to experience, we’ve got these huge name actors, **we want** you to be within that story... but at the same time, **we don’t want** to just cut out to decoupled cutscene where the camera is flying around... **we want** you to be living in this world.

BC: That’s one thing that I was answering some questions earlier - like “Oh, are you going to do a transition and then it’s just a big cutscene with no interaction?” - and the answer is it’s all over the place. There is so many things that we’re creatively doing seamlessly... that **sometimes a player is on rails, sometimes you cut away - but only for certain reasons** - if it helps with story and all that. And **all that with AI** in it, that’s just nuts

ST: and we’ve got them reacting to you, we need them having conversations with you, we need them giving you missions. We need all levels of different interplay between it and then we’ve got so much content that we get in... so **we need to figure out the best way to get it in**... Sure, we can do these the old-style way where we’re actually plugging in a bespoke scripted sequences... but again when we’ve got hours and hours of cinematics, when we’ve got hours and hours of gameplay that has to play between the two - **we have to be very intelligent over how we actually implement this**.

BC: And then part of that process, at least that I’ve been involved in, **we’re creating a system that from the foundation** is going to allow all these **different types of events, the different behaviours... the different ways we want them triggered**. All the variables we want them to do and not do. And that’s where I think **a lot of that focus has been on is “OK, what is that solid foundation?”** and then to get the rest of... **those few questions that are unanswered, get those sorted.**

ST: and **when we have so many questions like that - it’s a lot easier for everyone to get together** - because, like you said, we collaborate really well across the studios but there is something to be said for all of the people being in one place because you get this one little question here, this one little question here and before long you’re death by a thousand paper cuts... because if you’ve got to wait for two hours for that answer then you can’t just really quickly **come up with a nice design plan**. There’s things **we’re adjusting** - like the animation pipeline - to make it so that we can accomplish **all these AI and Cinematics**

*(they go on to describe software apps and experienced team members involved in animation and cinematics)*

&amp;nbsp;

While this information is disappointing, at least it should dispel any remaining myths/hopes that Sq42 will arrive later this year, although it would be nice if CIG at least confirmed it.  The [website](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/squadron42) and [previous trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FF-ewiwmhs) state 2016 ([one page still says 2015 even](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/about-the-game/community)), and the sooner the postponement is announced the better.

**DukeIronHand:** *The accepted logic is all ships maneuver better in the throttle area ""blue zone."" The center of the blue zone is a brighter blue then the rest so....is my manuverabilty better in the center of the blue zone or is my ship just as handy anywhere in the blue zone? The speed difference between the top and bottom of this blue zone can be substantial hence the question.*  

**Mike Evans:** The exact centre is where you get the best turn rates. Any deviation away from that will result in less than optimal turn rates.

&amp;nbsp;

**Morgan Grimes:** *Given that we have nothing but dead reckoning to gauge where the exact centre is can we get some sort of indicator to show when we are at optimum please? Perhaps even a small indication as to if we are above or below it as well?**  

**Mike Evans:** No, that just removes the ability for someone to be a better judge of it than someone else.

&amp;nbsp;

**Morgan Grimes:** *Okay, thanks for the response, I hadn't considered that aspect of it and was coming from a PvE view*  

**Mike Evans:** It's still a skill test against the AI too don't forget.

&amp;nbsp;

**Mephane:** *Meanwhile in keyboard land, I press a button to set the throttle to exactly 50% immediately.*  

**Mike Evans:** Yeah but it's your actual speed at the time that matters, not what speed you asked for so when you start turning you're not going to be at 50% speed anymore. A player with direct throttle control can compensate for this by adjusting their throttle to remain at 50% actual speed.

&amp;nbsp;

**FiddenUK:** *Except you can turn faster if you also make use of the relevant thruster in addition to this location on the blue throttle section.*  

**Mike Evans:** Define turn faster. If you're literally just talking about the rate your orientation changes that is entirely dependant on the blue zone only. If you're talking about the path you trace out as you're doing it, it's radius and how quickly that means you get a bead back on the opponent then you're right, multiple thrusters can help you optimise that, but it has nothing to do with turning the ship faster.",EliteDangerous,"Designer Mike Evans on the manoeuvrability ""Blue Zone""",https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/4n52eo/designer_mike_evans_on_the_manoeuvrability_blue/

It's fair to assume that most official email communications will be routed through that domain, including competitions and [Special Day gifts](https://www.elitedangerous.com/en/prefs/special-day) - although [last Friday's Newsletter](http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e&amp;id=8ee91ce7f0) wasn't sent via the new domain, that may change.  To receive such emails in their inbox, CMDRs may need to add the new domain to their junk/spam filter's allowed list.

The change follows [FDev's email server revamp](http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e&amp;id=1bbc483bb2) which occurred last month.

Where XXXXXXXXXX is a unique identifier for a CMDR.  Removing said identifier breaks the link rendering it useless, therefore we recommend simply not posting them.

&gt; **Agony_Aunt:** *Oh yeah. We can be sure of at least one complaint thread for every single modification the engineers can make once we get full details.*  
&gt; **Mike:** Holy molly that's going to be a lot of threads, might need a new sub-forum for it.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **hunvagy:** *Sounds like instead of pizzas, the people should start standing you guys flame resistant asbestos suits in preparations for those threads*  
&gt; **Mike:** If they're in their own sub-forum I can just ignore the whole thing ;)

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Red Anders:** *Yet as at least one game designer has pointed out on these forums on more than one occasion, the game is not supposed to be a hard science game. 'Closer to science than arcade games' does not mean that the game is going to be firmly rooted in science and only deviate from it very occasionally, it means that many design choices will have to be a balance between science and entertainment because the first thing FD are trying to do is make an entertaining game. There may be a market for a pure hard science game out there, in fact I'm sure there is, but if it's more than 10% of the people who play E D I would be astonished. That isn't going to pay the bills.*  
&gt; *That's why (for example) I can drive round a planet and find a meteorite on the surface which is billions of years old, yet is rich in polonium (longest half life of any polonium isotope is about 125 years...) and then drop it in my fuel tank (or refine it in some way using some completely unspecified tech) along with some other ores and increase the efficiency of my ships FSD. Because yeah, science.*  
&gt; **Mike:** Exactly this^

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **CMDR Corlas:** *For me, yes. FTL travel and healing beams occupy two totally seperate fictional mindsets for me. That's a huge part of why healbeams make me sad but limpets carrying a SCB to a targeted ship would be awesome.*  
&gt; **Mike:** I don't see how hard it is to imagine that in a universe where there are literal energy shields that can absorb and block all incoming energy by consuming from some other source of energy there couldn't be a directed beam from a third party that if tuned correctly (hence the need for a wing) could impart more energy to reconstruct said shield. It's not ""healing"" the ship, it's just recharging the shields in the same way a SCB can dump extra energy into a shield to recharge it. No shields and it's useless. Not in a wing, it's useless. Concentrating on aiming at a wing member, you're not able to attack anyone else. Get your fire groups confused, you've just attacked your wing mate.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Eymerich:** *Just a small consideration. Reading your post, and I thanks for posting here, I assume this project (beam laser recharhing shields) is completly useless for solo player. Am I Wrong?*  
&gt; **Mike:** It only works against wing members. If you're not in a wing regardless of the reason (solo or otherwise) it's not going to be able to recharge any shields. It still will be a perfectly functional weapon however.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Genar-Hofoen:** *This is a Wings-only mechanic? Has there been any thought given to player who don't want to wing up? (e.g. npc wingmen)*  
&gt; **Mike:** Yes, you don't use this. Simple.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **sleutelbos:** *HEY HO WAIT! Are you saying the Repair Beams dont automatically decide whether to heal or damage, but that the pilot has to determine the function using fire/alt fire? Thats actually new info thats pretty relevant! How would this work with turrets? Can you have repair turrets? Can you switch them between friendly/hostile? Can they track friendlies? Or are these weapons supposed to be for manual aiming? If so, will we see repair turrets in multi-crew being an option?*  
&gt; **Mike:** Not at all. If you have the wrong fire group you'll be hitting your buddy with normal weapons rather than the shield recharging one by accident. The weapon will always regenerate shields on a wing member if they have a shield active and if not won't do any damage to them at all.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Genar-Hofoen:** *So by that answer (thanks BTW), do you mean that this will not be something that lone players could use by way of NPC wing men in the future?*  
&gt; **Mike:** I'm sure if you have NPC wing men in future they would also be valid targets for this.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Infidel Deity:** *Why? When out in the rings, protecting innocent miners with families; when I see a miner soon to be gone, I can swoop in and give that miner some extra shield juice, just so the miner can get home; then attack the perpetrator.*  
&gt; **Mike:** That's not how we intend the weapon to be used. Additionally the lore suggests you need to know something very important about the target shield to help out and that information is exactly what you don't want random ships finding out as it could be used to compromise their shields.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **sleutelbos:** *Got it, thanks. I assume then that turrets will function as usual, but any accidental hits on wing-members will be auto-healing, assuming they've got shields?*  
&gt; **Mike:** Turrets will work as normal meaning that you're going to have to target a wing member to use it against them because turrets can only automatically attack hostiles assuming we don't change this behavior in future.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **sleutelbos:** *Alright. Much appreciated, wont keep you from your weekend any longer.*  
&gt; **Mike:** I'm still in work :P

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **who?:** *We don't believe you. Post a screenshot of exactly what's on your screen right now.*  
&gt; **Mike:** Don't need to, it looks exactly the same as this webpage your reading this on.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **TomP:** *@Mike Evans, just wanted to say how pleased I am to see you guys going down a more creative route than the +10% to FSD/Thrusters/DPS. That in itself has put me in a very good mood. So thanks!*  
&gt; **Mike:** Don't thank us just yet. These experimental modifications are weapon specific only at the moment and is only a small part of the engineer update. More traditional modifications that tweak the underlying stats by trading one aspect for another are also a part.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **J. Calvert (Joshua):** *If i'm not in a wing but engage a wing in battle could members of that wing use it to heal eachother?*  
&gt; **Mike:** Sure if they have them.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Banana's_Are_Good_For_You:** *This sounds cool, shield frequencies?*  
&gt; **Mike:** Basically yes. You need to sync the weapon up with their shields and the weapon is also smart enough to become harmless against hulls on wing member too when their shields are down.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Mephane:** *I see what you did there. It's a tool for wings, really. A gun that replenishes the shield of wing members and won't even do damage if their shields are down. I see you base this of some sort of hidden value (shield frequency?) which you share with your wing but no one outside is supposed to know. That's some Star Trek level handwavium so I can live with that.*  
&gt; *But wings already have the advantage in any combat situation anyway compared to a lone ship. Also, the new tool allows wings to drastically shorten downtime between fights due to slow shield regeneration. What is a lone player to do in that situation? Are we going to see an equivalent to this, a device that is activated like a weapon, consumes WEP power and replenishes our own shields? Or is this your (FD, collectively) way of ""nerfing solo"" indirectly by adding extremely useful tools for regeneration and downtime reduction unavailable to solo players?*  
&gt; **Mike:** In a wing vs lone pilot situation the lone pilot is so out gunned regardless that this additional mechanic really isn't going to make a difference. It matters in a wing vs wing situation though. Also the intent wasn't to try and nerf anything. A weapon that could regenerate shields is very powerful. We wanted to limit that and using it against wing members only is a very good way to limit it's power and can be easily contextualised to boot. Likewise if it were a global regenerating tool then we would either have to make it never do damage to anything or provide some additional mechanism to control when it hurt and when it didn't which was not desirable at all.


&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Mamif:** *With the addition of these can we PLEASE have more buttons per fire group to program weapons to? It would be nice to have all lasers (including Healy ones) on button A, cannon /multis on button B, and just Healy lasers on button C. More firegroup options plz*  
&gt; **Mike:** Nope not happening, been explained many times before. Sorry. Except my apology and move on.


&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **CMDR Corlas:** *There are situations though in which a lone skilled pilot is able to take down two winged ships in PvP. Plenty of videos out there. I'm happy that you recognize how powerful a tool this could be, a lot of my frustration has been people not understanding that at all, and I like that you're trying to limit it's use. But coordinated PvP teams already have a huge advantage on everyone else, and I'm worried about them just being given more of an advantage, especially one that can so easily overwrite player skill from the other side. Is there at least any way to counter the healing that the opposing ships could be doing? Part of the appeal of shield-cell hauling limpets for me is that you could counter them by shooting the limpets.*  
&gt; **Mike:** The counter is that the guy doing the ""healing"" is basically out of the fight and is a sitting duck and should be the number one target.


&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Thetele:** *Mike are you sure you can talk about these things? You give more info than we have got during last couple months. Now let me try get some more. Are these recharge lasers aka ""healing lasers"" coming as modification to all beam laser sizes small, medium, large, huge? Don't worry no one will hear if you answer.*  
&gt; **Mike:** All beam laser sizes can support this mod. Whether you can easily or even deliberately acquire said mod is another matter ;)


&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Rubbernuke:** *Can these specialist lasers be improved / tweaked again via engineers, or are they a one shot deal (pun fully intended?)*  
&gt; **Mike:** No, they can't be tweaked again, you'll basically strip the weapon first if you want to apply a different (or even the same) modification again.


&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **lefty1117:** *Mike, can we assume that a weapon with this mod will have a lower damage output as a balancing method?*  
&gt; **Mike:** Nope you can't assume that.


&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Rubbernuke:** *Nice, thanks! Last question: is the size of the laser important, or are these mods restricted to certain classes?*  
&gt; **Mike:** Mods like this are not size restricted as mentioned above. They're weapon type restricted mind.


&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Muetdhiver:** *Then again, if there are 30 of them, where is the harm if a dozen are coop focused ?*  
&gt; **Mike:** Only two mods (so far) are wing restricted.


&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **T.j:** *Wings Restricted: You promised not to tell anyone.  :D*  
&gt; **Mike:** Did I?  ;)

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Genar-Hofoen:** *Oh all right then this is begging for it.... What's the other wing-restricted mod?*  
&gt; **Mike:** Wait and see ;)

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Mephane:** *Erm, I very much hope the acquisition of modifications is always deliberate. Are you implying this is a upgrade gamble, hand in materials and get 1 out of 10 possible modifications, randomly selected?*  
&gt; **Mike:** Normal modifications are deliberate albeit with some procedural sprinkles on top. Regenerating Sequence is not a normal modification and is not so deliberate. It's one of the reasons why it isn't going to be as big an issue as some people are making out even if it did work exactly how they don't want it too

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Liqua:** *The weapon sounds great for winged people - I hope there is something for the lone wolf / solo player too*  
&gt; **Sandro:** There is.

Vive's price includes the room sensors, controllers &amp; front-facing camera. It is officially supported by ED, alongside many other SteamVR-compatible games. Starts shipping April.

Rift CV1's $599 (£530 in UK) price excludes their Touch controllers due for release late 2016. Official ED support is in development, and Oculus have a few exclusive VR titles lined up. Existing pre-orders ship end-March onwards; New pre-orders ship late July.

OSVR is considerably cheaper at $299, but currently has a lower-specification screen (similar to Rift DK2). Compatible with SteamVR, so works with ED and many other titles.

P.S. ED is widely rated as the best AAA VR game available, and in VR is astonishingly good :)

[Elite Dangerous CQC Mayhem](http://i.imgur.com/KAWYR1d.jpg)

Some of you may remember the action-packed schedule of events we ran last year called Mayhem. Because it was such a huge success, with hundreds of Commanders, streamers and community groups taking part, we've decided to do it again!

CQC Mayhem will run for four weeks, beginning on Tuesday February 16, ending on Tuesday March 15.

Check back on this page next week to see the CQC Mayhem schedule start to grow, we'll also put the full schedule in next week's newsletter. This time we're putting a focus on CQC, and we need your help making it the biggest schedule of Elite Dangerous events yet! Send your CQC event and stream submissions to community@frontier.co.uk with the subject title 'CQC Mayhem'. You can submit as many or as few streams/events as you want between the dates listed above. Just let us know the details of your events and we'll add you to the schedule.

Not only will you feature on our schedule alongside the amazing Elite Dangerous community and our official streams, but your event will also be promoted on our official social media pages. Get in touch to find out more about some of the incentives we're offering to get people involved.

We're kicking things off on Tuesday night at 6PM GMT with [the Danger Zone live stream](https://www.youtube.com/user/FrontierDevelopments/live), which you can read more about further down in the newsletter.

###Copy pasta of Michael's responses from the [forum thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=231826) about [today's Dev Update](https://redd.it/45934y):

&gt; **jgm:** *Will there be any material impact on a player if they are hated or disliked by a faction over being neutral with them?*

&gt; **Michael:** Yes - annoy them too much and you will no longer be welcome. It will also affect what missions they offer you.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Ragnascot:** *Any news on xbox horizons would be wonderful*

&gt; **Michael:** Nothing to report at the moment, we will announce any news as soon as we're ready to.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Eyes0fTheS0UTH:** *This is all isolated to Horizons players?*

&gt; **Michael:** No - except for any planet side missions.

&gt; ***

&gt; **xdemetrios:** *Is there anything in the works as far as ""assigning"" yourself to a minor faction so that it is visible to other players in game?*

&gt; **Michael:** I'd love to add a pledge to a minor faction function, but it's not planned in the near future yet.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Falkrum:** *Will we see in 2.1 fix for incorrect info of systems that have changed their government or allegiance? There info not updated at the moment.*

&gt; **Michael:** That's a caching issue that I believe has been fixed for 2.1.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Rob_the_Sparky:** *At the moment the minor faction reputation = major faction reputation for aligned factions. Any plans to separate this? If not do these reputation changes only really apply to independent minor factions?*

&gt; **Michael:** Yes - we'll separate superpower and minor faction reputations.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Marra:** *will the black market and combat bond contacts be represented by NPCs with faces too?*

&gt; **Michael:** Not yet, but eventually all contacts that are people will have faces.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Eera:** *What about mission credit reward increasing?*

&gt; **Michael:** I will be talking about mission rewards in a future update.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Cmdr. Numa:** *Will the new weapons come fixed only or gimballed too? Turreted would probably be silly.*

&gt; **Michael:** Fixed only at the moment. Gimballed doesn't really work well at that size, but we're investigating.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Alien:** *I'm still wondering why Edward Lewis (or Zac) posts Michael's updates and not Michael himself. It isn't because Michael can't post on the forum, because he can. If Michael wrote it, he must have sent it to Ed (or Zac) to be posted on the forum, so I don't see what difference pasting it into a forum post would make over sending it to Ed. Michael, I know you're not lazy, so please, why?*

&gt; **Michael:** Because it's copied from the community site and Zac's team handle all that - I have enough to do!

&gt; ***

&gt; **grunchlk:** *So if I read the meaning correctly, we are getting Huge and Large Multi-cannon. Is that correct?*

&gt; **Michael:** Yes.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Retrograde:** *It would seem reasonable that certain shady types would prefer not to post their face on a public board. For the criminal or undercover factions, how about not showing a face until you've done some work for them? You'd need to prove your trustworthiness first.*

&gt; **Michael:** No need - they'll just send somebody expendable to deal with you.

&gt; ***

&gt; **aymerix:** *Do we find engineers in systems with permits (Achenar, SOL ...)?*

&gt; **Michael:** They can be in permit locked systems.

&gt; ***

&gt; **pokkits:** *if you are adding an additional level to the rep ladder, are mission/rep/rank rewards also scaling with a player's progression? I'm all in favor of difficulty scaling up if the rewards scale up with it to match. Just adding an additional rung to the ladder without fixing the rate at which one can climb it just seems like making the grind longer for its own sake, which is bound to frustrate a lot of players.*

&gt; **Michael:** As mentioned earlier, I'll go into more details about rewards in a future update.

&gt; ***

&gt; **InMemoriamSirocco:** *Will the classic bulletin board return at some point, maybe containing missions for private contractors not related to any faction? As an alternative to official missions?*

&gt; **Michael:** We'll stick with the new mission board for now.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Heater:** *will the current Rep with the minor faction's carry over to the new missions? or will it be cleared?*

&gt; **Michael:** We're planning to maintain the current rep level, although whether that contains the superpower component remains to be seen.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Javert:** *Would it be safe to assume that all these mission changes are part of the reason why some of the mission bugs in 2.0 have not been patched already (e.g. the ""Mission Specific"" missions that can't be completed). I'm guessing that all these changes will override that stuff anyway so it's not worth spending the time to fix them?*

&gt; **Michael:** Yes - we're overhauling some of the framework as well to address the issues.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Huros:** *Will naval progression be handled in a more ""career orientated"" manner as you have eluded to previously, as of 2.1? And will there therefore be exclusivity in the relationship?*

&gt; **Michael:** That's not part of 2.1.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Colonel Kenney:** *So far we've only seen the framework of the missions improving.  What about the quality, quantity, duration and character of the missions? Are they going to improve or change dramatically?*

&gt; **Michael:** In many respects yes - there are still a ton more details to come. However if you're expecting a campaign mode style missions this isn't happening. However it's being balanced that working with minor factions should evolve a narrative with them.

&gt; ***

&gt; **DrSpin:** *Especially the news that a lot of stuff is coming to Season 1 (but then again, I expect positive news about the OSX version of Horizons is probably imminent, right Michael? Right? ;-) )*

&gt; **Michael:** There's no news on OSX Horizons I'm afraid.

&gt; ***

&gt; **sergeantmarcel:** *Will the new missions also give the feeling that it's less repetitive as the current method? (And therefore making current feel like a grind)*

&gt; **Michael:** They'll have more purpose and direction which will help with this.",EliteDangerous,Michael Brookes' Q&amp;A about Dev Update 11/02/15,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/45a7za/michael_brookes_qa_about_dev_update_110215/

* Client = ED game running on a CMDR's computer
* Server = ED's Transaction Server, hosted on the Amazon Web Services platform
* C/S = Client/Server networking
* P2P = Peer-To-Peer networking
* PvP = Player vs Player
* PwP = Player with Player, i.e. co-operative play
* SI = Shared Instance, containing a number of CMDRs
* LostCMDR = a CMDR who's lost connectivity

***

#First of all, the good news

Contrary to what some CMDRs say, this isn't something that ""can never be fixed cos P2P"":

* ED uses a hybrid C/S and P2P networking model.
* If the Server is down or not contactable, ED isn't playable.
* Key game actions are authorised using C/S: logging in/out, buying/selling a commodity, buying/selling an upgrade, jumping to a system, etc.
* PvP and PwP fights are authorised using P2P between Clients (without the Server).

***

#Combat logging in Open play, using existing mechanics

Currently, when a CMDR logs out cleanly to the Main Menu, their Client authorises this with the Server.  Meanwhile, when an another Client loses P2P connection their ship will sit dormant for 10-15 seconds, then disappear from the instance. In both situations however, the SI CMDRs have no real idea what happened.

ED should instead inform SI CMDRs how the LostCMDR departed the SI.

###Clean logout, to main menu:

* The Server authorised the Clean logout.
* The Server tells all SI Clients this.
* All SI Clients see the LostCMDR's ship replaced with a Yellow coloured Wake.
* All CMDRs know what occurred.
* Yellow Wake events are tallied by the Server, which could inform FDev Support if thresholds are reached.

###Dirty logout, via crash or loss of connection:

* The Server doesn't know as it wasn't asked by LostCMDR's Client to authorise to logout.
* Other SI Clients know *something happened* as no P2P data is being received from the LostCMDR.
* SI Clients begin a re-connection timeout - 15 seconds currently - to re-establish P2P connection to the LostCMDR.
* During timeout, e.g. after 3 seconds, a message appears in top-right panel of SI CMDRs, e.g. ""LostCMDR's ship has stopped responding"".
* All SI Clients inform the Server of a time-stamped ""stopped-responding event"" by LostCMDR.
* If LostCMDR's ship is targeted by another CMDR, it could have a different coloured reticule/icon.
* If LostCMDR's ship is destroyed prior to the timeout ending, the SI Clients' tell the Server of the destruction, whereby bounties, fines, etc can be authorised. When LostCMDR logs back in they're met with the rebuy screen.
* Assuming LostCMDR's ship survives the timeout, all SI Clients see it replaced with a Red coloured Wake, and they tell the Server to time-stamp a Red Wake event.
* All CMDRs know what occurred.
* The Server knows what occurred.
* Stopped-Responding and Red Wake events are tallied by the Server, which informs FDev Support when thresholds are reached, who take action accordingly on CMDRs - shadow banning, etc.

Furthermore, the Open Play logout timer could be increased to 30 seconds, which would affect both clean and dirty logouts.

If a CMDR is encountering poor internet stability, they should be playing in Solo, because they otherwise spoil their and others' gameplay.  Even so, when in Open they should be suffering random disconnects outside of combat too, e.g. at stations with other CMDRs present.  Assuming these are also logged by the Server, FDev support will have the necessary information to determine that someone isn't a prolific Combat Logger, just needs a better connection.

Once these improvements are in-place, FDev should have the confidence to take appropriate hardline action on Dirty logouts. We'll see Combat Logging discouraged, and the number of CMDRs doing it reduced to almost zero.  As per the TOS, with enough proof of someone cheating/exploiting (Combat Logging), FDev can revoke the CMDR's licence to play ED - effectively banning them from the game.

***

#Combat logging in Private Group play, using new mechanics

The above improvements don't fully solve all the issues with Private groups however, as they may have different rulesets to be adhered to - like no PvP whatsoever.

Private Group owners can simply kick rule breakers from their group, but it doesn't discourage actions taking place.

###As /u/Antmax suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/43iyfd/fd_affiliate_and_well_known_streamer_caught_on/czir4x9), Private Groups could have customisable PvP ruleset options:

* [Tickbox] PvP allowed within Anarchy systems.
* [Tickbox] PvP allowed within HazRES.
* [Tickbox] PvP allowed within Combat Zones.

###These would help protect CMDRs from infiltrating-griefers:

* While in Group play, a CMDR attacks/destroys another CMDR.
* The SI Clients - attacker, victim, witnesses - inform the Server.
* The Server checks the Group's ruleset to see if it's allowed.
* If a rule breach has occurred, the attacking CMDR is immediately logged out, and kicked from the group.
* Rule breaches are tallied by the Server, which informs FDev Support when thresholds are reached, who take action accordingly on CMDRs - shadow banning, etc.",EliteDangerous,"How Combat Logging can be ""fixed"" using existing and new in-game mechanics",https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/441dqh/how_combat_logging_can_be_fixed_using_existing/

The vast majority (~99%) of posts and comments don't require moderating, so a **MASSIVE THANKYOU** to everyone in our great CMDR community, stay awesome!

At a guess I've removed ~300 posts/comments that broke [the rules](/r/EliteDangerous/w/rules), and PM'd ~50 CMDRs to make minor modifications for their content to be approved.  My fellow Mods will have each done the same or more.  If you see a post/comment that you think may breach a rule, please report it for us to check out.

Our aim of course is to for everyone to enjoy discussing ED-related topics, in a civil fashion, and keep the New feed clean of spam and junk posts.  Removing an interesting post is our last option.  Please message us if you feel a removal is unwarranted, and we'll happily advise alterations to allow re-approval.

(I've added the useful info to my [monster Horizons &amp; Season 2 post](https://redd.it/407t02))

&gt; **Colonel Kenney:** *That covers the crafting part of it! What about the looting? How will we loot stuff? Sounds like this is going to be a very small part of the game. Not like you destroy ships and pick up parts. Or find a crashed wreck with a class 3 beam laser with extra damage. It all has to be through a few scattered people who may or may not like you. So its going to be difficult...*

&gt; **Michael:** The loot aspect is separate, you will collect the materials in a similar fashion to Horizons, but some will also be collectable in space. I'll go into more detail in a future update.

***

&gt; **GTuk (ME!):** *Quick clarification: does this mean Engineers (i.e. crafting) will be inaccessible to non-Horizons CMDRs, as in no Engineer will be located in an orbiting Station/Outpost? If so, is it just a portion of Loot (from Loot &amp; Crafting) that will be available to basegame CMDRs?*

&gt; **Michael:** Yes - certainly to start with.

***

&gt; **Dakron Nova:** *Is there any news on the persistent POI/Barnacle problem (the issue is logged)? Im still stuck you in a nebula searching but am I wasting my time, should I just head back to the bubble for now and get on with something else? This seems to be affecting multiple commanders.*

&gt; **Michael:** We're still working on it.

***

&gt; **Bambi:** *This is a very bad idea: 30 / 19000(populated systems) = ~0.0016. Less than 1 in 600 systems will have engineering available, a player could play hundreds of hours and never see a single engineer. I hope you understand your mistake.*

&gt; **Michael:** They will be shown in the galaxy map.

***

&gt; **Simon Darkstep:** *May we inquire if the datalink auto-deploy bug is among the ones fixed?*

&gt; **Michael:** Not for the minor release, but is fixed for the next major release.

***

&gt; **FatRillos:** *Kind of garbage the new content is behind an expansion paywall.*

&gt; **Michael:** It's the expansion that is funding the new content and don't forget that a lot of the mission changes will be available to all players.

***

&gt; **Marc_Hicks:** *I suspect that, as with the factions, engineers will have a fairly granular level of response-based on more than one factor. Yet I suspect someone with no rep at all will still be able to obtain services from said engineers....it will probably just cost more &amp; take longer to complete the job!*

&gt; **Michael:** You need to match their minimum requisite to access their services - this will vary between engineers.

***

&gt; **wally walford:** *Will next weeks update be addressing the long overdue fixes to the back ground sim? if so i would like to know as we are currently compiling an extensive bug report and tracking the data for the BGS, and while it is still incomplete if it would help would be willing to pass on the data we have already recorded*

&gt; **Michael:** Yes - definitely post your details in the bug reporting forum - details are always useful.

***

&gt; **wstephenson:** *FD, do you envision having CGs to enable new Engineers in future? Would be a nice bit of story-based play.*

&gt; **Michael:** That's one of the mechanisms we're considering for adding new engineers.

***

&gt; **DrSpin:** *So, inaccessible to mac players then. Is there no news on the mac version? You said you were speaking with Apple about finding a solution - is there nothing to report?*

&gt; **Michael:** There's no news on this yet.

***

&gt; **tntfoz:** *When interacting with an engineer that you don't meet the requirements for, will the game tell you what those requirements are (e.g. Combat rank = Dangerous or higher), or will the players be guessing? You also mentioned that better ranks/stats will enable better blueprints from the engineer. Will this information be available to the player also (i.e. will we see what higher ranks will get us from that engineer even if we don't have those ranks yet?)?*

&gt; **Michael:** You will be informed of requirements and what is available.

***

&gt; **Phil\^:** *My main thought regarding this is simple - Will your ""reputation/rating"" with these newly introduced characters also be subject to decay. For people who dont get much chance to play due to work or similar commitments - its a perpetually uphill struggle to maintain ratings with factions both minor and major, so if character reputations also decay in real time then thats one more area where the 'casual' player wont be able to keep up with. For example, for the last few months I'm lucky if I can get 2-3 hours per week to play - so any effort I make to get myself back to allied status is ultimately futile since it all goes over the rest of the week. Perhaps its time to make the decay based on game play time rather than real life time elapsed?*

&gt; **Michael:** They aren't decay based relationships, however in some cases it will be possible to upset them in some way, but that's determined by actions, not inaction.

***

&gt; **Heater:** *I Understand the game must move forward to make-it, but please fix what is in the game before adding more content. Just look at the bug reports, where most are the same bug over and over and a lot of them have been there from the beta's and are still there. Do not get me wrong I have over 1900 hours in the game, and still am playing, BUT it's getting to the point of losing interest.*

I've included the thread's opening post for context, and corrected typo's where applicable.

&amp;nbsp;

###First part of OP:

&gt; So I'd like to share a concern I have with regards to the game and how I think certain players or groups appear to have privileged access and influence, and I'd like to get your thoughts on the issue. Before I get started I'd like to make it clear that I have no issue with any player or group in particular, in fact I long argued for guilds and emergent game-play for ED, etc..

&gt; What appears to be happening here is that Frontier will, upon request, initiate certain favours for a group, as a thank you for something they deem favourably, or implement a suggestion they happen to like etc... On the face of it these things appear to be benign but I don't think they are even if the intentions of the developers were well intended.

&gt; As it stands certain groups are afforded privileged status and I believe there is a special section on the forums which is invite only for leaders of particular groups Frontier deem worthy. With groups being allocated a ranking.

###Middle - the contents of an official email sent out to Player-Group Leaders many months back:

&gt; This email is just a little bit of information about Player Group Ranks and what that means. We initially talked about player group ranks on this forum thread: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=167459 

&gt; We’ve had an amazing number of groups register and it’s delightful to see so many different styles of play and activity covered amongst them. 

&gt; In order to make sure that we’re able to support as many community groups as possible we’ve got some ranks and rewards. We’ve listed them at the bottom of this email. The main use of group rankings are internal but there are some benefits for group leaders that grow and develop their way up to the higher ranks. Every group is still able to submit for CGs, Minor Factions and ultimately contest to become a power. 

&gt; We’ve put your rank down currently as ‘Dangerous’. This is the basic level of group meaning that you have direct contact details for the CM team and we will be informing you of updates and news that you can get involved in like the mayhem events I emailed about earlier. The Dangerous groups range from being small groups of 3 or 4 up to groups a little under 100 people. This is the type of rank for groups that want to be included in the conversation but aren’t as large or active as some of the larger groups. 

&gt; We’re happy to review, discuss or change ranks if you feel the rank should be different for your group. Remember that with so many groups registered we had to draw an initial line and we could possibly have overlooked some groups. 

&gt; The finalized ranks and details are below. 

&gt; **Dangerous** - Dangerous groups are anyone that wants to be a part of the conversation. The only requirements are that you have a group and want to hear more news and updates from us. These groups will be added to the database and contacted via email when there are events, incentives or information that they might like to know about. What Dangerous groups can expect from us… 

&gt; * Regular communications about groups and events
&gt; * Direct contact with CM

&gt; **Elite** - Elite groups are groups that have an established and thriving sub-community. They might have an estimate of about 100+ member (but not always), run regular events which can be promoted and are supportive of the ED team and community. These groups will be able to submit their activity to us to be promoted in our newsletters, social media or an events schedule which will be creating in the coming weeks. What Elite groups can expect from us… 

&gt; * Community site promotional placement
&gt; * Social Media promotion and inclusion in comms chatter for key events where possible
&gt; * Access to group leaders’ private forum 
&gt; * Access to competition and event prizing at Frontier Developments’ discretion

&gt; **Triple Elite** - The largest and most engaged sub communities belong in the ranks of Triple Elite. They are likely to have a huge and super-active community, with many hundreds of active members and are a positive influence to Frontier and the community as a whole.  What Triple Elite groups can expect from us… 

&gt; * Everything in the Dangerous and Elite categories
&gt; * Premium Social Promotion
&gt; * VIP invitation to Community Events
&gt; * Invitation to monthly Group Summit meetings hosted by CM on Skype with potential guest speakers

###Final part of OP:

&gt; I do find all of this confusing and incoherent because for as long as I can remember during development FD did virtually all they could to not have the game based around groups or clans etc..

&gt; In all the online games I've played a situation like this has never occurred so hopefully people will understand where I am coming from; I expect for all players, and groups/guilds to be equally treated by the developers; Indeed, any achievements or influence should come down to what occurs in gameplay. For example, with EvE you'd gain control of an area and keep it by merit and playing the game, in WoW you'd be the first to down a boss etc.. . In ED we send a message to the devs and ask nicely for something? For a game where we are supposed to have ultimate freedom to blaze our own trail is this how its meant to work?

&gt; Another thing that I find troublesome is the implementation of player factions. Again, this is all so incoherent because apparently the game isn't meant to be group controlled. Certain groups have their faction at some rather important areas and I find in some situations the location offers said group an advantage over others. Whilst I won't go through them all there is presently one group (just for example purposes there are others of concern) who has their name plastered all over the starting area of the game. 

&gt; No matter how well intended said group might be.. does this not give them an advantage over others? And does planting certain groups factions at key or iconic locations in game represent fairness?

&gt; I just can't think of any other game where this occurs so maybe I don't quite get it. Nevertheless its something that doesn't sit quite right. So, what do you think? Have I got this all wrong?

&amp;nbsp;

###Zac's reply to Cosmos' OP:

&gt; Hi Cosmos,

&gt; Thanks for asking the question. I'm more than happy to address any concerns here as I feel really strongly that working with groups - and the way we work with them - is of huge benefit to the game and community as a whole. Sorry if the reply seems a little long but I wanted to make sure to address it fully. :)

&gt; We work with groups for a few reasons. The first and most obvious is that working with groups means that people who wish to play together in groups can get support. We've done a lot last year to work with groups and we want to continue that this year.

&gt; Yes, Elite Dangerous is all about being able to play your own way. People can decide to play on their own and that's fine. However, if people want to play together (I know I personally find it more fun) then we need to be able to help make sure that people can find and get involved in this and that we support the events, competitions and other activities they create. :)

&gt; Ultimately we want groups to be running events, supporting players and creating more fun ways to play. There is no ulterior motive to it, for us it's ALL about creating more fun and enjoyment within the community. I hope you can see why this is important for everyone.

&gt; On to the actual way that the groups are managed. The email you pasted isn't really very different to the public forum post that was made here in July last year. It's important to remember that no one, with any ""tier"", receives preferential treatment. By this I mean that no group will be able to put in game suggestions and change the shape or direction of the game. All of the things such as suggesting CGs, submitting game feedback etc are all open to everyone and we don't have open channels for this only for group leaders.

&gt; To help make it clearer, I thought I would list out some of the activities that happen with groups along with an explanation of why. :)

&gt; **A private forum** - This is for group leaders to be able to discuss political matters. and group related content. This is no different from other private forums that we have for other purposes. Such as a video makers forum for people who are part of the pioneer program. The vast majority of group leaders have access to this forum and only have to request access if they are on the groups register.

&gt; **A monthly skype chat** - Some of the largest and most active groups have a monthly skype chat (dropped off at the end of last year). These are the largest or more active groups and we focus on community group related activity. It's an opportunity to talk about what type of events the groups are running and how we can promote these events across the community so everyone knows about them and can get involved. These are groups that we know have ran multiple events successfully and we know that events that they run will happen, will be ran to a high standard and are a fun experience for players to go to. This also allows us to talk about upcoming events. For example, the 24 hour charity livestream. So many groups helped take part in that and make it a real success. Another example might be the Mayhem events last year where 40 odd events happened over 2 weeks to help test the new updates.

&gt; **Prizing** - We offer prizing for anyone looking to make events and competitions that will be fun for the community. Larger groups are more likely to get more prizes (say 3 prizes rather than 1) because we know the events they run have more attendees. However we're also very supportive of ALL community events to help grow the groups.

&gt; **Promotion** - We offer promotion on Social Media and newsletters to all groups as well as things like Educating Ed as this is a great way to highlight the amazing community we have. This is something that everyone can get and anyone with a good event or submission can send it in, Ultimately we just like to highlight great content. It's really that simple.

&gt; **Entry to events** - We sometimes offer invitations to events as we think it’s important that large groups have representation when we are running events. One great example of this is EGX. As well as livestreaming the event, we also wanted to make sure that some groups and streamers were reserved a seat if they were coming to EGX so they could also see the panel live and be able to inform their communities. We had people from foreign language communities as well as video makers who then went on to stream from the event.

&gt; Supporting and growing areas such as groups (as well as video makers) is an important part of supporting your community. Don't get me wrong we host a lot of our official content too. Things like CQC beat the devs, tournaments, Christmas events, competitions, launch livestreams/interviews, Q&amp;A's, AMAs, sneak peeks etc etc etc but it is also important to support areas of your community where people want to come and play together. A lot of places and studios will have an identical system but keep the information hidden away with the community. I would much rather have an open, honest and transparent system.

&gt; I truly believe it's beneficial to everyone that we support groups as long as that level of support is specific and tailored to them. We're really lucky to have an amazing community, and we really love being able to come up with new and exciting ways for people to enjoy the game. We have a lot of great plans for 2016 and I'm looking forward to being able to show you those as they happen. :)

&gt; It's certainly not a case of special treatment instead it's more about having an **inclusive** network of groups that **anyone** can get involved in, where everyone can get access to promotion, tools and other things that will help them run their groups and highlight activity that people would want to know about.

&gt; Sorry for the ramble, thanks for taking the time to read and I hope that helps answer your question.

&gt; Thanks,

&gt; Zac

###And Zac's replies to other questions/comments:

&gt; **Bran Tse Mallory:** *Thanks OP for posting this. I had previously mentioned in several posts that I had a feeling that some groups were trying to gain influence within FD. Now it seems it is the other way round. I have first hand knowledge of how this plays out and it's never good for the average player or the health of the game IMO. Leave's me with just one thought.*

&gt; *Goodbye Open.*

&gt; *What's the point of playing a game where there are a group of players being given special attention - we all paid for the game, we are all customers, we all deserve the same level of product. Epic Fail FD.*

&gt; **Zac:** Rest assured this has nothing to do with game modes.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Cosmos:** *Funny thing is I'm really keen and like the community managers in Ed and Zac. I think the level of connection with the community has vastly improved under their efforts. Its why despite this post I do find it hard to criticise - but I'm trying to do it constructively whilst being frank about things. I love Ed and Zac a lot  They have been great for the game and community imo.*

&gt; **Zac:** Thanks. I should also say (as a few people seem unsure) the community team is currently 4 people:

&gt; * Myself
&gt; * Ed - Livestreams and content
&gt; * Dale - Social Media
&gt; * Brett - Forum Manager

&gt; ***

&gt; **Finchywinchy:** *Hmm. Sounds like they're developing the metagame so they don't have to develop the actual game. Pity. If that's a concern for them, they should open the game up to modding, so all those folks working on fleshing out the fantasy could work on something tangible instead.*

&gt; **Zac:** Actually it's two different areas of the studio. The developers focus on creating content and have a large team actively working on updates every day and are working extremely hard.

&gt; The groups are ran by the community team and for us, it's about coming up with new and exciting ways to help players have fun in the game. The community team also work extremely hard.

&gt; ***

&gt; **Cosmos:** *I think we could do better in making them than having to send in an email request. No group should have better treatment than any other. In fact I have never seen anything like this in my entire life and its baffling this is even half way acceptable.*

&gt; *Nothing wrong with having a community spot light or promoting an event a group or player might have going. But when some have preferential treatment which includes influencing the outcomes or events in game and those things aren't afforded to all. I'd say thats not a fair situation, and it smacks of favouritism and bias.*

&gt; **Zac:** Having an ability for groups to be able to register themselves and for people to be able to find a group that suits them would be great. It's something I would like to see happen. However, we also have to realise that with all the other requests on dev time, this is something that has to be considered along with all the other requested updates, content, fixes and tweaks. For me, the email solution is only to be able to start getting in touch with and talking to groups. As mentioned there is zero favouritism involved in this process. The point you made about being able to influence outcomes of events in game. This simply doesn't happen.

&gt; Unless you're talking about people suggesting CGs but this happens all the time from all players. Like the station nebula for example.

&gt; The aim is much more about the community spotlight and promotion.",EliteDangerous,"Zac Antonaci on: Player Groups and supporting their in-game events, competitions and activities",https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/41kh9e/zac_antonaci_on_player_groups_and_supporting/

And two notices, first from Zac:

&gt; Hey guys, 

&gt; As promised we've discussed the topic for you all, sorry for the delay in replies, but today was the first available opportunity to review the thread. 

&gt; People are free to continue use of the existing companion app API, though please be aware this is something we hope to expand and improve on the future. Since we don’t yet have a date for that, use of the existing one is fine, but we ask that you do so in a careful and considered manner – for example not polling it continuously. We will bring in guidelines and an approval process over time too, but for now please be aware that we will stop apps that are not well behaved.

&gt; We are passionate about the development of community created content and very much see the value in the tools that are being created which is why we are happy for this API to be continued. As we have mentioned before, we would like to create a new API which allows tool developers support to create their own tools but this will not be a short term implementation and is instead something we are considering for future development.

&gt; Thanks for your patience, we will keep you informed as and when we have more information to share.

&gt; Zac Antonaci

And Brett:

&gt; Here's a few ground rules to this forum:

&gt; * Using the current API in a malicious way or to cause a severe degradation of services will result in your discussions to be removed/moderated. Further action may be deemed necessary depending on the severity. 
&gt; * This forum is here on a beta basis. We may decide to archive this forum in the future if things do not work out.
&gt; * All tools are considered third party. If a tool that you are using somehow breaks your game client or your computer or the space time continuum... it will fall on you to talk to the app developer to rectify the problem. 
&gt; * Using this forum section to continuously harass app creators WILL result in complete viewing and posting restriction of your forum account to this forum area.
&gt; * Hammering the current API server with requests will result with us severely limiting the service. Please do not abuse it. 

&gt; Thank you!

If you have any questions either post them directly in the forum thread, or here &amp; I'll copy them over.

&amp;nbsp;

**Joss C. K.:** *Are they handcrafted or generated? (the characters)*

**Michael:** A mixture of both, but predominantly generated.

***

**RealDB:** *I wonder, will it be possible to use the Commander Creator to develop profiles for leaders of the player group minor factions so they can be represented in-game? As in will you be willing to accept those from player groups for implementation into the game?*

**Michael:** For minor factions they are generated, certainly for the immediate future.

***

**Rudolphus:** *when you are a founder of a minor faction does that have impact on the recognize part or start you like everyone from scratch building up reputation.*

**Michael:** No - you'll need to build the reputation, but other things will also impact how they treat you.

***

**djh:** *This is a great and long-awaited plan. But as I said in the Reddit post that you're referencing, I think the visibility of your contact's face should not be an immediate option when you check the Bulletin Board. It would make more sense that it occurs once you've built trust with the recruiter after successfully completing their missions.  After all, where in the real world can you check a Bulletin Board and see the photo of the anonymous person asking you to commit a crime? So Michael, can you confirm that there is a progressive reveal of the mission contacts, as well as the aforementioned hierarchy of mission contacts?*

**Michael:** You'll be able to see the face of your contact, but the contact will change according to your relationship with them.

***

**Momoka Azuka:** *The Character creator is the next update? Please tell me this will release after 14/2/2016 otherwise I may miss my own wedding.*

**Michael:** No - we're using some of the technology to put faces to mission givers and mechanics - the Commander Creator will come later in the season.

***

**Ziljan:** *Will these be persistent NPCs for a given faction? Or will we see a new face each time we interact? Also, is this just when docked at stations or also for NPC pilots?*

**Michael:** They are persistent for each minor faction, although there will be a different character for each of the ranks within the minor faction. These are for the station based mission givers for now.

***

**Marc_Hicks:** *You mentioned in your last Dev Update how you want the BGS to be more ""visible"" to players. Do you envisage the personalities as being part of the way of doing that? As an example, a system in famine might have a talking head clearly underfed, or an outbreak state having a talking head wearing a mask or visibly diseased.*

**Michael:** Yes, we want the minor faction contacts to provide more information about states and changes relating to that minor faction.

***

**Marc_Hicks:** *In Elite II: Frontier, sometimes when you took or completed certain missions, you'd have bounty hunters or assassins sent by an opponent to kill you for taking missions with the wrong people. Any chance we will see this kind of thing in upcoming updates?*

**Michael:** This already happens in game, but is something we're likely to use more of down the line.

***

**Kris:** *The way i read it will it be 1 NPC for Neutral, 1 for Friendly, and 1 for Allied status?*

**Michael:** It'll be a bit more granular than that, but we're still working on the implementation.",EliteDangerous,Michael Brookes answers some questions about yesterday's Dev Update,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/412l2p/michael_brookes_answers_some_questions_about/

#Horizons, aka Season 2

Following 2.0 Planetary Landings, there will be 4 further expansions within the Horizons season of 2016, free to all owners of EDH [^src](http://www.idigitaltimes.com/elite-dangerous-horizons-might-finally-fill-those-empty-seats-your-ship-473930). They are named and scheduled as follows: ^FS

* 2.1 The Engineers - Q1/Spring
* 2.2 Guardians - Q2/Summer
* 2.3 The Commanders - Q3/Autumn
* 2.4 ??? - Q4/Winter

While each expansion contains new major features - generally available to Horizons CMDRs only - they also will contain many other basegame gameplay/content improvements and additions, **available free to all CMDRs** in Elite Dangerous.

~~Based on the release timescales of 2.1 and previous 1.x updates, it can be assumed that 2.2/2.3/2.4 will be respectively released in Q2/Q3/Q4, with 2.4 arriving in December alongside 3.0 (for owners of the LTXP and Season 3 pre-orders).  For basegame-only-CMDRs the updates will likely be respectively numbered in-game 1.6/1.7/1.8/1.9 (and 1.10, 1.11, etc for Season 3 onwards).~~

###Power Play Specific - very likely, discussions on-going since July 2015 [^src](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=169489)

* More missions, variety and rewards.
* Interdiction and spawning rebalancing, with home systems becoming significantly safer.
* Each time a CMDR earns a Merit, they also earn a Favour.
   * Unlike Merit, Favour does not decay – it’s a permanent resource.
   * At any time during a cycle, a CMDR could ""spend"" favour to trigger an individual rating’s benefits until the next cycle.
   * The cost of triggering a rating’s benefits significantly more than the merit total required to activate them, keeping merits as the ""supercharged"" currency of Powerplay.
* Ability to toggle Powerplay status to be active or hidden, through either an option/decal/skin.
   * Significant enforced cool downs when hiding your Powerplay status before you get the benefits.
* Ability to ""up vote"" or ""down vote"" a system involved in Powerplay action.
   * Other CMDRs from your power would see this up/down-vote data as a very clean, contextual communication of ideas.
   * Importantly, you’d be able to see totals for both up/down votes for systems involved with Powerplay.
   * E.g.1: if one of your power’s control systems had a tremendous amount of down votes, you could clearly infer that many supporters considered fortifying this system as a waste of time.
   * E.g.2: Lots of ""down votes"" on an enemy control system would indicate that undermining it would not be appreciated.
* Outside of Powerplay, CMDRs can pledge as a System's Freedom Fighter.
   * As a Freedom Fighter, a CMDR can Undermine and Oppose for the system they had pledged to, effectively working with opposing powers to weaken the controlling power’s presence.
   * Freedom Fighters would possibly be valid targets in any system controlled or exploited by any power that shared a major faction with the one being attacked by the freedom fighter.
   * Freedom Fighters limited to support one system at a time, with a cool down or some mission to ""wipe"" their status clean.
* More dovetailing between minor factions and powers, beyond the government versus ethos effect that currently exists.
   * Benefits and penalties of ethos versus government scale per exploited system rather than at a set 50%.

#2.1 The Engineers

""Everything changes. Introducing an expanded mission system and game-changing loot. Craft exotic weapons and modules for your spacecraft and build a ship unlike any other."" ^FS

* Some elements of the looting and crafting (L&amp;C) system are already available in 2.0. [^src](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=195928)
   * 6 consumable items can be crafted from resources looted on planetary surfaces. [^src](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155)
* The full L&amp;C system will be in the first update to Horizons, in Q1 (Jan - Mar 2016). ^DEV2
* Some loot will be available to non-Horizons CMDRs, and can be found in space. ^DEV3
* Greater degree of customisation and power to the ships. ^EGX
* Improve and customise normal weapons and module types. ^EGX
* Let you create unique equipment. [^src](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?p=2857559#post2857559)
* Loot will be found in various place in the galaxy, e.g. planetary surfaces, wrecked vessels. ^EGX
* It's a reward system to assist explorers, combatants, traders, miners and bounty hunters with each having different L&amp;C options available. ^EGX
* Ability to create different coloured and powered lasers along with guns that would create malfunctions in enemy ships systems. ^EGX
* Engineers are NPCs who will facilitate crafting, by providing mod blueprints for applying to weapons/modules. ^DEV3
* Engineers have their own characteristics, history, specialisations, rank requirements and loyalties. ^DEV3
* Having a better NPC relationship and higher rank will give access to better blueprints. ^DEV3
* ~30 Engineers spread geographically in the human bubble, located on planets, and shown on the Galaxy Map. ^DEV3

#2.2 Guardians

""Take what comes and strike back with double. Bring a second ship to every combat encounter with Ship-Launched Fighters and defend your passengers against the deadliest threats in the galaxy."" ^FS

* Larger ships in the game (for example the T-9) will be able to launch and/or dock smaller vessels from their bays. ^EGX
* Launched vessels can be either NPC or CMDR piloted. ^EGX
* These smaller ships will be used to fight off enemy craft, act as scouting vessels on planets. ^EGX
* If playing on your own and choose to leave your main vessel in a smaller fighter craft your ship will fly on autopilot and defend itself. ^EGX
* [Concept Image](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e/images/967f1e58-af10-49e3-9e6c-322f1ef9d422.jpg)

#2.3 The Commanders

""Team up and stand together. Forge your own identity with the new Commander Creator, then share your bridge with Multi-Crew and fly with friends."" ^FS

* Players working together to control the different functions of a ship. ^EGX
* E.g.1: one player would fly the ship whilst others would handle the sub-systems and weapons. ^EGX
* E.g.2: a multicrew ship landing on a planet's surface could have one player stay with the main vessel, another patrol in a ship-launched fighter, and another explore in their SRV. ^EGX
* The maximum number of crew on a ship is 4, and uses the Wing system. ^OTH7
* This crew limit may be increased in a future Season: ""We don't know how high we would go."" ^EGX
   * *Current instancing issues likely make more than 4 unfeasible for the immediate future.*
* 4 roles: Helm (piloting), Fire control (turrets/weapons), Countermeasures (shields, tactical), Engineering (sensors, navigation, repairs). ^OTH7
* CMDRs can hotswap between roles, including in Solo. ^OTH7
* Balanced so that a fully-crewed ship is on par with 4 CMDRs in a wing. ^OTH7
* Uses an SRV-style UI interface. ^OTH7
* No NPC Crew initially. ^AMA
* [Concept image1](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e/images/10e43ffe-d236-4859-93eb-3da0787dce52.jpg), [image2](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e/images/b0e2a19a-a5c5-443e-91fe-f35feefa2065.jpg).

###Apple Mac OS X:

* OS X users account for ~3.5% of Steam's userbase. [^src](http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey)
* Elite Dangerous is released and available from both the [Frontier](https://www.frontierstore.net/games/elite-dangerous-cat/elite-dangerous.html) and [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/359320/) stores, and uses the OpenGL API.
* It will receive Core Game Improvements alongside PC.
* Horizons is not compatible with OS X, due to its lack of high-performance Compute Shader support. ^AFTD1

&gt; Hi everyone. As you know, we currently publish regular GalNet reports on faction activity – economic updates, expansion updates, that sort of thing – but we suspect that most of you don’t really take much interest in them. So the question is, would you like us to continue publishing the reports, or would you like us to drop them? A complete list of the reports is below, so you know which articles we’re talking about:

&gt; * GalNet Weekly Economic Report
&gt; * GalNet Weekly Security Digest
&gt; * GalNet Weekly Powers Update Incoming
&gt; * GalNet Weekly Health Hotspots
&gt; * GalNet Focus on Democracy
&gt; * GalNet Weekly Conflict Report
&gt; * GalNet Weekly Expansion List

&gt; /u/BrettC_Frontier

Vote options:

&gt; 1. Yes, I think you should keep publishing the reports.
&gt; 2. No, I don’t think you should keep publishing the reports.

Despite each event's organisers keeping participant counts much lower than the 32 player maximum to pro-actively ensure stability, instance loading times were atrocious, and CMDRs had trouble rejoining after a dropout.  Live on an official stream!

Throughout Season 1 we've seen large improvements in the Peer-2-Peer matchmaking, mainly focused on Wing stability and UPNP/Port-Forwarding.  The latter has great difficulty with cheap/old/free-off-ISP routers, however the situation is being gradually and continually improved.

Getting these issues resolved simply has to be an immediate priority for FDev's Server &amp; Networking team - the game doesn't promote well to new players with the networking acting up as it does.

For a released game, FDev has to make this perfect, and sooner rather than later.  Players will unfortunately grow fed-up with the instability and stop trying to create emergent gameplay and events, resulting in the game losing some of its most fun activities.

&amp;nbsp;

###The networking as far as I understand it:

1. Each CMDR communicates with the transaction server to determine if other CMDRs are nearby.
2. If no CMDRs are nearby, they have their own personal instance.
3. If two CMDRs meet, the server organises the P2P matchmaking for their instances to be merged.
4. If CMDRs are nearby, the server organises the P2P matchmaking to join said CMDR into the others' instance.
5. Instance size is dependent on P2P ping/latency and UPNP/PF stability.
6. A maximum of 32 CMDRs can share the same instance.
7. The 32-per-instance limit is best reached with CMDRs in the same country/continent, all with excellent internet and quality routers.
8. The larger the instance size when joining, the longer the *loading* time is.

&amp;nbsp;

###My comments and suggestions are as follows:

* Instance loading times (see 8.) **have to be massively reduced**.  They are currently ridiculous.  I don't work for FDev so I don't purport to know how to achieve this - but it still needs to be done.
* Add to the Launcher a Basic Communications Test that checks the UPNP/PF networking of the client computer for ED, **before they play the game**.  If the test fails, give appropriate advice: recommend solo only, create support ticket, setup port forward, open may work with issues, etc.
* Give players a Ping/Latency debug display option (like the FPS and Bandwidth debug displays), that shows ping/latency times of all CMDRs in the current shared-instance.  This will assist players in diagnosing instance performance issues themselves.
* Give players an Instance Current/Max debug display option, that shows CMDRs currently in the instance, and the maximum number the current instance can support (see 5.).
* If you have a list of routers that are know to work, release it!  Same goes for known incompatible routers.

Information enables players to make informed decisions.  Not displaying information only causes frustration and guessing at the causes of faults.

&amp;nbsp;

###My ideas on logoffski - logging off game during battles/taking-damage:

* Increase the Exit-To-Main-Menu timer to 30 seconds - when playing in Open.  Give optional warning when a player joins Open, about the exciting dangers of other players.
* Reduce the Exit-To-Main-Menu timer to 5 seconds - when playing in Solo.  Give solo players their ""almost-pause"" button as it doesn't affect anyone else's game.
* Keep the Exit-To-Main-Menu timer at 15 seconds - when playing in Group.  A nice middle ground.
* When a CMDR Exits-To-Main-Menu successfully, display a **yellow Wake** to nearby CMDRs.  It's a legitimate logoff, so show the other players this - the server told them after all.
* When a CMDR loses P2P connection (computer crash, broadband dies, kills task, etc), display a **red Wake** to nearby CMDRs.  It's an unauthorised logoff, so show the other players this - their P2P will know about the connection loss after all.

A breakdown of the known* figures:

* Before the Black Friday sale there were [420k Steam CMDRs](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVenUf4WUAAKgmx.png)
* Since then [190k new Steam CMDRs have joined](http://steamspy.com/app/359320)
* **825k + 190k = 1.015m!**

\*Note that these figures don't include the new CMDRs that bought direct from the FDev store (either ED or Horizons pre-order), nor Steam Horizons-only CMDRs, nor Xbox CMDRs (*edit: since August 31st*). Therefore the total CMDR accounts will be likely *much* higher :)

**Massive congratulations** to [David Braben](/u/DavidBraben) and the whole Frontier Developments team for their continued efforts, especially the [Community](/u/zacantonaci_frontier) &amp; [Support](/u/frontier_support) crews for providing help and information when they can.

I assume this milestone will be highlighted in tomorrow's newsletter, or an even higher one if 1m was reached a while back :D

&amp;nbsp;

Now I hope you'll give us some solid information and details as to what feature-improvements, depth and content will be coming to both Horizons and the basegame during 2016.  Videos of prototypes, concept art of weapons/ships/structures, design discussions of developing features - the community love reviewing them!  After all, we know that development takes time, so consequently you're already working on them ;)

&gt; I'm right with you though in hoping that it's more like an MMO as far as the population goes at least. However I'm not too optimistic, with them saying that there will be ""very very little PvP"", that it's a PvE game, and that at least 90% of encounters will be AIs (at max PvP settings). This has all been a response to the anti-PvP crowd though, for people that want nothing to do with PvP and don't want any interaction with other players. They haven't actually explained how PvP and player encounters will work for people who actually /want/ it. Unfortunately we seem to be the minority, and most players want more of a single-player online game it seems.

Quick google searches for PvP only bring up the older discussions and videos from 2013 and early 2014, which don't appear to back up his thoughts.  And while I've generally been good at keeping up with the 104TC episodes, it's probable I may have missed a few things/changes.

As ~~first~~ spotted by /u/fu3k_hutton, on AMD's forums [Technical Support Engineer Ray_M](https://community.amd.com/message/2687893#2687893) commented:

&gt; For the record, we're aware of the issue and are working on a fix. The issue is more complicated than it appears but will be addressed in an upcoming driver.

And as to why the issue wasn't listed in the Crimson driver's original release notes, Ray_M said it was a clerical error:

&gt; I'll fix that right away.

&amp;nbsp;

The issue is dramatically reduced graphics performance (as low as 5 FPS) when travelling in Supercruise, affecting AMD Radeon users running 15.7 (and above) drivers and Windows 10.  While those with 2xx or earlier series GPUs could downgrade drivers, to e.g. 14.12, 3xx and Fury series' owners either have to put up &amp; shut up, or downgrade OS to Win7 or 8.

&gt; **Fost:** *It might be helpful if the ""Terrain work"" slider marked one side as gpu and the other as cpu. (Assuming I am correct in that it offloads work to the gpu)*

&gt; **Matt:** We're updating the text in the next release to make it clearer. 

&gt; The basics are...

&gt; 1. We set a budget to do terrain work per frame.
&gt; 2. If we increase the terrain work done per frame then your terrain will update quicker but your fps will be lower as we're adding more cost to each frame.
&gt; 3. Because we do this work per frame you may find that locking your fps to 30 if you can achieve 60 will mean we do half the work.

&gt; It's a bit of a balancing act and we'll be looking to simplify that when we have good data from everyone!

&gt; So in conclusion...

&gt; * Problem: Terrain doesn't get generated fast enough: Increase your GPU work slider or lower the terrain detail.
&gt; * Problem: Low FPS: decrease your GPU work, if your terrain is now too slow see the above point.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Jigsaw:** *Sounds like the good old problem with frame limiting and autogen computation in Flight Simulator X. That always was balancing act between achieving a good framerate and preventing blurry texture tiles.*

&gt; **Matt:** Technically for us it's terrain geometry detail. We use textures at a distance (which is set by the terrain quality setting) but those textures are always the same resolution regardless of your settings we just change the distances they're applied. Anything up close or in low flight uses real-time materials so it's controlled by the terrain material setting separately. It's worth understanding that the up close buggy terrain geometry detail is consistent for all players for the obvious networking reasons, we just play with the distant LOD quality with the terrain quality slider. The baked lighting (distant shadows and the ambient occlusions you can see on the surface) as well as the terrain materials do use the under laying geometry so more geo=better fidelity. However geo is the expensive part to compute  :)

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Brujah:** *So I noticed earlier today that my Scarab's cockpit was really low-resolution and didn't refresh back up to full resolution as I might have expected. This was after sliding my Terrain Work option to the right. Would this have an effect on the actual vehicle textures, or was it a coincidence?*

&gt; **Matt:** That's more likely a memory issue, we're looking at all of these things together :)

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Agrar Therenus:** *My FPS is significantly lower.*

&gt; *I just don't see what makes it tank to about 40fps at 4k on a 980 ti i5 3570k. The actual assets wouldn't appear to be the type that are that demanding. Truth be told 'cutting edge' is not a word I'd employ here.*

&gt; *Is there still a lot of planetary optimisation to go? Maybe it's trying to draw/render stuff it really doesn't need to?*

&gt; **Matt:** Are you talking about FPS when your stationary? If your not moving and you wait a few seconds (30-60 say) then we won't be doing any terrain generation, low fps here isn't related to the generation. Does your monitor display that resolution natively? I'd try a lower res and see how that works fps wise :) (also try lowering your super sampling to see what difference that makes)

&gt; A lot of the bugs we see are the general user config/different system issues which Beta's are for, we only see a couple of actual issues down to what the game is doing in terms of specific tasks.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Slopey:** *By way of feedback, I had Low FPS (12-15) on a GTX980 with the slider in the default position. So I moved it all the way to the right, and I now have +30fps solidly on planets (running tripleheaded at 5040x1050 on Ultra).*

&gt; *Isn't that working in the opposite sense? Should I not have seen a frame rate decrease with the slider moved to the right?*

&gt; **Matt:** curious! I'd guess you get rid of the generation time quicker. I'll double check I got my facts right though ;)

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **The Law:** *Understandable, but still bad decision to use player computers for terrain generation in ""real time"". What I think happens:*

&gt; 1. *Player flies into new planet*
&gt; 2. *Player computer gets crunching, generating the terrain and landscape*
&gt; 3. *Player gets FPS drop due to this hog*

&gt; *Evidence clearly supports my theory, because I always see FPS dip when I first close in on the planet and then after a while the FPS levels back to 60 again.*

&gt; *I think the servers should do the majority of work and send player the relevant data. On Earth-like world, it will melt even Nvidia Titans if terrain generation remains client side.*

&gt; **Matt:** That's just not feasible, we'd have to generate the terrain on CPU if we asked servers to do it and that's much much slower (over 100 times slower), we're also generating ALOT of data, sending it would be slow and expensive. Anyone with a slightly less than awesome connection would see stuttering and lack of detail, it would also cripple solo modes ability to just use small amounts of data. We looked into different approaches into this back in the planning phase and while we have a big list of things to improve; using the cloud vs the players GPU isn't feasible.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Slopey:** *Yeah - it must have been CPU bound previously. I just threw that in there as ""slider to right means &lt; fps"" isn't correct really - given the CPU needs to be factored in, so I guess pushing the work to the card on a slow CPU will increase fps, whereas taking some load off a weak GPU with a strong CPU may also increase fps.*

&gt; **Matt:** Sorry, just to be clear in terms of the terrain work slider differences the cpu is largely irrelevant, the slider slides between allocating a small amount of gpu time or a large amount of gpu time. The work the gpu does would be done 100 times slower on the cpu if we did use it, which we don't 

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Slopey:** *Ok - so if the cpu is irrelevant, why do I get higher frame rates with the slider on the right, than with it on the left? I would have thought that if the GPU is doing more work (right side), I would get lower fps?*

&gt; **Matt:** Context is important here. If you as a player are sat in the same spot for a minute or so I'm pretty sure the terrain won't be generating anything so the work slider at that point is irrelevant. Bad fps at that point should be unrelated to the sliders settings. If you want to test something separate I'd recommend picking the same altitude and flying in OC around the planet smoothly and watching the terrain.

&gt; Also don't forget that to see the changes in settings you have to exit to the main menu and reload to see the terrain quality and the material quality but the terrain work should work when you flick back to the game from options

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **hst12:** *On my system with a weak GPU (GTX 680M) the slider doesn't really make much difference. I suspect that systems with powerful GPUs that have some headroom to spare will benefit.*

&gt; **Matt:** If you run with v-sync on then as long as you can run at the target FPS with the increased GPU allocation then you won't see any difference. For that reason It's worth trying with V sync off if your frame rate plunges!

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; **M4MKey:** *Thanks for giving so much info about this. I don't have any issue with terrain generation and it's all happening smoothly for me. Only loss of framerate is when there is lighting sources on the ground ( SRV one for exemple ), I think casting shadows on the ground is a little bit too demanding. But that's not the point of my post.*

&gt; *On a subject relatively close but not really... I have found a planet near a red star, and the ground was still quite pale ( in terms of color ). It also seems to be something quite some people reported, the lack of color difference between planets. Do you know or have any information about this ? Will this be eventually improved, get a richer palette of color?*

&gt; *Thanks for your time*

&gt; **Matt:** Have a screenshot? In the last update we allowed more of the stars colour to come through. The saturation of a star falls off over distance, planets near the star should receive more of the pure true colour while those away will receive a whiter less saturated light. Knowing the star type also helps :)",EliteDangerous,"Matt Dickinson, Head of Technical Art, discusses and answers questions about the new Planetary Terrain &amp; performance optimisations",https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3v9zzf/matt_dickinson_head_of_technical_art_discusses/

###Loot &amp; Crafting

&gt; *[Ozric:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084422&amp;viewfull=1#post3084422) Will you be going into more details on how the wave scanner works?*

&gt; **Michael:** It's better to play it than for me to describe it - you'll get your chance soon :-) You can ask though, but I may not answer.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *[Osric:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084422&amp;viewfull=1#post3084422) Can you explain where our materials will be stored? It does seem odd that they are not lost on destruction yet exploration data and vouchers are. I can understand the reasons for it, but it seems to go against how everything has been done in the game so far.*

&gt; **Michael:** The storage of the materials is a commander centric thing. We've taken a slightly different approach with this because the materials work differently to other items in game as they are not immediately useful. With vouchers you can cash them in immediately, but with materials that isn't the case, you have to carry then until they are useful. However this personal storage may well evolve down the line as we're thinking about station based stashes for materials which would replace these personal stores.

&gt; *[Micha:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084452&amp;viewfull=1#post3084452) Hmm, so crafting is mostly going to be about refuelling and restocking weaponry?*

&gt; **Michael:** No - this is just a prelude to it. The main aim for crafting will be weapons and modules.

&gt; *[Horizone:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084463&amp;viewfull=1#post3084463) So these materials, they will not be visible in any other way than on the scanner, they will not materialize in the game other then lines on a inventory?*

&gt; **Michael:** You'll find objects in the game using the wave scanner - like outcrops, then destroy them and collect the materials.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *[Xondk:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084472&amp;viewfull=1#post3084472) As an explorer, I was kinda hoping that the initial run would also include a way to restock oxygen and maybe very expensive way to repair canopy, like needing to find certain crystals and such to repair it with.*

&gt; **Michael:** It might - it's on the list for the AFM to be able to repair the cockpit, but I'm not certain if it will make 1.5 or Horizons yet.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *[Micha:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084573&amp;viewfull=1#post3084573) Hmm, ok, so priority #1 is, as always *pew pew pew*. It'd be great if the game would also cater more to those of us who are not into fighting all that much. It's great to hear that you're putting these requests on the TODO list, but pushing out basics like hull/cockpit repair beyond EH is.. well, a tad disappointing.*

&gt; **Michael:** Unfortunately that's the call that we have to make is balancing time and people with work. It's on the list so will happen, but we do have other priorities as well and not just for 'pew pew' - and that's coming from someone halfway to Sagittarius A* with a broken canopy!

&gt; *[CMDR-AD:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084513&amp;viewfull=1#post3084513) Regarding ""materials""... When I heard that they could be used to create new ammo, immediately I had *very large* quantities in mind. After all, restocking a Large size Canon (the muzzle appears to be nearly 1.5 meters in diameter?!) with 105 rounds of that size would an immense quantity of material. Based on this Dev update, then it seems that these ""materials"" are more like small additives which enhance the other primary resources used to create the ammo.*

&gt; **Michael:** In this case it's both - they will restock your ammunition, but if you use different materials then they can be of a better quality than shop bought ammunition.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *[Osric:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084539&amp;viewfull=1#post3084539) so do you imagine that once you have these station based stashes in (if you do it) then you will no longer keep the materials once you die, or you still could but the amount you can keep in your ship would not be as much as the station storage?*

&gt; **Michael:** It's yet to be decided on how a station stash would work if we went that way - it might be a complete replacement, or it might be an additional store, but the personal one reduced. We may even settle on a completely different solution!

&gt; *[Wstephenson:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084548&amp;viewfull=1#post3084548) Michael, will synthesising ammunition or AFMU supplies also require mineable bulk commodities? Creating things with significant mass from trace Materials would otherwise seem to require a liberal application of E=mc².*

&gt; **Michael:** For this first iteration no, but with the full loot system that is quite likely.

&gt; **Michael:** Yes. The type of material is determined by the type of the planet and its geology.

&gt; *[Genar-Hofoen:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084553&amp;viewfull=1#post3084553) This boosted FSD Jump - would a Fuel Rat be able to transfer whatever substance is needed for them?*

&gt; *[Fuub:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084768&amp;viewfull=1#post3084768) It seems the material system is centered to the SRV wave scanner. Does this mean we can't go exploring planets surface flying with our ship and land when we spot a good location to find materials? This was the type of gameplay I was expecting from Horizons tbh, not only SRV stuff...*

&gt; **Michael:** The planets are huge so you need to fly between locations and you will get an indication from the ship's scanner that there is something of interest in the area, but you need to be in the SRV to track it down.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *[Mephane:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084880&amp;viewfull=1#post3084880) That brings up another question: can you also make normal fuel for the ship, or only the SRV? Because otherwise, having to rely on the ship to move around between potential sites to ""harvest"", you become ultimately limited by the fuel of the ship, and required to leave the planet to scoop fuel from a star, for example. In other words: could just as well have implemented a way to pump fuel from the ship into the SRV, same effect in the end, sooner or later you have to go scooping anyway. Plus, being able to refuel the ship on the ground would mean those boring lifeless rocks around brown dwarfs could suddenly become a life saver...*
 
&gt; **Michael:** Ships are still refuelled by scooping from stars. I'd love to do gas giants in thew future :-)

&gt; *[Orfeboy:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3084447&amp;viewfull=1#post3084447) One more question if I may - Is there any hope of having Intergalactic corporations operating outside of the Galactic powers? Kind of like Shell, Intel and Google? What I mean is big powerful corporations that players can work for? As a player group it is our current intention to operate as a corporation. More powers to affect the game in that way could make the game more interesting. Just some thoughts.*

Would FD see this as a primary goal for the development of the game?*

&gt; **Michael:** Oh yes - the minor factions is something we want to develop further and getting player groups involved is part of that process.

We are finding some inconsistent results and are unsure whether it is bugged, something going on behind the scenes, there are factors that we haven't taken into account.*

&gt; **Michael:** The only recent change with the influence balancing has been adding the cap to prevent the sudden swings that have been seen. The cap varies depending on the amount of player actions and the size of the system's population. We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needs be and there are other plans to expand the galaxy simulation in the future.

&gt; *[Schlack:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3085357&amp;viewfull=1#post3085357) Any update on some love for the Alliance? The question was asked in the recent livestream. Sandro was, unfortunately, quite tight lipped on the matter. Hopefully that means something exiting happening, however it does feel something like neglect. If Alliance love is far down the priority list, please let us know. We know lots of CMDRS want lots of things NOW!. Soon (tm)?*

&gt; **Michael:** The Alliance will be getting some love, but not soon I'm afraid.

###Missions &amp; Careers

&gt; *[Marc_Hicks:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3088226&amp;viewfull=1#post3088226) With all the major improvements we have seen to missions over this last season, will we finally get to see an improvement in the number-&amp; variety-of military missions in the game? Better yet, will we ever get the Military Mission sub-screen that we used to get in Frontier &amp; First Encounters? At present the military aspect of the game still feels more like an afterthought than a genuine career path.*

&gt; **Michael:** Military missions is something we want to take a step back with and come at them differently. I'd like to see them acting as more of a career.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *[Marc_Hicks:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3088226&amp;viewfull=1#post3088226) Again, with the major improvements coming to missions in 1.5, will we see a significant upgrade/improvements to the ""Counter-mission"" system, to give them a bit more variety? I was thinking ""variety"" in terms of how these Counter-missions turn up (mix of USS, Super-Cruise ""Contacts"" or activated by player actions in normal space), the size &amp; nature of the rewards for taking the Counter mission (much larger cash pay-outs, synthesis materials &amp; ""loot"", 'directions' to lucrative salvageable wreckage, places of interest et al, massive influence boosts with that faction etc) &amp; the penalties for accepting/refusing a ""Counter-mission"".*

&gt; **Michael:** Contact mission is something we're starting to add in 1.5 and Horizons.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; *[Marc_Hicks:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3088435&amp;viewfull=1#post3088435) Are there any plans to bring in Escort Missions &amp; Convoy Raid missions? I'll understand if you're not in a position to answer that at the moment, just thought I would try to take advantage of your presence here at the moment.*

&gt; **Michael:** We still have loads of things we want to do with missions - including escorts.

&amp;nbsp;

###Ships

&gt; *[Nyres:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3088823&amp;viewfull=1#post3088820) Someone brought up the FDL heat issues and got me to thinking. If you go through with this you need to do something about the FDL's heat dissipation or risk that it will be a worthless ship in serious combat which given its cost is kind of insane. The FDL has such a horrendous heat management even when trying to be the most balanced for heat generation that I really do fear that the new shield cell bank change sounds like it will equal one use of scb = heat damage on the ship.*

&gt; **[Sandro:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=199155&amp;p=3088823&amp;viewfull=1#post3088820)** I think the FDL is probably due for a buff at some point during season 2.

Consequently this may perhaps alleviate some of the confusion some ""I am happy"" CMDRs could have, about what gameplay depth ""I am bored"" CMDRs are looking for in-game.

&amp;nbsp;

Please try to be concise with your thoughts and ideas, so that others (including FDev) can easily understand what you're after.  Provide links-to and quotes-of posts you (or others) have already made if you find that easier, including content from the [Design Discussion Archive](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?p=431507#post431507) if appropriate.

Discussions and ideas expanding on [what we already know is coming during Horizons](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=172362) is of course welcomed.

While I welcome any and all ideas, I would recommend separating different idea-subjects into different posts, as this should make make discussion branches easier to follow.  So if you've ideas about station ownership and player-to-player trading, please create two posts to be discussed separately.

Meta-wise, please upvote/downvote posts accordingly as per [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), but as this thread is flagged Serious, there should be very little to downvote.

&amp;nbsp;

For example, don't simply state ""player owned stations"" but instead describe:

* gameplay mechanics on how stations could be bought/captured/constructed/destroyed/etc
* extra gameplay mechanics said stations could give when owned
* how the station ownership can be accessed by open/group/solo players either equally or balanced
* the ease with which the station ownership could be added, based on already existing mechanics where possible

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: What I'm hoping to avoid are context-less comments &amp; opinions like ""SCBs ruin combat""/""FDev will never do that""/""the game is brilliant anyway &amp; doesn't need that"", and instead get some quality conversation going about great gameplay that could be added.  This in turn may inspire FDev to develop these new gameplay mechanics that'll benefit CMDRs and the game alike.

&amp;nbsp;

Hi /u/EdwardLewis_Frontier, lots of excellent ideas appearing here, hopefully some of them appeal to Sandro &amp; his design team :)

Only today we're seeing fixes that were created approximately a fortnight ago.

After 2+ weeks of bug fixing since 1.4/CQC release, today's 1.4.1 update for all platforms resolves:

* 6x global issues
* 6x Xbox-only issues

Note that no issues are resolved for *only* PC/Mac, i.e. fixes developed during the past week/fortnight that didn't make it into the 1.4.1 Microsoft validation patch.  MS's validation process takes 5-14 days.

**Edit:** Today's update is identical for all three platforms.  As the Xbox update needs validation, the patch has therefore existed for at least 5 days, since the date it was sent to MS.  Consequently, PC/Mac players have had to wait 5+ days - for an update that was ready - for Microsoft to give the ok for Xbox update deployment.

This new patching-policy appears to contradict what was said by [David Braben during an interview](http://www.pcgamesn.com/elite-dangerous/elite-dangerous-david-braben-likes-the-idea-of-cross-play-but-one-problem-looms-over-it) back in March:

&gt; I think the challenges for us, which sort of fights against it [full crossplay], is we’ve also said that we’ll continue to do updates across all platforms, and **what we didn’t want was PC updates to be held up** for whatever reason, like **if there’s a delay on another platform**.

Meanwhile, following the previous major updates 1.0-1.3, the first two weeks of patches fixed 4-to-9 *times* as many bugs:

* 1.0 - 62 issues
* 1.1 - 49 issues
* 1.2 - 85 issues
* 1.3 - 111 issues

My questions about the change in development:

* Does this mean the PC/Mac updates have been held back one/two weeks, for MS authorisation of the corresponding Xbox update (despite not having full cross-play between platforms)?
* Even if the combined Xbox/PC/Mac update was sent to MS for authorisation a fortnight ago, why haven't new fixes &amp; updates for PC/Mac been created since then (without the MS red tape)?
* Are other fixes for PC/Mac incoming this week, or do we have to wait another fortnight for MS to give permission?
* Or even worse, wait **two months** until 1.5/Ships (all platforms) and Horizons (PC only btw) are released, for major bugs introduced in 1.4 to be resolved, as stated for SMAA and NPC AI in RES?

I understand that 1.5 and Horizons require considerable development resources, but asking the community to wait weeks/months for fixes, including delays to PC/Mac patches due to Microsoft validation, can't exactly be described as [""And we’re doing our best to make as many people as we can happy""](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/03/12/david-braben-on-fan-anger-interview/).

Here's a by-no-means-complete summary list of gameplay content &amp; features coming throughout Season 2, some of which is not restricted to Horizons' CMDRs:

* Planetary exploration, finding wrecks etc
* Driving &amp; racing SRVs - /r/EliteRacers
* Attacking planetside bases and installations
* Looting enemies/wrecks &amp; crafting new equipment
* Ship-Launched Fighters
* Multi-Crew and shared-ship roles
* CMDR creation/personalisation
* More ships &amp; SRVs
* More missions types and branching missions
* More ship skins and decals

Some things that we can hope will come too:

* More depth, fluidity and information on the BackGround Simulation
* Increased instance sizes - currently capped at 32 players
* More preventative measures to combat cheats and combat-loggers - e.g. arbitration servers (Hybrid P2P) brought in for Open-play or where appropriate
* Player-created bounties
* Powerplay, Community Goal &amp; Minor-Faction chat channels - restricted to in-station or around NAV beacons only?
* Tier 2 NPCs with reputation mechanics
* Timed ship escorting &amp; their assassination counterpart missions
* NPC ships/wings for hire
* Ultra-difficult missions for Wings
* Skin/decal rewards for missions
* Ship naming
* Lava and volcanic effects on planets
* New types of Powerplay *missions* other than direct-combat &amp; fetch-from-A-to-B
* New types of community goals - blockades, piracy, system-security killing
* New CQC maps, ships &amp; gameplay modes - 8 vs 8 CTF/TDM

For me: attacking planetary bases and racing SRVs I can't wait to play at; CMDR creation and Multi-Crew don't appeal to me; and I'd love for increased instance sizes and T2 NPCs to appear please :)",EliteDangerous,"What gameplay features/content are you most eagerly awaiting in Season 2, and which one(s) are you least interested about?",https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3p5969/what_gameplay_featurescontent_are_you_most/

From the Devs:

&gt; * Chuck Norris's ship doesn't need turrets - he just roundhouse kicks the universe until the target is aligned with his guns. Which is just for show, because Chuck Norris's ship doesn't bother deploying guns - it deploys Chuck Norris.
&gt; * When Chuck Norris scans your ship, you're wanted.
&gt; * Chuck Norris scoops fuel with his hands. 
&gt; * Chuck Norris once plugged a black hole.
&gt; * When Chuck Norris approaches the universe, the universe uses Chuck Norris as a frame of reference.
&gt; * Chuck Norris yaws.
&gt; * Chuck Norris doesn't drop from super cruise, he merely drops super cruise.
&gt; * Every point Chuck Norris makes is a hardpoint.
&gt; * Chuck Norris folds time and space by hand, and still ends up with a longer jump range than any known FSD.
&gt; * When Chuck Norris performs a round house kick he flips the system.
&gt; * Combat Logging against Chuck Norris doesn't work - no-one escapes Chuck Norris.

&gt; * Planets roll around the feet of Chuck Norris, trying to explore him.

&gt; * When cops scan Chuck Norris while he's transporting illegal goods, cops fine themselves.
&gt; * Chuck Norris doesn't need to use gimballed lasers, they know better than to miss.

&gt; * If there are Thargoids, its because Chuck Norris allowed them to exist.
&gt; * Chuck Norris won the game and saw the end sequence of ED.
&gt; * There is one rating higher than Elite, but Frontier didn't include it. You can't say Chuck Norris three times without dire consequences.

&gt; * Chuck Norris kills you in his Condor. Without weapons. In Solo mode.
&gt; * Chuck Norris does not hunt in RES. He hunts the RES.

&gt; * When Chuck Norris makes an interdiction a new life form is created
&gt; * Its not server problems that boot our connection from the game, it is Chuck Norris flipping several systems at once with one interdiction.
&gt; * Chuck Norris doesn't need a landing permission, he just boosts his thing right through the slot.
&gt; * If you have a fully A-specced Anaconda, and Chuck Norris has a fully A-specced Anaconda, Chuck Norris' Anaconda is more fully A-specced than yours.
&gt; * Chuck Norris doesn't need hatch breakers because Bruce Lee killed him in Way of the Dragon.

How do we all think development will progress following the arrival of SM and Puniverse:

* SM: Jukes to be added in next?  Or zero-gravity first?
* PU: How long until a second star system is added, therefore two large-maps to jump between?
* SATA-Ball to be postponed for a great while - good thing for me, I'd prefer the core gameplay to be done first - but when would you like it to arrive?
* Missions, exploration, trading, piracy: which order do Citizens want them to appear in the PU alpha, and how detailed; bits of each, or say missions fully done then add trading?
* Release timescale wishes of things: 60 flyable ships mid 2016, and/or which ships are most important to you?  PU having 30 star systems end 2016, or 15 content-full systems?  Full game 2017, 2018?

&gt; I quite like the simplicity of the ""increase merits for unfortified systems"" concept, personally. Definitely worth chewing over.

&gt; Regarding 5th columnists: we are investigating ways of allowing powers to shed systems: the trick is to enforce enough safety measures to prevent the process itself being sabotaged!

&gt; In general, we like the idea of a power being able to change it's powerbase over time; we think it could create more opportunity for powers fighting over systems.

&gt; Just to let you know, we're also considering information flow (for example having the number of ships destroyed in a system available) as potentially part of the solution to the sniping issue (and I use the term advisedly: I do think it's a bit of an issue as there's basically nothing the target can do apart from fortify every system). 

&gt; The more I've been thinking about vouchers (and watching the debate), the more I've cooled on the idea. It still has merit, and is good in terms of simplicity, but (despite accusations ) I do worry about the ability of smaller powers to operate and thrive. 

&gt; My contention with sniping is that it's too one-sided. 

&gt; Ideally, I would like to reach a solution where being a smaller power has some advantages, or where being a larger power takes more effort, but not to the point that sniping requires.

&gt; Could fortification values and undermining triggers be scaled to the size of the power? Surprise attacks are and should be valid, but the workload itself could make sniping more difficult. Sort of a 'logistics' cost- smaller powers have less to organize, while larger powers waste more though red tape much like real life?

&gt; Though it's a completely reasonable idea, the issue with scaling thresholds for fortification and undermining based on power size is that I don't see it helping large powers defend against sniping (actually, it might make it worse).

&gt; It could obviously help with the idea of buffing smaller powers though, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

&gt; I'd rather we focused on changes that reward strategy more instead of providing a herding stick to the merit farmers.

&gt; It's been a few days already and the only changes you have replied to are the ones which will make Arissa (or any other power with her populace in the future in that regard) impossible to harm. 

&gt; Why not make fortifying more active instead so that people don't have to spend 5 hours anchored in a station in order to provide a cargo load of fortification merits? The main problem behind fortifying is not the direction they are headed towards, it's how boring it is and thus no one wants to engage it as an occupation. It's literally a job to do it right now. It provides no fun, it requires those who do it to pretty much stop playing and wait in a station for quotas and most of the time it leads to the same people being forced to invest their own credits or have their power in turmoil, close to every week.

&gt; Please think through changes that provide direction. A power making mistakes is also a crucial part of the game.

&gt; We do want to add more variety to the Powerplay activities. This is a long-term goal that requires significant resources and time.

&gt; However, that does not render simple changes that could have net positive results pointless, surely?

&gt; In fairness, you're absolutely correct: we do have to be careful when making changes that offer incentives, which is why we'd need to chew over the ramifications before putting anything in motion.

&gt; I would maybe argue at the moment though, that within fortification and preparation there already is the capacity to make mistakes - possibly I could argue that fortification currently incentivises ""mistakes"" by making systems very close to the home world equally profitable.

&gt; All discussion is good discussion though!

&gt; I've said it before and I'll say it again - you don't need massively complicated mechanics or mechanic changes to cope with 5th column prep sabotage.

&gt; All you need to do is change the amount of preparation goods you get every week to be exactly what you get in nominations. Once you do that, prep sabotage becomes extremely difficult to do, because any organized group can easily muster enough rank 5 players to out prep the sabotage systems.

&gt; I seriously do not understand why people are jumping to introduce needlessly complicated mechanics, new voting systems, vetoing, counter vetoing etc. For that matter, I don't understand why on Earth it's something that I've come up with rather than something the developers have come up with on their own - I mean, it's probably the simplest fix of all.

&gt; I like the concept of limiting preparation based on rating. 

&gt; It makes rating more important, which is always a good thing in my book, as well as potentially making it harder for saboteurs (they'd actually have to do some good by fortifying and undermining to increase their rating to be able to hurt the power).

&gt; I'm also attracted to the concept that preparation becomes finite; another incentive to work together if you really want the power to do well.

&gt; I do have a concern though. 

&gt; Such a system would be particularly painful to powers with small supporter bases with regards to preparation competition, which tend to be smaller powers, though this isn't always the case. 

&gt; If a system was desired by two powers, one with lots of supporters and one with few, this system would essentially limit the effectiveness of ""putting the time in"" which is currently available to small user base powers. The large user base power could offset this limit by simply sending more folk to prepare.

&gt; It's somewhat of a corner case, but it would be interesting to hear what you folk think on this issue.",EliteDangerous,Lead Designer Sandro Sammarco Responds To Some Powerplay Improvement Ideas &amp; Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3l1zk4/lead_designer_sandro_sammarco_responds_to_some/

2. I take that to mean when a CQC match is finished, players aren't being returned to the *pool* of available players to be matchmade.

&gt; #####On top of that, if you're using a generic style CPE router from your ISP - chances are, it cannot handle all of the active states/simultaneous transfers and will fall over (lock up, reboot, lose connectivity). Would recommend on using a slightly more powerful router that can handle that sort of connectivity.

&gt; #####pfSense is a good alternative if you have some networking knowledge :)

For amusement's sake and a bit of context, [here's the OP](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=182558) that Brett was replying to:

&gt; Please understand combat logging correctly.  Its when a commander chooses to pull the plug and save the ship, not when he gets interdicted 3 commander dropping on him and his internet crashes, **cause 4 brothers are dling music, a dad dling 5 movies** and moms got a nursing test goin on.

&gt; sincerely, cmdr jp josh

&gt; carry on commander in a python with a twichy trigger finger, i still got away from you even when i came back to give ya a chance to pirate.

Fair play to the CMDR for returning after restoring his 'net connection!

Obviously, downloading/sharing/torrenting files can negatively impact your internet connection.  Sharing an internet connection with others in your household?  It may be wiser to play in Solo to avoid unfortunately-timed dropouts.

CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) Router: the free router provided by your Internet Service Provider.  These almost always have only basic functionality, and in ED's case may not to be up to the job of routing all the UPNP requests Open Play requires - alongside torrent UPNP communications.  When buying a new router, get a model released in the last 12 months for maximum compatibility and features.

Information on [pfSense can be found here](https://www.pfsense.org/), including guides on setting up your own custom router.

Needless to say, if you're still having connectivity troubles, [create a support ticket](https://support.frontier.co.uk/topic.php) &amp; they'll help you resolve the problem :)",EliteDangerous,FDev's Advice To Open-Playing CMDRs If They Encounter Internet Dropouts Or Poor P2P Matchmaking,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3kvyif/fdevs_advice_to_openplaying_cmdrs_if_they/

&gt; Greetings Commanders,
 
&gt; Welcome to this week’s community goals blog, and what an interesting week it has been!
 
&gt; Thousands of Commanders decided to take on the long, long journey to Hutton Orbital in order to create the Hutton Mug. A total of 2,474,096 tonnes of Scrap were delivered to the station in a one-week period - an achievement made all the more impressive by the fact that Hutton Orbital doesn’t have a large landing pad!

&gt; I personally really enjoyed watching how the community reacted to the goal: we had people handing out scrap from their Type 9’s, the appearance of pirates, and of course an attempted blockade. In the end, however, the community won through, with the Hutton Mug being created with an allowance of 30 units. We expect that the mug will be available shortly after the upcoming 1.4 update.
 
&gt; After a week of poring over exploration data, the Empire’s finest bureaucrats have identified Emperor’s Dawn cells in the Mauusk and Dakshmandi systems. Senator Denton Patreus has announced that he is spearheading an all-out attack against these cells, and has launched initiatives in both systems for Commanders who are willing to fight. 
 
&gt; Elsewhere, Emperor’s Dawn has also called for aid, asking Commanders to deliver Progenitor Cells to Ipilyaqa and Basic Narcotics to Ch’i Lin. They are offering high credit rewards for Commanders who are willing to assist them in their campaign to reform the Empire.
 
&gt; If you are looking for the goal this week, the breakdown below should help you:
 
&gt; * Maausk – Maausk – Deliver Combat Bonds to the combat bond contact.
&gt; * Dakshmandi – Hevelius Enterprise – Deliver Combat Bonds to the combat bond contact.
&gt; * Ipilyaqa – Furuta Orbital – Deliver Progenitor Cells to the commodities market.
&gt; * Ch’i Lin – Fallows Orbital – Deliver Basic Narcotics to the commodities market.
 
&gt; It’s time to pick a side, Commanders.",EliteDangerous,Community Goals Update,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3kjxu6/community_goals_update/

So yeah, screw you guys I'm not spending another penny.  Don't release any new ship skinpacks, cool Elite t-shirts, mugs, badges and other paraphernalia I don't need.  Waste of time, I'm not budging.

Ignore the community wanting bobbleheads back - it's a stupid idea allowing space ship cockpit customisation.  My wallet has better things to do like buy Call of Duty Modern Ops 6 at £50 and Destiny's next 1-map pack for £30.

And after the critically acclaimed success of Rollercoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile I'll be buying RCT World - Atari are on their 3rd developer now therefore it's obviously going to be fantastic - so absolutely don't bother allowing pre-orders to Planet Coaster cos I won't be buying...

[RUB2,250 converts to £23/€32/$35](http://www.majorexchangerates.com/rub/2250-gbp.html).  Just ensure language in Store is set to English (or your preferred) to avoid localisation confusion.  Do the same in the Game Launcher when it's installed.

&gt; You might not know this, but Elite: Dangerous will be the fourth game in the series. The space simulation started way back in 1984, and it actually featured three-dimensional graphics. The original was way ahead of its time. Now with the gains in technology, Dangerous will feature the entire galaxy on a massively multiplayer platform. The game originally was a Kickstarter project in 2012, and will soon be available for Xbox One. We sat down at E3 2015 with the Executive Producer for the space simulation, Ben Dowie, to get some more information about the game and where it started off.

&gt; Dangerous offers so much for a space simulation. We asked Dowie about the presence of a story, or if the game would strictly be focused on exploration. Behind a large community who helped to front the funds for the project, it proves true that there is a deep story involved. When asked about this, Dowie stated, “Yes, there is a rich back-history. We have what’s called Galnet in the game. It’s this whole fiction layer of deep history that has been developed for thirty-one years. This is the fourth game. This has been brewing in David Braben’s head for a long time. There is such a huge fanbase from the original and such a huge community that all contribute and they are all involved that the amount of things and knowledge, the Ambassadors that are with us today know far more than I will ever know about it. It’s really heartwarming to know that people know care so much that they are willing to invest so much of their time. We were in a cab ride and we were talking about one small part of the story for the entire cab ride.”

&gt; With the series being around for so long, it will certainly accrue a cult following. Sure, Mario has been around since the early 80s, but he’s running a flagship. A game like this that appeals to much less of an audience is still heavily involved in the compilation of the newest version. We asked what influences Dangerous incorporates from the original. Dowie went on to say, “If you ever get a chance, search for “Elite 1984” and you will see the really simple wireframe, which is literally the exactly same structure of the ship today. The shapes of all of the initial ships were the same, and the new game will be influenced by those originals. All the fans of the originals thought these were pretty spectacular when they got to see them. For our launch event, we built a 16:1 scaled Cobra at the event. We did it at Ducksford Air Base. We had our spaceships there and everyone was coming up to it.”

&gt; There is a growing trend in space simulation titles with other space-related games seeing success in the past. Rather they be real-time strategy games or first person shooters, there is always a core of fans that will get deeply involved with a space title. We mentioned about what innovations will fans of the series see in Dangerous and Dowie said, “The game is massively multiplayer and that is something David Braben would have loved to have done in 1984, obviously restricted by technology. The fact he was able to blow it up in 3D was staggering anyways. There’s just not much to compare that achievement to. The fact now it’s now a huge galaxy that everyone shares, the background simulation, and cross-platform along with the history and layer of galactic powers and how they influence the events will help.”

&gt; In Dangerous, you will be navigating a ship, just like the original. We asked Dowie about the different ships in the game. The competitive CQC will have much less at launch, however there is a reason for it. “There are tons in the game,” Dowie says, “but there are only three in CQC. This is important because when you start playing Elite: Dangerous, you start off with a tiny little Sidewinder, which is really awesome, but it’s kind of a starter ship. But when you go into CQC, that ship is actually the top class. The new one we added is so small and nimble. We had to make a new ship to support a completely new mode.” The game will also feature power-ups in this mode and multiple weapons. He stated, “Yes there’s lasers, missles, canons and other weapons. Each of these are powered up.”

&gt; By far, the most impressive game I tested at E3 2015 with Oculus Rift was Dangerous. You truly feel the sense of speed and the variations of flying a ship. Partaking in a space dog fight, I found myself looking behind me and all around. You can even see your hands on the controls of the ship. It was an amazing experience and will change how you want to play the game. Dowie commented on Oculus Rift by saying, “We are constantly trying to support all the new technology we can. We don’t know what the future holds with Oculus, but we will continue to support as much as we can because we love it.”

&gt; Lastly, Dowie mentioned that a Free Edition will be released for PC and Mac later this year. The Xbox One version will sell for $24.99 and a pre-order will knock some money off of it. The time we spent with resulted in an enjoyable experience with tight, responsive controls and wanting to spend more time with it.

&gt;This is a very interesting thing there, Michael, and leads me to a question/suggestion I have posted in the past, but seems ever so appropriate in this context. If a player group supports a minor faction, be it an existing one or one newly created to represent them, can the game recognize them as proper members of that faction? So that where for an NPC it would show the faction, it would do so for these players; I know it currently shows the pledged power there, but certainly there could be room for both.

&gt;If I were member of a big player group that gets their own minor faction, I certainly would like to have this minor faction's name be shown to other players.

&gt;If the answer is yes:

&gt;1. Could you make it so all players can pick a minor or major faction in the same manner, to represent them, even when they are not part of a group?
&gt;2. Will the players inherit the inter-faction relationships of their minor/major faction? Like if, say, the Fuel Rats get the minor faction ""Fuel Rats Inc"", attacking a Fuel Rat player would then lower your reputation with the Fuel Rats Inc minor faction, and likewise, your standing with the minor faction is reflected for those players, i.e. a Fuel Rat would see you shown in green if you are friendly with the Fuel Rats Inc faction.

&gt;**It's not in the immediate plan, but is something that is being considered.**

&gt;will it be possible for a group which is not role playing a ""political entity"" in game, but rather exists purely for group play together, to be come a minor faction in game. An example is (and I don't mean it in a bad way, it just fits my question context!) Mobius' group, which is a PvE group. So they don't have any specific in game agenda, but rather offer a PvE environment for players. 

&gt;Or will a group have to have some in game agenda or role play a political/social etc. entity in order to be considered for becoming a minor faction?

&gt;@Mobius' members - this is not aimed to criticise you guys, I play in the group myself sometimes 

&gt;**A minor faction by its very existence is a political entity. How far you want to push it is up to you.**

&gt;Michael, this sounds like a very positive idea, and one that has been suggested by many players for a long time. Could you please clarify two things:

&gt;1. Would a player group support their minor faction in-game by performing the same type of missions as they would for an NPC minor faction, or would they be different types of missions?
&gt;2. Would players in solo mode, private groups, or those simply not participating in Powerplay or any social aspects of the game be able to take missions from a group-sponsored minor faction? ie Would player-group minor factions ""look"" just like NPC minor factions, to all intents and purposes.

&gt;Hoping the answer is ""Yes"" to both of the above.

&gt;**It would work in the same way as the other minor factions and yes any players with appropriate reputation can take missions.**

I guess anyone, belonging to the player group or not, can still play the background sim as usual correct? That means both helping or supporting that minor faction expansion through the usual ways.

&gt;There will be therefore a very obvious disconnect between the gameplay required while supporting a minor faction and the gameplay required once it becomes a Power. This is clearly begging for Powerplay mechanics in general and CC yields in particular to be linked and integrated to the background sim and state of systems (economy states, government types, security states etc) owned by the new Power thus formed. Is there an intent to make that integration happen at some point?

&gt;**The two are deliberately kept separate as they operate on different levels of control. Minor factions operate on an asset owning level like starports, where powerplay is about wider influence and control and the superpowers sit on an even higher level are pretty much controlled by us. Merging the two would create some odd differentials of scale with how they conduct their operations. Of course there are synergies between the different scales, so appropriately aligned minor faction benefit from being within the sphere of influence for a related power.**

&gt;Thanks, FD, for all you're doing, however - for the purposes of feedback - this update left me completely flat.

&gt;I can't express enough how little interest I have in Powerplay. It does nothing for me. I'm happy for those who are getting a kick out of it.

&gt;I really, really hope that very soon it'll be explained that this is all just laying the groundwork and why FD is pursuing PP will be explained, a light bulb will turn on, and there'll be a collective ""ahhhhhhhh...."" as we finally understand.

&gt;I'd like to see a working stock market, investments, things to spend money on. That'd make the game scale beyond the ~450T trading cap. I'm sure I don't speak for everyone. 

&gt;**Okay, I'll bite.**

&gt;**Powerplay fulfills a number of functions within the game. Most obviously it provides a high level interaction for players getting involved in the high level politics of the galaxy. While there is a higher level abstraction of the superpowers which is controlled by us, it is influenced by the actions that occur within powerplay. The powers are the principal movers and shakers and so provide a framework for guided activity and story within the game. As with other parts of the game this will continue to be refined and expanded as we progress.**

&gt;**Beyond that the powers add some useful geography to the game. At it most simplistic you have the bubbles on the map that help give it shape and makes it easier to navigate several hundred thousand stars. On a star system level is creates predictable effects that ownership by the power provides.**

&gt;**The third major benefit is an additional layer of dynamism within the galaxy, laws changes, benefits and hindrances change with power ownership which increases the level of variety within the game.**

&gt;**It's clear that some players don't like it - and that's fine, the game is about choice and there are different areas of the game that people enjoy or dislike. Some people don't like trading, others don't like combat, some can't appreciate the joy of discovering an earth-like planet in a new star system. That's all fine because it's a choice that you as a player make :-)**

&gt;Hello Commanders!

&gt;Just to let you guys know, we have *not* stopped work on the background simulation. 

&gt;Clearly there are some issues that we're working through with the way that states interact with each other, and some where influence formulas don't return the results we expect (or think appropriate). I guess it's fair to say that this stuff can get pretty complex.

&gt;We're also still looking at more ways for minor faction interaction to join up with Power interactions and general iterations to improve the experience overall. 

&gt;Player feedback and our long term commitment ensure that this work remains ongoing: we're going to be working on the background simulation until it hits all the notes we're aiming for. It isn't going to happen straight away, but the plan is to keep going.

&gt;I can't give you ETAs for this stuff right now, all I can say is: we haven't given up!

Playing Solo they have no issues, they go about their thing as they like.  Playing Open &amp; Group, they're able to wing/meet up with fellow pilots and PvE/PvP to their heart's content.

For other players however, ED is a nightmare, especially in Open.  Not seeing other players, invisible NPCs firing on their wingmates, empty instances, a small number of cheaters/hackers etc.  This is all due to FDev's initial development choice of P2P networking between players, managed by transaction and matchmaking servers, and the discrepancies of UPNP router/LAN implementations.

Then apparently *instead* of fixing these networking issues with ED, FDev announce a new gamemode called CQC (cue grumbles) that's coming to Xbox *first* (more grumbles) and sits outside of the galaxy sim (grumble city).  **Wait, what?!**

===

And breathe.  Don't worry, this post isn't to discuss which of the networking models are the better option - P2P, Client/Server, or Hybrid P2P with Supernodes - as there are plenty of threads on that elsewhere.  For those needing some background info on the topic, here's my [post on a P2P &amp; C/S thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3dxb4x/if_some_companies_selling_freetoplay_games_can/ct9j50l) earlier today:

&gt; the major advantage (of P2P) is lower network data-communication latency between players with stable connections.

&gt; In a client/server setup, if two players have a 50ms ping to their server, the communication latency between them is 50ms*2 + server-calculation-time. If each has 100ms ping, then 200ms + server-calc-time.

&gt; In p2p setup, the latency time is dependent on the pings between players, so if the ping is 50ms then the latency is 50ms. Much more responsive.

&gt; The difficulties some players keep encountering are due to one or more of the following:

&gt; * Matchmaking (which decides which players to p2p together) server issues - [half dozen fixes are on their way](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=165393&amp;page=2&amp;p=2524226&amp;viewfull=1#post2524226).
&gt; * Player's router/networking UPNP issues - some players have seen the issues vanish by setting up port-forwarding. Therefore their router was causing the problem (poor UPNP implementation).
&gt; * Players trying to group up (ergo matchmake) with players a great distance away, resulting in high pings between them. This issue isn't seen in client/server setups as players are pushed to play on their local server (UK/Europe, USA, Australia, etc), limiting high ping variation.
&gt; * Players with poor/unreliable internet connections.

&gt; A few players have suggested adding Supernodes to the existing P2P setup, to assist in congested areas by acting as P2P reinforcement. This would be the best of both setups, as it's a hybrid of P2P and client/server.

===

Instead I'll be discussing the current development of fixes/improvements to ED as a whole, on all platforms; triggered by a few thoughts I had earlier today.

To fix any issue, the devs need to identify the actual problem from the symptoms caused (invisible NPCs for example), and then isolate one-by-one the probable factors causing the identified problem - test one variable at a time.  The nightmare of PC gaming, and Mac to a lesser extent, is hardware/software/drivers/router configurations change wildly from player to player; a huge number of variables for the devs.

Then Microsoft came along and offered their long-time game partners FDev a lump of cash to port ED to the Xbox One, and give exclusivity over PS4.  Oh, and make the game more action-oriented to satisfy the Xbox core demographic.  While us PC/Mac players have been frustrated by this, it's actually **an extremely good thing for everyone**.

===

ED on Xbox is in the Game Preview Program allowing FDev enormous flexibility regarding updates, bug fixes and tweaks.  It's not a released game, therefore the Xbox community understand it can be buggy &amp; have major issues as per alpha/beta testing.  The hardware/software/drivers are all constant - only the routers will change between players.  A good testing ground for the P2P structure.  It gets better though.

CQC is an arena game and won't have players transitioning from instance to instance like with the ED galaxy.  The matchmaking server will join all match-players in one instance for the whole match-round.  Better yet, this match-making occurs within the match-lobby prior to match start, during which targeted logs can record any problems with P2P connectivity between players, ready for the underlying issues to be identified - without hardware/software/driver discrepancies interfering.  And any changes FDev make here can't affect the wider Galaxy whatsoever.  Heck FDev could even trial Supernodes (if they are even needed) to reinforce the P2P network during the Xbox CQC beta and we'd be none-the-wiser.  Not bad considering Microsoft are effectively footing the bill ;)

===

Eventually, we the players *should* get:

* Better, more reliable networking &amp; multiplayer gameplay
* A few optional jump-in-and-out PvP gamemodes
* More players on more formats
* An all round better game :)

**[Described as a key expansion in the ED Kickstarter, under Future Plans:](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous/description)**

&gt;The initial release of Elite: Dangerous doesn't mark the end of development. We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features. A good example of this is planetary landings. We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add leaving the ships so you can explore space stations or board enemy vessels or even just to look around your own.

&gt;The main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.

&gt;Really big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to £80 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.

&gt;PLanding features will include: cities, animals, trees, plants

**[Ashley, Sandy &amp; Michael Brookes' comments on the expansion back in April 2013:](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=5659)**

&gt; Ashley: There are of course some updates that we have already announced will be coming. The most notable and anticipated of these is of course seamless planetary landings. Whilst it wouldn’t be sharing anything new with you to confirm this feature post-launch, I can confirm that we hope to implement it within a year of release, if possible

&gt; Sandy: Definitely yes. Hopefully (barring issues) within the first year post-release

&gt; Michael: Yes, we’ll be looking to add landings in updates after the game’s intial release. We’ll provide more details nearer the time.

&gt; **[DevonX: I am very interested to hear more about the planetary landing. What is planned? How much detail will there be on the planets? Are they going to be limited in any way?](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=20371&amp;p=455847&amp;viewfull=1#post455847)**

&gt; Planetary landings won't be a single thing. I think I've said before - it is what is down there that makes planetary landings compelling - and please remember all of this will be after first release of the game.

&gt; I imagine we will start with landings on airless moons. You would be able to see heavy industry, craters up close, and ultimately be able to deposit things on the surface (stash cargo or mining machines). Atmospheric worlds are a bigger challenge - whether rocky or gas giant in nature - and a key element there is the atmosphere. They should have rich cloudscapes with lightning, turbulence etc.

&gt; The biggest challenge is with what we call 'outdoor worlds'. I would want rich and varied vegetation, wildlife, and so on.

&gt; **[Granite: How much of a technical challenge do you think planetary landings will be?](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=20371&amp;p=455847&amp;viewfull=1#post455847)**

&gt; The landings themselves are not the technical issue, it is the vast size of planets, and the prodigious amount of content required to make them interesting. We can generate the landscapes procedurally, but you need interesting things there to make them compelling.

Granite's question and a trimmed version of David's answer was also posted in the [Nov 2014 Q&amp;A](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=60284&amp;page=2&amp;p=1024338&amp;viewfull=1#post1024338).

&gt; ""We could do that now, but it would be empty, an empty experience.  You'd see a featureless grey landscape, maybe with a building on it.  I did landing on planets in Frontier (Elite II) in 1993; I sort of regretted it, I put a lot of effort into the procedurally-generated cities but they all felt the same.""

&gt; ""To do that well, I want to get out in a buggy, to be able to drive around, to meet other players.  There's a lot of infrastructure we need to make that work really well""

&gt; But that won’t stop development.  We plan to continue to significantly enhance the game via further expansions after the launch date, using the same incremental development philosophy that we’ve used so far.
 
&gt;Major new features will include planetary landings and even walking around inside ships, stations, and planet surfaces with time.
 
&gt;For those who have a Lifetime Expansion Pass (included in Premium Beta and Alpha, and also still available here until 29th July 2014) all such significant expansion will be included.  Those without the Lifetime Expansion Pass will be charged for each expansion as they are released.
 
&gt;We have made no secret that our ultimate ambition is to be able to land on the surface of planets, as you were able to in the other Elite sequels Frontier and Frontier: First Encounters. 
 
&gt;We want this feature to push the boundaries as we believe we are doing in other areas of Elite: Dangerous already, like space flight, combat, trading, sound, online, visual fidelity etc.
 
&gt;That means rich, varied experiences.  Not just landing pads, but rich content on the surfaces, surface vehicles, the ability to stash things there, to explore. Clearly ‘doing it right’ like this will take time, but we have a plan and will get there via a series of meaningful releases.
 
&gt;We believe that each stage will be incredible, and the result truly breathtaking. What you will see on the worlds will be a mix of procedurally generated content, particularly the landscapes, cloudscapes, compositions and so on, mixed with hand-crafted elements.

**[Eurogamer's interview with David Braben on ED, March 2015:](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-06-elite-dangerous-xbox-one-console-david-braben)**

&gt; I would like to see me building on it forever. For a very long time. There is so much more we can do, that I've already talked about - we've talked about landing on planets, walking around inside your spaceship, ship to ship boarding, all of those things. We've also said we'd have free updates, and paid for updates. It's all very exciting!

&gt; All our planets are built using a sophisticated simulation so that one day you can get close to them. Really close. Right now every planet can only be observed from afar, but Elite: Dangerous is designed for the future, and by sticking to the simulation and constantly improving it to make it as real as possible, we can be sure the canyons and mountains you see from space will accurately be reflected when you skim close to the surface, or even land upon it.

**Speculation &amp; Questions about PLandings:**

* Beta access available to beta-backers with Lifetime Expansion Pass? (very high chance)
* Beta access available to beta-backers if they pre-order it? (high chance)
* New missions incoming e.g. photographing colony sites, bombing structures?
* Dramatically different atmospheric flying abilities of ships?
* Gated in-game via Atmospheric Shielding ship module - ships without one will burn up in plantary atmosphere as in FE2 &amp; FFE?

* How is a station captured? Extensive combat against station defence-lasers &amp; ships, while causing damage to the station? Delivering propaganda leaflets?  Destroying traders?  Does this work for Open, Group and Solo?
* How is a station defended?  Can NPCs be spawned, if so is there a limit?  Conseqeuently how would NPC management work?
* Can a station be destroyed? If so how can a station be created/built to replace it? Is it fun &amp; doable?
* Can station control be lost due to inactivity and/or poor management? How?
* What tasks do players have when they actually manage a station? Are these fun?
* Does a station manager have to park in a station all of the time? Won't this detract from One-Man-One-Ship gameplay? If not how will remote management work?
* If stations are to be run by guilds, what options/tasks/roles are given to guild members? Can these be done remotely, only in-system, or only in-no-fire-zone, or docked?  What happens if a player doesn't do said task?
* What's the point of controlling a station? Simply bragging rights?
* Is a station a revenue generator? How is revenue generated, taxes on trade, fines for loitering?
* Control/restriction of station commodities? How is this defined? Can types and availability of commodities be changed? How?
* Control/restriction of station functions (e.g. Shipyard, Upgrades, choices of available parts etc)? How is this defined? Can availability and types be changed? How?

&gt;Developer update: After investigating the issue, what we saw this morning was the result of the overly agressive ramp for the overhead calculation. Which as mentioned last week, we felt, needed to be reduced. 

&gt;*Details can be found below*

&gt;Investigating Arissa’s woes in the current cycle, we’re looking at making the following tweaks:

&gt;We’ve pushed out our proposed change to the system overhead cost that we [floated in the last update](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=163495), effectively removing the brick wall stopping large powers expanding whilst retaining the concept of increased effort for expanding the powerbase.

&gt;This softening of overhead costs will also take Arissa out of deficit this turn, as well as angle the game play more towards where we want it to go (less being stopped by arbitrary walls).
Alongside this, we’ll be raising up Arissa’s systems out of turmoil to match this change.
Both of these changes should be coming through very shortly.

&gt;Going forward, for the next cycle, we’re looking to simplify how overhead is calculated, applying it based on control systems rather than all exploited systems. This should hopefully make it a little easier to consider.

&gt;In addition, we’re taking a look at player action availability, to reduce the chance of Commanders unwittingly sabotaging their own power: Currently, when a power falls into a CC deficit, although new preparation is halted, expansion still takes place for successful preparation from the previous cycle. This drives the power deeper into deficit, which is compounded by overhead costs.

&gt;So we’re going to gate expansion behind a CC wall: we’re going to prevent expansion taking place when a power is in deficit, and we’re going to prevent expansion succeeding if ownership of the system would push the power into deficit.

&gt;These changes won’t stop Commanders from having the ability to make poor or good choices (you can still expand into low value systems); it will simply stop them from compounded the quality choices (and hopefully limit the effects of any fifth column elements – Commanders that join a power simply to sabotage it).

&gt;As an aside, we will also be applying a fix to the merit system that should ensure merit decay is working as intended. So from the next cycle onwards expect that change to be active.
Past the immediate future of the current and next cycle, we’re still chewing over the concept of targeted strikes – we’ll update you folk on this when we’ve come to a decision.
