109,"New home owner here.

I'll put it as simply as I can. My wife and I just took out a loan for $196K. If we make only minimum payments for 30 yrs, we will pay back $308K ($112K) interest with 3.250 interest rate. This is about $800 per month. 

If we overpay to total $1200 a month, then we will pay back $256K in 17 years. Thats only about $70K interest.

Interest is calculated like this:
(**Note thats this is only for fixed interest rates only because they are the most common and most recommended**)

Take the annual interest rate of 3.25% and convert to decimal which is .0325. Now divide that by 12 for each month in a year and you get .0028 (rounded up for all numbers mentioned). Now multiply that by the amount in which you owe, first month being $196K. Interest for first month is ~$531.

So since we are paying roughly $1200 per month, $670 is going towards principle. The following month would be the exact same formula, except replace $196K with $195,330. 

Also as a tip of advice, make sure you have a contract **IN WRITING** that says there are no overpayment penalties. Otherwise  you are shooting yourself in the foot.",2016-05-30 04:20:25+00:00,d3ot52o,1.0,t3_4lkhxr,52040.0,personalfinance

Coolheaded- Performing a headshot reduces all skill cooldowns by x%. Pair this with the flash bang mod to help with annoying shotgunners/big bosses. Shoot them in the head while they're blind to almost immediately refill skills. Rinse/repeat.

Determined - Killing a target reduces skill cooldowns by x%. This will help when you have no one else to headshot and prepare for next wave.


And these character talents (1st one is almost mandatory for any electronic build. The rest are strictly if using the BFB mod):

The most important talent is Triage - Heal an ally with a skill to reduce skill cooldowns by 15%. When healing a full party, this almost instantly refills your skills.

Demolition Expert - Kill a hostile with an explosion to increase explosion damage by 40% for 15 seconds.

Shrapnel - Applying bleed to any target triggers a 30% chance to apply the effect to all targets within 10m.

Chain Reaction - Damage multiple hostiles with an explosion to apply 40% more damage from the blast.

Attacker - One that shoots a ""tranquilizer round"" at an enemy, reducing his speed by 1 (doesn’t work on operators with lowest default speed).

182,"Pretend that they did disprove the blood sample. This would cause a mistrial due to errors in the court proceedings. It would prove that someone took his blood that was collected in 1985, and planted it in the car. The case would then be re-tried due to the nature of the crime. Someone definitely killed her but sadly we may never know the truth. Brendan's ""confession"", in addition to the blood/key found, was damning to the defense. Even if they prove that his blood was planted, it does not necessarily prove his innocence. If a new jury believes Brendan's ""confession"", then it's very possible he could be convicted again. But personally, the first trial should've been done WAY differently. The insane amount of conflict of interest alone should've warranted it, not to mention the ""investigative techniques"" used on Brendan. Oh and how the day of Brendan's confession, they magically find the bullet with her blood on it? How effing convenient. If I was a judge, I would've tried my best to ensure that there was no bias in the court, however possible. Would definitely like to see another trial. 

Now Brendan [in my opinion] is screwed wither way. He admitted to the crime.  There's nothing but his word saying that he is innocent. No DNA evidence supporting his innocence or guilt. If the [new] prosecution could convince the judge to dismiss the confessions/drawings, then that would be MONEY for the defense. That's literally the only thing tying him to this crime [and the phone call].

But like I said, a mistrial would definitely come of the results that prove that his blood was planted. I am very curious to see how this plays out.
