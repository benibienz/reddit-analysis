I want to be able to post AND EMBED videos from my Youtube account to one of my Facebook groups automatically using IFTTT. I upload videos to my Youtube account from my PS4. I have this set to a trigger that whenever I upload a public video to Youtube, it sends an email to my Facebook Group's email (which is formatted GroupNameHere@groups.facebook.com) and it posts to the group and only group members can know that I posted it and see it.

THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT ONLY POSTS THE LINK AND DOES NOT EMBED THE VIDEO. So people have to click on the link and it will take them to Youtube (This is actually a 2-way problem. Facebook doesn't auto recognize the URL and does not embed it and the IFTTT app does not let you post to a Facebook Group direclty for some reason). I want them to be able to watch the video on Facebook. This is the only way I have been able to get the app to post to a facebook group.

Here it what I have attempted and none has worked: 1. I have left just the ""URL"" option in the body and it posts fine, but it's just a link. It doesn't embed. 2. In the recipe, I have tried selecting ""Embedded Code"" from the body. The code is different on Youtube than Facebook so the email never sends and the post never even happens. 3. I have tried using both the ""URL"" and ""Embedded Code"" option together (Basically when you select ""URL"", it will automatically grab the URL from the video in which the trigger was from). 4. I have tried using the following HTML code that Youtube uses for embedding. I replace the actual URL with the ""URL"" option from IFTTT. Here is an example:

&lt;iframe width=""854"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/C73INHh4Big"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

THEN I PUT IT LIKE THIS IS IFTTT

&lt;iframe width=""854"" height=""480"" src=""URL"" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

AND

&lt;iframe width=""854"" height=""480"" src=URL allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Neither option sends the email or posts to the group.

Any help anyone can provide would be great. Please remember that I am only interested in posting to a Facebook group and embedding the video. Thank you.
