1) Luxury Resources.
 As far as I am aware you get 4 copies of each luxury resource per 1 you have and after that it does not increase? So if I have more than 1 cocoa it's basically useless and I should trade correct? I may be slightly wrong it's actually up to 8 but then the question just changes to if I have more than 2.

Another on Luxury Resources. If I settle ONTOP of a luxury resource do I automatically acquire it and I don't have to improve the tile? 

2)Trade Routes.
In my very novice playing of Civ 5 I recall Trade routes being amazing. Is that still true for Civ 6? Should I be aiming for reaching the cap at all times, say if I am at 4/8 trade routes active I need to work on that? 

3)Bonuses that extend tiles. 
Do these stack from say, Power Plant? So if I have two city centers (city A and B) that are 6 tiles away from another city center (City c) does city C get that bonus from both? Should I be shooting for keeping cities 6 tiles away from each other and no further as a general rule?
So with Zoo could I technically just have one then have a bunch of other cities 6 tiles away around it and not have to worry about building zoos in those?...

4)Future Tech
I don-.... What's the purpose?

Thank you for anyone that takes the time to answer these and if I need to clarify I will gladly! Hard to get what I am asking sometimes. 

Thanks!

2)There is a part in the rules talking about Risk Card turn ins and how you can turn in 3 of one for 4 MODS and then another for 6 or something like that... Is that talking about the command cards? Because in most risks you turn in 3 land cards for x amount of troops. Does this not apply to 2210? It says you can turn in a sixth set but you can only acquire 5 land/risk cards so how is that possible?

3)Are commanders counted as a MOD or are they a modifier like in Metal Gear Solid risk? I.E if you lose all the MODS in a territory and you have a commander left, do you still get to roll or does he die with the last MOD?

He LOVES people and is extremely friendly, has never shown any aggression to a single person but sometimes he will bark at people outside and it comes off as very aggressive and it's pretty embarrassing for me. There doesn't seem to be a correlation, sometimes it's on leash, sometimes it's off leash, sometimes it's a guy, sometimes a girl. I know a lot of people recommend treating high value treats BEFORE they bark and see a person but I can never know if he's gonna bark at someone or not... Should I just do it with every single person? I have socialized him pretty well, but do I need to socialize him more or are we past that?

For example, with PokemonGO I took him to my campus and he didn't bark at a single soul and was just the happiest little pup (he is a little sketchy when people try to pet him but once they get that first pet in he is their best friend) but sometimes if I take him for a walk he'll just bark bark bark...

But I do have a few concerns.

Potty Training - He is REALLY good about whining and letting me know he has to go outside when I am sleeping overnight, and he has only peed in my bed one time. So I assume he knows outside is the place to potty. I treat him the second he is done peeing (I split the treat in half just incase he also poops) say good boy in high pitch etc. But sometimes randomly he will just pee with no warning (mind you it's ONLY when roaming my apartment, he's perfect in his crate and bed). Is this just a ""accidents happen at this age""? Or does he not know to go outside and I just am really good at timing when he has to go? He's only peed in my carpet 6 times in 3 weeks so I want to say we are good but not sure how to teach him to hold it when he's roaming my apartment. 

Leash Training- He is absolutely terrible at this, I have read on this subreddit and other places it's expecting too much at such a young age but I do live in an apartment complex with many cars that do speed. He's fine walking by my side most of the time, but sometimes he does dart away. How do I get him adjusted to leash? He most of the time will just sit and not wanna move, and try to play with it like a toy. 

Lastly, he whines a bit. Just randomly walking around the apartment and it will be after we go outside, he's been fed, played with, etc. Should I just ignore him till he stops? I don't want him to just whine randomly a lot!

I'm ok with leveling the classes to unlock the jobs, but I don't want to level a Warrior, Dark Knight, and Paladin because it will take me a long time to get to max since I intend on doing Monk!

It was fine for a little bit, an occasional graphics glitch in a few games, then about 2 days later it just kept doing a soft restart with some lines going across my screen. Now it just blue screens and am unable to do anything on it. 

I don't mind buying a new one because I've been wanting to get a 970, I don't want to bust out with all of my money to have the real problem be my CPU or something. Any ideas how to test?

I've got probably 10 games now with variances between both expansions and the core game and I like to say I always am a threat and am near the top on most games. I've won 3 now and I believe I am atleast decent at this board game but Jesus... The Lannisters in the dance expansion is the toughest time I've ever had. 

I've won with the Lannisters in feast and also won 90% of my battles that game no matter what people threw at me but man. I lost my first battle and after that it just snowballed because the Lannisters rely on being victorious or attacking in most card situations. 

Has anyone won with them in Dance? What would you say you did best? Diplomacy? Battles? Currency? I just don't know how I could have won aside from a few mistakes.
