1," The Chinese invasion of smartphone market in India has been underway for quite sometime now. Meizu, one of the top 10 manufacturers in China now wants to make its presence felt in the Indian market. The m2 is its latest offering and we take a closer look at the device:


Looks and design 

The m2 is a sturdy looking no-nonsense device and comes with a single home screen button. It looks like an earlier generation of Apple’s iPhone and the solitary button serves the purpose of both Home button and Back button. A single tap serves the function of Back whereas if you press the button it takes you to the Home screen. 

The display of m2 is anything but spectacular and the 5-inch 720*1080 pixel screen is decent. The resolution and colours come out fairly well but they certainly don’t dazzle you. 


Performance

The m2 is a 4G-capable dual-sim device and comes packed with 2GB of RAM which runs on a 1.3 GHz MediaTek MT6735 processor. It runs on Flyme 4.5, a customized skin based on Android 5.1. m2 doesn’t look like most other Android phones courtesy the skin and delivers pretty decent performance. Since it runs on Flyme, a lot of Android users might find it a bit irritating to work on. For instance, the settings menu has a two-layered interface and gives a very complex working experience. However after a while – as is the case with most phones – one does get used to the skin and its features. 

Camera

The 13MP rear camera doesn’t deliver great images but since m2 is a budget phone, one shouldn’t have sky-high expectations. It takes time to switch between modes and the final image quality won’t leave you too thrilled. Images clicked after zooming in were pretty blurry and camera certainly won’t be the reason to buy this phone. 

Battery

The battery life of m2 is good and after heavy usage the phone does last for almost an entire day. However, while playing games we did feel that the device heated. 

Verdict
At Rs 6,999, the m2 is a good phone for the price it commands. Decent looks, sturdy performance, an average camera and good battery life -- there are quite a few things going for m2 and it might just find more than its fair share of takers. It’s always tricky to pick a budget phone – more so when it’s a Chinese brand – but the m2 is certainly an option that could appeal to users in sub-7k price segment.
