17,"I'm not supposed to know that my father has cheated on my mother several times.

I was born in a third world country and my family was fairly wealthy. We had servants to do this and that and my parents were both bankers, so my brother and I were financially set for a while. However, unbeknownst to my brother and I, my father was secretly sleeping with one of the servants. The servant was technically my mother's servant. (Servants aren't technically considered 'property' like slaves were, but they typically follow the family line and so this servant came from my mothers family to work for her and her husband- my father.) 

My mother knew about the entire scandal but put up with his shit so that my brother and I could grow up with a proper family, or at least feel like we did. She sacrificed a lot for us, and it was heartbreaking when I finally found out.

How I found out- I visited my father when he had a heart-attack, and the doctors explained the woman who brought him.

Edit: Clarity that my father cheated on my mother several times throughout their marriage, from when I was a child and to this day.",2015-12-07 06:20:42+00:00,cxq0ndq,1,t3_3vp7bs,35469,AskReddit
18,"How about when they ask each other what the other is doing there and they both find out that you sent them there to find out about each other? There's the possibility that it ends in neither of them speaking to you afterward. Don't forget to take that into account. If you choose this path, be ready to lose one or both of them. Anyway, I've not got much of a better idea, but I do hope you find peace or an answer...which ever comes first. Maybe simply staying out of it is the best option for you, I learned through the hard way to sometimes simply keep out of certain dilemmas between people.

I taught her the basics of longboarding and she made great progress within the day.
