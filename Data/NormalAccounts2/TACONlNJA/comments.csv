101,"&gt;BF1 is simply put an upgrade

Maybe im missing something but I don't see how the hell a ww1 shooter can be a straight upgrade over a modern shooter. It's two different game types.

&gt;BF3 damage based hit markers are barely noticeable 

? Is this a joke? A score number literally appears near your cross hair that tells you exactly how much damage you did. And as for the UI of bf1 in general, it seemed pretty lacking.

There are more duped ubhps than UTs right now, yet somehow that's not a problem for anyone. Oh no, it's only a problem with UTs somehow.

UTs should be unsoulbound. Any players who didn't play when they were tradable should think about how they would feel if t6 rings ST items, hell maybe even WC tops were untradable. Anyone complaining about the amount of duped that are sitting in mules should think about how many times they've actually gotten a UBHP drop... then think about how many ubhps are in circulation. 

Also pets abilities should be removed, no refunds should be given. If you spend money on anything virtual you need to realize things can be devalued or changed. Good example is that one rare dog in dota that went from 10s of thousands to basically worthless in one update.

Edit: Actually the ""farm for it and hard work"" to get UTs is probably the worst argument of all and makes my blood boil. It's pure dumbshit luck.

If you watched a giga killed by two rexes it was either super low level vs max level rexes, or unridden, or both because a ridden, equally leveled giga will beat two, three, or maybe 10 rexes easily. My lvl 200 giga had 200 melee, so doing 2400 dmg a hit, with 30k HP and an ascendant 90 armor saddle, vs a lvl 250 Rex with 22k HP and 400 melee, so 240 dmg a hit. And the rexes will almost always have a weaker saddle because they aren't in underwater drops. If I had had 10 of those 250 rexes, they still wouldn't stand a chance vs the giga, because it will only take 10-30 bites for the giga to kill them, while the rexes will need upwards of 400 bites to kill the giga. Even divided by 10 for all the rexes, with rexes having a 75 armor saddle(99% not going to happen) they lose by 10 bites.",2016-04-30 20:10:44+00:00,d2nntt3,12.0,t1_d2nm273,2935.0,ARKone

And that lvl 60 may have just been a lucky roll for us, because our lvl 56 and 69 gigas, after being leveled, both have 29 melee, and our lvl 73 has 39

2925,"Okay. Here is the full history of our server as I know it.

Long ago, there was a Chinese streaming group in charge of our server. Their name was ZQTV, and they enjoyed sniping noobs on the beach. The whole server banded together to take them out. The main guys I know who were a part of this were silv, whiteorc, and greed. They were successful, and silv and whiteorcs tribe, gentleman's club, ruled the server

This was before my time, so I don't know much about it, but my tribe owner says they were decent. Then, apparently, one day they kicked greed from the GC. The story is that he used a hack to rejoin and get admin rights. He completely wiped every one of their structures. Not a thing was left. Silv I guess started again. Whiteorc left.

The next biggest tribe, InGen, took over. Some Chinese came back, and griefed/raided people under the tribe name au to man. They were kinda dicks I think, a few days after I joined the server they were threatening Cashville-friendly to remove their mining base from the volcano(Wasn't blocking any spawns). Anyway, I lived solo next to cashville and two other guys, a+gamer and Brian. The big tribes were Goon Squad, Mr Clean, SmexyCats and Goblins International.
 
A+gamer got raided by someone, don't know who. That day I saw someone from cashville asking if InGen had killed one of their dinos(October, before tribe logs). They said something along the lines of, if we wanted to kill you you would be gone. The next day when I logged in cashville had been raided by InGen. All of their dinos were killed. I later found out that Silv took in their 5 or 6 remaining dinos at his base. 

A few days later I was running outside of cashville with my dilo when 3 of them came up to me, and asked if I would like to join. After a while I said yes. Some time passed with not too much happening, just things like imprisoning au to man. 

Then one day, word came in chat that InGen had merged with someone called HH, and they were raiding Smexy. They succeeded, raided some others as well, and we were scared. Then the biome update came. HH was killing anyone inside the snow. The server decided we had to take a stand before anyone else got wiped. Goons, steel birds, Mr Clean, silv and us all attacked. I had to get off after about an hour, and when I logged on the next day I asked my leader how it went. He said they did pretty good damage, but had to log off at 3 am. It turns out when we logged off, they offline raided Goons, the biggest tribe we had.

We got word of others being hit, and we were very scared. For some reason, we were left alone. Goblins kept attacking a fairly new tribe named uXa who were being assholes to other nwere people, and apparently they were allied with hh because goblins got attacked because of it.

Some more time passed, and a tribe named Cure joined the server. They were attacking anyone they came across, with nothing but some armor, a pistol and a club. People accused silv of bringing them back to take out hh. Eventually, silv got angry I guess, and joined them, saying if people think I'm a bad guy, I will be. I'd like to take this moment to explain Silvs base. It was a metal wall in the metal lake, surrounding a metal base on pillars. He had hundreds of plant X and turrets. It was the most impressive base I've ever seen, as all of this was done pre-quetzal. And it was almost impenetrable.

For a month or more war raged between cure and hh, with cure defending 17 or more raids from quetzals. Somewhere in this period, while we were mining, a hh guy on an argent showed up and killed our anky as I flew my battle ptera to defend the guys mining. We evacuated as best we could, getting 2 of our birds and our paracer back to base. But our leader flew back for more metal, and hh showed up on a giga. Two birds were killed, Orangewing and Zinky. Again I flew my battle ptera toward the mining base, but it was too late. They had a battle quetz as air cover, and I could only watch as every piece of our mining base was destroyed. 

Also I'd like to mention that around the time of the hh takeover, some Brazilians named Tribalistas began to build near us. They got to be pretty huge, and a little while after the giga update, while cure vs hh was raging, uXa attacked one of Tribals quetzals. They got mad, and raided uXa. Due to the war with cure, hh couldn't help them. Despite two uXa gigas, tribal eventually ran them out two or three weeks later.

After raid 17 by HH, silv and cure gave up, and quit the server, citing OP quetzals and grind as the reason. A long while last with not much action. One day we noticed ragnarok, an old tribe had vanished. Things like that would happen with different tribes. A tribe named G-Crew who had started during the cure-HH war got wiped by HH and was mad in global. 

Some time passed, Killdja and tribal built up until the winter update. HH used their quetzals to secure all drops, and one night used a dodorex to wipe tribal. The next day, I logged in to Killdja raging in chat against HH, apparently they had decided they had no chance, and had attacked HH. So obviously they were wiped after doing a little damage against HH.

This left us and HH as the only metal tier tribes on the server. Some noob tribes built up, survivors, paradox, and chupacabras. They had some metal and stuff. One day survivors raided paradox cuz paradox rented a spino to a newer tribe to raid someone. It was like 1v5, not very fair, and survivors still did pretty bad, but killed all of paradox.

More time passes, and 2 days ago hh wipes survivors, chupacabras, and anyone else they found, and gave everything of theirs to us. That's my story.",2016-01-31 21:15:36+00:00,cziy0j7,1.0,t3_43ko2i,3917.0,playark

After about a week, my tactics kinda stopped working. Having racked up 400 kills on it, it went back into being just another gun in my inventory.

For a few weeks I would do nothing but fly around killing things, cooking meat when I got back to base, and logging off. He had 3.5k HP and 2.2k melee. Sadly after the nerf I don't really use him anymore, with 460 something melee he is far too weak to kill things in less than 30 seconds which is just boring :(.

Another favorite is Steve the stego. It was a pirate server, freshly wiped, and I was determined to make swamp island my home. After dying to many compies, I finally managed to make tranqs and a bow. Then, there he was: lvl 70 male stego. Bam. Knocked out, fed mejo. 10-20 mins later, tamed. We would use him to get berries or whatever. Eventually a tribe tried to settle on our island. We warned them to leave, and they kept building. So that afternoon, we raided them. We took in Steve and our lvl 100 carno, and after an intense fight they emerged victorious, Steve having more than 15 dino kills. It was fun :D

3434,"Hey jat, my biggest concern from this ""balance update"" is that there were two main dinos that almost everyone in the game felt were unbalanced. These being the quetzal, and the giga. Now, it seems to me, that instead of this update bringing them in line with the rest of the dinos, they became even more ridiculous than before.

 All dinos which formerly were able to outclass giga in HP, mainly dinos which are built to be tanks, such as the paracer and brontosaurus, are unable to get anywhere close to the 50k hp level of the giganoto. My previously 140k HP bronto, which in the past was about 60k more than a giga, is now around 23k, 27k LESS than the average giga. This does not feel like balance to me. In addition(correct me if I'm wrong, don't know if the wiki is up to date) the giga still has 1200 base damage. Pre-231, by turning your spino/Rex into a bit of a glass cannon, it was possible to achieve this by pumping 2000+% melee damage. Now, no dino can in their wildest dreams hope to come close to this.

And next, quetzals. They did not need this extra +33%. I would argue, in fact, that they needed more of a nerf than they had earlier. Now, nerfing explosives, ranged weapons, and turrets on them? I think they can most likely tank even harder than they could before 231, where they would literally fly into tons of plant X and eat them up. 

For these reasons, I and others don't feel like this was a balance update at all. Rather we feel it is a nerf for anything that is not part of the Big Two alpha tribe play toys. people worked hard for high level dinos, who now gain such tiny amounts by leveling melee that it feels worthless. 210 spino gains 6% melee per level, aka 3 damage. I don't see a point in taming and leveling dinos anymore.",2016-01-07 05:15:19+00:00,cyp0pra,3.0,t1_cyozqw7,1893.0,playark

If you have like two rexes over lvl 100 just go for the brood mother right now man, its really weak tbh. Or a single giga can solo it easy as fuck. Idk once you get so high there is really nothing to do.  

One thing the alpha tribe on my server does is host ""events"" every Sunday. They built a big ass metal arena, and the whole server comes and fights for prizes. All things are provided by the alpha tribe. There have been frog fights, club battles, bow and arrow, pike, sword and shield, etc. Prizes have been 116 kibble argents, frogs, mammoths, and mastercraft bows. If you guys are the biggest on your server, and are generally friendly, it will go a long way to making you regarded as ""good"" leaders, and make revolutions less likely. Doesn't really work for the tribe on my server as they are assholes any other time of the week, but the events are great fun :)

I wouldn't go for spending resources on things like these events so early on though. Make sure you have tons and tons of both metal and plant X turrets, high number of close to max level rexes/spinos and gigas, 5+ turret quetzals, and lots of war pteras/argents before branching off and spending time on stuff that doesn't help you progress.",2016-01-01 06:08:54+00:00,cyi3edp,5.0,t1_cyi34sa,818.0,ARKone

Fully metal base or something like that, and you use guns like assault rifle not because they are viable cost wise(they arent) but just because you can. Maybe you guys have somehow managed to get to this but my tribe which has been playing since October/September is nowhere near this(Granted we are only 3 people). However maybe I am wrong and you guys are insane at grinding. I guess for Xbox these dinos will be lower levels since it is max level 60 but still takes quite a while to get these things.

3881,"Thank you man for trying to help. There was a tribe of 10-15 people who actually were trying to take them down for a month or two a while ago. They would do raids and take out 60-70 dinos of the alpha tribe. However according to the leader of them who was the oldest player on our server, they use ESP and any possible exploit they can find. He made many hidden supply caches one day and they found every single one of them by the time he logged on next. He had a base fully metal in the lake with metal underneath and successfully defended 17 raids where they would try to glitch in with rafts, and hover out of render range shooting from their catapults. Eventually after this last one he gave up, and has quit ark after 2.1k hours on the server. 

So basically, if I wished to do this I would have maybe 1 or two days before they know it is me and search out all of the supply caches. Also if I threw grenades at them, wouldn't turrets shoot them out? How much nades do I need to kill a giganoto? They have a LOT of those.

In addition I don't think I would want to risk my precious lvl 218 ptera which I have owned since September or october, or my 200 spino or the rest of my tribes base and dinos.

It is better in every single way, and the rage is hard to activate. But despite all this, you have been silent on it. I have not seen you respond and give your reasoning on why it is a single time, to anyone. 2) The quetzal. There is no counter to this thing. It flies with the speed of a ptera, has the HP of a bronto or paracer, can fly away from any fight it thinks it can't win, and can be loaded with turrets to instantly decimate an opponent. 3) Insane grind for newly added items. The modern bed is completely ridiculous when you can just build 2 beds.

1. Thank you for the oviraptor, it helps out a bit. When will the other useful dinos be added? By this I mean things that make the job of farming and upkeep for your base a bit simpler. Main three things I am very much looking forward to are dung beetle, scuba amphibian, and dunkle. I mean, as interesting as compies are, they do not help with anything.

2. You mentioned a few digests ago there will be a ""hold your breath"" feature to remove the scope sway. When can we expect this?

3. Beacons desperately need rebalancing. Red drops are almost worthless, giving a blueprint for a useless/common item most of the time. There are also many that spawn inside of undestroyable rocks or mountains, making them impossible to get. Can you please prioritize this?

4. Since bleed effect is ingame for wild giganoto, can you add it to the megaloceros?

5.behemoth walls would be nice

And finally, 6. Why do you make the holiday events such a grind? I played every available hour during the Halloween event searching for bone dinos, and I barely got enough skins for one witch hat. The Thanksgiving I did not even bother with, as the lag makes it very difficult not to harvest the turkey, leaving you without the wishbone.",2015-12-19 20:24:12+00:00,cy4rv42,1.0,t3_3xhxqm,1845.0,playark

3. People can glitch into houses. They then make off with all your stuff, or, if its been 7 days, your dinosaurs.
