Part 5 here: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/playark/comments/4o3y6a/_/

For a while, things on the server continued as normal. We would go to the arena on Sundays, I would tell survivors they were dumb in chat, we would farm some metal, the usual. One day Sensorites joined HH, he imprisoned some of survivors for a few hours. The update with the SWAT armor hit, and I expressed my frustration with it in chat. Azgoth(HH leader) asked me why, and I said because of the lvl 80 requirements for the armor and loot crates, and the high costs. 

A few days later, I booted up my computer to messages from Allers: HH was gone. They had merged with us, we were the alpha now. I thought he must be pulling my leg. I logged onto ark, rushed over to the nearest bed... and I saw it was true. All over the map were bed spawns. I eagerly went and checked it all out. For once, we were on top. We could go in the snow, we could go to carno island... we no longer had to live in fear. And we could build a server where no one else did either. A server where everyone could play as they wished, where no one feared a raid would result in harsh punishment from the alpha tribe, or that a battle quetz would come flying down and rip them to shreds. We would have 3 simple rules: No blocking caves, no building on mountains, and no attacking us or tribalistas(they didn't all quit over the events of Christmas - bubleboy and 2 others still played). 

Silv came back, and started a tribe called Dragon Riders of Pern. We invited the two members of Paradox, Bud Man and Braxdon, to take care of Gimli. Still, it was obvious taking care of all this HH stuff would be a lot of work. There was 2 huge bases, gimli and Egg Farm, a large base, InGen, and 2 medium sized ones, GDI(blue obelisk mining base) and Carno Island. We had a ton of quetzals now, while the gigas were a bit lackluster. Only one was above 50%, Santa's little helper, and the others were 20-40. 

A few days later a new tribe, AoA, built a metal box on volcano despite me telling one of them not to. I wanted to wipe them for this, and Allers agreed, but silv got him to calm down. We would be very glad we didn't. They eventually took it down. Another new tribe, Spartans, had started up on the server. They managed to tame a giga, making them the only ones other than us to have one. Rizzy gave it to us to store for him until they could build a pen to keep it. 

Bad news came soon after we took over: The Chinese were back, under the name tribe of Rarity. We would frequently have to destroy rafts that people found, and once found a base with two vaults we had to destroy. Generally, they weren't seen as much of a threat. A while after we destroyed the base, I took Santa's little helper to the snow and tried to get him to an iceberg... realizing he wasn't standing up on the ice, I jumped off, walked to solid shore, and whistled follow. He ran into some ice on the way there... and flew upwards into the air, dead. Alex was pretty mad at me, and I was in disbelief. From then on I started searching for new gigas to tame to replace it. I asked in chat one morning if anyone had seen a high level giga, and rizzy told me to come to his base. Inside it, stomping around, was a lvl 72 female giga. We got it down, tamed it, and named it Guacamole. It had like 80% melee. 

Since we were on good terms with Spartans, and silv worked with them quite a bit, and we invited them into the alliance with us and silv. 

I was walking around Cashville one morning when a player named Hacker Killer started talking in chat. He informed us that there was a group of Chinese hackers on the server and they were basing between the volcano and the snow biome. I don't remember their tribe name at the time, but it was, apparently, the same group who wiped out 365.",playark,The Tale of Official 79-Part 6,https://www.reddit.com/r/playark/comments/4qmlq3/the_tale_of_official_79part_6/

So, G-Crew, Cure, and uXa were gone from the server. Tribalistas claimed uXa mountain, and began building there. Cashville managed to tame our first quetzal, a level 8 that was named Queen Anne. One night, one of the last tribes who remained from pre-HH days, Ragnarok(never talked in chat) was wiped from their base on the western peninsula. A similar thing happened to Nocturnals, a neighbor of Cashville, and Arsenal. Both tribes just vanished, bases raided, gone without a trace. I found a turtle in Nocturnals base, and we brought it back to our pen and took care of it for a while. Mostly, the server was at peace. A new tribe began to rise, composed of noobs who would recruit anyone, known as Survivors, based on the Weathertop. Deano from HH began to host arena events, with such activities as sword and shield fights, club fights, bow fights, and pike fights. Once, they let loose their zomdodos on aggressive and we had to outrun them. 

A noob joined who called himself SmaMonkey, and his time on the server was like a series of unfortunate events. I don't remember how he lost his first stuff, but he then joined a tribe started by another new player on the server, K_INC. The leader, ilratt, then left for Killdja, and none of the other members ever played. Monkey had to either stay in a tribe with no leader and members, or leave his stuff behind. He eventually did, and joined Jambones from House of Bones. He was later kicked by Jambones, leaving him with nothing yet again. Finally, he joined Survivors. At the same time as smamonkeys arrival, two tribes started up, BORG and Chupacabras Hunters. Manatron from Chupacabras apparently wronged BORG somehow, and they really hated him. Chupacabras imprisoned a BORG member(They lived right next to each other cuz they were idiots) and I freed him. The fighting in chat died down a few days later. Cashville tried to recruit a player who had built a large stone base by themself nearby to us one day, but tragically, the merge bugged, and her dinos and personally owned buildings went to uXa, while her tribe owned buildings(And plants) went to us. All of her dinos were killed. She then quit. Another new tribe, Paradox, joined the server, led by Bud Man. A few days before christmas, a player named Brian started on the server, and I helped him out a bit with items. 

The christmas event was a sad time on 79. HH declared all the drops KOS, and flew their squad of turret quetzals out to secure every damn one of them. It seemed they weren't in the giving spirit. One day, I logged in to terrible news. HH had used the [dodorex](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/351644290029873007/8EA3996ED462F986BE01BB578CDA66EB02AAB969/) to offline raid Tribalistas. The massive metal base shown in the screenshot, their stone behemoth bases in the south... Gone. Apparently, there had been an HH rat inside Tribal, who informed them that Tribal were going to raid them the next day. That day after Tribal being wiped, there was lots of talkin in chat by Killdja... Apparently, they had decided they didn't want to play on 79 anymore. They suicided into HH, and left all their living dinos in the swamp to die. They called Cashville pussies, HH's bitches, cowards, and encouraged us to fight. It seemed that Leon had got into their head, and made them retarded. Cashville had a handful of 100+ rexes, Sydney, and [Bentley](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/644376283700012816/76D8746D072B9EA95AA5B6839FECF965C1A11BDE/). If we tried something, it wouldn't be a fight... It would be us getting slaughtered. Killdja couldn't even wipe InGen, one of the smaller HH bases. They thought we would be able to destroy their snow base, mining base, carno island, and Gimli? I said as much in chat. Eventually, the fighting ended, they left, and we recruited Brian. The christmas event ended, and the turn of events left us and HH as the only metal tier tribes. Chupacabras was probably the closest; they had managed to grow quite a bit since their BORG fighting days. 

A griefer tribe named Nerd Herd started up, and they rented Paradox spino to raid some noobs named Nepthys. Apparently, Nepthys were allies of survivors, so Survivors raided paradox. It was hardly a fair fight; Paradox had one member online, and Survivors had like 8, along with rexes, a turret bronto, and plant x paracer. Paradox managed to move their quetz over to their neighbors, Swamp Donkeys, and I ran over with my prized spino [Sydney](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/644374753319632247/BD7EE77DA2DCE1D433208ED9A4693232E4AAAD91/) to protect it. I had to log off though, and I believe that the quetzal died that night. One happy thing did happen: Freko, a player from before the biome update, returned and started a tribe.

Part 5: http://www.reddit.com/r/playark/comments/4o3y6a/_/


So, post-HH takeover. At this point I should mention that we had 3 Mr. Clean members come into our tribe. One of them, Red, was friends with Allers, which was why we had let them in. He had some plan to get revenge on HH somehow, I still don't know what it was, he farmed a lot, and then joined Goblins. The other two members stayed... Their names were Leonidus and Thor. They basically did nothing for the tribe. Nothing, that is, unless you count standing at base typing at us about attacking HH, and strategy. We really hated them about 2 weeks into their joining the tribe, but didn't want to kick them because we were afraid they would do something if we did. The halloween event happened, and in my opinion, that was the best event ark ever had. We grabbed tombstones and scarecrows from our local grave areas, and decorated our base. I'm talking pumpkins EVERYWHERE. Lined up along with scarecrows along the walkway, and outside our base, spelling HAPPY HALLOWEEN. We recruited a british guy named Ronnicus, and he moved his dinos into our base, Ms. Flops the trike, and Blue Pickle the stego. He never logged on again :( As soon as I saw you could get a witch hat, I knew I HAD to have it. I spent the entire week searching the map for alphas and skeletals. I got everything I needed, and I summoned one for Paul. You can see this hat in most of the screenshots of my dinos... testing what it looked like was really the only time i screenshotted them. I was very proud of Paul's witch hat, heres a picture. However, this was not all fun time during halloween event. A great tragedy occurred... I was swimming with Wally, our loving wolf, when we ran out of stam and he started drowning. I hopped off and whistled follow... But it was too late. Wally died, and we dragged his body to shore and made a gravestone. His body then started ascending to heaven, which was pretty funny to watch, although we weren't much in the laughing mood. Another thing that happened during the Halloween event: I saw uXa's base for the first time, and almost got killed. I then found a member of a tribe called Kings Under the Mountain, and talked to him. I learned that they were Team Mario Bros, a tribe who had been relatively new during the HH war. I had assumed they were wiped along with all the others, but it seemed that wasn't true. They had a large base in the Hidden Lake. A while after, I invited my tribe leader from 439, and he got two sabers killed. After the second, they had added tribe logs, and I could see he was killed by HH. I asked what happened, and they let me know that he attacked them at the InGen base. I looked to message him on steam, and he had unfriended me... So I kicked him.

Soon, a long time of war came over 79. A tribe had started running around and harassing a newer tribe. This new tribes name was Cure, and I learned from my leader that they weren't actually new - they had been on 79 previously, and were PvPers. They began to wage a war against HH, and joined Silv. For probably a month, they attacked and killed HH dinos, and defended 16 HH raids. During this same time, another war was ongoing. uXa had attacked a Tribalistas quetzal, and Tribalistas had retaliated and hit a uXa base, beginning an all-out war. Pretty much all we knew about this were the updates we were given in global by both tribes(Almost always ""uXa/Tribalistas ______ meat YUM""). Funnily enough, uXa tried to convince Tribal that we were helping them... But obviously this did not work, as tribal were, as I previously mentioned, our neighbors, and they were also probably the only tribe on 79 I would be willing to fight for. We had both saved each others dinos a handful of times. During this time, there was great hope in Cashville. Surely, Cure would eventually prevail against HH, and it seemed that uXa had finally picked on someone who was too big for them to handle. The giga came out during these wars: uXa managed to tame one of the first, but Tribalistas killed it after taking heavy damage at their base on the west side of the river(They had grown so large that this base on the west side had been succeeded by two even larger bases on the east side). There was good news in steam from Silv a few days later: Cure had hit a uXa cave base, and killed many, many dinos. Tribalistas then got a giga of their own: BYE BYE UXA, a giga that came out at 100+. True to it's name, uXa was defeated. The server rejoiced. I will say that Tribalistas was very lucky for Cure's presence. Without HH being occupied with Cure, they surely wouldve helped uXa in their fight. For a while, it seemed like Cure would be able to defeat HH eventually. One night they killed 70+ dinos. Another notable moment was when HH glitched into their base with a raft... Silv threw a narco grenade, knocked them all out, took their stuff, and Cure then raided HH, killing a few rexes and spinos. Then some bad news came: Kings Under the Mountain had merged into HH.

One day, allers and alex were out mining at grand peak with Beast Mode and our mining paracer, Horse Babi. All was going as usual until I saw frantic typing in tribe chat. Alex had been dropped and killed by an HH argent, and he was attacking Beast Mode! I flew over on Paul as fast as I could, but it was too late... Beast Mode was dead, and the argent rider had gone. We loaded up all the pteras and argents with metal and flew them out, and moved Horse Babi back home. Allers went back for another load... And HH arrived with a giga, quetz in tow. Zinky, Orangewing, and another argent whose name I don't remember were killed. Allers managed to escape on his bird, and somehow saved Babybird as well. Certain that an attack on our base would follow, we rushed back to base and prepared for the worst. We built up a bunch of new plant x around the main house... But another attack never came. Those were, in fact, the last cashville dinos who would be killed for months. During the fighting, a new tribe rose up on the server: G-Crew. Cashville did quite a few trades with them for fertilized eggs, and they seemed to be fairly large, growing fast. They became my new hope to take down HH. Another tribe that rose up was Killdja, led by Killdja of course. They built a base on the western peninsula nearby to us. One day, Leon and Thor left to join Killdja... It was one of the happiest days in cashville history. We no longer had to live in fear of them. Eventually, the war between HH and Cure ended. On the 17th raid, HH succeeded. They posted a video of ""The Death of Cure"", saying they had saved the server and BS like that. I will say... HH fuckin loved Anti-Cure propaganda, painting themselves as saviors and Cure as the evilest people to ever live. I will say Cure didn't help their case... Nagate went around attacking pretty much everyone he could find. 

A while after Cure fell, Bob from Steel Birds returned... But he was in HH now. About a week later, sad news: G-Crew had been attacked. Apparently, they had done something to Steel Birds on their new server, so Bob had contacted HH and asked for help in taking them out. At the time, it seemed that G-Crew were assholes: They had invited Free Folk, a guy named Sensorites and his dad, to their tribe a few days earlier, and after HH wiped G-Crew, they kicked both of them. However, I recently learned from G-Crew that sensorites had opened vaults for HH and let them in. This explained a lot, as HH had been weirdly friendly to Sensorites when he started up again, and even invited him toward the end.

So there I was, I had finally made it. I was in what I thought was a super powerful tribe. We went through the gate, and they showed me the main house area. Upstairs I found something magical: A fridge! And a grill! I was amazed at such technology. We had probably 10 dinos in the house as well, in an area to the right when you walked in. The dino pen outside was partly destroyed from the InGen raid, and filled with nothing but dodos and dilos. There was, however, a flyer pen upstairs with their birds. I helped farm wood and stone for the base, and logged off happy. The next day, I logged in on a mission: I was going to get myself a ptera, and I was going to do it all myself. I went out, my fancy new metal tools in hand, and crafted stone arrows. I hopped on [Mami Jr. Jr.](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/687153139811234586/EF90082BC8AD6D46609318D1B8B26DF02125C114/) and harvested as much narcoberries as I could, enough to make 200 narcotics. I sat there behind the dodos for probably 30 minutes, until I finally had enough eggs. I harvested our carrot plots, then went out and killed dinos with a pike until I had 30 cooked meat. I cooked up the kibble and tamed the first ptera I saw, a lvl 12. Excited to explore the island, I set off. While I was flying, I noticed I was being hit by strange green orbs, and my health was going down! Confused, I tried to turn around, but it was too late. Me and my new friend were dead. I asked my tribe what had happened, and they told me I was probably shot down by SmexyCats turrets and plants. Not discouraged, I began looking for another ptera, when Allers gave me some good news: A 116 was right above our base! I downed it, and tamed it in what I thought was surely the most boring hour of my life. But finally, he was tamed, and came out at 165. I named him [Paul](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/650002414347321213/86752F2FD991DE97365C989E19F66D4A92652E6A/), and decided that I would get him to 2k melee, because of all the hype i read on reddit about battle pteras. 

For the next week or two, my daily routine consisted of logging on, killing things with Paul for an hour or two, going home, cooking all the meat, putting it in the fridge and logging off. Things were good. Until one day, when everything changed. Silv in chat was talking about someone being raided, and as I flew near to SmexyCats, I saw it was the truth. There were a bunch of rexes on the beach outside their base, with scorpions running back and forth, a blue ptera barrel rolling into the rexes. Rexes of a tribe I had never heard of: HH. But soon enough, the whole server would know their name. They had merged with InGen, the server alpha, meaning they now had 20 or more 200+ rexes at their disposal. It was rumored they purchased InGen for $400, but these rumors were(sadly) confirmed to be false by Smokes, an InGen member, probably 2 weeks go when I talked to him on a Center server. It seemed dark times indeed had come to the server. We had some new neighbors, a tribe called Tribalistas, who was just slightly north of us, on the large rocky peninsula next to the Footpaw. Word came in chat that a member of HH, Big Country, was attacking their base, and would only leave if they talked dirty to him in Spanish. After being informed they were Brazilian, and Brazilians speak Portugese, he modified his request, and they complied, along with saying ""fuck you."" Between the time of the SmexyCats raid and the attack on HH, the biome update hit. This was not good for HH: They had quite a few bases inside the area that became the snow. This, personally, gave me hope that they could be more easily defeated. I farmed up pelt to make myself a set of fur, thinking that the snow was great. We also tamed a frog, named him [Frogger](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/650002414347318398/803BC7EC25DD993929888B69EC0015FACD5FD723/). However, word came from HH: The snow was off limits to everyone. Our tribe was very scared. War was coming, and it seemed we have to fight, or be swept away. Talks were going on between tribe leaders in steam chat. 79 would fight as one, and perhaps we would fall as one. Tribes I know for certain were involved were Steel Birds, Mr. Clean, ShadowScythe, Goon Squad, and us. I believe Goblins International fought as well, but I'm not 100% sure of this. Our task was to farm explosives. Allers and Alex crafted as many nades as they could. 

Then, finally, that weekend, the day was upon us. We would fly with Silv, and hit HH at Carno Island. The three of us took to our pteras, hoping they would survive the day: Flying Jesse Spano, the ptera of Alex, BIGBIRD, Aller's ptera, and me on Paul. We met inside the shell of a tribe called Warriors. Silv laid the plan: We would park our pteras behind a rock, throw nades, then run back to our pteras when dinos came out. We set the plan in motion. Paul and BIGBIRD took the lives of many carnos and scorpions that day. Things seemed to be going okay, but there was a player inside that base whistling dinos, and Silv wanted to leave before more could arrive. We flew back across the water, to an HH mining base, and our own reinforcements: Mr. Clean had arrived, with some pteras, an argent, and a rex. We quickly naded out the mining base, and killed and looted all that was inside. An HH ptera rider arrived, so we backed out. In those days, there was no alliance system, so fighting as a group was very confusing. It was much easier for them than it was for us: They knew everyone not green was an enemy. We fought with him for a while, and then I had to log off. Certain that Ca$hville would be gone in the case of the raids failure, I parked Paul inside the base of Brian from Yellow Bellies. The next day I logged on and asked Allers how it went. BIGBIRD had given his life for the cause, but Flying Jesse Spano was still alive, and they had managed to do pretty well against HH. But they had all had to log off, as it had gotten late, and HH had not been finished. That day, there was bad news in chat. Our largest tribe, Goons, had been offline raided. Shittalk about how bad HH was at online PvP was going on in chat, with stories of Goons valiantly defending with their 4 high level rexes, and HH needing to go back and get fresh ones 4 times. But it didn't matter how good or bad they were at PvP, the result was the same. Goons was gone, and so was our hope. Across the server, tribes fell in succession to the might of HH. 

Certain that we would be next, I stopped playing on 79 for a while, and joined a new tribe on 439. But this is the Tale of 79, so I won't talk about that. For reasons I will never know, we were spared. The server, for now, mainly consisted of us, HH, Tribalistas, Silv, Goblins, and uXa. Goblins were pretty much constantly stomping uXa, because they were giant faggots and talked shit when they didn't have anything to back it up. But, unfortunately, uXa turned out to be allied with HH. They cried to them until, finally, Goblins were wiped as well. Over time, Ca$hville got over our fear of an HH attack, since it had not happened for so long. We had tamed a few high level paracers, and when breeding came out, we bred them together, to get Rosie, Pary, and Giraffe. There was also a baby rex made, named Lionheart, who died from starvation, 2 carnos, babies of [AC Slater](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/650002414347320621/3D5F1C018EC6CABB787B74BF6A4755F17F400A2A/), a dino Allers and Alex had longer than any other, and Carnita. There was an anky too, Terra, a daughter of [Beast Mode Engaged](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/650002414347315898/A0D6E72DCF1F52EC8ED6612D1FA53104ABD22F88/), who was a parting gift from Steel Birds, who had been wiped by HH. I tamed a wolf named Wally, and a moose named [Mark](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/650002414347309125/E67DEAB766E70C77FE92530508A171FEED1CFE0F/). For now, at least, things were ok. They weren't amazing, it was a bit sad to have so many tribes gone, but they were alright.

With less than 20 hours in Ark, and fresh from server 17, where i had been endlessly killed for no apparent reason, mostly by a ptera named Deathwing, I chose 79 as my next server, as it had the lowest ping and a decent amount of players. I spawned west, and set off toward the green obelisk, determined to make my thatch hut hidden. I made it to my destination, and began walking up the hill next to it when i spotted a burning campfire. Looking around and seeing no one, I walked up to it, hoping for some nice cooked meat. Don't remember whether i found it or not... What I do remember is a raptor running up behind me, rider on top. Scared shitless of other players from my time on 17, I began pleading with him not to kill me. The rider laughed, told me to wait there, and rode off. He returned with what seemed to me great riches: 200 hide, hide armor, and metal tools. I couldn't believe he would give me these things he must have slaved so hard for. I thanked him profusely and ran off. I tried to kill a Phiomia, and while chasing it, I came upon a great compound, with 4 high stone walls and a gigantic gate! Sureley, I thought to myself, this tribe must be the server alpha. The walls read: ""Owner: Ca$hville - Friendly."" I thanked them for letting me use their walls to kill the Phiomia and they told me not to go inside, there were turrets. ""Ok"" I responded, and began running up the hill again. In the forest at the top, I came across a strange anomaly: A giant pulsing white light, filling the forest and my eyes. The raptor rider from earlier appeared: ""You can take it"" he said. ""I don't have any use for it."" Inside was great loot: Mats for a thatch 1x1! I set it up in the forest, and logged off. 


When I logged on the next day, I set off exploring, narrating my play session as I went in global. After being killed by ants more times than I'd like to admit, I decided to move my house: move it 10 feet up the hill, that is. And this time, it would be wood! I'd like to see people take me down then! At some point, I managed to make a bed, despite harvesting dinosaurs with my spear, not knowing you could use other tools. One day on my wandering, I encountered a rex, and called for help. A member of Cashville arrived, and with gifts too: A bow and tranq arrows. ""Down a dino"" they told me. ""We will bring you what you ned to tame it."" They also offered to give me stone building parts, which I happily accepted, and used to make a stone 1x1 with a storage box inside(And there that base stood, until March or April). I then went exploring with my new bow and tranq arrows. I encountered a raptor, and fled terrified into the forest, thinking it too great an adversary. However, it's speed was too great for me. Thinking myself done for, I began firing arrows in desperation whenever I saw it flash near me through the trees. Then, a miracle happened: It collapsed! It was unconscious, and I could tame it! I called for my heros, Cashville, in chat, and they were there, with narcotics and prime meat. I sat there, crouching on top of my raptor, scared shitless something bad would happen. And for a few seconds, it seemed it would: A carno appeared in the clearing next to me. I called for cashville and hid behind a tree, mentally preparing myself for the death of myself and the untamed raptor. But just as the carno turned toward me, Alex arrived with his ptera, killing it. Then, the raptor tamed! Overjoyed, I named it Randy. My first dino. I could finally have the adventures that had been fortold to me in the steam reviews. Me and Randy set off through the forest to home. Once there, I came to a terrible realization: I had no way to protect him! I voiced these concerns, and was told I could put my raptor in a+gamer's pen, tribe name Aller's Slaves(Allers is the leader of Cashville). I managed to get him in right before a server message telling of an update in 15 minutes. 


The next day I logged on, and asked a+gamer if I could get Randy out of his pen. To this, he gave me horrible news: Randy wasn't there! Saddened, I began my exploring without him, but logged off a few minutes later. The next day, there was great news! Alex had found Randy on the beaches and brought him back to the pen. I took him out and headed up the coast. We came under attack by flies, but I wasn't worried. Until tragedy struck! Randy passed unconscoius. I was quickly overwhelmed by bugs. I ran back, grabbed my stuff, and started spamming stims on recommendation of a guy in global. I didn't get far before I was again killed. I made my final run, found him, and again spammed stims. As I was killed, hope! I saw his body rising up. I began sprinting again, but I was met with the heartbreaking message at the top of the screen: Your Randy was killed! I lamented his death in global, unaware that RIP Randy would later be used as an inside joke among players of the server(This still hurts me :(). My next days were mostly just me taming dilos and subsequently losing them or getting them killed. One day Brian, another neighbor of Cashville and A+Gamer, helped me to tame a trike. However, a+gamer was raided that night by au to man, and said trike was killed along with a dilo. A day or two later, something else happened: Cashville was raided by InGen. The building of the nice raptor rider, who i had learned was a member of theirs, was destroyed. 


Saddened, I continued as usual. Tamed a dilo, named him damond, put him in a+gamers house at the end of the day. lost him the next day, was sad, typical noob stuff. 2 or 3 days later, I finally found damond! As I ran up to my base, cashville called me to their gate. They appeared to be back at their base, and wanted to talk to me. They gave me an offer: I could join them, but I had to stop talking in global 24/7. I asked for some time to think about it. I thought for like 10 mins, and then I accepted. The thing that convinced me was having a safe home for damond. From now on, I would be known as Digital Taco[Ca$hville - Friendly]

I guess I will begin as far back as I know. The part before I entered the server is pieced together from stories I have been told, and may be inaccurate. If a 79 veteran could correct any mistakes that would be appreciated.

In the early days after the wipe, a tribe named ZQTV came to power. They were Chinese, and enjoyed sniping noobs on the beach, and killing people they found. However, all was not perfect for these tyrants. A group of english players fought, and fought hard. WhiteOrc, Greed, Silvtalon, and 6 others managed to wipe them out and save the server. Their tribe then ascended to alpha status. According to my tribe leader, our tribe had problems with one or two of their members, but mostly they were fair. However, it would not last. There was some internal conflict with Greed, and he was ?kicked and used a cheat to get admin?(conflicting stories on how this happened, I'm not sure what actually went down). However it happened, Greed demolished literally everything they had, huge metal structures, and killed their dinos. 

This left InGen, as the next largest tribe, in charge of the server. Silvtalon created a new tribe, ShadowScythe, and built a base in the metal lake south of Far's Peak. After this, a Brazilian tribe called MYARK joined the server. They were highly aggressive, and went around killing tames such as poor [Birdy Jr.](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/695031906007468759/7A1EF237798B69B0E8D5D5A0364A036BFA4C12D5/). Eventually, they were wiped by InGen. ZQTV decided to make a comeback on 79, under a new name: au to man. They were being helped by another tribe, Tribe 7 something. At this point, major tribes on the server were InGen, Goons Squad, SmexyCats, and Goblins International. Other notable tribes were Steel Birds, ShadowScythe, Ginyu Force, Mr. Clean, Ragnarok, and Ca$hville-Friendly. This is around September I believe, and as much as I know up to when I joined the server. I'll continue this later from when I started and update the post then.

So with that, we get to today. Finally a tribe mate has spotted a low level quetz, level 5 in fact. Jackpot. We set out to tranq it down, me hanging from an argent, a ptera rider in tow to provide support should something go south. Well, we finally get it down on an island across the coast from volcano. We make the few Rex kibble we have, put it in the quetz along with some cooked prime, and start to make a preserving bin. We had one guy there, quetz was full of torp, he turns his back for 15 seconds to harvest a rock... and the quetz is gone.

He posted on the forums, steam and survivetheark.com asking where the skin was. He even added Jat, and Jat said it was only in sotf for now and he would get back to him. 

It's been WEEKS since he got 200 wins and posted on the forums. 

So devs, can you please follow through with your promise of the giga skin for those who got 200 wins? This is ridiculous. I, and many others, downloaded your game for the sole purpose of getting this skin. While I probably won't achieve this, and find the game enjoyable, I feel... Betrayed? You promised this skin in survival evolved for 200 win players, and it's not there. In my opinion, this is pretty bad in terms of false advertising.

TL;Dr: devs said players with 200 wins in sotf would get the robo giga skin in survival evolved. Devs then have not added this skin despite it being fully completed.

3. The abandon penalty is way too short.

Id say probably 50% of the time I have someone either abandon in the middle, or before the game even starts. This shows that players don't care about the current penalty.

You would be able to function pretty much as your own tribe if that is what you wished.

Also could really use a person who loves breeding, trying to get the best dinos. I am on quite a bit and can help with meat. Our previous breeder left some pretty good stuff to work with, multiple 240 rexes, 3 230 pteras, 235/243 ankys and of course we have multiple 200+ quetzals :). I hatched 2 rexes and a ptera during valentines, rexes were 196 and 194, and ptera 185.

We are a friendly alpha tribe who tries not to make enemies or get involved in lower level tribe conflicts. And most importantly, *do not kill anyone unless they attack you* Do not apply if you can't abide by this.

Hello. Today we tried to merge with a 1-man tribe that had been living in our area. Some of their building(and I'm assuming dinos) were set to personal, while the others were set to tribe. The tribe owned included all turrets. Well... the personal stuff and dinos and tribe member/owner were given to a no longer active tribe called uXa, and the rest to our tribe. The plant X turrets on the base then turned on these now uXa dinos, killing them. The owner of the tribe we were trying to merge with then immediately left uXa, and the structures remained uXa owned. We would appreciate if you could either return the parts of the base and respawn dinos to the tribe member(Karina), or merge the rest of the base into cashville and respawn the dinos. 


Here are some screenshots I took of the carnage:

HOWEVER, all is not lost.
The egg boost does reduce mating time. So simply set your females and male to wander, spam u, collect the eggs, and cook them into kibble. Using this method you can double production with ovi.

As well, there is one way to make it collect eggs, by having it follow you. Maybe this can be used for those pesky raptor eggs, or have one following all of your dinos, not sure if it works for them.

The first one would be tags for tribes that you are friends with to see their names from a distance like you can with your own tribe. This would be most helpful for group raids, maybe you would need the other person to agree with it however and they could remove it from themselves at any time.

Next would be a whistle for a dimo to

How do heros work? Is it like before where you get them for a certain amount of kills/points?

Are they planning on adding the original gameplay? For example, the hoth battle looks like you can't even wrap the AT AT legs, and I haven't seen any mention of space battles or the Mos Eisley Hero fight, CTF, control points, etc.

Will there be Hunt gamemode? Smashing bitches as a poopy butt wampa was one of the best parts of the game

How do classes work? Is it as the original or is it like COD level up unlocks?
