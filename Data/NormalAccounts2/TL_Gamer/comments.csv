0,"You misunderstand what the following Statement means 
""A new Blacksmith now appears in Tyrant's Hold on Elite and Ultimate difficulty that can turn rare crafting materials into random items of Legendary quality.""
That means before this patch the blacksmith was never on elite and Ultimate difficulty. And that they changed how he works on Normal/Veteran difficulty. So instead of a legendary item you now only get an epic. ",2016-03-16 23:32:30+00:00,d12mlby,4,t1_d12m01y,942,Grimdawn
1,"Well this section says the blacksmith is also on normal and Veteran.

""If your character is too low level to roll a Legendary, it will be an Epic item instead, but this should not be much of an issue for players not power-levelling through Normal/Veteran.""

THIS PART OF IT CLEARLY STATES IT IS ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE ON NORMAL/VETERAN DIFFICULTY

""but this should not be much of an issue for players not power-levelling through Normal/Veteran.""

Mentions You only get Epics on NORMAL/VETERAN

CRYSTAL
FUCKING
CLEAR.

This is why all of you retards are never going to be right with this, and why stupid lazy development causes a problem and that INSTRUCTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN THE GAME ITSELF.

3,"I love how people make shit up then try to justify their bullshit.

First of all there is no listed location for ANY nemesis, so to say that outcast is not a nemesis makes the person that said it stupid.

Secondly I'm getting really sick and tired of the bullshit from retards on forums constantly complaining about what I'm saying.

If the devs are going to be this fucking stupid where they cannot even explain anything, then people like me are always going to call them out and show their stupidity.

and this hole blaming a player for not knowing what the devs failed to explain makes anyone who doesn't get that the dumbest people on the face of this planet.

This game is so full of fail it's mind numbing, and what makes it worse is all the retards and idiots who think this game is fine.

If it's fine then why is it everything I have shown in every video INCLUDING there not being a Legendary Blacksmith in tyrant's hold like the patch notes says there is, counters any possible argument anyone can say.

When you people start providing actual evidence of anything your'e saying then talk otherwise you're all just a bunch of retards playing a he said she said game.

As it stands now the patch notes about the blacksmith in tyrant's hold is a lie... COPIED AND PASTED

There is no relevance to anyone saying you don't need to buy it because the topic creator very specifically asked WHERE CAN IT BE BOUGHT....

nothing about do I need to buy it...

You people not only cannot read, but you shovel all this  bullshit in, make the fucking topics a mess, then cry ban people like me for holding you all accountable for turning a topic into a mess by your justification of irrelevant bullshit.

You then cry Ban me for pointing out how stupid you are and using other idiotic and irrelevant comments that have nothing to do with everyone's stupidity.

When someone asks a very specific question then the only thing needed for an answer is exactly what is being asked.

If I had the authority I would delete every comment in here that goes against what the topic creator asked, and then suspend every person in here for even attempting to argue and justify their stupidity about leaving any other information that is not related to what the topic creator asked.

7,"First of all It's on veteran not normal, and secondly you damn well know that the difficulty isn't relevant. For the record I also went there on elite difficulty as well and it still wasn't there so Ultimate difficulty will be no different. If trove chests spawned over and over, it would be there regardless.

As for being uninformed...don't put that shit on me...The developers need to do their fucking job so people like me ARE informed by letting me know there are patch notes and what they are.

Why are people so stupid to the point they think the developers are not at fault for anything...It's not my responsibility to guess what the devs might have done, it is however their responsibility to MAKE SURE I know things like this..And you know they didn't.

All of you need to quit making all these excuses for the stupidity of the developers....",2016-03-16 16:43:37+00:00,d124ozu,1,t3_4aojhv,1383,Grimdawn

14,"I only came into this troll topic to maybe put an end to this nonsense with this 4 points.......

1. A Trove chest is purposely set up to give out good items when it's opened. Acting surprised you get good items from a chest set up to do so is stupid.

2. Trove chests are a one time event, once you open it, it's gone forever. So why are people in this topic acting like this chest is there over and over?

3. Dynamite is free. I got 4 in about 2 min without using any material or spending any money.

4. You cannot craft Legendary items at a blacksmith without a blueprint. So why are people acting like they're randomly getting legendary items by crafting random crap at a blacksmith?

21,"I have to correct you on what you said about Diablo 2. Once you unlocked a difficulty in Diablo 2 it was unlocked on the account You had to reach a certain level before being able to gain access to certain areas of each act but you were still able to create a level 1 on any difficulty. So any character could start at level 1 on higher difficulty.

And that makes the devs for Grim Dawn fucking retards. I should have known because of how shitty the rest of the game is programmed as far as instructions and proper knowledge for the player.

And you just proved that everyone else who said they were able to create a level 1 on elite is a liar.

There needs to be a LAW that prevents any developer from releasing any game that is not explained, and explained properly..This whole ""Games are schoolwork"" mentality has fucked up games something fierce. ",2016-03-16 05:04:43+00:00,d11mzm8,2,t1_d11mj33,954,Grimdawn

25,"You can consider this cheating if you want but if you've already earned everything with one character, then transfer it to another character.

The fastest way to generate iron is to do this:

1. Get anything you want to keep on your character between your inventory and the item stash (Not the item Transfer side) then While the game is running, ALT + TAB the game and make a back up copy of your older character from the game save directory, to your desktop.

2. Once the back up is made, go back into the game and put everything from that character into the Item Transfer side of the stash and close the game completely and now just copy and paste the backup character from your desktop, back into the save directory and overwrite the file.

3. Launch the game with your new level 1, and when you can get to the stash, all that stuff will still be there...Take it all and sell it.

You can repeat this as many times as you like for infinite gold. You can also get free items from the store by making a back up in the manor I just described above, before you buy the item. You then buy the item, put it into the Item Trade side of the stash, Close the game completely, replace the save in the directory with the backup, launch the game.. You will still have the same amount of iron as before you bought the item from the store, and the item you bought from the store is still in the item trade section of the staff.
