So I'm not going to get into stupid debates with forum retards about this.

The patch notes themselves very clearly state that even in veteran difficulty the blacksmith is still supposed to be there  This was copied and pasted directly from the patch notes. NOWHERE do the patch notes state or mean the blacksmith only shows up on Elite and Ultimate difficulty. Here is the quote from the patch note that explains that you should still find the blacksmith on normal/veteran difficulty. If it doesn't mean that, then the whomever wrote that is grammatically impaired and needs to be fired...

    If your character is too low level to roll a Legendary, it will be an Epic item instead, but this should not be much of an issue for players not power-levelling through Normal/Veteran.    

NOTE IT SAYS ""It will be an EPIC item instead of legendary when on Normal/Veteran Difficulty.

Now here's the video that shows there is no Blacksmith in Tyrant's Hold AT ALL

If a video is posted showing something, then just stop defending piss poor development and especially stop arguing against video evidence.

Developers should not be adding things to a game when they cannot explain how to get access to whatever they added. Case in point, The legendary Blacksmith that's supposed to be in ""Tyrants Hold""

Not only are there no instructions on how to gain access to him/her/it but I HAVE A VIDEO showing there is no Blacksmith in Tyrant's Hold at all. (The video link will be posted as soon as it's done).

The video counters anyone that wants to use the usual idiotic bullshit people will try and say around a topic such as this one so people can post stupid replies all they want, but the video I am going to post the link for, will kill any stupidity anyone tries to say in their replies!",Grimdawn,The lazy development in this game is absolutely outstanding.

Well that's either not true or I have never seen a one shot chest yet? 
Either way from how many hour's I've sunk into this I believe I've seen what every chest in the game looks like. 

The ones I thought were a One Shot chest did not produce an epic the very first time I opened it. So as I said it's either not true, or I have never seen a one shot chest in the over 200+ hours I played.",Grimdawn,What the hell does a one shot chest look like?

2. ELITE DIFFICULTY IS STILL LOCKED
After finishing the game on veteran (Used a Nightblade) I got a message that said I can now play on ELITE difficulty. So I created a new Level 1 character (To use as a mage)...and Guess what, Elite is still locked. So that message about elite is either a lie, it's broken, or the devs are idiots and don't understand ARPG concepts. Whatever the case may be, with the exception of Grim Dawn, there isn't one ARPG that doesn't allow you to start over with a new level 1 character other game of this nature allows you to create does. when you unlock a harder difficulty.


And I'm not going to get into debates with people about wording or what is intended by the devs or another player's opinion. If it says Elite is unlocked, then it's supposed to be unlocked period...Since it's not as I said above it's either not true, it's a broken mechanic, or the devs are just morons who cannot explain what they mean by Elite is Unlocked.",Grimdawn,Two things in Grim Dawn that either don't happen or aren't true!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimdawn/comments/4am8ur/two_things_in_grim_dawn_that_either_dont_happen/
