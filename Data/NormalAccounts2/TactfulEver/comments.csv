90,"I've dated someone while they were addicted to heroin. She recently died from it actually.

One rule I learned because of her: NEVER date/marry someone addicted to opiates. Even if they are naturally a good person (which she was), heroin has a way of souring that. It rots away any moral character they once had. I cared for my ex a lot, but during her cravings, she would have stolen $10,000 from me without a second thought. *Anything* to get the fix.

I broke it off and wished her the best. We remained friends, but stopped talking for a little while. Then I see on Facebook that she passed away. I don't know how I would've handled that if we had continued dating, and my g/f of 5 years passed away.

Just me. A one man band. It's a somewhat strange project. I create the music, and just videotape myself recording the drums - then put it up on Youtube.

It's Metal. Electronic. Dubstep. The occasional acoustic guitar, piano, or violin. I'll throw anything in that sounds good.

Started a few months ago and it's been fantastic so far. Lot's of support and Youtube growth..... If that means anything.

Here's a video I just put up about 10 minutes ago:

My only advice would be at 0:21 there is this frequency that begins playing and it drowns out a lot of the vocal range. It also lasts the whole song. I'd take that out (or just EQ it out a bit) and let it the song breathe more.

One little tip on the piano, have the individual notes of the chord play very quickly in succession rather than playing at the exact same moment. It will open up the sound a bit and make it sound much more realistic.

Yes. The cymbals are the most difficult thing to make sound right. What I ended up doing was just cut out *all* the low end, so they just serve as sort of the ""shiny top"" to the music. I've come to like them, but that's just what I tell myself to be happy.

456,"I should mention that I'm not an anarchist. I am what anarchists sometimes mockingly refer to as a ""minarchist"", which I accept.

That being said, I agree with you. I remember watching David Friedman (the son of Milton Freidman) who is an anarcho-capitalist, and I remember him talking about how under anarcho-capitalism, you might have one town that could imprison someone for marijuana use, and the next town freely uses marijuana, and he said this like it was a good thing. I always felt that I'd rather have a government that simply recognizes you can do whatever you want with your own body, on your own time, on your own property.

My ""pie in the sky"" scenario would be to have a government that has very limited, yet *focused* involvement in society. Namely, it would uphold private property rights, contracts, and work to address anyone initiating force against anyone else. Outside of those things, it should leave people to live, trade, and associate however they would choose. A government that simply does those things would take care of many of the valid criticisms you stated.",2015-10-22 22:09:17+00:00,cw9dhof,15.0,t1_cw97um5,8447.0,SandersForPresident
457,"Those are legitimate questions, and in the context of my example above, I'll explain how it could work.

If you decide you want to live in a certain area, you will have to sign a contract with those who privately own the land. You will have to agree to pay your fair share in order to live there... If you come across an association that is charging a ludicrious amount - you have every right to shop around for an association that is more reasonable for you.

Also, in another post - you mentioned that if someone doesn't like the way things are run in the U.S., they should move to another country, or some unclaimed land... Well - the example I have given with the housing associations gives everyone that option on an even *more* realistic level. Instead of having to move thousands of miles across an ocean, you can search for different housing associations withing 50-100 miles of where you are, with different prices, and different ways of doing things. Granted, industry standards would emerge naturally, as they usually do - but once one association finds a better or cheaper way of doing things, other associations that emulate that behavior will be more attractive to people, and generate more revenue either by more people wanting to live there, and people willing to pay more for better service.

This gets at a bigger issue - anarchists and libertarians are not inherently against regulation and the pooling of communal resources - it all comes down to *who* is doing the regulating and oversight? Anarchists and Libertarians generally want to see this done from the bottom up, rather from the top down.

Okay, I'm hoping that's clear - I wrote it off the top of my head.",2015-10-22 18:48:59+00:00,cw95cmc,13.0,t1_cw93fut,2734.0,SandersForPresident
458,"I apologize for assuming you were pro big government. Your post seems to speak very favorably on the government, so I took a small leap of faith.

If you're interested, there's a good deal of literature out there that outlines these possibilities, but I'll bite and give you a brief example pertaining to roads.

As it stands now, government is a middleman to private companies that build and maintain roads. They take your money via taxes, and contract with these companies. There's no reason that associations can't voluntarily form to contract with these companies. Less money is spent on the salaries of bureaucrats this way, therefore costs will be reduced. You would also be given a bit more control over who you might contract with, which would generate more competition, further reducing prices, and/or increasing quality.

These associations can work with other organization, and pretty soon you have a huge network of associations, with more control on the local level.

This boils down to the classic argument that the free market is the ""law of the jungle"", which is untrue.

I'll just steal from Rothbard for this one: 

&gt; ""A common charge against the free-market society is that it institutes “the law of the jungle,” of “dog eat dog,” that it spurns human cooperation for competition and exalts material success as opposed to spiritual values, philosophy, or leisure activities. On the contrary, the jungle is precisely a society of coercion, theft, and parasitism, a society that demolishes lives and living standards. The peaceful market competition of producers and suppliers is a profoundly cooperative process in which everyone benefits and where everyone’s living standard flourishes (compared with what it would be in an unfree society).""",2015-10-20 20:31:37+00:00,cw6szsi,1.0,t3_3ph77p,33614.0,Anarcho_Capitalism
