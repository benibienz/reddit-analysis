Turns out, golfsmith is just what I was looking for. 12 months no interest with approved credit. 

So that 300 a month... I'll spend about half of it on clubs for about 7 months. AND I get to play with new clubs this month. All I ever wanted.

184,"That's were the magic of reddit comes into play

* No scams (The deals on /r/golf are typically the same 5-15 reputable dealers, and users/mods/providers can all comment if there is a problem)

* There shouldn't be any flooding. If done properly, there will only be one post a day of the deals being offered by dealers.

* No local area deals. This is the internet after all. Every deal I've seen over at /r/golf  was based off online purchases

187,"2 more things : cash, once you're off the dock, credit cards cease to be useful. Bring enough money to tip your deck hands, buy snacks and beer, and put in on the jackpot.

188,"Channel islands has a great checklist, but yes: 

sunscreen 30 spf or above( be sure to apply to the underside of your face as you'll be looking at the water most of the day)  sunburns on your nostrils sucks!!! 

 Snug fitting hat (wind has taken 2 of mine before I hot wise and started bring boonie hats with neck straps) 

Couple layers of clothing. I wear track pants on top of basketball shorts so I can ditch the pants when it starts to heat up.  Flannel or a light hoodie/windbreaker. 

Snacks. Nothing you have to touch with your hands as they'll be touching bait and catches all day long (hopegully).  Think: protein bars, candy bars, sandwiches in plastic bags... I love sunflower seeds while fishing though, so I usually pour some into a cup so I don't have to touch them. 

And what they don't condone...  I always take a flask of rum.  And depending on how many people are coming with me, anywhere from 12 to 30 beers.  Just be sure to bring the same kind the boats provide and buy a few rounds from the galley to avoid suspicion. I've never been caught but I can't imagine they'd be too happy if they found out. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I'm going out on Monday and just went through my own checklist.

189,Newport has a decent company called Davey's locker. I go out of channel islands sport fishing most of the time though since it's closer.  Both offer all the rental gear you need and are staffed with knowledgeable deck hands/captains that will do everything in their power to help everyone catch and have fun. ,2015-07-24 20:55:20+00:00,ctf0ris,1.0,t3_3ehbcd,4862.0,Fishing

191,"What knot do you use for your weight? I use a surgeon loop... I think (2 wrap uni with doubled over line) so I can change weights depending on drop depth and under current. 

Also, how much length do you use on your loops? I used to do over a foot but most references I've checked recently suggest 6 inches is plenty. ",2015-07-24 20:10:32+00:00,cteyz1d,4.0,t1_ctevocf,4958.0,Fishing

Spinning reel for top water has 20# power pro to 20# seaguar red (piece of junk Ngage combo, gonna see if it can hang)  Still debating on whether or not to do a sliding weight, or an alternate top water rig.
