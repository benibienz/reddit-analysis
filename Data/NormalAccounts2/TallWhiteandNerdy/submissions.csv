Sometimes it would resolve after 20-30 seconds, but most of the time I'd get kicked from the game and a notice saying I was disconnected from the server. 

I have tried all the fixes I've seen on here including: DX12/11, using previous driver versions, locking my frames, borderless, using Nvidia inspector to set vsync, clean Uninstall and reinstall of all gpu drivers and the game, and playing on the lowest settings. And any combination of the above you can think of. 

Sometimes I'll go for hours and not have any problems, other times I get dropped 10 minutes into games, back-to-back. 
I have even frozen up on the single player campaign (never kicked from that though). 

I can run every other game I play on max settings without so much as a hiccup, and thus us really starting to get annoying. 

Please help.

I have to manually power the monitor off and back on to make the one plugged into my DVI display properly.

My friend said he had the same issue and said unplugging the power cord, shutting down, then plugging back in and powering on was the solution, but it made no difference when I tried twice.

It doesn't happen every time, but more often than not.

I would also like to disable the mouse snagging that happens in the top corners when i try and drag something from a side monitor to my main. (main is slightly elevated so I hit these damn stop points all the time). only a minor nuisance and easy to avoid, but I'd like to disable it regardless.

So I went to recover the nuke site in the glowing see for the Brotherhood and had previously started the conference quest for the Institute. The problem being that the Institute quest gives me an option to tell the Brotherhood their plans... And trying to turn in the bh quest for the nukes also turns in to the same person. (proctor Ingram). 

There's no option for dialogue, when I go up to her and press e, my char automatically starts informing her about the Institute quest, and I can't access any other dialogue options until I go through with interrupting the Institute's quest. (which I'm assume makes me a permanent enemy of the Institute) 

Alternatively, trying to finish the conference quest first says I will make the bh permanent enemies. 

I want to get daisy's affinity perk but read that the nukes mission is necessary. 

So the question: if I want danse's perk, but want to side with the Institute, do I have to load a 5 hour old file to go back and not start the conference mission? Is there a work around for this? 

Or I guess a console command that sets danse's affinity to max so I can get his perk before telling the Brotherhood where to stick it.
