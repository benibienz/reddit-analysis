2,"Quick thoughts while watching:

- Cute opening

- Your audio quality is great but the overall levels aren't (op is loud, your audio is medium, and the other people are low), which makes it a little difficult to watch the video at a comfortable volume without constantly adjusting

- Commentary is nice

- Great sense of humor

- The edits need a bit of work (gets a bit better as the episode continues)

- Lol, 5:19 killed me 

- End slate is nice, simple, and has annotations but you might as well use the YouTube's end card system 

- Thumbnail is fine, has everything i look for


Overall the episode was a little rough but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The biggest issue I noticed was the mismatch audio levels, best way to fix this is by using Virtual Audio Cables. That program is free and lets you separate the different audios so you could adjust them individually. Another possible way to improve the video is with the edits, they seemed relatively simple and were mainly packed at the latter half of the video which made the episode feel a little unbalanced in hindsight. Other than that, those five minutes just flew by which saddened me because you don't have any other videos.

10,"Quick thoughts while watching then I'll go into specifics after:

- You clip the mic quite a bit, you need to lower the gain and equalize (Rip headphones)
- Intro okay
- The transitions are okay but I didn't really like the squeaky voice segment, felt extremely long  
- Style is fine but it feels like you over do it sometimes 
- Made good use of face cam 
- End screen is pretty good but you should probably use YouTube's end cards because yours layout is perfect for it and you could automatically use it for all your videos.
- Thumbnail is okay but I recommend trying to put something that ties them specifically to your channel (maybe a Yoda some where in it). There is already a bunch of much bigger YouTubers that do the rainbow thing 
- Video length was about right

Overall the episode was short and sweet, which is good and you are using a style that many find appealing. My only qualm is that sometimes it felt like you were over doing it, which started to leave a bad ""taste in my mouth"". 

The transitions and edits were simple but felt rather fluid for the most part. The only problem I really had with them was the high pitch sped up portion, felt really long and unnecessary which caused me to lose interest a bit.

17,"I'll start off by giving you my quick thoughts while watching then go into more detail at the end:

- Might be a good idea to adjust your episode naming scheme to attract viewers (avoid click-bait though)
- Opening was cute 
- Weird humming sound in the audio (after I noticed it might be the ship)
- Music is a bit too loud
- During the nighttime, the enemies were very hard to see (might be a bit hard to fix)
- A few moments of ""dead air""
- Commentary felt a little lacking
- I liked the sped up portion 
- There were times where I started to lose interest 
- End card is nice but clickable annotations and/or the use of YouTube's End cards might be a good idea 
- Video length is a little on the long side but these types of LPs tend to be a bit longer than normal 
- Thumbnail is simple but okay, it needs something that ties it to your channel

Overall the episode was okay, super chill, which is not necessarily a bad thing but not “my cup of tea”. The biggest area I see for improvement is the commentary. From time to time I would find myself losing interest and starting to get a little bored. All voxel games have the same inherent strengths and weaknesses but unfortunately its weakness, how monotonous it could be, can only really be off-set by commentary. You have to decide “why would someone watch me and why would they stay to watch more?”, then model your commentary around this. Though you seem like a really nice chill guy, other than watching the LP to critique, I couldn’t really find a reason why I would continue watching.  It might also be a good idea to infuse a little bit of humor here and there to complement your relaxed “feel”.  But ultimately you have to decide if you liked watching the episode yourself, and if you did what did you like/dislike. The most important person to listen to is yourself, you are your biggest critic and if you enjoy it everything else doesn’t matter.

20,"Instant Fusion can special summon any lvl 5 or lower fusion monster (best thing is it counts as a fusion summon) and Thousand-eyes is a lvl 1 fusion monster. So in a pinch your Instant Fusions becomes spot removal even during Necrovalley; you special Thousand-eyes target an opp's monster then it equips to Thousand-eyes (if you have a tuner you could synchro to be able to attack), then during the end phase(if they are still there) both die. 

The harder you decide to go into using the extra deck the less likely you are to able to use Lose 1(unfortunately). For the most part the only decks who can reliably use this 99.9% of the time is yosenju and some Card of Demise decks. It is for this reason that it might be best to remove it completely and try to find side deck cards that directly affect your meta. 

What makes Abyss a lingering effect is its ability to affect your opp without it having to stay on the field the turn you use its effect, unlike Shaman that needs to be face up and/or on the field the whole time. 

I'm not saying Mirror Force cards are particularly bad they are just a little weaker because of how the game has evolved, at the end of the day Mirror Force IS a non targeting way to answer to your opp's cards. But if you do want to switch it out I recommend using non targeting cards like Book of Eclipse(quick play so it can be used at any moment) or Floodgate Trap Hole(another target for Rafflesia and a great card versus any pendulum deck).

Lol #MakeGravekeeperGreatAgain Another variant of Gravekeeper you might like if you want to be competitive is Card of Demise Gravekeeper's. It plays lots of settable floodgates and was doing pretty well in competitive a while back but it isn't easy on the wallet. 

Np, always glad to be of assistance :  ]",2016-11-02 16:56:25+00:00,d9ikqzh,3.0,t1_d9hy5j8,45492,yugioh
21,"It's always good to see someone playing Gravekeeper's and I like the idea of using Moon Mirror shield but 3 is going to clog. So I recommend using 2 mirror and adding 3 Allure of Darkness, the allures will help you go through your deck to find what you need and any extra copies could be used for summoner monk. Unfortunatley bringing the count down forces you to remove Power Tool Dragon but you could fill the space with {{Ancient Fairy Dragon}}. Fairy Dragon can help you retrieve Necrovalley from the deck, help you gain LP, and can even be used to cheat out a lvl 4 or lower monster (potentially a summoner monk who could become a R4nk).


I also recommend removing dark bribe and magic drain (or at least dark bribe), one of the main problems with these types of cards is the loss of advantage (one lets your opp go +1 the other makes you go -1) and Gravekeeper's, as a whole, have a hard time generating advantage as it is. But negation is important and why not use the best trap Gravekeeper's has access to, {{Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley}}. Imperial fills the role of negation while not causing a net loss in advantage.   


Something I like about your version of Gravekeeper's is the addition of Ogre for negation and synchro summoning. You could go one step further and add {{Effect Veiler}}, another great tuner hand trap which also allows you to go into {{Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier}}. The addition of instant fusion might be okay here (even though Necrovalley could hinder it) because, with norden, it could revive Ogre/Veiler/ Lvl 4 monster to either recover or continue your play string. If you do decide to add instant fusion I recommend adding {{Thousand-Eyes Restrict}}, it will give the deck an out to certain problem creatures and gives instant fusion usability under Necrovalley.


Due to the added synchro potential and the special summoning of R4nk/ Gravekeeper's, I recommend removing Lose 1 Turn from the main deck. Though Lose 1 Turn is a great floodgate, it might be dead more times than not. 


Though I understand the use of Gravekeeper's Shaman, it's an outdated card that can be easily dealt with (popping it or running over it). Instead I recommend using {{Abyss Dweller}}. Though Abyss doesn't protect Necrovalley it is a lot easier to make, doesn't take up main deck room, and has a lingering effect so even if its removed it still stops your opponent. 


To make room in the extra deck I recommend removing Gem-knight Pearl (Lightning does his job but better), Stardust Charge Warrior(low power and his multi hit effect is rarely useful), 1 Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer(a little over kill to have more than one), and Black Rose Moonlight Dragon (though I like the card, it targets which is a no no). 


Other possible additions to the main deck are 1-2 Gravekeeper's Descendant( helps you remove a possible face down spell/trap or a battle protected monster), 1-2 Gravekeeper's Stele (great with Descendant and Commandant), Floodgate Trap Hole (another target for Rafflesia and a great answer for untargetable threats), and Book of Eclipse(great quick play spell that doesn't target, can stop your opponent's plays, and can help you get over threats even without Mirror Shield). 


In summary/ TLDR:

-0-1 Gravekeeper's Shaman

-1 MM Shield

-3 Dark Bribe

-2 Magic Drain

-2 Lose 1 Turn

-1 Power Tool Dragon

-1 Gem-knight Pearl

-1 Stardust Charge Warrior

-1 Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer

-1 Black Rose Moonlight Dragon

----------------------

+1-2 Effect Veiler

+0-1 Gravekeeper's Descendant

+1-2 Gravekeeper's Stele

+1-3 Instant Fusion

+3 Allure of Darkness

+0-1 Book of Eclipse

+2-3 Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley

+1 Floodgate Trap Hole

+1 Abyss Dweller

+1 Ancient Fairy Dragon

+1 Thousand-Eyes Restrict

+1 Elder Entity Norden

+1 Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier

P.S Necrovalley doesn't stop Galaxy Cyclone because it activates in the graveyard but the down side is Galaxy only works on set cards, so it can't deal with as many threats as MST or Twin.

P.S.S Though Storming Mirror Force is nice, keep in mind that being a battle trap is a very big weakness in a meta were everyone uses MST/Twin and cards that destroy spell/traps.

P.S.S.S Sorry for the long post, Gravekeeper's have always had a special place in my heart :  ]

- Lots of echo in the audio
- The volume of the edits were a way too loud, especially compared to your audio
- I like the sporadic edits 
- A rather large moment of ""dead air""
- Didn't seem like you used the face cam to its full potential(used a bit better after boss fight)
- It seems like your relying on the edits a great deal for the humor  
- Commentary is mostly reactionary 
- The pace of the vid was good
- End card was okay
- Liked that you added a little something for those who stayed till the end 
- The thumbnail is okay

Overall the episode was okay but has some glaring problems. Though I did like a lot of the edits, it felt as if you used them as a crutch instead of a garnish. Edits should complement what you are doing but you used them as the sole source of humor (for the most part). The other main issue I had was the use of the facecam. In my eyes, if someone plans to use a facecam they should use it as a way to interact with the viewer, either with facial reactions or by directly looking at the cam and talking to the viewer. For the most part the use of the facecam was a passive experience that didn't seem to add that much to the LP.

Without some voice audio to guide the video, it just feels like a really fast passed mess. The lack of audio also forces you to rely even more on edits, which contributes to the problem of being overwhelming.

- 1 {{Moon Mirror Shield}} - Helps you beat over any monster and re usable

- 3 {{Zombie World}} - Major combo piece that turn anything into a zombie, including norden which can then be reused with book of life or mezuki

- 1 {{Foolish Burial}} - Yards any piece you might need

- 2 {{Book of Life}} - Architype specific monster reborn (cost is a little counter intuative early game, might drop to one)

- 2 {{Terraforming}} - Deck thins and searches out Zombie World

- 1 {{Call of the Mummy}} - Great for recovery and a nice way to cheat out some cards like Red-Eyes

- 1 {{Burial from a Different Dimension}} - great to reuse banished zombies like mezuki

- 1 {{Book of moon}} - Puts troublesome monsters face down and makes Red-eyes' battle effect a little easier to use

- 2 {{Instant Fusion}} - Cheats out norden and correctly summons him to get a free graveyard special summon for a synchro or xyz

- 1 {{Dragon's Mirror}} - Great way to trigger banish effects and special Dragonecro

- 2 {{Creature swap}} - Great way to give them a pyramid turtle or goblin zombie in order to get something better and plus after you destroy the card you gave them

Traps 3
- 1 {{Solemn Warning}} - Great negation for problem monsters and other card effects

- 2 {{Shiranui Style Swallow's Slash}} - Great kill card that can pop 3 cards if you banish Spirirtmaster 

Extra Deck (6-15)

- 1 {{Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon}} - Great beater and easy to special summon

- 1 {{Elder Entity Norden}} - Great way to get a one card xyz or synchro

- 1 {{Archfiend Zombie-Skull}} - Great effect and easy to summon with spectralsword

- 1-2 {{Doomkaiser Dragon}} - One of the main Synchros

- 1 {{Ancient Fairy Dragon}} - Great in any deck the uses a field card and its special summon effect is really good going first

- 1 {{Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons}} - Best synchro beater in the game 

The rest of the cards are up to you and can be filled with Rank 4 Xyzs and level 6-8 Synchros you like.

I recommend:
- 1 {{Clear Wing Synchro Dragon}}

- 1 {{Shiranui Shogunsaga}}

- 1 {{Void ogre Dragon}}

- 1 {{Abyss Dweller}}

- 1 {{Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer}}

- 1 {{Number 101: Silent Honor ARK}}

- 1 {{Number 23: Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld}}

- 1 {{Number 22: Zombiestein}}

36,"Welcome bk to the game : ] The best thing about zombie decks are their flexability, especially when playing just for fun. But before offering you some advice I have a couple questions: 
- How would you, ideally, like the deck to play(beater, synchro,xyz, mix, alt win con, other)?
- What is your budget?
- How much of the deck are you willing to change?
- What is your favorie zombie, if you have one (I would try to keep it in at all cost)?
- Do have any card you would like the deck to be based around(could be the same or different from your fav)?
- Do you have any extra cards you think might be useful in the deck (might help with the budget)?

38,"I'll first give you some general feedback/ thoughts I had while watching, then go into more detail later:

- Liked the op but its a little loud (compared to your audio)
- The intro was okay
- Audio quality is great
- It might be a good idea to add subtitles for the cut scenes and voice lines
- You looked like you were enjoying yourself
- Cuts/ edits were okay 
- Liked the sprinkle of humor 
- liked the energy
- Video length is a little on the long side
- Really liked the end card and the clickable annotations but like the op it was a little loud
- Thumbnail is okay but lacks something that ties it to your channel


Overall the LP was okay, much better than most of the ones I've seen posted on reddit; very easy to see that you have been doing this for a while. The  LP was vaguely humorous, no one scene really stood out in that regard (outside of scattered moments with Alfred) and I never stated to roll on the floor ( Rofl :  ] ) but I do remember smiling here and there. The general commentary was okay as well but again there wasn't any part in particular that really left an impression.  I guess my recommendation is to try to find a way to separate yourself from the masses, youtube is filled with many LPers so it has become paramount to find ways to differentiate yourself. This is the real difficulty in LPing and it is something I somewhat struggle with as well. 

Another area I saw for possible improvement was editing. For the most part the the cuts were okay but some of them were a little ""ruff"" (one that stood out was a cut in the middle of a scene early-ish into the LP). The edits were minimal and simple, which is okay but an improvement in the editing could add a great deal if done right, especially in the humor department. A great example of an edit that I really liked were the ellipses during the locker room scene, added quite a bit of humor because of your reaction afterwards in tandem with it. 

Hopefully my feedback was at least somewhat useful and hopefully I don't come off as sounding mean, I'm just trying to help.

P.S I'm not very good at this but I'll try from your voice I'd say (hopefully I don't ruffle any feathers): 
- Your in you mid- twenties early thirties  
- From the states probably northern east coast but could be from the west coast mainly cali
- Most likely of European decent but at the very least second generation, so mostly Americanized
- You have black hair that isn't too short but not that long
- Might have some facial hair but not a lot of it
- I envisioned you with glasses that have a black frame
- White skin but not blindingly so, about 2-4 shades darker than Anglo white 
- Slightly above average height 
- Body type is most likely one of an minimally toned mesomorph ",2016-09-30 21:27:23+00:00,d88u0i6,2.0,t1_d88jb2r,14584,letsplay

43,"- Great op
- Outside of that one guy, your audio quality is really good
- I really liked that you talked about the changes to the game, I'm a fan of mixed commentary (game knowledge, reaction, and humor)
- Even though there were three of you, a couple moments of ""dead air"" appeared (might be an area for improvement)
- Wish there was a little more humor sprinkled in (liked the ending btw)
- After a while it seemed like you guys would  forgot that you were recording
- Seemed like you guys were enjoying yourselves 
- Length is a bit on the long side (could easily cut in half), some moments where I started to lose interest
- Liked the end slate but clickable annotations would be nice (might want to cut down on the length to get better youtube viewer retention numbers)
- Really like the thumbnail

Overall the video was okay, from an entertainment stand point you had your moments but after sometime you started to lose my attention. 
At some point it seemed like you guys would forget that you were recording an LP, so the video devolved to just watching a couple of guys play like normal. This brings me to another possible area for improvement video length. The overall length of the video was way too long for this type of game, I would aim for about 7 to no more than 15 minutes unless you guys feel confident that you could fill in the time with great commentary. To have the best chance of filling in the time with commentary a really good mix would be your only option; talking about the game (theory or other), humor( making jokes or funny remarks), and reaction (reacting to what is happening in the game). You guys did some of this but mostly fell into a mainly reactionary style but didn't really go for over the top reactions to make it up (which some enjoy but I honestly don't).  For the most part the only videos that can reasonably be 25 + minutes are LPs of story driven games or LPs of games like MC or similar survival style games.

45,"In my opinion and /u/BasedHoppip you are running too many tributes. Do to the limiting of Stormforth, another sac out let is highly necessary; 3x Hippo Carnival and 1x Hip Hippo are certainly a great choice for this. I recommend a different approach, the two main problems monarchs have right now is brick hands and a replacement tribute outlet, both of which could be fixed with a little creativity. By adding 3x {{Blackwing - Gofu the Vague Shadow}}, 3x {{Allure of Darkness}}, 1-2x Kuraz, and 1 more Prime monarch you should be able to fix both main problems. 

Gofu is not only a dark for allure, which could unbrick your hand, but is a free special with a nice aspect to it, the tokens. Gofu's tokens are great targets for Kuraz, which could also help unbrick your hand. Another great target for Kuraz are the Prime monarchs, who just come back if you need them. 

Other possible addition to the deck are {{foolish burial}} and RoTa , like Hoppip mentioned. Rota is a great way to deck thin and find your squire to get you going. Foolish might seem like a wierd choice but it has a couple great interractions with the deck, it could be used to dump Eidos to banish out for tribute fodder or to dump Erubus to get back any monarch, including himself, to your hand. 

As for what to take out, I'll leave that to your personal taste but I would highly recommend keeping the Vanity's Fiend. Not only is the Fiend a great floodgate but they are targets for allure if need be. ",2016-09-14 05:11:59+00:00,d7m21x7,1.0,t3_52orok,3972,yugioh

Banisher/Macro/D-Fissure and Gravekeeper's Servant, this combo doesn't allow your opp to ever declare an attack because the card couldn't go into the graveyard.

Inferno Tempest and Lava Golem, an easy way to banish a lot of cards in one shot which could be later used with Dynamite, Eiza, and/or Necroface.

Soul Absorption and any banish outlet, to gain more LP then you'll know what to do with.

Vanity's and any banish outlet (except D-fissure), unless destroyed directly it won't self destruct",2016-09-13 20:30:53+00:00,d7lhq2w,9.0,t1_d7lafpx,8846,yugioh

This deck has some common card techs form the Banish decks of old but is primary based on a couple card options that they didn't really have access to. The main focus of this particular deck is to abuse Snow (which can be used on either player's turn) and Gren Maju da Eiza. These two cards work in tandom but in order to do this I added a small lightsworn engine as fuel. The lightsworns can not only give you banish targets for Snow but also could fuel Gren Maju da Eiza (if d-fussion/macro is out) even without Snow. The lightsworns also allows you to have more options with synchros and Xyz.  Another mini engine component is Gold Sarcophagus, this card could be used as an Mst with Shiranui Spiritmaster, ten more cards in the banish zone with Necroface, or even as a free special summon with DD Scout Plane. The latter two options also work with Allure but also nets you a plus 1-2.

- Sort and sweet intro

- There are times when you guys feel a little ""tired"" or lacking in energy
- You could tell you guys were enjoying yourselves (in a way), especially in the later half
- I liked the sprinkle of humor but wished there was more
- The end slate was okay but it feels like wasted space, could easily incorporate some links to other series or your desired social media outlet
- I really like the thumbnail

Overall the video was okay but the general relaxed tone made me start to lose interest from time to time but at around the six minute mark I started to enjoy the back and forth between both of you. Which leads me to a major problem I had while watching, the general mood during the deaths. Its okay that you showed the multitudes of deaths (which is natural for this game) but I wished you would have done something to hold your viewer's attention. Maybe make light of the situation with humor (which you did do but sparingly) or make a nice edit to go along with it. My favorite parts in the video all include one common trait, a nice humorous interaction between you both. 

Something else that I noticed that could be improved is the ""energy"" you guys exude throughout your video. There were times that I found myself starting to get bored due to the general ambiance being brought forth. Unfortunately there is no quick fix and I don't expect you guys to always be peppy but a little more ""energy"" here and there would go a long way.

1x {Black Rose Moonlight Dragon} - Easy lvl 7 and effect could be really useful to bounce a problem creature

1x {Abyss Dweller} - Great versus and deck that needs the graveyard 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possible cards to update the deck in the future:

1-3x {PSY-Framelord Omega} - The best possible lvl 8 synchro for this deck, Solitaire by itself can make it and can be used to un-banish a mezuki 

1-2x {Twin Twisters} - Discard outlet and great for clearing scales and problem spells/traps

1x {The Phantom Knights of Break Sword} - Great for getting rid of problem cards

1-2x {Daigusto Emeral} - Can be used to re-use synchro and norden

70,"I'll start off with some general feedback and thoughts I had while watching the video, then I'll go into more detail:

- Cute opening
- Might not be the best game to make a montage out of. It would probably help to play this game with someone else, so you could ""play"" off of each other
- I liked the text at the bottom
- The montage feels like its missing edits (especially in the beginning) 
- Feels like you were lacking some energy
- Over all length was perfect but I didn't really like some of the clips
- An end slate would be a welcomed addition and maybe a link/annotation to a playlist of other Battleborn related content
- Thumbnail is okay but lacks something to tie it to your channel

Overall the montage was okay but for the most part it lacked the feel that most montages aim for. Most montages tend to gravitate towards either showing you some funny moments or showing you some ""epic"" moments, moments of extreme game play that most likely show off their own skill/luck. This was one of the main problems I noticed, it felt like you were aiming for something down the middle, which is fine, but the humorous parts (in my opinion) fell a little short and the ""epic"" parts weren't amplified enough for someone who knows very little about the game's inherent intricacies. A solution to both of these problems, in post, are edits; the addition of a well fitting graphic and/or sound would go a long way, even though I did like some of the ones you sprinkled throughout the later half of the video. 

Another, yet comparably minor, issue I had while watching was a ""lack of energy"". I understand how hard this could be to stay ""energized"" while recording (especially by yourself), I always have a hard time with this, but you would be surprised how much this takes away from a video. Even though the video was short, I found myself getting slightly bored here and there and even had to watch the video more than once because of it (and I wanted to make sure I gave you some good feedback : ] ).  

But like I said, overall the montage was okay but has some room for improvement. If you need any clarification on any of my feedback don't hesitate to ask, one of my favorite things to do on Fridays (if I have time) is to help LPers improve.

The main combo would be {{Shiranui Solitaire}} into uni-zombie then uni's effect putting a mezuki into the graveyard then you could banish mezuki to special back the solitaire, afterwards you could go into a Rank 4 or a lvl 8 synchro (maybe {{Shiranui Shogunsaga}} ). Another great shiranui would be {{Shiranui Spectralsword}}, together with a lvl 4 in the graveyard you could synchro one of the 3 lvl 6 zombie synchros ignoring their summoning conditions.

- I don't know why but you reminded me of Markiplier (especially the beginning monologue)
- Audio quality is really good
- For me the audio balance felt fine, but you might need to lower the game sounds a bit
- You made good use of the facecam, I liked how expresive you were toward the face cam. Might of liked the face cam a bit more if you had your lights off.
- Kinda liked the close up edit
- Not really your fault because I started watching at ep 3, but I was kind of lost for the majority of the episode
- Commentary was okay, due to this being a horror game the commentary was mostly screams and you talking about getting scared.
- Lack of ""dead air"", always a good thing
- Liked the endslate and the thumbnail

Overall I really enjoyed the episode and even subbed. Even though I don't tend to watch this type of LP, I felt drawn to your personality and great use of facecam.

78,"- Interesting game choice but might not be good for an LP
- With so many people (more than one) in an LP it might be a good idea to introduce everyone before you start a new LP episode 
- The edits were cute but might have but a little too loud
- I liked the meeting room bit
- Commentary needs a lot of work, the jokes/puns were nice but the game commentary made me start to loose interest. The commentary used the humor as a crutch instead of using it as a ""garnish"".  
- Didn't like the semi-abrupt ending into silence
- End card was okay but you should use the thumbnails for each of the episode instead. To a new viewer, its hard to tell what each of the three annotated episodes are.  
- Thumbnail is okay, simple but has everything I look for 

Overall the episode wasn't really ""my cup of tea"" but I could see others liking this sort of video after some fine tuning. In my opinion, the biggest area that could be improved is commentary; outside of the jokes/puns there really isn't any part of the commentary that left a lasting impression in my mind. For the most part, the general commentary felt very passive but the game is a major reason for this. This game might have been better suited for a shorter(no longer than 5 min) high energy/high humor ""best of"" style of LP but overall not really a good game to LP in general. Its very hard for a game like this to retain the attention of a new viewer because it's heavily reliant on the LPer themselves.

- Great audio quality but I wish the game sounds were a little louder
- The edits were nice (the zoom-in scene actually got a giggle out of me) but the one at 8:30-ish was *a lot* louder than the rest and that made it a little jarring.
- I like how you share your thoughts on the game
- Sometimes it felt like you were ""holding yourself back"" in your commentary/reactions but it just might be how you usually act (i'm the same way)

**Specific Feedback**

######Commentary:
  Over all the commentary was okay but also felt like it was lacking in a few areas. Though I am by no means an expert in the field of commentating, your commentary seemed like you intended to make a regular episodic LP, didn't like how it felt, then decided it should be a pseudo ""best of"". In my opinion what makes ""best of"" great is the humorous commentary/ reaction for each clip, though you did have that for a few of the clips; some of the ones chosen felt more at home in a regular LP.  

The commentary, at times, also felt like you were purposely talking low to not disturb someone in the house, which kind of bothered me to some degree. This leads me to another problem I had, your snickering. I really like to see an LPer enjoying themselves while recording an LP but the constant snickering did take away a lot of humor from your episode. Like I said I enjoy watching someone who is having a good time, and even laughing at times, but the snickering felt like you were just purposely holding yourself back.

######Edits:
The edits were fine but simple. It was just cutting up the whole two hour LP into segments, which makes choosing the right segment even harder. To be honest, the over arching theme of the LP felt mottled, like you didn't really have a plan for what the final product would look like before editing.  

**Overall**   

The LP was okay but needs fine tuning. I did enjoy some parts of the LP but it didn't ""tickle my fancy"" at times. I highly recommend having a general idea of what you want the LP to be before recording, which would make editing a lot easier and feel more fluid.

- Slight audio problems in the begging, the clipping is very apparent and audio quality/level disparity is rather noticeable 
- I like the edits in general but the volume for them are way to high 
- Commentary is okay and I like chemistry between you both 
- The end slate is okay but you should think about maybe finding a way to include links to other series or past episodes 
- The thumbnail is nice, simple, and has the qualities that I always look for

Overall the episode was okay, I liked the energy and some of the clips were extremely humorous. You guys have good chemistry and it really shows that you enjoy each others company.  

######Audio Quality

This was probably my biggest problem throughout the episode. The audio levels seemed to rise and fall as the video progressed which made it very difficult to find a viewing volume that felt comfortable, without knowing more about how you guys are recording the only recommendation I could offer is try to equalize the audio. Clipping was also a rather big problem which might be fixed by lowering the gain or moving the mic a little father from yourself. 


######Video Quality and Editing 
 
The video quality was great! It really showed that this is what you have built your channel on and that you put in a lot of work into the editing. But on that note I did find that the edited sounds didn't match the overall volume of the LPers, which caused them to be extremely jarring at times. The edits themselves, on the other hand, were well done and never really felt unwarranted but it did seem like you relied on them a little too much at times. In my eyes, edits should be complementary and used as a way to enhance a clip but throughout the episode it was rare to see a clip that didn't rely on the editing.   

P.S Please keep in mind I don't mean to sound mean or overly picky, I'm just trying to help ",2016-07-01 17:33:46+00:00,d4vldqv,2.0,t1_d4vionk,3419,letsplay

100,"I will first give generic feedback then I'll go into more specific feedback for the areas you requested. I would also like to premise my feedback by saying that my feedback is completely based on my opinion.

- Okay opening, simple but gets the job done
- Audio is great but you might need a pop filter if you don't already have one
- Unique game choice 
- The way you did the edits was rather cute
- I like the splashes of humor throughout the episode
- Your diction was easy to understand
- For the most part the commentary was very structured due to the game being mostly text based, might be an area that might need improving 
- End card is nice, simple, and incorporates everything that I look for 
- Try not to be too down on yourself
- Your thumbnail could be a little better, it lacks something that ties it to your channel (unlike your other thumbnails)

Overall the LP was okay but may not be my ""cup of tea"". I don't tend to one who enjoys text based story games so please take my criticism with a grain of salt. The moments I enjoyed while watching were those that came solely from you which, in my opinion, is a great place to be. Though a little more energy here and there would have been welcomed, I enjoyed the moments were you show yourself either being humorous or simply enjoying the game.   

######First Set of Questions

By interactivity I assume you mean how your commentary interacts with the dialog, I suppose you did a pretty good job. You try to input your thoughts on what was happening and even slip a little humor here and there which is great but I started to feel slightly uninterested due to the lack of energy in it. This may be somewhat difficult to fix for this type of game though and would be entirely reliant on you, as an LPer. In the past, I have seen others attempt to LP guided text based games and the only ones that I have really enjoyed are those in which the commentator is trying to ""breath life into the game"". They try to find humor in the dialogue, change up the voices for each character( which you did do to an extent), force their own ""style"" into the game, or even try to show with their enthusiasm that they're enjoying the game.

As for the visual gag idea, I think their inclusion to an LP has to feel somewhat warranted. Although I really enjoy those types of edit, in this particular LP there wasn't really moment where a visual gag wouldn't have felt forced and would only detract from the LP. 

######Second Set of Questions

In my opinion the decision to make series or a ""one shot"" is one that should be made on a game by game basis. Most games tend to lend itself to one or the other, but is is true that viewership will drop as the series goes on; unless it is a series were each episode doesn't really have to be watched sequentially( i.e Minecraft). You have to decide for yourself whether the game is interesting enough to keep the attention of your viewer for 20+ minutes or if it might be better to cut up the episodes to make them more manageable. 

######Third Question

To be honest the only really glaring part of the LP that I would change would be the game. Though I really like to see variety with games chosen to be LPed, some games are only really meant to be enjoyed by the person playing it and I think this game might fall into that category. Even though the game itself was quite interesting, I found myself losing interest while watching. This isn't particularly your fault though, you at least try to pepper in your thoughts and a slight amount of humor to combat this but it's just that type of game.

102,"It depends on your mic but if you can try to lower the gain on the mic, that should go a long way to avoid the controller sounds. Only other way I could think to deal with it is with a noise gate but controller sounds aren't the end of the world it was just something I noticed could be improved.

The commentary suggestion was based on my own personal tastes but I really like it when the LPer talks about a variety of things as they see fit, for example their thought process while they fight a boss or maybe some background/ story to the game. Commentary can be very flexible for most games and what makes an LP special is how the LPer chooses to arrange it. 

It depends on how you decide to record each episode, the main ways I like to see an episode end is with some type of outro into the end card or a cut at a low point fading into the end card. Both are fine and it's up to what you enjoy the most. After watching the episode again, when you chose to end it was fine but the lack of an end card is what made it feel abrupt.

104,"- Audio's quality is pretty good
- Wish the controller sounds were lower. If you haven't yet, noise removal should help somewhat but trying to use the controller as far away from the mic as possible might be your only hope. Btw your breathing was a bit loud in the beginning and noise removal should help with that too
- I know it's hard but you might need to annunciation a bit more, sometimes it was hard to understand what you were saying 
- Commentary was mostly reactionary, which is okay but not ideal. I tend to like a mix between reaction, personal opinion, humor, and maybe some thing else you might find humorous or relevant 
- I like the splash of humor (RIP poor boat man)
- Didn't like the random cut at the end
- An end card with annotations to other video or links would be a welcomed addition 
- Thumbnail is okay

Overall the episode was nice, short and sweet. Improvements can be made though, the two main problems I had was with the cut at the end and background sounds, both of which shouldn't be that hard to fix and would go a long way. The overall commentary does need a bit of work but that is something that takes time. I see a lot of potential in the episode and I hope I see more of your work in the future :  ]

- Good SEO is all about trying to be specifically vague, by this I mean you try to find key words that can describe your video specifically but also be something someone might be looking for (in a vague sense). A tip that I've come across that helps is that a video title needs to have a couple of things in this order; channel name (has to be first), game you are playing, episode number, and attention grabber. 
- I'm by no means an expert but to my understanding the best way to build an audience is to try find other LPers who have similar likes/ dislikes to yourself and comment on their videos after a while they should comment back and your community grows 

Overall your video quality is great and it's great that you really want to grow your channel were it counts, your audience.

- Audio quality is perfect, but the game sounds might be a little too loud
- Didn't really seem to make the most use of the face cam. I really like when the LPer looks directly at the camera, when he can, and talks to the viewers. You did use it as a way to display your emotions while playing but not as often as I would have liked

P.S.S The problem was that Tracer's end screen pose was overly sexual for the character's persona but I don't really agree with that and you unlock those poses with either the loot box or buying it with the in-game currency ",2016-05-12 17:06:58+00:00,d32watd,1.0,t3_4j1h7l,2755,LetsPlayCritiques

Overall great video, I thoroughly enjoyed it and even decided to sub to both of your channels. I have to admit that the techno part was a little too weird for me and at that point I started to feel the need to fast forward but didn't think it would be fair to you, I would recommend adding a skip annotation just in case next time.

143,"- Audio quality and levels are fine
- I personally don't mind these types of videos (highlight reels) as long as they are done right. Unfortunately a lot of the scenes that were chosen weren't particularly interesting or entertaining. This video was done as a mix between a highlight, review, and silent play through but I would have preferred if you would have just picked one and went with it.
- Your voice is seriously lacking energy and that greatly takes away from your video 
- Commentary needs some work but I have heard way worst, way too much ""dead air"" throughout the video though.
- I do like that you shared your opinion throughout the video as well as talk about the game itself.
- Video length is a tad long for a highlight video 
- The addition of some type of end slate would be a welcomed
- Video thumbnail is a little plain and wouldn't draw my attention if it was on my feed

Overall I don't mind watching highlight style videos but what you made isn't truly one . There are some glaring problems that need to be addressed (e.i dead air, mono tone voice, poor choice in clips, etc.) but once you resolve them, I am confident that the end product would be something great! Next time you finish a video, try to do an impartial critique of it, try to find the problems yourself and you would be amazed how much that helps you prevent them in the future.

147,"- I liked the opening 
- Might want to adjust the webcam elevation a little
- Audio levels seem fine but you should probably try to do something about your mouse sounds. The sound of you repositioning your mouse is quite loud
- Video quality for both the cam and the game are fine but the game does seem a little too bright
- Not a fan of the use of a webcam for something like this, it mostly just showed off your ""thinking"" face. IMO a face cam should only be used to show off various expressions and emotions felt throughout the play through that could add to the LP experience (fear, joy, confusion, etc)
- I like that you choose to play something different and original 
- Might want to work a little on your commentary, started to get better at some points but overall purely reactionary. That is something that I have a hard time with as well and seems very hard to master.
- I liked that you shared your thoughts on the game at the end 
- Great end slate but clickable annotations would be nice 
- Video length is way too long, especially for a game like this. I would try to aim for about 10-12 minutes

- Liked the editing, some parts could easily be cut out though 
- It really shows in the video that you guys are enjoying yourselves, always a good thing 
- The commentary is very chaotic (especially in the beginning)
- Seems like you try to stay mindful of ""dead air"" but was still a slight problem (really should at the end)
- The humor is okay but some of the jokes fell flat with me 
- Really appreciate that put the name's of the players who were playing in the fighting game.
- Video length is very long, started to lose interest throughout the video but tried to watch the whole thing. I would have preferred if the games were separate videos. I tend to prefer LPs that are about 10-15 minutes long, unless its a very story driven game.
- Didn't like the abrupt ending to the video
- End card is okay but clickable annotations would be a welcomed addition.
- Channel art and thumbnails are okay, I like that the video thumbnails stick out and have a common theme but would prefer if the background was different for each game.

So I picked an episode of Amnesia me and my friend Smuggy started. It's a new format, and my friend isn't too used to being recorded. We also started Face Cam for Amnesia, since Smuggy's such a wuss I had to share it with the world.

We're working on:
Audio levels, especially Smuggy talking under his breath.
Syncing, the syncs off on this run partially cause framerate issues between facecam and game footage caused a hiccup 

Tell us what you think we can improve, Plum Party's still a fresh show and we're looking to find what works best for us! Thank you!",2016-03-25 21:18:25+00:00,d1dhjeo,1.0,t3_4bvb3m,58576,letsplay
169,"Hey there, Senzyr here!

So right off the bat, the thumbnail has a great layout! BUT, the ingame asset is too dark, too crowded and hard to make out at the thumbnail size.  I would suggest choosing screenshots that would be easy to see at a smaller scale or even just use a variety of assets. You don't have to set a rule for yourself that you MUST use screens every thumbnail, pick what works best.

The camera's great, and if you hadn't said this was your first vid with one I would not have known. great facial expressions, great energy, not distracting when I want to watch the game, but when I want to watch you, you have my attention. I must learn from master Commander. The background is a little too beige, as in it's too close to your skin tone and blends you into the background. I know some people don't like stuff in the background but I think they really help with

1. distinguishing your face and vid from other people 
2. keeping you separate from the background
3. gives personality. A lot of facecams nowadays use the foam sound proof stuff and it's boring, I love to be able to see a bit of character from what's in your set up, it's more personal.

I see you have an oriental fan on the wall, if you brought it in close it would help make your face stick out more from the BG. 

Outro was good, music wasn't amazing or memorable, but it gave something to hide silence. the slate itself is great but I suggest finding a spot to put the logo of the recommended video so that we know what you want us to watch. If I didn't already know Stardew Valley I wouldn't know that's what you recommended. Also use Note annotations so that white bar doesn't mess up the aesthetic!

Content was good, really good. Your energy and reaction is well controlled and appropriate. I was wondering if you'd notice you left the suit, and your reaction when you did was soooo goooood. :D
There were a bit of walky boring bits that could be sped up as well, but I know it's hard to cut your own content, since you did fill the void. Overall though, its something to keep in mind, even if you feel you kept it interesting between the action, unless there's a serious chronological* reason to not skip content, consider cutting the fluff.

*Chronological meaning if you skip this boring part, the audience won't know how we got to where we are now. Sometimes you gotta show something boring just so the viewer can keep track of what's happening.",2016-03-25 21:06:16+00:00,d1dh37x,2.0,t1_d1dcalw,7301,letsplay
170,"Hey there, Senzyr here!

Darkest Dungeon's really cool, and really hard so I understand the lack of progress that can happen as you prepare. Having said that, I think it's best if you skip the prep before sending your guys out and instead summarize real quick what your set up is. It takes almost 5 mins to get started, which can lose people easily. Instead get started right away and give us a summary of the layout. It will also drop the length of the video, which is more appealing.

I would also try to vary the conversation. This might fall into personal taste territory, but I feel like talking too MUCH about the game, especially with a game like Darkest Dungeon which is procedural and grindy, wears on the player. BUT if you talk about something interesting and different, the viewer could WATCH you play, but also LISTEN to your interesting dialogue. Right now, it's very easy to zone out after ten minutes because the conversation's just reactionary and only about the game, which doesn't have much going on mostly.

- A simple tip to sync audio with video is record a segment in the beginning where you say what you are doing for a couple button presses, for example say up when you move the joystick up. Make sure to cut this out of the final video if you do use this method 
- Audio quality could be improved 
- Not the best game choice for an LP, these types of game tend to be very repetitive, monotonous, and lack easy ""jumping off points"" to commentate 
- Background music is extremely distracting, I would personally prefer to listen to the game music but if you want to use your own music please lower it a little more

- Purple text at the top left is extremely distracting 
- Interesting game choice! ""Scary"" games are a very hard thing to LP, its always about balance and very easy to mess up with over acting. You guys did a decent job with it but there is room for improvement.
- It was obvious that this wasn't a true blind LP but lacks an analysis of the story that tends to come with that style of LP (not sure if this was intended to feel like a blind LP)
- The intermission edit is cute but overused, would prefer if the episode was slimmed down a bit 
- I like the randomness of the commentary but you guys rarely talk about what is happening in the game (story wise) 
- The small review you guys did at the end was nice 
- The end card is cute but clickable annotations would nice
- The length of the video might be a little excessive, might be off putting to new viewers. I would've preferred if this was split into two episodes.
- I like the general look of your channel and the thumbnail for this episode is okay

- Pretty good audio, sometimes it sounds like your thumbing the mic but could be due to your own voice. Might need either a windscreen or shock mount

187,"Welcome to the LP family, always warms my heart when I get the privilege to help a new content creator grow and become as great as I know they can.

Here is the review of the episode: 

-  Some type of intro would be nice for future videos
-  Audio is okay but could be improved 
-  Its great that you talk about specific things about the game throughout the video
-  The video felt like a review, not sure if this was intended from the title
-  Low energy and it seemed like you were reading from a paper which is a slight problem
-  Video length for this type of game might be too long, started to loose interest after about the 8 minute mark. This was mainly due to the game's repetitive nature
-  The end card feels very generic and doesn't include anything related to retaining viewers; annotations for other series on your channel, past/future videos you create, etc.

Overall the video was okay, especially for your first LP. A lot of the framework is there for a good video, all that needs to be added is a little pizzazz.

- Slight echo in the audio
- Try to watch the lip smacks, very hard to do btw
- A link to the first episode as an annotation in the beginning would be nice
- Hard to do an LP on a game like this because it usually results in long periods of silence but you did a reasonable job at preventing this
- Video is a little long for a game like this, try to aim for 10-12 minutes but you could have easily ended at after the first game
- The commentary kind of lacked something substantial, was mostly reaction based and a little more humor could have been infused. My favorite parts in LPs like this are those that included info about the game
- Choice of game is very unique, which helps to make your channel stand out 
- An end card would be a welcomed addition 
- Might be a good idea to update your channel art but the thumbnail for this episode is fine but lacks something that immediately ties it to your channel

One of the best ways for an LPer to show their creativity as well as help build their brand is through the opening and end slate. Though for this type of video I don't recommend a typical intro, an end slate wouldn't hurt. With an end slate you could have a nice way to show off past episodes to viewers who enjoyed your work in the hopes it gives them that little extra push to sub.

- I'm guessing the video is meant to be a review of the patch, it might be in your best interest to title as one

- A little more energy would be a welcomed addition 
- The end slate is okay but it would be nice if its duration was a little longer and you added a slot to show off a past episode
- Not a fan of the annotation at the end, would prefer it to be incorporated into the end slate  instead of blocking most of it

224,"- Audio is great
- Commentary was ok but I tend to prefer LP commentary based on the game (reaction, game info, etc)  with the LPer's essence sprinkled in
- Great sense of humor
- Don't really think that the game was the best choice for an LP
- No ""dead air"", usually a good thing but sometimes it felt like you were just rambling to prevent dead air
- The video length was way too long, I felt a good end point was around 6-7 minutes but I noticed that you have already remedied that problem in future episodes. 
- An end slate is always a good addition to a video; it allows the viewer to easily find similar content on your channel and gives the video a nice ""completed"" feel
- The thumbnail for this episode is nice and so is your channel art

I hope at least some of what I wrote helped you out and remember what I wrote is based on my personal taste, so feel free to be true to you  : ]

- Higher quality would be greatly appreciated (720p or more)
- Might need to move the screen behind you a little more but it didn't really bother me
- A windscreen and/or shock mount might be a good addition, sometimes the tapping and wind caused some harsh sounds to be picked up
- Like the energy
- Might want to adjust the gain on the mic to prevent picking up some of the keyboard sounds 
-  Interesting game choice 
- Great humor
- Background sounds were a little distracting 
- Video length is a little on the long side 
- I really like how you interacted with the face cam during the video 
- Might want to turn off steam notifications while recording
- End graphic was nice but if you add spotlight annotations you could make them clickable links. Also you could add a section on either side where you could display other episodes on your channel or from this series, that way if someone wanted to see more they could do so easily.

- The channel art is ok, very simple, but didn't catch my attention 
- I like your logo
- Nice variety of content on your channel 
- Its nice that you have your playlist all set up but wish they didn't have private videos in them. What I do is set up a ""rule "" on youtube so the playlist add the videos as they come out
- Wish you guys filled out the about section (that actually reminded me that I need to change mine one day)


Thoughts on Halo 5 ep1
- Like the op but it felt a couple seconds too long
- Audio is fine, its been quite a while since I've heard audio without any echo
- I actually laughed out loud while watching the video

288,"I'm very happy that I've been of help to you. On average I tend to enjoy LPs that are between 9-20 min long but it all depends on the type of game. Minecraft LPs tend to run between 20-24 but GTA 5 LPs could easily be 3-9, so it all depends on the game and the style of LP you wish to make. For this particular game I would recommend aiming for no more than 15 min, that run time should account for a run or two as well as any additional comments you would like to make before/after.

The parts I would like to have a little more information was the dungeon itself and what was the goal. I've never gotten a chance to play this game so from a ""noob's"" point of view I really didn't understand what the goal of the dungeons were until you reached the end.

Here is some feedback based on my personal taste

- Very interesting game choice. I have never seen an LP on this game before.
- An explanation of what the game is and a story recap would be nice at the start of each video, this could prevent new viewers from becoming lost
- Nice sense of humor
- Audio levels are perfect, but your audio is kinda low quality but don't worry about that for now
- At some points you started to mumble a little which is a little off-putting 
- Very little ""dead air"" which is always good
- A brief explanation on the mission would be nice, especially if your viewers are like me and try to watch videos while trying to do other things at the same time.
- Try not to be so down on yourself, confidence is always a good trait to have in a LPer  
- When you figure out how, could you aim for 10- 15 min long episodes. I started to get a little bored near the 20 min mark.

Hopefully my feedback was helpful and always try to critique your own videos, sometimes you might catch something us ""critics"" might have missed : ]. It also help if you try to make videos with ""would I watch this?"" in the back of your mind. ",2015-09-18 16:12:07+00:00,cv5zclp,2.0,t1_cv5t1zf,10520,letsplay
293,"- Slight echo in the audio
- Really like that you explained a little about what is happening, makes it really nice for first time viewers
- Would be nice if the audio in the cut scene was a little louder
- I like how you try to interact with the audience throughout the video
- It's great how you share your opinion about the game play and offer ways to improve the game
- It's a shame that you removed any jokes you might have made since I prefer watching an LP that aims to be on the ""lighter"" side of things

Great video overall, I greatly enjoyed watching your LP and your video even convinced me to sub. I have one question for you though, which style of LP did you enjoy making the most( I haven't had a chance to watch your other version yet) ?

- The title made me think this wasn't an LP 
- Slight echo in the audio
- Got a little boring in the beginning when you were deciding equips since I have never played this game, might be a good idea to decide your equips before recording then explain your choices when you start recording.
- When you were playing you didn't say much, especially when fighting. This caused the video to seem more like a run through and less like a LP
- Not sure if it was the game/recording software/you computer but there are many dropped frames in the vid
- Would be nice if a little more was explained, at many points in the video I felt lost
- Good sense of humor

- Audio quality is good but the volume difference between the both of you is way too big, I was forced to lower the volume a great deal.

322,"- I really wish the game sounds for the cut scene was a lot louder, especially because you chose to not talk over it. The low volume caused the first 7 min to be kinda hard to watch.
- The idea to add in the cut scenes was nice overall 
- Your overall volume was also quite low, making some of your speech very hard to understand
- The commentary itself didn't really add all that much. Half of the time of this video was you reading the text or silence. Would be nice if you made more jokes/humorous remarks or talked about the game play
- The general editing was ok, some of the cuts were abrupt but I really didn't mind any enough to remember them specifically.
- I really like the end slate; looks nice and simple, straight to the point

To answer this question fully, a full deck list and ""taste"" need to be considered, as well as the meta in which the deck is used. Though the extra 5k power per kill in Tanaz is nice, its 8k base makes ""numbers"" a little awkward unless you also use some type of 8k+ rearguards. But if your meta is riddled with cross rides, that changes a few things since this card would be able to hit numbers even if it isn't boosted.
