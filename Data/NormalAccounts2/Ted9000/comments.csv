Biggest difference you will have between the cars is the entertainment systems in the cars, and the over all interior.  The 2016 are much, much nicer.  Even the 2016 touring is much nicer than the 2014 grand touring. IMO

Things I do not like about the 2016 Ground Touring I am driving.  The heads up display that shows you your speed.  It is dumb.  I do not like the white leather.  The car I am driving has 2300 miles and it already looks dirty. 

Things that make it a lot nicer.  Bose sound system and the GUI of the radio.  MUCH BETTER!  I like the addition of all the windows being the one click up and down.  I like the automatic wind shield wipers.  I like the HID head lights and I like the LED interior lights.
