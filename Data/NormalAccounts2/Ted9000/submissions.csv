I will be using as an all around server, but mainly for Plex and iTunes. I think 3TB for now is plenty for storage. Can integrated graphics run rocket league?  IDK, but I like the case... but HDMI 2.0 and stuff might need a change...idk
My 4k TV will be connected though HDMI.  Will stream to my gaming PC and my bedroom TV.  Maybe only 2 streams at most at one time.  Some streaming remotely.  100/100 Fiber. 

Mainly looking for suggestions of cases, fans, PSU, etc that would be a better bang for the buck while keeping it quiet. I don't normally consider how quiet the system will be when building my gaming machines.

(Also, if anybody knows of a board that has on board HDMI 2.0 that would be great.)
