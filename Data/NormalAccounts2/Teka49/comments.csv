29,"1. It causes our main core abilities (CS, Judgement, Exo) to be really weak. There was a popular post of a paladin picture with a wet noodle as a weapon photoshopped in this subreddit somewhere. Our hard hitting abilities are our holy power spenders which I am personally not a fan of. Pvp wise it is very difficult and frustrating to try and kill someone without wings. The damange isnt consistent and pressing our abilities (which used to hit hard before holy power) is unsatisfying. 

2. Its boring (again subjective). Since I am not focused on the damage my core abilities do because I know they hit like a noodle, the focus is holy power. Rotation wise - should I dump, generate etc. Thus, every fight I will be blatantly staring at my holy power instead of a fight. This is similar to balance druids and their eclipse bar. I wouldn't mind staring at my ability cooldowns like an enhancement shaman.

58,"I can try and give you the feel of each dps class. Not sure if this is what you are looking for.

DK - Frost can be very simplistic but there is a lot of down time much like warriors where you sit and do nothing. Unholy is more complex and doesnt hit as big numbers but a lot less down time. Both specs have a few procs to look out for.

Druid - Feral is on paper quite easy, however it gets really complicated when you actually play it. Most relative to a rogue but with bleeds. Balance is also a complicated spec if you don't know what you're doing but can top the charts if done correctly. It is unique to itself and you will have to try it to see if you like it. 

Hunter - Extremely mobile and arguably easy to play. Focus management can be slightly tricky to min max at first but isn't hard to master. You will most likely be the person to deal with mechanics in raids. Although there are procs in each spec, they are not as dependent on the procs as warriors are.

Mage - All specs deal high damage as you are a glass cannon. Frost is generally seen as the easiest. Arcane and Fire require slightly more skill. Fire is the most proc dependent but can be fixed with higher ilvl gear. 

Monk - WW can be difficult to master as it requires a lot of management of buffs, cds, energy and chi. Can be very rewarding and the playstyle is well designed. Not proc based at all, but has procs.

Paladin - Ret is different to play depending on your level 100 talent. A final verdict build is quite easy to manage, while seraphim will complicate things. Holy power is in some ways like combo points, but much slower. You build one HP at a time to a max of 5 and dump 3 at a time. Ret is dependent on procs in many situations.

Priest - Shadow is interesting as the level 100 talent Clarity of Power introduces 'Dot Weaving'. You may also play a brain dead way where you just mind spike, mind blast and devouring plague with no need for dots. Definitely worth looking into. Spriests are not proc based.

Rogue - Each spec is notably different. Assassination is seen as a brain dead spec. Easy to play and manage. Generate combo points, dump them and keep up a dot. Combat is slightly more difficult while Sub is most complex. I believe only Assassination has procs but is not dependent on them.

Shaman - Enh is a CD based spec with a lot of RNG on procs. The procs have a really high rate so it is not something to worry about. Elemental is very proc based with a simple rotation. There may be periods of down time in Elemental where you just spam lightning bolt. 

Warlock - All 3 specs are again notably different. Destruction is great if you like throwing giant green bolts of death. Demonology is if you want to turn into a demon whilst having demons. Affliction is great if you like eating plain tasteless oatmeal. I believe Demonology is the most proc based of all of them.

Warrior - You know.

79,"Talking as a sole pvper and wow player for 6 years, I can clearly tell you why its not that simple.

1. **WoW is a PvE game.** Unfortunately this will always be true and we (pvpers) will always get the short end of the stick. The only reason they are 'focusing' more on pvp in the next legion expansion with the pvp talent system is because they destroyed pvp in WoD. Did you think it was a coincidence that the wow sub drops occured exactly at the same time big named pvpers quit? The majority of that sub drop were pvpers. 

2. **WoW PvP is much more difficult and complicated to watch, learn and understand compared to MOBAs and FPSs.** No, I am not saying MOBAs and FPSs are easy, of course not - those high skilled players are extremely skilled. I am saying WoW pvp is much more difficult to get into compared to other games. Have you ever let someone watch you play WoW compared to say DoTA or CSGo? Watching it is pretty simple. MOBA characters usually have a couple of skills and FPSs simply have guns. Each WoW class has a ridiculous amount of abilities, necessary macros and hotkey setups. For example I showed my cousin how to play Nova in HoTS, in about 5 minutes he was able to comprehend the basics of both the character and the game itself. I showed him WoW and he couldn't understand much at all.

3. &gt;perhaps WoW needs now, a better PvP community.

**WoW doesnt need a BETTER pvp community, we simply need one.** After the sub drop, most people that watch pvp youtubers such as Bahjeera, Hansol, Cobrak, Thyraz and Pilav aren't even subbed. There currently isnt a pvp community and I think blizzard is aware. Will Legion fix it? TBH its looking good but there are many issues that could be really bad with normalized gearing and even a seperate talent system. 


4. **Its too late.** There are two reasons why its basically too late for this idea. Firstly, WoW began as a pve game where as MOBAs and FPS's are meant to be played against players. As WoW progressed, it isolated itself from being a pvp game every expansion. Secondly, WoD definitely ruined it. Do you think pvpers will resub to Legion after being basically ignored throughout the entirety of WoD? To this day they are still ignoring us. Two major issues that went on throughout WoD has not been addressed professionally - Faction Balance (the human racial) and Ashran. Blizzard announced pre-WoD that they would balance racials so players would play the race they want, not because they have to. After that statement, they changed every racial except the only one that mattered. Funny eh? Well, keep laughing because they just buffed the horde racials, yes, to try and counter the human one. They could just remove it, as well as any racial from pvp but that is not the case. Finally, Ashran had immense feedback from the player base. There are forum posts everywhere about how to fix it, what they could do, and why it is bad. Yet only recently (yesterday or two days ago) did Holinka finally state he acknowledges ashran as a failure. Before that point, he was praising how it was a success regardless of feedback. 

Sorry for the rant. I do agree with what you say, that WoW needs a competitive e-sport community to be as successful as the other games. I think blizzard is trying with the NA regional tournaments currently happening, but at the same time they don't actually care. ",2015-08-21 20:48:30+00:00,cub3hjl,1,t3_3hvzmo,3307,wow
80,"&gt;Yes it does, it makes it rare and unique so it has more meaning for players who do get it.

More meaning? I have Gold CM sets on 4 characters and the only meaning I get over players who can't obtain it now is that I played in an expansion when they didn't. There is no meaning in that.

&gt;That's the point of rare armor

The point of rare armor should not be limited to what time in your life you got it, but the skill it takes to obtain it.

&gt;That's also the point of a difficulty-gated reward. You can't just ""grind"" it, you have to actually be competent at your class and know how to do the dungeons in order to get it. You can't just faceroll it and/or dump time into it until you get it.

As hard as CM dungeons were, it was a grind. You would constantly reset it until you got all the mechanics correct with your group. I don't think you have ever done gold CMs based off your statement.",2015-08-19 17:31:01+00:00,cu8gyd1,3,t1_cu4qdkx,285147,wow

Tips I would include would be to not rush anything. I know so many people who started their wow experience with friends, and the friends would rush them to max level as fast as possible. This is really bad for two reasons. Firstly, leveling has gotten really easy. Thus when power leveling, you don't get time to learn your abilities and ultimately your class. A lot of 'bad' players really just never had the time to learn how to play because they just hit max level too quickly. Secondly, leveling is an amazing and necessary experience for new wow players.

WW monk - Absolutely horrific in pvp and that is the only reason. Great class design, was a blast to play in MoP! However WW monks and Ele shams are at the bottom of the pvp list in both RBGs and Arenas. I could neither compete nor even play my WW monk in a pvp environment so i rerolled. If this was MoP, I would say monk. No questions asked.

Warrior - Absolutely fantastic dps class. Fury and Arms is both viable in pvp. I can one shot people with cds all the time. Warrior will always be one of the most competitive pvp classes due to sheer damage and pressure. Whenever I get bored of a class, I hop on my warrior because its always a good time

Rogue - Mained rogue this expansion for multiple reasons. I am not sure what you meant by ""wont do well in pvp"". If thats just you with little confidence as a rogue in pvp, ok. But rogues as a class are extremely powerful if played correctly. All 3 dps specs are competitively balanced which has never really happened. However I mained because assassination is a really simple spec, allowing me to focus more on a fight than my rotation. Lastly, there are so many mechanics and annoying things you can skip completely through stealth. Its truly a blessing. Rogue is a quality of life class. I may go back to monk one day if it becomes more fast paced like in MoP.

This is all in a pvp perspective. Im sorry if its not helpful if u pve a lot more. I would say play whatever is most fun because at the end of the day, this is a game.",2015-08-11 08:45:30+00:00,ctyyogf,1,t3_3gk5yc,11053,wow

I am pretty sure the majority of pvpers with conquest gear love smashing faces in battlegrounds through their gear superiority. That is one of the most fun things about casual pvp.

Any difference is a difference. Just cause its a small, people will go after it. The human racial is the perfect example. One trinket caused almost 95% of the high rated pvpers to be alliance. If this ""pvp gear doesnt exist"" aspect goes through, pvpers will have to raid regardless of whatever you said in this video.

3. Racial balance. I forget the stats but around 80 or 90% (something ridiculous) of players who pvp are alliance due to the human racial. Thats it, just change the racial. Not difficult, not complicated.

Because in areas of interest, players had to fight each other for the zone (pvp), not do pve objectives like in ashran over and over again.
