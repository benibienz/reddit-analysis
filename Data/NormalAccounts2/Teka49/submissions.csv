For the last couple months I had a bunch of cysts in one area constantly come up and left pretty bad dark spots. 

Here is my regimen/diet thats working for me. Im 22, had cystic acne since 13. Really oily skin. The goal of this regimen was to combat oil as best as possible. I wash my face with this method twice a day.

1. Wash face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and lukewarm water. Pat face dry.
2. Apply ACV toner ( 1:1 ratio with ACV and Water, use cotton swab over entire face )
3. Wait a bit for the toner to dry, then use Oxy Medicated Pads with 2% salicylic acid over entire face
4. Wait a bit for that to dry, then apply Oxy Deep Pore Vanishing Treatment with 10% BP over entire face.
5. Apply Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion to dry areas.

I take vitamin A, B6. D and Zinc pills in the morning. To be honest I am not sure if these helped since I never noticed a difference after using them. The major difference was when I started using ACV. I cut out dairy, whey protein, greasy foods and foods that are really sugary. I also stopped working out because it seemed to lead to breakouts even when washing face right after.

I read somewhere (still trying to find source) that an extremely small fraction of the WoW population did CM modes. Due to this, Blizzard have passively said that they do not plan to continue it in Legion. This decision is ultimately fine, and makes perfect sense from both a gaming and business perspective. However there is absolutely no reason that the past CM sets should be unobtainable, especially when the current CM weapons work really well with some of them.

The reasoning behind removing the past CM sets was to 'make the players who got it, feel more special and unique'. Gold CM was already limited enough as it was both challenging for the average player and not many players participated in it. The removal only hinders the players who enjoyed the content and wanted to do more. If you ask any person who has done Gold CMs, they could not care less whether other people are able to get it. In fact, that majority of players I ran CMs with were frustrated that it was removed. Many if not all of this player-base would continue doing CMs for the rest of their alts. 

My personal opinion is with the rest of the CM population. As I am getting a little bored with WoW's current state, allowing me to grind out the CM sets for my alts would be a great use of time and fun. I absolutely love the Warrior set from MoP combined with the 2h sword in WoD, but I only had time to do Gold on 4 toons. Therefore, I am not going to even bother doing WoD CMs on my warrior because the beautiful set to match it is unobtainable. This thought process is pretty common with a couple of fellow CM players (the glaive matching Pally set and DK set, maces and Shaman set etc). A couple possibilities would be to just bring MoP CMs back during Legion and scale it down what it was like before, or allow players who earned a Gold challenge mode to simply purchase the other sets at an extremely high gold price. I understand if they want to discontinue making more CM dungeons, but there is no reason to remove more playable content for those who want to play it (especially when there is a lack of content).

Its a cool concept, but every expansion is the same. Can we get one where we just fight each other? It would be pretty difficult making a raid idea for it. Seeing as how we raided Orgrimmar already, lets raid Stormwind? 

They could do a lot with lore in this sort of theme as well.Obviously two hugely big characters up for discussion would be Jaina and Sylvanas since Jaina is apparently angry and missing while Sylvanas is turning into the Lich Queen most likely. Maybe they or two big figures in both factions do something to piss the opposing faction off, and all hell breaks lose. Just a thought.
