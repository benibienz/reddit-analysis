Theme : Resistans gym 

My team:  Resistans Team all of them have at minimum 8 resistances

Ferrothorn: Steel/Grass :He deals with water and ground types

Magnezone : Electric/Steel :He is resistant to 11 types the most of any pokemon 

Empoleon : Water/Steel :Deals with ground and fire types

Metagross : Steel/Psychic :Takes care of the fighting types

Aggron : Steel/Rock :Any Fire type getting cocky he will be waiting

Skarmory Steel/Flying Deals with fighting types

My gym would be located in a  [crater](http://imgur.com/FYQEU0X
) and with the help of Aggron, lairon and aggron's this gym has built giant rock walls around the crater and a huge steel door. The gym has varius steel pokemon wandering around freely. It also has a platform for people to come and see my battles against various challenges. This is for an colosseum like gym meaing it's all about battleing

I would only have 4 gym trainers who are more like admins and no puzzle as soon as you beat my trainers you can challenge me for The Resistans badge

The two Dragons you ""fight"" are just plain boring and are the product of bad design. Also I could never get into the World tendency system but that's just personal preference.

The battle system is better than it's ever been. The story mode is Epic and it was a fun challenge to get S rank. adventure mode is not that fun though.
