If you're using a mage or a pyro build please use the Monlight GS (or any other magic wepon) and pyro's use the Onix blade( or any other pyro wepon). You will never hit a decent player with magic.

The acher giant of the udead setelment has a similar headgear to what the giants of DS1 and looks to be about the same size maybe a little taller and slender but relatively similar sizes. He also holds the hawk ring so it is possible he is a descendant of Gough.
However unlike the Ds1 giants his body seems to be made of stone like the arch trees and the giants of DS2 turned to trees when they died their is even a tree like this in firelink in DS3. The giants of ds2 had souls powerful enough to create a dragon. The dragons ruled when the only thing in the world that existed was gray, artch trees and other stone dragons. Ther seems to be some conection betwen Trees and giants, I think that the origin of the giants can be explained by the arch trees.

The next giants we met in DS3 are the huge chatedral giants. We dont have mutch on these guys as they don't drop anythin worth talking about however something interestin about them is that we can clerly se their hole faces. Interestingly enough visually they look more like the Ds1 giants in structure except the size and the face

Next we fight Yhorm who looks the be about the same size of The Giant lord and ""Yhorm is the descendant of an ancient conqueror"". However Yhorm does not have a hole for a face he has an actual face so what is going on here?

Well i have a theory i think that at one point in time ther might have been multiple sub-species of giants however as time has went on the two sup-species have joind to become one this explains the giants of DS3 haveing traits from both DS1 and DS2 giants 
So what about Yhorm why does he have a face? Well as he linked the fire long ago he is still a giant of the DS1 sub species or another sub species
