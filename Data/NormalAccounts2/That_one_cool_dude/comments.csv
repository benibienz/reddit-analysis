1407,"Ok maybe I can make my argument here and people will actually listen and not just immediately down vote me. So during Superior the entire Marvel Universe took stupid pills because Pete did a complete 180 from what he was known to do or say, IE calling Mary Jane woman and Mary Jane not batting an eye like that was normal, nobody cared what he did until he beat two C or D list villains to a pulp and only then did they do a test to see if he was a skrull. ONE TEST, not bring in a telepathic person to read his mind, which they would have found out immediately if that happened, but nah just see if he is a skrull, and only then did they kick him out of the avengers, which isn't a big deal. Also Wolverine was the only one to make sense in this story when the Avengers were discussing kicking Peter out. And when Wolverine is the only one who is making any sense that isn't a great sign. Plus lets say if Cap and Red Skull switched and it was publicly known that Cap did a 180 there would be an event. Spider-man is the only character where shit like that happens and nothing happens. It ruins the character of Peter because it burns all the bridges he made with the super community, which granted he made them back only because the writers needed it to happen, and he has a company... A COMPANY. Peter is supposed to be a relatable character with relatable issues, but nah give him a company and take away one of his things that has made hims so popular since the 60s.

Fucking they taught us that way and now wonder why we act that way.

Exactly what I said a slap on the wrist and nothing else, sure they kicked him out of the Avengers big woop, no other superhero in New York, which all superheroes are based in Marvel basically, every tried to stop him. The whole point of Peter is supposed to have him be a relate able character, putting as CEO of a company kinda gets rid of that aspect, the best aspect, of his character.

Omega Men: Great art, it is something you expect Image to put out very gritty and dark in it's tone.

Earth 2 Socitey: Earth 2 went down in quality but this first issue picked up where Earth 2 left off in quality great art and writing. 

Constantine: If you liked old John or even started reading him with JLD or the TV show this is a good representation of his old hellblazer book in the mainstream DC line up.

5466,People wise Ed Sheeran is one of my favorite musicians ever he is such a nice and down to earth guy he is even up there music wise for me. Him and Dave Grohl are probably my favorite people outside of the music stuff they are both just real guys who are super nice and love to rock out and make good music. ,2015-06-16 15:49:04+00:00,cs8g9vx,1.0,t3_39z5rx,58137.0,Music
