This is where you come in and help me out. You can be that cool woman who does not take herself to seriously and is intelligent enough to keep a conversation going. Is that too much to ask?

So about me in a short paragraph. I live in Maryland, love the terps,ravens and orioles. Crabcakes are my favorite food on earth. If you don't know what a crabcake is then come on down to Baltimore Hun. I wonder why there are so many Alaskan reality shows. I love 90's to early 2000's music. Also I am not ashamed to say if nsync gets back together I am going to go see them. Oh and I feel like a apple.

So if you think you can talk on kik for more then 4 days I hope to hear from you. Laughsandgoodbeer is my kik",Kikpals,34[M4F]- laughter + great conversation is how the kik curse is broken. Let's try,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kikpals/comments/4n6twj/34m4f_laughter_great_conversation_is_how_the_kik/

I probably went from having 20-25 close friends to now having maybe 4-5. That is where this post comes in. It seems to be it is easier to get deeper with online friends because you have that safety of not seeing them. Hopefully you understand that.
So that is what I am looking to find some friends on here that don't flake. Just please be able to hold a conversation and have stuff your passionate about. For a lot of people here it seems to be sci Fi and gaming. I am not into those but if you are that is cool. I don't care about your age or relationship status either. Just have a sense of humor and lets chat.",Needafriend,33/m/us- sometimes online friends can be better then real life ones,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/43e6bh/33mus_sometimes_online_friends_can_be_better_then/
