9,"""Ajayi couldn't do anything when Foster was sidelined the last few weeks""? 

Out of those 3 weeks, he was given more than 7 carries only once - out of those 3 games he averaged 4.2YPC and logged 2 TD's - hardly a bad performance. 

What people are blinded by is a small sample size and the fact that even the games where Ajayi has been the listed ""Starter"" of the game, they have given him virtually no chances to get a run game going..Finally they give him a proper amount of carries and BOOM he goes off for 200yds. 

I'm not one to say he is the truth after 1 breakout performance, but based on his previous efforts the guy has talent and if given the chance can make big plays happen. If you have the chance to buy low on him or pick him up off waivers(If your league is really that slow) DO IT! ",2016-10-18 14:09:48+00:00,d8x7gre,5,t1_d8vqb4a,85335,fantasyfootball
