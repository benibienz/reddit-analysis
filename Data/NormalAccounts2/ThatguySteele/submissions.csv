I got a character to 70, then did my season journey chapter 1. I was told this gives me 2 set items when completed. 

When i joined my next game i saw a little mail icon in the bottom left; it showed something about Malthael's wings but nothing about set items..in either case, I clicked claim reward and it just closed the menu. Nothing appeared in my inventory or my stash - is there somewhere else i need to look? 

Any help is appreciated, thanks!",Diablo,"No season reward after clicking ""Claim reward""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/5dheok/no_season_reward_after_clicking_claim_reward/

Clearly fitzy has shown that he's still got gas left in the tank, but can he keep this yardage/td's up for another week? I feel like Marshall is due for a td but his matchup isn't the best? Meanwhile fitz has a much better matchup with Buffalo.

Since i'm pretty skinny at RB I thought it may be worth it to make a play for him. I have posted my lineup below, let me know your best trade ideas; my initial thoughts are Brandon Marshall/Jeremy Hill but is that enough? 

QB - Aaron Rodgers
RB - Jeremy hill
RB - Jeremy Langford
WR - Julio Jones
WR - Brandon Marshall
TE - Julius Thomas
WR/RB/TE(Flex) - DeAngelo Williams

Bench:

Kelvin Benjamin
LeGarrett Blount
Alfred Morris
Larry Fitzgerald
Will Fuller
Martellus Bennett 

As you can see, i have a lot of depth at WR so i'm thinking I can let go of virtually any one of my WR's and still end up on top when I get Bell.

I just realized we have beer/social leagues for almost all sports - baseball, football, hockey, soccer, hell even Dodgeball. Why hasn't this translated to Esports? 

I love the team aspect of LoL and would go nuts if there was a way to play competitively at lower elo. Obviously there is no sponsorships or big money to be won, but I think this could really catch on in communities with a large concentration of League players. 

What do you guys think? Am I being crazy or is this a viable idea?  ",leagueoflegends,LoL Beer league?,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4x4pga/lol_beer_league/
