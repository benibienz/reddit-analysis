People similar to me feel the US is very often involved in immoral/illegal stuff, but my guess is most others don't think or learn about it too much. After the jingoistic shitnado that accompanied the buildup to the Iraq war, I don't think accosting people of being unpatriotic for being critical of America carries as much weight as it used too. You can call me anti-American until the cows come home and I couldn't care less. In fact if anything I view patriotism as sort of a diagnosable mental deficiency.

It wasn't this image though, it was a two dimensional side profile of an old man with a smile sitting in a jar. And there were very loud noises I can't really describe, sort of a loud screeching. I don't think they were recognizable, just the absolute loudest and most terrifying noises my 6 year old brain could imagine. And sort of like the gif it would cut into a close imagine of the old man's face. And each time it did the screeching would get louder and louder. 

It probably doesn't sound that scary, but if you're familiar with nightmares you know how nightmare logic works.
