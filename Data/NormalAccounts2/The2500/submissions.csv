I admired the banquet set before us. Roast deer with a side of gravy with a giant platter of mashed potatoes in the center of the table.

Please note that if you come across any bad writing while reading this, it's most likely due to the fact that I am a bad writer.

The day started like any other. I woke up in my one bedroom downtown apartment, sun shining through the windows. I took a shower and through on jeans and a t-shirt. It was my day off from work, so I was going to walk down to Target to do some grocery shopping. As I grab my phone, wallet and keys, Monster Truck (my cat) starts meowing and runs to the door. He knows this means I'm leaving. He splays himself on the floor and I rub his belly, then walk out and lock the door. Down the elevator and to the lobby, I walk out the door and am quite surprised by the sight that greeted me.

It was now overcast, and a thin sprinkling of snow dusted the city. This is very unusual for this time of year in the north west of the US. I pull out my phone to check the weather, after failing to recognize my finger print three times and making input the pattern I come to find I've no signal. Of course. 

As I hoof down to Target I notice a few other things. The city is desolate, no cars and not another person to be seen. When I got to the commercial district all the signs for business look to have been torn down, the buildings decrepit. Was there some kind of mass exodus I wasn't informed of? 

About five minutes down the road I come to a convenience store. I peer through the window bars, it looks to have been abandoned months ago. Even the stands you'd normally find in a convenience store were gone, the only fixture was a dilapidated wooden counter. I decided to see if I could get in, maybe find some sort of clue as to what was going on. The door opens, and this is where things start to get awful. I hop over the counter, and as I recover from my bound I find a massive sickly green spider, the size of a dinner plate sitting on the wall. I recoil in horror and as I slam my back against the counter I see there are multiple smaller spiders sitting on the wall as well. Not only that, there was now a greasy green/brown film smearing the walls that wasn't there before. I spin around to make my escape and see a number if impossibly large spiders, abdomens the size of footballs. In the upper left corner resting on a web is a spindly one the size of a German shepherd. As if fear absolute terror and confusion hadn't gripped me enough, on the floor in the right corner was the worse to come. This was a spider not only the size of a man, but one that appeared to have been sown together almost entirely from human body parts. Four bloody arms connected to a massive puss leaking abdomen, two huge segmented eyes staring at me above the upper half of a human jaw. It begins to scuttle towards me and I leap over the counter and towards the door, noting the film now smeared the windows with minimal light pouring through. In the back of my mind, given the horror of the situation I knew what was going to happen. The door was going to be jammed or locked from the outside. To my surprise and relief the door opened with no resistance, releasing me into the crisp air of the city streets.

The city is as it was before, only now the sun was setting in the distance. This despite it being 10:00 AM. With no other options, I head back to my apartment building in hopes that going back in will somehow set everything back to normal. However, when I return to my modern downtown complex I see that the building has been replaced with an old Victorian townhouse. Dreading going indoors again but seeing no other recourse, I turn the handle and step inside.

It is now pitch black outside. Unlike the rest of the city, the inside of this building is pristine, well maintained. On the right where the office should have been there is a decorative counter with a key rack behind it, as if this were an old fashioned hotel. The elevator was in the right place but was replaced with a lift with a manual opening gate. My apartment is on the fifth floor and this building only had two, but what else could I try? I take the lift to the second floor. 

I step out of the lift and begin heading down the hall. As I'm walking I'm startled by loud crash and two sustained screeching wails. A door has been flung open and a humanoid creature lumbered into the hallway, between me and the elevator. This creature is difficult to describe but I'll try. It's shape was like conjoined twins connected at the torso. Instead of skin however it had a series of flesh colored tentacles wrapping around themselves to form the humanoid shape, with blooding oozing out between them. The heads didn't have eyes or ears, but they had mouths with human teeth. The one on the left looked slightly shorter, almost more feminine. Paralyzed with fear I watched as it clumsily stumbled towards me. The female side crashed into an end table with a vase smashing it into her and she began to wail in agony. After a few second she turned hear head towards the male and extended a long tongue. She sensually lapped blood from the males neck while he slowly leaned his head upward as though on the verge of an orgasm. Finally I got a grip and turned tail down the hall.

I came to a stairwell and descended as fast as I could. I got to the first floor and saw there were more stairs, but no entry to the main lobby. I figured my best bet would be to put as much distance between me and the creature as I could, so I descended the stairs to the bottom. Down five more floors. 

The stairs ended with an opening to a large room made entirely of rusted metal. In the center was a ramp indenting into the floor that didn't go anywhere. Just beyond that was a door with a placard reading ""508.""

My apartment.

A ran towards it fumbling with my keys, but when I got there the key wouldn't turn. Maybe I should have grabbed a key from the lobby. After a few moments I hear crashing, thumping, and screeching coming from above and rapidly approaching. It seems the creature wasn't negotiating the stairs very well. Finally it tumbles off the stairs and into the room, heads screeching in pain as it picks itself up, bloodier than ever. After it gets up the male bites into the females neck and rips a chunk of flesh out, causing her to screech even louder.

It's then I surprised myself and did something I didn't think I could. I charged towards the creature and pummeled it to the ground, then started beating the shit out of it. I took turns punching each head, blood and teeth flying everywhere, accompanied by ear piercing shrieks. Suddenly, the blade of a sword thrusts straight up from the creature just missing the side of my head. I jump back and watching as creature stand up and gets bisected down the middle by the sword. When it's over, standing between the two halves is a boy who looked to be 8 years old, dressed in very nice, though bloody, old fashioned garbs, and a sword. He looks at me an nonchalantly says ""thank you."" He takes a key from his pocket and unlocks my apartment, then ascends the stairs. 

I'm greeted by warmth and sunlight as I step into my apartment, as well as greeted by Monster Truck. Outside the city is back to normal, bustling with people and traffic. I'm at my computer writing this to you now. Does anyone have any idea what the fuck just happened? I don't know what will happen if I go outside again, but I can't stay here forever.

I still don't have any groceries.
