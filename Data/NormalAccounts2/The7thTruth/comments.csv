1,"Vigor always helps. Endurance so you can run/attack more. You don't really need that much Vitality unless you plan on using heavy armor for fashion or whatever. Strength is obvious, and maybe Dexterity if the weapon you want requires it. Adaptability is good for the agility, but you're probably better off investing elsewhere early on. 

I'd recommend going light armor with Vigor, Stamina, and Strength until you feel that you should invest elsewhere. ",2016-05-04 17:21:55+00:00,d2snw7a,1,t3_4hvbxw,2589,DarkSouls2

15,"I was raised creationist. When I asked similar questions, I was generally told A.) Neanderthals were just monkeys, B.) They were oddly shaped humans, C.) They are falsified evidence made by Satan worshipers/scientists/atheists/gays to confuse Christians, or lastly D.) Neanderthals and other species were the result of fallen angels breeding with human women. 

I found this last answer the most intriguing. I'll try to find the exact verse and edit in a citation later, but the jist of it said that fallen angels came to earth and took human wives. As it was explained to me, their children later became the legends of old (Heracules and Achilles come first to mind, but creationists referenced just about any legendary figure of the past). I thought this was a truly fascinating bit of mythology and am still surprised that isn't more popular.

Convince the players that G has been mapping out portals that lead to the source of E's power. G(and the players) must activate a bunch of alters or some shit in order to defeat E. If they can help G complete these quests, they can conquer E together.

84,"I personally would recommend Scott Robertson's tutorials on YouTube. He emphasizes using pens over pencil (as they help you learn faster). Alphonso Dunn is another fantastic reference. He has a channel full of tutorials on Youtube.

Supplies: A ballpoint pen and paper are all you need to get started. I can't say about pencils, but pens are really simple. Ballpoints are the best to start with, then move to felt tips. As for paper, its mostly personal preference. Thick is more absorbent and allows for lighter lines, while thin paper requires almost no pressure to get bold lines. 

To start, I'd recommend getting basic muscle memory down (practice straight lines, arcs, circles, ellipses, etc). Once you feel comfortable with that, try 1 and 2 point perspective exercises. 

This should get you started, but don't forget to have fun. After you've done some exercise, just try drawing whatever interests you. For me, I really like knights, so I drew armor and helmets all the time. At first they sucked, but gradually got better after daily practice.",2015-10-12 01:36:10+00:00,cvwglav,1,t3_3odz1a,7432,sketchpad
85,"Crystallion's *Hundred Days* album is entirely dedicated to Napoleon Bonaparte's return to France (One of my all time favorite albums). Their other album, *Hattin*, is dedicated to the Crusades.

There's Nostradameus' *Words of Nostradameus* album (Another favorite). 

You've already got them, but Iron Maiden is full of history songs. Manowar has quite a few history related songs, if not directly dedicated (Notably *Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts* and *Spirit Horse of the Cherokee*)

Will add more later if I remember them. Hopefully someone else will add more. Oh, and there's always viking metal. Tyr is probably one of the more ""historical"" bands.

Edit: Iron Mask's *Hordes of the Brave* album has a number of history songs (maybe the whole album). Notable: *Holy War*, *Freedom's Blood*, *Alexander the Great*",2015-10-12 00:32:19+00:00,cvwehnv,1,t3_3oe18c,2516,PowerMetal

I was going to go with my second case, but unfortunately it was out of stock and the next merchant was $20 more, so I kept my original (It's a bit big, but at least I have space to upgrade later). 

My father (used to build computers) was adamantly against me getting a refurbished graphics card, so I took his advice and got a different one, for better or worse. He also advised not skimping on a PSU, so I went with a much better one. 

Here's everything I got if you're interested. Not sure if it's the best, but I'm happy with it as my first build (all in all came to ~$670 with rebates). Thanks again for your help.

90,"Thanks for the recommendations. 

That motherboard looks much better, so I will definitely be going with that one. 

I'm not overly fond of your case (not that it's bad, just personal preference), is there any particular reason not to go with mine (or maybe [this one](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/thermaltake-case-ca1b300m1nn00) )?

I must have overlooked that PSU, looks quite nice.

~~It appears my college offers windows 8.1 for free (yay!). That frees up quite a bit of cash, anywhere in particular you'd recommend putting it?~~

92,"Not an expert on lore, but I think of the Embedded One as a guardian of the singer. The Key says that he was once human, so I think that he may have been one of Vendrick's knights who sacrificed himself to protect her. I think that she was brought to the cage to keep her safe, away from the hollows or what have you. If Vendrick realized what was happening before he went to the Crypt, he may have locked her up in the tower as a means of safe keeping and to keep away Nashandra. Perhaps the ring she carries was seen as having some importance.",2015-09-30 15:53:30+00:00,cvjdz3i,1,t3_3mxw2c,28491,DarkSouls2
93,"I had the same trouble with one of my professors just recently. From my experience, I'd recommend emailing him directly and explaining your situation. Hopefully he'll be understanding, but if not, contact the department head / dean and let them know about the situation. Most school policies prevent you from being forced to show up early to class, so he may be on thin ice for demanding so. 

If anything, try switching to a class at a different time. This should be a last resort though. Also, if you're on friendly terms with another professor, notify them about the situation and they may stick up for you. They'll have far more sway with the department head /  dean than you.",2015-09-24 19:52:13+00:00,cvcxn9b,1,t3_3m7cvh,18637,college

104,"Short answer: Yes, he meant well for the **German** people. 

Long answer: Hitler believed in a very specific utopian society based around the German people and the utilization of their neighbors. This belief held that the Aryan race (basically Germans) were genetically superior to all other races (these ideas were originally British in origin, but were adopted by some Germans as well). With this idea of racial superiority, Hitler sought to establish this dominance over all the inferior races. Some races (Anglo-Saxons mainly) were not seen as inferior however, but as allies to the Aryans. Unfortunately, in order to achieve this dream utopia, Hitler ordered the execution of all the terrible acts that media and mediocre history teachers have brainwashed most of us with. 

EDIT: For the others who claim it all was a mental disorder. No, it was not. Hitler got to power through tact, force, and genius. He did start to lose it when the weight of everything fell on him when the Soviets invaded Berlin, obviously. Only a truly crazy man could have stayed sane after watching his life's work and dreams collapse around him. If you still doubt, read his book; he wrote it all down for everyone. His plans were very clear.",2015-06-27 21:08:32+00:00,csktd47,1,t3_3bc4tz,2262,AskHistory
