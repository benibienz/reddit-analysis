First, load up to the Bonfire located at Foot of the High Wall (right where the goblins drop you off after lifting the Banner).

Essentially, the main goal of the game is to have control of the Bonfire sitting at the top of the stairs. We only tried with two people, but if you have a group you might have a lot more fun. Either summon some friendly phantoms or enemy Dark Spirits for team battles, or go Mound for FFA.

Once everyone's ready, it's basically just a fight to be the last man/team standing, the winner of each round should wear Wolnir's Crown for extra fun.

Liquid warmth oozed around his body. What had wakened him he wondered. Something had shaken him . . . yes, that was it. But sleep was quickly drawing itself back over him. As he was about to drift into the void once again, a new feeling swept over him. He felt his limbs cramped up against him and his tail curled unseemly. He tried to readjust himself, but he found himself unable to; stopped by a wall of some kind. He pushed against it, but to no avail. Angered, he tried again and this time he could feel the wall cracking, his small talons were just able to dig into it. He began to push with his snout as well, using the larger muscles in his neck. Again, he could feel the wall giving way. 

Suddenly, a jolt rocked his tiny world. Fear paralyzed him. Again and again he could feel his cage being shaken. Noises. Yes, he could hear faint sounds outside. Perhaps animals of some kind, but he couldn’t tell. The sounds seemed to have a certain pattern to them. As he began listening more carefully, the creatures’ sounds grew louder and more frantic. Finally, a much louder, more terrifying, noise vibrated through to him. He knew that sound. It was the sound of a dragon. 

More jolts. He felt an urgency now. He had to break through the accursed trap. As he continued to be shaken, he found it difficult to concentrate. The jolts became more regular, however.  A quick rising and falling. 

He pushed again and his talons broke through. Encouraged, he pushed with his snout and managed to break through even farther. He could feel the shell breaking. He pried open a large gap and was blinded by the sudden light. When his eyes adjusted, he continued to claw an escape. 

Pulling his head out, he observed his surroundings. What he saw was just as bewildering as what he had been hearing while in the egg. Large rocks lay on every side, sloping upwards and downwards like sharp teeth. Trees grew here and there, but only sparsely. He quickly found the source of the shaking. His egg lay atop several others in a large, wicker basket. He could see some of his siblings attempting to break out of their eggs as well. The source of the shaking he had experienced was much stranger though. A brown haired creature was carrying them hurriedly down twisting trails, breathing heavily and running unsurely. He struggled to free himself and get a better view. 

Suddenly the brown haired creature gave a short yelp and they all tumbled downwards. Free from his egg, the hatchling managed to jump away and land unceremoniously on the hot gravel. The small rocks hurt his smooth skin as his scales had not yet developed. Shaking his head, he turned to find the creature and the eggs.

Several feet down the path, the creature lay panting. It had four limbs, but only seemed to walk on two. Nearly its entire body was covered with a strange mixture of loose fitting materials. But the basket was empty. Not an arm’s length away from the creature, the ground dropped in a sudden cliff. He noticed several egg fragments and trails of embryo leading to its edge. 

A fury overtook him. An overwhelming desire to kill this villainous creature that had sent his siblings to their certain death. He began to run forward, at first awkwardly, but his instincts quickly took control. At the sound of his rapid approach, the creature turned and saw him and fear filled its eyes. The creature began to reach for something near its waistline, but was too slow. He lunged and sunk his teeth into the thing’s throat as his talons clawed out its eyes. Through the haze of his rage, he could hear the creature scream and could feel it die in his grip.

Soon, the creature went still. He let go and after a final hiss, climbed over the corpse to look down at the carnage below. Several hundred feet below, the rocks were stained in red, orange, and yellow liquids. Small corpses could be seen from his vantage point, but none moved. He sat staring at the scene for some moments, feeling lifeless.
Another roar filled the air. Grasping his senses, he noticed the terrible sounds coming from higher up the rocks. He could hear more of the accursed creatures yelling. But also the sounds of a creature much larger: a dragon. Quickly, he turned and scampered up the jutting rocks from whence he had been carried.

After several moments, he climbed over the final outcropping and found a terrible sight. Dozens of the creatures lay dead on the ground, but many still stood surrounding a giant, bronze dragon. Blood was splattered across its large, shimmering scales. Its large muscles strained against chains and ropes strapped across it. Long poles of wood and metal jutted out in many places, wedged in gaps the scales did not protect. 

Before he could act, one of the creatures charged forward and pierced the great dragon below its jaw with a long, winged spear. At its thrust, the great dragon gave a final roar and breathed its last. Its great head fell dully to the earth. 

The murderous creatures gave a victorious yell, but the victory was short lived. Just as he charged for the nearest, the killing rage filling him once more, another dragon, this one slightly smaller than the other, but similarly colored with the slight difference that its scales shimmered a subtle blue, landed amongst the creatures in a storm of fire. The survivors scattered and attempted to flee, but were gored and slain in a vicious revenge. He did not leave the slaughter to the dragon alone, however. Fueled by his rage, he killed four more of the creatures as they fled or attempted to fight a last.

Darkness began to fall when the killing was over. A few distant stars twinkled innocently high above him. Exhausted, he returned to the clearing where the bronze dragon lay dead. There, he found the other dragon waiting for him. A voice filled his head, feminine and filled with mourning.

*The dragon there was your father, hatchling. His name was Aedraenor. The most fearsome dragon these lands have ever seen. 
Murdered by cowards of the lowest order.* 

He gazed at the massive corpse as she spoke in his mind. Scars crisscrossed nearly every inch of Aedraenor’s head, limbs, and belly. Two mighty horns sprouted from the back of his jaw, above his torn frills. These horns were scraped and battered from years of use, blood from today still stained them. His father’s great wings were spread out to either side, each as nearly as long as the dragon’s entire body. These too were marked by years of battle, tears and rips were scattered across the thin, tattered skin. 

*You honored him well today. Did any of your siblings survive as well?*

Not sure how to respond in kind, he simply thought “negative” over and over in his mind. She seemed to understand him.

*Very well. You will learn to speak with your thoughts proficiently soon enough. I am your mother, Khyelaenor. The creatures you’ve seen today are called ‘men’. Many of our kind have reason to hate them, but it is unfortunate that you must learn this so quickly. Our lair is farther up the mountain. I doubt any others will dare return for some time, but we will watch over your father’s body to ensure its purity. It is tradition that a dragon’s bones be left where he died, to commemorate his final moments. The many bones of the slain will lay here in testament.* 

*You will be called Aetyrdorn, for you are fearless and brave.*
