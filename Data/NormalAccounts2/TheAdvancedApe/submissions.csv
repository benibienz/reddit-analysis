(I still am, to a much lesser extent.) So when I saw my favorite band on one of my favorite shows, Mr. Rogers, I was ecstatic. I was so excited I told everyone I knew about it and asked if others had seen it. A few had. I was about 6, which makes that 1982, shortly before the make-up came off. 
In the episod Mr. Rogers visits the local concert arena to show how a big popular music performance was set up. It was all filmed backstage, mostly with stagehands. But I do believe that Paul and maybe Gene may have spoken briefly with Fred.
Years later, when the internet became a thing with everything on it, I tried to find the episode. Since then, I have not even been able to find a passing mention of it.
Does anyone else remember this episode?
Or was it just a product of my dreams or imagination?

Before I wrote this, I decided to look again. Still nothing. But I was reminded of another mystery that plagued me. As a kid I used to wear these tshirts that were 'Rad Dog'. It was a generic skateboard apparel brand available at box stores. I could not find any proof of its existence on the web until, just having remembered to check old mysteries, did find an allusion to Rad Dog via some band who made a Rad Dog inspired shirt. So perhaps Mr. rogers and KISS will eventually show up.",MandelaEffect,Mr. Rogers meets KISS,http://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/3ba4du/mr_rogers_meets_kiss/
