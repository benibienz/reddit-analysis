0,What resources and advice would you give to an aspiring Fantasy author?,2016-11-15 00:19:42+00:00,da0kn1j,1,t3_5czenp,552,books
1,"I ended up following the purple galactic waypoint path. At the end of the first stretch I came to a system that had a special something in space. (I am intentionally being vague so I don't spoil anything.) 

After leaving that ""something"" I got another stretch of jumps added to the Waypoint path. The first jump showed me another anomaly that I investigated, which is where I found the Atlas Pass v1.

I don't know if the Path is the same for everyone but if you encounter these anomalies elsewhere, you should recognize both just by how they stand out as something new.",2016-08-10 23:03:49+00:00,d6chtht,1,t3_4x4x93,647,NoMansSkyTheGame
2,"To be fair, I subscribed to this subreddit when it had around 17-20k subscribers... I still don't have very many posts because I never had anything new and productive to add. I mainly read everything to keep updated and that is all.",2016-07-24 20:39:18+00:00,d5p46am,3,t1_d5owmoo,12029,NoMansSkyTheGame
3,"I am willing to admit that when I came back to this Sub once NMS went gold, I didnt notice the Archive and Repository until a couple days later. First thing I noticed was the massive topic shown in the picture.",2016-07-12 23:31:38+00:00,d59w7yg,3,t1_d59hrwu,19417,NoMansSkyTheGame
4,"I am the same way... I can honestly see myself playing this game regularly for at least a year, probably longer. I am fascinated by space and exploring other worlds and considering the sheer size of the game, there is always something new to find just around the corner.",2016-07-11 00:38:39+00:00,d57aajr,1,t3_4s856f,1970,NoMansSkyTheGame
5,"I am fairly certain that there might be difference in software on disc and on console (or PC) between regions. I remember hearing that discs bought from Region 2 will not play in Region 1, Region 3 wont play in 2, etc.

With that in mind it stands to reason that there might be a bug in Region 3 that doesn't appear in Regions 1 and 2.",2016-07-10 23:13:12+00:00,d577dif,5,t1_d574wdj,4092,NoMansSkyTheGame
6,"Sorry about that, I was trying to avoid confusion over posting something old enough to have been discussed a few times already. I don't see a way to edit the title to try to make it clearer either.",2016-07-10 06:47:00+00:00,d56fbyv,2,t1_d56946t,13050,NoMansSkyTheGame
7,"Study, read and play X2: The Threat to get my space game fix while I wait.",2016-07-10 05:18:09+00:00,d56d6oo,1,t3_4s3ma6,9239,NoMansSkyTheGame
8,"This is true, yet I find myself half hoping, half afraid that there is a predator big enough to kill it. It would be interesting to see and discover... until it notices me.",2016-07-10 04:10:30+00:00,d56b32y,2,t1_d56agyx,1111,NoMansSkyTheGame
9,"If i get spiders and you get snakes, I will gladly trade you. I hate spiders.",2016-07-10 03:18:45+00:00,d569ex4,2,t1_d565trq,6586,NoMansSkyTheGame
10,"After rewatching the video, a purple rhino did indeed come charging in, it stopped right on the other side of the ship and does not actually attack the creature I pictured before the ship took off.",2016-07-10 01:24:23+00:00,d565okh,3,t1_d5657oy,868,NoMansSkyTheGame
11,"So this creature appears to be one that eats the leaves from tree tops... and going from what I know about ecosystems, there should be a big bad predator at the top of the food chain.... so what is killing and eating something that big?",2016-07-10 01:07:21+00:00,d5654n3,1,t3_4s38wp,126,NoMansSkyTheGame
12,"To prevent war, the universe is in Sean Murray's hand. (that was my pathetic attempt at a MIB throwback but somehow it works perfectly)",2016-07-09 03:35:02+00:00,d555wjb,1,t3_4rqk0n,114143,NoMansSkyTheGame
13,"Correct, uploading to the Atlas at a beacon (I think) pays you in the game, the way your first post sounded, I thought you said that I wouldnt get paid until I went online",2016-07-09 03:30:48+00:00,d555rwb,4,t1_d555d7z,795,NoMansSkyTheGame
14,I always assumed the game paid you for your discoveries depending on rarity and type and then it updated their server for the other players with all of your discoveries next time you went online,2016-07-09 03:15:37+00:00,d555b1p,2,t1_d554vmn,822,NoMansSkyTheGame
15,"I have always loved dragons in general, so I really hope to find one in NMS some day. Based on what we know, the more dangerous things should be towards the center of the galaxy.",2016-07-09 01:03:15+00:00,d550y9u,2,t1_d550q4o,399,NoMansSkyTheGame
16,"That wont be a problem... between exploring, mining, trading and the frequent space battles... I doubt I will WANT to go to the center of the galaxy within the first year or 2.",2015-06-25 20:56:25+00:00,csioc5h,1,t3_3b3v4g,5739,NoMansSkyTheGame
17,"The Elder Scrolls Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, Fallout 3 and The Witcher 3 to name a few. I tend to play one game for a week or so then switch to a different game. When I feel like I need some frustrating punishment I will go for Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne though I havent needed that since E3 because I have been getting plenty of frustration while reloading this sub and each and every time, seeing that there is no release date yet. :(",2015-06-25 04:06:18+00:00,cshwecd,1,t3_3b0y8a,6587,NoMansSkyTheGame
18,"I want to take this a step further... Gas giants are, well... gas! So will we be able to successfully fly into them and back out? Perhaps by doing so, we can collect certain resources from the atmosphere of the planet (Methane, Helium, etc.) What does a planet such as Jupiter look like from the inside? 

Edit: just saw the post above mine. I feel that it is unfortunate that gas giants will not appear in the game because of the possibilities I listed above, and I am sure there are other things I didn't think of regarding the subject.",2015-06-24 03:03:19+00:00,csgo72v,1,t3_3awpc6,829,NoMansSkyTheGame
19,Hopefully they release the physical copy at the same time as the downloadable copy.,2015-06-22 00:39:30+00:00,csealiv,2,t1_cse8ihe,4509,NoMansSkyTheGame
