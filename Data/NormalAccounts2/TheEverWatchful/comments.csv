I am also thinking of a platform where personalized feeds can be shared. 
Say you are passionate about energy policy and have over time created a reliable RSS feed. I can 'peep' to see what is happening on Energy without having to create my own RSS on energy. If I on my side cares for Indian medicine, you can 'peep' through my feed for a reliable feed on that.

7,"I think social stability and security abhors centralization. Distributed systems survive much more better than centralized ones. 

What we are increasingly seeing in privately centralized systems is standardization and limited diversity. Production systems for food, knowledge, beliefs, transport, security, tools...name them, move into fewer and fewer hands through acquisitions and eclipsing from advertisement campaigns. Society is more dependent on them yet they are independent of society at the power level. 

The result of this is reduced quality of products threatening survival of society. This may not be observed immediately but in the long run, the health and competitiveness of a society is greatly hampered when diversity is limited or purged out wholly. 

What Facebook, Apple, Silicon Valley, Hollywood, Front Page, Newsfeed, Pfizer, Monsanto, Coca Cola, The US, Unilever, Starbucks etc create are centres of influence that transform production away from need-fixing to power-production. 

I guess that is why despite there being enough water in the world to sustain the world, more people have to buy from big corporations substandard drinks yet if they were more diversified, they could just make use of milliard ways to get clean free water for household use.

30,"&gt; But once in a while, the government may adopt policies that may not benefit the population. That sort of poor decision happens everywhere, including in the USA- where some of the trade agreements led to the lose of American jobs. However, in the case of poor countries like Ethiopia, these mistakes are magnified and used for political purposes by some demagogues who live in a country far far away.

The problem with this statement is the comparison you are building - that even those others do it. We cannot build our societies like this because tomorrow some demagogue somewhere will say 'Even Ethiopia shuts down the Internet'...and this cycle goes on and on. 

I think this repeated conscious decision to shut off the WHOLE population from the Internet is unacceptable. This is not a mistake. This is a repeated conscious decision and much as I think Ethiopia is doing well economically - as expected - I think you can never equate economic growth with social development. What these kind of actiosn reflect from a TPLF led government that won 100% of the seats is that the economic growth is having less and less effect on the citizens. 

Two, in those othr countries you mentioned, citizens fight like hell against those mistakes from the elite. Trump for example has received his share of love and hate but even those who support him feel he has issue to deal with to ensure civil liberties. So is Hillary.
