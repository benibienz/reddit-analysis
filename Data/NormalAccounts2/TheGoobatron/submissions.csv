Towards the end of the first half of Sunday's game, Lovie chose to run the clock out with 3 timeouts left rather than try to drive up the field and get a field goal/touchdown.

Do you guys think that was a good or bad idea?
Maybe Lovie was worried that a turnover before the half would kill the team's momentum?

Please try not to turn this into a ""fire Lovie"" thread. I just want to hear what y'all think of Lovie's clock management skills.
