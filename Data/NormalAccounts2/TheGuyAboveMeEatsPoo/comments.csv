This all started with the FBIanon and the podesta Wikileaks. 

Here prior to the election gearing up there was a supposed FBIanon that posted of things to come. The dude has been proven to be prophetic. He called out everything in regards to clinton, and he told us to dig on the clinton foundation. 

The Chans and various subreddits rifled through all the podesta emails and discovered that the dude was absolutely obsessed with pizza. This elitist with a personal chef that can dine on fine foods just routinely has bizarre convos about pizza that make no sense. So one day a translator of sorts is posted on the chans. People start filling it in, and it just absolutely made sense that it was a pedo ring. 

So then the digging begins. People just found countless connections for bribery and known pedophiles who were connected through the clinton foundation. 

For example, bill clinton took 20 unescorted trips with a known pedophile to ""sex island."" This pedophile has been accused of setting up satanic rape parties for rich people. Aka spirit cooking.

112,"There are more casual ways to identify shills. 

The easiest is that the age of their account. If its new and only making posts about a particular topic, they're likely a shill. 

If they're extremely dismissive, derisive, etc, they're likely a shill. 

If they follow what seems like a ""script"" you've seen or heard before, and seem like they don't necessarily know what they're saying, but just repeating it. They typically have a couple of 3 or so sources, but they can't/won't delve into specifics of them. 

The real concern is when they get onto mod lists. The change is usually pretty stark to what the community was prior. If you pay attention and get a feel for organic sub posts, you can pick out stuff that seems out of place. 

Take r/the_donald for example, we were fairly at peace with bernie bros, but we've had several days of bashing them. We've also been very narrowly focused on fake news. We also suddenly dropped all things wikileaks. 

Also, suspicious and selective enforcement of sub rules accompanied by extreme punishment. E.g. a permaban for a relatively innocuous comment. 

edit: One of my favorites is when a shill has just been given a source, but hasn't bothered to read it. So they'll say something like, ""OH this article here proves X."" Then when you read the article, the article will literally have a sentence that says, ""X is not true."" Then you point that out, only to hear radio silence.

Assange is likely dead. He either killed himself during the raid or was shot flat out. Since he's dead, they can't fully co-opt Wikileaks. Hence the dead man's switch and the DDOS to suppress it.

Heres how you get them. You refuse to tell the states who is of interest. Then every month or so you collect their arrest records etc and see if they caught any illegal aliens wanted by the fed. If they did and let them go, bam penalty. If not, great. 

When you do it in this manner, the [insert state body] will be forced to report *every* illegal detained, lest they face penalty.

540,"The long and short of it is that Hillary Clinton kept a private server and email address which she did official government business. The purpose of which was to circumvent FOIA requests. FOIA requests are essentially a method in which people can demand any and all information that isn't classified, etc.

When it was discovered that Hillary had a private email server, congress subpoenaed her for said server as it contained govt property. 

She/her aides summarily went through the e-mails and decided what was or was not official record. 

The problem here is that we're taking her at her word that was the entirety of her govt dealings. 

Then it was obviously discovered that she had transmitted and stored classified information on this insecure server of hers, and had lied about it. 

So, to most it appears that she got slapped with a subpoena, then went on to destroy evidence, and then was caught in the act. 

So, it was abundantly clear that multiple crimes were committed. Only for her to be let off for the fact that she is a clinton. ",2016-11-07 01:16:09+00:00,d9oxq91,1.0,t3_5bjbie,645.0,The_Donald

Just a recap, that WIKILeaks and the Veritas have forced the resignation of numerous democrats, as you maintain are fake or maliciously edited video. 

Theres an old saying in Journalism that you know you're A-ok if they're attacking you, but if they call you a liar and threaten to sue, you had better circle the wagons.

I mean, its so simple, really. 

All Podesta and Clinton has to do is release their emails and prove WIKILeaks fraudulent. 

Well, I mean Hillary can't because she deleted several tens of thousands, and several chains contained top secret information so classified that FBI agents had to be read into them.

So, we get about 10 minutes from home, and its late. The dude has been drifting off the road onto the shoulder a good bit, and people have been saying shit like he needs to stop so someone else can drive. 

Nope. We plug on. 

So, in my home town there is this notorious curve. Its essentially 270 degree turn. You have to take it at like 30-40 tops to make it. Theres all kinds of signs warning you about the impending turn. 

So anyways, there I sit, on the aisle side with a fat lineman on the inside. I've been watching the dude for a while, and I know the turns coming. I see his speedometer is at like 60 mph, and I look up to see the road disappear. 

I brace my foot on the seat across the aisle and try to shore up my position as best I can, as I'll have to stop my weight and the lineman's. 

I hear the tires squeal and then WHAM. WHAM. WHAM. WHAM. WHAM. The bus lifts up on its right side, my side. All hell is breaking loose in the bus. We had cheerleaders with us, the screaming was at maximum. 

Me and the lineman didn't go anywhere though. Most tumbled onto the low side folks. 

The bus rights itself and we slam back down onto all wheels. 

Old dude doesn't even stop. 

60 mph all the way back to the school.

Would you agree that it is normal and even good/healthy for governments to keep some secrets from the people, maybe even to lie at times for the greater good?


You're dodging the question based on nuance. 

Regardless, no, the government should not lie to its people. We wouldn't have a majority of the legislation we have, had the government told the truth. Ala Obamacare.

The second is Jose. Jose can't speak a lick of English. However, he has references from other burger joints saying he is reliable and can reliably flip 85 burgers/hr. Jose is an illegal, and is willing to work for 5$/Hr. You hire illegals all the time, and feel it unlikely you will be caught.

The winners were the poor who got their shit paid for free either through subsidies or Medicare/Medicaid. 

The only realistic cost control to Obama was the logic that if poor people had coverage, they could prevent so many ER emergency visits that go unpaid. 

They assumed that there would be an immediate drop in poor er visits, and thus would reduce costs across the board quickly. 

Well, turns out the poor historically make poor decisions, and aren't being proactive in their health. 

Additionally, the removal of pre existing condition clause has also thrown a litany of sick people onto the pile. Whereas the bailout of forcing the young to subsidize all this didn't pan out, as they sought to minimize their contributions or flat out just took the fine. Whereas the poor and unhealthy are trying to maximize their accumulation of resources. 

Businesses have also responded with trying to skirt the law by reducing hours and freezing of hiring.

Only for you to impose Hilary's benghazi testimony in its place with her yelling, ""WHAT DOES IT MATTER!?!!?!?"" Then here a loud clang as she hangs up the phone, with the voice screaming ""MADAM PRESIDENT!?!?!?! WHERE ARE YOU?""

Then transition to Comey's comments on Hillary's extremely poor judgement and carelessness. Finally, fade to black, ""Is this the woman you want running your country?""

Could you please make that?

Also, I would love you forever if during the debates you announced that hillary isn't campaigning for just the presidency, but her freedom as well. That you vow if elected she will be charged and you will clean out all her cronies that protected her.

2004,"used to work in a vet clinic. Here is how it will generally go. 

You'll be ushered in to a room. The vet will come in, make a little small talk. They'll ask you a few questions, etc. Then they'll find a vein. It'll either be in the leg or the neck, depending on how old the pup is. 

They'll find a vein, and quickly inject the euthanasia into their veins. Once the drug is in, it works quick. Every now and then you'll get a dog that will dry heave a bit, but most are over and done within a minute or two. 

Odds are the vet will offer condolences, and then step out of the room to leave you with your pup. Techs will come in and wrap up the dog in a blanket or take the body away for you to be disposed of. 

Also, life pro tip, either take the body with you, or have it cremated. Most vets are less than ceremonial about disposing of dogs.

He says we are at war with radical islam. This is untrue. We are at odds with the entirety of Islam. There are currently 1 billion people who share some portion of this ideology. 

Bill does not understand that there are only three viable methods to defeat an ideology. 

The first is genocide. You kill each and every person who holds said beliefs. 

The second is that you invade their territory and occupy them for generations. Over that time, you suppress their birth rates and breed out the undesirables. You institute massive public schooling systems, and force their young to attend to listen to the information that you want them to hear.

The third is to wall them off from entering your country, or physically being able to harm you.  

Declaring war on ""radical Islam"" is an endless war. Simply by virtue that for every radical you kill, you will only foment more anger and hatred. 

I personally want no part in the first two of these options, as they are barbaric. 

Our only realistic path forward is to isolate the middle east, and to keep those who hold islamic values to a minimum. Any form of action short of what I previously discussed will only kick off a vicious, endless cycle of retribution.

2606,"&gt; Could that violence not be curtailed if guns were harder to access? And might there not be fewer mass shooting incidences?

Most of this violent crime is black market drug trade induced. Seeing as profit motives would be involved, it would be very similar to Mexico, and they would just go to the black market to get them. If you can't keep drugs out, what makes you think banning guns will be different?

As for mass shootings, just look at france. They effectively have a gun ban for all practical purposes, yet they still manage to have yearly mass shootings. In fact, their worst is 3x as bad as America's worst. In fact, all of France's recent mass shootings have been committed with actual military grade rifles, and not civilian models like the ones in America. 

Also, there are hundreds of thousands of defensive gun uses a year, and approximately ~ 100 or so people die during mass shootings per year. Mass shootings are so statistically rare that the FBI hasn't bother to even track them. 

Even if we assume the most conservative estimates of 130,000 defensive gun uses, and assume that .1% of these save a life, we still come out ahead on lives saved.

Is it racist when Obama suggests for a judge to step down because her nationality might induce bias into her rulings? I'm pretty sure that makes him sexist by default, too. 

Lastly, the judge in question belongs to an organization that lobbies for hispanic political interests.

UBI wouldn't address the latter, as that is a social stigma. Education is not the only method for success. I would argue trying to send everyone to college is a waste of money. 

&gt;If you give them UBI on top of them having that minimum wage, now they can choose how to spend it more freely (and it's easier to understand and plan for) and the government frees up massive amounts of administrative resources along with financial costs.

If its purpose is to replace welfare, and you claim that it will lift people out of poverty, can you point to any evidence that previous welfare systems have done such? All data I have seen to date suggests it is only a net, and not a trampoline. 

I would also argue that minimum wage is what keeps many people in poverty, as they are either undercut by illegals offering sub min wage, or do not have the marketable skills to gain 7.25$/hr. 

&gt; It essentially simplifies the entire welfare system by condensing everything into a check rather than applying for dozens of separate programs (many of which they don't know they qualify for or that they even exist). States can reduce their welfare programs as well and given these savings, reduce their taxes to offset the difference, giving people more spending money everywhere.

2773,"UBI is contingent upon the recipients exercising personal responsibility. Otherwise, why wouldn't they spend their free money on whatever, and then rely on welfare programs to provide the necessities? It would literally be to their benefit. 

Thus, you have two options under UBI. you also keep the welfare programs, in which the poor will obviously act in their best interest and spend the money not on necessities and allow the welfare programs to do such. In which case it defeats the whole purpose of UBI, which is it will be cheaper then welfare. 

The alternative is you set a hard limit. ""This is all you're getting. If you spend it irresponsibly I won't give you more.l, even if you're starving.""

In which case the argument for UBI is that if forced to deal with the consequences of their actions, people will make responsible decisions. Aka personal responsibility. Which, is the conservative argument against welfare. 

So, your rebuttal should clearly address the two issues that I have pointed out. 

For your rebuttal, you should be specific in what type UBI you want. You should address why the poor wouldn't spend their money irresponsibly and just rely on food stamps and whatever else for the first scenario.

So, if you feel that someone is being racist, you ignore what they're saying. Its classic.

&gt;Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in Allah. If only the People of the Book [Christians and Jews] had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are perverted transgressors. 

The Quran, clearly espousing that Islam is superior ideology. Also, I love how muslim men are so poorly in control of their actions, that, ""Here, woman, put this trash bag on, lest I suffer a sexual emergency"", is a reasonable solution to rape.

Chemical plants very much prefer reliability.

I mean, just the control scheme of it would be a night mare for steam generation. You'd almost certainly have to keep natural gas boilers running to smooth out the clouds, and even then they're not designed to respond to transients. 

I can see it now. Cloud cover knocks out 25% of solar steam gen at the drop of a hat, and your ng boilers roar to meet set point only for the cloud cover to pass and now you're 25% over energy demand. So your ng boilers ramp down. 

All the while your steam pressure and quality you're sending to process is all over the board. So the control valve that maintains reactants temperature opens up due to the drop in steam temp and then gets slugged with overly hot temps.

They write down the license plate, and leave, don't bother to find the owner. Lo and behold they lose the paper it was written on. 

3 weeks later I'm home alone, and someone starts trying to break in. I grab my hand gun and go to say hello to whoever was taking a hammer to my front door knob.

Taxation is theft. Stolen money, no matter the noble intent, is still immoral. There is an old quote that goes that sums it up nicely. 

&gt;Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.” 
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law

In short, I believe the state to be a wildly ineffective mechanism, and believe that the free market would be far more efficient in remedying societal ills.

&gt;You're missing my point, if they had managed the oil correctly, which we see many countries doing around the world, they could have easily afforded those welfare programs.

I outlined the specific reason why Venezuela has failed, which was the nationalization of the means of production. Which killed off most of their economic output outside of oil. Namely that no one would invest in the country inside or out for fear of having it stolen from them. 

Now then, unless you can point to other oil rich nations that nationalized the means of production during the same time frame, and are still doing well, you do not have a point. So, do you have an example of a socialist oil rich nation that seized the means of production from private ownership?

&gt;You've also made the mistake of assuming welfare programs make people not want to work, a provably false statement again by many other countries with generous welfare programs, yet people still want to work. You can blame many things on socialism there, but socialism sure as hell isn't the main cause of the severe incompetence.

Again, my statement is contingent on the fact that there was a general consensus that any value created would be stolen by the government, thus making it in ones best interests to not work.

3024,"Ok. Let's start with logic. 

Bernie says single payer is less expensive. Yet he wants to massively raise taxes. Logically, if it were less expensive, then why the tax hike? The answer here is that it's a bribe. Bernie has said to the 51% that he will rob the 49% for goodies. 

Logically, there will be some who have an outrageous tax bill for health care. They will also receive an inferior product comparative to the status quo. Logically, they belong to the 49%, and are not part of the group Bernie has promised goodies. 

Now then, let's look at it philosophically. 

Taxes are theft of the value produced by ones labor. Bernie has stated that the 51% are entitled to a portion of the 49% productivity. Thus Bernie believes in slavery, as he is willing to use force to stake claim to another man's labor against said mans will. Obviously you're going to reply with something along the lines of, ""but but they g-give you healthcare!"" Which is true, and slaves received food water shelter and protection.

[Here is what Denmark has to say on Bernie's praise of its ""socialism"".](http://www.investors.com/politics/capital-hill/denmark-tells-bernie-sanders-to-stop-calling-it-socialist/)

The point here is that these great countries you point to have high levels of economic freedom. They participate in what is called a social democracy. Which, by most metrics, is the least worst form on the spectrum of socialism. Their economy survives despite the parasitism of massive welfare states. 

That said, it isn't a sustainable system, and will come crashing down eventually like in Greece. social democracies are literally a ponzi scheme, where the first investors in get a real good deal, but those after them get fucked. 

You can already see the problems of social democracies manifesting themselves in the form of austerity and privatizing healthcare in the UK. 

&gt;All you have to deal with is more tax, but it goes back into local projects abd Scocial Assistance. You have 0 reasons to gate Scocialism. None.

There are plenty of reasons to hate socialism, if you're a productive member of society that is. Taxation at its core is theft. 

For example, lets say I could make 100,000$ and be taxed at 25% in the U.S., or 50% in Denmark. 

So, in the U.S. I could pay 25 k in taxes, and have 25 k of extra disposable income. In america I could get health insurance and on average pay about 1000 $ a year out of pocket. With the worst case scenario being approx 5 k per year. 

So, for that extra 24k I could invest some of this money into health savings accounts. I could put the rest into various other income generating investments that will fund my retirement. Which, will compound interest and thus my net worth and insuring financial security. 

Conversely in Denmark, I could pay 50k in taxes. In which I would receive sub par care comparative to what I could afford in America. I would also be beholden to whatever the government decided to provide. I would also lose out on that 25 k a year in investment opportunity in terms of compounded interest and net worth. 

The only people socialism benefits are the unproductive who have to steal their existence by voting. ",2016-05-21 22:58:43+00:00,d3elt35,6.0,t1_d3ekqlk,1985.0,news

Worked pretty fuckin good for the chinese.

So, a 50% reduction, which would free up ICE to focus on the other 50%.... 

&gt;What is really suppressing jobs is the lack of education and how it's not accessible for most Americans causing a higher supply of unskilled laborers.

3130,"&gt;Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia.

Hope and change. Feel the Bern. Saying the American pledge every morning in school. Yet some how MAGA is more sinister? lol K.

&gt;Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. Trump said he'd kill the families of terrorists to stop terrorism

.... Obama has extrajudicially killed American citizens. He now totals like over 4000 dead civilians via drone strikes. Yet, Trump says lets build a wall to stop a group of people from coming in and suppressing unskilled wages, and suddenly he's literally hitler. 

&gt;Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. Liberals; Mexica... oh, I'm sorry, ""illegal immigrants""; Hillary; Musli..err... ""radical islam""... etc

.... Hilarious. I would like a specific number from you. Specifically, what percentage of a population has to show a propensity towards violence or radical ideology before you consider them to be an issue?

&gt;Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. Trump has said he wants to make America's military great again. We spend more than the next 11 countries, combined.

I am not one for military interventionism, but force projection is a real thing. 

&gt;Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution. While Milo is their ""It's ok if we say faggot, we have gay friends"" card, their constant use of ""degenerate"" is basically dogwhistle for anything abnormal, including homosexuality.

Trump, the sexist who hires women all the time, has named his daughter as his successor, and was the first to give a woman the opportunity to manage building a skyscraper. Yes, clearly, he's sexist. The rest of this is just hilarious bull shit. Trump supporters are so far past identity politics we simply don't even give a shit if your gay. 

&gt;Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. Do we need to explain this one? Lol. Trump is obviously the worst, since he wants to ban all Muslim refugees

I asked this previously, but again, I would like to know what percentage of a population sharing an ideology or sect or whatever would have to be prone to violence or radicalization before you considered that group too dangerous. 

&gt;Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. Labor unions seen as a cancer by most Republicans, and labor unionization attempts at Trump properties have been met with silence or derision

Source this. 

&gt;Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked. Again, no explanation needed. The fact that ""academic"" is a term of derision is enough..

Please, show me where any professor is getting attacked by Trump supporters. The only people who are violently harassing on college campuses are SJW. We are currently in the golden age of academia, where even the most crack pot PhD can get a cushy gig critiquing Twilight and other tween movies. 

&gt;Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. Deporting all illegals? How else are they going to do this?

Lol. This is just farcical.

If someone uses an ad hominem against you, i.e. You're racist, you never ever defend yourself against that claim. The second you've done that, you've made your opponent the moral authority in the debate, and thus lost the debate. You should always keep in mind that when ad hominems are broken out it is because the **debate has entered into uncomfortable territory.** hence why they're trying to derail and distract. 

Instead, you have two options. The first is to call out the ad hominem and refuse to debate it, then continuing on with the subject matter. This is fairly  effective, but it can lead to further abuse. 

My preferred method is simple. Ask them to explain how what I said is racist/bigoted, and then wait for them to expose their obvious bias. Once you've destroyed their claim, immediately revert back to the topic at hand. Never ever let the debate devolve into bickering about racist or not. That's the goal of the their claim. 

What you will see is that these people with either just flat out not respond, or they will shamelessly double down and appear as intellectually mature as children. 

I have an actual really good example of implementing this here yesterday, but we can't link outside the sub and I don't have access to screen shotting right now. ",2016-05-13 12:03:48+00:00,d33x44j,1.0,t3_4j42lj,37255.0,The_Donald

3270,"&gt;but Zimmerman's somehow innocent of doing the same when he left his truck and said plainly to the 911 operator that he intended to confront Martin?

source. This was not brought up at trial. 

&gt;I'm saying that the possibility that he began the physical confrontation hasn't been ruled out. You don't have to take a swing to (for example) grab someone by their collar.

really, you are grasping at straws. The girl friend of Trayvon confirmed that didn't happen. 

&gt;Would someone calling for help make you no longer feel they're a threat to their life? I'd bet Martin felt the concealed weapon upon coming into contact with Zimmerman (however that happened), and feared that if he didn't incapacitate Zimmerman, Zimmerman would end his life

Under Florida law, even if you start a fight, you have the right to self defense once you signal your clear intent to withdraw from the fight. Since Trayvon had Zimmerman pinned, he could not retreat, since Zimmerman begged for help he signaled clear intent to withdraw. Also, witnesses reported that Trayvon was standing atop Zimmerman, not wrestling with him. 

So, how Trayvon figured out Zimmerman had a **concealed gun** tucked into his appendix in a holster, under a jacket, in the dark while it was raining? 

The trial showed trayvons DNA was not on the gun. There were also no defensive marks on zimmermans wrists to suggest a struggle for the gun. Additionally, trayvons ground and pound lasted for an extended period of time before he was shot. Logically, had he known Zimmerman had a gun, he would have focused on such. Instead, of grounding and pounding zimmermans head. 

Had the confrontation gone down the way you claim, there would have been some form of evidence to support it. 

Instead, all signs point to the opposite. 

The DA for this witch hunt tried to prove it to 12 people, who had all the evidence and an advocate for your stance, and yet they still found him not guilty. Yet here we are, like 4 years later, and you have the gall to maintain that they were all wrong. 

This is the level of denial that if you thought the sky was puke green, and I marched your ass outside and pointed up and said ""fucking look."" You'd still argue with me about it. ",2016-05-12 16:28:11+00:00,d32uhxx,13.0,t1_d32pqrx,6369.0,news

There were additionally no other wounds to Trayvon other than the gun shot wound and his knuckles. 

In other words, Zimmerman never managed to land a blow on Trayvon whereas Zimmerman was roughed up significantly. 

Combined with the fact that Trayvon had two minutes of non contact with Zimmerman to make it 100 yards to safety of his home, but was instead found at the crux of the T instead of the base where his parents lived. In addition to zimmermans first walk through of the bridge of the T, whilst on the phone with police, did not see Trayvon.

3277,"&gt;Attempted murder? 
Yea every black person in America might try and randomly kill someone at any point

I'm going to preface this by saying that your comment and views have been consistently debunked, and the fact you still maintain this is sad. 

Ok. During the trial evidence was submitted that Trayvon was bashing zimmermans head into concrete. It was also shown during trial that Trayvon was the aggressor. Thus, Trayvon was committing attempted murder. I don't know how you managed to fanagle all black men into a murder trial that has nothing to do with race. 

&gt;Who's to say Zimmerman,  the colossal douchebag that he is, didn't brandish his weapon at Trayvon? Who to say what caused the first blows? Am i to believe Zimmerman  reacted with words to de escalate the situation?  

again, it was proven at trial that while Zimmerman was getting his head slammed against the concrete that he continually called for help. Only until he was about to lose consciousness did he pull his weapon and fire a single round. There were multiple witnesses corroborating this. 

If Zimmerman was the aggressor, why did he let Trayvon bash his head in for so long? Why didn't he just shoot him repeatedly if he had his weapon drawn and was accosting Trayvon? Why didn't he shoot Trayvon multiple times? 

The answer to these questions is that Zimmerman was sucker punched before he could react. He was on the ground getting pummeled before he could draw, and once he did draw and fire the gun jammed on his clothing. 

This was confirmed by eye witnesses and corroborated by evidence. Specifically zimmermans DNA under trayvons fingernails and scuffs to his knuckles. Zimmerman had only defensive wounds. His knuckles were fine. 

&gt;You're  a racist dude its obvious. Zimmerman was just following  a black kid home, the age old story of blacks being followed  but he took it too far. You AVOID ALTERCATIONS when you have a pistol on your hip. You cant just stalk people home and expect them not to confront you get real man. Trayvon even started running and called someone for advice its not like he was outside walking around looking for trouble to start. He was buying candy dude.

explain to me how evaluating evidence is racist? 

The police tapes confirm that Zimmerman had lost sight of Trayvon for over two minutes before the altercation. Please explain to me how one is following someone they have lost track of. Additionally, explain to me how Trayvon had over 2 minutes to make it home, only 100 yards away, yet barely made it 15 yards.

Let's say we raise taxes by 15% on anyone making over 250k. That's 37 k we assume the lowest person can absorb. 

We then tell them for that 37k a year, they can get basic medical care, and various other cancer stuff we say they can have. 

However, because we want to serve the lowest common denominator, we shift resources towards the common illnesses and typically don't cover high end treatments for various cancers. 

Now then, that ""rich"" person gets sick. It's cancer. The 37k he has been paying year over year has gone to waste, as the government has said, ""we won't cover that treatment for you because it's too expensive."" 

So, after years and years, and hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions in tax money, the government has told this person to go pound sand. To pay for it himself. They are too busy healing crack addicts from over doses and dumbasses who broke their leg. 

That's what I'm getting at. Socialized medicine is a bum deal for most productive members of society, because they pay far more in taxes and receive a far inferior product had they kept that money. 

Also, just as a fun thought experiment. Let's say you have a group of 20 people. 10 are white men over the age of 55. The other 10 are urban youths under the age of 24. The over 55 all have an average income of 300 k, and employ on average 30 people. 

The urban youths have no appreciable marketable skills. 

Now then. Statistics say that the white men will likely live healthy lives until they get cancer. 

The urban youths are prone to gunshots and drug over doses.

""Golly gee wiz guys, our previous government had a lot of lee way in the mean things it could say about the people it killed, and clearly that is what was the deciding factor in their ability to carry out their atrocities.

Match with girl. Wait TIL the next morning and fire out a witty/creative opener. Chat through the morning, probably about 10-20 messages either way. Ask for phone number, and then start texting her. Depending on that time frame, either ask her for a date that day, or early the next day.

1. Most company HR policies only allow HR to confirm dates of employment. 

2. They do not allow any manager or supervisor to give references. 

3. They do not release performance review information after termination. 

When I was fired, the HR woman literally told me that I could make up any excuse I wanted for leaving the company, so that's what I did. 

Leave it on your resume, and figure out a convincing lie. You were laid off. You realized the company was a poor fit and not aligned with your career goals, so you started a job hunt. Only to be found out and pressured to resign. Whatever makes the most sense to your case. 

Essentially, odds are its highly unlikely your potential employer will be able to find out anything other than what you tell them for fear of getting sued and like wise for your previous employer. ",2016-04-29 00:08:01+00:00,d2leszi,1.0,t3_4guttb,26957.0,jobs

8. Is he going to bail after two years for greener pastures.

3661,"Socialism? No, its been tried a litany of times, and it always ends in violent suppression/revolution of the peoples. The only countries that stand the test of time are the ones with a good amount of economic and personal freedom. 

Odds are what your girlfriend really is, is a [social democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy) , versus [ a democratic socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism)

To my knowledge, there are no successful democratic socialist countries. I'm sure there has been numerous attempts, but when they fail they're retroactively labeled, ""State Capitalism."" 

 There are, however, a smattering of social democracies throughout Europe. America also technically has social democracy leanings. 

So, the real question is, ""Do social democracies work?"" The short answer is, they don't fall apart right away. What typically happens is it takes several generations for them to burn through their nation's accumulated wealth, and to eventually go bankrupt. If you want a prime example of this, look to Greece. 

Social democracies are like a ponzi scheme. Those who get in early think its great, because they get their investment and returns, but inevitably the last ones in before it collapses get burned. 

Typically, you can sustain some mild form of social welfare programs, so long as it isn't massive comparative to your capitalist economy. 

However, the problem with these systems is the people always demand more, and inevitably strangle their economies to death. Which is what you're seeing in Europe right now, especially great britian. The govt can't tax any more and the services are too expensive, so now they're trying to privatize as much as possible. ",2016-04-28 19:12:07+00:00,d2l2ear,1.0,t3_4gvevf,1996.0,Libertarian

3713,"Nope. Just indoctrinated. All that ""free"" college education, where most of Europes youth sat in an echo chamber for 4 years? This is what it was for. Millions of reactionary idiots that are programmed to fly off the handle when signaled. 

If you've ever read 1984, you know that before the Party emerged society had almost achieved actual equality. The means of production were at such an excess that it afforded the middle and lower class significant leisure time. This leisure time led to the middle questioning the need for the high at all. 

The high figured out how to burn off this excess production in the form of perpetual war. 

After World War II, Europe entered into a period of relative peace and prosperity. The majority of which was focused on social issues. Mostly subsidized by American hard work and effort. 

Inevitably when you hit such prosperity you get a few fools that think socialism is a good idea, and that it'd be nifty to overthrow the high. 

So, now the elites see what is coming down the pipe. Thus, they've been importing millions of people who subscribe to incompatible beliefs to secularism. 

This will eventually cause huge social friction and most likely division and or perpetual war against Islamism. 

Because what will happen is the useful idiots, that installed these social democracies and that wanted to import Islam will die on that hill maintaining that they're peaceful and a benefit. Rather than admit their political dogma is wrong. 

Muslims are gonna Muslim and blow shit up, rape, and in general not integrate. Thus, ethnic Europeans will start swinging right, and away from the left. 

It will also help deter any further increases in government welfare, as resentment will increase because tax payers will view giving that money to people not in their ""in group"". There is precedent for this in the American south where many white tax payers despise welfare, as they see it as effectively giving it to African Americans who are not in the ""group."" 

There's a historical example for this in Israel. Initially the Israeli left held sway because they could maintain the narrative that the Palestinians could be negotiated with peacefully. Obviously, after so many wars and terrorist attacks both sides have swung so far right that the only way peace will come is when one side exterminates the other. 

This is what will come to pass in Europe. Odds are our grand children will be shooting tyrants in Europe, again. ",2016-04-26 21:58:47+00:00,d2iisi8,2.0,t1_d2ibapy,9737.0,worldnews

&gt;Even if I were to agree however, why would a newborn have more rights than anyone else in the USA? That is what you are asking for, no other person in the USA is allowed to require someone else give up personal autonomy or any other body function unwillingly to another person. 

This is false on two fronts. I will highlight them both. 

Barring rapes, the mother willingly engaged in an act that placed said life/fetus into a situation in which it must use her body for survival. Self defense dictates that one person can use any force necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm brought about by another person's actions. 

The other is the draft. The us government can confiscate any male body at Will so long as it has a compelling interest to do so. If you define citizenship at conception, then the government has compelling interest to seize the mother's body to ensure the unborn citizen's survival.

The books focus on what someone would really experience on a magic quest. In most magic books, the protagonist is ordained and layered to the nines in plot armor. Moderately bad stuff happens, but they overcome. Happily ever after. While this is true for the magicians as well, it wasn't by fate. Q had to work very hard and wait almost a decade to fix his mistakes. 

I also felt this as a metaphor for coming from money. Most of their lives are insulated from real repercussion, and they can do what 99% of the rest of the world can't.

4068,"Here's what I've found to be a some what successful solo player. 

Equip a shock turret and the disorienting sticky. 

Rock a smg and a lmg. 

Load out your lmg, mag cap and for accuracy and stability. The smg for crit hits and mag cap. 

Then start stalking patrols. Make sure you won't get flanked by another one. 

Sneak to within about 30 meters, and toss the shock turret. Make sure they're all in a close group first. Then fire the disorienting sticky. While they're all discombobulated, open up on the group with the lmg. I try for the grenadiers anmo packs. They're the key here, as they're the only ones who can flush you from cover. Kill them first, then shotguns. 

If you have time, reload and keep firing. If a shotgun breaks loose and charges you, the turret will slow him. Bust out the smg and take him down quick. 

Do thin in the 3-4 dz zones. Venture too far north and you're easy exp for top tiers. Too far south and you'll be vulnerable to other players. 

If you run into a group of players, sticky then with the disorienting bomb and run for your life. If the players give chase, run through npcs. If that stops them, great. If not, pick some cover and make a stand to where they're pinned between you and the npc. 

If you actually drop good loot, the extract in the north east of like dz 4/5 is out of the way and few players ever think to venture over there, as its in the corner of the dz. the npc spawn are manageable as well. 

I was in a similar situation as you, but doing this has seen me jump from 32 to 36 with little regression or back tracking. ",2016-04-07 18:43:01+00:00,d1tvy6h,2.0,t1_d1tle9i,13180.0,thedivision

4077,"Fellow Chem E here. So, your resume isn't bad, assuming you have greater than a 3.0. I honestly didn't read it all, and thus I doubt a recruiter does either. Its rather hard to tell if that experience is relevant to a chem E co-op. I suggest you read several job postings for Chem E co-ops, and copy and paste verbatim skills and lines you see in there. 

However, you're getting to what I assume is on site/in person interview stage, but not getting an offer. 

Which, all things considered, leads me to believe that there is some red flags about your personality.

Its hard to explain to someone who has never worked full time in a plant/office environment, but 95% of what a company is looking for is someone that they can get along with or won't get them sued.  They can teach you what they want you to know. 

I'm going to assume you're a white male, and I'm telling you this from some hard earned experience. Few baby boomers nor blue collars like a young, know it all engineer. They also don't like a young, intelligent engineer who isn't afraid to voice their opinion. 

Look back at all those questions they asked, all but one are fishing for information about your communication skills. 

&gt;Tell me about a time you were able to successfully deal with another person even when that individual may not have personally liked you (or vice versa). (Asked at least twice.)

Your answer is effectively, ""I refused to help him, and then tattled."" 

That is not good conflict resolution. You effectively did not handle the situation and let it exacerbate until higher ups had to get involved. 

Here is an example of conflict resolution. In my previous job, one of the maintenance facilitators were extremely onerous to deal with. Asking the smallest thing was always an arduous task. So, one day I popped in and asked for a simple task to be done. 

Well, he blows up about how he's over worked and I'm being unrealistic. I quickly realized that he was under the impression that I wanted it right that minute. I then calmly explained to him that I had a much more reasonable deadline in mind, say two weeks, and that calmed him down and we were able to set a date for the work to be completed. 

The **lesson I learned** was to be clear and concise with this individual, and to give him all the information he needed in one sitting, so he could not jump to conclusions. 

So, my advice to you is this. You should effectively **communicate** to your potential employers that you are a humble, easy to get along with, engineer who is seeking to learn.  

Also, this isn't going to make a damn bit of sense right now, but the blue collar guys might have fuck all in classical training, however, they're a prime source of process knowledge. So, when you get a co-op, sit down, shut up, and listen. Right wrong or indifferent, you had better agree with the blue collar who has 30 years experience. Doesn't matter if he just told you the sky is typically piss yellow. ",2016-04-07 04:49:17+00:00,d1t67ne,1.0,t3_4dovtu,11971.0,AskMen

4135,"Just think of it like this. A capitalist has 1000 pounds of corn, worth 1000$. 

He takes that corn and ferments it into 100 gallons of whiskey, worth 1200$. 

Now then, the capitalist has managed to create 200$ worth of wealth from that corn. He hasn't created more money, but he has created more wealth. Wealth and money are distinctly different things. Money is just a type of representation of wealth. I could buy 1000 dollars worth of corn, and then burn it. The farmer I bought it from has 1000 dollars, but the wealth that corn represented is gone. 

Capitalism is a self propagating system due to the creation of wealth. 

Social democracies/socialism see this, and say, ""hey, you've created excess here, let's give it to XYZ.""

However, the problem here is its typically given to someone who cannot produce enough wealth to procure these goods themselves. 

Thus, they will tax the capitalist 300$ on the whiskey, which will be spent on people who are a net negative economic drain. Thus, only leaving 900$ of wealth left, 100$ less than the original value of the corn. The same amount of money still exists, but the wealth has been greatly diminished. 

Social democracies can only persist so long as they destroy less wealth than has been created. E.g in the previous example they'd of only taken 50-100$, leaving the capitalist with a net profit. ",2016-04-02 15:27:14+00:00,d1n14c6,3.0,t1_d1mxg66,8152.0,The_Donald

Thus, when the town whore, or some lowly minority accuses XYZ of rape or whatever, the rest of the boys rally to effectively destroy her, and if need be shut her up. Because who is going to believe the town whore over these respectable men?

Well, then email, text messaging, and smart phones happened. Now all the town whores have a camera in their pocket and actual evidence of contact, etc.

4225,"As I've said, I anticipate this to take place over a few generations/several decades. However, I expect, and the trends have shown, that muslims breed in a much higher volume than the native europeans in addition to migration. They're projected to be 10% of the pop of Europe by 2050. At these percentages, they will be able to court disproportionate political clout, similar to the african americans in the U.S. Naturally, they will favor destructive, authoritarian policies. 

What I suspect will happen, is what has happened in a litany of other Muslim countries. Their once secular government will be overthrown by a violent minority, seeking to install a theocracy. 

I believe that in the following decades, jobs and prosperity will be harder and harder to find in Europe, especially true for muslim youth. Europe will then have high poverty and large populations of idle, young muslims. A scenario that is prime for revolution. Effectively what is happening in the ME right now. 

 I cannot say how it will start, but I do believe civil war will break out in Europe eventually, secularists vs islamists. Now, I wouldn't be too worried about this, but Europeans have shown themselves to be 100% spineless here in the past few decades. I don't believe them to have the gumption to save themselves, to do what would be necessary to win. 

Thus, the civil wars will drag on for years, spilling over boarders as the caliphate or what have you amasses military power and nukes. Eventually, threatening the rest of the secular world. ",2016-03-25 04:30:46+00:00,d1cps69,5.0,t1_d1cp8np,1139.0,The_Donald

Currently, there are 40 people in the town seeking living arrangements. Obviously, there is no incentive to be competitive, as the demand far outstrips the supply. 

Now then, a third competitor builds an apartment complex for 40 people. 

Suddenly, there are now 60 apartments for rent, but only 40 tenants. 

Obviously, I am faced with three options. 

1. Reduce prices to remain competitive. 

2. Leave my apartments vacant, whilst paying for maintenance and taxes on said property. 

3. Sell my property. 

As you can see, by the addition of supply, demand went down, thus forcing prices as well. If my business model is not competitive, I will begin to suffer financial losses, and will have to sell my property to mitigate said losses.

Let me put it to you in this dynamic. The establishment has a vested interest in consolidation and concentration of power. Centralized powerful governments are what I consider to be extremely destructive. 

I assume that the politicians representing this dynamic are rational actors. Thus, when you observe their behavior towards trump, you see that they view him as a threat to their control. Which, means the enemy of my enemy is my friend. 

So, let's say trump does get elected. One of a few things happen. 

1. the establishment refuses to work with him. This will piss off their voting base. Hopefully opening up for other anti establishment congressmen. Which, again, decentralizes power. Additionally congress will be gridlocked, so no furthering of agenda.

could you provide evidence of such?

&gt;that he would be a god-awful diplomat who could do a lot of harm to our relations with the rest of the world, and that his very existence in the limelight is in encouraging radical nationalism

He's an international businessman, his job was literally to get along with whoever he needed to get along with. It's silly to think he can't be a diplomat, when it's the core of his job. 

&gt;He makes vague claims of ""making America great again"" which is nothing but a buzz-phrase with zero substance and most of his ideas for how to do this are wildly infeasible (e.g. making Mexico pay for a wall along the border)

this should speak to his intelligence. He knows how to speak to his audience. Also, why is making Mexico pay for it unreasonable? We force our allies to fork over far larger sums of money over for far more frivolous endeavors. A few billion a year for ten years is nothing. 

&gt;) or ethically grey (e.g. waterboarding suspected terrorists, killing their families, using the U.S. military to threaten Mexico into building the wall).

Watch as the expert outlines a ridiculous scenario where red lines could be green, but that it is impractical. Notice how the idiots in the room seize upon the only information they could comprehend, that it was possible. 

Trump is the expert in the room, but he knows how to communicate to the idiots in the room. Instead of long winded explanations and debates, he succinctly conveys to them, in a manner that they can understand, ""trust me, I know what I'm doing."" He doesn't elaborate, he doesn't mince words, he tells them what they need to hear, and the next time they'll just agree with his decision making.

She will liken it to carrying the Dons child, and fantasize about what a wonderful life she has ahead of her. 

The trump wines will loosen her lips, and fill her with warmth. She will then dream of the Dons loving embrace. The dinner will come to an end, but trump has a surprise! A moonlit evening of dancing atop trump tower, and its wondrous views. 

Megan jelly can't stand it. She must have the trump. However, trump knows the deal isn't done yet. Suddenly, a helicopter swoops in, and whisks them away to one of trumps most luxurious hotel pent houses. 

There, they enjoy one final glass of wine before sharing a kiss on his glorious balcony. Trump takes Megan jelly into his embrace, and leads her into the bedroom. Where he repeatedly nimbly navigates every inch of her body. Taking her to heights unseen before. 

Suddenly, there is a bright light, and she wakes up in a hospital room. She's confused. What has happened to the don? She cries for him. Only to see a doctor staring at her with disgust. The doctor replies, ""ma'am, you're in a hospital room. You've been in a coma for 6 months.""

You also have to understand, American capitalism has done more for the standard of living across the globe, than any other force on earth. In fact, it is what enables socialist states in Europe to exist. The fact that you have a super power that subsidizes your existence from military to research and development allows your government to dedicate funds that would otherwise be needed for military spending.

4566,"So, the story. Took the ole girl to a park that has a creek running along in it. Noticed that the creek was high and the water was moving pretty well. Anyways, I found a little babbling brook with a pool just big enough for her to get in. She loves the water, but has gotten old so I haven't really let her splash around in a good while.  

So, I take her off the leash to let her splash around. Well, turns out that was stupid, as a black lab is gonna black lab, and she made a B line for the deep water of the creek. She jumps in, and its immediately apparent that the current is pretty swift, as it starts dragging her down stream. 

She's having a grand old time, as she doesn't realize whats happened. I, on the other hand, am freaking the fuck out. The banks are too steep for her to climb out of, and there are some minor rapids way down river. Well, about 200 yards down river, she finally decides to try and swim back, only to find out she can only tread water. She tries to reach the creek bank, only to get slammed up against some rocks, and pushed back out to open water. 

So, she floats another 200 yards. Well, she decides she wants out, but hasn't even been in moving water before. So, she sits in the middle of the creek swimming directly up stream, Im getting anxious as there is no way to get to her. I decide to run down stream and find a spot she can make land. However, the trail peeled away from the stream and the brush made me lose eye contact with her. She's no where to be seen, so at this point I start running along the creek bank, which is covered in briars and other shrubbery, looking for her. 

I see her treading water, and call to no avail. She's just swimming against the current, tiring herself out. She's being doing this now for the better part of 20 minutes, and I have no way to get to her. Then, it hits me, throw a stick behind her. So, I find a good sized stick and chunked it right behind her, and she turns to fetch the stick. She gets it and decided to bring it to me. 

Finally! she's on the bank and safe. Nope. Dumb bitch tries to jump back in. So, here I am diving into a creek, literally catching her by the tail, and dragging her ass back to the fucking bank. I dropped her leash earlier stumbling through the woods, so I had to use my belt. 

Finally collected all my shit and got back to the trail. Put her back on the leash, and then had to walk a mile up hill with soggy pants and boots. Needless to say I got a lot of strange WTF looks.  ",2016-02-28 19:50:48+00:00,d0h6ecs,1.0,t3_484uer,1146.0,TrollYChromosome

4590,"&gt;No because the employee may be taking the job out of desperation.

If the employee took a job paying sub minimum wage, he has clearly caused tangible financial damage to another potential hire who did not offer to work sub minimum wage. Its tantamount to theft, and I don't see burglars getting let go because they were desperate. 

&gt;I don't see how the two are related. Breaking the law means you should be prosecuted for breaking the law. Take from that what you will. Not that I agree that abortions should be illegal, but if they were, then getting one would be illegal whether I like it or not.

So then, you do support using violence against women to prevent abortions? 

Anyways, I'll get to the point. The logic I'm trying to get you to see here is this. Getting an abortion is part of a woman's choice over her own body autonomy. You would not condone violence against the woman for doing with her body as she pleases. The same can be said for the laborer and employer. The laborer should have the freedom to sell his body's labor for whatever rate he can voluntarily negotiate. ",2016-02-25 00:42:02+00:00,d0co7uu,12.0,t1_d0cnmyj,917.0,news

4879,"&gt; So, who owns a highway? Or main street in a city? Can I use the highway if I own a ""pass"" to one of the companies or do I need to own all of them?

I have explained that it will be private property. So it will work similarly to any other experience you've had with renting/using other's private property. 

&gt;Who issues licence plates again? And what would stop me from copying another person's plates? Or from me and a bunch of friends from sharing one plate? And do you have an elaborate system of cameras on every corner that checks if I can drive on that road? You honestly think that will be cheaper and better than we do now?

... why is a problem not solved under the current system a criticism of private roads? Also, lol'd at the cameras on every corner. You realize that the state is literally doing this in most large cities?

See, you've named several things that the state does currently, and then act as if the idea is absolutely preposterous. 

&gt;So you have no idea. But somebody would figure it out, somehow.

.... I left it broadly because I figured I'd give an explanation of one way it would work, you'd cook up a scenario i hadn't covered, and we'd rinse and repeat until you were out of ideas. 

&gt;This comment is the kicker. You want a group of people to take care of the public, and if the people don't like it then they can change it. So, like a government that you can change by voting? Or by moving? Face it, you are trying to crowbar your ideology into reality on matter the cost

Voting makes you an extreme minority, and subject to the whims of others. It is also cyclical, so you'd very well have to wait 4-8 years before any issue could be remedied. Under privatization, oh you pissed me off? Thats cool, I'll take my money else where. In one scenario I am compelled to give money to a product/service I might not want, and have no control over. In the latter, I have direct control and can effect change swiftly. 

&gt;You are telling me with a straight face that a system that checks through checkpoints, licence plate cameras, and overlapping subscription services would be more efficient than literally paying a couple dollars a year in taxes to keep the roads open? If you think that then I can't help you and this ""debate"" can't continue.

Again, you offer up criticism of privatization when it exists under the current system. I'd also point out that you are not currently paying the ""true"" cost of today's government through taxes. Seeing as we engage in deficit spending. You're effectively comparing two credit cards, one where you pay off the statement balance every month and another where you make the minimum payment. 

&gt;The idea of a society is to create something bigger than the individual. What you are really asking, and what the entire point of libertarianism is: ""Why should I help anyone else but me?"" Society isn't an ala carte system nor does it make any sense to make it work that way. It would be objectively worse. This is the sort of thinking that has the U.S. pay more to ensure the poor don't get healthcare than it would cost to just treat them.

The United States, arguably the most prosperous in the history of the world, was founded on the principles of individualism and promotion of the person above the sate. I would like for you to additionally link me to a definition of society that includes any reference of government. Society is completely separate from government. 

&gt;And what makes you think that 51% of the want roads. What if that number was 99% or 99.9%? And there was this .1% that said no? Would you change the fabric of society for the worse to accommodate this selfish .1%?

This is literally the logic used to kill native americans and take their land. 

&gt;There is a reason why the liberarian model doesn't work, has never worked, and barring a technological revolution it will never work.

Tell you what. Go tally up all the hundreds of millions killed in the name of government interests, and then tally up all the people killed in the name of the free market, and lets see which is worse. ",2016-01-24 23:09:14+00:00,czaiyyw,14.0,t1_czaialh,906.0,PoliticalHumor
4880,"&gt;Travel restrictions? Who would enforce them?

Whoever owns the road. 

&gt;What does that even mean?

That you have to get permission to use private property.....

&gt;The road is cleared and I want to shop at napkin co but armed guards tell me that they didn't pay to have the road cleared so I can't drive to napkin co? 

You would have the option to pay to use private property, or you could use another road/service. 

&gt;Or do I now need to buy a subscription to roads? How does that work?

It will be location and detail specific. 

&gt;What if I buy a Napkin co road pass but when I get to the mall I walk to Paper Towel Inc? I didn't buy a pass for them? Am I arrested? Do they check my pass at the door, ""sorry sir, you can't shop here you didn't pay us to drive here."" It boggles the mind the sheer scale of the problem.

.... license plates.....? Same concept/problem. 

&gt;Wouldn't it be so much easier if I payed a small amount to one ""organization"" and that ""organization"" then handled the roads?

This would likely be an option. You and your neighborhood could also unionize and have the power to negotiate in numbers. If this ""organization"" pisses you off, you can take your business elsewhere. 

&gt;And at the end of my road, the one I currently live on, there are 3 houses, depending on the time of the year about 5 people. We are a couple miles from a main road. So, I ask again, what sane company would pay to clear my road? 

... it'd be whoever owned said road. If its you, then you're responsible/can charge your neighbors. 

&gt;This is what annoys me most about libertarians, you just assume anything you need to make your model work. Of course there would be thousands of people down any given road.

I mean, you'd very likely be able to afford a snow plow or services with the huge reduction in taxes. 

&gt;A city government does the plowing, interesting. And who pays the city government to plow the roads? The people, through a tax.

eh a more accurate description is that 51% of the population decided to use force to make 100% of the population pay for a service. They also voted to use force against the 49% should they refuse and try to procure private service for their needs. ",2016-01-24 22:35:39+00:00,czahhdi,12.0,t1_czagt38,1060.0,PoliticalHumor

.... Then the other 5 stores would set travel restrictions on the road. Either the customer will pay the toll/subscription to access said business, or they wouldn't go. The business would lose out on money, and pitch in next time. 

&gt;Plowing roads is expensive, you are telling me that Walmart would plow miles of roads so that the ~5 people that live down my road might possibly shop at Walmart that day?

5? More like a few thousand. 

&gt; Not perfectly, and often there are mistakes, but the alternative simply doesn't work on any scale other than tiny.

.... good thing there are hundreds if not thousands of businesses. I mean, is it really that hard a concept for you to understand? The government collects taxes from these people, wastes money on paying its middle men, and then procures the product. That by cutting out the middle man, you could put the same amount of money toward getting more product. 

&gt;So is living on Mars, which ironically seems to be where you spend most of your time.

4929,"What you want in high school is different that what you want in college, that is different from when you start your career, is different from what you want when you're middle aged. 

Typically, most people can ride out high school and break up in college because their needs change. If it doesn't it winds up in marriage, and then one of you gets into your thirties and gets the ""itch"". 

Personally, if I were you, you need to sit down and take a long hard look at your relationship. You need to ask yourself if you see her providing for all your needs for the next ~ 50 years. Could you see yourself having sex with *only* her for the next 50 years?

When I was 18, I had this conundrum. Decided to call off a 3 year relationship, and started fucking around. I'm fairly happy I made that decision. 

You could also broach the subject of an open relationship. However, that'll probably add insult to injury. ",2016-01-21 00:08:00+00:00,cz5vl81,1.0,t3_41x25w,1799.0,AskMen

For example, Chicago fired all their school janitors because their pensions and whatever were too expensive, and then contracted ARAMARK to replace them.

So, teachers started immediately bitching about dust, dead bugs, and rats. Well, pest control wasn't ARAMARK's job, and they were only paid to show up twice a week. So that meant anything that showed up on monday would sit until the next scheduled cleaning.

By today's laws, sure, you're probably right. However, in a free market there would be greater leverage.

Pro-working-class: minimum wage, 40-hour work weeks, paid leave, social security;

Minimum wage actually hurts low skill workers, as they can't undercut better workers with lower wages. The 40 hour work week also prevents less potential for earnings, and sets a standard that makes it hard to bargin for less. Social security? lol the ponzi scheme that will be bankrupt in 30 years?

If you disregard logic, sure you're right. 

&gt;No - the ""free market"" is not total anarchy. We need a LOT of regulation in order to have a ""free market"".

[MRW reading this.](http://i.imgur.com/yxs6LKh.gif)

[Free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market)

&gt;A free market is a market economy system in which the prices for goods and services are set freely by consent between vendors and consumers, in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are **free from any intervention by a government**

emphasis mine. You are, by definition, wrong. 

&gt;No, try the complete opposite, and expect the complete opposite result.

Regulations benefit the rich. We should try more regulation! Ah, I understand now. 

&gt;They shouldn't be in the eyes of the government. The government represents the people of the USA - workers and citizens who rely on the government to represent them - not the corporate owners who can easily represent themselves with $$$.

Ah, so how much of a person is a rich person really worth? I'm guessing 3/5ths. 

&gt;You could ask any founding father, and invariably they would tell you the government's role is to represent the people who work and add value to the country, against the private business who always puts profit above the rights of the people.

The founding fathers typically looked at the common man as ignorant and foolish. Hence why only land owning white men could vote. [AKA the rich. ](http://www.infoplease.com/timelines/voting.html)

This is also why they did not want a standing army, because they feared should the government ever become tyrannical, non land owning men would be more loyal to a pay check than their fellow land owning betters. ",2016-01-15 22:37:38+00:00,cyzrfst,11.0,t1_cyzr3wi,507.0,PoliticalHumor

So, less regulation, aka more free market. This contradicts your previous statement. 

&gt;We need to go in the opposite direction of regulation - regulation that benefits the POOR and the WORKING CLASS, instead of the rich.

... So, try the same thing, and hope for a different result?

&gt;The 1% didn't get richer accidentally because there's simply more regulation - it was planned. The regulation they let pass benefits them, because the 1% control the republic (thanks Citizens United!).

5021,"&gt;Nah, it's free enough already. The rich are getting richer. It should be a little LESS free, at this point, and more controller to even out opportunities.

Lets put this logic to the test. You suggest that the rich have gotten richer over time. You also state that this can be solved by more regulation. Thus, for your premise to hold true, we should be able to see a noticeable reduction in regulatory bodies and law. 

[Here is the size and scope of the government illustrated over time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5-5a6Q54BM)

As you can see, the sheer size and volume of regulation has grown disproportionately over time. Thus, we have evidence that your original assertion is in fact, the opposite. The more regulation tacked on, the more wealthy the 1% gets.

5264,"&gt;We can collectively agree to all sorts of rights if they make sense. And wtf do you mean 'paid for by others'? Single payer healthcare systems are funded with tax revenues - we are all paying for it ourselves.

Lets think logically here. If ""everybody"" pays for their health care, then there is no need in single payer. The purpose of single payer is that higher earners pay for multiple people. For example, lets say jim produces 300 $ of value, but his health care is 500$. Under single payer systems, society covers that 200$. Society now has 200$ less wealth, because they destroyed it giving it to someone who couldn't offset the cost. The truth here is if you are poor, you are not paying for yourself. You are leeching off of everyone else.

.... This is patently false. The reason for health care price increase is regulation. The fact that it takes 4 years of graduate school, 4 years of residency, and like another 4 years before you're on your own is a huge barrier.

There is also the fact that the AMA prevented  no medical school from openings for like 20-40 fucking years in the U.S., and purposely limits residencies irregardless of demand.

I imagine that they could be similar. I'd have to see statistics by demographics and socioeconomic status.

Here you are railing about how john should just pull himself up by the boot straps and become more valuable, and then you quite literally turn around and demand a hand out from employers that they other wise wouldn't agree to.

5415,"&gt;Those two cases aren't even remotely the same. Michael Sam never even took a regular season NFL snap.

... He was an all american football player on a team that went to the SEC championship. 

&gt;An active mainstream superstar in the 4 major sports is completely different. Like on a different stratosphere. Do you really not see that? Are you just saying for you specifically it won't matter if he's gay?

It literally will change nothing. This is the same old tired shit that gets trotted out every time a minority or homosexual does something. 

jesus I remember Charlie Strong getting the HC position at Texas. There was a small, vocal subset of r/cfb that wouldn't shut up about how this was breaking down barriers and the greatest event in CFB ever. How it was going to change shit. 

Well, like 3 years later, ain't no body talking about Charlie Strong being the first black coach at Texas, cause no body cares. They just want a winning season out of him. 

The same exact shit is going to happen with the first super star homosexual athlete. It'll be in the news cycle for a bit, but then everybody else will promptly go back to absolutely not caring in the slightest that they're gay. 

&gt;Gay men have been pushed into silence in the sporting world for over a century, if it was really as minuscule as you say it would have happened.

The same was true for minorities, and the NFL got past that. Thats the point I'm making here. We're to the point that being gay in the NFL isn't abnormal. ",2015-12-23 21:53:32+00:00,cy9e42m,8.0,t1_cy9dgnr,1080.0,nfl

They add condensers to the turbine effluent to condense this steam into liquid again. The reason being is it is far cheaper to increase pressure on a liquid than a gas. They then pump it to a high psi in liquid form, and then feed it into the reactor. The increased pressure allows the water to absorb more energy before vaporizing. Which in turn is transferred to the turbine, thus completing the cycle. 

As for the condensers, it takes roughly the same amount of energy to vaporize a kg of water as a 100 degree C temp increase of that same water in liquid form.

However, for rifle rounds, this is different. They have two mechanisms of tissue destruction. One is the wound channel, like handguns. However, they also do all the rippling violent expansion exhibited in the post. This is called cavitation. This is due to the bullet creating extreme pressure differentials inside the body, and thus causing damage to tissue that extends radially past the wound channel. 

I can't be sure, but this looks like the 5.56. Which was developed by the military to maximize the cavitation aspect of wounding, as the geneva convention forbids the use of hollow point, or expanding rounds. ",2015-12-17 04:10:45+00:00,cy1vndr,2.0,t1_cy1swom,4904.0,woahdude

5632,"I don't really have a dog in this whole abortion fight. I just want to point out that every male's body from 18-25 belongs to the U.S. government, and at any time can be called to give that body in service of the government's interests. Refusal to agree to this sees your right to vote, and potentially freedom, revoked until you comply. 

So your argument is totally bunk, as there is historic, legal precedent of the government kidnapping people's bodies in service of its interest. So there is little on the way of stopping them from deciding that it is in the state's best interest to confiscate your body for 9 months so as to produce another citizen. 

Again, I'm not commenting on anything in regards to abortion. I'm merely pointing out that the whole ""not doing something with your body against your will"" is a falsehood. ",2015-12-13 18:01:01+00:00,cxxnnwv,4.0,t1_cxxmz69,1123.0,TwoXChromosomes

5634,"I think there is a huge disconnect between capitalists and collectivists. 

Collectivists are all caught up in who deserves what, and its mostly based on arbitrary metrics that conveniently benefit them. Additionally, their status of deserving of tribute isn't based on any actual results they've produced. Its merely that they tried. 

Why, that single mother is raising two children! She deserves a roof over her head and three squares a day! We should give her tax money!

Whereas the capitalist sees that she made multiple fool hardy financial decisions by having unprotected sex with dead beats, and has the gall to point out that she should probably stop doing that. In addition to understanding that by giving her money, it only encourages the bad behavior in her and others. 

Essentially, we're literally hitler for telling people to have better discipline, and explaining to them how to achieve it. ",2015-12-13 17:24:31+00:00,cxxmcvq,1.0,t3_3wn3i1,18056.0,Shitstatistssay

5636,"I can understand it. She is not an expert whatsoever on any policy or subject. She's just there to cry and get everybody's emotions running high, so they'll be easier to manipulate into voting with their feelings instead of their brain. 

Same shit happened after Sandy Hook. The democrats bandied about sniveling, grieving parents in front of various legislatures trying to get gun control passed. ",2015-12-13 15:57:36+00:00,cxxjoci,2.0,t1_cxx1jfs,50779.0,worldnews
