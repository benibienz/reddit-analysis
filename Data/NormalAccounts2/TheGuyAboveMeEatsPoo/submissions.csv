Our premise was simple. We fought for love. We fought because we love this nation. We fought for freedom, and the preservation of all civil rights. We fought for freedom of speech. 

They will also wonder *why* we were so upset with the status quo, and why 250,000 people banded together to have their voices heard. 

My answer is that you have to go back to the beginning to what Reddit's first iteration and mission were. I will tell you, I've floated around this site for years under one alias or another. I will also tell you what drew people to reddit, and that was pure and unadulterated truth. 

The anonymity of reddit allowed human nature in all its savagery to rise to the surface. People who dared voice an opinion would be challenged and beaten to death with sources if they could not hold water. You could post controversial ideas, and they lived and died by the content of them. People loved it for the conflict, and the brotherhood. Any idea, so long as it had merit, would be heard. 

Then came the emergence of the SRS and later on the social justice movement sometime in or around '13. This was the beginning of the end of paradise. These people took one look at the  humanity, and rejected it. They could only see the bad in this place. 

What was once a place for discussion and the lulz, suddenly became serious business. SRS and the SJW came to the conclusion that if they could prevent people from expressing their ideas in pubic, that they would simply kill the ideas. If a fact or post or whatever was inconvenient to the narrative, it was done away with. 

Thus, with puritanical like zeal, they began to infect the culture, and to change it. Their goal was to enforce strict social mores, and to punish severely or purge anyone whom question the orthodoxy. In the end, to drive out all thought crime from the website. They want the internet to be exactly like real life. 

Those of us old enough to remember, know that this once bastion of free speech is a shell of its former self. What we have today is painfully insulting and fake. 

This is why so many of us threw our lot in with the god-emporer. We look around and see a world built on falsehoods, corruption, censorship, and propaganda. The parallels of what has happened are the same as to what has happened to America.

We want nothing more than freedom, the truth, and prosperity. That is why when the Don threw his hat into the ring we knew he was genuine, and that he spoke the truth. That if we banded around him, he could break the narrative and tear the whole shoddy facade down, exposing the world and all its savagery. 

This is why we stood, and why we railed against the world. ",The_Donald,"My fellow 'Pedes, for posterity....",https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5brdok/my_fellow_pedes_for_posterity/

If they are focusing on Clinton's e-mails but being stonewalled by DOJ, the leaks would have continued. 

Thus, I speculate that the reason the leaks have stopped is due to the fact that there has been significant progress made in regards to the clinton case. Which, I surmise by recent FBI movement, to be the pedo ring bust. Why else would you focus resources on this given the national implications of the FBI's investigations?

She contemplated momentarily giving up booze, at least until after the election, but quickly drove such nonsense from her mind.

She felt uncomfortable. She tried to stretch, only to find her arms restrained. Hillary, not unaccustomed to her second child's broad fantasies, tried to recall the previous night.

Magically, two days later, Hillary Clinton is now under investigation again. What is interesting is that it is very clear from the photo and her slapped together press conference that this was not anticipated. Which means she isn't getting the insider info she's accustomed to.

I spawn onto a standard battle on the south side of Cliff. Check the player list to see whats on the other side of the map, and the meanest things over there are another T29 and a tiger, NBD. 

Decide that I'd try for the cliff perch next to the light house. Top tier, big gun, and a turret made of diamond. 

So, I start bebopping along and get about half way up the trail, when I hear the sound of tearing metal and my commander screaming we've been hit!!!!! Fuck, must be a light tank slipped by and on my ass. I spin around, and sure enough theres a little Tier 5 asian tank sticking rounds up my ass down hill. 

He's positioned himself at such an angle that my turret can't shoot him. Smart bastard. He'll have me half dead before I can turn around to get the angle on him, and my slow ass can't take the pounding to make it to the top. 

However, he made one grave mistake. He positioned himself on the outside ledge of the cliff, down hill of my fat ass. LEEEEERRRRROOOYYYYYYYYYY JENNNNKAAANNNNNSSSSS. I gun it into reverse, ram into him, and watch him go flying over the cliff. Having only lost 1/4 of my health. he lands at the bottom of the hill, half his health gone, and neither one of us can shoot each other. 

I proceed up the hill, hunting much larger game, figuring that the rest of my team will mop him up. Its early in the match. 

I assume my rightful spot as king of the mountain, and start raining body blows on anyone in sight. I've racked up a couple of three kills and several pens, when suddenly, I start getting shot in my ass. again. 

I swivel around, and its that same bastard tank. He clawed his way back up the hill after my ass. Now he's running literal circles around me, making sure to stay out of the way of my turret, as it'll mean certain death. 

BAM..... BAM.... BAM..... BAM.... I've bled out 600+ HP to this asshole. Then, the stars align in my favor. I manage to get my body and turret turning in the same direction, my sweep is faster than his orbit. 

The scrappy bastard realizes whats coming to bear down on him. I can see the panic rise in him as he breaks off his orbit and speeds wildly for the edge of the cliff. Heading left to right. He knows he's dead as soon as I pull the trigger. His only hope is to take his chances with gravity. 

10 feet.... 5.... 4... 3.... 2... He realizes he's not going to make the ledge, he swerves left hoping for the miracle his thin steel will deflect the round or that the change in direction will screw up my timing. 

Again, misfortune finds him. My aim is true, and a 105 mm shell lands broad side 1/3 of the way from the rear of the tank. The hit is catastrophic, and his tank erupts into a ball of fiery death for all of his surviving teammates to see. 

I take a moment's respite to assess my wounds and damage. I have less than 200 HP and look like a block of unappetizing swiss cheese. That was the most tenacious fight I've ever had, and I've had easier time taking down tier 9s in the same tank.
