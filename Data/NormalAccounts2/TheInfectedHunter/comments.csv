100,"I agree that from the standpoint of the characters and the humans in the movie he's still massive, but when they show Godzilla walking amongst building and being shadowed by them, it almost ruins it for me, I want to feel the power and sheer terror of this monster, I used to feel this way as a kid, and I think upscaling him to atleast the height of the tallest building in Japan, rather than the height of an average office building, then it would bring that terror back, make him seem like he is bigger than the constructs of humanity around him, just like a real force of nature. 

The destruction could still be epic, they could show off the destruction in a whole new way rather then what they've shown for the past 60 years. Instead of walking beside a building and wiping it out with his tail, he could crush a building with his foot like its nothing, it would make him feel more unstoppable, though he doesn't necessarily need to be much more unstoppable, if the military can take him down as is, with how powerful and indestructible he is already, then I don't think it matters how big he is.

The double pap is pointless in all of Black Ops 3 imo, Black Ops 3 got it right, again I don't attribute that feature to being Tranzit exclusive. They make multiple maps at the same time.

942,"I'm definitely not a casual player, I figure out all these complicated steps and I know what to do but when I try to go do it with friends, they die during the rituals, they complain about the complexity, and don't want to play it anymore. That's bad for someone like me who always wants to keep playing and tries to have fun with their friends who aren't nearly as much into zombies as I am. The maps are too complicated for casual players, they aren't going to look up these steps or even care about doing them. They just want to jump on and kill zombies but they are tied down to these Easter egg level steps just to do basic things. 

I think Treyarch is honestly taking Zombies in the wrong direction, they might have a plan for the rest of Black Ops 3 but just based off what we see from SoE, we are diving way off course from what made us fall in love with zombies. The maps have always been challenging, there were always steps to unlock pack-a-punch but now it's ridiculous. There is a balance between fun and complex and they should model that off the Black Ops maps. Black ops 2 is when things started getting unfun for casual players in my opinion.

And some people might say that they care more about the hardcore players than the casual players, and that might be true, but that's the problem here. They are basically poking us and throwing more and more complex stuff at us just to see what happens without realizing that every other player is being turned off from their maps.
