*Wind*: It could give you an ability like the one inch punch in Origins but obviously a lot weaker, basically just giving you a stronger melee and it can push the zombies back to give you an easy escape (though this seems kind of overpowered).

*Electricity*: This one is already covered in the form of Electric Cherry, which is fine because counting Widows Wine this would be 4 new perks in Black Ops 3 which is the same as both Black Ops 1 and Black Ops 2.

**Yellow**: From what we can tell, yellow eyes means Samantha, but it's also the default color, when no one is in control. But maybe Samantha never had full control and yellow eyes isn't actually her color indicator.

**Blue**: Blue is obviously Richtofen, that is the most consistency we've had with the eye colors, so it's all good here.

**Red**: We can gather that red eyes equals some form of ancient evil, like the Apothicons, which makes sense for Revelations or even Mob of the Dead, but we still don't know why they're red in Gorod Krovi. We never got an explanation and we probably never will. But if the red eyes mean Apothicon control then why aren't the Zombies eyes red in Shadows of Evil? And we also don't know why Samantha is ALWAYS the announcer when the Zombies have red eyes, this just makes no sense, is Treyarch just too busy to bother with recording new lines for the ancient evil? Or is the demonic voice actually not Samantha even when she is in control?

I hope that somehow all of this can be tied up in Revelations, this is the biggest loose end that has yet to be tied up in my opinion. What do you guys think?

But I don't understand why. I'm going to attempt to explain my reasoning and hopefully help everyone see from my point of view on this.

* There are many references in Tranzit and other maps that suggest that it takes place in the 60s. The cars, the art work on the sides of building and on billboards, the loading screens, all in a 1960s art style. 

* Nuketown: I do not care what anyone else says, Nuketown has to take place in the 1960s, after the end of the multiplayer match. Yes, I know that multiplayer and Zombies are not the same universe/timeline. But even in the original Zombies timeline, it only makes sense for it to take place in the 60s. The town is modeled after 1960s nuclear testing site. The zombies ARE the multiplayer soldiers, along with other zombies in hazmat suits. The mushroom cloud from the multiplayer match is still there.

* Why Tranzit and Nuketown take place at the same time: You hear Marlton in the Nuketown bunker, why we hear him is still a mystery but he is in there. The CDC and CIA agents are there, and also on the Tranzit maps, and as we know now, every map is canon. 

* Explaining the advanced technology on Tranzit: This an advanced world, a world where both Germany and America are using 115 based weaponry. We see this on Five, which also takes place in the 60s. Who's to say that this tech didn't start making its way into everyone's everyday lives, that's how it works in real life, military gets technology first, it's on store shelves after that. This would explain why there's a robot bus driver, in a town that has its own underground government lab.

* Die Rise: Yes, there are Zombies in Die Rise wearing 2025 soldier uniforms. There are also pieces of rock and rubble floating in mid air, I believe that this is because of 115 displacement. It's bringing in assets from another timeline, another dimension. The same way there can be an American old west town in Africa on Buried. It doesn't make sense just as much as on Die Rise.

I'm probably still going to get downvoted and some people are not even going to bother to read my points. But my opinion isn't going to change because this is what I whole-heartedly believe in. It's what makes sense to me. People like JohnyJ25 completely dismiss the ""Tranzit is in the 60s"" truthers out there. Which I think is unfair. This is a community and story built on theories. And I still choose to believe in this one.

Edit: And yes I know that the new comic description says that it takes place in a fractured future earth. We've yet to get the comic series, we don't know exactly what this means yet. Just like in my theory, Die Rise could technically take place in the future but Tranzit still doesn't have to.",CODZombies,Why I still believe that Tranzit takes place in the 1960's,https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/4w64wv/why_i_still_believe_that_tranzit_takes_place_in/

What if there was a show on TV, Netflix, whatever, that chronicled Richtofen's work at group 935, everything from the discovery of 115 to the outbreak, and maybe even beyond, telling the story of WaW and Black Ops 1. 

It could be like The Walking Dead where it's loosely based off the source material but still be faithful to it. Just showing us everything we heard on the radios as one big story, and actually showing what Richtofen, Takeo, Dempsey and Nikolai did at all of these places instead of just slaying zombies. 

I came up with so many scenarios that got me pumped for a show that doesn't even exist. Like imagine them at Shi No Numa, when all of the sudden things get eerily calm and quiet, and then a thunder storm starts brewing in the distance, there are lighting strikes going off in the background as the gang look confused, then one of the lightning strikes land right in front of them and it's a hellhound, that's how they introduce them into the show. And it would have already been set up earlier when they showed what happened with fluffy in the teleporter. And viewers will already know that there's a supernatural presence in the show because of the MPD.

I don't know about you guys but I think that this would be something amazing to watch, and a huge success even with people who don't play video games if done right.

I made this meme here below as a total gag based off this guys looks resembling the actor who plays Kylo Ren: https://imgur.com/gallery/xuJiq 

But after reading up on this guy I made a fascinating discovery, this guy was the original Wedge Antilles, one of the X-wing pilots that died in the Death Star run. He was replaced because he was not able to deliver his lines properly.

So my totally serious yet outlandish theory is that this guy maybe did have a secret affair going on with Leia. Obviously the timelines don't match up because of Kylo Ren's age, but, what if he ran off, decided he didn't want to risk his life in this battle because of the deep love he had for the princess.

This would be a seriously selfish act seeing as the battle was for the fate of the Galaxy, but people will do crazy, selfish things for love.

I'm suggesting that this guy was around in the rebel alliance even after Return of the Jedi and the fall of empire. Even after Han Solo and Princess Leia supposedly ""officially"" got together. And him and Leia had a child together that grew up raised by Han and Leia.

The WaW and BO1 maps are anywhere from 5-7 years old now, it makes sense for them to remaster those. 

Plus CotD and MotD both have big Hollywood actors as the main cast that they would have to bring all back for new lines and have to pay them all over again, probably way more than normal voice actors. So I don't see that happening.

What I do see happening is them remastering each of the 4 Black Ops 1 maps that had the original 4 characters. Kino Der Toten, Ascension, Shangri-La, and Moon.

Kino and Ascension are probably the most heavily requested maps to be remade, so it makes sense, especially to be following the Origins crew.

Shangri-La and Moon go hand-in-hand, with the focusing stone and all, this version of Richtofen is trying to set things right and with the moon music playing during the Shadows end cutscene, it makes sense that we would be going back to Moon.",CODZombies,"If we are getting a remade map in each DLC, it won't be Mob of the Dead or any Black Ops 2 map",https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3sk5m5/if_we_are_getting_a_remade_map_in_each_dlc_it/

I miss gritty dark war settings, I miss the creepy tones and uneasy mood set by realistic locations, with backstories that related to real life occurrences.

I think where things started getting unrealistic and arguably uninteresting was around Shangri-La/Moon. Two wildly out of this world maps.

Nacht- Gritty overrun World War 2 bunker

Verruckt- Creepy German World War 2 insane asylum

Shi No Numa- World War 2 Japanese swamp, with relation to real life meteor crash site

Der Riese- World War 2 Nazi research facility

Kino- Creepy abandoned Nazi theater

Five- Pentagon (While this one is crazy and unrealistic, it's still set in a real life location with real life historical figures)

Ascension- Russian missile silo

Call of the Dead- Boat crash site somewhere in Siberia/movie set, I guess (This for me was where I stated getting turned off from Zombies, I liked the actors in it, but everything about it seemed ridiculous to me, this is where Zombies stopped being creepy to me, I liked the creepy aspect of Zombies)

Shangri-La- Mystical tranquil land by name/possibly on the moon or Mars.

Moon- Area 51/The Moon (This map was originally going to take place in Paris, which I feel would have been an infinitely better idea. Being able to go into the tombs would definitely help keep the classic creepy, dark feeling. I also would have rather had a map taking place solely at Area 51)

Tranzit- Post-apocalyptic small town on earth (Admittedly, I loved the setting of this map. It felt gritty and dark, when Black Ops 2 first came out it was incredibly creepy. Not knowing was in the fog, getting lost, all the secrets that we were left searching for for months after the games release, Tranzit was a guilty pleasure of mine. It felt more grounded in reality than previous maps. This is when Treyarch started implementing gimmicky features that would be necessary to get around maps or even do basic tasks, the bus)

Die Rise- Wtf even is this map, upside down buildings in bumfuck, Hong Kong or some shit. On god hold me back

Mob of the Dead- Alcatraz island 1930's (I fell in love with this map immediately, and still am in love with it. It brought back the creepy factor full force, it felt gritty and realistic. However my least favorite thing about it is all the ghost stuff, which was the gimmicky feature for this map. That completely brought me out of it and ruined that suspension of disbelief for me)

Buried- Old Western town in.. Africa... (Undoubtedly a fun map, but things like the witches and Huckleberry were very gimmicky and silly. The witches were creepy at first but quickly became a simple annoyance that you had to learn how to deal with)

Origins- World War 1 trenches (This map was a fun callback to the old days of World at War, but still wasn't nearly as gritty or realistic, the giant robots and the whole thing with the staves ruined the realism for me. Still one of the best maps of all though)

And now we're at Black Ops 3 and while we are getting a remake of Der Riese we will have to see how much they've changed and what exactly they're hiding from us about it. Shadows of Evil looks like a fun experience but is definitely lacking in realism with what we've seen in trailers and leaks. We'll have to see what comes.

I hope my rambling and nitpicking isn't annoying, this is just my opinion and me telling what I miss about our beloved gamemode, and what I hope to see to come back.
