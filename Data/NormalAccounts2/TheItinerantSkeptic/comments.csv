0,"At the end of the day, purchasing most any game without reading reviews of actual gameplay, etc. is a crapshoot. It just is. If you buy on console you at least are able to typically return the game for store credit or at least trade it in for something else; if you buy PC you're kinda hosed in that respect.

Preordering for some is a guarantee they'll get it. If they don't live near a chain gaming store that does midnight releases, or if they're in a rural area where the nearest store only gets a limited number of copies, they run a very real risk of not getting the game on release day. They could always use Amazon, but even then they're running a risk.

Preordering a game is a way to insure you have your game when you want it. The way the game industry works these days, we're all paying them to beta test their games; it goes from the truly not-ready-for-release (like almost every Bethesda game ever because they're so freaking huge) to the mostly ready-for-release-but-has-a-few-game-breaking-bugs (most BioWare titles).",2016-11-17 02:44:22+00:00,da3ostm,1.0,t3_5dcu2c,8004.0,masseffect

2,"I mean, groups should do what works for them best, but I've been playing tabletop RPGs for 31 years now. Rolling stats seems most natural to me.

Sure, it means you can have some really unfortunate stats (I'm playing a dwarf Monk with a Charisma of 4 right now), but those are great opportunities for more experienced role players to make memorable characters.

It also means some players will just be flat out better at things than others. To me, that's fine. Everyone is generally better at one thing than someone else, but not all people are created equal. It doesn't matter how much working out I do, what kinds of foods I eat, I'm never going to have a body like Brock Lesnar or in-his-prime Arnold Schwarzenegger (sp?). I just won't. I'm not built that way. I'm sadly built like an inverted triangle stuck o a plane: I have broad shoulders, and in prime shape things taper down to my waist until it goes a bit wider again all the way down to my feet. I'll angle towards ""wiry"" in my upper body.

The goal shouldn't be numerical parity in stats in the party. The goal should be making characters whose personalities their individual players enjoy portraying, whose class abilities they find fun to use, and who will work together well with the other players/characters.

I can always point back to classic groups like the Heroes of the Lance from the old Dragonlance books: no one would have ever considered letting Raistlin be the spokesman for the group when they had Sturm or Tanis there. Likewise, no one would have put Flint or Caramon near a magical puzzle that required thought and nuance when Raistlin would have obviously been more suited to handle things.

No one is letting my dwarf Monk handle anything diplomatic. He's overly flatulent, rarely bathes, and honestly isn't all that bright (he has an Intelligence of 9). He's good at sussing things out and being intuitive (has a high Wisdom), he's reasonably strong, and he's quick. He's who the party would turn to if they needed to figure out whether someone was lying to them, or in a fight if they happen to be caught without their weapons. It's just the way things work out.

This said, I don't think it'll be the case. Mass Effect has always been very story-focused, and that's such a main pillar of the franchise that attempting to move in the direction of a more general open-world Skyrim-style game (like DAI did) seems out of character to a point that BioWare wouldn't let happen.

16,"WWE World Heavyweight Championship Match - Triple H vs. Roman Reigns. No DQ. More of the writing team trying to convince us that Reigns is the ""it boy"" for WWE, when it seems more likely he's just a placeholder until Seth Rollins gets off the injured list.

Hell In A Cell - Shane McMahon vs. The Undertaker. If 'Taker loses, it's his last Wrestlemania match, if Shane wins, he gets control of Monday Night Raw. Hard to call; this is 'Taker's last year on his contract, so this might be his send-off, but Shane isn't full-time, he's a nostalgia act, and it could be nearly as ignominious an end to 'Taker's career to lose to Shane as it was to see Sting's last two (and only WWE) matches be losses.

No Holds Barred Street Fight - Dean Ambrose vs. Brock Lesnar. My suspicion is this is going to be an opportunity for Dean to display his 90s-era-quality bump-taking skills and further shore up how seemingly indestructible Lesnar is. Dean might manage a win, though, because every encounter he's had with Lesnar in the lead-up to this has wound up with him getting his tail kicked.

Chris Jericho vs. AJ Styles - More buildup for Styles now that he's in WWE. Jericho has returned to old-school heel mode, and is jealous of the audience's adoration of Styles. I predict Styles winning.

Divas Championship Triple Threat - Charlotte vs. Becky Lynch vs. Sasha Banks. The continuation of the Divas Revolution. I'd love to think Becky Lynch can stop playing second-fiddle to both Charlotte &amp; Sasha, but the reality is I think this'll end either with Charlotte retaining the title or Sasha winning. It seems abundantly obvious from audience reaction that she's become the new standard-bearer for the Divas Division. She's crazy over.

Handicap 4v3 Tag Match - The New Day vs League of Nations. I don't know if this is for the tag titles or not, but while I'd like to see The New Day win, since they're now generally acknowledged as babyfaces &amp; something needs to be done to make League of Nations seem like a threat &amp; not just a collection of former threats that aren't otherwise involved in major individual angles right now, I suspect the League of Nations will come off with the victory on this one.

Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match - The abuse of a title that used to mean ""This guy is the next in line for the WWE Championship"" continues. Kevin Owens vs. The Miz vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Sami Zayn vs. Zack Ryder vs. Sin Cara vs. Stardust. The whole thing is likely to come down to being Kevin Owens vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Sami Zayn, and I don't see anything happening other than Owens walking off with the IC title.

17,"Friday night was my first time seeing the guy, and he blew my mind. It was an awesome send-off for Sami Zayn (and a nice nod to ""doing business""; more often than not you're supposed to lose in your ""retirement"" match), and an introduction to Nakamura.

Problem is, I don't foresee him being well-used if he makes it to the main roster. As it is (and this surprises me), NXT is misusing Hideo Itami. If he's being underutilized/misused there, he has few hopes in the main roster to ever be anything other than a mid-range mid-carder, probably not operating at a greater level than the U.S. Title.

NXT has given us a lot of amazing people, but they seem to suffer when they hit the main roster. Neville is key among these to me; he was amazing in NXT, but he's a jobber for Kevin Owens on the main roster. The Ascension was a fun tag team in NXT, and they're next to nothing on the main roster; they're ""enhancement talent"". Seems weird to say given how awfully they're being used, but the Dudleys have more value as a tag team in WWE right now than The Ascension does.

Adam Rose was terrific in NXT. Now he's near-faceless in The Social Outcasts.

Given Bayley's loss to Asuka, my suspicion is she's going up to the main roster pretty soon, but I'm not confident in her doing well. She's very much an ""old school babyface"", and WWE has traditionally been failing with those ever since people turned their backs on Rocky Maivia, until he switched it up and became The Rock. Plus, strange as it is to say, it's almost feeling like the Divas division is glutted right now; Tamina, Alicia Fox, Natalya, and even Paige at this point are all second-string players while the focus is (not without cause) on Charlotte, Becky Lynch &amp; Sasha Banks.

I would love to think Nakamura could be a serious contender on the main roster: the guy has a spectacular, charismatic entrance, his movement in the ring can't be ignored and draws attention even when he's taking a beating, and he has a memorable look.

History is suggesting he'll be a mid-carder at best on the main roster. :(",2016-04-03 17:22:25+00:00,d1o99mn,2.0,t1_d1nqs3x,48483.0,WWE
18,"Part of the reason BioWare has set the whole ""Knights of the Old Republic"" timeline so far before the movies is so the movies wouldn't have to feel ""obligated"" to nod at that continuity (not that they do now anyway; SWTOR is now part of the ""Star Wars Legends"" alternate timeline; Disney took the entire Extended Universe post-Jedi (and ancillary content) and shuffled it off into an alternate timeline to clear the debris for the new movies to tell whatever story they wanted to without being saddled with 20 years of post-Jedi and pre-Phantom Menace continuity).

It's strange to me, but I've met people who just don't care for the movies, but like the Star Wars universe (though to be honest, if you took Jedi &amp; the Force out of it, it's a very generic, fairly unremarkable science fiction cliche). I've even met people who, for some bizarre reason, have their kids watch the movies in chronological order instead of release order (which completely undercuts Vader's big reveal in Episode V; some kid watching that will just think, ""Well...

20,"That we're getting new story content AT ALL in a game that's gone F2P should be blowing our minds. As I noted in another post, most games, after going F2P, go into a ""maintenance mode"" where no real advances in the story or world occur (beyond maybe an annual change of a few things). They live off whatever revenue is brought in from their microtransactions.

I get why Knights of the Fallen Empire isn't a continuation of 8 class stories, but a single unified storyline. Once we're done with our class stories, we are, in theory, at the pinnacle of our careers. We exemplify the stereotypical Jedi, Sith, Trooper, Smuggler, etc.

Story is the primary focus of this game, and all its mechanics need to serve that purpose first. On top of that, new game content takes awhile to develop, and I imagine the TOR team isn't as large as it may have been in the past, which further limits the kinds of new content that can be provided.

If you believe metrics aren't what are driving current dev decisions, what do you believe are, in fact, driving them?",2016-04-01 20:37:56+00:00,d1m8mbq,4.0,t1_d1m71k4,2212.0,swtor
21,"I'm not necessarily rejecting out of hand what you're proferring, BC.  In this case I'm honestly making a pretty simplistic statement and drawing some inferences that feel logical based on past experiences.

I was with SWTOR at launch. I was in the beta. I remember login issues, and watching my roommate put his mobile phone on speaker and have to PLUG IT IN because the wait with BioWare's customer service reps was literally hours long to deal with log-in issues.

I ran a Sith Marauder at release, and made it about halfway through 49th level before other things happened in my life and I had to stop playing. I eventually just didn't come back. I heard about the game going F2P, and figured that was the end.

I came back about three weeks ago (at this point), and have discovered, as I'm leveling my Jedi Sentinel, that the game is still fun, and the restrictions from the Preferred account I was transitioned to were onerous enough to make me pay $30 for a 60-day subscription.

I've been playing BioWare games since the Black Isle days, when Baldur's Gate was new. The one hallmark of BioWare has **always** been story. That's always been their focus.

It was the one thing they used to differentiate themselves from World of Warcraft when this game was first hitting the gaming public's awareness: the ""missing"" pillar of story.

Like any new AAA online game, there were people who came into SWTOR from WoW, and they carried the expectations of, at that time, 8 years of WoW development with them, believing that any new MMO would, by necessity, have to have ""everything"" WoW offered, with WoW's problems fixed, AND present more, in order to be ""successful"".

They showed up believing the goal of the game was to hit the level cap and start raiding, to do the same gear up/put the raid on farm/get a new, harder raid in 3-4 months and repeat again until a retail expansion was released. I think this might be where endgame raiders started getting frustrated when new ops weren't really showing up even at the speed that Blizzard puts out a new tier of raids.

PvPers, by their nature, are often a contentious lot who have serious concerns about numerical ""balance"" in things, as it's an objective measurement of whether they can have a ""fair"" PvP experience where wins/losses have everything to do with ""skill"" and little to nothing to do with some classes simply being, in a semi-objective fashion, ""better"" or ""worse"" than others.

So you have people who thought the focus of the game would be like WoW (level-cap raiding), and you have people who wanted a robust PvP experience, and neither got content at a speed they thought was appropriate (when otherwise accounting for the people in either camp who just don't understand the amount of time game development takes, and have unreasonable expectations of delivery times to start with). Consequently, they left.

It's my suspicion that the people who stayed after the subscription drops convinced EA/BioWare to go F2P are the people who may have had a legitimately dialed-in view of what the likely focus of this game is (and was) : it's a story simulator. When you're doing side quests in the midst of your class story (if you do; I'm not right now), even mousing over a questgiver shows you that they're going to give you a quest related to a given planet's story.

This game, as with most BioWare games, is all about story. Looking at Dragon Age and Mass Effect, as well as even Knights of the Old Republic (I don't count KotOR2 since it was actually developed by Obsidian Entertainment), and the default difficulty settings don't make for a mechanically difficult game. In all cases, you're basically going through an interactive novel that gives you some fights to keep you actively engaged vs. passively clicking through dialogue options (however well written they are).

It thus isn't surprising to me that new development on SWTOR is so story-focused. The fact that we're getting regular story updates in a F2P MMO is mind-blowing enough, as other AAA-grade MMOs that have gone F2P give you, at best, an annual update, and more often just maintain the status quo at the time the game went F2P and pull in whatever revenue they can from microtransactions.

This isn't to say that EA isn't doing the same, because there are an awful lot of quality-of-life improvements you can buy with Cartel Coins, some of which remain Cartel Market-only features even for subscribers (I had to drop Cartel Coins on changing my character's hair style, for instance, despite being a subscriber and instead just paying a relatively small fee in galactic credits like I would to change hairstyle in WoW). 

But while WildStar and Rift sit there in almost exactly the state they were in when they went F2P, we're getting very regular new content updates from BioWare on this game. It isn't content the raiders and PvP crowd want, and what they want is equal in validity to what story wonks like myself want. If this game were to shift its focus to endgame raiding or PvP, I'd probably not purchase another 60 days of sub time when it came time to renew. It doesn't mean BioWare would be making a ""bad"" choice if they went that direction, it just means they'd be making a choice I wouldn't want to support.

So I get why people who want something different from the game may not be happy with the current development direction, but it isn't because BioWare is objectively doing something ""wrong"", it's just that they're doing something that some people don't want.

Even staying subscription-only as it is now, WoW still prioritizes PvE content over PvP. They HAVE a story, and rich lore, but they don't have the in-game focus on story that BioWare does. At the end of the day it's still FedEx quests and ""Collect &lt;x&gt; of &lt;y&gt;, then fly back here."" You do that til level cap, then you start running harder versions of the dungeons you ran while leveling to get gear that'll let you into the raids without being one-shot by trash.

Trust me, if BioWare ever orients a new expansion strictly towards endgame content and PvP, you'll find the story wonks up in arms and proclaiming the game's death as it ""caters to elitists"". You can't keep everyone happy, but so far, evidence seems to support a proposition that they're keeping enough people happy that their overlords at EA aren't telling them to change development direction, or aren't mandating that the game shuts down entirely.",2016-04-01 20:27:30+00:00,d1m86qt,6.0,t1_d1m6ho5,2346.0,swtor
22,"You're welcome to your opinion on the game, of course, but it sounds like you want content that may not be the focus of the game.

The Old Republic is not a fully ""traditional"" MMO. It has a major focus on story that others don't, and since development resources are limited, that means that sometimes some elements of the game get more attention than others.

BioWare is tracking a lot of what we do in the game, and their metrics are obviously showing that where most players are engaging with the game is in story content. Thus, we get new story content. It isn't to say that we won't get new raids at some point in the future, or new PvP content, but that isn't a focus in the game right now.

That said, the tease is just that the project he's discussing has the word ""Knights"" in it. We could have a new Knights of the Old Republic coming.

23,"In general it's unfair to compare, well, **any** MMO to World of Warcraft. They've had nearly 12 years of consistent development. MMOs that have come along since have had things people wanted in WoW, but didn't yet have. The flip side of that is not having all the nuanced quality of life improvements that WoW has, like a well-developed endgame, integrated PvP, polished classes, etc. WoW already made all the worst mistakes and suffered through the development errors early on; they still make errors, but now they're the king of the hill, and have stayed so for over a decade. They STILL remain the only AAA subscription-only MMO on the market, and their numbers are low compared to the height of the game, but they're still at 5 million paying subscribers, while games like SWTOR, while very fun and awesome, boast around 1 million total players (both subscribers &amp; F2P) tops. Their numbers will spike, possibly by as much as another million, when Legion comes out this summer.

This aside... the Mists of Pandaria story was fairly well-told, though I think the height of WoW's storytelling and game play appeal still remains Wrath of the Lich King. Dealing with a petulant adolescent Horde Warchief got old pretty quick, and he quickly turned into a pinata for getting heirloom weapons to use for leveling in Warlords of Draenor. I didn't like Burning Crusade and didn't like Warlords of Draenor, so I'm forced to conclude that any/all visits to Outland/Draenor are, for me, just a dealbreaker now.

The big distinction of The Old Republic from WoW is its greater focus on storytelling. You feel like it's ""your"" story (even though every Jedi Knight is getting the same story from 1-50). In WoW, you feel like one hero among many, but not particularly distinguished (though it sounds like that may change with Legion). You were ""one of the heroes"" who defeated the Lich King. You were ""one of the heroes"" who killed Deathwing. You were ""one of the heroes"" who smacked Garrosh Hellscream down enough for Varian Wrynn &amp; Vol'jin to come in and mop up.

WoW is probably the last major bastion of a ""traditional"" MMO experience. I think a better way to think of The Old Republic at this point is a semi-sequel to Knights of the Old Republic 2 with a very robust multiplayer suite.",2016-04-01 17:36:52+00:00,d1m0ruo,1.0,t3_4csasq,70680.0,swtor
24,"1) I fully predict Shane *will* win. Undertaker's contract is up this year, so this was likely to be his last Wrestlemania anyway. It was hoped his final match would be with Sting, but Sting's, well... ""stinger""... in his match with Seth Rollins last year kind of ended that. I anticipate a strong followup Raw this Monday night.

2) I don't think Bischoff is likely to be coming back any time soon. There's a strong likelihood that at some point he'll get inducted into the Hall of Fame, because he was honestly one of the greatest heel managers since Bobby Heenan.

It's my hope that the writing team in Stamford sees that the Authority thing has been played out. We're once again in a position where every single title is being held by a heel (the New Day have transitioned back into being faces again, but it's almost an afterthought that they have the tag championships), and eventually audiences just get tired of it. You can only spend so many years milking a babyface in a constant cycle of chasing a title, getting it, getting screwed out of it, and going back to chasing it again. This isn't the era of the years-long babyface championship run like we had with Hulk Hogan, but we've gone a long time without a strong babyface (that wasn't John Cena...) as champion.

I don't think Shane'll honestly be around for the long haul like Stephanie has been, so his likely win on Sunday will probably give us a month or two of watching the heels suffer a bit before things return to ""business"" as normal and some kind of heel authority figure (hopefully someone other than Stephanie, Triple H or Vince) gets back in charge again.

To be honest, I think it's about time for a Seth Rollins face turn. Roman Reigns would honestly work a lot better as a heel than the face they keep trying to shoehorn him into. I'm holding out hope for a Rollins return this weekend.",2016-04-01 16:27:26+00:00,d1lxrjh,1.0,t3_4ctbbd,52171.0,WWE
25,"If you pick a higher-population server, you'll do quite well. I've found the community to be friendly and helpful, something I attribute to the game, in general, having a lower population than a game the size of World of Warcraft, League of Legends or similar tentpole franchises. Chat is generally on the quiet side, but it also isn't overflowing with nonsense lolcat posts.

Prices on the GTN (Global Trade Network, the auction house) can be high on some servers.

If you're big on story, this is the game for you. None of it is canonical since the EU stuff got shuffled off into alternate-timeline-land after Disney purchased LucasFilm (it's now all part of what they call ""Star Wars Legends""; they did it to free up story points for the new movies without them feeling like they had to be constrained by 20 years of generally well-received EU novels and tabletop RPGs), but it's still great stuff.

If you're big on endgame raiding, PvP, etc., this may not be the game for you. That stuff is there, but it's very obviously not a focus, since all the new development is for story content.

26,"To be clearer on this, bonus dice of damage probably wouldn't get maximized in any fashion, just the strict weapon damage itself. In the above-noted example, a Rogue attacking with a dagger and receiving 5d6 of Sneak Attack damage would receive 4+1d4+5d6+static bonuses.

To be honest, I've often thought that a critical should just be a flat doubling of your damage to reduce fistfulls of dice (often a problem with Rogues in 3rd Edition). In that scenario, this dagger-wielding Rogue, on a crit, would roll a d4, add their static bonuses, multiply it by 2, then add in the Sneak Attack dice.

It STILL completely confuses me that critical hits have so often been about rolling extra dice when the critical hit has a damage multiplier involved. A critical hit should be CRITICAL.

32,"Basically, if you can find it at all on www.d20pfsrd.com it's ""open gaming content"", meaning it falls under the Open Gaming License (the OGL).

The OGL was established back in 2000 when Wizards of the Coast first introduced the 3rd Edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Pathfinder is based off the 3.5 revision to that ruleset, with a few tweaks made to clean up some rules inconsistencies. Paizo, the people who publish Pathfinder, started off making modules for Dungeons &amp; Dragons during 3rd Edition, and eventually took over publication of Dragon Magazine &amp; Dungeon Magazine from WotC.

The purpose of the OGL was to let third parties make content to be used with the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. They couldn't specifically say ""Compatible with Dungeons &amp; Dragons"", since Dungeons &amp; Dragons was a trademark owned by Wizards of the Coast, but they could say, ""This module is compatible with the third edition of the world's most popular role playing game"" or something similar, and could use the d20 System logo.

The hard rules (""the crunch"") is all open content. This means the ability scores, Saving Throws, classes, skills, feats, equipment and spells (that don't contain a specific character's name) are all usable by anyone as long as they include the appropriate legal boilerplate indicating its compliance with the OGL. You'll notice, for example, that there's a Handy Haversack magic item in the Core Rulebook (it's a backpack version of the Bag of Holding). In Dungeons &amp; Dragons, they call it a Heward's Handy Haversack, but ""Heward"" is content that's trademarked to WotC. It's their intellectual property. So third parties who want to avoid paying royalty fees to WotC (if they can even get permission to use it to begin with) will instead just call the item a ""Handy Haversack"".

For Pathfinder, the Core Rulebook is all OGL. The world stuff (""the fluff"") is copyrighted to Paizo Publishing. This means that references to Golarion, the Hellknights, the Pathfinder Society, any of the nations in the Inner Sea area, etc. are all copyrighted to Paizo, and couldn't be used in non-Paizo material without their permission, but an 18th level Fighter with a Strength score of 26 using a Flaming Longsword +3 can certainly be referenced. The gods of the pantheon in Golarion can't be referenced, but any ""divine entity"" that's straight out of real-world mythology could be.

Adventure Paths are typically not part of the OGL. They contain story content and other intellectual property owned by Paizo Publishing. References to the Core Rulebook are OGL content, and can be used to your heart's content.

If you're not sure if something is (or isn't) part of the Open Gaming License, look at www.d20pfsrd.com Everything on that site is free to use how you like.",2016-03-29 20:27:54+00:00,d1i5pyv,1.0,t3_4cg638,14855.0,Pathfinder_RPG

34,"I've taken most of Warlords of Draenor off, and in fact am currently figuring out whether I want to continue supporting Blizzard games at all after the recent brouhaha over the Tracer pose from Overwatch happened. 

This said, I've really had 4 ""mains"" in the time I spent in WoW (November of 2004 to just prior to the first major patch for Warlords of Draenor). From November of 2004 to the launch of Burning Crusade, I played a Paladin. Shortly after starting questing in Hellfire Peninsula, I figured I'd irrevocably screwed up her build, and moved over to make a blood elf Warlock, which I played until about the last month or so of BC, when I swapped over to a night elf Druid. That was my main until probably about a month after the Ulduar patch in Wrath of the Lich King, when I made a draenei Death Knight. While there have been a few race changes in that time (draenei to dwarf to draenei to worgen to night elf to draenei, which is where she currently sits), that Death Knight stayed my main until I took my break during WoD's early days.

If I choose to stick with Blizzard games, it means I'll probably return to WoW with Legion's release, at which point there's a good chance a Demon Hunter will become my main. If it starts feeling like more of the gear merry-go-round again, combined with ridiculous requirements from a guild to even get into their raid (the guild I was in when I quit, which previously had ""casual progression"" as a focus, had decided for Warlords that to even get into a guild raid, you needed to have Gold in Proving Grounds to be considered, because leadership was fluctuating and they decided to cater to the elitists/progression raiders), I'll stop again, and that'll be WoW's last chance with me.",2016-03-29 18:48:07+00:00,d1i0viv,1.0,t3_4cey6w,27941.0,wow
35,"There is currently a Change.org petition going that people who disagree with Overwatch's dev team's choice to remove the Tracer pose can lend their name to.

36,"After poking around on the Overwatch forums and reading a sizable portion of the thread that Jeff Kaplan posted in, here's the reality as I see it:

1. One parent took issue with a pose from Tracer that seemed to emphasize her butt more than this particular parent was comfortable with as they thought about their daughter growing up with these characters.

2. They expressed their discomfort on the beta forums.

3. The lead game developer responded that the concerned player was right to be concerned, and that it would be changed, then made an additional post to clarify Blizzard's position, stating that it was something they were thinking about doing all along.

The problem is this comes off as disingenuous. Worse, it comes off as pandering to the socially-conscious crowd who have become such a major part of the gaming discussion of late. It's sickening that it took something like Gamergate &amp; unjustifiable threats against people like Zoey Quinn &amp; Anita Sarkeesian to bring this poison to the forefront, but now that it's here, it's being used much like any other hot-button issue: as a platform to leverage a political agenda. In this case, as a platform to leverage the agenda of some feminists to remove depictions of women that they personally feel are being turned into ""sex objects"", ostensibly to the general harm of women everywhere.

It's inconsistently applied (at best) in the entertainment community. Steel Panther can do songs denigrating fat women or using a romantic partner as a domestic slave and get away with it because it's comedy, it's ""fun"". Melissa McCarthy can do a female-centric Ghostbusters reboot that's all about turning gender tropes on their heads (right down to using Chris Hemsworth as their receptionist in response to Annie Potts' original role).

Blizzard can support art showing Sylvanas Windrunner or Tyrande Whisperwind in provocative poses, and no one blinks. No opposition is raised, and the only harm done to World of Warcraft has, in general, been more a result of slowly declining subscription for a 12 year-old MMO than because of women being misrepresented or ""unfairly"" sexualized.

BioWare emphasized ""FemShep"" for Mass Effect 3, and no one batted an eye, despite all of her character art emphasizing a very toned physique that her armor didn't cover up in any fashion. The female Commander Shepherd is capable, focused... and sexy.

At this point, despite Mr. Kaplan's claims to the contrary, it looks very much like the Tracer pose is being altered as a sacrifice on the altar of political expediency: ""Let's make this change while we're still in development so a particular special interest group doesn't get upset and potentially damage the marketing of our game before it even goes live.""

I can handle a company supporting politics I don't agree with; I can't handle a company making changes on something that really shouldn't matter one way or the other just because one parent's politics got vocalized and caught the attention of a developer. The timing is what makes it suspect: as people like Anita Sarkeesian gain political cachet in the gaming community without regard to whether something is ""actually"" good for the community or merely representative of one of a diverse set of equally-valid perspectives, for Blizzard to make a change like this at this time creates the unavoidable risk (whether justified or not) that they will be indelibly linked with this political perspective, which results in harm to their own ""integrity"" in the gaming community, making them appear willing to bend to whatever direction the current political winds are blowing instead of standing strong and, while acknowledging the dissent, responding with, ""This is the artistic choice we made, and we aren't changing it without a solid reason, which we haven't so far been provided.""

This puts me, personally, in a position I never wanted. I've loved Blizzard games since I first picked up Diablo on an endcap at Target in 1994. I played World of Warcraft from 2005 to 2014. I continue to play Diablo 3, and just bought Heart of the Swarm to expand my Starcraft 2 installation. I've spent money and time on Hearthstone. I've been very active in their forum communities, I've paid money to attend BlizzCon in 2010, I've bought merchandise.

And yet now Blizzard is making me wonder if I can continue to support their games. In this instance, not only do I not agree with the politics behind the original concerns raised over Tracer's pose, I disagree with Blizzard's seeming willingness, despite claims to the contrary, to let this upset direct their design decisions.

I'm put in the unenviable position of either ceasing to play games I otherwise enjoy in order to maintain my personal politics, or to compromise my personal ethics and keep playing the games.

I don't think this is a position any gamer should be put in, which is why I don't think video games should be involved in politics at all, unless the design intent is to provide a legitimate real-world simulation. A video game about being a special ops agent trying to save the American President from some terrorists is rife with politics, by nature. A video game about some comic book-style heroes/villains shooting each other up shouldn't be, whether those politics are related to government or social issues.

So now I have to figure out what has to take precedence: compromising my personal ethics in the name of fun, or compromising my fun to maintain my personal ethics.

If you or someone on Blizzard's Community Team are reading this, Mr. Kaplan, let me just say: there was no reason to put any players at all into a corner like the one where I now stand. There was no reason to reduce this to a binary.",2016-03-29 14:52:10+00:00,d1hppy6,1.0,t3_4ce0nq,36052.0,Overwatch

41,"She did an interview recently where she noted that she hasn't been able to make some solid connections with the other divas because she was out so long with her injury, and she's working on repairing those things.

The problem is I don't think being a sports entertainer is actually her primary focus. I think she's there to grow the ""Natalie Eva Marie"" brand. Trish Stratus was a fitness model before she entered WWE, but once she was there, WWE was her focus, and once it couldn't be any longer, she retired. Conversely, there were several women who were valets for Scott Steiner in WCW during his ""Big Poppa Pump"" phase where it was obvious that they weren't there to wrestle, they were there for eye candy; they tried turning Midajah O'Hearn into a wrestler, but she's a model, and was never going to be anything else. April Hunter still wrestles in VERY small independent leagues, so kudos to her for trying, but I'd be curious to see if she ever tried out for WWE after the Performance Center and NXT became what they are now.

She has enough ""natural"" ability that she can probably fake her way through things, but I don't think the Total Divas show is doing any of the actual wrestling-capable divas any real favors for in-ring credibility. ""Mandy Rose"" came in #2 on Tough Enough, and to her credit immediately went and tried out on her own and got a contract. But I think she's hurting herself by being on Total Divas instead of staying focused on NXT itself, where she should be doing what women like Dana Brooke, Alexa Bliss and Bayley are doing. You don't see those three women on Total Divas. To be honest, I'm surprised Paige is on the show. I don't see Charlotte on the show. I don't see Becky Lynch or Sasha Banks on the show, and didn't even see them there when they were in NXT.

But you DO see the Bellas, Eva Marie, Mandy Rose, etc. on the show. These are women who are focused as much (if not more) on their beauty as they are on being capable in-ring performers. This has always been the case with the Bellas, but both Nikki and Brie have shown repeatedly that they actually CAN wrestle.

I think if a diva gets injured or isn't involved in any meaningful storyline, the show might not be a bad place for them to get some screen time to stay in the WWE Universe's orbit of awareness. The problem is, I don't think people who are in developmental should be on the show if their actual goal is to become a main-roster performer. If it isn't, if their goal is to occasionally wrestle and otherwise make a brand for themselves as a ""model"", one wonders why they're in WWE to begin with.

Bayley, Sasha, Becky, Charlotte, Paige, Alexa... they all interact very well with their fans on social media (particularly Twitter). Watching Eva Marie's Twitter account, all her tweets are either self-aggrandizing links to the latest Total Divas episode, or the tweets come off as overly-crafted P.R. statements that show nothing of **who** she is. She doesn't even play the heel on her Twitter. Hell, once Chris Jericho made his recent heel turn on A.J. Styles, the ""feel"" of his social media immediately changed: it's almost like he's keeping kayfabe alive on Twitter.

I think Eva Marie has the potential to be a good performer, but I think her focus is split. The trainers &amp; coaches of NXT likely realize this, and Triple H isn't stupid either (not by a LONG shot; it's kind of scary how smart that man is). I don't think she's ever going to be more than a Tamina-level diva midcarder unless she puts aside the ""I'm a model, and I wrestle sometimes"" vibe she gives off, and starts focusing on BEING A WWE PERFORMER.

47,"Sell them on Ebay if you're looking to dump them. In theory the 3.5 library is still compatible with Pathfinder, but as the years have gone on, Pathfinder has kind of drifted from complete compatibility with the 3.5 material; they're at around 85% compatibility at this point, though there's some awesome content in the 3.5 books that can be converted with minimal effort to a Pathfinder game.

49,"So if it's any aid at all, the latest D&amp;D adventure, Curse of Strahd, is intended to start once players are 3rd level. To get them to that point, a mini-adventure, ""Death House"", is included in the adventure. It has a dual purpose: to give players a taste of what the Ravenloft setting is like (it's gothic horror, not the standard high-fantasy of default D&amp;D), and to get them to 3rd level so the adventure can start in earnest.

Before the point when players would be getting to 2nd level using that adventure's milestone leveling system (it goes for milestones instead of XP values), a treasure trove in the house has a few spell scrolls in it. So in short, the game is generally assuming that for pure mechanical balance, finding spell scrolls at 1st level isn't out of the realm of normalcy.

Wizards gain a few spells naturally as they level, meant to represent ""research"" they're doing (it's assumed that during party downtime, while camping, etc., the Wizard is likely scribbling in their spellbook to work out theories, etc., that eventually gel as a ""real spell"" at the appropriate time in their advancement). To get more spells than that, you're looking at spell scrolls &amp; ""found"" spellbooks from treasure troves. 

You **can** copy spells from other Wizards' spellbooks, but traditionally (and this may be different in the world you're playing in), Wizards are pretty jealous of their spells (those spells represent the work they've put into their craft, so it isn't given away without serious cost, and as Wizards can be eccentric and often socially awkward/unlikable, they may still not want to give anything up). Sometimes they have ethical concerns as well. A locksmith in the real world *can* show you how to pick a lock, but the first question they're going to ask is, ""Why do you want to know?"" Even if they see another locksmith, they may share some commonly-known methods, but they aren't likely to share with any ease little ""Tricks of the trade"" they've picked up on their own.

In the same fashion, a Wizard may have no problem letting you copy *Magic Missile* out of their spellbook for a straight gold cost, but they may wonder whether it's worth any price if you're asking for something more rare like *Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion*.",2016-03-21 16:45:22+00:00,d1809b4,1.0,t3_4bc66x,13082.0,dndnext

They would have sworn up and down that both those game elements were ""bad game design"". TSR even realized they may have been on to something (as an option, of course) when they introduced the ""Player's Option"" set of rules to 2nd Edition in its twilight days before the WotC buyout happened. One of those PO rulesets went for specific hit location tables, as well as diminishing PC capability the lower hit points went. They also tried for called-shot systems in that same set of products.

I despised the Player's Option materials in a way I haven't despised anything in D&amp;D since 1st Edition psionics. :(

Those 80s and 90s non-D&amp;D games experienced a not-inconsiderable amount of success, though not the true longevity that D&amp;D has had.

In fact, I've yet to have a single complaint from the players I've had over 31 years of playing the game when I implemented critical fumble rules (which in 3.0/3.5 were a lot more punishing; you lost a Standard Action to recover from a critical fumble (though in fairness in that system, since you had to have a confirmation roll to get a crit, I required a confirmation roll to get a critical fumble as well; if you missed on the confirmation roll it was a fumble, if you ""hit"" on the confirmation roll for the natural 1, it was just a normal miss). In fact, in every campaign I ran where I used critical fumble rules and asked the players (usually after their first session with the rule, then several sessions later, and finally at the end of the campaign), they indicated they had fun with it.

63,"I suppose if one is sitting there constantly calculating odds and using them as a justification for doing (or not doing) something, what you're saying starts to carry more weight. I'm working on my own experience (which, to be fair, is not inconsiderable; I've been playing D&amp;D for 31 years now, with a fairly even split between playing and being the Dungeon Master over those years).

Prior to 5th Edition (which I'm still weighing, and want to see for a few more years to see if any subsequent rules bloat adjusts my final verdict), 3rd Edition was, to me, the pinnacle of D&amp;D development after it reached 3.5.  It had its problems (a ""rule for everything"" leads to huge books, which were a pain to carry around in the days when I couldn't just have a library of PDFs on my tablet; the ""rule for everything"" also gave a pretty strong advantage to players who angled for numerical optimization; this was usually reined in by not assuming everything published outside of the Core Rulebooks was on the table), but it was still, by and large, an amazing system (which is one reason why I continue playing Pathfinder; I well and truly love the d20 System).

It was during 3rd Edition that a lot of my house rules initially came into effect, in particular my critical failure. I had played around with having a critical failure actually have a chance of harming someone else in the party, but the general reaction to that was wariness at best, and rebellion at worst, particularly once players started carting around powerful magic weapons and spellcasters could suddenly get a critical hit with ray spells. So I adjusted it to instead penalize the player for the critical hit in a way that ""kinda sucked"", but wasn't likely to end in death or massive loss, and held relatively little direct threat to other party members.

The consideration you're presenting on the Volley issue for Rangers is one I hadn't thought of; I'm going to have to poke around and see if I can find a way around it that I like, but if not, that might wind up being a valid reason to reconsider the effect of a critical fumble in 5E (though it won't be a valid reason to remove critical fumbles altogether).

I should also provide some clarification: the bow/crossbow isn't ""destroyed"" by a critical fumble. It comes unstrung, jams, etc. The Bonus Action successfully repairs it as though it never happened. The critical fumble is a temporary setback (costing you merely a Bonus Action to fix; I was originally going to have it cost a full Action), not a permanent one.",2016-03-18 19:59:01+00:00,d14wuni,7.0,t1_d14u6vu,3846.0,dndnext
64,"I'm removing that complication at my table, because I don't personally see it as necessary.

Casting a spell that has a casting time of 1 Action presumably takes the same amount of time/effort as swinging a weapon, which also takes 1 Action. The difference is, you can swing a weapon as your action and still have a potential Bonus Action (or take your Bonus Action first, as Rangers often do for things like casting *Hunter's Mark*), which could be another attack if you have an ability that costs a Bonus Action and provides said additional attack. 

Meanwhile, spellcasters are provided an exception to this basic action economy which I don't personally like, which is why I'm removing it at my table. They can cast a spell, and have a Bonus Action, but they can't use this Bonus Action to cast another non-cantrip spell, **even if its listed casting time is ""Bonus Action""**. I dislike this proviso. This dislike is sourced in the nerfs to magic from previous editions which I personally found unnecessary (and had no small number of arguments over way back in the days of the ""Nerf Magic Foundation"" on the 3.0 WotC forums). Since, I've seen magic receive steady nerfs which I don't personally like. First it was the adjustment from 3.0 to 3.5 for *Haste*. Then it was the reduction in power and ""awesome factor"" for magic items like the Holy Avenger. Then it was allowing successive-round saves against spells that someone initially failed a save against. Over the years, magic has received steady nerfing and very little homeostasis or active buffing. Removal of ""save or die"" effects kinda makes sense. Letting someone break out of *Hold Person* 1 round after they were initially affected, to me, doesn't, as an example.

So for my table, this is the adjustment I've made. It maintains a consistency to the action economy I think was harmed by applying a proviso to it for spells, and also serves to ameliorate the self-defined ongoing nerfing of magic the game has suffered.",2016-03-18 18:55:48+00:00,d14u875,8.0,t1_d14tr5i,638.0,dndnext

Now, onward.

Once we get into defining ""different kinds of Actions"" like ""Cast A Spell is the 'Green Lantern Power Ring' of the game"", we start getting into very subjective areas, at which point any and all approaches remain valid at their individual tables. Maybe this is a case for the action definition bloat of 3.5/Pathfinder (Standard Action/Move Action/Swift Action/Free Action/Non-Action), but that flies in the face of what WotC wanted to accomplish with 5th Edition, which was to simplify things to keep it new player-friendly (an effort that's yielded great returns, as it didn't take more than one session for my friend's 15 year-old son and 12 year-old daughter to figure out how to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons; they're now a standard part of our biweekly group). So we come down to the 5E definition, which is ""You get 1 action in a round, plus possibly a bonus action."" Casting [insert spell here] takes 1 Action. Swinging your weapon takes 1 action. Perhaps the need arises to have the ""Spell Action"" become a new action type? It removes subjective things like this, which while fun to talk about still result in small inconsistencies arising like I've noted.

I agree that doubling on ""action spells"" with one as a cantrip maintains numerical balance in the game, but I disagree that allowing an ""action spell"" and a ""bonus action spell"" in the same round contributes to numerical imbalance on any meaningful scale.",2016-03-18 17:46:54+00:00,d14r9h1,6.0,t1_d14qr87,716.0,dndnext

Regarding spellcasters getting higher level spells in previous editions... yes, they did. To me, that still didn't equate to greater *efficiency* (which to me comes as a result of greater general knowledge of your profession), it merely equated to greater *power*. You knew more about magic in general, which let you use more powerful magic, but you somehow never learned enough about magic at a fundamental level, below even optional-choice feats, at the fundamental class level (which in theory represented your general experience &amp; knowledge as a spellcaster), to get **more** magic out in the same span of time it took you to get less when you were less experienced.

I don't like the inconsistency of it, to be honest. Someone can take a Bonus Action and still have their Attack Action (or in the other order), and I personally equate the Cast A Spell Action with an Attack Action. 

In a broader sense, it's bothered me for years that while martial types got more efficient with their primary method of output (more attacks per round), spellcasters never really did. They learned to cast **more** spells each day, but they could never cast more than one spell per round without the use of feats or *Haste* (in 3.0), and then 3.5 nerfed *Haste* so it would grant an additional attack, but not grant an additional Standard Action, which stopped spellcasters from using it to get off more than one spell per round. I know there were always arguments that spellcasters were too powerful to begin with, and this reined them in, but to me, it just stuck in my craw that a 20th level spellcaster had the same basic efficiency as a 1st level spellcaster, but a 20th level Fighter was a whirling dervish while the 1st level Fighter was happy to swing once in a round. It's just a personal thing, though. It isn't something I've ever refused to join a game over. :)",2016-03-18 16:29:34+00:00,d14nwg3,2.0,t1_d14mfy6,2064.0,dndnext

It all started with the massive alteration to *Haste* between 3.0 and 3.5, a change that to this day I despise (and in fact, in my Pathfinder campaigns, *Haste* uses its 3.0 wording and not its 3.5 wording).

This is, generally, in keeping with the nature of Ravenloft when it was a 2nd Edition campaign setting: a relatively low-magic world, and the magic that *was* present was usually warped in some fashion by the nature of the demiplane.

Curse of Strahd is an adventure to run for atmosphere a lot more than just killing monsters &amp; taking their stuff. It's meant to be ""gothic horror"" in a fantasy setting. Things are going ""really well"" when nothing horrible is happening to people, i.e., people are fine with the day to day oppressiveness of living under a darklord (who may or may not be undead; most citizens of Barovia don't know much about Strahd von Zarovich's actual nature, but several have strong suspicions they know are better not to delve too deeply into) as long as they aren't being actively killed by the things that go bump in the night.

90,"I totally get what you're going for on this one, Matt. I do. This may even be a kneejerk reaction on my part to having to deal with this sort of thing day to day as a byproduct of the city I live in.

It might have gotten lost in the mammoth post(s) I made (which wouldn't be the first time that's happened to me; I have diarrhea of the keyboard), but I noted that for groups that want to make this an issue in their game, they're welcome to it. I just don't want to be a part of such a group. It has nothing to do with a disagreement with the notion (I highly favor being as inclusive as possible, to the point that it honestly doesn't even occur to me to actively think about it; a person is a person before they're an ethnicity or a gender/sexual identity.

I typically play in the Forgotten Realms, which as I noted, is a cosmopolitan setting. The Seven Sisters are as famous as Elminster or Drizzt, and on their own terms, not merely in response to their interactions with men (Forgotten Realms passes the Bechdel Test!). In fact, one of the earliest Forgotten Realms novels, ""Spellfire"", starred Shandril Shessair, a woman. Bob Salvatore fleshed out the society of the drow, who are from top to bottom a matriarchy. Al-Qadim, a 2nd Edition campaign setting, was in the Realms, as was Kara-Tur, the Oriental Adventures setting. So was Maztica: right there we have inclusion of Middle Eastern, Asian and Aztec people just as a matter of course.

In short, the opportunity for a given player to find themselves and their fantasies in D&amp;D is as easy as using the existing default campaign setting for 5th Edition. In a DM-created world, if they want to tell a story of overcoming the oppression of an ethnicity or gender or lifestyle, they can do so. As a player, I'd want to know their reason for wanting to do that in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, not to cast aspersions on it, but merely to know if it's a campaign I'd want to join or not (I tend to avoid overly politicized content in my leisure, even moreso since it's a particularly brutal election year right now in America, and I'm just sick and tired of watching our candidates snipe at each other when none of them are people I personally want leading our country).

91,"I live in one of the most socially conscious cities in the U.S. The RP community here is large and diverse. To be honest I've never seen these issues come up. I've seen careful discussions of them among the *players* (careful because no one really wants to offend someone else in a group gathered for the express purpose of everyone having fun), but I just haven't seen it come up in the game.

Dungeons &amp; Dragons operates in the Forgotten Realms by default (apparently, at least; every published adventure so far has been set in the Realms). That world is extraordinarily cosmopolitan in its outlook. Active racism (and let me note that here it's actually ""racism"", because you're dealing with different races; what we call racism in reality isn't, since we're all part of the human race. It's more accurately called ""ethnicism"") is there (with generally good reason) against drow and orcs. Even the meanest, most isolated village would treat the appearance of elves or dwarves as a vast curiosity, not as a cause for immediate hatred or ostracism. In general, people in the Realms just take it for granted that while humans are the most numerous, they're by no means the most developed or even the most powerful. It's hard to compete in power or knowledge with a race (elves) who live for thousands of years (or may be functionally immortal to natural death, depending on what version of Realms elves you're dealing with). It's probably only the elves' general isolationism that's kept them from conquering Toril through sheer attrition of the shorter-lived races.

Consequently, ""racism"" for the most part just isn't something that would occur to most citizens of the Realms. Elves traditionally hate orcs (and vice versa), and most everyone hates the drow (who in turn hate most everyone else), but otherwise, the ""humanoid"" races tend to operate in a mostly peaceful state of detente (at worst).

Modern fantasy &amp; sci-fi fiction deal with these social issues because they're at the forefront of current social consciousness. Ethnic tensions are high in the U.S. because of the events in places like Ferguson, MO and because of issues with radical extremists from traditionally Middle Eastern faiths. There's nothing stopping a group who really wants to explore these issues in the game, but I don't think there are enough people who gather to game who would be interested in doing so as a justification for bringing the concepts to the forefront of a campaign's themes.

As regards the rape issue... D&amp;D has attempted to obliquely deal with it in the past, via 3rd Edition's Book of Vile Darkness (though I still really think a more appropriate title would have been ""Book of Mildly Uncomfortable Naughtiness""; I think more of its sales were driven because of the ""mature audiences"" tag on it than from the usefulness of its rules crunch). This said, if it's necessary for a story being told, then use it unless you know beforehand that it's going to be a trigger for someone in your group (when I was still playing World of Warcraft, we had some sexual violence survivors in our guild, and it was made clear to new guild members by officers that at no point was the word ""rape"" permissible in guild chat or on our voice chat client; its use was grounds for a single warning, and then ejection from the guild on a second offense). It should hopefully be something that heroes (which the game assumes the PCs are) would find distasteful and worthy of enacting justice over.

But the reality of many ""medieval"" fantasy worlds is that when it happens, it's often by people in positions of power (local or otherwise), and they often get away with it. Until very recently, it was presented as a common cause for the existence of half elves &amp; half orcs, as elves stereotypically wouldn't fall in love with a human, nor would a human stereotypically fall in love with an orc. What do local people do when their sovereign (whether a local baron or a monarch) just claims a commoner whether that commoner wants to be claimed or not? They don't typically do anything, and most of the time adventurers who wander through the area are only minimally more capable of doing something about that particular case than the regular populace is. Even in the U.S., if someone takes the law into their own hands to avenge a rape victim, they have become a criminal themselves. They need to go to the authorities to get justice, and that only works because we have a system where we have laws in place to prevent this stuff, and if those laws aren't enforced we can go to those who hold the local authorities accountable. That kind of complex, tiered authority system doesn't exist in most fantasy governments. There's usually a monarch or ruling council, the guards/constabulary they hire/conscript/put in place, and that's it. National ""courts"" typically don't exist: it's usually a local magistrate whose authority ends at the boundaries of their municipality, and on rare occasions cases could be appealed to the local lord, who very likely won't be bothered with a case like that. That's the verisimilitude in place.

It's better, I think, to just avoid it altogether.",2016-03-16 20:14:33+00:00,d12e76i,3.0,t1_d10zlng,88780.0,dndnext
92,"Okay:

Start, as always, with the Player's Handbook. Don't buy it at a gaming store or bookstore unless you have ethical compulsions to support local business. Buy it at Amazon and save around $20 off the cover price.

3rd Edition (or 3.5) continues now as Pathfinder, a game made by Paizo Publishing. There were some alterations to address what they saw as some problems with the version published by Wizards of the Coast, but it's still got a solid 85% compatibility with existing 3.5 material. If you were a huge fan of the system, I would point you at Pathfinder and encourage you to not get too hung up that it isn't a Dungeons &amp; Dragons logo on the books. If you have brand loyalty to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, this moves us forward.

4th Edition was a mistake, though it has its fans. It overly homogenized everything; every class had identical numerical capability expressed as ""powers"" that had different flavor (i.e., the power a Wizard used was called a spell, the power a Fighter used was called a Maneuver or something similar). It was mechanically constructed like an MMO, so all content assumed the traditional MMO makeup of a tank (or ""Defender"" in 4E terminology), a healer (""Leader"" in 4E) and a couple of DPS (""Striker"" in 4E). There are fans of the system. I'm not one of them.

5th Edition came just 5 years after 4E's appearance, showing the likelihood that WotC realized it had experienced a misstep. Part of it was the fracturing of the gaming community. People who loved the 3.5 system continued on with Pathfinder, whereas people who had brand loyalty to Dungeons &amp; Dragons followed it to 4th Edition.

5th Edition is a good, solid attempt to fix the existence of 4E. It's slimmed down so it doesn't have the rules bloat that 3.5/Pathfinder had, but allows a lot more freeform decision making (both 3.5 and 4th Edition had the ""we have to have a rule for it or you can't do it"" weakness) by just boiling everything down to an ability check with the Advantage (roll twice and take the higher result) or Disadvantage (roll twice and take the lower result) adjustment. In general, defensive numbers are lower (Armor Class), and offensive numbers are lower (damage, number of attacks, which for most tops out at 2 attacks in a round). Orcus is in the Out of the Abyss published adventure, and he has an Armor Class of 18 (which is quite reasonable even for a 1st level character to hit).

This said, it's VERY new player friendly, and you can make a character and be playing in 30 minutes or so, vs. the hour-plus it would often take to full flesh out the stats for a 3rd Edition character. It leaves the specifics of trying some things to Dungeon Master fiat &amp; player creativity instead of codifying a rule for everything to the point of forcing players who want to do well to become rules lawyers with the level of system mastery required (a common failing of 3rd Edition).

On to your class questions:

1. Every spellcasting class now uses a system similar to the Sorcerer for magic. You have a number of spell ""slots"" per spell level per day. You ""plug"" a spell into those slots on the fly from the spells you either know or have prepared (depending on your class). If you want more output from a spell, you plug it into a higher-level slot instead of the spell's output just automatically raising based on your spellcaster level. It allows more general flexibility for casters (it's no big deal if you prepared a spell you didn't use, as long as you got use out of your daily spell slots), but still clings to the last vestiges of the classic Vancian spell system by limiting output to an approximation of ""fire &amp; forget"".

2. Druid wildshape's biggest function now is as a damage shield. You acquire the stats of the new form (not just a higher Strength, Dexterity &amp; gaining some natural attacks, as in 3.5), including its hit points. When those hit points go to 0, you're forced back into your normal form, and if the damage would have reduced your animal form to less than 0, the carryover is taken from your normal form's hit points.

3. Rangers have some spells that let them change their damage into energy damage. *Lightning Arrow* is the one that immediately comes to mind.

4. Khajit are not a ""core race"" (i.e., in the Player's Handbook). I don't know if a 5th Edition conversion has been done via Unearthed Arcana on Wizards of the Coast's D&amp;D website (where a lot of that optional non-core stuff now shows up), but if not, it shouldn't be too difficult to do a conversion (if someone online hasn't already done one).",2016-03-16 18:37:37+00:00,d129u68,1.0,t3_4am9zl,50173.0,dndnext
93,"I like the ideas in this video, but the problem is this: it's cramming a particular political perspective down peoples' throats in a video series about introducing someone to Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Politicizing things past where some players want it to be is just as harmful as bringing in pre-existing notions of ethnic perspectives that may be exclusionary to other ethnicities.

Put another way, while the clash of ethnic perspectives are currently a big part of the 21st Century zeitgeist, they're also a source of significant frustration for people who just want to let it happen ""over there"" and get on with the business of playing D&amp;D.

In the last 3.5 group I was in about 6 months before 4th Edition had come out, we had a couple players who were Asian. They'd cycle out depending on where the school year was, because during the school year, one of them would be in town, and would leave during the summer, where the other was present during summers but was gone during the school year. We referred to them as our ""token Asians"", because the rest of our group was white people. **THEY** referred to themselves as our ""token Asians"". No one was offended.

But in the current social climate, it doesn't matter if neither of the Asians were offended, there are people who would now be ""offended on their behalf"" because they're so vehemently against negative ethnic stereotypes (or any ethnic stereotypes). Their hearts are in the right place, but the outworking of that isn't.

We have college students holding ethnic tension-charged rallies and demanding ""safe spaces"" for a bordered perspective (note I didn't say ""minority"" perspective; by ""bordered"" I mean ""This perspective is shared by a particular subsection of people who have some ethnic traits in common, that people not part of that ethnicity may share"") wherein *no challenge to the perspective is permitted*. They are seeking protection from people who disagree with them.

Without getting into whether it's right or wrong, I'll just say it's exhausting.

And it isn't something I want to bring into a D&amp;D game. D&amp;D is escapism. I work for a corporation during the week, where I have to be cognizant of those things, as does every other employee. I live in a socially-liberal city where tensions over things like ethnic stereotypes and perceived oppressions are hot-button issues. It means when I go out, I have to be aware of those perspectives to avoid an unpleasant experience in case someone gets offended, not over something I said directly to them, but something I said that they overheard and decided they didn't agree with.

And I just don't want to deal with it for the once-every-two-weeks, 6 to 7-hour D&amp;D sessions I get to enjoy. It isn't that I don't want to think about it, it's that I don't want to bring all the charged touchpoints from real-world political issues into the game, because that isn't FUN. Fun is my goal, whether playing or DMing. Fun is why I don't track encumbrance, make ranged types track ammunition or make spellcasters track components (those that are below a certain value threshold, that is). Fun is one reason I love 5th Edition, because unlike Pathfinder (which I find fun for different reasons), it doesn't require a codified rule for every possible action, it just lets the DM make shit up on the spot and hope that an ability check and the Advantage/Disadvantage mechanic will cover it.

In short, I don't want political correctness to be a motivating factor in any element of my games. I don't begrudge those who do, though it isn't my style. If I happen to join a group where I can see it'll be a thing, I'll politely excuse myself from that group. I haven't read an overly-politicized fantasy series since Gael Baudino's ""Dragonsword"" trilogy in the late 80s/early 90s. That was a fun series, but the political axe that author had to grind (feminism, in that instance) was so overpowering to everything else that a possibly enjoyable fantasy series (if otherwise unremarkable in execution) was greatly compromised.

It would be nice to think that in a series meant to help out new DMs who are introducing new players to the game, a passing statement about this could be made, but not an entire 12+ minute video.",2016-03-16 17:12:25+00:00,d12609r,1.0,t3_4ail3h,97230.0,dndnext
94,"It depends on the nature of the adventure in question, but on a broad level, I do things where ""fun"" trumps ""realism"", and it isn't fun to turn Dungeons &amp; Dragons into micromanagement on the level of a Real Time Strategy game. I typically don't ask players to track weight unless something specific in the game makes them need to (are you trying to cross a rickety, decaying wooden bridge? The guy in plate armor may have a rougher time of things than the halfling wearing leather armor). I typically don't ask them to keep track of ammunition. Someone adventuring in the wilderness with a bow as their primary means of defense/threat management is going to stock up on arrows. They'll refresh those arrows the next time they hit a settlement.

An example of where it's necessary to keep track of things like this is the ""Out of the Abyss"" published adventure. The PCs start off as prisoners of the drow, without their gear. They should try to reacquire it before setting off into the Underdark, but once they're out in those subterranean wilds, they're going to need to worry about things like supplies. Tracking ammunition, rations, water, etc. becomes very important at that point.

Are they in a desert, far from an oasis or other settlement? Tracking water &amp; food at that point becomes important. Tracking weight should *probably* matter, but still isn't fun, and for the most part should just be ignored.

Are they traveling through an area with lots of weight-sensitive terrain (thin crust on top of active lava flows, ice over a frozen lake in an arctic environment, lots of chasms of an ancient civilization with rickety rope bridges that have rotted over time, etc.)? Then weight starts to matter, and players should keep track of it.

I start asking them to keep track of their weight once they start doing unreasonable things. Is the Fighter carrying a virtual armory on them? Maybe it's time to start tracking stuff like that. Are they trying to cart out thousands of gold pieces apiece? That money weighs them down. Gold isn't a light metal.

If it's important to your story that their gear be stolen (I generally recommend against this; little is going to lead to a player mutiny quicker than taking their stuff for any length of time), then yeah, they probably left stuff in saddlebags that wasn't necessary when they were bedding down. They probably aren't sleeping in their armor. They probably have a single weapon near them if something comes on them while they're asleep, and likely something that they were eating and drinking. They probably have their bedroll and a blanket. If they're a Wizard, they almost definitely have their spellbook, because they know their capability in the wild is very reduced without the ability to refresh their spells via study.

The rest of their stuff is probably in saddlebags: spare weapons, armor, non-worn magic items, etc.

To me, at least, the game is about high adventure, not about wondering whether you can cram that last item into your backpack. I do outdoors stuff, which means sometimes space is a serious consideration. I need food, water, and some climbing/hiking gear. Being excessively weighed down is problematic if you're, say, doing a mountain climb. So you want to minimize your weight while maximizing your gear to cover eventualities.

It's gonna get cold the higher up you go. I want a down jacket. A huge-ass puffy coat designed by a rapper for urban people in a cold city doesn't make sense, even though it'd keep me warm. But a quality down jacket that compresses down quite a bit and can be clipped to my backpack or put into its main compartment matters a lot more. It doesn't take nearly as much space because its fabric is designed to compact, and its lining (quality down) naturally compresses down. The jacket from RocaWear or Baby Phat is a poor choice; the jacket from North Face or Outdoor Research is a good choice.

But that's the real world. This is a fantasy game where players have come to the table to be heroes; in their world, they're functionally super heroes (though not at the start; at the start they're only minimally more capable than the average citizen of their race). 

Super heroes aren't worried about stuffing the magical doo-dad into their backpack. They'll find a way.",2016-03-16 16:04:10+00:00,d122x16,1.0,t3_4aocjm,1605.0,dndnext

96,"This is a victim of the simplification of 5th Edition. Note I don't say that pejoratively, merely as a statement of fact.

It gets worse if you're operating under assumptions from previous editions (as many of us are/were). Lots of terminology has carried over, and often still means **mostly** the same thing, but the way it works out isn't the same. A key example is Opportunity Attacks. That was a rejiggered nomenclature of Attacks of Opportunity from 3rd Edition that first showed up in 4th Edition. In its initial implementation, a variety of things could provoke an Opportunity Attack: using a ranged weapon in melee range, casting a spell when in a threatened square, trying to trip someone, etc. Most of that carried forward into 4th Edition with just a rearrangement of the nomenclature (""Attack of Opportunity"" became ""Opportunity Attack"").

Now in 5th Edition, the only thing that's going to provoke an Opportunity Attack is if you move away from a foe without taking the Withdraw action (i.e., you can only safely move away from a foe if that's the only action you're going to take that round).

So anyone (if you assume widespread literacy) can read a scroll, but only a spellcaster can read a spell scroll. It would be easier to assume that in a world where books exist, people aren't going to commonly use non-spell scrolls as a medium for writing, but it is what it is.",2016-03-16 14:37:58+00:00,d11z9e4,1.0,t3_4al3oc,54289.0,dndnext

98,"Roman's problem is he has all the physical attributes Vince has traditionally wanted in a world champion, but he has none of the charisma. You imagine a toddler being given his action figure and referring to him as ""big strong guy"", but not even as big as Lesnar or Ryback. Over half the audience still boos him when he shows up on Raw, and he doesn't even have the same ability as John Cena to turn that around into an inspiring babyface promo. That's also the primary difference: there's something about Cena that, no matter how much of a top-tier babyface he is right now, if he had a sudden heel turn the audience would believe it. It wouldn't be like WCW's attempt to turn Sting into a heel after the initial heat during the NWO invasion had died down, in those final Vampiro days.

I have sincere hope that the Wrestlemania main event will involve Dean Ambrose. He's so over it's crazy. I love seeing Lesnar in the ring, but his stint as the champion last time was empiric evidence that we don't need a part-time talent holding the title. The WWE World Heavyweight Champion ought to be on television every week, and Lesnar's schedule doesn't point to that. He's awesome as ""special event"" talent, much like the Undertaker.

I'm frustrated and irritated that Triple H has the title right now. This is no knock on his in-ring ability or charisma, but he's an executive both in reality and in on-screen character. That's his niche now. Letting him win the title at the end of the Royal Rumble (by coming in #30 no less) has all the feeling of a semi-retired company leader having one last shot at glory because no one can otherwise tell him he can't have the belt. It smacks of the days of the Corporation when Vince or Shane would get over on Stone Cold and walk off with the belt for a couple weeks, or when Stephanie McMahon held the Divas title.

I would be just fine seeing the Wrestlemania main event change to Dean (with the title) against Reigns (as a heel), but I don't think turning Reigns heel will help, in the short term or long term, get him over as a fan-favorite. He'll never be that until he starts showing more charisma and improves his interview ability. His best role was as the silent, intimidating ""enforcer"" of The Shield. You knew when he got in the ring that someone was going to get hurt. These days he just comes off as the disaffected roustabout frat boy who chuckles at The Authority's threats until he gets beat down. Then he goes all animal-savage Samoan for awhile, and then goes back to being a physical presence with no personality to keep it interesting when physicality isn't going to be part of the segment.",2016-03-12 16:15:53+00:00,d0x8p2j,1.0,t3_4a3qfp,11892.0,WWE

He had his run as a world champion, and he now gets trotted out in a poor imitation of Piper's Pit before his minimal set is destroyed in the middle of someone else's feud.

100,"There's more to a push than mere television time (though of course television time is VERY important). Dolph Ziggler is on television nearly every week, and he hasn't had anything resembling a push since he won the match that put The Authority out for awhile.

A push isn't necessarily wins, but it IS storyline. Kevin Owens has consistently been in a push since his arrival: he's always put into identifiable feuds, and when he shows up on TV, there's something more than ""just a match"" happening.

A good example of someone who's been 'filler talent' for awhile now is R Truth (though I kind of dig the thing going on with him and Goldust right now). When he showed up, that was your cue to get up and go get a drink and snack. Whether he won or lost a match, it had no bearing on any storylines being told; he was treading water.

That's what it feels like with Neville right now: he's treading water. It could be the lack of personality: no one knows ""who"" Neville is, just that he's a great high-flyer (in an age where WWE has very few high flyers), wears a goofy cape (that's on the ramp before he's halfway down it) and has big ears. The audience pops when he shows up, they pop when he does a spot, they pop when his finisher is pulled out. He has all the *signs* of someone the audience wants to like, but he's not getting any storyline development that completes the package. His last storyline involved an (admittedly very athletic) actor from a weekly super hero series. If there should ever be a takeaway from WCW's failure, it should be that involving Hollywood in the ring should be a gimmick that has nearly zero bearing on any full-time WWE talent's ongoing development.

102,"If you tell your players, ""You can't do that"" for the sole reason that you didn't plan content for it or it would otherwise lead them far astray from your planned plot, you're ""railroading"". I've been guilty of it in the past, when I was still learning to be a GM (or at least one who had done more than just read the Dungeon Master's Guide). My worst incidence of it was in a Planescape campaign I was running back in 2nd Edition. I had laid out plenty of clues intended to send the players off to a particular plane (I don't remember which one). They were feeling peevish and decided they didn't want to do anything I had set out for them (which is a different issue, and still a pet peeve of mine as a GM; if you don't want to play the stuff I've prepared, that's cool, but don't wait til after the session has started and I've put in hours of preparation to tell me. Just tell me ahead of time and I'll either do something else or let someone else GM). So they immediately set off for the Hall of Records in Sigil to find a portal to a different plane. I didn't really want them to go, so I told them they weren't able to find any records. ""You're telling us that in the City of Doors, in the Hall of Records, there's nothing about a portal to this other plane we want to go to?"" ""Yes,"" I responded.

The session didn't last much longer, and when we reconvened the following week we had a different GM and we were rolling 1st level characters. :P

I railroaded them, in other words.

The proper thing to do would have been to let them go to the plane they wanted, and wander across things obviously too powerful for them, forcing them to run, and I could then just re-place clues I'd put in place to re-direct them where I wanted them to go.

If players feel like their choices don't matter, they're being railroaded, even if the GM isn't intending to do it. While there should be an assumed level of cooperation (""I've put together this stuff for you guys to play, and I assume you're going to want to play it"" meets with ""We want to play this game, and you've made some stuff to let us do that; so let's do that!""), ultimately the GM is the referee/rules arbiter/storyteller. The players are the ones making choices, and since it's the GM who decides what the consequences of those choices are, it always remains 100% in the hands of the GM to let the players' choices still take them where the GM has prepared content for them. And when the players go **really** far afield, welp... that's when you pull out the random encounter tables (if you're feeling kind) or go all open-world-RPG style and let the players discover that just because they're 4th level doesn't mean they're always going to be encountering CR 4 creatures. ;) I still shudder thinking about the 50th level super mutant my roommate met in Fallout 4 when he was only around 25 or 30...",2016-03-08 21:20:38+00:00,d0sj854,1.0,t3_49jn59,12403.0,Pathfinder_RPG

104,"Brie has dropped hints that she's likely to retire some time this summer. Daniel Bryan wasn't kidding when he said they wanted to have kids, and that isn't something they'll do when she's being thrown around the ring.

They were moving into having Lana become an in-ring performer during the Rusev breakup phase. She had a match with Summer Rae, and they were building a feud, then Lana broke her wrist and had to take time off. You'll notice she still hasn't been accompanying Rusev to the ring since her return. The audience enjoys seeing her, and the day of pure ring valets is gone (as evidenced by the fact that they're even putting Summer Rae in the ring, and they're working very hard to convince people via NXT that Eva Marie can actually wrestle).

I had thought that since Brie has basically outright said she's going to retire that WWE would have given her a final Divas title run by letting her beat Charlotte at Fast Lane, but it didn't happen. So they're keeping her busy while they can still milk good will from Daniel's retirement. The Divas title picture right now is full up with Charlotte, Sasha &amp; Becky. I don't think anyone considers Tamina or the others valid title contenders, and for some reason they just don't let Natalya wrestle. This is going to quickly make for a very inbred Divas division since Paige isn't in the picture right now, which is why they need to do another multi-talent NXT injection by moving Bayley, Alexa Bliss and probably Dana Brooke up to the main roster.",2016-03-08 17:42:23+00:00,d0s97xm,1.0,t3_49j3l1,6216.0,WWE
105,"There's a part of me that hopes Dean takes the title at Roadblock, though I honestly don't see them having a title change at a Saturday event limited to the WWE Network. It's the same part of me that hopes Vince will realize that people just aren't into Roman Reigns as a title-picture babyface. His demeanor, size and presentation all scream ""Heel"". Part of this may be that he's never really moved past the aesthetic he had in the Shield. The other part of it is a lack of vocal charisma. He just isn't entertaining on the mic. He's entertaining to watch perform in the ring (his moveset is limited, but they're all powerful, heavy-hitting moves, which Vince and Triple H are both fond of), but he does better as an Arn Anderson-style ""enforcer"" than a WWE Title-holding babyface.

As much as I love seeing smaller guys get the WWE World Heavyweight Title, the reality is the less size and physical presence they have, the more charisma and appeal they need. Since Shawn Michaels, the only truly entertaining ""small guy"" who's had the title has been Rollins. We've had guys who have the right ""size"" to look like a champion, but lack the charisma (Ryback, Big E).

Which leaves us with people like John Cena, who I'm sure at this point most everyone is tired of seeing with the world title. As has been the case for awhile now, Vince needs to shift his paradigm and start pandering to the WWE Universe a bit: figure out who the people have decided they love, and give them a legitimate push. Sadly, Ambrose isn't receiving a ""legitimate push"". He still comes off as being a distraction to keep people entertained since we have 6 weeks between pay per views instead of the normal 4.

The problem is, I don't really want to see Triple H in the Wrestlemania main event. The executive who gives an infrequent in-ring performance is not someone who should be holding the title; I thought they'd learned this with Brock Lesnar. The title should be on someone who's there week in and week out, not only doing promos but doing in-ring performances/matches at LEAST every other week. The last two people we had who did that are both on the disabled list right now (Rollins &amp; Cena).

The other problem WWE is experiencing right now is we've gone a LONG time with no babyface champion that the audience is actually behind. They tried SO HARD when they let Reigns have the title, but he held it at the end of the year, during a holiday break when no meaningful storyline advancement is happening. Right now the only babyface champion WWE has is Kalisto, and as much as I hate to say it, the U.S. Title only had meaning and real entertainment value when Cena held it. The rest of the time it feels like the unwanted little stepbrother to the Intercontinental Title (which has lost value on its own; it used to be the barometer for who WWE felt was the next likely viable candidate to be legitimately pushed into the world title picture). Fans can only get behind babyfaces put in a constant chase for the title for so long. We haven't had someone with the spectacular star power of Hulk Hogan or Stone Cold for years, because babyfaces almost never have the title, and when they do, they rarely keep it for more than a maximum of two pay per view cycles before it goes back to a heel who's going to hold on to it until close to the next Wrestlemania (if not beyond).",2016-03-08 17:31:57+00:00,d0s8ry5,1.0,t3_49hkqr,32967.0,WWE
106,"Some people are custom-made for a particular role, and in Orton's case, he's a natural heel. He only feels threatening as a heel; he can't pull off the ""I'm a badass who people like"" in any fashion remotely close to people like Stone Cold or Triple H.

Consequently, he's at his best only when he's a heel. There are some people WWE just shouldn't consider putting in a different role. Could you imagine (once she's on the main roster) Bayley as a heel? For that matter, look at the Bellas; Nikki can obviously pull off the heel thing, but Brie... not so much.

In recent years, Orton has expressed interest in basically being a part-timer. He wants to spend more time with his wife and kid(s) and doesn't like being on the road as much.

RP doesn't come easily to everyone. Some people are afraid of ""doing it wrong"", or coming off as cheesy, or something else. Work with him and make sure no one mocks him for attempting to role play, and congratulate him at the end of each session for trying and reaching past his comfort zone.

If he's upset when he rolls 1s, just let him know that even the mightiest heroes don't succeed all the time. A 1 is only a guaranteed failure on an attack roll &amp; saving throw; it isn't a guaranteed failure on skill checks.

Encourage him to add this into his RP. EVERYONE will cheer when the perennially unlucky adventurer manages to do something spectacular, particularly if his failure rate is otherwise higher than average.

As for getting people to pay attention, it all depends on the player. In the middle of combat, if a player can immediately take an action relevant to their circumstances (particularly if they've changed since the previous round) once their turn comes up, I don't care if they're looking at their phone when it isn't their turn (as long as they aren't watching a video everyone can hear; that's just distracting). If they can't, that player is told that they need to put their phone away during the session. But if you want to have a blanket rule, it isn't unreasonable to tell folks to turn their phones off while they're playing; movie theaters do it all the time. I might be a bit jaded on this, though: I have a smartwatch, and if my phone goes off, a glance at my wrist will tell me if it's important or not. If it is, I'll step away from the table if it isn't my turn, or let it go to voicemail or whatever and step away once my turn is over.

If he thinks RPing his character isn't fun, find out if that's because he doesn't want to/like RP at all, or if he just came up with a concept that isn't as fun to play as he thought.

These are entities who grant spells as powerful as *Miracle* to their Clerics, i.e., the ability to, through merely speaking their desires, reshape reality on a very localized level. Angels serve them. They rule entire realities. They desire it, and it comes to pass. Any mortal hero (or group of them) who would be so crass as to actually challenge a god to a fight would likely be treated as the most developmentally-disabled toddler: the god would laugh, and then merely remove them from their presence (if they didn't just slay them outright for having the sheer temerity to think they could stand against a god).

Avatars, however... those are something different entirely. Those are the gods taking a small part of who they are and stuffing it into a limited, physical form. They're usually quite powerful, but they can, in theory, be contended with by mortals. Using your idea, no PC would be able to stand against Zeus, but if Zeus chose to manifest to mortals, he would likely do so through an avatar.

Avatars serve to communicate that gods are infinite, whereas localities within the Material Plane aren't. They have to limit themselves to move through the mortal spheres. Avatars are also a safeguard against just what you're talking about: upstart mortals who have gained an uncommon degree of personal power and have the hubris to think they can take on a god. Sometimes, no matter how much gods would like to believe otherwise, a mortal actually manages to accumulate an appropriate amount of power to do something unexpected. Killing an avatar doesn't harm a god (though it's likely to frustrate it), which the god quite appreciates.

So using an avatar is a good way to let PCs ""fight"" a god, without them doing something the rules don't explicitly say can't be done, but which it's generally agreed is a poor idea. The gods haven't been formally statted out since 1st Edition's ""Deities &amp; Demigods"" book, outside of third-party material. There are a couple entities who might as well be gods (but aren't quite) who have been statted out, like Orcus or Demogorgon, but they're ultimately not gods (even though there are many cults to both the aforementioned demon lords; in fact, 5th Edition published a 1st-15th campaign called Out of the Abyss which provides stat blocks for several famous demon lords, including the ones I just mentioned).

If you want to make an avatar, you're likely best giving them 20 levels of a particular class, and between 5-10 levels of another class, along with some spell-like abilities (some at-will, some 3 times a day, a few once a day), Spell Resistance, probably damage resistance (&lt;x&gt;/Mythic if you're using the rules from Mythic Adventures). Even the avatar of a god is unlikely to travel alone: they probably have a few (disguised) ""lieutenants"" with them (probably angels or lower planar beings, depending on what kind of god you're talking about).

Even an avatar of a god is ridiculously powerful; a standard party of 4-6 PCs at 18th-20th level should come up against one at full capability and end the fight with 95%-100% of their resources spent, and possibly a couple deaths thrown in for good measure. The avatar of a god is an appropriate time to pull out ""save or die"" effects. They have a tendency to have powerful ""passive"" defenses like auras that dampen or outright suppress magic and/or psionics. If they're wielding something iconic (Thor's hammer Mjolnir, Zeus' lightning bolts, etc.), you shouldn't be letting that fall into the players' hands unless you have a good story reason for doing so: a god isn't going to let their iconic equipment fall into mortals' hands unless they intentionally let it go, and they never let it go permanently. Asmodeus might let enterprising mortals who have proven to be very devout worshipers of his have his Ruby Rod for awhile, or he might let a mortal hopped up on hubris have it just so it can wreck that (and other) mortal's life, but he'll always reclaim it. He's hundreds to thousands of millenia old: he's, at his worst, just flat-out better than the PCs.

Bestiary 4 from Paizo has Cthulhu's stats in it. Cthulhu isn't a god (he was just a high priest of some crazy powerful and undefined ""elder beings"" in the original H.P. Lovecraft ""Call of Cthulhu"" story, though still far beyond the capacity of mere mortals to deal with), but looking at his entry in Bestiary 4 is probably a good place to start to get some ideas of how to stat out a god's avatar.",2016-02-25 21:02:34+00:00,d0dqao7,1.0,t3_47kkwj,7878.0,Pathfinder_RPG

121,"This is an excellent opportunity for a role playing-based resolution to a conflict. If the party knows they're in the right, and the one they're opposing believes they're in the right but will wind up in direct opposition to the party by pursuing their course, the party should try to do everything they can to talk the NPC out of their course of action. If it doesn't work, and it comes down to, ""I'm going to do this, and you're going to have to stop me if you don't want me to"", then let it come to blows. Violence is (typically) an acceptable first response to an evil creature/NPC, but for someone who isn't evil, reasonable effort should be made by the PCs to try to end things peaceably before it escalates into hostilities.

If you have a Bard in your party, or a Rogue or other skill monkey with high Diplomacy, that player will wet themselves in excitement that their abilities can be of such major importance to the campaign.

Keep in mind that if things end in hostilities (and a fatality), there are repercurssions for the party's actions: they just murdered an otherwise law-abiding, presumably ""innocent"" person. If you're in a frontier area, they can probably get away with it by just having their wrists slapped and possibly be exiled from the area by whatever baron is watching over things. If they're in a city or otherwise well-organized kingdom, there's every good likelihood that they'll wind up clapped in manacles and hustled off to a dark dungeon (sans spell components, spellbooks, weapons, armor, etc.; guards in areas like this are well aware of what happens if they pull a Rohan and ""don't take the Wizard's staff""; Grima Wormtongue likely regretted the guards' choice to the end of his days).

Perhaps they resolve things peacefully, and their opposition, after turning things over in his/her mind in the following weeks/months, decides they don't like having been contravened in such spectacular fashion. BAM! You just organically created a recurring ""villain"" for the party, or possibly a story arc where they make some bad choices in opposing the party later to save face, and are brought to a point where they have to make a fateful decision whether to turn to outright evil/villainy (maybe making some deals with demons or devils in the process...) or to just let it go and accept that the party won the day.

122,"There's nothing you can do through straight Wild Shape to get Rend. It's never one of the animal abilities Druids get (remember that the ability functions like varying levels of the [Beast Shape](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape) spell, and Druids top out at Beast Shape III for what abilities they can acquire, which means you're only going to get the listed animal abilities in that spell).

You can sort of approximate Rend if you took two levels of the [Soulknife](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/classes/soulknife) class, enough to get your first [Blade Skill](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/classes/soulknife/blade-skills), at which point you could choose Rending Blades, but it only applies when you crit.

Otherwise, as noted, you can take [Rending Claws](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/rending-claws-combat). However, it doesn't require you to have permanent claws. It only requires you to have two claw attacks, per the feat description. From 8th level onward, any Druid focused on Wild Shape should be spending all their available time in anything *other* than their caster form (their humanoid form), since you have multiple uses of the ability per day, each of which last for 8 (or more) hours. So while you wouldn't be able to use Rending Claws in your humanoid form, you should so rarely be in it that it functionally doesn't matter.",2016-02-25 17:02:23+00:00,d0df7fe,1.0,t3_47jrhg,1231.0,Pathfinder_RPG
123,"The game isn't hard to get into if you take it in small bites. There are a **lot** of rules, but they don't all come into play every time, and don't all even need to be used while you're still learning. There's a thing in the hobby called ""Rule Zero"", which states the person running the game (the Game Master, or GM) can alter or just remove any rule they don't like. It shouldn't be done willy-nilly, but if something isn't fun, just don't use it. One example that's common at my table is ammunition and encumbrance (the amount of weight you can carry). With ammo, for the most part we just don't worry about it unless you're dealing with magic ammunition (which has to be tracked). With encumbrance, we largely don't worry about it as long as no one is getting ridiculous; carrying three or four weapons is fine, having all your regular adventuring gear (bedroll, food/water, adventuring supplies, etc.) is fine, and even carrying several hundred gold is fine. We start looking at things once people want to carry entire arsenals around, want to cart around tens of thousands of gold (without converting it to a portable form like gems, letters of credit, etc.), things like that.

At the end of the day, Pathfinder, as all games using the d20 System (and Pathfinder is about the only game left that uses an unaltered version of the d20 System, the formal name for the game mechanic that was codified when 3rd Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons came out; that's the rules Pathfinder uses, and kept using after Dungeons &amp; Dragons moved on to other editions and rules). That means you're rolling a 20-sided die (a ""d20""), and adding a bonus or subtracting a penalty from the die. That's at the core of the whole thing. Everything else is just individual applications.

Pathfinder is Dungeons &amp; Dragons, just using an older set of rules and without calling itself ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"" (since that's an intellectual property owned by Wizards of the Coast).

Keep things simple. Choose your class, write in the appropriate information (I recommend starting a new character at 1st level until you're more familiar with the rules) on a character sheet, and start playing. Just make sure everyone at the table understands that the first few sessions will go slow as you're all learning the rules. 

If you want to read something, read the section of the Core Rulebook on the class you're going to play, read the Combat chapter, and if you're playing a spellcaster, read the Magic chapter, as well as descriptions of the individual spells your character has. You're probably looking at around an hour of reading, tops.

From there, just play. When you come to something you want to do, look up the rule at that point. The index in the Core Rulebook is honestly pretty good.

If you or someone at your table has a laptop or tablet handy, bookmark www.d20pfsrd.com That site has all the rules for the game online, and is 100% searchable. With WiFi handy, you can quickly find any rule you need or want, in case there's only one copy of the Core Rulebook to go around and you have more than one person who needs to use it.

I'm biased, but in response to your question of, ""Is it any good?"" my answer is, emphatically, ""YES!"" I maintain it's still the most robust, best-designed version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons ever (though the new 5th Edition of D&amp;D comes awfully close), and I love the game.

Just remember the rules are there to provide direction and provide objective resolution to disagreements. The bulk of the game still takes place in your imaginations, the rules just provide some structure. Always remember: if you don't like a rule, just don't use it. :)",2016-02-25 15:56:34+00:00,d0dcd3w,1.0,t3_47hy1i,27302.0,Pathfinder_RPG
124,"There are some nuances in there that would influence the decision. By and large I don't prohibit any actions against NPCs, only against other players. I don't prohibit in-character arguments, etc., which it seems would logically happen in your scenario here. The instant the dice come out, opposed checks start happening, etc., I just put the kibosh on it. The instances over the years where I've seen active conflicts between players end well are far, far outnumbered by the ones where it ended in hurt feelings, rage quits or ever-escalating pettiness that just grinds the whole campaign to a halt while the offended parties start trying to one-up each other in annoyance and atrocity.

I don't prescribe how others conduct things at their tables. I suppose this may be born out of the luxury of living in an area with a larger number of available players &amp; groups, but if I join a new group and see that starting up, I just politely thank the host &amp; the GM (or just the GM if we're playing in a public place) for their time, gather up my stuff, and excuse myself. The game is meant to be fun, and I don't have so much available free time that I'm willing to let my fun be compromised by two (or more) players who want to butt heads.

125,"Pathfinder is very ""math-y"", which means there may not be a really good way to simplify the character sheet without missing vital information. Any character sheet that'll point out ""Add this bonus to this bonus to this bonus to achieve this for this skill/item/weapon"" is probably the best, and have the individual location for each single bonus within eye-shot of that table. It helps communicate that there are bonuses in the game that work together (i.e., one box on a weapon description says ""Base Attack Bonus"", another says, ""Strength Bonus"", another says, ""Feat Bonus"", with addition signs between each box, before arriving at a box that says, ""Total bonus"", so they know to roll a d20 and add that total bonus to their roll, while understanding how that bonus was incrementally arrived at).

You're generally fine ignoring some of the more situational rules until they have a grasp on the basics. You might not want to worry too much about things like the maximum Dexterity bonus for a piece of armor, or the weight of the gear, or more equation-heavy feats like Power Attack, until they've got a solid grasp of things like Base Attack Bonus and damage rolls. As they reach a new level of mastery, you can introduce new rules to add to their system mastery.

Put some onus on them between sessions. Encourage each child to read the entire section on the class they chose, then portion out the Combat, Equipment and Magic (though not the spell descriptions unless it's valid for one of their classes) chapters between the children, and then have them talk with each other and you about the things they read, anything they have questions about, and how it all works together.

You'll have gamers in your group in no time.

The suggestion for 5th Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons isn't an awful one. It's a very simple system to learn (which was its goal), and a great introduction to tabletop role playing. One of the guys in my group has two kids, one 12 and one 15. Their first experience with tabletop RPGs has been 5E, and they're doing fairly well.

PCs will use every tool at their disposal, and there's no reason monsters shouldn't either. I let the dice fall where they may. As a player, it sucks to lose control, particularly if you're in a larger play group where any sort of delay means you may not be able to act once your turn ""finally"" comes up again, but these are the ways the game has provided for challenging players.

127,"In my groups, unilaterally, there's no PvP. I've been playing tabletop RPGs for nearly 31 years now. I've **never** seen it end well. If I see it fermenting, I immediately put a stop to it, and if it persists past that, players get privately and individually pulled out at our next meal break and I have a talk with them. I never outright prohibit evil alignments, but if they're properly played, an evilly-aligned person rarely has a solid reason to work with a good-aligned (or even neutrally aligned but generally beneficent) party. The goals just don't align.

It typically works out like this:

1. If the action you're taking is going to require an attack roll and will do damage, my answer is ""No.""

2. If the spell you're casting requires a saving throw that the other player won't voluntarily forego, my answer is ""No.""

3. If you're going to take, by force or stealth, something that belongs to another character in your party, requiring you to make a Stealth check or CMB roll, or requiring them to make a Perception check or otherwise interact with their defenses in some fashion, my answer is ""No.""

4. If you're actively attempting to deceive someone in the party in such a fashion that, if you're later discovered, it's going to lead to active conflict, my answer is ""No.""

As for adjudication of actual alignment, at no point should other players be acting in such a capacity over each other. That's the purview of the GM, and solely the GM.  It's important to realize that unless you're in a homebrew with its own rules, alignment in Pathfinder is an objective cosmic concept. Something that's good-aligned is good-aligned, such that spells intended to target good creatures will affect them, *Detect Good* will find them, etc. There are no longer any real penalties for changing alignment unless you're a Monk, Paladin or Druid, so it isn't an awful thing to have to change alignment, but there are definitely story elements that can be worked in to make it engaging, particularly if they're a devout character of some sort.

128,"I always kinda look at Spelljammer as a precursor to Planescape. To me, it was TSR's first steps into saying, ""Yes, all our campaign settings are in the same universe."" The introduction of Sigil in Planescape largely made spelljamming ships redundant; portals are a lot easier to come by than a spelljammer helm. :/

That said, the setting can accommodate either the ""treasure planet"" or ""science-fantasy"" approach equally well. It has some great setting fluff, but you encounter the perennial problem Star Trek encountered in comparisons between the Original Series and the Next Generation: do you go for the action happening on other worlds (Original Series), thus reducing spelljamming itself to just a transitive story point, or do you go with the action happening on a spelljamming vessel (The Next Generation), reducing encounters with other cultures to little more than toe dips in their oceans?

D&amp;D, in general, has long suffered from unworkable high seas/nautical mechanics, even in space. It's kind of been the spiritual sibling to psionics: something that always gets tacked on later, and always feels like this optional module that the game would feel no different without.

Planescape went one step further: the Phlogiston and all the individual Crystal Spheres were all on the Prime Material Plane. Planescape said, ""There are multiple planes of existence, of which the Prime is just one."" So you can spelljam to Krynn if you want to deal with kender, lunar-influence on magic and a lack of Paladins, you can spelljam to Athas if you want some ""survival is your goal"" adventuring in the midst of heavy environmental consequences for magic use, you can spelljam to Toril if you want some traditional high-fantasy ancient societies and cosmopolitan advances.

Or you can open a portal to Sigil and open up the entire multiverse.

129,"When Sorcerers first appeared in the 3rd Edition Player's Handbook, they were fairly revolutionary: it was the first time Dungeons &amp; Dragons had officially presented a non-Vancian spell system for a core class. Personally, I think it should have just become the default for arcane casters (all casters, really, but that's because I think of spells as individual applications of a caster's general magical power, and not distinct entities whose interaction with the caster has more to do with the caster's knowledge and less to do with their personal magical power). I think 5th Edition has finally come even closer to getting default spellcasting right.

But I digress.

The Sorcerer tradeoff with the Wizard is versatility (the Wizard) vs. spontaneity. The Sorcerer doesn't know as many spells as the Wizard, but can pull what they DO know out as needed. The Wizard knows a lot more spells than the Sorcerer, but may not have available what they need right at that moment.

In short, the Wizard is likely to say, ""I can get that done if you give me a bit of prep time."" The Sorcerer is likely to say, ""I can do these few things, but I can do them on the spot.""

Given that Wizards get the Scribe Scroll feat for free, the smart thing for a Wizard to do is to spend downtime scribing scrolls to cover for the spells they know, but aren't so useful that they're going to prepare them every day. Meanwhile, the smart thing for the Sorcerer to do **if they took the Scribe Scroll feat** is to spend some time scribing scrolls for spells they don't know, to increase their versatility. Hopefully the party's Wizard will let them poke around in their spellbook (although traditionally it's unlikely to happen, as Wizards are ridiculously jealous of the secrets contained in their spellbook; it doesn't matter if *their* formula for *Fireball* accomplishes the same as some other Wizard's, it only matters that it's *their* formula, that *they* figured out on their own through hard work, trial &amp; error).

You could always just remove the arcane caster redundancy. You wouldn't really be harming much if you gave a Sorcerer the Wizard's spell progression if you also removed Wizards from the game.",2016-02-23 19:52:40+00:00,d0ayy5b,1.0,t3_47889v,2345.0,Pathfinder_RPG
130,"This is, in particular, in response to #2 here. I don't understand **why* that rule didn't make it out of the playtest environment for 5E. I thought it was brilliant: you maximize your weapon's damage die, then add another one of the same type. 

To me, a critical should ALWAYS be better than you can get on a single die roll. The way it's done right now (in the published Player's Handbook) is you just roll two of the weapon's damage dice. If you roll poorly, you can still wind up with a damage roll **worse** than what you could get with a good roll of a single die.

I'll be running a 5E campaign in a few months (once our current one ends), and I seriously think that's what I'm going to do for crits: the standard damage die (or dice) are maxed, and then you roll them again, and then add your bonuses once.

131,"In terms of pure spells, you're looking for *Regeneration*, although *Restoration* could conceivably work, at least from a thematic perspective.

One thing I've noticed is every time a new RPG came out in the days of 1st and 2nd Edition, the first thing they did away with was the Hit Point concept from D&amp;D. Hit Points are intentionally nebulous. They don't represent the purely physical ability of a character to take damage, they're a general representation of skill at avoiding hits, skill in a fight to minimize hits by making the worst of them glance off armor or a shield, cardiovascular training (which one should assume most every PC has in some spectacular degree, considering PCs are as fully capable at 1 hit point as they are at their max), magical enhancement, and plain, dumb luck. For this reason, called shots have never worked well in D&amp;D, and critical hits have had to be represented by just doubling (or more) the damage instead of having a more focused effect.

Alternate rules have, of course, been presented over the years (including the ridiculously craptacular ""Player's Option"" rules that arose just before 3rd Edition was published), but the core approach of D&amp;D (and any games based directly off it, like Pathfinder) has always been ""Hit Points. You're down when they're gone, and not a moment before.""

Fortunately, 5th Edition has **finally** recaptured something that's been missing since the early days of 1st Edition, when people didn't have 40 years of previous editions, other RPGs, etc. to draw on and cause confusion. That's the thing called ""Freedom"". 5th Edition is intentionally ""rules light"", to let Dungeon Masters do what's *fun* instead of what they may feel compelled by ""the rules"" to do. Want to do something crazy, cinematic and acrobatic? Don't worry about whether you have enough ranks in a skill, just make a Dexterity check against some DC the DM gives you, and if you're successful, you pull it off, and everyone at the table has fun.

As much as I love Pathfinder, that's the one thing I'm starting to really feel is missing: there are literally rules for EVERYTHING, and if there isn't a rule for it, the ability to do it depends very heavily on either the GM's or group's (or both) willingness to (and comfort with) wing it. I'm in two Pathfinder groups right now on top of our biweekly 5E game, and I'm starting to once again get that sense I was getting in 3.5 before I took a break that lasted a good couple years (at the time) before 4th Edition came out: the urge to just have a campaign where you aren't dealing with anything not in the Core Rules. I was, at that time, starting to get a hankering for DMing a campaign where all the alternate rulebooks were banned, and where you had the option of choosing classes, spells, feats, etc. that were in the Player's Handbook, and **only** the Player's Handbook. I even thought this as I looked at my 18th level dragon wildshaping Druid who constantly ran around with an AC of 72.

I wound up in a 3.5 group that was finishing things up when 4th Edition had come out, and while they were planning on transitioning into 4th Edition at the time, were still in their 3.5 campaign, which by that point I was a couple years out of practice with. They were playing with hybrid classes, and I just felt like it was happening all over again.

There's something to be said for 5E's simplicity. The player asks, ""Can I do this?"" and the Dungeon Master grins, and responds, ""Sure, give it a try. Gimme a DC 17 Strength check."" The player says, ""Can I use Athletics?"" The DM says, ""Sure! Go for it! Since you're actually skilled at this, let's make that DC 15.""",2016-02-22 22:26:56+00:00,d09u3gn,1.0,t3_4714s9,27307.0,dndnext
132,"No matter how much people try to play around to make it otherwise, it's important to remember that the Bard is the ultimate support class. They're there to make the other party members better, to make the monsters worse, and otherwise improve the quality of life for everyone they've attached themselves to. They know stuff, they can improve things, but they aren't the stars of the story. They're exceeded in combat by Fighters, in spellcasting by, well... most every other spellcasting class... and in skills by Rogues.

What they're awesome for is making sure the **PLAYERS** are having a great time, because a well- and memorably-role played Bard will be the talk of the gaming group for two to three campaigns after the Bard hung up their instruments.

They can be made to be serviceable characters, but it usually requires enough multiclassing and obscure class ability shenanigans to make it impractical from a role playing perspective. You start stressing suspension of disbelief in the **STORY**, which should, to me, always be worse than suspension of disbelief in someone's ability to do running broad jumps in plate armor while waving around an anime sword would ever do.

The ultimate utilitarian is always going to be the Druid, at least from around 8th level onward. Between their spells and utility of both elemental and animal shapes, there's very little they can't accomplish, and accomplish well. They can be amazing front-line combatants, amazing spellcasters, support class, star-of-the-story, on and on.

135,"So we're traveling through an underground area, and we wind up going into a portal into what we now realize is the dream world. While there, we're attacked by some vicious tribal types. We waste all but one of them. Keen on the memory of our GM telling us that ""you aren't looting enough stuff"", we demand this guy leads us to some treasure. He does.

Turns out there's a temple in this area made of solid gold. No priesthood or anything, just a temple of some ancient snake god (who I'm sure we've since managed to upset greatly by what we did). Well, my Druid is quite enterprising. She shifts into a fire elemental form (we were 9th level at this point, so it was a form she could maintain 9 hours a day on a single use of Wild Shape). We proceed to melt down the temple.

The whole thing.

I proceed the next day to use my fire elemental form to melt us some forms in the sand that we use to shape our pool of molten gold into a cart (a rather large one). It's pulled out of the area by us with my Druid in stegosaurus form (because why wouldn't you harness a huge golden cart to a dinosaur?).

It took some shenanigans on our part, but we eventually managed to get our sizable haul to a major city a bit later, and managed to find a way to convert this all to spendable wealth.

We're all currently sitting on about 3.5 million gold apiece. We're currently waiting for GM approval on the shopping lists we submitted to him.

I fully anticipate at some point that the snake god or whatever is left of its worshiper base is going to figure out we're the ones who melted down its temple/defiled its altar (we left that semi-buried in some sand as a marker while we stored our golden cart underground in a cave made by my Druid in her earth elemental form; it's frightening how utilitarian Druids are in their mid levels...).

I haven't gone insane with my shopping list (asked for some Ironwood Wild Chainmail, a helm of telepathy to help with communication while I'm wildshaped, a Tome of Understanding to jack up my Wisdom so I'm not missing out on higher level spells, and something to jack up my Strength so I'm doing a bit more damage in combat), but it's still neat having that much gold, which our GM was kind enough to let us have since we were so creative and thorough in our dedication to personal enrichment.

138,"""DMPCs"" as they're often called are a very common thing in D&amp;D, and have been for years (probably for as long as the game has been around). It's often a solution to a smaller group of players, as many people feel that you need at least four players (or four characters) to have a ""workable"" party.

There are some good rules to follow if you're going to do it:

1. Don't be the party leader/spokesperson.
2. Don't have knowledge that someone of that class/level/background wouldn't otherwise have.
3. Don't be the one that ""saves the day"" if the party makes dumb decisions or the dice turn against them. DM fudging of that kind is fine; DM fudging via the DMPC is not.
4. Don't put in treasure specifically for that character, or at least not of an amount or power level that the other players aren't also getting. At no point should an item you intend for the DMPC be the only piece of treasure found in a given encounter.",2016-02-11 23:06:13+00:00,czwmcfy,1.0,t3_45avfe,9817.0,DnD
139,"1. Group Size - You learn to use tact. ""Hey, guys, the group is a bit too large right now; how would a few of you feel about either gaming in a separate campaign on another night, or possibly starting one of your own?"" The ""separate campaign"" idea might even let you be a player if someone else is willing to DM.

2. Taking 10 &amp; 20 - This can only happen when there's nothing pressing which would interrupt the characters. Even just a singe prowling monster in an area that has a chance of encountering the party can prevent them from taking 10 (much less 20). Conversely, you can set the DCs high enough that Taking 10 (which is equivalent to rolling 10 on the d20) won't produce a successful result. Otherwise, Taking 10/20 is there for a reason: it lets players succeed in non-emergeny circumstances without grinding the session to a halt while people roll dice. It's one thing to require rolls in combat or when failure has a meaningful impact, it's another entirely when failing merely means not finding something, and will otherwise just be a minor inconvenience to the party. Alternately, you can just institute a house rule that Taking 10/20 doesn't happen in your campaign. This is invoking Rule Zero, however, and if this happens too often, it can result in player revolt. Avoid that: the goal of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (or any game) is fun. That isn't fun.

3. Categorically, if there's a player stealing things from the party, that player is to be taken aside **ONCE** and warned, out of character, that it won't be tolerated. Don't do it in front of the group, or they'll be too embarrassed to maturely receive what you're telling them, and are likely to dig in/refuse, throw a tantrum or otherwise cause a scene. If they persist in stealing from the party after that, start critting their character like crazy in the next fight, or otherwise just kill them. In fact, sometimes just outright killing them in the next fight (or dropping a boulder on them, having a sinkhole open up beneath them, etc.), and giving them a meaningful look (raised eyebrows are often sufficient) will help them see the error of their ways. If it doesn't, suffer through that session, and privately contact them during the session and let them know they aren't welcome to return. To avoid them politicking behind the scenes (it's sad, but I've seen it happen more than it should in 31 years of playing D&amp;D), send an email or group text to everyone else after you let them know they aren't welcome, and tell the rest of the party you've chosen to not invite them back. This is a nuclear option, however, so only dis-invite the player as a last resort.

I maintain the ""no theft/no attacking other players"" rule in every campaign I either play in or run. If someone else is DMing, and I see it happen, I just stop, tell the DM I don't want to be involved in a campaign like that, and if they're fine with it, I just politely exit. I've been ""that person"" before. I played a Rogue in 3rd Edition, and at one point found some treasure in a corner the rest of the party hadn't seen yet. I tried to do a Sleight of Hand check to pocket a gem. I rolled quite well. One of the other players immediately shouted out, ""I'm watching him!"" He hadn't otherwise been given a reason to do so, and the proper response from the DM should have been, ""Why? And why did you only say so after he did this?"" But it wasn't. The DM let him roll a Perception check, and he lucked out with a natural 20, which was high enough with his Spot check to exceed my Sleight of Hand roll. I gave the gem over to the party with a grin. That night, as I slept, someone else in the party coup de grace'd me. I didn't like it, the DM didn't like it, but they were justified. I rolled another character, and we moved on.

That was the last time I ever stole from the party. I've played Rogues several times since, and haven't once tried it, because I learned the hard way it just isn't a good thing to do. It ruins PLAYERS' fun, not just the characters.

As for refusing to RP, let them refuse. They don't get a share of that XP (so hand out role playing XP immediately after the RP, to help them see what they're missing). If they're actively interfering with others attempting to RP, take them aside during a meal break or between sessions and let them know it isn't going to be tolerated, and they need to stop being disruptive.

141,"My confusion arises from someone treating ANY 5th Edition character as a munchkin like your description says about your Paladin player. This isn't 3.5 or Pathfinder; the system just doesn't support munchkining very well, and DPT is a relative non-issue with the low Armor Class and hit point values typical of this edition.

That isn't an indictment of 5E, which I so far love, just so we're clear. I don't *quite* love it as much as 3.5/Pathfinder, but it's light years ahead of 4th Edition.

If his Paladin only wants to Smite, let 'im Smite. If this is an RP campaign (and it's fine if it isn't), keep in mind that most Paladins traditionally serve a god of some sort, who may not appreciate the gifts made available to this holy warrior being squandered because the Paladin just wants to smack things around. Even vengeance needs to be tempered by righteousness and the other considerations of being a Paladin.

If there's no god in play for this Paladin, keep careful watch on the player's actions. I don't typically favor being overly restrictive on the Lawful Good alignment (it typically leads to players being ""Lawful Stupid""), and I don't like putting undue restrictions on being a Paladin (often a GM overreaction to the not-inconsiderable power output Paladins had in 1st and 2nd Edition), but if it just isn't working out, more stringent measures may be called for.

But also ask yourself this: is this really bothersome to your campaign, or is it just that this player is playing his Paladin in a way different from how **you** would play a Paladin? If it's the latter, it may be time to just accept that there's more than one approach to most classes. ;)",2016-02-11 18:29:01+00:00,czwa63x,1.0,t3_459u2s,4574.0,dndnext
142,"One effect is from a magical item, the other is from a spell that modifies the damage of a weapon/item, so my interpretation would be that they do, in fact, stack.

A quick perusal online, however, indicates it does an *extra* 3d6 damage, meaning the core damage of the shot is intact (so 3d8 with *Lightning Arrow*).

But yeah, the Oathbow is a powerful weapon, and in the right circumstances, the damage **COULD** get pretty sick. Imagine a Ranger with Colossus Slayer who's activated the Oathbow against an already-damaged enemy and has cast *Lightning Arrow*. You'd be looking at 3d8 (*Lightning Arrow*)+ 3d6 (Oathbow) +1d8 (Colossus Slayer) + any static damage bonuses the Ranger has. Add in the -5 to hit from the Sharpshooter feat (if they choose to take the penalty, and with the low AC values in 5E, there's little reason not to), and you have an additional 10 points of damage on top of that.

143,"Nothing formal exists for 5th Edition. It's backing off considerably on commonality of magic items (and how powerful they are). The Dungeon Master's Guide recommends against the kind of magic item economy popularized by 3rd Edition (and maintained in Pathfinder), and feats are radically reduced in diversity and output in 5E. Feats were where PCs got their item creation abilities to begin with.

This said, there's probably not a huge issue with recreating some of those feats, or just having a generic ""Craft Magic Item"" feat, or even make it based off an Intelligence check, possibly letting a crafting feat like I just mentioned be the difference between receiving your Proficiency bonus or not.

However, a smart limitation would be to insist you can only craft a magic item that uses magic you already know. If you want to make a potion of healing, you're going to need to be able to cast *Cure Wounds*. If you want to make a Ring of 3 Wishes, you're going to have to be able to cast *Wish* first.

Also realize, the instant you put magic item creation into the hands of players, you're going to lose some control over the power curve of a campaign. 5E operates under the assumption that magic items are relatively rare, and of generally low power (compared to previous editions, at least). By keeping distribution control solidly in the Dungeon Master's hands, the power creep that invariably accompanies player control over magic item acquisition is removed.

The problem would still arise, however: there are no objective gold values for magic items in 5E. 3.5 had gold values that could be used either as purchase prices or as an indication for how much an item crafter was going to have to spend (half market value) to create the item. Those expenditures were meant to place a limit on how many items could be created (along with the time expeditures; I've rarely been in campaigns in 31 years where the party had enough downtime for crafters to do any meaningful amount of magic item creation), so you're going to have to find an alternate way to place practical restraints on item creation, or you're going to have to start assigning ""market values"" to magic items so crafters have an idea of what they'll need to spend to make the item(s) they want.

145,"1. Since at least 4th Edition's inception, my groups have used ""Roll 4d6, drop the lowest, roll three sets of stats like that and pick the best set, then assign to taste."" It's never caused issues. I categorically reject point buy as a stat generation system. This might just be me being a grognard, having been playing since 1st Edition was all there was (I got started in 1985). I like rolling stats. I don't like how point buy systems invariably erect what I call ""stat socialism"", which is forcing everyone to either be good at one thing and suck at others, or at best, good at one to two things and middling (at best) at others. The reality is this: some people are just better at many things than others. Suck it up, buttercup.

2. I encourage players to play what they want, without consideration for filling roles. This didn't work out well at all in 4th Edition, since the entire system was built around the ""MMO Party"" (healer/tank/damage dealer), and groups actively suffered if every role wasn't filled. Groups still tend to have a rougher time if there isn't a healer present in Pathfinder, but potions (or scrolls with at least one player having Use Magic Device maxed out) can often cover for that.",2016-02-10 21:09:55+00:00,czv7tfv,1.0,t3_454caq,7665.0,Pathfinder_RPG
146,"1. Food &amp; Drink - I typically don't worry about it much unless the environment calls for it. If they're moving through a forest or plains, etc., they're going to be able to find food &amp; drink. If they're in a desert or deep in the Underdark, they're going to have to worry about this stuff, and Survival checks will start happening to forage.

2. Weight &amp; Carrying Capacity - I don't worry about this unless it starts getting ridiculous. If you're carrying around several hundred gold pieces (probably under 500 or so), I'm not going to worry about it. If you're carrying around thousands of gold pieces or a virtual armory, I'm going to suggest you convert the gold to gems for portability (or acquire a Bag of Holding), and consider only carrying weapons you're commonly using (perhaps, again, using extradimensional storage options for the stuff you want ""just in case"" but don't see daily use for).

3. Items - Material components are a frustration, to be honest, and another of those holdovers from 1st Edition that just don't make much sense. I don't know why they're even kept in the form of the nebulously-defined ""material component pouch"" (i.e., if it doesn't have much actual value, you're just assumed to have what you need for your spells). That's how I approach it: if it has a gold cost, you need to pay that. If not, I don't worry about it: a Wizard prone to wandering the countryside isn't going to be found without the ability to cast their spells. A Sorcerer shouldn't have to worry about spell components to begin with: their power is internal and inherent, not focused through external objects.

4. XP is divided amongst the party. If there's 4 people in the party and an encounter yields 350 XP, then each individual player receives 87 XP. It's best to hand out XP at the end of a session unless you want your session to grind to a halt while people level up in the middle of the session.

5. His AC in this case is going to be 10 + his Dexterity bonus (if any).

6. You can absolutely place scrolls in a chest as treasure. They're incredibly valuable either as a source of new spells for Wizards (who are always eager to find spells they don't know yet), or as a means for spellcasters to have backup options once they've blown their daily allotment of spells.

7. It's up to the Dungeon Master, but there's no particular reason they can't. If you're talking about 5th Edition, ""proficiency"" means something different, however: it means you get to apply your Proficiency Bonus (which is based on your level) to any skill checks (which is just a check based on one of your 6 ability scores) you make. In this case, blacksmithing is probably going to be an Intelligence or possibly Wisdom check, with an additional Proficiency bonus if you conclude the character has the knowledge, plus possibly Advantage on the check if they have the proper tools (and Disadvantage if they don't). Skills in 5th Edition are vastly simplified from earlier editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

8. Boss fight for 1st level characters? Consider creating a 2nd or 3rd level Wizard with some minions for them to fight, or maybe a troll, or something along those lines.

9. Further tips - have fun. If you're all new, just let the players know that you're learning the rules the same as they are, and may have to stop to look up a rule here and there.

150,"Believe me, 5E's magic system is a massive step forward from the pure-preparation Vancian system we last saw (in ""pure"" form) in 3.5. I've never quite understood why Gary Gygax went with this; I don't know if he was a big fan of Jack Vance or if he was casting about (pardon the pun) for a viable magic system and figured Vance's approach was the most sensible.

It comes down to this, I suppose: do you consider magic a ""resource"" shaped by the caster's will, or do you consider each spell an individual, independent entity? If the former, point-based magic systems are probably the right approach. You ""know"" a certain number of spells of a given power level (dependent on your spellcasting class level), and you use your reserves of magic power to cast them as needed, without having to prepare them ahead of time.

If spells are independent entities, then you have to prepare them ahead of time. Being mortal, there are inherent limitations on your ability to maintain memory of the complex somatic and verbal components (and the proper amounts/mixtures of material components, as appropriate) endemic to each spell.

That was the Vancian approach. 5E hits a middle ground: you still have to ""prepare"" spells each day (unless you're a Sorcerer), but you then have freedom in how you cast them. Your personal power levels are tied to your spellcasting class levels, which gives a general indication of how much overall power you have to apply to a spell. You can cast a 5th level version of *Magic Missile*, or you can cast a 1st level version and have the power for a 5th level spell to use either at its minimum (for a 5th level spell) or to empower an otherwise-weaker (lower-level) spell.

I think at this point the last dregs of Vancian casting are kept around out of a sense of nostalgia more than anything. 5E is big on nostalgia (see the general return of the Forgotten Realms to its pre-4th Edition timeline, a campaign tied to the old Elemental Evil stuff, Out of the Abyss once again statting out not only Orcus and Demogorgon, but also Zuggtmoy the Fungus Queen, who we know from the Gord the Rogue books was a favorite of Gary Gygax). Its rules crunch is there to bring new players in. Its focus on old-style tabletop RPGs is there to bring back lapsed players from bygone days.

Yes, a Paladin wears heavy armor and wields weapons like a Fighter. Therein, the similarities end.

Rangers were blenders in 2nd Edition. I rarely saw them played as archers, due to their class receiving Two Weapon Fighting for free. It got worse once Drizzt showed up; they all became scimitar wielders with Figurines of Wondrous Power (despite the panther version not really existing prior to being statted out in the Menzoberranzan boxed set).

3rd Edition at least made the archers comparable (output-wise) with the ginsu Rangers, by giving them feats to specialize their ranged output.

I'm ignoring 4th Edition entirely. It's still leaves the effect of a bad cheap-wine hangover in me.

You'll note that the two primary archetypes of Ranger in 5E don't give much shrift to melee Rangers. They're Beastmasters or Archers in the Player's Handbook. I think this is intentional: the ""iconic"" Ranger is, whether we like it or not, Legolas. The iconic Ranger is an archer. It makes sense that they should be the go-to for ranged output, over Fighters or anyone else. If there are design flaws that enable other classes to approach a Ranger's ranged output (with weapons, at least; spells don't count), that should be corrected.",2016-02-09 20:54:37+00:00,cztw571,2.0,t1_cztt3qq,4026.0,DnD
154,"If you're looking to play 3.5, your best bet would probably honestly be Pathfinder. It's ""3.75"" for lack of a better term. But look in their Core Rulebook, and you're going to find the same classes and magic items you found in 3.5's Player's Handbook &amp; Dungeon Master's Guide.

However, really awesome digital tools (at least that aren't really expensive and lacking in updates) have always been an issue with D&amp;D, for some reason. WotC had grand ideas for Master Tools back in 3rd Edition, but once it came out, it was a pretty serious CF. It got slightly better over time, but many people moved to PC Gen over on Sourceforge, and eventually WotC just handed development of Master Tools over to those people anyway.

4E spent a LOT of time promising a virtual gaming table for people to use, but it never really materialized. It seems many people now use Roll20 for virtual gaming.

But otherwise, for digital tools, Combat Manager is a decent iOS app to use, and Hero Lab is often the go-to for character development.

Me? I want a terrific program that makes map design easy and intuitive, and does its work in the square grids used in 3.5 and even 4E and 5E now.

155,"Well, here are the important things to realize with a typically-built Archer-style Ranger in 5E:

1. *Hunter's Mark* can only be on one creature at a time. It requires concentration, so putting it on another will remove it from the first. But while it's up, that's an additional d6 on each attack (meaning once the Ranger is making 2 attacks a round at 5th level and beyond, that d6 applies on both hits).
2. Colossus Slayer only works once a round. If the Ranger makes two attacks that round, only one of them is going to get the extra d8, and only if the creature has already been hurt in some fashion (i.e., has taken at least 1 point of damage).
3. I'm personally unclear if the extra d8 for Colossus Slayer or the d6 for *Hunter's Mark* applies with the use of spells like *Lightning Arrow*. I'm inclined to say it doesn't, since *Lightning Arrow* replaces the normal damage of the weapon with the spell's damage.

160,"Here's the important part of the stuff you quoted:

**""It requires as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally""**

Thus, immediately, you have a confirmation that spellcasting while using Earth Glide is possible.

Keep in mind that Wild Shape typically stops spellcasting because it assumes you're in an animal form, which is unable to cast spells with verbal or somatic components due to not being able to speak (outside of the animal's natural form of communication), and likely due to inability to manipulate material components or make gestures properly, thus hitting the somatic and material component requirements. The feat lets a wild shaping Druid bypass that.

A case could likely be made that an earth elemental could manipulate components and make the proper gestures, as well as speak after a fashion, sufficient to cast a spell. However, any material components a Druid is carrying would merge with their form when they became an elemental.

The feat bypasses all this, and just says, ""You can cast spells while wild shaped."" (This is not, of course, the actual text of the feat, but [as you can see here, the feat description obviously makes this possible](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/natural-spell---final) )

Multiple 9th level spells a day is going to be more than enough to challenge most anything in a Bestiary, to be honest).

Mythic Adventures is Paizo's answer to the Epic Level Handbook, and it takes the approach of an alternate leveling system that operates alongside the existing 1-20 system. You gain mythic tiers that are completely independent of XP gain, and entirely dependent on when your GM thinks you should gain one, allowing very hands-on control of the extra powers that come from those tiers.

Functionally, it just results in a higher-powered campaign, which some enjoy (I do, personally, but also see how it can be a headache for a GM).

In other words, while a 5th level Psion could manifest a 1st level power and augment it by spending more power points, they couldn't spend more than 5 total power points on that augmentation. In the Expanded Psionics Handbook from 3.5, that limitation didn't exist.

170,"As jadedttrpgfan noted, a player who's treating the game as a contest between them and the GM is just asking for trouble. Not only can they not win if the GM decides they'll lose (Rule Zero and all that), it's just not a good attitude to have in what is still fundamentally a cooperative experience: everyone's working to tell a story. At the end of the day, barring spectacularly stupid choices by the players, the GM, if backed into a corner where they **have** to choose, should err on the side of the PCs winning. A good GM won't let themselves be backed into that corner, but also won't do anything overtly intended to kill the PCs, letting PC death happen by fiat of the dice or as a result of player choice.

If this player wants to play Necromancer, let them. Keep in mind that in default Pathfinder, alignment is an objective cosmic force with legitimate rules crunch attached. Raising undead is an evil action. Doing it intentionally and repeatedly is going to shift that PC's alignment to evil, even if they're just building armies of zombies to hurl against the forces of evil.

How are local townspeople going to treat the razing of their graveyards, areas often treated as sacred ground (and may actually **be** sacred ground if the area has a Cleric powerful enough to cast *Hallow* on a regular basis)?

How are people in a city going to react to a Wizard wandering into town smelling of corpse? You keep raising enough dead, you're going to acquire a stink.

When the PCs get more powerful, what happens when the Lord of the Undead, Orcus, starts noticing this Necromancer who's raising lots of undead and not paying proper fealty to the Lord of the Undead? Demon lords are so unpredictable (and notoriously capricious) sometimes...

How are the rest of the party going to react to it? A Ranger, Druid, Paladin or good-aligned Cleric are likely to be horrified (and Paladins **are** known for sometimes taking stubborn stands...), as will most any elf.

171,"What you're dealing with is the difference between ""Lawful Good"" and what's often called ""Lawful Stupid"".

Paladins do, and often must, overlook crime all the time. They may be traveling in lands where they're just going to get punted into a torture chamber for taking a stand. They may be in lands where they have no authority, and are ""just another adventurer"" (which most leaders in the world understand are a radically destabilizing influence on local economies, likely to stir up trouble and leave the leader having to deal with the consequences, and if the adventurers are powerful enough, may just leave the whole region a flattened, smoking crater in a fit of pique, because adventurers.

Paladins are always Lawful Good, but they aren't always ""white knights"" (or knights at all). Now if this Paladin has a single-digit Wisdom score, there may not be much justification for his sense of righteousness to be offended sufficiently to push him to act. But if he has at least an ""average"" Wisdom he'd likely realize that trying to do anything now would just be stupid. His guts would likely be churning at all of this, and he may make it a point to return at a later time, either with greater power or just whatever voluntary army he can gather, to take care of the situation. But there's absolutely nothing stopping him from realizing discretion is the better part of valor in this scenario, and I hope he would.

Up until the power gamer in me got really woken up in 3rd Edition, I spent years with the Paladin as my favorite class (been playing D&amp;D for nearly 31 years at this point). I made all the mistakes you can make with a Paladin (being ""Lawful Stupid"", being the killjoy of the party, being haughty, insisting that I get a Holy Avenger at some point in the character's career, etc.). As time has gone on and I've gained not only a more nuanced view of the Paladin class, but of alignment in general, I've realized there's a lot of entertaining, fun, engaging ways to play Lawful Good that have nothing to do with filling any of the negative stereotypes Paladins have accrued since Gary Gygax plugged the class into the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player's Handbook in 1978 (some 7 years or so before I started playing).

This said, I'm a big fan, as a GM, of actions having consequences. If your players (or just the Paladin) chooses to do something obviously foolish, let them. If they die, they make a new character.

They master magic, they learn combat techniques that would dazzle most any soldier, they make deals with creatures that most people wouldn't imagine existed outside of folklore, they meet other races (most human commoners may have met the occasional elf or dwarf, likely an adventurous sort themselves, but for the most part, if they don't live in a very cosmopolitan area, they're likely to be born, live and die without seeing more than other humans). They eventually speak to the gods. A single troll is a source of terror for an entire village. An adventurer quickly realizes there are threats far beyond a mere troll (while respecting the fact that if they aren't cautious, that troll can still gut them), and they rise to face those threats.

Consider the hobbits who left The Shire in ""Lord of the Rings"" (the books, not the movies). They returned to The Shire in bright armor, carrying magical blades, hoisting around more money than anyone else in The Shire would likely ever see. They seemed strange and alien to the hobbits who had never left. Merry, Pippin and Frodo didn't think twice about moving to remove Sharky and his ruffians from The Shire, because they had just faced off against Sauron, the worst Mordor had to offer, and the Ring of Power itself (keeping in mind that in Tolkien's mythology, Sauron was functionally a demigod). They had met elves, dwarves, wizards, had dined and fought with kings, and had not only witnessed the first major human king in ages, but helped put him on the throne.

Those are adventurers. A dwarf Druid who goes out and gains levels and goes adventuring would have likely done just fine in dwarven culture as a Druid. But he (or she) won't return to their home area without being very changed, and into something the majority of dwarves who knew them when they were younger could have probably never imagined.",2016-01-27 22:19:07+00:00,czeefd9,3.0,t1_czedhx5,1318.0,Pathfinder_RPG
188,"Yeah, for an actually serious answer from me, I would say a dwarf Druid would probably not rely on flying wild shape forms as much, and may be inclined to go for burrowers, or even spend more time as an earth elemental. Statistically, at least if you're going for combat optimization, you're still going to want to go with a dire tiger for your size large form, and a stegosaurus for your size huge form. But if you put more weight on flavor and role playing, or if you aren't going to focus as much on being a front-line combatant, then you can spend more time as a primary caster in your dwarf form and just cast a lot of *Summon Nature's Ally* to do your fighting for you. ;)

In terms of outlook, the way to role play a dwarf Druid will depend entirely on the dwarf. Are they ""traditional""? Then go with something like I just noted.

The fun thing is this: no one has to fall into a racial stereotype. You can, for example, have an urban, city-dwelling elf who dislikes and distrusts nature &amp; fights with a greataxe just as much as you can the traditional elf who ponces through the woods with a longbow wearing leather armor in shades of brown, green and red.

An urban dwarf who becomes a Druid might be someone who understands the natural ""ebb and flow"" of city life, and how it interacts with the wider (and unsettled) world of Golarion. Likewise, a dwarf raised in the country would likely fall into the more traditional ""nature priest"" role of a Druid.

Of course, at 4th level, a simple +1 weapon is a ""powerful"" magic item. The specialized stuff isn't starting to crop up. You wouldn't be out of line just randomly rolling any magical treasure they get, and leaving them to figure out if it's useful or not. If it isn't, they, as low-level newbies in the world, can wander around the next city they come to and see if someone wants to trade for something more useful to them (I'm not a big fan of ""magic item shops"").

The reality is this is a detail of the game that generally gets glossed over to keep up with the fun stuff. Players are happier when they're getting magic items that they want to use (if all you drop is a +2 quarterstaff, and your melee combatant uses nothing but swords, that's a ""wasted"" item to that player).

If I were attempting to ameliorate personal damage by use of *Feather Fall*, I'd be 100% on Railgun5's side on this: the spell is making you lighter.

You can find out about 5th Edition's wildshape on [page 20 of the 5th Edition Source Reference Document](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/SRD-OGL_V1.1.pdf).

In Pathfinder, you retain your Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom &amp; Charisma scores while wildshaped. You take on an adjustment to your Strength and Dexterity (as well as a likely bonus to your Armor Class in the form of a Natural Armor bonus). You don't actually *become* the creature you're shaped into, you just take on its form and acquire several of its abilities.

If your GM wants to insist that you take on this eagle's hit points, decide if you're fine with two things:

1. His house rule, and 
2. Him not calling it a house rule (which it is, and a nerfing one at that, at least in this scenario).

He's absolutely correct that the rules don't specifically mention you keep your original hit points (why, I don't know; maybe they just thought it was common sense to assume you would). That said, they don't specifically say that you acquire the new form's hit points, either, and since they're otherwise specific about what **does** happen to you (adjustments to Strength, Dexterity &amp; Natural Armor, as well as acquisition of several special abilities native to the form), it's worth pointing out that the absence of a specific call-out on hit points should be an indication that there's no change to hit points at all.

If the rest of your party is fine with that, go for it, but realize that more traditional melee types (Fighters, in particular) may be upset.

To be honest, while Druids have some spellcasting, they aren't going to be a primary spellcaster if they're focused on wildshaping unless you either have a generous point buy or are very lucky with your stat rolls. Much like any other melee combatant, a wildshaping Druid should be making Strength their primary stat; this means they're likely to have a lower Wisdom, which has an effect on their spellcasting (my poor Druid is **capable** of casting 5th level spells, but she can't do it with her Wisdom of 14). Most of the time a Druid focusing on wildshaping ought to primarily be buffing themselves (the [Magic Fang](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-fang) spell is a wildshaper's best friend) or helping the rest of the party out (I spend time as a third-string healer since I rarely have more than a basic *Cure Wounds* spell prepared).

As others have suggested, you may want to consider swapping out a truly secondary spellcasting class' ability to cast spells and give them a wildshape that isn't QUITE as good as a Druid's as a replacement. In general if I start playing around with a class to let it do something designed for a different class, I want to make sure that someone playing that other class isn't going to feel like they're suddenly obsolete.

If you're in an RP-heavy group, it's a conceivably viable response. Then again, rationale for most disparately-aligned and -motivated ""heroes"" working together is dicey to begin with; even if you go to a ""classic"" group like the Heroes of the Lance from Dragonlance, the only people who *really* had a reason to stick together were Caramon and Raistlin, 'cause, y'know, brothers (and twins at that). Go to Wheel of Time, and there's zero reason for Mat to stick around Rand (aside from the whole *ta'veren* thing pulling him towards him). Yet somehow, despite being pulled towards Rand, Perrin never really was. Once he left and went back to the Two Rivers, his only real involvement with Rand was running interference in *tel'aran'rhiod* during *Tar'mon Gaidon*. So at least Jordan understood there wasn't really a viable reason to keep together the party that first left the Two Rivers in each other's company.

Your Cleric/Fighter seems to have a justifiable reason: he was told by his god that he wasn't worthy for the afterlife which was presumably the motivating reward for dedicating his mortal life to the god in the first place.

I don't like that. But without it being literally baked into the system at inception (4E sort of tried it with the third Player's Handbook, except that the ability structure of that edition made everyone exactly the same, using fluff to differentiate the powers each class had; a 14th level Wizard was doing exactly the same number of cool things as a 14th level Fighter, and their Psion was literally almost no different from a Wizard; Ultimate Psionics suffers from this too, as most of the psionic powers are just differently-flavored copies of existing spells), there's just no way to avoid it feeling tacked-on. The concession of magic/psionics transparency, done as a concession to GMs who are nervous about psionics or don't want a lot of extra effort to put it in their games, winds up just making psionics another ""flavor"" of magic, which sort of defeats the purpose.

I'd love to see an edition of the game (whether Dungeons &amp; Dragons or some far-flung future new edition of Pathfinder) come along with psionics fully integrated from the foundation of design. Conceptually, 1st Edition had just that (notice the psionics entries for each creature in the first Monster Manual), but its psionics mechanics were beyond obfuscated and unplayable (which gave me a sad).

The unfortunate effect of it being the aforementioned semi-unwanted bastard stepchild is that support material is infrequent at best. That there's **any** Mythic material for Ultimate Psionics is a supreme testament to Dreamscarred Press' dedication to their monster-sized book.

If your campaign has a timetable to it (i.e., ""Get this done by this point in time or supreme nastiness happens""), it can be difficult to find time to craft items of any meaningful power. However, campaigns like that run the risk of frustrating or alienating players who otherwise built their characters to be focused crafters; if that's the case, consider offering a blanket rearrangement of their feats (or possibly even classes) and hope it's enough.

Money is also an issue; if the players aren't accumulating a lot of gold, they won't be able to afford even the reduced cost of crafting.

Alternately, you can take a generous approach of not handing out specific treasure, but just periodically telling your players, ""You have each accumulated 'x' amount in gold of treasure"", then letting them page through magic item lists and acquiring what they want. This lends itself to abuse if you have optimizers/power gamers in your group, but it also significantly alleviates preparation time on the GM's part (the two things I hate doing the most as a GM are creating maps and designing treasure, particularly since I usually just wind up rolling randomly for the latter anyway). Personally, I likely plan on doing that in the campaign I'm designing right now, putting limitations on some items (a *Ring of Wishes* or similar items probably not going to be something I'm going to let PCs choose for their treasure; if they get something like that, it's because I handed it to them).",2016-01-21 16:43:40+00:00,cz6n7u9,1.0,t3_41xya8,48853.0,Pathfinder_RPG

If the whole party is evil, it might work, but in general, after 30 years of role playing, my experience is it's just never a really great idea.

A really intelligent person who lacks wisdom can manifest as someone who lets natural curiosity overwhelm common sense (which they lack).

I wanna feel what the egg's shell feels li.... ACK!"" *rest of the party watches as an angry black dragon reduces the Wizard to a pile of steaming acidic goo*

That's a high-Intelligence-low-Wisdom character example.

Conversely, someone with high Wisdom but low Intelligence is going to be canny, that person who, despite just not being very bright, somehow always seems to come out on the better side of things because they just sort of intuitively figure out how to avoid the worst actions (or can't figure out how to perform them). It's the Fighter who can't figure out how to overcome a puzzle blocking the way to an ancient treasure, but instinctively knows that the rumors of a powerful undead guard of the treasure are likely to lead to a bad end. It's the Rogue who understands that angering the expert marksman guards to get at a treasure is a bad idea, even though any attempt they'd otherwise be inclined to make wouldn't be terribly creative or smart to begin with.

Fortunately, I wouldn't have to torrent them if I wanted to spend some money. WotC has links to an online store that sells PDFs of previous-edition material, and all the Planescape material is there.

2. Let them know you're all new, so you're all going to make mistakes. Give them a couple do-overs if they screwed something up unintentionally (though not if they just made a dumb choice from not thinking something through), and let them know you may have to go back on a couple things too while you all get it worked out.

3. While the rules are there for a reason, the goal is **fun**. If you and your players are having fun, then keep doing things that way. If it's a home game, you have no one to report to but your players; there's no ""authority"" watching over every session ready to smite you if you don't follow the RAW.

4. Speaking of RAW (Rules As Written), balance them with both RAI (Rules As Intended) and more importantly RAF (Rules As Fun). RAF&gt;RAI&gt;RAW if you want a priority list.

5. If they find some unexpected rules exploit, just let them know that while they're technically correct, you don't want it to work like that in your game. If they don't respond well to that, there's nothing keeping them from starting their own campaign on another night, to which they'll hopefully invite you to be a player. 

6. Make sure everyone understands that the GM isn't out to kill them, and they shouldn't be out to ""put one over"" on the GM. Tabletop RPGs are a cooperative experience.

7. Don't let them play evilly-aligned characters. Just don't. It never works out.

8. Make sure they're aware actions have consequences.

Fantasy guards are not like American police: they don't have to fill out endless forms or get a paid vacation each time they draw their weapon.

225,"If you get down to it, the entire life of most standard PCs is one of murder, theft and desecration. You have Fighters walking around bristling with weapons and plate armor, you have Wizards walking around with brightly-glowing staves and with gleaming gems encircling their heads in some bizarre magical orbit. You have Rangers and Druids wandering into cities accompanied by giant animals, Barbarians carrying gigantic axes, Clerics wantonly displaying the symbology of mighty extraplanar powers (""gods""), on and on.

It never made sense to me, but winds up being something to overlook in the name of fun. In truth it'd probably be something closer to the way the U.S. is now. If you go into rural or border areas, seeing someone wandering around with weapons may not be a big deal (though our ridiculous bureaucracy would mandate showing registrations; that's another issue, though...). ""Good ol' boys"" get into brawls in roadhouses, and the local priest is probably walking around with their collar on most any time they're out and about.

But in a city? I don't see many outside of the police wandering around openly carrying weapons. Getting into a fight of any kind is usually a cause for the police descending on you and dumping you in a jail cell for the night, and openly proselytizing is looked at as an oddity more than anything else.

Yet, PCs... they draw their weapons at the slightest offense, face off against guards with nary a thought to consequences (they can, after all, just go to another city, and there are rarely overlapping jurisdictions even in a formal kingdom), they throw around *Fireball* as a deterrent, massively destabilize local economies with the scads of coins and gems they find (and usually coins that would have been minted in long-lost societies from the past, or were stolen from their rightful owners, often as a reason to send the PCs after them in the first place), on and on.

Looked at logically, PCs would be seen as a seriously unwelcome hazard in most small villages/towns, and would be watched heavily and encouraged to move on in larger cities (once their presence was noticed, which it will invariably be when PCs start acting like PCs).

A PC's life is often along the lines of, ""You have a thing. I want the thing. I'll find any flimsy rationale I can to try to take the thing without being labeled a criminal. Sometimes I won't care if I'm labeled a criminal, because I can far outrun any of your measly guards' ability to catch me, and when I return I won't look like I do now, so you can't even keep me out of your city. If you call down the thunder, so will I: I'll level your city with a few natural disasters or reality-altering magic, and retreat to the demiplane my Wizard buddy made for our group, and you'll never find me.""",2016-01-19 17:00:22+00:00,cz42vjx,1.0,t3_41nubq,27291.0,Pathfinder_RPG

It's adding insult to injury to put those out as additional purchasable add-ons; I already paid for the campaign. I don't want to pay more for maps. It should be part of it.

229,"Pathfinder is very rules-heavy. It requires more system mastery to operate at a baseline level than 5E does.

It's also a different beast. Pathfinder comes from 3rd Edition of D&amp;D, which was sort of the culmination of a focus on legacy players vs. new players. 3rd Edition (actually 3.5, a 3rd Edition revision which Pathfinder continued under the Open Gaming License after Wizards of the Coast had moved on to an entirely new mechanic in 4th Edition, largely in an effort to capture the MMO generation) was the distillation of nearly 30 years of D&amp;D legacy thinking in terms of classes, spell approach, and systems, attempting to clean up inconsistencies by applying a universal rule of ""Higher is always better"", and otherwise just blazing forward.

Lots of third-party material was also published for 3rd Edition, since it was the first edition of D&amp;D under an Open Gaming License. Paizo's thoughts, when WotC had moved on to 4th Edition, were, ""We love the system of 3.5, and there's no reason not to continue to develop products for it, so we'll just rename the game, and keep going.""

5E has as little to do with 3.5 as 4E did. Aside from the Sorcerer class (which made its first appearance in the 3.0 Player's Handbook), and something CALLED feats (but which are nothing like feats from 3.0/3.5), they're entirely separate mechanics.

The thing to realize about Pathfinder is there's a rule for practically **everything**. If there isn't, it isn't a far stretch to apply the concept from another rule, and if that doesn't work, you just create a house rule.

5th Edition is made to let a new player spend about 30 minutes reading the Player's Handbook, 15 minutes making a character, and then just GOING. It's terrific for bringing in new players to the RPG hobby, which is its ultimate purpose.

Conversely, I don't recommend a new player tries to play Pathfinder without either a **very** patient group to teach them as they go, or without reading the entire section on their class, as well as the entire Combat chapter, from the Core Rulebook (or the [Source Reference Document](www.d20pfsrd.com) if they don't want to spend money). Reading the entire Skills &amp; Feats chapter also isn't a bad idea. You're generally looking at 1-2 hours lead-time as a new player in Pathfinder, plus another 30-45 minutes to create your character (a decent portion of which is just filling out your character sheet). Lead time gets bigger if you're not starting at 1st level.

It isn't that a 5E player will have a more difficult time learning Pathfinder; a lot of the general concepts of tabletop RPGs stay the same as 5E. It's just learning the new rules.

So it comes down to ""required rules mastery"" vs. ""quick setup and play"".",2016-01-18 19:07:31+00:00,cz2zr3a,1.0,t3_41gdcs,66703.0,Pathfinder_RPG

Some allowance is made for battle circumstances changing what they were thinking about, but in general, particularly once you have at least 5 people (including the GM) at the table, rounds start taking time, so should be sped along.

The initial idea of the ""core"" classes (Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Mage, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Wizard) came from Pathfinder's origin as 3rd Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons (those were the classes in the original Player's Handbook for 3.0, one of three ""Core Rulebooks"", the other two being Dungeon Master's Guide and the first Monster Manual).

Pathfinder at this point has moved far past its origins as 3.5 D&amp;D. Golarion's as developed as the Forgotten Realms ever has been, full (if third party) conversions have been done for almost every campaign world that existed in 2nd Edition (I'm slavering over the Ravenloft conversion that's been done right now; my campaign is coming up in a few months, and I'm pitching my players headlong into the Demiplane of Dread), and even problematic elements of 3.5 have been cleaned up/refined (I didn't think psionics could get any more awesome than the 3.5 Expanded Psionics Handbook, until Dreamscarred Press put out Ultimate Psionics for Pathfinder; it's rare I'd consider a rulebook worth its $80 cover price, but this one is).

Hell, to be honest, all the splatbooks for Pathfinder are easily available as free (if not legal) PDFs at this point anyway. The Core Rulebook was published 7 years ago now, and 3rd Edition first reared its head in 2000, meaning it's 16 years old (which also means 16 nearly-consistent years of iteration if you include Pathfinder, after WotC diverged off into 4th Edition).

The more I think about it, the more I think I'd love a revised Core Rulebook that incorporated all existing classes, an updated, all-inclusive feat list, all commonly-played races (and not just the ""core"" races of elf, half-elf, halfling, half-orc, human, gnome, dwarf, etc.).

I mean, I don't think it'll happen, because RPGs seem to be in a bit of a slump right now, and there probably isn't a ton of money to be made with publishing a new massive 500+ page rulebook.

239,"Campaigns are about pacing, and about balancing the desires of the GM (presumably to provide a challenging adventure and watch the players overcome difficulties) with the desires of the players (kill or otherwise overcome as many challenges as possible while maximizing item and power growth.

So if you look at the Encounter Design section of the Core Rulebook, you'll see that the GM has to make an active choice on how challenging they want a given encounter to be. They then proceed with encounter budgets as indicated.

The pacing comes in thusly: you want a mixture of difficult encounters (they'll use up most, if not all, of the PCs' available daily resources) and easy encounters (the PCs will steamroll the fight). The latter is there to increase the fun factor on the assumption that players like feeling powerful. One-shotting a creature is just satisfying.

A ""challenging"" or ""grinder"" campaign is one where nearly every encounter is challenging. At low levels, your primary spellcasters will be asking (frequently) for a full 8-hour rest between encounters so they can be viable. I don't recommend campaigns like this in general, though if your group is right for it, have at it.

Also keep this in mind: Rise of the Runelords is designed for a 4-person party, and the Challenge Rating system assumes a party of 4-5 PCs. If you have more, you need to start raising the Challenge Rating of your encounters appropriately to maintain parity with the original design intent of the prepublished material. In short, your 6-person party will definitely be stomping low-level creatures in encounters designed for a 4-person party. [Per the Encounter Design Rules you should consider your Average Party Level to be 1 higher than the actual average level of the party.](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering#Step-1-Determine-APL).

So look at the encounter you have coming up, the two human skeletons. What's the CR of that encounter? Raise it by one. Easiest way to do this is to add another couple skeletons (two skeletons isn't quite a CR 1 encounter, as they're individually CR 1/3, so adding two more should probably be relatively equivalent).

For the stuff they want to buy, it's going to be based off the size of available settlements. [You can find information on settlements and their purchase limits here.](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/settlements)",2016-01-14 21:22:36+00:00,cyye998,1.0,t3_40zjj6,2014.0,Pathfinder_RPG
240,"What level are they? That's a good thing for 1st or maybe 2nd level characters to deal with. The challenge comes with how easy water is to find. If it's a challenge to find, it might require Survival checks to locate (or Perception), and maybe straight Constitution checks to get it back to the area soon enough to keep the fire from advancing. It would require a fair amount of math to track distance from water (once it's found) to the fire in conjunction with the players' movement rates. You'd want to have a table of progression for the fire (such as ""Round 1: Fire starts. Round 2: Fire progresses to 'x' location in the inn. Round 3: Fire has consumed 'x' location in the inn"", etc.) so you know what happens in the time the PCs are acquiring the water.

The thing with fire is this: *Create Water* is a 0-level (i.e., free to cast repeatedly, once per round) spell for Clerics &amp; Druids. They can create 2 gallons per level with each casting.

245,"1. Help her understand the mechanic is honestly very simple: roll the 20-sided die, add bonuses (or subtract them if there's a penalty), and compare that against the difficulty class (or Armor Class).

2. Let her know there's a lot of nuanced rules mastery that will arise, but it isn't stuff she needs to worry about right at the outset.

3. Ask her what fantasy trope is most appealing to her. Does she want to be a wizard, a warrior, a priest or a scoundrel? Make comparisons to popular movie fantasy or sci-fi tropes if it'll help. If she says, ""Han Solo was cool..."", you've got a Rogue on your hands.

4. Explain her options to her with each combat encounter. ""This thing is within one square of you; if you try to use your spell that close, the creature gets a free attack on you. If you back up too much, it gets a free attack on you. But if you move just one square back, you're safe to use your spell.""

5. Explain her skills to her as something her character does when they aren't fighting. Don't worry too much about combat applications of skills yet. 

6. Play at home or in an otherwise-controlled environment. I hate to say it, but playing in public can be intimidating for a new player, particularly if it's close quarters (like so many gaming shops and bookstores are).

7. Give her time to make her choices. They can seem overwhelming. Communicate to her that she can do whatever she wants, and then try to figure out a way to make the mechanics work to let her try it.

8. Don't leave blank spaces on her character sheet if you can avoid it. Make sure the skills that require training are clearly marked so she knows that without ranks in that skill, she can't even try to use it. Otherwise, fill in racial, class and ability bonuses on every skill, not just the ones she put ranks in.

9. Unless she's playing a spellcaster, avoid more nuanced attack types (touch AC, etc.). Let her grasp the simple concept of Armor Class before you start telling her how it can change based on a variety of conditions and circumstances.

10. Keep her limited to the classes in the Core Rulebook. It's just easier that way. I've been playing tabletop RPGs for 30 years now, and I **still** don't want to go near a Summoner, and honestly get kind of nervously sweaty with using archetypes.

11. Let her know that at the core of it all, tabletop RPGs are a social experience: you're getting together and hanging out with friends while you're all telling a cooperative story.

12. When you introduce her to the rest of your gaming group, tell them all to shower (you wouldn't think it'd be an issue, but it sadly often still is).

248,"Crafting is meant to give a modicum of control to players over what items they have, but it seems the general approach over the years has been to tailor treasure hoards to some degree to be useful to PCs. No one cares about a +2 Holy polearm if no one in the group is using polearms.  If there's one melee character in the group who's a Power Attacking nutjob wielding a huge greataxe, they're going to blink at a magical longsword and see it as potential gold meant to be actualized the instant someone can be found to buy it.

It makes little sense for a GM who allows crafting to make a crafter fumble over even knowing what a particular magical item is; they may have never found a giant in their adventures, but if the Fighter wants something to make them stronger, the Wizard is probably going to know enough to craft a Belt of Giant Strength.

The instant you ascribe gold value to a magical item, you have to acknowledge that there's a magic item economy in the world. At that point it becomes flavor. You aren't likely to stumble on a ""magic item shop"", but there are probably dealers in enchanted curios in large cities, who cater to the rich and influential who covet items of magical power. Their stock is likely limited, and they probably didn't buy it off adventurers who carted in a Bag of Holding full of unwanted magical items.

Personally, I'm almost inclined in my next campaign to say there aren't any magical item economies at all; I can provide liquid cash easily enough via a treasure hoard. I'm inclined to say that magic items the players don't want can be either sold to a crazed Wizard who will just break the item down into components used for crafting (with equivalent gold piece value), or the players, if they have item creation feats, can break unwanted items down themselves into components.",2016-01-13 16:55:27+00:00,cywrwg2,1.0,t3_40osai,66962.0,Pathfinder_RPG

If you're casting a spell with a casting time longer than a Standard action (casting time 1 round or longer), and you take damage prior to completion of the casting time, you'll need to make a concentration check.

You don't need to roll to hit with many spells.

In this case, make your attack roll (your Base Attack Bonus plus either Strength bonus for a melee touch attack or Dexterity bonus for a ranged touch attack).

If a spell's casting time is 1 standard action (or less, i.e., a free action or a swift action), you're typically only going to worry about a concentration check if there are extenuating circumstances (readied action to attack you, environmental or ongoing damage, etc.).

In the milieu of Pathfinder, they make spellcasters use up valuable preparation slots (or even more valuable spells-known slots if you're a spontaneous caster) on *Comprehend Languages* or a valuable head slot for a Helm of Comprehend Languages, or valuable skill points on learning as many languages as possible just to get around the otherwise-pointless hurdle.

This is one of those things that has some neat ""fluff"" (flavor), but serves no real practical purpose. I'm seriously considering just using a Common tongue for my own upcoming campaign. Even reclusive elves who occasionally deal with humans on frontiers near their sacred, otherwise-inviolable forests will learn to speak the human tongue, which is probably easier than teaching a human all the nuances that would creep into an elvish tongue developed over countless millenia.

Pick up the ""Planes of Law"" boxed set, as well as the standard Planescape stuff (the campaign boxed set, the Planewalker's Handbook, Dead Gods as an adventure, and the Blood War boxed set are, hands down, the best materials they released). Lots of story hooks in there, as the whole point of that campaign setting was to make the planes a viable place for players to adventure from 1st to 20th level (Sigil, the City of Doors, has survived in some incarnation on into 5th Edition; it appeared in the 4th Edition Dungeon Master's Guide 2, and is in the 5th Edition DMG as well; it came from Planescape).",2015-10-08 13:58:02+00:00,cvsgqma,1.0,t3_3nxo8i,32135.0,Pathfinder_RPG
270,"In general, it's good to remember that in all but the most remote villages (who likely wouldn't have ""guards"" to begin with, and more probably just have a couple volunteer constables), guards are operating in a world where adventurers armed with powerful magic are a semi-regular thing. People decked out in enchanted armor made in bygone ages, carrying powerfully enchanted weapons, armed with mighty spells that can at their most powerful alter the fabric of reality merely by the caster speaking their will... these are things guards will expect.

Consequently, most formal guard units are likely to be equipped with more than a shortsword, studded leather armor and a buckler. :P

In general, players from 1-10th level should be concerned about guards. After 10th level, they should still be wary, but start to realize most guards won't be ready on the spot to deal with them, but can do so with a small bit of preparation. After 13th or 14th level, guards cease to be an issue in all but the largest cities (or planar metropolises...).

But also keep in mind that it doesn't always have to be a direct confrontation. Players might overcome the guards, but they may not appreciate more specialized forces either coming to deal with them when the actual liege of the land sends his/her forces to quiet things down, or worse, just outright bans the PCs from the area. At the end of a long dungeon delve, resources are depleted, spells are gone for the day, hit points are low, and players need to rest in some safe and comfortable inns to recuperate, to pore over the shineys they got, and the casters may be looking to do some research or item crafting... only to discover they're not only unwelcome in the given kingdom, but are actively wanted for crimes against the crown, and are likely to be extradited back if the neighboring kingdoms are at peace and have trade agreements in place (and the Inner Sea is a fairly organized, cooperative place for the most part).

I guess what I'm saying is actions have consequences, and there are ways for the guards to punish PCs that have nothing to do with them drawing their weapons and bashing their poorly-helmeted heads up against the wall of reality-altering heroes.",2015-10-07 17:33:56+00:00,cvrhnv5,1.0,t3_3nsml4,51475.0,Pathfinder_RPG

I rarely hear, at this point, about multiclassing or even Prestige Class usage outside of people who enjoy an optimization playstyle.

272,"1. Rule Zero.

2. If you're really upset with a ruling I made that DIDN'T result in your character's death or in a meaningful loss of valuable resources/magic/whatever, please wait til the end of the session, and bring it up then.

3. Don't politic behind my back with other players. Player collusion just tells me no one's having fun with my game, and I'd rather people just tell me so I can either fix it or step down to play while someone else GMs.

4. Don't be a rules lawyer. If I just outright missed an easily-found ruling, I'll change it when you point it out. If your complaint relies on a niche situation with a very obscure, rarely-used rule that requires a specific interpretation I may or may not share, just let it go. I caution against making characters that rely on such rulings unless you want to spend some time with me beforehand to make sure you and I both agree on something working the way you think it does/want it to.

5. Don't get upset when bad things happen to your character. I'm not singling you out, but tend to GM with the broad rule of ""Actions have consequences."" I encourage you to think about what you're doing, particularly in towns large/organized enough to have a formal guard force. They may not be as powerful as you are, but they're quite well equipped, and they have the benefit of numbers. In any town adventurers normally pass through, the town guard isn't being unreasonable in spending the gold to equip their soldiers with magic items and possibly training them in the restraint/detainment of powerful adventurers who choose to be recalcitrant.

6. Don't act against the best interests of the party. Just don't. If you're a Rogue, don't steal from the party. If you're a Paladin, don't be a killjoy for the party. If you're Chaotic Neutral, don't go Leeroy Jenkins-ing into the room when your party is spending the time to formulate what they hope is a good plan to mitigate risk or otherwise be strategic.

7. House Rule - A natural 1 on an attack roll (of any kind, including spells) is a critical fumble. You drop your weapon/bowstring breaks/spell components are dropped/crossbow jams/whatever. It takes a standard action to recover.

8. Keep real-life disagreements out of the game. Zero tolerance for this: snippiness/pettiness/drama bombs are not tolerated. You get one warning, then you're out and done. Better choice: don't game with your ex, and work out problems between friends on your time, not mine.

9. WANT to be involved. You don't have to bite at every plot bait I put out there, but if you're not biting at anything, and haven't otherwise told me that this just isn't doing it for you, I'm assuming you want to play the game, and will not make it unreasonably difficult for me to put you on the path to doing so.

I find that searchable PDFs on a tablet are best for this.

That said, if there are too many encounters where only one PC at a time can really contribute, you might want to rethink your design.

""That's what my character would do!"" is, as Javaed noted, often what's said to deflect irritation at a player who's just being a troll (for lack of a better term; the behavior existed long before the Internet codified it).

It's one thing if it's done for comedic value and isn't otherwise meaningfully disruptive, but in my 30 years of playing RPGs, I've seen it used to explain a Rogue trying to steal from the party, a Paladin turning the whole party in because they were trying to steal something from the (otherwise evil) lord's cache of treasure, etc.

If someone legitimately thinks it's what their character would do, I suppose they should do it. But at the end of the day, Pathfinder is still a game, and the ultimate goal of any game is to have fun. Fun is even the one thing that trumps Rule Zero. If at any point any player (including the GM) is in question over a decision they're about to make, they should ask themselves: ""Will this be fun for most of the players at the table?"" If the answer is ""no"", they shouldn't do it.

And if that action countermands the personality they've crafted for the character performing the action, the simple reality is they chose poorly in the construction of that character's personality. The ""lone wolf"" who doesn't want to cooperate, the Chaotic Neutral ""anarchist"" who refuses to bite on adventure hooks ""because they're just unpredictable"", the ""secretly evil"" character who sabotages the rest of the group at a moment of vulnerability... these are not things that belong in most games, and they're things that will, almost every time, cause me to just close up the tablet I'm using to reference rules, drop my dice and miniature in my bag, nod politely at everyone at the table, and go home, and put in the effort to find another group.",2015-10-06 14:47:09+00:00,cvq47no,1.0,t3_3np9x6,6602.0,Pathfinder_RPG

This is the sort of thing holy crusades are started over.

Every god has adventurers who worship him or her, and those adventurers can be just as powerful (if not moreso) than the PCs. For every reasonably-played Paladin (they DO exist!), there are those who are as narrow-minded, zealous and stiff-necked as the stereotype, and with their proclivity for gathering hordes and whipping them into shape as an army, the PCs' lives can be made very tough for awhile.

This said, realize that the general feeling is at the end of everything, the PCs should ""win"", because that's the most fun. If you want your party to thumb their nose at the gods and have evidence they can do so, throw stuff at them that will challenge them, but that they'll overcome. If you want them to lose, throw powerful stuff at them and make it known in some fashion that the whole thing can be glossed over if they'll make reparations of some sort to the offended god (which can be used for a couple of tangential sessions).

298,"The inherent problem with a preparation-based caster is the set of rigid boxes they're put into. They, in theory, ""know"" these spells, but they're limited by whatever they can anticipate ahead of time as they prepare each day. Did you come on a surprise Evoker? Dang, but some resistance spells could be handy, but you didn't prepare those; you were anticipating coming up against hordes of enemies, so you prepared a lot of blasting spells instead.

Are you an Enchanter? Oops, you just came up against a lot of undead. Those charm spells aren't going to do you much good. There's a large part of your output wasted for the day.

Meanwhile, a spontaneous caster has the spells they know, which they can call on at any time as long as their much more generic resource (""magic"") isn't depleted for the day.

At the pinnacle of that are psionic characters (if you allow psionics). They use a point-based resource system. They always have their powers at hand, it's just a question of whether they have the Power Points to spend to manifest them. Same with Sorcerers, Bards, etc. Their spells are always there, it's just a question of whether they have the available spell slots to cast them.

Except they're still limited by spell slots. If you've blown your 3rd level spell slots for the day, it doesn't matter that you know *Fireball*. You can't cast it. But if you haven't also blown your 4th level slots for the day, you somehow still have the ""power"" to cast more powerful spells?

I think this is why the Vancian system (the traditional D&amp;D/Pathfinder magic system is based on the works of fantasy author Jack Vance, the ""fire and forget"" system) just doesn't make a lot of sense. WotC realized that when they were building 3rd Edition. The Sorcerer was the first time in D&amp;D when there were casters who didn't require time at the start of every day to pick out their spells ahead of time. Attempts at point-based alternative magic systems had occurred previously, but this was the first full-support non-memorization/preparation system in the game's history.

If there are classes this player of yours wants to try, consider adopting the point system that Ultimate Psionics uses. Psionic powers are still on a 9-level system like spells. Each level of psionic power costs a certain number of points to cast, and a 2nd level Psion can still only manifest 1st level psionic powers, because they haven't learned 2nd level ones yet, just like a Wizard in the same circumstances. Aside from that, a 2nd level psionic power, for example, costs 3 Power Points, so used for a Wizard, a 2nd level spell would cost 3 ""spell points"".

The practical effect to this is that spontaneous casters no longer have much reason to exist. The superior spell selection and quicker spell progression of a Wizard would let them far outstrip Sorcerers with a point-based system.

But to me, it doesn't make sense that you know a certain spell inside and out, but can't cast it (regardless of available resources) because you didn't think to memorize its incantations at the start of the day.",2015-10-01 15:32:39+00:00,cvkklcy,1.0,t3_3n3fb7,10885.0,Pathfinder_RPG

They could be driven entirely by vengeance, and rigidly adhere to the principles of their deity above and beyond the laws of man, or they could merely make the safety and well-being of the general populace their primary objective, which might on occasion put them at odds with whatever authority is in the area at the time.

Nothing is going to make someone dig in on an erroneous interpretation of the rules more than an attempt at publicly calling them out. Yes, it's petty, but if they think a rule works one way and it doesn't, calling them out is fundamentally calling into question their comprehension ability, which many people just don't take kindly to.

It's also a GM trick, though, so be aware. If they just don't want to argue about it, all they have to say is ""Rule Zero"" or ""it's a house rule"", and that ends the conversation.",2015-09-30 19:45:49+00:00,cvjnudr,1.0,t3_3mzofi,8420.0,Pathfinder_RPG

305,"I personally implement the following house rules in my games:

1) A natural 1 on an attack roll is a critical failure. You have to use your next round to recover your weapon/restring your bow/pick up dropped spell components (if you were casting a spell requiring an attack roll), etc.

2) A natural 20 on a critical confirmation roll increases your crit multiplier by 1.

3) *Haste* works like the 3.0 version, because it's never made sense to me that while martial classes get more efficient with their output at higher levels (i.e., more attacks per round), spellcasters never get past being able to cast a single spell a round without the use of Quicken Spell.

4) Critical hits are multiplied, not rolled multiple times. If your crit multiplier is x2 and you do d8+10 damage per hit, then you roll your d8, add 10, and multiply the result by 2. Keeps players from having to potentially have a crit that could wind up doing worse than a regular hit if their dice turn against them. Additional dice of damage are still not multiplied, however (Sneak Attack, the Soulknife's Psychic Strike, etc.).

I'm considering in future campaigns putting preparation spellcaster classes on a point system like what manifesters use from Ultimate Psionics. I've never been a particular fan of the Vancian magic system, and magic feels more ""magical"" to me if a Wizard who in theory ""knows"" a spell can just keep casting it til they've used up their reserve of magical energy, instead of saying, ""I only prepared two of this spell for today, and somehow I just don't remember how to cast it again until after I've gone to sleep for 8 hours.""",2015-09-30 15:39:23+00:00,cvjde6m,1.0,t3_3mwcul,58012.0,Pathfinder_RPG

The only time power disparities in a group start causing headaches for GMs is when you have parts of the group who optimized their characters, and parts who didn't. By putting in tougher monsters to challenge the optimized PCs, you wind up potentially sandblasting the unoptimized PCs. If you have a group with mixed gaming experience like that, I'd recommend having everyone make their characters at the table, and ask your more experienced players to help out the less experienced ones so you have a generally even spread of capability.

318,"[This page](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering#Table-Encounter-Design) indicates that the assumed party size is 4 or 5 players (under ""Step 1 - Determine Average Party Level""). Determine your average party level, then determine how challenging you want a given encounter to be (there's no formula for determining how challenging the GM wants it to be; there's a formula for selecting the CR **AFTER** you've determined how challenging you want it to be).

So if you have a party of 4 1st level characters, you have a party whose APL (Average Party Level) is 1.  This means if you want them to have an average encounter, you put them up against a CR 1 encounter (which is one creature of CR 1, or 4 creatures of CR 1/4, or 2 creatures of CR 1/2, etc.) If you want them to have a hard encounter, that's a CR equal to APL +2, meaning you put them up against a single CR 3 creature, a CR 1 &amp; CR 2, etc.).

Does that help?

As for your question on the Level 20 Sorcerer with an army of goblins... that isn't enough to determine the data you're seeking. The level 20 Sorcerer, if it's of a standard race, is going to be CR 19 on its own (as NPCs whose CR is solely a function of their class levels are CR X-1, where ""X"" equals their class level). Your average run-of-the-mill goblin is CR 1/3, but goblins can have class levels, there are mightier goblins than just ""goblin"" (hobgoblins, etc.).  But in general, if you've got a 20th level Sorcerer, that one Sorcerer alone is a sufficient challenge for a party of 4 19th level PCs using the straight CR rules.

319,"In the late 90s, TSR (the company with which Dungeons &amp; Dragons originated) went bankrupt. Wizards of the Coast, who was producing (and being very successful with) Magic: The Gathering was largely populated by people who cut their fantasy gaming teeth on D&amp;D, and didn't want to see it go away. They purchased TSR (and its intellectual properties, chief among them Dungeons &amp; Dragons), and in 2000, proceeded to release Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition. The biggest changes they made were the removal of THAC0 (an acronym for ""To Hit Armor Class 0""), standardization of experience tables (in 1st and 2nd Edition, some classes took more XP to level up than others), removal of race/class restrictions (previous editions kept some races from choosing particular classes), and adoption of a general ""higher is always better"" approach to game mechanics (in 2nd Edition, for example, you'd roll a d10 for initiative, but the **lower** result was the winner; likewise, Armor Class went from the lowest of 10 to the highest of -10).

Concurrent with 3rd Edition (""3.0"") was the development of the d20 System, a unified mechanic that could be used with any game under the Open Gaming License. The biggest major releases that came from this were the Star Wars RPG (taken from West End Games and produced by WotC), ""d20 Modern"" (playing the d20 System in a modern setting to compete with the very successful White Wolf games) and a (relatively poor, as is often the case with licensed properties) RPG for Wheel of Time.

There were some glaring rules issues with 3.0, so at one point a few years later, WotC released a revision called 3.5.  It cleaned up most of the inconsistencies in 3.0, made a few major changes (I'm still personally smarting over the change to the *Haste* spell...), and moved forward.

Eventually, WotC released 4th Edition, which was a major mechanics change (I'll avoid ""edition wars"" by electing to not give my view of that edition).  However, this change left players with a massive 3.5 library of books that were no longer useful for anything aside from ""fluff"" (non-rules-based RP material, the ""flavor text""), and also left a sizable number of players who enjoyed 3.5's rules without official support. 

Paizo decided to keep producing material for the 3.5 rule set, and called it ""Pathfinder"", able to use all the core rules under the Open Gaming License. This had the benefit of keeping all the existing 3.5 content viable for people to use, with new content being produced by Paizo for Pathfinder (though the world-specific stuff is copyrighted to Paizo, and not part of the OGL; only the rules are). It had the downside of sort of 'splitting' the gaming community; people who insisted on playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons migrated to 4th Edition (and now 5th), while people who really liked the 3.5 ruleset moved to Pathfinder.

Despite being ""competitors"" with WotC, relations between Paizo and WotC are pretty amicable. Paizo is a financial contributor to the main D&amp;D convention, GenCon, which happens in Indianapolis every year. The two companies are separated by about 20 minutes of driving in the Seattle area (more like an hour with Seattle traffic being what it is...), and a lot of the 3.5 people from WotC have since produced material for Paizo (like Mr. Psionics himself, Bruce Cordell, though psionics is now the province of Dreamscarred Press, who produced a spectacularly amazing Paizo-supported book called Ultimate Psionics).

Transitioning from Pathfinder to the current edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons isn't **hard**, but you're dealing with two very different rules systems. Aside from both using d20s and having the same six character stats, hit points and Armor Class, the systems have nothing in common.

Past that... you're wondering if it's ""worth it"" to learn 5E and other systems. That's purely a judgment call. I personally quite like 5th Edition, and found it easy to pick up and logically consistent within its own ruleset. Numbers stay low, which helps keep power and stat creep from happening (Armor Classes can reach into the 60s with optimized higher-level classes in Pathfinder; if you get above the mid 20s in 5th Edition, you're either doing something wrong, or you're in highly unusual circumstances), and the system is very easy to pick up, particularly for new players (which are largely who WotC is courting with 5th Edition; it's a wise move; the gaming community's gotten kind of inbred as people sidestepped 4th Edition and either moved to other games or used 3.5 in Pathfinder, so the hobby can use some new blood). You can make a character and be sitting down to play in under 30 minutes with 5th Edition. If you REALLY know what you're doing and have strong system mastery, you *might* have a character for Pathfinder complete in 30 minutes. With feat choices, traits, backgrounds, Archetypes, racial variants, and even classes outside the Core Rulebook, the breadth of choices Pathfinder offers a player can bog down character creation (and honestly, the system takes some time to learn at a functional level; there's a lot of math to keep track of).",2015-09-28 15:49:28+00:00,cvgyxow,1.0,t3_3mlvfu,74353.0,Pathfinder_RPG

329,"If the concern is psionics is ""overpowered"", the Golden Rule of Psionics (as the term is coined in Ultimate Psionics) erases that concern. I'll get to it in a moment.

Typically concern over psionics (concern that isn't based on flavor, at least) is sourced in misunderstanding. It uses a different resource system (points instead of preparation slots, though preparation isn't even an issue for spontaneous caster classes), it isn't technically ""magic"", and both 2nd Edition and 3rd Edition had system structures that lent themselves to rampant psionics abuse (2nd Edition didn't have the manifestations that 3rd Edition introduced, which meant a Psionicist who could manage to hide could just use *Molecular Agitation* with impunity until the foes were nickel-and-dimed to death. They literally couldn't tell where the attack was coming from as they were being boiled alive.

With 3rd Edition, the augmentation feature was introduced: make your powers more powerful by pumping more Power Points into them. No cap was put on this, so if a character was willing to nova, they could end most encounters in a single round (particularly if they were Kineticists, the blaster of all blaster classes).

This is what led to the Golden Rule of Psionics, which states a psionic character can't spend more points on a power than they have manifester levels. It means if you have a 17th level Psion manifesting a 7th level power (which costs 13 power points), they can only augment it by another 4 power points before they hit the cap.

The ""it isn't quite magic"" is addressed by the default rule, which is called Psionics/Magic Transparency. This rule states that psionics and magic are fully interactive. *Dispel Magic* will dispel a psionic effect, *Null Psionics Field* will nullify magic, etc. This keeps it in line with the rest of the game, though it loses some of its unique flavor if it's really ""just another kind of magic"". But this is often enough to convince GMs to let a player use it.

335,"**In General**
1) Spare Dice. Sometimes your dice just turn on you.
2) Two spare character sheets. 1 blank, 1 filled out with an alternate character in case your main one dies and can't be brought back. It means you have to spend time leveling up two characters when you ding, but your DM and group will appreciate not having to lose 30 minutes to an hour while you put together a new character. Be sure to check with your GM as you level up your alt to see if they're fine with your prechoosing your magic items so that character comes properly equipped if they ever come into play.

3) A calculator. I mostly use it to add up XP, but it has its uses for PCs as well.
4) A spare Core Rulebook, Ultimate Equipment Guide &amp; Ultimate Magic. This is just helpful for players who need to refer to entries on magic items and uncommon spells they use, so they aren't using up books the GM needs to keep on hand.
5) Reference cards. If you have variable bonuses (like if you're taking a penalty to hit for more damage), effects on crits, etc., having entries on how many of what dice to roll and what bonuses to add makes it quicker for your turn to pass than making everyone sit there while you figure out how many d6s, d8s and d10s you need to roll, and what uncommon bonus just got added to your regular per-round damage, etc. Trust me, your GM and the other players will love you, and unless you're otherwise a dick, you'll ALWAYS get invited back (and to future games if you live in an area with a robust RPG community).

**For Me Personally**
1) Ultimate Psionics. When given the chance, I will ALWAYS play a psionic character.
2) A tablet. This contains searchable PDFs, dice-rolling apps so I don't have to have more than a single set of polyhedrals on the table (with maybe an extra d8 and couple extra d6s, just in case), and other resources to make my life easier and help for quick rules references when someone can't remember an obscure rule. Also makes it easier on my back; a Core Rulebook and Ultimate Psionics is already nearly 1,000 pages of rules to tote around.

**Considerate Things to Do**
1) Bring your food ahead of time so you don't interrupt the game for too long while people scramble to go to the store for food on a break, or while people figure out who has cash and who's only got plastic if you're ordering pizza. If you typically order pizza, bring cash.
2) If you play in a public place, buy something every time you're there. Gaming stores often stock soda and basic snacks. Don't use the rulebooks on their shelves for reference; that's stock that they expect people to buy to use. If you're in a coffee shop or similar space, buy some food or a drink if you're going to take up space for hours. Don't bring in outside food unless their selection is limited, and you've cleared it ahead of time with the owner(s) (this works best for independent coffee shops like the one I play in; Starbucks is not a good place to play tabletop RPGs, or spend time there doing anything other than chatting with coworkers or parents who are busy bussing their toddlers around in strollers).
3) Bathe. Seriously. Do it regularly (at least every other day, and use a tiny bit more deodorant on the in-between days). You're in close quarters with other humans. We ALL stink. It's nothing personal. Practice basic hygiene.",2015-09-24 17:07:19+00:00,cvcqwki,1.0,t3_3m7js7,5895.0,Pathfinder_RPG
336,"The biggest contributions Paizo has made, IMO, are their perpetuation of 3.5 and the OGL. WotC adopted a much more restrictive licensing approach when they did 4th Edition (and to be honest, I'm STILL not sure why they went with such a radical new mechanics approach to Dungeons &amp; Dragons when there was so much material out there for 3.5; a 4th Edition that was to 3.5 what 2nd Edition was to 1st Edition, i.e., a refinement and massive fix for glaring issues, would have been much more preferable), but a lot of people had spent a lot of money on 3.0/3.5 material that, if they had stuck with Dungeons &amp; Dragons as their primary fantasy RPG, was completely worthless for anything other than story ideas. I STILL think 4th Edition was the biggest misstep in Dungeons &amp; Dragons history since 1st Edition psionics...

341,"I can't recommend looking into 2nd Edition Planescape material highly enough for this kind of thing. You'll have to put in some work to make it function mechanically with 3.5/Pathfinder, but just for sheer ideas, it's a treasure trove.

It presumes a ""great wheel"" cosmology, where the belief of people has a tangible effect on the real estate of the planes. If you get enough people in an area that's, say, Chaotic Neutral in comportment, to start behaving in Chaotic Evil fashion, that planar real estate will slowly shift over until it just merges with the Abyss.

On to your questions:

1) Survival in other planes depends entirely on the plane in question. In general, the Outer Planes are survivable for mortals (aside from unfortunate encounters with local denizens; the environments themselves are typically mortal-friendly, however). A few exceptions exist (particularly in the Abyss, and a couple parts of the Nine Hells), but for the most part, adventurers are just going to find penalties/bonuses vs. outright deadly environments. The Inner Planes (the elemental planes, Positive/Negative Planes, etc.) are a different story, and typically require magic (in the form of items or frequently re-cast spells or permanent spells) to survive. They're hostile by nature to mortal life forms (if you can get straight into the City of Brass in the Elemental Plane of Fire you're probably fine, though ridiculously uncomfortable; walking around on the plane to get to that city could, and should, be pretty difficult/deadly without preparation).

2) Travel between planes can be as simple as a *Plane Shift* spell or as difficult as finding a stable portal (or even a temporary one that opens when certain conditions are met; look up Sigil, the City of Doors, in the aforementioned Planescape material, or for more recent versions of it, the Dungeon Master's Guide 2 from 4th Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons, or the Dungeon Master's Guide from 5th Edition).

3) Creation of a stable portal is going to likely resemble making a magic item, likely making a permanent one using the *Plane Shift* spell. Look at the magic item creation rules in the Core Rulebook.

4) You're not going to ""take over"" the Abyss, not without a lot of generosity from your GM (unless you're the GM, at which point, hey, do what you want!). It's in theory infinite, and doesn't have a singular ruler. Even the Nine Hells (which are highly organized and hierarchical) don't **technically** have a single ruler, though most just call Asmodeus the ruler of the Nine Hells and leave it at that. He isn't interested in ruling the Nine Hells, he's just interested in pursuing his own goals and continuously playing the other 8 Lords of the Nine off each other so they're busier fighting themselves than cooperating to unseat him. The Abyss is a massive, chaotic mess. Individual demon lords will rule a ""layer"" of the Abyss if they're powerful, but otherwise, the Abyss is a force unto itself.

5) You need to establish cosmology rules before you can expand the Abyss into other planes, so you have a consistent method to achieve this goal that helps provide verisimilitude to your character. If you go with the Planescape concepts, expanding the Abyss is mostly a matter of concentrating chaos and evil in an area so much that it naturally moves across planar landscape until it just merges with the Abyss on its own. If you're doing this to a single world your character is on, you may be able to open up continuous portals to flood the world with demons, who will then likely work on their own to spread chaos and evil until the world just winds up falling apart (which is a more likely result instead of a world in the Material Plane crossing that much planar landscape to land in the Abyss: it'd have to go through the Astral into the Abyss, which is just massive). You could also be really ambitious and try to create a massive world-sized portal via a heinous ritual that would just shift the whole world directly into the Abyss.

346,"The OGL (Open Gaming License) that was in place for 3rd Edition (which became 3.5, which became Pathfinder after Wizards of the Coast abandoned the system for 4th Edition) was much more generous than the current license that WotC permits for their content. It functioned just like it now does under Paizo: the ""crunch"" (the hard rules/classes/spells/system mechanics) was available for anyone, the ""fluff"" (campaign settings, specific character names, etc.) was copyrighted and available to use only with specific permission. My suspicion is this was done to save tabletop RPGs in general. When WotC purchased TSR in the late 90s (it had gone bankrupt) and acquired the Dungeons &amp; Dragons intellectual property in the acquisition, it was done with an eye towards saving a game that would have otherwise likely just disappeared, and a game that many of the folks running WotC had cut their teeth on before they'd formed WotC and gotten major success with Magic: The Gathering. The easiest way, to them, to keep interest in the game high post-acquisition was probably to make it as easy as possible to create content that could be used with the game (third-party publications were infrequent in 1st and 2nd Edition, often not licensed, and often of honestly piss-poor quality and dubious compatibility with the published rules).

To protect their intellectual property rights (Forgotten Realms remained their most reliable cash cow, as it does now, though they still maintained control over the other out-of-publication campaign settings like Planescape, Ravenloft, Spelljammer, Dragonlance, etc.), they initially withheld access to that content, but made the core D&amp;D rules available to anyone who wanted to publish content for use with the game.

The legalities relating to the original Open Gaming License that Pathfinder still operates under are more generous than the amended licensing that WotC adopted with 4th Edition. Paizo still maintains exclusive rights to their own intellectual property (the world of Golarion, the content in the Inner Sea World Guide, and any new rules published that are mutations of the core rules, such as the recent Pathfinder Unchained book; that might be under the OGL as well, I'm not sure).

Prior to 5th Edition's publication, Pathfinder had become the unquestioned king of the tabletop RPG world (and this may have had something to do with the quality of 4th Edition, though that's some of my own editorializing coming into play; I wasn't a fan), and may still be so. Paizo continues to be one of the major contributors to the ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons Convention"", better known as GenCon. It's a very friendly competition between the two companies (particularly since they're about a 20-minute drive from each other, sometimes closer to an hour with the traffic in the Seattle metropolitan area being what it is...). As long as the OGL that Pathfinder is based on stays binding, anyone can still make whatever content they like for the Pathfinder game as long as they refer people to the Core Rulebook or the original 3rd Edition or 3.5 Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual, which were the Core Rulebooks containing information covered in the OGL. If they want to set their content in Golarion, they need Paizo's permission, and can't publish with impunity. If they make their own setting and reference Paizo's Core Rulebook for Pathfinder, or the aforementioned 3.0/3.5 books from WotC, they're in the clear to publish with just a reference to the OGL placed on the book(s) (in fact, if you'll notice in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook, the indicia references ""the world's most successful tabletop role playing game"" or something similar, since they couldn't use the term ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"" without Wizards of the Coast's permission).

The TL;DR answer to your question: the first link you provided references the ""d20 System"", which is tradmarked by WotC and is more limited than the second link, which doesn't use the ""d20 System"" logo and references the broader Open Gaming License, which the d20 System also uses.",2015-09-22 20:53:53+00:00,cvambnc,1.0,t3_3lyy8n,6770.0,Pathfinder_RPG
347,"The ""rule of thumb"" is you put as many hours of prep into a session as you expect it to run. I've found over the years this is pretty mutable as a rule, however.

I, for example, hate the physical process of setting out terrain and placing minis. I love writing story elements and setting up moments for the PCs to interact with, but I start to feel like I'd rather be at work getting paid when I have to start statting out the encounters. It's ruined my willingness to persist with more than one campaign over the years, but I realize I just kinda have to suck it up and work with it if I want to run campaigns.

Plus, count on this: your players are going to go in directions you aren't ready for, and they're going to circumvent encounters that you've decided are integral to the advancement of your campaign, either by a strategy you didn't plan for (that results in them winning it much quicker and with less resource expenditure than you anticipated) or by just zigging when you thought they'd zag. As a result of this, you'll need to get comfortable with transposing vital combat encounters into a different area or finding alternative ways of revealing information when they didn't go where you had the information you know they need. At this point, mastery of stat blocks helps considerably, so you have something for them to do and aren't just floundering. I've been able to sometimes stall for a bit by starting some sudden RP while I feverishly worked in the background to get something ready, but sometimes you just have to let the group know you need 10-15 minutes to gather the info for an encounter, and encourage them to go take a snack break or go have a quick Hearthstone match or something.

Over time, I've learned that a session is ""ready"" when I know what story beats need to be hit, and can reference any encounter stats I need within 1-2 minutes of them becoming necessary.

348,"I like any system that removes the hard-coded interlinks alignment has with the crunchy rules in Pathfinder, but the reality is you have to alter a LOT if you do that. I'd prefer alignment wasn't a ""thing"" at all, and your character's morality was a result of their role playing and actions, and not just a player response to a pre-chosen alignment.

But to do it, the two crunchy elements impacted most are classes with alignment restrictions (Paladins, Druids, Monks) and alignment-based damage reduction. Those are relatively easily bypassable by just removing them entirely (4th Edition and now 5th Edition seem to have no issues at all with not requiring those classes to adhere to specific alignments), but those are things that have to be addressed.

Pathfinder treats alignments as cosmic absolutes. A thing that's Lawful Good is going to be Lawful Good anywhere, and requires persistent behavior to the contrary to change its alignment. When it dies, it's going to Celestia if it doesn't worship a god (and still might if its god resides in Celestia). It's affected by *Unhallow*. 

I mean, yeah, a serial killer who's just having a beer isn't BEING evil, but as far as the core rules are concerned, they ARE evil, because alignment isn't actions, it's cosmic law.

A 10th level Wizard could do the exact same number of equivalently-powered things a day as a 10th level Fighter. It felt like the differences between classes was radically diminished, which I didn't care for.

On the Pathfinder front, it sounds like your player is looking for something like I noted above, a point-based magic system where you aren't expending your available spells each day, but merely expending the resource you have for casting magic. There are practical considerations with a point-based system: the Mage constantly throwing *Fireball* because he can vs. the Mage who only prepared 2 *Fireball* spells and then has to use other resources once the situationally most-useful spells are exhausted for the day makes for a definite difference.

It also, IMO, makes for a more natural ""magic"" feel in the world, vs. one that can potentially punish a player for perhaps choosing badly in their preparation for the day. To me, once you know a spell, you **know** it.  Then it's just a matter of whether you have the resources available to power that spell.

355,"Preamble - Invisibility has always been borked, and has consistently required more adjudication on the part of a GM than anything short of the *Wish* spell. I always clench up when it comes into play.

1) Ranged attacks don't count as having reach. They're a ranged attack; an attack with reach is a melee attack that just happens to occur from a non-adjacent square. Thus, the enemy(s) hit will know something is out there, and probably have an idea of which direction the hit came from, but past that, they're going to have to puzzle out where their foe is.

2) It can, in theory, be detected. As with normal *Invisibility*, someone's going to have to try to figure out where he's at. This is where area-effect spells like *Fireball* come in very handy. ;)

3) Yes, a five-foot step is still a move. It takes up your Move Action, and is typically used to provide minimal maneuvering while taking the full-attack action.

4) ""In combat"" means just what it says. Your actions are being tracked round-by-round, there's an initiative score involved, and you're in danger.",2015-09-21 16:51:51+00:00,cv961jx,1.0,t3_3lsxxa,11577.0,Pathfinder_RPG
356,"The thing to remember about Pathfinder (and this is greatly frustrating for me) is that alignment is not a subjective thing; it's a hard-coded universal that's interwoven with the crunchy rules. Good is more than good; there's Damage Resistance built around it. Alignment is a universal constant; you *could* have a pit fiend who isn't Lawful Evil, but if you have a Lawful Evil pit fiend, they're going to react to anything targeting Lawful Evil like anything else that's LE.

In short, alignment is a choice based on behavior, but once your behavior puts you in a particular ""barrel"", you suffer the good and bad of that barrel.

There are a lot of awesome RP opportunities involved with alignment, but in Pathfinder, it's a rules element as well, and a heavily baked-in one. There were, to me, very few things that 4th Edition D&amp;D got right, but one of them was simplifying alignments and removing a lot of the hard-coding that was legacy from previous editions (such as no longer requiring Paladins to be Lawful Good; taking away that requirement in Pathfinder requires retooling fundamental parts of the class design and abilities).

I kinda wish alignment would go away altogether, and just let each character's morality and social outlook be determined by role playing, and not by ticking off a box on a Venn Diagram.",2015-09-18 14:33:17+00:00,cv5vjez,1.0,t3_3lf6k4,10004.0,Pathfinder_RPG

New players have a tendency to go with flashier things, so they're likely to go straight for spellcasters, or fall back on familiar tropes from movies (which is a near-guarantee you're going to find an elf Ranger in the group; if one of them read R.A. Salvatore's books, you'll definitely find that person wondering if they can play a dual scimitar-wielding drow Ranger with a panther...).",2015-09-18 14:22:31+00:00,cv5v5qy,1.0,t3_3lfjh9,2518.0,Pathfinder_RPG
358,"Always remember that arrogance is a stereotype of elves that often comes from a misunderstanding of a long-lived race's perspectives, or just the way they're usually portrayed in bad fantasy novels and movies. Consider the literary (not the cinematic...) version of Legolas. He was fun-loving, active, and care-free.

Consider Elrond: he was softspoken and cautious, but decisive once he chose his course.

Consider Galadriel: she was reserved, but caring and kind.

Elves live for hundreds of years as a species (and in some texts are actually immortal, not dying of natural causes). There's a tendency to not form close attachments with members of shorter-lived races, because they're protecting their hearts from the inevitable (to them) moment when that person is going to die, and they're going to have to continue on. Naturally, then, when they DO care for someone, they're remarkably loyal and almost clingy.

Their perspective towards the shorter-lived races is often similar to that of a human adult in their late 30s or 40s looking at what kids in their teens or early 20s do: mild frustration that they're doing something the older person KNOWS is stupid or pointless, but often rueful amusement as they recall when they did the same things. Elves don't start off ""perfect"". They did/do stupid things in their younger years too.

If you want to be more active and want your character to be snobbish, consider an impatient ""Let me take care of that! You're just going to screw it up..."" approach. If they're getting excited about a new treasure, regale them with tales of when those things were common or new. If they're finding a place to camp, point out why your people would or wouldn't camp there, and what its merits or issues are.

I personally get cautious in playing arrogant elves, because it almost seems expected. Much like people roll their eyes and figure a Paladin is going to suck the fun out of everything or ruin carefully-laid plans with a sudden moment of self righteousness, others are going to see an arrogant elf as par for the course, and this may turn them off from elves entirely.

If you want a spectacular treatise on elves and their perspectives, find a copy of the 2nd Edition ""Complete Book of Elves"". It's very much worth a read.",2015-09-18 14:15:01+00:00,cv5uwfh,1.0,t3_3lf4ae,10342.0,Pathfinder_RPG

I personally like the idea of having the dead PC's ghost do something in the afterlife, a sort of really-quick quest that their god kicks in after the *Raise Dead* (or is it *Resurrection*?) is cast to prove their worth, so to speak. When an adventurer's time is come, it's come, but if they have something pressing in the mortal world, their god may let them return. It really grants a sense of the epic nature of things (even though I tend to want to go for ease on this; if they cast *Raise Dead*, then it's done, and things move on; death not being permanent is just a natural part of many adventurers' lives in a D&amp;D-style game), and gives some great storytelling opportunities and can communicate to the players that there's always more going on in the world/multiverse than even they're aware of.",2015-09-17 14:12:58+00:00,cv4oio4,1.0,t3_3la9d8,15224.0,Pathfinder_RPG
365,"If you go by strict interpretation of the RAW, you get one Swift action per turn, period. Using 5th edition parlance, it's a ""bonus action"". You can take any number of free actions in a turn (within reason), but the Swift action is ""not as time-consuming as a standard, but a little more involved than a free.""

Practically (although I'm sure this opens itself up to a plethora of rules-lawyered abuses by players who are always looking for new ways to game the system for personal power), I maintain an order of priority, and you can always trade down. That priority, from least to greatest, is Free, Swift, Move, Standard. ""Full Attack"" is off on one side of the Standard, since it functionally takes up a full standard and all but a five-foot step of your movement.

Using this, it means you could trade down in my rules. You can give up your Standard to either take another Move or Swift. You could give up your Move to take a second Swift. But at no point could you give up your Swift to take another Move, or give up your Move to take another Standard (though this brings into the equation, for me, my personal frustrations with the alteration of *Haste* from 3.0 to 3.5; I personally was fine with that spell letting a caster use another spell in a round; it never made sense to me that a martial character increases in efficiency so they can get more than one attack a round at higher levels, but casters seemingly never learn more efficient methods of casting their spells without costly feats or use of much more valuable high-level spell slots; that, however, is another discussion).

So you have to decide if you want to go with a strict RAW (Rules As Written) interpretation (in which case, one Swift action, no exceptions), or a looser method that lets you be more fluid with action economy.",2015-09-16 20:52:22+00:00,cv3xlea,1.0,t3_3l1ecm,114050.0,Pathfinder_RPG

That said, I'm assuming you're all adults. Don't make your departure a big scene.

I get wanting to be rebellious, etc., but I always assume (and try to play as though) the players are interested in being HEROES. The villager who might have learned which end of the sword doesn't hurt him (or her) obviously put in the effort for the specialized training of a Fighter for a reason. The elf who left their people (who are traditionally insular and borderline xenophobic) did so for a reason. The character who put in the intense discipline and training to learn how to even cast something so ""simple"" as a *Magic Missile* or even more basic cantrips obviously felt they were somehow above the common herd (who might be inclined to drink and fuck their way through life for lack of better options).

2. Put a hard limit on the time a player has to do something. So he doesn't feel singled out, tell everyone at the table that to keep things moving (not unreasonable in Pathfinder, where rounds can sometimes bog down if all your players don't have strong system mastery), you're going to start a clock when their turn comes up. Set it at something like 30 seconds. They have that time to take and complete their action. If it's just straight damage and they're having a rough time adding up their damage (again, not uncommon at higher levels), give them a few extra seconds. If they have a smartphone, talk to them at the end of the session and ask them to download any of the plethora of dice-rolling apps and set up custom macros for their commonly-used rolls. If not, have them write up a quick reference card on a 3x5 for themselves, which lays out the total of their bonuses in conditions like critical hits, conditional damage bonuses, etc. It helps a lot. And if this player winds up screwing over the party repeatedly, well, adventurers aren't always known to be a patient lot when split-second decisions mean life or death against ancient horrors, and even a Paladin can reach the end of their rope sometimes... ;)
