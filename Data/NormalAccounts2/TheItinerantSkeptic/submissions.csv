1) When installing 2 &amp; 3, does it ask you to put both discs in to complete installation for the 360 emulation, or does it just wait til you're at a point in the game that needs the other disc?

It's always fun to talk about and see what others are doing, and as I prepare to run Curse of Strahd in the next month or so, I've decided what I'll be implementing. What house rules do YOU use, and what are your rationale(s) behind them?

1. Critical damage is rolled the way it was in the playtest. You maximize your damage die, then roll one more of the same type, and add your bonuses. I hate the idea that a critical hit could still, in theory, do less damage than a well-rolled normal hit, but just doubling everything seems excessive with the otherwise generally lower numbers in 5th Edition.

2. You are not limited to one spell per round when using Bonus Actions. If one spell says it's a Bonus Action to cast, you still have your normal action to take, and you can use that to cast a spell that requires 1 Action. I refuse to kow-tow to the progressive nerfing of magic that's been happening since the move from 3.0 to 3.5 (I'm still smarting over what they did to *Haste* in 3.5).

3. Roll your hit points. If you get less than half of what you could have gotten, you get the halfway point. So if your hit die is a d10 and you roll a 3, you get 5 hit points that level (plus any Constitution bonus, of course).

4. You get a 10-count to state your action when your turn comes up. I start counting audibly from 5 down to 0. If you haven't taken your action by then, you lose your turn. I have a 6-person group (plus me as the DM), and anything more just bogs the whole session down. I'm debating if I want to just set up a visible timer when someone's turn in initiative comes up. It stops when you start telling me what action you're taking.

5. I use critical fumbles. If you roll a natural 1 on your attack, you drop your weapon/your bowstring breaks/your crossbow jams/you fumble your spell components. You can take a Bonus Action to recover that round if you haven't already used it, or you use next round's Bonus Action to recover.

How game-breaking would it be to give a Cleric the Sorcerer spell progression table, and just open up the Cleric spell list to them, so that they can choose, as appropriate to their caster level, the spell they need in the moment, and have a certain number of spells of that level each day that they could cast?

So last night, our party is in an underground city. We find a doorway that my Druid brazenly walks through. Prior to this, there were four cloaks hanging by the doorway: a peacock, a wolf, an eagle and one other animal I don't remember. My Druid puts on the wolf cloak before dashing through the doorway. She immediately starts falling, which isn't an issue: she wildshapes into an eagle, except she has the head of a wolf thanks to the cloak. The rest of the party is in similar straits, but we all manage to land safely on the ground 40 feet below.

We start wandering a desert with an eerie green light in the sky, and are eventually attacked by some savage humanoids. We manage to kill all but one, who jabbers at us in an unknown language. Off in the distance we see what looks like a city with a gigantic amorphous thing about the size of, say, the city of Seattle (GM's description) above it, reaching down with tentacles and picking things up to devour them.

We convince the one remaining humanoid to tell us where we can find some treasure, because our GM has been telling us we aren't being proactive enough with looting things. The hapless humanoid, who I'd been busy batting into consciousness while in my dire tiger form, jabbers at us in mortal terror, but a wand of *Comprehend Languages* is used, and he's able to tell us about an abandoned city full of treasure, inside a temple of some ancient snake god. We have him lead us to the temple's exact location, then proceeded to knock him out so he couldn't go get reinforcements while we were inside.

We discovered the temple he'd led us to was made 100% of gold. Knowing that we ""weren't looting enough"", I proceeded to wildshape into a fire elemental, and we melted the entire temple down. We shaped the melted gold into a gigantic wheeled cart (because reasons), which I proceeded to pull along as a stegosaurus.

We eventually got out of that area, and headed off to the city with the Seattle-sized god thing hoovering up stuff on the ground and, it turns out, turning the people it was devouring into puddles. Some comical battles later, we noticed that there were pillars all around the amphitheater beneath this thing, and we read those to discover that we needed to put it to sleep to keep it from entering the real world (turns out the doorway had sent us into a dream world). So we made our way back to the floating doorway in the desert (days passing with all of this, so plenty of wildshaping opportunities for me), reduced the gigantic cart of gold so we could move it about, got back to our world. Made our way to the surface, and hoofed it back to a city that was beset by a once-every-several-hundred-years storm that kept people from leaving (which we were trying to solve, and it turns out is related to the Seattle-sized god thing in the dream world).

We discover in our absence an army of ghouls had devastated the city, so we proceeded to devastate them. We started out up a tree where I would throw out some lightning from a *Call Lightning* spell, and our Zen Archer would waste things with his bow. Some kind of ghoul lords came along, created an acid pit beneath our tree, which dropped us into acid about 50 feet below the ground's edge. One round of damage ensued, which I largely ignored due to the Acid Resist 10 I had from my [Planar Wild Shape](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/planar-wild-shape) feat.

Next round, getting out of the pit after having shaped into an eagle and flying 80 feet in the sky, I prepared my piece de resistance. When my turn came up again, hovering 30 feet over the ghoul lords, I wildshaped into a stegosaurus and dropped on them, as a ""dino bomb"". I took some falling damage, which the GM ruled my DR 5/evil didn't reduce (wasn't worth arguing over, and he'd otherwise been generous with us, so I was fine with it). Proceeded to finish the rest of the battle as a stegosaurus while the Zen Archer and our Magus helped mop stuff up.

Wonderful chaos. Terrified a humanoid, **LITERALLY** looted an entire temple, dino-bombed some ghoul lords, and in general made cosmic nuisances of ourselves. :D",Pathfinder_RPG,The Insanity of Last Night's Session,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/433s1u/the_insanity_of_last_nights_session/

1. A massive new Core Rulebook, likely digital in format to account for how much info it has. I'd like to see it be a completely (and efficiently!) searchable PDF or other platform-agnostic document. It would include classes most everyone considers ""core"" now anyway, such as the Gunslinger, Summoner, Magus, etc.

2. Inclusion of psionics as a rule system built in from the ground up, instead of ""tacked on"". This helps alleviate a major concern many have over the system (a concern not terribly well-founded in light of Dreamscarred Press' Ultimate Psionics book, but one that lingers regardless), which is ""It's too powerful"" or ""It's too much work to incorporate"" or ""It's just another flavor of magic when I can just take existing spells and add my own fluff to them"". The only time psionics has been included from the ground-up was the ""optional"" rules inclusion in 1st Edition, which was a completely unplayable game mechanic.

3. Reorganization of commonly misunderstood rules elements so they're quicker/easier to find, and don't cause so much confusion. Rules on shapechanging/polymorphing, Attacks of Opportunity, and niggly bits of action economy. I personally favor removing the relative redundancy between a swift action and a free action by just removing the ""free action"" from being a defined part of the action economy. I don't think you need to have an action type for talking or drawing your weapon while you're moving (if your BAB is at least +1, of course). While admirable that there are people who have spent the time to do research in the Source Reference Document and others to fully codify what you do and don't get when you're changing your shape, having a unified set of rules that are easier to find so people don't have to wonder, ""Do I actually get this?"" seems sensible.

Initially I wanted to do a Pathfinder Ravenloft campaign. Found a great ""official"" Pathfinder Conversion, but after starting to read it, realized it was much more geared towards starting the campaign in the Demiplane of Dread, and wouldn't work so well for bringing in PCs from outside of Ravenloft.

Then I started thinking about doing a Planescape conversion. I loved Planescape, and was sad that its only real continuation past 2nd Edition was putting Sigil in the 4th Edition Dungeon Master's Guide 2.

Then I started thinking about how much I love Lovecraftian stuff (and if you have heard ""Dreams in the Witch House: a Lovecraftian Rock Opera"", you're seriously missing out; I found it at a booth at GenCon in 2014, and listen to it at least twice a week without fail), and it all finally started gelling.

This is very broad stuff, so recommendations on specifics are most welcome, or just commentary on the overall idea, and even if you'd personally want to play in a campaign like this.

My thought is this: PCs are in a small rural village area, and discover that there are some children that are going missing. As they start to investigate, they learn that there's a small cult involved in the area that's been kidnapping the children. They eventually find the cult's sacrifice location, and at the conclusion of the battle, discover on the body of the high priest some odd symbology that they've never seen before (nothing much would be revealed from a Knowledge: Religion check other than ""it's something ancient, hidden, and very much buried; people don't talk about it"").

They learn that this cult was just an outpost of a larger organization, which can be found headquartered in a larger town a few days' travel away. After dealing with that, they find out a bit more about the symbology, enough to lead them into a city where a knowledgeable occultist can tell them a bit more, just enough to learn the ""cult"" is active in the city itself, something to do with a prophecy heralding the birth of a child who's meant to bring back some dark force.

After dealing with this in the city, likely having to slay the woman about to give birth to this child, they learn from the body of the priest overseeing the interrupted birth that ""This is just the beginning. You can't stop this... you can't stop his coming."" The priest will utter a name (it might be Cthulhu, or something similar, haven't decided yet), and this name is going to lead them on cross-planar adventures, starting with a journey to Sigil, the City of Doors. There, with all the knowledge of the multiverse theoretically available, the PCs will learn that efforts to revive this dead god are a massive, multiplanar affair. This journey will lead them to progressively more difficult encounters across the planes, opposing Abyssal lords, rulers of Hell, and eventually into a ""Far Realm""-type plane where they'll finally have to stop this ancient Elder God itself in a climactic battle of planar armies, the forces of good and neutrality, and even sensible forces of evil in a tenuous alliance to stop the arrival of a thing which even they realize should not be.

It got me to thinking about other campaign settings I've loved, and I realized the one I always loved the most, which sadly never got reintroduced, was Planescape (aside from Sigil showing up in the Dungeon Master's Guide 2 for 4th Edition; that was pretty much the only reason I bought that book...).

20,2016-01-13 22:44:09+00:00,self.Pathfinder_RPG,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/40ulbi/some_considerations_keeping_pathfinder_fun/,False,"Just some thoughts rolling around in my head on some perspective and keeping Pathfinder (and RPGs in general) fun.

1. Don't worry about character imperfections. Your character, if they survive, will become a practical god before 20th level as it is. Your melee type will walk up and swing their weapon(s) multiple times at dragons and the servants of gods (or even gods themselves if your GM got Bestiary 4 and wants to throw Cthulhu at you...). A low save value or sub-par hit points or a low Armor Class provides depth. We all love stories of people who snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, but you can't tell those stories if you're almost never defeated.

2. It isn't all about the numbers. Sure, you can dip into multiple classes and prestige classes with archetypes, racial traits, subraces, uncommon player races, and customized feat trees and skill combinations. But WHO is your character? How many Wizards really take the time to learn the bare minimum of being a Fighter or Rogue before continuing with their arcane studies? It isn't to say you shouldn't multiclass, but really analyze what you're hoping to accomplish if your sole reason for doing so is to game Pathfinder's math.

3. Remember that Pathfinder is a ROLE PLAYING game. I love seeing big damage numbers, getting awesome magic items, and overcoming powerful foes too... but who is my Soulknife? Why is she so focused on martial skills that she learned to manifest blades from the power of her will alone? What was her life like? Why does she have the personality traits she has? DOES she have a personality? Can I have fun in the game when I'm not casting a spell/swinging a weapon/making an Acrobatics check? Can I have a fun game if I PRETEND TO BE ANOTHER PERSON, and not merely interact with numbers?

4. There are other people in the game. If you work together you can accomplish a lot. If they're also role playing their characters, you're going to find diverse personalities gelling into something amazing. Sure, you might not get along; a Paladin may stick his nose up at the Rogue who happily swipes things as she goes through life, but that Paladin will be grateful for the Rogue's sneaking when the orc they didn't see behind them suddenly drops from a dagger erupting from its chest. In the most popular fantasy fiction, disparate personalities become fast friends from LEARNING to work in spite of their differences. Merry &amp; Pippin were roustabouts... who became representatives of Rohan. Sturm Brightblade disagreed with everything about Raistlin Majere... but would have given his life for him. Drizzt Do'Urden's entire storyline is about someone overcoming racial stereotypes and proving his inherent worth and goodness, and gathering stout and staunch friends in the process.

5. There are other players in the game. Make some new friends. Be respectful of them. Joke. Find things to do every once in awhile that doesn't involve rolling dice or eating Cheetos. Give them a chance to enjoy the game too, and find ways to help them do so.

6. The GM isn't your enemy (and if they're behaving as though they are, talk with them about it, and if it doesn't change, leave the game). Don't make them your enemy by making their job more difficult, and don't treat them as though they're trying to kill you. Sometimes the dice turn against you, and you roll up a new character. Trust me: the dice will turn against the GM too, and their carefully-planned boss encounter at the denouement of the story can go awry and they have to haplessly watch their villain die several rounds before they wanted because the players hit a lucky rolling streak or just came up with a creative solution the GM didn't anticipate when creating the encounter (or campaign).

1. GMs who have a ""Me vs. the Players"" mentality.
2. Players who insist on being so mysterious that they refuse to reveal anything about their character, and spend most of the session passing notes to the GM or referencing out-of-game conversations they had relating to their character's motivations.
3. Players obviously disinterested in working with the material the GM has prepared, and doing everything they can to go off the rails.
4. Players who think Chaotic Neutral means ""Disrupt as much as possible at every opportunity.""
5. Players who won't roll their dice openly or swipe up their dice so quickly no one else can see what they actually rolled.
6. ""Lawful Stupid""
7. GMs who don't provide proper time or resources for identifying or creating magic items.
8. Of course... rules lawyers.

Players will be my roommate, his buddy and buddy's two kids (15 and 13), and a mutual buddy of ours.

I LOVE creating story for a campaign. I can slog through creating stat blocks for encounters as necessary. The two things where I bog down the most, and where I start to feel like I just don't want to run the game anymore, are in map design (for encounters; broader world maps are fun) and in treasure assignment to keep players approximately where the level-equivalencies in the Core Rulebook say they should be.

What are some tips people have for making sure there's enough material prepared for players to account for the most likely paths they'll take in a given session without having so much prepared that I'll have to do massive reworks once they inevitably go off rails?

Are there recommendations for creating encounter maps that aren't so onerous? Programs that print out usable encounter maps that you recommend?

Terrific session software (preferably for Windows or iOS to be used on my tablet) for tracking initiative, and enemy/PC status effects?
