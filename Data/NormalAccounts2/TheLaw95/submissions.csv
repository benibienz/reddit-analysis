So apparently on this most recent update, there's a new glitch that won't let you enter boss rooms, as the game continuously gets you stuck on a loading screen, causing you to have to restart the whole game. I wouldn't have an issue with this normally until they fix it, but I'm trying to grind a new character through the main world quests to get easy Skill Points from it. Because of this glitch though, I have 3 boss fight quests almost finished, but can't finish them because I can't enter the boss room... This has happened to me at Daggerfall Castle, the Wyrd Tree, and Camlorn Keep. Is anyone else getting this issue?
