0,IMO you should only upgrade your CPU and GPU as X79 is still a great platform. Used 4930K should go for about $300. Match that with a GTX 1070 and you should be all set. ,2016-11-15 15:48:03+00:00,da1cuhz,1.0,t3_5d2cqb,10217.0,buildmeapc

5,Link? I've read a ton about Westmere-EP CPU's and never heard of this before. I guess that could be the reason my X5650 dropped one memory channel recently. ,2016-09-08 17:48:53+00:00,d7eh70t,4.0,t1_d7do1mp,56539.0,buildapc
6,"I'm not sure if you can find that or similar deal anywhere right now, that's why I said if you're not in a hurry. 

Oh wait, B&amp;H has G7 w/ kit lens at $697, but that includes $150 gift card. And the 45-150mm Panasonic lens is $197, so total for that package would be $744. Of course you could just use that $150 for accessories for that camera.
