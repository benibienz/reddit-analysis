The QB position if you get that sorted can ride you out for 10+ years. 

If you want to let Kirk go you're running the risk of a decade+ of hell. DIdn't you guys just experience that not too long ago?

Though after using Facebook/twitter I've found MLB fans are remarkably hostile toward stats. I've gotten accused of being a nerd and that I should actually watch the game if I want to talk about a players value. I got into an argument defending Trout over Betts. I wasn't using anything more crazy than using OPS+ to prove that Trout was undoubtedly a better player offensively than Mookie. The top comments were all anti-trout and seemed to imply there was some conspiracy that he got the award when he had less HR's, RBI. Pretty sad.

As I get older and the responsibilities get bigger I decided to really cut it down. Usually at least 2 games a week and maybe more/less depending on the series of interest. I substitute missed games with those condensed versions that are 18 minutes long or so and usually watch them during breakfast during the morning.

115,"&gt;nothing (save the fact that they were both rookies here) about their situations are even on the same planet in terms of similarity

I laid out the similarities. No one bothered to read. 

Let me keep it simple. 

1. Dobson got a lot of playing time in his rookie season. I believe this was an advantage for any rookie receiver. Get a lot of snaps. Get a lot of valuable experience. 

2. After his (Dobson) rookie season he started to deal with injuries and struggled to play and fell behind in the depth chart due to the logjam of good talent in front of him. This was his story after his rookie season. 

3. What's the connection to Mitchell? The comparison here isn't about their rookie seasons. Though I did make the point that Dobson was *ahead* of where Mitchell was comparing their rookie years. Through no fault of Mitchell's, of course he is behind. This is a fact.  This is about Dobson after his rookie year, and Mitchell in his rookie year. What has Mitchell dealt with so far? An early injury that led him to miss some valuable experience in the preseason. He is buried in the depth chart and not getting a lot of snaps or receptions.

4. *This is the formula that eventually led to Dobson fading away.* Despite Dobson getting that valuable playing time and having numbers close to/at where you want rookie receivers to be during his first year, the logjam in front of and the injuries eventually ruined him. 

5. My point was that Mitchell is already dealing with the issues Dobson has and heck, hasn't even had the valuable experience Dobson was privy to in his rookie season. Like I said before, it reminds to be seen if he can overcome the slow start and break through in the depth chart. I'm saying I'm not left with feeling much of anything with Mitchell. I just hope he gets the snaps to prove himself in the future but the similarities (yes there are similarities) with Dobson's situation doesn't leave me feeling confident. 

Neither does our history in failed receivers (later of which was again, Dobson).

118,"&gt;No he didn't. The wrs we had that year were edelman, Thompkins, Dobson, Austin Collie, and Amendola. He was 3rd on the chart. there was no log jam his rookie year and I don't know what youre talking about with it

&gt;And even if there was a log jam, he got play time because no one could stay healthy that year

Your reading comprehension is remarkably bad. All I can say. I'm not gonna repeat myself a third time. 

&gt;You realize that players across the league are often sat their rookie year to develop from the bench, right? Brady was basically inactive his entire rookie year. So he can definitely develop without game time.

I like how we're apparently now comparing QBs and WRs. 

&gt;And your reasons are just factually wrong.

&gt;Dobson isn't on the team anymore because he quit on routes, was frequently injured, and wouldn't fight for the ball when it's thrown to him.

Quit on routes? Fiction. 

Injuries? Which I've stated was a major reason he's not on the team anymore *multiple* times. But then again, you're having a very hard time understanding what you're reading. Not to mention Mitchell already had a major arm injury that made him miss some of the preseason. 

Wouldn't fight for the ball? Again, fiction. I'd ask you to find examples to support your claim but this discussion has been a waste of time so far. ",2016-11-03 18:04:56+00:00,d9kac0g,7.0,t1_d9k9t4t,602.0,Patriots
119,"You people just don't get it.

Are you trying to say Dobson never struggled to climb out of the depth chart after his rookie season? Yes their rookie seasons were different circumstances. No shit. But Dobson's next 2 years were similar to what Mitchell is dealing with right now. Injuries, too many people ahead of him and eventually forgotten were the story of Dobson after his rookie season.

What's a better situation for a rookie? Getting to start and get some valuable experience or be buried in the depth chart? 

&gt;What I've seen from Mitchell so far in his limited play has given me higher hopes than anything we saw from Dobson in his rookie season.

You're saying this after acknowledging the performances Dobson had in his rookie season against the Steelers for example? Mitchell has not had an opportunity to show anything similar. How on earth can you say you have more hope in a guy like Mitchell who hasn't had an opportunity to *show* he can have a number 1 receiver day with 100+ yards and 2 TDs?

Saying Mitchell will be better than Dobson is not an opinion in reality. All I *can* say is that it's too early to say if he'll be successful or unsuccessful. Wait and see. 

I believe his situation right now is less than ideal for a rookie receiver. I do believe that. ",2016-11-03 17:51:56+00:00,d9k9nht,5.0,t1_d9k9458,621.0,Patriots

Why do you think a lack of playing time is gonna help him develop? Do you think this is a positive for him? We again, saw this with Dobson for most of his time here. 

&gt;Saying he's going the way of dobson is just...well...wrong

No it isn't for the reasons I've stated. Mitchell has already lost playing time with an arm injury. He's already buried in the depth chart. Things Dobson struggled with for most of his time here.

&gt;Is it possible that the Patriots may need to devalue ""team-first"" attitude when it comes to drafting WRs and CBs?

I don't think that's necessary. There's many WRs who are high character guys like AJ, Julio, Fitz, etc. but also guys who are a bit more fiery like Dez but still very passionate about the team. 

This isn't about character but rather development/scouting. And I don't think there's an end in sight really. It'll probably be a problem we see continue. The last homegrown receivers we've had are Edelman and Branch and they have 1 1000 yard season between them, and 0 probowls (let alone an all pro). 

I think FA is probably their only option. Moss, Welker, Amendola, Lafell, and now Hogan have certainly contributed after getting most of their early development elsewhere. ",2016-11-03 16:45:37+00:00,d9k65en,1.0,t3_5axqdl,819.0,Patriots

This is false. There's never been an indication he couldn't run a full route tree. In fact, according to scouts and people who've actually watched tape (you haven't), they're very impressed with his route running abilities.

You don't get 80+ rec, 1600+ yards being stupid and a bad route runner.

319,"I think that's very disingenuous to claim most just want sex. Maybe some do. But I think the majority just want female companionship. A life partner. Someone who'll love us and be cute, smiley towards us or whatever qaulities a girl has. A lot of us may have dodged (barely) the temptation to commit zina or even hold a girls hand. It's tough to hold out in a society where premarital relationships are common place. And for those handsome brothers out there, their temptations might be even higher where they might have girls approaching them (luckily I haven't really attracted anyone :p). 

Sexual frustration is real though and if it is ONE of the reasons for a brother to get married why look down on them? The prophet has advised early marriages, and the virtues of marriage are taught to us from a young age. Sex is always on the mind when marriage comes up but I don't think it's usually the MAIN reason as I've said in the first paragraph. The idea of sex being good and something you can do with your wife as a halal outlet as well as getting BLESSING for it is very appealing.

379,"&gt;Seeing as scandal is prevelant in Baseball in Chicago 1919. Are the Cubs throwing the world series. Now- now am I crazy? No, I am just a Cubs fan who does not appreciate the effort of our boys today. For example they could not hit in the odd games and in game 2 it looked like the Indians pitching was so bad that the Cubs were trying to leave as many RISP as possible. I Will not be silenced. Lol they are starting Jason Heyward today haha.They are the favorites and look like they are putting no effort into hitting as shown by yesterday. There is a rumor that Rizzo has mob ties and is looking for that big settlement after this series. I am just saying, the world will not expect a scandal in Chicago and it is the perfect crime. Once the Cubs lose all 3 at Wrigley which they will because they are throwing the series, you all will be suspicious. IT IS A SHAME A REAL SHAME THAT US AS CUBS FANS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS TEAM THROWING THE WORLD SERIES. These players should be BANNED FOR LIFE.

He's won an MVP, a first team all pro, has won division titles, has had playoff success etc. and looking at his peers in his age group..who can say the same?

You have no reason not to marry him. He's a muslim, a kind man, and would make a good husband. Remember...

&gt;""And one of His signs is that He has created for you, spouses from amongst yourselves so that you might take comfort in them and He has placed between you, love and mercy. In this there is surely evidence (of the truth) for the people who carefully think."" (Surah 30, Verse 21)

Allah is the one who puts love between spouses. I think there's a very high chance you will, if like you said, he checks all the boxes. I think you've gotten bad advice here. 

Have you considered the possibility that these doubts are from the Shaytaan? He hates marriage so don't talk yourself out of a good thing.

828,"The hope for having children who grow up into righteous individuals is certainly common. It was a hope starting with Adam and Eve themselves:

&gt;“It is He Who has created you from a single person (Adam), and (then) He has created from him his wife Eve, in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of living with her. When he had sexual relations with her, she became pregnant and she carried it about lightly. Then when it became heavy, they both invoked their Lord (saying), “If You give us a child, good in every aspect, we shall indeed be among the grateful.”  (Quran 7:189)

Righteous children are a blessing from Allah and instead of asking for Allah to provide, you expect people to assume that their future children will probably go to hell? 

&gt;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.” (Quran 3:38)

&gt;“Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the pious.” (Quran 25: 74) 

These prayers in the Quran and certain dua and traditions shared by the prophet are there to aid us in asking for children. Instead of assuming the worst in a child's future, muslims are encouraged to hope and pray for the best (like in many other aspects in life) which was a tradition starting from Adam and Eve, and shown in other stories like Ibrahim's that are shared in the Quran and Sunnah.

847,"&gt;Brady has at least ten years left so we shouldn't even be considering a backup plan for him at this point. Let's be honest our next Qb is still in middle school at this point.

Did you actually just say this? Or are you being sarcastic?

&gt; believe Brady will be our Qb for at least the rest of this year and next year but after that coaches will have to decide whether they think Garappolo is worth extending as a franchise qb or if they feel better about a couple more years of Brady and moving into Brissett or some other young Qb we might pick up. I would love for Brady to play forever and I think he takes enough care of himself to play longer than convention but I don't think it is a savvy team move to extend him until he sucks.

I'm a football(NFL)/baseball fan as well. But the main draw with football is that it's the easiest to consume. Great for college students, people with actual careers etc. cause there's 16 games a year and every game is a big game. The storylines are deeper cause every game has a week of discussion, debate and news stories produced in the lead up. You also feel more connected with the league cause you can watch more games. It's also easier to remember iconic games cause again, you're not riffling through multiple years/decades of 162 game seasons and series.

960,"I think Keyleth is a close second in terms of lack of development. Its a step forward and two steps back with her. She's pretty much exactly the same as she was in the first episode. Vex would be third though its a little better. Vex really likes flying, money, Trinket, her brother and hates her dad. It's really simplistic at the end of the day and the change outside of Laura trying to make her nicer to ""fix"" her alignment is the only noticeable change since the broom theft. 

Percy had an amazing arc of his own. Grog was pretty impressive leading up to Kevdak. And Vax has been getting good development throughout the series. ",2016-09-05 12:42:06+00:00,d7a6tfj,1.0,t3_518txr,7730.0,criticalrole

DT for example would have long been buried after early injuries in their career. He was very raw but I have to give credit to Peyton; he's very good at developing young receivers.

1075,"&gt; Because of this I don't think it's all that hyperbolic to say that Develin alone is the reason we had games in 2013 and 2014 where we just relentlessly shoved the run down the other team's throat. 

We can't agree with this. I think that's a very clear exaggeration. The run game in 2014 was mediocre with a healthier roster. 2013 was a great year for the run game (though boosted by a couple bad weather games towards the end of the season) and yes Develin was available that year. 2012 we also had a great run game with Develin a non factor so there's really no way I'd say he was ever a sole reason for those games we had in 2013 considering we had better run game the year before without him. 

It's impossible to say one player is ever the sole reason for anything in a football game let alone a FB with limited snaps (around 20% for the entire season).

1124,"&gt;nope I'm quite content with deciding to not wear a hijab.

Confirmed. Unfortunate that you fit the picture I painted. I hope you have a better view of our *non-perfect* sisters in Islam who decided to wear hijab and the rest of the muslim community as a whole. Moments of rudeness are not solely associated with hijabis or muslims so stop pretending it's gotten so bad you want to marry a christian man. 

&gt;I cannot stand arrogant people and hijabis who show arrogance are the worse. My reasoning is that hijabis care enough about islam but wear a hijabs (they are more than cultural muslims) but not decent enough to be kind?

Just infuriating to read and so wrong. I hope you change your mindset someday. ",2016-08-26 07:22:43+00:00,d6x8eml,3.0,t1_d6x86bq,694.0,islam

1127,"Oh yes, you might be one of *those* people. You know, one of those girls who doesn't wear hijab and feels automatically insecure when they see other Muslims. I see your kind a lot on Facebook when the topic of hijabi's comes up. If there's a post about hijabis you get the usual stuff about how they know hijabis that aren't as good Muslims as some of their friends who don't wear hijab (they also reveal they don't wear hijab either in their profile pictures haha) and about how character is more important in determining religiosity or whatever. They feel so insecure in their choice to not wear hijab they instead decide to hate on anything muslim. Look at you harping on about MSA's and talking about how you'd like to leave the Muslim community since everybody sucks. Go right ahead.

There's a warped view claiming that since the hijab is the ultimate show of religiosity (or something), hijabis can't make mistakes and if they do make mistakes, they're open to criticism and ridicule. The way you talked about this auntie was disturbing and all to familiar to the tone I was talking about previously that I see online. Let's assume the worst out of the women cause how dare a hijabi not be perfect. And of course you followed up with the usual non hijabi example. 

What frustrates non hijabis the most is the fact that they falsely convinced themselves of having to be perfect before they wear hijab or something which is mirrored in your post. But they see hijabis who ultimately decided to follow one of the most explicit commands of Allah in donning the hijab while being what we naturally are...flawed humans.

The year after Brady's 50 TD/8INT season, Cassel produced less than half the total of TD passes, more INTS, and won less games on the easiest schedule. 

&gt;Cam and Eli have terrible moments, can't offer any consistency and benefited from great defences.

1209,"I'll have to give this a more thorough read tomorrow but I think in general that resigning both is the priority rather than rating them individually. Losing one means you're losing a dynamic player that you developed yourself and thats throwing talent away.

Though giving this a quick skim I have a couple problems with it already. First of all, I'm not qualified to talk about football technique at all. And looking at a few of your examples in which you criticize Hightower/Collins, from my layman viewpoint it looks like they did what they were supposed to do and did it well. But again, I know nothing about what constitutes good technique for a LB (and you do i assume?) so what can I really say? 

For example, you shared this [gif](https://gfycat.com/SoftDopeyAsianwaterbuffalo) and said it showed Collins has trouble finishing the tackle? Looks like a good tackle to me. I feel like I have to take your word for it even though I'm not sure I'm getting the feeling you're qualified to make final judgements like this;

&gt;Hightower is much, much better in run D, but Collins is much, much better in zone coverage. They’re pretty close in pass rush

What are you talking about? Many people thought a former DPOY and first team all pro would revitalize his career here, a la Randy Moss.

If not DPOY/1st team calibre, maybe pro bowl level was the expectation. 

&gt;He was at the end. I expected about as much from him as I did Reggie Wayne. I wouldn't call Reggie Wayne a ""bad signing"" though. It would have been nice, but he had nothing left and we didn't give up anything consequential by paying him for a month.

How in the world is anyone supposed to interpret what you said in any other way? 

I gave an appropriate response to what I thought was a simple false statement with some good examples to prove why the Patriots don't ignore individual stats, records etc. If not applicable to you, I think it's applicable to many Pats fan who perpetuate the idea that the Patriots are above record chasing like other teams which is obviously completely false. 

&gt;BUT, my original point was that neither Brady nor Belichick, will ever complain or dwell on the fact that Brady potentially had a chance to set some serious single season records this year

Of course they wouldn't and I never would disagree with this.

1376,"Bill recognizes accomplishments. He put Gronk in a late week 17 game in 2011 so he could gain the single season yardage record for a TE. This was with 1:30 to go in a week 17 game before the playoffs and they were winning by 20+ points. I mean Jimmy was actually also playing in a an adjacent week 17 game and they were tracking his stats (both TEs were chasing the yardage record).  Jimmy finished with 1310 and Gronk got 1327 purely on that last toss from Hoyer to gain the record. 

He gave Brady the game ball for 50,000 yards. 

There's many recent examples of Bill paying attention to stats and records for his players and even chasing those records with them. What other reason did he try to go 16-0? There were the Colts who could have also went 16-0 a couple years later but benched/limited Manning the last 2 weeks before the playoffs.  Bill didn't even consider it.

Brady is one of the best in putting his receivers out of harms way. But even he has his moments cause it's football at the end of the day and throws in the middle of the field are inevitable.

There is no ""divine/final role"" (ie. like the avatar) that I or any human being plays that would give our lives intrinsic meaning and purpose even less so, one that could be considered as final.
This was and still is a painful thought to hold, most of our lives are spent distracting ourselves from the fact that our lives lack any meaning or purpose even less so one that could be considered grand or final, that looking at the bigger picture, that we are insignificant.

1504,"Oh of course! Le Guin's novels I reread many times during highschool but haven't gotten back to them since. The Left Hand of Darkness was my favourite of hers (after EarthSea). Loved her short stories as well. Much of her genius comes out through those short stories of hers.

About the DT project, you probably won't be surprised (considering my persona on here I guess) that I couldn't really care less about how it turns out. I'm expecting it to be bad and it probably will be but if it turns out good, cool. Either way, hopefully it gives the series even more publicity. I've already heard excuses getting thrown out about how Ka is a wheel, and it's another cycle through the dark tower, etc. so I guess it gives them an excuse to fuck around with perfectly good source material as many adaptions do (smh). Oh well. 

I definitely here you with the one offs. After a highschool I've been reading quite a few classics I couldn't be bothered to read when I had more free time and was ripping through series. Time is more constrained and picking up a big series is kind of a commitment.  I'd rather read a book now and just not feel the need/pressure of picking up the next in the series. 

You've probably read these but the  Mistborn series should be cool. I have many more but give me a minute to check my goodreads!

&gt;It wasn't how he would awkwardly hit on the female cast members.

You're in the habit of making up lies aren't you? There's Scanlan making ""chub"" comments multiple times in character, Tibs does it once or hits on Keyleth while drunk and that means Orion is hitting on taken cast members...smh.  

&gt;Or how he would piss everyone off introducing himself over and over.

It was a character trait. Guess you should get pissed about how often Scanlan hit on Pike, or how often Grog mentioned Ale, or how often Vax went in headfirst, or Vex obsessing over Trinket lmao. 

&gt;It was when he used metagame knowledge to tell Keyleth how Vax felt about her despite not actually knowing in character while drunk, in a dickish attempt to sidetrack their character development

Guess that's out the window now considering this crap you replied with. Lol at you actually trying to deny how the fans responded then and as time passed as something I made up. 

&gt;The cast was nothing but polite 

A lie. Most of the time they were, but at times they weren't. Orion was also rude at times. 

&gt;was miserable to fans (going so far as to ""kick"" someone from the community)

A lie. Outside of one incident with a single fan, you can't claim he wasn't gracious to the vast majority of fans he interacted with. Many examples on stream during gift opening where he was very thankful and addressed every gift giver personally on camera in a heartfelt manner. But no, let's pretend a single incident defines his entire interaction with the community...lol. 

I have no interest in posting clips but in the previous episode there's Marisha and the rest ganging up on him for ""mutilating"" a sleeping old lady who was clearly an opponent. Not to mention people like Liam and Travis egging him on too during the incident that no one mentioned. For some reason Orion is the only one who got criticism for it for simply dealing the killing blow. 

We all know there's many examples in episode 27 with much of the cast being unfairly harsh while he was doing his tasks. With others also taking time on tasks and people like Travis getting hours of one on one fighting in previous episodes that people had to sit through, it seems very hypocritical.

&gt;fudging dice rolls.

Lmao this is my first time going through critical role, and watching the episode in fact...and guess what? I've never seen Orion fudging dice roles at all but I've seen Laura do it twice in the first 30 mins of gameplay in this episode! People just see what they want to see, and everything Orion did was nitpicked and overblown.

1595,"Ahh yes. There was a couple reasons. First of all, it's insanely hard to pressure Manning consistently. He has great pocket presence and gets the ball out of his hands extremely quickly. Not to mention, the Broncos Oline played very well in 2013 if I recall correctly.

And if you think about it, who on our Dline was a threat in any sort of capacity back then? There was Jones, who was bullied around in that game, and Nink who doesn't have the size or the length at times to get consistent pressure. Not to mention, both of these guys played over 95% of the snaps that year (?), and considering the high altitude at Mile High they just got gassed really quickly. 

Another factor on top of that was that Denver dominated TOP. They had a couple of back breaking TD drives that must have lasted more than 6 minutes. 

I think the Offence at the end of that day is what frustrated me the most. It was so predictable really and was pretty much what happened this year. You had people circle jerking about Blount the week before hand and he was a non factor. No run game to speak of (should have used Ridley), having to throw deep to All Pro receivers like Collie/Slater etc. They really just didn't have enough man power to compete that day.

1614,"&gt;The thing is that Brock wasn't allowed to actually change plays like Peyton. He was given a double call for a run play and a pass play, but he was never allowed to change routes at the line of scrimmage or make any pre-snap changes like Peyton. Kubiak simply wouldn't let him do it.

&gt;Mike Nolan was on ESPN a while back talking about this. He was on the Chargers staff last season. He said that since Brock wasn't allowed to change plays, they never installed any disguises into their blitzes during prep for that week because Brock didn't have the freedom to adjust to them anyway. 

&gt;Once Peyton came in he started changing shit at the line, but since they never actually installed any disguises for that week he just picked them apart with audibles. That's why Denver won and why Osweiler was benched, because Kubiak never let Brock do what he was trained to do by Adam Gase - actually *direct* the offense. No wonder he wanted to go to Houston.

I find the Muslim community online (in terms of commenters) are always incredibly quick to judge. There's just this insatiable need for people to criticize other Muslims online. Maybe a reminder is important and in fact warranted in certain cases but the tone in which these comments are given (in an arrogant ""better muslim than you"" fashion) just really annoy me. Can you really call that advice? 

For example if you've heard of the Sid and Dina channel ([check em out](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYSAUy5YhE)), they have a similar issue. They swear quite a bit. And yes it's a uncomfortable sometimes, especially if you like them and want them to change. They're cutely reminding each other to recite the dua for leaving the house, or before eating etc. but are swearing during the car ride or meal! Other than that, they're hilarious and quirky and fun to watch a lot of the time. If I'm uncomfortable with the swearing,  it doesn't mean I can act like I'm a better muslim than them.

He was a good kid back then but got in with the wrong people and I lost track of him in highschool as I got caught up with AP classes, and volunteering and all this other stuff. He looked beat up. Black eye, broken nose etc. (I found out later that he had been jumped). He asked for a ride to grab some ""medicine"" from a Rexall that was quite out of the way for me, especially cause I was about to go out that night (it was about 8:30 pm). Just felt a lot of pity for the lonely figure who used to play with the rest of us kids in the neighbourhood park. Got in the car and everything,  I started asking for directions for the address but I quickly realized the dude was fucked up. He was nodding off, slurring his words etc. But anyways, it was too late and we were on our way to a residential area that was nowhere near any Rexall I knew of so I was very uneasy. He then got on a phone with someone with the classic ""You got the stuff?"" and shit like that. Felt like I was in a movie or some shit. He suddenly asked to stop at his parents house to grab a charger for his phone since it thankfully died after his phone call. I kinda used this opportunity to tell him, ""hey I actually don't have time for this. Maybe ask your parents to give you a ride"" (surprised he even had contact with his family tbh but it turns out he just attempted to coerce his younger siblings to let him in). He suddenly had a very intense angry look on his face and made a move to grab his backpack which was thankfully in the back seat. In his state he fortunately couldn't reach around enough to grab it. He instead told me very firmly to wait here. I was like ""okay. No problem dude."" He went off and I took that opportunity to throw his phone and shit out the window and speed off. I got home and realized I had fucking taken his back pack with me. I opened it up and the dude had knives and pepper spray or whatever inside. Plus a bunch of money. Could have been pretty bad for me. Called the police and they managed to get him before he came after me thank god. ",2016-07-08 18:02:05+00:00,d54jqt6,1.0,t3_4rvj5m,5391.0,Patriots

Huge payroll after a while if you're successful but I don't even use it outside of extending my own players that turned out really good. I don't find it fun or rewarding getting some random good player in FA, especially because they aren't real players and I know nothing about them outside the fact that they're really good.

This is the first time I've really tried to micromanage the farm. My pitchers have consistently flamed out though and it's been the main reason I haven't won as much as I could. I've been on this save for 100+ years now and won 3 times. I've certainly had a lot of winning seasons but it all fell apart in the playoffs as my 10th-15th ranked rotation eventually got blown up. I'm actually quite interested to see how often I lost to a particular team, the Astros. I felt that I've lost at least 15+ playoff series to this team.

There's franchises like the Browns who haven't had a legit starting QB for more than a decade. That's literal hell. 

The Colts have the luxury of having a young guy who's shown he can play in this league and they smartly locked him up. There's no other option. If some idiot NFL fans had their way the Panthers, Seahawks, Bengals, etc. would not have franchise QBs right now. Look at Dalton. He took that 5th year step that a lot of good QBs eventually reach and he's left all the idiots saying he was a terrible QB not worth anything with their mouths hanging open.

1857,"I say this everytime the subject comes up. ""LotR"" (the Film) is good as a film. As an adaptation it falls grossly short.
Of course they aren't 100% true to the book. No movie ever is.
Of course there is no arguing this point. There are changes Jackson made that did make it a better film, especially for people who hadn't read the book. The exclusion of Tom Bombadil for example I think was a good change.
However there are many changes that make no sense and some that are entirely unnecessary. Why change Aragorn's character, or Frodo's, or many others? What is with the change to make the Dead attack at Minas Tirith? Why have Sauron a giant eyeball? Why bring Elves to Helm's Deep? How the hell does the Witch-King outmatch Gandalf?
I could go on and these are just plot and character changes. This isn't even to get into the theme changes or absences. The story itself is only similar on the most basic level.
Even with all this said, I still think Jackson made good films out of LotR, again, they just are not good adaptations.
Now for ""The Hobbit"", I think it is both a awful film and adaptation. It is all action, to the point where I was bored of it, and the plot changes from canon make zero sense. How does Gandalf have the map and key if he hadn't been to Dol Guldur? How was the Witch-King dead and resurrected?
You say to take them for what they are ""a interpretation of the Tolkien world through the eyes of modern cinema"" and I think this is a lare part of the problem. Much of modern cinema seems to think because you have the budget to make every seen and action scene, you should.
I have no problem with people who like the films, I don't even have a problem with people who like them better than the books (though I think they are crazy). What does bothers me, and the only source of tension for me, is when people assume Jackson did the great job without fully understanding Tolkien's work and what it meant to him and many of us. To see these stories, that many of us group up with and read and re-read all our lives turned into mere action movies and a shell of what they really are is almost painful. And saying ""Get over it, of course it really isn't 100% accurate. You book fans are just too picky"" really doesn't due that justice.
Also Whenever someone tries to use the movies as canon for an discussion. That really grinds my gears.

The HP movies weren't anything to write home about either. One of their biggest crimes was totally ruining Ron as a character. The movies after 1, and 2 just totally fell off the rails. ",2016-06-19 20:49:09+00:00,d4fr8k2,3.0,t1_d4fq63a,1664.0,TheDarkTower

When you take the meat out of the details of the story you get a barebones product that's hard to follow. I have countless friends who could hardly follow the HP movies...how will people understand the weirdness that goes on in the books that's even hard to understand in writing? At least books can tell you what's going on. The movie medium
is pretty limited to just showing you what's going on. I'm not sure how they'll pull it off.

But like LOTR, HP, and all these other adaptions...they will ultimately fail at what they claim to be; adaptions. Stuff will be cut, ridiculous things added in on the whim of the makers etc. Perfect adaptions are impossible. At the end of the day, the only sure thing it will accomplish is increase the amount of new fans of the source material. The source material will always be there with all of it's depth and detail. That's enough for me. I don't really care if it's good or bad. I will watch anyways and since I'm going in with very low expectations, I will probably leave it satisfied.

1968,"&gt;even the term ""franchise quarterback"" is loose.

He's been in a Ravens uniform for how long now? There's nothing loose at all about his status as a franchise QB.

&gt;The winning success of a team involves passing, running, blocking, special teams and the ENTIRE defense. I refuse to give win totals as a QB stat.

That's extreme. Win totals are QB stats in conjunction with passing stats. Why skimp on giving the entire picture of a QB. QBs have a say in if the team loses or they don't y'know.  Whether it be throwing three picks or leading a game winning drive. And by your previous statement we can't even use QB stats either anyways. How can you call wins a team stat and not just plain passing yards, TDs etc. No QB catches his own passes or blocks for himself. 

&gt;I think his stats would not be as good as Matt Ryan's in that situation

I think they'd be pretty similar. Considering Ryan with all those weapons averages like 5 more TD passes and 500 more yards per year than Flacco does.  I think Julio, Rod, and Gonz for a couple years would have bridged the gap a bit. ",2016-06-13 18:42:27+00:00,d47nduo,6.0,t1_d47mnbx,888.0,nfl

Furthermore, both provided an alternative explanation for his motivation -- extreme homophobia. Lastly, the FBI said this guy was under surveillance for 5 years.

These are terrible examples. Gaff literally did about exactly the same as he did on his previous team. Martin has hardly done anything noteworthy in a Patriots uniform. We need more games and starts before we can claim he has ""massively"" improved. 

&gt;They clearly are better than avg. Most WRs don't break 1000 yards which branch didnt but avg WRs aren't peaking where he did. Also David Givens was a pretty good WR until his career ending injury.

Career length wise sure, they stuck around longer than average. I'm not sure where at any point in each of their respective seasons they were considered much higher than pretty good. 1 1000 yard season between them, 0 pro bowls, 0 all pros.

2118,"First of all I only play fictional. Second of all, I don't trade, and I don't sign FA (outside of relievers). I purely use the farm. 

I use payroll for extending my own players that turned out really good.  I tend to have to rebuild about every 5 years. It's gotten to the point though where I have 100+ million available for FA every year and I never touch it. I don't find it fun or rewarding getting some random good player in FA.  Playing with real players is boring as fuck to me. I've seen people just use huge payrolls to sign random guys in FA every year to make superteams and I don't see the fun of it.

This is the first time I've really tried to micromanage the farm. My pitchers have consistently flamed out though and it's been the main reason I haven't won as much as I could. I've been on this save for 100+ years now and won 3 times. I've certainly had a lot of winning seasons but it all fell apart in the playoffs as my 10th-15th ranked rotation eventually got blown up. I'm actually quite interested to see how often I lost to a particular team, the Astros. I felt that I've lost at least 15+ playoff series to this team. I'm interested in going back and looking at all the playoff losses.  Should be fun seeing how often I choked. 

It's a fun way to play though and there's certainly 2-3 year droughts as you restock talent after old talent goes off to FA or retires. ",2016-06-08 14:31:34+00:00,d40wbum,1.0,t3_4mqjn5,219467.0,OOTP

LOK 1 gets a bad rap I've seen but I think it's much better than Season 4 of LOK (which I rated second worst of both series after LOK 2). I'd say LOK 1 was at least a middling season with ATLA 1. Very good and enjoyable for me. I even liked the romance outside of the fact she kept going after Mako. You really had to be here live experiencing this season though. First of all, there has to be people here from when LOK was just a rumour? Seeing the whispers of a new season, whispers of a female Avatar, the character design leaks, the confirmation, the wait etc. It was really rewarding following the show from the very beginning. Amon made us go *crazy* in season 1 when it finally came out. He sparked so much intrigue and he was such a cool sinister character with great voice acting and design. *Everyone* was on the edge of their seats every week trying to figure who Amon was along with how his powers worked. Week after week we had great discussion. It was truly incredible and no season came close to the level of fan theories, discussion and fun that we were churning out all season. Can anyone chime in here? I feel like binge watching LOK 1 as a first time just isn't the same experience,

2255,"I think bandwagoning is the most common way to get into any sports team. The difference is that a lot of these people just do not bother to educate themselves on who plays on the team, the history, the history of the entire league in general, how to interpret stats etc. In other words, they have zero interest of actually committing into being a *fan* of the team and the league in general. They just want to be known and seen as part of the winning, most successful ""tribe"". They won't last long and never intended to in the first place. I like the European term ""glory hunters"" that highlights the psychology behind it. Really goes down to the base desire of being on the ""winning"" tribe. I guess that's why fairwheathers and bandwagons are the majority. It was not advantageous to be perpetually loyal to a weak tribe so I guess true fans may have something wrong with them. 

Then there's those who may be bandwagons but stick to the memories of winning as the team declines and hope to see the team get back on top. Educate themselves in the process and the loyalty is there to stay.

Every fanbase doesn't have them. Only those who are currently winning.",2016-06-01 23:22:12+00:00,d3sekuj,1.0,t3_4m4343,1522.0,baseball

2535,"&gt;You have nothing of value to add yet you still keep on talking

Uh huh. Let's see some stuff you've provided. 

&gt;Decker can get shut down sometimes, where Jules always shows up

&gt;Edelman is more consistent, Decker racks yards against scrubs and gets shut down

&gt;Numbers are wrong.

&gt;Everyone acts like stats are words from god. They're not. Stats are for losers, final scores are for winners.

These are a couple of your ""points"" that you've provided. I've added much more to the discussion then you have. I've had better exchanges like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/4kbcz4/julian_edelman_voted_1_no_2_wr/d3e2xgw) one where it wasn't full of exaggerations or nonsense. 

You seem pretty delusional in terms of the quality of debate you're churning it out. It's misplaced. You can't stand the fact that the numbers don't support your debate so you ignore them or say they're wrong. Numbers don't lie, Edelman's injury history and drops don't lie either. The best you've come up with was Y/G but that was debated by /u/kksred and you completely ignored it. 

&gt;Eh. The difference is almost negligible.
Edelman averaged 69 yards a game in 2014.
Decker averaged 64 yards a game in 2014.
Now you might that the 5 yards does at least make it clear that Edelman was better in 2014. But the Patriots threw the ball about 110 times more.
&gt;Yards per target wise (its a good indicator of efficiency) Decker has Edelman beat by a reasonably wide margin in 2014 (8.37 to 7.35).
Normalizing for pass attempts, Decker averages nearly 78 yards a game to Edelmans 69 in 2014.
&gt;If we do the same for 2015, Y/T is (7.78 to 7.86) in Edelman's favor. and normalized Y/G is 71 to yards/game 76 yards/game in Edelman's favor.
&gt;And Fitzpatrick was a bad QB last season in spite of his stats with some horribly inaccurate throws so Decker is doing this on hard mode.
&gt;I mean last time Decker had a QB of Brady's caliber throwing it to him he was putting up godly stats that were beyond anything Edelman has done.
&gt;I also take issue with you writing off Edelman's injuries as bad luck. He gets injured a lot and at some point youve got to attribute that to his play style.

But then again you said the numbers are wrong and didn't matter so I guess you're constant in that regard.

2536,"&gt;He can fill in for a number 1 if needed, Decker, not so much. Make a team with Decker as your number 1 WR and see where that gets you

Pretty sure we did where he had 900+ yard, 70+ receptions and 5 TDs from a  combo of Fitz and Geno not to mention being slightly hobbled all year.

Even ignoring Edelman's early years and purely focusing on his last three years he doesn't beat Decker's career average yards or TDs. Decker has been better for longer and more consistent.

Thank you for the comment. Like I said before, I'm comfortable in agreeing with this because it's the truth. To this team probably more valuable but for 31 other teams, Decker is the clear choice. If you want someone who'll get in the Endzone, get more yards, and generally produce like a number 1 or 2 year in year out you pick Decker.

He also played what? 10 less games? That doesn't sound consistent to me. It's also likely those numbers go down. Decker has also had more total production over his entire career, is more reliable and if I had to bet money on who is more like to have a 1000 yard season next season I'd pick Decker. Not to mention he's been catching balls from Fitz/Geno the past 2 seasons. And his first year at NYJ, he was the true number 1 target.

You're citing a single SB run and you use the word continuously? Ever heard of sample size? Welker had a great playoff run in 2007 and another solid one in 2011 and a great one in 2012 in terms of raw numbers. One drop changed the narrative for idiotic fans.

Bad luck? Face it, he's injury prone. All his foot injuries (4 or so) have been on one foot and 4 or so of his arm injuries have occurred on one arm. It's not bad luck and it's probably safe to say he'll get banged up next year too. He's a ticking time bomb. 

You can talk about Y/G if you want but Decker has played more games and has been available for his team more often than Edelman has. Easy to have a higher Y/G when you missed more games.

2591,"One game? I'm not sure what you're talking about. Manning has the 3rd most SB appearances of all time, and the 3rd most playoff starts of any position bar Rice and Brady. The sample size is huge and more than any QB could ever hope to have. He has 2 GWD/4QCs in the playoffs in total. He simply didn't perform in the clutch more often than not. He had an opportunity against the Saints and choked, he played mediocre against the Bears, he got destroyed by the Seahawks and did nothing against the Panthers. 

Brady has done it in every single SB win, and in the first Giants loss leading huge drives. The only game in which I think he didn't perform to his standards was in Giants 2 when he couldn't manage any points in the 4th. 

Sure, can't say for sure but no one would say Manning would be a QB you'd pick in the playoffs if you need a huge championship drive.",2016-05-20 21:01:13+00:00,d3deqxs,7.0,t1_d3d78w5,10629.0,Patriots

2627,"&gt;In the end, Michele gave Cydney the chance to stay in this game, but is that truly deserving of a jury vote?

In the end, it doesn't matter if it was more deserving in your opinion. Cyd, as the juror had every right to vote for Michele. If it was based on Michele's loyalty, or maybe she hated Aubry's guts. Who cares? Either way, it was her choice and she certainly had valid reasons for voting for Michele either way. 

&gt;First of all, since when was ""loyalty"" at all a strong aspect of Cydney's game? I forgot that flipping on your original brawn alliance and working with Aubry to create a Female alliance was the definition of ""loyal."" Okay whatever. Putting that aside, considering that their games were overwhelmingly similar, Cydney is also admitting that she would have voted for Michele over herself at FTC if given the option. Seems like a clouded bitter decision to me. I'm sure this post seems bitter in itself, but this was not something I could look past given the outcome. Is Michele a deserving winner? Sure, she got the most votes and in the end that is the end goal of Survivor. Was the jury vote more based on bitterness rather than objective game analysis? Absolutely, that is what this season was, whether you agree with it or not.

Again, if she was bitter or not, it doesn't matter. She had every right to vote either way. And both options deserve no ridicule. Whether you agree with her decision or not. The jury vote can be objective but it can also be *emotional* and the jury is well within their rights to be emotional. It's a social game too.

I don't think this is a good concluding sentence (specifically the best ""12"" part) but good overall.

2798,"He said something along the lines of ""his heart is almost gone! Take it."" going into the 4th of XLIX. Honestly even as a Brady homer, I thought a 10 point 4th quarter deficit facing the number 1 D in the league may have been too much. He proceeds to lead 2 TD drives, 14/15 150+ yards and 2 TD passes against the number 1 D in the league. He not only brought them back he gave them the *lead*. He didn't settle for FGs and put us up by a TD score. Despite this the D almost fucked it up. I can't imagine the pain if we were up by like 2 points and the D put them in FG position just like that. He gave us a 4 point cushion that ended up being the difference. This is among the greatest 4th quarter performances by a QB ever. I'm sure Sherman respected Brady to an extent before but I think he respects him *completely* now. in other words he'll never doubt what makes Brady, Brady. His heart. 

I laugh when people say Manning would have won ring(s) if he was on the Pats. Manning has never thrown a 4th quarter TD pass in his 4 appearances. Each SB win came down to the last minute and Brady leading a crucial drive in the 4th. Manning would *never* been able to do that in that stage of the game. You need guys like Brady, Montana etc. who have that it factor to get the team the win by any means possible. ",2016-05-14 15:43:42+00:00,d35bmrg,2.0,t1_d357g4i,8889.0,Patriots

Also the Saints game, the D gave the ball back to the O 2 times within the last 2 mins or something. It was insane to watch. Talib was incredible in general the entire month and a bit. Game winning break up in the Falcons game, couple ints I think in a frustrating Jets game, shutting down Graham who was their number 1 target etc. 

It was a strange year and one I'd never forget.

At least there's another person who remembers this season the way I do.

Gronk died again and it was back to Brady's usual score line that year of 1-2 TD/1int for 250 or so yards. We ended up losing to the Dolphins in a critical late season game which was the difference maker between first seed and home at Gillette vs away at Mile high similar to this year. It was an up and down year for the most part for Brady which was made to look better than it was when his stats took a boost for the short while Gronk came back. The struggles carried on to 2014 where everyone had a scare that the decline was actually real. We just needed Gronk at full health.

You can apply this to someone during a cancer scare, one experiencing extreme turbulence on an Airplane etc. In desperate times with nothing else to turn to, even those who are hardly religious (cultural christians for example) will turn to God. 

&gt;He it is Who makes you travel by land and sea; until when you are in the ships, and they sail on with them in a pleasant breeze, and they rejoice, a violent wind overtakes them and the billows surge in on them from all sides, and they become certain that they are encompassed about, they pray to Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience: ""If Thou dost deliver us from this, we will most certainly be of the grateful ones.""

&gt;But when He delivers them, lo! they are unjustly rebellious in the earth. O men! your rebellion is against your own souls-- provision (only) of this world's life-- then to Us shall be your return, so We will inform you of what you did.

I'm not perfect cause I have certainly experienced this before. It's a real reaction.

3029,"&gt;At the time, Fox radio personality Colin Cowherd defended Mendoza after seeing comments online that she's ""terrible"" at play-by-play.

&gt;""It's a brutal experience (calling baseball games) so I will defend Jessica Mendoza because I've done baseball games and sometimes you just start making stuff up,"" Cowherd said. ""And you baseball fans eat your announcers alive; you're brutal on announcers. You're brutal on (Tim) McCarver you're brutal on (Joe) Buck, you're brutal on everybody except your local homer.""

I agree. A lot of announcers are shit on in general. There's so much criticism for all announcers for every sport, although I personally couldn't care less. I just like the background noise and there's usually some interesting stat or tidbit(s) every announcer shares during broadcasts that enhance the experience for me. I think people take the criticism too far though. Like Mendoza having her gender be a reason for critique just isn't fair and it makes me uncomfortable having to read some of the shit that's been thrown at her. But what can you do?

It has themes that are way too complicated for the average person to comprehend from watching a movie. The medium is limited in it's ability to *tell* what's going on, which is what I think is crucial for this story or really any adaption. For example, the HP movies being plain bad despite them being ""simpler"". The good thing is the first book is easily portrayed as just Roland follows Man In Black with some flash black throw in. I highly doubt they'll get the subtleties of Marten/Gabrielle/Roland (one of the most intriguing aspects of the entire series for me). If they fuck this movie up they have zero hope of doing right the rest of the way and I won't watch any sequels. 

I'll watch the movie but I have no expectations. If its bad, it's bad. If its good, which I highly doubt, we'll see what they do after that. We will always have the original.",2016-05-09 05:43:32+00:00,d2yau42,,t1_d2l255y,,vikingstv

3152,"I agree 100%. Ridley knew at that point that when he fumbled in that game he wasn't playing again. Why the fuck are you forcing players to play scared? It was just ridiculous to me. And if you noticed from the few runs he had in that game he was getting good yardage as he always had against the Denver Run D which not a lot of players ever manage to play well against. I'm convinced that if he played in the 2013 AFC Champ we would've ran the ball way more effectively. They tried to produce the same Blount performance against the Colts and Blount got like 5 yards. Which led the predictability we suffered similar to this year. Drop back pass, everyone covered, hit on Brady. 3 points going into the 4th if I recall correctly. I knew Ridley could have kept the run more respectable. 

I think the most annoying trend it had was its psyche effect it had on fans. Every RB that comes here will be scrutinized on fumbles. Ridley was a little below/above league fumble average his entire time here and he's labeled as  ""fumble prone"" which is false. If we have young talent in the form of AP for example they would have been ran out of town already. It's gotten to the point where people expect 0 fumbles now and that's just not sustainable. The only way that happens is if we don't run the ball at all. ",2016-05-05 20:36:08+00:00,d2ua4b0,6.0,t1_d2u5j9t,5994.0,Patriots

3175,"Which is why I said after more than one season. Though I want to make clear which teams don't/won't get hate after some success (like the cards) vs those who do. 

It's about sustained success and if a team has the potential for that they get a lot more hate. Cam is 26 (?), has an MVP, 1st team all pro etc. already. He's gonna be around for along time along with Luke and all the other core group of players you have. You're gonna be threat potentially for a very long time. Thus hate ensues. Seahawks obviously same situation so I won't spell it out; franchise QB and very good talent across the board. As soon as they realize you're not a flash in the pan...hate pours in. It's like if a team finally wins the division and makes a playoff run it's like, ""cinderella story over, go back to being bad now. Oh shit you're not bad? Let's shit on your fanbase and team incessantly"". 

How about the Cards? They have some good talent but I think the equalizer is if they're actually a threat to win anything with Palmer. The dude just does not perform in the playoffs. He's also 36 or whatever the heck and gets injured a lot. Do they even have a franchise QB potentially behind him? Nope and we all saw in the WC last year, without a QB it gets ugly. They'll be good for another year maybe but won't win a SB. SO who cares about the Cards knowing this? There's no incentive to hate them. ",2016-05-04 06:17:34+00:00,d2s4vnv,7.0,t1_d2s1d50,7511.0,nfl

&gt;The major league-wide pitcher batting line last season—.122/.153/.153—looks even worse when compared with non-pitcher rates. Despite flagging batting ratios all over the diamond, pitchers’ cumulative OBP was 48 percent as productive, and the slugging percentage 39 percent as loud, as position-player output in 2014. Those are all-time low comparisons, meaning that even as position-player batting rates have declined in recent years, pitchers have fallen further behind even the lowered baseline.

&gt;It's easier than you think. Unsubscribe from /r/asoiaf, twitter feeds that comment on the show (if you use twitter) ,etc. I haven't consumed GOT content since I stopped watching GOT halfway through season 2 (how long ago was that?).

It's not a good show from what little I experienced. 

&gt;I have zero temptation at this point to look at anything GOT related. Especially because I forgot so much of the series and literally read each book once during a month and half long summer after highschool. Once the new book comes in, it's a reread. I'm sure it'll be fulfilling. I'll feel like I'm experiencing it for the first time again. Simple in my experience. There's so much other content to consume.

I hope these could reduce well. 

Also these. I think the Gronk spike would be great. Not sure if the others can reduce down well. Maybe just use the head.

3459,"I think they're both very good options.

Personally, I'd love to see a Flacco vs Brady matchup in primetime again. They're both very good and you know points will be put up in the 4th. They're both big game players.

The Texans would be good, but I think the hype maybe a little lower since its early in the season. I think the main appeal might be seeing Brock, Hopkins, Miller etc. and if they mesh well. 

I think a late December game with perfect cold weather football and possible huge playoff implications might be a lot funner. And not to mention, there's the small chance Brady's suspension is put in place again. I think if this was possibly my only chance to see Brady, Bill etc. in person I wouldn't risk it.

It's really uncomfortable sometimes. I've watched 85 series or so so far which is quite a bit more than a lot of people. I've made efforts to stay away from the fanservice and the cringey comedy slice of life shit that gets churned out every year.

I thought a lot of the times they were laughing at him rather than with him at times. And while Sam has more lewd humour there isn't much of a reaction outside of genuine laughter. Maybe I'm talking out of my ass. 

And while he seems outgoing I felt a lot of the time he struggled to get a word in. When people like Laura have no trouble getting their voices heard I'd see Orion opening his mouth trying to interject but he always seemed ready to let the other players finish what they were saying. This is early on though haha. I haven't seen the metagaming outside of him trying to break down a door with a series of spells (if that's considered metagaming).

He didn't turnover the ball, didn't settle for FGs, and brought the team from down 10 to up by 4 points. The defence had to stop a TD drive and they almost fucked it up. Good thing Brady threw a TD to Edelman cause they easily would have gotten in FG range. 

I'm really confused how someone who watches football could think one play determines who's the MVP. 4 TDs to 4 different receivers, biggest 4th quarter comeback in the SB, sealed the fucking deal at the goal line drawing them offsides.

4054,"Again, why would anyone agree to being a back up QB for 6+ years no matter what team you play for? 4 years as a backup is probably pushing it. He's already losing out on valuable experience of actually playing in games. No matter how good you are, there is usually a 1-2 year buffer where you make big jumps actually playing for a full season. The older he gets, the more pressure there is to be throwing like 30-10, 4000+ right out of the gate. Starting in a ""couple years"" after completing a 4 year rookie contract isn't good enough.  He needs experience and wants to be a starter and he won't get that in NE unless Brady is out of the picture by then.

I disagree that he'd be getting back up jobs. Players like Fitz and whatnot are stop gaps. Franchise QBs could possibly play for 10+ years for your team. Why do you think Fitz who had a great year but didn't get a contract like Brock? You get contracts like that because of upside.

Maybe look at it from the perspective of a player not a fan. This is ridiculous to read.  

And yes you made good points about his lack of a resume, but when you think of the QB needy teams out there someone will jump on the chance of a young QB who's been groomed behind Tom Brady. Someone will cross their fingers that he's a franchise QB and will give him money to *start* for their team. Not as much as Brock who started some games, but a significant amount. More than the Pats would give unless, as I mentioned, Brady isn't a viable starter anymore. That's the only scenario where they'd put in money to keep him. 

Jimmy will want to start. He will be done being a backup after his rookie contract. He probably would jump at a chance to start as soon as he can. It's unfair to expect anything less from a highly regarded second round pick.

He doesn't perform in the playoffs more often than not when the team needs him the most. 

And sure, when you're facing the best teams in the league you may be down in the 4th, but great QBs work with it and get wins. Manning has hardly done that. If his team is down in the 4th in the playoffs, expect a loss.

They're not considered hits because they're very talented (which Easley is) but because they play key roles every year, for every game. They played many snaps, developed, and became team leaders. In the case of of McCourty, Collins, and Hightower they will be cornerstones of the defence for probably close to 10 years. That is what you hope to get out of your first round guys. Not injuries and excuses. 

I'm not saying he's a bad player but it means *nothing* if he can't play consistently and show it on the field. I would take the most average player around and if he's durable and always available I would take him every time over what Easley is right now.

4251,"Wilson is ahead of both in my opinion. Newton would be next but might match Russel if he's in contention for MVP again. 

The thing is Newton threw 35 TDs with one of the worst receiving corps in the league. He had former journey man punt returner Ginn as his number 2 last season (number 2 with Olsen 1, but he's a TE technically). If Benjamin comes back right where he left off, that TD number can increase. 

But you look at Wilson and the guy's efficiency stats are incredible. His PFR approximate value is quite a bit higher than the other 2 if i'm not mistaken. Last year his Passing TD numbers dipped but his rushing stats were astronomical. This year he proved with his below average receiving core and no Lynch that he's a legit passing QB despite all the naysayers. 

They're both very good. As for Luck, not sure what to make of him yet. He led the league in TDs 2 seasons ago but was injured this year. I think of the three, his coaching and front office are the absolute worst. Didn't they trade a 1st round pick for Trebt Richardson? But he has the best receiving core of the three but also suffers through the worst running game too. So who knows. 

Next season should answer some questions.

Won games, great stats etc. But looking at his overall career it's very clear that he does make mistakes and often. As we all saw this year (and expect in an average case of a QB career arc), he took the next step in his 5th season. Limiting TOs and being much more efficient in the Redzone. He just hasn't played like that consistently to think this is the norm. But he is trending to having a 10+ year career with the Bengals and will probably be the best franchise QB of their entire existence. May even throw in a championship or two, along with some individual awards. Definitely not a game manager.

Never would I say he's a similar QB to Smith who had a very different career arc. He I would agree, is a game manager. At this point in time that is. He wasn't always a good game manager. He wasn't always a good QB full stop. ",2016-03-22 04:23:54+00:00,d18s98f,1.0,t3_4bf6wo,13339.0,NFL_Draft

Manning racked up stats in the regular season but has never had a mystical playoff moment in the SB, in the 4th quarter where he put the team on his back. Quite the opposite. He's never thrown a 4th quarter SB TD pass. He's certainly had the opportunities considering he has made it to the SB more than any QB could hope to play in in their careers. Manning is a great regular season QB (Brady could be the best by the end of his contract), not a great playoff QB. He's not the GOAT. Simple.

The JJ Watt MVP race in 2014 was a complete farce and was the one due to media ""buzz"". In this day and age in what world is a DE more valuable than a QB? Rodgers throwing 38-5, 4000+ yards
and he's in contention with Watt? A sack gets you how many points? He sacks Rodgers twice in a game and plays great in general, Rodgers throws 6 TDs. He could have a great year and they go 2-14, or he could have a great year and they go 14-2. He's a DE that has little correlation to team wins. Can you imagine Brady, Rodgers etc. in their prime playing a whole season and the team going 2-14? It was sad the Texans didn't have an identity outside of this dude. Putting him in the Redzone and trying to run the ball with him wasting a down? That's pathetic. Sounds like the stupid idiots on a Facebook page saying he could play every position. Didn't know Texans coaches were as fucking dumb as them too and bought into that nonsense. 

Cam Newton deserved that MVP more than anyone. Look at his receiving core and he threw 35 TDs with that. He had 10 rushing TDs, 5th in the entire league. He had a very high 4th quarter passer rating. His second half of the season he had what? 25 TDs, 1 pick? That's insane. His team had the best record and he was a huge part. The fact that you said any QB could do well on that team is hilariously untrue. 

The true travesty is Carson Palmer getting second team all pro, with a great D, better receivers than the Panthers and possibly better than Brady too, and a great running game. With Brady producing more with less and the 30th ranked rushing game in the league and so many injuries...blatant disrespect in ignoring him in the MVP race and not giving him 2nd team all pro.

Bill has had a major problem in developing WR's. Only Edelman came out of that group that was developed in that cushion where Welker and Moss were the number 1 receivers. It was the perfect opportunity to find some value talent and develop them to replace Moss/Welker without the pressure of having to start. Good thing is they were able to bring up guys like Gronk and Hernandez who revolutionized the position and started using 2 TE sets which was genius. 

Bill has also finally made a good defence here from mostly homegrown talent. But it took years of failure after the nucleus Carrol/Parcells built in the 90s to make it worthwhile. 2011 was an absolute failure on that side of the ball as 2006 was for the receiving core. But the last few years they've found both good talent in the draft and FA to shore up the defence. It's not long before they look in the draft and FA to shore up offence a bit. 

This offence will look very different in 2 years. Hopefully Edelman/Amendola are gone by then and they have a new scheme or player to replace them (unless they can still play). ",2016-03-10 03:31:14+00:00,d0ua4pn,1.0,t3_49rpgz,783.0,Patriots

That's huge. It's a stretch if he stays healthy the whole duration. Some of Gonzalez's numbers are kinda untouchable unless he plays past 35 and still puts up 1K and 70+ rec. His receiving numbers, and receptions I don't think Rob could break. Gonz is number 2 in receptions to Rice, and number 5 in receiving yards all time. But he could definitely get past Gonz's 111 TD receptions, first team all pros, etc. in the next few years.

[Teen Titans](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QWaWvQuIVMI). Mobile link so hope it works. It's something I used to watch when *I* was the age (I'm not a parent but found this thread) described in the original post. I got excited when it was mentioned in this thread but realized it was the spin off Teen Titans *GO* you linked. *Teen Titans* was the original. I guess I was being unknowingly technical. 

I guess Teen Titans Go is more appropriate for young kids. It's pure comedy with little depth from the little I've seen. 

There's some scary figures in the original and some tough moments. [For example](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XSiGteEY-jk). It was deep, psychological, violent, mature etc. But it also had the classic kid morality, feel good, [life lesson moments](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4PGwtYIcyKQ)(here's one with Raven-my fav, and my boy Cyborg), that I miss the most from that show. Seeing the Titans gradually get to know each other, trust each other, and just become true friends over the course of the show was awesome. 

So yeah, hope that clears it up!

I'm not sure if you'd be interested in watching the original. You're probably super busy. But if you ever get the urge for more Titans, there's always this version. I feel Robin, and Raven in particular are given the short ends of the stick in Go, although they both have the most psychological baggage and crazy cool plot lines in the original. Cyborg with his issues of feeling *truly* human with being mostly robot for example are also very compelling.

A lot of Teen Titans fans are noticeably upset with the Go spinoff. Especially when we expected a continuation of the original but getting a chibi comedy instead. I'm noticeably biased and never gave Go much of a chance. Hopefully my bias wasn't off putting!",2016-03-05 06:01:40+00:00,d0oaa7y,7.0,t1_d0o8jr5,4361.0,Parenting

4865,"Oh forgot to add in Star Wars. I watched that on my own time as well. Watched a few Harry Potter movies that were absolutely terrible as well. I stopped at 4. 

I think Star Wars is a perfect example of what's wrong with the medium. If this was a book series, it would've been incredible. The movie doesn't (can't) tell you shit about the interesting aliens that you see in the movie. For example non human Jedi's are just shown but given zero background as to where they came from as well. In a book scene I could imagine an author at least giving a name and a short description on each new jedi and what they're like as the character surveys the room. It also frequently goes back to Tatooine or however it's spelled, instead of exploring different planets and systems. That's a huge waste of potential. The world building and character development were weak to say the least. ",2016-02-29 14:04:11+00:00,d0i0zy2,6.0,t1_d0htbpv,26025.0,baseball

I enjoy books, and TV shows much more. Just more opportunity for character development, setting development etc. that give you a richer experience. I mean if the Firefly movie was all that existed, no one would still give a shit. 

Movies feel like such a shallow experience in my opinion. I don't see how they could be anything but with their 2-something hour time frame. I remember seeing Avatar and just being like ""that's it?"". It was so hyped and I just didn't give a shit about anything that happened in that movie.

The last movie I went to was Gozilla 2014 and the only reason I did was because I had just finished Breaking Bad and wanted to see Cranston in his new appearance. Such a bland movie and I decided right then and there that it was the last time I'd go to the movies.

But the fact that people are *celebrating* this...it's really disturbing. I can watch this and wince, but I can accept that it might be a realistic reaction that long ago. But if there's people right now who could watch that scene and laugh/celebrate Aslaug (""because she's ""Asslog"", she deserves it and I hate her"") being treated like that...it's scary. 

It really just shows these things humanity is trying to escape, whether it be racism or spousal abuse, it's bubbling just beneath the surface. I see it time and time again. It comes out in seemingly unexpected reactions like this where guys point out that its long ago so it's not a big deal I'm happy about it. But are you against spousal abuse cause society currently thinks its wrong, or because you *believe* it's wrong. If you were put into that time period as you are now, with all the experience you've had in modern, times, would you beat your wife? I know there's gonna be some angry redditors in this thread who will get worked up about the truth here, but you really need to look at yourself if you're happy about any character being beaten by her spouse and justify it by time period.

5047,"All I see from your comment is some of the most common bs I see in this sub too often. Speak for yourself cause this just confirms you let the hivemind dictate your opinions. 

I hate the Packers, especially the Packers fanbase. I love watching Aaron Rodgers play cause I believe he's a fantastic player, but I can't name another player on that team I actually like. Also when people like Al who can nonchalantly say Rodgers is the GOAT while watching him put up like 70 yards passing....I can't say I don't enjoy watching them lose. 

Same for the Saints. I don't mind the fanbase too much in this case but I can't recall ever rooting for this team since the SB in 2009. I really just don't like the team. Reddit circle jerks like this ""gate bros"" nonsense is irrelevant to me.

And another thing I cringe at is this Patriots South nonsense. They have Obrien,  a terrible Hoyer, and who else? An old Wilfork? Who the fuck cares? The Texans I actually dislike. The fanbase and organization are just not very smart. Mostly because of this obsession with JJ Watt. The team has no identity outside of him. When these idiots are putting a DE in on offence it really seems like they're as dumb as the brain dead Texans fans I see online saying nonsense like he can play every position. The MVP push he had last season was ridiculous. In what world is Watt an MVP player compared to Rodgers, Brady etc.? I always laugh when they'd show clips of Rodgers getting sacked twice against Watt when they were  debating if he was the MVP or not. Rodgers threw 6 TDs on that shitty Texans team despite how well Watt played. He was irrelevant. He could get 20 sacks and that team could go 2-14. He could get 20 and they could go 14-2. I liked how desperately they put him in in offence in the playoff game. They're trying so hard to justify the 100 mill salary they gave to a DE and its sad. 

For me add the rest of the AFC East, all the good teams in the AFC the past 5 years (Broncos, Ravens, Steelers etc.). But those I consider rivals. The Broncos and Ravens have just been competitive teams. I really didn't like the Broncos with Manning but when he's gone they're back to current Colts level.  I hate the Steelers though, and their fanbase. Other random teams in the NFC I hate for personal reasons, like the Eagles, Falcons, Cardinals recently (I hate Palmer), Bears because I hate Cutler. I think that's about it. Other teams range from mild dislike to don't care to yeah I like some of these players and hope they do well.

In that case it's about giving a subset of the population a better chance at that care by insuring there's more diversity in medical schools.

Same thing on education. Maybe students would be able to trust their teachers and believe they can achieve success like their teachers that ""look like them"". Maybe someone that has the same background as they do so they can relate to each other on a higher level. There's so many immigrant students these days, and so many young First Nations children who don't have a role model that they can look up to.

Asians are often seen as intelligent, while Hispanics are regarded as unintelligent. All of these myths are seen as innate manifestations that are embedded in our subconscious belief systems. Many of these beliefs are perpetuated by a media which show these stereotypes in different forms over and over again (movies, cartoons, music videos, sitcoms, newspapers etc...). Stereotypes are also further reinforced by our school system in the curriculum that is covered and not covered (e.g. the invisibility of Native Americans). The socialization we receive while growing up in our families also contributes greatly to our beliefs in inferiority and superiority of certain individual groups.

Why couldn't they make an ending referencing ""his last rodeo statement"" and just base it around Peyton? His nickname is the fucking Sheriff. Similar message but personalize it to Peyton you know? Just lack of creativity in my opinion. Felt like they couldn't think of anything so they went ""they're both old, and will be HOFs in the future. Fuck it lets use it again. No one will notice"".

His D for all their injuries reduced the damage as best they could in the beginning but obviously Manning could do nothing with the football.

5420,"Brady was never carried...outside of 2001 when has Brady been outside the top 10 in yards, TDs etc. His first full year starting he led the league in TD passes. When he finally got weapons rivalling Manning's he threw 50 TDs after throwing 24 the year before. And all this crap about carrying...Brady never threw a 3-7 TD/Int ratio on a SB run. Thats fucking carrying. Brady has had great SB performances as well winning SB MVPs in games he supposedly got carried. Have you seen the top 50 SB performances list that NFL is putting up on their Youtube channel? Non surprisingly Manning is nowhere on that list (While Montana and Brady made it multiple times). You're telling me this guy is in the GOAT conversation with Brady/Montana when he's nowhere near that list and got carried to his only SB win?

And people who think a kicker won them the game...um you actually have to get into FG position to kick the FG. Especially against the Panthers when Vin fucked up multiple times.

But reading the Last Kingdom novels are what brought me into a show based on Vikings history. There seems to be an adaption that came out for said novels recently. Maybe I'll check it out. 

And yeah I agree. The GOT books are a lot better. I stopped watching midway through season 2. Partly because that's where the changes started to pop up and also because the actor faces were getting in the way of how I imagined the characters. 

The amount of character development, setting development and what not in a novel can never be matched by a TV show. Just how it is. Sadly I've tried to get my show watcher friends into the novels but they won't have it. I was even called angrily a ""nerd"". If they're content to call Dany ""dragon girl"" and ""Khaleesi"" it's their problem. It's hilarious how bad a TV show is in enforcing names of characters and settings.

5954,"Sure and that was due to half of our quick outs/reads in the offence in Dion and Edelman got hurt. Amendola also missed a few games. The Oline injuries really weren't conducive to having no running threat out of the backfield and no receiving options that could get zero separation. Thus Brady being hit way too often.

The D has stayed consistent which is good. And James White got some good experience (I really hope he makes some plays in the playoffs). Some players on offence just have to perform. Simple as that.

Sorry but saying this team sucks doesn't sound the least bit realistic or educated.

5957,"I think they have a chance, as every team does in the playoffs. Edelman getting back does help the Oline. It's all about release time and getting the ball out quickly. Gronk is getting the most of the attention being double and triple covered. As we've seen, players like Lafell really benefit from being the third/fourth option as he's getting zero separation. If Brady is able to get the ball out quickly to Dola, White, Lafell etc. as Edelman/Gronk get the most attention , the offence will be able to move the ball.

Calling Amendola injury prone when he's had less career injuries than Edelman is truly the ""lol"" moment. They're both injury prone, with Edelman probably the more of the two. 

What's also funny about 2012 was Bill clearly trying to phase out Welker in the beginning of the year by starting Edelman over him. Edelman clearly showing Welker&gt;&gt;&gt;Edelman, injuring Hernandez's ankle, and then predictably getting hurt. Welker obviously balled out, and stayed healthy as usual.

I just thought if they could somehow snatch a SB win here they'd win more later in Brady's career to solidify GOAT status. It was a gift. It was right there. At the end of the game, 3-2 in SBs, with Eli SB MVP again. I just felt they were in a hole and I wasn't sure they'd recover in a long time. 

Brady was the Golden kid. Going into his 4th SB, at 3-0. He was the second coming of Joe Montana. I'll always remember this but Steve Young (one of Brady's idols growing up) predicted pre game they'd win 50 to like 7. This was the game to solidify his career as GOAT at like age 28. He had another decade even to add to his career. We all know what happened but it took a decade long journey to get that 4th ring. Going 4-0 was too perfect to fit Brady's career. Brady's a 6th round grinder. It took losing 2 SBs, one and dones, ACL, a decade etc. but he finally got the 4th. Fits who he is a lot better I think!

6867,"The Pass was safe. That's what it was. Completely intentional. Welker had a small window where he was open, but had literally 3 guys around him in every direction (if memory serves correctly). Too long he may get clocked, ball may get tipped, intercepted etc. Too short, had a guy under. Lead him too far to the sideline and there'd be another guy right there. It gave Welker a chance to adjust, he hanged it up a bit to his back shoulder to give him time and turn.  Welker was too slow to adjust in my opinion.

I've always had the impression from your comments that you might take my opinions personally, and I guess I was right. You were polite enough, but I guess you've finally blown a fuse like a lot of people on this sub do. Glad to know you've joined the ranks of users I detest. 

As for why I go to this sub? I go here cause I'm a Patriots fan. I don't go to /r/NFL anymore (or as much) cause its karmawhore central and the Pats users who go there instead of here are the worst of the bunch. /r/patriots has gotten worse with its own influx of karmawhoring as well but not to the extent /r/NFL has with 400k plus subscribers.

7892,"No it isn't. He still had Welker, Hernandez, and Lloyd (a borderline 1000 yard receiver). I'd say what he has now without Gronk is closer to 2013. Look at the final regular season game against the Bills in 2014. Really nothing on offence without Gronk. 

Also another thing I implied was 2013 was a great season to see the actually difference in offensive production with and without Gronk. Yes in 2013 he had nothing. but with Gronk the offence was fantastic. That's crazy when you think about it. With Gronk, he threw 3 TDs against the Broncos, and 4 against the Steelers. Thats nearly 30% of his TD throws that year. Dobson had the best game of his career in the Steelers win. Without him, they really could not get it into the Endzone. He didn't throw a single TD in the 2013 playoff run. 

Look at 2014. Gronk was not fully himself in the first month which continued the idea that the Brady decline was an actual thing. The offence was still in 2013 mode.  ",2015-09-20 05:00:30+00:00,cv7n6gh,8.0,t1_cv7m126,2671.0,Patriots

7898,"Agree with everything you said. But I feel uneasy saying Tom Brady isn't the MVP of this team I guess. Brady game winning drives in the Divisional, Superbowl etc. is really what his legacy is. A 6th rounder who was never afraid of the situation and put the team on his back. 

I've said this many times but Gronk is the reason Brady stats are still top of the league. We only have to look at 2013 to see the difference between Brady without Gronk and Brady with Gronk. And him being healthy is the main reason they won the Super Bowl last year. That playoff run needed a lot of offensive production. I feel if Gronk get's injured this year, Superbowl chances are shot.

7914,"Hey kinda related to your post but I've always loved Book 1 (main reason: how dark of a season it was, the great character Amon, and the 1920s theme that was used consistently). But this is definitely unpopular in this sub. I also agree that Book 2 was the absolute worst season out of both series. 

So, what you have to look forward too. Book 3 is amazing. Best book out of any series which is quite a contrast with the book that just preceded it. But here is where I differ from a lot of people in this sub: Book 4 is much closer to book 2 in terms of quality than book 3 (which is what it's usually grouped with). People just shit on book 1 all the time but I personally think its better than book 4 for quite a few reasons.

Put themselves in a hole and obviously Brady had no chance throwing deep to riff raff like Slater. All week in the subreddit there was the assumption Blount would play great and I never bought it.

It was clear to me though that without Gronk, and 2 rookie receivers getting ample playing time, Brady wasn't going to have a great year statistically. In early 2014 there seemed to be a carryover. Gronk won't up to speed and again, there was fears of Brady permanently regressing. The first 4 weeks the offence was clearly the same it had been for stretches of 2013. But Gronk got back to normal and Lafell got more comfortable and he became Brady again. He went 10/4 in the playoffs as well. There is no reason to believe Jimmy will get to that point anytime soon.

I think the difference this year was Gronk this playoff run. A healthy Gronk is the deciding factor. He opens up the Redzone so well. Brady threw 10 TDs, the second most in a playoff run.

Add up the times and see how much time you're willing to devote to watching vids. 3 hours a day at 1.5 speed isn't too bad is it? Next day, do the practice problems for the sections you watched. There's a guy who does some of the videos who speaks at a perfect speaking pace to make 1.5 and 2x speed easy to understand. Then there's the girls with the shitty squeaky voices that talk way too fucking fast and made me want to rip my hair out.

https://soundcloud.com/bostonherald/robert-kraft-addresses-the-media-on-tom-brady-suspension?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter

Did he end up hurting the franchise anyway, since he said the league was untrustworthy? 

Like I said, he's never stated those issues or tried to be transparent. My issue is that he's tried to pass it off as ""The only reason I didn't appeal was because I hoped it would help Brady's situation"". But he's obviously in Goodell's and the other owners pocket.

9085,"2013 was a strange year. D was top 5 leading us to a 5-1 record to start the year while the offence simply was terrible without Gronk. Gronk comes back. Brady lights it up for a few games while the D regresses. Gronk goes down again, lose hold on AFC and end up having to go to Denver for the Championship. That game the offence simply wasn't good just like in the reg season. Even the divisional against the Colts. It was all Blount. I don't think Brady even threw a TD. I was really concerned at that point if Brady's last few years would be like this while Manning was breaking records, winning MVP's and going to Superbowls. Manning getting blown out made me happy though. Then in 2014 I thought it would be more of the same. The first 4 weeks were very concerning. But I knew that a Gronkless offence simply wasn't good and when he got back up to speed everything would be alright. Gronk is the most important player on this team after Brady. Simple as that. An injury to him and I highly doubt they win a Superbowl. ",2015-08-04 12:51:56+00:00,ctr0wjy,7.0,t1_ctqsrdt,27514.0,Patriots

9787,Good point. They're usually trying to discredit Brady in some way. But yeah what can you do? Vast majority of NFL fans in general are pure homers who refuse to look at anything objectively.

You probably have seen this from me in other threads similar to these but I really don't give a shit about off the field comments. Just how I feel personally about them.  Definitely a minority when compared to the majority of Pats fans who decide to get worked up about every minor slight that's brought up against this team. From players to simple announcers.

9807,I honestly don't really care. You're not MVP if you're not on the winning team. Whatever you do. It's like giving the reg season MVP to JJ Watt for sacking rookie QBs and missing the playoffs (I don't put the blame on him for the Texans missing the playoffs. It's a QB driven league so don't pretend a lone DE has the same impact as Rodgers/Brady etc.) . The team didn't accomplish its goal. ,2015-06-17 11:58:15+00:00,cs9gew0,4.0,t1_cs9g9dt,432.0,Patriots
