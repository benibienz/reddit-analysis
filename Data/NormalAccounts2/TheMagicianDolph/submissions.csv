[Summary of his years in NE](http://i.imgur.com/PWvLJZ7.png). 

I'm of the opinion that he *will* be back next year, and maybe even the year after. His career projection has been pretty similar to Julian Edelman. Julian's first 4 years were plagued with injuries. And his [total production those 4 years](http://i.imgur.com/5mgouG5.png) was very similar to [Dobson's production his 3 years here](http://i.imgur.com/MMP0Er1.png). Dobson has obviously produced a bit more on a per year basis but I think it's probably due to Julian being overshadowed by many other targets that were simply better than him, especially Welker who was in front. 

Julian tested FA during the offseason after 2012 and to put it simply he garnered hardly any interest. He came back in 2013 at the 1 year vet minimum and lit it up (and most importantly he showed that he can stay healthy through the rigours of an entire season...something he hasn't been able to replicate since). Despite his production he was clearly a pleasant surprise to the FO. Amendola the very same offseason was signed to a very big contract. He was projected and expected to be our number 1 receiver. He had a great debut but injuries got in the way and Edelman has since taken over that role. Fortunately Edelman got his extension the next year, and deservedly so. 

There's still a chance we see Dobson finally take the next step. I think the Julian situation and his eventual progression may lead the front office to be more patient. I believe they'll give him a bit more leniency and time to develop. 

But as we all know, those chances are probably starting to dry up.",Patriots,Dobson will make the team (I think),https://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/4nmg60/dobson_will_make_the_team_i_think/

Alecia for her unwavering toughness and upbeat attitude when everyone disliked her and disparaged her on her own tribe. Her making that fire was one of the highlights of the season for me.

Aubry for her perseverance, intelligence, her gameplay. And not to mention she was pretty tough in her own right. I'm very glad she went so far in the game when I thought she'd be an early boot after breaking down in the first episode.

Cyd for her spunk. She wasn't gonna take shit from anybody. She was a great strategist as well and knew when to make the right moves. She played great and I admired her reasons for playing the game. Inspirational.

Shit, Jennifer for staying in the game after that bug went in her ear. I was literally wincing as she screamed in pain. Props for staying in cause bugs are my worst nightmare...I have no clue if I'd stay in the game with a grub drilling through my ear canal.

Michele. Great winner and so deserving. She had her back against the wall towards the end but she never gave up. Played a great social game, won those tough challenges towards the end and had a solid final tribal. Very happy with the winner and reminds me of one of my other favs Fabio!

Since when do they use the exact same script in back to back years? I guess the NFL Films cuts are taking it's toll. Shittier narrators and content originality decreasing. 

We all know of this NFL Film clip of the Ravens vs. Pats divisional which featured [this beautiful clip](https://streamable.com/5teq). The final script of the XLIX highlights was a final beautiful wrap on Brady's greatest playoff run tying in with the previous clip. 

And then shoehorning the same quote into this years? It was just really strange. I guess it fits technically.

It just spoke to me and I tear up without fail whenever they get to this part: 

&gt;But I'm here today, and I'll always be cheering for you, right here. Cheering for you. My only self. 

Partly because I feel we can all relate. We were all kids once. Imagining where'd we'd be, who we'd be with, what we'd be doing etc. and all the innocence and hope that comes with being around that age. It was a sad feeling, but also a good one at the same time for me. It was quite jarring going from a kind of mellow and amusing episode to such a deep and sad scene all of a sudden. 

Props to the voice actor for just acting out that scene perfectly. I wonder if it would have had the same impact if I watched in sub like I usually do with shows?

My second favourite scene has to be the ending of Hard Luck Woman. Faye carving out where her bed used to be in the rubble, a scene all the more devastating considering the fact that it was years and years ago and so much time has passed. Ed leaving the crew was such a well made scene as well. I loved the part with Spike standing quietly looking at Ed's goodbye note. It must have hit at that moment from thinking kids a nuisance to realizing he'd miss the little bugger. I liked how the windmill Ed have him as a going away present was put at the front of the ship. A nice little touch. Also Jet and Spike scarfing down the extra hard boiled eggs. Ha as a viewer I could even feel how empty and quiet the ship was without Faye, Ein, and Ed at that moment. 



All in all, I'm glad I watched this. A part of me forever.

Amazing soundtrack, art, and just the atmosphere was awesome. I'll miss it.
