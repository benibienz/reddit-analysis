(Sorry for being poor) but, when I try and play diep.io the game loads, but it gets stuck on ""Connecting"". And I've waited for 2 hours and nothing happens. Why? Because I can play slither.io and agar.io just fine. But I've always wanted to try diep.io, but I can't.  Is it the internet, library, or what. And does this happen to any one else?

Any suggestions to try and fix it, please?",diepiothegame,What am I connecting to?,https://www.reddit.com/r/diepiothegame/comments/4oi8di/what_am_i_connecting_to/

But the issue can give some disadvantages.  If a player is laying flat on the crane, a player from below can see a leg or an arm and still shoot those parts dealing damage. If th√© player is not a quick reactor, two shots with the Remington 700 will kill them. This can be annoying while they are attacking someone else.

Not gonna lie here, I took advantage of this glitch many times, and can be useful to clear up the crane, but it's annoying if you're the victim. This doesn't only work from the bottom, but also in the sides when a player is crouched.

Just a glitch to be fixed by Stylis, if the choose to do so, if they don't, oh well. It ain't gonna be the end of the world. But just a quick suggestion.",PhantomForces,Shot From Below the Crane,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhantomForces/comments/4oi6y8/shot_from_below_the_crane/
