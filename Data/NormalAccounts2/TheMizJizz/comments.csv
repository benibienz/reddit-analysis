I have a white girlfriend and ALL of those white people have something offhandedly to say about me dating her. Sorry my life experiences, along with popular culture, societal trends, knowledge and basic common sense tell me otherwise. The majority of white people dint even know what racism is, they just think as long as I don't say the n-word I'm not racist. ",2015-06-23 23:56:33+00:00,csgi8bg,8,t1_csghs12,843,news

19,"No we don't. Every law that has been passed to help with race relations wasn't for black people, it was to let white people know that bigotry isn't acceptable...

28,"That's very unfortunate, but as a coordinator and hiring manager myself; my two black and 3 hispanic employees perform their duties without problem.

You didn't even read any of the shit I posted did you? You clearly missed the line where I put ""This isn't an excuse for black people to not succeed.""

30,"That's what I said... After an entrance exam, none of that matters. If a black guy gets into college he still has to do the homework and pass the test and exams in order to obtain a degree. They don't give a negro-curve in college classes. I just got out of college. [There is racial bias](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/22/305814367/evidence-of-racial-gender-biases-found-in-faculty-mentoring) once black students get into college at times. The entrance exams might not be fair, but everything else is. Once you're in college, you either sink or swim. ",2015-06-22 04:46:13+00:00,csehb78,6,t1_csefckk,4702,TheRedPill

32,"That's a loaded statement that has a nice tint of racism to it that I won't even dive into. As far as the school work, there is not proof that schools hold black students to lower standards of performance other than entrance exams. Black students still must perform at the same level as their white counterparts, the same ay white students must perform as well as the asian students. I'm also a black man who didn't receive a scholarship... If I can make it without an excuse I think you can too. You're acting as if the military wasn't needed to let black people go to college. Pretending that this country has been or is fair to black people is a little silly. It's not an excuse for black people to not succeed, it's not white people's fault if black people don't succeed. But let's not pretend like being black is this magical place where all we do is commit crime and fuck whores without condoms while we get into college for free and easily...

33,"Black guy here, White privilege (which you misspelled) doesn't mean you receive things for free, it means you deal with less things because you're white.

You or me? lol I hate calling simple prejudice ""white privilege"" because it doesn't accurately describe what it is... ",2015-06-22 00:23:03+00:00,csea55v,2,t1_csdzc7f,22131,TheRedPill
