2,"Second what's being said about BIFL/real leather and cheap being mutually exclusive. 

I got the[ Schott 519](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/retro-motorcycle-leather-jacket.htm?catID=7) after years of searching for the perfect jacket. No regrets whatsoever. As far as leather jackets go, that price range is about the low-middle. I know with the proper care that my jacket will easily outlive me, plus the warranty on it is great.

The way I see it, you could buy a new jacket every 3 or 4 years for ~$150-200 that is made of imitation or ""real"" leather and wears out, or you could drop one large initial investment and have something that will easily last for decades, gradually conform to your body exclusively, and be better looking and more comfortable than any substitute.

20,"Okay, last one for now. 

This was another off the grid cabin, middle of nowhere, bring a few kegs and everyone you know and let's get wrecked situation. Even more secluded because this is my friend's property, and he owns about 9 square miles of untouched land near Ward, CO. We are, or should be, the only human beings for miles.

There's probably a couple dozen of us and this is in mid-November if memory serves. The original plan was to camp in tents around a bonfire, but it pretty quickly became more of a blizzard situation with low visibility, high winds, and frostbite levels of cold. This leaves us crammed into a maybe 600 square foot cabin to get fucked up and pass out in a pile. No sweat, we're all friends. Sometime in the middle of the night, everyone's quieting down, and I need a cigarette and to pee. I stumble - pretty wasted - into my coat and boots and throw on several hats. I go outside, the wind has slowed a bit, and the moonlight makes everything coated in ice and snow shine like diamonds. I light my smoke and walk maybe 20 feet into the woods to pee - something every Colorado kid knows by heart is the frostbite windchill chart, and the fact that in this weather flesh freezes in 25 minutes is hard to forget when your johnson's out. Mid stream, though, I hear something or someone another 20-30 feet out in the woods. Though it sounds like a human voice, the wind makes it hard to hear and the snow and dark made it impossible to see. I manage to wiggle my smoke to the corner of my mouth and muster up my best mountain-man voice to yell ""anyone there?"" -- still pissing a river. It takes not a second for me to hear a reply: ""over here!"" in a voice that sounds exactly like my best friend, the kid who owns the cabin. ""You okay, J****?"" I call out. Nothing. So I zip up and go to trudge further out and make sure he's alright. Just as I'm stubbing out my smoke, though, I hear my name called much louder and clearer from the cabin. I yell back that I'm ok, and head back to the cabin with a cursory glance behind me. Who's waiting at the door but the very kid I could swear I heard in the woods. 

I told him I heard something, he told me I was drunk (he wasn't wrong). But he trusted me enough to humor me by helping with a head count. Nobody missing. I tried to forget the whole thing but I was very glad to be sleeping well-armed and in good company that night. What would I have found if I had headed farther out?",2016-08-31 07:19:10+00:00,d73q394,3.0,t1_d73p870,2579.0,AskReddit
21,"For everyone asking for more, [here's the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2kd0y8/my_relative_once_pissed_off_something_deep_in_the/) to a story my relative told me about these very woods. In retrospect it doesn't belong on /r/nosleep because it's *actually* true as far as I know, but it's the most overtly supernatural thing I know of happening out there. 

A lot of the creepiness and happenings in the area are blamed on the so-called Rainbow People (*not* the Rainbow Family, they're fine). According to local legend, they're a group of vagrant hippies who started a simple living cult in the 70's-80's, went up into the woods and just never left. More colorful tellings say that years of isolation and hippy philosophizing warped their minds. The police in small mountain towns like Nederland and Ward acknowledge the existence of small groups of people who may or may not be these folks, and warn that they should be considered dangerous. Apparently they wander around breaking into remote cabins for food/supplies and taking any drug they can manage to get their hands on. 

A close friend has a pretty creepy story about an encounter with a Rainbow Person. He was living in his father's house, a cabin off the grid near Nederland (no running water, plumbing, heat, electricity), where he had a room on the ground floor with a bed directly underneath a large glass sliding door that directly faced thick woods. One night, he was woken up by the sound of something tapping at the glass. He checked his watch and it was around midnight. Half asleep, he blamed it on the wind and - without looking - rolled over to go back to sleep. Later, he is woken up again - watch says it's about an hour later - to the same tapping. He realizes something -- there is no wind tonight, the trees are still. Suddenly awake, he grabs the handgun by his bed (mountain kids, amirite?), sits up, and turns to look. There, not 5 feet from him on the other side of the glass, is a frail, hairy, dirty, ghastly man with tattered clothing and bloodshot eyes, staring right at him. At the sight of the gun this guy scampers back into the woods, but apparently he had been standing there, tapping and staring, for an hour or more.

We used to go out into the woods and party during our high school years, since nobody would bother us and it was easier than staying in town. More than once, we'd be discussing the night the morning after and realize that in a group of 30-50 kids, there were 2 or 3 people who nobody knew. They showed up out of nowhere, talked with people, got high, and then seemed to vanish. Not hard to get away with when everyone is drunk and stoned out of their minds, but unsettling. Once, one of them gave my friend a necklace made of a piece of (allegedly) wolf jaw, and told her to wear it in the woods so the spirits didn't ""hunt"" her. She didn't realize nobody knew the person until days later. 

I'll try and think of any more if you guys think I should keep going.

22,"I used to spend a lot of time solo camping in and around the Indian Peaks wilderness in CO and experienced some weird stuff. Nothing that was outright supernatural, but just unsettling. I love those woods but they give me the creeps. Here are some notable examples from 4-5 trips up there in all seasons.

1 - After thinking that a particular area under a tree and against a rock looked like a great place to set up for the night, I found a shredded sleeping bag and old (must've been 20 years or more) camp supplies. Found a lot of bones around the site too, ribs and vertebrae -- probably elk, but maybe not. I camped elsewhere. 

2 - Found a deer skull out in the middle of a (recently) frozen over lake/pond. Major snow the night before, and the skull was sitting on top of the fresh powder with no tracks anywhere I could see and no other bones. Odd.

3 - Woke up to a squirrel literally nailed to a tree outside my shelter. I had made camp late and tired and in dying light, so I might not have noticed it the night before, but I think I would have, which means it happened sometime while I was asleep.

I have more if anyone cares. I love it up there, especially into the national park off-season and the remoteness of the area is why I go, but it means that when weird things happen they're that much weirder.

68,"This thread is sort of dead but I'll toss in my two cents regardless: I've had the game since 9 last night and have played about 4 hours so far, timing every load. Longest was 45 seconds. On the long side, sure, but reasonable. Frame rate has chugged just ever so slightly maybe three or four times, I only noticed because I was on the lookout. The game is seriously fun and at least from my perspective, people calling it broken are delusional. ",2015-12-01 18:05:03+00:00,cxjc83b,1.0,t3_3uwohv,73916.0,xboxone
69,"I know this struggle too well. 

Joe's Jeans changed my life. I'm a 32"" waist on a good day, and finding 32x36 is a joke at most stores (looking at you, Levi's). Joe's is on the pricey side but they are all cut for extremely long legs regardless of waist -- I have even had to get a pair hemmed! On top of that they're comfortable, well-made, and look fantastic. I own about 4 pairs in styles for every occasion and they are literally the only pants I wear. Nordstrom Rack usually has them. 

Other than that, find a tailor and befriend them. I splurged and have a small handful of clothes that I got in a large to have the length I need, then got tailored to fit close and avoid the garbage bag look. Well worth every penny. ",2015-11-20 08:26:09+00:00,cx6psmp,1.0,t3_3thvaq,33946.0,tall

An intro to political science course could be extremely helpful, and community colleges are generally cheap and easy to schedule. Other than that, find a good newspaper and try to read up on what's happening every day. Google for context.

I am a political science student in college across the country, but you can always pm me if you have any questions and I can try to help! Also here's a dumb little video that could help a little https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6koTFHnH0.

78,"I worked with a guy who is now a good friend whose brother killed himself. My father killed himself as well. Since it was a retail job it was often just us in the store, and since we had similarly twisted senses of humor, jokes were constantly made. Stuff like ""Gee WalkinDewd that blew my mind, just like a shotgun shell to the chin did your dad!"" to which I'd reply ""God, (coworker), that kind of humor is darker than the black trash bag your brother suffocated in."" No feelings were hurt, and I honestly think it was more of a coping mechanism than anything, because it was recent for both of us and the humor, though twisted and probably completely unsympathetic to any third party, was a reminder that someone understood at least a little bit. We did have a couple close calls with customers almost hearing and things like that -- oops.

89,"I found it repetitive, relatively shallow, and sort of ""weightless"" - no real sense of impact or damage. If you play as a warrior/knight, your basic attack involves holding down the trigger and watching a slashing animation repeat over and over again -- forget about parrying, counters, and the other action game staples. The magic was serviceable, but not my vibe. The combat was one of the main reasons I couldn't get into DA:I, no matter how much I wanted to love it.
