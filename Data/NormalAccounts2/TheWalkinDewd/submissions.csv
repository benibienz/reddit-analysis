I caught Pure Disgust last weekend and Turnstile just last night and both shows sucked ass because of all the goddamn hardcore dancers. Moshing is communal, group catharsis, and these little kids are all swinging fists the whole time. Some guys were even just running back in forth jumping out of the pit, knocking people over, which is just not cool imo. Keep the pit in the pit.

I know there's always gonna be die hard pushpitters and die hard hxc dancers, but it seems to me that push pits are inclusive and inviting where hxc dancing just seems selfish, entitled, ""i'm gonna throw punches at nothing and it's on you to get out of my way"". Your good time should not infringe on everyone else's good time.

Can anyone offer insight? It's all love and I respect people's right to go hard however they want, I just miss having fun at gigs and moshing how I want.

It seems to go hand in hand with the ""fuck capitalism"" crowd.

No. No to this. Communism as a system doesn't work, this has been shown time and time again in the last century. It assumes people are altruistic without tangible reward. Its flaws go deeper than being functionally shit, too -- communist regimes have invariably led to shortages, horrible quality of life if not death on an enormous scale (See Mao, the Khmer Rouge, the Katyn Massacre, and the USSR, among innumerable others), and corrupt/despotic officials. The USSR in particular had a hand in *more than one* genocide, which I would say is a heavy blow against the merits of communism. I am from Europe and have many friends from the Eastern part of the continent that regard the hammer and sickle the same as they do the swastika, and I am inclined to see this as reasonable.

Even if you can prove to me that communism is functional, practical and perfect, though (it fucking is not), the idiocy of this particular ""trend"" is also in its complete hypocrisy and lack of self awareness. Extoll communism all you want, but your soapbox is mighty fucking low if your parents pay for everything (including your expensive private education) and you can't live without the latest apple products. If I hear one more person talk about the fallacies of capitalism and the merits of communist systems while tweeting on their iphone and wearing a $1000 outfit, I'm going to scream.

16,2015-09-14 07:09:05+00:00,self.MadMax,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadMax/comments/3kvqqu/witness_my_functional_canon_for_the_mad_max/,False,"First of all, I know there's no ""official"" canon or timeline for the Mad Max universe, but for those of us who like a rough order to things, I am writing here what I consider to be the canonical order of all the movies -- and the game, which I consider a key piece of the puzzle. This is all pretty much opinion so feel free to disagree with me. And obviously, spoilers abound. 

Here's my canon in chronological order -- I will elaborate after:

1st - Mad Max (duh)
2nd - Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (also sort of duh)
3rd - Mad Max -- the 2015 video game (bear with me because this is the dubious part)
4th - Mad Max: Fury Road
5th - Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome

After having completed the game, I feel very strongly that it is a direct prequel to Fury Road. This is for several reasons (Spoilers obviously): First and most glaringly, the game directly references events and factions that play a huge role in Fury Road. Scabrous Scrotus, the game's antagonist, is Immortan Joe's son. Gastown is an in-game location. The game ends with Max retrieving the Interceptor and heading across the plains of silence, which I believe directly leads to his capture and imprisonment in the Citadel. Also, I noticed that if you follow the upgrade tree for Max in the game, he ends up looking very much like his first appearance in Fury Road, with long and shaggy hair and beard and an overall bulkier, more imposing appearance thanks to the clunky vest and many pouches over his person. 

Finally and perhaps most damning is the reason I like this order the most -- the game clears up a plot confusion in Fury Road. The little girl that Max has visions of throughout the movie confused me on my first few viewings, as Max had a son, not a daughter. But the game confirms that this ghostly girl is not Max's child, she is the girl named Glory from the game, one of Scrotus' victims and a catalyst for the further destabilization of Max's mind, as he saw her and her mother as family figures before they were murdered, with Max powerless to help. Glory even tells Max to stay with her, saying ""you can be pa"", explaining why her apparition in Fury Road refers to him as dad. Indeed, the final cutscene of the game sees Max reverently placing a picture of the pair on the dash of the Interceptor before he drives into the distance. 

I think that this explains Max's especially ""Mad"" state in Fury Road - as the traumatizing events are still fresh in his mind - as well as his refusal to let more people die if he can help it. 

After Fury Road, Max has lost the Interceptor, and we see an older Max in Beyond Thunderdome go the entire film without the car. This makes sense for obvious reasons. If I had to guess where in my canon the next Mad Max movie will go, I'd put it between Fury Road and Beyond Thunderdome. 

The stickiest aspect of my canon is also concerning his car -- the Interceptor is presumably destroyed in the Road Warrior, but Max starts out the video game with it. I suppose it is possible that the car survived/was repaired, however unlikely, but I contend that this is a problem with my timeline. However, seeing as George Miller has actively refused to confirm any sort of canon, I see this as as close as we're gonna get!

Let me know what you guys think or if I missed anything! 

I just came for the guzzolene. 

EDIT: I understand I may be repeating/restating some theories buzzing around this sub. I know that there is no official canon or continuity and I'm not trying to say my opinions are definitive truth!

I understand the story implications but the way this was implemented feels sort of cheap to me. MGS5 was toted as the missing chapter in the Metal Gear saga, the tell-all of Big Boss's mysterious descent from hero to villain. I thought most of the story satisfied this goal well, showing how Naked Snake got in over his head with revenge and good intentions, until the ending when SURPRISE you were never actually playing as Big Boss! No, he's been off running errands while you create a legacy for him! The legendary soldier actually had almost no hand in the events of the game! The whole ""we are both big boss"" speech did not satisfy me in the slightest (although granted, it solves some later plot holes). The twist robs the entire game of its fun to me -- sneaking around as the greatest soldier who ever lived isn't fun when I know that I am not in fact that soldier! I'm going to go back to Mad Max for a while, at least in that game you actually play as the main character.

It seems to me that retail (and most all minimum-wage jobs, though I can't speak from experience on those) is simply not that hard, which contradicts the enormous pseudo-culture of retail workers that act like martyrs and noble scapegoats for just doing what they were hired to do. 

Yes, customers can be difficult. Yes, corporate demands can be obtuse and stressful. Yes, the pay is shit. 

But people are difficult everywhere every day, and I've dealt with countless irate and irrational customers without adopting some sort of martyr complex because it's simply my job. It doesn't bother me when people scream at me because I know that it isn't personal, and I can hang up my nametag at the end of the day and not bring other people's bad attitude home with me. Corporate standards and demands are also not a stressor, as I am simply doing what they pay me to do -- even if I don't agree, it doesn't really matter. 

And the pay is bad because the job isn't hard. Customer service, inventory management, and sales are not very demanding if you are a reasonably organized and disciplined person. Even making barely above minimum wage, I've managed to cover my day-to-day expenses and also tuck away a decent savings. Granted this is with 2 or 3 jobs at one time, but even so, not particularly difficult ones. 

I truly do not believe that workers like myself or those in similar industries deserve a ~15 dollar wage. The demands of the job do not warrant that kind of money, plain and simple.

Above all, I can't stand when others who work retail incessantly bitch and moan about their jobs. Sure everyone has a bad day here and there, and there's nothing wrong with that, but those who truly think their job is hard as all fuck smack of ungratefulness to me. I consider myself lucky as hell to have a job at all. There are thousands, if not millions of people who would love to do the job you claim to hate.

TL;DR retail work is not that hard, you don't deserve $15/hr, and if you constantly complain about your job please quit so someone who appreciates employment can fill your shoes.
