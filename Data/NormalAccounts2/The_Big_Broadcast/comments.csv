0,I relate to this so fucking much. I hate how I act in real life when I'm not really depressed. I act so cringy and silly and shitty in my eyes. I can't love myself like that. I wish I was just...calmer. Simpler. Not so outwardly irritating. Most people don't care or notice but I do. God...I hate this,2016-04-19 14:24:07+00:00,d28vqsa,1.0,t3_4fdtal,65348.0,depression

Thanks man (: 

Although I did see a cut on his arm a few days ago, it wasn't very noticable and he was acting normal. It was just one. I'm probably just paranoid, but I still asked him about it and he said he just kinda had it and didn't know. I said it looked like a knife cut and he said idk I guess it could be.

19,"This. I know for me personally, I'm extremely conflicted when it comes to commenting on anything in this sub or a self harm sub or something like that. Any sub where people are going through a tough time. 

It's so hard for me to feel normal when I respond because I just want to help *everybody*, you know? I mean I know I can't be a solution, but I just want to show people that someone's out there who cares. But at the same time it would be weird if I responded to every post or something. Or maybe I could make a different account for every comment so it's not weird. Maybe this is stupid but whenever I think about how I'm not doing that I feel like a massive asshole.

And sometimes I'm just so paranoid that whatever I say will be taken the wrong way or won't help and it will just make someone more depressed or trigger them or whatever. That thought scares me because hurting people is the opposite of what I want to do. I think for some people it's hard to get out of that mindset, that whatever they say can do that- and it's true, it can, but it can also help. You can't tell which, though, and it depends on the person you're talking to, so I think that possibility, however small, scares some people, myself included.

But besides that, maybe it doesn't occur to some people to comment, or they just assume someone else will. Or they're just too depressed themselves to do it. Or they don't know how they can help.

There's a lot of reasons. I'm aware I probably went overboard and you probably didn't mean all of this by ""they just don't know what to comment"", so I'm sorry, but I just wanted to say this for anybody who feels like nobody cares or will read their posts or anything- **we all do, really.**

But although this isn't meant as an excuse, it's still hard for some people. Myself included. It tears me apart that anyone on this sub is depressed in the first place because I don't feel like anyone deserves that, or the things that happen that could cause depression. But it's such a scary concept to me, trying to help people, if I even feel like I can on a given day. Maybe it's because I personally don't even feel ""normal"" or in a state where someone could help *me* most of the time, so being able to help someone else seems so far out there that I feel like it wouldn't do any good if I tried.",2016-01-30 16:55:45+00:00,czho4wh,2.0,t1_czhjrtw,9163.0,depression

Me? I...don't know really. I'm depressed although I've been clean for maybe a few weeks in at least a big sense. I've been punching stuff sometimes and scratching when I'm really stressed along with picking at those hangnail things that aren't technically hangnails (you know, like above the nail itself on the skin, those stupid little things), but I did that already. Today I'm doing mildly better than usual because school stresses the hell out of me and I managed to get out of it today so I'm not stressed, just depressed. I was thinking of cutting earlier, idk if I will. I'm still afraid to wear short sleeves at school because I'm afraid of what people will think. I did meet someone recently who used to cut, though, and if she can do it maybe I can too. I also just talked to one of my friends and she apparently is depressed in a similar way to me a lot.

40,"As someone who just went through a breakup, I'm sorry man. She was my first relationship, still wants to be friends.....yeah. It will get easier- although I myself am not to that point yet- but you can't dwell on the past. That's my only advice, and I know that's really shitty and probably doesn't help, but you can't do that. Living in the past isn't living, believe me. You'll regret it if you do. I'm still trying to figure out how to not do that myself and it's definitely not easy, but you can do it. I get that shitty feeling where it feels like you can't be happy again because you were happy and now you're not. It fucking sucks, but holding on too long is just fear of letting go. 

It's okay to be afraid to do that, but sometime it will get better, believe me. Not the magical kind of it-will-get-better, but it will. You just have to let it. Please don't fall into depression or anything like that over this- it's not worth it. She cares about you, and she clearly doesn't hate you or anything like that otherwise she wouldn't still want to be friends- she's the one trying to text you. It was something amazing, and it may be gone, but that doesn't mean you'll never be happy again. Don't let yourself fall because of this- it's not worth it and it never will be worth it.

As for the cutting, as someone who's addicted (you said you weren't), please, don't let it continue. There are a billion other ways to feel better. This is not one of them. It never, ever, will be one of them. There is currently a user on one of the self harm subs who, at his last post maybe a week ago, was effectively slowly killing himself through massive blood loss. I won't say who, and he may be fine by now. He wasn't totally hopeless, he *could've* stopped and saved himself, but truthfully I don't want to find out if he did. I'm not saying that you'll reach that point if you continue. Most of us don't, ever. But you need to stop before it goes any further. Even just stable, regular cutting (which actually doesn't exist by the way), is too dangerous to bother with. Cutting isn't exactly safe in any way, really. Infections and all that especially. This is something that will get worse unless you take control. And you can take control.

I might not need to say this, but one of us really want to be here. I remember a quote from the lead singer of Alice in Chains, who was a heavy drug addict. It's stuck with me, he tried detox multiple times and it never worked for him. He said he didn't do it anymore for the rush...he only did it because he was addicted. I know that's stupidly simple (and drug addiction is different from self harm) but honestly, none of us really want to self harm. Even me, I mean fuck the reason I do it is because I feel so lost that I feel sometimes like doing it gives me some kind of fucked up personality, sense of who I am. But I know, I know it doesn't. So I would like just to say, please, stop. She, and everyone else who cares about you, or even just knows you exist, would want you to if they knew. They care. There are many other ways to get some kind of release, high, to feel better, etc. And addiction of any kind, including this, isn't one of them. 

Please don't become dependent on something that will hurt you. Even if you want to hurt. You'll regret it. So, please, please stop. I mean c'mon, you don't deserve to do that to yourself. :)

50,"Honestly I don't really know what would be a good choice but...I mean in terms of like an anti-depression movie, idk if that's what you want. But I do know some kickass movies (imo at least)! :D

-*Kingsman: The Secret Service* was really good I thought! Like Kick-Ass mixed with Bond. Both uses and abandons cliches to full effect I think, and generally just awesome. If you've seen it you'll know why. There is some mild gore if you're not into that.

-The last two James Bond movies were fucking awesome- *Skyfall* and *Spectre*.

-Paper Towns is kind of a teen movie and everything but I went to see it with the person who first brought me out of depression so it's got a big place in my heart. Great movie but not anything spectacular. The tone kinda shifts around.

-I've heard from my dad that the new movie they made about Steve Jobs is really good even if you aren't a fan of apple. Haven't seen it but he loved it.

-If you like Batman and you somehow haven't seen them already, the Dark Knight trilogy.

-I've heard Straight Outta Compton is good from a friend who hates rap so I'm guessing it can't be that bad. No idea what it's like but he really liked it. Sorry that's probably not helpful at all haha

-We're the Millers is supposedly pretty funny. Haven't seen the whole thing so I don't know but everyone I know says it's great.

-Oh yeah, Jurassic World was fucking incredible. I loved it! It's, you know, the plot is kind of predictable if you're wondering what it's like- it's Jurassic Park. But it was seriously good

-I haven't seen it yet because I live under a rock but if you like Star Wars...episode seven. You know, haha. As someone who likes Star Wars, even if it turns out to be shit I know I'd still leave it with a holy shit that was incredible kind of feeling.

-The Good Dinosaur is supposedly really awesome and there's no chance in hell it's not at least a little uplifting.

-Indiana Jones, Taken, I don't know. I'm just naming action/adventure movies at this point. You did say anything positive haha :)

I don't watch as many movies as I'd like but if I can reiterate for a sec, unless you don't like it, Indiana Jones. I'd like to stress how much I like those movies. I can't watch them without being really cheerful haha, they just do something to me. Not so much the fourth one. Wasn't terrible but y'know, heh.

Sorry for rambling and sorry if that didn't help. Hope it did though. Have fun haha :)

*Oh my god while I was typing that everyone else responded...jesus, I ramble. Oh well. And like the other guy said actually, Inside Out. I forgot about it but it was very, very good. That's better than most of what I recommended honestly

62,"Me, personally, mine goes away when I'm with people. I had a very good friend who I was in a relationship with for months who pulled me totally out of it. It was the first time in my life I've ever felt really happy, like I belong somewhere. I'm afraid I don't know what's happening to me at this point and to be honest I don't even know where to begin. I just know that she's the only person I've ever felt like I can confide in and at this point I....I just don't know anymore. As someone who never has she was the only person who's ever made me feel like I could. She isn't dead or gone away and we're on good terms, but not dating her has kind of made me start thinking that I can only fight my depression when I have someone else, which I think may be true, I don't know.

But sorry this isn't about me. If there's any advice I can give it's that if you can find someone like that, don't let go and treat them right. Doesn't matter if it's an SO or your parents or whoever. When you're depressed the only thing you have is other people. Or at least that all I've had. I can't even trust my own thoughts at this point.

I'm sorry if that's shit advice but don't take anyone for granted and ask for help. If they really care about you, they might not understand, but they'll be there for you if you need them. For me it was that and the guilt of feeling so bad when I had people who made me so happy around me. They were kind of fighting each other and I still don't know who's winning. I understand that this might sound like one of those automatic response things that some people say but really, this is the best advice I can give.

But don't take anyone, anyone for granted. Ever. And if you don't have someone, you can find them. Somebody out there would seriously care about you (if no one does now) if they knew you, or knew what you were having to go through. Sorry about rambling. I hope this helps some, sorry if it didn't.

64,"Personally, I don't think music helps me. My go-to songs all just drive me deeper, like my own world I can escape to where I can stop caring. But on a lighter note hahah, there are some that don't do that.

[Time by Chris Cornell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8Hne0Aww28) is one. The pink floyd song is also great but this is kind of a depressing and accepting song at the same time. Like life, sort of. The message I always get from it is that time's always going to pass and you can't hold on forever, but while you can you should make the most of it. I'm addicted to it. That and [...Like Clockwork by Queens of the Stone Age.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rehpjoqkflc) Kind of sad but strangely it doesn't actually make me any more depressed, it's melancholy to me and it isn't only pessimistic. A seriously beautiful song though.

Also [Monotov's Private Opera by Third Eye Blind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjLHhgXNfw8) is one of my favorite songs ever. I love the message and it kind of counteracts everything the rest of my music does to me. I really like that and I try not to reject how good it can make me feel. It's helped me through some stuff.

Sorry for the length, I just really like music haha. I like how it affects people and how everybody's tastes are unique- and that everybody listens to it at least a little. I mean that's one reason I'm not (currently) as depressed as I could be, I've always wanted to join a band. Once I realized that it's not just noise and that the bands I listen to, no matter how heavy, had to put real thought and passion behind their music, the entire thing just becomes really beautiful to me. Just the thought of being able to express yourself so easily like that and that you can help other people with it too is something I've always thought awesome. 

Again, sorry for the ramble by the way. And thanks for making this post :)

I mean unless it was just a one time thing, and even then you still should. This is coming from someone who's had very similar thoughts. Please. I have no idea what the thoughts were like for you but I tortured myself by tricking myself into believing that if I didn't do something, I won't say what, someone who didn't even exist would die. It got to the point where I was doing it every minute of every day. It was a combination of paranoia and being obsessive compulsive and just a bunch of junk that's wrong with me. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if I have psychosis.

I'm not saying you do, hell I don't even know if I do, but please, reach out and get help.

If you want specifics on what happened to me just ask but please please dude, I felt the exact same way and I don't want anyone else to have that happen to them. I didn't self harm then and I managed to get out of it. I still have the same thing but it isn't nearly as severe as it was then.

What is was for me was a disconnection from reality, like I was trapped in my own world I created for myself where if I didn't do something something totally unrelated and unrealistic would happen. Usually it involved death or injury to someone I thought I loved. Please don't let that happen. Even if it wasn't real I thought it was and that's what was so awful. My brain tricked me into thinking that the stuff that goes on in my head was real. Don't let that happen, stop it now. Go see a therapist, psychiatrist, anyone. Talk to someone about it and if it's hard to explain, explain it anyway. 

I'm sorry if I'm overreacting but it might be in my post history somewhere, if not I'll link it to you, what my thoughts were like I mean. What happened to me was stupid yeah, but also fucking horrible, and I just never want to see anyone go through that. I...I guess I might be overreacting but please, still, get help.

69,"I just do it because honestly I don't know how to cope at this point in my life, or if I can. I'm young but a while back I had sort of a mental episode that lasted for weeks or maybe months, I don't remember. The end result from that is that I'm overly paranoid about everything, but mostly other people getting hurt or killing themselves. 

I guess I project how unstable can be sometimes onto other people. But also a big part of that is just that I also had kind of a whole do-I-exist kind of crisis back then and what I did to myself mentally has never fully left me I guess. I hate to admit it but it hasn't I don't think. It's really hard to explain but it's just like I feel totally isolated sometimes, like I...I don't know, can't coexist with other people? Just like I'm totally abnormal in a bunch of ways. In an existential sense. It's recently been starting to seem like it's going back to the sort of black hole I was in back then, like I'm accepting that I'm mentally fucked up somehow. I wouldn't kill myself because I don't want to do that to anyone and I still have hope I might make it out of this but I don't know. I'm scheduled to see a psychiatrist soon.

But I guess the easiest way to describe it that it's like I'm constantly building this world around me from everything I see and hear and shit. Like because I don't know, like I'm not understanding literally anything. Like not being able to comprehend what it means to exist maybe. Or if any of us do. Kind of pretentious. It's all just a bunch of bullshit that's never left me and I hate myself for it. Although if I hadn't done all of that stuff to myself I might never have met the one person who's the reason I'm still alive today and the only person who's ever made me feel like I belong somewhere. I'm grateful for that.

I'm getting that kind of image like you said actually, this does kind of remind me of a twenty one pilots song, not that that's a bad thing.

As for tweaking and everything, I know this answer might not be what you're looking for but, to me- I mean other people on this sub might have a different opinion on this- but a large part of songwriting for me is not going overboard with changing the lyrics just...for the sake of changing them? If that makes any sense. That's probably not what you're trying to do but you know just be aware of that. You're the songwriter, do whatever you want. 

I mean there really aren't rules, if you think the lyrics don't say what you're trying to say well enough (in this case I think you could use some stronger word choices in places, maybe a few words that are slightly less generic), change them. But if they do- and you know what you want to say better than anyone else does- don't change them. You don't have to write really complex or simplistic kinds of lyrics. Don't limit yourself, I guess. Experiment with the way you write. Or if you have a better idea for a verse or something but the other one is good too, don't scrap it. Turn one or the other into something else in maybe a different song, or just combine them. It's really up to what you think is best for the song, what you want to say, and what fits best with it, sorry for the ramble.

As for the lyrics, I kind of get them to mean that the one singing is maybe suicidal, as is the person he/she's talking to, and they're unsure about how to deal with their own problems and the problems of the person who probably needs them right a lot now. They don't know if either of them is going to be okay but there's hope they might be able to be if they have each other.

Some days it's harder and some days I feel like I can work my way out of it by not focusing on it, but whenever I do it just comes back and it's been coming back easier, I don't know but thanks. I know self-diagnosis is kinda unreliable but part of me honestly wants to be fucked up, I'm one of those people. I have to get some kinda name for what's wrong with me I guess. It makes me feel like I have some control.I just kinda feel like I want to fall into that kinda warm sadness that sucks sort of but I don't know.

But seriously though, thanks. I appreciate every word, you're awesome. To answer your questions I'm on good terms with my family, we're a weird family and my dad is super stressed all the time since he never really stops working but otherwise we're okay. I mean besides him being stressed and me being a slacker in school, we're okay. I can convince them that everything is okay and regularly I do actually, I mean I'm almost late or late every day and I get a lot of 0s and bad grades which they don't like but they're easy to convince. I love them but I almost feel like just don't care anymore about school or anything like that. That said, though, it's kind of hard to not care when you make people mad or sad by not caring. I'm nice and I don't like doing that so I'm conflicted sort of

But yeah I just kinda don't want them to know. It would just complicate things and they don't totally know how to deal with people who aren't normal since they themselves are kind of weird. Although I might be able to convince them to take me to a psychiatrist without me telling them outright, I don't know. I just don't want to put that on them. I never told them last time I was depressed and just I don't know. I could tell them I guess but I really don't want to make either of them any more stressed. It could work if I did but...

My school counsellors would really not likely understand but I could try that I suppose. I don't know of any professionals off hand but it wouldn't be hard to find one since I'm near a big city. I don't know but yeah I don't want to keep this in anymore but at the same time I'm afraid of telling people. I mean I'm afraid of telling my friend I was talking about at least, she's been the only one I've ever told about this and even she said she didn't understand. I mean seriously I talked to windows and believed in true love, it was stupid. I don't blame her. But yeah I've talked to her so much about me and I've let everything in my head get so carried away with what I've said to her that even though we're somehow okay still I don't know what would happen if I told her. I guess I kind of project how unstable I am onto other people, I kind of assume that if I do something wrong people would commit suicide because of it. It's weird I guess. Mostly with her but I don't know, anyway sorry for the ramble I just...you have any advice about how I should get started so I can talk to a professional? I mean I could just do it point blank I guess but I'm just kind of confused about what I should do. The whole thing kind of seems more complicated than it is I guess or maybe it really is that complicated.

Sorry for the rant, and thank you. I just need to vent I guess. It's honestly a shifting thing too. I felt better today but I just don't know, sometimes I feel like I want to die and then I'm okay but it's never consistent really. Anyway thanks, I appreciate it and sorry for the ramble

But listen, cutting yourself isn't a solution- go spend time with someone who doesn't cheat on you. Unless he was totally upstanding before this and was a really great boyfriend, to purposely avoid you like that because you've apparently been mean...I mean, unless you actually were mean, I don't know, but I doubt it...that's a pretty bad thing to do on his part.

I think it might be possible to reconcile with him but that's only if you think he's that worth it. If he's such a nice guy that him cheating on you and avoiding you is somehow acceptable. The vast majority of people aren't that nice, especially after already doing it although I don't know him and I don't know what happened leading up to this.

Do what feels right, besides self harm. You only have so much time left - we all do - so you shouldn't waste it hurting yourself. Go spend time with people you love who will miss you when you're gone. Give them awesome memories that they'll look back on after you've gone and then, they'll smile and remember how happy you made them. I don't know how long you have but that doesn't really matter- don't waste any time with that. Do what makes you happy, and make the ones you love happy too. I'm sorry, I wish I could help more or give better advice. And I'm sorry you're having to go through this. Just remember that you should do what you think is the best use of your time. If you feel like you're hurting him, stop, and if you're hurting yourself, stop. ...And you are hurting the ones who care about you when you hurt yourself. There are good ways to release that don't involve pain or death, I know. And they'll be grateful that you don't. They wouldn't want you to, even if they don't know about it. They would want you to tell them. It's better to tell someone then take it out on yourself, believe me. Maybe not him, but that's up to you. Best of luck with this and I hope you can work this out without blaming yourself, especially for something that doesn't sound like it's your fault :)",2015-11-24 06:56:35+00:00,cxb5s0y,1.0,t3_3u1oe7,3118.0,selfharm

83,"I wish I could give some advice haha, I'm probably not experienced enough to do that though. But it is good, I really like it. The word play is kinda bland in some spots, though. Like where you say empty four times in the first two verses- although considering the title that makes sense, so if you want to give it that kind of sense the lyrics are great in that regard. That's not really a big deal. 

The only thing I can see maybe wrong is that there isn't any chorus, just verses. Again if that's part of the theme don't let it stop you (or if you write lyrics like poetry), but you may want to consider adding one and seeing how it sounds to you. You could have one with and one without and see which is better actually, I've done that before, when I was stuck on if I wanted to add something in but I wasn't really sure. But again, not really a big deal.

In terms of just being lyrics, yeah, they really are good. You could elaborate a little more (wordplay wise or just adding more lyrics) maybe but otherwise they're great. I like it a lot, sorry for the ramble haha.",2015-11-15 03:52:11+00:00,cx0lj5h,1.0,t3_3stu0r,20575.0,Songwriters

I tried making it so they did with stone/below and file/trail and then having it so that the third line of the first part of the verses rhymed with the end of the first line of the second part of the verses and the fourth line of the second part of the verses. 

Nothing else does now that I think about it. It's weird yeah and probably isn't practical at all, I'll work on it. 

And about it being a literary piece, even if that's not a good thing that's kind of what I was going for haha.

Frank Zappa and Of Montreal write stuff more sensical than this, but then again that's just looking at the surface, I don't know how much meaning you put behind it. Regardless, it's awesome.
