We were talking about random shit just hanging out late at night until somehow we got into the topic of people who self harm and depression and all of that shit. My friend said what he usually says about cutters: ""hate em/it's hilarious"". Just for clarification by the way, my friend, as much as he seems like one, isn't an asshole. I think he has a good heart. He uses specifics to make a point sometimes- like, he didn't mean all cutters. He meant those people who some would call ""attention whores"" who go around looking for attention or whatever.

I personally don't have an opinion on that except that I will always be sympathetic for anyone who would consider cutting themselves. Anyway when he said that (we'd kinda been spilling some more personal shit all night), I took off my flannel...that's so hipster-y sounding haha. But yeah I took it off and pointed at my arm. He looked kinda confused and then I showed him my scars. I've maybe been clean for like two weeks or so now. I'm weirdly proud of myself but I still get the urge even now. I want to quit but fuck, my knife is so close. And I'm so close to being able to be comfortable in short sleeves again. Fuck.

We got more into the conversation and he pointed at me and said ""I didn't even know he did that, see he doesn't go around telling people about it"". All I had time to say was that I wasn't proud of it and that it was just something for people who didn't know how to cope.

Yeah that's a generalization, I know. The exact truth about why everyone cuts obviously depends, I was just trying to give kind of an overview. In a way, I think that's true. Sorry if that offends anyone, idk.

I didn't wear my flannel for the rest of the night pretty much. It felt so free, lol. I was shaking the entire time though. I couldn't stop myself from being nervous. We all spent the night and the next morning I mentioned to them that I don't want anyone knowing I cut. I don't think he'd tell anyone.

I don't know. I also mentioned, seriously, for once, that I was kind of suicidal and I had depression. And that I go to therapy. I feel weirdly liberated but I don't know. I'm not used to being this open with people.

I don't know why I'm writing this. I guess I just wanted to share. My friends didn't care. And I'm really glad. That could've turned out way worse. I hope that for any of you who are thinking about telling someone (whether you do or did), that they take it well.

As for me I'm sitting here kind of in a gloomy mood. I almost want to cut right now but I don't think I will. I like scars more than open wounds, it wouldn't be worth it but still. I've been feeling like I'm almost capable of not being depressed recently, like I can pull myself out of this if I try hard enough. I hope I do. Just the thought makes my brain lock up.

I feel like everywhere I go, everything I do, is just a place for me to explore my thoughts. Except I'm not a deep thinker. I don't think about anything important. I just get distracted and it's so fucking frustrating. I think about loads of stuff- but none of it has any significance. It's just something to occupy my time.

So what do I do when I explore my thoughts? My mind, and me, are so fucking empty that all I do is say, rather emotionlessly, that life is pointless. I have no evidence to support that. I know both sides of the coin- telling myself that everything is shit, and knowing that it isn't. It's like I'm too conscious of what I'm doing to let the depression totally take over because I *know* it's depression. In a way I don't always let it get to me, and that's good I guess. But I've overanalyzed to the point that all I can do is worry softly and exist. And the worrying sucks so much, and I hate caring so much, that it makes me more depressed.

That's probably one of the reasons I'm depressed, to be honest.

I can't deal with life. I don't want to deal with life- except I don't have anything in life to deal with. I have no recurring problems. I'm not bullied at school. My grades are total shit but that's only because I don't care. I have two loving parents, who do their best even if my dad works way too much. We're average, middle class. The only negative things about our family are that we're weird, I hate being an only child (I can't hide), and my dad is extremely messy and a hoarder (if an organized one). He's also very overworked and stressed. My grades bring the family down and stress us all out. Even me, a little, even though I don't care. I'm probably going to fail high school at this rate. More than halfway through Sophomore year. Let's see me pull outta this one, huh? I'm gonna look back and beat myself up for not giving more of a shit. Future good times.

Funny how one of my biggest fears is being a manchild. It's probably my biggest fear, actually. I loathe the thought of becoming like that. I want experience, I want something. I don't want to be living in my parent's basement (we actually have a basement, so hey I'm one step closer) after high school and having them provide for me. The very thought makes me want to cry but that's probably because I'm so fucking sheltered part of me knows there's a chance I'll end up like that. I do absolutely nothing with my life. I'm a fucking childish freak and I know it. But nobody can see that. Maybe if they could I'd care about changing. What's the point?

Where was I? I forget where I was going with this.

Oh, yeah. The point of this post is basically to say that I'm a big horrifying piece of fucking nothing. I AM nothing. I'M NOTHING. I AM FUCKING NOTHING. Maybe if I repeat it enough it'll have meaning. But it won't. Nothing's not an identity. Nothing's nothing. Nothing's me. Existence sucks.

Oh god help me. My entire life is like one big, hardly noticeable SOS flag except I don't know what I need to be saved from and I don't know what being saved even means.

God I just want to be happy again. That's all I fucking want. I want to be in one of the only places I remember being happy- hugging her, kissing her. Going out. Not feeling like a freak. Feeling okay. Hugging, kissing someone. Having companionship. Not being alone. Being with someone who makes me happy. I can't handle shit on my own. God I wish I could. I feel so isolated.

A few days earlier I cried. I've always wanted to and I finally did. I was sitting behind my old girlfriend on our bus from school and...we broke up on good terms, it wasn't something either of us could control, but god I just feel such fucking regret...I miss everything we used to do, god. The touch of our lips, hugging. Cuddling. Neither of us even considered it dating, really. It was just...god, it was a connection. She brought me out of my first bout with depression. I was totally free the day I met her. God fucking dammit. It was so wonderful...

I got off the bus and as I was walking by I just wanted it to accelerate and kill me right there. The regret combined with just everything else that day, I just wanted to fucking die. I got to my gate and when it drove away I cried a little. Just a little. I've had a revelation since then, I guess. Idk.

Maybe I'm depressed because it's a coping mechanism. It forces me to stop giving a shit. Makes me feel real. Makes me not empty. Better to feel bad than to feel nothing, right? I don't know. I don't know what happened a day or two ago either but suddenly I felt half okay. Music is more fun for me now. I lost interest in a lot of stuff like music, not because I didn't like it, I love it, but it just...you know, it didn't do anything for me. I didn't really enjoy it as much. Now I can't stop listening to it.

Good news, right?

Yeah no I still want to be depressed. I want to see where the river goes. I want to have that pit in my stomach...I hate myself for feeling this way but goddammit I can't help it. I'm addicted to pain, sadness. Such a massive warm blanket of nothing. I'm so conflicted about this whole mess but I hope it straightens out. For now, I'm ok. It's only in the back of my mind.

I've been on this and the selfharmpics sub for a while now and I thought I should share.

For some backstory I'm in an audio/video/journalism class in high school. We do things like write news articles, feature stories, record short films/animations/newscasts, etc etc. Things like that. It's kinda hands on, not like working out of textbooks or anything. Fun class, I like it. I mean I'm too depressed and too much of a lazy fuck to do much actual work but I still love the class.

Anyway, she's in the class as well. Not my period but she still has it and she was working on a solo project recently, we saw it when my group was fucking around on a project we were supposed to be doing and her cut outs of characters were already on a podium below a camera. It was a stop motion animation. The weird thing was she was working at it alone. People do work in that class, it's not a blow off, but still people usually don't put in extra time if they don't have to. I didn't know what it was at the time but I thought it looked cool.

I honestly don't know if I should link it. It probably includes her name and the name of our school, and the message isn't the best possible message to self harmers/depressed people. It has a happy ending but it might get some people down? I don't know. I don't know if I should.

But as for the story of it, as far as I can tell, it's her story. I say that because she worked at it alone and I've seen a few scars she has on her arms. I think. I don't know, to be honest, but it doesn't really matter. It's a very short animation. It tells the story of a girl who, after being insulted by her classmates and being depressed, etc, starts cutting herself. She eventually meets a guy who makes her feel wanted, loved. He draws a butterfly on her arm and it ends happily.

I thought it was lovely, even if short. Maybe the message wasn't the best (finding someone else to make her feel better and all, idk if that's a bad message) but I was focused on the happy ending. I was just touched by it, I guess. My friends, in fact most people, weren't, though. Nobody went around insulting her for it or shit like that but people just didn't like it or didn't get it. A large amount of my friends make fun of self harmers pretty regularly (even though I cut, they don't know, or not outright). They aren't assholes, they just don't get it or they think it's ""hilarious"" as in one of my friends. They wouldn't berate someone for it I don't think but they aren't sympathetic, is my point. I also live in a small christian town in the first place, so it made some people uncomfortable. They weren't vocal about it but you can tell. One guy said ""you should only find comfort in Jesus Christ"". Nothing wrong with that, but again you get my point.

But- that stop motion animation, with the weird paper cut outs done in colored pencil that everybody laughed at, turned out to be entered into a competition here in my state. It steadily progressed up the ranks winning more and more stuff until eventually we get to about a week ago, where it won State. The first place animation in the traditional animation category if I recall. I sit with her at lunch and she showed me the plaque she got for it.

To be honest I don't really know the point of this post. I guess it just got to me and I wanted to share it with you guys. I mean, to me, no matter how she stopped self harming, she still did. And not only that, but she went on to make it into a good thing for her. She won a competition with an animation of her story. First place. She isn't what any of those people in that animation said she was. An idiot or ugly. She's beautiful and probably really smart. She has a boyfriend and a job now and seems happy. I'm really happy for her.

Truth be told I don't know. I'm sorry if this is weird.

It just gives me hope. This has made me realize that I have a chance. That it's possible to get out if that makes sense. And not only that, but maybe I can even try and make something positive out of it somehow. I don't know. It just makes me smile. That we all have a chance for a happy ending.

I'm depressed. But not as much. I can be worse. I can get worse. I want that pit to open up in my stomach, I want to stop being confused about how I am. About feeling so wrong. I want to be more depressed. I want it to hurt. It's better than being confused, to me. I hope it doesn't sound like I'm taking what anyone on this sub goes through lightly, nor am I making a joke out of it. Many, many people have it much, much worse than me. But I've reached a point in my life where feeling horrible almost sounds better than being like I am now. Confused. Uncomfortable always. Feeling wrong.

I don't know if these feelings make any sense and to be honest I don't even know if I want that. I suppose ideally I'd like to be happy but that feeling doesn't come as much as the other one. I hope no one takes offense to this. I just hate living. 

There isn't any easy way to describe how I'm feeling that I can think of. I feel so fucking wrong and unreal and I'm almost never comfortable and nothing ever feels okay and I almost want to die. I do want to die. I fantasize about it sometimes. Goddammit. I'm sorry for existing.

Like a 600 mile road trip and we were really close to home. I live in Texas if that helps. It was very likely on a local radio station. Maybe The Eagle or the 102.1 The Edge.

Anyway, one thing I remember about the song was that it sounded like the saddest thing ever to me. Thinking back it might not have been that sad, idk, but it sounded so mellow and drawn out and just ugh. I didn't want it to end.

That isn't all though, sorry. Here's what I remember specifically.

The vocalist, to me, at least, sounded like he could've been from Imagine Dragons, Bastille, etc. Modern pop rockish type bands with male vocalists. The song kind of had a sad, somber tone but this was a year ago and I was super sleepy so take that with a grain of salt.

The only actual part of the song I remember (to me, it seemed like more of a pop song- idk, could've been pop/rock or straight rock) is that the (chorus?) was really sad to me. The words, I mean. They sounded really hurt and sad. Except I remember I couldn't make out what he was saying exactly- just the melody. And even then I really don't know. I realize this isn't much to go on haha but I did a Vocaroo of the melody.

The words sounded, to me, like he was saying ""Tantaline koor"". I don't know why koor is with a K, that's just how I imagine it.

I'm pretty sure it wasn't a foreign song but again I don't remember. It was sung sort of like this

""Tann-ta-li-ine ko-orr""

And here's the Vocaroo of it. I sound bad, sorry.

That's pretty much all the information I have regrettably, I know that's not much to work with. Also worth noting is that the reason I don't remember the rest of the song is that I slept through some of it but not whole sleep- you know that weird place where it's like not sleeping but also not zoned out? Like somewhere in the middle but still really tired? Yeah it was that, that's why.

Pretty sure I didn't dream it but idk. Any help with this would be incredible and honestly any answer might satisfy me, it's not like I remember it too well. But god this is bugging me! Thanks.

I'm super paranoid for some reason, truthfully I don't know anymore, I guess because of the first time I was really depressed a while back. It was complicated and weird and is probably the main reason for it, but basically I worry about people killing themselves. At my worst I believed that to save the life of someone who didn't even exist, I had to tell them who I was so they could find me because we were meant for each other. Yeah yeah, I know. I'm not like that anymore. Still pretty depressed but thankfully...I don't even fucking know what all of that was so I'm not going to try and say I do.

Point is I worry about the tiny little things I do negatively affecting people, like my not doing something or saying something the wrong way will make someone I care about (or someone I just met- not that I don't care about strangers but point is it applies to everybody) commit suicide. The funny thing is it's never happened. Yeah I know people who deal with shit and maybe they're kind of depressed and fucked up in some way or another but none of them have ever done anything like that because of something I've done. Maybe I've fucked up our relationships a little, I don't know, but they haven't taken their own lives. Or self harmed. Or anything like that.

The funny thing was I was thinking about whether I should vent on here because truthfully I don't know if I even need to but I guess I do, and I didn't want to because....just fucking honestly I'm in depression limbo right now. What's the term for it when it comes and goes and shit and I have some triggers and other people make it better? All that shit, I don't know. But yeah I just feel okay sometimes and then not other times and I'm so fucking heavily influenced by everything that I don't really know anymore. But of course I'm afraid to say I don't know because I hate not knowing...sorry I'm rambling.

I didn't want to post this because I was afraid it would make it all worse. Take me out of limbo and make me feel like shit, which I guess I'm confused as to whether I want to feel like shit.

Funny thing is when I decided I wouldn't post this I had that same paranoia about other people about me. In all the time I've been like this nobody has ever done anything I've thought they would. I've run over to friend's houses and sent about a few hundred texts in a row over a period of I think probably weeks because that's how fucking paranoid I am. Every single one sent because I thought it would save their lives. I just want people to be happy and okay. That is the greatest feeling in the world to me.

And the fear doesn't mean shit. I guess my brain doesn't know that I'm not SUPPOSED to be able to tell that kind of shit. I'm just supposed to go along not knowing and feeling justified with my life, right? That's what some of the posts about people who've lost someone say on reddit. Because this website is SUCH a good reflection of humanity, yeah, and the way I should live. They had no idea it was happening, they just acted normal, THEY DIDN'T WORRY. BUT THAT'S NOT A BAD THING BECAUSE THEY'RE NORMAL. UNLIKE ME. AND NOW WHAT?! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?! SIT BACK AND LET LIFE TAKE IT'S FUCKING COURSE?! I CARE ABOUT PEOPLE AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS SHIT TO THEM, I WANT TO DO WHAT I CAN, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS? I CAN'T FUCKING TELL ANYTHING, I CAN'T TELL WHAT ANYTHING MEANS SOCIALLY SO NATURALLY I ASSUME EVERYTHING IS BAD IF IT ISN'T NORMAL. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT NORMAL IS. MAYBE THAT'S MY PROBLEM. Or maybe I don't know anything. Yeah, maybe I should go back to the first time I was depressed. Silence is the only answer. Except it's not. There is no answer. Only a void. Only...huh, I'm scared of saying it. IT. MOTHERFUCKER, LOOK AT YOUR SELF. YOU DON'T...I

i dont. fucking know anymore. I'm sorry everyone.

I was afraid of posting this because I was afraid that maybe I'll eventually seriously consider suicide and then I won't have anything to look at, my thoughts will take over. I'll end it because I didn't post this and nobody responded saying they cared because I never reached out. I guess I need help. I'm seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist or somebody soon I think. Maybe that'll work. I feel so goddamn shitty. Like I'm never really depressed because I'm in denial and then like now it all comes crashing down and I feel so...heavy...it's a heavy feeling.

**Sorry. I don't want to post this because I'm afraid- I can't tell if it's paranoia. That it'll hurt someone, trigger someone. I feel terrible about doing this so I'll put a spoiler or something, I don't know what the right thing to do is anymore. I'm genuinely, seriously- and it's not just because I'm paranoid- sorry if I've managed to do that with this. I guess I needed to vent but still I'm sorry. Being afraid doesn't make me care about people, I do that. I know I care. I would without it. So I'm really sorry if this hurts anyone or something. I don't really know myself.

Currently what I'm donig but I didn't think it would be a bad thing since here in a bit I'm gonna jump in a hot shower to clean off. I've read that either cold or hot will help the cuts and since I prefer hot, you know. But yeah they haven't been touching anything besides air, I've just been sitting out here for maybe two hours doing it every so often. 

The blood isn't massive as I don't cut as deep as some but still it's dark and is either around some of the cuts, out in drops along parts of the cuts, or just seeping from one part. Either way it stopped by itself after a few minutes, I didn't do anything. Should I? Like stem the bloodflow or clean it as soon as I cut? I didn't go as deep last time but I still just waited before just taking a shower and it seemed fine. Those healed after I just used bactine and didn't cut for a while. 

So yeah sorry for the long thing, TLDR do I need to clean cuts immediately? And is it okay to just let the blood flow/dry and wait a while before getting in the shower? If I wasn't getting in the shower I wouldn't be doing it now so that's why. Just...yeah. Is this okay?

The view of the window  
Corrupting to a fault  
Black bags under bad eyes  
I haven’t slept in months  
It’s all my fault  
  
I’m creating a memory  
Something to last me through the years  
Something to last forever  
I haven’t spoken in months  
And I’ve been away for years  
  
Reaching away to places unreached  
The only one who can breach the surface is me  
Stark bare, reflecting  
My hand dips into the water  
But the river runs deep  
  
I knew I was old and thrown away  
Never thought I’d have another reason to stay  
I’m looking out for a warm sadness in my head  
The one thing I’ll always regret  
I’ve been wishing some days that I was dead  
Reaching away to places unreached  
It runs deeper than you think  
  
I knew I was old and thrown away  
Never thought I’d have another reason to stay  
I’m looking out for a warm sadness in my head  
One more thing that I’ll regret  
  
In a room unknown  
I haven’t been listening  
Sore skin over fresh wounds  
I don’t think I’ve left for days  
I wasn’t listening  
  
I’m making the best of things  
But there’s not much to go on  
There’s nothing more to see  
I don’t think I’ve thought in days  
And I’ve been finished for weeks  
  
I’ve been pushed away again and again to places far  
I’m the only one who can throw a punch when I’m in this deep  
My hands dip into the water  
My hand rips past the string  
  
And I’d rather have it bite me in the back  
Than make myself fight back  
I’m the only one I know who can stand  
For hours on end and pretend that he’s sleeping  
And I know you’re brooding about what I think I’m doing  
Is the right thing while I’m breathing

Cause the feeling’s always that fleeting

This is basically what I'm feeling now. The whole story is pages long so here's the sorta short version I guess. I wrote this to send to my friend who I used to date. We don't date anymore because she's confused about her sexuality and isn't ready for a relationship, but we still talk. We more or less reconciled things yesterday, by which I mean I stopped texting her like a madman. Basically it took me months (of me texting her nonstop due to the way my brain works, I wasn't trying to be an ass, I really thought I should text every few hours or so to...look it's a long story but she's been incredibly patient and I'm really grateful, although in her eyes she doesn't think she's done anything to help me so I shouldn't thank her) to actually say what I meant to say and I'm not even sure she read it. That, or she just doesn't want to talk about it. Not like I'd blame her. And I didn't even tell her the big thing. The big thing that my depression was about my existence as a whole and feeling so alone that I literally invented characters in my head who I became obsessed with ""saving""- I had to scream at windows every few minutes and do a bunch of ocd ""my brain tells me to"" crap so that the character, a girl who I thought was my true love (yes, I know that's obviously bullshit in a really high degree and honestly this was like the beginning of this fucking year. I'm fucking 15. I guess I never really grew up) I had to say all of this to ""save"" her. If I didn't she'd die. Now I'm starting to wonder if I only did any of that, that and the intrusive thoughts about sex and violence that I banged my head against walls to get out, just so my life would have some meaning. I don't know.

That's why when I met her I felt like I could finally be free. She enabled to me to not be depressed anymore, as much as I hate to say this it feels like she gave me a reason to care, to not be the way I was. I just talked to her and suddenly everything was gone, I felt like I could force it all out of my head and I felt normal for once. Every since we broke up and before (basically, because of my depression I'm super paranoid and I thought she was going to commit suicide because of every single thing I said because I thought I was doing something wrong, now I'm kinda rid of the fear but honestly at this point it's hard to tell) I'd been texting her a bunch because of that. She always told me not to worry and that she'd always be here for me and I never listened. My brain was stronger than her words. I hate myself for ever fucking typing that sentence.

When the earth first shook  
The sun came with the cold of stone  
Seas slow and churning  
Nightmares above and below  
  
It came to them in a dream of yearning  
A savior needed to lead them  
They flocked to the temples of the ancient city  
Before coming upon a large statue  
Learning the code to unlock it’s gaze  
It said  
  
Deliver your souls  
Unto this pedestal  
To be woven into his own  
His own  
His own  
  
So they did in single file  
Until every pilgrim had been cleansed in the fountain  
And the earth shook once more  
Faith put on trial  
  
Collapsing in on the core  
The continents drifted towards the center  
Quakes destroying all they had created  
So they fell into the sea  
Doors to pleas unheard  
  
And when they finally realized  
They had sacrificed everything for nothing  
Traded their lives  
For a god who cared only for destruction  
The seas drained all with the code now forgotten  
Until the water enveloped  
All that was and would be  
And it said  
  
Deliver these souls  
Unto my pedestal  
To be woven into my own  
To be woven into my own  
My own  
My own  
  
And thus baptized, the god was satisfied  
And collapsed the statue, resting underwater  
Parasites forming new sinners  
  
Swallowed by the sea  
Hands reaching to any  
Who offer their lives  
For an ending

There he found the last remaining photograph. He spoke to his companion, the lesser god.

""What do you make of this?"" He asked, holding up the photograph.

His companion gave the greater god an inquisitive look. ""Make of it? It's just another picture.""

""Yes, but who is she?"" The greater pointed to the woman to the left of the man. ""She isn't anyone I've seen before.""

The lesser god gave him another curious look, then his face twisted into an uncomfortable expression of surprise. ""...I haven't either.""

The two gods surveyed the ruins of the house on the hill, their perfect minds reconstructing, once more, the house as it would have been before it fell. The pictures, the posters, the paintings...

And they stared in shock. 

It had changed.

The door, the walls, the paint, the couch, the television, the flooring...it was different. The pictures on the mantel and the posters in the upstairs room and the paintings lining the corridors had all changed. In all the photographs, next to the man, there was a new woman, and they were both smiling. It was dark outside but they were illuminated...

So the gods stood there taking it in, and once more checked the picture. The woman had not changed. The house had not changed. Nothing was changing...they were accelerating time using their perfect minds but nothing, nothing was changing. So they allowed the present state of decay to overtake the memory and stood in the center of the ruins, quietly, for a long time.

After realizing they had failed, the greater god spoke once more.

""Time to go.""

His companion nodded slightly and they finally embarked down the hill, leaving the photograph and the ruins behind.

Nearing the bottom of the hill, the lesser god looked back at the remains of the

The greater god came to a stop beside him. ""What do you mean, why?""

The lesser god tensed, turning. After a moment he shot around, yelling.

""WHY DID HE HAVE TO....?!"" He screamed, spitting. ""ALL IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN WAS ONE LAST PUSH, ONE LAST BIT OF FORWARD MOMENTUM, AND...!"" He smashed his hands together and his voice crashed through the world, shaking the foundation. ""WHY DID....WHY DID...WHY?.....Whh...wh-...."" He trailed off, slumping down to the ground, dejected.

Time passed immeasurably slowly as the black sun began to rise again on their world, somehow dimmer now. Years they could have stood there, but they did not. The greater god finally began walking once more, briefly stopping to help his companion. Along the way down the road, he paused, looking back too, the house now much more distant.

""I wouldn't know.""

It's only 50 seconds long and the guitar doesn't actually make up the whole theme, but I'm still not experienced enough with the harmonica to try matching the notes. Obviously it's not going to have the same twangy sound because it wouldn't be on guitar, or the same sound at all, obviously, but I'd like to get the same kind of bluesy tune if you know what I mean. I hope you know what I mean.

For reference, own a Hohner Pocket Pal from when I was younger and a Hohner Bluesband I got this year- not very high tier harmonicas but they work well for an amateur like me. The Pocket Pal is in a higher key, I don't remember what exactly.

I'm going to work on it for a bit now, see if I can do anything.

Any help would be appreciated, and I'd appreciate it if the tabs would be easy to read. Y'know, blow on this one, draw on this one kind of stuff. Again I'm not experienced.

Relapsed. Again. 19 days this time, almost met my 20 day record. I broke. I couldn't take it. The entire time I was debating with myself and fighting with my thoughts. You know what's interesting?

I realized while I was doing it that all I was really looking at was physical pleasure. Fictional physical pleasure, at that. You know what's even more interesting?

I have a girlfriend.

An honest-to-god fucking girlfriend. She's the greatest person I've ever met and even though she's very young (I'm only a year older than her, relax), maybe one day, as disgusting as she and many people would probably find the thought to be, we could do it. But before that, we'd have to hold hands and kiss. Haven't done either yet.

I'm going to ask her out again here in a few minutes, I think. Or maybe I'll wait and see if she'll ask me. Either way, I'm going to go somewhere with her and it's going to be the best date we've ever had.

You know how I met her?

I walked up to her and said hi. She likes me. I like her. There's no reason for what I'm doing. And to prove it to myself, I cut myself today. Only self-harm I've ever attempted (and the only one I ever will), and I still failed, heh. I'm not depressed anymore, but I wanted to have something to look at whenever I get the urge.

Not that I'd recommend doing it. I mean, it's like the size of a cut you'd get shaving. And on my shoulder. I don't like pain. I'm the only one who's ever going to see it, but at least it'll be there as a reminder. And so will she.

I've wasted enough years. Don't bother upvoting, I just had to say this. Thank you to everyone at this subreddit, although it's important to remember that a bunch of people on the internet ultimately have no power over you and your decisions. Only you do. Control yourself. Fight back. 

Like I will. You know what I'm going to do?

I'm going to do my best.

Bonfire(?), I don't wanna give it up

Rambling version:

I saw this about a year ago. It was on a commercial for backpacks, I think. I don't quite remember the brand. Sierra, maybe. Or hell, my memory keeps telling me that some kinda brand of bottled water was involved. Point is, I was watching a youtube video and the trailer was for backpacks or water or something (It definitely had one of those ""get out and do something, drink this, buy this, and go explore and live a little"" vibes to it- the slogan could've been something like ""get out there"", but again I don't remember.)

Anyway, I only remember the end of the commercial. After the slogan and the advertising is over, there's a quick clip of some guy on a stage singing something in front of a big crowd. It was definitely outdoors, but I don't know if it was rural or urban. The crowd is yelling and doing what most people do at a concert. Then I heard (maybe I just misheard it, I dunno) the singer say this. His voice was kinda scratchy. Think scratchy like in the song Bad to the Bone.

""Bonfire"" or something like that

*As a note, I only know for a fact that I heard the first line. The rest could have come from some other memory I had around then and I could've fused them together.*

So yeah. I did a google search for the lyrics and asked a friend. Neither came up with anything except the song Bad to the Bone (which I would guess is because of the bone part of the first line). That song doesn't have these lyrics in it.

I'm interested in this because I'm an amateur songwriter and if these lyrics haven't been used already I might as well work them in. I like the way they sound.

Thanks.
