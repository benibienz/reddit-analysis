I know that sometimes these things get stuck and can even arrive months late. So far, according to the tracking# the package has been @Miami's sorting facility for over a month which is rather odd and that's why I've initiated a dispute with them.

6,"Hey, thanks for all this info! I really appreciate it!

I've been ordering from US for about a year or more (same goes for shipping to US but no as many shipments at all). I've never lost a package so far and all of them had arrived extremely fast, so it feels bad to find out that sellers don't like our postal service -yet I totally get it since it means bad for business-. For me, it has been great so far and the prices are also great (registered costs $4 while it's $13+ in the US).

Apart from that, about that internal number that you talked about. I know how it works, yet for my orders so far Greek Post has been updating the tracking info from the moment they entered Greece and until they arrived at my house. I wanted to find more about it so I went to my local post and they informed me that they treat it like a Registered mail (I also had them search for this order and they told me that the package hadn't even entered Greece). I hope this info is right and the lady at the Post Office didn't give me a wrong answer - however I still have my last order's tracking# somewhere and I can prove what I'm saying. (seller has probably find out himself too) 

Lastly, I don't want to be a d*ck and screw the shop. I've already started a dispute @Paypal as it has already been well over 5 weeks since my order and from my conversations with the shop's support I didn't see it going anywhere. I know that the package might arrive some time in the future and if that's the case, I will contact the shop to either return the cards or the money. However last time I heard about the item from their support they told me that it was at Miami's customs getting investigated and that they would have someone from the staff reach out to USPS there and get more info about it, I had no update from them since...

Thanks for that wall of information. It's really helpful to know all that and I'll surely pm you if I ever need anything regarding this case or anything concerning tcgs - you seem to be really pro with it!",2016-10-05 05:57:49+00:00,d8ep2me,2.0,t1_d8eban9,20378,legaladvice

11,"There were other shipping options like Fedex (that would reach over $50-60), I chose USPS First Class Intl' not only because it was cheaper (~$7-10) but because I've never had a problem with it (been buying for over a year cards from the US and never lost anything). When choosing a shipping option there was this note:
""* USPS packages are not insured, trackable, or guaranteed.""
However, I was provided with a tracking# with this like my previous orders when they were shipped and iirc my last mail had a price on it (although it wasn't correspoding to the actual price of the cards in it &lt; I didn't ask for this though) that I don't know if it was to insure it or not.

Regarding their CoU, I wasn't aware of or agreed with them at any point (during signing up there was no check box but just a small text saying ""Read about our Privacy Policy and Conditions of Use""). 
Before making this order and since it was going to include cards for my friends too I tried to read about my rights in the case that the shipment got lost/damaged so that my friends would be covered and I wouldn't be responsible for it. I even googled to search if there were previous cases with this shop and see how they got handled.

I just don't believe that the theory of ditto being transformed into another pokemon and we have to reveal it somehow is possible. Based on the pokedex entry, posted by someone in this post, when Ditto is in its pokeball it gets back to its normal form. 
If Niantic followed its Pokedex entry someone would have caught a Ditto by now and even if he didn't realise it at first he would have noticed it being in his Bag after a while.",2016-07-26 09:03:02+00:00,d5r92j2,3.0,t1_d5r8332,3232,pokemongo
27,"For some reason I think we are approaching this the wrong way. 

I don't think that Ditto will be transformed as another random Pokemon because it should get back to its random form once we caught it (since it is inside a Pokeball it has to be in its Normal form). For the same reason I don't believe that we have to Lv.Up or Evolve a certain nicknamed Pokemon.

I think the way to catch Ditto will be by triggering it, just like we triggered the Eeveelutions by chaning their names BEFORE they evolve. Also I feel like this one will probably have to do with nicknames as well.
My current theory is that to get Ditto appear on the map and battle it we have to give a certain nickname to a certain pokemon (or ""pokemon-s"") and pop an incense (maybe a lure too, but since this has to be triggered by a single player I'm leaning towards incenses). Then you just wait or go for a walk.
Alternatively, you just nickname a certain pokemon in your bag and go for walks without poping anything.

Right now I'm testing the Incense theory, but I only have 2 incenses and not enough starters to name Ditto/Duplica. I'll give you updates once I've tested it.

I know that I might be completely wrong on this one, but I love this theorycrafting and wanted to contribute with my thoughts.",2016-07-26 07:58:47+00:00,d5r7vzl,1.0,t3_4ui3is,74155,pokemongo

I don't think it's wise to play with shaymin + octillery. You usually run 2 shaymins (maybe 3 for even faster set up) or 2 octilleries/2 remoraids. If you go with both the way you're saying you're giving up 1 more card (1shaymin/2octilleries/2remoraids), while 2 octillery lines do the job. (You also shouldn't go with just 1 octillery line for the same reason you write here:
&gt; there being only one there are bad draws where she's my only basic or worse, I go to look for her and find out she's in my prize cards.

Shaymin is much faster and more reliable than octillery so if you can save to buy one it'd be much better than buying 2 octillery lines for ~24$ (more than half of the money for a shaymin).

Personally talking it saves me from lots of troubles with my smurfs where I own less than 20 champs (most of them 450ip just to be able to play ranked) while I've played every champion for at least once (^^evenTeemo:[ ).
Now I can focus on buying some runes before going for more champions and without worrying that there might be an game where I'll have to play WW for some reason. Considering my main, I'm high plat and most people can play new champions without feeding hard (at least most of the time). 

However, it's a fact and I can see that in low elos, where people **just don't care**, this is going to be a problem for those who are actually trying to climb. Little Faker-wannabes playing Ori or Cass for the first time will be a pain in the ass.

Sure CSGO has trolls that will vote kick you or start spamming you, I've been vote kicked for tryharding-trying to speak on voice chat etc etc. The thing is I don't care, I don't feel like I waste my time or I am bound to play with people I don't like for 20+ mins.

Apart from that, if you wanna play Competitve, where you can't leave without a penalty, in really low elos you'll probably have to deal with a couple of crazy russians fcking with your nerves and mentality. On higher elos (gold nova 3+ which skill-wise means almost average) I find people most of the time really nice and even if we're losing it's not an anti-fun experience. 

The thing I hate with LoL is being stuck with a toxic team or player (even an afk) that you know eventually will cost you the game and having to play for 20mins while knowing that you can't do anything. That feeling of being imprisoned and powerless is the worst a player can get while trying to have fun imo and mutes or leaving won't help you either. ( **and I don't mean games that you can actually tryhard and carry the toxic madafakas).

However it's about 2 completely different games.

The problem is that when you record them (on op.gg or wherever else) it usually creates a file that allows you to replay them through the League Client using the spectator mode. That means that if the game you recorded is on an older Patch, most likely the client won't be able to support it (missing/replaced files etc..)

Perhaps 3rd party softwares like League Replay or something could download the older missing files for your client. From my experience though, you'll have to eat a lot of errors in your face and it might not be worthy your time (I never got it to work anyway). 

Right now I use OP.gg for recording and if I actually like a moment in the game I record it after I finish with Fraps (monitor recording software) to create a m4v or mp4 file that will last forever.

193,"Well, considering that he's an assasin his damage is fine. -Leblanc has the same damage in lane with the Q&gt;W combo (maxing W first), better mobility and easy juke potential/escapes- Ekko is fragile and like most assasin's can be destroyed with a good CC spell.

Regarding the laning phase:

His E is clearly a great gap closer to help him bully in lane, tha's why I'm advising you taking a champ with mobility (to avoid his jumps) like LB or CC+Burst like Cho/Viktor (as Viktor when you see him trying to go on you, just throw W and stay inside it). Those are really easy match ups and even if you are less skilled than him you can most often outdamage/beat him.

If however you take Ahri/Kog/Yasuo (just examples), sure, you'll need to outplay him most of the time, especially pre-6 or just keep playing really safe, farming and letting your team know when he's roaming / roam yourself too. 

Yet I can say for sure that a fed Ahri/Kog/Yasuo will be much more of a pain to deal with later in game (mostly in teamfights) than an equally fed Ekko. ",2015-09-03 16:52:08+00:00,cupf3ze,3.0,t1_cupdjng,2401,leagueoflegends
194,"I've been playing ekko mid (jungle and top too, but mainly mid) A LOT lately. His damage is surely not low, but he can get countered and has some weak points. I don't think that he needs more nerfs currently.

I surelly can give you some advise on how not to lose to him.

1) First of all, you can trade damage with Ekko but keep in mind that an Ahri or a Yasuo (without his statik) won't do the same damage a LeBlanc or Fizz will do. Ekko is infact fragile in mid and unless he hits you all the time with his W you can trade with him too. 

2) You can take exhaust or barrier if you decide to go with a match up vs him that you're not sure about. Those two spells can save you early when he might be able to deal more damage than you, until you've reached to the point you can answer back.

3)Some really easy picks to go vs him are:
- Cho: his silence just fcks him up early and late game since he can't R back.

- Fizz: just max W and start trading with him after you hit 3lv. You also have your E to avoid his E or R.

- LeBlanc: can start trading from lv.2 and you have nice mobility.

- Viktor: you have the utility and damage to force him to go B really often if he's not cautious.

4) Also champions that can stun him in mid/late game tfs can wreck his combos.

5) His W is really (really really) good for setting up ganks or giving his team time in tfs to proper focus or clear (2,25 secs stun!), however it's pretty easy to bait or predict it. Avoid getting hit by it and you take away from him the ability to go ham on you, zhonyas&gt;R or just R.

6) Care for the hologram. Late game it's his main source of damage (mid/top ekko), unless he comes across some squishy guy with small mobility going solo and has Lich Bane. (He's an assasin after all).",2015-09-03 15:00:34+00:00,cupartk,1.0,t3_3jhqrl,1479,leagueoflegends
195,"I have to ban them too and it's not because I don't like to play against them but due to the fact that most of the guys I've been playing with seem to not know their power. 

I'm not low elo (Plat), but my smurf currenlty is. I've lost a couple of games there where I could do nothing to save the game no matter how fed I was or if stomped those champs early so that they don't matter later.

For me right now Darius (fck this guy and black cleaver) seems really overpowered.  I've had problems with him in both my accounts. 

Hell, I even got stomped by a Darius in lane when I tried to 1v1 him as Nasus with ~100 stacks after my first recall, when I had almost my Frozen Heart completed and he hadn't backed yet. He had ~1/2 HP while I was full, no ignite and just a pot. After that, even when my jungler tried to help we gave him a double kill and didn't even deal more than 40-50% (after he healed to like full with just a Q) of his HP.
Sad thing is that he wasn't really skilled with the champion but just built the right items.

Garen gets to do a lot of damage while building tank, especially with those new items. He's laning phase can get countered. I can't say that I had fun playing vs him in late game for sure though.

Skarner can be countered easy with a qss or mikaels and by avoiding 1v1s or fights near his crystals. In low elo he's a god as people seem to forget those things. He seems a bit overpowered but I think that I've just lost once to him, it just needs proper focus and items.


Morde can become really strong (enough to 1hit some fragile ADC or midlaner, I've seen that happening in one of my games) but you can make his laning phase hard. I've had no problem with him ever.",2015-09-03 14:32:33+00:00,cup9qtp,1.0,t3_3jhcwh,6617,leagueoflegends

I didn't see a sorry post (fake or not) on any of his Social media for what he did to his team. Of course it was his choice but he probably costed Gambit a place at play offs. Riot gave him 4 games ban (wow!), something that perhaps he didn't even, care considering he didn't show remorse at all. Also not to forget that he was fined in 2014 for the same thing. (And, I'll quote a part from League Pedia just to show the severity of his latest doings: **Was banned for four games because in thirty days he was reported in 70% of his games and with 92% of reports received for verbal abuse.**)

And that alone shows that toxicity, no matter in what play (pro or soloQ), gets unpunished (or punished by little). Such a great message to pass on normal SoloQ players while on the same time trying to find ways to reduce toxicity.

Right now the HUD offers so much info right where the map is (CS, KDA, Score) and since the items were moved to the left (oh well, here we go again with the whole adapt-thing) I tried to move the map to the left and although I  like it better that way there are some things that just make it SO difficult to get used to:


**1)** It was so USEFUL seeing your **CS next to the game timer**. Right now (with the map on the left) I have to move my eyes across the whole screen to find how my farm is going.

* **SUGGESTION** : Move the CS/KDA back where it was **OR** Switch places between the Team Score and Game Timer. I hate having to see my Team's Score everytime I check the map anyway, #just_elohell_things




**2)** When having the map on the left corner my champion stats move to the right. I don't know if it's due to my screen being 15,6'' but I think it's going to be so painful having to adjust with the Items+Stats info being shown on the right now. It seems like too much and too imprtant stuff are shown on the side I tend to notice less. #leftside_racism_?

* **SUGGESTION** : Make your champion icon a bit smaller so that stats can be shown on the left no matter where the map is (?) **OR** Make the Stats being shown in a more vertical way so they can fit between the Map and the my champion icon.





**3)** My abilities when getting of CDs for a brief moment have a blue overlay animation that makes me think that I can't use them. 

* **SUGGESTION** : Make abilities have that blue-overlay animations the last 1-2 Seconds while they are getting off CD **OR**  No overlay and animations at all when abilities get of CD. I don't find it as something that one can adjust to anyways, *sometimes you just forget*...






**Overall** I like how Riot is spending time making/adjusting the game to never look outdated. The new HUD has potential but needs some fixes first. I've been reading comments from fellow Summoners for the last 20hrs or so on how this new HUD is bad with all the info being desplayed in one place and other things that make it impossible to adjust. 
I agree with the fact that adapting to it can be and will be really hard for lots of people (that's why it needs some adjustments), **but** the new HUD doesn't suck, it's proof that Riot is trying and wants to offer a classy MOBA to its audience.

* **FINAL SUGGESTION**: Make it so that there is an option in the menu where we can Toggle between the Old and New HUD, just like the SR music, perhaps update the Old HUD's patterns and Outlines to be like the new one's.
If Rito you don't want this for some reason then please take into account the community's voice and try adjust the HUD so that we won't have any problems staying with it.

237,"From my point of vue an assasin's job is to try and kill one (or both if you're fed) of the enemy's carries. 
With that said Ekko is fine with 1v1s, he can use Zhonyas+Ult combo and hit his enemy, in tfs however it surely is more difficult to find the right target, not only to hit with your autos+passive but with your ult.  That's why in the teamfights you'll have to rely on your teamates too. 
I've made huge plays with a Bard once and with Seju another time. All you need is time for your hologram to be in the right place for you to ult. Heavy CC champs provide that kind of time like your W's stun too (2s duration if i'm correct!). [another combo you can do is wait for your teammate to stun, like a Bards-Seju-Ori's ult, then and throw your W, that way you are guarranted to hit something]
Ekko in terms of carrying drops in late game. He can deal huge damage but will need a good team to support him too.",2015-07-21 18:30:59+00:00,ctb5umj,10.0,t1_ctb379b,3773,leagueoflegends
238,"Somewhere I read that gamers can keep track of 6-7 moving objects while normal people usually can only keep track of 3-4. I've been playing games for over 8 years and yet, only when I read that (about 1 year ago) I started noticing it. What I'm saying is that with practise IT IS possible to train your eyes to notice or keep track of certain units in the game (in this case your hologram).

The best one I can come up is going lots of Aram games for a week. The reason is that there you teamfight like 24/7 and believe me, learning how to position and aim/focus in teamfights is key for the game (sadly in aram mode you can't decide your pick). By doing lots of teamfights firstly you will learn to keep track of certain units (perhaps the enemy carry or your carry) and secondly you will learn how to keep calm in such situations by going over and over (which is also key).

Another way is playing/trying a similar champion like Zed, where you need to know at every point of the game where you've left your shadow, what spells you can hit with it and if you are in range to teleport to it.  I played a lot of Zed in Season 3-4 (over 500 games) so when it came to Ekko I only had to learn what his hologram AOE was. Similar cases where you need to work/keep track of more than one unit for you champion to work: Annie with Tibers, Shaco with his Clone, Mordecaiser with the ghost from his ult (I believe that Zed is the best one out there though)",2015-07-21 14:42:12+00:00,ctawk19,8.0,t1_cta18z7,68849,leagueoflegends
239,"Yup, that's the main thing with Ekko's R, you need to be able to see/know where your hologram is and how big the AOE is. You can use R to escape or heal but its damage is insane [500 + 1.3AP at max lv.] so it would be a pitty not to use such a burst. It can almost 1HKO carries when used right but like almost everything else in League, it needs practise.",2015-07-20 19:07:40+00:00,cta08g7,6.0,t1_ct9nq35,19900,leagueoflegends

Thanks for the advice, is it possible for you to help me find the video you're talking about?",2015-07-20 13:05:47+00:00,ct9mxd0,4.0,t1_ct9m0m2,2357,leagueoflegends
241,"Liss is an awesome pick and scales great in mid to late game. She can farm well with her Passive, however you should first get familiar with her kinda low AD for lastihitting (50ish i think). Tips:

-Don't try to make plays if you're not sure that you will get the kill. 

-I like maxing Q first, then E and lastly W.

-As soon as you hit 6 ask for a gank, it's easy to even towerdive with your ult. If your jungler is busy, try waveclearing fast and then roaming. Your ult being off CD in early game most of the time means that you've got a free kill.

-In late game you can intiate with E, W, alt+R, Zhonyas. Or you can ult their one of their carries and use Zhonyas.

-Core Items: Morellos or Athenes (depending on how offensive the enemy midlaner is), Rabadon's, Zhonyas, Void Staff. You can also build ROA if your team isnt tanky enough, Luden's Echo for more dmg, Rylais for more utility.

-Lissandra can go top and win most of the matchups.

-Lissandra is the champion that can play safe early and even if she's finding difficulties in lane, use her R to get a kill (by roaming or jungler's help).",2015-07-20 12:53:02+00:00,ct9mmai,2.0,t1_ct9m6s9,1133,leagueoflegends
242,Have you considered playing something else than support or adc? For example I hate going bot because I have to depend to my ADC's or SUPP's skills too to win the lane. I main Mid (I can and I prefer Top/Jungle over bot too) and what I do is roaming a lot either bot or top. I would suggest you to do the same and so rengar is an awesome idea. I would advise you to try going top first and bringing teleport-flash. As soon as you get 6Lv. you can gank mid or bot and carry your teamates. Check some youtube videos of pros to get an idea with Rango before playing him and good luck.,2015-07-20 12:40:24+00:00,ct9mbr8,5.0,t1_ct9koya,5034,leagueoflegends
243,"Leona or Braum as support.

Oriana, Viktor, Azir, Cassiopeia, Varus, Ekko for Mid.

Malphite, Gnar, Lissandra, Rumble, Jarvar, Hecarim for Top.

Ashe, Graves, Tristana, Jinx, Sivir, Corki, Kog Maw, Varus for ADC.

You just need some ppl to able to combo after Seju's ult and some people to deal damage. Don't just go for a full-CC combo but take some champions for the Damage (like Azir). 
Also Righteous Glory is a must item in a team with Seju, Sivir's ult follows that logic too.

244,"I'm in the same situation. I'd suggest you to record your games and then to replay them trying to compare them to higher elo games so you can find your mistakes and correct your gameplay. 

Also know that:

-Not every game is winnable

-You can always dodge a game you think you have no chance of winning, losing 3 or 10LP is better than 20.

-You should stop playing for some hours or even a day when you're getting in a losing streak. Try relaxing and doing something different for a while. If you don't wanna stop playing you can make yourself a smurf account and play from there.

245,"1. If the enemy can see you, try to predict where he would go to avoid your W. However I prefer going on closest bushes when my enemy is trying to farm, throw my W on where he's at, wait 1s and then go on him. That way he can't see my W going off and he also has just a few miliseconds to react when he sees me.
2. Don't try to kill his turrets. You either go for the kill on him (don't try that unless you're fed or your jungler is with you) or just wait and farm. Even under turrets, Ekko can farm easily.

VS ad assasins wait until you have your Zhonyas, not for the armor but for the utility. Throw W, Go on them with E, Throw Q, if your W hitted keep auto-ing while they are stunned, use zhonyas to avoid their combos (talon's R+W, Zed's combo after he uses R or just the detonation of the mark). When you get out of zhonyas, your Hologram should be close to them so use R to heal and finish them with that op damage.",2015-07-20 12:01:14+00:00,ct9li0e,4.0,t1_ct9l7rv,897,leagueoflegends
246,"2) I've played Viktor A LOT lately and loved carrying games with him. Personally I always take E first so I can have it maxed asap, it hits really hard in teamfights if used right. Also I always try to B for the first time after I've got 1100+ gold (1000 for the E upgrade, remaining for pots/wards). You can however take Q first should you want to play safer. For example if you have to face an Ezreal you can take Q for the small shield that will be enough to save you some HP if he's spamming. Viktor's Q also helps with your last-hitting early, especially when you're under turret. P.S. Even if you take Q first, always have E maxed by lv.9
3) If you want to climb elo, you should be able to play every role. However, if you know that you suck in a certain lane (for me it's jungle) you can either ask in champion select kindly your teamates for a trade or take a very easy-safe champion for that role. I wouldn't suggest you to dodge every single time you end up in a role you don't like, you'll just waste LP and time. I WOULD suggest you to though if you can see that the chance of you winning is really low (your team's picks vs the enemy's).
4) Recently picked Azir up, so I can only point out the obvious, you need something that can poke him and has some cc or mobility such as Ezreal-Runeglaive, Varus, Ahri, Kog(sucks early, if you get caught you die).
5) You should try having 80CS/10mins (so it's 160 by 20mins and 240 by 30mins). If you wanna step it up try going 100cs/10mins. You can clear the Raptor camp or Wolves one if your jungler hasn't any problem with that.  You can just kill the small raptors too, that way you aren't denying much gold from him.
6) Viktor loses from big rage champions in lane. I hate going vs Kog, Varus, Orianna, Ezreal. 
Fizz (with his E) and Morgana (her shield is too stronk) is a good pick too for that case. As Viktor, you have to play really safe until 6+, try to farm as much as possible and only go ham on them if you know you can kill them with your full combo. I would also suggest you, since Viktor has great waveclear to give some love to your top or bot lane too.
7) Try watching compilations of famous players plays, like Bjegsen or Faker. (try watching Faker the movie or something)
9) Dodge. If you're sure that he's going to troll and destroy your game (you can check if he's in a losing streak at op.gg or lolking) losing 3LP or 10LP is always better than +,-20.
