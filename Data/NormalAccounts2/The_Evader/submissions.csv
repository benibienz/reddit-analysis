I have a Darkrai EX RA (Mint-NearMint, Break Point) if anyone would be interested in a trade.

I'm living in Greece, (for the US) the postage is $1.15 (First Class USPS Intl') for a plain white envelope that can hold up to 2 toploaders (so up to 4 cards if you put 2 in each toploader). For everywhere else sadly I don't know much about the shipping costs so you'll have to inform me!
I'm covering shipping and pp fees ofc!

Thanks a lot.

I know that my case probably isn't as serious as the ones I'm seeing in this subreddit's hot ones but I wanted to try my luck and maybe get an answer.

I live in Greece and over a month ago I made an online order from a shop placed in US that sells collector's cards that I've yet to receive.
Last week I contacted the shop's support and they told me that the package -that was sent with USPS First Class Int' and had a tracking#- was stuck at Miami's shorting facility (I could also see that using the tracking#). They also told me that they wouldn't be able to know how long it would take it to get through and that I should maybe give them another week. 
I wrote to them again two days ago and tried to ask for a refund as never before has it taken more than 2-3 weeks for a package/mail from the US (or this shop) to arrive, so it was probably lost. They told me that they aren't obliged to refund me since in their Conditions of Use they state this:

*""All product purchased from -shop's name- is made based on our contracts with our shippers. This means that the risk of loss and title pass to you when the product is accepted by the shipping carrier.""*

I haven't replied to them since and I'm in shock. The cards I've ordered costed over $150 and most of them were for my friends (we made a group order to save on shipping). I wasn't aware of the above line in their Conditions of Use, as I've only read their Privacy Policy. 

So here's my question:

I paid with Paypal, do I have the right to make a claim there and ask for a refund? If yes, how can I justify it?

Right now all I'm feeling is that I paid the shop for the cards and to have them delivered to me but the latter didn't happen. Sure, it was me who chose USPS First Class Intl' as the shipper but then again what if the shop made a mistake with the package and that's the reason it got stuck?

As I said, I've seen more serious cases in this subreddit's hot page that make this one seem stupid. However $165 are a great deal right now in Greece and since I made the order for my friends too I feel responsible for their loss (I'm going to lose money from this loss as well but I don't care about it as much). Can you help reddit?

Thanks in advance!

p.s. I tried not to reveal the shop's name because I'm not sure if it's against the rules or not. 


UPDATE (20/10/16): I started a dispute @ Paypal (I shared every conversations/emails with the shop's support) and escalated it to a claim (since we weren't reaching to something anyway). Paypal gave them ~2 weeks to respond -I don't know if they did, I didn't see any message from them in the dispute though- and after that they returned my money - no more questions asked! 

Happy ending overall and I want to thank everyone here for their help! Really helped me a lot with this!!!

Have an awesome day everyone!!",legaladvice,"Lost package from an online order, shop won't refund because of its CoU",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/55ssva/lost_package_from_an_online_order_shop_wont/

Everytime I try to play with a friend a casual game I can't see the radar (+the TAB one) at all. The only way to fix it is by exiting the game and sometimes I have to restart more than once... Also the HUD part that shows my nades/weapons seems misplaced...

Can anyone who had this problem before help me to fix it once and for all.

&gt; Expecting your ""toxic"" players to reform without giving them a mechanic to escape trolls and intentional feeders is a bit like asking an alcoholic to be sober while working as a bar tender.

&gt; **Being trapped, literally trapped, for 20 minutes with someone who is actively choosing to ruin the game is absolutely the most belittling, powerless, hopeless feeling you can have in this game. And for some mind-blowing reason, your company policy is to punish people who quit and/or type their frustrations. I can't for the life of me understand why you think this is smart.**

I want to comment on that and probably even go a bit further as I feel this is what made me give up playing this game.

**So, about me:** 

Last year I finished High School and I got in the best (in my country) university to study Economics. I've always loved League and since in the first 2 semesters I had just a few, really easy courses, I ended up with plenty of time to dedicate myself into this game, try to fix my mechanics and strategies and of course aim for a high elo. Sure, I was playing before all this, but I never wanted to see the game so ""professionally"". In less than one 6 months, I managed to hit Platinum and after that, help some of my friends achieve their dream elos by teaching them what I've learned through my grinding. Then I had to study for my 2nd semester's exams (which were a bit harder than the 1st's) and it was when I gave up a bit on the game for 2-3 weeks until I could be sure that I've passed all of my courses with good grades. After I came back I realised that I wasn't anymore as hyped as I was before. I started playing SoloQ again after a while, but I wasn't playing as I was before. I wasn't feeding, but I wasn't snowballing too and the thing is that I knew I could do better and carry many of the games I ended up losing, but something in me was different that time, like I didn't care. What I managed to do was drop my MMR, which was ~100-200 higher than my current League and after that I was scared of playing SoloQ again.  The experiences I've had in the elo-hell I've put myself in were scarying me. I was waiting for something to bring my lost hype back for months. Then I really got into watching LCS and I finally found what I was looking for. I got overly hyped with some epic matches and comebacks (or Reverse Sweeps) and after some warming up again I was ready to hit the Rift once again. 


I've started to learn even more mechanics. Reading guides online about different things helped me too. This time however, no matter how hard I tried, even If I could win and snowball my lane, in every 2 or 3 games I was put in a team, that aparently didn't want to win. I knew I was in an elo-hell but I also knew that I once carried myself out of there to hit Plat. I knew that it would be harder now because of the higher elo but I also knew that I could hit Dia if I put myself into it. I started not giving attention to the games that were simply just a waste of time, even though they weren't just a few. I've managed to hit my first promo series since a long time, but I lost them. I've got to lose the exact same series 5-7 times and that's when I got really tired. What got me tired wasn't that I was constantly losing my games but the thing that I was constantly losing my faith and everytime I was trying to hype myself once again so that I don't give up.


I've never flamed in my games for years, although I could be salty sometimes. Anyway, I've started to use the chat so I can help my teammates in those ""simply waste of time"" games so I could convince them that we wouldn't lose the game, that I could help them get some kills and catch back up and that helped me win quite many games. **But man, that thing was even more tiring than just losing your game. I wanted to just focus on my gameplay and I ended up trying to be the psychologist of some immature guy that was flaming his whole team for his own fails and was about to troll or afk.** I knew that I could just focus on me, mute everyone and don't care. But what happens when you see the ""An ally has be slayed"" on your screen every 30-70 seconds concerning the same person. Sure, I could snowball too and help in mid-late game, but would that be enough to stop an 10-0 Irelia (just for the meme) with 2 towers and 240CS @25 mins? I really wouldn't care for her if most of the time it didn't result in a her VS me to win the game.


I started losing my faith and not being able to bring it back. I was playing LoL for years and was in a position to see if a game could be won or not, even if my team was far behind. I was playing 5-8 hrs. a day (since I was on summer vacations) and had a ~55% winrate that was not enough. I didn't want to win every game I was put in, that would be stupid and useless since I learned more from losses than wins. What I've also learned is, when a game is surelly lost but you have to play without just going afk (for the enemy to finish or be able to FF) or typing your frustrations to your team (and not in a negative way) just because you are afraid of a being banned, that alone just puts you in the miserable spot McNerfBurger described in his comment. And no I'm not talking about giving up at the first 5mins of the game. 

Some will say: *Just mute everyone, accept your loss, play the game to the end and move on.* 

To that I answer: **Not really**.

Having the loss hanged to you (most of the times) by your teammates' gameplay and immaturity **more than 2 times in the same day** and having to bear it for HALF AN HOUR per one of these games without being able to at least close your PC, go grab a coffee or have a walk so that you can forget the frustration of having to lose when YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO is just rediculous. Those games apart from being uncarriables, as it's easier to lose a game on purpose than win it, they also fuck up with my dreams and hopes. When in real life someone approches me and starts talking shit to me, I just move away from him because I don't have to bear him, it's my RIGHT. I won't punch him, or talk shit back to him. I will just, right away, move away and move on. 


I love League, I really do. This game has helped me when I was sad to find some fun or when I was alone to find some company and friends to spend my time with. This game is really fun. This game is awesome, that's why I will never cry for the couple of houndreds of euros I invested in it during the last 3 years, yet  for now, I've given up trying to play and hard carry myself out of that hell. I didn't want to stop, but I had to. League was wasting my life giving nothing back in return. Some times I thought that I was just unlucky, hell, I've even made a smurf, just so that I won't give up after all those months of grinding and start with a clear MMR again, but I only managed to get it to 28lv. after ~2 months (without boosts since with the capital controls in Greece I couldn't get the RP I needed). 

For now, one of my friends a while back introduced me to CS which for me, after grinding for ~100hrs seems good enough to spend my spare time, now that my 3rd Semester starts. It's not as fun as League but it does the work without putting me in situations I don't enjoy being in. I'll probably keep playing League casually, once every other day or so, until I find my hopes again if I ever do. I'll probably keep being in touch with the reddit community especially now with Worlds being around the corner!



**Lastly**, what am I suggesting here?

 Nothing really, this isn't a suggestion post after all. I know that most of the things I'm talking about are really hard to deal with.

**ALSO** I'm not saying that I'm not happy with ""Lyte's System"". I think that in most parts it really works, keeping league clear of really toxic INDIVIDUALS.

**Edit: TLDR** League is a really fun and awesome game. However, sometimes if you get unlucky and your IRL problems affect your gameplay resulting in you droppping yourself on the ladder, most of those times it will be really psychologicaly tiring to bring yourself back on the point you were and although the current system works really well eliminating toxic individuals from the community, at the same time it puts you in the spot of having to deal with them in your games and accepting your losses due to them quite often if you're a really dedicated player. Even if you try to not pay attention to those games (some times being a few, sometimes being a big series of wasted time), they have negative effects on your gameplay and psychology making you not enjoying the game. Also read the quoted comment at the beginning of this post.


**P.S.** I think Irelia is in a quite good spot, even if I've only played her 3-5 times. Don't nerf her.
