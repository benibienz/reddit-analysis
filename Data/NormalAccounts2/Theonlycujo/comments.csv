Use to be the classic 319 light player during the taken king, but was behind when RoI came out. Looking for help with trials although Im underlighted. I just wanna get the gear so I can work my way back to the top.",2016-10-15 21:03:32+00:00,d8thutm,1,t3_57late,43209,CrucibleSherpa

6,"All this means is IF it impacts our deck, then we switch to the blue affinity list that runs bigger creatures and cards like stubborn denial/spell pierce in the main.

11,"Really? I tend to enjoy the burn matchup. I never let the great revel stay for long and usually our clock is faster. Also, thoughtcast doesn't get hit by him, so it ends up letting me dig farther for a galv blast",2015-08-10 11:54:04+00:00,ctxuv7r,2,t1_ctxqr37,16278,AffinityForArtifacts

14,"As an affinity player, I agree about disregarding Ensoul and Blade. When the meta becomes less about removal then I can completely support it, but having recently played a similar list, I can confirm that success is short.

Master of Etherium, however, has been putting up amazing results. He has made the delver matchup (a hard match for affinity) and Grixis in general much better.",2015-08-07 12:25:47+00:00,ctuped9,1,t3_3g3dsy,28495,ModernMagic

17,"For me, I enjoy ancient grudge and thoughtsieze more than any other cards against tron. Champs and blast also come out for me, but I personally do not enjoy boarding in blood moon. Stubborn denial isn't bad since it can stop turn 3 Karn (Best. Feeling. Ever.) and then once I know Karn is clear I use my mainlands to attack since O stone can't touch them. My gameplan post board is to clear out a Karn or get a spellskite in play, then make them answer my blinkmoth, or even better, my inkmoth.

Hope this is helpful!",2015-08-05 18:20:56+00:00,ctsl7nc,3,t1_ctsjki8,2235,AffinityForArtifacts

21,"Sometimes twin does just have the better hand, but I'm a huge fan of galv blast and i usually run 4 problematic cards for any twin deck in my main at any given time (some mix of spellskite and galv blasts with thoughtcasts to help me dig). Combo is a little awkward for our matchups but they aren't unwinnable. Also remember Grixis twin and Tarmo twin do a lot more damage to themselves, so don't be afraid to animate man lands early to do more damage. UR twin is awkward but I usually 2-1 it with proper responses and maintaining solid pressure on the board",2015-08-03 15:23:16+00:00,ctpyhkk,2,t1_ctpuqgy,7174,AffinityForArtifacts
22,"One thing that I can say about infect is galv blast.  Chump blockers also do serious work, especially inkmoth nexus. I really enjoy overseer/Etherium setup and post board counter magic it amazing too. Also not many people think about boarding ancient grudge against them, but it hits spellskite and inkmoth nexus, so I love it. Wild defiance can cause issues, so I usually use a thoughtsieze when I can to pull it out (I personally don't like running enchantment hate but I'm not opposed to it). Removing their creatures at sorcery speed is the best advice I can give and they NEED to answer spellskite. I've heard some people have has success in other decks using a blood moon but I'm not sure how that would go with us.

I've answered the other matchups above if you would like to hear my 2 cents on that",2015-08-03 15:17:10+00:00,ctpy9hb,2,t1_ctpt3km,11230,AffinityForArtifacts
23,"I personally haven't tried it yet in competitive play, but I do enjoy it against delver and delve oriented decks when I play test. I still use thoughtcast since in some matchups I like the two card advantage but I don't think days undoing is a bad card either. I can definitely respect affinity players using it.",2015-08-03 15:08:52+00:00,ctpxyv4,4,t1_ctpxgxw,868,AffinityForArtifacts
24,"With Grixis, if K command mana isn't up I usually assume one of two things: something will be countered, or something will be killed. Knowing that, I can put them in a tough situation. I can ether play my plating on first main to save my overseer from a potential bolt or playing it on my second main so it might not get countered. Between that, Thoughtcast/Undoing if you go that route, and master of Etherium, I tend to have a slight advantage against them",2015-08-03 14:02:41+00:00,ctpvtpl,2,t1_ctpf7i8,46414,AffinityForArtifacts
25,"With control, overextending is a huge issue, and most people forget about wrath effects and get demolished by that. Control will try to go 1 for 1 in the early game, so multiple threats/ multiple ways of attack are an issue to them.

As for burn, I love that matchup. Vault skirge is the unsung hero here, and on top of that an etched champion/overseer/master of Etherium present a huge problem for them. I usually like to have fun with goblin guide triggers and love when they help me dig deeper into my deck. Also spellskite really trashes them",2015-08-03 13:53:20+00:00,ctpvjw5,2,t1_ctpjx4e,36516,AffinityForArtifacts
26,"I actually really enjoy the Jund matchup. Jund and other BG/X decks want to go 1 for 1 at least, which is why they need bob/K command/rhino to kind of give a 2-for-1 feel. I usually find infect kills in my Junk matchup to work and thoughtcast (even days undoing) is really good with Jund since it is essentially two bob triggers without life loss. That said, Bob can't stay and needs to get galv blasted asap or they just get more attrition.",2015-08-03 13:47:50+00:00,ctpve4u,2,t1_ctpbf8u,53019,AffinityForArtifacts
27,"I play affinity too, and I can say that this matchup is awkward, but with confidence, it's slightly in your favor. I usually find my [[Inkmoth Nexus]] doing a large portion of my work and I usually aggressively mulligan my hand in G2 and G3 if it doesn't 1) have blood moon (I run 2 in my 75) or 2) look super fast. Also if you haven't tried some number of [[Spellskite]] in the 60, I can confirm I've won games cuz of him.",2015-07-07 12:42:21+00:00,csuwc2g,1,t3_3ce9qa,23940,ModernMagic
