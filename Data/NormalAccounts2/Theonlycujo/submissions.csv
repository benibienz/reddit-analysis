I instantly wanted to play Daretti since 1) I rarely get to play with planeswalkers and 2) I have a lot of OP artifacts. Normally I'd look this up on my own but my brain is absolutely fried right now and wanted to hear some other opinions. I mainly need advice on loot cards and red cards that work well with artifacts.
