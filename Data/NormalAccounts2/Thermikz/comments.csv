Again everything up there is just my opinion.  
CoD4-Ghosts: ~1.00 KD &amp; negative W/L  
AW-BO3: ~2.00 KD &amp; Postive W/L  
  
Big part of that to me is mastery of the maneuvering system. As long as I'm up and above people's FOV I am guaranteed to win that gun fight. New Map design has been questionable since it funnels players to each other, making it easier to pop off. Maybe at its core the new era of cod the skill ceiling is higher, but with every thing added in all it does is promote the newer player and ease them into the process.

Unless MWR is sold separately and it makes a ton of money I don't see there being anymore remasters unless it is paired with another AAA title. The reason I have only the MW series on there is because I believe the titles that become *backwards compatible* won't get remastered which is basically all of Treyarch titles (and I think BO2 is coming soon).  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But in all Honesty, I believe this is the best route ATVI takes for its release schedule:  
  
**2017**: Sledgehammer / *Vietnam Era* 
  
**2018**: Treyarch / *Something in the never ending BO universe*
  
**2019**: Infinity Ward / *Infinite Warfare 2*   
  
**2020**: Raven / *After a year of supporting MWR, this will give Raven three full years to develop the Modern Era CoD they said they would like to develop if they were brought on as a 4th lead dev.*   
  
**2021**: SledgeHammer / *TBD*

So let's say AW2 does come out, Infinity Ward has already come out saying they want IW to be a trilogy. I just can't see ATVI keeping this trend of future shooters. They started this future advanced movement trend with SHG and AW and  I believe they'll start a new BOTG trend again With SHG and CoD2017.

41,"I agree. I don't see myself playing this game for 12 months and I suffered the same thing with BO3/AW. I was estatic and relieved when MWR was announced  because I would have now something to do after IW.  
  
I'm team BOTG, but don't get me wrong I enjoyed BO3's movement. As a matter of fact my KD was higher in BO3 than any other CoD title I played and I've been playing since CoD4. This reflected for me on the IW beta as well as I found it a breeze to play.  
  
The biggest gripe I get is that this era of Cod gets really stale, really fast. I took advantage of the movement and always came out on top by staying above the enemy, it was a routine every match. I've always found the skill ceiling for traditional games to be much higher than what we have now. Yeah it's harder to predict opposing players, but with all these new mechanics COD is now a game of who can maneuver better rather than who can control a gun fight better. 

The sense of being tactical to me has all but disappeared. I can literally boost my way to B flag and get a triple kill 10 seconds into a match and I find that ridiculous. I miss the days of playing SND and using nade spots, being careful to not get sniped cross map, and being stuck in the 1v3/4/5 situation where it's just you, your gun, and cover. That heart pumping reaction is all but gone and now everyone is running like chickens with their heads cut off going for kill chains and wall running around the entire map killing the flow. I'll admit I'm one of them, we all must adapt.

All in all, I miss the days where I strived to get better at gun fights and learning spawns, and watching videos for little nuances that I can add to my arsenal to improve.

133,"I sort of had this game mode in mind when I was trying to blueprint a Vietnam Call of Duty. The only thing that  sucks is that I don't think it would work in Call of Duty because of how small maps are, the TTK and how long the average life is.  
  
I would call it Ambush or Retreat
  
Two teams, it would basically be a Ground War game mode. Each team is given a certain amount of lives (sort of like tickets in BF). There's a zone in the map where one team is locked in and cant escape with in game boundaries the other team is spawned in around it.  
  
The team locked in basically has to fight off the other team and bring their lives to zero, once it has been done the zone opens and another zone in the map is placed where you must retreat to and hold your ground. I would say you need to get to three zones before an LZ is finally placed and becomes your last retreat zone. The other team just has to ambush and basically bring the held up team's lives to zero.
  
Reading through what I type makes me believe this will be a game mode Better suited for Battlefield and the size of those maps lol. I guess for CoD there would have to be some sort of spawn protection, or it might just not work at all.

198,"IMO, with Raven coming out and saying they would make a Modern era game if they were the fourth Lead Dev can only mean that no other developer has plans to make a modern era game. They're in the background with all developers and know more than anyone whats being designed, and blue printed at this minute.  
  
With IW looking to make Infinite Warfare a new sub series, that only leaves SHG and 3Arc. With Condrey's known interest in the WWII era and SHG having worked on Fog of War (a 3rd person vietnam era game), that leaves 3Arc, which makes things interesting. IMO this is what the outlook would be with Raven coming in the fold:  
  
**2017**: SHG Reveals Vietnam Era Call of Duty  
**2018**: 3Arc Reveals WW1-WW2 Era Call of Duty  
**2019**: IW Reveals Infinite Warfare 2

My biggest gripe with BO3 is the maps (how similar they look/play), the hit detection, and connection. Now that we know IW won't have maps like Ghosts, and they're known for godly hit detection and great connection, I am all in. The weapons look interesting and varying, the Rigs and what they provide looks confusing but I like this take on that system, the streaks looks pretty fun to use, and I like the UI a lot.  
  
Whoever came up with the analogy that this game looks like Ghosts and BO3 had a baby hit it right on the nail and I believe it's a great thing. BO3 was At its core a good game, subtract the negatives and add in the positives that IW can provide with what they're known for, then we're in for at least an entertaining year IMO. The only thing I'm iffy about is the variants and what's gonna happen with the supply drops.
  
Campaign looks light years better than BO3, and don't get me started on MWR, I've already watched countless gameplay hours on that.

I may not be as much as a fan of Ghosts as you are, but my heart and desire for CoD games is and always will be set between the CoD4-BO1 Era.

Just like you I have always preferred IW over Treyarch, I dont enjoy the simplistic three lane approach 3arc took with BO3, and judging by the gameplay we have seen from IW, it looks they are three lane but much more complex and I'm all for that.  
  
I'm a fan of Call of Duty, and I won't knock Infinite Warfare till I try it, if it's atleast as enjoyable at it's core like BO3 then I'll be okay.

As long as the maps are good, I'll be fine with the game. Infinity Wards net coding/connection have always been better IMO and right now with BO3 it's a major problem. I got to Master Prestige fairly quickly in the BO3 cycle, so if the same thing happens for IW I'll gladly play MWR in the down time or vice versa.

I said the game to me, IMO, does not **LOOK** like BO3. Where and I repeat where did I say the game doesn't play like BO3? Please enlighten me, since I'm so stupid it hurts.  
  
The movement has been mentioned multiple times that it's similar to BO3, they even said three lane maps are returning, I'm not dumb enough to say the game won't play like BO3, I know it will be similar, but to me the game looks much less cartoonish, and more hyper realistic, and militaristic compared to BO3. We all have opinions, just cause yours differs from mine wouldn't make me come out here acting the way you are, over a damn video game forum lol.",2016-09-02 21:24:11+00:00,d77adxs,4.0,t1_d778uz8,2287.0,Infinitewarfare

1. The gameplay is very sleek, streamlined.
2. MW2's Pregame lobby IMO, was sleek and streamlined compared to its predecessors.

316,"One big thing I got from all the videos is how Militaristic this game is. BO3 IMO deviates way too far from what we love and know about Call of Duty. Seeing Ghillie suits and actual futuristic takes on Modern Armor really brings this thing home for me. The weapons are beefy, pack a punch, and hell this looks to be my favorite take on how energy weapons have been developed so far. The UI is great, I liked BO3's, but this much more simplistic approach is a great touch. One thing I can gather about the movement is this game is very grounded. I can't tell if it's just because they're playing terminal, or is just a slower game. Blast suppressor seems to be missing from the perk list so I believe it's leading to be the latter for that question.

**But**, Judging from the titles starting at CoD4, it's easily in the bottom third for me after Advanced Warfare and Ghosts.  
  
Why?  
  
Every match is stale, the advanced movement (although done right imo) does not mix well with the three lane design system. The game is very predictable. Connection, lag &amp; latency, has been the very worst in the entire series. The amount of content including groups, although good, has done nothing but cause my game to be a glitchy mess. After experiencing myself and thinking I was the only I couldn't help but laugh watching M3rkMus1c's latest video, Seeing that gamechat causes the game to lag this late in a game's cycle, a 2015-2016 title at the least, is ridiculous. The Black Market is meh, specialists can go or stay, and the weapons list for this game is really bland.  
  
At it's core its an alright CoD title, but by Treyarch standards Black Ops 1 &amp; 2 are leaps and bounds better titles all around in all aspects.",2016-08-27 23:48:04+00:00,d6zd8zy,1.0,t3_4zvv96,14468.0,CallOfDuty

Wall runs are too noticeable, there's not much room for creativity and flanking, in turn causing BO3 IMO to have some of the most stale matches I've played through all of CoD. Everything is just so predictable, but to be fair I do believe 3ARC hit it right on the advanced movement, I just believe more extensively designed maps is what I want to see for IW.",2016-08-26 23:14:02+00:00,d6y6ag1,1.0,t3_4znvq8,46939.0,Infinitewarfare

Ghost's at first I enjoyed but then it got real boring really fast, especially since I transitioned to xbox one when it was released, it seemed empty. Advanced Warfare had potential, but the constant having to look up and gun fights ending in the other player boosting away just caught up to me, couldn't take it. Black ops 3, even though it has problems, definitely got CoD out of it's slump. The story was meh yes, but the amount of content 3arc has provided has been great.

386,"But in all seriousness, I am generally excited to play Infinite Warfare. I noticed the boost slide and meter, but it definitely looked more slower pace and grounded (besides the grappel scenes in space.) The weaponry and tactical equipment was interesting (I.e rapid fire energy SMG, gravity and seeking grenades, side mounted acog optics). The freedom of choosing where you want to go while on the Retribution was a great idea, as well as having full control of your jackal instead of it being ""on rails."" I noticed Leaning which is a cool little add on building on the mechanics of CoD, as well as a pop up shield similar to AW's Exo ability. Lots to take in and lots to be shown!  
  
But with that being said MWR Is shaping up to look like everything I wanted it to look. All Ghillied Up gave me chills, seeing Price's up close face while saying ""on your feet soldier, we are leaving!"", the close up on Zahkeav, and the sheer gruesome view of the Nuke going off in 'Shock &amp; Awe' I honestly just can't wait!",2016-06-14 05:08:55+00:00,d48dwma,1.0,t3_4nzua7,647.0,CallOfDuty

So they pushed for  a futuristic setting. I'm sure there was a meeting between devs and Publisher to blueprint their idea of a future game with 3D movement being the foundation.

I finished playing this game like 3 months in and had nothing else to do, at least with IW I can switch back and forth to both styles of gameplay (but I'm not gonna lie, the hype I have for MWR is unmatched, It's my fave game all time and I'm so happy to be able to experience it again.)",2016-05-04 01:49:13+00:00,d2rvjq1,1.0,t3_4hn97j,44203.0,CallOfDuty
579,"""Headquarters (also known as King of the Hill) is a multiplayer game mode featured in all Call of Duty games until (and including) Call of Duty: Black Ops II (Hardpoint). In this mode, teams capture a set point in the map (the ""headquarters"") to gain points. It is one of the most popular game modes, as it offers experience per time that the headquarters is held, allowing for larger sums of points earned. Teams must coordinate a steadfast and solid defensive perimeter around a captured headquarters in order to hold it. In Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and Call of Duty: Black Ops the headquarters is marked by a metal box with a computer on top (The Wii version has a wooden box with a Satchel charge); each game using slightly different representations. In Call of Duty: World at War a wooden table with a radio and helmet is used.""",2016-05-04 00:55:05+00:00,d2rt5b7,5.0,t1_d2rstmz,430.0,CallOfDuty

Mw2 was a great game but it had so much more downfalls then CoD4. OMA/Noob tube/danger close is a train wreck, camping for high Killstreaks creates a disruption in gameplay, commando was excruciatingly annoying.  
  
CoD4 made me mad, but mostly cause I sucked at it and I still had the time of my life. MW2 just made me want to toss my controller out the window but always brought me back. Both are truly the golden age of CoD, but CoD4 has something about it that no one can ever put their finger on, it's truly timeless and literally a legend not just in the cod community but in the entire FPS community as a whole.

Because it's the style of call of duty I enjoy the most? We're all entitled to an opinion right? I will gladly pay $60 for a remastered trilogy, and I would love to see BO1 in HD too.  
  
&gt;Now to the Infinite Warfare. I understand hearing COD in space sounds weird, unfamiliar and maybe even shocking to some. But remember this game was 3 years in the development. The developers wouldn't continue on a game for so long if it didn't work out. I say we put some hope on the table for Infinity Ward. They have proven they can make memorable games and game characters within 1 year and 3 years for a single game sure gave them plenty of time to look back and see what works and what doesn't.  
  
I'm not bashing IW or the space setting. I've on the record said that I honestly believe IW has the capability to make a successful game given three years of development and minimal consoles to work on. This isn't a bashing post, this isn't a future sucks post, this is what the title of infinite warfare means to me post so this whole comment you just conjured up can be posted elsewhere since it's irrelevant to what I'm trying to discuss.  
  
**Not anywhere in my post do I say: ""fuck this future advanced movement shit, boots on the ground 4eva!""** I am literally stating what the title of Infinite Warfare means to me and my extreme theory. I know theres a 99% chance itll be set in space, and the future, and very sci-fi, and I'm okay with it. I and no one else have seen anything from IW so theres nothing to judge.  
  
&gt;But with black ops 3 Treyarch really hit it right. They managed to make the game fast paced, mechanically fun and make it simple but hard to master which is what COD should be all about.  
  
Don't even get me started here. Black Ops 3 is the absolute easiest Call of Duty to date &amp; The lowest skill ceiling I have ever endured. The map design is horrific for the style of gameplay. It is repetitive, stale, and the absolute easiest to pace around. There is no tactical aspect for BO3, you choose a lane, out maneuver someone and proceed to get kills, like a broken record. Yes the guns are pretty balanced, but hit detection is horrific. Yes the game is mechanically fun, but the connectivity is garbage and pretty surprising the amount of crashes/lag spikes still occurs after this long and supposed dedicated servers. Nothing about the game is game breaking but nothing is memorable. Best of the Current gen titles, but doesn't even compare to the titles of the past.",2016-04-27 07:01:01+00:00,d2j1y9h,2.0,t1_d2j197p,2101.0,CallOfDuty

IMO, if any of the next titles are the traditional style of movement, as long as the maps are done right the game can be very fast paced without the necessary advanced movement.

I can't play for more that an hour cause every match plays out the same until I play against those with a much higher skill. All the weapons are pretty balanced and there isn't that one defined weapon that blows you away. (This can be good, *cough* AW). The black market is a toxic pit that shouldn't be in the game. Specialists fit in well with the concept but most of them are very cheesy and the weapons just causes a moment a chaos and don't really add anything that wows me, (except ripper feeds... LOVE THAT). Overall this is a good game, nothing is game breaking, but to me it fails to create the experience from past gen cod's, and part of that is this game has the **lowest skill gap ceiling** of any cod game to date. Idc for those who think advanced movement adds in a layer of skill, It really doesn't, just adds chaos and better ways to manueverer your self closer to the enemy and out of their line of fire.",2016-04-20 17:52:46+00:00,d2alhsg,2.0,t1_d2a4x5m,26680.0,blackops3

The more futuristic we go the more easier it will be to maneuver, hence what we have seen with AW and BO3.

Call of Duty used to be about the call to duty, military vs military, putting you in the shoes of a soldier and depicting a simulation of war you can relate to. This space stuff goes so far out on what call of duty is that it puts fear into people thinking about it. Sure sci fi buffs may love it, people who prefer advanced movement may love it, but it still destroys what call of duty was about. Watch Driftor's video on his thoughts on call of duty, and I guarantee anybody who prefers the traditional style will gag thinking about what call of duty has a chance of becoming.

791,"I 100% agree. The only reason why I'm kind of okay with a space game is that it completely goes the sci-fi route. I hated that AW and BO3 were still in a forseeable timeline yet made the way they were. At least this game they're able to go all out sci-fi and not kid themselves and have split personalities. I always thought black ops 2 should be the absolute max era of boots on the ground gameplay. Other than that, branch all the way out and make a full sci-fi game.  
  
It's going to be interesting to see if EA/DICE go through with a WW1 shooter while Activision/IW makes a complete opposite game.  
  
People keep saying SHG are for certain making a AW2, but I just don't buy it. They were making a Vietnam 3rd person shooter and were signed on to help MW3 come out on time. They're just as much a boots on the ground dev as any of the Devs, and ATVI forced them to make something unseen in CoD. I'm still betting with the start of a new three year cycle after cod2016 ATVI is urging SHG to start a new boots on the ground saga of CoDs.  
  
Yet people swear it's us 1% of Reddit that only want that style of game, but if you take the time to look at any post from any developer the comments preceding it are always #favfornoexos, boots on the ground, cod sucks now, I can go play halo or destiny instead, etc.

To see how much it has grown but I just don't agree with this statement: ""we do not think this is true. Calling a Call of Duty title ‘Bloodlines’ just seems odd. It does not really match up with any naming schemes for Call of Duty’s before, and with a name like that, it’s hard to explain what the game is. Call of Duty game titles normally define the game: Modern Warfare being a game about modern warfare; Black Ops being a game about black ops; Advanced Warfare relating to the futuristic setting; Ghosts relating directly to the theme of ghosts soldiers.""  
  
If it's a whole new title how can it be odd to call it bloodlines? MW and BO were both trilogies so I understand the continuation of titles relating to the games but ghost was also a new title and while it dealt with the ghosts in the actual game no one had a clue what it was about until reveal.

910,"I'll post my options ranging from least likely to very likely.  
  
**Remastered Collection:** Sadly this has been crossed off my list, as much as I would like to see this I just can't envision IW going back and remastering their past titles after seeing ""new...Innovative...Ambitious"" being tossed around in statements.  
  
**Modern Warfare 4:** Another one I would've loved to see but one that I don't see happening. IMO I believe this ensemble of IW Devs want to get out of the shadow left by the originals who left for Respawn, and I just don't see any other way out besides creating their own AAA title that can actually be received well and define their style of development, not their past.  
  
**Ghosts 2:** I wouldn't mind this because I give IW the benefit of the doubt to build on what little good stuff they did on ghosts and completely revamp the bad, while taking the full three years to create something worthwhile. But, I just believe ""ghosts"" the name and trademark alone will be a bad decision on Activision's part and I do not believe we will see it.  
  
**CoD Prequel:** Of all the routes IW goes I believe this is the most enticing. I would love love love to see them explore the back story of a younger Captain Price in the same role of Soap and Expand on Cap. Macmillan as a character, as well as all of the character's history prior to CoD4. Personally a multiplayer setting in this time era would be amazing,.. not too old, and not too far fetched, gritty yet still realistic. I genuinely feel this is an option that IW can really take. (edit: Remember the legends dlc pack from Ghosts? They still have the past very much in their thoughts)  
  
**Whole new title:** Which time era? I have no clue but this is the second most logical option IW will take as to what their next game will be IMO (Bloodlines, etc. would be classified here). The time era is tough to decipher, but this leads to my number one option.  
  
**CoD....IN SPACE....:** No I am not giving this option because BiblicalReaper says so. I honestly believe this is the setting for COD2016. Why? well  to simply put it, these developers meet, talk and expand on each others ideas. They were all working on their titles at the same time and I believe they'll all keep the same theme going. AW took a risk and decided to focus very hard on advanced movements to freshen up the entire series, Treyarch smoothed things up with their chain based movement while adding more 3D options as well as the most content we've seen in a disc of CoD, and I believe IW will follow with something very ""Innovative, and ambitious."" I believe we'll be far into the future, enough to have actual warfare in space and I believe whatever 3arc implemented will be built upon. We will see specialists, etc. but with a touch of IW.  
  
After this, a new three year cycle will have been started, SHG would be two years into its cycle and I believe they will be the ones to start a new boots on the ground era, with a brand new title of their own.",2016-03-10 06:29:58+00:00,d0ufxqz,1.0,t3_49qmz6,27554.0,CallOfDuty

Yes I understand that, and I already said I'm not discounting it, but you're misssing my point. Modern Warfare literally revolutioned the FPS multiplayer landscape alone. Perks, Kill streaks, create-a-class. Call of duty and the original titles did amazing things for the game but what happened? Modern Warfare literally revolutioned the FPS multiplayer landscape. So I started the chart there, at the game that paved the way we play our games right now, and what do you know, I just so happened to fit every title after it, in a chart for easy readibility.

1074,"I feel the same way, but another thing we have to think about, if a new sequel was released it will be hard to make it go futuristic, without major changes.

Reasoning:
• It's ""Modern Warfare"", to keep it ""Modern"" the game can't be set too far out in the future, Ghosts timeframe is the farthest I believe they could go.
• Let's say they follow another trendy theory going around and continue the MW series but instead of calling it MW4 they call it Future Warfare. The name will be too similar to advanced warfare and wouldn't be well received with ""future"" lol.

It's honestly a crapshoot as to what this title will be, but since BF5 is releasing and those games tend to be as modern as they can be, IW would be smart to keep it in the same timeframe and not just release another futuristic game. Or just make everyone happy and fulfill their destiny of releasing the MW collection haha.",2016-01-28 00:23:48+00:00,czej8n5,4.0,t1_czei9ad,1592.0,CallOfDuty

1077,"Very good point, that's why I believe the hype for cod 2016 and what it is very high. With Treyarch you knew it was either gonna be BO3 or WaW2, with IW it's very hard to say where they're going. The only reason why I'm leaning towards MW4 over ghosts 2 is because, one: the sales was horrible, and it wasn't well receive. Blacks ops 3 has nothing to do with Black ops 2 except for one mention of Raul Menendez, so IW can come up with some type of continuance off of MW3, as Makarov said in the trailer for MW2: ""You may be able to destroy me, but the beast will eventually come for you."". I 100% agree that it shouldn't take 3 years to do the remastered trilogy but evidence shows it could take a bit for a complete remaster to be developed, Halo's MCC came out two years after Halo 4 while Halo Combat evolved was already remastered, most of the focus went into halo 2, it also had an extremely rough start with game connection and servers, something I'm sure IW would've taken note of. Also who knows what else they could've added into this, I.e. Playlists for campaign, more spec ops missions etc. A big reason why it would take a bit to make this collection: you don't want to mess up your precious treasure, I believe they will follow the blue print for HMCC, and keep the games separate, but with a universal ranking system/in game ranking system, along with a beta invitation to there next big 2019 title on unreal engine 4.

IMO most likely to be released.
