**First couple of matches on MWR**: negative KD, dying left to right, nade spam, getting demolished by M16's with people that have M16 in their clan tag, &amp; yet I'm completely okay with it, cause that's exactly how I Remember CoD4. I was horrible and just stuck with SND. I'm coming around now, positive KD, winning matches, but man the transition was tough. Skill ceiling IMO much higher than what we have today.  
  
**First match of IW**: 40-1 TDM and haven't looked back since, I'm a damn Jetpacker. No matter how much crazy stuff they add, to me this style of CoD is insanely simple. Getting shot from the back? I can literally turn around jump back and boost slide backwards for the advantage. I'm not gonna get into it more since I do enjoy the chain based movement, but the skill ceiling has dropped off IMO.  
  
I'm happy to have both styles of CoD to play for the year. ",Infinitewarfare,Anybody else had a rough start for MWR and came to the realization that you're a Jetpacker?..,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infinitewarfare/comments/5bfzo2/anybody_else_had_a_rough_start_for_mwr_and_came/

* It's been 8 years since our last WWII CoD  
* Call of Duty settings have been heading further in the future since MW3 (**MW3-2016, BO2-2025, Ghosts-2023, AW-2054, BO3-2065, IW-TBD**)  
* Announced BC titles and dates when available are: **Black Ops**-5/17/16, **Call of Duty 2**-8/23/16, **Call of Duty 3**-9/22/16, **World at War**-9/27/16  
  
I think Call of Duty/ATVI are laying the groundwork in readying up the Community for the release of a CoD set in the past, starting with the first available date, 2017.  
  
All titles that have become BC are all set between WWII and the Cold War. [Even though the highest Call of Duty's on the BC wish list are Black Ops 2 and the MW series](https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/298503-game-request). The selection in games is interesting to say the least. We all know the outcry to go back to more a realistic time setting, to get away from advanced movement and get back to BOTG (not to knock those who like where CoD is right now). It is also a big coincidence that [Michael Condrey has openly stated his admiration for the World War era and how open he is to developing one.](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/advanced-warfare-dev-wants-another-world-war-ii-ca/1100-6423387/)  
  
Sledgehammer's game is already two years in development and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't really intrigued in the reveal of that title.  
    
**Tl;dr** The choices in BC titles and their eras so far makes me think something fishy is going on, and IMO makes the argument that COD will be going back to its roots much stronger.

[Modern Warfare 3 has been openly advertised as the Finale to that series](https://twitter.com/charlieintel/status/766683271623213058)  
     
Meanwhile, Black Ops 3 was never mentioned or advertised as any type of finale, in game or in the real world. Matter of fact don't directly quote me on this, but I firmly remember during one of the reveal interviews for Black Ops 3, either Jason Blundell or Mark Lamia stated that the Black Ops Universe is never ending and story-line possibilities are endless.  
  
Obviously WaW is part of the Universe with Reznov and that Zombies story, but don't be surprised if Treyarch does a complete U-turn from a WaW2 for 2018 and go a completely different direction with their next game.  
  
Judging by the community's feelings toward which time era they prefer from my [survey](https://redd.it/53i8j6), and throughout any comment section from anything Call of Duty, I wouldn't be surprised if Treyarch does move forward with  WaW sequel or something else other than the future while still being in that universe including a BO4.

By far the hardest part was finding attachments for weapons since there wasn't really any in that era. From what I can gather Black Ops 1 is the closest to being set in this era and even then the attachments weren't really realistic. I bit the bullet and decided to use that game for assistance. I was trying to go for an experience that is between bare bones and something with a little more like BO1, but not as complex as the games now.
  
This is just my attempt and it would be cool if the community took part. I'm open to suggestions and will be more than happy to change things out, add things in or simply remove anything upon request, just shoot!

With that being said, I believe this means we wont be seeing a Modern setting for CoD in a while.  
  
Why? Well Raven plays a big part in the development of multiple CoD's, although they are not a lead dev they have their hands in the mix as much as anyone. For them to come out and say they would like to do a modern CoD IMO means no other dev at this time has any plans to make one with that setting thus creating an opening for developing one.

**2018**: WW2 or Alternate Universe Set Call of Duty (3ARC can do some weird stuff, think a wolfenstein setting COD, axis wins WWII, other than that your plain old WW2 game)  
**2019**: Infinite Warfare 2  
  
Let's say ATVI decides to start a new Four year cycle of Development. It would definitely have to be in the works and blue printed this very minute. Raven is working hard on MWR, and COD online, in order for them to have sufficient Dev time, I believe 2020 Could be the year for the Modern Era of CoD to start once again.

Since the developers stated they would like to implement Infinite Warfare as a new Sub franchise for Call of Duty it made me wonder. If they're okay with sharing the spot light of Infinite Warfare with a fan Favorite  such as CoD 4 remastered now, why wouldn't they be okay with that for future sequels?  
  
I thought about it and the release dates for the sequels would coincide closely with the 10 year anniversaries of the remaining titles from the Modern Warfare series.  
  
**2019 will be the expected release date for an Infinite Warfare 2 as well as the 10 year anniversary for Modern Warfare 2.**  
  
**2022 will be the expected release date for an Infinite Warfare 3 as well as one year past the 10 year anniversary for Modern Warfare 3.**  
  
With the help of Raven Software taking the lead for developing these titles it all but seems plausible that this can happen. Thoughts?

A good look at movement mechanics whether it's utilizing the surroundings or the soldier itself is necessary.

I remember at E3 Eric Hershberg from Activision stated ""Everyone thought we would play it safe and make Modern Warfare 4."" Well what if they did play it safe? Instead of attempting to create a new story Arc while developing a game for 7 consoles, I believe it would've been much easier and safer to develop a brand everybody knows while introducing it to next gen.  
  
If you have seen Drift0r's and Ragnarox's History of Call of Duty series, it is quite evident that Activision goes with what's trendy and sells well. Initially WWII was the FPS of choice, but when it was stale and COD3 didn't sell well, IW finally convinced them to introduce MW. Now with that statement, Ghosts was unsuccessful to say the least, yes it sold, but faced extreme criticism. Causing the change to a new style and era of gameplay.  
  
Now, this is assuming MW4 would've sold and been successful, if it wasn't we would be in the same boat today. But if it sold well, I believe things could've been different. Maybe SHG couldv'e finished their 3rd person Vietnam shooter, maybe BO3 would've been futuristic without the movement, lots of scenearios can come in play here.

So, I'm 99% sure this upcoming game is not MW4, I only put that up there because the IW7 Logo closely resembles the MW4 and MW3 in a weird way.  
  
To keep it short: the Infinite Warfare cover shows a major correlation to the Modern Warfare series covers. They all contain Warfare, they all have a Character posed eerily in a similar way paired with your usual washed out destruction in the background. When you look at the Ghosts cover you can see how much of a difference branding is. I Honestly feel IW is trying real hard to get back to its roots here and until **the official reveal**, I will believe  for some reason in the bottom of my heart this game is somehow related to or in the same universe as the Modern Warfare Series. It's so similar, so Infinity Ward, and it's right in front of our eyes.

Two things I couldn't help but notice...  
1. The two ships on the bottom left going upwards (you may have to zoom for it)  largely resemble the giant ship in Nuketown. Now I know there is people skeptical about this cover art and this may help push it to being confirmed.  
2. Theres a patch or some sort of insignia on the right shoulder of the cover character (his left). When messing with exposure/levels/contrast I noticed it was definitely in the shade of red. Now the only reason I took notice was because a couple months back @thatmocapguy on twitter (motion capture employee at IW, who was very talkative with the community) Had tweeted out a picture of a red patch similar in shape and coloring, but can't remember for the life of me what it dealt with besides the fact that it had to do with some sort of Ballistic Defenses.

Whacky Theory I know, but I've always thought the ""Warfare"" portion of Infinite Warfare made it seem in some way it would be connected to the Modern Warfare series, how little it can be. This also coincides with that weird @Pegasus627 account tweeting all the weird cryptic stuff dealining with the past (cod1) all the way through the Modern Warfare series.

I wanted to break down the supposed leaked title and give insight on what it means to me.  
  
First lets start with **Infinite**: limitless or endless in *space*, extent, or size; impossible to measure or calculate.  
  
This literally screams space, as it is impossible to calculate and endless. This also coincides directly with Shinobi602's statements for the next installment of CoD being full on Sci-fi and space combat.  
  
There's theories out there suggesting that this game can deal with *time travel*, but I'm highly skeptical, since multiplayer will be very tough to establish. It needs a solid foundation and making a multiplayer game set in different eras can sound cool, but honestly it's just too much. Campaign wise it can be very interesting.  
  
Now the most interesting aspect of the leaked title for me has to be **Warfare**. Why? Well to me if I was IW, and I wanted to bring about a new IP from my company, I wouldn't want to include ""Warfare"" in the title. We've already had 4 titles with it as well as one title from another Developer. We are also far and done with the Modern Warfare trilogy, why make a new game with a title very similar?  
  
*Personal theory*: This next game has a chance to be related somehow to the Modern Warfare story arc. Maybe in the same universe like how the Black Ops series seems to be. Why is this theory not out of the realm? Well Imagine the amount of money that can be made from us, the consumer, if we come to realize this next game is in relation to Modern Warfare 1,2,3.  
  
**Brace Yourself This Is Where Things Get Weird**  
  
It can take place in the future, it can have its advanced movement, or it can be a prequel, whatever. Yes I know ""but SHG did Advanced **Warfare**"", the only difference is that COD2016 is coming from *Infinity Ward*, and having a game with this title just screams a relation, as little as it can be, to the MW story arc.  
  
Why would this be neat? Well if it were true, then the rumors of backwards compatible CoD4 &amp; MW2 as Pre Order bonuses (I have zero hope of this from Activi$ion) can easily be shipped out a long with the game as a bonus (for extra monies of course), to help those understand the story arc of this upcoming game. (MW3 needs to be included though)  
  
**Now Back To Reality**  
  
Even though you've probably already downvoted me, in my heart I feel that Shinobi is 100% accurate. I do believe this game will be a far future, super sci-fi game, and it could very well just be a new IP from IW, even though the ""Warfare"" bit of the title is very enticing. I honestly don't believe this was a mistake from ATVI, this IMO is a publicity stunt to get the hype train moving along. We had it start last year with Viral Marketing.  
  
Now I can honestly say, I have never been this eager to see a reveal to Call of Duty title more than this upcoming one. The sense of mystery keeps everyone in the community guessing and it hasn't been that way in years. Last year it was either BO3 or WaW2 (but we knew it was BO3), the year before that everyone thought it was MW4 till AW was revealed, 2013 everyone thought it was MW4 till Ghosts was revealed, 2012 Iron Wolf was ramping up but BO2 was always in the back of everyone's heads, and so on. This year holds so much mystery and I definitely will be reeled in on 5/3/2016, for the supposed reveal.

I wanna know what you think about the game thus far? How does it rank up to other call of duty's? What do you like about it and what do you hate about it?  
  
For me.... I really enjoyed the amount of content this game had, I really felt it lived up to the price we pay for a game.  
  
 **Starting out with campaign**:  It was alright. Jumped around a lot and the plot was very wonky. Realistic Mode was hard but I still expected it to be much worse (nothing beats WAW veteran). My favorite part was when it went back in time to WWII, it literally gave me chills hearing the music and the warfare.  
  
**Nightmares mode:** although a cool concept, I never kept playing after the first night and haven't tried since.  
  
**Freerun Mode:** I expected a lot from it, but it completely died off. I though treyarch implemented the next big thing but it just never caught fire with the community from what I've seen.  
  
**Zombies:** Has been amazing. I never was much of a zombies player, but now that I'm ranked far enough in multiplayer I've been dwelling in zombies with friends and doing the EE's. It's been a great time, can't wait for the other packs!  
  
**Multiplayer:** Sheesh where do I begin. I'm personally more fond of the more traditional style of cod. That doesn't mean I don't like the new movement or suck with it. I'm fairly good IMO and definitely adapted to it. I do not find it feasible to have this movement mixed in with the three lane style of maps. It causes repetitive gaming, less flanking, and overall a stale experience after a while. The game has been pretty balanced and I like the actions treyarch has taken in patches, but for me these servers have been horrendous. My connection in general is great, but the amount of times I get lag spikes, kicked, or can't invite any one is ridiculous. Supply drops are garbage, cod points, and taunts/gestures too. Other than that the game has been a good time, but just went by too fast!  
  
**Overall experience**: 7/10  
  
This game IMO is the best of the current gen titles, but nothing stands out about the game and it gets lost in comparison to other titles.

But when I tell you, playing MW2 just now on PC for the past hour has been so much more fun than BO3, I mean it. I always thought it was unfair nostalgia, thinking about the past games over what we have been playing these last couple of years. After I sold my 360 and moved to current gen I was one of those who had the rose tinted goggles and always defended the past cods. But after Finally giving in and going back to it after playing BO3... I'm just in awe. The gun fights are surreal, immersive. The hit detection is godly, I just can't put my finger on whats going on.  
  
On another note, I am no scrub on BO3, I liked it, much more in fact than AW and Ghosts, but my god the past hour playing MW2 has been the most fun I've had in a couple of years.  
  
It honestly feels like a release day, everyone is a noob level, chatting with each other, and all the memories I have of the past are coming back to fruition, and I'm in awe.  
  
You lovers of the new era of cod can downvote me, I have no care. I like the games, but when I tell you buying Modern Warfare 2 a couple of hours ago on the steam sale is the best $10 I've ever spent, I mean it &amp; for those who have not experienced this era of CoD Grab them while you still can.

In his latest post someone asks:  
  
""They had space combat in Ghosts hopefully it's now actually good.""  
  
and he goes on to reply: ""*This is nothing like Ghosts. We're talking combat in spaceships*, *and* **not just around Earth**.""  

Which means we are not gonna be just in Earth's orbit, We can actually be around different planets, maybe even lightyears away.  
  
""*Being a mostly campaign guy*, *I'm* **pretty excited** *for this one*.""  
  
Now doing some research on Shinobi, his favorite game is pretty much Mass Effect, so why would he be pretty excited for this game? Well one, cause of the setting, but two, I believe this CoD will be more open world than any other title. Everyone was tired of the usual follow a trail, reach checkpoint, kill enemy wave, type of shooter cod was, so in three years, Treyarch implemented a more decisive story geared to deciding where you wanted to go, at a certain extent. They also implemented the safe house feature which can easily be switched for your spaceship and maybe we can actually get to travel. What if there is an in game currency similar to the Division where we can go to other worldy vendors and purchase better gear, weapons etc? (keep it away from MP pls)  
  
Where I'm trying to get here is that, with three years these developers have a lot of time to implement what they can, treyarch gave us the most content we've ever seen in a disc of cod, and I'm certain IW will build on that. We are literally reaching unexplored territory in call of duty, IW **knows** Ghosts was a fuming fudge dragon someone left in a urinal (southpark), they want to show they can create something fresh, something we have not seen in cod, and I can honestly say for the campaign aspect of CoD2016, I'm excited.

- **Halo**, set after the year 2500 just recently implemented thrusters as a core mechanic as late as Halo 4 but no where to the level of AW or BO3.  
- **Starwars Battlefront**, set in space (or away from earth) in the far future, is mostly boots on the ground, with little moments of a jet pack here and there.   
  
-**Destiny** is the oddball, although it has the advanced movement, its more on the range as an ability per subclass of your character rather than a core mechanic like **Titanfall** or the recent CoDs.  
  
All I'm trying to say is Yes the game can very well be set in space, away from Earth, on another planet etc. but it doesn't mean we can see the exact same thing like we have as of late. AW blew the door open and Treyarch optimized it and made it more controllable to fit in with their Map design and flow of the game. IW games have always been a slower paced, find your best route around a map and better position against the opposition type of shooter. Although it was too late to ditch the future, I can honestly believe they saw the feedback from AW and may have wanted to tone it down, maybe even further from BO3.  
  
This doesn't mean we'll be safe from the 3D movement, IW loves their map dynamics, and it'll be interesting to see if maybe they'll implement that to their maps for this title. One example can be gravitational boots that pins the character enough to complete a wall run or easier traversal. Maybe like halo they can implement a propulsion system across the map if its size is large enough. Just a thought, I'm just urging to stop assuming the game is ass until we see it in person and we're let down.

**THIS IS COMING FROM A HARDCORE LOVER OF ALL THE MODERN SETTING COD GAMES, I WILL ALWAYS KEEP MY NOSTALGIA GOGGLES ON.**   
  
But I'm definitely interested in what IW can bring to the table. I'm sick of near future, and the split personality between boots on the ground and advanced movement, it got stale real fast. If you're gonna make a futuristic game, go all the way sci-fi, if not keep it at a Black Ops 2 time setting max.  
  
Activision is about the business, they already have Destiny under their name. Why make a game a sci-fi shooter, set in the far future, in space, with specialists, if they already have one?

These developers meet, greet, and expand on each others ideas. It is no surprise that the last dev of this first three year cycle is continuing the trend.

**EDIT: COD:ONLINE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED INTERNATIONALLY FOR THE LOSS OF SALES WE CAN EXPECT IN 2016.**  
  
 2017 Marks the start of a new three year cycle, and this is the schedule of releases I honestly believe we will see:  
  
**Sledgehammer 2017**: **The start of a new Boots on the Ground Saga**. Whether it's the vietnam shooter they were working on or a more realistic take, this is the route I see SHG taking, it also marks the 10 year anniversary of CoD4 as well, so don't be surprised to see that in some shape or form. 
  
**Treyarch 2018**: **The long awaited World War title returns**. Treyarch of all developers reads the community (sometimes they are overpowered by ATVI... Supply Drops *cough*) but they know we want to see a world war game again. World at War 2? Idk but I can be sure a current gen release is something that's very enticing to them.  
  
**Infinity Ward 2019**: **The Wildcard**.

**What Makes it a Pipedream**:  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare remastered included as a Digital Bonus.

**What Makes it Feasible**: We all know Activision is about the $$$$, so instead of including it as a pre order bonus as we just saw from the BS article, what if it was included in a digital deluxe or the ""Prestige Edition"" for CoD2016? Similar to Nightmares mode or zombies from the past, after you beat the campaign from the initial CoD4 prequel title, you then get to play the Remastered version of CoD4's single player. Multiplayer will be accessible from the start.  
  
Rather than having both MW1&amp;2 overshadow the main title, just have one, and if the game is a prequel title, then CoD4 should be that game to be included. It'll help the drought and boring part of the usual call of duty cycle, by having arguably an all time great available to be accessed.  
  
**The Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare 10th anniversary is next year, Activision is sitting on a gold mine. If we don't see it this year I can bet we just might next year**  
  
**Edit:**  
**Why a Prequel?:** The very thought that there's an untouched story arc from the modern warfare series is very enticing. We don't know much about how Price got to where he is, We only have one mission's worth of any info about Cap. Macmillan, it's untouched territory and a break from the exo suits/3d movement. The time era wouldn't be too old yet still in modern times, and in my opinion a great setting to base multiplayer in. In all honesty, rather than having IW 2.0 tarnish the golden trilogy of the MW series with a continuation title, I would love for back stories from historic characters to be unearthed.

It can very well be fake, but I just wanted to put this out there in case it has some solid info that proves to be true in the coming months.  
  
**Game tester:**  
  
""Hey I work part time at infinity ward, in California, as a games tester and I have some information on COD 2016. I also worked on testing COD Ghosts. By the way this is a fake account so I don't get exposed and lose my job and get a bad reputation in the game developing community. I can confirm that it is not called Call of duty bloodline but I do not know the actual name. I only work on one section of a mission from the campaign and I have a rough idea of the story, it is defiantly set in the future and its USA vs an Asian country (probably China). China have developed very futuristic technology but America have not been able to do this due to the fact of huge money problems so China take advantage of this and obviously invade USA. Remember this may not be all right, But from what I can tell from one mission that seems to be the story. Only one map in the game testing and that is meant to be quite large, around the size of redwood which is set on a Chinese island. Marksman rifles are returning and there is a no type of movement, where you can go from cover to cover like in the division. One person told me there is a combat mechanic but others had denied it. There is talk of spec ops but not confirmed and I would just like to also say that it looks very similar to ghost, quite dull and fuzzy. Also all the guns feel very heavy and slow to move compared to BO3. I informed other YouTubers and pages as well so post this and get it out to the community. Thank you.""  
  
**EDIT FURTHER ELABORATION:**  
  
""Well, I actually game tested as a part-time job for other smaller games and some AAA titles but then I moved to Infinity Ward while they were making Ghosts and realised the speculation around Call Of Duty rumors but I didn't release anything. Then it got round to this cod and I thought I might as well leak stuff because I'm getting a bit old for all this game testing so might retire from it soon. But I may stay for one more call of duty  
  
I only know 2 assault rifles, one similar looking to the acr, called AUSA-18, and a semi automatic SFBR-51. There's one marksman rifle called the SSR MK 2.  
  
There is one ""classified section"" which I only have one idea which it could be which is energy guns, like AW. Im only allowed one secondary in testing which is a combat knife.""",CallOfDuty,"CoD2016 Info DM, Fake IMO but we'll see",https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/499rs3/cod2016_info_dm_fake_imo_but_well_see/

But here's my options pertaining the title:  
  
-This game can span multiple eras and generations (past, present, future in one title).  
  
-This title can be a BS leak and mean nothing.  
  
-This can be a very old time setting game or a very futuristic game.  
  
-What if this game (and that's a really big IF) is the prequel to the MW Series. Really wishful thinking since it most likely can be a whole new series altogether, or high likely chance it's not even bloodline, but man, had my heart pumping for a bit there when I though about.

Today's poll is what's your favorite forested map from CoD4-BO3 ? Including DLC  
  
There was a fine line I had to follow regarding what's a map that is forested compared to a map with just a couple patches of grass and a tree. So if there's a map you consider forested don't hesitate to comment and I'll gladly review and add it to the list!  My personal vote has to be between Overgrown and Wasteland.
  
The last two are Redwood and Gauntlet since it seems to get cut off.

But what I'm wondering is can they continue the series? I have no clue about the restrictions since the MW series was brought along by IW and if SHG would be allowed to continue it. But it has me thinking because there was a time when everybody thought SHG were making MW4, and what if they actually decided to do that?  
  
AW's story IMO was awesome, cinematically, graphically, and story telling wise. Large in part because the creator of the Dead Space series was responsible. I know they went all in on a new movement system, but if they'll be starting a brand new three year cycle between the devs, would it be out of this world to assume they can continue the series? I don't remember a cliff hanger in AW and I know they were developing a 3rd Person game as well before they were signed on for MW3.  
  
Schofield in November stated on twitter: ""Can't talk about the game but we listened and I am so f*%#=ing stoked about this one.""   
  
Devs love to get together and share their future plans, and since AW started the advanced movement saga, &amp; 3arc continued it, I wholeheartedly feel that IW will not be making a boots on the ground game. So after this IW game a new three year cycle will start between the devs, and my prediction is that SHG will reboot a Boots on the Ground saga, whether continuing with MW4, or a new title. Treyarch will follow with a Highly hyped World War era game, and IW will be the wild card.

If for some reason IW decides to go on with Ghosts 2 or MW4 when do you think a remaster will happen? (It's only a matter of time).

My thoughts:

If we see ghosts 2/mw4 I believe ATVI will take the same route as halo as they did with Halo CE Anniversary and we will see cod4 in 2017, which will mark the 10 year anniversary of the game's release. ""BUT HOW WILL IW MAKE TWO GAME RELEASES IN A ROW??"" you may ask. Well Eric Hirshberg stated:

 “IT’S ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY COST, MEANING WE NEED EVERY BODY WE CAN GET TO MAKE THE CONTENT WE’RE ALREADY COMMITTED TO FOR OUR NEW GAMES. IT’S ALWAYS A MATTER OF FINDING GREAT PEOPLE TO DO THAT WORK. I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY MODERN WARFARE 1 OR THE ORIGINAL BLACK OPS. THERE’S CERTAINLY A DEEP WELL THERE. NO ANNOUNCEMENTS, BUT IT’S SOMETHING WE TALK ABOUT AND THINK ABOUT A LOT.”

AKA, he knows that IW will be too busy to make a new AAA title and remaster so this will be taken on new Devs, which I'm sure ATVI has no problems with finding.

""BUT WHAT ABOUT SHG AND ADVANCED WARFARE2???"" You may also ask, well this is where things get a bit wonky. I believe the perfect time to release a remake of a game will be in the end of winter/spring part of the CoD cycle where everyone thinks the older cods are 10x better that the one just released. How will this work? Well what if instead of 4 map packs we get two? I know sounds weird but it does open up more money to be made for ATVI and less stress on the developers for map packs, or they can double on the map packs and add more maps for the 2 DLC packs.... And have the summer for a remake before the next title. That way every year around this time we could get a backwards compatible game/remastered version to fill in the void when the season gets slow. But The current rise in eSports does put a bump in this

It's fair to say All Ghillied Up is one of the best missions in gaming history.. What if IW explores that story arc more, in an Origins game focusing on Captain Macmillan and a younger Price who was in Soap's shoes at the time. Zahkaev made a great Antagonist and exploring how he rose to such a powerful arms dealer/ultranationalist as well as the other members of the four horsemen will be interesting as can be. Imagine how gritty a mid 90's setting Call of Duty will be (a meeting point between WW2 and Future). It will be hard to put enough content since Imran didn't intitiate his plans till 2011, but I'm sure In three years IW could've found a storyline for Macmillan and price. I.e. Nuclear Arms Race, tension with Russia. 

(Wishful thinking: IW ADDS IN ALL GHILLIED UP. REMASTERED.)
I think a mid 90's setting hasn't been explored enough, I remember playing an old game called Operation Desert Storm, and it was gritty as can be.

How would eSports work? Activision is investing very very very heavily on COD World League and pro-am's that it would be hard to see a remastered trilogy coming out because of this. I means it's possible since CS:GO seems to be growing even at its age. But I'm just curious about the parameters IW would take to implement eSports. Very unlikely it's even released but still very interesting. I know Halo had a championship series for the MCC but it had a horrible start due to connectivity and party joining issues.

A lot of people, youtubers, forums, etc. are blabbering on about the hires IW has made recently, with naughty dog employees, lead art director from Crystal Dynamics, etc. Don't you think it's a little too late for them to make any long term difference to this upcoming game? Which has been in development for three years now. I do and this is why I've been conjuring up a different theory.

I believe CoD 2016 will be a remastered trilogy of the Modern Warfare series. Why? Well with IW's recent job listings pertaining to Unreal engine 4, and various jobs that deal with environment, AI, etc. I figure IW is saving up for a big 2019. These recent hires they made should have a major impact by then Rather than now, 10 months away from their next release. I believe Tod Alderman, previous multiplayer head for the old IW was brought back for input in this trilogy, as a consultant of sorts, then left on his own terms.

Why a remastered trilogy? Well, what better way to bring back your numbers as a developer for a major franchise than bringing back its most beloved games, in HD, on current gen? It'll buy the developer more than enough time to change CoD forever, which is something they are used to with the introduction of CoD 4 in 2007. Unreal Engine 4 can change the franchise in ways we haven't seen, no more cut and paste year after year. IW could get away from the shadows of its past glory, and use the potential of these big resume hires for the next installment after 2016. 

I could be and most likely will be totally wrong, but hey everyone has been putting their input nowadays and I just see this as the most feasible option rather than reviving an old trilogy that was completely finished, or a sequel to the worst selling game of the franchise.

Examples:

•""maps don't feel especially designed to take advantage of the new movement mechanics""

Are you kidding? The amount of amazing clips I've gotten just by the manuevering in itself is absurd. The amount of routes one can take, at points not even needing take one step on the map because of the flanking available.

•""Black Ops 3's weapons either kill immediately or hit like frozen vegetables""

IMO, best gun variety since MW2. Honestly, Any gun is useable, and has a niche for everyone.

•""The traditional campaign mode, however, is a chore. It's a boring crawl through routine shooter fare""

I'm 3/4 of the way through campaign on realistic... It has chewed me up, and spit me out over and over again on the mind bending story alone. The meta game in playing realistic alone is such a great feeling and rewarding when a level is completed. The details are amazing, I've felt every emotion playing this campaign thus far.

•""black ops 3 doesn't meaningfully move the series forward""

Are you kidding me? Has anyone played the past two cods? This game has revived the fire in me. It is everything AW did wrong, done right. It is the result of a 3 year development cycle. &amp; Treyarch has done everything they could to make this a top tier cod, from necessary improvements to just little things that entitles a slow clap to Vahn.

Do not get me wrong. This game has been buggy, laggy, and glitchy. But I believe all of the good outweighs this and 2015-2016 will be a cod year to remember.

If it were up to me if rate this game a 9.5/10. 
(+)multiplayer is juggernaut again
(+)campaign is mind bending, and a fresh experience that is unrelenting.
(+)zombies is everything you'd expect 
(-) servers are a major con right now from what I see,but since it's the first couple of days I expect this to be no problem in the near future.
