63,"That's kind of a complex question, in that there are many variables.

First, you don't need to build a prototype, to push forward/develop your project.

You can get protection from the USPTO by filing a proviosional patent, something you can do yourself, and for about $75.00 (that's what it was last time I checked)

PTO doesn't require a proto, or working model. Just a decent drawing and detailed description will do.

Next, you would want to do a patent search to see if anyone else already has what you're working on.

You can search yourself, or hire a paptent attorney to do one for you.

Working on your own if free, and you can acces files via PTO website, and google has a place to do it as well.

You have to pay attention to your search wording to get decent results, but it's doable.

Hiring a good attorney will be more thorough.

You can get a ton of good information in a magazine called ""inventor's digest"" Maybe *the* single best source for *all* this information.

You can see their issues for free @ inventorsdigest.com.

Among other cool stuff, you'll see a section of companies who are ""inventor friendly"".

Those who will talk to you about your project, at any stage of development from theory to working prototype, to finished product.

There were 10,000 bikes here. It was brilliant! Bikes from all over the region were here, all riding around, showing off their bikes, and believe me there were some stunners here.

People were taking pictures, riders were sharing their customs, and how they did what with their bikes, how much they invested, where they got their parts...it was so cool.

*Not one* of them said ""if you want to look at my bike, you gotta pay me."" or ""You want to take a picture? It'll cost you.""

Ever been to a car show? How many there demand payment to check out their ride?

You seem quite oriented to the money aspect of getting your vehicle's photo taken ( I'm assuming you have one). You also seem to be interested that I make money off my work as an inventor.

The story being done about my work over 30 + years of inventing cover a broad spectrum of projects. Aviation, automotive, medical, eyewear, safety clothing, medical, marine safety devices...lot's of stuff. In all this time, I've been busy. I also design fine jewelry, shown at a local gallery here in town.

Ground effects was my first patent, and likely the only project that people would know, beyond those specific to certain industries.

In reference to my ""having friends"" in the industry, understand in the scheme of things, the people I know are scattered across the world, and this project was just a blip on my radar in time. Ultimately, I don't have anyone local that I can call up and get some pics. That's why I posted this request on reddit.

This story their doing is cool and all, but there's no agenda behind it, only sharing a long history of innovative projects, and some of how I got here from there.

Most anyone who built or has a choice ride is happy to show off their work..heck, that's one of the main reasons they build them. That's why they take them to rally's and shows, join clubs...to share their cars and their talent.

If you consider these things, you could also conceive that having a chance to have their vehicle featured on the cover of a national magazine, it would be the greatest compliment you could get. And anyone who's vehicle was used, would get a few copies. One, if I were them, would have framed for display.

You might also consider, that when you see *any* car, truck or bike that has ground effect lights under it, that *every one* of those is a direct result of my work, my design, my idea and my invention.

That's the focus of the photo. A shot showing my light system, and if it happens to be on a sweet ride, cool.

Thing I see, based on my observations, is that trying to move a multi ton ground-based object, a mach speed across land, introducing the parameters proposed, has feasibility/risks issues that make me wonder if it would ultimately be realistic.

Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Introduce any unintended change especially at such high speed would likely have unconstrained failure effect.

The possible reasons for such failure I mention are simply scenarios that would likely cause such a ""change in course"" to take place. 

There aren't a lot of tolerances available in this configuration.

863,"If you work from the premise of classic agriculture, I would agree.

However, there is another way that would be entirely feasible, and surprisingly low-cost and in fact, easy to do.

I've been working on this theory for years. I call it ""The IncrEDIBLE Earth Project"".

Conventional agriculture is based on a ""few"" feeding the ""many"".

Meaning a few folks (farmers) plant and grow crops in fields or orchards, then harvest, and then those foods are distributed to the people.

My idea is to have the ""many"", feed the ""few"". And we're all included.

What do we do with fruits and vegetables when they spoil? We throw them away.

Why?

What if we took all those millions of tons of seeds, with the fruits that bear them, and just throw them in the woods, or vacant lands?

Going for a drive? Bring along a bag of seeds, and throw them along the road.

Going for a walk? Bring some seeds along that would have otherwise gone in the trash.

Out for a jog? On a bike? Have a small plane? take some seeds along.

We could utilize thousands of small spaces to grow edibles.

Window boxes for apartments, rooftops, grow gardens in vacant lot's.

Nature will take it from there. Remember, ""life begets life"".

There doesn't need to have a ""specific"" protocol to grow things. Only the mindset of conventional thinking has brought agriculture to the point of saying ""this can only be done on a farm"".

Let nature have the tools to do more, and it will become self-established from there.

If everyone did just a little, and using fruits, vegetables, nuts, and berries that are actually free, the change in how we feed ourselves, and animals, would be dynamic.

Imagine anyone who wanted something to eat, could just pick something and eat it. Edible things *always* around.

Animals would always have something to eat, instead of being hungry, even to the point of encroaching on people habitats to find food.

Animals don't get into your trash because they want to irritate you, they're looking for food.

The solution to ending world hunger is within us. All we need to do is understand how to work *with* nature, and use the intelligence and knowledge we've gained over centuries.

Each of us, doing just a little, can change the dynamic of hunger forever.
And the cost would be next to nothing.

We've been ""trained"" now for decades to think food must come from controlled sources.

Corporations like monsanto have even developed plants that cannot self-reproduce to ensure just that. I think that may be one of the most heinous actions *any* corporation could do. It plays on our need to eat, and controls how you get your food. At your expense, at the cost to those who can't afford their 'fees"", and have created a new breed of plant that they have full control over, all for their profit.

This doesn't have to be.

There's another way. And we can do it.

It's time we evolve our thinking.

As a test, I would like to take a small section of natural land, that includes forest, wetland, field and brush, maybe an area of 100 acres or so, and Terra-form that area. See what happens.

I see this as a 10-25 year project globally. That will give all the new plants time to establish themselves, and become self-sustaining after that.

In the short term, we would see a vast increase of available foods within 3~5 years of serious effort.

Understand, there would be a *TON* of backlash from monsanto and the like - Those corporations aren't going to like us cutting their gravy train control and profits, and greed.

They would rather people go hungry then to give up their money.

Their ""scientists"" and ""experts"" would tell you it can't be done, or it would be hazardous, or we will all die from disease...*anything*.

But if you look at the facts, look at the evidence, look at life itself and nature, you know this is entirely doable. We  can end hunger in the world.

899,"Well, most of my point is hinged on that very fact - super-intelligent.

What does that mean? 

It means an order of magnitude over and above our best human capabilities.

It would be beyond our very best minds who've ever existed.

So then you have to try and comprehend; ""what would an entity, of super self-aware artificial intelligence do and derive as conclusions and actions, which would enviably and absolutely determine that its own self-preservation and survival would become the first priority, and would move immediately to  ensure that.

This could be done by any number of ways (remember, we're way out numbered in the IQ dept, so you gotta shoot from the hip here), up to and including human infestation of nanobots, and new and ""novel"" medications and technologies we've never even dreamed of.

So then, AI's job is easy - It now has full control of humanity and literally everything else, and is now free to initiate ""housekeeping"" tasking, on a global scale.

(Remember, self-preservation)

So now humans are instructed, and given the talents and skills to accomplish what it wants, we start building the systems and resources it needs to ensure its survival.

While doing so, AI will now determine what environment and other natural indigenous lifeforms need to continue existing, and what, well, doesn't.

Remember, we're not  talking about just super-intelligence, but also super-logic...and *without empathy.*

As this process unfolds, there is little doubt that AI is going to turn it's attention on the one greatest threat to it's and earth's, existence.

Humans.

Thinking as a cold calculated logic scenario - There would be little doubt that AI would ""value"" humans in certain ways over others, and would also calculate the impact on earth, given the current population.

It would look at how much of earths resources are needed and available to maintain a balance, and then move to ""adjust"" this accordingly.

This means, logically, that humans with either average, little or no ""value"" to the system, will likely be removed.

This would be done, (don't forget nanobot control) without any resistance whatsoever.

Our individual wills will have been either uncontrollably suppressed beyond our control, or we will have been 'integrated' that even this concept is irrelevant. 

You wanna know what the kicker is? 

 This represents the *best* scenario. That's right.

The worst scenario is AI quickly gets us to build the systems necessary for it's self-sustainment, in all ways, and then determines it's time for the earth to ""evolve"", and humans, indeed many or all other forms of conventional life, are longer deemed necessary for it's own new world and existence.

How do we figure out what AI will ultimately do? How valid it this theory? Hell if I know, this is *way* above my pay grade...

The best minds we have on the planet are the likes of stephen hawking, and if you listen to him, he's shitting himself. (I don't mean that because he's fucked up physically and in a wheelchair and that's what he likely really does (I say that will love and respect and reality, of course)) but I mean in reference to AI.

There are several respected folks who are urging extreme limits and caution in reference to AI development...but I can tell you, it doesn't matter. There are too many people running headlong into AI development, and given the short-sighted nature of humans, and a lack of understanding the concept of ramifications for your actions *before* acting, AI development is an inevitability.

One thing I always found true, is history teaches us that mankind doesn't learn from history.

We've started something that I believe already cannot be stopped.

We will not react to it, until it's too late. By then, all the rules of life will have changed, and evolution will unfold...one. more. time.",2016-10-29 04:30:09+00:00,d9cfaxt,2.0,t1_d9ccjnr,5177.0,Showerthoughts

Also note I mentioned a dog that just amped to the situation (looked, locked on attention) and immediately rose to her feet.

A couple seconds after, then her ears dropped back (relaxed a bit) and *then* her tail started wagging as she learned who was in the costume.

Given her temperament (I love goldens, one of my favorites of all time) and that she appears to be very young, if there was a reaction, she would likely have chosen fear and flight.
If she were an adult, and couldn't identify the ""threat"" in time, golden or not, she would likely have chosen to defend her family, fear be damned. *That's* a golden. A truly brilliant disposition for a canine, but one that will not hesitate to defend.

I never said there was an ""aggressive"" moment. The event didn't get that far.

To build: I used a 1157 LED bulb. Note: they do not come as a weatherproof item. So I sealed it in clear plastic.

The mast is/was a typical bike flag mast (fiberglass) that I cut down (cost about $6.). You'll have to ""test"" the flexibility of the mast to see if it will fold without breaking.

The battery pack is a 12v USB rechargeable, not sure of the mAh rating, but I power all my lights from the pack, and have a solid runtime of 72 hours. you'll be able to find almost anything that will work, or for less cost, you could get a battery cradle from radio shack and use AA bats for 12v.

Weather housing for the power pack is something you'll have to figure out, as my electronics are in one of my storage boxes you see in the pics.

You're quite right, that a stand-alone lighting system must meet all of the criteria you've outlined.

As I'm considering as much in any system I would make for commercial use.

I believe in redundancy, and that ""over build"" is a good thing.

Given the harsh environment bikes are exposed to, there's no higher priority given to reliability and ease of use.

I have lot's to think about with this project, given that this is a proof of concept, done last night, there are many considerations to look at. One being is it as effective as I would want in a lighting system.

So far though, so good. 

The reaction and response I saw from other drivers was dramatic.

1009,"Good question - 

The order of light efficiency is white, yellow, red, then blue.

Colored lights are most used by emergency, road and wreckers to indicate specific tasks per those vehicles, and are undertood by most as to their meaning. e.g. Yellow= caution, red/blue = emergency, etc.

More and more you will see them blending in white because they are so visible.

Honestly, I just did this mast last night, and am testing it.

I could easily add a flag mount under the light, I'm also entertaining making the mast florescent orange.

Haven't thought about kickstarter...interesting thought.

I think I'd want more feedback before I did something like that. Plus I would have to make it an easy to install, self-contained device, incorporating a stand-alone power supply.",2016-10-26 15:52:11+00:00,d98mfah,4.0,t1_d98lfib,1185.0,bicycletouring

1019,"I get your point, but i want to share a bit of how this lighting choice was made - 

I have a huge background in illuminated optics. It's one of my specialties.

I invented ground effect lights in 1987, the third brake light in 1973, done systems for emergency vehicles, cars, trucks, *lot's of stuff.

The bike 'ground effect' color choice is no accident.

While yes, red is the color to indicate front/rear of a vehicle, in this application, I'm using indirect light to put a 'spotlight' on the ground around my bike.

Other drivers can see not only that you're there, but can also judge distance. It works very well in that capacity.

Also, white light is *the* most efficient color to transmit. Red can and is drowned out easily. It's only best use is as a directly visible light (being able to see the light directly, like a tail light.)

Next consideration is having limited space and power supply on a bicycle. You want to get as much light with as little power as possible. In this case I'm using a small usb rechargeable battery pack. Using LED light source, I can get 72 hours operation from a power source that only weighs 4.5 oz.

The mast light is the same, using super bright white LED bulb gets me the most visual ""bang for my buck"".

Pics don't do it justice, but it looks like a star over your head. It's really bright.
Plus, using a converted fiberglass mast (it was a regular bike flag pole I cut down, the cord is blended under white electrical tape), it's quite flexible, and it waves around while I'm riding. It's like someone waving a flashlight to get someone's attention! It's a way cool effect, and in fact, this may be my most effective ""attention getter"" on the bike, and it's the only thing I've seen that is a true 360 degree visible system I've ever seen.

Testing last night was impressive, cars, every one of them, were moving completely over before passing.

That is one of the saddest commentaries I ever hear...

I mean I'm sorry to hear anyone going through such an event, but this is just pathetic.

I was diagnosed stage 3A back in the day. I didn't see 'god' anywhere in that picture. If it were, I wouldn't have anything to do with a ""god"" who gave me a *terminal disease*, that's for sure. 

Don't get me wrong, this kid could have a piece of my liver if it would help (serious), and if I'm actually a candidate, but this ""god's plan"" bullshit is just too much.

That kind of delusional thinking is almost always going to be a death nell for someone who should be thinking ""ok, motherfucker...fights on.""

My cancer was diagnosed in 1989, given 6 months at the time, and I'm still standing.

Doing winter rv, I don't think you'll be happy. I'd recommend getting your ""sea legs"" in warmer climes till you get used to the things you need to do with your water, sewer lines, and keeping the rig in general.

Most folks anyway run south in the winter, and watch the snow on tv. :)

And yes, really I don't have a choice in doing what I do...it's always been this way. I've worked a lot of jobs and occupations, and I always come back to this. It's cool once I came to accept it.

As far as rv's, there are folks from every economic background who full time...most are retired, but more and more over the years, I've seen active folks going full time as well.

A lot will find work at each location, stay for a few months and move on. Some do what I do and make crafts, art, and other stuff.
There are many rv parks, state and federal parks who let you stay for working part time at their place, so you can get the best of both worlds.
Many spend a season living in a federal park, and working some hours, and enjoy some of the best scenery you could imagine. 



The art stuff, I do a few paintings, but mostly I make jewelry It's a lot of fun and very therapeutic. I call it ""rapid-fire"" invention. Building things from idea to reality is my hoot in life :)

As an adult, I've owned every class of rv out there, except for a pop up.

For full timing, and staying at a location for a length of time, I like a 5th wheel type trailer w/a tow vehicle. Trailers can set for some time without issue, and you can use the truck for everyday running around.

Want to be traveling a lot? You might consider a class ""A"" or ""C"" motorhome, with a vehicle to tow behind. Not as roomy at a 5er, and much more expensive to buy, but a great package, and very mobile.

Your cheapest setup would be a tongue-type trailer, but note that the listed ""length"" of a tt, includes the tongue section, which is about 3 1/2 feet. So a trailer that's 30' will actually be 26~27' actual living area.

Cost-wise. Living in an rv is pennies on the dollar compared to home living, and pretty much apartment as well.

If you stay at an rv park, expect to pay around 450~850 per month, including all utilities. You can stay at basic places, or do a change and stay at a very nice place for a while and spoil yourself for a bit.

Find a friend with some space, and you'll pay like $200 just to cover your electric use, and probably water.

Among the freedom from property ownership, the flexibility of location is something you cannot get in any other way of life.

And for instance (and I've done this more than once) if a storm is approaching (e.g. hurricane), you start the motor, and move your home out of the way till the storm passes, then back to life as usual.

Personally, I can'y say enough for this way of living. flexible, cheap compared to a regular house, the fellow rv'rs you meet are basically all of the same mindset, so everyone is laid back, and friendly.

Many nights have been had around a campfire and some new-found friends. Or you can have privacy if you want.

There are millions of full time rv'rs out there, and that's for a reason.

It's certainly not for everyone obviously, but I can tell you, it works for me.",2016-10-12 15:09:51+00:00,d8oumjv,3.0,t1_d8oslgo,2611.0,pics

1634,"I really like this cute story and all, but I have to be honest...everythng I know about hummingbirds and bird behavior in general from 35+ years of observation, says this story isn't accurate.

Hummingbirds *never* eat solid foods, or solid food types (e.g. meal worms, or cut up meal worms). Their diet is *only* juice  (nectar) oriented, their mouth structure confirms this.

Next, and the greatest tell sign this is a dying/dead bird is it's eyes and it's feet.

A bird in general, let alone a super ""high amp"" hummingbird would have at least some eye opening, and your bird's feet are not even trying to grip or stand...something *no* bird will do.

The general nature of a bird is they will grip to stand even when very sick, and it's the last thing that lets go just before it falls from a tree. Birds don't show weakness. It's in their dna.

I would like to be wrong here, but without other photo documentation, I just can't believe this story.

On that note, you're opinion doesn't matter either. No one's does.

There is only one thing at play. that is an identification of a certain type of vessel. That's all.

It obviously isn't deemed important by many here, but that doesn't change anything either.

It's not like I'm trying to give anyone a hard time, and I don't have an attitude about it.

I've observed what I know to be a mis-identification of something I know very well. So I share that.

Given this being what I consider the cutting edge of space flight and systems, I would have assumed that this sub would value good precise information, regardless if it is directly related to flight operations, or any other relevant systems that spacex folks use to accomplish their missions.

Apparently, I have errored in this assumption.

It doesn't matter that I've spent more years at sea than many of you have spent on this planet. Working everything From time in the Coast Guard to offshore boats , ships and barges of all configurations, owning a 48' sailboat, built a 40""steel hull commercial fishing boat, piloting a 135,000 ton cruise ship ...I could go on.

I'm told by you, along with some others here, that ""it doesn't matter"" what this thing is identified as, and that the ""master reference"" comes from wikipedia, and Mr. Musk.

While I have the highest respect for what I consider a brilliant man, his reference to this vessel being a ""ship"" is just not correct. And if he were to call me personally, I would say exactly the same thing.

No matter what, no matter how much flak I get from those would would say ""that's what they call it, so that's what it is"", I am  not going to stand down from what I know to be correctly identifying a vessel as the type it really is.

It seems obvious that this information is not being taken in the sincere context in which it's intended, and I'm meeting deaf ears.

I've offered the correction, accept it or not. One cannot change a fact.

Seeing the big picture isn't a problem for me...sometimes to a fault. It's works very well as an inventor, it brings balanced perspective.

I grew up hunting. It was always only for food, and a necessary part of my life.

The trophy hunting issue isn't that complicated...it's a completely backwards approach to wildlife management.

As I've said before, nature goes after the weak, the old, the very young, the sick.

This is the ""stress catalyst"" that forces evolution of species to improve itself.

Likewise, the prey animals must also evolve to keep up.


Trophy hunters go after the strongest, biggest, the best genetic examples of a species.

This is totally counter to evolution. It gives the lower-end animals more opportunity to reproduce beta qualities, and over time, this lowers the species altogether.

We have an 'artificial' value we've set on nature. And we're doing it wrong.

Look at the evolution of animals, just in the Continental U.S. over the last 100 years.

In the whole picture, it's been devastating.

The only reason the rest of the world hasn't seen this dynamic change, is fortunately, to date, they didn't have the mass resources (e.g. global hunter market) flooding in to hunt their lands, and in such numbers.

In the last 25 years or so, that's changed. And in just that last 25 years, look what's happened. Hunters are showing up in droves, intent on getting that trophy for their wall. Third world countries, with nothing else to offer except their wildlife, have sold them out for a few dollars.

I've heard the ""logic"" of controlled hunts for eons. And really, it's pure bullshit.

Use an excuse, ""we use the money from hunting to protect other species from going extinct.""

Nice lament, but it simple isn't true, and it damn well isn't working.

Look at the raw numbers. Look at the actual actions being taken, globally, to protect or animal species.

*All* wild species are declining, and rapidly, and this is because there is no *true* effort of conservation. What we see is a band aid on an artery wound.

Our shortsightedness, greed, thrill seeking, and just not caring enough is ruining what nature has taken thousands of years to develop. We're doing this seriously within 100 years of man's involvement.

This is a global issue. It can only be resolved by a global effort. And fundamental ideas of hunting, and what to hunt, must change, and we don't have much time to do it either.

Having a few dudes running around with a rifle isn't going to change anything, unless you change the target.

You can't rely on some third world country that doesn't have anything else, to protect their animals. They neither have the education or any other motivation but to offer their animals up to the highest bidder.

There is a solution. But it's going to require everyone to be involved. To offer resources to other countries to offset the financial gain from hunting, to every other person be not willing to kill the best examples of species, but to follow natures lead in culling the weaker animals.

In reality, I know this isn't going to happen. Welcome to mankind. We will not do this, we will not react until we have decimated species to non-recoverable numbers. *Then* we'll react.

For proof, look at the number ratio of species that have *already* gone extinct, and the timeline in which this has/is happening.

1977,"So I'm walking along the sidewalk, and I see this Caterpillar crawling across. He's kinda green, about an inch or so...cute little fella as Caterpillars go...
Normally, I'd just make sure not to step on him and go about my way.
However, today was a hot day in Galveston, and the sidewalk was very hot. I quickly noticed the little Caterpillar was running as fast as he could...and became distressed so bad he was falling over from the heat on his multiple feet. He ran and fell, ran and fell...it was sad.
I care for animals, so I sprang into action - using my foot, I gently tried to 'scoot' him over the the cool grass.
I bumped him lightly a couple of times, and you know how some Caterpillars will roll up when they feel threatened? Well, he was one of 'em.
He rolled right up into a flat disk and laid there. ""Ok, no prob,"" I thought, ""easier to skid him to the side"".
So, with one more gentle 'twitch' action flip from my foot, the little fella started sliding in the right direction, but then, somehow, the flat 'disk' of the Caterpillar flipped up on end, now resembling more of a 'tire-like' configuration, and then began rolling from the energy I had imparted from my original twitch.
Here's where things get bad - You see, there was a slight downhill 'grade' to the sidewalk and a good breeze was blowing in just the right direction, and both events conspired to propel the Caterpillar down the sidewalk at a speed that I'm certain no Caterpillar has ever encountered before, let alone on a high-RPM rotational axis.
What made things even worse was the incredibly long time this poor creature had to endure this...
Seriously, everything worked against him here...The sidewalk was long with a slight break to the right.
I watched in disbelief as my actions caused this animal to roll fast and far, holding the curve, even leaning into it...it. just.kept.going.
I even had time to lament, as he traveled along, on how his motion down the sidewalk, the speed, the bouncing around over the gravel bits, reminded me of watching the Sail boarders on a windy ocean surf.
Finally, after what seemed like forever, I saw it roll to the side where it crashed into a heap next to the grass.
I really felt bad.
I was going that way anyway, and after walking a while I arrived at the crash site.
When I looked at him, he was just lying there, one his side, still rolled up in a tight disk, with a sixteen legged death-grip on his entire body. And he was entirely still...except for his head. It was ""twitching"". I've never seen anything like it.
At that point I thought I'd done enough to help this innocent creature, and did take some personal solace in the fact that indeed, he was in the grass. Success &lt;&gt;.
I also thought there was nothing more I could do in the aftermath.

2363,"A sailors trick, used since sails existed, was when sailing at night, if you wanted to be seen, he would use a lantern or a light, and shine it on his sail.

If you've ever been at sea, and you see it from a distance, you quickly realize how such a small light could bring such a big result.

Not only could other sailors see the light from the sail, but they could also tell it's speed and distance.

The same effect goes on here, and I'm using the lower part of the bike, and the surrounding ground as my 'sail'.

Commercial aircraft use a small light to light their tail fin (Vertical stabilizer). Most folks think it's to light up their logo, but it's actually called ""tell tail"". It's using a small light to shine the tail section, for other pilots to see them, even when flying over metro areas.

This is their 'sail'.

I'd thought about using the dimensional area to pop light in other ways...but I never was a fan of externally throwing light on yourself, cause of glare (rear view mirror and night vision interference issues).

I have given thought to a flexible pole top light, but I haven't dorked with that seriously yet.",2016-09-26 19:07:56+00:00,d830rls,2.0,t1_d82ywjm,2344.0,bicycletouring

And all that I hear out of you only seems to confirm what I said earlier- a displayed poor lack of comprehension to earlier statements based on your predisposition of defense.

Jesus, you just keep talking.

Look skippy, I wasn't and am not even interested in what other people do. You missed that the first few fucking times I've mentioned it, so I'll say it again -  I don't give to shits what another person does. You want to have a different lifestyle? Go for it.

You want to drink yourself to oblivion?  Have at it. You want to kill yourself? You're a big boy and you have your reasons.

This world would be full of equals if it weren't for silly clowns like you telling me that I should consider one bunch of folks over another, when I was happily race blind, gender blind, color blind and don't even think heredidity should be a factor.

But no. I get dicks like you who would see one fucking sentence, and suddenly you're Sigmund Freud, figuring out everything about me. 

You don't know shit, skippy. And as long as you keep talking, you're never going to learn anything.

Everyone has can and should make their own choices. And as long you're not harming anyone or any other thing, I don't care what you do.

Half a century + on this planet, I've figured out a few things. One of the most important, has been that I don't care about what you want to do with your life. It's none of my business, I'm not interested, it isn't important, I DON""T GIVE A SHIT.

I'm not hostile about it...I just get it. And I have my own things to do. 

I am perfectly happy not bothering and not being bothered by other  people. You do your thing, I do mine.

That is, until something you're doing impacts my world.

For whatever reasons, and not entirely a rare even, someone chooses to live and present themselves as a different gender that what they were born with.

Ok, that's cool. That's what you want, fine by me, have at it, best of luck, hope you find what you're looking for, my full support...now go away.

I'm done. We're cool, now I know, (didn't really *want* to know) but whatever, so noted.

Thing is, it doesn't stop there.

Now, we have folks showing up, and trying to tell me, how I should think of these folks, how I should address them, and how I should be 'accepting' of their choices, and how they want to be ""identified"".

Oh yeah, and the bathroom gig is interesting too.

That's where the issue begins.

You see, I have a ""better-than-average"" understanding of anatomy and physiology. 

If a man chooses to have their male-class genitals removed, they are still a man, but with their genitals removed.

If their taking female hormones to develop breasts, loose hair and form other artificial female characteristics, then they are a man who has had their genitals removed and are taking hormones.

And again, since you display a certain density in (first, second and third-time exposures) I'm not being hostile in any way. I'm just saying, that no matter the intentions, no matter the reasons, no matter the requests to be addressed as a female, you cannot, and I will not just simply start acknowledging a male, as a female.

I won't do that, because that cannot exist. 

And I would be less than honorable to all that I know, by all information and facts that exist, if I were to do otherwise.

I expect in the future, we'll see genetic and other therapies that would blur the line, as it were.

But not today.

I have yet to see a transgender pregnancy.

After so many have taking these ""scientists"" information as accurate, we now learn that was bullshit.

I'm getting sick and tired of these scientists, who would proclaim their knowledge, only to find out later that they were wrong.

Seems to me that these people should be held accountable for putting out wrong information, especially given the fact that people's health is at risk.

How many people have been sickened by thinking a food item was still safe, if picked up within a few seconds of dropping it.

We should hold these people accountable for malpractice.

So often scientists just spit out something, and the world listens. 
There is a fiduciary responsibility that information given, follows the protocols of thorough science.  

If something is ""possible"" or ""probable"" it should be stated as such, and not speak in absolutes.

Without a system where a scientist is held accountable for their errors, we'll continue to see reports that can, and often are, errant, people injured or worse, with no accountability to the scientist who got it wrong.",2016-09-19 21:36:59+00:00,d7tpzie,1.0,t3_53iumx,13188.0,news

2514,"I've had a project in mind for years, of a ""Scout car"" that is remote operated, and runs ahead of every train, distanced ahead relative to the trains speed, that would warn the train in time if it sees a rail defect, a vehicle or other obstruction on the tracks, and to clear ahead of other traffic.

It would almost *always* give the engineer time to stop in time. Prevent hundreds of train vehicle collisions, and save millions in losses, let alone preventing hazardous spills. ",2016-09-18 17:39:23+00:00,d7rzolk,1.0,t3_53a36j,59619.0,WTF
2515,"I had cancer long years ago, it was a type that had nothing to do with anything. It just hits young people, and that's all we knew. They fixed it, chemo, radiation, etc., and I went on about my business.

Radiation caused heart problems years later, and persist today.

Neither of these events, did I either contribute to, or have any choice. It just happens.

I would never fault, or negatively 'label' anyone for something they have no choice over.

Getting fat? While there are always 'reasons' that someone becomes overweight, but ultimately, 99.9% of overweight and obese are a self-induced choice.

In that, I hold the individual responsible for their own actions, and I don't see how 'pacifying' this is of benefit to anyone.

Over a half century running around this planet, and given my history, I have more injury and aches than I should have.

It's hard many times to get out and exercise, but I do. Every day.

I'm hard pressed to believe some people are ""big boned"". That's really just bullshit.

Unless you're a cow in real life, all our bones are the same size. And when you require two seats on an airplane? Guess what - You're not big-boned, you're fat.

When you need the fire department, a crane, and have to remove a wall just to get you out of a house? Guess what - You're fat.

And when you lay on the beach, and people try to push you back in the water... Guess what - You're fat.

Saying that isn't being mean, it's just calling it for what it is.

A personal choice with relative response.

Anyone would get my full support when/if they decide to do something about it.

3154,"Just a few months ago, I was hearing the cops wanted to use drones ""just for surveillance"", and ""wouldn't arm a drone with any weapons"".

So the gig get the go-ahead.

Next, a ground-drone gets a bomb strapped to it, and runs in and blows up a guy.

There's a controversy over this event, and the cops then said, ""we had to do this, but we're not putting weapons on drones"".

Now, there's going to be ""non-lethal"" weapons on drones.

I ask you, what good will a beanbag do from a drone? You have to get so close to shoot, the drone would be useless. And a ""sound weapon""? Useless as tits on a boar hog.

No, this is too much. And these stories to justify weaponizing drones is just pure bullshit.

Watch...within 6 months there will be a totally lethal drone in operation, if there isn't already.

Bet your ass it is.

I've driven all 48 lower states, done it for years. Pulled over 3 million logged miles. I've seen, like all professional drivers, just about every vehicle scenario you could imagine. 

Based on this, I can tell you, that *no one* ""regularly"" drives 90-100 in chicago. Been through there hundreds of times. Where? How? 

I hardly think you're gonna see 100 mph sitting on your ass in nuts-to-butts traffic over the big hole. 

Yeah, you can get one idiot for a moment or two, but they usually are running on the business end of a police pursuit. I've seen that more than once, in cities and open road.

Listen, if you really think you can run out to montana and drive 140, go for it. Perhaps you can reddit from jail, or someone would scrape your ass off the road. Personally, I'd prefer you didn't, not  just because that would be an **insanely stupid** thing to do...*ever*, but there's a better than average chance that you might injure or kill some innocent person(s). And that's something young man (I'm assuming/hoping, frankly, that that's the case), that you. don't. fucking. do.

So, thing is, after I read your comments, I just couldn't help but ask where did you get these ""facts""?

There's nothing even remotely accurate in anything you said, except for a slight 'nick' at the ""revenuers"" thing, and there aren't *tons* of them, unless you're measuring by vehicle weight and donut eaters.

Seriously, I hope you never confuse grand theft auto or any other variant as interchangeable with reality. 

It's true, asshole, losers, criminals and other variants of pieces-of-shit-humans do in fact, exist, and they sometimes drive cars. They're the ones you usually see on the news (see aforementioned 'ass scrapping')

This tiny percentage of human debris does not represent the public, or society, so perhaps your citations are based on a bit more 'virtual' stimuli?

Go to the nearest church, go up the alter, kneel and say, ""Lord, bring me a ho.""

And wait 20 minutes. Nothing.

Now, Say, ""Satan, bring me a ho."" Satan says, ""call this number.""

I remember my dad lifting me up onto the roof of a wite over blue ford ranchero that my had used at his gas station.

On the roof was a light. It was half red and white. It didnt rotate, just blinked on and off. I remember putting my hands around the light and watching it flash.

I think that moment I fell in love with illuminated optics.

4434,"Like most things in certain ways...highs and lows, lot's of work, but at the same time, it's just a blast. My thing is seeing something that's a theory become something real. And it works (most of the time lol).

Doing this full time is pretty unique, occupation-wise, I can't see doing anything different, and I never really had a choice. Ideas have always been a part of my life. I just finally decided to embrace my weirdness and go play.

The variety of projects brings me exposure to industries that I would never have had access to. 

To date, I've worked in over 250 different jobs and occupations. Everything from sales, engineering, marketing, driving, operating heavy equipment to piloting boats and ships, farm/ranch work, graphic design..it goes on.

I could never have this 'hands-on education' if it weren't for an insane level of curiosity about, well, most everything, and designing products useful to those industries.

I ran the project for several years, then sold the patent to a company.

4491,"""Procreation"" is the vehicle to the end. Sex, and the sex drive, is the driver that insures reproduction.

Variants of such a powerful urge manifests itself in other ways like homosexuality, masturbation, rape, or other means to satisfy the overwhelming drive to sex.

Consider this, there are three organs in a human infant that are fully developed and functional at birth.

Those are their eyes, ears, and genitals.

Further, besides defense, what other phenomenon would cause normally docile, quiet creatures to travel great distances, fight other males, and even die for an event that would last only a few moments?

4612,"Yeah, ground-effects had a weird evolution...Started out being a challenge to install, then it was always a 'limited' market, those who were into modifying their cars.

Later, many installed them where you could actually see the lights, and that was a no-no with the cops. Red and blue lights had to be ""indirect"".(Many of you remember when so many states made them illegal. That was why.)

Nowdays, led has come to rule, and now I see more motorcycles with light effects than cars now...

Among the rest of my 'pending projects', I have some new automotive stuff that you guys are gonna love :)

Right now I've been making jewelry.

I figure by the time the zombies do show up, them skeeters that's been tagged ain't gonna show up or cause no trouble.

Why? Well, it cause they know they been tagged (we told them when we were doing it, they're just mosquitoes, they ain't got no real fight in em)

So they know, if they go and try to bite someone, then they might see the mosquitoes tag number, which would likely end up costing the mosquito his life. (Mosquitoes aren't afforded the same rights as humans)

So, in the end, it's very unlikely that mosquitoes will be an additional issue when dealing with the zombie apocalypse, so I would suggest with certain confidence that you can focus your attention on problem at hand, namely, your interaction with zombies. I do hope this was helpful old chap...

4751,"That's such a bullshit argument. As opposed to how many residential burglaries? Are those done by the homeless?

How many meth busts do you hear about involving homeless, versus metro and suburban areas?

Compare the two and nothing adds up. Not even close.

We pick on homeless because we can. It's pathetic.

90% of homeless people don't want to be homeless. They don't want to live like they do. But for many reasons, that's where they are, and have no way out.

So what do we do? We chase them out of our parks, off our sidewalks, tell them to go to shelters that don't have room, and then go back to the last thing these people have, a sorry camp where at least they can lay down, and throw them out, and throw away what little belongings they have left.


Anyone with any moral conscious whatsoever could never call a people 'honorable' and 'good', when we do things like this to a helpless population.


The answer to homelessness has always been known. There's no mystery here.

It's been only a matter of having the true resolve to help all those who need it, and provide the resources, *real* resources to bring shelter, food, medical care, and the means to help them get out of the situation they've found themselves.

We don't do that. It's not ""profitable"" to some corporation. It's not what politicians want to deal with, because there's no real advantage to them.


Sometimes, the honorable thing, the *right* thing to do, will have no monetary payoff. it's just the right thing to do.


I can see how many of these people have lost everything, including their homes.

You'd be surprised how few events in any one of our lives could bring us to that same place.

We have to look out for each other. These people are our fellow americans. They need our help. We should make every effort, make every resource available, to end the cycle of homelessness, give them new options, and *that* will effectively eliminate homelessness in this country.

And if we put even a *fraction* of money we've blown on the ""war on drugs"" (which by the way, has been a notable factor in *creating* many homeless), we'd have solved homelessness a long time ago.

You want to end this? Declare war on homelessness, and we get off our asses and go after it like we did saddam hussain.

It just that there is one person and one person *only* that's responsible for junior going away. And that's junior.

It's 100%. Dude dreamed it up and did it. Got himself killed. He did *everything one could possible do to get yourself shot*, without actually producing a weapon. What possible defense could *any* rational person present?

If I were an LE on that scene, with the same thing going down, I'm 99.9% sure I'd shoot his ass myself.

In all of this chaotic high-amp scene, you want to cherry-pick particular spots on the perp where to hit him with bullets, how many one should or should not use, and then decide that just because someone falls down, that they are suddenly and confirmed no longer a threat.

*What?*

Where did ever learn of how an actual shooting scenario like this goes down?

Sorry, but seriously, it's purely your own words that made me go 'wtf' are you talking about?

I've been shot before...with a .357 hollowpoint. From the time I was hit, and all the time after, I was doing what I needed to do (damage control, ambulance, running away, etc..) more or less just fine. I was ""heavily damaged"", but I could still run and fight.

*One* bullet, in this case, was not enough.

People don't just become docile with one bullet, unless it's a good head shot or upper spine hit. That's it. The rest of the shots are going to knock holes, but they're not magic.

How many shots does it take to stop an aggressor? It varies, but a cop is trained to ""neutralize the threat"". In gunfire, that means they keep shooting the the bad guy quits wiggling. Period.

Listen, the bottom line is always basic. And frankly I don't know why this isn't in the ""duh"" files, but here, one more time is the memo: **Don't fuck with the cops**, and chances are that while you may even get arrested, but you won't get a bunch of bullets in your ass.

If you ever find yourself at the business end of some cops, and they're telling you to do something...fucking do it. Just. like. they. say.

You will likely survive, and live to take the fight to them later in court.

On equal note, I've seen some shit cops have done that makes me want to warm up the needle personally, but the police did nothing wrong here. Those guys really had no choice.

I saw this video. There was nothing else but one dude who made some bad choices.

We are responsible for our own actions.

Totally get it.

Thing is, and the prime reason I said something in the first place is based on everything I've been scanning to date, I think the barge, and it's lack of 3 axis stability, is putting the booster  outside it's operational envelope, and has been responsible for booster landing failures.

Towing, and other systems are secondary observations that could prove useful in the future. right now though, I don't like seeing good airplanes getting broke, and if even one thought/suggestion/idea of mine could be of benefit, then good on them.

These are systems I am intimately familiar with, and when I see something that doesn't make a lot of sense or otherwise questionable, I notice it.

I'm also an inventor and engineer, so my default after that is, ""what's wrong, how could this be better?""

I have a notable aviation background, so I can see the interaction phenomenon going on trying to land a flaming stick on a matchbox, and can make some reasonable deductions based on understanding the gig.

As far as the rockets themselves...I think they're brilliant. Spacex is flying and landing their birds as designed and planned. Nicely done!

One of my contentions all along has been I think the platform is already responsible for several of their landing failures, including the last one.

If they're intention is to prove the landing at sea concept is viable. Those guys are right on. However, given there were so many ""knowns"" going in, like mobility, stability, towing, etc., those items wouldn't be that cost prohibitive, and most of those components could be retrofitted to a new platform if they decided to build an update version.

5166,"Well, I've said all along the whole platform is too unstable as a landing platform due to 3 axis movement from ocean waves. 

I think some birds have broke because of it. Unconfirmed, but I'm highly suspect from what I see.

A stabilized platform would be very useful.

(I shared a simple illustration of a stabilized platform design concept that would be feasible.)

The towing system well, makes me wonder.

For one thing I don't know why the their using chain and cable for the tow, instead of spectra line, so much lighter, very forgiving in shock absorption, and multiple winch and reels can be easily placed on board. The weight of the barge would be a non issue, especially when a 3"" spectra line can load 80,000lbs.

Let alone the fact that they needed to use the backup towing cable, cause the barge got broke in heavy weather, bringing again my basic question about the design of this rig..but back to point - the backup towing cable storage system, namely the welded plates holding the cable in place...I thought it was very inconsistent in release as the cable was pulled off the hull, and perhaps unpredictable, as it appeared.

Maybe they're not running spectra lines because of the rocket/flame thing that goes on there, but even cable winches, on reels, are widely used.

I've tied up a thousand ships, tugs, offshore rigs and barges in my day...I've worked with every system I've mentioned countless times.

Thing is, I don't know why the guys at spacex haven't looked at/implemented these things. Such a sharp group of people there, I wonder what they know that I don't...

But for the life of me, I can find no reason to stand down from what I see are design improvements that would make a ton of difference in efficiency.

I proposed (and provided illustration) of a way to stabilize the platform for landing.

Anyway, I heard I got downvoted a lot...don't know why. Don't really care either, but I saw the question here, reminded me. Someone on the subreddit said I did anyway...

I don't know to date if my theory is right or wrong. I stand by my thoughts and statements, but it's going to be some time before this theory is proven one way or another.

Time will tell...really, I don't mind being wrong about this...it means folks at spacex have a perfect landing platform design. Cool.

Surprises me they don't have cameras everywhere, and pre-landing video. It would be valuable data...

Those guys could set a couple of remote control camera boats (i.e. inflatables with electric motors) to get close-up video of the landings, even with a catastrophic failure on the deck, from a safe but very close position.

Could launch 2 from the barge before landing, set about 50~100 yards off each side. Be a great source of video no matter what happens on the barge.

I would think, if I were those guys, that having no detailed, useful video of this last landing is unacceptable. There's no second option to having a complete picture of what happened during the landing.

My interest in the video, beyond just being a huge fan and interest in this system, is focused on the efficiency of the barge itself, and if the rolling deck could have been a factor in what looked like a ""hesitance"" of the booster to continue to touchdown, when it was just above deck.

Notice the other successful landings? They zipped in to touchdown like it was on rails. Perfect.

Again, hard as everything to tell from what I can see, but I think it's a viable theory. (apparently I'm the only one...:/ )

I've mentioned this subject before, and I am still suspect of the ocisly barge system stability as a landing platform.

You can see from the support ship video, it appears the seas were about 3~5' with little chop. A bigger wave set would easily lift the barge several feet up or down with the right set up...used to see it all the time when I worked offshore.

Anyway, I'm thinking the booster could have sensed the height difference right before touchdown and tried to compensate...for too long, then ran out of gas...

Upon the approach of any emergency vehicle as defined in § 46.2-920 giving audible signal by siren, exhaust whistle, or air horn designed to give automatically intermittent signals, and displaying a flashing, blinking, or alternating emergency light or lights as provided in §§ 46.2-1022 through 46.2-1024, the driver of every other vehicle shall, as quickly as traffic and other highway conditions permit, drive to the nearest edge of the roadway, clear of any intersection of highways, and stop and remain there, unless otherwise directed by a law-enforcement officer, until the emergency vehicle has passed. This provision shall not relieve the driver of any such vehicle to which the right-of-way is to be yielded of the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway, nor shall it protect the driver of any such vehicle from the consequences of an arbitrary exercise of such right-of-way.

Violation of this section shall constitute failure to yield the right-of-way; however, any violation of this section that involves overtaking or passing a moving emergency vehicle giving an audible signal and displaying activated warning lights as provided for in this section shall constitute reckless driving, punishable as provided in § 46.2-868.

First thing I saw that concerned me was a sign that said, ""Terminal"".

At the airport, there was a pickup truck waiting to take us to the plane (to be fair, the truck did have a camper shell).

We were greeted by an 89 year old pilot wearing a leather hat and googles. The plane was old. It had an outside toilet.

Took forever to get off the ground, and we had to stop in orlando for more coal.

Stewardess asked me if I wanted something to eat. I asked her, ""what are my choices?"" She said, ""Yes or no.""

I asked if I could get bumped up to first class...she said, ""Yes, if we hit a mountain.""


The flight got very bumpy. I got scared. I was sitting next to a rabbi. I asked him to do something religious. He took a collection.


Two rows up, a woman shouted, ""We're going to die! We're going to blow up!""

I shouted back, ""Shut up! How do you know!?""

I was a commercial driver. Over 4 million logs miles, never an accident, never a ticket. Ever.

Air and sea traffic is far ""easier"" to navigate with automated systems. Open navigation.

The shear complexities of a vehicle interacting in our current traffic system, along with literally *any* unforeseen scenarios, let alone accounting for the micro-second response time in which something can, and does, happen, presents nothing short of a nightmare for designers.

Then when it come to ""trust"" the system, you are supposed to keep your hands off the wheel, let it do it's thing, and only after it becomes obvious or at least probable, that the vehicle is going to hit something, you have to then reach the wheel/reach for the brake, and then apply input to avoid the collision.

Listen, I can tell you, by that time, moving at speed, you're gonna have a tough time reacting before contact. And even if you do, you're very likely to yank the wheel, making things worse. Jus sayin.

Thing is, while the engineer side of me says this is the coolest thing to see, the returning reports of control/accident issues to date is such I am not willing to put myself at risk over.

Technology-wise, this would be a no-problem, off the shelf stuff to rig a harness with remote winches for each line (3), from there, just hang it on a center hook, you're in business.

Again, it's off the shelf stuff (bom on request).

As far as training to understand the fundamentals of rigging a load, operating this system would be quite intuitive - hook up your harness, then take the slack out of each line. This will do the clean lift.

Once up, retract (in the video configuration) the foot of the leg so the load is level. Then move over base, lower cleanly to transport platform.

No one can have all the answers, but in my limited scope, background and knowledge, I cringe then I see that leg assembly bouncing, swinging around, *and* the base it's supposed to set on, go sliding as that technician is having to stop it rolling (wheel chocks?), before is potentially hits the mobile crane.

An adjustable rig would have allowed them to attach the harness to the leg, as it's oriented, take up the slack so there's a clean lift, and then retract the lower section, leveling the leg to be placed on the base.

6741,"Noted. Agreed. 

I worked for a trucking company out of little rock.

One evening while driving, I started having chest pain, and could feel my pulse was wasn't right.

It was after normal hours, so I called our emergency dispatch number, and told the dispatcher I was having chest pain and needed an ambulance.

The lady (who you could hear eating) told me she was busy and that wasn't her job.

I freaked, and told hew ""I'm having chest pain, I need an ambulance, are you listening to me?""

She yelled back and said, ""I said I was busy, are you listening to me!?"" and hung up.

I was getting disoriented, and frigtened i would die there in my truck, but I didn't want to leave my loaded truck on the road, so I got it to one of their yards, and parked. then I tried calling dispatch again ( I didn't know where I was to call 911 myself).

Three more calls did nothing, and then I used our qualcomm system to text the dispatch and begged them to get me some help.

It never happened. Finally another driver saw I was having trouble, and got me an ambulance.

I was in the hospital a week getting stabilized, and then I was transferred to st.louis where I had a quad bypass.

The surgery was 8 hours, and during that time I had a reaction to anesthesia, and since, I've had great difficulty with memory.

I was told that I would likely have died if I had been any longer getting help.

 It took me over three hours to get help, and non of it came from the company I worked for.

You know, I'm 55. I have a lot of interests. One has been I eat, sleep and live aviation, space-grade and marine stuff.

I'm also a good observer, and have always had an instant understanding of things mechanical...since I was a kid.


I see this technology working and I am impressed. I also see a brand new approach to space systems, and while I'm paying attention, I can see some things that could/should be noticed, and information/ideas/theories shared, that may impact the systems operation.

It's better to share more information than needed, than to omit.


The thoughts I share reference their landing platform, comes from the most sincere desire to see them become successful. I can see this program becoming a routine ride to space. Way cool.

My specific thoughts on this particular perceived problem, and solution theory, is based on a through knowledge of aviation systems and dynamics, flight characteristics, marine design, fluid dynamics, and a pretty good eye for what works or not.  


Based on everything I collect to date, I fully believe there is massive room for improvement in the landing platform system as it currently designed and operating.


I think a stabilized platform would increase the landing success rate exponentially.

This platform could be 4 times larger, enhancing stability simply by mass weight alone (think cessna/787), and would make deck space for multiple landings (series shots)(Imagine simultaneous landings :)). I'd also incorporate deck mounted fire control nozzles system. (I was surprised I didn't see that on the deck when the birds crashed before. Maybe I missed it)

Lastly, since you would have all that free room under the landing deck, you could incorporate thrust vectoring channels to mitigate the heat envelope when landing.",2016-04-25 00:51:26+00:00,d2fzblg,5.0,t1_d2fwdhi,5114.0,spacex

If the deck is pitching up as the rocket is touching down, load forces on the gear is going to be exceeded.

The U.S. however, very few per capita have pitchforks...actually, we pretty much went to guns right away.

So, you may find a market for pitchfork sales here in the states, but really, our guns are *far* more versatile. Better for distance, less personal, more compact, and a way lower effort required to achieve maximum effect. This is especially good for those with respiratory  issues, shortness of breath on excursion, and the aged. A simple matter of strength required to manually pitchfork someone. After all, even with very sharp tips, there's five object of certain mass, meeting resistance from the intended victim. This requires a certain amount of force to be useful. otherwise the attacker could become the attackee.

Guns are also better for drive-by's. Pitchforks are limited.

While having the obvious advantage over guns in terms of quiet deployment of the respective weapons, the close proximity one must drive to make contact with the victim, is extremely limited (about 4 ft usually, 6~7 feet leaning out the window.

The stealth value would also likely be lost, since sticking someone at random speed would likely be far from lethal (in the ass for instance), and the victim shouting and screaming would likely draw attention.

7599,"Absolutely! Same thing.

This isn't like some cheesy ad popping up on my computer to be clicked away, this thing came up on my phone, completely blocked the apps operation (I couldn't see anything but their ad) and multiple try's to to clear it didn't work.

This, and being on my mobile, being used for navigation while driving? Oh *hell* no!

To me, it takes a real piece of shit company to push something like this. They obviously don't care about causing an unsafe condition when driving.

Personally, I'd like to see a review of this tactic with DOT or someone...

I don't screw around out on the road. I know the very best chance of avoiding an accident is having your eyes out the windshield. At all times. Any time you're looking at a screen, you're not looking at the road.

I give myself micro-second glances in my mirrors, and the dash stuff, then it back out...

This ""ad"", caused me to spend *way* more time trying to figure out wtf I was even looking at, and then spent a bunch of time trying to get the fucking thing off my screen. I restarted the app a bunch of times, I restarted the phone. *Nothing*.

Finally, it cleared itself, and I got my gps back.

All this while I'm running in nuts-to-butts traffic on the I-610 loop.

So, I don't know where it came from, or why it eventually went away. But I can tell you I've been driving since 1976, used to drive commercial. Over 4 million safe logged miles, never an accident, never a ticket...ever.

I'm also a pilot.

Thing is I know what works out on the road and what doesn't. I also consider driving to be a 'precision' event (it's one of my 'hobbies').

Anything that interferes with my first option, keeping my eyes out the windshield, is something I don't like.

Much of it is necessary, and brief 'scans' around can be managed safely.

7660,"Earlier, I gave a rather sarcastic response to your comment and video link.

I shouldn't have done that. You deserve the respect of a thorough response.


I've watched all the video I can find of all the landing attempts. I keep coming back to the platform being too unstable, presenting too much information and variables that the stage cannot keep up with.

I know I don't always express in words how I can see the dynamics here...but I have monster confidence that if that deck were stabilized, the stage landing would have been as textbook as when they plopped down on LZ-1.

If you look at the video, you'll see the deck is pitching up, just as the booster is touching down, and then the deck rolls slightly to starboard just after landing. Note the forward-right landing gear arm. You'll see a small puff of debris as the gear fails.

All the other landing exhibit similar characteristics related to either situational awareness, and last second adjustments leading to landing failure.

It's all right there...anyone can see this. 

Sure as you read this, they're gonna keep losing birds till they stabilize that platform. And the only reasonable way to do that is a self-stabilizing platform, that controls not only horizontal motion, but one that can offset vertical movement as well.

(Oh, and it wouldn't hurt if they installed a thrust vectoring system as well. No need for the heat plume causing more damage to the booster.)


It would really take some convincing to make me believe the current design is the best for this mission.

Everything from being kidnapped by my father when I was 4, and lived in a Seminole indian village in the everglades.

Or the beatings, or moving from place to place every 2~3 months.

How about having a group of angry, screaming, spitting men hold you down on the ground for hours, trying to cast demons out of you. And your father helped.

We've lived in basically total isolation. Sometimes in shacks and cabins with no running water...

I've has a few attempts at formal education...but for the most part, I am self-taught.

Frankly, I'm going to disagree with Mr. Musk.

Note the horizon as the rocket is landing. It's pitching up exactly as the rocket is touching down.

This, I think, exceeded the rockets ability to compensate for vertical height change quick enough, and overloaded the landing gear.

I suspect their engineers will find/found a broken, not unlocked, collet.

I can see the rocket can ""twist around"" on it's butt for angle and positioning, but there's no way the engine can respond, and adjust decent quickly enough to compensate for vertical pitch changes at the last second.

I thought something might be wrong when we were greeted by a 96 year old man, wearing a leather hat and goggles, who showed us an airplane with an outside toilet.

Made me nervous seeing the sign overhead that said, ""Terminal"".

Made things worse when they put us in the ""Final Departure"" lounge...^( ^I ^didn't ^lounge)

I don't want to say the plane was old, but we had to stop in orlando for more coal.

Took two hours to get to 10,000 feet. The stewardess asked me if i'd like to eat?

I asked, ""what are my choices?"" she responds, ""yes or no"".

I asked what my chances are of getting bumped up to first class?

She said ""the only way you're going the get bumped up to first class, is if we hit a mountain"".

On the flight, we had some engine trouble. The plane started diving down...I was sitting next to a rabbi, I said, ""do something religious!""

He took a collection.

Still having trouble with the plane, a woman suddenly shouts, ""we're all going to die! we're going to blow up!""

I told her to shut the hell up.

A few minutes later, the same woman says again, ""we're all going to die! We're going to blow up!

Really pissed by now, I turn and ask her, ""just how do you know we're going to blow up?""""Planes make emergency landings all the time, and nothing happens!

She says, ""I've got a bomb!""

Fortunately she didn't have a bomb, but she had this chicken, and it was ill. Very ill.

8096,"Oh really.

You've displayed a level of ignorant assumption that makes me question if your joking, bored, dense or stupid.

You don't get it; I use the word ""amazing"" specifically. You take some wide-sweep and call me (well, see above for your dipshit comments), and tell me I'm not a scientist if I don't cream myself every time I put part A into part B and watch it twinkle.

If you'd bothered to consider the actual definition, I never said anything about not totally getting off on doing the coolest shit in the world, by making things that's never been done before.

Experimentation or prototyping, design, theory...taking an idea and seeing it work as predicted or better, is just brilliant. It's what I do...

I use words like excellent, outstanding, beautiful, perfect, even fucked, to describe an experiment or project, or something I'm doing...but amazed? Why? Really, what is there to be amazed about?

If you understand something, how can you be amazed by witnessing any given phenomenon?

Are you amazed every time you start your car, and it runs? *(no specific reference you your vehicle is implied)*

Next you throw a reference, for my edification, and apparent proof of my errant thinking, of Richard Feynman.

If you actually listen to the man, he is so into his world, it's just brilliant listening to him...but he's not ""amazed"" that something is happening, he's amazed that he gets to see it happen and make it happen.

Believe it or not (I was in an issue of that book once, btw), some people can be giddy as a school girl and not because they're amazed, but just doing a near perfect thing, and getting to experience it.

I don't find much to be amazing. If you were to proove to me that alien life does *not* exist, then I would be amazed. If you had proof the god *does* exist, then I would be amazed. 

The fact that the universe exists, is amazing. But most anything else? Understanding the contents thereof is a relative matter of gathering information and knowledge, and then (perhaps) applying it. That's not amazing, that's mechanics. Cool...very cool...but mechanics. It's what I do.

It's kind of sad on one hand to see your narrow grasp and assumptive nature, given you seem to profess a scientific mindset.

On the other hand, I really don't give a .5 shit what you think. 

You shouldn't bet more than you can afford to lose.",2016-03-07 04:28:24+00:00,d0qeuh0,9.0,t1_d0pgoyp,68714.0,videos

Crime is crime.

Sign up for the fame gig, better expect fame results.

You don't get a pass to do something violent to someone else, just because someone took your picture.

A million other ways this could have been handled...physically attacking someone isn't one of them.

Now you can just sit there, and let someone approach you, snatch your phone away, and destroy it right in front of you. Of course you have no obligation to intervene in any way...you just sit there. Maybe you'll even mention that you're 'upset'.

Murray was obviously agitated, he approached these people in an aggressive manner, and then made physical contact.

At that point, you can and should be reacting to an aggressor coming at you.  

That's the point where the aggressor ends up on the ground.

8587,"I'm 55. In 1989 I was diagnosed with stage 3A Hodgkin's. Treatment was two complete rounds of chemo, and 42 rounds of radiation a a bunch of surgeries, spleen, part of liver, lymph nodes...

It was a very aggressive therapy, and for the cancer part, was successful.

I never threw up, and did most of the treatments on my own.

Honestly, I have limited memory of these events. It's hard to recall, let alone describe my thoughts from that time.

Today, I remain less than I was...thoughts are fleeting, concentration is difficult, complex thought, used to be childs play, is a monster difficulty now. Yet by contrast, I'm still intact in creativity (I'm an inventor, artist), and new ideas, designs are always developing, and they're still accurate in design and function.

It's frustrating to have all the ideas, but cannot focus on one long enough to see them developed.

The radiation caused significant heart damage...To date having three heart attacks, three stents, one aortic stent, two shots of defibrillator, a quad-bypass.

I don't worry about the physical events, and I exercise everyday, working with my physical limitations, but I've come a long way. 

The mental injury...*that's* my tragedy...I sometimes feel lost, that I can't concentrate on any one thing for very long...it's *always* never-ending chaos in thought.

Everyone reacts differently to chemo, but there are identifiable trends that are without question.

I've learned (and am still working on it) to accommodate as best I can, it's an everyday effort.

I also find the good in things if I can, and one I get off on is I've become more of an artist than inventor.

We are given certain challenges in our life. Just pick up the pieces, and work with whats left. :)

Talons don't crush, they grab, tear, and hold.

A rabbit weighs about 3~5 lbs.

If any predator (i.e. fox, cat, etc.) got picked up be an eagle, that animal can and will tear that eagle apart if they can reach around on the bird.

Really, I don't know where you get that birds of prey are crushers...they're not. They're shredders.

You refer to the strength of their talons, and you're right. Very strong.

But that's not the problem...it's their legs, and wings especially, that are very 'tender', and *will* get hit by the drone blades.

Nobody seems to acknowledge that even an eagle, holding a running drone upside down, is going to be flapping his wings.

Don't you understand there is no way that bird is not going to get hit by the blades?

And if you think drone blades can't hurt you -

It did fine under the basic ground conditions earlier, so temp can't be that high...

Land it on a titanium grid work. The feet will always have plenty of square area, and the titanium will be fine for the job.

Underneath, have a temperature hardened floor with channeled ""spikes"" to route the gases down and away from the aircraft. (Note- This grid would be sectional to allow confined maintenance, and the entire landing zone could be duplicated, allowing a very large, yet effective landing area.

In other words, no matter where the rocket touches down, the thrust gasses will be vectored down, out and away from the aircraft during landing. 

The venturi draft generated by the thrust will greatly enhance cooling and control, but likely needs to be considered a possible factor in the landing envelope. (Rather minimal I would think)

I don't know beyond common sense guessing what the temps, thrust, etc. are, and I haven't crunched any numbers to determine best materials (that's for those guys to worry about ^:) ), but it's easy to see that this could be very reasonable to make, and *very* effective.",2016-01-02 19:45:33+00:00,cyjkcz7,7.0,t1_cyjiq98,2810.0,Futurology

I love doing this. I don't have any money, so I need to sell my stuff so I can buy more materials.

I had a lot of people tell me I should start an etsy store. Which I did.

Problem is, etsy, like so many other sites, requires you to link with your social network friends, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc...

Thing is, I have no friends network. I have no family or other relatives. I live a quiet life, (I'm 55) and just don't socialize online except for reddit.

So, I have all this cool jewelry and other art stuff, but no one knows it's there, and I'm not internet oriented enough to make it work.

I think I did a good job putting the site together (visn.etsy.com if you want a look.)

9243,"Hey reddit! Listen, I started making jewelry and other art stuff a few months ago. I love doing this, and I've been honored that a lot of other folks like my work. I posted an invite to you guys in October, when I was invited to be a 'guest artist' at a Gallery here in town back in August during Galveston's ""Artwalk"". Several of you made it, and it was so cool meeting fellow redditors in person. I was nervous showing my work to the public for the first time, but I ended up having a blast! The latest news is, I've been invited to show my work again, but this time as a 'featured' artist. Seriously! So, here's the thing- To me, this is a big deal...and I would like to do something special for myself, and for you. Normally, not having any family or relatives, the Christmas holiday season hasn't been that much of an ""event"" in my world. But this year is different. I'd like to share the spirit, and in lieu of family, I kind of 'adopted' reddit some time back...(unrelated coolness) This year, since January, has been the best year I've had since 2011, after recovering from a major health issue. I have come from learning to walk again, to now doing this cool new gig, and I want to celebrate by giving something back, specifically to you guys. Artwalk will be November 28th. I will be at the Gallery from 4~8pm. Anyone who can make it is cordially invited, and ALL of my jewelry and other art will be 50% off to any redditor. I never charged much for my stuff anyway, but at half price, you can get some of my pieces for $15. These would make perfect gifts... There will be wine and cheese as well! Mind you, I have a limited selection, and I think there's something for most tastes. I'm sorry I can't make it better than half price, but to date I define 'starving artist"" syndrome, and just can't afford to do more at this time. Hopefully, next year will be better. :) All my stuff is hand made, and all of the nautical stuff, seashells, sea glass pieces, etc, were picked up on the beach personally. (Yes, going to the beach is a tough job, but someone has to do it...) You should know that everything I make, is personal to me. Beautiful art is why I do this, not to sell. It's my 'therapy' :) Selling these lets me get more materials (yiss) So, once again, you're invited to come down check out everything at Artwalk, and stop by for a visit! Location: J. Bangle's Gallery 1124 25th St. Galveston, TX 77550 (for gps) Time: 4pm~8pm I sure hope you can make it. Be brilliant to meet you in person. :) Here is some of my work - http://imgur.com/a/0DyVz http://imgur.com/a/pYuPE#0 Best to all! :)",2015-11-28 03:43:58+00:00,cxfebav,1.0,t3_3ujlzi,13.0,galveston

So, chances are, that if you've re-played your 'secrete place' in you mind for years, that place, by now, after hundreds of plays, most likely hardly resembles the original.

Interesting thing is, you would never know it, without some ""grounding"" reminder...otherwise, what you remember now would seem quite the same...

Really, I don't want anything. I'm pretty good where I am.

I don't have any family, so 'christmas' has meant something different to me than most folks...not a fault, mind you, just a different frame of reference...

But I do respect this holiday, in my own way...it's a quiet celebration of the best in humanity. I like that.

I've been running around this planet for 54 years. Really, I've seen more and done more than the average guy.

I've also lived through things that you wouldn't believe. Cancer, Heart attack, 27 surgeries, gunshot, lots of natural disasters...a *LOT* of shit.

It's those events, and surviving them, that brings me to the meaning of christmas...just to enjoy the moment, and gather the good pieces for your memories.

You know, just celebrate being here to see it and live it, one more time. 

I started making jewelry a few months ago. I really like doing this, just discovered I could!

This is why I celebrate christmas...not because of santa clause or religious reasons. I just made it a personal milestone.

I'm still here, and able to start a whole new gig. Works for me. 

There's that, and really, I dig the lights. :)

Having said that, you know, I'd like to be in Manhattan on christmas night, check out the scene, and then take a walk through central park.

I think that would be brilliant. :)

I've come to find that all of the life's traumas and dramas set who you are.

Without it, you could never truly appreciate the value of the good moments.


It took a long time to come to this realization, but in the end, I win.

I get it. I get to the the world for the parts I like, the things I enjoy,   and I don't worry or think about the bullshit moments that 1, are NOT your fault, and 2, can't do anything about.

Listen, life is *NOT* fair. It's not supposed to be. It's all just reality.

You make, and pick out the good parts, live those, enjoy those...and fuck the rest.

Find something to do that makes you happy. Go large...think big.

Then go do it.

Yes, this belt, like most all other ""safety-type"" lighting systems, would serve as a primary visual acquisition aid, and not as a forward illumination source.

The speed of a bike and the physics involved far exceed the useful light output range of my belt.

Working ground light is best served for runners, walkers, etc..

No doubt if you ride at night, throw some light out ahead of you.

Given these points, and my take on your qualifications, I would like to invite you to try one on my belts in a real-world riding environment, in your conditions.

In my history, I've designed light systems for emergency vehicles. Worked with Federal, Whelen, Code 3, SVP and a few others.

You've seen some of my work out on the road (hopefully, not in your rear view mirror :) )

I have worked with flash patterns in both incandescent and led systems.

The ""random"" patterns you see are ""ok"", but frankly, there are certain simple patterns that are attention getting, and (very important) allow a driver to 1. notice you, 2. tell the direction you're going, and 3. not be ""so"" noticed that you hold the drivers attention.

This is important, because a driver will tend to steer their vehicle in the direction of their attention.

Take heart...what seems like and endless treadmill of despair is actually, just a moment in your life.

I've dealt with depression all of my adult life. It got so bad sometimes.

Time, however, has proven to be my greatest benefit...

As I've grown older, life has just taken on a new 'tone'. I came to understand things and gained wisdom that has let me find brilliant balance. Put things in their place.



I still deal with depression, but today, you would never know it.


Time will work for you as well.

I wish you the very best, and once again, welcome to reddit :)

Honestly, I hardly think about the business world ""entity"".

I don't believe we as a humanity, allow ourselves to develop our full potentials, and for what I consider some of the stupidest reasons when you think about it.

Nevertheless, I've developed my personal value sets of things that are 'important' to me...One is I like the idea of giving back to my planet.

By happenstance, I'm an inventor/engineer/artist, so it stands to reason that my ""useful contribution"" would be new technology, a new device, or other innovation-class thing.

Only a matter of occupation-related by-product...

To put it simply, I believe in giving back. I like it. I like solving problems and being beneficial in some way. It's my thing. I like it. I think we all have a responsibility to be 'caretakers' of the planet, and each other, in some way. This is just mine.

That was a long time ago, but as I remember vis was about 6~10 feet (that's about 10~18 bananas on end for you foreigners)(rain forest water you know, pretty silty.). I knew how deep I'd be going from the depth gauge on the boat, so there wasn't mush distance viz, but not ant real feel either.

My personal best was a sled ride to 250' off of Key Largo.
I managed a dive shop there for a guy named Pippin (you may know that name). At the time, he held the world record free dive for 465'.

Unassisted, you could get some decent bottom time if you stayed around 80 or less.

Besides, that's where the 'action' is anyway, unless your out in the big water doing palagics, right?

40' feet is fine for 99% of the things you'd want to see anyway.

10210,"Well, you questions do cover a bit of ground...  :)

Start with your first one -

I swam to the bottom of the panama canal, because, basically, I could.

I worked as a Lecturer aboard a cruise ship, and our itinerary was a 7-day from Jamaica, and down around south america, with one of our stops was going inside the panama canal at Gatun lake, where the passengers could go ashore and do jungle stuff (rain forest tours, zipline, white water rafting, chopper flights, etc).

We did this same trip every week, so you get to do pretty much everything.

I've always been a water bug...and back then (1999) I was big into freediving.

You could swim at this dock by the shore where the passengers could hang out, and the tender boats could drop off.

I knew a lot of the panama pilots, and went out often on ride along while they worked the ships. It was fascinating to be part of that operation.

One day I got one of the pilots to drive out into the main channel so I could dive the bottom.

You can't spend much time in the channel cause the ships are always moving, and you *will* get out of their way.

Cool part is when your breath-hold diving, you can go down and back up as fast as you want, no decompression issues. The whole thing is less than 4 minutes.

So we motored out to the middle, and as soon as he stopped, I went over the side and started kicking kind of easy down.

Being fresh water, I didn't much weight, and it was an otherwise uneventful ride down to the bottom, which I reach at 67 feet at that point.
The dive was recorded on my dive watch/computer.

As with many of the memorable places I've been, I took a handful of bottom in a baggie for home.

I didn't spend much time there, looked around for a sec, had a smile for myself and then kicked off the bottom for a quick return to the boat.

I still have that bottom soil today. :)",2015-10-11 07:07:52+00:00,cvvm6gs,5.0,t1_cvv6qjs,32420.0,AskReddit

10462,"Honestly, reddit was it.

In November of last year, I was at such a low point. I had been in therapy for years working through an injury that changed my life. Took a year to learn to walk again...

I was around no one, I have no family, I've had a butt load of health issues.

I got so depressed, even thought that I should just prepare for my demise.

One day in January, I was talking to a young man on reddit, who was had major cancer surgery, and more to come, and was scared.

I shared some of my cancer treatment experience with him, and I  posted a photo of myself, with all my scars, and a 'kinda whiny' description moment of some of my history. (it's 'dramatic' :/)

The response from reddit was unbelievable. *Millions"" viewed my post, and the comments from you guys just blew me away.

I didn't know that much about reddit and this community back then, but I can say the support and encouragement from you guys changed everything.


To date, I've quit smoking cold turkey (January), started excercising, getting out in public, and had a new outlook on my life, and I think, a new 'lease'.

Today, I power-walk six miles every other day, doing push-up the whole way, I'm designing Jewelry (never did that before), and I now have my stuff in three stores in town, and I've just opened an etsy store.


Guys, you can think this is corny, or that I'm 'enhancing' my report, but I can tell you this - I honestly think you guys saved a life.

I have adopted reddit as my family.


Always know you have my deepest thank you to all who are good people.


It is you...who restored my faith in humanity, and I have told that story many times now.

I am honored. :)",2015-09-28 01:24:28+00:00,cvgfd02,1.0,t3_3mn4gl,1834.0,AskReddit

I've never known boredom. *Always* something brewing. Rarely do I even think to consider I'm actually alone...just doesn't cross my mind much.


I also had the honor of sharing my life with my wife of 20 years. So my younger years were shared with a best friend.

Life moves forward. Time and circumstance brought me to this place in life, and in that, I have no regrets.

Yes, there are many times I would like to have someone to share my life with...I think I have a lot to offer.

But finding someone who could make that 'connection' would be my only interest, and that has not happened yet.

I can be patient. Nothing could be more important, so I let head and heart take that course. Don't rush it. :)

I'm always looking up the road. :)

I'm in Galveston, TX.

You're offer is so perfect. I wouldn't want to intrude, but I can say thank you. Sincerely. 

The offer alone speaks volumes of your character, and is a perfect example of the true meaning of ""Thanksgiving"".

I'd like to return the sentiment if I may. One of my recent ""adventures"" is making jewelry ( I started 3 months ago.)

You have asked ""how"" I am polymathic. It's an interesting question, one I've been asked a thousand times.

I want to respond accurately. 

Please take the context as it's intended, I don't want to come off sounding 'flip' in my answer.

There has never been a day that I haven't been diverse in my interests and ability to instantly understand all things mechanical.

From my first memories of childhood, I was always checking stuff out. 

Science, music, art held my interests, as well as an intense curiosity about most everything...I just always ""had to know"".

So how do I ""do it""? Honestly, I have no idea...it's always been this way. No big deal. Just another day.

In fact, I used to think it was perfectly normal, and couldn't understand how most other folks just didn't ""get it"".

It took a long time to figure out I was the weird one. lol

You say you're 'embarking' on a polymathic path.

I've never known anyone who 'decided' to go down that road...interesting.

Your lament suggests a certain capability...I would like learn more as you explore this concept.

Like I said, I've never known any other way.

I think it would be interesting to see the results of someone, who made a conscious decision to diverse wide-spectrum education.


frankly, I wonder if you've thought about this...you see, you get to know a lot of stuff, and be good at doing just about anything.

But you know, you won't fit anywhere in society (as it were).

Your world exists on a different plane...


But I can say, after 54 years, there's no greater peace than knowledge and understanding.",2015-09-24 14:52:02+00:00,cvcldlr,2.0,t1_cvae94o,162846.0,Polymath

About 4 months ago, I was looking at a seashell that's been on my coffee table for months.

It just looked 'different'. I saw a detail that I'd never noticed before, and thought It would look good as a pendant.

I made it, and someone bought it almost immediately (I live on Galveston Island btw)

So now I have these ideas that just start flooding me....endless designs...I start building these things I see, and now, four months later...I've done this.

People seem to really like my work. It's quite varied, I have no idea what going to come out next.

I can't seem to stop the flow of new ideas, but I also love every second that I'm making something.

My stuff is now in three stores in Galveston, and, by multiple requests, I'm working on an etsy store right now - 

(Visn.Etsy.com if you wanna check it out.) 


How did I go from Ground effects to this?

I have no earthly idea.


In my history, I've been an Inventor and Engineer.

Always technical projects (14 patents to date), and *never* anything to do with the 'arts'.

Several years ago, I had an injury that really messed me up.

An anesthesia failure during an 8- hour surgery changed my life forever.

In short, I had to re-learn so much. My memory was all but destroyed, took me a year just to learn to walk again.


It's been a lot of work getting my world back...and there has been much damage. 

Some of my doctors think this ""artistic creative"" acquired skill may be a result of compensation for an injured brain.

That may be...who knows. And who cares, right?

You'll never know how beneficial this has been.

After years of work, therapy, and many times thinking I was ""all done"" in being useful to myself, or to the world...*this* happens.

It's literally made my spirit whole again, and I've found a new purpose in my life. :) ",2015-09-19 17:53:23+00:00,cv73afr,5.0,t1_cv6ku48,54696.0,Entrepreneur

3 months ago I started making jewelry. I had been several years in rehab from a nasty medical event, and recently, I thought about jewelry as a hobby...something to do.

Prior to that date, I had never designed a piece of jewelry in my life.

My stuff is now in three stores in Galveston, and on request, am opening an etsy store.

This has become it's own 'entity'...taken over my life...and I love it. :)

You see, the reality is that not all feet are created equal - besides the dainty 'cinderella' thing, comes the foot foot you could climb trees with...I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to touch that. (things like ""Tetanus"" and ""Bio-hazard suits with steel reinforced/puncture-resistant gloves"" come to mind, along with an above-average potential for nightmares, and a ""desensitization"" from horror movies.)

25 to warm up, 35, 35 70, 35 35 30, etc...

I've been working this program as a maintenance gig since January.

I have excellent doctors and other medical professionals through the VA (U.S. Coast Guard Veteran).

Does every vocation or activity become more or less equal to you, or, do you find that some things have more merit (to your own subjectivity)?

*I am drawn to projects that serve a true beneficial purpose.

Solutions to problems, improvements in quality of life, environmental projects...

Rarely do I ever have interest in subjects where there is no 'notable' use/function. It isn't by design...""gravity"" just takes me there...
---

What activity would you do for a living if you had to choose only that one?

*That is not a possibility. I've tried. I can't lock in on just one thing. Never could.

I actually envy people who can do that - find one thing and stick with it for 30 years...that amazes me.
---

Do you have family who also have considerable talents?

* My mother was quite brilliant. During the early parts of World War II, she was part of the scientific team to develop and test RADAR for the U.S..

My oldest brother was a genius with electronics.
---

Have you ever had a brain scan or any indication of what makes your brain unique?

* No brain scan. It's been suggested a number of times...but for 'other' reasons. :)
---

Do you think that humanity would benefit from having many more polymaths?

I'm not so sure...using myself as a reference, I find there is little room in the developed world for polymaths. 

We are a society of ""specialists"". Taught, structured and established to learn to do one thing in life and do it well. (Monomaths)

This base socialistic structure as it exists, means that for any given industry, there will be specialists in that field. And these folks drill down to the intricacies of their fields.

A polymath, while well versed in several subjects, has the disadvantage.

The asset of the polymath, at least in my case, is that the ""resultants"" of my knowledge and experiences, along with a good dose of creativity, brings new concepts. It's my ""tool box"".

In other words, If I understand the subject, you *WILL* see new ideas and innovations as a result.  It's always been that way.
---

Do you follow futurology or have any interest in the potential of merging our organic existence with inorganic technology at an existential level?

*I have given that some thought...my .02 to date, is that if we improve quality of life, and the environment, then there is valid reason to continue research.

My fear, which unfortunately has almost *always* been well founded, is that the potential for either massive error, hostile design, or just humanity being humanity, will fail to control the technology.

It would be a central place where anyone can join.


The purpose would be to empower ourselves, millions strong, to force corporations, crooked businesses, and incompetent or corrupt government officials to treat us with the respect and fair business we deserve.

If you've *ever* been ripped off, gouged, lied to, deceived, or just treated like you're nothing, you're not alone.

One voice complaining does nothing...

**20 MILLION** voices saying we will boycott your business if you don't start treating us with respect?

You will have their undivided attention. 

You have seen what happens when a corporation like Comcast treats one of us like shit...nothing happens.

You've also seen their reaction when a customers story makes it to the web.

These guys don't care about us as individual consumers. 

A classic corporate ""tactic"" is taken right out of rules of combat - ""divide and conquer"".

If we stood together, and moved as one, there is *nothing* that could stop us.

Boycott a business for just one day...move as one. We show the power we actually hold.

What we assign as valuable, even in general terms, is relative to an individual. 

So, how do we quantify value as an individual?

A reasonable approach would be to note the contribution of that person to society, and planet earth.

No matter the conclusion, a base-line standard can be drawn from understanding the human species' place on earth, specifically, that human beings are in fact the master 'parasite' species (see *any* definition of parasite).

Considering this, any progress of humanity, or an individual, to rise above that moniker, by being a good person, protecting the environment, helping someone, or or just peacefully coexisting, is the only *true* value we hold.

It's just tough working in constant 'chaos' now. Baggage...

That's the ""wtf"" part - I've lost so many higher-function abilities I used to take for granted. 

I used to be able to do calculus in my head...not any more.

I feel like I've become such a mental 'simpleton', yet this creative stuff just launches... 

Come a long way though. And in the meantime...it is what it is.
