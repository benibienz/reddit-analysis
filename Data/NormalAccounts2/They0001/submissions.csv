This last time I thought I was going to pend 500~600 in repairs, and it only cost me 96 bucks.

I've known him for several years, and I can tell you I've never know a more knowledgeable mechanic, ever.

He's incredibly reasonable and totally honest, and will go out of his way, *way* out of his way, to save you money anywhere he can.

Listen, do yourself a favor, if you need your car worked on, give this guy a call.
You will not only be impressed, I've no doubt you'll be calling him *your* mechanic from then on.

This isn't a paid gig, but you will get brilliant exposure, practical experience, copies of your pics and you can keep a piece as well. :)

This would be simple, we can meet at a gallery here in town that has my jewelry.

There is no age or race restriction, but an appropriate appearance for face and hair are important.

I can provide transportation to and from if needed.

If interested, pm me asap.

Several years ago I presented a project to the US NAVY Sub-Sea Warfare dept. in Washington.

This project would definitely be highly classified (Torpedo counter-measure system).

In addition to a detailed description of the project, prototypes of both scale and full size were presented, and the viability of the projects was readily established.

To date, I've heard no status of USN intention to purchase or use this technology.  There has been no offer of compensation, no classification status issued.

Having such time elapse, I expect either the navy decided not to use this, or it is using it, without my knowledge.

My question is, assuming this project remains my intellectual property, and given that if acquired and deployed by the US Navy, this would be a highly classified system, can I sell this technology on the open market to foreign entities?

And if so, how would you suggest I proceed?

As the Christmas season approaches, we reflect, with fondness, the stories we’ve known since 
childhood.

The Manger, the Star of Bethlehem, the Three Wise Men…all stories well known, and all well told.

We know of the journey Mary and Joseph took from Nazareth to Bethlehem, but few know of their experiences along the journey-

Joseph knew that the trip to Bethlehem would be long and difficult. Having Mary with child made matters even worse.

Fortunately, Mary had an Ass. She was a fine, healthy, young Ass, and Joseph took comfort in knowing that Mary could ride her Ass, making the journey long journey to Bethlehem possible.

On the morning their trip was to begin, Joseph asked Mary, “Are you ready to go?” and Mary said, “Oh, I don’t know.” 

With that, Joseph said, “Then I will decide, and we shall go.”

Collecting their few meager possessions, and with hardly any money, Joseph took Mary, and sat her upon her Ass. And they did go to Bethlehem.

As they walked, Joseph quietly worried about how they were going to eat as the journey continued. He was acting on faith as never before. And they had very little money.

After many hours, Joseph and Mary came upon a traveler going to Nazareth. “Hello” said the traveler as they met. “Hello” said Joseph. The traveler said, “I’m going to Nazareth.” And Joseph said, “We’re going to Bethlehem.”

The traveler noticed Mary, and that she was with child, saying, “That is a long journey, are you sure you can make it?” With that, Joseph said, “Mary has a fine, young Ass, and she will take Mary to Bethlehem.”

This made the traveler take a closer look at Mary’s Ass. Saying, “I believe you. That is a fine Ass.” Then the traveler asked Mary, “I love Asses, may I touch your Ass?” and Mary said, “Oh, I don’t know.” The traveler replied, “I would very much like to feel your Ass.”
As Mary and the traveler talked, Joseph had an idea, saying to the traveler, “I will let you touch Mary’s Ass, for one piece of Silver.” Smiling, the traveler agreed, and gave Joseph the money. Joseph was very happy. Now they would eat that night.
The traveler stepped over to Mary and her Ass. Mary got off her Ass so the traveler could see her Ass better. The traveler knew Asses very well, and Mary’s Ass was a fine one. He stroked Mary’s Ass, in genuine appreciation. “What a fine, young firm Ass you have.” Said the traveler. “May I climb on your Ass?
Mary said, “Oh, I don’t know.” And Joseph said, “You may climb on Mary’s Ass for two pieces of Silver.”

The traveler thought for a minute, then smiled saying, “I think it is worth it to be on such a fine Ass.”

With that, the traveler gave Joseph two pieces of Silver, and then with great joy, climbed on Mary’s Ass.

“This is a very fine Ass.” Said the traveler. “I hope I find an Ass this nice in Nazareth, I will need one for my business.”
Then the traveler asked, “May I buy Mary’s Ass?” Mary replied, “Oh, I don’t know.” After a moment
 Joseph said, “No, you may not buy Mary’s Ass. But when we return from Bethlehem, I will let you use Mary’s Ass for 5 pieces of Silver a day.”

The traveler thought for some time, and then said, “I think this is fair. Mary has the finest Ass in all the land. I will pay you five days in advance as a show of good faith.” The traveler gave Joseph twenty five pieces of Silver, making Joseph and Mary very happy.
They thanked the traveler, said ‘goodbye’, and continued on their Journey to Bethlehem, dancing with joy.

The moral of this story?
Even if you don’t know anything, a fine Ass will take you far.

Merry Christmas.

The latest news is, I've been invited to show my work again, but this time as a 'featured' artist. Seriously!
So, here's the thing- To me, this is a big deal...and I would like to do something special for myself, and for you.
Normally, not having any family or relatives, the Christmas holiday season hasn't been that much of an ""event"" in my world. But this year is different. I'd like to share the spirit, and in lieu of family, I kind of 'adopted' reddit some time back...(unrelated coolness)
This year, since January, has been the best year I've had since 2011, after recovering from a major health issue.
I have come from learning to walk again, to now doing this cool new gig, and I want to celebrate by giving something back, specifically to you guys.
Artwalk will be November 28th. I will be at the Gallery from 4~8pm.
Anyone who can make it is cordially invited, and ALL of my jewelry and other art will be 50% off to any redditor.
I never charged much for my stuff anyway, but at half price, you can get some of my pieces for $15.
These would make perfect gifts...
There will be wine and cheese as well!
Mind you, I have a limited selection, and I think there's something for most tastes.
I'm sorry I can't make it better than half price, but to date I define 'starving artist"" syndrome, and just can't afford to do more at this time. Hopefully, next year will be better. :)
All my stuff is hand made, and all of the nautical stuff, seashells, sea glass pieces, etc, were picked up on the beach personally.
(Yes, going to the beach is a tough job, but someone has to do it...)
You should know that everything I make, is personal to me. Beautiful art is why I do this, not to sell. It's my 'therapy' :)
Selling these lets me get more materials (yiss)
So, once again, you're invited to come down check out everything at Artwalk, and stop by for a visit!

Listen, I started making jewelry and other art stuff a few months ago.

I love doing this, and I've been honored that a lot of other folks like my work.

I posted an invite to you guys in October, when I was invited to be a 'guest artist' at a Gallery here in town back in August during Galveston's ""Artwalk"".

Normally, I'd just make sure not to step on him and go about my way.

However, today was a hot day in Galveston, and the sidewalk was very hot. I quickly noticed the little Caterpillar was running as fast as he could...and became distressed so bad he was falling over from the heat on his multiple feet. He ran and fell, ran and fell...it was sad.


I care for animals, so I sprang into action - using my foot, I gently tried to 'scoot' him over the the cool grass.

I bumped him lightly a couple of times, and you know how some Caterpillars will roll up when they feel threatened? Well, he was one of 'em.

He rolled right up into a flat disk and laid there. ""Ok, no prob,"" I thought, ""easier to skid him to the side"".

So, with one more gentle 'twitch' action flip from my foot, the little fella started sliding in the right direction, but then, somehow, the flat 'disk' of the Caterpillar flipped up on end, now resembling more of a 'tire-like' configuration, and then began rolling from the energy I had imparted from my original twitch.

Here's where things get bad - You see, there was a slight downhill 'grade' to the sidewalk and a good breeze was blowing in just the right direction, and both events conspired to propel the Caterpillar down the sidewalk at a speed that I'm certain no Caterpillar has ever encountered before, let alone on a high-RPM rotational axis.

What made things even worse was the incredibly long time this poor creature had to endure this...


Seriously, everything worked against him here...The sidewalk was long with a slight break to the right. 

I watched in disbelief as my actions caused this animal to roll fast and far, holding the curve, even leaning into it...it. just.kept.going.

I even had time to lament, as he traveled along, on how his motion down the sidewalk, the speed, the bouncing around over the gravel bits, reminded me of watching the Sail boarders on a windy ocean surf.

Finally, after what seemed like forever, I saw it roll to the side where it crashed into a heap next to the grass.

I really felt bad.

I was going that way anyway, and after walking a while I arrived at the crash site.

When I looked at him, he was just lying there, one his side, still rolled up in a tight disk, with a sixteen legged death-grip on his entire body. And he was entirely still...except for his head. It was ""twitching"". I've never seen anything like it.


At that point I thought I'd done enough to help this innocent creature, and did take some personal solace in the fact that indeed, he *was* in the grass. Success &lt;&gt;.

I also thought there was nothing more I could do in the aftermath.

I do admit, I am very critical of myself, and of my work...I never think it's really 'good enough' - know what I mean?

Anyway, I'm at at a gallery who has my stuff, and notice a piece is missing.

A quick search confirms - I've been shoplifted! Someone actually stole one of my pieces!

So, I'm supposed to be mad and all, and I admit, I'd rather not be ripped off, but I have to admit, I am impressed. And actually kinda pleased...


To think that someone liked my work so much, and wanted that piece so bad (it was a Palm Tree pendant, btw), that they would risk going to jail to get it...

I've been a redditor for a long time, surprised I didn't find this earlier. Cool!

Guys, I've been invited to be a ""guest artist"" at a Gallery during Art Walk August 22nd in Galveston.

My name is 'They' (hence my username :) )

I make Jewelry. I started three months ago. Before that time, I had never designed a piece of jewelry...ever. 

I have literally just discovered I can do this.

A little background -

I've been a Galveston/Houston resident off and on since '81.

Some years ago, I had an injury that really messed me up. A bad reaction to anesthesia, had left me with a loss of memory, and frankly, a bunch of other bs issues that must be dealt with. And some of them have been difficult. 

I've lost some skills - things that came easy before are almost impossible now. For years I've been working to recover.

I'm not complaining mind you, just sharing...and noting that I work around the challenges, and move on.

One day, three months ago, I'm looking at a seashell, and it suddenly looked ""different"". I see this detail in a way I've never noticed before, and then I hit me as an idea for a pendant.

I make it, it comes out beautiful. Since then, the ideas for new designs has just been overwhelming...It's just been constant.

Here's my Imgur album -

http://imgur.com/a/pYuPE

I have discovered something that I'm good at, and those who've seen my stuff like it too.

Now, my work is in three stores in Galveston, and I have been honored to be invited to be a guest artist for Art Walk. It's such an honor.

Oh, I also did a painting, and some antique walking Canes, made from 100- year-old golf clubs. (They will be at the Gallery)

I would love to share my work with you. Please consider this an invite.
It would be brilliant to meet you in person. (I'm told I should socialize more anyway.) If you're down this way...

To date, I've worked in over 400 different occupations (est.). Everything from a Radio DJ, to Cruise Lecturer, to Ranch Hand to Commercial Diver, Heavy Equipment Operator, to an industrial designer...
Hard to remember them all...

What I do know is all my life, just about *everything* I would try, I could do well. It just came so natural.

It took a long time to discover that everyone wasn't like this...

I have 14 patents covering a wide-range of industries and subjects and have hundreds of other projects.

I play guitar, piano and percussion instruments (haven't tried any others), write music, and started designing jewelry two months ago.

 Been all over the world. An insane level of curiosity about literally *everything* propels my world.

Short version, it buggered me up pretty good...took me a year just to learn to walk again...
Since then, I've discovered I've lost several 'abilities', my personality changed, concentration is very difficult, even simple math is a challenge now, when I could do calculus before (an engineering background). 

This has been devastating to my life. ""Core skills"" and abilities have, so far, been lost.

However, I've noticed new ""thought-sets"" emerging- ideas of shapes and designs, *very* artistic in nature.
Three months ago, I started making jewelry.

http://imgur.com/a/pYuPE#0

My friends and I have been totally surprised I could do this. One one knew...

Prior to the surgery, I'd never designed any jewelry or art piece...ever!
It's been weird, cool, interesting, troubling, and makes me wonder if anyone else has experienced this phenomenon, and how it effected their lives.
