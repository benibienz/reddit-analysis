It is painful in the UK winters but I have mostly found solutions e.g. gloves and exercise. However recently when I awake I find my hands white as if they are lifeless and and when I try and move them I cannot for a couple of seconds (sometimes 10). This has happened on a plane several times when I've been dosing for a short amount of time and currently I am on holiday in a hot could try in Europe on an uncomfortably flat bed and I awake with the same issue. What is happening to me, I am very concerned about nerve damage as I am a musician and can't think about losing the sensitivity in my fingers. Ask docs ..help!

Usually I just browse this sub as I never have anything worth submitting. (Also apologies for format as on mobile).

So Im a student in the north of the UK and I have been using a popular dating app to talk to girls over the last few months. My previous 2 relationships lasted 8 months and a month respectively. The first being with 29F who I met at work who was really fun, but a bit mental; and second 22F who was a friend who I thought I would be great with but in the end I couldn't connect with her (also we connected through talking about sex encounters so what I thought was a fun connection was really just lust.. Dumb brain). And before and in between those I have had one night stands and flings with other girls.

Ok, so I have been talking to this girl( listed as 18F) on the app for the last few weeks. She is very pretty, and seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say. Thing was that she was still in secondary school (high school). This made me wary as when I was 20 I had a relationship with a 18F who had just left school and wasn't that mature.  Anyway, this girl seemed great. She lives in my uni town but I am currently living in a bigger city 2 hours away as part of my course; however I come down most weekends to visit friends, and also party/ look for a house next year.

So  we were talking about when it would be good to meet up ( since I was in town) for a date and suggested getting a drink at a cocktail bar in her end of town. She said yeah that's great, she's excited and so an I. However just as I'm about to leave she texts me saying that btw she was 17... Not 18. After quickly taking to my friend they reassured me to still go, so I messaged her back saying this was fine and let's get coffee instead.

So I met up with her. And wow she was georgous, a lil taller than me, but very beautiful. I was a little nervous as I hadn't been on a date in a while, but it turned out great. It was only an hour date as it was in the evening and we both had things to do later, but I felt we both had a really good time. We had lots in common despite the age gap;  we both a fitness orientated and want to travel lots all over the world. It was the first time in a very long time I felt like i could really see myself with this girl.

We parted ways and I suggested dinner the next weekend, as I would be in town again. We texted later than evening and some the next day. (This post is 2 days later than the date btw). I really like this girl, even though we only spent an hour together. I talked to some more of my mates and they were fine with the age gap.. Obviously after joking that I'm a cradle snatcher and such. Personally 17 seems to young, but i think she mentioned that she would be turning 18 in a couple of weeks, which would make me feel a lil better about it. 

TL;DR I found a great girl, but she is a bit young...

So reddit, what is your opinion on all of this? Should I take it slow, out ditch since the age difference? More details?",relationships,Relationships: me(21M) with girl (17F). Too young?
