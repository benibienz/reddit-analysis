3,"Jean-Georges is mainly seafood alright, and we do like seafood but would prefer a variety. And I do like the menu in 11 Madison Park. It's a close call.",2016-04-17 14:22:52+00:00,d26bmsg,2,t1_d26ax6r,1413,AskNYC
4,"Thanks for the tips, I'll check those places out. Two Lizards especially. Jean-Georges does stand out. And the location works for us too, walking distance to our hotel. My budget is $1000 or under for a tasting menu w/wine pairing. I reckon I can get a meal for two in Jean-Georges for this. Or close to it at least.
