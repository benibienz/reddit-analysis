Hey. I'm seeking some advice from food lovers in NY. I'm visiting Manhattan from Europe soon for a special occasion. I want to make a reservation for a meal in the ""best restaurant in town"". Personally I find Yelp and trip advisor reviews hard to trust and prefer personal recommendations.

It's a once off special occasion for us and we are happy to push the boat out and spare no expense. Neither of us have experienced a three star Michelin and that would be the aim (although I know it's not the only measure of a great restaurant). Somewhere with a fine taster menu with wine pairing. Any type of cuisine really, French, Italian, Asian, modern.

So far I've narrowed it down to these places:
Eleven Madison Park
Daniel (2 star, I know but looks great)
Jean-Georges
Le Bernardin


For those of you who may have been to some or all of these places, where would you recommend? And if there's a restaurant that I'm not aware of please let me know. Thanks in advance.
