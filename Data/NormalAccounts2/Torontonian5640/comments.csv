11,"There is absolutely nothing we must do to access god's grace, it is a completely free gift from God, meant to save even the worst sinner. Paul repeats this so many times that you can't miss it... 

""4Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. 5However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness."" Romans 4

""17 If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, 18 do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. 19 You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” 20 Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. 21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either."" Romans 11

""6 And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace."" Romans 11

In regards to the passage you quoted, my reply is with another passage about when Jesus' disciples asked him a question ... ""28 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” 29 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” John 6",2016-07-18 11:43:54+00:00,d5gotnl,2.0,t1_d5gf4jn,28141.0,Christians
12,"What I'm saying is we are still sinners even after we are saved. Even if we think we are not sinning after we are saved, we are still just as sinful and just as dependent on Gods grace. The Apostle Paul talked about this too, it's a real struggle, but Jesus is the solution, because he already paid the penalty for our sins. 

"" 19For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. 20Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.

21So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; 23but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. 24What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 25Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!""

14,"Great words. Never forget no matter how unworthy you think you are, God thinks otherwise, he didn't even spare his own son from dying in your place, that's how much he loves us.

15,"I can answer that, and it's a shame the other guy blatantly gave you a cold shoulder saying ""I can't answer that I don't know you"" ... Regardless, God is love, not even the ""best Christians"" or most devout are anything because of what they did or their great actions.. When God looks at you or me, his gaze is redirected to his son Jesus, and it is by Jesus' righteousness that he judges us, otherwise none of us, not even one, would be acceptable in his eyes. It is by accepting Jesus and what he did for you that makes you a Christian, accepting and surrendering to the fact that he died in your place for your sins. That is why his last words on the cross were ""it is done."" So you see, it is through his grace alone that we call ourselves Christian and are saved, you are just as much entitled to Gods loving grace as any other human being. Do not let any person who claims to be a Christian rob you of the knowledge of God's love, the apostle Paul repeats this over and over in the New Testament. So go forth and rejoice, knowing that your Heavenly Father loves you, so much so that he didn't even spare his own perfect son from dying in your place. This is what separates Christianity from all other religions, it is not a set of rules, it is a loving gift from a loving father and is meant to set you free!",2016-07-17 22:53:33+00:00,d5g521p,3.0,t1_d5fpmpg,24892.0,Christianity
16,"Try CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) - you should start slow with little things, like instead of staying in bed for the day, get up even if that gut wrenching pain of anxiety and depression is pressing really hard, just think this does hurt but there are things I need to do which will get me better, and go brush your teeth and take a shower. The more you do this repeatedly it'll become a habit, at first it will be hard, but mornings will become more and more anxiety free as you repeatedly put in this effort. Same with all other tasks of the day, you need to see what you need to accomplish that day and go through with it, even though it will hurt for a long time before it gets better, but it will trust me! By doing tasks that need to get done you're pushing and helping you're brain to rebuild the neurons that help you easily deal with anxiety and depression. It won't be easy and quick, in fact it's probably gonna get worse before it gets better, but keep your eye on the prize! The brain won't restructure in a day, this type of stuff takes weeks and months. In the meantime do your best to nourish yourself properly, it's hard to eat sometimes I know, so take a multivitamin every day.  So recap: push yourself to do the things you need to do, eventually your brain will restructure. No need to over exhaust yourself either, just don't sit around all day looming over how you feel. Take a multivitamin daily and avoid drinking coffee, in time you will feel the benefits and you'll be able to do things right now you think you'll never be able to do.

If i would give any tips, i'd say buy a good quality 10 stop ND filter from a reputable brand such as B&amp;W or Hoya, Lee filters is good too but they are super expensive.

Best thing ever, at first it got slightly worse, but after about 2 months I was pretty much anxiety free, which is something i never thought would be possible. 

The take home thought from the CBT for me was identifying the fear and realizing that its not true, or completely blown out of proportion. For example a circular fear like ""oh no im going to have anxiety all my life and i will never enjoy anything ever again"" is just not true, its a thought created by my own mind. Just like i cant choose winning lottery ticket numbers, i cant make the affirmation that i will be plagued with anxiety forever. If you think about things like this you realize how silly and unrealistic our own fears can be. 

If you havent already, definitely do CBT. But make sure you find someone who will help you analyze your thoughts like i described.. Dont do useless things like breathing techniques, for me that made things worse :)",2015-12-22 05:30:21+00:00,cy7hmh4,5.0,t1_cy7ha7k,757.0,explainlikeimfive

It wasnt instant, and it got me thinking wow how do all these people make new friends so easily. Eventually some acquaintances and i spent more time together, working on school assignments, going out for lunch, etc. And slowly after a while, i was confident in calling them my friends. So for me it just took a lot of time.. Starting off with acquaintances, spending time with them because of something common, and eventually people you click with become your friends. And dont feel put down if some people seem to avoid you, it doesnt mean theres something wrong with you, unless you intentionally try to piss someone off haha - the other person may already have their group of friends and dont want to expand it, they may have some kind of problem of their own, or they are being idiots.

Once you get home, devote 2hrs right after class to working on your assignments, and use this time as efficiently as possible. Then go out, but try and be home by 9:00 so that you can devote one more hour to your assignments. That final hour doesnt have to be every night but at least 3/5 of your school nights should include it. Also, devote your saturday mornings to doing school work, its more relaxed and i found my brain was most refreshed and worked best earlier in the day.
