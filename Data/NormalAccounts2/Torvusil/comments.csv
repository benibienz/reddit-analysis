&gt; Juggernaut, Harbinger and Mirage. They were found together in the winter night.  In that night, most ponies seen 3 fallen star that fell in the place where these 3 colts were found. So they called this event. ""Three colts who fallen from the sky"". They wear strange cloth when they was found. Something that nopony ever seen before. They don't remembered who they were. The only thing they remembered are their name.

&gt; Nobody knew where they came from. Nobody knew who are their parent. So they were sent to orphanage. But it have a rumor that Alternate Dawn know who are them. Because once day he came to an orphanage and said to them. ""You will never have to fight anymore, please have a good life""

&gt; Master of orphanage asked him what he mean. And he just said back to her. ""It didn't important what they ever been. what they are now is important. Because the past isn't today"". Than he left from Orphanage.....And another rumor said that these 3 colts were made by Alternate Dawn with accident from Chemical X. But he already made it cleared that he didn't make them.

&gt; These 3 colt were adopted later by 3 families pony in Twilight's kingdom.  Juggernaut was adopted by mason Earth Pony. Harbinger was adopted by journalist Pegasus Pony and Mirage was adopted by Mayor Unicorn Pony.

&gt; After they found their cutie mark. They from a special group call ""Counter Cutie Mark Crusader(CCMC)"". It is a group of three colts that was assign by Alternate Dawn to keep an eye on Cutie Mark Crusader G2. To prevent them from hurting other or themselves. Prevent them from destroy or make a disaster while they finding their cutie mark.

Honestly, I would remove the cap on the total number of Riven mods, make rerolling have a set cost, and/or make the stat distributions much less RNG-based.

147,"[](/nightmaregrin) Story behind this:

[](/sp)

&gt; Luna sighed and shifted, trying to find a comfortable position. She, Twilight, and Celestia could always tell how much time was passing, no matter the place. She had counted eleven hours so far, plus the amount of time she had been unconscious. She didn't know how much that translated to in the lands above, but it was still a long time down in the Caverns.

&gt; She hadn't eaten or drunk for a solid 36 hours. She had lost her food packs in the mountains near the beginning of this expedition, but the cold had kept the hunger away for a while. Now she was starving, and very thirsty.

&gt; Sombra had been walking around doing various things the whole time. He wrote for a few hours, stayed in his room for a bit, which was the tunnel that went around a bend, went down the tunnel with the sound of water coming through it, and now he was cooking.

&gt; The smell from the bowl he was using reached Luna, and her stomach rumbled. Shut up! she ordered. She couldn't look weak, well...weaker, in front of Sombra. She turned away and laid down, smothering her nose in her front legs. Her mane drifted around her face. It had come out when she fell and was beginning to really annoy her. Stupid hair. Celestia had told her not to cut it many times, but Luna decided she would when she got back to Canterlot...If I get back.

&gt; She stared at the fire for a bit, longing for its warmth. She had almost fallen asleep when Sombra walked up behind her. ""Hungry?"" he asked. She whirled around and scooted back as far as the chain would allow.

&gt; ""N-no,"" she stammered. ""I-I'm not hungry."" Of course, at that moment, her stomach decided to growl very, very loudly. Luna blushed.

&gt; ""Yeah, sure you aren't,"" Sombra chuckled. He lifted two bowls from the counter and brought them over. ""Food and water for you,"" he told her, the bowls hovering between them. Luna looked at them.

&gt; ""W-where is the fork?"" she asked. Sombra pointed to her horn.

&gt; ""You can't lift one with that cap on your horn. Do it with your hooves.""

&gt; ""B-but I-I can't use my hooves,"" Luna responded. ""I can't unbend this one and can't touch anything with the right one."" She looked at him for an explanation.

&gt; ""Well,"" he smirked, ""guess you'll have to do it the puppy way.""

&gt; ""I beg your pardon?!"" Luna gasped. ""I am not your pet!"" Sombra just shrugged and placed the bowls in front of her.

&gt; ""Enjoy."" He grabbed his own bowl and sat down on the couch. Luna looked down at the bowls. Her stomach growled again. A bowl of water and a bowl of salad, both of which smelled heavenly.

&gt; ""Ugh. Whatever,"" she muttered under her breath. Pulling the salad bowl over, she began eating. As she was almost done, she heard a snort from Sombra.

&gt; ""Puppy Princess!"" he called in a sing-songy voice.

&gt; ""Urrrrgh!"" Luna lifted the bowl in her teeth and flung it at him. He easily caught it with his magic and continued chuckling. Luna turned away, drinking the bowl of water and kicking it aside. Don't let it be like this everyday, she prayed.",2016-11-16 18:00:51+00:00,da30kad,1.0,t3_5damw2,66.0,mylittlepony

The Super Smash Brothers series is unique compared to many other fighters as it was one of the first very popular fighting games that mixed in platforming elements into its core gameplay loop. Most fighters before were one vs one, on level terrain. But Smash added in platforms and greater verticality to the level design, meaning that players were given more mobility options to fight effectively on the relatively more intricate levels. 

In games like Street Fighter, the levels are usually just thematic background. But in Smash, they can really force you change up your strategy. This is not even taking into account the large number of simultaneous battlers, the items, the unique life system, etc.

[](/sp)

[](/lunateehee) [Child of Nightmares and Everfree by Georg](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/293833/child-of-nightmares-and-everfree) - Basically, Jungle Book meets Ponies, with a happier ending. Or as the description goes: ""When a frantic Night Guard seeks help in finding his long-lost wife and daughter in the middle of the Everfree Forest, he finds only Fluttershy able to guide him on his dangerous quest.  But as they search, they find far more than they expected, and in the end, he may be forced to accept the painful reality that the daughter he seeks may not want to return with him.""

I recommend this as it's so adorable.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Chrysalis Visits The Hague by Dan The Man](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62981/chrysalis-visits-the-hague) - Borrowing from TVTrope's explanation: It's a uniquely weird amalgamation of courtroom drama, political thriller and fantasy adventure that places Queen Chrysalis and Equestria as a whole in a war crimes tribunal procedural plot (in Hague), exploring the issues that might arise when a cynical human judicial system designed to prosecute war offences and crimes against humanity is abruptly forced to arbitrate in an ever-lasting battle between good and evil inside a magical and painfully idealistic Sugar Bowl.

[](/sp)

&gt; **Derpy, Time Turner, Dinky, Sparkler, Temporal Bubble and Cinnamon Vortex**!

&gt; I love this couple and this is the most lovey dovey thing I've ever drawn I can't express just how happy I am with those two in the back there! :D Anyway... I gave Dinky a mechanic cutie mark, and goggles, gloves and boots. I originally had her in overalls but they looked funny so I scrapped them. She's a cutie! 

&gt; Derpy met the Doctor several years after she'd adopted Sparkler and gave birth to Dinky. When she first met him she was in a rather loveless marriage with a stallion in Canterlot. The Doctor, going by the name Time Turner, was in Canterlot sight seeing when he happened upon a rather upset Dinky who was being bullied by several other foals for having a blank flank. He chased the bullies off by posing as her father and stayed with her until Derpy came to pick her up after school. Derpy and Time Turner hit it off rather well over a fast food dinner. Both were rather unusual for ponies and didn't quite fit in anywhere. The Doctor told her to visit him in Ponyville sometime, got in his Tardis and vanished. Quite excited by their adventure of the day Derpy and Dinky went home. They didn't see the Doctor for several months after that. Her husband came home drunk one night and she, being a bit clumsy, knocked over several items. He nearly broke one of her wings, cracked three ribs and left her covered in bruises. She left the minute he fell asleep, taking the girls and bolting for the train station. They went to Ponyville, the girls sleeping on the train and Derpy struggling with what had happened. When they got to Ponyville they found the house number the Doctor had given them and knocked. It was rather late but he answered and took them in. Derpy filed for divorce and remained in Ponyville for several years, getting a job as a mail mare to keep her and her daughters afloat. The Doctor helped when he could and remained a father figure to the pair. Derpy fell in love with him and her and the girls became his companions for several years. Dinky actually got her Cutie mark while helping make some repairs to the Tardis. The Doctor and Derpy eventually married, and had two foals of their own. Sparkler and Dinky were overjoyed.


&gt; **Sparkler**:

&gt; Personality: Sparkler is a kind mare, with a bit of a suborn streak and a near OCD need for organization. She can come off cold and mean sometimes, and tends to snap at others, but she always apologizes. 

&gt; Cutie Mark: Three diamonds.

&gt; Occupation: Organizational expert and time traveler.


&gt; **Dinky**:

&gt; Personality: A hard working mare with a genuine personality. She learned a lot from the Doctor and has very high morals because of him. She can't stand to see others cry and as much as her cutie mark is about fixing machines it also means she's good at fixing other ponies problems.

&gt; Cutie Mark: A wrench and screwdriver.
Occupation: Ponyville's chief mechanic, time traveler, Tardis repairer, and on occasion a counselor. She takes odd jobs at Camp Crusader and helps the CMC whenever she can.


&gt; **Cinnamon Vortex**:

&gt; Personality: Sweet as sugar and a speed demon when she needs to be. She loves to bake, and puts a lot of time and effort into it.

&gt; Cutie mark: Three cinnamon buns

&gt; Occupation: Elementary school student, assistant at Sugar Cube Corner, apprentice to Mrs. Cake and Pinkie Pie, time traveler.

&gt; **Temporal Bubble**:

&gt; Personality: A bit clumsy like his mother, but just as gentle and kind. He got his dad's love of adventure and curiosity. A bit shorter than most and with the same genetic disorder as his mother that causes their eyes to be different.

&gt; Cutie Mark: An hourglass with bubbles coming out the top

&gt; Occupation: Elementary school student, time traveler. 

&gt; Doctor Who Belongs to the BBC

Personally, that's why I've started to use the new queue much more - to give lesser known artists the time to shine. I usually post what I think will be more popular in the morning (due to the greater quantity of posts), and less popular in the evening (due to the lesser quantity of posts).

[](/takealetter) True.

[](/twiponder) I think there are two main concerns behind this issue. The first one is that certain forms of content are buried/disliked/underrepresented here.

The second one is that this sub's consensus doesn't much certain individual users' likes. It's understandable that we cannot please everyone. But, the concern here is that we'll have those members eventually stop bothering to participate in this sub, and thus, we'll lose diversity.

[](/twismile) /u/CCC_037, I think what's happening is that some of us think that the aggregation doesn't really represent our likes or neutral subjects. In some ways that's true - that's why I visit DA more often now. 

[](/sp)

[](/rdhuh) Then again, I think the main reason because of all of this is due to the smaller number of MLP content participants/creators on Reddit compared to other sites like DA. I feel DA does a better job at promoting smaller, more niche forms of content due to how the group systems work. If we had more users, perhaps we would have a more diverse set of content both here and in other parts of the Reddit ponyverse.

[](/discentia) Agreed. I would ideally like to see *some* explanatory comments in a downvoted piece, but I know that's not practical. Or, in addition to more voting, I would like to see more comments in general. Comments are much less binary than the upvote/downvote dichotomy.

Well, on a comforting note, at least this sub has a very strong bias against being a jerk in the comments.

[](/sp)

[](/twismile) On a side note, I've also taken to leaving comments on the art pages for images that I submit here. A lot of people on DA and other sites don't use Reddit, so they don't get to see the feedback posted here.

1208,"[](/sunsetsneaky) Backstory:

[](/sp)

&gt; The shrub leaves began to shift, not from movement within but from heat. They withered and turned brown as the water evaporated out of them, before finally igniting. Rodan felt a surge of power emanating out from the now burning cover and an illuminated outline become visible through the flames. A powerful, echoing voice ripped across the air once the outline got close enough that the equine form became visible.

&gt; ""You dare?!""

&gt; -Uh oh…-

&gt; Rodan shot into the air quick enough to kick up a shockwave, fortunately just barely fast enough to avoid getting hit by the three meter wide beam of fiery magic shooting past him. Taking enough time to glance back to see the affects of the fire blast, Rodan was left wide eyed upon seeing it had managed to cleanly burn through several trees and a boulder in a perfect, circular cut before being cut off. Rodan looked back at the shrubs and didn’t even need to think before his eyes focused in on the source of the blast.

&gt; Sunset Shimmer didn’t know what exactly this monster of a gryphon had hit her with, dark magic can cause all manner of unpredictable and dangerous mutations seeing as Nightmare Moon wanted only the best for her army. But, in the milliseconds between the beam being close enough for her to feel the heat coming off it and actually being hit by it, she’d fortunately realized what it’s chief component was. It was rare for one of the shadow beasts or cultists to use fire magic, but that was either what this monster was using or at least it was something very similar. Similar enough for her to use those blood enchantments Celestia had helped her get. Blood magic was a dangerous deal and could easily be a double edged sword. But once one had their specialty, it was more than easy to exploit it. In her case, it turned her into a fire magic sponge. Nothing less one would expect from the adoptive daughter of a sun goddess and sibling to a dragon.

&gt; Rodan had just shot her with a power-up.

&gt; The unicorn princess stepped into the clearing again, her hooves burning small bits of flame into the dirt and grass beneath her. A thin red and orange aura slithered across her outline; emanating from the bright glow that had consumed her cutiemark. With every pulse from her heartbeat, bits of light coursed through her veins and arteries in a way that was visible through her skin. The charge up had also added an echoing distortion to her voice.

&gt; “Do you know what burnt gryphon smells like?”

&gt; Those were the last words Rodan heard before he saw another stream of fire magic, easily twice the size of the last one, shooting towards him. Acting on instinct, he fired up his mana streams and tore open his jaws into an air splitting shriek that was chased by his own fiery beam.

&gt; Almost like some bizarre parody of a snowball fight, Rodan and Sunset Shimmer hit each other again and again with one flaming attack after another. Each successive barrage becoming more and more powerful. Every time the struggles were about to cease, either by Rodan trying to dive down and tackle the unicorn or Sunset attempting to use some other magic on the gryphon, it would fail due to Rodan being too fast to lock onto by spell but the fast charging pyro-spells and Sunset’s teleporting keeping her constantly out of range. And with enough airspace for Rodan to fly around with and the constant power boosts she was getting negating any stamina problems; neither one of them was running out of steam any time soon.

&gt; Rocks melted, ground was charred, and trees burned by convection heat alone frying them. Another struggle of mana charged plasma and magic fueled fire resulted in another stalemate. At this point Sunset Shimmer’s aura glow was bright and large enough that it was beginning to give her an alicorn-like outline, and Rodan’s glyphs and runes were beginning to swell with light themselves from the power increase.

1311,"[](/twismile) While searching for some pony content to post to certain subs, I came across [this insightful comment by DA user joeyh3](http://ziemniax.deviantart.com/journal/Do-you-also-have-this-feeling-623619439) talking about the fandom's size and stability, and how we overlook certain areas. Here's the comment:

[](/sp)

&gt; Overall, I feel that the fandom's size is relatively stable. If you look at activity on the fandom sites that publish statistics (Derpibooru and FIMFiction), then it's fairly flat - the activity of those sites isn't really growing, but it's not shrinking either. There are occasional lulls (especially during haitus times) and peaks (season start/restart, major con, movie, etc). But overall, it's stable.

&gt; However, it does have a false appearance of shrinking. This is simply because you always notice people leaving it, but you never never notice someone new entering it.

&gt; Imagine some well known artist who's been in the fandom for three years and has 2500 followers announces that they're done with pony. Could be that they got bored of MLP, could be that they're going to college/work/military and don't have time, could be any reason. But suddenly, someone who's a good artist and has been around for a while has left, and 2500 people notice them leaving. So you see the shrinking there.

&gt; Then imagine, the very same day, some new person watches MLP for the first time, they like it, and they decide to draw fan art of it. It may not be a stunning picture, or one that's too unique, but it's still good, and they have the potential to improve. Those same 2500 people are not going to notice this brand new person drawing their first piece of MLP fan art. Really, it's likely that not even ten people are going to notice them. Instead, they're just going to be hiding in the metaphorical corner, completely obscure and unknown when they're first starting off. 

&gt; But as the months go by, they get a few new fans with every image they post. Then eventually, after months, or even a year or more, of hard work, effort, and constant improvement, they finally have a decent sized follower base, people recognize them and their artwork, they're no longer some obscure name no one's ever heard of. But at that point - they've been around for a while. They're not new to the fandom anymore.

&gt; When someone leaves the fandom, it's sudden and noticeable. When someone enters the fandom, it's very subtle and no one even recognizes it. The fandom shrinks a little bit daily, but then it grows right back to where it was. However, you only ever notice the shrinking, and you're left with a false impression that shrinking is all that's going on.",2016-09-08 19:22:44+00:00,d7els7d,1.0,t3_51syif,1361.0,mylittlepony

[](/lyra) [Gazing to the Ocean of the Sky by David Silver](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/325814/gazing-to-the-ocean-of-the-sky) - A tale of a seapony mechanist (in training) deciding to visit Equestria, and the various adventures she goes on. I like it because of the variety, and how the main character interacts with the land ponies.

[](/sp)

[](/raritypaper) [Gilded Sister by Kind of Brony](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/339309/gilded-sister) - A young girl is robbed of her childhood and her life ended due to a debilitating illness. However, she's given another chance at life in Equestria, but reborn in a completely new body. This is the story of her getting to terms with the new world, growing up again, and being the sister of Prince Blueblood. I like this fic as it provides an interesting look into Blueblood's character (this time, a more positive one), the writing's pretty decent, and the premise is interesting.

[](/shiningpride) [A Talk With a Prince by Jay-The-Brony](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/343254/a-talk-with-a-prince) - Prince Shining Armor confronts Thorax alone and has some questions to ask of the latter...

1527,"[](/twismile) Alright, as several people have asked, here's a status update following the rules change over at MLPMature that happened around 7 weeks ago.

[](/sp)

[](/ajsup) For those unaware, 7 weeks ago, a new rule was implemented which prohibited the submission of ""sexy"" content to the sub. Any future content of that kind should be directed to cloppinups. This was to make the sub cater exclusively for mature content that doesn't belong in /r/mylittlepony (and similar subs).

[](/sp)

[](/lunateehee) [Here are the metrics for both MLPMature and cloppinups](http://redditmetrics.com/r/mlpmature#compare=cloppinups).

[](/sp)

[](/twipride) In summary, MLPMature has gained around 20 new subs, and cloppinups has gained around 60 new subs.

[](/sp)

[](/lunawait) In MLPMature, for the past 2 weeks, we've been getting over 5 posts per week. Just this week alone, the sub received 9 posts! Even before, we had a steady stream of 2 to 3 posts per week. And a lot of these were from non-moderators. Overall, the results for MLPMature have exceeded my expectations.

[](/sp)

[](/cadance) In cloppinups, ever since the rule change, I've been trying to keep up a schedule of 3 posts a day, 6 to 7 days a week - leading to a total of 133 posts. Though unlike MLPMature, most posts in the sub are from me. There are currently only two other regulars who submit posts there - Myrandall and Palpz. The userbase and reception is slowly growing, so that's appreciated. Still, I would like to see more participation in that sub.

[](/sp)

[](/twibeam) All in all, I would like to thank all the moderators of both subs for their hard work in enforcing the rules and finding good content to post. Moreover, I would like to thank the mods here for directing people over to MLPMature and cloppinups. I also thank the userbases for visiting the subs.

1532,"[](/changeling) Due to the recent Changeling episode, here's a grab bag of fics related to Changelings.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [The Changeling That Bugged My Heart by slDsleeper](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/295189/the-changeling-that-bugged-my-heart) - A cute guard member X changeling fic taking place right after the S2 finale. I like how the characterization of the two main protagonists, and minor world building on Changeling lore is explored.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Conversations in a Canterlot Café by Goldfur](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192085/conversations-in-a-canterlot-caf) - Taking place concurrently during the latter parts of Change of Life, it follows the story of Frothy Brew, the barista in the Canterlot Café, as he tries to put aside his strong negative feelings for changelings (created due to the trauma of witnessing the attempted changeling invasion of Canterlot) as they become regular patrons of his cafe. This one focuses a lot on the character development of Frothy and his family, as well as delving deep into the different changeling hives (based on color and aspect). I find it to have wonderful world-building, and a fascinating premise.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Catherine the Great by Scarheart](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/324293/catherine-the-great) - A small group of changeling brothers and sisters, take it upon themselves to find a new queen after Chrysalis's repeated failures. They traveled through a portal and ended up on Earth, and make Catherine, an 8-year-old girl, their Queen. Wacky hijinx occur due to the changelings' behaviors and the fact that Catherine's parents don't approve. I like it because of all the jokes and silliness of the situations at hand.

[](/sp)

[](/cadancesmile) [My Fluttering Heart](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/314882/my-fluttering-heart) by /u/TitaniumDragon - A one-shot slice of life / drama fanfic that provides a glimpse into Flurry Heart's character and family, and why none of her brothers and sisters are alicorns like she is. I **recommend this one the second most**.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [The Village Called Respite by ZOMG](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/291019/the-village-called-respite) - A story taking place in a hidden village deep within the untamed forest surrounding Neighagara Falls. When the village accepts a new family from Cloudsdale, a not-quite-altruistic pair of young changeling siblings offer a young filly friendship and a chance to find her place in the strange village she hopes to call home, as well as quell her fears and doubts. I **recommend this one the most**.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [The Majestic Tale of a Noble Hunter by ZOMG](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/343203/the-majestic-tale-of-a-noble-hunter) - A relentlessly cute comedic tale of a Changeling hunting for love, in an Equestria where the other hives have made an alliance.

However, she's given another chance at life in Equestria, but reborn in a completely new body. This is the story of her getting to terms with the new world, growing up again, and being the sister of Prince Blueblood. I like this fic as it provides an interesting look into Blueblood's character (this time, a more positive one), the writing's pretty decent, and the premise is interesting.

1788,"[](/flutternice) Well, this week has been (mostly) free of drama on this sub.

[](/sp)

[](/fluttersrs) But, it's time for some serious talk.

[](/sp)

[](/discentia) Normally, I don't like to focus on drama surrounding the community. But, the most recent one has an important take-home message, and the drama's causing some serious repercussions in the animation area. Because of this event's current volatility, I won't name those directly involved, and instead focus on the effects and lessons.

[](/sp)

[](/twiponder) **Here's the gist of it**. A certain popular pony YTer with a team of animators recently published an animation, and it caused a drama storm. Several former members of the YTer's team talked about the latter's bad work ethics and mistreatment of members, and published evidence on a Twitter account and other places. One of the pieces of evidence was the previous ""stolen/leaked DHX asset drama"" the aforementioned YTer was involved in. A lot of mud was (and still is) slung at the former's direction to make them look a like a terrible person. Long story short, a witch hunt was initiated against the YTer, and the entire situation is a mess.

[](/sp)

[](/hmmm) Because of this drama, several MLP animation videos are being taken down by their creators (like Vivareverie for example) due to fear of (legal) reprisal. So, if you enjoy a certain animation (especially if it uses show assets), please back it up just in case the creator decides to take it down.

[](/sp)

[](/twismile) Now, the moral of this entire drama is three-fold: don't let fame get to your head and cloud your judgement, don't improperly take credit from other people, and be respectful and understanding of others.

[](/sp)

[](/fluttershh) I know we're supposed to learn these morals while maturing. But sadly, many of us forget and need to be reminded.",2016-08-11 20:07:45+00:00,d6dp39a,1.0,t3_4x9o4q,4065.0,mylittlepony

Second, I look [through my bookmarked list of pony art to post](http://imgur.com/a/hUckD). Though, I could improve the list immensely by adding more character and genre folders, and using tags. Third, I look at the new stuff at Derpibooru. Fourth, I look at the drawfriends articles at EQD (though this can be rather unreliable as other people have scooped up most of the best performing stuff). Fifth, I follow the links of the popular posts here and submit other art from those artists.

[](/sp)

[](/ppcute) Keep in mind that I post to over several dozen MLP subs. So, having a large stock of pictures is great for keeping content flowing. That's also how I became curator for the Character subs in Imaginary Network Expanded.

As several forms of content, like those featuring OCs (**especially** OC ships or Canon X OC ships) get ignored and/or downvoted to oblivion by the community here.

The EQD Drawfriends (and most other MLP subs) are a better place for them to be featured IMO.

Unfortunately yes. If a fic contains material that violates rule 2, it cannot be directly linked here.

I agree with you on that. But sadly, rules are rules. At least, we can discuss the fic, just not hotlink it.

&gt; Mote of Dust

I read part of it. Thanks for reminding me to finish it.

&gt; For humans, I prefer little slice of life and comedy 

In that case, I would recommend *Silver Glow's Journal*, a fic about one of the first (Pegasus) pony exchange students travelling to Earth. It has the trademark Admiral Biscuit writing style, so expect discussions on human/pony culture and aspects of life both in-story and in the comments section. In fact, I would say around a quarter or the third of the story's memorability comes from the discussions in the comments. It's a great slice-of-life of fic, and it's updated daily.

2090,"&gt; (I have no idea what I just did in terms of Rule 2. Are links to SFW chapters of NSFW fics allowed? Are we allowed to bring up NSFW fics here?)

[](/hmmm) No. **Direct links to any chapter** of a Rule 2-violating fic are prohibited. We *can* bring up NSFW fics here (as evidenced by the discussions regarding Fallout Equestria), but we cannot talk specifically about the more explicit bits. If you want to, we'll need to take the conversation over to MLPMature or cloppinups.

2103,"[](/pinkieawe) Have a grab bag of fic recommendations! **I'm looking for good human and/or changeling fics**.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [The Changeling That Bugged My Heart by slDsleeper](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/295189/the-changeling-that-bugged-my-heart) - Well, *another* cute guard member X changeling fic. Though, this one is more of ""building on the foundation of the classics with a twist"". It's currently in progress, and I do like how the characterization and minor world building is explored.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Conversations in a Canterlot Café by Goldfur](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192085/conversations-in-a-canterlot-caf) - Taking place concurrently during the latter parts of Change of Life, it follows the story of Frothy Brew, the barista in the Canterlot Café, as he tries to put aside his strong negative feelings for changelings (created due to the trauma of witnessing the attempted changeling invasion of Canterlot) as they become regular patrons of his cafe. This one focuses a lot on the character development of Frothy and his family, as well as delving deep into the different changeling hives (based on color and aspect). I find it to have wonderful world-building, and a fascinating premise.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Catherine the Great by Scarheart](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/324293/catherine-the-great) - A small group of changeling brothers and sisters, who after the events of Canterlot, take it upon themselves to find a new queen. They traveled through a portal and ended up on Earth, and make Catherine, an 8-year-old, their Queen. Wacky hijinx occur due to the changelings' behaviors and the fact that Catherine's parents don't approve. I like it because of all the jokes and silliness of the situations at hand.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [The Village Called Respite by ZOMG](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/291019/the-village-called-respite) - A story taking place in a hidden village deep within the untamed forest surrounding Neighagara Falls. When the village accepts a new family from Cloudsdale, a not-quite-altruistic pair of young changeling siblings offer a young filly friendship and a chance to find her place in the strange village she hopes to call home, as well as quell her fears and doubts. I **recommend this one the most**.

[](/sp)

[](/lyra) [Gazing to the Ocean of the Sky by David Silver](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/325814/gazing-to-the-ocean-of-the-sky) - A seapony mare with a knack for mechanical things decides to pay a visit to overland Equestria, making friends, going on a few adventures, and bringing forth some major changes. I quite like how Cherry interacts with the other characters. Specifically, I feel that the character-building and the worlds are the strong points of this fic.

[](/sp)

[](/ajhappy) [Found You! by Sketchy Changeling](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192511/found-you) - Here's something you don't see everyday, a Maneiac X Human romance fanfic. Normally, I would kind of avoid these kind of fics. But, because it's in an uncommonly-covered area (Power Ponies-verse), and it was written by Sketchy Changeling, I was drawn to it. And boy, did I end up enjoying it. Sure, it's simple and fluffy. But, I like how it delves into the character of the Maneiac, and her reformation. I highly recommend it. It's also a short read - only 8,600+ words.

[](/sp)

[](/lyra) [My Filly, Nightshine by The Abyss](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/308995/my-filly-nightshine) - An adorable slice-of-life tale of a human adopting a batpony filly, and the adventures and bounding that happen afterward. As adorable as it sounds. In fact, I believe one member of our community is writing this fic. Highly recommend this one!",2016-07-28 17:16:00+00:00,d5uojst,1.0,t3_4v1tsd,35.0,mylittlepony

2182,"[](/pinkieawe) Have a grab bag of fic recommendations! I'm looking for good human and/or changeling fics.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [The Changeling That Bugged My Heart by slDsleeper](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/295189/the-changeling-that-bugged-my-heart) - Well, *another* cute guard member X changeling fic. Though, this one is more of ""building on the foundation of the classics with a twist"". It's currently in progress, and I do like how the characterization and minor world building is explored.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Conversations in a Canterlot Café by Goldfur](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192085/conversations-in-a-canterlot-caf) - Taking place concurrently during the latter parts of Change of Life, it follows the story of Frothy Brew, the barista in the Canterlot Café, as he tries to put aside his strong negative feelings for changelings (created due to the trauma of witnessing the attempted changeling invasion of Canterlot) as they become regular patrons of his cafe. This one focuses a lot on the character development of Frothy and his family, as well as delving deep into the different changeling hives (based on color and aspect). I find it to have wonderful world-building, and a fascinating premise.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Catherine the Great by Scarheart](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/324293/catherine-the-great) - A small group of changeling brothers and sisters, who after the events of Canterlot, take it upon themselves to find a new queen. They traveled through a portal and ended up on Earth, and make Catherine, an 8-year-old, their Queen. Wacky hijinx occur due to the changelings' behaviors and the fact that Catherine's parents don't approve. I like it because of all the jokes and silliness of the situations at hand.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [The Village Called Respite by ZOMG](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/291019/the-village-called-respite) - A story taking place in a hidden village deep within the untamed forest surrounding Neighagara Falls. When the village accepts a new family from Cloudsdale, a not-quite-altruistic pair of young changeling siblings offer a young filly friendship and a chance to find her place in the strange village she hopes to call home, as well as quell her fears and doubts. I **recommend this one the most**.

[](/sp)

[](/lyra) [Gazing to the Ocean of the Sky by David Silver](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/325814/gazing-to-the-ocean-of-the-sky) - A seapony mare with a knack for mechanical things decides to pay a visit to overland Equestria, making friends, going on a few adventures, and bringing forth some major changes. I quite like how Cherry interacts with the other characters. Specifically, I feel that the character-building and the worlds are the strong points of this fic.

[](/sp)

[](/twismug) [Twilight Skips the Good Parts by Diamond Aura](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/329642/twilight-skips-the-good-parts) - When Starlight Glimmer reads A Hearth's Warming Tail for herself the day after Hearth's Warming, she finds it to be a bit different then how she remembered. Specifically, what was Sunburst doing in the story?
Turns out that Twilight doesn't always read the whole story.

[](/sp)

[](/ajhappy) [Found You! by Sketchy Changeling](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192511/found-you) - Here's something you don't see everyday, a Maneiac X Human romance fanfic. Normally, I would kind of avoid these kind of fics. But, because it's in an uncommonly-covered area (Power Ponies-verse), and it was written by Sketchy Changeling, I was drawn to it. And boy, did I end up enjoying it. Sure, it's simple and fluffy. But, I like how it delves into the character of the Maneiac, and her reformation. I highly recommend it. It's also a short read - only 8,600+ words.

[](/sp)

[](/lyra) [My Filly, Nightshine by The Abyss](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/308995/my-filly-nightshine) - An adorable slice-of-life tale of a human adopting a batpony filly, and the adventures and bounding that happen afterward. As adorable as it sounds. In fact, I believe one member of our community is writing this fic. Highly recommend this one!",2016-07-21 22:46:47+00:00,d5llmfh,1.0,t3_4ty85f,18216.0,mylittlepony

&gt; If one of the two is unfaithful to their partner this leads to the death of who gave the mark, because it is a part of their soul in a way.

[](/twiponder) From my understanding, it's semi-grimdark content, risque or raunchy jokes, and somewhat gory content that's welcome in MLPMature. Cheesecake would probably be moved to cloppinups, but that's still under some talks. It is certainly a rather narrow area in this fandom I agree. But after much deliberation, it was decided to narrow down the scope to focus on this niche.

Just like xHaZxMaTx has said before me, I'm also one of the new moderators. After much deliberation on the Mane sub, I decided to take up the mantle as moderator here to ensure the rules are followed and to provide semi-weekly content to this sub. 

Before, it felt like the non-sexy posts were being drowned out by the sexy ones. Sure, I personally would have preferred a flairing system. But after deliberation with the rest of the mods, we decided this was the best course of action.

I'm hoping with this change that we'll get more raunchy, violent, and other pieces of content that don't fit /r/mylittlepony posted to this sub, **as well as** more activity at /r/cloppinups. I feel there's a whole bunch of valid pony-related content that's not being properly represented by the Reddit pony subs, and I aim to rectify this. I *will* be posting to both of these subs, you can count on that.

2747,"[](/nmm) As this is part of a storyline, here's the artist's description to provide context:

[](/sp)

&gt; Luna had been searching the Crystal Mountains for two weeks. The princesses had heard rumors of strange activities in the high mountains. The villagers of many scattered towns had reported to the Crystal Empire that there were dark shapes moving about in broad daylight. Many had become so frightened that only large groups of ponies left the settlements to forage for food.

&gt; The sisters had agreed that Luna should go up to the mountains and figure out what was happening. Luna knew the shadow beasts better then Celestia, and knew the spells that could defeat them. After all, she had been a shadow beast before.

&gt; Luna squinted into the biting wind. She rounded the bend in the road she was on and stopped. Nothing. This was the sixth location where a shadow being had been sighted and there was only a bleak rock wall facing her.

&gt; ""There must be more than this,"" she muttered, hefting her sword and pushing forward along the ledge-road until she could touch the stone. She growled in frustration as nothing happened. I know the villagers saw something, she thought furiously. In fact, I can feel... Just then, something icy rushed by her. Something far colder and frightening the frosty wind. She whirled...and her hoof slipped on the ledge. Flinging open her wings, she tried to stop her decent, but the wind smashed her against the cliff and she fell, her sword slipping from her magic.

&gt; She kept falling, falling past the ground and into a crevasse at the base of the cliff that had been worn away by melting snow over thousands of years. She fell into the darkness, landing with a crash on some snow that had fallen down with her.

&gt; ""Ah..."" She groaned, sitting up. One of her wings was throbbing with pain, but it wasn't broken. Her right front hoof definitely was, though. Whenever Luna tried to move it, splinters of pain shot through her entire leg. She left her shoe on to brace it, and looked around.

&gt; Darkness. Pitch black darkness all around. Luna had incredible night/dark vision, and even she couldn't see far. She was in a stone cavern, stretching as far as she could see in all directions. She lit her horn and looked up. Some rocks had fallen down after her and stopped up the hole in the ceiling, blocking that way.

&gt; ""Maybe there's a tunnel..."" She brightened the light on her horn and began walking into the emptiness. After a few minutes, without a glimpse of the wall, she sat down to catch her breath.

&gt; ""Feeling tired?"" a voice hissed. Luna leaped up by let out a cry of pain as her hoof jerked with the movement. ""You've had quite a fall.""

&gt; ""Show yourself!"" she shouted, looking around desperately.

&gt; ""Oh, I'd rather not,"" the stranger growled. ""When I do that you princesses tend to chase me halfway around Equestria."" The voice kept moving in circles around her, as if it was circling.

&gt; That rules out the Umbra ponies, Deirth, and Juorgoth Luna thought, mentally crossing out names. ""Where do you come from?"" she asked warily.

&gt; ""Oh, nice try, little princess,"" the voice rumbled, chuckling. ""I'm not a fool, you know. I'm just as old as you are.""

&gt; Cross out all the Southern beasts, Luna determined. ""Really? You sound quite a bit older."" Maybe taunting will work.

&gt; ""Hmm, good try. I see no harm in answering. I am slightly older than you are... and I have haunted you before."" The voice held a hint of triumph, if bitterness as well.

&gt; Only a few shadow beasts have ever possessed me... Luna felt something brush close by. She turned and looked harder. Nothing.

&gt; ""Oh, don't worry, you cannot see me."" Cross off Mirlander and the Nightmare creature. That leaves... Her breathing stopped, she froze, not daring to move. ""Oh, you have guessed who I am. Such a clever pony,"" the voice hissed.

&gt; ""Sombra!"" Luna breathed, not daring to say the name any louder.

&gt; ""Yes, quite right. I see you haven't changed since your banishment,"" Sombra laughed. ""Well, except maybe your Canterlot voice.""

&gt; ""But...but Princess Twilight destroyed you when the Crystal Empire returned!"" Luna's mind was whirling in circles.

&gt; ""Oh, she just shattered me. But it was just as painful as DEATH!"" Sombra roared. Something surged past Luna. Something dark and powerful. And just for a moment, two green flashes lit up. Luna gasped in fear.

&gt; ""So you are the shadow beast the villagers have been seeing?"" she demanded, trying to sound more confident than she felt.

&gt; ""Shadow beasts?"" Sombra asked. ""I have not left the caves for years.""

&gt; ""Liar!"" Luna shouted into the dark. ""Dark ponies have been seen all through the mountains. Please don't tell me it wasn't you, because the Umbra ponies have been banished and there are none that look quite as hideous as your kind,"" she snarled.

&gt; ""Oh my! You really haven't changed from before your banishment!"" Sombra laughed from the dark. ""And it was not me, even if you won't believe it.""

&gt; ""I don't!"" she retorted, trying to pinpoint where he was. She couldn't make her light any brighter or else her energy would drop too quickly. Is my light getting dimmer? she wondered. The light was slowly fading inward. No. The shadow was getting larger. Sombra was closing in.

&gt; ""Stay back!"" she warned, spreading her wings aggressively. Her legs shook in fear. 

&gt; Sombra laughed. ""Or what? You'll wave your broken hoof in my face?"" His eyes flashed a few yards to the left. Luna twisted, her eyes wide in fear. ""I must admit, you are the prettier of the two of you.""

&gt; ""Be quiet!"" Luna ordered, her eyes searching for another flash. The darkness kept getting closer.

&gt; ""Don't worry, Your Majesty, this will only take a moment,"" Sombra growled.

&gt; ""I don't plan to die today!"" Luna retorted.

&gt; ""Who said anything about dying?"" As soon as he said it, the shadows arched over her, under her, around her, wrapping her up, covering her muzzle, covering her eyes, wrapping her in a suffocating cocoon of darkness. She tried to cry out, but the only sound she could make was a quiet whimper. ""Just sleeeeeeep....""",2016-06-07 05:52:26+00:00,d3z4u3a,1.0,t3_4mxl6e,97.0,mylittlepony

[](/sp)

**Assuming all are relatively SFW:**

* Mane Six in pony-form are almost universally upvoted if it's of average or above quality.

* Mane Six in human-form are upvoted as well, but not as much as pony-form.

* Mane Six in anthro is similar, but there are noticeably more downvotes.

* Other important characters (such as Celestia, Discord, major villains, major allies) follow this trend as well, but somewhere in between the categories of the Mane Six.

* With background ponies, the trend is similar, though it starts somewhere from other important characters in human form to anthro form. There are exceptions such as Derpy, Lyra, etc.

* With OCs, they barely attract upvotes unless they stick-out or are memorable (like Horse Wife or Pun Pony).

* Even then, OCs typically start out below background ponies, and follow the general trend of upvotes as the others. Though, humanized and (especially) anthro images are really hit the hardest in terms of downvotes and apathy. That's why I don't tend to post OC Anthros as I know they won't fare well here.

4135,"[](/priceless) Well /u/ArtemisPlum, technically, she's a Draconequus (Genes: 50% Draconequus, 50% Pegasus).

[](/sp)

[](/flutterwink) Her full bio:

[](/sp)

&gt; Name: Panacea

&gt; Nickname(s): Cea, Pan, Pan-Pan

&gt; Sex: Mare/Draconeqess(??)

&gt; Parents: Fluttershy (mother), Discord (father)

&gt; Age: 18

&gt; Race:  Draconequus (Genes: 50% Draconequus, 50% Pegasus)

&gt; Talent(s): Keeping the natural balance of nature in check, despite being the daughter of the Lord of Chaos

&gt; Personality: Quiet and very reserved, and obviously shy. She does have quite a fun-loving side, mainly from her father. Is scared very easily and becomes super clingy when frightened. She also has low self confidence due to her strange appearance, though she can relate to Lilac Quartz who also is not the typical pony, which is why they have a close bond. Generally she is very sweet and gentle with anyone or anything. And with her good side comes her bad; she can be manipulative and devious like her father. She also has a short temper and has aquired the use of her mother's infamous ""Stare"". 

&gt; E.o.H: Kindness

&gt; Bio/Description: The offspring of the Spirit of Chaos himself and the shyest pony in Equestria. Her mother gave her the name 'Panacea', because it means 'the remedy to all problems', and Fluttershy believes that she will live up to her name. Although being the God of Chaos' daughter, she desperately tries not to fall into creating chaos like her father, but the odd time she will slip up and mess around on impulse. Her father isn't creating insane problems like he used to after he realized how important friendship was, but disharmony still runs in his blood. Panacea would rather use her strange magic gained from her father for good purposes, and basically takes the role of ""mother nature"", as any disharmony in nature that occurs, she tries and fixes almost seamlessly. Her cutie mark kind of resembles the good and evil in her, the delicate lotus flower showing her gentle and kind self, and the dark shadow holds her chaotic side.

[](/changeling) [A Different Love for a Change...ling by AngelShy24](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/36149/a-different-love-for-a-changeling) - Here's something you don't see everyday, Spike X Changeling OC romance. Sure, it may not have the best characterization or world-building, and the plot maybe too simple for some. But, I find it goes at a brisk, enjoyable pace. Besides, it's exploring uncommon pairings.

[](/changeling) [Conversations in a Canterlot Café by Goldfur](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192085/conversations-in-a-canterlot-caf) - Taking place concurrently during the latter parts of Change of Life, it follows the story of Frothy Brew, the barista in the Canterlot Café, as he tries to put aside his strong negative feelings for changelings (created due to the trauma of witnessing the attempted changeling invasion of Canterlot) as they become regular patrons of his cafe. This one focuses a lot on the character development of Frothy and his family, as well as delving deep into the different changeling hives (based on color and aspect). I find it to have wonderful world-building, and a fascinating premise.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Changing Odds by Music Brush](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/102939/changing-odds) - Another cute changeling romance story where a peaceful Changeling named Zuro, falls in love with a Pegasus mare. The trouble ensues when Queen Chrysalis invades Canterlot...

Though, this one is more of ""building on the foundation of the classics with a twist"". It's currently in progress, and I do like how the characterization and minor world building is explored.

And, here are **the rest**!

[](/ajhappy) [Found You! by Sketchy Changeling](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192511/found-you) - Here's something you don't see everyday, a Maneiac X Human romance fanfic. Normally, I would kind of avoid these kind of fics. But, because it's in an uncommonly-covered area (Power Ponies-verse), and it was written by Sketchy Changeling, I was drawn to it. And boy, did I end up enjoying it. Sure, it's simple and fluffy. But, I like how it delves into the character of the Maneiac,a and her reformation. I highly recommend it. It's also a short read - only 8,600+ words.

&gt; Name : Melinda

&gt; Nicknames : Linda, Lily, Mel (Only by her parents)

&gt; Parents: Shining Armor, Cadence

&gt; Age: 21

&gt; General Bio : 

&gt; She's a brave, adventurous and bold mare.

&gt;  She always puts the others first.

&gt;  She wants to be part of the royal guards to help the others but her parents disagree with her. 

&gt; She loves to go on adventures.

&gt; Relationships : She's not in well term with her parents. She thinks that they can't understand her. But before she told them about being a royal guard she was really close to her father. It was already kind of hard to spend time with her mother.

&gt; Melinda has few friends in the crystal empire but some of them are obviously friends with her because she's a princess. 

&gt; She doesn't spend a lot of time with the mane 6's kids but before she spent a lot of time with her cousins, especially Aydan. She met Topaz Flare and they became friends immediatly because they didn't judge each other. Topaz didn't even know she was talking with a princess the first time they met.

4645,"Here are my current recommendations of this week based on my readings. Sure, several of them are the same from before, but I like them a lot.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [A Different Love for a Change...ling by AngelShy24](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/36149/a-different-love-for-a-changeling) - Here's something you don't see everyday, Spike X Changeling OC romance. Sure, it may not have the best characterization or world-building, and the plot maybe too simple for some. But, I find it goes at a brisk, enjoyable pace. Besides, it's exploring uncommon pairings.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Change of Life by Goldfur](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/141487/change-of-life) - A cute romance/slice-of-life story about Zevan, a changeling who's old life was ruined due to Chrysalis's botched invasion attempt, but discovers a new life in the process. I recommend it due to the character development, and the fact that it sets up a fascinating world that is latter expanded upon in future fics of this series.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Conversations in a Canterlot Café by Goldfur](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192085/conversations-in-a-canterlot-caf) - Taking place concurrently during the latter parts of Change of Life, it follows the story of Frothy Brew, the barista in the Canterlot Café, as he tries to put aside his strong negative feelings for changelings (created due to the trauma of witnessing the attempted changeling invasion of Canterlot) as they become regular patrons of his cafe. This one focuses a lot on the character development of Frothy and his family, as well as delving deep into the different changeling hives (based on color and aspect). I find it to have wonderful world-building, and a fascinating premise.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Changing Odds by Music Brush](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/102939/changing-odds) - Another cute changeling romance story where a peaceful Changeling named Zuro, falls in love with a Pegasus mare. The trouble ensues when Queen Chrysalis invades Canterlot...

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [The Changeling That Bugged My Heart by slDsleeper](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/295189/the-changeling-that-bugged-my-heart) - Well, *another* cute guard member X changeling fic. Though, this one is more of ""building on the foundation of the classics with a twist"". It's currently in progress, and I do like how the characterization and minor world building is explored.

[](/sp)

[](/ajhappy) [Found You! by Sketchy Changeling](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192511/found-you) - Here's something you don't see everyday, a Maneiac X Human romance fanfic. Normally, I would kind of avoid these kind of fics. But, because it's in an uncommonly-covered area (Power Ponies-verse), and it was written by Sketchy Changeling, I was drawn to it. And boy, did I end up enjoying it. Sure, it's simple and fluffy. But, I like how it delves into the character of the Maneiac,a and her reformation. I highly recommend it. It's also a short read - only 8,600+ words.

[](/sp)

[](/lyra) [My Filly, Nightshine by The Abyss](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/308995/my-filly-nightshine) - An adorable slice-of-life tale of a human adopting a batpony filly, and the adventures and bounding that happen afterward. As adorable as it sounds. In fact, I believe one member of our community is writing this fic. Highly recommend this one!

[](/sp)

[](/cadancesmile) [Lovey Dovey and the Business Pony by Crystal Wishes](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/215605/lovey-dovey-and-the-business-pony) - A silly short tale of a professional matchmaker trying to match up an eligible bachelor in Manehattan that is not interested in love. It parodies the oft-used format of a stereotypical romantic comedy, but is lovable all the same. If you like this story, the sequel [Lovey Dovey and the Uncertain Stallion](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/249295/lovey-dovey-and-the-uncertain-stallion) continues the romantic adventures of the two titular characters.

4801,"Here are my current four recommendations of this week based on my readings:

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Change of Life by Goldfur](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/141487/change-of-life) - A cute romance/slice-of-life story about Zevan, a changeling who's old life was ruined due to Chrysalis's botched invasion attempt, but discovers a new life in the process. I recommend it due to the character development, and the fact that it sets up a fascinating world that is latter expanded upon in future fics of this series.

[](/sp)

[](/changeling) [Conversations in a Canterlot Café by Goldfur](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192085/conversations-in-a-canterlot-caf) - Taking place concurrently during the latter parts of Change of Life, it follows the story of Frothy Brew, the barista in the Canterlot Café, as he tries to put aside his strong negative feelings for changelings (created due to the trauma of witnessing the attempted changeling invasion of Canterlot) as they become regular patrons of his cafe. This one focuses a lot on the character development of Frothy and his family, as well as delving deep into the different changeling hives (based on color and aspect). I find it to have wonderful world-building, and a fascinating premise. I highly recommend reading this one.

[](/ajhappy) [Found You! by Sketchy Changeling](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192511/found-you) - Here's something you don't see everyday, a Maneiac X Human romance fanfic. Normally, I would kind of avoid these kind of fics. But, because it's in an uncommonly-covered area (Power Ponies-verse), and it was written by Sketchy Changeling, I was drawn to it. And boy, did I end up enjoying it. Sure, it's simple and fluffy. But, I like how it delves into the character of the Maneiac,a and her reformation. I highly recommend it. It's also a short read - only 8,600+ words.

Because there is no official name yet, I call her ""Umbra"".

[](/sp)
&gt; First art of 2016

&gt; This one was inspired by the Star Wars movie. I started to think, what kind of world will be for the children of the current heroes or villains. I wanted to do some unexpected characters. Not many little princesses... but something more depressing.

&gt; I imagined, that the main hero would be the daughter of Sombra and Hope, Amber. She is a gem-mage, as a mix of her daddy's shadow crystal ability and her mother's light power. She can sense the gemstones like Rarity, but she can manipulate them to grow or she can use the hidden magic inside them. She was raised in isolation, because her parents moved far to the north into a little cottage. For this, she don't have much friends... except a very unlikely one.
Queen Chrysalis received her divine judgement a very funny way: in the person of her son. The Changeling Prince - or Stinger as he calls himself - is a real troublemaker and gives his mother the shivers and headaces. He is not a bad person, but he never shuts his mouth, just like his mom. A true rebell prince, who come and go, as he pleases. 
As for the turning of the world, tragedy struck the family of Princess Twilight, as her son assumed power and became the dictator of the Equestrian Empire, forcing the princesses into exile, on the Moon. Civil war ravages the land, as he is attacking his cousin's, Princess Aurora's kingdom, the northern Crystal Empire, the last free nation of Equestria.

Gotcha. I'll get that to you tomorrow.

&gt; I did not. I rarely have time to read all 3 fics, so since I'd already decided on reading Integration I gave Facing Changes a miss.

I understand. Time can be precious.

&gt; Also the premise leaves me a bit cautious.

After reading through the entirety of that fic, I found nothing objectionable in the content. It's a really a story of adjusting and understanding.

4899,"&gt; Do you know of any good shorter fics?

How short (in words)? I think I can find one or two that I enjoyed. I just need to double-check the names.

&gt; Changelings seem almost too good a topic to write about. Authors have all these interesting ideas about how they might work, that they tend to write long, descriptive stories fully explaining their own headcanons. This often is to the detriment of the story itself.

Personally, I don't mind that. I feel the longer length allows for more development. Then again, different strokes after all.

By the way, did you read Facing Changes /u/stphven? I'm going to do my post of that fic soon, but wanted to see if you have any comments.",2016-02-12 03:07:04+00:00,czwvcb5,4.0,t1_czwug6k,1326.0,mylittlepony

4904,"&gt; Assuming you read the whole story, what got you through the early chapters when very little was happening? Was there some element which you enjoyed which I overlooked? Or some aspect which bothered me but you didn’t mind?

[](/twiponder) I don't know. I don't mind slow build-up and liked how it gradually built up lore to where Caramel actually reached the hive. That's what I feel this fic does best: world building on changeling society. The characters are more forgettable in my book, barring a few (Caramel, his changeling friend, [Sarassflash](/spoiler), and Chrysalis).

[](/sp)

&gt; Were the explanations for the various character motivations handled well, in your opinion?

[](/hmmm) I believe so. I felt *most* of their motivations were handled suitably. Sure, there were some sore spots, but it seems that the author ironed those out over the course of the fic.

[](/sp)

&gt; How did this changeling headcanon compare to other headcanons? Hive structure, caste system, queens’ interactions, etc.

[](/changeling) I really enjoyed reading about the caste and hive structure, with the [old lost city and the many dangers of living underground](/spoiler).

[Facing Changes by Sketchy Changeling](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/167781/facing-changes) - At 30,803 words total, this is the story of a child who's father finally found love after being alone for so long. However, the one he found... is Celestia herself. I like this fic as it breathes more life into the vast HiE/PoE genre.

[Found You! by Sketchy Changeling
](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/192511/found-you) - A little bit shorter here at 8.627 words. This takes place in the Power Ponies verse, and is a cute romance between the Mane-aic and a human. I like it due to the character building.",2016-02-04 04:19:58+00:00,czn7fr6,,t1_czfd1a0,,mylittlepony

I need to get back to recording parts for my Voidspire Tactics LP, so I can get closer to completing it. I *really* need to get started on another series as the company who developed the game is in trouble.

* [A Different Love for a Change...ling by AngelShy24](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/36149/a-different-love-for-a-changeling): A cute Spike X Changeling story that clocks in at a ""reasonable"" 42,350 words total. Basically, a changeling gets kicked out of Chrysalis's hive and sneaks into Ponyville, where she makes some friends and develops a romantic interest with Spike. It may not be deep or innovative, but it's a fun read overall.

* [My Little Dashie by ROBCakeran53](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1888/my-little-dashie): One of the classic MLP G4 fanfics released over 5 years ago. Many of us have already read it, but I find this to be a fine time to read over it (again) and analyze it. For those not in the know, it's a 12,524 word one-shot where a man living in a bleak environment finds a filly Rainbow Dash in a box. Heartwarming moments (excluding the end) ensue.

[](/flutterfear) Specifically on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/3zf2dy/ponymov_fluttershy_by_aleksandra_bodler/), there was some drama (mainly in the downvoted sections now) about how it's a fanwork (cosplay) of a NSFW source material (Pony.MOV series). Though, the cosplay itself is SFW and doesn't thread close to Rule 2 (IMO).

[](/sp)

[](/twiponder) In essence, I think the whole issue is about whether we should allow SFW fanworks of NSFW fanworks.

&gt; Something that took a year longer than I should've completed. I absolutely love the Fire emblem series. Awakening proves to be one of my top favorites. Especially the criticals. So I decided to try to draw some critical portraits for mlp characters. Keep in mind that this was in a style that needed more practice a year ago. May do more in the future. 

&gt; So how about some quotes?

[](/twipride) I've been long awaiting this title, and did not disappoint *at all*. 

[](/sp)

[](/twibeam) Rise of the Clockwork Stallions is a platfom shooter starring our favorite ponies (and others). Over 70 levels with branching paths, 50+ playable characters with differing stats and abilities, the ability to play as two characters in each stage, fun and varied boss encounters, all the easter eggs and goodies, and the other unlockables (having an effect, cosmetic only, or just bragging rights).

[](/sp)

&gt; Read ""The Bridge"" here: https://www.fimfiction.net/story/121836/the-bridge-a-godzilla-mlp-crossover

&gt; The duo departed, leaving Aria and X in a perpetual glaring contest that lasted for a good minute before either of them budged. Aria took the final step forward and reached out towards X's face. She smirked when he leaned away slightly but was unable to move back enough to keep her from reaching his mask.

&gt; ""That thing creeps me out.""

&gt; Just when her fingers were about to curl around the edge of the shroud, a strong grip shot up and snapped around her wrist. Aria flinched momentarily, but held her ground. Monster X gently but unflinchingly pulled her hand away with his freed hand.

&gt; ""The cables were quite secure, took me awhile to undo the hooks without alerting any of you.""

&gt; Aria kept her face flat despite the setback, instead glancing down into X's raised sleeve. Sure enough, she saw a tell tale, golden, metallic glimmer in the faint light. She peered through X's eyes as she managed to lift her arm up slightly despite his grasp.

&gt; ""Don't think I buy that nonlethal bullshit. I remember last night.""

&gt; Trails of memory coursed through X's head as he tried to recall what all had unfolded upon the last moon rise. But, past a point where he blacked out on Zenith, it was nothing but a hazy blur no matter how much he tried to strain his memory. All he could recall were a few scattered still images. One of which was Aria cornered inside a tree trunk, but the context and connection was still lost upon him.

&gt; ""What are you talking about? What happened?""

&gt; She took X's sleeve in her free hand and slid it down slightly, revealing Kaizer Ghidorah's  golden bracer still clad upon his forearm.

&gt; ""Other than you not acting like you? I attempted a hex and.. well..""

&gt; X's attention was drawn away from wondering about the armor and back to Aria. The subtle glow upon her eyes metamorphosed. Trickles of red overtook the violet in her irises as another waving stream of stray graviton churned the air.

&gt; ""Got a few changes.""

&gt; She spoke with a stern expression. X looked at her for some time. He was facing Aria Blaze, but it felt like he was visually squaring off with something else entirely. He didn't like it one bit, let alone why she was bringing this up in private.

&gt; ""So I can see... Does the alpha siren know?""

&gt; ""Adagio...doesn't...need to.""

&gt; ""You're planning something, aren't you witch.""

&gt; ""Only keeping it less complicated. If Adagio knew she'd just try to take control again and muddy the waters. Back at the hospital, this power was the only thing we had that could hurt it. It came from you, so you are going to show me how to use it.""

&gt; X let go of Aria's wrist, speaking in words of caution as he looked at something he did not know.

&gt; ""Let me guess, so you can protect your family from our enemy?""

&gt; Aria let go of X's sleeve and turned around, crossing her arms. She turned her head around, eyes still glowing red for some time until it slowly started to dissipate.

&gt; ""And then protect them from you...""

This image was created by Raver1357. If you wish to watch someone for this artwork, please watch him!

Species: Manticore Changeling

Gender: Female

Parents: Queen Chrysalis the Changeling and an Unnamed Manticore

Nicknames: Mel

Residence: Queen Chrysalis' Hive


Personality: Myrmelia is similar to the other Changelings in her hive, she is completely loyal to her Queen and does all that is told of her like a loyal pet. That doesn't mean she has to be loyal to the other Changelings however, she is rather wild due to her genetics. She is known to go crazy at Changelings who don't follow orders, and those who mess up their missions given by their Queen. This comes in the form of a good tongue lashing in most cases, but in others she may get physical. She has a large temper, and claws to back it up, however she's also known to be headstrong, at times getting in over her head.


Main Interests: Loyalty to her Queen and destroying all that defie her.

Theme Song: ""Porter Robinson ft. Urban Cone - Lionhearted""


Myrmelia was created as somewhat of an experiment by Queen Chrysalis. After her defeat in Canterlot, she realized her army wasn't strong enough. Simply being able to change their form wasn't enough when it came to fighting, her Changelings needed to be bigger, stronger and more fight ready. That is when she got herself a rather devious idea, if she were to create Hybrids of the Changeling and other creatures, perhaps they could evolve as a species to develop more battle ready traits. Her subordinates were ordered to capture a specific list of creatures to do her experiments on, and a Manticore was one of them.

As the caged creature was wheeled into her throne room, the Queen plotted through her mind about the sort of abilities her new child would have. Gathering all her strength, knowing full well how much a spell of this magnitude was going to take out of her already weakened state, she fired a magical beam at the Manticore as it roared in fear. Moments later when the light subsided, a Changeling mare stood before them, her mane similar to that of a lions, the ears were like the Manticore's, and her body long and slender like a Changelings with a red and yellow shell on her back. Her front legs had paws with sheathable claws, her wings were a mixture of the holy bug wings and that of a bats, and the tail, her most defining features, was a large scorpion tail with what looked like a Changeling horn on the tip. Her eyes resembled the Queens an sharp teeth lined her mouth. Chrysalis fell to the floor, weakened by the spell she had cast but a smile remained on her face. ""Excellent, this truly is a battle ready drone."" she scoffed.

In the coming months the Queen kept a close eye on her new drone. She learned that she had the same shape shifting powers as all Changelings do, rather than coming from a horn however it came from the tip of her tail. She was also able to basic magic with it as well and the majority of Changelings do, nothing overly powerful like the Queen. Her paw contained very sharp claws like a lions and she found she was an expert at using them. She could fly like a Changeling and like many was more than eager to follower her orders. Though she, like many of the hives Changelings are technically the child of Chrysalis, they do not call her Mom or think of her as such, they call her Queen, as the same with bug hives the Queen creates many of the Changelings that exist. They are not considered Princes or Princesses unless they have a certain gene that is able to be sensed by the other Changelings.

The key element of Myrmelia appeared to be her tail, as that is where all her magic stems from, but it was found that it did much more than magic. If she were to stab a creature with it, it would inject them with a nasty poison that would weaken the creature and allow for an easy ambush. Once the poison has worked its magic, Myrmelia is able reverse the flow of her tail and take in as much of the love energy the creature has as she can. The Queen found this especially interesting, for if all Changelings were to evolve to develop tails such as these, they'd have no need to trick ponies into getting their love energy, they'd be able to take it by force.

The Queen noted Myrmelia's hot temper, and the way she disciplined the other Changelings when they failed or ignored orders. This pleased her, and she is currently considering making her one of her Generals, however she's not sure if she's ready yet considering how reckless she is. She has gone into battles she clearly couldn't win, her overconfidence getting her into big big trouble.

Quote(s): ""You disobeyed a DIRECT ORDER. You've heard the stories, do YOU want to evoke these claws?""
""That was such a simple task, a FOAL could have done it, what do you have to say to yourself you whelp?""
""Yes my Queen, I will evoke my wrath upon the heads of those creatures!""

6720,"[Shades of Night](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/187368/shades-of-night), by Sketchy Changeling (about 70.3K words long).

A nice romance story taking place in a universe (post Season 3) where Equestria was able to open portals to Earth (and vice versa), so there are humans and ponies intermingling. Essentially, it's a combination of a Human X Night Mare Moon romance plus redemption tale for the latter.

&gt; Here's the Somblestia/""Celesticord"" family~!

&gt; Left to Right:

&gt; Mirror! King Sombra

&gt; Princess Celestia

&gt; Princess Aria

&gt; Prince Enigma

&gt; Discord

&gt; To explain (SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T READ THE COMICS):
&gt; In the ""Reflections"" arc of the comics, [our heroes go to a reverse world. Everyone who's good is bad, and everyone who's bad is good. Ergo, Celestia was evil and Sombra was good. We discover that the Good Princess Celestia was traveling to this world on occasion, and had fallen in love with the Mirror King Sombra (and he returned these affections). However, this constant jumping caused the worlds to merge, giving the Evil Celestia and Evil Luna a chance to invade the Main Universe. To stop it, Mirror Sombra used the elements of Harmony and his own body to drain the evil from Mirror Celestia and Mirror Luna, throwing the worlds back into balance and unmerging them. This however costed him, making him turn evil. This caused his and Celestia's romance to split for the greater good.](/spoiler)

&gt; In my Next Gen, Celestia managed to get pregnant with Aria just before everything went south. Once she returned, she gave birth to Aria and raised her on her own. Discord, both wanting a child of his own and wanting to bring Celestia some happiness, created Enigma. While not being birthed from Celestia, Enigma does have her DNA. She happily accepts him as her son, despite only being friends with his father, Discord.",2015-10-17 02:39:29+00:00,cw2l921,1.0,t3_3p2et5,2103.0,mylittlepony

&gt; Fragment from Hearts Of Iron by Sabaton

&gt; Context:

&gt; As the combined armies of  Equestria and Equalia made their way into Hive's capital city, thousands of changelis abandons theirs homes to save their loved ones and themselves from the imminent carnage the ponies have now bought upon their kind, millions of them have already lost their lives in the onslaught and even more are being hunted and killed on the spot. The remaining commanders despite of the Queen's orders to break the siege around the city, devised a plan to crate a small escape corridor trough the pony lines in order to evacuate the city and save as many lives as possible.

&gt; ---

&gt; Meet Humble and Pastel Lilly! :D fluttershy babies. FlutterShy married Bulk Biceps and.... Bulkshy OTP.

&gt; Humble is the older, kinda protective and kinda grumpy brother almost everyone has. He's actually very mellow, and he's one of the only other ponies who know Angel's true nature. Humble is literally living proof of irony. He doesn't take that lightly, but will rub that back into ponies faces when he's a little too honest. He despises Angel for so, so many reasons. Yet everyone doesn't seem to notice. He is a firepony and works almost everyday. He's one of the youngest on his squad but is very talented and skilled. Humble is close friends with Princess Skyla and Princess Raine. Humble had a crush on Raine when they were in their young teens, but he seems to be more netural about it by now. Although she is the only pony who can really make him smile and actually make him laugh and bring out his true, kind nature. Humble is The oldest out of all the Mane 6 kids, So that means Fluttershy and Bulk Biceps decided to have a foal very early on. They both wanted to have children soon, so they did.

&gt; Pastel Lily is one of the youngest of the Mane 6 kids, she is also the strongest. Her and Sweet Apple usually have competitions to see who is stronger (Just like AppleJack and RainbowDash) But it would always come to a tie, almost every single time. Lilly admires her dad and loves to work out. But, it's not her forte. Her real love is helping the weather ponies and she is very skilled when it comes to a light rain, or a sunny drizzle. Lilly's best friend is Jelly soul. The two are inseperable, and want to be sneaky, but they're too good for that. Lilly looks very frail and dainty, but call her either of those and she will flex those words out of you. She also loves showing up Colts who try to make her feel bad, or try to show their ""puppies"" to  her. She had mad dogs and she's not afraid to show them off.

&gt; The two are very muscular, but Humble kinda has to, so he can keep up and have great stamina for rescues c: I also gave Pastel Lilly an update on her mane, it's to resemble more on her personality.

7101,"&gt; It's admirable that you personally take poorly-construed criticism well, but it sounds like you're suggesting users aren't responsible for what they say.

Apologies for that misunderstanding. People should be accounted for what they're saying. Is that people should also be more ""thick-skinned"" to criticism or ""weird""/""""disturbing"" comments.

And yeah, I've been through several ""rough"" communities.

&gt; Regardless of how content creators can or should handle feedback, there's undoubtedly been a rise of comments recently that aren't all that healthy for the community. Even if they weren't written with malicious intent, users definitely need to be more mindful of how their words can affect others. 

Yeah, for this community, there have been more posts pushing on Rule 2. I am just worried about what may be caught in the crossfire when they'll inevitably be a pushback.

&gt; Maybe something similar would encourage people to think twice before posting something that could be misinterpreted as nasty?

Certainly! I would also amend that statement to also include *where* to post those statements which are ""inappropriate"" for this community.

7105,"[](/ajcry) My feelings about this matter are *complicated*.

[](/sp)

[](/twiponder) Time for a short story. 

[](/sp)

[](/fluttershy) I make videos (show-offs, playthroughs, etc.) about games, and have helped artists in other fandoms in the past. I've seen fellow artists (and myself) get discouraged and leave due to negative (or ""inappropriate"" comments). There have been times where I myself, questioned why I was creating and publishing my works, until I came to a realization of sorts...

[](/sp)

[](/fluttersrs) People are people. They have varying tastes and derive enjoyment from different things in different fashions. Some are hostile, some are supportive, and some are in the other categories. And they express it using differing methods as well. As long as we don't force (or harm) others to enjoy what we enjoy, it's good. But, at the same token, we must try to be open to new ideas, and try not to hamper on others enjoyment as long as they don't force it on us.

[](/sp)

[](/abmeh) In this world, you need to train yourself to filter out negativity and disturbing stuff and look at the positives. Or more cynically, harden yourself up. When I was a kid and young teen, I used to be *much* more idealistic about matters. But I have gradually hardened due to experiences both offline and online. This is especially true with the advent of the internet increasing attention of problems, and all the various comments everywhere. It's sad that it happens, but that's currently how our world is.

[](/sp)

[](/fluttersrs) Moreover, in most cases, people are not deliberately trying to be malicious, just being foolish.

[](/sp)

[](/twismile) Once I came to those realizations, life became much more enjoyable.

[](/sp)

[](/twiponder) So at least to me, blaming the commenters would be hypocritical. I understand these comments kind of being against Rule 2 of this sub, but discouraging the artist? I don't know. I would take those comments as signs that more people are enjoying my work - hence positive comments, and more encouragement for me to keep trucking on. Then again, it's personal opinion.

[](/sp)

Most recently can be heard in the season 5 premier voicing Double Diamond. Brian’s work includes characters such as Marvel’s Wolverine and Venom. He has worked on noted animes such as Death Note, The Vision of Escaflowne, and Black Lagoon. He has even done work on the anime classic Dragonball Z as the great Saiyan Prince, Vegeta.

&gt; Name: Crystal

&gt; Nickname/s: Cryssi

&gt; Parents: Rarity and Spike

&gt; Description: As Rarity's first daughter, Crystal will inherit Carousel Boutique when she passes it on to her. Crystal is kind and humble just like Spike and she is one of the most loyal friend anyone can have. She loves wearing and customising ribbons and she also enjoys styling manes of other ponies. Her dream is to run Carousel Boutique and sell the ribbons that she made so that others may wear them. She can only use magic.


&gt; Name: Jamie

&gt; Nickname/s: Jay Jay, the J, James

&gt; Parents: Rarity and Spike

&gt; Description: Jamie loves flying with his dad especially during the summer. When he breathes fire, it's not the type an ordinary dragon would breathe out. His fire can change colours which ever colour he wants and puts on a beautiful show with it. Rarity and spike discovered his special ability while he was still a baby nearly getting them hurt but instead they were amazed not knowing that it would be his talent in the future. He's Crystal's tagalong because they are close siblings. He hates it when others pinch his cheeks and that turns him from a cute and innocent baby dragon-pony to an aggressive fire-breathing beast. He can only fly.

7479,"&gt; Discord had anticipated all this in the heart of his enemies' power and he pressed his assault relentlessly. For three days, he pounded entire city with a meteor shower of untold proportions, until everything except the palace grounds had been reduced to burning rubble. The outer defenses, at the time just wooden palisades, were abandoned when dragons began attacking en-masse. Now there was just the main wall and the keep left. But the Royal Sisters were not keen on going down so easily. They saved the meteors and stones that Discord and his troops had rained down upon their city and curtly returned fire. ERA troops made frequent excursions using secret exits to harass larger hordes, drawing them away from the keep. It was enough to prevent Discord himself from taking the field, but it was not enough to make a dent in the vast hordes outside.

&gt; When the rest of the ERA finally arrived a week later, they fought the very fabric of reality. Discord took no chances, turning the air inside the lungs of the first cavalry wave into fire, killing them instantly, but he and his armies were not able to make any progress against the ERA's defensive emplacements. Heavy trebuchets threw enormous barrels of flaming pitch, discouraging Discord's forces from attacking in force while pegasi archers picked off particularly dangerous enemies. A stalemate had been reached. Neither side could achieve victory through strength of arms or magic.

&gt; Two months into the siege, Luna and Celestia retrieved a large amount of gold, several of the smaller meteors from outside, six gemstones from the treasury--an orange citrine, a pink opal, an amethyst, a blue topaz, a ruby, and a magenta tourmaline, and disappeared into the castle smithy. From these mundane items, they forged the Elements of Harmony. They imbued these artifacts with what they had discovered embodied Equestria best over the course of the war: the friendship of the three races for the benefit of all.

&gt; The Siege of Canterlot was broken in spring of 1500 BNR with a blinding flash of light. With Discord imprisoned in stone, his armies rapidly collapsed and fled into the Everfree Forest. There was no longer a need for a large standing army. Most of the ERA was disbanded, its soldiers were given generous stipends and they returned to their family trades as civilians. 

&gt; In remembrance of their sacrifice, a high relief mural was carved into a wall near the palace labyrinth where it still stands today, a silent reminder of what it had taken to create the unbroken peace we know and love today. The castle itself became more of a museum, as a new palace was constructed in the newly cleared portions of the Everfree Forest.

&gt; Post-war law enforcement became the responsibility of the 5th Cavalry Battalion of the East Canterlot Regiment, now retrained. These new Royal Guards were to become the public face of security. 

&gt; At last Equestria was at peace, and so began the Classical Era.

&gt; -Feather Quill, ""A Brief History of the Classical Era"", Prologue, 1200 BNR

&gt; =========

&gt; The ERA's Commanders-in-Chief are the Royal Sisters, but they are not concerned with strategic details except in dire situations. Often times, they will task the Commander-at-Arms, usually a general, with an objective. It is then up to the CAA to determine how these objectives will be achieved.

&gt; The CAA has at his or her command five regiments, two for Canterlot, two for Hoofington, and one for Trottingham. Each regiment is led by a brigadier and consists of 5,000 soldiers and support staff. Every last pony is trained and expected to fight in the event of a battle, even the cooks. A single regiment consists of five battalions of 1,000 ponies each, which are led by colonels.

&gt; The battalion is further broken up into ten companies. The company, 100 strong and led by a captain, is the highest level of organization that consists of a single troop type. A battalion might have 7 cavalry companies, 2 siege-works companies, and an engineering company.

&gt; . . .

&gt; A cavalry battalion is never completely cavalry, as this is contrary to the Combined Arms Doctrine laid down by General Sunshield in 1565 BNR. Rather, a cavalry battalion is a rapid reaction force with only light siege-work support. They often follow behind reconnaissance elements to take advantage of undefended areas or thin spots in the enemy ranks.

&gt; Because a cavalry battalion's siege company carries only ballistae, often times battlemages and pegasi archers are relied upon completely for ranged support. While this makes the battalion more mobile, it leaves unable to combat fortified positions. Hence, they prefer to avoid slugging matches if possible, leaving more formidable enemies for a heavy infantry or siege battalion to mop up.

&gt; . . .

&gt; A lance corporal is the lowest rank for a soldier to be considered a non-commissioned officer (NCO). Commonly called ""lance jacks"" among the troops, they are generally second in command to a full corporal or a sergeant in a section of ten ponies.

&gt; . . .

&gt; Battlemages are the heavy hitters in any full-strength cavalry formation. While other units serve their own vital purposes, the battlemage has the unique ability to kill a very large number of enemies in a very short period of time at a very long distance. On the defensive, they may raise magical shields or heal their comrades, even dispel minor curses. But this comes at the cost of speed. Battlemages require gem shards for maximum combat effectiveness and often times must carry this burden alone. Very few of them can fly, making them the slowest element during advancing and retreat. Like all unicorns, they may use their horns in melee, but are weak compared to an earth pony's enemy tossing charge.

&gt; -Brigadier Russet, ""The Civilian's Guide to the Equestrian Regular Army"", 1550 BNR",2015-09-18 17:16:11+00:00,cv61vxy,2.0,t1_cv61vkg,16.0,mylittlepony
7480,"[](/wahaha) Backstory time according to the artist!

&gt; While historians generally agree that the current state of affairs in Equestria is best described as ""Pax Equestria"" (Equestrian Peace), this was not always so. The Elements of Harmony, the ultimate trump card, are powerful magical artifacts, and the Royal Sisters did not create them overnight. It took many years to forge these relics, and back then Equestria was a very different place.

&gt; Shortly after the thirtieth anniversary of Hearth's Warming, a new force for disharmony came to the land. Not from within, and not from the heart this time, but from places unknown. Discord came to Equestria around 1770 BNR like some terrible natural disaster, overwhelming all in his path. His armies consisted of Dragons, Ursas, Manticores, Cockatrices and a verisimilitude of ponies corrupted by his chaotic powers. The only defense available were the pegasi warriors, but they had grown soft after so many years of peace and tranquility. They were swept aside like so much chaff in the wind.

&gt; Discord completed his campaign in 1765 BNR and secured his place as the supreme authority in Equestria. He ruled the land with an iron grip. Disharmony was the rule, not the exception, and the places that ponies call home today were hostile, mind-warping environments. 

&gt; In the midst of all this, the Royal Sisters heard the plight of their people and descended from the heavens. In one day, they reclaimed a small portion of Equestria, an oasis in the chaos. It was a small fledgling nation, consisting of the city-states of Canterlot, still under construction, Trottingham, Hoofington, and numerous smaller villages. Ponies who had thus far been able to escape Discord's corruption flocked to the protection of the Royal Sisters, and Equestria grew.

&gt; This did not escape Discord's attention, however. He needed non-corrupted ponies to be the victims of his pranks as well as breeding stock to fill the ranks of his armies. The massive flight from his lands was proving to be a thorn in his side as population growth in his domain shrunk precipitously. At this rate, Equestria might one day be strong enough to challenge his rule. He vowed to crush Equestria and enslave or kill all of its inhabitants, the Princesses Celestia and Luna included. The ability of the Royal Sisters in protecting their realm was limited. They needed a strong hoof to reign in Discord's forces while they went about the process of nation building. While most of the villages had their own militias, and the cities had vast conscript defense forces, these were woefully inadequate to protect a nation.

&gt; Thus the Equestrian Regular Army was formed, cobbled together from various militias and conscription tithes. At the time, this rag-tag band of blacksmiths, stonemasons, farmers, and students could do little more than delaying actions or diversions. They were a guerrilla army with little training and no standardized armor. Often times, it took one of the Royal Sisters' personal intervention to prevent the ERA from being utterly destroyed even in small engagements. Casualties were appalling, and victory never really entered the strategic considerations of ERA commanders.

&gt; But they were determined to save their homes or perish trying, and more importantly, they were the only thing keeping Discord from winning by default.

&gt; The ERA steadily gained battle experience throughout the closing years of the pre-Classical era and grew in numbers. For every five ponies that entered battle, three emerged as hardened veterans. Over time, training improved as these veterans climbed the ranks, especially for unicorn battlemages. Steel armor was introduced to the ordinary solider after rich deposits of iron ore and coal were discovered outside what is now Ponyville. New technologies, such as the repeating crossbow or the lightweight catapult, allowed pegasi and earth ponies to participate more directly in battle.

&gt; By 1560 BNR, the army had turned from a small militia into a feared fighting force, capable of bringing down Discord's strongest champions. The struggle for survival had become a war. The historians of that era described it as ""Pax Equestria Per Bellum"", or ""Equestrian Peace Through War"". By the ERA's blood and steel was Equestria kept from falling into the chaos that surrounded it.

&gt; Discord saw Equestria growing stronger everyday, steadily becoming impossible to conquer with his usual tactics of simply burning, pillaging, and corrupting. He drew up a new plan. The ERA was far too good at fighting defensive wars, where one soldier could hold off ten or more of Discord's minions. He would have to draw them out into his realm and then destroy them in a large set-piece battle. This would hopefully so weaken the ERA that it would never be able to recover in time and he could simply steamroll his way into Canterlot without much resistance.

&gt; He was in for a rude surprise.

&gt; The first decisive battle in the Harmony Wars took place in spring of 1554 BNR as an ERA counter-offensive against Discord's repeated assaults on Hoofington in the winter of the previous year. As Discord had hoped, the ERA marched out of their fortified cities and into his lands. It was at that time that he sent in his forces in hopes of achieving an encirclement from which he could dictate the terms of how the ERA was going to be destroyed. The disorganized hordes of chaos crashed against the ERA's battle formations while powerful swarms of pegasi and dragons poured stones and fire into the lines. Distracted by the aerial bombardment, the battlemages and seigework troops were unable to prevent Discord's ground forces from surrounding them in a classic pincer movement. The battle appeared to be lost, as now the ERA had to fight on all sides. Three days passed, and casualties piled up on both sides, but the ERA refused to break. Magically propelled gem shards, a fairly new innovation, proved especially useful in bringing down dragons. Meanwhile, the ERA's air forces, armed with brand new 10-shot repeating crossbows, pursued their chaotic counterparts in vicious dogfights. When the skies had been cleared, the encirclement was swiftly broken as multiple rocket propelled arrow launchers fired into Discord's ranks at point blank range, clearing paths for earth pony cavalry to exploit, breaking up the large hordes into smaller, more manageable groups.

&gt; Discord's forces attempted to retreat, but it soon turned into a rout as the ERA's shock troops pursued them all the way to the Everfree Forest.

&gt; This marked an unprecedented escalation of hostilities. Discord's reserves were virtually unlimited, and he would raise more armies to throw against Equestria, and the ERA would invent more methods to increase their martial prowess to repulse new offensives. The ERA steadily expanded Equestria's borders with one victory after another, only stopping during the winter months to fortify their holdings and replenish their numbers. Things finally came to a head in the autumn of 1501 BNR when Discord, now in control of less than half of his former territory, used his powerful reality altering magics to open a portal right outside Canterlot for his armies in a last bid to destroy Equestria. Four out of the ERA's five regiments were leagues away, performing border sweeps against his diversionary forces. Canterlot was under siege, with just 5,000 soldiers defending her walls against Discord's untold millions.

&gt; Pressed for time, the Royal Sisters and the ERA generalship prepared a hasty defense. The castle had just been completed not three days before, and it was decided that the civilian populace would be safest in the palace keep. Even the throne room was opened for refugees. There was no shortage of food or drinking water, as the keep had vast stores and hidden aqueducts. The walls had been enchanted with magic meant to outlast the stones it was made from, and there was little chance even Discord's champions were going to smash down the main gate, not with thousands of pounds of shoring behind them.",2015-09-18 17:15:55+00:00,cv61vkg,1.0,t3_3lge2e,131.0,mylittlepony

7582,"Whoops, I made a mistake in my explanation. 

This *is* a fangame. The engine was not developed by SEGA/Sonic Team. The developers and fans ported levels from other games based on existing and newly created assets.

As for changing gameplay, there are currently only two (or three if you count the Chao Garden) gameplay styles present: Speed and Treasure Hunting. So yeah, both are from previous games. You'll find more difference in terms of the characters having different mechanics and the different missions available in each stage (similar to how SA2 does it).",2015-09-09 01:21:41+00:00,cuv3r5v,4.0,t1_cuv3lsb,246.0,Games

[](/sp)

&gt; From left to right

&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt; Name: Papillon
Parents: Fluttershy and Bulk Biceps
Personality: Quiet, Compromisable, Generous, Quirky
Info: Papillon is the only child of Fluttershy and Bulk Biceps. He enjoys helping other ponies, but easily can be taken advantage of for is agreeableness and fear of disappointing others. Because he can be scared of failure or disappointment, he is hesitant to try new things or compete. This gets him mistaken for timid, but it's not quite the case. Papillon won't let other ponies mean talk his friends and despises gossip. He finds it rude to talk behind somepony's back and would rather just tell someone the truth straight up. 

&gt; Name: Golden Spice Apple
Parents: Rarity and Braeburn
Personality: Optimistic, ""Brilliant"", Creative, Bold
Info: Called many different things due to her rather long name, Golden Spice Apple is the daughter of Rarity and Braeburn. She is an optimistic and positive mare who loves to produce her creative content for all to see. While showing her friends and parents her work is fine, if she were ever to show her work to big time producer or something, she would be very nervous and have minor breakdowns of EVERYTHING that could go wrong. However she is very unique in what she finds beautiful and believes trying many different styles and themes betters herself, thus she is very bold and experienced in her diverse styles.
(When I design a good cutie mark then I'll explain what she creates)

&gt; Name: Bubblegum
Parents: Pinkie Pie and Pokey Pierce
Personality: Snarky, Funny, Clever, Brash, Open-minded
Info: Bubblegum is the only child of Pinkie Pie and Pokey Pierce. She is known for having some of the best ""street smarts"" in Ponyville and is quite proud of it. Ponies often come to her with their problems and ask for advice, thus she's become sort of a venter or counselor to many ponies. She is brutally honest and never attempts to lie unless it is direly necessary (it's hard for her not to spill secrets). She has developed a ton of gossip causing her and Papillon to clash at times, but they still get along at times. She loves to prank and always has a good comeback up her sleeve if she's arguing with someone. Some say she'd be a good lawyer.

&gt; Name: Solar Flare
Parents: Twilight Sparkle and Flash Sentry
Personality: Serious, Determined, Quick to anger, Hard working
Info: Solar Flare is the son of Twilight Sparkle and Flash Sentry. He is extremely smart and could practically get into any future school he wants, but aspires to be a part of the royal guard just like his dad. When he was a colt, his mom was often away dealing with conflicts in other regions, thus he grew up more around his dad and was heavily influenced by his heroic deeds. He is rather disconnected from his mom and often gets annoyed when she comes to visit him in Ponyville. He doesn't like the stuck up life style of Canterlot and trains constantly in Ponyville to make sure he's good enough before applying to the royal guard. He's afraid he'll be accepted in only because he's the prince and hates when ponies recognize him as just ""Twilight's son""

&gt; Name: Azura
Parents: Rainbow Dash and Soarin
Personality: Hard working, refuses to give up, aspiring, brave, strong willed
Info: Azura is Rainbow Dash and Soarin's daughter and the older twin of Cyclone Blitz. She once dreamed of being a Wonderbolt, but after seeing the Equestria Games when she was younger, she now dreams of being a competing athlete in them. She gets along well with Solar Flare and respects him for his hard working attitude. However, Azura refuses to be nothing but the best and works hard to make sure she is on top. She can find time to have fun and chill. She hates being underestimated for her small size but always loves when some stallion's jaw drops after she beats them. She hates that her brother never practices yet can always beat her when they race. 

&gt; Name: Cyclone Blitz
Parents: Rainbow Dash and Soarin
Personality: Lazy, Funny, Calm, Hot headed
Info: Cyclone Blitz is Rainbow Dash and Soarin's son and the younger twin of Azura. He's a very popular colt around Ponyville with the ladies and is proud of it. He loves to have fun and prank other ponies with Bubblegum when he gets the chance. While he has a natural flying talent, he thinks being a Wonderbolt is kane and enjoys lounging around on his favorite cloud (calls it Floofy). His sister often gets annoyed with him and tries to make him practice with her all the time and believes he is wasting his talent. Cyclone is faster then his sister which he likes to flaunt sometimes much to her annoyance. He is master of destroying things and has broken many buildings, items and even a pony's leg once. 

&gt; Name: Honey Crisp
Parents: Applejack and Caramel
Personality: Kind, Sweet, Calm, Smart, Strategic, Athletic, Fun-loving
Info: Honey Crisp is Applejack and Caramel's daughter. She lives on the farm and does her chores just like any Apple family member. She likes to hang out with her cousins, especially her older cousin Jonagold. She is extremely smart and very good at reasoning with ponies. She often reads over the agreements between certain manufacturers and has become a sort of ""Treasurer"" for the family. She's very good at handling money and getting a better deal out of businesses. Her friends often ask her to bargain for them at the market or bring her as an accomplice when attending to business matters. She once dated Cyclone for awhile but are still good friends after that breakup.",2015-09-06 05:52:50+00:00,cus94fh,1.0,t3_3jtw6j,42.0,mylittlepony

[](/flutterblush) I may have been a bit over-dramatic there, but I'll talk a bit more about it in the meta thread.

[](/sp)

&gt; more to say

[](/twiponder) Alright continuing. RPs, unlike submissions, can be more safely ignored by regular users as they take place in comments. Just click the minus sign and they are invisible to you (as long as you are logged in). Downvote them if you must.

I understand the issue with the overabundance of shipping posts, but I feel we shouldn't go as far as to delete posts. There is no rule against this after all. In fact, I feel that if you as a user disagree with the amount of posts of these kinds, downvote and move on. Campaign and attempt to change the rules if you have to.

As a mod though, I understand the issue with submissions and RP going over the rule 2 ""line"". That's going to be more complicated to resolve. I would say it's more due to the users pushing the boundaries rather than the RPs themselves, but don't quote me on that one.

P.S. Summoning /u/GamesAndWhales so he doesn't miss this.",2015-08-26 03:30:59+00:00,cufw0d1,8.0,t1_cufvncc,691.0,mylittlepony

7846,"It's mostly the same as before, but I cannot recommend (most) of these enough. If you don't have enough time to read them all, I strongly suggest choosing **Affliction of the Heart** and **All-American Girl**.

[An Affliction of the Heart](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/60491/an-affliction-of-the-heart) - The classic pony X changeling story from Anonymous Pegasus. Still going strong in its fifth volume. What I like is the exploration of changelings and how the world and characters are delved into. And of course, the humor as well.

[A Different Love For a Change...ling](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/36149/a-different-love-for-a-changeling) - Here's a pairing you don't see everyday: Spike X Changeling. I like it for the characters and trying out something different. I wish there were more fics and fanart about this premise. This has a sequel as well.

[Integration](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/57956/integration) - Caramel founds out his love Sassaflash is in fact a changeling. So deviating from the norm, he chooses to become a changeling and part of Chrysalis's hive. What follows is Caramel's journey to become integrated with the hive, in more ways than one.


[All-American Girl](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/25148/all-american-girl) - A story of a mare (Rarity's foal) being raised on Earth. It quickly gets much more complicated with the resurrection of Nightmare Moon. Cannot recommend this story enough. In fact, give some of the side-stories and prequels a try - this spawned it's own mini-universe of sorts.

[Found You!](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/192511/found-you) - Again something you don't see everyday as well, Maneiac X Human shipping. A short but cute fic involving the Maneiac's origins. It has a sequel up as well.

[Room for Rent](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/166181/room-for-rent) - A very hilarious ponies on Earth fic. It's basically a sitcom where Pinkie moves into a guy's house as a roommate, taking place in a world where humans and ponies have established a portal for travelling between their universes. Though, the ponies here are *not* how we physically remember them from the show, which adds to the hilarity (shedding fur and needing to wear pants for instance).

[Shades of Night](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/187368/shades-of-night) - An interesting redemption/romance fic featuring Nightmare Moon. Taking place in a world where Equestria and Earth have already met, it's quite interesting reading about her redemption and the blossoming romance. Especially with all the shenanigans the cast gets into. In fact, I suggest you take a look at Sketchy Changeling's other works for other great stories.


[The Golden Armor](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/76159/the-golden-armor) - One of the first romance fictions featuring a batpony which became super popular. The writing can be kind of drab at times, but I do like the romance and character-building.",2015-08-20 14:02:57+00:00,cu9gqpy,1.0,t3_3hpxap,85.0,mylittlepony

* Bard (after all, why not have immortals who inspire others through songs)
* Cleromancer
* Druid (shapeshifting and pet allies) 
* Engineer (turrets and mech defenses), 
* Drainer (alternative Healer which buffs the effects of healing orbs and can rip health out of enemies to convert them into extra healing orbs)

[A Different Love For a Change...ling](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/36149/a-different-love-for-a-changeling) - Here's a pairing you don't see everyday: Spike X Changeling. I like it for the characters and trying out something different. I wish there were more fics and fanart about this premise. This has a sequel as well.

[Integration](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/57956/integration) - Caramel founds out his love Sassaflash is in fact a changeling. So deviating from the norm, he chooses to become a changeling and part of Chrysalis's hive. What follows is Caramel's journey to become integrated with the hive, in more ways than one.


[All-American Girl](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/25148/all-american-girl) - A story of a mare (Rarity's foal) being raised on Earth. It quickly gets much more complicated with the resurrection of Nightmare Moon. Cannot recommend this story enough. In fact, give some of the side-stories and prequels a try - this spawned it's own mini-universe of sorts.

[Found You!](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/192511/found-you) - Again something you don't see everyday as well, Maneiac X Human shipping. A short but cute fic involving the Maneiac's origins. It has a sequel up as well.

[Room for Rent](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/166181/room-for-rent) - A positively hilarious ponies on Earth fic. It's basically a sitcom where Pinkie moves into a guy's house as a roommate, taking place in a world where humans and ponies have established a portal for travelling between their universes. Though, the ponies here are *not* how we physically remember them from the show, which adds to the hilarity (shedding fur and needing to wear pants for instance).

[Shades of Night](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/187368/shades-of-night) - An interesting redemption/romance fic featuring Nightmare Moon. Taking place in a world where Equestria and Earth have already met, it's quite interesting reading about her redemption and the blossoming romance. Especially with all the shenanigans the cast gets into. In fact, I suggest you take a look at Sketchy Changeling's other works for other great stories.

**My recommendations:**

[An Affliction of the Heart](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/60491/an-affliction-of-the-heart) - The classic pony X changeling story from Anonymous Pegasus. Still going strong in its fifth volume. What I like is the exploration of changelings and how the world and characters are delved into. And of course, the humor as well.

[A Different Love For a Change...ling](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/36149/a-different-love-for-a-changeling) - Here's a pairing you don't see everyday: Spike X Changeling. I like it for the characters and trying out something different. I wish there were more fics and fanart about this premise. This has a sequel as well.

[Found You!](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/192511/found-you) - Again something you don't see everyday as well, Maneiac X Human shipping. A short but cute fic involving the Maneiac's origins. It has a sequel up as well.

[Integration](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/57956/integration) - Caramel founds out his love Sassaflash is in fact a challenge. So deviating from the norm, he chooses to become a changeling and part of Chrysalis's hive. What follows is Caramel's journey to become integrated with the hive, in more ways than one.

[Room for Rent](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/166181/room-for-rent) - A positively hilarious ponies on Earth fic. It's basically a sitcom where Pinkie moves into a guy's house as a roommate, taking place in a world where humans and ponies have established a portal for travelling between their universes. Though, the ponies here are *not* how we physically remember them from the show, which adds to the hilarity (shedding fur and needing to wear pants for instance).

[Shades of Night](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/187368/shades-of-night) - An interesting redemption/romance fic featuring Nightmare Moon. Taking place in a world where Equestria and Earth have already met, it's quite interesting reading about her redemption and the blossoming romance. Especially with all the shenanigans the cast gets into. In fact, I suggest you take a look at Sketchy Changeling's other works for other great stories.

[The Golden Armor](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/76159/the-golden-armor) - One of the first romance fictions featuring a batpony which became super popular. The writing can be kind of drab at times, but I do like the romance.

This was more pertaining to the S4 hiatus time community. This problem has mostly rectified itself (just before, during, and following the S5 premier) for the majority of the non-saucy and even saucy stuff. 

And yes, I was referring to non-saucy stuff as well. For instance, think of works like Flash Sentry or Horse Wife or works that had a similar concept. From what I have heard from acquaintances and seen, these posts had a harder time here, most likely due to the aftermath of the P_C incident (and a few other situations). As I said though, this has mostly been resolved.

So, let me cover the smaller issue. 

About three days ago, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/3bjfby/learning_to_swim_by_kilala97/) was posted. Now, these are humanized versions of Kilala97's next generation OC characters. However, without previous knowledge of her work, context, or the picture's description, one cannot tell it's directly related to MLP (it would still work in /r/mylittlehuman though). So, I was wondering if we should do something about this, or leave it as-is for the users to decide (via voting).

8701,"Alright, here are my recommendations. I'll make a second post with some new ones later.

[An Affliction of the Heart](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/60491/an-affliction-of-the-heart) - The classic pony X changeling story from Anonymous Pegasus. Still going strong in its fifth volume. What I like is the exploration of changelings and how the world and characters are delved into. And of course, the humor as well.

[A Different Love For a Change...ling](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/36149/a-different-love-for-a-changeling) - Here's a pairing you don't see everyday: Spike X Changeling. I like it for the characters and trying out something different. I wish there were more fics and fanart about this premise. This has a sequel as well.

[Found You!](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/192511/found-you) - Again something you don't see everyday as well, Maneiac X Human shipping. A short but cute fic involving the Maneiac's origins. It has a sequel up as well.

[Integration](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/57956/integration) - Caramel founds out his love Sassaflash is in fact a challenge. So deviating from the norm, he chooses to become a changeling and part of Chrysalis's hive. What follows is Caramel's journey to become integrated with the hive, in more ways than one.

[Room for Rent](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/166181/room-for-rent) - A positively hilarious ponies on Earth fic. It's basically a sitcom where Pinkie moves into a guy's house as a roommate, taking place in a world where humans and ponies have established a portal for travelling between their universes. Though, the ponies here are *not* how we physically remember them from the show, which adds to the hilarity (shedding fur and needing to wear pants for instance).

[Shades of Night](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/187368/shades-of-night) - An interesting redemption/romance fic featuring Nightmare Moon. Taking place in a world where Equestria and Earth have already met, it's quite interesting reading about her redemption and the blossoming romance. Especially with all the shenanigans the cast gets into. In fact, I suggest you take a look at Sketchy Changeling's other works for other great stories.

[The Golden Armor](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/76159/the-golden-armor) - One of the first romance fictions featuring a batpony which became super popular. The writing can be kind of drab at times, but I do like the romance.",2015-06-25 07:00:33+00:00,csi0cym,1.0,t3_3b1q9l,7.0,mylittlepony
