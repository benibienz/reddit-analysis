12,"No as anyone searching for a question on google will have to sift through weekly questions to find their search result.
 I've asked for support and I always post to the thread as well as making another post for it, in my experience I usually get the best help and most in depth guides from actual posts, rather than comments on the megathread (this being true for most subbredits I frequent).
Another point is that when you post a question on a thread, it seems people answering them are trying to answer other peoples questions at the same time, and haven't specifically came to answer your's. When someone replies to your post, they must've seen it and known that they could be of service to that specific problem, not just a blind draw. 
In conclusion I think it would be best that noob questions (how to toggle SAS) should be reserved for the thread as they only require on or two sentance answers to fully solve it, but for larger questions that require a long response (like this one!), they should get their own post. Finally I think the flagging system should be to be very lenient with mistakes in this realm, if we turn down an answer that someone needed because of the orginization of a subreddit, the only thing we would accomplish is to alienate players from the little gem called KSP!",2016-10-04 00:27:21+00:00,d8cvss1,1.0,t3_55p1p1,22348.0,KerbalSpaceProgram

15,"Hello fellow redditors, today I have a very important question about installing the mod KSPRC on ksp 1.1.3, before I start please note that: I don't want to update to 1.2 if it breaks the mod, I have already tried completely uninstalling KSP (removed the ksp folder in steamapps then uninstalled it from the steam launcher) and reinstalling it to try and fix the problem; finally, I dont care which mod pack I install as long as the end result looks something like this.
Even though the thread I linked shows that this mod was made for 1.1.2, in the mod thread it says that it is compatible with 1.1.3 as long as you have the latest version of kopernicus. The only mods I have installed are the ones required for ksprc as well as a few other mods that further improve FX, a screenshot of my gamedata folder is here. All of the mods I installed are recommended by this thread. I have a core i7 6700 and two GTX 960's in SLI format. I also have 32 gigs of corsair dominator platinum ram. Please help, I love KSP and I just want to use my PC to its full extent to play the games I love!
EDIT: I forgot to add that after I reinstalled the game the loader freezes when It reaches Kerbal Space Program\GameData\Squad\Spaces\mk1PodCockpit
EDIT 2: It turns out engine lighting isn't compatible with 1.1.3 so I removed it and now the game works fine (this is weird because the mod worked fine before I reinstalled KSP)
EDIT 3: KSPRC Still doesn't work :( btw all my other mods worked fine except for KSPRC
EDIT 4: The same problem just appeared again, this is getting really confusing really fast
EDIT 5: When I launch the game from CKAN it runs fine, but when I launch it from my desktop shortcut (which launches the 64bit) It exhibits the problem, before you ask what kind of processor my i7 is, I know that it's 64 bit and I've played 64 bit ksp on it before",2016-09-21 00:07:03+00:00,d7vclhz,1.0,t3_532mfd,374515.0,KerbalSpaceProgram
