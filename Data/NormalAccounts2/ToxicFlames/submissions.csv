I already tried to delete the modulemanager cache, to no avail.

Other problems I have are:
When I try to launch KSP using the desktop shortcut, it crashes immediately, consequently I have to launch it from CKAN.

When I was updating my mods through CKAN, I got an error about missing ""MouduleKonstruction"" file in the Index even though it was required, I traced it to my USI mods, and Manually updated those, then the others Installed fine.

Any suggestions would be helpful!",KerbalSpaceProgram,KSP Stuck on Load,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/57pw1p/ksp_stuck_on_load/

Even though the thread I linked shows that this mod was made for 1.1.2, in the mod thread it says that it is compatible with 1.1.3 as long as you have the latest version of kopernicus. The only mods I have installed are the ones required for ksprc as well as a few other mods that further improve FX, a screenshot of my gamedata folder is [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/xPCRo). All of the mods I installed are recommended by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/37nedh/installing_mods_to_make_ksp_look_nicer_step_by/) thread. I have a core i7 6700 and two GTX 960's in SLI format. I also have 32 gigs of corsair dominator platinum ram. Please help, I love KSP and I just want to use my PC to its full extent to play the games I love!

EDIT: I forgot to add that after I reinstalled the game the loader freezes when It reaches Kerbal Space Program\GameData\Squad\Spaces\mk1PodCockpit

EDIT 2: It turns out engine lighting isn't compatible with 1.1.3 so I removed it and now the game works fine (this is weird because the mod worked fine before I reinstalled KSP)

EDIT 3: KSPRC Still doesn't work :( btw all my other mods worked fine except for KSPRC

EDIT 4: The same problem just appeared again, this is getting really confusing really fast

EDIT 5: When I launch the game from CKAN it runs fine, but when I launch it from my desktop shortcut (which launches the 64bit) It exhibits the problem, before you ask what kind of processor my i7 is, I know that it's 64 bit and I've played 64 bit ksp on it before",KerbalSpaceProgram,KSPRC Mod Install Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/53q7af/ksprc_mod_install_help/
