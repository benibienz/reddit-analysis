I get it refusing a search is not smiled upon but I knew my rights and knew I had done nothing illegal.

My best tip however is this; if the price seems to good to be true, it is. As far as the brakes go, that rotor has a lot of grooves in it which is causing the scraping because of uneven pressure being exerted on it from the pad. Replacing the rotors is something you would want to do soon.
