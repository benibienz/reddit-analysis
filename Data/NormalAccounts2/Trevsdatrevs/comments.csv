5,"Well there are a few ways we can help combat terrorism and fanaticism. The major way for people in first world countries would be to send their kids to school. Education is what keeps things like the Boston marathon bombings from happening. It keeps people smart about what they are doing, or the majority of educated people anyways. The second way would be to show that we are not afraid of these insolent people. The fanatics feed on fear and false power, and its inexplicable. We don't understand why they do what they do, however, we can still fight them without violence. We can stand tall together, and spread awareness of terrorism through education systems throughout the world. This is how you really fight terrorism, not with air raids and drone bombings.
