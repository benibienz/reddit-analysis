263,"Wow, this is just extremely ignorant. You are positive that you are watching Fallout 4? The environment looks pretty great, tons of new aesthetics, the models look not at all similar, the animations look better, and of course the mechanics are similar. It's a god damn sequel not a new IP. They aren't going out and attempting to reinvent the god damn wheel. There is guns, you shoot them, you kill things, you loot things, those are the similar mechanics right there. What did you want them to do? The whole system of complete modification of weapons and power armor. There aren't many avenues you can go down to ""revolutionize"". Sure, the models don't look absolutely amazing, but that has never been the point of Fallout. But by no means are they worse than the models in Fallout 3. From what I have seen, the gameplay is entirely different from the past Fallouts. The gunplay isnt stiff anymore. One of the only points on which I agree with you is Dogmeat. His fur isn't dynamic and his animations look kind of stiff, but of course, he is a dog. Dogs aren't the main focus of this game. I'm not just brushing this under the rug, yes this part is not good, Bethesda really screwed the pooch on this one (pun intended) but like I said, dogs were not the main focus of this game. Just take this shitty comparison that I just made, mind you this is with YouTubes shitty video compression. It will only look better at full 1080p uncompressed. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/637wWKI.jpg) is the comparison. While your opinion is your own, I firmly disagree. Furthermore, how can you look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/SooS3jK.jpg) and tell me that these are reused environments? Again, bear in mind that this is with YouTubes horrid compression.
