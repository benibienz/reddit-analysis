I am getting a new processor soon so I am doing all kinds of research, and I just used prime95 and core temp to test the temperature under near 100% load, and I stopped it when the temperature reached about 68 degrees celcius but it seems like it could have continued going up. I am not planning to OC my new processor but I want to stick with my [current cpu fan](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNexus-70mm-Real-Silent-Case%2Fdp%2FB003PNLRLU&amp;ei=PEWUVd7kNYGQsAWwvpToBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKnWqnCFHDRR44ZgT3v92xOXIwSg&amp;sig2=wZlnnpjORGYFgNJLZEtrUQ&amp;bvm=bv.96952980,d.b2w) as it is almost completely silent and I have heard the stories of how loud the stock cpu fan is. So basically, I am wondering if that would be at all possible to take off the stock amd cpu fan and put on my current one and not worry about temps. I am fairly sure that 68 degrees while under full load is a bit high. I feel like i worded this poorly so if you have any questions feel free to ask. My games no longer crash with the cpu fan I am currently using, so I guess that it is doing a good enough cooling job but I don't know if the 8320 will be the same story.",buildapc,[Troubleshooting] High cpu temps?,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3bsgl6/troubleshooting_high_cpu_temps/
