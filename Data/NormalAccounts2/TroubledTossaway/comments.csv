His behavior is not acceptable, I understand this but I also understand that if there is a medical condition then we can treat it, and end the behavior. 

If he doesn't want to dedicate himself to getting better then I will walk, don't worry about that.",2015-10-04 01:04:20+00:00,cvnbjjz,6,t1_cvnbavs,487,relationships

2,"Thanks.

I'm not going to bail until he sees a doctor. Then we will know if he is indeed an asshole or has a legit treatable disorder.

But, I'm very aware of the abuse that has occurred and the seriousness of the transgression. ",2015-10-04 00:43:39+00:00,cvnawu9,2,t1_cvnatxi,157,relationships
3,"While I appreciate the condescending tone if it is indeed a medical disorder and he makes steps to fix, stop and manage his behavior for the sake of the relationship then good for him.

However, if he turns out to just be a massive hidden asshole this entire time then I will leave.

I don't think it is fair to bail after one serious outburst when the rest of our relationship is good. We manage money well, we make a good team business wise. 

Relationships take work and sometimes they suck. 

I'll walk if he doesn't make an effort.

If he is diagnosed and has an issue we can seek treatment / CBT and overcome the issue.

I know I will leave if he doesn't try to get treated. This is a problem he has, but my job as a supportive partner is to help him find the right path.

He has had 3 notable outbursts in 3 years and always comes back after feeling remorseful.

The 1st two times were mild, the recent one was very concerning.

12,"I agree with your statement.

I think it is unfair to insta bail if indeed it is a medical condition.

If he is willing to get treated and try to move forward and away from this behavior then we can overcome the issue.

I have no delusions about stopping and not rewarding this behavior.

As much as I wish I could cut someone off on the basis of one sentence, I cannot. I love everything else about him. The outburst scared me, but I know he would never hit me.

I agree that the temper is unacceptable and I also agree he needs to be the one to direct his therapy. But, I genuinely think his parents ignored symptoms and conflict and led to what is happening now.
