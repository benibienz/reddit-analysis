Background: Kevin (not his real name) and I have been together for about 3 years. We met at a monthly fetish event and soon became friends and after a few months of me flirting with him I asked him on a date. We had become rather friendly and hit it off right away. We became very close, reading, writing, debating, and all that fun stuff. During our three years of dating we had discussed moving into a condo, maybe taking up the city life for a few years, focus on our business and careers. Unfortunately, both our companies cut back, he lost his job and my hours were cut. Plans have been delayed.

When this happened I started noticing the tantrums, they were over small things like a sound behind the wall or the humm of the fridge. 


He would get quite agitated and I was a bit concerned but they would pass and the next day everything was fine. 


Next, we were on a trip to visit my parents (A long drive) and the seatbelt was bothering him. He began the pull and rip at the seat belt and screaming ""Fuck, fuck, fuck!"" Over and over again. 

He ended up going on his phone but getting so frustrated he broke it by bending it and smashed my headphones too.  

I hadn't seen this before in my years of dating him at this point and was once again somewhat concerned. But, chalked it up to a long drive / overtiredness.


Finally, a few days ago I purchased a Nexus TV Box, set it up and turned it on. I went to bed and awoke to Kevin screaming ""You peice of shit, come on!"" ""Why won't this thing turn off!"" 


I came downstairs and asked what the matter was and he explained he NEEDED to turn off the box. I googled if it could be shutoff (turns out it can't) so I suggested we unplug it if it is bothering him. 


He told me ""Go away, leave me alone and shut the fuck up."" and that he would figure it out and he wasn't leaving until he could figure out how to turn this thing off. It got to the point where he was yelling at the top of his lungs, smashing the remote on the floor, punching the floor in tears, and smashing the new box as well.


I had never seen this intensity of a tantrum before and had to leave to stay at a friend's place. No amount of me offering help / suggesting we do something else could get him off the task / tantrum.


I ran into Kevin's sister yesterday and she told me this has been going on since he was 12 or 13. 

I still have a deep connection to him and everything else in our lives if pretty okay outside these rare-ish tantrums. he has NEVER hit me or threatened me. But, I'm at a loss for words, I want this relationship to work but as accepting as I try to be I cannot overlook this erratic / scary behavior. 


**tl;dr**: Boyfriend has tantrums over extremely minor things, ends up smashing them / screaming at me to leave him the fuck alone / shut the fuck up. I want to help as a partner but feel powerless and scared. Discussion or even gentle prodding about this with him ends up with him totally shutting down and not talking to me for DAYS.

**We cannot afford counselling services.** Unless my school offers relationship counselling, but I don't think it does.

I'm still at my friend's place and **I have asked him to meet me at a cafe later today to discuss this in a public environment.** I hope this will stop him from shutting down completely, if I do it in private he will walk away and shut himself on the computer.

**UPDATE** I made plans for tomorrow. We are meeting up and will be discussing seeing a doctor about a potential medical issue. I will gauge his seriousness about it then. Some people got the impression im some helpless flower and abused. In 3 years, he has had these 3 notable outbursts. The seatbelt, the Nexus player and the fridge. We are sitting at a crossroads, he has to be genuinely dedicated to treatment and if it indeed turns out he was a hidden asshole all along then I will walk.
