0,I hear you should expect to find a yellow oil after the evap. You could then do an acid base extraction on that to yeild pure lysergamid residues.,2016-08-13 05:05:36+00:00,d6fkq6u,2.0,t1_d6f0bgb,32473.0,LSA

8,"for starters LSA is a polar molecule that is dissolved into the acetone, so most of the LSA will be inside the liquid and not the clumps, although there is a chance that some LSA gets stuck in the clumps, which doesn't help. If you reuse acetone you are wasting your time and please dont, just use fresh acetone for every pull",2016-06-06 09:00:01+00:00,d3xutsn,2.0,t1_d3xsoeb,7363.0,LSA

11,"if I understand your question correctly, you're asking why is it that Kash uses acetone first instead of naphtha? you might be wondering this because other teks require you to use naptha first whereas Kash uses it after acetone extraction. If so, its good that you noticed the differences. firstly, in Kash's tek the acetone pulls all the polar soluble molecules out of the seed mush and also even some o the icky poisonous molecules responsible or the nasty bodyload. Dry out your evap dish and combine with 100ml deionized H20 + citric acid. When you combine naphtha with the Aqueous LSA citrate the fatty poison molecules go from the water into the naptha and stay there   so that when you use a separating funnel the icky stuff stays in the naphtha, making it easy to separate good from bad molecules.",2016-06-03 13:16:49+00:00,d3ueqdz,6.0,t1_d3tgwz1,65107.0,LSA
12,"Have not attempted the tek yet,but will update the thread once I do. Honestly Consolidated Chemicals on Amazon is a good source, so check them out. Also I highly recommend you just google and learn about these chemicals that have the real potential of killing you slowly. Second, The Material and Safety Data Sheet or just MSDS is an encyclopedia of knowledge on how to properly take care of chemicals as each chemical has its own distinct properties. You might even learn that same chemicals have multiple different names. A Synonym for DCM (Dichloromethane) would be Methylene Chloride. Another fun one is calling water Dihydrogen Monoxide, as saying the molecule this way allows chemists to draw it out. ",2016-06-02 13:01:14+00:00,d3t0r8h,4.0,t1_d3soepk,33432.0,LSA

17,"Ha yes! And its so exciting! It will either be too hot and be destroyed partially /completely or the more exciting reality that lysergimides can take some heat! Who knows! Tune in next week to find out!
 Im not worried about the temperature too much as DCM's boiling point is too close to human thermal temperatures to consider degridation a possibility, but maybe just the act of placing heat on molecules would shake a few lose, so yeah i might destroy LSA, but i cant wait to find out!",2016-05-26 01:36:03+00:00,d3jvq3f,6.0,t1_d3jv1ii,1064.0,LSA
18,"Well.. You dont need a heating mantle. Methylene chloride's boiling point is pretty low, so its easy to evaporate. Although a great organic solven in the lab, im pretty sure its not good for the atmosphere at all so  I sorta gathered together a low heat rig to boil off DCM to be condenced and recycled for reuse :)",2016-05-26 01:10:45+00:00,d3juqrx,4.0,t1_d3jiika,18507.0,LSA

Got most of my glass for cheap on amazon, but my heating mantle was 150 and all my glass came out at around 260. Not a bad deal for how much i received, but half the glass i got was crushed just getting to me so im still waiting for a few items. I'm also in possession of 20,000 MG seeds so if i get it wrong the first time hopefully i'll have enough to at least get it right once.",2016-05-25 18:18:37+00:00,d3jdp6i,2.0,t1_d3j9myf,5271.0,LSA
