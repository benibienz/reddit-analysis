Terrence always remarked Carl Jung when speaking of truths being true enough, or rather the end date being close enough. when talking about the Mayan date congruencies I think he was misguided somehow, but id liken to believe his first zero date is more relative than the mayan date. Beliving that the end date in December by mayan influence always seemed more apocalyptic, but the legalization of cannabis seems to have hit closer to real first prediction and has more positive connotations about the future of ending the drug war.  Has anybody else looked into this? When I tripped last I asked my entities how I could be a better person and they said  ""this isnt about you."" if not me, then helping others is what I shall do.

I've blown about 500$ collecting materials to preform this Tek next weekend, so I figured it's worth posting about. To those unfamiliar with this particular Tek, it's infamous for being too drawn out , too complicated for laymen, but even more so  this Tek has only been reported by very few. The purpose of this post (and the experiment) is to confirm that A) The Tek actually works and B) Weed through some troubleshooting as most people who try this tek end up talking about their failures on forums and ask why their tek didn't work. With no concise result in sight hopefully I can save the day, or rather LSA I should say.

Upon reviewing the Tek, I find it unclear at some parts such as at #7 
	""7.		Now its time to freebase the LSA so it can be extracted from the water layer. Add a small amount of ammonia (around 1 ml) to solution until it changes to a light yellow color. PH should be roughly 9-10."" -Kash
What was the molarity of the ammonia he was using? Is he remarking that ammonia has a pH of 9-10 or that the whole solution should be that range of pH? Unclear, imprecision with wrong volumes of chemicals might be whats giving everybody a hard time pulling LSA.

If we could work through some of the word play I think we could refine the Tek!",LSA,My attempt at Kash's Advanced LSA Extraction (ALL AND ANY HELP WELCOMED),https://www.reddit.com/r/LSA/comments/4l02we/my_attempt_at_kashs_advanced_lsa_extraction_all/
