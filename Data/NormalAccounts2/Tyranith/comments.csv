The guild was formed way back in TBC, went through a period of inactivity in Cata, and is now becoming active again in Legion. Now the guild is stronger than ever with several veteran core players who have been playing since vanilla.

We are currently farming EN on normal and attempting Heroic (1/7 currently). We raid 1-2 times a week and try to find a timeslot that suits everyone; we usually raid Wednesday, Monday, and/or Saturdays.

We are fairly casual and do not plan on being a cutting edge guild, so min-max is not mandatory. All specs are welcome and we will do our best to accommodate you. However we do expect you to pull your weight in raids by learning your class and the encounter mechanics.

He was level 104, and our paladin healer who is surprisingly good despite being extremely new at the game (started during Legion) spammed the absolute shit out of his health bar, used lay on hands, and he still died in about 3 seconds.

Did he think to blame it on his lack of communication? No. Did he think to blame his overeagerness? No. Did he think maybe pulling five packs when he didn't outgear the dungeon was a bit too much?

144,"Well no one knows what the optimal spec is for endgame yet, and you can change your talents pretty much on the fly so just mess around with them and see what you prefer. The only garbage talent I see for leveling is Sabertooth.

If you want a more challenging playstyle go for Savage Roar, Jagged Wounds, and/or Bloodtalons (although I really don't recommend taking all three unless you are either a masochist or John fucking Madden). Your ultimate goal here is to keep savage roar up, and keep bloodtalons-buffed rake and rip up at all times, ideally with a tiger's fury snapshotted. It's fucking hard unless you have a LOT of haste and crit.

If you want things to be a bit more forgiving, SotF is much easier on you. I haven't really messed with Elune's Guidance but it might be fairly decent for leveling if you want to get a Savage Roar up quickly.

As for rotation, well it depends entirely on what your mates just pulled and how long it will last. If it's going to last longer than 20 seconds getting a rip up is worth it, but otherwise just hit rake, then shred until 5cp and fb. You can try rake-cleaving on packs of 3-4 enemies, any more than that I would just thrash and swipe. 

For leveling you can just stealth, rake, shred, shred, fb until dead, it's pretty boring. Except against minibosses where you get to use a rip. Yay. If you have Savage Roar enjoy trying to keep it up at all times while moving from mob to mob (you won't). For a more enjoyable playstyle you can smack a rip on a mob then move onto the next one while it bleeds out, that can be fairly fun and it should force you to use your predator's swiftness heal occasionally too.",2016-07-29 00:03:32+00:00,d5v7ais,3.0,t1_d5v5nd0,2444.0,wow
145,Not exactly sure what you're asking. Tanks are usually just fine for questing since they can do big pulls and run through enemy groups without much hassle (it's nice to have a friend that can do aoe damage for you though). DPS specs tend to get through mobs faster one by one but struggle if they pull too much. At lower levels tanks tend to outdamage DPS anyways.,2016-07-28 21:46:44+00:00,d5v1l4m,13.0,t1_d5uzfce,2928.0,wow
146,"Oh yeah sorry you're absolutely right, it's just been so long my memory is hazy. For some reason I had memories of the bear boss in zul'aman and associated it with wotlk rather than tbc where it was (then it came back in cata).

I do remember having fun with bosses in WotLK though, partly because when they first added savage roar it made the rotation not mind-numbing and a little challenging, and made ferals a high skill/high reward spec. That's why I remember having fun with it. Savage Roar wasn't so much the problem as the implementation. 

I think the biggest problem with cats since is that fights with adds, boss phases, and trash aoe fights are so short that you feel pretty much useless until certain boss fights. Something like an AoE finisher that did something like spread your rake to targets in range would go such a long way to helping that. They even played with the idea of rake-cleaving at one point (forget when) but shelved it before it even hit live I think.",2016-07-28 20:27:44+00:00,d5uxzs6,5.0,t1_d5uutjc,3924.0,wow
147,"Subtlety has a lot of upfront damage and a teleport from stealth that's very easy to use, which later can be specced to stun for 2seconds. In my opinion it's great for leveling because of its burst damage and the ability to jump from mob to mob while in stealth.

Outlaw still plays mostly like its old counterpart combat, but has some fun interactive mechanics like pistol shot and roll the bones is very random to keep you on your toes. If you like randomness and thinking on the fly, plus the added ranged component, this spec can be fun, otherwise avoid.

Assassination is mostly based around DoTs (damage over time abilities) and stuns to do lots of single target control and damage. Make sure you apply your poisons if you choose this spec otherwise you'll do almost no damage.

Monk is one of the classes I have absolutely no idea about, but I've heard WW is in a great place right now.",2016-07-28 20:26:39+00:00,d5uxxvn,11.0,t1_d5up1ra,10843.0,wow

151,"Yeah the rotation is fast but the damage is slow, because the whole spec is based around bleeds and huge ramp-up times. The only time you're ever at risk of out-dpsing anyone is on a long-duration single-target boss, which are almost non-existent now. And every phase change means you have to go through your ramp-up phase again only without the benefit of stealth this time. And if you accidentally rip at just the wrong time without trinket procs/SR, you just fucked yourself out of a massive ton of damage. Plus even if you get everything just right, you can hope to maybe equal someone's DPS. 

Feral was best during Wrath imo, where the rotation was somewhat challenging but not irritating, bearcatting was actually viable, fun, and not OP at all, and you could do good DPS if your skill was high. Then they added savage roar and have been undoing the damage that it caused since.",2016-07-28 16:00:19+00:00,d5ukss6,3.0,t1_d5uk2ue,878.0,wow
152,"I've been a feral druid main since vanilla and it's just about as shit as it's ever been. You get the choice between savage roar irritation (even more irritating since it doesn't last very long now) or dying of boredom through keeping your two bleeds up and occasionally snapshotting with TF. There's no middle ground. They never should have added savage roar in the first place and should've removed it a long time ago once they realised it was a mistake. Feral needs an overhaul but it won't get one. The artifact ability is a step in the right direction, though.

Guardian on the other hand feels in an amazing place. I don't think I can remember a time when I've had as much fun as a bear. From swipe being spammable again to the active mitigation feeling genuinely useful and frenzied regen being fun to use, bear is just fantastic right now.

Arms warrior also feels great and is probably the best spec that I've tried so far. So much so that I'm seriously considering switching mains for the first time since vanilla. Arms has a great balance of pace, enough buttons to hit and enough mechanics to keep you awake at the same time as feeling powerful and isn't too punishing when you don't hit the mechanics perfectly. The talent choices are overall extremely good allowing you to tailor your playstyle a lot.

Shit like that does actually build character and confidence. It may sound like bullying (at times it has felt like it) but being challenged is how you improve and grow stronger.

Try not to shy away from criticism; embrace it.

As for mental strategies, there are plenty depending on what outcome you want. If you actually want to improve, brutal honesty is the best approach; someone asks you why you did something? Tell them why you did it (it felt right, I thought x would happen, etc.). If you just want to deflect, you can say something like ""oh yeah that was dumb, oh well.""

197,"Alright I'll bite. I won't answer all these because this is off the top of my head

&gt;Name one person who met Jesus, spoke to him, saw him or heard him who wrote about the event, has a name and is documented outside of the bible (or any other gospels).

The point of the bible is that it's a collation of the writings of those who met Jesus and wrote about him. This 'challenge' is analagous to saying ""name one scientific theory that has been peer reviewed and tested, has a name, and is documented outside a scientific journal.'

&gt;How do you know all other gods except Yahweh are false?

First of all, knowing and believing are two different things. Aside from that, the implication of the bible is that *there are in fact other Gods, otherwise the first commandment wouldn't be needed.* It's just that there is a higher truth than, say, norse gods of battle, or sun deities, etc.

&gt;Is it fair that Jesus died on the cross so that Hitler could go to heaven and Anne Frank would go to hell?

I don't know where this argument comes from. However, only God knows whether that's fair or not. Even the wisest cannot see all ends.

&gt;Why didn't Jesus write anything at all?

The written word is pretty clumsy; inspiration through action is a much more powerful message.

&gt;Why do so few Christians emulate the example of Fred Rogers?

Not many Christians are Fred Rogers, also Fred Rogers did quite explicitly emulate the example of Christ.

&gt;How do you determine if what someone is telling you comes from genuine religious experience or if they are simply delusional? How do you prevent your personal biases from affecting your judgement of this?

That's the whole point of looking to external sources to validify and hone our morality.

&gt;What is an example of religion being wrong about something, anything, and religion (and not science) finding this out? What is the proof that religion is correct now?

I dunno if you noticed but churches are reforming all the time, and there are many different and often conflicting interpretations. If religion believed it had all the answers, it'd stop looking :)

&gt;If the Latter Day Saints are wrong, what is the proof? Why are Joseph Smith's visions and revelations false but the anonymous ones of the bible are not? And what about Scientology?

I don't think any religious person worth his salt would argue that other attempts to find truth are invalid. However in the case of scientology we can quite literally look at Hubbard's own motivations through his own writing, and it seems easy to determine that they didn't stem from a position of moral authority but out of a desire to accumulate wealth and power under the guise of religion in order to exploit the exemption of religions from taxation.

&gt;What happens when different people pray to different gods for something only one of them can get

I ascribe to the idea that prayer doesn't actually 'do' anything. It's a way of listening and communicating with God rather than telling him what you want, he's not the make-a-wish foundation.",2016-07-10 15:52:01+00:00,d56qmhx,1.0,t3_4rx8ym,150242.0,Christianity

It's useful to accept the convention of ""guys chase, girls choose"" without worrying too much about whether or not it's a purely social construct or an innate difference between females and males (truth is somewhere between the two).

Another issue that INTJs have is that we have trouble following our instincts; our default MO is to formulate a theory based on our intuition, but then to double check it by working through it logically and ironing out flaws before actually acting. With social interaction you kind of need to skip that second step which can be hugely discomfiting at first. We're notoriously bad at 'going with the flow' to such an extent that going *against* the flow is much more normal for us.

378,"Okay so there seem to be some misconceptions in here.

A **blockstring** is when you literally can't do shit during block, you can't even throw out an invincible reversal. You're locked in blockstun. In V however, you can V-Reversal out of blockstrings.

When there's a gap in a blockstring that's 1 frame or 2 frames against certain characters, this results in a **frame trap**, this is when if they hit a button (usually a jab or a cr.tech) they'll get counterhit because the gap was just big enough to let them hit a button but small enough that it didn't actually come out. Counterhit frame traps are an important part of V and it's vital that you learn one with your character. There is a way out of frame traps and that's to use an invincible reversal (DP for example), but you can't make these safe with FADC and result in an automatic counterhit punish, so are very risky to use.

Because of the strength of frame traps, mashing jab against anyone who knows what they're doing is actually a terrible idea in V, and also makes characters with oppressive pressure (like Bison and Nash) hard to fight against if you forget you have a V-Reversal. What you really want to do is know the opponent's character's pressure string gaps (and watch how he uses them) so you know when it's safe for you to hit buttons, and watch his habits for gaps you think you can reversal through.

tl;dr: If you need a (mostly) safe way of getting out of pressure, use V-Reversal, that's what it's there for. Mashing jabs is going to get you blown up by anyone who knows how to use a frame trap.

Of course you CAN use the tech in this video--it's useful information--just know that it won't work all the time.",2016-02-11 11:51:44+00:00,czvwqmz,1.0,t3_4568m2,37923.0,StreetFighter

424,"There's also the issue where single pistol counts as a different weapon for the purposes of ammo capacity. So, if you buy full ammo with the .500 magnum and then pick up or buy another magnum, your ammo count is reset.

A similar issue happens because of weight. If you you have less than 6 weight cap but more than 3 the weight cap, you might not be able to buy a second magnum because even though it weighs 3 more and replaces your single magnum, the game sees 'dual magnum' as weighing 6 which is too heavy.

Also the bug which makes you randomly change perk for no reason. It's fine though, I'm sure you're too busy to fix bugs, what with figuring out ways of monetising the game and all.

518,"Well the fundamental game mechanics are the same for all characters, but they use them in different ways. Sagat has a totally different gameplan to Zangief, for example.

It can also be daunting when you've got used to one character's normals to then switch to a character with totally different normals. I played a lot of Gouken when I first started and he has an extremely abusable sweep - it took me a long time to get out of the habit of sweeping too much (which is punishable on most characters).

To be honest my advice is just to find whatever character you think is coolest, put in some actual time and effort with them, and then maybe branch out a bit when you get bored. It also doesn't hurt to go back to Ryu occasionally. I main Oni and it's easy to start to rely too much on gimmicks but going back to Ryu forces you to use fundamentals.",2015-12-17 20:57:47+00:00,cy2n07s,5.0,t1_cxz4qab,255029.0,StreetFighter

543,"Alright so since there's a little confusion about the damage/stats on this weapon, I'll clarify:

- It costs 850, so you can't buy it in the pistol round, but you should be able to afford it and kev+helm pretty much every round if you don't buy primaries

- It does base 115 damage, with 97.5% armour penetration, which means

- At close range, any shot to the upper body will kill in one hit, regardless of kevlar

- At longer ranges, chest shots might not kill immediately due to damage dropoff. Kevlar will decrease this very slightly.

- A stomach shot at ANY range will be a one-shot kill, because stomach shots do 125% damage ~~and have no kevlar protection~~

- Leg shots are not lethal, as the leg hitbox is 75% damage, meaning it'll do -86 up close, and less as it gets further

- Because of its enormous armour pen and damage, it's extremely good for wallbanging.

593,"I think it's likely because most AMD users picked their brand in order to show support for things like open-source, or to be against some of the anti-competitive shit that nvidia pulls like gameworks. Nvidia users tend to just buy their brand because it's what they've always had, or they're under the impression that Nvidia cards perform better.

645,"No, cars experience constant *forces* opposite to their direction of travel. You sum the forces in each direction and that gives you a net force, which results in acceleration in the direction of that force (or no acceleration if the net force is zero).

For example, if you've got 5 force units due to air drag and friction, but 6 force units due to the engine's torque, you get 1 unit of net force in the positive direction (forwards with respect to the car). 

This acceleration will be inversely proportional to the mass, giving us a=f/m

So from our example, if the mass of the car is 1 mass unit, the acceleration will be 1/1 = 1 unit of acceleration.

The car will slow down (aka decelerate or experience negative acceleration), if that acceleration is ever less than zero (a&lt;0).",2015-11-08 08:35:39+00:00,cwspo8b,10.0,t1_cwsfd4p,23615.0,movies

705,"&gt;the fries have way more calories, so when it came to pure weight gain, the fries are definitely more of a culprit

Actually no, that's a common misonception but it's oversimplistic and misleading. More calories does not necessarily make you put on more weight. It depends a lot on where those calories come from and how quickly your body can digest those nutrients. Sugar really is the worst culprit for that; glucose spikes your insulin, fructose overloads your liver, but both mechanisms cause the body to store it as fat. It also depends on how quickly those foods are digested - a food could have a billion calories but if they're not metabolised in the body it doesn't make any difference. Similarly, foods high in fibre and with more complex sugars/starches take longer to digest, so they don't put as much strain on the body.

Yes you can get fat from just eating proteins/fats, but you have to eat a LOT more than if you get your calories from simple sugars.

What's interesting about that to me is that neither is exactly incorrect, but neither really shows the ultimate truth of the situation: that neither way matters because multiplication is a commutative operation.",2015-10-21 20:36:07+00:00,cw81obw,14.0,t1_cw81isf,206.0,pics

It's really hard to pull off 360-style motions on a playstation controller (though I managed it okay in Tekken 3 on the Playstation 1 pad somehow).

The best d-pad I ever encountered on a pad was actually on [this](http://cdn.toptenreviews.com/rev/scrn/large/58270-sabrent-twelve-button-usb-2.0-game-controller1.jpg) cheap controller I used for a while. The buttons are totally independent but close enough that it's still easy to hit diagonals, but it's still fairly easy to hit clean directions for, say, charge input style moves. Still pales in comparison to the control you get from a stick though.

805,"My first instinct is to follow the British example - institute a public information TV service with a mandate to providing unbiased and impartial news and political coverage, and educational programming. Accountable to the public and not to shareholders. It would broadcast on TV as well as have its own website.
There are a lot of details that would have to be worked out, but that's the general idea.

The question's slightly vague since you say ""if you could."" I mean, if one were enterprising enough pretty much anyone could make an 'unbiased' media business whose vision was to provide unbiased and educational information - however since it would be private it would necessarily need to be profitable, and therefore be at least somewhat entertaining. Heck, this is basically the premise for the series The Newsroom.

The other alternative is to setup a not-for-profit business that would operate somewhat like a charity. I'm not sure of the details exactly but I don't think it's without the realm of possibility that people would contribute to something that had value like that, if it was well done.

You could also feasibly start a youtube channel with unbiased information, which I think is where most people turn when they don't trust the information sources on TV. The problem of that is of course that it needs time, effort, and possibly capital, so you're in the same situation as running it as a business. Although I suppose youtube ads may cover at least part of the cost of that. There's also the potential problem of being censored since you're publishing information on a site which is privately owned. Your content could be removed at any time without warning, and youtube has notorious problems with DMCA requests, for example.

If you wanted to be a bit more radical you could also try to tackle it through legislation. For example one could mandate that any organisation claiming to be a source of news be held accountable to certain standards. This would require enforcement, so you'd have to make a government service responsible for monitoring and enforcing standards. The tricky part here is how to word such legislation in order to get a good result. You run into problems such as interference and market distortion, and ineffective legislation with potential loopholes.

Essentially your options boil down to funding it privately or publicly. Since the news network would ultimately be for the public benefit it just seems sensible to fund it publicly. Then you have the issue of how do you get people to pay for it? Advertisements? Crowdfunding? Taxes? Each have their own issues. Taxes seem the best option but it's notoriously difficult to get people to pay for things that they don't see an immediate and urgent need for, even if such things have a demonstrably net gain. How do you go about getting people and politicians to vote in such a measure?",2015-10-11 16:29:40+00:00,cvvwt3w,1.0,t3_3obx55,9101.0,TrueAskReddit

Is it in the same family?  Yes.  No one's arguing that.  

As someone who is a scientist who studies grass, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls crabgrass grass.  If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either.  They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""grass family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of graminoids, which includes things from sedges to bamboo to rushes.  

So your reasoning for calling a crabgrass a grass is because random people ""call the green ones crabgrass?""  Let's get hooked bristlegrass and lovegrass in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape?  It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works.  They're both.  A crabgrass is a crabgrass *and* a member of the grass family.  But that's not what you said.  You said a crabgrass *is* a grass, which is not true unless you're okay with calling *all* members of the grass family grass, which means you'd call papyrus, bamboo, and other grasses grass, too.  Which you said you don't.

I do really REALLY hate it when people pronounce 'daemon' as 'damon,' or 'aeon' as 'ayon' though. 'Ae' does have one main holdout in US English and that's in ""archaeology"" which is way more common than ""archeology.""

Aluminum/aluminium has an interesting history behind its etymology, and some people consider the American spelling to be more 'correct' because it's older, in which case we should use its original name alumium.

Could go into -re vs. -er too, where technically the American version makes more sense, unless you wanna go back to spelling Decembre and disastre.

If your argument is about flow and saying the phrase out loud, I contest that the construction ""Helping your uncle Jack off a horse, and helping your uncle jack-off a horse"" is actually better, because when I say it out loud I don't pause during the first clause - and it sounds totally natural, but if you want to convey the latter, what you do is make a connection between jack and off, which is better conveyed by a hyphen IMO.

Besides, the phrase is to illustrate a common mistake in writing practices, so your argument about saying it out loud is moot anyway.

When I was young I bought into the whole ""emotionless aspie"" myth, and compared myself to psychopaths because of the seeming similarity in the coldly logical approach to things.

1277,"Alright so hurtbox and hitbox. Hurtbox is the portion of the character that is susceptible to being hit. When you do an attack it creates a hitbox which is an area that, if it touches the opponent's hurtbox, causes the attack to connect.

[This](http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/271672/10391731/1295936775593/1uyYM.jpg?token=MdE4oipZJlYQ5uAyw2tsv0rE7JU%3D) image helps to understand it. Juri's hurtbox is shown in green, and the hitbox of her attack is shown in red. If a red hitbox from another character touches her green hurtbox, she will be hit by that attack. Notice also that there is some overlap.

(Active frames, from the frame data also comes into this description here - it's the number of frames that the hitbox from an attack is active for.)

[Here](http://www.eventhubs.com/guides/2009/sep/18/guide-understanding-hit-boxes-street-fighter/) is a good in-depth explanation of hitboxes and hurtboxes.

So usually when someone attacks, if they extend their body or advance forward while they attack, though their hitbox extends out, they are also slightly more vulnerable because they often extend their hurtbox too. However, weapons such as Kotal Kahn's sword, Jason's machete, Tanya's naginata - and D'vorah's pincers, don't have a hurtbox. So if two characters attack each other, one with a weapon and one without, the hitbox from the weapon will likely hit the extended arm hurtbox, but because the weapon doesn't have a hurtbox it won't take a hit in return. This allows them to trade very favourably with other attacks, giving them what is called ""priority."" A good contrast for example are some of Liu Kang's attacks, especially his uppercut. While it has a large hitbox, it also has a large hurtbox, causing it to hit from a good distance but actually trade unfavourably with many attacks - it has a good hitbox but not good priority.

Now onto footsies - that is where both opponents are on their feet and trying tho get into range to try to poke, trade, or punish missed attacks (whiff punishing), without opening themselves up to the opponent's attacks. D'vorah is good at footsies because she has fast, long range, high-priority pokes, and also has fast advancing normals which are great for whiff-punishing.",2015-07-02 23:06:39+00:00,csqezud,2.0,t1_csq4757,17206.0,MortalKombat

1291,"Transformers 2, no contest.

This review, from a similar thread, by redditor /u/mr_chip will always stand out in my mind:

---------

To answer common questions:

* Transformers 3 was the only thing I thought had any hope of being worse, but it was merely kinda shitty.
* I LOVE the Waxworks films, Ice Pirates, Troll 2, House 2, Manos, etc. I'm not bad-mouthing them. Any film that plays Bruce Campbell with his chest flayed open for comedy is a-ok by me.
* While I was familiar with the Transformers from my childhood, I didn't go in expecting a great film, and I'm not in ""They ruined my childhood memories"" nostalgia mode. While the animated film is entertaining, the original cartoons are indeed ridiculously shitty. I just didn't expect to get righteously brainfucked for my $12 when watching a movie about giant robots from space punching each other.

And now back to the original post:

I am a connoisseur of drek. I sat uncomplaining through all of Battlefield Earth, twice. I've seen Manos: Hands of Fate without Joel &amp; the 'Bots (although Torgo's theme is one of my ringtones) and I even sort of like the Daredevil Director's Cut. I will gladly tell you exactly why Waxworks II and House 2 are completely awesome if you give me the chance. I love me some Troll 2. On my shelf right now is a worn, much-watched DVD of Ice Pirates. I read an article this morning about the Evel Knievel movie, and I cannot wait to get my hands on it. I truly love bad movies, and have spent more weekend hours consuming cinematic pablum than is probably safe for me to really think about. 

 
The thing about bad movies is that they are still bound by the laws of physics, which is to say that even when the act of watching a bad film moves from ""endurance test"" into ""death march,"" you can still be confident that eventually you will find the film's internal logic. The horror on-screen will achieve terminal velocity, and then you can just hang on and pray that when it finally crashes into the inevitable climactic shitpuddle, you won't get too much on you. Even when the poorly spliced-together remains of unfinished Japanese horror films are meshed into a Frankenstein's monster of Kurosawa and Star Wars, you can find a level on which to relate to the movie in question. It's all just a matter of attitude and expectation.
I say these things so that you will understand me as a man who has consumed Steven Seagal's entire oeuvre at least twice when I say that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is absolutely, without any doubt, the single worst film I have ever seen in my entire life. It is the Michael Jordan of bad movies, so clearly far-and-away beyond all of its peers that it is unlikely anything will top it in my lifetime.

I did not go into Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen with expectations of such magnificence. I've seen all of Bay's films, and liked almost none. I expected the first Transformers film to suck on toast, but left it feeling mildly entertained and pleasantly surprised. When I heard that Bay himself was writing the sequel, however, I knew it would be terrible. But I had no idea how far Bay's genius for mediocrity extended.

The thing about Transformers 2 is that it doesn't bother with the laws of physics. On the way down to the shitpuddle, it goes screaming past terminal velocity like it's not even there, compounding the awful at every turn in a constant full-burn acceleration toward an impact that never comes. Transformers 2 passes right through the shitpuddle, the despoiled earth below it, all reality as though they weren't even there, flying past the boundaries of poor film-making with such exuberant power that one cannot actually observe mere mediocrity from within Transformers' vicinity, even with a radio telescope. Halfway through the viewing experience, Star Trek V tries to drag race, and gets left behind like it was a 3-door Geo Metro.

Attempts to predict the nadir of Transformers 2 while watching come often. The lingering shot of dogs humping is in the first 15 minutes, and so is Mom's Pot Brownie Trip, so you know those don't count. But you will probably think you have found the worst part of the film fairly early, when the Hot Slutty Girl model Decepticon attacking our protagonist explodes into a Japanese tentacle monster, complete with tongues. You will never have been more wrong about anything in your life.

You will think perhaps you have found the worst part when the ratty ice cream truck turns out to be two robots who speak like they are straight out of the Friday series. The US military decides that they would rather be garishly colored late-model GM street racing cars. The robots, ostensibly twins, have ape-like arms, large ears, prominent gums, buck teeth, and large lips. One of them sports a gold tooth that sways loosely in his mouth. 

They are later revealed to be illiterate.

If you believed then that the Minstrel Twins had to be the worst part of this film, you would also be wrong.

Now if you look at other similar era joysticks like [this](http://mikeshouts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ThinkGeek-USB-Atari-Joystick-544px.jpg) it's clearly intended for right handed use (as in stick in right hand, left hand on button), which is exactly what everyone in my family used, except me.

1356,"Yes it's synthetic. I haven't actually used it yet since it just arrived this morning so I can't give a proper review on it. I did give it a brief test on working up some lather. 

So I had a cheapo ""pure badger"" before which just needed to be replaced as soon as possible - it had no backbone so working up a really good lather was tough even with the arko, it was kind of prickly, and just generally meh. But that's what you get for buying a cheap badger brush eh.

First impressions on the synthetic though - it seems to do everything that the badger brush didn't. The 'hairs' seem to be made of some sort of nylon-esque material. They're actually fairly thick and because of that they feel really soft against the skin despite having plenty of backbone; it worked up a great lather really quickly - like night and day compared to my badger. The hairs are also insanely tough, I doubt any of them will break during my lifetime. The only weak part about the brush seems to be, ironically, the only thing my badger did really well. The badger would soak up water and lather like a sponge and retain it really well; the synth's thickish nonporous hairs means that water tends to escape fairly easily and with a wet lather it can be somewhat drippy. Based on preliminary testing I'd say I'll be using the dry brush method much more, but I'll experiment with it some and report back when I've had a chance to play with it more. The handle is a fairly hard plastic with what I think is plating on it. When I learned it had a plastic handle I was worried it would feel cheap, but it doesn't.

So far the real star of the show though has been my (not pictured) Bulldog post shaving balm for sensitive skin. It feels incredible, leaving my skin feeling soothed and cool and soft, and it also smells fantastic. It has a kind of warm, deep, musky, almost nutty scent; really manly. A stark contrast to the Gilette ""ice cool"" balm I used before which was just horrible in every single way. It's really cheap too, I'd recommend everyone try it out at least once.",2015-06-23 20:24:47+00:00,csgamws,3.0,t1_csg3phh,10347.0,wicked_edge

1360,"I've played 4 green bar games with horrible lag spikes, and 1 red bar games with silky smooth play. I think it's because the bars only really measure latency, and latency matters much less in this game than a reliable, well-synced connection with solid FPS on both ends. I'd much rather play with another 40ms of latency if it means I'm not getting frame drops and having the game eat my inputs. I can adjust for latency because it's predictable, but I can't predict that I'll get a frame drop/lag spike that causes my inputs to suddenly vanish.

Bandwidth matters very little too. Beside the fact that you're capped at the weakest point in the connection which will be the upload bandwidth of one of you, the bandwidth of data sent and received is really very little. What does matter a lot is packet loss and choke.

It's why I try to play training room every time I play, 'cause even though I get perfect fps on every map (except Kuatan Jungle, I dunno wtf is up with that map), if the other guy has frame drops it affects me negatively too.

I have no idea if that's actually true; that number doesn't seem to have a source as far as I can tell, it's just something that's been perpetuated all over the internet. It could have a solid base or it could just be hearsay. It worked well enough for me, though. I unlocked everything in the gambling statue after spending around 200k.

From what I could gather, betting low until you're consistently getting koins back, then increasing steadily, seems like it could be a solid strategy.",2015-06-17 19:03:56+00:00,cs9v0ob,1.0,t3_3a70lj,636.0,MortalKombat
