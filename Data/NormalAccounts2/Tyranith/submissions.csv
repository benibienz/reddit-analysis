The guild was formed way back in TBC, went through a period of inactivity in Cata, and are now becoming active again in Legion. Now the guild is stronger than ever with several veteran core players who have been playing since vanilla.

We are currently farming EN on normal and attempting Heroic. We raid 1-2 times a week and try to find a timeslot that suits everyone, usually on Wednesday evening and/or Saturdays.

We are fairly casual and do not plan on being a cutting edge guild, so min-max is not mandatory. All specs are welcome and we will do our best to accommodate you. However we do expect you to pull your weight in raids by learning your class and encounter mechanics.

As for game, I figure we'll probably start with DnD5e since it's popular and easy to learn, but I'm hoping once we're more comfortable as a group we'll play other games.

I'd like this to be a fairly long-term thing so we can get to know each other and have fun as a group. The plan is to make it a regular weekly thing but I don't mind making it more frequent if that's okay with everyone. 

We can use roll20 or maptool depending on people's preference; I already know how to use maptool but I'm happy to learn roll20.
