29,"These drills are almost universal by now and included in many training programs. 
Of course one will notice the similarity between these drills.
Nobody can claim a soccer move/drill.
We use several sources and including our own imagination.
And since we called it ""Ultimate Soccer Moves Collection"" we want to include as many drills/move we can find/collect for as long as we create these videos.

There are several reasons why we create these videos:

* I had talent when I was young but I never got the support from my parents and I bailed out at the age of 16. I don't want to make the same mistake and give my son all the support he needs to develop and to maximize his progression. I don't care where it leads us as long as he enjoys himself and gets the most out of his abilities. 

* My son started late as a U9 (no pressure from my side) to European standards (most start as a U5-U6 and even younger), so he had a lot of catching up to do. When I started training with him he made a very steep progression in a short time. Thanks to these drills his weak foot is almost on par with his preferred foot. So I believe in these drills.

* He always says he wants to become a pro soccer player, but realistically his chances are perhaps 1 in 5000. I don't want to smash his dreams and when he can say within 10 years from now ""I did all I could"", then he can't blame anybody (including himself).
And when he doesn't make it, somebody else will. And with a little chance that player has viewed and practiced our videos at a younger age. Then our effort was all worth it.


There are other reasons and advantages:

* Our bond is stronger than ever.

* It takes some time away from the Playstation.

* He has to practice them better than he normally would because when you shoot a video, you better do it well.

* By shooting the videos he can see for himself to what he needs to pay attention in order to master the drill/move.

* It works as an extra motivation on days where he would rather skip if he wouldn't have had the channel. He doesn't want to disappoint his subscribers.

And here are the reasons why we think our videos have a plus compared to other resources on the net:

* Seperate videos for every move drill. That makes them easier to find and to pass on to others the link to a specific video/drill/move.

* Our videos are logically organised according to age and/or skill levels. The color scheme makes it obvious to which level every video belongs to.

* We always show both feet in action.

* We shoot from up to 5 different camera angles. Multiplied by 2 because we always show both feet. These short videos take up to 3-5 hours of work to get them online.

* Like most we shoot in HD at a frame rate between 60 and 120 fps so we can deliver relatively good quality slow motion close-ups.

* No blabla and no irritating electronic music.

We are no pros though. So we most certainly appreciate any feedback to improve the quality of our videos.",2016-09-17 20:41:41+00:00,d7qy2vz,2,t1_d7qfimf,33173,SoccerCoachResources

51,"Most of the time he relies on his speed, fast changes of direction and the fact his weak foot (left) is almost as good as his right (thanks to these drills and the fact he has to train both feet evenly). He doesn't have to turn/cut to use his best foot and therefore doesn't hesitate.
I always told him to keep it simple and that keeping ball possession is the first priority. And that's what he does.
He is evenly happy when he gets to deliver a nice assist as he his when scoring himself.
Except for the position 3 (central defender 8v8), he can play at any position.

So no, he doesn't use all of them, but that's ok. Some moves are more appropriate for certain positions on the field and/or situations.
But he got a lot more feeling for the ball and since we train these drills (15 months now). His confidence got an tremendous boost considering he started later than most players (as a U9).
And that was my primary goal. I can try to let him gain as much technical skills and ball coordination, but for the rest it is up to him. And every player develops a certain manner of playing on their own. I don't want to interfere too much.

59,"There is a saying among runners that says ""**in order to run faster, you have to train slower**"".

Buy yourself a cheap watch with a heart rate monitor (can be bought for $20).
Measure your heart rate when in absolute rest (lying in bed or sofa). This is your heart rate at rest. Then look for a hill in the neighborhood. Run up the hill as fast as you can and look at your heart rate. Go down and do it again. The highest heart rate you measure is your max. heart rate. 
70% HRR is your ((max heart rate - heart rate at rest) * 0.7) + heart rate at rest.

Go out and at a slow pace to keep your heart rate below 70% HRR. If you go above, then walk till you get below and start running again.
After two weeks you will notice you will have to walk less and that your heart rate at rest gets lower as well.
Two indications that your basic fitness gets better and better.
The advantages are that you will be less prone to injuries and overdoing it while you'll recover faster.
Remember, an over trained person is slower than a fully recovered one.

By comparison, depending on the basic fitness of a person, if he runs 5 Miles at a heart rate &gt;85% HRR, he might need 2 to 4 days to recover from it.

When your basic fitness is improving, you can throw in some HIIT training where I prefer running up hills since it is easier on the body.

Start from the bottom. The golden years to pick up this ball coordination is between 6 and 12. The more years beyond this range, the more effort it will take.

First of all, you should become confident on the ball. Practise [basic ball control drills](http://ultimatesoccermovescollection.com/videos/ball-control/on-the-spot) (start with blue, then green, then yellow). Don't do too many at the same time, but practise 3 for an half hour for 3 days. Then go to the next 3.

Get confident when moving with the ball (dribbling). [Cones Dribbling](http://ultimatesoccermovescollection.com/videos/ball-control/dribbling-cones) is an excellent way to learn this.

Practise passing and receiving by using a wall. Control the ball with the inside of the foot, outside and the sole. 
Then control the ball in different angles. Straight ahead, then at a 45° angle, 90°.
Control the ball with two steps. With the left foot to the right, then pass. And the opposite. With the right to the left foot, then pass.

Learn 3 [1v1 moves](http://ultimatesoccermovescollection.com/videos/1v1-moves/feints-and-fakes) and learn them really, really well. The Sidestep, Scissor and even a basic cut (inside, outside) might get you on the way.

As for defense, don't rush to the player who has ball possession. He will get you on the wrong foot with a simple cut.
Stay a few feet away and keep your eyes on the ball. Position yourself in such a way he has to take the outside. If you can slow him down, then you did well.
If another teammate challenges the man in ball possession, keep an eye on the opponents. 
Anticipate where they might run to (open space) to get the ball. Whether you keep an eye on a fixed player (according to your position in the team) or the player the closest to you is something you should agree on with your teammates before the game starts.",2016-07-18 13:33:13+00:00,d5grmil,1,t3_4tf11i,2720,bootroom

Sometimes it is enough to pass on the ball and let the ball do its work.

Learn some moves and make them an automatism. The best moves for that position are more 'preventive' moves that changes direction. Cuts, turns, controlling the ball while turning, ...
The best defensive midfielders keep it simple by turning away from the opponent toward open space, cover some distance with the ball and pass it on at the right time.

Just by running smart you can be better than lots of dribble kids.

But you have to read the game. If a player with a position directly related to you steps in, you have to account for that.

Second are your first touches. Stop or control the ball with the same foot as the direction you want to go. This saves time on the turns and half turns.

You may have a slight weaker foot but no weak or bad foot nowadays.
