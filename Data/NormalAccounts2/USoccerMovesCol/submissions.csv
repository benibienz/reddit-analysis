But since he is quite skinny (his torso since his leg muscles are quite developed) his weight is between the 25 and 35 percentile and therefore a bit too less in comparison with his length.
This makes him quite fast and though he uses his shoulders well in duels, he is a bit too light.

I'm going to keep a diary of his food intakes for a month to make sure he gets all the necessary nutrients since he trains a lot (almost every day and very focused).

I want him to gain muscle mass, but I'm very wary of the dangers considering his young age. I don't want to mess with his growth rate and creating imbalances is also a big no no.

I was considering buying a top tier rowing machine for myself and now when I think about it, maybe this could be helpful for my son as well.
When using a rowing machine one has to use lots of muscles (legs, core, shoulders, arms, back, ...) and it is actually fun too.

**TL;DR:**

Would it be a good idea to let a young player (10) do a short session (10-15') on a rowing machine a few times a week in order to gain more muscle mass?",bootroom,A young player in need of building muscle mass.,https://www.reddit.com/r/bootroom/comments/4x771s/a_young_player_in_need_of_building_muscle_mass/

On the medical tests, we had to line up in small groups in our underwear in order to get our blood pressure measured by a nurse and this every half hour.
I was only 19 at the time and was it because of hormones rushing through my blood or just because I was nervous, I don't know.
But there it happened. I got an erection in front of the good looking nurse of around 40.
I could sink into the ground out of shame and she clearly saw I was embarrassed and tried to ease me down with the kind words ""Hey, don't worry about it, you can't help it. It is only nature.""
