251,"Outside my house, there is a super long trail that is dense in forest. It reminds me of the Ordon (?) Forest from Zelda Twilight Princess. There are mostly dense areas but there are a few clearings with heavy canopies. There was never ""peaceful"" feelings there, it's why I stopped going in there. You always had a feeling that something was running out of sight when you look somewhere (Bridge to Terabithia near the ending, the black monster type of running). We set up an outdoor camera in one of the trees (near the ENTRANCE, not in the deep area) and we saw a LOT of giant bears (like abnormally big), and sometimes deers. Whenever we saw deers, there were green eyes in the bushes staring at it (many mountain lions maybe?). 

Also

1. One time, at the entrance, we found a weird rubber ducky buried a little under the ground

2. If you go really deep in the forest, there is an ""unfinished"" tree house, like it's rotting and stuff now

3. Super deep in the forest are tons of hills and I recall a cave. 

4. There is a giant cliff (maybe 200 or so foot drop, not sure exactly) to the right of the trail. 

5. My bulldog goes crazy everytime she comes out here, running really fast back to the house (wildlife smells?)

6. There are snakes
