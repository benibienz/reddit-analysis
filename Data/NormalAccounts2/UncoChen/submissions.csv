Some of the leaves have white marks on them, and some have tears. The white marks are leading to tears, I'm presuming. The plant overall has gotten huge over the past year (it's like, over a foot long?). For the most part, the ""cut"" things aren't seen in the upper leaves. I didn't put the cuts there myself. Also, some of the leaves look ""greasy"" (should be in the last few photos). These are mostly the upper leaves. Is this natural, since they are young leaves? 

Lastly, there are a few weird star things that look like shoots/roots, I attached an image of that also.

So I'm kinda confused on this. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to find the tangent at the point on the graph at x = 2 (I don't think it's differentiable, so it wouldn't be possible?) or find the tangent of the anti-derivative of the graph.

The correct answer is y = x - 5/2

Can someone walk me through this?

I got so far: plugging in 2 for x gives you F(x) = -1/2, so I have so far y + 1/2 = slope(x-2)

I'm not sure what to do here: is slope equal to the slope of the graph of f(t) (that's the derivative I think cause F'(x) = f(x))",HomeworkHelp,[AP Calculus AB] AP Review Question?,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/3x5z4r/ap_calculus_ab_ap_review_question/

1. I only play blind pick, non ranked, solo queue (been doing it for 3 years now, I hate ranked)

2. I main support and jungle, and will sometimes ADC

3. I like playing aggressively, so I've enjoyed Tahm Kench and Karma support

Between Nautilus and Braum, who should I get?

Pros - Naut

1. He can ""carry"" if your ADC doesn't know much about how to play

2. He can top lane, jungle, and adc

3. He deals nice damage and good CC

Pros - Braum

1. Amazing El Tigre skin

2. I've heard he is ""better for solo queue"", not sure why...

3. He has a warm overall feel


Who would you recommend? I'm leaning towards Nautilus, but people have discouraged me saying ""he sucks in this meta"" and that he needs a good team to win. It doesn't seem true though

edit: I didn't mean naut could ADC, I just meant that he could set up kills and catalyse the ADC's carrying phase D:",leagueoflegends,"Overall, which champion fits me better?",http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3evasj/overall_which_champion_fits_me_better/
