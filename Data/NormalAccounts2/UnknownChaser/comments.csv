60,"&gt; First of all, ""Fallen One"" and ""Darklord"" were never ""seperate"" archetypes, as you put it. It was a localization issue that was quickly patched up. Second of all, all the Darklords are DARK, not just some; and most of them are Fairy-Type, but not all (Marie is a Fiend). Those were just some nitpicks.

That was my fault with not replacing Fallen One with Darklord when I was writing this. And I thought Marie was Light for some reason, then again I havent seen the cards in years and subconscious thought she was Light this entire time. 

&gt; And then there's Temptation. I'm actually very confused as to how you managed to come to a conclusion that 2-3 was the correct ratio; it's much less flexible than Rebellion, isn't as disruptive, and is more costly for what it does. Realistically, the ratio would be 0-2.

Another error, I ratios sentence from Rebellion's part and forgot to update.

There's been a lot of misconception and information about this. Konami is not the (main) one to blame for this, Nihon Ad Systems (NAS) mainly is, as they are the copyrights holder of Yugioh.

All Konami does is developed and published the game, meaning they create the cards and products for the game.

NAS is the copyright holder for Yugioh and it properties. Meaning they everything that Konami would make for the game; cards, games, etc, NAS owns it.

When DN first was order to take images off it site, it wasn't Konami that told them, it was NAS. And it is now the same case here with DN and ygopro.

While both Konami and NAS could both together be behind the takedown on the sites, i.e Konami decided to developed their own online simulator, NAS is simply doing what a company is doing, by protecting their IP.

I cut down to only 9 Monsters, 3 Fossil, 3 Wind, and 3 Earth, and 1 T-King. you only really need to see 1 of the SS stopper once. 12 was too much from my play testing and those 3 cards were used for S/T.

Messengers and MST (better in the side and doesnt do much since you're not afraid of anything) dont do much for the deck, take those out. You should play at least 2 Lances for protection and 1 upstart for drawing into other cards. You dont care about LP, since you're playing a stun deck.

Waboku also do much for the deck. I played 3 each of the Elemental force to deal with removals and 3 {{Threatening Roar}}, since its the same thing as Waboku. Consider playing 3 of each. I found that I rather played Starlight Road over THR, as if you have the Wind Statue on board, you get a Stardust for free.

Reckless Greed is also something I found good in the deck, since you wanna draw into your S/T faster.

The deck was to prevent your opponent from SSing due to the Barrier Statue's effect only allowing monster with the same tribute as it to be SS and to beat them down with either {{Moon Mirror Shield}} or {{Metalmorph}}, along with {{Blazing Mirror Force}} to do extra damage. You protect the Statue with Scarecrow and Mirror Force, and used {{The Huge Revolution Is Over}} as protection from mass destruction.

I say cut down on monsters, you only need the 5 exodia cards and 3 {A Cat of Ill Omen} to get out your appropriate faster. Defender is ok, but even with his DEF, it wont stay long on the field.

Play 3 upstarts, its exodia, you have to play it. Consider playing a {Imperial Custom} to protect appropriate. And also {By The Order of the Emperor} as negation. 

Max out on all your draw cards with Reckless, Chicken Game, etc.

3x Scarecrow - switch with fader to play around mind crush/vanity

2x MST - Only need to main 1 and keep 2 side when they side in stuff like Royal

1x Soul Drain - floodgate

1x Skill Drain - floodgate

Thing I realized with Dark Hole/Raigeki/Monster removal is that no monster that you're scare off or hurt that much, except Jinzo and Denkko, which you can play around with Soul Taker that you'll side in game 2.",2015-06-27 03:40:31+00:00,csk6qm7,3.0,t1_csk49jn,5382.0,yugioh
1777,"Nurse burn player here.

Due to the the speed of the format now, stalling just isn't that great anymore for Nurse IMO, you now wanna draw all cards faster, so you can set up OTK next turn

Most Nurse built now run the Hope Engine as the main built, as you can plus way harder then any other deck.

-1 Nurse - Take out 1 Nurse, becomes cloggy if you draw into/with them.

-1 CCD - I'm not much of a fan of CCD anymore, it's too slow now and can stop easily by your opponent, take out 1.

-3 Swiftscriw - More of a side deck card.

-1 Santa - Lava is better.

-1 Snipe - Take up your summon, any monster can be dealt with Lava and any backrow can be dealt with MST

+1 Battle Fader - Becomes a small wall and a Allure target.

+1 Lava - Bump Lava to 2, it gets rid of problematic monsters your opponent has. 

-1 MST - the only thing you're scare off is Royal and no one main those.

-1 Dark Hole - Not scare of any monster

+1 Allure - 5 dark targets.

+2/3 Duality - Search faster

-3 Waboku - 7 stall cards is good enough

-1 Path - It's bad.

+3 Hope - Best engine for the deck, Nurse/Bad is a double edge sword, if you lose it during the combo, you most likely won't recover. hope fixes that.

+2 Life Equalizer - Set up the OTK.

 +2/3 Accumulated Fortune - You set up enough chains to get the +2 from it. 

So yeah, those are just my personal thought on Nurse, base on my own built and test. Currently trying the Chicken Race engine for it atm, it does ok and has some combo with the Hope built.
