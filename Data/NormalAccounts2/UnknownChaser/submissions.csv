[Shameless video plug where I talk about this for 20 min go here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M77nhsF43_4)

Ok, so we all probably all seen the supposed OTS 3 list thats been floating around and being with nothing better I decided to go in-depth and analyze this supposed list and its content on why it can or can not, but mostly cannot be real.

So strap in kids, cus this is about to be a wall of text.

So starting off with the Ulti; F0, Diamond Dire Wolf, Foolish.

* **{Diamond Dire Wolf}** - Most Ulti in a tournament pack have something to do with the current meta game, with DDW, I can see being an actual thing due to ABC running it and as history have shown. Rank 4, such as Cowboy, Castel, and such have gotten the Ulti treatment in the past. 

* **{Number F0: Utopic Future}** - Now this is the odd card out of the Ulti, as it have no reason to be an Ulti, unless Komoney decide to keep BA around for another 5 years and want people to high rarity out the deck. Then again, we have had random Ulti such as Fog King in the last pack.

* **{Foolish Burial}** - This is a card that is currently being played with deck such as LS or Dark Synchro, this is a card that no one was asking to be Ulti. But that hasn't stop Konami before on making cards in OTS Ulti, such as Rageki. Its nice to have, but no one was asking for it.

For the Super; Ice + Fire Hand, Radian the Multidimensional Kaiju, Swap Frog, Senju, Herald of Perfection, Performage Trapeze Magician, Mask Change II, Moon Mirror Shield, Artifact Lancea.

* **{Ice Hand} + {Fire Hand}** - There is no reasons for these to be reprinted as we got them earlier this year with Premium Gold 3 and Dragon of Legend 3.

* **{Radian the Multidimensional Kaiju}** - This is a card I can actually see, due to the presence of Kaiju in the metagame as an out to cards, but why Radian is the questions, as he is one of the non popular one to be using that isn't Gamecial. Kumongous would be one that make more sense as a Super since he is actually uses.

* **{Swap Frog}** - \#HOLOSWAPFROG2K16. With the release of Toadally Awesome, Konami have stated they do have plans to re-released the Frogs with PSCT to now not include their text not listing ""Frog the Jam"". Swap Frog as a reprint would make sense in this way for it be printed.

* **{Senju of the Thousand Hands}** - TBH I am not complaining about this, Senju has only been printed as Common, Rare, and DT, and with Ritual will always be thing, Konami might see this as a way to give a rarity bump.

* **{Herald of Perfection}** - With CyberAngelHerald.dek being a thing, Konami might see this as a reason to be reprinting him.

* **{Performage Trapeze Magician}** - Why are you reprinted? No one uses you anymore, PePe is dead, go home.

* **{Mask Change II}** - Has a already gotten a reprint earlier this year, but due to Frog HERO being a thing now, Konami might be seeing this as a reason to print it Super to match Super regular Mask Change.

* **{Moon Mirror Shield}** - This is a card that I have no problem being Super, but the problem is the only decks that is currently using these are Demise-based deck to make sure their monster can beat over things.

* **{Artifact Lancea}** - A card I can see being Super, it has been gaining traction lately due to being a hand trap against ABC.

Now for the Commons card; Felis, Honest, Reborn Tengu, Archlord Krystia, Tin Goldfish, DMG, Wetlands, Poisonous Winds, A Hero Lives, Spell Economics.

* **{Felis, Lightsworn Archer}** - No reason for you to be reprinted, just because Micheal was reprinted last set, we dont need you.

* **{Honest}** - We have already had enough reprints of you, we dont need more.

* **{Reborn Tengu}** - This isn't Tengu Plants, who you trying to fool?

* **{Archlord Krystia}** - This I can see due to Darklord being released the next day after OTS 3 come out, as builds either run 1 or 3 of her.

* **{Tin Goldfish}** - With Frog HEROs being a thing, this is a card I can see being reprinted.

* **{Dark Magician Girl}** - This card literally RKO out of nowhere, unless this is the YAP's artwork, this is just random and out of place.

* **{Wetlands}** - With Paleozoic being a thing, this does make sense, as you do play it in certain builds.

* **{Poisonous Winds}** - The only Wind decks out that are Majespecter, I see no other reason on why this needs to be reprinted and this doesn't even stop the deck at all.

* **{Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen}** - Same reason as Krystia, as it can be played in Darklord, but shouldn't, but why is this being reprint, but not its searcher card; {Hecatrice}?

* **{A Hero Lives}** - Frog HEROs are a thing m'kay and people apparently can not afford to get the common reprint from the HERO deck that cost 5 cent. So Konami decided to reprint it.

* **{Spell Economics}** - For a low low price of 3.99, you can now afford not to pay half your Life Point to play A hero Lives!

Then finally for the Short-print Commons; Dark Paladin (Alternative Art}, Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon (Alternative Art), Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress 2.

* **{Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress 2}**- This card has already been printed in the first Tournament Pack, there is no reason for it to be printed again. Nearly all of the times, the common short print are OCG-only normal monster that has something to do with the short-print Fusion monster.

* **{Dark Paladin}** - Why is this being reprinted again? We just had this in the Legendary Deck. Also, this is not a random vanilla Fusion monster, unless this set breaks the tradition of the Fusion monster being OCG import of vanilla Fusion monster, that is the only reasons I can see it being reprinted.

* **{Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon}** - The list listed **Alternative Art** for Ultimate Dragon but the problem here is that the only other artwork of him is the 2001 championship artwork that given out as a prize, which in no way in Konami's mind would they reprint something like at a common, unless that thing 1 per country.

Some final thoughts; **{Frog the Jam}** was not listed as being reprinted, even though Konami have stated he is gonna received a name change so that hes no longer listed in all the Frog monster's text and this pack would be the perfect place to do it. Also to note that other Frog monsters are also not reprinted in this set and only Swap Frog is, which makes no sense since they all have to receive the PSCT that doeskin list Frog the Jam now.

I stopped working on them, due to suffering  a burnout, along with school, and work. But now I'm back.

For those uninformed, it was a project I started last year that combine 2 of my favorite subject; Yugioh and Game of Thrones. It was where I would take various archtypes within the game and create [house motto](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_words) for them. The last one I done was [House Monarch](http://imgur.com/a/AFuMT).

One of the hardest part besides from spending hours on making them minimalism was honestly the house quotes. So this is where you all can come in, below I have listed some, if now all, the archtypes I'm planing to do for this season and want your help on thinking up what would be the house quotes to represent them.

Listed in no order;

* Dark Magician

* Blue Eyes 

* Aromage

* PSY-Frame

* Gadget

* Shiranui

* Graydle

* Spellbook

* Digitial Bug

* Igknight

* Dinomist

* Metalfoes

* Majespecter

* Amorphage

* Blackwing

* Raidraptor

Yeah, as you can see, this season gonna be pretty big. If you have any ideas on what would represent each archtypes, let me hear your ideas and I'll take them in consideration when working on them.
