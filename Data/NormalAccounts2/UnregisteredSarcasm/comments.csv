37,"A friend of mine freaked out one day when I put tomato sauce on my chips at a restaurant. (I'm British, so I'm going to keep calling them chips, but for you Americans, I mean fries.)
She absolutely went crazy about how it ""made no sense"" to her and she was ""upset"" by it. She thought I should put a dollop in the corner and dip, and any other way was ""wrong"". It was really annoying. 

So next time I had chips, I drizzled them in sauce again, took a photo, and texted it to her. She went crazy again. So I did it the next time. And the next. And the next. 

Eventually (10 photos later) she promised to text me every minute, counting down to her holiday until I promised to stop sending these pictures. I saw an opportunity. I promised to never text her pictures of chips and sauce again. She agreed with this truce.

So for the past 5 months I've been taking pictures every time I have sauce on chips, and saving the photos. I never promised I wouldn't send them at all, only that I'd never text them; so at Christmas I'm going to send them to her in the post.",2016-08-19 14:14:21+00:00,d6o226l,1.0,t3_4yfkqk,52538.0,AskReddit

The ""You In?"" phenomenon. When someone suggests going somewhere and checks everyone's interested by pointing to them one by one and saying ""Avengers? Avengers? Avengers?"" (Word changes depending on event)

And this isn't really a joke but how strongly the table positions are respected. Their seats on the table are always significant and portray power balance.

89,"To The Sky
Tokyo
How I Became the Sea
Live it Up

So many, but if I had to choose 4, these would be them

To the Sky - what a sweet little song, it's incredibly bright and uplifting, I can't ever get enough of it

Tokyo - often missed out, but has some of the best track production I've ever heard. Same goes for his work on Mr Heartache, but as that's not under the name Owl City it doesn't count

How I Became the Sea - my personal favourite Owl City track. It really stands out on the album, starting with those gentle synths and building to a thumping dance beat. The lyrics are gorgeous and so interesting to speculate about (I think it's about the sudden rise to fame he had in his career), and the synths and strings at the end melt together perfectly. The melody at the dance section comes from Ocean Eyes and is echoed in Kamikaze, so it really ties together a lot of his musical ideas and then that dance synth fades away into a sweet little sine+square/saw wave synth, probably the same one from Cave In and Hello Seattle. And finally I'll just mention the percussion. It's SO complex. If you can find the instrumental of it, give it a listen. Like so many of his songs, the drums are incredibly complex, something you never notice on first listen (the middle section of Cave In is a great example of this too). It's just one of those songs where there's more to hear each time you listen to it.

Live it Up - I don't even know where this song comes from but I just really like it. It's definitely different from his usual styles, going for a kind of pop/rock mainstream feel good kind of thing, but he totally pulls it off and it's altogether a very solid track which definitely deserves more appreciation",2016-07-20 09:45:03+00:00,d5jd5sg,1.0,t3_4rpqlm,1095997.0,OWLCITY

What I don't like is how effective it is, a lot of the time ",2016-07-07 12:15:51+00:00,d52pcco,1.0,t3_4rjgk6,69650.0,thatHappened
