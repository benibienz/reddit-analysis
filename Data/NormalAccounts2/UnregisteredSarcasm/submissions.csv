He takes historical events, imagines them as movies, and then makes the soundtrack for those movies. Once a month, for free.

But the topics for the albums is incredibly closely aligned with the things Brady likes to talk about. Apollo 11, Everest, the Andes plane crash, Voyager 1...

I'm just beginning to think Brady might be secretly orchestrating this project.

Also you should definitely check out the project, some of the music is pretty cool (The Ascent of Everest, Voyager 1, and Project Excelsior are my favourites) http://www.ayoungscores.com

I'm using a MacBook Pro, running Mac OS X El Capitan. 

I have no real need to keep music files on my laptop, but I like to have them on my iPhone. So that's what I do. But if you sync an iPhone with a laptop that doesn't have the music files your phone does, it erases the music files from the phone. 

So to save space on my laptop, I have moved all the audio files to an external hard drive.
All my music lives on that hard drive and my phone, with my laptop as a passage between the two. But whenever I buy new songs, they get saved to my laptop, so every now and then I have to copy all new songs to the hard drive and delete from the laptop then reassign the file locations. 
It's crazy, but it saves space, however I feel like my music is on a knife edge, and I could lose it any day. 

Does anybody know of a better solution for me? What I want is to keep all the files on my phone, and a backup location. But I need iTunes to not erase the songs from the phone when I sync.",techsupport,Storing music files externally,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/4v1w9b/storing_music_files_externally/
