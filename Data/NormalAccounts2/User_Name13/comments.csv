17,"While India would've always been water stressed, the exponential population growth in India has really exacerbated this problem to its current proportion. 

There are several states in India that are being forced to turn over their own river water to other states in India by the Indian central government. 

The Indian central government imposes its will on states in India and in turn decides which states will be prosperous and which states will be impoverished, based on the central governments whims. 

The reason that Canada for instance has so many Sikhs is because the state that Sikhs are from in India was involved in the largest of these water disputes in India between the state and federal government. The Indian central government tried to force the Sikhs to give up the vast majority of their river water to non-riparian state and predictably the Sikhs said no, as the state they're from in India, Punjab, is an agrarian state. 

So the central government decided to impose the river water sharing agreement upon Punjab and the Sikhs. AKA, they were going to take the water by force. This started an insurgency movement in Punjab, which created a great deal of violence between the central government and civilians in Punjab. The reason that so many Sikhs came to Canada after this dark period in the 1980's and 90's is because they were being oppressed in India by the central government. The Sikhs are a minority in India that constitute just 1.7% of the population and they were attacked by the Hindu majority in a series of pogroms across India for which no one has gone to jail for to this day.

I really see the issue of water in India as the next big powder-keg problem for planet Earth. 

There are 1.3 billion people in India and that number is set to increase by another 200 hundred million the next 30 years before leveling off at 1.5 billion. 

Where is the water going to come from for all these people? 

I think the West better get used to taking in Indian refugees that have fled India because the central government came for their drinking water one day and then imposed military rule over them when they protested. 

Sorry for the rant, it's just that this is happening again right now in India again to the Sikhs, as the central government is demanding even more of their river water for other states. ",2016-11-15 14:54:27+00:00,da1aio2,2.0,t1_da19y20,861.0,todayilearned

33,"The Hindu government won't be happy until they've taken the last drop of water from the Sikhs. 

This is religious discrimination plain and simple. 

The Sikhs are being punished by having water stolen from us because we are not Hindu. 

We are nothing more than 2nd class citizens in India. 

Water, the lifeblood of our farmers, is arbitrarily taken from our rivers and given to other states. 

That tyrant Indira Gandhi is responsible for all of this. The Indira Gandhi Canal was the worst thing to ever happen to Punjab and the Sikhs.

If Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi, the non-riparian states in this equation want water from Punjab, the riparian state, then let them pay a royatly for it, like non-riparian states do to riparian states all over the world. 

Why is it that Punjabis should get short changed on the annual royalty that is owed to them from the non-riparian states cashing in on Punjab's water?

Could it be because Sikhs make up 60% of Punjab's population and are a religious and ethnic minority in the country and this is the Hindu run, central governments way of breaking Punjab and the Sikhs. 

Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi should be paying an annual royalty to Punjab for that river water they've been getting for free all these decades. 

It's a damn tragedy that the Sikhs were actually treated better by the British than we are by the Hindus. The Sikhs were better off under British colonialism than we are now.

Ever since the Hindus took over the country, they've been destroying the Sikhs, they want to tear us down. There's an undeniable pattern. The Julianwalla Bagh Massacre was nothing compared to what the Hindus did to the Sikhs in 1984. 

To say that India under Hindu rule is discriminatory towards minorities would be an understatement. 

What is one good thing that has been done for Punjab since 1947? 

Every few years the Hindu government returns, demanding more and more free water for their ever-expanding population.

Here is what is wrong with that, Punjab and Haryana are 2 of the richest states in India, and they both have healthy total fertility rates, the TFR in Punjab is only [1.68.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_ranking_by_fertility_rate)

Here are the populations of the 4 northern states that are red:

Population of Punjab - 27 million

Population of Haryana - 25 million

Population of Uttar Pradesh - 210 million

Population of Bihar - 110 million

See the problem? 

One of the main reasons that the population in Punjab and Haryana is even as high as is, is because of completely unbridled migration from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Right now nearly 12% of the population of Punjab is comprised of impoverished migrant workers who migrated to Punjab from Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. When those 2 states have such massive populations and no employment opportunities, what do you think the people there are going to do? 

Unfortunately when those migrants move to Punjab they bring all their bullshit with them. They bring their illiteracy, they bring their backwards moral values, they bring their religious zealotry with them, it's a problem. 

The problem is that India is all one big country, so when you have massive amounts of migrants moving from one state to another state, coupled with the fact that most Indians don't even speak the same language, it really turns into a problem. It's not like 1 state can stop another state's migrants from moving in, the central government would step in, in favor of the state sending out migrants and admonish the state trying to preserve its culture and living standards.

Now lets see how many of those same Hindus will be there to help the Sikhs in their time of need. 

None. 

Punjab will turn into a desert while politicians in Delhi lecture Punjabis on how to better conserve water or tell us what kind of crops to grow on our own land with the water from Punjab's river. 

Those Punjabis who warned us in the 80's that Punjab's ruin would ultimately be Delhi's reckless anti-Punjab water policies, grow more prophetic with each passing year. 

Groundwater levels fall further and further, there's less and less water for Punjabi farmers every year.

Punjab is only allocated 3.5 MAF of water from its own river, the Satlej River, and Rajasthan gets 4.5 MAF from it, despite the fact that Rajasthan is a non-riparian state. So Rajasthan gets 4.5 million acre feet from the Satlej and what do they have to show for it? 

Nothing. 

Rajasthan uses all that water for subsistence for its massive population of [75 million and counting.](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=population%20of%20rajasthan)

In 1981, before Rajasthan started getting all of this free water from Punjab, the population was only [34 million.](http://statisticstimes.com/population/population-of-rajasthan.php)

A far cry from the 75 million they're up to now, and with an average total fertility rate in Rajasthan of 3.2 kids per woman, that number is going to go up a lot over the next couple of decades. 

So instead of Punjab getting to keep more of its own river water from the Satlej, Rajasthan gets the bulk of it, and they have little-to-nothing to show for all of this water, except for a much higher population.

If this is how Hindus treat other Hindus, it really begs the question what its like to be a minority in India? 

Answer: it's not good to be a minority in India. 

Every now and again Hindus will engage in riots and begin attacking minority groups. 

Case in point, the [1984 Anti-Sikh riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-Sikh_riots), in which Sikhs, a minority which only constituted about 2% of the country's populace, were mercilessly attacked in New Delhi no less, India's capital, in all **approximately 3,325 Sikhs were murdered** in the streets of New Delhi. To make matters worst, the pogroms were instigated and initiated by India's ruling political party at the time, the Congress party, which was presided over by Indira Gandhi, the daughter of India's first Prime Minister, Nehru. 

India's most famous actor, Amitabh Bachan, even went on the radio and called for violence against the Sikhs, [he incited a riot on All-India Radio](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1984-riots-Why-nobody-noticed-Amitabh-Bachchan-spewing-venom-in-India/articleshow/10429011.cms) and even he hasn't been punished for it yet, if anything he's been rewarded by widespread continued fandom from the Indian public. 

No one has gone to jail for the Anti-Sikh riots and its been 32 years and the families whose loved ones were murdered by Hindu rioters still haven't received compensation. 

The entire reason my family fled India for the US was to escape Hindu persecution. 

The irony is that Hindus love to bring up the fanaticism and intolerance in Islam, but ignore their own atrocities, pretty convenient for them I imagine.

Anyways, this is what its like to be a minority group in India.

It's not good to be a minority group in India, India loves to tout itself as being a secular democracy, but until they can finally deliver justices to the survivors of the 1984 Anti-Sikh pogroms, I won't consider them to be anything better than a Hindu version of Pakistan.

Sikhs outside India do well because we have the equal protection of law in the West, which is something that we were not afforded in India, clearly by the lack of action taken on those responsible for torturing and murdering 3.325 Sikhs in Delhi. 

Sikhs have much more protection in the US, Canada, UK and Australia than we do in our own homeland. 

What's especially ironic is that Indian media which is completely controlled by the same families that run the Congress party, completely ignores the massacre in 1984 and when it does it bring it up, its only to talk about how right the Indian government was in their actions, but the Indian media is always good for covering bad things that happen to Sikhs around the world, especially in the West, for example when Sikhs get attacked in the West because they are confused for being Muslim. 

Western media on the other hand, doesn't do a good job of covering it when Sikhs are attacked in the West because they were confused as being Muslim, but does an excellent job of covering the atrocities of '84.

We could do a little bit better in the fertility rate but not much better, considering that 2.0 kids per woman is considered the optimum fertility rate for women in developed nations.

The problem is that these other impoverished states, are increasing their population so much, that they can send over millions of migrants to Punjab and it doesn't dent their population, but its enough to completely change the demographics of Punjab. 

Consider [this submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/54rdno/til_that_there_are_2_million_bihari_migrants_in/) which got me banned from /r/india BTW, about the fact that there are already approximately 2.5 million Biharis in Punjab and they make up roughly 7.5% of the population already. 

There's still approximately 110 million Biharis left in Punjab and with a fertility rate of 3.2 kids per woman, that means that there are a lot more Biharis on their way to Punjab in the near future.

Also, I didn't say that Kashmiris were great people, just that as a Punjabi who had people in his family extrajudicially murdered by the Indian government during the 80's, I can really empathize with the plight of the Kashmiris.

What they don't understand is that one of the main reasons I harp so much on the BIMARU states is precisely because I hate seeing other Indians perpetually impoverished and suffering poor living conditions for decades on end. In these BIMARU states the poverty is inter-generational in most families, it's all these people know. 

The leaders in these BIMARU states have completely failed their people by not addressing the 6,000 pound elephant in the room, overall population and the total fertility rate in these states.

Whenever I hear one of these triggered randian start screaming about bigotry in the BIMARU state threads, I'm reminded of the Black Lives Matter activists in the US, who ignore the **thousands** of black on black murders every year and focus all their attention on the **tens** of unarmed black men shot every year by white police officers. They immediately discredit themselves in the debate by being in such severe denial as to what the main problem is. 

Calling you a bigot is the ultimate cop-out, it means they don't have a good response, and its aim is to put you on the defensive and also to get you off the topic of massive overpopulation in the BIMARU states. 

If we sit around worrying about offending each other all day, our population will be up to 2 billion before the people from the BIMARU states stop getting offended, and by that point they'll have a stranglehold over the country, because of our wonderful democracy. 

Another quick point, the massive overpopulation in the BIMARU states also undermines and makes me resent democracy. How is it fair that these BIMARU states can rampantly reproduce like this without any care for the state of the nation, and their reward is greater power in the Central government. All the while that these BIMARU states have just been adding to their votebank power and not improving in terms of much else, other states have actually been working hard to improve themselves and develop and what is their reward?

Stay in Bihar man.

Furthermore, they refuse to assimilate into Punjabu culture or learn the language. This isn't just happening in Punjab either,  Haryana is also getting it too and other states as well, but especially Punjab and Haryana, because of all the bhaiyya work available in those states.

For example if you are someone who is fortunate enough to make 1.6 lakh per month, then you should be allowed to have up to 3 kids. If you break the new law and have a 4th kid, you and your wife will forfeit your right to vote and you will lose any and all government benefits that you could've been eligible for, prior to having the 4th kid. 

If you are an impoverished Indian, you should only be allowed to have one kid and that is all, now because the biggest problem that we have is the poor having to many children, this will go a long way in stifling population growth. Even if the poor only have 1 kid, you will begin to see India's population begin to decline from its current numbers in 30-40 years. 

Working poor, lower middle-class and middle class people would be allowed to have 2 kids in my scenario. 

1.6 lakh per month would put you in the upper middle-class bracket, granting you the opportunity to have the 3rd child. 

If you are rich, you would only be allowed to have one more kid than the upper middle class Indian, meaning you would be allowed to have 4 kids. 

An important point, if someone does break the law and has an additional child over the limit based on their income, only they will lose their right to vote and government benefits, not the additional child, as it is not the child's fault that the parents chose to irresponsibly procreate and have a kid they cannot provide for. Thereby greatly increasing the chances that the child will become a burden to the state or society.

What does Punjab get in return? 

Not a damn thing. 

More and more Punjabi farmers are committing suicide every year because of lack of water for irrigation. 

If Rajasthan is not ever going to get its population under control, then they should have to pay an annual royalty to Punjab for that water. That would be fair. Punjab is rapidly running out of groundwater, which Punjab only ever resorted to using, because of non-riparian states using water from the Satlej River. 

How is this scenario in any way fair to the people of Punjab, who only have 1.68 kids on average, and can't even use their own river water, because people in Rajasthan, a desert state, chose to have 75 million people in that 1 state alone? 

Why should Punjab and Punjabis be punished for it? 

We Punjabis are solely bearing the brunt of this population explosion in Rajasthan, no other state state is being asked to pay for it.

It's kind of frustrating to see Karnatakans get all mad about water sharing with a riparian state when your own people were rather recently massacred wholesale by the Indian central government in a much more unjust scenario.

**FTA:**

*People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) logistical base at Djibouti doesn’t just provide support for China’s anti-piracy missions, but also enables a round-the-year naval presence in the Indian Ocean. What’s more, China’s recent commercial facilities in the Indian Ocean region seem more in the nature of dual-use bases that can quickly be upgraded to medium-grade military facilities in the event of a regional crisis.*

*New Delhi must come to terms with the fact that LEMOA’s utility lies in facilitating greater US-India operational coordination in Asia. Notwithstanding Parrikar’s assurances to the contrary, closer Indo-US maritime interaction will increasingly involve operational access to each other’s bases for strategic purposes. As a result, the reciprocal logistic support will increasingly be used to achieve a favourable balance-of-power in Asia.*

*This does not mean LEMOA promotes American geopolitical interests at India’s expense. If anything, the pact empowers the Indian Navy to expand its own presence operations in the Indo-Pacific region.*

*Given the fraught nature of strategic security in the Asian commons, India has been looking for ways to emphasize a rules-based order in the region. In order to consolidate its status as a crucial security provider, the Indian Navy must act in close coordination with the US Navy to ensure a fair, open and balanced regional security architecture.*

China already has logistical bases in Djibouti that it can use to launch anti-piracy missions in the Indian Ocean. Those logistical bases could easily be turned against India in the event of war breaking out with China. China started this naval escalation by setting up those logistical bases in Djibouti, the anti-piracy missions are only an excuse for China to boost its presence in the Indian Ocean.

India needs to join up with the US and increase our in presence in the Indian Ocean. As it stands, India's navy is in a pathetic condition, India's biggest enemies have always been at its Northwest and Northeast borders, Pakistan and China. So one cannot really blame India for not prioritizing developing its Navy. However, now that one of those enemies, China, is trying to effectively encircle India by boosting its naval presence in the Indian Ocean, India is feeling the pressure. 

I am a big fan of this move by India in allying itself with the US. Manohar Parrikar and Modi see which way the wind is blowing. Maritime trade routes are something that China seems to be standing firm on, and the South China Sea debacle is something that seems primed to start a larger conflict. Trade routes have historically been things that large powers have waged massive wars to ensure for their nations. I think its happening again now. If China wants to attempt to use Pakistan and its own naval presence to encircle India, then India should respond in kind by teaming up with Japan and the US to create its own strategic containment zone around China.

So much water has been taken from Punjab for these non-riparian states, that Punjabi farmers can't even get enough water to irrigate their own crops. At the same time you hear Haryanvi farmers boasting about how now they are the richest farmers in the country, and they are achieving that feat with free water that is being taken from Punjab's Satlej River. Punjabi farmers whose entire lives depend on water from the Satlej to irrigate their crops are literally watching that water dwindle more and more, as farmers in Haryana get richer with more free water from Punjab.

At the same time, you have Rajasthan with a booming population of 75 million people and an [average birth rate 2.80 children per couple, which is very high.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_ranking_by_fertility_rate)

Compare that to the state of Punjab, where the birthrate for couples [is only 1.68 children per couple.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_ranking_by_fertility_rate) Why is it that Rajasthanis should continue to be able to have so many kids, when they already have 75 million people living in that state? 

This documentary does a great job showing how the population has simply exploded in Rajasthan, despite the state being mostly desert, and deserts usually being sparsely populated. Rajasthan is a complete anomaly, it is a highly populated desert state, it defies all logic. If it weren't for all the free water Rajasthan has been getting from Punjab since the 80's, that states population wouldn't have boomed the way it has the last 30+ years.

[Look at the change in Rajasthan's population from 1951 onwards.](http://statisticstimes.com/population/population-of-rajasthan.php)

In 1961 Rajasthan only had [20 million people.](http://statisticstimes.com/population/population-of-rajasthan.php)

Then, by 1971 it was up to [25 million.](http://statisticstimes.com/population/population-of-rajasthan.php)

By 1981 it was up to [34 million.](http://statisticstimes.com/population/population-of-rajasthan.php)

By '91 it got up to [44 million.](http://statisticstimes.com/population/population-of-rajasthan.php)

In '01 it was [56.5 million.](http://statisticstimes.com/population/population-of-rajasthan.php)

Now they're all the way up to 75 million.

Rajasthan is increasing its population by well over 20% every 10 years. At the rate Rajasthan is increasing its population, Rajasthan will have something like 82.5 million people by 2021, despite being a desert-state. It's unbelievable.

Why should Punjabi's, who have the 2nd lowest birthrate in India, with just [1.68 kids per couple,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_ranking_by_fertility_rate) continue to subsidize the increasingly poor life-style decisions of the people in Rajasthan who by the way have the [4th highest birthrate in India with 2.80 kids per couple?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_ranking_by_fertility_rate)

Punjab is literally being bled dry trying to give the 75 million+ Rajasthanis enough water, and at the rate they are increasing their population their will never be enough water for Rajasthan. 

Punjabi farmers are being driven to suicide because they can't even use their own state's water to irrigate their crops, but Rajasthanis meanwhile are continuing to have kids like the world is ending tomorrow, its incredibly frustrating. 

Here you have the Punjabis, who are doing everything to get by with less and less of their own water every year, and Rajasthanis are building homes new in the middle of the desert for their booming population and complaining how there's not enough water. It's so beyond fucked up. 

Good on you for talking about this RT. No Indian media outlet is willing to discuss the incredible injustice that is being done to Punjabi farmers right now. 

This is exactly what the Sikhs in the 80's warned about, they warned that the Delhi central government would come and take all of Punjab's water to account for the ever-booming population and rather than do the obvious thing in taking on India's overpopulation issue, the central government would simply steal all of Punjab's water. 

Those dire warning have now come to fruition. Delhi, Haryana and especially Rajasthan are addicted to free Punjabi water and they won't stop now until Punjab is a desert like Rajasthan, by then Rajasthan will have something like 90 million+ people and they'll still be wondering why there is not enough water.",2016-09-05 12:48:03+00:00,d7a6yf1,1.0,t3_519351,2943.0,india

You guys are in the bubble to much to see or hear it, but that's how this self post is coming off. 

Okay, Aziz's dad didn't have a cross burned on his front-yard, but this was also in the 1970's, so OP's reference to the struggles that immigrants faced in the 20's isn't really relevant. In the 20's black people couldn't vote and Jim Crow was in full swing, it was a completely different nation.

Its almost like you guys are only comfortable with Indians being doctors, IT guys and cab drivers. As soon an Indian starts engaging in social commentary he is relegated to being an SJW. 

I'm Indian, and I've experienced plenty of racism in my life. 

You know how many times I've been called sandnigger? Plenty. 

Let me guess, that doesn't count as racism because it was only because they thought I was Muslim, so I guess that absolves the people who called me sandnigger of their offense, yeah, no that's bullshit, that counts as racism because they called me sandnigger because I'm brown, not because of what they think my religion may or may not be. 

So don't tell me that Indians don't experience racism in this country cause that's complete bullshit. 

Sikhs get harassed routinely and have even been murdered because dumbass rednecks can't differentiate between them and those dirty Mooslims, they hate so much. 

What about the [Sikh temple shooting 4 years that resulted in 6 deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Sikh_temple_shooting), I guess that doesn't count, does it, how convenient to your narrative. Some dumb fucking redneck who was also an Iraq war veteran, decides to shoot up a temple full of brown people, that he was **sure** were Muslim, except they weren't, and as soon as the MSM found out that it was an Iraq war vet the story conveniently disappeared. We can't have our veterans looking mentally deranged, racists now can we? That might be bad for recruitment, so they effectively swept the massacre under the rug.

We could've won the war and proved to the rest of the world that we were a major player in Asia, instead we lost the war and were relegated to being a player in South Asia alone. 

It was the single dumbest thing India has ever done during a war and no one talks about it, because its considered unpatriotic to talk about Nehru. That is ridiculous, you should be able to point out the man's errors, of which deciding not to use the Indian Air Force in the '62 war was quite possibly the largest. 

I can never rationalize his idiotic method of thinking, if you have a tactical advantage over your enemy, why not use it? 

I've heard many Nehru-apologists theorize that Nehru didn't call their Air Force up because he was mislead by the US CIA not to do so, but that's bullshit, it's ultimately up to him and his military command to decide what to do, don't try to blame your screw ups on the head of the CIA, sitting on the other side of the world in Washington. 

The other theory I've heard was that Nehru feared a Chinese aerial assault on Indian cities, that had no air cover from the Indian Air Force, chiefly Calcutta. I even have to call bullshit on that though to, because they were already involved in war with China at that point, there was no going back, India was already in to deep to turn back. It sounds like Nehru and his Forward Policy got cold feet after the war started and was not going India's way. 

Not very strong leadership from Nehru on this one. Pretty shitty to be honest. There was little to no communication between Nehru and his generals, there was poor coordination going on among the Indian army itself.

More policy shakeups happen during a time of war than during a time of peace. 

As China flexes its muscles more in the South China Sea and engages in saber-rattling with Japan, you'll begin to see the US and India getting that much more cozy in military relations. 

That is to say, if China wasn't pursuing its current course of action in the South China Sea, you wouldn't see this level of FDI in their biggest rival on the continent, India. China is forcing the US to extend its hand to India, otherwise Modi's administration would've seen a little surge in FDI, but nothing like the 5-fold increase we have just witnessed. 

China is not going to back down, neither will the US-Japanese alliance, this leaves the US and Japan in a situation where they will be very desperate to make concessions to India in exchange for India allowing the US to launch attacks on China from India, most likely the northeast states. 

India will be in a strong bargaining position in the near future with the US and Japan, and I think all 3 countries will come to an agreement either during wartime or the days/weeks/months that lead up to the war.

India has a lot to gain from this sort of agreement, the biggest thing would be China backing off its claim to land along our border with China in Arunachal Pradesh, beyond that, I'm sure Japan has a lot of technology that their corporations would be much more willing to share with Indian corporations in exchange for India assisting Japan &amp; the US in getting China off those contested islands in the S.

In their minds when they did that, they were still in China, or at least that was their rationale. 

For India to truly become a greater power, we have to buck the Chinese, at least to an extent. Right now, the score between India and China stands at 1-0 in China's favor. The 1962 defeat India suffered to China was a tragic blow to India's projected image of a burgeoning Asian power, and it relegated us to only being a South-Asian power.

311,"Okay, here's what I think and bear with me cause this is going to be long one. 

The US and India just signed a defense logistics agreement meaning that the 2 nations have moved much closer to one another. This coincides with the Hague ruling that China has no claim to a chain of islands in the South China Sea. The US is going to to make an ally of India and in return they get India's help in encircling China. Conceivably the US could now launch attacks from Indian soil into China in the event of a war between China and Japan over said islands in the South China Sea. This makes India an indispensable ally in a US war against China. 

While Modi has made India a more desirable place to do business, I believe Modi knows the real reason that India is getting all this love from the US is because backroom deals have been made between elites in the US and India. Which ensure India's support for the US if any such war does break out between the US and China. 

India supporting the US in the event of a war between China and the US would be a massive game-changer in favor of the US. Also its in India's strategic interest for the US to successfully knock down the Chinese dragon a peg or 2 because by proxy it would mean greater regional hegemony for India in the wake of a Chinese defeat. 

This all sounds great, however the big sticking point for me on this arrangement would be the fact that the US is still a strong ally of Pakistan. The US is trying to have their cake and eat it to right now with respect to trying to be a strong ally of Pakistan and India simultaneously. 

What has Pakistan done for the US in recent history besides making the US look stupid by giving Bin Laden safe haven in there for country for so many years while the US was looking for him? 

The US **needs** India's help right now in dealing with China. We need to make sure we hold their feet to the fire for it and get the best deal possible, which includes the US ceasing to be an ally of Pakistan.

The US can't even trust Pakistan in the event of a war breaking out between Beijing and Washington, Islamabad, I think would either side with Beijing or remain neutral in the conflict.

As someone who is Indian, I can tell you that Gandhi was far from perfect. 

He was a pacifist to a fault. Furthermore, after India did get its freedom from England, the Gandhi political machine took it upon themselves to downplay and subsequently whitewash the actions taken by more violent Indian freedom fighters. 

In India today, the government textbooks want you to believe that freedom was achieved pretty much solely by Gandhi through nonviolent means. Omitting all of the freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh who killed British officers with a revolver, something that was forbidden for Indians to even carry in their own land under British law. 

Singh also detonated bombs inside the British Indian Parliament in New Delhi, things that I imagine gave the British added impetus to leave the subcontinent. 

For his sacrifices Bhagat Singh was hanged at the gallows, he was only 23 years old.

After India got its independence Gandhi and his central government and also successive governments attempted to omit Singh's sacrifices for the freedom of all Indians, even going as far as labeling him a terrorist, even though he was executed for fighting against a foreign, occupying force. 

Gandhi and his cohorts in the Indian central government greatly diminished Singh's legacy because they were worried that if Indians found out more about Singh's heroic acts, they would favor Singh more so than Gandhi. 

It's pretty despicable. 

It was only recently that other Indian freedom fighters have been given there due in India. Meanwhile every airport, post office and important road is named after the Gandhi family and the Gandhi family continues to greatly personally profit off of this great whitewashing of history.

*The then Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi had gone back on the pledge made to the people of Punjab on the floor of Parliament pertaining to the transfer of Chandigarh, he said.*

*“Nobody can deny that being the parent state, Punjab has the sole right over Chandigarh,” he added.*

Haryana and Rajasthan are not riparian states, so why are they getting so much free water from the Sutlej River? 

Nowhere else in the world do non-riparian states get free water without paying a royalty for it, other than in the case of Indian Punjab.

A bunch of Hindus in Delhi decide that its okay to take the water that has historically all belonged to Indian Punjab and its Sikh farmers. The majority religion of a country that touts itself as being a secular democracy, is taking the natural resources of a minority religion? 

Where do you not see what is wrong with this picture?

Of course all the brainwashed randian are going to downvote me for saying this, because they believe all the lies they read in their government approved history textbooks. You're going to tell me that Indira Gandhi was a benevolent Prime Minister who had to go lay down the law to those big, bad evil Sikhs, who by the way only made up 2% of the population. 

Nothing gives me more empathy for the people of Kashmir than the experiences my people had to go through dealing with the oppressive, Hindu central government. 

If you are not a Hindu in India, prepare yourself to be made aware of it by everyone who is Hindu, especially these days with the gau raksha thugs running rampant.  

Honestly, the one good thing that would come out of Kashmir getting independence is that it would create a ripple effect that I think would result in Punjab getting its own independence as well. 

At least then we could keep some of the water from the Satlej, instead of giving it all away to Haryana and Rajasthan and getting nothing in return for it.

Don't even get me started on this Satlej-Yamuna link bullshit either. 

Why don't you just turn Punjab into a desert while you're at it, this is nothing more than a concerted effort by Hindus to destroy the Sikh people. They're literally taking all the water from an agrarian economy based state, what else did they think would happen? ",2016-08-17 13:41:06+00:00,d6l3h70,1.0,t3_4y5a55,4320.0,india

Here is /r/india's sacred cow that you aren't allowed to discuss, the population problem has got as high as it is now largely because of poor Hindu Indians. Muslim population growth has been a concern since about 1990 onwards, but primarily its been poor Hindus. India has a large ""Bhaiya-problem"", and doesn't want to admit it. Outside of the agricultural sector, these bhaiya are unemployable. This isn't just a Uttar Pradesh or Bihar problem, but its largely those 2 states, also Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. 

Something is wrong with the culture of those 4 states. These 4 states Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh comprise what are known as the ""BIMARU states"". These 4 states have a combined population of approximately **460 million people**, what the actual fuck. 

That is not normal, the people in these 4 BIMARU states expect things for free from the central government because they are the 4 large vote bank states. The problem is, those free things these BIMARU states are getting, aren't coming from Delhi, they are being taken from other states by the central government, states that don't have population problems, states that actually produce things, and are given to the BIMARU states for far below market value. This in turn keeps people in the states in India that actually produce things, poor, or at least poorer than they should be. 

I'm talking about states like Punjab and Haryana, Rajasthan takes Punjab's water, and Uttar Pradesh and Bihar take Punjab and Haryana's wheat. The central government will always choose the vote bank of UP and Bihar over the people in the less populous states in India, because the vote bank is what keeps politicians in power. 

Good luck being an Indian politician and trying to address the Hindu population growth problem in UP and Bihar. I honestly don't see how the problem with poor Hindu's overbreeding can be remedied in a democracy when those same impoverished masses are the ones who have to vote you in.

It's a brutal quagmire. 

It just kills me to see the people in Indian states that don't have these kinds of population problems, be held hostage by the 4 BIMARU states. The 4 BIMARU states are largely what is keeping India poor.

My Maamaji has stories of seeing Sikh men being burned alive in Punjab. Hindus were pulling Sikhs off buses and setting them on fire. You couldn't even wear a pag around Hindus without fear of persecution. 

Left to their own devices these Hindu extremists could be worst than the Taliban.

Just last week Punjabi dairy farmers were being threatened and harassed by [Shiv Sena vigilantees.](http://www.india.com/news/india/gau-raksha-in-punjab-dairy-farmers-allegedly-harassed-by-shiv-sena-affiliated-cow-vigilantes-1377682/)

The majority of Hindus don't want India to be a secular nation, they want it to be Hindustan, the land of the Hindus. 

The Sikhs have contributed so much to India, but because we are a different religion and speak a different language we are always treated as 2nd class citizens. Until 2010 the 2nd [official language of Haryana was still Tamil.](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-punjabi-edges-out-tamil-in-haryana-1356124) Almost no one in Haryana speaks Tamil, and Punjabi-speaking Sikhs have historically made up 5-6% of Haryana's population. Tamil was chosen as the 2nd language of Haryana, solely as an offense to Sikhs. This [/r/india thread lays out how Tamil was made the 2nd language just to troll Sikhs.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/27ennw/til_that_until_2010_tamil_was_official_2nd_lang/) You'll also notice how many Randian in that thread think it was hilarious that Sikhs got institutionally discriminated against in Haryana by having their language marginalized. 

Also, until quite recently Haryana didn't recognize Sikh marriage ceremonies as being legal. Sikhs make up 5.5% of the population of Haryana, yet the state didn't recognize their marriages as being legal until 2013. In 2012 the [Anand Marriage Bill was passed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Karaj#The_Anand_Marriage_.28Amendment.29_Bill.2C_2012), and Haryana finally legally recognized Sikh marriage ceremonies. Before that, if you were Sikh and in Haryana and wanted to get married by your religions marital ceremony, you were forced to go to Punjab to have your wedding.

Can you fucking believe that bullshit? 

If you didn't have the financial means to go to Punjab to have your Sikh wedding, you were forced to have a Hindu wedding ceremony in Haryana for it to be legally recognized. This is whats known as religious based discrimination. 

Furthermore, US intel agencies even confirmed in their own private cables that they felt that the 1984 Anti-Sikh pogroms were in fact motivated by hatred and jealousy of the Sikhs. [According to a 2005 cable sent from the US embassy in New Delhi,](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/US-saw-Cong-hand-in-anti-Sikh-riots-reveal-Wiki-leaks/articleshow/8174019.cms?referral=PM) ""The US was convinced of the Congress government's hand in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and termed it as ""opportunism"" and ""hatred"" of the government against Sikhs.""

Sikhs have given so much to India, yet we are still treated with such disregard. Even now we are having more and more water taken from Punjab and given to the non-riparian states and getting nothing in return. Haryanvi farmers are now wealthier than Punjabi farmers and they are using Punjab's water to achieve that feat. Now the central government wants to take even more water and give it to Delhi. When does it end? 

Sikhs responsibly grow their population, the people in the states with the highest populations do not, Rajasthan has 76 million people, of course they never have enough water, at the rate they are growing their population they never will have enough water. 

You can't punish the people who are a demographic minority for responsibly growing their population and reward the people in Rajasthan for growing their population irresponsibly and having so many of their people lacking the basic necessities, like water. 

Why is it the Punjabi person's responsibility to subsidize the irresponsible lifestyle decisions of Rajasthanis? We didn't force them to have more kids than they can afford. So why should we give up our water? We aren't the ones having 4 kids on average per family. 

The issue of water-sharing and the Hindu-run central government trying to take away more and more of Punjab's water is what started the anti-Sikh pogroms. Indira Gandhi thought she could just come in and take away all of the water of Sikh farmers, who've been living and farming using the water from the Sutlej river for hundreds of years and she found out what happens. 

Don't think that since we are so few that Sikhs will be so easily defeated and have their water taken away from them. There is no special talent in doing what the Hindus have done the last 50 years and increasing your population 4-fold. The reason Sikhs haven't done it is because we actually value Sikh life and raise our people well. We don't believe in having hundreds of millions of impoverished Sikhs just for the sake of their being one more Sikh voter, like Hindus do. 

If Hindus want to make things right with Punjab and Sikhs, then they have to remedy the original problem, the inequitable sharing of water from the Sutlej river. All over the world non-riparian states pay for the water they get from riparian states, except in the case of Punjab, where the water is taken from Punjab for the non-riparian states of Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan. 

If the Hindu central government wants to order the military to take away Punjab's river water, then they can come and take it, just don't be surprised if there's blood in the water.

I don't think anyone thinks Bihar and its tens of millions of economic migrants are a sign of India's evolution and progress, if anything it states the opposite.

If Bihar had the means to sustain a population of 100 million people, which they clearly do not, these people wouldn't be going to other people's states and becoming burdens upon them. 

Evolution and progress, what bullshit.

Rampant, unmitigated population growth that you have no way to provide a decent standard of living to, is most certainly not a sign of evolution or progress. 

No sociologist would agree with your statement. 

These Biharis are destroying India's unique cultures and there is no way you can place primacy of one culture over another culture.

The only thing that Bihari culture has contributed to India is the most impoverished people, second only to Uttar Pradesh, this isn't something that we should be celebrating or congratulating them for.

The amount of shit that the Punjabi people had to go through to preserve their language and heritage and its being completely diluted by an annual influx of Hindi speaking, Bihari migrant workers who want to shift to Punjab permanently. 

Can't we have just 1 state in India that is Punjabi speaking and has a Sikh majority? 

Is that to much to ask for? 

Punjabi should be the first language of Punjab, and if Bihari migrants want to continue shifting to Punjab they should speak Punjabi. It's not like Punjabi and Hindi are wildly different languages from one another. We're not talking about Hindi and Telugu here. Punjabi and Hindi are similar, I don't think it would be asking to much to ask the Bihari bhaiya to speak Punjabi as they continue flooding into Punjab. 

There are 28 million people in Punjab, of which 3 million are Hindi-speaking Bihari bhaiya and it only looks like its going to keep going up. 

If these Biharis aren't even going to *try* to assimilate to Punjab's language and culture, they are indirectly destroying the unique language and culture of Punjab. 

Punjab isn't alone either, Raj Thackray made big news when he complained about the influx of Biharis in Mumbai and its negative effect on Marathi cinema, language and culture. 

I guess you could call it the Bhojpurization of India's non-Hindi speaking states, and its completely fucked up.

507,"So you ignore all my questions and pick apart my statement. Here is the central crux of my statement, what incentives has the central government given Punjab to share its water with these non-riparian states for free? 

You want to bitch about population, who told Rajasthan to have 75 million fucking people? Rajasthan has the population of a **country**, then they complain they magically don't have enough water. This is the definition of rewarding bad behavior, if Rajasthan doesn't have enough water for its 75 million+ people, maybe they shouldn't have allowed the population to get so high.

The central government is punishing Punjab for responsibly growing its population and rewarding Rajasthan for its unbridled population growth, its the height of stupidity. 

By your logic, giving out natural resources based on population would be an absolute disaster, the states that produce nothing would get the majority of India's natural resources.

This is why India will never truly succeed as a nation. You are punishing the very people who are acting responsibly in terms of growing their population. A handful of states are holding the rest of India hostage by growing their population so rapidly that it is taking a toll on the development of the other states that didn't grow their population by orders of magnitude since 1950. 

Punjab has a healthy replacement rate, so does Haryana, but until Rajasthanis can prove that they can responsibly grow their population, they shouldn't get any additional water.

Why should a Punjabi farmer with 2 kids have to sow his crops with less water than he needs to, because the central government has decided that the Punjabi farmer with 2 kids has to subsidize the lifestyle of the Rajasthani who chose to have 8 kids for no good reason other than he didn't responsibly plan his family.

Those 8 kids that that Rajasthani had, shouldn't be a burden to Punjab and the central government has no right to impose that burden upon Punjab. ",2016-07-08 18:01:09+00:00,d54jp92,3.0,t1_d54g2fd,4588.0,india

Nothing is free in this world, except for apparently, water from Punjab.

Indians just keep expecting the water to keep flowing for free without having to pay anything in return. 

Everyone on this sub loves to talk shit about Punjab, oh the drugs etc. etc., but when you bring up the fact that Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana have been stealing Punjab's water without giving Punjab an iota of compensation, they all get very defensive and start downvoting your post without leaving a comment.

Indians won't be happy until Punjab is a desert. 

Tell me, what incentives do Punjabis have for giving more and more of our water to non-riparian states? What do we get in return? Sikhs are still awaiting justice all these years later for Anti-Sikh Riots of 1984. Our holiest site was attacked for asking for equitable treatment for Punjabis. 

All the central government wants to do is ruin Punjab, they always place preference on Hindu Haryanvi farmers and fuck over Sikh Punjabi farmers, always. Not even taking into account that it is only because of Punjab's water that Haryana even has bountiful harvests, no water from Punjab, no crops in Haryana, its as simple as that, and stil the central government always places preference on the Hindu Haryanvis over the Sikh Punjabis. 

This should be a case study in religious based discrimination. 

I plan on writing a policy paper about the institutionalized discrimination that Sikh farmers face in India for my doctoral thesis, because the world needs to know how Delhi has been systematically looting Punjab's natural resources whilst also discriminating against the minority Sikh farmer population and giving every opportunity to Haryana's Hindu farmers with Punjab's water.

Just look at [Sukhna Lake.](http://image3.mouthshut.com/images/Restaurant/Photo/-42515_10677.jpg) If this lake were in any other Indian city, the water would be poop brown and you would see dozens of men squatting along the banks of the lake to add to the dysentery problem. 

I really don't want to beat up on other cities here, but one of the things that pisses me off the most about Indians is that we shit where we eat. In that we poop in our water supply. 

I'm not trying to make a designated shitting area post here, but easy access to toilets is something that is desperately underfunded throughout cities in India. Just look at this list of Indian states and Union Territories [ranked by access to toilets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_and_union_territories_ranked_by_availability_of_toilets), 85% of the population of Chandigarh has a flush toilet and 5% have a pit toilet or some other type of toilet. So its no coincidence that Chandigarh also happens to be the cleanest, nicest city in India. 

Furthermore, my Masi lives in Chandigarh and the majority of my family lives in Ludhiana, and I spend most of my time in the Ludhiana area when I'm in India, but I enjoy my limited amount of time in Chandigarh much more than my native Ludhiana area.

Luckily my grandmother saw through it all and we got the registry business taken care of and everything is safely out of his hands now. 

There were other members of the family openly speculating if my Thaya was willing to kill my grandmother and make it look like an accident before she went ahead and got the registry's put in my name. 

Had he done something like that before my grandmother got the registry put in my name, my dad's share of the property which was in my grandma's name, would've been split up 3 ways equally between myself, my Thaya and my Bhua.

""*Earlier, while in Punjab, Mr Kejriwal had said the state does not have a single drop of water to spare (for Haryana), but later, in an affidavit in the Supreme Court on April 4, his government supported Haryana's stand on completing the SYL canal.*""

As much as I hate to say it, Badal has a very good point here. Kejriwal is doing his best to make the Punjab election all about the drug menace, which is admittedly a blight upon the state. He is also doing his best to remain as ambiguous as possible on the SYL river linking scheme, he says 1 thing in Punjab, **and then actually goes ahead and does something completely contradictory in Dehli.**

Actions speak louder than words.

If he plans on fucking over Punjab by rerouting the Sutlej and stealing Punjab's water because Dehli is terribly overpopulated and industrialized completely irresponsibly, then he needs to come out and say that. 

Kejriwal keeps going on and on about the plight of Punjabi farmers under Badal, meanwhile he's filing affidavits in Dehli High Court to take away those same Punjabi farmers.

This is political lying of the grandest scale. 

River-linking is not natural, I can't wait to see how much theft and corruption will take place on these canal work sites, they are going to ruin the Sutlej and the Yamuna.

Isn't this something that we are always harping on and on about here in /r/india, India's population problem. So, the solution to India's population problem shouldn't be to punish the people who engage in responsible family planning by taking away their water, to reward people in India with states that have much higher populations than Punjab. 

India's population is expected to level off around 2030, at somewhere between 1.5 and 1.7 billion people, that is absolutely ridiculous and completely unsustainable. India's population growth has been unsustainable for the last 60 years, and because of that, now Delhi is going to have to take away Punjab's water, its really as simple as that.

If you're at the point where you have to *reroute rivers* because you have to increase the area of arable land to account for increased population, well, you just might have a population problem.

I can't believe that when all these MP's are sitting around, essentially redrawing the map of India by linking these rivers, that no one brings up the population problem. 

The biggest hurdle in curtailing the population are vote bank politicians, like Mayawati for example, who uses India's impoverished masses as her vote bank to flex her muscle in Parliament. She certainly isn't going to put forth any legislation that would do anything to decrease the size of her vote bank, now is she? 

The BJP is probably not ideally cut out to handle this problem unfortunately as they are heavily involved in vote-bank politics. 

IMHO however, no one is more at fault for India's population problem as the Congress. They were in power for decades as India's population doubled, then tripled, from what it was in 1947. The IMF began warning in the 70's that we had a burgeoning population crisis then, 40 years ago. 

Congress had ample opportunity to teach poor Indians in the BIMARU states family planning, yet they didn't. The most impoverished Indians were and continue to be the ones having the most kids. How could any statesmen not see this as potentially being a massive problem?

Joe Rogan is a markedly better stand up comedian than Jim Norton for a variety of reasons. Joe has more to talk about, he has lead a far more interesting life than Jim Norton and thereby has much more source material.

It's not 2012 anymore and being into trannies is not nearly as shocking as it once was, especially in a post-Bruce Jenner world.

Iran is a much more important partner for India, because we need their oil, and this deal very clearly underlines the importance of Iranian oil in the present and near term future if India is going to become a global power. 

There were a lot of people in the comments section of that self post talking about their feelings about Israel and all of the human rights violations of the Palestinians, and why that should play a role in who we should value more as an ally, Israel or Iran. 

I'm not talking about that though, I'm talking about real politick here, and Iran is simply more important to India than Israel because of their oil and nothing Israel can do will change that. 

IMHO the best thing Israel can do for India would be to share their water recycling technology that is the best in the world. Israel has a water recycling program that is top notch, and they can do a lot to get in India's good graces by sharing that technology, especially with the drought in India right now. 

However, I still don't think that would even be enough to overtake Iran as India's chief ally in the Middle East and this Chabahar Port deal will do a lot to further bolster the relationship between India and Iran.

FTA:

“**A river isn’t a pipe that we can control.**”
— **Dr Latha Anantha, director, River Research Centre**
*Firstly, there is no concept of deficit and surplus. That’s what we are making it to be. A river has a natural course and for years it has been following that. Who are we to say it has a surplus and it has a deficit? The river will carry as much as it can. Secondly, a river isn’t a pipe that we can control. You can’t compare a Ganga to another. It has different characteristics. And when you build a canal to flow the water that is diverted, you are displacing far too many human lives and the eco-system. For instance, in the Ken-Betwa project, the core area of the Panna national park will be affected. The government, wanting to do the project for political reasons without any sort of clearances, is basically, redrawing the entire geography of the country. Even if there is a surplus and flood, every river needs that. Thats how the natural ecosystem works. You can’t block it.*


“**There is no scientific basis for this**”
— **Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator, South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People**
*How do you conclude that river-linking project will be good? There have been no scientific basis to say that. All you have is an incomplete study that says this is good for the country. One has to exhaust all options and potentials before concluding that river-linking is the best alternative. Exhaust options such as watershed development, rainwater harvesting, ground water recharge, optimising existing infrastructure and cropping methods and then we can conclude that water-linking might be good. But there has been no assessments done. For instance, look at Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. The Marathwada region in Maharashtra is the worst drought-hit state in India today, and belongs to the Godavari basin. But at the same time, you want to divert water from Godavari to Krishna. It doesn’t make sense. There has to be assessment done because there is huge impact on the nature.*


“**Horrifying and ill-planned.**”
— **Medha Patkar, national convener, National Alliance of People’s Movement**
*This entire push for the river-linking is horrifying and is ill-planned. The hydrology of the rivers are changing and we are ignoring the cultural and ecological significance. Even the cost that the government is talking about, of Rs5.6 lakh crore ($85 billion) is based on old reports. Now the cost would be much more and would at least be Rs10 lakh crore. The bigger question is, who is going to fund this? Is the private sector going to do that? And if they do, they will only have interest in the land. The other thing is, there is no social impact assessment done on the livelihood of the people who are living in these areas. They don’t even engage the gram sabhas while taking decisions.*


“**River-linking is a social evil, economic evil**”
— **V. Rajamani, professor emeritus, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi**
*The interest in river-linking now is due to the big bucks involved in it for dam builders. A canal is not a river and it cannot support an ecosystem. What happens to everything that is living in the river? When water flows, there are a number of factors associated with it. There are micro organisms and there are marine life. We are taking away all of that by building dams and diverting water for something that is not even natural. When you build dams, you are displacing too many people. What will they do? They land up in slums in cities. River-linking is a social evil, economic evil and will ultimately lead to collapse of civilisation.*


“**These projects are not viable.**”
— **Sushmita Sengupta, deputy programme manager, Centre for Science and Environment**
*The basic concept of linking of rivers in India is to transfer water from where there is a surplus to a place where there is a deficit. But when such transfer of water takes place, there is a significant community displacement that happens along with it.
Another major issue in India vis-a-vis river-linking is that water is a state subject. Now states that have surplus water are not ready to give it to other states and there is a huge logjam which is cropping up time and again because of this. Even though the government is thinking of intra-state river-linking processes—where a river of a state is connected to another on in the same state—the environmental issues relating to these projects are very huge.
There is a big problem of desilting and there is no clarity on where the silt be actually dumped. Will it be somebody’s farm and will the farmers be affected or not? The government has not come clear on any of those points. So considering these environmental and community issues, overall I don’t think these projects are really viable.*",2016-05-16 11:35:23+00:00,d37d1lq,1.0,t3_4jk88d,11074.0,india

*Rajasthan has the highest proportion (2.7 million) of people represented by each MP, followed by Bihar (2.6 million), and UP and MP at 2.5 million each, which is also the average of the Gangetic belt.*

There are several reasons that this won't work. For one thing why the hell has the environment ministry approved 1.29 million hectares of forest land to be used by corporations for non-forestry purposes since 1980? If forest cover is so important then why are you taking perfectly natural forests and handing them over to corporations, largely for mining purposes? 

This is such complete and utter bullshit I can't even believe it. 

Where the hell is all this land going to come from to create these new forests, which are also probably going to suck by the way. They are not going to be an adequate replacement for the natural forests that were turned over to corporations for mining.

FTA: 

In a report (pdf) in 2013, India’s comptroller and auditor general (CAG) had made a scathing assessment of the environment ministry’s failure to grow forests on alternative land, even as it diverted forests areas for infrastructure projects.

In the report, the auditor had said:

*We noticed serious shortcomings in regulatory issues related to diversion of forest land, the abject failure to promote compensatory afforestation, the unauthorised diversion of forest land in the case of mining and the attendant violation of the environmental regime. To be able to undertake compensatory afforestation on equivalent area of non-forest land, such land needs to be received by the Government. The Ministry’s records revealed that against the receivable non-forest land of 1,03,381.91 hectare, 28,086 hectare was received during the period 2006-12 which constituted only 27% of receivable non-forest land. The compensatory afforestation done over the non-forest land received was an abysmal 7,280.84 hectare constituting 7% of the land which ought to have been received.*

“*There is no clarity on how the government will develop these new forests,*” added Ramamurthi. *“Are you going to throw away people from their land to develop new forests? If so, why did you allow forests to be depleted in the first case? This is a kind of double whammy.*”",2016-05-05 13:22:55+00:00,d2tqvn6,1.0,t3_4hzic1,6196.0,india

It's because we don't have the right people participating. Milkha Singh is 100% right about needing underprivileged youths to be a part of India's sports. Historically it's always the people that are lower on the socio-economic ladder that become great athletes, the examples are innumerable. 

Now kids that come from the opposite situation, that is to say, a reliable, well off economic background, well you practically don't hear about any great athletes with that kind of background.

Just look at Brazil's World Cup team, the majority of their players grew up in favelas or slums in Brazil, comparable to slums we have in any major Indian city. No one on Brazil's World Cup team comes from money or a rich or well to do family. That's not the way it works.

It's a vicious cycle, and mass pandemics aside, I see no feasible way of India decreasing its population in the next 50 years.

Once Angela Merkel commented on it and it became front page news, the mods over at /r/worldnews couldn't censor the story any longer.

Many Redditors have hypothesized that the reason the articles were removed was because they portrayed the refugees that have recently come to Germany, negatively.

Because the attackers were a racial minority, in this instance North Africans, the mods at /r/worldnews didn't want to marginalize and them and in turn effectively exercised their ability to censor the article out of view of the Reddit worldnews community.

901,"There's a vein of lithium in the Hindu Kush mountain range that is currently valued at being worth more than $1 trillion and that's before everyone in the developed world switches over to a hybrid car with a lithium battery. 

If we don't stay there, there's a chance that China or India could go in, strike deals with the regime in power, and begin extracting natural resources from Afghanistan, chiefly lithium and other rare Earth minerals. 

Going even further back, England and Russia played what historians refer to as the [Great Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game) for control of central Asia, mainly Afghanistan. 

The Great Game went on between Russia and Britain until the latter gave up its empire, mainly India, in 1947. See India was the launching pad for several unsuccessful British campaigns into Afghanistan in the 19th century. 

The Soviet Union, famously got mired in a quagmire in Afghanistan as recently as 1979-1988 Soviet-Afghan War. Aside from its natural resources, which were only discovered in the 80's, Afghanistan geological position makes it an incredibly important country to have control over. 

Look at it this way, the person who controls Afghanistan and has their military stationed there, theoretically controls all of Central Asia, that means Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan etc. 

People involved in US think tanks and US defensive agencies have postulated that if a nation such as Russia or China could get control over Afghanistan they could theoretically consolidate control over the entire Central Asian region, and with the amount of mineral wealth in that region, develop China or Russia into a nation that has regional economic/military hegemony and could thereby rival the United States.

People in the alternative media have iterated that the US/NATO-led War on Terror is just the latest manifestation of the British Empire trying to conquer Afghanistan before the Russians can do it. Except for instead of the British Empire, today its the Anglo-American Empire led by the United States.

It's amazing how terrible things like that shooting draw you closer to culture though, I remember how horrible I felt for the families involved, like they could have been friends of my parents, aunties and uncles you know. 

I'm happy your grandparents were safe, I bet they took the car not working that Sunday morning as a message from God that they were supposed to live through that shooting. 

In any case, I'm sure you also noticed the significant drop off in media coverage after the press found out the identity of the shooter and found out he was indeed a military veteran. I couldn't help but think: ""Gee what happened to all the reporters?""

907,"My parents are Sikh and I was raised in a Sikh household, though I do not identify as one anymore and haven't since I'd say my mid teenage years, I identify as an atheist/agnostic now.

I was raised in America, have no accent, no turban, no long beard, just a trimmed goatee, I dress like your typical American and for all intents and purposes am as American as apple pie. 

Even I've been called sandnigger 4 times since 9/11, each time from some fucking coward in a passing pickup truck or car. 

I can't imagine what its like for someone who actually is a religious Sikh with the turban and the whole 9 yards. It must be tough, I mean, I'm pretty assimilated and even I have to deal with racism, what must it be like for them. 

Furthermore, [there have been a spate of hate crimes and attacks against Sikhs since 9/11.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/07/history-of-hate-crimes-against-sikhs-since-911_n_1751841.html) Sikhs are an overwhelmingly peaceful group of people, who don't have a history of religious extremism, they don't proselytize either. 

There was even a mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Oaks, Wisconsin in the summer of 2012 that was gaining a lot of attention in the media, that is until the media found out that the mass shooter was an Iraq war veteran, goodbye front page, say hello to the underside of the rug. 

That's what happened to the Sikhs in America, they were at their place of worship, minding their own business, exercising their 1st amendment rights to practice their own religion of choosing, and some gung ho Army vet came into their temple and started executing people. 6 of them in total. 

Media finds out the shooter is a veteran, and we certainly can't portray them negatively, so the story is effectively ignored. It was a hate crime and a mass shooting wrapped in 1, but most people didn't hear about it because the shooter was a military veteran of an unpopular war, and the victims wore turbans, had funny names and look vaguely similar to the people we are busy finding reasons to bomb, halfway around the world.

Now in the last 20-30 minutes it is down to just 69% upvoted, its such bullshit. 

The post just goes to show how much programming that all of you are having done to your minds by the mainstream media. 

This is coming from Motherjones, not from Breitbart or FoxNews, Motherjones is a liberal publication. 

The only thing my fellow liberals are doing by trumpeting what the mainstream media is telling you about mass shootings is taking away your own rights. 

Please, please, I implore my fellow liberals to look at both sides of this debate and NOT get trapped into the highly divisive identity politics that surround this issue. 

You have to look past all of the racial and cultural differences that the mainstream media tries to rile up around the issue of gun control and look at it from an objective point of view.

If you support laws that strip away the rights of law abiding citizens to own guns, you are not for gun control, you are simply for gun confiscation from the hands of the citizen and guns for the government. 

All you are supporting is the government having a monopoly on violence. 

A law abiding citizen who owns a gun should be allowed to defend himself if in danger, all this nanny state stuff coming from the liberals on this issue is so disheartening. 

Here's the secret fellow liberals, when the shit hits the fan there simply aren't enough cops/government officials/military/emergency aid workers  to assist or protect everyone. If you think the cops are going to always be there to protect you as soon you call them you are wrong. When the shit really does hit the fan, the cops will be off defending the rich and well to do communities, leaving the poor to fend for themselves. 

[Look at what happened during the LA riots in 1992.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots#Korean-Americans_during_the_riots) Korean store owners had to defend their neighborhood during the riots because the LAPD was busy flanking the rich parts of the city, like Beverly Hills and Hollywood Hills.

1. World population chart of Eurasia and Africa in the lower center. World population and demography will finally be brought about at the UN and therefore become mainstream news and water cooler conversation everywhere. Incredibly interesting to say the very least.

2. Upper center, chart of US bonds, very important election in November, look for a financial crisis beginning in the bond market. Remember the financial crisis in 2008? It'll be a similar formula. Janet Yellen, head of the Fed, is also prominently featured on the cover, I think it ties in with the bond chart. 

3. Bill and Hillary both prominently featured on cover leads me to believe that Hillary will win the election. Say hello to President Clinton part II I suppose.

4. Obama being square between the heads of state of Japan and China leads me to believe that Obama / America will do something to keep those 2 countries from going to war in 2016. Which will seriously piss off China. Abe, from Japan, is smiling whereas Obama and China's president are frowning. So I think Japan comes off good and keeps control of those islands in the South China Sea that Japan and China both want so badly.

5. In the lower right, you see a businessman with goat legs and goat horns looking like the devil. Expect popular opinion to be critical of bankers and businessmen in 2016.

6. In the upper right you see a picture of a man possibly a protester holding an Albanian flag. Maybe that could mean in 2016 there could be a color revolution in Albania for some reason. 

7. Narendra Modi the Prime Minister of India and Vladimir Putin are seen next to each other smiling. Maybe this could mean that something significant happens between both countries that year that is positive. Possibly a UN vote or something of that nature.
