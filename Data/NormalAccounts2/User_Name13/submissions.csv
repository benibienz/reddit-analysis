I think this is going to be the extent of DNC leaks coverage today from the MSM. They are literally going to ignore the contents of the leaked files, and focus on what *might be the source* of said files. 

This is shameless, even for the MSM. To ignore such blatant corruption of the Democratic process from the purported overseers of the process, the DNC, and try to spin it into a hit piece on someone who's already public enemy #1, Putin. 

Like I said, this is shameless, even by the MSM's standards. 

Tomorrow the headlines will be all about how evil Putin, forced the noble head of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman Shultz to resign. 

How naive can people be to swallow this shit up wholesale? 

Sorry for the rant, this just really grinds my gears. 

Sanders, even with the **entire establishment** against him, still managed to win 22 states. He would've definitely won the nomination if they were playing on an even playing field.

[Here is a short clip from the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64zYT6r-FJE#t=19s). 

They go on to interview an official for the state in the episode who says that he predicts that it will take approximately 25 - 50 years for the street children problem in Kolkata to improve. That's an insanely long amount of time. What makes the problem much worst is that most of the kids are addicted to huffing glue and spend their entire days collecting plastic bottles that people throw away from the side of trains, just to support their glue-huffing habit.

I would recommend seeing it, it's a tough watch, but its worth it.

You hear a lot about the drug problem in Punjab, but you don't hear anything about this epidemic of homeless children in Kolkata as young as 7 or 8 getting addicted to huffing glue. 

The correspondent for Vice even comments toward the end of the piece on how he hadn't seen a single kid living alongside the tracks that was older than 14.

The street children problem in India is insane, but for some reason, maybe cause of the drug problem, it seems worst in Kolkata. [According to various studies, there were approximately 100,000 street children in Kolkata and Mumbai each](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_children_in_India#Number) **in the late 1980's**. That number must be a lot higher now. 

Anyways, sorry for the rant, but this seems like a problem that goes unnoticed.
