I'm Vecet and i'm a Caster for the League of Legends amateur scene in Brazil, also a content creator for a lot of games mostly MOBA's. To make it clear i'm not on the Beta for Overwatch but i've been watching a lot and talking to a lot of friends who are playing the game a lot, and i've been gathering feedback and taking notes on many topics to post it here. I hope to make my self clear on my opinions but i can make some mistakes since english is not my first language, feel free to correct me and i'll edit the post. Let's get started!

 &amp;nbsp;

**Spectate**

 &amp;nbsp;

* The competitive scene will depend on how delightful the game is to the Viewers, right now it's kinda messy, there is too much going on at the same time on the screen, i would recommend an option to make effects less fancy, also would be nice to have a mini-map on the righ botton corner of the screen soo people can see the overall of the match to try to figure out what is happening.
 
* I also suggest changing the Character's icon positions on the screen, make something like this one [Click Here](http://i.imgur.com/S1YVurX.jpg) Also its not really necessary to have the shortcuts to each Hero displayed on screen, or at least give an option to hide it.

* Let us have a option to hover the mouse on a hero portrait or just a quick access menu to look up some statistics, believe me, for the caster's that a huge help.

* Give the ability while on Spectate to see throught walls, just outline the caracter's soo the caster and the viewers can get a better experience.

* One thing that everyone says that is missing and i totally agree is the Kill Feed, this game need a Kill Feed asap. Would be great to have a warning on screen for the spectate when a player change it's Hero.

* A cool extra would be the ability to synchronize both caster and commentator cameras, soo when making online tournments they can have a better understanding about what is being transmited to the Viewers.

* Another change focused to the Esports side of things would be change the some of the announcements to the *Double, Tripe, Quadra, MultiKill* system, that would help the caster's to Hype the plays happening on the screen.

About the way the spectate handles the camera system;
 &amp;nbsp;

* When the match starts a quick automatically introduction would be cool: Showing some of the objectives and then going back to the team bases.
* Give the caster some cameras preset and shortcuts for it. That way the can quickly navigate through the map instead of flying all the way to where they want to be.
* A little delay on the spectate would be cool soo the client can define some interesting plays to quick move the camera and show to the Viewers.

 &amp;nbsp;

**Game itself:**

 &amp;nbsp;

* Hability to save Match Replays is a must.
* Auto-save or a button to save the Play of the Match, will help a lot of content creator's and a lot of pp who want to show their best plays to the friends.
* Let people select what Voice chat they want, like only talk with their party member's.
* I dont know if this one is in the game yet, but make possible to people can report toxic players.
* The card system is not rewarding to people voting but arent in the cards, with time a lot of people will just leave it there and not vote at all.
* The Ragdoll system used when Heros die seems a little off. Dont know how to explain that.
* This game will need Events based on Lore update to keep it alive, that's some i want to see Blizzard invest a lot!
* Dont know if it's possible already but make possible to people select the language they want to play the game. Also please keep the same character names in every region. Change names will make Viewers confused if they want to watch some tournment on another region.
* If Blizzard really wants to experiment a lot of gamemode variants, please make a truly custom mode, where people have a lot of variables to set and make some unique matches.

 &amp;nbsp;

I hope my feedback will be of some use, i may have made some mistakes since i'm not in the beta but i do want to help to make a better experience for the player's and a great Esports.
