2,That's pretty much exactly how we do it :) Culling just a few times a year and removing those who have been inactive for months and who have clearly lost interest in the network.,2016-11-22 01:37:59+00:00,daadifg,2.0,t1_daaafys,4418.0,ImaginaryNetwork
3,"Hi /u/Myrandall! From what I've read from your other comments here your main issue seems to be inconsistency with the ""rule"" and actual practice. Notice that they are actually listed as ""expectations"", not  ""rules"". Here are the two relevant lines we have listed about the expectation you are questioning: 

&gt;[Make at least one submission per week to each sub that you moderate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork/wiki/tldr) (from TL;DR page for new mods)

#

&gt;[A Junior Mod is required to post at least once per week in each subreddit they moderate that has less than 10,000 subscribers, and comment at least once a week in each sub they moderate that has greater than 10,000 subscribers; posting is strongly encouraged regardless.](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarynetwork/wiki/newmod) (from JR Mod description)

Nowhere does it say that failure to maintain this expectation results in termination right away. It is listed as an expectation because we expect a new mod to contribute and take part in the community. When it's clear that they aren't doing that, they are removed. This is done on a case by case basis and sometimes there are months of inactivity before we are certain they probably won't be coming back (users with longer history in the INE), or they are removed more promptly (newer mods who never really contributed much to begin with). Due to the case by case basis of mod removals, no official practice is written out about it. 

At the end of the day we're here as volunteers to contribute to this massive collection of art subs. If one of those volunteers loses interest it becomes pretty obvious and they'll be removed in due time with no harsh feelings and welcomed back if they regain interest. As long as someone is posting and clearly still interested in the network we have no desire to remove them from it, even if they fall a bit short of the expectations. 

If you see someone not meeting their [mod expectations](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarynetwork/wiki/newmod#wiki_mod_positions.3A) you can let the Lead Mod or a Senior Mod/Network Manager know and we will look into it! ",2016-11-22 01:34:14+00:00,daadccw,1.0,t3_5e44hk,41966.0,ImaginaryNetwork

182,"&gt; so pretty much nothing in this image makes sense.

Unless you understand the context of this picture. It's used in-game in Halo 5 as artwork for the achievement you get when you complete the game solo on legendary difficulty. So makes complete sense that it depicts Chief taking on hundreds of elites solo since that represents the difficulty of beating the campaign solo on legendary. 

As to the gun he's using - it's concept art where the artist has artistic freedom to draw whatever he wants. And to your complaints about the perspective - that's your opinion and I disagree. Obviously 343 Studios also disagrees seeing as they used this in their game :P",2016-11-08 20:40:06+00:00,d9rlng3,2.0,t1_d9rk9rt,1587.0,halo

&gt;The Lumeris are a society that revolves around trade, economic deals, economic growth, and doing business. Expansion and acquisition are the bywords of their culture, and as an amphibious people they are prepared to make money in any environment.

&gt;Their society is organized around a series of families that have traditionally run different parts of their economy, and the balance of power and negotiations between the families is what drives progress - or blocks it.

310,"&gt;why Fallout universe never visited the moon?

In Fallout 3 one of the main quests involves retrieving [the satellite dish from the Virgo II Lunar Lander.](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Virgo_II_dish) It was known as Valiant 11 and is Fallout's equivalent to Apollo 11. More info from the wiki:

&gt;Valiant 11 is the name of the Virgo II Moon landing mission's lunar lander. It was used in the first manned lunar landing mission, and made contact with the lunar surface on July 16, 1969. The crew of this United States Space Agency spacecraft consisted of Captain Richard Wade, Captain Mark Garris, and Captain Michael Hagen. These American astronauts became the first humans to walk on a celestial body other than Earth. On November 14, 1969, the Virgo III Lander Valiant 12 also landed on the Moon.

We're for artwork and illustrations from the Witcher series, and while there is someof that on your folders, we also require artist credit and for any artwork to be posted from the original source.

Well people can find the other rules that are actually broken just as easily, so that point doesn't explain anything :p

The point is to make the rules that are actually being broken more visible and clearer.

661,"Replacing the image of rule with actual text is a no-brainer, I'm definitely all for that. This allows users who browse with CSS disabled or who browse from mobile the ability to see sidebar rules. Only reason it wasn't done earlier was because of the previous sidebar character limit where we had to save space by using a link to an image instead of actual text. Since it's been increased we have plenty of space for sidebar text.

Having so many rules in the sidebar might cause users to feel overwhelmed and/or not bother reading them all. Not to mention many of them are very rarely used or are just plain obvious. Including the rules most frequently enforced lets users quickly see the main reasons why their post might get removed. 

The rules most frequently broken in my experience are: rehosted content, no artist credit/wrongly credited artist, and 3 month/top 100 reposts. The only adjustment I'd make to this proposal is adding the no repost rule as well in the sidebar, that way the main things for users to be aware of are all there. 

All the other rules are fine being on the wiki since they are either rarely broken or just obvious rules. ""No URL shorteners"": Very rarely see this rule broken, in fact I can't remember if I've ever removed something for this reason. ""NSFW must be marked"": obvious rule, this is standard across all of reddit. ""This is a curated forum"": obvious, that is the job of moderators - to make sure everything is relevant and appropriate. 

So yeah maybe just throw in the no repost rule in the sidebar since posts are frequently removed for this, and then all the big ones are covered, and the resulting sidebar is far less cluttered and much more concise.

Edit: The revision addressed my one suggestion, which others mentioned as well (keeping the no reposts rule in the sidebar). As is this proposal is good to go for me :)",2016-10-12 00:45:24+00:00,d8o4zys,1.0,t3_56mu4q,203692.0,ImaginaryNetwork

813,"We've received this request before and I am not against it, just need to implement it and get others on board. Here's an explanation of what it would take:

Post filters work by adding flairs to posts. The ""filter"" is just a link to a search of the sub for all posts with that flair. We currently have 6 spoiler flairs for the books (one for each book up to TWOW), and 6 flairs for each season of the show. Also theres the ""No Spoilers"" and ""All Spoilers"" flair. So that's 14 flairs that we commonly use. To implement a filter we would have to make a second version of all those flairs, adding the tag [Show] to one and [Book] to the other (or something to note which type of art it is). So then there would be 28 flairs. That would be way too confusing for users so it would fall on us mods to assign them. Something I would be okay with but that I'd need to talk over with others to make sure we're all on board.

Lastly, all the content from this sub would still appear on your aggregated front page. The filtering option is only available when visiting the sub itself and clicking your desired filter (books/show). This preference doesnt save itself everytime you visit the sub. So if this does get implemented that's how it would work. 

I'll talk it over with the other mods here and post an update on where we're at with this. Thanks for starting the discussion again, I think it would be a great feature if it can be done properly. ",2016-10-03 04:37:22+00:00,d8brage,1.0,t3_55ke4a,25369.0,ImaginaryWesteros

906,"From Ned - chapter 35, page 923:

&gt;“He saw them cut the legs from Jory’s mount and drag him to the earth, swords rising and falling as they closed in around him.”

...

&gt;“Littlefinger and the City Watch found him there in the street, cradling Jory Cassel’s body in his arms.”

And from the wiki to sum it up:

&gt;Jory and Lord Eddard to a brothel to find one of Robert's bastards. On the return trip to the Red Keep, he is slain in the streets of King's Landing, by House Lannister guards under orders from Ser Jaime Lannister, to serve as a lesson to Eddard, after Jaime learns of the abduction of his brother, Tyrion Lannister, by Eddard's wife, Catelyn Stark.

Book doesn't go into much detail on him dying, just that the Lannister guards closed in around him and killed him. The artwork is depicting the scene where Ned cradles his dead body which is pretty accurate to the text.

1157,"Good PSA! I want to add something about the significance of approving and upvoting new posts. The majority of our subscribers don't actually visit our subs to browse. Rather, they see the content when it reaches their front page. For a post  to make it to their front page it needs to become a ""rising post"". The way a post begins to rise is to get an initial boost in upvotes immediately after it is posted. Best way to get that started is to leave it unapproved so it will be quickly seen by another mod who can give it that important first upvote while the post is still fresh. If you approve your own post right after posting it will likely go unnoticed and dwindle with little attention since it never made it to anyone's front page.

tl;dr Upvote everything you approve, it greatly helps the post make it to the front pages of those subscribed. Let others approve your posts for you, it means the post will get the first upvote it needs to make it's way to the front page of the subscribers.",2016-09-17 07:03:01+00:00,d7qb7ki,1.0,t3_533u0g,39407.0,ImaginaryNetwork

If there's a sub you like a lot or find yourself already posting to regularly you're welcome to be added as a moderator. Really the only thing you'd have to do other than at least one post a week (which you do already) is approve/remove posts in accordance with the rules in the sidebar (not a heavy load of posts to deal with if you're just modding a few subs). You can send a PM to someone or just a modmail to a sub if you're interested!

Only other things I can think of is to keep persisting, maybe try their support phone number instead, even link this thread to them in the chat to show how many others are being allowed refunds. Use their words maybe, say you know they can offer a ""onetime gesture of goodwill"" (that's the answer they give to everyone they allow a refund to) and see if they agree to that. Let me know the outcome, curious to see if they've changed heart about issuing refunds like this.

They don't do anything different than each other they all just stand around, one per building/space station. You can't destroy their ships, the freighters you attack don't cause your rep with a faction to fall, it's unaffected. Factions mean nothing.

You don't find it weird that regardless of the size or design of a ship they all fly exactly the same? You don't think that it wouldve been cool to choose a specific ship type based on how you like to play the game? Instead you just pick whatever ship you come across with the largest inventory, nothing else matters.

Planetary physics also involved features like scorched/sand planets closer to the suns and ice planets further out on the rim of the star system, with each planet having different resources depending on where they were located in relation to the sun. Instead we have just random planets (with a distinct lack of sand planets) with the exact same common resources on all of them and the rare resources randomly scattered throughout. Makes exploration not so much fun when you know whatever planet you land on will have the same stuff.

Whole process took about 10 min. Very good customer service tbh,2016-08-22 23:16:24+00:00,d6sj0iu,2.0,t1_d6sixob,116.0,Games
1684,I asked the agent who was helping me if that was the case since I had read the same thing. He told me I'd be able to repurchase it whenever I liked.

I put at least 10-15 hours in and had made it to my first black hole, no idea if they looked into my time played but that didn't seem to matter.",2016-08-22 22:37:26+00:00,d6shftz,2.0,t1_d6sh4n0,463.0,NoMansSkyTheGame

1690,How do you do this? Serious queston. I looked into it and all I could find out about refunding PS4 digital copies is that you have 2 days after you bought it but you can't have started the download. Meaning you can't try the game first.

2205,"As I said:

&gt;It is possible to discern between artwork that is supposed to be porn and artwork that has nudity in it.

Would you consider this porn or artwork of a naked person:

http://i.imgur.com/IZZ5p3t.jpg

That's my answer. I'm sure you can also distinguish porn from artwork of naked people.

2206,"Rule #7 is seldom used and the decision was not mine alone, it wasn't me just doing it on a whim because ""I felt like it"". There are other mods who felt the same way and due to the amount of user reports we decided to take action. This is about reducing pornographic content from subs which are not intended to showcase that kind of material. It is how the network is structured. We have subs fully dedicated to that, and then we have subs which are not. This sub falls under the latter category. 

It is possible to discern between artwork that is supposed to be porn and artwork that has nudity in it. So if this was hosted on a different website as per your example, it would indeed be treated the same way. 

Feel free to take this up with the rest of the modteam [by sending a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FImaginaryFallout) if you would like to discuss the matter with other members of the team.

2207,"&gt;This content that you are referring to is not hentai

I am referring to content posted from hentai-foundry.com which is a pornographic site. 

&gt;The rules do not say porn artwork is not permitted

As I explained, your post was removed under Rule #7 in the sidebar.

&gt;target things I post with boobs in it and call it hentai and then allow work form others to be posted that has boobs also but is somehow not hentai.

The difference is one is made as pornography and the other is not. You are not being targeted, we would remove content like this under our discretion regardless of who was posting it. I have been a supporter of your work since you started posting here, I have nothing personal against you. This content was removed because it does not fit this sub. As I already explained, there are subreddits in our network for content from sites like hentai-foundry.com, they can be found in the NSFW dropdown menu. This sub is in the Fandoms dropdown menu, which is not for that kind of content.

I understand and respect your decision to leave I am only trying to explain our reasoning here. ",2016-07-16 22:46:53+00:00,d5f0weh,5.0,t1_d5f0j9v,661.0,ImaginaryFallout

The sidebar says under rule #7 that this is a curated forum and posts can be removed at moderator's discretion. This sub is in the Fandoms tab, which is not meant to feature so much NSFW material. That is what the NSFW tab is for, with multiple subs for that type of content. Everything has it's own place in this network, and the content I removed here would be welcome elsewhere in the network. I hope you can understand our reasoning on the matter and wish you all the best. Thank you for your contributions.

We don't disallow nudity in general but when it's intended to be a form of pornography there are other NSFW subs in the Imaginary Network that those would be better suited to. I'd recommend /r/ImaginaryBoners for hentai material, there's an active community there which would appreciate these more than this community which as I'm sure you're aware doesn't receive these well.

Just to clarify, I'm not the artist. Just posting stuff. I can see what you mean with the size of his armour, but still don't think he looks unusually straight. In terms of large armour, don't go to /r/ImaginaryWarhammer.. you won't be pleased with the scale of their armour to the size of their bodies ;)

Point is, it's just a piece of art after all and not a real photograph.

It’s now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I’m just feeling genuinely happy I said ‘Yes.’ That ain’t no body double!”

3040,"Some good points regarding the pommel of the sword and the shoulder connecting weirdly into the armour. Other points of yours can be countered though.

&gt;Where does he rest his hand on?

Looks like his thumb is on the other side, lightly gripping the sword

&gt;his torso is huuuuuge.

He's wearing a suit of armour, his chest looks bigger because of the breastplate

&gt;his body is way to straight

I'm not seeing it.. his head is bowed down meaning his spine is curved. Hard to say either way with the cape concealing it.

&gt;the body in the back is super red

The body is Tywin suited into his crimson armour which he's known for wearing. That's accurate.

3073,"Not sure if theres a sub that specific. Here we allow all artwork related to the series, whether it's character portraits, landscapes, or interiors. So while you may not find what you're looking for at a glance, it's likely here somewhere. Here's a search for ""Hogwarts"", some nice results of what you might be looking for:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryHogwarts/search?q=hogwarts&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

In terms of confusion over the name of the sub, we have multiple subs like this for different fandoms and like to stick with the same naming scheme. Like with /r/ImaginaryWesteros (for ASOIAF), /r/ImaginaryMiddleEarth (LoTR/Hobbit), /r/ImaginaryTamriel (Elder Scrolls) - those are just a few as examples, you can see the rest in the ""Fandoms"" dropdown menu up top.",2016-05-14 00:26:59+00:00,d34qivs,1.0,t3_4j8e4c,12229.0,ImaginaryHogwarts

You can submit any link if it is the original source, but rehosting services such as imgur should only be used when the original source is unknown or has been lost.

3865,"Hi I'm a lead mod of /r/ImaginaryWesteros. I just wanted to chime in here. I've been a mod there for almost a year and a subscriber for longer and I can tell you the large majority of the userbase, including myself, feels the same way. This same discussion pops up on many posts where the art is based off the show, so just know you aren't alone. 

While we allow any fan art related to ASOIAF and GoT, the fan art influenced by the books is always better received that the stuff based off the show. All I can say is I hope you stick around and just ignore the artwork that doesn't suit your taste. If you look at the front page there right now you'll see the majority of posts are definitely based from the books. Same goes for the all-time top posts. Here's just a few as examples on the front page now:

[Catelyn Stark by Tommy Arnold](https://cdn2.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/002/225/934/large/tommy-arnold-arnoldcatelynstarkp150.jpg?1458940208)

[Ours is the Fury by Lukasz Jaskolski](http://i.imgur.com/n6y3w5p.jpg)

[AGOT 2.0: The Hand's Judgement by Tiziano Baracchi](http://thaldir.deviantart.com/art/AGOT-2-0-The-Hand-s-Judgement-546105755)

And some artwork based off the show can still be totally awesome:

[""A Sin so Terrible"" by Ertaç Altınöz](http://ertacaltinoz.deviantart.com/art/A-Sin-So-Terrible-597999098?ga_submit_new=10%253A1458566594)

['Margaery Tyrell' by Livia Prima [Mildly NSFW]](http://www.deviantart.com/art/Margaery-Tyrell-542110970)

Anyways, to answer the actual question of your post, I'll share with you my source of book based fan art (this is where I generally get content to post from):

http://7kingdoms.ru/classic-gallery/

Enjoy! I hope you still stick around with us at /r/ImaginaryWesteros! :D

Edit: Someone sent us a modmail suggesting a flair filter for book/show art that users could toggle depending on what they wanted to see. I'm very open to this and will see what I can do to implement it.

4144,"Could be a bit of both, and also depends on how much time certain people have to play. Someone who can play all day every day would finish sooner than someone who can only play in the evenings on certain days. But there's also definitely a difference in playstyles with completionists vs those who just want to beat the game or only experience certain aspects of it. I'm of the prior group of people since I'm going for all the collectables (right down to the little robot models you build) and I aim to max out affection for all the companions to get their perks. However I can't play all day every day so the result is   4 months later and I'm still not ready to finish.

4151,"&gt;That objection will only be considered valid if the subreddit in question is found to break either Reddit's site rules (found here) or not fit the purpose or spirit of the INE (to find, curate, and share artwork from across the internet).

I disagree that those should be the only reasons one should be able to vote ""no"". Subs that meet all the requirements of an INE sub can still have good reasons not to be inducted. For example, what if there's already a sub that covers the topic and there's no need for the new sub? What if the sub doesn't have enough potential to grow? What if there's not enough artwork available for the sub to sustain itself? These are all valid reasons to vote no, even though they can be subjective. 

So there are definitely more than your two reasons to vote no. The system in place is fine: vote yes/no - majority wins. It's always going to be subjective, opinions differ. That's why taking the majority is the best way to go and has always worked fine.

So yeah I'm gunna have to vote [](/no) on your proposal, the system is fine how it is. 

~~Edit: I guess this means we need an official vote thread on this now since it's been objected.~~

It's also an area I had already cleared and when I go to do the mission there are new enemies there which is weird because the [CLEARED] tag is still there. Killing all these enemies doesn't update and same as you there's no quest marker on the lcoation it wasnts me to ""clear"". 

I've tried sleeping for 20(+) days which I read is supposed to reset cleared areas but it hasn't done anything. The last solution I've read about is to try to get a radiant quest assigned to you by the BoS which sends you to clear out an area and hope they assign you the same are for Randolph Safehouse. Apparently this will force the area to reset and allow you to properly clear it. 

I slept 32 days in a row and it didnt reset so that didnt work, and theres such a small chance of getting the same locaion assigned to clear out by the BoS that I'm not even going to attempt it. So basicallyl I have no solution.",2016-03-17 04:48:01+00:00,d12xgys,1.0,t3_3wtjks,8069881.0,Fallout

Other  rules such as restricting reposts will also keep quality fresh which can become an issue in some larger subs.,2016-03-02 16:43:56+00:00,d0kuqzd,1.0,t3_48mx33,262.0,ImaginaryNetwork

and here's the URL of the original post:

http://patrickbrown.deviantart.com/art/Fallout-3-431023344

It wasn't detected because the two URLs aren't the same. Your link was a link to the image alone, while the first time it was posted was the full deviantart page. Karmadecay only works by detecting reposts of the same URL, it can't tell what the actual post is.

4865,"No worries thanks for understanding. Karmadecay doesnt always work because it only searches the URL which doesn't match in this case. Best way to check is to search the artist's name in the sub. One of the reasons we have the rule to include the artist's name in the title is so that any work of theirs that's been posted shows up when you search.

[Like here for example.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryFallout/search?q=patrick+brown&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)

Roughly anything with 150+ points is going to be in the top 100 and can't be reposted. Though feel free to repost anything outside the top 100 if it's been at least 3 months since it was posted. The rule for the top 100 posts is there because that's what people browse to see the best artwork and we don't want it full of duplicates.",2016-02-22 19:38:27+00:00,d09miau,3.0,t1_d09m5da,489.0,ImaginaryFallout

5096,"While that is what is most commonly posted here, the sub's real purpose is simply for any Fallout artwork so long as it credits the artist as well as possible and is submitted from an original source (not rehosted on imgur etc.) It's stated in the sidebar too.

Another example of official concept art being posted here is by Ray Lederer:

https://www.artstation.com/artwork/xD1rR

Although he's an actual concept artist for Bethesda and it's not fan-made, it's still more than welcome here since it's just great quality artwork.

5799,"&gt; for the longest time i thought it was only a place for harsh environments and desolate lands

That's how I've personally seen it, and I see /r/ImaginaryRuins as the place for abandoned places/interiors etc. Since this is in the landscapes tab I always thought posts here should lean more towards desolate environments and landscapes.

I didn't realize the history behind what the sub was based off though, maybe we can start a modmail to see what everyone else thinks? I know there's a much larger subscriber base here than /r/ImaginaryRuins but I think each has it's own purpose and difference like I mentioned.

http://i.imgur.com/T8q4AkB.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/zEbdUlK.jpg?1

http://i.imgur.com/nTvkcdE.jpg

So long as the image you're editing isn't just a screenshot from the game but actual concept art or something that was produced as graphic art it can be allowed. Keep in mind rule #7 in our sidebar that this is a curated forum after all so if one of the mods feels like the piece doesn't work here it can be removed.

However, I'm going to reapprove your post since it is official concept art from Bethesda which is technically allowed here as it is artwork. Also I do like what you were going for with the two sides of the synths face representing two different options (friend/foe). Sorry for changing my mind so late but we're primarily just for fan art so my initial reaction was that this didn't really fit but I realize that wouldn't be fair considering we've allowed other posts similar to this one.

6604,"Well I'm sorry the front page can't look exactly how you like it at any given moment. It changes. Every day. Unfortunately today it is a mix of about half/half book and show art. Maybe sometime next week it will be all book art. Or 3/4 book art. My original point before all this was you can very easily just ignore the show art (like everyone else) and wait for the book art - which in the larger picture is the majority of what is posted to this sub.

&gt; that means 5 of the current front page posts are untainted by the show.

No, double that. Here's 9 posts currently on the front page which literally don't have a single thing to do with the show:

7214,"You make a good point Obsignate. Just like IMGaming and IMAnime, Mythology is covering a broad genre. It could technically go in Fandoms but it would stand out of place from all the other subs there which as I said are all based off tv shows, movies, books, comics, video games etc. Even IMGaming and IMAnime fit into those categories (IMGaming=videos games and IMAnime=tv shows/comics/movies).

The Characters tab isn't too strict about posts focusing on just a character. Take the top post on /r/ImaginaryPirates for instance:

https://cdn.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/675/603/large/alex-serebryakov-env21.jpg?1430498218

It could be argued that it belongs in the Architecture tab instead, but since it's obviously pirate related it's allowed in IMPirates, even though it's a Character sub. The same would go for /r/ImaginaryMythology. I feel like the majority of posts there are about mythological characters, but locations and events are allowed as well. Maybe /u/5678903 can chime in about what exactly the sub was intended for, but from what I can see by browsing it seems predominantly based off characters.

Also, not that this should be the only deciding factor, but the Fandoms tab is jammed packed and I would rather see something added to the Characters tab rather than another to Fandoms if possible. If needed this can all be put to a vote. I'm not here to make the decision myself, and like everything else in the network we will decide this democratically if there's still opposing opinions.

Excerpt from ADWD from when this moment happened:

&gt;Daenerys Targaryen vaulted onto the dragon’s back, seized the spear, and ripped it out. The point was half-melted, the iron red-hot, glowing. She flung it aside. Drogon twisted under her, his muscles rippling as he gathered his strength. The air was thick with sand. Dany could not see, she could not breathe, she could not think. The black wings cracked like thunder, and suddenly the scarlet sands were falling away beneath her.

&gt;Dizzy, Dany closed her eyes. When she opened them again, she glimpsed the Meereenese beneath her through a haze of tears and dust, pouring up the steps and out into the streets.

&gt;The lash was still in her hand. She flicked it against Drogon’s neck and cried, “’Higher!’” Her other hand clutched at his scales, her fingers scrabbling for purchase. Drogon’s wide black wings beat the air. Dany could feel the heat of him between her thighs. Her heart felt as if it were about to burst. ‘Yes,’ she thought, ‘yes, now, now, do it, do it, take me, take me, FLY!’

&gt;Later, in Drogon's lair (next Daenerys chapter):

&gt;‘So many people, screaming and shoving.’ She remembered rearing horses, a food cart spilling melons as it overturned. From below a spear came flying, followed by a flight of crossbow bolts. One passed so close that Dany felt it brush her cheek. Others skittered off Drogon’s scales, lodged between them, or tore through the membrane of his wings. She remembered the dragon twisting beneath her, shuddering at the impacts, as she tried desperately to cling to his scaled back. The wounds were smoking. Dany saw one of the bolts burst into sudden flame. Another fell away, shaken loose by the beating of his wings. Below, she saw men whirling, wreathed in flame, hands up in the air as if caught in the throes of some mad dance. A woman in a green tokar reached for a weeping child, pulling him down into her arms to shield him from the flames. Dany saw the color vividly, but not the woman’s face. People were stepping on her as they lay tangled on the bricks. Some were on fire.

&gt;Then all of that had faded, the sounds dwindling, the people shrinking, the spears and arrows falling back beneath them as Drogon clawed his way into the sky. Up and up and up he’d borne her, high above the pyramids and pits, his wings outstretched to catch the warm air rising from the city’s sun baked bricks.

&gt;‘If I fall and die, it will still have been worth it,’ she had thought.",2015-11-01 15:12:38+00:00,cwkfy5e,1.0,t3_3r33se,98.0,gameofthrones

I hope Arya is the one to kill Cersei so she can scratch her off her list.

I'm thinking Arya will be the one hired to do the job and she ends up back in Westeros to kill Cersei.

No one's going to ignore the original post just to go to the comments for the imgur link. They'll go to the comments if they can't see the link and that's where the bot comes in handy. 

/u/ImageRehoster isn't doing any harm except for filling your inbox when you post a lot at once! For the subscribers it is nothing but a convenience, and the artists are already properly credited with the original post - which is what people attempt to view before looking for a re-host.",2015-10-20 16:39:12+00:00,cw6izar,1.0,t3_3p8li8,175193.0,ImaginaryNetwork

7893,"ADWD, Chapter 36, The Watcher

&gt;""Let us look upon this head,"" Prince Doran commanded.
His slippers whispering against the floor, Maester Caleotte crossed the hall to Ser Balon Swann. The round little man looked splendid in his new robes, with their broad bands of dun and butternut and narrow stripes of red. Bowing, he took the chest from the hands of the white knight and carried it to the dais, where Doran Martell sat in his rolling chair between his daughter Arianne and his dead brother's beloved paramour, Ellaria.

&gt;A hush had fallen across the hall. Dorne holds its breath. Maester Caleotte set the box on the floor beside Prince Doran's chair. The maester's fingers, normally so sure and deft, turned clumsy as he worked the latch and opened the lid, to reveal the skull within. Hotah heard someone clear his throat. One of the Fowler twins whispered something to the other. Ellaria Sand had closed her eyes and was murmuring a prayer.

&gt;The skull rested on a bed of black felt, grinning. All skulls grinned, but this one seemed happier than most. And bigger. The captain of guards had never seen a larger skull. Its brow shelf was thick and heavy, its jaw massive. The bone shone in the candlelight, white as Ser Balon's cloak. ""Place it on the pedestal,"" the prince commanded. He had tears glistening in his eyes.

&gt;""The Mountain rides no more,"" the prince said, gravely. ""Was his dying long and hard, Ser Balon?"" asked Tyene Sand, in the tone a maiden might use to ask if her gown was pretty.
""He screamed for days, my lady,"" the white knight replied, though it was plain that it pleased him little to say so. ""We could hear him all over the Red Keep.""
""Does that trouble you, ser?"" asked the Lady Nym. ""Ser Gregor was a bloody brute, all men agree. If ever a man deserved to suffer, it was him.""
""That is as it may be, my lady,"" said Balon Swann, ""but Ser Gregor was a knight, and a knight should die with sword in hand. Poison is a foul and filthy way to kill.""

&gt;Lady Tyene smiled at that (...) Prince Doran frowned. ""That is so, Ser Balon, but the Lady Nym is right. If ever a man deserved to die screaming, it was Gregor. He butchered my good sister, smashed her babe's head against a wall. I only pray that now he is burning in some hell, and that Elia and her children are at peace. This is the justice that Dorne has hungered for. I am glad that I lived long enough to taste it. At long last the Lannisters have proved the truth of their boast and paid this old blood debt.""

&gt;The prince left it to Ricasso, his blind seneschal, to rise and propose the toast. ""Lords and ladies, let us all now drink to Tommen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.""

&gt;The World of Ice and Fire - Ruins on Sothoryos

&gt;Maesters and other scholars alike have puzzled over the greatest of the engimas of Sothoryos, the ancient city of Yeen. A ruin older than time, built of oily black stone, in massive blocks so heavy that it would require a dozen elephants to move them, Yeen has remained a desolation for many thousands of years, yet the jungle that surrounds it on every side has scarce touched it. (“ A city so evil that even the jungle will not enter, ” Nymeria is supposed to have said when she laid eyes on it, if the tales are true). Every attempt to rebuild or resettle Yeen has ended in horror.

8315,"This image shows Sansa during her descent from the Eyrie. This is the icy bridge which she needs to cross with Sweetrobin.

&gt; “Ser Sweetrobin,” Lord Robert said, and Alayne knew that she dare not wait for Mya to return. She helped the boy dismount, and hand in hand they walked out onto the bare stone saddle, their cloaks snapping and flapping behind them. All around was empty air and sky, the ground falling away sharply to either side. There was ice underfoot, and broken stones just waiting to turn an ankle, and the wind was howling fiercely. It sounds like a wolf, thought Sansa. A ghost wolf, big as mountains.

He sends some of his men along with Quentyn Martell and co. to convince Dany they've turned cloaks and will work for her now. This gives him the chance to change to her side with the rest of the Windblown if the battle doesn't go in their favour.

However, he didn't know that Quentyn was on his own mission and when he finds out Quentyn plans to steal a dragon he agrees to help in exchange for the city of Pentos to be under his complete control.

He became a sellsword and eventually formed his own sellsword company called the Windblown. The rags he wears which give him his name are strips from the surcoats of men he's slain. 

In ADWD he's leading the Windblown against Daenerys and Meereen but makes plans of his own to possibly switch sides..

8683,"lol sure.

Those two sources are completely reliable but by all means, here's the text straight from the book which shows that Tyrion was killing people in the water prior to his encounter with Mandor Moore.

ACOK, Tyrion Chapter 61, Page 855 (US Paperback Edition):

&gt; Men were crawling from the river, men burned and bleeding, coughing up water, staggering, most dying. He led his troops among them, delivering quicker cleaner deaths to those strong enough to stand.

Bonus pictures of the pages themselves if you want to just read it and see for yourself:

[Page 855](http://imgur.com/CbvdMSU) (Second paragraph is what I quoted)

If you're still somehow doubtful feel free to re-read the chapter yourself, it's well worth it just to see Tyrion cut down a bunch of dudes. 

Thanks for having me dig out that book again it's been a while since I read that chapter. I forgot just how many people Tyrion cuts down. Reaffirms how accurate the illustration I posted is ;)

&gt;**They wade in among the men trying to escape the river**, cutting them down, and Tyrion finally understands what Jaime meant when he spoke of the euphoria of battle fever. Tyrion fights until Ser Balon Swann points out to him where enemy soldiers are swarming off a broken galley smashed on a pier, and realizes the shipwrecks have formed an ersatz bridge across the river. 

[Or, from the wiki:](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Blackwater#Attack_on_King.27s_Landing)

&gt;Tyrion manages to disperse the attackers at the King's Gate and make for the Mud Gate, where **he takes the fight to the riverfront** as they observe a large group of Stannis's soldiers crossing over the bridge of ship wreckage in the river. 

&gt;At dusk, in the fighting amidst the wreckage of the collapsing bridge of boats, Tyrion is severely wounded at the hands of Ser Mandon Moore

I know this removal seems pointless because her user is the same as her actual name, but if someone were to search for the name here it wouldn't work since there's no space separating the first and last name.

* It does not include significant context in the title, such as the title of the artwork. The title you are looking for is ""The Iron Throne"".

Maybe just add ""I've compiled an album of artwork in the comment"" but otherwise the title needs to be the title of the art and artist.

To roughly summarize - they ruled the world cause they could fly around dragons and fuck shit up but were unfortunately (for them) wiped out because the lived beside a volcano (think Pompeii). The Targaryens (Daenerys' House) managed to flee before everyone else was wiped out and they conquered Westeros all on their own andruled for a few hundred years until Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark put an end to them and their incestuous shenanigans. The show (and books of course) start a few decades after that when the Targaryens' rule is over.

I *highly* recommend reading the books if you're just getting into the series now and think you could get into the lore. Way more to take in with the books but that's a good thing if you like the story and setting :)",2015-09-07 03:02:39+00:00,cut3fky,2.0,t1_cut2ukv,1262.0,gameofthrones

9325,"Along with being able to craft Valyrian steel, the Valyrians could also work stone into shapes that seemed impossible to do without some form of magic. Dragonstone is one example, where the strongholds are molded into dragons and unique gargoyles line every foot of wall. 

Now imagine what was possible with their main city when magic was still very much present in the world and where they were the rulers of that world. This is what Valyria is supposed to look like, and the world we know from the books (and show) is so different because it's a whole different era. An era where magical cities gave way to the villages and castles of common men. 

While the series now obviously doesn't show this kind of fantasy, the whole point of the world is that it was once like this (they were flying dragons for christ's sake! :P) and then over time it all faded away.",2015-09-07 01:45:22+00:00,cut19sa,2.0,t1_cusxpdf,7673.0,gameofthrones

As for the Targaryens, they saw it coming. This bit from the wiki explains it:

&gt;  Daenys the Dreamer, the daughter of the head of House Targaryen, Aenar, had visions of a cataclysm that would come over Valyria. Aenar led House Targaryen and their five dragons, including Balerion, to the westernmost outpost of Valyrian influence, the island of Dragonstone, off the east coast of Westeros in 114 BC.

Even have you in /r/ImaginaryWitcher:

Posts in our network always need to credit the artist if you're sharing someone else's work so I've become familiar with you're name after posting your stuff. You're one of my favourite artists for Elder Scrolls artwork and I'm excited to see you start doing more Fallout stuff. 

I gave you artist flair in this sub, /r/ImaginaryTamriel and /r/ImaginaryWitcher so if you feel like posting more of your work to any of these subs the flair will show that you are the artist.

By the way you should seriously consider posting this to /r/fallout as well, it would get *a lot* more exposure than it's going to get here and people always appreciate OC :)

&gt;The children were smaller than men with **nut-brown skin, dappled like a deer's with paler spots.** They had **large ears** that could hear things that no man could hear.

&gt;They usually had **large eyes, great golden cat's eyes**, that could see down passages where a boy's eyes saw only blackness. They have **vertical, slit-like pupils**; this trait is responsible for improved night vision and typically associated with a nocturnal lifestyle in such creatures as cats. A few had green or red eyes; these had the gift of greensight and were known as greenseers.

&gt;Their **hands had only three fingers and a thumb, with sharp black claws instead of nails.** The children were slight, quick, and graceful.

&gt; Alyssa's Tears is a waterfall in the Vale of Arryn. It lies on the western side of the Giant's Lance. It receives its name from Alyssa Arryn, an ancient member of House Arryn who saw her family butchered before her and never shed a tear. No drop of the waterfall reaches the floor of the valley below.

He's offering two options and seems to be leaning towards the banning option, which I disagree with. Tagging posts would be fair to those that don't want to see this stuff.

&gt;Videos that help new players, explain glitches and how to get around them, talk about features and how to's. Those are fine. But **there are just so many ""Scored an awesome Aerial"" or ""slapped together a montage of my best goals"".**

&gt;As the sub get bigger, **this problem will get bigger**. It's inevitable and there's a reason almost every other gaming sub bans these kinds of posts.

He's definitely saying videos of cool goals, saves etc. are a problem that should be ""nipped in the butt"", and that other gaming subs ban this kind of thing which is incorrect as far as I've seen.

As for other artists that do stuff based off the books off the top of my head I can think of [Magali Villeneuve](http://magali-villeneuve.blogspot.ca/search/label/A%20Game%20of%20Thrones), [Marc Simonetti](http://art.marcsimonetti.com/127814/1270405/illustration/grr-martin-a-song-of-ice-and-fire), [Michael Komarck](http://www.komarckart.com/ccg_agot01.html), [Britt Martin](http://brittmartin.deviantart.com/art/Aeron-Greyjoy-169373968). Lots more out there, I recommend just browsing this sub's top posts for book inspired stuff and visiting the artists' deviantart pages where the rest of their work is.

Also, if you just google [The World of Ice and Fire art](https://www.google.ca/search?q=the+world+of+ice+and+fire&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1440&amp;amp;bih=779&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=-8iVVdb5AcWwyASPrrKICw&amp;amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=the+world+of+ice+and+fire+art) you'll see bunch from that book, all of which is official artwork.

* Half my subreddit shortcuts (RES) are cut off by the box at the top-right which shows your username, karma, messages etc. It just needs to be lowered so I can see my whole shortcut bar. *Edit: I realize there's stuff below it and lowering it isn't as easy as it seems without rearranging the rest of the layout. Probably not worth it.*

* The account switcher button (RES) has been removed, would be nice to have access to it. *Edit: got a response saying this will be added.*

* Posts should be numbered (e.g. 1., 2., 3., etc.). Numbered posts help find where you left off or find a specific post, and is pretty standard for a subreddit. *Edit: got a response saying this will be considered.*

Personal things:

* I really miss the positive/negative karma symbols from the game as upvote/downvote arrows. They were perfect because they represented Fallout karma and Reddit karma. 

* Also miss the pip-boy style subreddit menu.

* *Edit: I understand that these things no longer fit the theme and layout of the sub and don't really want them back since they will no longer work. I will still miss them a bit.*

This was the first sub I ever subscribed to on my previous account three years ago.. so I guess I miss it's original look a bit. But the new style looks great and it's got a good theme going now.

flaming roofs, enormous. His black-caparisoned horse prances, tosses its head, neighs. 
The rider stares down at her. Ciri sees his eyes gleaming through the slit in his huge helmet, 
framed by a bird of prey's wings. She sees the fire reflected in the broad blade of the sword 
held in his lowered hand. 

&gt;The rider looks at her. Ciri is unable to move. The dead man's motionless arms wrapped 
around her waist hold her down. She is locked in place by something heavy and wet with 
blood, something which is lying across her thigh, pinning her to the ground. 

&gt;And she is frozen in fear: a terrible fear which turns her entrails inside out, which deafens Ciri 
to the screams of the wounded horse, the roar of the blaze, the cries of dying people and the 
pounding drums. The only thing which exists, which counts, which still has any meaning, is
