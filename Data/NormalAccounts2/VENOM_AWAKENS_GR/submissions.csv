There is a possibility in my mind that project ogre is something bigger, multiple games connected somehow. All those references in GZ about parallel universes, all tsose weird things about tpp, pt's alternate realities and death stranding's black holes equations.A series of games leading somewhere! I do not state that he works for konami. There is always the possibility that all the above were included in his original plan but  because of the situation with konami he changed his plans.

Dataminers mentioned that the chapter 3 title card and the disarmament content  were in a profound place inside the flies, it was not hidden ,everybody could find it very easily! Now from a marketing perspective, konami like every other  company cares about money the most! Publishing a cut content video in the release date of the game doesn't make sense! ""Hey our product is not finished ""! What kind of company wants during  launch dates articles like ""huge content was cut from their product""? Speaking of which, they gave us a 30% completed cutscene that was abandoned very early in production, the problem is that in the summer of 2014 one year before the release we watched a 100% completed part of the cutscene ,venom walking through the burned place and the epic  scream in front of eli! but they preferred to give us a downgraded version of the cutscene.  So ,some things does not make sense , remember hideo downgraded purposely  the freaking pt before. For me the phantom episode is  a teaser for more content hiding from us what really happened there! Also how can we say that there is no ruse when nobody has finished chapter 2? What kind of book or anything has a prologue but not an epilogue chapter?

Of all the characters i didn't expect to be included in the f30050 freeroam folder, it was Paz. Now, this is what her assets in the f30050 folder contain:

Character effects. If you look closely, there are effects for walking, CQC, and hits. The only character who has the exact same effects + some more for gameplay purposes is Eli. However, she doesn't have her pftexs folder present [The folder containing her textures], which is weird.


She also has sounds, most likely for gameplay interaction

Now, here's when the intersting shit pops in...

Paz, as a unique hostage:

Now... check this out:

The picture above, there is a class. it's ""static properties"" [as seen in the second line] are as follows:

Paz1 main parts, hinting that they are important.

Paz2_pg.mtar, i don't know what this is.

a motion graph [Hostage2Mob_layers.mog]

Here, you can see that there is a class, ""TppSpeechData"", and under it there is a boolean variable. In short, a boolean variable consists of two values, true and false. It says that the name is ""Enabled"", the type is ""bool"", and the value is ""true"".


Now, as for this picture...

Posted Image

I am not sure about this one, but it is most likely configuring Paz's spawn location in Motherbase. The class is named ""Transform entity"", and contains configurations for scale, rotation, and translation [I don't know about translation though].


Now, i firmly believe that this has to do with Paz spawning on Motherbase, it may not be true, but i believe so. Why do i believe so? Here are my reasons:

1- This folder is set specifically for freeroam on Motherbase.

Posted Image

2- all the characters in this folder have spawned on Motherbase freeroam before.

1- Code Talker
2-Liquid, seen on the Motherbase command platform when departing, and fought in Motherbase freeroam.
3- Ocelot, seen when departing, and once again after first meeting Quiet.
4-Quiet, in her cell.

They removed his name from the disc case but Kojima's name is presented over 120 times in game? Really?

They said that the cutscene was 30% ready but here there is something very weird about eli's facial capture! Eli is not moving his lips his mouth is closed all along.
Now if you know how motion and facial capture works you will understand that when a face is motion captured its lips are captured too, that's why everybody in the phantom pain has lip sync with the words he says! About eli's scenes, did they put an actor to do all the movements and told his to remain silent and just look around? It's easy for them to completely graphically downgrade a scene or  the hole engine, pt was intended downgraded also it's very easy and fast for them to create or change the original scenes that's why they modified scenes only for trailers! They even created in 5 minutes a hole African area in a fox engine demonstration last year. Conclusion, maybe episode 51 is there but it is completely changed-different than it looks and optimized to look unfinished, they wanted tο mislead us like all the trailers!

It's suspicious that yong has not uploaded any theory video about all that chapter 3 speculations. That son of a bitch knows something about it but he can't tell us yet. Maybe they showed chapter 3 on the review event because they were afraid that reviwers will find TPP unfinished, that's why konami organized that event. Clearly they are not allowed to speak!
