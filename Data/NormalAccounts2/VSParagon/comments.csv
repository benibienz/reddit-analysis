45,"I've written in detail about this before, but I can sum it up like this:

Trump promised to be the president for ALL Americans, yet his exposure to Americans has been through the media or through rallies that are already packed with supporters. Protests, among many other things, serve as a reminder to Trump that most Americans did not support him for president, most Americans do not support what he stands for, and if he truly wants to be a unifier for our country, he needs to start listening to the opposition.

The thing is Trump WANTS his presidency to be a success, he knows he has to appease people living in cities or he will be a 1-term president shunned by history. He is obsessed with how he has been covered as a businessman, candidate, and now President. This is a guy who would write personal letters insulting writers who wrote articles casting him in a negative light. If there was ever a President who would actually care that people are protesting, it's President Donald Trump. 

It's also a message of solidarity to all the women, minorities, muslims, immigrants, etc. who feel like they're in the crosshairs for abuse and discrimination now. It really is such a Reddit thing to say ""ugh these naive protesters, they accomplish nothing and inconvenience everyone, they should follow my example and just shitpost on websites that public officials will never read or care about"".

2) Legendaries get balanced on an individual basis and at a rate of about 1 legendary/month, it's really not a big deal since the legendary system already has big winners and losers.

3) Boo hoo? This applies to buffs too you know.

4) Again, this can apply to buffs too. If an unfun spec/build gets buffed so that raids/M+ will expect/demand you use it, you can easily run into a situation where your fun spec gets dumpstered and you're left playing a clunky boring spec because Blizz overtuned it instead of addressing underlying issues. 

I saw nothing exciting for my class in the changes either, but then I realized EVERYONE is shitting their pants about 7.1.5. When it comes to balancing the power of classes, people really only care about their power vs. others. 

People don't look at what is being done to other classes, I saw at least 50 comments yesterday going ""OMG 5% CRIT NERF? NOW NOBODY WILL INVITE [MY AGI CLASS HERE] AND WILL ONLY INVITE [INSERT OTHER AGI CLASS HERE]"". The fact is for raids and boss fights, DPS is just a number to the actual player. People care far more about where they rank in DPS than what some arbitrary number means. People will still feel baller if they're #1 in a raid even if they're actually falling below the median DPS on Warcraft Logs for that fight. 

Plus since balance is in a decent place right now, it seems absurd to tell Blizzard ""Hey there's about 30 problematic talents/skills across the hundreds you've given us... can you just go ahead and buff 300+ abilities and trivialize most of the current content instead of just nerfing those 30"". Plus when everything is relative, big sweeping buffs function as nerfs to anything left out anyway.

Americans have never had the best reputation abroad, but I think it's important to remind ourselves and the world that a majority of Americans do not support his platform. 

The ""Not my _______"" slogan has been historically used for this purpose. You will find no shortage of the phrase in 2008/2009 when Obama took office. I think the issue people might have had with the Obama ""not my president"" movement was the racist undertones and the fact that many objections to Obama didn't have a factual basis (he's a muslim, he wasn't born here).

Words are always open to interpretation of course, but it seems like a fair message given the behavior and words of the President-Elect. It's totally fair to attack his policies and distance yourself from them, but I don't see the phrase as an attack on his legitimacy as Commander-in-Chief. To the extent that phrase does get deployed for the latter purpose, then yea it's a stupid and groundless argument against reality. ",2016-11-15 17:38:29+00:00,da1i8y4,4.0,t1_da1gc0w,2291.0,nyc
65,"First thing I'd suggest is to read stuff that challenges your perceptions of the world. There's plenty of articles from experts that will at least give your positions more nuance, read them with an open mind. Even if you think the source is biased, separate the evidence from the opinion and try to reach your own conclusion.

Both parties are concerned about unchecked immigration. For people like me, I'm mostly fine with Obama's approach to immigration. I think we should devote more funds to our immigration courts so that we can handle more cases. This would let us speed up the deportation process, but also spend more time on each case so that we don't end up retaining dangerous people while deporting refugees. 

Articles like this http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/ might convince you that immigration is not the problem Trump makes it out to be. There's plenty more research out there that shows how creating a path to citizenship would go much farther to assimilating these people into our society as opposed to just keeping them in the shadows and expecting them to somehow integrate into our system while simultaneously using that system to threaten them. 

Irritation at people waving Mexican flags to protest American immigration policies triggers a voice in most people's heads that says ""Well if Mexico is so great, why are you HERE?!"" It's not unnatural to feel that way. All I can say is that the flag is a short-hand symbol for one's heritage and given that our President-Elect has painted Mexican-Americans with a very broad and very negative brush, it's also not unnatural for people to want to express solidarity against his message by doing something like waving a Mexican flag. 

The images, videos, and stories we see out of Europe definitely remind us that mass migration is not all sunshine and roses. But its also important to remember that these are a small fraction of the tens of millions of refugees and immigrants that Europe has had to absorb over the years. It's a very complex situation over there but we can't forget that we're all human beings and it never makes sense to turn millions of people back into a war zone just because some of them will have difficulty integrating or may end up as criminals or worse. It's a position of optimism and faith in humanity, that just because the media shows us the worst in each other, that we won't stop trying to be our best to each other. There's also the practical position that that is Europe, the United States is much more insulated from the refugee crisis and we get to be very, very selective about who we let in compared to Europe. Data from refugee and immigrant communities in the United States all support the conclusion that the current system is a boon to our economy. 

These are just considerations, nobody is 100% correct on this stuff. But this nation does have a long tradition of trying to exclude the latest wave of immigrants, but that tradition has only taught us that the immigration policies that end up doing the most harm are the ones that demonize, discriminate, and isolate. Healthy immigration policy and well thought out path to citizenship are not incompatible with a secure border.

Clinton immediately accepted the result. Obama did too. So have the protestors. Nobody is saying that Trump cheated, or rigged, anything or that there is any doubt about the legal outcome of the election. Obama is comes around again and urges a peaceful transition of power. The protests here have been peaceful. Nobody in the protest camp is seriously advocating for violence, insurrection, or hate crimes.

69,"I hate this meme. There's 100 good reasons to be out there right now protesting. Trump craves affection and he's going to be spending most of his time in two cities that have anything but affection for him and what he stands for. He can write off negative headlines with minimal cognitive dissonance but when he sees the streets filled with protesters it gets under his skin.

I truly believe Trump when he says he WANTS to be a President for all Americans. If you've read about Trump on a deeper level you would know that right his absolute greatest fear is going down in history as a failure. The protests serve an important role in reminding Trump that the messages from his campaign will NEVER make him a president for all Americans and history will NEVER see him as a success if he maintains his campaign themes. He is thin-skinned and incredibly needy, I have absolutely 0 doubt that protests of a sufficient scale and duration would influence the policy decisions he reaches. 

If there's one benefit to Trump's personality and his filling the White House with shills and hacks, its that his emotional needs will absolutely come before anything else and nobody will say otherwise. The campaign is over, his desire to be loved can't be filled with rallies in red states every day. He's going to be seeing a lot more of the urban voters he's desperately avoided for the past 18 months and it should be our duty to make sure he never gets to slip back into the thinking that people here are OK with the policies he pushed during his campaign. 

That's just one reason to be out there protesting. There's one hundred more. I'm a white hetero male with a good income in a stable field and I live in a place where I know my state and local leaders will do everything they can to prevent Trump from running amok over our civil liberties. It's very tempting to say ""What will these protests accomplish guys? What's the worst that could happen (to me)?"" The reality is that there are tens of millions of Americans at the margins of society who are downright terrified and incredibly at-risk during a Trump presidency. Now, more than ever, those people need to see the message of unity and solidarity from everyone in the community, not just people who look or think like them. 

On the news all we've seen are images and videos of Trump rallies that espouse hate and bigotry. Even if it's just a small fraction of his supporters, they've gained a disproportionately loud voice. It's absurd to casually toss out the notion that protests which reject those messages and say ""We stand with refugees, we stand with women, we stand with Muslims, we stand with the undocumented, we stand with minorities"" are somehow meaningless and a waste of time. If we want to remain the America that aspires to its most noble values, and not one that's a disgrace the statue in our harbor, then there are countless reasons for you people to protest Trump.

Terrorism is a new challenge but terrorism isn't wiping cities off the map or leveling factories, its cost on society is overshadowed by other ""mundane"" issues like car accidents and preventable disease.

There's plenty of good work that needs to get done in the United States but there's no private sector incentives to get it done. No amount of tax breaks, tariffs on foreign trade, or blustery rhetoric is going to fix that. 

And that's just the bit on globalism. Technology is having the same effect on American workers and its only going to accelerate further in our lifetimes. Technology isn't done displacing people from the ""factory floor"" and we're already seeing AI that can perform certain roles are currently done by our most ELITE professions (doctors, lawyers, investment banking).

I'm actually hopeful for Donald Trump on many issues. I truly hope that he will do things like reform or remove the electoral college, pass strict rules that stop the revolving door in D.C., and in a profound irony I believe Trump is more likely to increase spending and pass another stimulus package. But on Trump's big promises for the economy all he's doing is wasting time, energy, and money trying to swim against a current that will never, ever stop.

214,"There's absolutely no evidence it will scale past Assassination with Nighthold gear. Outlaw is the big winner with the NH set, but Assassination does really well with it too, assuming the mutilate bleed will proc venomous wounds. 

Subtlely has nice bonuses but none of them really open up new possibilities for the spec. The main issue I see is that Shadowdance only gives you so many GCD'd for shadowstrikes. When I'm dancing I'm doing great, tons of energy, tons of CP, but the GCD'd limit what you can do. Once you are out of surplus dance charges, the class kind of hits a wall. Backstabbing and just doing a very basic rotation that doesn't have any answers for how to regain dance charges faster.  

That's the issue with the boots (their ONLY decent spec legendary) is the same as the set bonus. It just adds to the insane flood of energy and CP you get while dancing, but you still only have enough GCD's to drop 2 finishers at most before you're back to the backstab routine. 

Don't get me wrong, I think that Subtlety will be better than most specs single-target. But there are inherent limitations on the spec when every single bonus seems to bonus on the limited time you'll spend dancing. The bonuses will help squeeze in an extra finisher and help you build a couple more dances during a fight, but already with the random CP from auto attacks and the random energy refund from the artifact, I don't see the benefit of dumping even MORE RNG-CP and energy on me during the dance and I can see a lot of that CP going to waste. 

Assassination simply doesn't have that issue. Its biggest limit is energy generation and it has two excellent ways of diminishing that with the legendaries and Nighthold Set (-30s vendetta from relics, plus the boots, could get you close to a 50% uptime on vendetta, especially during Bloodlust or with Exsanguinate, which is an excellent energy churner). 

Also Assassin is the beast mode cleaver. Rupture on 2-3 targets turns your energy trickle into a flood. Dragons, Ilgynoth, Cenarius, and Xavius are all good examples of where rupture puts you ahead of the other specs. ",2016-10-13 15:43:07+00:00,d8qd8xr,3.0,t1_d8pi3mk,59560.0,wow

Simply put. Why would I ever bring a Demo Lock/Feral Druid/Shadow Priest who does 200-300k on trash and 250k on a boss when I can bring a WW monk that does 500k on trash and 235k on a boss?",2016-10-07 15:39:33+00:00,d8hzc92,2.0,t1_d8hpw10,16504.0,wow

Fortunately given how much flexibility Blizz has with the ""content"" of M+, they can easily add solutions:

Shift the weight of M+ difficulty from trash to bosses or vice-versa. Increase of Decrease the ""trash"" requirement to clear the dungeon. The test for these changes should be simple: What specs are seeing the slowest clear times in a given dungeon versus the fastest? If AOE builds are dominating, then soften up the trash a bit and give us longer boss fights. Add affixes that encourage single-target DPS (like reverse teeming).

EP/Exsang is preferred by raiders who appreciate the need for burst during certain adds/phases of a fight. Overall I believe MP/AP is the strongest build and you don't even need high mastery for it. Crit is the strongest stat for MP/AP. One of the Rogues I see doing 340k+ on heroic EN went 60/40 on crit/mastery for virtually every piece of their gear. Literally no haste or versa and they still gem/enchant for crit. 

I'm a fan of MP/AP simply because exsang and EP add another level of planning that even when done perfectly still gives average DPS thats equal or less than MP/AP. MP/AP lets me focus on the fight's mechanics without the constant stress of ""oh god there's 2 seconds left on EP and I need to drop another low CP envenom before I use kingslayer but my rupture timer is approaching the refresh window and I need it as full as possible because vanish is ready and I want the longest +50% rupture possible and...""

Mythic raiders use exsang not because it improves their overall DPS, but because when it comes time to burn, the burst from exsang beats anything else a Rogue can put out.

If you played WoW at all during WoD you would know it wasnt the ""2k+ team"" that was responsible for the achievement cancer. It was the fact that every single week from the beginning every single ~1500 team that didn't start with ""YOLO"" required people to have 2k+ achievements. 

People didn't want team that could break 2,000+ by sticking together and playing as a group, they were looking for easy wins by gathering teams that would be stacked with ""underrated"" players that would then go stomp a few YOLO pubs.

What happened with RBG's is like the textbook definition of MMR abuse, and considering how broken the system was, it was/is just pathetic.

386,"The game already ""rates"" that if its a move that let you win instead of lose. If you have a choice between an action that pushes you closer to winning (i.e. putting up that ice wall) and one that pads your stats (spamming ice shards at the roadhog with an orb of harmony while your ult is already full), you're still better off doing the stuff that lets you win. 

A smart teamplayer will still rank up faster than a stat-padding lone wolf because the teamplayer is going to win more. Same logic applies to talking over the mic, making callouts, etc. 

But those things rarely have to actually come at the expense of good stats. Keep in mind it only compares you to people playing the same character. 

It's not a perfect system but it's still better than a ""you had someone go AFK/troll/etc. so we're going to punish you all equally"" and ""you put the team on your back and carried harder than you ever have in your life, we're rewarding you all equally"". 

My experience in Season 1, playing an even mix of support/tank/DPS, was that I was able to hit my equilibrium rank within days and it never wildly fluctuated. If I dropped a few ranks I would perform better relative to my team so further losses wouldn't sting as hard and wins would get me more points, same thing when my rank would climb above where I was able to pull my weight... playing competitively in Overwatch was definitely the least painful MMR experience I've had in any online game... ever.

Good question about multiple characters, again, I don't know, just giving my interpretation on what they've said. I'd imagine any decent comparison system does it on a score/healing/dps/etc. over time calculation, so it would track your performance with Reaper/Hanzo with your score/minute or whatever while you played each and comes to some kind of average for the two. 

Theoretically it's a good system. One of the reason ""ELO/MMR hell"" exists in games is because you represent 8-10% of the players in a game. If shitty placement luck puts you at a starting MMR that is 25% less than your ""true"" MMR, it can take ages to balance out all the other RNG that can slow you down. Your team might have someone who's ""true"" MMR is 35% lower than where they are at (meaning as a whole your team is overrated even if you are underrated), or someone on the other team might be underrated by 40% and thus still better than you even though you're still underrated.

If you're losing your Sigvald on the field I'd just highly encourage you to move some of your elite units (Chosen/Giants/etc.) to Sigvald's army and have him level up ASAP with repeatedly sacking settlements, even weak ones, for the XP. Once Sigvald gets his quest armor he becomes almost impossible to kill in battle. 

I wouldn't worry too much about restarting your campaign. Unlike other TW games there's no ""timer"" on your campaign and you can take as long as you need to win. The Skaeling were a huge pain in my campaign too but I just avoided them as I went South and I started seeing big bonuses to my diplomacy with them (and older penalties disappeared) as I attacked common enemies like the Empire. Once the bonus was high enough I had no problem keeping them friendly to me, I wouldn't waste time trying to wipe them out since they aren't a campaign objective and their Northern territory is meaningless once you're far enough South. 

When I was hostile with the Skaeling I just kept forced march on and hugged the Eastern mountains as I went South, I spent a few turns camping out on Vampire Count territory, which got me some big diplomacy penalties but it kept the Skaeling/Empire stacks from trying to wipe me out. Other than that I just relied on lightning strike to pick apart multi-stack forces and realized that arty spam was a great way to resolve battles with minimal casualties. Also if any unit is injured below 50% I either merge them and recruit a new one or just disband and re-recruit.

I'm nearing the end of my VH Chaos Campaign and despite the AI getting a pretty huge public order bonus on Very Hard, I've seen at least a dozen provinces fall to Chaos Rebellions when I only have two stacks and I'm barely using heroes to do anything besides sit in my stacks for XP/Protection. 

I suppose its kind of nifty for helping you close out the endgame, you don't have to sack for favor and then wait to raze most of the time. If corruption is high and you sack the settlement, it will often accelerate a rebellion and you can leave the Chaos rebels to deal with the razing. Unfortunately the rebels disappear after razing the settlement. 

I really hope that CA gives a bigger replenishment bonus for high corruption though. It's absurdly slow even in super high corrupt territories. I've found that the game actually reserves the highest level of replenishment for those territories with Northern tribes you've awoken/subjugated. Unfortunately the Northmen destroyed every tribe I subjugated and it probably wouldn't matter since late game you aren't going to go back North for faster recovery when it takes 8 turns to get there. 

It's just annoying playing Chaos when I constantly find myself needing to encamp for 6+ turns to get an army back to full strength, so I'm forced to disband and re-recruit units even if they've only fallen to half-strength.

It's plausible but even more absurd since it relies on Arya assuming that Jaqen would send the Waif after her and that the Waif would try to kill her with a blade to the gut. Theory #2 doesn't explain where Arya got all that money, why she doesn't have Needle, or why she would be able to make those kinds of assumptions about her assassin. 

The only issues with the first theory is that it involves some motivations/rules for the Faceless Men that haven't been revealed to us, but could easily be done so next episode. Only thing that's perplexing is the Arya wearing some new outfit looking like she's running from someone.

Then there's Theory #3. Arya is dumb and got stabbed but she gets instantly healed by Lady Crane in such a short period of time that she's still able to feign injury and turn the tables on the Waif. It makes the huge list of suspicious behavior from Episode 7 irrelevant and is pretty implausible even by GoT standards for someone to recover from those injuries so quickly. 

My money is on Jaqen = Arya, but I'm definitely looking forward to next episode. ",2016-06-07 15:15:19+00:00,d3zirg6,3.0,t1_d3z2pam,38442.0,gameofthrones

It just gives LMGs another bit of DPS fluff that just makes them another variation of AR's/SMG's. At least MM weapons only reward you for headshots, this would just be a flat damage bonus that's even more boring than the SMG bonus. 

IMO LMG's need to fill the desperate need we have for PvP. It needs to be a suppression weapon that forces people to actually play a cover based shooter that involves tactics/strategy and isn't just the previous iterations of:

1) March/April = People have lower TTK's in this RPG compared to actual competitive shooters. One shot to the head can do 110k+ damage in PvP against a max armor opponent where even ""tanky"" player isn't running more than ~105k hp. 

2) TTK's are where they should be in an RPG, but now the atrocious combat mechanics rear their ugly head. Combat is now everyone rolling around like idiots in the open until someone gets caught by a shock turret and gets teamfired by 4 players. The LMG can be the cure. Give it a significant bonus to enemies out of cover, have it STAGGER anyone who takes X amount of bullets/damage out of cover. It should also get a hefty accuracy penalty for being fired while out of cover.

Basically the LMG should be what forces cover to be relevant in PvP. An LMG user in cover should annihilate someone who's just trying to roll spam them out of cover. ",2016-06-06 16:09:36+00:00,d3y71kr,1.0,t3_4mr6aa,43153.0,thedivision

545,"IMO divtech should be improved... once incursions are out next week. Right now they're literally the only reason to log in for a lot of people. 

As the Devil's Advocate:

1) Divtech is the only aspect of the endgame that hasn't been exploited or broken. Crafting mats, phoenix credits, DZ keys/credits, were all easy to exploit with bullet king, hornet, madison square's boss, police academy, etc... without divtech to act as a speedbump everyone would pretty much have the ideal gear they want.

2) It has people play in the DZ. Challenge missions get old fast, there's no variability, and with good gear, there's no challenge. DZ was designed to be our endgame, and it failed hard on that for the first few weeks. Now that people can go rogue without forfeiting hours of work, people will actually PVP over control of Divtech routes. It's nowhere close to ideal, but it actually gives people a reason to PVP outside of being bored/griefing. 

9/10 times if I go into the hotel with someone ahead of me and I can see the chests are up, I will absolutely murder you for them. 

3) They aren't that important. If you want to participate in the endgame, running dailies+challenges is all you need. The dailies+challenges give you enough Phoenix credits and crafting mats to get good ilvl 31 HE rolls on a primary weapon, mask, kneepads, and backpack. For the glove/chest/holster slot you can easily make due with the purples you find or level 30 HE's that drop every day off the challenge daily. You aren't excluded from anything in this playstyle. Divtech is for the perfectionists and tryhards, so it's not that crazy to expect people to mindlessly grind if they want perfect gear. The system could definitely get improved, but we need something else to take its place or else one week after Divtech gets easy to obtain... we'll just see an endless wave of ""I'm bored, nothing to do"" posts in its place.

1) Stamina scales better than firearms or electronics. 

2) Armor is the single most potent stat

Because of the way armor works, its even MORE potent in the DZ and I feel like anyone not running max armor in the DZ is a goddamn fool. The difference between a ""standard"" ~50% armor build and a 65% armor build is freaking 43% damage mitigation.

567,"Only thing I'd suggest is cutting skill power and putting on more HP.

Stamina scales the best out of the three core stats once you get a decent armor level. 

I'm at 37k skill power and I'm looking to reduce it for more armor/stam because I've already managed to hit the pulse crit cap (40%) somewhere between 35-37k. IMO once your pulse starts capping there's no reason to keep building skill power. Even at 28k skill power my pulse crit is at 38% (I have +4% to pulse crit chance, so 28k = ~34%, only 6% from cap). 

I'm currently at 150k sheet dps, 78k hp, 37k skill. Hoping to get to 85k HP and ~60% armor without going under 30k skill and hopefully not taking a hit to my DPS.

I agree though, the glass cannons are almost certainly gimping themselves, aside from having one specialized cannon per squad but even that's pretty iffy for tactical purposes since a fight not going precisely as planned results in your cannon turning into a liability.

Gutting your skill power makes you almost completely dependent on medkits or squadmates for heals and the hit to your pulse alone costs you more DPS than you gain from whatever firearms you stacked in its place. Even if you already had teammates for heals, there's just too much that skillpower offers to justify leaving it at 10k. The lower cooldowns, the ridiculous bonuses you can hit with smart cover or pulse, etc.

TL;DR: Stacking DPS at the expense of skill power is silly, but skill power isn't the final solution either. More people need to be aiming for 60%+ armor (out of cover, most PVP does not happen in cover Mr. I'm 65% behind cover but 46% running down the street) and 90k HP. Armor actually scales incredibly well if you understand how it works (Someone with 50% armor compared to his friend with 65% will take ~43% more damage in PVP).

Support is like a luxury build for those who have the best gear with properly rolled talents and skill bonuses. You should just focus on getting your health up to 75-80k so you can actually survive and be an asset. Stamina scales better than any other primary stat (Only the secondary DPS stats like crit can scale faster), move like 2 of your items from Firearms to Stamina immediately. I started running challenge modes with &lt;100k DPS. The difference between clearing a challenge with low DPS v. high DPS is ~10 minutes at most. The difference between clearing a challenge with low HP v. high HP ""failed group, disbanded after first room"" and ""success"". 

Your issues have nothing to do with RNG at this point. Just poor stat allocation. Save your glass cannon build for when you actually have the gear to be a cannon. ",2016-03-23 15:44:23+00:00,d1akom7,1.0,t3_4bmyj6,824.0,thedivision
586,"D3 wasn't disliked because the grind was slow. I got top-tier gear in vanilla D3 within a couple weeks because all you had to do was get good rolls on your rares and you were pretty much at the pinnacle of your class. 

RoS expects you to grind MUCH longer to reach your classes full potential. You not only need to get ANCIENT legendaries for your ""best in slot"" items, but you also need to run like HUNDREDS of greater rifts to get the leveled gems you need to fully enchant your armor.

Meanwhile you don't even need to farm drops in this game. All you need to do is collect your 50 Phoenix credits from the daily challenge and maybe scoop up ~15 more from DZ named bosses or Daily Hards, each take less than half an hour. 

So at an income of 65 phoenix per day, for less than an hour of playing, you have enough to get best-in-slot blueprints for a majority of your slots, including the all-important primary weapon.

1) I opened a DZ 30 chest and a blue item appeared, every time. Even one person testing the endgame would've been able to tell them that even regular rank 30 doesn't want blues, DZ 30's have been 30 for a while and are already in well-rolled purples.

2) Midas, 5% signature cooldown reduction per crit, on a gun that can get 25% base crit with skills+armor that can get you to 60-100% crit easily, fully automatic with a large mag... oh and one of those signatures gives you +30% move speed and 80% damage resist for 15 seconds.

""I’d likely have even more memorable war stories to tell, possibly with me as the aggressor, but developer Massive has tilted the risk/reward balance dramatically against those who would consider attacking other players to steal their loot. The potential rewards are currently far outweighed by the risks of being labeled as a rogue, being hunted zone wide, and potentially losing hours worth of Dark Zone rank progress as punishment. I get the need to keep it from being so attractive that everyone goes rogue all the time, but right now they’ve limited the allure of betrayal to the point where I just wasn’t willing to risk it. It very much needs adjustment, and hopefully that will happen, but for now the Dark Zone is playing it a bit too safe.""

692,"I thought it was funny that you sacrifice primary stats for crit but then you don't even use a crit damage muzzle. 

Other than that, thats a ridiculous vector roll. I haven't even been able to roll headshot damage after 8 attempts, let alone the +crit one. 

I also haven't seen anyone confirm that the headshot = pulse gives you any of the pulse bonuses. I know that when I run the +dmg pulse, enemies pulsed by the talent don't take extra damage.

I'd also say take the low health medkit = 40% damage mitigation in place of steady hands since your non-existent tech skill means medkits will be your primary heal, I haven't seen much of a benefit for taking steady hands with SMG's since the recoil is already extremely manageable.

I'd say much of the strength of this build is just having great gear with a near perfect vector roll against people in the DZ who have yet to fight a rogue and are still in random purples while you pop all your CD's in advance and are completely prepared. You had the first strike, incendiary ammo (which is crazy good in PVP since it blocks ability use), and popped Survivor Link. The opponents underestimated your DPS and just spent most of the time reviving instead of trying to drop you but none of them popped their signatures or else this would've been a very different fight. 

Still shows the potential of a DPS oriented build, having high DPS let you blow up 6 players before the signature expired whereas other builds could not, but if someone had done the same to you ""popped a signature, turned on incendiary, and then opened up point blank"" then you die just as fast. As for PvE, still a fine build but not optimal. Giving  up 20k+ health and running minimum tech for another ~30k DPS isn't worth it in most situations, even if you trigger on the move, challenge mode enemies will chunk you in a couple seconds or less. 60k won't even let you survive a challenge mode sniper round. 

Calling this build tanky is super deceptive. In the video you're tanky because you're running the (arguably super OP) survivor link which is pretty much god mode for 15+ seconds.

You took everything extremely literally when I'm talking about the theming of these creatures. The Thing could almost perfectly impersonate a human and it preferred to replace its victims in secret. The Thing would only overtly attack in the presence of multiple people in desperation or self-defense. The horror of The Thing was the terror of looking your friend in the eye and not being able to tell if he was that friend, or the alien... and knowing that it was spreading in secret and you could even be the last human. A defining characteristic of 'The Thing' was that, down the cellular level, each part of the creature was its own individual organism. So with the ""Hot Wire"" test, an alien's cells will betray the greater whole out of self-preservation. 

Alien and Necromorphs don't give a shit about subtlety. When there's an outbreak of either they will openly attack at every opportunity. When you look at an alien or necromorph you immediately know what it is. Both use vents/air ducts to ambush survivors and after picking off civilians to grow their ranks, they rely on superior numbers to overwhelm the remaining organized resistance. Unlike the selfish/individualized characteristic of the Thing, the Aliens and Necromorphs both operated as a unified whole and both would gladly sacrifice their rank-and-file in order to protect the Marker/Queen.

I could care less about the nitty gritty of facehugger gestation v. necromorph infestation v. Thing absorption and assimilation. Thematically, Dead Space falls much closer to Alien/Aliens than it does to The Thing. 

Think about it this way: Try to rewrite 'The Thing' with Necromorphs. It doesn't work. The story immediately falls apart and loses everything that defined the film. The dog running from the Norwegians would look like this: 

http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/deadspace/images/5/50/Dead_Space_3_Lurker_dog.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20121129033505

and that would be the end of the story when the US and Norwegian teams work together to gun the monstrosity down. Nothing about The Thing's story would have worked with Necromorphs. 

Now replace Alien/Aliens with Necromorphs. Sure it would be a big shift for parts of the story but it would largely stay intact... even down to the faction of humans who will actually help the aliens spread and (attempt) to use them to kill their human enemies (Weiland-Yutani/Unitoligists).

886,"Most MMO's are instanced these days. When I have 15 people with me chasing a bounty around, that's more ""massive"" than most MMO's in recent memory. Borderlands had no social zones and plays only entered your game if you wanted them to. Same with Diablo. 

The rest of this is clear you're just knee-jerking to what I've said without actually reading it. You copypaste another post from the front page and yet the only bullet point that applies to this post is the stuff about revenge (which apparently he felt the need to list twice). Revenge is a fine mechanic, tension is a two-way street. It would only apply to the rogue's first victim and not an across the board ""You kill me, I get a freebie against you"" mechanic. 

As for point #7. Who the hell is going to do that. If you leave a group it already does a countdown and warns everyone else that you're breaking off. You'd have to be the worst rogue in the world if you think that's a smart way to betray teams. 

Meanwhile there is a very realistic issue of group members serving as a non-hostile griefer that exploits the rogue system to harass everyone trying to attack his friends. Do you know how frustrating it is shooting at a rogue who has a non-hostile literally forming a human shield in front of him? 

Believe me I've played all the ""cold and unfair"" multiplayer games in existence. Nobody is asking for 50/50 odds. But it is uniquely bad design when a rogue camps extraction areas with absolutely 0 risk, if they fail then they lose a handful of credits and get a 30s respawn. If they succeed they take 30+ minutes of someone elses work and take it for themselves for all the effort it takes to shoot someone in the back while they're channeling an extraction.

Being a rogue is about high-risk, high-reward. Everyone agrees on that point. But currently rogue is either suicide-risk, no-reward if you try to do stuff people enjoy (PvP firefights) or its no-risk uber-rewards if you just sit around shooting extractors in the back.",2016-02-02 05:57:49+00:00,czkq2u1,2.0,t1_czkph56,1278.0,thedivision

I could buy a Cadaceus at level 7 and then when I hit 8 the vendors all offered a new tier of gear including a level 8 Cadaceus that was slightly better.

Here's my theory: The pricing we saw was ACCURATE for level 7-8 gear in the release version. I mean they clearly intend for the Dark Zone to be available from level 4-30, they will obviously need to offer gear for players at all of those levels. But they can't sell gear at ""endgame"" prices at level 4 or else nobody would ever be able to afford a level 4 Dark Zone weapon if it took 15,000 DZ credits. So instead the DZ gear from 1-29 will be cheaper so that DZ players will be able to get upgrades as they level up. 

I think the beta gave us a picture of how 30 would work by activating a similar mechanic for level 8. At level 8, players got their own special instance with updated vendors and the quality of item drops was significantly enhanced. At level 7 it was green drops all day long, at level 8 suddenly blues were everywhere. I think is a good idea for managing level 30 gear, but they need to make sure that unlike the level 8 gear, the level 30 stuff needs to be significantly more expensive. We will probably only spend a few hours at most at level 29, but we expect to spend DAYS/WEEKS/MONTHS of in-game time at level 30. The gear access needs to reflect that.

Presumably level 29's won't have access to level 1 zones and vice-versa. NPC's have to be balanced by level too. 

So I'm making the assumption that the ""beta boundaries"" would also exist in the final version for players who try to go into a zone outside of their level limit. 

All of this is irrelevant for level 30's. Ubisoft has said that 30's will have the ENTIRE Dark Zone to themselves in their own special instance. I completely support this idea.

There are level restrictions so level 1's don't wander into the high level zones and so that high levels don't camp the level 1 entrance to the dark zone. How do you think that Ubisoft will enforce the boundaries on these zones? 

Max levels have access to their own special instance of the zone, but until then Ubisoft is going to rely on boundaries to keep low levels and high levels segregated, and the mechanics of the boundary system suggest this wasn't something they just threw together for beta. 

The skills stuff are guidelines. Obviously we don't know what end-game balance looks like, but what we've seen so far is that riot shields and stickies are a joke compared to pulsing/first aid. Heals are extremely strong and the skill trees show that the medic tree gets even STRONGER heals down the road. That's why my suggestion was short here, Ubisoft should be aware of skill imbalance in PVP. This is the ONLY large scale testing of PVP that has happened so far.

They reduced it for beta for better performance. Who's to say they don't decide to keep it low in order to keep framerates high for consoles in the Dark Zone? I'm simply reiterating that the players want more NPC's and its a big point of contention for us.

It was (and is) a pretty impressive step forward in creating an organic environment in a shooter.

IMO the best way to make this deck (unless youre playing on your phone, RIP framerate) is to load it with NOTHING BUT Auctioneer+Shadowfiend+Faceless+Malygos+Auchenai (and Velen if you have him, Emp is optional, if you drop him turn 1-3 while you have auctioneer it can win you the game, but after that its a dead draw, loatheb is also optional for countering enemy combos) and then the rest with your cheap spells, (heals, PW:S, mind blast)  and the usual mill cards like the engineers, murloc, azures.

The idea is that auchenai/malygos/shadowfiends/faceless are pretty much the only cards in your deck that WONT draw more cards. Grabbing 0 mana spells and even faceless'ing the auctioneer is necessary to keep the cycle going.

Basically once you get shadowfiend+auctioneer out, you should be able to mill your entire hand in a single turn and drop auchenai+malygos near the end (you might have to drop one auchenai, circle, then drop the other just to make room, at this point everything is 0 mana so whatever, you should have plenty of overkill so don't hesitate to heal yourself during the cycle just to make room for malygos/faceless.

Don't try this on your phone though, you'll draw like 5 cards at most and the game will start to lag and take an eternity to update your cards to 0 mana cost. Keep in mind this deck style is like strapping yourself to a rocket, if you try to launch the cycle without fuel... you probably just lost the game (i.e. its possible your first 0 mana draw from auctioneer is Malygos but now you have nothing to keep driving more card draw)... but once you launch you will rapidly accelerate out of control, if I'm using 2 auctioneers (typically one is faceless) then I will typically do auchenai+any targeted heal just to kill it off and make room in my hand and bring things back down to a 1:1 ratio so that I dont end up accidentally burning Maly.",2016-01-28 20:31:35+00:00,czfjfce,1.0,t3_433nkh,19427.0,hearthstone

997,"Yea, I already hit the point where I'm not really interested in getting bigger ships.

I was flying a FAS last week with 2x Fixed Beam + 2x Pacifier, it was beautiful. The FAS was so insanely agile that I could stay on the tail of anything effortlessly.

Then last weekend I got my Python fully loaded for combat and immediately found myself making sacrifices. I couldn't run fixed beams because the reduced agility made it too hard to stay on target as often as Gimballed lasers. Then I found myself struggling to enjoy PA's OR Frags on the Python. 3x frag is fun against larger ships but when a target is feeling particularly feisty I had way too much downtime trying to catch up to them and get a full broadside into their hull. I tried PA's out and was frustrated by the power management aspect, I would drain my weapon capacitor busting shields and then I'd be sitting there staring at the enemy hull covering half my screen unable to fire because of the significant per-shot charge of PA's (frags are SO much more forgiving if you're running low on power), and of course once I could fire they'd be boosting away and I have to give the AI credit for being difficult to land PA shots on... the sporadic boosting and random turn changes just had me convinced that PA's won't be worth it until I get something even bigger that can just rely on a huge alpha strike instead of needing to land 10+ individual PA shots to destroy a hull.

TL;DR: I'm convinced the FAS is the absolute best ship for bounty hunting. Frags/Pacifiers let you shred a hull on even the biggest ship without difficulty, moving up to bigger ships just give me headaches where the increased firepower is counteracted by the loss of mobility... 33%-50% more DPS... and 50%+ more time spent in endless turn wars trying to get close enough for the only decent anti-hull weaponry to hit its mark.

Wasn't so bad when control decks could still justify running stuff like Rag/Ysera, but now the meta has gone through a self-reinforcing spiral where decks can't justify running late-game minions or else Secret Pallies/Overload Shaman/Druids will get an insurmountable lead, and thus they have to run less late-game legendaries, which in turn makes those legendaries more likely to eat the removal that your opponent's been saving, which in turn makes you want to drop anything besides Dr. Boom that's over 6 mana and basically succumb to the midrange meta.

Elise lets you play to that meta with good odds, no dead hands, while still giving you a late-game advantage.

I recently made my control warrior deck completely reliant on Elise and if I think my opponent has some big threats I can just sit on my shield slam/brawl/whatever and knock out their Antonidas/Tirion/etc. before dropping the monkey and starting my own parade of legendaries.

Of all the times I've dropped the monkey, only like &lt;20% of the time do I have myself going ""oh shit I wish I had kept my hand"". I've found it to be a more consistent finisher than running around with Alex/Grom/Ysera/Rag/Rafaam/Varian and all the other legendaries i've thrown into my C.Warrior deck at various points... except that Elise is never a dead card.

I've lost so many games sitting there on turn 2-5 with Boom/Sylv/Grom/Shield Slam while Mr. Aggro is tearing my face off.

Against tempo/aggro a single Elise substituting for all the other post-Boom endgame drops is a lot less likely to screw you over. Even in control v. control Elise can carry the day by delaying fatigue and giving you a hand full of (probably) endgame legendaries while you typically only have to worry about eliminating 2-3 of your opponents big guns.

The game doesn't end there though, this is a high visibility case being litigated in civil and criminal court where life-term federal judges and a small army of lawyers will be raised to pick apart any possible weakness in the case. With all that sniffing around, a single bit of evidence suggesting a conspiracy would easily make that lawyer/investigators career. 

This isn't a clear victory for pharma either. If he gets sent to jail it will be for securities fraud, in terms of his drug price manipulation only the New York AG has even hinted at possible legal action.

I'm not completely sold on either strat but my problems with this strat have been:

1)  People who stay on platform because they are... just... about... to... kill... their...kni.... oh shit I'm dead. You can tell them just to run middle and to leave the knight if it comes to that but people will be stubborn, don't want to be embarassed if their light always gets eaten or always needs help killing their knight, or they don't realize how much damage is coming their way until its too late.

2) Vessel/4th Knight not dying. I can get a group who kills their ogres consistently enough, but its always cutting it close and the vessel/relic knight always seems to escape attention. Floaters forget which platform had the relic and they think they got em all only to realize half the blights are gone and there's a rogue knight when its time to jump down. 

3) Simplicity. I might prefer this method to no-knights, but its definitely not simpler. Until Oryx slams his fist, no knights is literally just ""shoot your ogre for a few seconds and then /sit in the back of your platform for ~20 seconds"". Then you just jump to a daughter platform and shoot at various targets under the safety of bubble/aura, then dash to blight and dash back.

If you're 297+298 you can easily beat this with a conventional CLEAR-&gt;DPS-&gt;CLEAR-&gt;DPS repetition. I tried this method last week and you're basically playing letting RNGesus decide if you beat the encounter.

If it works you absolutely crush it with tons of time left, but after seeing 7 attempts go wrong we beat it on the first try with a conventional strat. Draksis can knock you off the platform, boss can run off and make your bubble pointless, with blessing you can get burst surprisingly fast if youre not constantly stepping in and out... and if it doesn't go perfectly with the boss being dead or &lt;15% life after the bubble then you're pretty screwed since the adds will be completely insane at this point and Draksis is still orb spamming you. 

297 + 298 is super overgeared for this fight and you could've comfortably beaten it by focusing on adds in reverse alphabetical order with only sidearms and still had 2+ minutes to spare.

Arc Blade is less vulnerable to snipers and more vulnerable to shotguns. Stormtrance is more vulnerable to snipers and less vulnerable to shotguns (is the pulsing AOE of death REALLY necessary in addition to main lightning attack?).

However, Stormtrancers can easily play around the sniper vulnerability by using their super indoors and in CQC settings where it is unstoppable. Arcbladers cannot escape their weakness. I HAVE to get in shotgun range to kill you with my arcblade and that means each and every one of my targets can blow up 75-100% of my health with the shotgun+melee combo. If you backpedal its not hard to pull off that combination since you can get a full damage shotgun blast while I'm trying to close the gap and then melee as I go in for the killing swing.

1146,"Priest definitely got some love this expansion.

Unfortunately the meta shifting isn't doing it a ton of favors. Tons of top decks right now are basically tempo decks that try to snowball early. 

Priest AOE hasn't changed at all so if your opponent starts to spiral out of control early on you're still dependent on either having auchenai+circle in your hand by turn 4/5, or pray the enemy minions are &lt;=2hp for a turn 5 nova, or double down and go for a turn 6 lightbomb and hope your opponent is running very aggressive minions (hint: he's probably going to survive a lightbomb with deathrattles or midrange tempo-accelerators like Murloc Knight or Voidcaller).

Maybe priests will figure out a curve that lets them contain tempo decks while having a plan for control but that isn't likely under the ""classic"" priest archetype.

Dragon priest on the other hand is a big deal and definitely a top-10 deck but IMO other tempo style decks edge it out. A perfect draw is really scary and extremely hard to stop, but the occasionally awkwardness of dragon synergy means that those ""perfect"" curves don't come out as often as you like... I find myself often losing just a little bit of an advantage every game when I'm forced to hold one dragon to keep Rend/Corruptor effects available...

I still play Dragonpriest from time to time but my win rates isn't where I'd like it to be against Eboladins and Facehunters, you've got a better shot against them compared to greedy control decks but I still didn't like the very limited removal options... which are basically limited to things with 2 or less HP or 5+ attack, plenty of opponents can shut you down as you start to snowball (silence can absolutely ruin dragonpriests) but if your opponent has a better early game then you're just praying for an AOE topdeck because once you're behind as Dragon Priest life can get very painful. Buffs/Heals let you make incredible trades but when your boards empty and your opponent has minions, you have to drop your buffs from the get-go and won't get any benefit from your hero power until you get something to stick on board.

Unfortunately while your minions can get big, they aren't that sticky so too often I have games with a weak opener and rely on technicians/guardians to try and establish presence only to find them getting removed every turn and the game quickly becomes unwinnable.

Patron one-shots from an empty board are something that happens Turn 10+ and can't really apply the same level of pressure that miracle did until then. 

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills in these posts. Two days in a row of CONTROL WARRIOR LETS PATRON WARRIOR MILL THROUGH HIS ENTIRE DECK AND RETAIN ALL THE PIECES NECESSARY FOR OTK ON TURN 12 OR SOMETHING. Some decks stomp others and control warrior is one of those decks that can just let patrons assemble that combo more reliably than almost any other class. Control is a class that can consistently rack up 25+ in armor but as a trade-off does not offer any threats until late game, Patron is a class that (if it knows the game is gonig to be a slow roll) save critical components for a massive OTK after milling its entire deck and getting Tharussian out for a turn. 

Thousands of ladder games since BRM and I've almost never gotten the ""ok this is out of control"" vibe from Patron and I've played since beta. The patron either tries to win mid-game with patrons which isn't that hard to deal with if you manage your hand properly, or they save it all for late-game OTK in which case you have like 12 turns to kill them... hardly unreasonable IMO.",2015-08-14 14:11:22+00:00,cu2rw7d,2.0,t1_cu22ya9,59089.0,hearthstone
1154,"I don't understand the logic of this. You let a combo deck filter through their ENTIRE DECK to assemble all ideal cards you would want for this combo. You managed to let him get through his entire deck without pressuring out a single execute.

At the point where your opponent has gone to fatigue and not used a single execute or whirlwind, you REALLY should know that dropping sludge belcher is just going to feed those berserkers. 

What's dumb is this isn't even unique to warrior. Half of the classes can assemble insane damage combos from an empty board if you give them 10 mana, a choice of 9 cards from their deck, and a turn from Tharussian. The only difference is that this particular combo requires your opponent to help set you up.

Freeze mage does this to every class except warrior. Alexstrasa's you down to 15 health, then drops their Tharussian'd Fireball+Fireball+Frostbolt+Ice Lance+Ice lance combo to ruin you even if you destroyed Alex and dropped an antique healbot.

I run a Warlock deck that throws out 2 mana arcane golem, 0 mana power overwhelming x2, 0 mana abusive sergeant x2, and 4 mana faceless x2 for 48 damage from hand for 7 cards and 1 turn of Tharussian. Only difference is in this shot he wouldn't have even had those taunts since the deck runs almost pure removal.

There's also the infinite damage mage combo which also requires your opponent to basically let you play through 90% of your hand. 

The only thing making patron warrior more consistent than these decks is that it has a mid-game win condition too but except under rare circumstances you're still forced to go for one or the other... the Patron mid-game victory requires a full commitment from your hand and if you do that and fail, you won't have what you need (except under rare circumstances) to pull off a crazy frothing combo. 

I haven't even played Patron Warrior since April and they've been relatively rare on ladder since then and when I do I never get the impression I'm playing a broken deck. I treat it like freeze mage, if I let them get comfortable and mill through their deck then I have 0% chance of winning. ",2015-08-13 21:03:25+00:00,cu21afr,2.0,t1_cu1u1ni,10548.0,hearthstone

1168,"I'm pretty disappointed to see the top 8 or so comments to this completely advancing the conspiracy theory here.

Yet not one person has mentioned that this guy's brother booked a ticket to LA because he was convinced Michael was experiencing a drug-fueled manic episode that had happened before... with the intent of bringing him to Vermont to dry out, and was so concerned upon seeing his behavior in-person that he was pushing for an intervention with their elder brother, at which point Michael snuck away from the apartment at night.

And as others have pointed out, Michael drove a Mercedes, which wasn't among the cars with this vulnerability, and it didn't have the kind of wireless access that would even make such a hijacking possible. 

The only argument left is that the government ""tapped"" his car with additional equipment (like the 2013 stuff discussed in this article) that would let them hack it remotely. 

Even then you can use the same kind of Occam's Razor logic to eliminate that possibility, just like the 9/11 truther stuff. Sneaking a computer onto someone's car for the purpose of crashing it and killing them carries far more risks than all the other alternative available to a discrete assassin. What if Michael, realizing that someone had seized control of his car, simply rolled out and survived his injuries and/or the device used to hack the car survived the crash. It would also be a fairly immense undertaking to develop that kind of code just for that particular make/model of vehicle and... if that level of control is even possible in that make/model... to have it planted and then exercise real-time control in a way that would ensure a lethal car crash. Now you're looking at the kind of money and manpower we would spend on killing an ISIS/AlQaeda leader, but instead its just a journalist who made the military/intelligence agencies look bad. Even if that was the case, hijacking the car like that has way too many weaknesses... what if he takes the car in for an inspection (he was worried about government surveillance) and the mechanic/investigator notices that there's a murder device attached to his car's computers. At that point you've turned a damaging story about John Brennan into one of the biggest stories of the century where a US intelligence agency tried to murder a U.S. journalist on U.S. soil using unprecedented tactics. Tactics that leave a significant chance for failure that could leave behind evidence that would almost exclusively point to a US agency as being responsible (who else would have the time, resources, and motivation to secretly develop and attach such a device to his car?). 

At the point where this kind of assassination is something that would ever be seriously considered, it's infinitely wiser just to have someone go shoot the guy in a ""home invasion"", ""botched robbery"", or ""suicide"" that can't be tied back to the highest levels of government and would probably yield a much higher chance of success. 

Or maybe the dude's own brother knows him better than Reddit and was correct that this guy was on drugs and suffering a manic episode (or maybe his brother is Illumanati!!!) and that such an assassination method is absurdly risky and overly complex and this is just fodder for people to see something where they want to see something simply because there's no way to prove a negative here (i.e. that the government WASN'T behind this crash).
