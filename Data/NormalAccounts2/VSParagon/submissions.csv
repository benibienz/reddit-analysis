When William shakes Dolores out of her memory, they are standing on the buried town, William is human and can't have his reality distorted like the hosts can, and the Board Representative confirmed that ""Ford has dug up a town on the fringes of the park"". The only conclusion is that William is not in the ""present"" timeline. 

This is a very strong indicator what William = MIB given the other signs we've seen, but something is still amiss even if that theory is true. I can confidently say after Episode 8 that we have seen Dolores in William's timeline more than we have seen her in any other capacity. Yet it makes absolutely no sense to dedicate so much screen time to a timeline for the sole purpose of going ""Ah-hah we got you! William is the MIB!"" in Episode 9 or 10. There has to be relevance to that story beyond giving nuance to the MIB's backstory. It seems obvious to say this, but whatever Dolores (in William's timeline) ends up doing in the next 2 episodes is going to be very important for the story and yet in order to be truly important, her actions would have to resonate in the present storyline. There are two ways for that to happen:

1) We finish the William + Dolores story with some important revelation. We then see Dolores ""wake up"" with this freshly recalled memory and she uses that knowledge to affect the present. This is the weaker theory in my opinion since it would require jumping us back to Dolores fleeing the ranch and she suddenly has to end up somewhere relevant to the present story (which is closing in on Wyatt). It would just seem too forced, it would be too jarring, and it just seems like a clumsy way to make such a huge portion of what the viewer has witnessed relevant to the ""present"" plotline. 

2) Dolores was already tripping out when we saw her flee the ranch, at that point she began to relive a past memory, the one she shared with William decades ago. Remember that Arnold is guiding Dolores on this journey, and we've seen his ability to influence the physical world (guiding Dolores to a hidden gun, speaking directly to the hosts and compelling them to do things). It doesn't seem to be too crazy to suggest that Arnold's interference has also prevented QA from noticing or stopping Dolores's break from her loop. If William is just a vivid memory to her, but not actually with her, Dolores would certainly be acting crazy to any observer, but with Arnold pulling the strings and hosts being able to selectively perceive their reality, it's not out of the question that Dolores is truly alone. Alternatively, the tin foil version would be that William isn't a mere memory but rather is a host that was designed for the purpose of awakening Dolores's memories by retracing the steps of a journey they made 30 years ago when William was a guest. 

This theory has other support too. In Episode 8 we saw three fascinating views of the ""original"" town. First, we see the original town deserted and lifeless but also unblemished and in good condition. Then we see a clear shift in perspective we see shift into Dolores's ""mind"" where we see part of her past, then we shift again out of the hallucination into a ""reality"" where the town is buried. Out of those three scenes I believe that:

1) The unblemished town is the real and present world that the rest of the story is taking place in. We know that Ford has dug up the town, but he isn't quite done with his narrative so the town isn't populated yet.

2) Being at this place triggers Dolores's memory of the original town, this is clearly a memory.

3) We come ""back"" to William and Dolores but everything is different. It is jarring for the viewer but its also letting us experience the same confusion and bewilderment that Dolores is experiencing. Dolores saw the original town in the present reality (unearthed for Ford's narrative) and it triggered not only a memory of the massacre there but also a memory of the last time she ""awoke"" from the massacre, when she was with William 30 years ago and the town was buried. This is the same sort of re-tracing of her path that has gone on since she fled the ranch. 

She has had to reconcile the real present with the memories she has been reliving, and that never became more difficult than when she's staring at a town that was buried in her memories of William. Now that we know William simply doesn't exist in the present, this seems like the most sensible way to connect past Dolores with present Dolores. 

If you're skeptical of this theory, I'd like to hear how past Dolores is going to affect the present story.",westworld,"Dolores is in the present, William is in the past",https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5e59gl/dolores_is_in_the_present_william_is_in_the_past/

This episode the board representative said that Ford had ""dug up an old town on the fringe of the park"".

This episode we also saw that town as Dolores and William come across it. Initially we see an empty town which triggers Dolores's memory of her past there along with the hallucinations/flashbacks of people getting murdered. 

Then she snaps out of it and is standing on the ruins of that town with William.

This raises fundamental questions about what time period they are in:

1) The town they initially saw appears to represent its ""present"" version, unearthed and restored, but depopulated and empty.

2) The camera rotates behind Dolores's head to then show what she was seeing, the town full and populated as it had been in the past.

3) Upon snapping out of it, we see the town when it had been buried and forgotten. 

/#1 is the most intriguing to me. Why did we see the town in its deserted form, with the camera play STRONGLY suggesting that this was ""un-hallucinated"" version that likely currently exists for Ford's new narrative, when subsequent scenes make an equally strong case that they are actually in the past?

- Garrison just felt way too grindy/high maintenance

- The PvP zone was an utter joke, like disgustingly bad for a team that's been doing this for over a decade

- The ranked PvP was just miserable as a rogue (my main since vanilla launch), not only was rogue completely undesireable, but people expected me to having a ton of achievements immediately. Everyone wanted me to link some old RBG/Arena achievements from prior xpacs I didn't even play.

On Illos, reaper is almost mandatory for me, though the resurgence of McCree picks might make me reconsider. 

On Numbani defense, symmetra is an autopick on the first point (all the approaches are long and narrowish, I can usually get my fastest teleporters on this map and its not uncommon to win on the first point there). 

I also like Bastion when the enemy isn't using Roadhog on Lijang's control center since I find my flanks to be easier to secure, my opponent forced to fight in my optimal range (rarely have to deal with getting poked down by Junkrat/Widow), and its uncommon enough that by the time the enemy team adjusts their comp to deal with it... you're at 100%.

1) Beat the gym with 100% success rate because 6 pokemon pre-selected to counter the Gym's 2-4 pokemon will always win (also the gym's Pokemon attack slower, can be dodged, have predictable AI, etc.).

2) Eventually the gym is defeated, yay! You move in your best Pokemon due to the 1 Pokemon limit.

3) Either it immediately falls (who's going to lose 6v1 against your new gym?) or if you get lucky some nearby friendlies will bump its prestige up to 3-4 and you get some jerk who drops in their CP20 magicarp (the only reason you benefit from Gyms is by keeping GREAT pokemon parked there, holding onto all your decent Pokemon and dumping your trash in gyms doesn't benefit you at all (you're saving your best Pokemon to attack other gyms so you can do what exactly?

4) If by some miracle your gym hasn't been defeated or filled with magicarp within a few minutes, your team can potentially make it quite strong. Hitting level 6+ and keeping a frightening lineup. However gyms hit a natural cap at this point. In order to ""train"" the gym, friendlies have to beat your gym with a single Pokemon (I have no idea why, seems like bad design).

5) Now even the strongest gyms will rapidly begin to ""decay"". In order to pick away at your prestige, all opposing players have to do (and by virtue of having 3 teams, &gt;50% of players will be opposing you at all times) is beat SOME of your gym's pokemon in order to drop your gym's prestige.

I posted about it in my thread with an exact description of the issue:

""Leaving a group in the DZ should remove you from the instance. There are already plenty of groups use groups to get their friend into an instance and then have him leave so he can grief people trying to stop his rogue friends. Standing in front of the rogue players to bait the attackers to go rogue themselves""

This was not a difficult issue to detect or notice, and that was in closed beta. Now we're almost one month past release, no patch this week, and I continue to step into Dark Zones with ~8 players doing coordinated griefing across 3-4 groups they've organized for the express purpose of exploiting DZ mechanics. This morning I stepped out of the safe house into 6 rogues and two non-rogues making it impossible to fight them. They didn't even try to hide it, they were talking in-game voice and explicitly giving one another orders on where the non-rogues should stand/rush toward people in order to block shots and bait people into going rogue themselves. 

I get that people want to compare base stats and want to have a better way to play with underleveled friends, but for the already tenuous endgame experience... junk like this is the last straw for trying to enjoy level 30.

Here's what I've seen in the past 24 hours, all PvP numbers without even resorting to cheese tactics like smart cover stacking or the damage signature:

- Sticky bomb doing 84k damage
- M1A headshot crits for 115k (my m1a has a 100% chance to crit on the first shot after a pulse)
- M44 headshot crits for 90k
- Vectors doing about 150k DPS
- Shotguns doing about 130k DPS

These TTK's are low even for pure shooters, let alone a cover-based shooter+RPG where stats, builds, talents, and skills are supposed to play a role and people can go rogue on you at any time... and in other shooters you at least know who your enemy is and can take practical steps to defend yourself. Right now the entire metagame is just blowing away the other player before they even know they're under attack. These numbers don't even account for stuff like explosive ammo either. I have 75k HP and over 50% armor mitigation and well-geared Vector users still melt me faster than any SMG archetype I've seen from other shooters I've played.

These numbers are completely out of whack compared to the average player health pool of 65-85k. Even if you were to gimp yourself by stacking to 100k, you'll still get one-shot by a geared-out sniper or melt in under a second against a point blank Vector.

For the first 3 weeks I was bored in the DZ because NOBODY was going Rogue. Now that I'm seeing more rogues, I'm bored because either the rogues are killing me before I even get an indicator that I'm under attack (last time I died, it was someone who walked up to me with a vector and I was down in roughly a quarter-second... before the Rogue ""gong"" went off, I don't even die that fast to automatic weapon in FPS's like Destiny, CoD, Battlefield, etc...) or I'm killing rogues/going rogue on people who I kill in a single shot or mow down in a half-second. The only thing that breaks up the monotony of insta-kills is Survivor Link, which is essentially an iwin button if one side has it and the other doesn't... which is probably part of why people focus on offense so that they can blow someone away before they can even hope to reach for the 'T' key.

The solution has two simple parts:

1) **Increase the PVP damage reduction**. An obvious fix that doesn't screw with PvE balance. The damage reduction worked fine in beta/early levels because everyone had shit gear and pure stamina scaled better than pure firearms. However now we have access to a ton of crit bonuses on all our gear and weapons, which allows DPS to scale exponentially higher than stamina and armor (which is capped at 65% anyway), which brings me to #2.

2) Make the headshot and crit multipliers additive instead of multiplicative. In PvE I bodyshot for 65k, headshot for 190k, and crit headshot for 570k. See where I'm going with this? Marksman weapons and SMG's are god-tier right now because they both heavily synergize with high crit stats. If the bonuses were additive my crit headshots would do 325k instead, I offer more in-depth discussion here: http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php...MULTIPLICATIVE


There are other changes that need to happen, certain weapon categories or specific weapons completely outclass their peers (*cough* m44). Pulse is essentially a ""do everything"" skill that plays way too many roles well. The focus of pulse should be on the intelligence/tactical aspect of knowing where your enemies are, with a modest damage bonus. Instead, for reasons discussed above, pulse will double (or triple) your damage for a long 25 second window. These changes can come later though, right now it's abundantly clear that Damage v. Survivability is way too heavily in favor of damage. Plenty of people are being turned off to the DZ because of this imbalance and I can't blame them, being able to instagib players makes it way too easy to go rogue without the risk of your victim being able to fight back or stall until help arrives.

I hope this change happens soon, I would really not wait another 3 weeks for Massive to roll out a fix to another obvious DZ problem.

M44/SRS headshots become a guaranteed one-shot kill against other players and hitting over 1,000,000 DPS with an SMG is just a natural part of your progress (while it won't one-shot other players, it will down them in under half a second).

Most players here haven't reached this level of gear yet, but after a week of BK farming, most aren't far off either. Let me illustrate why this is an issue:

M44 = 200% headshot damage bonus (scope/talent to hit 200%)

Crit damage bonus vs. Pulsed Enemy = 150% crit damage bonus

Now say my bodyshots do about 70k damage with the usual pulse damage bonus + booster shot. 

Currently that means my headshots will do 70 x 2.5 x 3 = 525,000. Sheeeit. 

Throw in tactical link if you want to gawk at 1m+ crits. These numbers aren't hard to reach either. Plenty of people can stack firearms and hit much, much harder. These numbers are possible with a modest 2400 firearms. Part of a perfectly well-rounded build that doesn't make you into a glass cannon or a skill-power gimp. 

Meanwhile if the bonus were additive, you get:

70k x (1.5+2+1) = 315,000

315k seems like a much more reasonable number. You still have a reason to build these stats, but you don't start hitting ridiculous damage multipliers that kind of break the game. This would reduce the benefit of crit damage and headshot damage, which helps reign in the game's two most OP weapon classes: SMG's which can easily hit 100% crit chance during pulse, and MM's which offer very high headshot bonuses.

This is an RPG, it should involve some level of tactical decision making. With the current system, you basically have Call of Duty where the TTK against other players is &lt;1 second if you can click on heads (which isn't hard this game's style of gunplay).

I heard multiple people talking about how SMG's were the weakest weapon class. Shotguns outclassed them at really close range and AR's beat them at longer ranged.

Then people realized, oh my god there are stats in this game besides firepower, and the whole crit synergy thing took off and now SMG's are virtually mandatory for an ideal build. 

Now I hear the same thing about the bolt-action snipers. The M1A has to be toned down, but too many people seem to think that ""merely"" buffing the bolt-actions will make the M1A balanced. The bolt-actions are already at broken-tier status along with the M1A if you know what you're doing.

The M44/SRS gets moderately more damage than the M1A at the expense of a big hit to fire rate and mag size. But the catch is: does fire rate or mag size matter when your target dies in one shot? 

Currently without any special effort or obsession with firearms, you can crit for over 500k just using pulse and booster shot/smart cover (smart cover will actually put you closer to 600-700k). Basic squad tactics like stacking smart cover will get you 1m+ as an ordinary matter. Tactical Link on top means 2,000,000+ damage per shot. 

In incursions this might not be a big deal if enemies are frolicking about with 10m+ HP, but current DZ and Challenge content means that will rarely need more than 2 shots to finish a job. More importantly, in the Dark Zone, critting for over 500k against NPC's means that other players are also guaranteed one-shot kills. 

At least currently getting 500k+ headshots requires great gear and focusing your stats. Buff the M44/SRS any more and suddenly everyone who can master the feat of clicking on your head during an extraction will have the ability to 1-shot you.

IMO the Mk.20 represents a ""balanced"" marksman weapon while the m1a needs the hardest adjustment, the bolt-actions should also be addressed.

The best solution for weapon balance in general would be to make crit damage and headshot damage an ADDITIVE bonus instead of a multiplicative. I'll address that in another post though.",thedivision,"""Buff the M44 and SRS"" - Are you people CRAZY?",https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/4bi26r/buff_the_m44_and_srs_are_you_people_crazy/

Anyone who had a few hours this weekend and knew about the Bullet King could set themselves up with a perfect SMG/AR, kneepads, mask, and backpack along with the best weapon mods. 

The ONLY loot hurdle left is DZ 50 and having HE Division Tech, the former is another mindless PVE grind on a broken system (no rogues to interfere with your XP farm, you get the best XP killing DZ1-2 purples) but the latter is the one thing that still functions somewhat as intended:

1) Its rare

2) You actually have to roam the Dark Zone and enter DZ5-6 if you want the best chance at this item

3) There's currently no well known way to cheese farm these

Edit, almost forgot:
5) It also drops from enemies and in my purely anecdotal experience, 31+ enemies drop it more than the DZ1-2 stuff.

Here's how the argument has gone for months:

""Stop asking for better rogue rewards, the reward is the loot you get! How hard is that to understand?!""

Here's why this statement is fatally flawed:

1) When you die as a rogue you lose an hour or more of XP grinding. 

2) Someone who cares about loot will want to maintain a high DZ level to access the best loot, the best blueprints, etc. Unlike the Phoenix vendor (who resets weekly) this vendor resets every few days, so nobody wants to be lose a few levels going rogue only to find out their dream weapon is on sale and they have to grind DZ NPC's for hours to make up for the XP they lost going rogue. 

3) Because of #1 and #2. A player wanting the best gear will not go rogue on their main character. **Stealing from another player what you can grind in an 8 minute named NPC rotation is not worth risking hours of XP, credits, and keys.**

4) Thefore, players who care about gear AND pvp will simply keep a ""safe"" DZ50+ main who can buy all the best items, hold all the top blueprints, and put all the gear on a level 30 ""alt"". At level 30, aside from the base upgrades, everything about your character is embodied in your items. A level 30 alt becomes a top-tier death machine with a few clicks on the stash. These 30's will then go and do what neither the pro-PVP or anti-PVP crowd want to see, mindlessly grief and murder everyone they see. Welcome to the DayZone. Even killing these assholes will only give the faintest satisfaction before it turns to ash in your mouth when you realize that killing them was literally a 30 second inconvenience. They can dish out infinitely more grief than you can fling back at them, they're already in the best gear, and they expect to die.

5) What about people not dedicated to making a ""PvP asshole"" alt? Well they do what they're doing now. It's infinitely more profitable to focus on Division Tech, Phoenix Credits, and DZ XP than waste your time on the 1/1000 chance that some random extractor is holding a high-end drop that's actually better than the 31 blueprint stuff you've already made. 

6) Lastly, focusing the PvP on extraction ambushes alone is not enough. While I agree that being on-edge at extractions makes the Dark Zone a better place, in terms of PvP it produces the absolute lowest quality.  You can defend the system until you're blue in the face but at the end of the day, extracting involves channeling for two seconds in a wide open area, outside of cover. From the closed beta to endgame 30 content, its always been effortless to murder another player who's extracting. The extraction ambusher has every incentive in the world to hit you at your weakest while they're at their strongest. 9/10 times this results in a one-sided boring encounter. One dude/group completely blows away the other dude/group and extracts on the chopper in literally less than 5 seconds total. The ambusher gets to cash in their reward IMMEDIATELY. This produces the worst aspect of extraction ambush gameplay, the ambushers have absolutely NO reason to fight anyone. Once they get the loot out, they will be sitting on an ~80 second rogue timer. In this situation, you have to be INSANE to actually fight anyone. Shooting at the people who are hunting you will freeze your timer or multiply it by 2x, 3x, or 4x+. This leads to a terrible cycle where the extraction ambusher shoots an extractor in the back, and then runs away so that bounty hunters can proceed to try and shoot the ambusher in the back. 

Everything that oozes quality about this game's combat utterly disappears when you're just chasing someone and emptying your gun into their back. Cover-based combat, tactical superiority, carefully molding your build to form synergies between your stats and talents... all of it pretty much goes out the window when your just taking pot shots at a rogue while he constantly tumble-heals around the map running out his timer.

Going rogue has to entail incentives for people to play on their main (Credits, XP, Blueprints, and Crafting mats cannot be transferred efficiently, raw loot can), and it should entail incentives for people to stand and fight. Everyone agrees we should let Massive make the call on HOW to do this. I'm just pointing out until there's a loot overhaul, making rogue rewards exclusively about loot and punishments solely about XP/Credits... all you're doing is laying the foundation for a grief machine.

We did not go into the Dark Zone expecting or wanting a mindless PvE farmfest where other players are just background decorations. This issue has nothing to do with how fast you hit 30.** 

Every day on this subreddit I read, ""Those nolifers deserve what they get, I only have a few hours free time and I'm still loving this game at level 18"". Right now its one of the top posts on this subreddit.

These people are entirely missing the point. Almost EVERYONE here enjoyed the campaign from 1-30. It was good, we all had fun and felt like we got what we expected.

However many of us (especially the hardcore sort) expected to do something besides grind NPC's till our eyes bleed once we hit 30. We aren't complaining that we've burned through the content. I didn't sit there at the end of Xcom 2 or Last of Us and write long posts complaining that there wasn't more to do - even when I burnt through those games in a few sittings. 

We are complaining because we expected some PvP. There's no other way to put it. Countless games have demonstrated lifespans that extend into hundreds or even thousands of hours off of relatively straightforward PvP. In a cover-based shooter there are only so many ways that PvE mobs can continue to surprise and challenge you in entertaining ways. In PvP your opponents can push and challenge you in new ways even after hundreds of hours played. 

Furthermore, just because we wanted PvP doesn't mean we wanted a kill-on-sight deathmatch. These sorts of free-for-alls can get boring almost as fast as PvE grinding. All the strategy, build-making, stat tweaking, etc. that can give PvP an almost eternal life goes out the window when you're just blindly shooting at everyone you see.

Instead we were promised a hybrid system that would only extend, not extinguish, the entertainment offered by PvP. Because we wouldn't be sure who our enemies are, who could be trusted, etc... we saw the possibility for engaging PvP with another level of depth and atmosphere. No matter what sort of PvP expectations you carried into the Dark Zone, we can all agree that we had SOME kind of expectation that PvP would be happening.

For those of you who went in hoping/expecting for 0 pvp. Well you got your wish, but there isn't a rational mind out there that would argue that the Dark Zone shouldn't have any rogues in it. 90% of the map and content is there for people who want to PvE solo or in a squad. The Dark Zone is made special ONLY for its rogue system. The players who seem to think its acceptable for the sole unique mechanic of the Dark Zone to end up as an irrelevant afterthought can feel free to enjoy the other 90% of the map.

The Dark Zone was SUPPOSED to be distinguished by the presence of PvP. It's clear that the developers intended for the Dark Zone to present additional risk that the PvE content could not. The high level of Phoenix coins and level-31 loot indicates that the Dark Zone was supposed to be dangerous in ways that even challenge missions could not be. 

Yet that hasn't happened. PvP has not materialized. Enough people have hit 30 that you can't write it off as a fluke. Massive's rapid nerf to DZ drops and 80% nerf to Phoenix coins show how wrong their estimates were for Dark Zone risk. Instead of always looking over our shoulders, getting into standoffs with other agents, hiding from larger/stronger groups, or hunting down rogues/going rogue... we spent all that time grinding up NPC's with industrial efficiency. 

Whether we end up in this situation after playing 26 hours in 2 days, or 26 hours in 2 weeks, it is irrelevant. The Dark Zone was not pitched as a future DLC, or some silly minigame. It was pitched as a ""centerpiece"" (Dev's words) to the endgame that would be a finished product included with the base game. The Dark Zone has not met those expectations and instead only yielded a PvE grind that lacks almost any redeeming values. It's just shooting up the same infinitely respawning camps with no hint of PVP or caution for unknown agents. This is not what we wanted, and we're hoping that Massive takes appropriate steps to remedy it.

So please, stop beating the ""nolifer"" strawman. ",thedivision,Time played is NOT the issue. The issue is we expected more than a pure PVE game.,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/4ajwdc/time_played_is_not_the_issue_the_issue_is_we/

So here it is:

I've poured my heart into trying to improve the end-game. Look through my post history and you'll see a long string of very detailed posts about the endgame's flaws and potential solutions. Most of these were ignored and yet my predictions continue to come true time and time again.

My last prediction was that Massive would nerf some aspect of Dark Zone rewards and the players would riot because the hardcore grinders already got the ""best stuff"" before Massive put up a speed bump for everyone else. 

Well, here we are. I won't give detailed explanations for WHY things are the way they are, my previous threads do that in excruciating detail. Instead I will simply advance a compilation of my suggestions and see what the community thinks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) **Remove Phoenix Credits from the Dark Zone entirely.** Their presence their only obfuscates the purpose of Phoenix Credits and the Dark Zone. Phoenix credits are primarily used to re-roll stats on high-end gear or to purchase blueprints for level 31 high-end gear.  These blueprints are currently all but a guarantee that you will get a best-in-slot item for whatever slot that blueprint fills. The PvE system is acceptable at the moment. It needs a lot of fleshing out and difficulty tweaking (Challenge mode goes from incredibly challenging to laughably easy when you stack crowd control skills in your squad), but the smaller issues with challenge missions and rewards are completely eclipsed by Dark Zone issues.

Strangely, the Dark Zone offers its own high-end blueprints and gear on-par with what your base's Phoenix vendor sells. Yet despite being locked behind a DZ-50 requirement, the longest grind currently in the game, these items ALSO require phoenix credits to purchase. The only advantage to hitting DZ 50 is that you basically get another Phoenix vendor. Typically by the time players hit this mark, the advantage of a second Phoenix vendor is almost non-existent. This odd state of affairs leads me to my 2nd point.

2) **Turn the Dark Zone's Phoenix vendor into someone who sells the level 31 high-ends for a LARGE amount of DZ credits** (which will still require a high DZ rank to purchase). This kills two birds with one stone. It gets rid of the issue where Dark Zone players need to get hundreds of Phoenix credits but only get 2-3 from killing a boss, meanwhile they're sitting on 100,000-200,000+ DZ credits with absolutely nothing worth spending it on. 

3) **Rework DZ sub-zones so that the rewards scale with the difficulty**. A DZ1 purple looter who dies in 2 headshots should not give anything close to what a DZ6 gold offers... yet currently they both give almost identical XP/Credits. The difference shouldn't be so incredible that you've got every Dark Zone player camping a spawn in DZ6, but it should still offer a meaningful difference to players who take on greater challenges. 

4) **Immediately begin work on item level 32-34 equipment.** The hard truth here is that the endgame loot system is already mortally wounded at item level 30-31. Many players have put together perfect 31 high-end sets with the flood of Phoenix credits that was available after release, and many more are just a couple items from perfection as well. The only way to fairly resolve this situation is to quickly introduce 32-34 loot that coincides with the other fixes in this thread so that the challenge/effort required in earning this gear makes sense. Enemy difficulty will also have to be re-scaled to accommodate this. Putting 33-34 behind newer, more difficult content would ensure people have something to work at over the long haul but without feeling like their other equipment is inadequate. 

5) **Overhaul loot drops in the Dark Zone.** Named bosses should typically only drop one epic. Blues and Greens should be gone entirely. Named bosses should also present a greater challenge since their drops are on-par with challenge mode bosses. Give them more HP, have them spawn in waves of reinforcements, make them feel like a boss and not just an extra gold NPC in a pack that usually gets gunned down in &lt;1 minute by player squads. DZ chests should see their loot scale a little better depending on the zone it is opened in, and perhaps offer the possibility of a high-end, but maybe cut the number of epics to 1. 

6) **Make all the silly DZ10/DZ30 chests drop ammo/medkits/grenades**, and perhaps a moderate DZ credit bonus or crafting/Division Tech reward. It's an embarrassment to the developer when they make these chests only drop blues when DZ30+ players will never be equipping another blue again. 

7) **Fix the rogue system.** I'll the details to you guys, but it should be obvious that your current system is not working. It boils down to simple game theory. Each individual player wants to get decked out in great gear. Between two players each has the option of ""being friendly"" or ""going rogue"". In game theory, any option involving going rogue is a negative value decision over a large number of encounters. It's not even close. Sure there's a tiny chance that you win the rogue lottery and get a great high-end off someone and manage to survive and extract it, but generally you end up killing someone for loot that's worth about 16 crafting materials to you... while putting at risk hours of XP/Credit farming if other players manage to kill you. Everyone simply gets a better outcome for themselves if they simple keep their head down and farms NPC's.

Plus, and here's the biggest point, ambushing people at extractions, even if you can justify it being worth the time and risk, produces the absolute lowest quality PVP encounters. Yes it can add some tension, that's fine, and for that reason extraction ambushes should probably have their mechanics untouched... but to promote this form of PVP above all else is to utterly destroy the potential of the Dark Zone. Failure to correct this will invariably ruin all hope the DZ has.

Ubisoft promoted squad v. squad combat from their very first gameplay trailer to their last. Currently making the decision to attack another squad head-on (as opposed to cheesing them while they extract) falls somewhere between ""suicidal"" and ""masochistic"" and ""mentally disabled"" in terms of the psychological profile required to motivate someone to do it. 

I won't beat a dead horse with screenshots of players getting 1,700 credits for surviving a manhunt, compared to losing 100,000+ credits and hours of XP for dying, but suffice it to say that only boredom, stupidity, or grief would motivate someone to go rogue on a group outside of an extraction area. Obviously the rewards should be increased and penalties made less absurd, but not to the point that it makes sense for everyone to KOS either. People love to make the false dichotomy that either we have a PVP-free darkzone or we get a DayZ kill-on-sight grief-fest, but its definitely possible to give rogue players/squads the longshot gamble that if they manage to hold out against a manhunt, that they will not feel cheated. The punishment for dying as a rogue should surpass the reward for surviving as one, but the current ratio of 1:100 for reward:penalty so awful that nobody is going rogue but for the aforementioned boredom, stupidity, or grief. The fact that bounty hunters also get wallhacks, numerical superiority, and a shot their victim's entire loot bag, will otherwise ensure that most players stick to the non-rogue roles since as the number of rogues increases, the profitability of bounty hunting also skyrockets.  

8) **Give the players another PVP outlet in the Dark Zone.** Random events that cordon off an area of the Dark Zone for a limited period, allows players inside to attack other agents without officially ""going rogue"", and letting the event play out with squads fighting for some objective for the promise of a lucrative reward, would be excellent. Don't force us into teams or encourage us to just wildly murder everyone we see, make objectives that make sense for several different independent groups or individuals to compete for while encouraging tactics/strategy as the decisive factor. Don't make these events permanent or so common that they become the focus of the Dark Zone, but have them appear periodically to give players a chance at real head-to-head combat. 

Edit #1: **Misc. Suggestions** I've gotten from friends: Signature balance needs some work. Survivor link just outclasses the other signatures. Rework how buffs stack and prevent certain buffs from stacking in the first place. There are some broken combinations out there *cough smart cover cough*, and if they can get addressed before they get widely exploited, that would be great. Let us see how much stash space we have from the inventory screen! Challenge mode presents much harder PvE encounters than DZ6, yet DZ6 NPC's drop better loot (more epic/HE loot, and at a higher item level). Have challenge mode drop 31+ loot at the very least. 

Edit #2: **Currently there's no way to create High-End Division Tech.** High-End Divtech should be craftable from blues, and blues from greens. It's a bit silly that the DZ vendor that mirrors the Phoenix vendor not only requires Phoenix credits, but also will only let you craft 2-3 items because of how rare gold divtech is.

Stop downvoting substantive feedback that seeks to improve the game. The ""3 days"" players have reached a consensus that the endgame has serious issues and these issues are not related to the fact that we cleared the main story quickly. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hit 30 slightly less than 2 days after release. I took a couple days off work and just played away.

I enjoyed the 1-30 experience. The missions were good, the enemy AI was solid, the gunplay felt tight, and the RPG mechanics were enjoyable. 

There are many players here who think that was enough, that if you log some arbitrary number of hours into a game while having fun, you somehow lose all rights to critique the game. That somehow if ""I got my money's worth"" I should just sit down, shut up, and withhold any input, suggestions, commentary, feedback, critique, advice, or observations. 

Day after day following release, the front page flooded with memes and screenshots of pop culture references. Do I even have to point out that the top post here by a large margin is a stupid pedophilia joke older than the internet that has nothing to do with this game?

The amount of substantive feedback on the game is marginal here. The post about the Midas being broken is the only example of end-game feedback that has broken through the great wall of memes. It's utterly absurd that experienced players aren't just having their opinions dismissed, but are rabidly attacked in every post for having cleared through the content so fast by people who completely miss the point.

We did not buy this game with the goal of racking up X hours of entertainment. Many of us (especially the ""3 days"" people) bought the game because of what it promised. We were promised an end-game with the Dark Zone as the ""centerpiece"" (http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/tom-clancys-the-division-developer-shares-game-update-new-screens-ign-first). Reading about the Dark Zone is what moved this game from a ""wait and see"" title to a ""Gold edition pre-order"" for me. The players who are critiquing the endgame are justified. We aren't asking for flying mounts, MLG Doritos skins, or 100+ hours of content. We are asking for a Dark Zone/endgame experience that aligns with reasonable expectations for how that content should function given how it was promoted.

Moreover, this debate shouldn't even be about ""who has a right, who deserves what, who gets to complain"". Many players have been offering detailed discussions and feedback here on the Dark Zone and every time it gets ruthlessly shut down or ignored. This subreddit has the power to raise awareness that the forums do not. When pictures of ""laptop lines"" appeared all over the front page, it was fixed within a day. When a complaint about a certain gun hit the front page, it got an official response within hours. We have power here and yet its frustrating to see it squandered on memes and shitposting. There's a very obvious issue with Dark Zone vendors that is struggling to gain any attention despite it being a pretty huge issue for anyone who prefers the Dark Zone to ""Defend the crate from angry janitors #16"".

https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/49pwtf/literally_nobody_talking_about_broken_dz_vendors/

More concerning than that, is how the Dark Zone itself turned out. The DZ can have its moments, but it has shown itself to be a complete mess in terms of Rogue mechanics, loot drops, etc. The entire premise of the Dark Zone, the sole feature that distinguishes it from the rest of the map, is the Rogue PvP system. This is the DEFINING MECHANIC for the area that is supposed to be the CENTERPIECE of endgame content. Yet from DZ level 1-32 I have one rogue kill despite chasing every single skull I've ever had pop up on my screen. I've seen more high-end loot drops than visual sightings of a rogue player.

Some players fire back that rushing 30 is precisely the reason why I don't see rogues, but that's not how it works. Even if only 1% of players are at 30, that's still enough people to fill several Dark Zones. Nor does anyone seem to believe me when I say that my Dark Zones have plenty of players. When I went rogue out of boredom it was no different than beta, I had about 12 players upon me within minutes. Player count is not the issue. 

The issue is that end-game loot and Rogue mechanics are BROKEN. Broken means they are not functioning as intended and across the dozens of level 30 Dark Zone runs I've participated in, nothing has contradicted my experience thus far. The two issues are actually somewhat related. The fact that you are rewarded more for clearing a gold NPC camp in 2 minutes than you are for beating a challenge-mode mission in 45 minutes can be somewhat explained by the fact that the Dark Zone is supposed to be more dangerous. But it's not. I have yet to lose -ANY- gear in the level 30 dark zone. Everyone quickly figured out that murdering someone for a random sack of mediocre purples meant risking HOURS of earned XP/Credits/Keys. Even though neither XP or Credits are that important right now, the sheer ease of obtaining purples meant that it would be stupid to take that risk when you could just go slaughter a few NPC's and fill your bag with purples too. To top it off, phoenix credits (the most valuable end-game currency) only drop off NPC's and not players. Even the most ruthless, efficient rogue in the world will not get high-end gear as fast as the NPC farmer who walks out of the Dark Zone with enough credits to buy 4-5 high-end blueprints. On top of broken rogue mechanics, the sheer volume of loot in the Dark Zone borders on obscene. It is entirely possible to fill your bag with purples/HE's in under 5 minutes once you know where the chests are. **When inspecting/comparing your endgame loot takes more time and effort than it actually took to earn it, you know there is a problem.** The DZ is not dangerous, it's not a challenge, its an NPC loot farm that sprays you down with so many easy epics/phoenix credits/HE's that progression just feels pointless.

Like I said, I enjoyed the ride from 1-30, but players are allowed to give feedback on the endgame that we were promised. What harm is there in letting this feedback get upvoted? Why are so many of you militantly downvoting anything that suggests this game isn't perfection incarnate? 

It's frustrating because anyone can see the huge potential the dark zone has, but instead its become such a mindless PvE loot-harvest operation that even Free2Play RPG's would blush with how rote and effortless it feels. If you're reading this as a level 12, instead of saying ""how dare he criticize the game so soon?"" instead think ""he might have a point, and if Ubisoft listens, then maybe the Dark Zone will be a better experience by the time I hit 30"".

The solution is straightforward, the details are not, which is why players need to have this discussion about this stuff. I'm not criticizing this game to make you feel bad or to insult your taste in games, I'm doing it because I love this game too, I see tons of potential for it, but there are huge balance issues crippling the endgame experience which need to be addressed ASAP.

45,2016-03-11 17:10:39+00:00,self.thedivision,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/49zonv/endgame_is_broken_loot_system_is_completely/,False,"The issues are obvious to anyone who's been 30 for more than a few hours:

1) Dark zone VOMITS loot at you. I laughed my ass off at the ""comprehensive"" 30 guide that was about the slowest most inefficient way to level up as possible. Here's how to get the best gear in the game:

- Walk into DZ01

- 3-shot the yellow named NPC's. Seriously, Ubisoft does not seem to grasp how scaling works endgame, even with the pittance of epics that you'll have after the last mission at 30... you will still be so much stronger than anything in DZ1-2 that its not even a challenge. **I struggled more with purple snipers at level 10 than I am with the ""all gold"" groups as a fresh 30**. 

- Collect 2 purples from every named NPC and Dark Chest in the Zone... did I mention that there is like 1 chest/named per square foot of DZ1 &amp; 2?  You can easily solo these groups and you're not competing for loot with the other agents. So everyone is just roaming around vacuuming up loot. You will easily fill your stash with 29 purples and one high-end for every hour in the Dark Zone. Within a few hours you will be wearing close to the best-stuff available. You can go up to DZ6 after an hour but the named mobs are more spread out and you can still get lvl 31 loot from DZ1-2. Either way the story is the same, easy loot. 

- No risk required! Well maybe NPC's puking up purples every time you look in their general direction would make some sense if there was an active and aggressive rogue community. Fortunately for you, there isn't! Going solo can still be risky but a mere ~60 seconds of matchmaking puts you in a group that ensures almost nobody will mess with you. Plus, the wide attitude has among players has been ""WHATS THE POINT OF GOING ROGUE?!"". There isn't. Right now the Dark Zone is like a massive open vault of containing $1 trillion, but any player can only hold $9,000 at a time. The logical, rational, and highly-incentivized approach would be to just focus on grabbing as much money as possible, getting it extracted, then rushing back for more. Why would anyone waste their time trying to hold up OTHER players for their $9,000 when it involves a ton of risk, wasted time, and no phoenix credits. The best way to get geared is just to sprint around steamrolling NPC's, if someone does kill you then you lost, at most, 15 minutes of effort (but you still keep the Phoenix credits). The rogue doesn't get phoenix credits, risks less effort, but dying means they lose around 30-45 minutes of DZ XP and Credits. It's a losing proposition to go rogue, especially when Phoenix credits are the gateway to best-in-class gear. From DZ 1-31 I hunted every rogue on my radar, players who have grouped with me can testify to that. It was annoying to them we'd be rolling in the loot and I'd see a skull pop up on radar and I'd have us all pack up and go on the chase, every-single-time. Unfortunately, its almost impossible to chase down someone with a tier-1 rogue timer before it expires and anyone who goes higher either dies or runs out the timer before I even get a visual on them. **How many rogue kills do I have at 32 after a dozen hours in the dark zone? -1-**

- Still got gaps in your gear? Good news! Because Ubisoft somehow decided that from level 15-30 players didn't need to buy Dark Zone gear, and mobs drop an insane amount of credits, once you hit DZ30 you will be drowning in DZ credits, with enough to buy 20+ purples from the Dark zone vendors!

2) Crafting = The easy-loot Yin to the Dark Zone's Yang. Maybe after extracting 100+ epics and a few highends in a couple hours isn't enough for you. Your friend found a sexy high-end assault rifle and now you're super jealous. No problem! After the Dark Zone you'll be swimming in Phoenix credits. Go buy yourself a weapon blueprint from 150-250 credits. With the HUNDREDS of epics you've looted from the Dark Zone you'll have an endless supply of crafting mats! I wanted a high-end Vector and I wasn't impressed with the first two I made so I made a third without hesitating. The cost was almost inconsequential to me, crafting for a perfect high-end weapon is easily possible within 3 hours of you hitting 30. It almost always makes more sense to for a blueprint over the real deal give how cheap blueprints are (compared to the flood of Phoenix creds you get from the DZ), and once you have the blueprint you are basically guaranteed a top-tier item for that slot. 

3) Challenge loot is as underwhelming as the DZ loot is overwhelming. The daily-challenges give ~30 phoenix credits and high-ends. This is actually pretty balanced for an end-game loot system. The high-end is not guaranteed to be good and it might be for a slot you already have a high-end for (yay 3 gold body armors last night, all giving -13% healing cooldowns, variety!). The phoenix credit income for challenges is actually what you'd expect from an end-game currency, doing 3-5 daily challenges would get you a high-end blueprint and if you played consistently over a long period then you'd amass an impressive assortment of gear and blueprints. However, this slow &amp; steady approach is completely overwhelmed by the loot hose in the Dark Zone. 

Epilogue: I managed to hit 30 because I took a couple days off work. Yesterday evening I had my baby-30 and just a few hours to get him gear. When I went to bed I was wearing all lvl 31 purples or high-ends with 100k+ in DPS/HP and 23k skill power. My friends and I were already getting bored of the Dark Zone so we intentionally went rogue just to try and squeeze some fun out of the place. We ended up with a massive lynch mob chasing us (lol being the only rogues across all 6 Darkzones). It was still easy to run around the back-alleys and subways healspamming and tumbling, but one of our group DC'd and died. I got maybe 20% of a DZ level (for the ~10 kills between us all), a couple thousand credits, and a smattering of bad purples (nobody hauling great purples/highends would ever get close to us of course). The guy who died lost 2 DZ levels, 45,000 credits, and all of his keys and loot. Even though we did it ""for funsies"", I still never want to go rogue again if it means losing over an hour of XP if I die... in exchange for something I could earn in less than a minute PVE farming the DZ. 

These are issues that need to be addressed NOW. A broken SMG (seriously how does Ubisoft spend so much money and time on a game and let something like this into the loot? Anyone who's played an RPG before could tell you within 2 seconds that this was game-breaking) is literally the only balance-related issue on the front-page and it got immediate attention from Massive. If people continue to bury their heads in the sand and just upvote memes, this problem is going to continue to cripple the end-game potential.

I gotta say I'm loving The Division but I'm not loving what I'm seeing in the forums and subreddit. Ubisoft deserves a pat on the back but I'm seeing countless real issues with the game (including serious bugs) get buried in place of dispersing more memes, ""protips"", and in-game pop culture references. None of those things are going to improve the Division, and if you think that the game is so utterly perfect that critique is stupid, well don't be surprised if you're bored or disappointed in a month. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway, on to the substance, I'll start with the biggest issue in the Dark Zone:

**THERE IS NO PVP**

I'm sitting at 30/23 right now and I've killed one rogue in 8 hours of Dark Zone and I have been in 0 firefights. When I said there is no PVP I was being a little facetious. PVP does exist in one form right now and boils down to this:

1) Player/Group effortlessly guns down a player when they try to extract and then steals+extracts the loot within just a few seconds.

2) The now-rogue player/group immediately flee because there's 0 incentive to stand and fight. 

3) The group either escapes through an incredibly unfun/cheesy escape technique that involves using zone-changes to hide your rogue status and/or subway or backalley run+dive+healathons that make it impossible to effectively chase someone down OR they are still new/bad and they get gunned down as they try to run. 

**This isn't really PVP. Both the rogue and the bounty hunters are literally just shooting someone in the back and the people being shot have literally 0 incentive/ability to shoot back and every incentive to just haul ass out of there.**

For those of us who wanted PVP, I'm sure that none of us wanted to play ""NYC Ass-Shooting Simulator 2016"". In terms of rogue mechanics I think that the system for people who ""kill for loot"" is OK. A skilled rogue can murder+extract loot several times an hour and the reward is comparable to what pure PVE might offer. But here's the problem that plenty of people seem to miss:

**THE BEST INCENTIVES FOR GOING ROGUE PROMOTE THE ABSOLUTE WORST ROGUE GAMEPLAY.**

As I've stated, there's absolutely nothing fun about someone unloading a Saiga into your back mid-extraction or being a bounty hunter chasing the Saiga douche as he rolls down an endless maze of back-alleys/subway tunnels (who's bright idea was it to let people heal and roll at the same time?) with 0 hope of catching/cornering him before the 90 second timer has passed. 

**Those of us who wanted PVP in the Division wanted FIREFIGHTS.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how do we fix this situation?  

People don't need any more incentives to kill for loot, but they need more incentives to actually fight, kill, stand their ground, and *attempt* to survive a manhunt. 

Manhunts do not offer good loot for the rogues. No bounty hunter in their right mind is going to charge toward 4 skulls if they're hauling anything high-end or great rolls on an epic. The penalties for the rogues if they lose are crippling. Tens of thousands of DZ credits, a level or more of DZ rep, every DZ key you carry, even if you didn't loot it from others, and of course any items in your DZ bag. The reward, comparatively, is nothing. 

DZ credits are super easy to farm in PVE and are not that valuable end-game (partially due to the fact that DZ credits barely scale per level and past level 15 there's literally NOTHING you can spend them on, so you've got 15ish DZ levels where you're just amassing credits). There's no incentive for people to go rogue for credits, especially when, even if you have an 80% success rate as a rogue, you're going to lose more than you gain. But until DZ credits get fixed, it really can't be the way we fix the Dark Zone.

What about loot? Well we've already covered the best way to get loot, and its pretty lame. While DZ loot as a whole should get a close look (at 30 enemies vomit purples and a good rotation will get you ~2 high-ends per hour, you get as many Phoenix credits in 2 minutes of fighting as you get from ~30 minutes of Dailies) for being wayyy too generous compared to other activities, the way loot interacts with rogue-mechanics doesn't make it a good mechanic for encouraging firefights (with one exception I'll mention later). 

What does that leave us with? My solution of course. Surviving a manhunt through combat should give a SIGNIFICANT bonus to DZ experience. Surviving a manhunt (at least once the lvl 30 DZ becomes more populated) is the hardest challenge this game can offer. Beta taught us that trying to hold your ground with a manhunt meant you would have DOZENS of players throwing themselves at you. No amount of bullet-sponge challenge mode shotgunners can match the insanity of having 10-20 people all constantly attacking you, probing for a weakness, and if they die they'll be back in a minute ready to try again. It is very, very hard. The rep bonus for surviving should come as a mutiple that accounts for the number and level of people you killed, so that there's no incentive just to blast a few players and then spend 5 minutes doing the heal-roll ballet across midtown. Holding the line against overwhelming odds should be the FASTEST way to get DZ xp, with the comparable risk that if you fail and fall in battle... that you will suffer an equally destructive penalty (this doesn't need to be added though, the DZ xp loss is already crippling for rogues). How could people argue that completing the toughest challenge in the Dark Zone shouldn't offer the best Dark Zone XP? 

This doesn't encourage mindless violence or ""TDM cowadooty mode"" that people seem so afraid of. If you just start killing-on-sight like in DayZ you will be ruthlessly hunted down and punished every time... but if you stake out a defensive location, and through teamwork, strategy, and skill (*cough* gear) manage to prevail, you should be rewarded. 

This system would produce fights that actually have significance for the participants. Some people correctly argue that as players get the best gear available, they will want to PVP simply for entertainment. This is correct, but it's also tremendously unsatisfying. A manhunt squad that NEEDS to survive to get its objective produces much higher stakes and much more tenacity for both sides (rogues because they will be severely punished for failure, bounty hunters because they want to deny the rogues their sought-after rewards). Compared to the manhunt squad that is already in perfect gear and killing people because ""lol bored"" produces the kind of mindless slaughter that nobody wants. Even if you kill those squads, you know its just a token victory since they literally had nothing to lose and will be back killing people in 60 seconds. We need PVP with PURPOSE. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some other issues/ideas to wrap things up:

1) DZ gear is broken from 15-30. At around level 15 all the DZ vendors start exclusively selling DZ 30 gear. This ruins whatever hope there was for DZ currency to have meaning. Even at level 1-10 you get over 1,000 credits just for opening a DZ chest. That number barely scales with levels, and forcing players to not spend any currency from DZ 15-30 means that everyone has a hoard of credits by the time they can spend them and will be well-geared by that point (meaning they only will have to spend the credits in a few choice slots). It also discourages any rogue-play because of the harsh penalties to credits when you die as a rogue. The 1-15 system worked great, it needs to be extended to 16-29. The weirdness of this system just convinces me that its a bug. 

2) The rogue-hunter wallhacks need to go. While its relatively easy to sprint away from a fight as a rogue, standing your ground becomes obscenely hard when enemies can see your every movement. The rogue tracking system should be based on your movement. Running in a dead sprint should give you the current ""wallhacks"" that let you accurately track them down, but holding out in a defensive position (not running or running only for short durations) should only give enemies a general idea of where you are until you ping/visually confirm where they are. As an added bonus, this would add some degree of tension when hunting rogues... it would be great if you knew the rogues were inside a building, but you still had to check your corners exercise caution rather than charge in with 100% confidence because you know exactly where they are and they can't even take a step in your direction without you knowing it. 

3) Rogue loot-n-scoot should be changed. It's as easy as ever to blast someone in the back as they extract, loot them instantly, and hook the loot up in 2 seconds. This is shitty gameplay, but as I've said a dozen times now, it's also the most rewarding gameplay for rogues. Ultimately the system should try to encourage rogues to work for their bounty. When attempting to extract goods from non-rogue players you've killed, there should be a special extraction system in place. You won't be able to extract those items from normal extraction chopper, you'll have to call for a special ""black market"" chopper. This chopper will send out a special extraction warning that lets everyone in the vicinity know that stolen loot is attempting to be extracted. Anyone within a wide radius of the extraction possessing ""rogue"" loot will be marked as rogue for as long as they are in the perimeter (and for ~20 seconds upon leaving, with the timer pausing upon combat). Killing the rogue players in an extraction will not make you rogue and anyone who loots the rogue-loot can extract on your chopper or normally. 

4) Changing DZ zones should not hide your rogue status from the zone you just left. Common sense. 

5) Damage thresholds for going rogue should decrease if you're damaging players several times over the course of 30-60 minutes. I'm already seeing this tactic where if you're struggling in PVE against a named mob or whatever, someone will start shooting you up just enough to make you really likely to die. Worst case scenario is they get a 20s rogue timer and book it, best case is they get you super low and the NPC's finish you off, leaving a bounty of loot on the ground for the asshole to take without fully going rogue. Comparatively I'm still going rogue when idiots run in front of my sniper rifle while I'm shooting.

With these changes I'd be much more confident in the future of this game. Having a good PVP system is essential to keeping a game alive for years as opposed to months. The Division has some excellent PvE, but its clear that enemies have only a limited bag of tricks and engaging bullet sponges on the same mission over and over has very limited appeal. Plus from what I've seen, the DZ remains the best source for endgame gear - not only does it vomit purples at you, but challenge gear appears to be around item level 30 while DZ gear gets you up to item level 32. It should be a priority for Ubisoft to get the Dark Zone into order before its too late, and if you hate any and all forms of PVP then you've got the other 90% of the map to enjoy. **The Dark Zone should be MORE than just a loot farm of easy NPC's and shoot-n-loot assholes, the game's future depends on it.**",thedivision,HOW TO FIX THE DZ PT. 2: Endgame is still in bad shape.,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/49ucu7/how_to_fix_the_dz_pt_2_endgame_is_still_in_bad/

Here is the state of the Dark Zone, you have three kinds of players.

1) The PvE farmer
2) The opportunistic ambusher
3) The KOS Crew

The Dark Zone is supposed to be unique because of the possibility of PVP and the risk involved. To the people who think that going rogue should be grotesquely punishing, allow me to direct you to the other 90% of the map that is PVP-free. 

Yet currently the Dark Zone is 90% of #1, 9% of #2, and 1% of #3. 

#1 and #2 offer NO meaningful PvP. #1 is just a PvE grindfest and #2 involves someone unloading a shotgun into your back as you extract and then sprinting around alleys/subways for 90 seconds while heal-tumbling (there's no catch-up mechanic for chasing rogues, and who's idea was it to allow people to use medkits/heal abilities while rolling?!?!).

#3 is what many of us came to the Dark Zone for. Whether as a rogue or as a bounty hunter, we wanted to see epic firefights and adrenaline-fueled holdouts as the rogues try to hold out. 

But it doesn't happen. From 1-30 I got to kill ONE rogue. The handful of other rogues I encountered would blow me away in &lt;2 seconds (usually a group) and then disappear into the subway/back-alleys where it would be almost impossible to catch them before the timer ran down. 

The reasons are clear. Going into a manhunt is literally the hardest challenge the game can offer (assuming your DZ is populated). You will have a dozen or more players coming for your head and only incredible teamwork will let you survive.

Yet the benefits of surviving a manhunt are non-existent compared to the risks. Surviving a manhunt means you get a spattering of gear (the bounty hunters coming for you are not going to be hauling loot, or if they are, it will be shitty), and a pittance of credits (~1500). Meanwhile dying during a manhunt means losing TENS OF THOUSANDS of credits, an entire level or more of DZ rep, all your keys, any loot you had found, etc. 

The risk v. reward here is ridiculously imbalanced and we're left with a Dark Zone that offers no engaging PVP experience. It's just hours of farming NPC's with the occasional douchebag who shoots you in the back while you're extracting and then starts the super-fun-enjoyable game of ""lets chase this guy who's rolling through the subway pumping heals without any hope of catching him"".

This is not what endgame PVP should look like, I'm not a 'rogue' player but I can't bounty hunt if there's nobody who has a reason to fight me face-to-face.

Right now the Division is in trouble. Ubisoft has made the Dark Zone their end-game and have been unusually loud in declaring it. Most MMO's will let the players figure out where the best gear will come from, but Ubisoft has outright told us that the Dark Zone is where max level players will go for endgame gear.

So, at least for now, the Dark Zone is what decides if this game dies in a month or two, or if it survives to becomes a staying force that will define this generation of gaming. I'll add that I'm writing this because like most of you, I desperately want the Division to be GOTY material that I can enjoy for a long time. This game has incredible potential and it would be tragic if that potential remained untapped. Let's get into the nitty gritty:
__________________________________________________________________________________

**The Rogue system is broken and incentivizes terrible gameplay**

Let's imagine four ways the endgame DZ will be launched in a month. One version has DZ rep/credits as the ultimate goal. The best weapons and armor will all be available through vendors and so stacking your rep/credits is the final goal of any player wanting the best gear. One version has random loot as the ultimate goal. The vendor gear will be great but rep/creds will be easy to gather and within a week everyone will be decked out in vendor gear, leaving chest/random drop loot to be the final tier of gear that can surpass what the vendors offer. The third version would be if Ubisoft pulls off a miracle and makes DZ rep/credits to be roughly as valuable as random loot. This would require making the DZ vendor gear cost roughly 10x what it costs right now while overhauling the credit system so that people continue to need credits/rep even after they've gathered most of the vendor gear. The fourth version is similar to what the beta is, nothing matters, everyone gets the best gear in the game within a week and going rogue is just a way to alleviate boredom.

**Version 1 (Rep/Creds are all that matters):** This system incentivizes awful behavior while destroying any motivation to ""hold out"" as a rogue player. I think everyone agrees that the most fun in the Dark zone is getting in fights with rogues. Yet under this end-game there won't be any rogues to fight with. Currently the BEST credits/hour is walking up behind a clueless player, unloading into their skull, and then sprinting through alleys for about a minute. You get a 200 DZ credit bonus for surviving a trivial level 1 bounty along with the rep/credits/loot you got for murdering an unexpecting player in about 1 second. With a good escape route (sewers, alleys, construction areas) there is virtually 0% chance that a player or group will be able to react and cut you off and kill you. Once an agent hits 5k+ health, its virtually impossible to kill them while they run, you will only have a clear shot for a second here and there and that won't be enough to down them... and once you're behind them there's no ""catchup"" mechanic that will let you reach them before the minute bounty is over. Meanwhile players who do what we WANT, going rogue and trying to hold out, get nothing. They lose all their loot, virtually all the rep/credits they gained, and most importantly they wasted a lot of time trying to survive. With timers resetting its just impossible to survive through combat, yet I think most people would prefer dramatic firefights compared to 5 minute sewer marathons where the group has stacked healing abilities/signatures and is basically a sprinting ball of undeath that nobody wants to bother chasing around. TL;DR: In version one, shooting random nonhostiles in the back and sprinting around tight spaces like a madman is the most rewarding gameplay style here... and its absolute cancer.

**Version 2 (only contaminated gear matters)**: You though Version 1 sounded bad? Version 2 is even worse. The final form of version 2 involves players just lounging around extraction areas. They can wait until someone actually tries to extract. Then, with a massive ""first strike"" advantage, they tear up anyone actually trying to extract. A solo player can do this against other solo's or small groups, a full group can do this against several people. The rogues will ALWAYS have a huge advantage here, the extracting player will be a free kill and anyone else will be less mentally prepared for the ambush compared to the ambushers who already know who their friends and foes are. The ambush is one thing though, the biggest problem is that all the ambushers need to do to reap their reward is walk up, grab the loot, and then clip it on the helicopter rope just 2 feet away. It's effortless, just 3 seconds to loot and secure. Then what? **Literally the smartest thing the ambushing group can do it jump off the nearest building, blow themselves up, or let the first person/NPC they see kill them as soon as possible.** The rep/credit loss for a Rank 1 rogue is trivial, 30 second repawn that is usually a very short trip from the nearest extraction. Currently it is VERY possible for a 4-man rogue group to ambush every single extraction in an area, suicide, and then be back as non-hostiles for the next extraction in 90 seconds. This is the ultimate way to get contaminated loot, and its pure cancer. The rogues have nothing to lose, they hold onto loot for about 2 seconds, its virtually impossible to screw this method up.

**Version 3 (its a miracle! rep, creds, and loot all matter equally)**: This is the ideal situation, but the synopsis doesn't change. Groups will ambush lone players, sprint off through the escape route they've practiced a hundred times, and with heal spam and deep health pools there's no way anyone is going to catch them in 60 seconds. The system still encourages the strongest and most organized to prey on the weakest with an extremely high success rate. Furthermore there's still 100% no reason to ever get into a firefight. You shoot people before they can react and then run away without any further fighting or else you escalate your rogue level into a very inefficient escalation of the rogue timer. This isn't fun for rogues, and it sure isn't fun for rogue hunters. If for some reason you or your group end up getting more than 1-2 rogue levels its simply more profitable to suicide and try again rather than going down the rabbit hole of self-defense timer increases until you've been at it for an hour within nothing to show for it (and you eventually lose it all when you finally succumb to IRL exhaustion, you have to use the restroom eventually, the endless legion of rogue hunters doesn't). 

**Version 4 (the darkest timeline)**: What we have in the beta. Everyone has the best gear within a week and there is no reason to care about loot, credits, OR rep once you've been decked out. Going rogue just becomes a symptom of boredom, nobody actually cares if they die or drop loot, they just shoot each other as a means to grief. The game will die within a month because the loot treadmill is over and the Darkzone just becomes a pit of griefing without consequences. 

What do all these alternate realities have in common? None of them encourage rogues and rogue hunters to get into firefights. There's no shootouts, no desperate holdouts, no strategic positioning, no epic firefights between a dozen rogue hunters sieging a rogue squad... none of that. 

There is this really short-sighted mentality on this sub-reddit where people say ""Going rogue should suck! It should be impossibly hard! You shouldn't be rewarded for doing something bad!"". Yet the dark zone is defined by PVP and you literally can't have PVP without rogues. I myself don't go rogue, I don't opportunistically kill people at extractions, but I absolutely love hunting rogues down. You can't be a rogue-hunter if nobody enjoys going rogue, or you can't ENJOY being a rogue-hunter if the rogues never want to fight back. The rooftop sieges and maximum rogue squads are a symptom of bored beta players who will have their characters deleted in less than a day. This will not happen in live because there's 0 reason to sign your own death warrant with an infinitely resetting bounty timer. 

It's not rocket science to come to this conclusion. Rogues get a HUGE advantage on their first strike (virtually impossible to defend against) but after that they are at a massive, massive disadvantage. **Why would a rogue ever do anything besides ambush someone and then run away from a firefight they can never win**  (the ""never win"" is a combination of infinite bounty timers and free wallhacks for all bounty hunters). Yet this pattern of play is literally one of the worst possible outcomes for this game.

__________________________________________________________________________________

Alright, I've gone into the issues in great detail, now here are my solutions. 

* **Do not give bounty hunters wall hacks.** The ""rogue warning"" should give you their general location and a visual/verbal warning if you are within a 100m of a rogue. Do not visually highlight these players in any way unless they're either shooting at me, if I've pulsed them, or if I've put my mouse over them. If a rogue peeks out from a rooftop, any tension is absolutely destroyed if they have a giant skull appear above their head as the game goes ""LOL LOOK OUT DANGER GUY HERE"". This change is as much to make rogue holdouts viable as it is to make the Dark Zone as a whole more tense. **There is absolutely no tension when the game gives you perfect information about where rogues are, I'm not afraid of the rogues, I can run if they come toward me and duck back into cover as I see their skull move out to return fire. It's way too much information to make rogue hunting that fun, yet dangerous, experience that it should be. When I know a rogues near I should be tense, scanning the side alleys, looking over my shoulder, and ducking for cover when I see movement from behind a nearby card... instead I get to relax as I the game tells me EXACTLY where the bad guys are**. Hell I'm more afraid of accidentally bumping into an elite NPC than I am of an entire squad of 'manhunt tier'  elite rogue players. 

* **Put a hard cap on the manhunt timer.** It's that simple. I think ""self-defense"" shooting as a rogue should still escalate your rogue level and increase your timer, but the big issue comes when a manhunt is triggered and the entire zone comes after you and you're trapped with an infinitely resetting bounty timer. **If that manhunt is capped at 5-10 minutes followed by a ceasefire, you encourage exactly what the dark zone needs, large firefights that emphasize strategy/positioning/skills/teamwork. The rogues still face a MASSIVE challenge in staying alive and failure still means they lose everything, but at least it has a possibility of victory for them. This is the IDEAL high risk, high reward system. If you survive you keep all the loot, all the rep, all the credits plus a sizable bonus, if you die then you are far worse off than before**

* **Rogues should not be able to extract on their victim's chopper.**  This eliminates the super-profitable yet ultra-lame method of murdering an extractor and then extracting their own loot in a matter of 5 seconds. **Rogues must summon their own chopper** (this will be a 'black market' or 'unauthorized' extraction that will carry a special notification for other players in the zone). Ubisoft should also consider making murdering near an extraction zone during an extraction constitute an automatic Rank 2-3 Rogue status. It still feels a little lame if you can murder an extractor and then waltz back one minute later as a non-hostile and extract in time for the next chopper. Alternatively summoning a 'rogue' chopper while rogue should at least extend your rogue timer to the duration of the extraction period, but it should also include a ""black market bonus"" of either DZ rep/credit or perhaps a randomly generated bonus item for successfully holding out at a rogue extraction. Likewise, failing a rogue extraction should result in a hefty credit loss and a longer respawn timer (roughly 60 seconds) so that the rogues cant just run back and murder the people who just beat them as they try to extract the loot they had just won. The extractions are all pretty exposed, surviving at one when the entire zone is gunning for your stolen loot is a pretty impressive feat. I'm getting excited just imagining trying to extract stolen loot under heavy enemy fire.

* **Going rogue should influence subsequent respawns.** This whole ""clean slate"" respawn system just doesn't work. It opens the door to all kind of griefy, shitty, exploitative behavior. At the very least there should be a rolling penalty for dying as a rogue that lasts an hour or two. If you die as a rogue more than twice in an hour, you start to endure heftier death penalties. You lose more credits, more rep, longer respawns... perhaps even stash items or not losing rogue status on death if you manage to die 7-8+ times as a rogue over the course of an hour. Going rogue should be an intelligent decision, mindless KOS aggression right outside a safe zone should not be encouraged or enabled by the game. Currently dying as a level one rogue is borderline trivial, so chaining about a bunch of ""level 1"" murders before being gunned down should multiply the penalties you suffer. I also think Ubisoft should consider allowing ""revenge"" kills, if a rogue's first victim (usually impossible to survive against a competent rogue opening up at point blank) doesn't participate in ""ending"" that bounty, then they can still have a chance to kill their aggressor without triggering their own rogue status (or enabling revenge for the rogue) for a 10-minute window. This would amp up tension for rogue players who instead of always being the predators, have to look over their shoulder for their former prey. It would also help prevent mindless aggression since the victims can take the initiative in punishing these KOS rogues instead of having to wait and get shot half to death before attempting to put them down. 

__________________________________________________________________________________


Other common sense suggestions:

1) Make zone boundaries impenetrable. Not some ridiculously exploitable ""soft"" boundary system for going into areas you're too high/low level for. Edit: People keep saying its ""beta only"". If you noticed in beta the zones had their own level requirements that would keep certain levels out. How is Ubisoft going to enforce these boundaries? Our best guess is that they would use the current beta boundary system. That system is deeply flawed and opens the door to a ton of exploits and abuse. Logically if they had a better and less exploitable boundary system in place for separating zones by level, why wouldn't they just use that system instead of specially crafting a beta boundary that is rife with abuse/exploits?

2) Balance weapons. LMGs/Shotguns are literally pointless. Marksman weaponry are too strong. In a game where cover is everything, being able to plink the top of your enemy's head behind cover for 50% of his health is ridiculously strong when most weapons will tickle you and have ridiculous spread.

3) Balance the skills. Powerful heals should be able to used in a full sprint. Heals in general should not completely overshadow non-heals. Skill power needs to be stronger to justify losing 25%+ DPS/Health for a boost to skills. 

4) Make dropped loot rare, but high quality. The system as a whole suffers when people are constantly mass-extracting a metric ton of mediocre/shitty items. Extractions start to lose all meaning and hauling a hazmat loot bag means virtually nothing. Having loot become rarer+better means you have to be a little more cautious, more careful, and more intelligent about planning your extractions. It also rewards successful rogues more since (as discussed above) raiding extractions will become MUCH more difficult. This is just a win/win improvement.

5) Make sure the credit/rep system WORKS. Right now its a joke. Maybe its a joke because its balanced for beta, but as I said in the OP I've been playing MMO's for decades and every time too many people give developers too much credit. I wouldn't put it past Ubisoft to have the max-level rep/credit system trivial to max out. Elite DZ vendor gear should take a long time to earn and max rep should be an extremely difficult feat, not just the ""standard"" for every player who plays often. Considering that you can farm DZ rep/creds by just farming NPC's, it should take some serious effort. 

6) More NPC's. Roaming NPC's. Bosses that have more than 5 guys defending them. **SPONTANEOUS EVENTS, RARE EVENTS, RARE BOSSES WITH ONLY A LIMITED APPEARANCE WINDOW THAT REQUIRE 10+ PLAYERS TO KILL IN TIME**. Seriously Ubisoft, these ideas write themselves, don't make the Dark Zone into an ultra predictable NPC farming simulator. 

7) Bonus edit suggestion! Leaving a group in the DZ should remove you from the instance (as long as you're not already rogue obviously). There are already plenty of groups use groups to get their friend into an instance and then have him leave so he can grief people trying to stop his rogue friends. Standing in front of the rogue players to bait the attackers to go rogue themselves, shooting attackers 1-2 times at point blank range, etc. Many of these suggestions could be exploited if one non-rogue friend is able to collect loot or run interference for his rogue pals. 

8) Bonus edit suggestion #2! This one comes from one of the comments from another user. In-line with the penalties for repeatedly going rogue, the game will also reduce the ""rogue damage"" threshold for subsequent lives. If you die 3-4 times as rogue in an hour, then even a single shot against non-hostiles should be enough to make you rogue. No more ""lol I get to shoot you to half HP before you can kill me"" if you're dealing with someone constantly murdering people outside of a checkpoint. 

9) Monday bonus edit: After some comments I've considered how to give us Rogue tracking without wall hacks. Someone raised a good point that if rogue tracking is too vague, then people utilizing the ""shoot a rando in the back and then leg it through alleys/subways for one minute"" method would continue to go unpunished. So to come up with a win/win change, the rogue tracking should vary in accuracy based on how fast the rogues are moving... in essence a ""movement based"" tracking system that encourages stealth and makes it harder to go on subway marathons. The gist is this: If you are running in a dead sprint for several seconds while rogue, the bounty hunters would get a highly accurate indicator on their radar and possibly even keep their current ""wallhacks"" so that they can effectively try to cut off the runners. However, if you mostly utilize the jogging/walking/standing speed then the accuracy of the rogue tracker would depend on your speed and there would be no ""wallhack"" mechanic. Staying still or nearly still for a long time would broaden the tracker so that hunters would know that you were in or around a specific building but wouldn't be able to narrow it down without pulsing or spotting you. Again this is all to encourage what we want to see ([there was a FIIIIREFIIIIGHT!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsuH1msEkvM)) and discourage what is unfun for both sides (shooting a random nonhostile in the back and then jogging in the subway for 60 seconds).

This game has a TON of potential in the Dark Zone, but its still untapped. If Ubisoft wants to make this game the blockbuster success it deserves to be, they have a lot of work ahead of them across the next month. Otherwise, this game is at risk of going down the path of countless other MMO's with fat budgets and big hype.

But observing how it works, even groups are dead men walking if they go rogue. 

Basically:

1) Group goes rogue

2) Nearby players swarm after the rogue agents

3) Group is necessarily forced to defend itself as it gets hit from multiple angles

4) Group successfully defends itself but has now tripled its rogue timer

5) New players and angry respawned players continue to hunt the rogue agents from every direction

6) Rogue agents hit manhunt status just trying to defend themselves and run away, now the entire instance is gunning for them

7) Rogue agents get overwhelmed with a constantly resetting timer, they die, and all the loot they fought to get is lost

I mean that's all I've seen so far. I'm sure a few groups/individuals have been able to pick someone off and escape, but its almost certainly a losing proposition... and plus what do other players have that could possibly be worth being hunted by the entire server.

I'm assuming it will be FUN and have lots of replay value, but at some point if you're just tossing all your loot, it just kind of loses its appeal.

Also is there any kind of end-game PVE content that requires top-tier coordination/gear? Or is Dark Zone just a means to get better gear for going back into the Dark Zone? I'd love to see something akin to Nightfall Strikes or Raids from Destiny where you and a pre-made team have to bring the best gear and the best tactics to survive. I -LOVE- PvP but I still think the ideal loot tiering allows for PvP loot to be competitive in the end-game but with the greatest PvE challenges being equal or greater in terms of loot prospects.

The Darkzone seems even easier than the lighthouse (it sounds like you can get top-tier gear in Dark Zone without even having to PvP, you just have to avoid/survive rogue agents who might go after you), so I really hope there's something that pushes us a little harder than just ganking people in the Dark Zone.

ToO is a different story. When the enemy stays on the inside there are plenty of openings to go ham with a shotty but all the Flawless teams I've seen so far have huddled near the middle/tree side, all spread out, with snipers and scouts/pulses ready to flow from one side to the other if we ever try to use the buildings to get in close.

I also find myself getting frequently cockblocked by rezzes, I often commit on someone attempting a rez only to have alpha lupi get them up in half a second and the overshield pals proceed to beat me down. Kind of irritating how easy it is to rezsnipe from across the map but if someone's two feet in front of me there a good chance I might not kill either before they kill me. 

So I'm curious to hear what's working for you guys, 3 shotties and trying to rush down sniper teams? Two snipers and one shotty just to help flank and pinch? Or should I just take my bounty/5/7 win rewards and wait for a more favorable shotgun map?

Playing my Titan I always found myself wondering why my Fist of Havoc was an almost universally worse version of void blast and the bubble, despite being the only non-lethal super and requiring advanced planning and strategy... was extremely underpowered and (until later patches) could be popped by any other super while still killing everyone inside.

I could deal with Arc Blade and Golden Gun because the former could be shut down with shotgun+melee for an even trade and the latter had no damage resistant and could be sniped/rocketed/shotgunned/etc. In other words, when a supered up Hunter came rushing toward my point I had options to stop them even if my super wasn't up. 

Now it's Year 2 and its clear Bungie learned nothing. Stormtrance and Hammer of Sol are flat upgrades to arc blade. They have the precious damage resistance while offering massive range and are immune to all the previous tactics we could use to shut down the previous ""mobile"" supers. While Hammer of Sol is clearly superior in many ways, Stormtrance is the worst offender of ""lets take a Year 1 super and just completely improve it in every way"". 

But the icing on the cake is the new Hunter super, Shadowshot. Most of the time it's already just a bad version of nova bomb, but the truly hilarious part is that despite the language of the super specifically saying that it BLINDS enemies, it DOESN'T even do that! It literally just gives you some fuzzy purple aura around the edge of your screen while giving you almost perfect vision around the center. The blind mechanic works exactly the same for every other ability that uses it, but Bungie apparently made the deliberate choice to not give a BLIND super the ability to actually BLIND people in the Crucible. I can't even fathom the logic of Bungie gimping Shadowshot when Hammer of Sol and Stormtrance were added in their current state. 

This all brings me back to an unhappy place in the crucible. Stormtrance and Hammer of Sol destroyed any notion that good planning and smart plays would let you counter a super. Nonlethal ""strategic"" supers continue to sit in a pathetic state while the Crucible meta just doubled down on one-shot extreme lethality.",DestinyTheGame,Why is SUPER balance so awful in Crucible?,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3mphd8/why_is_super_balance_so_awful_in_crucible/

Patron can punish you turn 7+ for filling your board but CW can start punishing you for that at turn 5.

Every game is like a replay of the last. CW does absolutely nothing for ~4 turns except use any weapons and throw out some speedbump armorsmiths/acolytes, they get completely knocked around and are usually 1-2 turns from death when the start dropping brawls, cheap removal, slude belchers, shieldmaidens, etc. and then raise themselves from the dead. Committing big minions is just giving him massive value for his executes/shield slams, committing multiple smaller minions will cost you the game unless they get the worst possible brawl. Then late game rolls up and every turn you've got to have a game plan for boom/sylvannas/rag/ysera/grommash/alex or a mix of all of the above then Varian drops. The Alex/Grom combo alone means you have to constantly choose between unfavorable trades or getting Alex'd and killed or beaten into Grom range.

I'm not just talking from the other side of the table here, I've been playing 2x brawl CW to ladder up and it's pretty disgusting how greedy you can make your deck and not get punished for it. It's not unbeatable, there are decks that can give you a hard time, but the same was true for patron. At least with patron you know that you can play aggressively since the warrior typically won't get any outsized value against you pushing him hard until late-game, with brawl committing hard early can outright lose you the game.

You have a $100m fund seeking 3x daily index return. Fund acquires a $300m exposure to that index and the index rises 2% on day one. Fund asset value is now $106m but the exposure is now $306m, but it needs to be 3x asset value to achieve it's return goals, so the fund buys $12m more exposure. This is the necessary rebalancing process to my knowledge.

Yet it's clear the inverse ETF'S require daily rebalancing too. I just don't understand why. When your $100m short position grows to $102m after the reference index drops 2%, then fund asset value is now $102m as well. Future shifts in exposure should be matched to asset value 1:1 right? Why would a fund need to rebalance at all? 

I've read plenty of articles and yet they all show how decay happens, but not what that explicitly has to do with rebalancing. I feel like decay is just a natural side effect of tracking daily % returns for inverse ETFs, I don't get why these funds need to rebalance or why the rebalancing affects decay like it does for leveraged ETfs.
