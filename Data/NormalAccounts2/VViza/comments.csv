10,"What are you looking for? pretty much any fantasy-esque open world rpg with as few instances as possible that allows me to jump between pve and pve freely whenever I want
What games have you previously played?(This is everything I can think of at the moment,not sure if it's everything.Also I still play a few of them, it's just that I'm still looking for something more in an MMO, no that they are necessarily bad)WoW, Tera, Blade and Soul, Guild Wars 1&amp;2, Cabal 1&amp;2, Maplestory, Mabinogi, Vindictus,Last Chaos, MU, FEZ, Aion, Warframe, Diablo 1-3,SWTOR,ESO,Wildstar,AQ Worlds,The Secret World,Archeage,Conquer,DC Universe,Defiance,DFO,D&amp;D Online,ELOA,EVE,Rose Online, Last Chaos, Silkroad, Rift, RaiderZ, Neverwinter, Elsword, Grand Chase, Path of Exile, PSO2, Ragnarok Online 1&amp;2,FFXIV,Runescape
What is your playstyle?I probably fall under semi-causal. I would be hardcore if I wasn't in college again.
Any preferred mechanics? Im not very picky when it comes to mechanics, but I definitely like it when a game comes with lots of variety instead of the same few skills being inherently better than everything else. Also it is nice to have a few simple things that developer's like to leave out these days for their own reasons, such as person to person trading and 1v1 duels in the open world.
Anything specific you want to exclude? I dislike timegates, the ability to purchase anything other than cosmetics and convenience with real money,and having to replay the some dungeons/raids  countless times for an endgame experience. Also it is sad to see a game that people say I can jump freely between both pvp and pve but then find out that no one plays pvp and the queues are long",2016-01-27 19:43:09+00:00,cze7fp8,1,t3_42l0k3,200338,MMORPG

Hey guys, just started up again last week after not playing since reaper of souls came out. Still hunting for more ancients,set items, and cube legendaries like Dawn down here in t5, but while im looking for them I was just wondering if anyone could recommend some re-rolls on some of my items to make the grind a little easier. I dont really have a desired build in mind, just getting my gear together for now. As for what to accomplish, I'm just running rifts and bounties for legendaries/cube mats.My paragon points are all crit dmg and movement speed for the first two, and spread out between all 4 for the last two. Can't give an in-game screenshot at the moment, just hanging out in my university library to kill time.Thanks for any info you can give!",2016-01-25 19:41:50+00:00,czbkmt1,1,t3_42lhdl,20299,Diablo3DemonHunters
