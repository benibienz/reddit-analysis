before i start i think SW is a great game and i love playing it for the whole 2 years i am playing. But one thing allready bugs me for a long time. I am an end game player, i can reach g1 conestently can do R5 Toah and with my guild i can reach G2 at the end of the week, so i think i got enough insight of the game to make some statement.

And my Statement is: This game needs a lot more balancing to make it interesting again. Arena or even Gw feel like a chore and are bland. In both there are around 20-maybe 40 monsters that you see all the time (9 out of 10 defenses). And that's not just for one week that's going  for month.

Don't get me wrong i love the balancing com2us is doing the buffs for most monsters are on point, but still it won't change anything compared to the stale end game meta right now since the op monsters are still going to be wayyyyy stronger.

Nerfing is a way to improve the game in a direction that freshes things up that leads to opportunities for new metas and inavitable new monsters to rise and get strong. 

My best example for a good balance of nerfs and buff's is league of legends. 
Buffs aswell as nerfs are a big part in keeping the game fresh and interesting since new champs alwayys bring new synergies new interesting ways to work with your team.

Right now sw is just plain boring rune grinding allday without real opportunity, me for my part i don't really want to push arena rankings anymore since i know i will just face the same monsters just with even better runes.

Also yes i  know some people would be discouraged when they see their monster getting nerfed but just ask people who pulled a ""shit"" nat 5 to begin with . What's with them?


Tl;dr
Nerfs are good for the game since they keep the game interesting and fresh. 

ps. sorry for the bad formating i am a reddit noob :P",summonerswar,Summoners War problems - Or why this game needs nerfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/4mhtuv/summoners_war_problems_or_why_this_game_needs/

yes this is a rant thread since i am majorly disappointed in how summoners war is progressing and heading at the moment especially in a pvp enviroment.

I am a c3 to g1 range player so i had my fair share into ""high level"" Arena and i must say it's plainly just bullshit. 

First it doesen't matter at all what Ad you set until it's sunday afternoon which makes the whole ""PVP"" senseless for 99% of the week.

Secondly you don't even try to win your ad anymore . Smack an hp/ high speed lead + 1-3 rinas(+- camillas) on your ad and you are golden. 

That's just not the way i want my PVP to work it's just plain boring to play against that  since the speed meta is so stale and overused.

Third i don't feel com2us is doing enough to force a meta change. If i compare it to other games like league or dota for example, where there is a constant change of meta because of a constant flow of patches that either bring buffs or nerfs to change the meta, new additions feel plain and not very useful. 

Summoners war is at a point where it's way to stale way to boring to even try to work something out.
Today i scrolled through my arena lists not even trying to reach for guardian and watched at all the rina teams. I was counting them , during rush hour i saw 85 rina ad's and 25 without at least one. 

I really loved the part between fighter 3 and conq 1 where i had to think, what ad could nack me some wins what ad can i use to get me up there without refreshing to much. It's so fulfilling to see a defense success in your log but as the game is right now you just want to stall as long as you can before you inevetiably lose (unless godlike barion runes^^).

I want that feeling back the joy of doing something with my hardly earned runes and my monsters that i build not just something that scares people away because it's wating time.

You all know everyday this sub gets post like ""What to six star, help gb10 db10"" and so on. 

What would it be if we would implement a Mentor System where Veteran players can take one or more new players under their care and show them the ropes answer questions.

I know some people are really annoyed by the flood of help posts this sub gets everyday and maybe this system could help to redirect some of the post to the players that actually want to help.
