This sounds like a pretty fun comic idea! As far as that goes tho... I'd save it for when their master plan falls to pieces, but not if they're in imminent danger. Say, Steve gets into a secret potion lab full of Bobby traps, and not only turns off the traps, finds a way to turn them into his advantage somehow. Steve doesn't know the witch has been watching through windows in the ceiling, but that doesn't mean the witch can do anything about it at the moment since Steve has an advantageous location.

I'd love more biomes, but there needs to be some interesting differences, period. 

Perhaps they could make things interesting by having regions with different landforms, such as a Desert variant designed to make sand dunes, a jungle with hills and intentional waterfalls...

This is probably going to sound less vanilla flavored, but here's a few interesting and unique ideas, just to make things interesting. 

* The Infection. A small ""biome"" themed after the Nether, with a broken portal at the center and obsidian veins sprawling away from the portal. Netherrack, soul sand, etc for ground, with a stored layer of stained clay gradienting from red to black to grey between the netherrack and the stone underneath.
* The Glitch. Jagged on purpose, it'll be obvious when you see it. Chunks are flattened, and there are large block pits and mounds here and there, as well as perfectly square trees. 
* Petrified Forest. A mix between jungle and swamp, but with granite and diorite instead of logs and no leaves. Shallow dirt layer. Can we make a brown stone? 
* The floating isle. Over the ocean, spawn a small Ender-esque island, but made of classic blocks. An island in the sky, over the ocean.
* Volcano. Nothing special, just an individual mountain with a crater and a chance of it being filled, with water or lava, also gravel and obsidian everywhere. 
* Ruined Village. Creeper craters everywhere, with some filled with water, statues here and there, broken structures here and there... 
* Tendrils. Exact opposite of caves, only happens in very rare biome designed to be creepy. No soil, no friendly mobs, there are these freaky stone things jutting out of otherwise flat ground.",2016-10-29 04:40:25+00:00,d9cfljy,1.0,t3_59rsqe,98391.0,minecraftsuggestions

462,"It's harder, but yes. 

Most devices have a couple features that help here. There are loopholes, but so are there in everything. 

1. UAC and Permissions. The idea here is that if a file is doing something the OS doesn't expect it to, such as mess with settings, use the camera, or access files other than in it's own little folder, the OS freezes the app, asks if you really want to let it do this, and lets it go. That part about messing with settings and files is key, as that blocks a decent portion of what malware is meant to do. However, there are loopholes, I don't know the details but I can see evidence of this in my Android phone, some apps never had to ask permission to use the File Browser while others did, for instance. 

2. App stores and Trusted Sources. Windows is kinda sorta out of luck with this one as the app store is new and we still use plain EXE installers for most software, and most Linux distros besides Android are kinda the same (but I don't know anything about Apple anything), but those that do are in pretty good shape. If you're not allowed to install stuff that's not from the store, or if you're smart enough not to, that means the company can test everything before allowing people to install that app, so they know that said app is safe. 

3. Harder to develop for in some cases. This one's kind of more of a joke than a serious reason some devices are safer, but it's true in some cases, you find more malware in some platforms than others simply because there's more users, there's more software selection, and also the power of the programming language. For instance, it's easy to find Windows software that pretty much compares to Root access in Android that doesn't really trigger any alarm bells, while I'm pretty sure you can't make a powerful virus that'll steal all my data from my machine in Javascript (Yes, do some annoying things, yes, steal info from that page or make self-reposting posts, but not access files the browser doesn't even know about).

Sid the snail is a huuuge fan of comics, and would love to attend a comic con. However, every time he hears about one, it's over by the time he gets halfway there. This year, he's having none of it. 

So he crawls into a car dealership and asks what's popular among fellow bugs. The obvious choice is a Beetle, particularly a red and blue one which the snail falls in love with immediately. However, his geekiness gets the best of him and he asks for a small modification, to replace the hood ornament with the Superman logo. The car dealer was kinda slow on pop culture, being another snail, but after Sid draws it to show what he means, the dealer says ""Sure, we'll be able to do this. However it will take a couple days to get it done."" Sid is ecstatic and can't wait to show his friends at the con. 

So the day he comes back to get the car, he takes it out for a spin, as the manager talks to the dealer. ""Think he likes it?"" ""Likes it? He loves it! Look at that S car go!""

825,"Well, the one I work at is a volunteer thing the LDS church operates. We're running a website called FamilySearch.org, where we try to reassemble the entire family tree of the history of humanity. Some family lines we've found go back to the origins of writing! 

A lot of what we do is teaching people to use the site, but we also trade books with other Geneaology Libraries (Technically I'm supposed to call it a Family History Center. But it's a library.), and these books contain any kind of records about people. Newspaper obituaries, biographies, diaries, old books about clans, etc.  
We also do something called indexing, where one group scans these books and a crowdsourced effort types these into a database. It's harder tho, who can read the olden styles of writings likened unto cursyve these days? (I think I made autocorrect commit suicide) But it's very interesting. We get stuff about census, employee records, docs from the wild west, everything.  
Then they get plugged into FamilySearch's other side: A database of these records, and a setup that tried to help connect people to these records. For example, I had no idea who my great great aunt was, but my great great uncle came from NY. The site found a marriage doc with his name and birthday and parents, and where it happened. I could've searched these records, but what's really neat is that there's a bot that digs through and compares people in records to people in the tree, then asks relatives if it's the right person. (It's a robot, it's not exactly the brightest bulb in the... place where they... keep the lightbulbs... nevermind) 

I've done some of each job there, and there's not a single boring moment. I'd check it out sometime! Start out with going to https://FamilySearch.org and see how complete your tree is. There's also some other resources, but ours is free and also comes with a few free accounts with partner sites like Ancestry. It's not full access there, but it's definitely a place to start, and then some.",2016-09-26 19:00:19+00:00,d830ek7,4.0,t1_d82r3kr,11704.0,AskReddit

[Fedex Bandwidth](Https://what-if.xkcd.com/31/) 

* Milk jug of MicroSD = 25000 cards = 1.6 Petabytes = $1.2 million 
* a FedEx fleet loaded with MicroSD cards could transfer about 177 petabits per second, or two zettabytes per day—a thousand times the internet’s current traffic level. 
* Cisco estimates internet traffic is growing at about 29% annually. At that rate, we’d hit the FedEx point in 2040. Of course, the amount of data we can fit on a drive will have gone up by then, too. The only way to actually reach the FedEx point is if transfer rates grow much faster than storage rates. Unlikely, storage and transfer are linked. 
* There are experimental fiber clusters that can handle over a petabit per second. A cluster of 200 of those would beat FedEx. If you recruited the entire US freight industry to move SD cards for you, the throughput would be on the order of 500 exabits—half a zettabit—per second. To match that transfer rate digitally, you’d need take half a million of those petabit cables.
* internet will probably never beat SneakerNet. [Of course, the virtually infinite bandwidth would come at the cost of 80,000,000-millisecond ping times.](http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/31/fedex_delivery.png)

966,"How would blind villagers react they look like their hands are glued together. 

Ok ok here's a list of reactions the mobs should have. 

* Villager: blind has 50% chance of freaking out, 50% chance of wandering around with hands outstretched to feel for walls. Actually, wedge in a *tiny* chance of them running around, hitting a wall, and passing out. Nausea: 50% sitting down (75% if near a wall), otherwise slow and wobbly 
* Blind creeper: Running in circles for a second, charging off into a random direction, BOOM when they hit something. Nauseous: longer ""fuse""
* Blind skeleton: relies on hearing. It can't see you if you don't move. Nauseous: how can you have a belly ache you're made of bones 
* Zombies: Does Steve's Freakout dance at blindness, ragdolly at nauseous 
* Slime just keeps jellin' peacefully if it's blind, runs *faster* if it's nauseous 
* Ghasts are really noisy either way. Blind fires in random directions rapidly, nausea slows firing rate. 
* Endermen teleport very rapidly if blind while in a constant rage. Nauseous ones forget they can teleport. 
* Spiders and other bugs are peaceful when blind, when nauseous they are slowed down. 
* Witch: Same as villager for 3 seconds. ""AAAA I'M BLIND oh wait I have a cure."". EDIT: u/DaffodilAura218 gave me an idea! A Blinded witch picks potions at random, does it two times before drinking some milk. One to drink and one to throw in a random direction. 
* Guardians: Blind causes their lasers to stop, and they swim purely randomly. Nausea causes them to be very slow. 
* All animals: Blind causes them to run around and jump for a minute like a bull in a rodeo, then sit down and try to sleep it off. They then freak out at any sound and charge away, getting knocked out if they hit a wall, wake up after 10 seconds. Nausea: They lie down for a day.

It's pretty interesting to learn about. That's pretty much the basics of it, from there you can dive into everything tangential to it from the physics of light to the psychology of colors and their associated moods. 

There's actually some even more interesting ones too. Sometime look up Hexachrome, it's an ink company that added green and orange paints to the set, hoping to make greens and browns cheaper to print (as most photographs tend to be either leafy green scenery or peach colored skin in portraits).

994,"Actually, 3. 

Red, yellow, blue is how your eyes process colors. Good for designers, but not for the guy with the actual paint brush. 

RGB is used for lights, as light behaves differently. Note that individual photons can be any color between (except magenta. Don't ask, too complicated), but RG&amp;B are simpler to produce and to mix. A common notation for writing color is to define the brightness of each value on a scale. Since computers use base 16, 000000 means black, and FFFFFF means white, and FF0000 means brightest red possible. First two digits are red, then green, then blue. 

CMYK should be familiar if you've ever replaced your printers' ink. Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK are the primaries here, because it's subtractive color, the exact opposite of RGB. (Edit, apparently K is actually for Key... which still indicates how much black ink but isn't *quite* the same thing. Thanks for pointing that out, u/epikyummeh) Note that black is a separate ink, mixing equal amounts of CMY makes 50% grey so you need a specifically black ink to make really dark marks. Unlike lighting, you can't just keep dumping in more pigments. (One last clarification edit: although it doesn't use the same hex notation as RGB, similar rules do apply. I've never used one, but the theory is similar, 100% of any color means it's saturated. Also, this brings up the difference between ink and paint: transparency. Both use a white component for designing the color, but ink uses the paper for its white component while paint pigments are always mixed into a white basic paint.) 

One other thing to note with both RGB and CMY. The primary colors are secondary colors of the other. Magenta in RGB is FF00FF, for example, or yellow is FFFF00. Meanwhile, to make RGB's primary green out of pigments is a 50% mix of yellow and cyan. 

Just gave you a month of graphics design 101 summed up in a couple paragraphs. Don't worry if it's a little over your head. MIT made a game that may help make it easier to understand.

Now, ya, they could've made it better. One forum I went to had an *optional* filter, automatic for anyone under 16, and it was all right. (it was some roleplay site.) It was something where they swapped the word with something close, and it was even considered canon in the RP world. 

But look, point is, they're not telling you to shut up. They're telling you to shape up and think of our reputation. We want to invite people to join our community and to share our experience with them. By not minding our manners or language we're inadvertently shunning a huge portion of our society.

Then 5 years later the company brings it back and everyone invites their friend to try it because they never tried it, and it's more popular than the first time.

It could also be an experiment, say if a higher-up is wondering how well a unique product would sell.

Also they probably don't understand tech. ""Uh... Johnny, why is my phone flashing and telling me I have to defrag it? It's not downloading a frag grenade is it?""

1580,"Really, it's because they have to cram so much stuff into a tiny screen. This applies to so many sites and apps, [So many great and powerful tools and buttons, but such tiny real estate.](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/phenomenalcosmic_7939.jpg). How do you fit all the buttons in?

It's better for some than others. For one thing, when Mobile sites started becoming all the rage, everyone wanted it to look like an iPhone app, and back then not even Apple knew how to design a good-looking app with so many buttons. That's why they came up with the Stack icon (≡) ^that ^for ^some ^reason ^we ^call ^a ^hamburger ^why ^a ^burger ^and ^not ^something ^that ^doesn't ^make ^me ^hungry ^oh ^sorry, ^i'm ^distracted. 

The right way to do it is to not make a Mobile site at all, but to instead tweak the original to reorganize when it's on a tiny screen, turning it into what's called a Responsive site. When the screen/window is tiny, it makes changes such as hiding the Navigation Bar under a menu, removing the sidebars (or moving them below everything), that kind of thing. Problem is that it's still a fairly new concept, and we're still figuring it out. And some companies are lazy and don't want to change the original site too much.

There's examples of it being done right though. Google's doing this pretty well for the most part. But Responsive Design is not quite a trend for all sites yet (as m.reddit.com can attest to), but it's more than something that Web Designers nerd out about at this point.

1701,"Wha... 

Look, race isn't as big a deal as people make it seem, but it is very real and physical. It has everything to do with your ancestors and your genes. Look at it, you can look at the DNA of an individual and learn where their ancestors come from, because they have something in common. 

There is no excuse to treat two people differently because of heritage, but that doesn't mean that race is a social construct. 

I think the issue is that you're confused about the difference between race and culture. Culture is what's *harder* to detect, because it's behavior. It's what you wear, how you speak, and how you treat people and think of the world. Culture is the social construct, that can't be detected by genetics, and is truly a part of who you are. That's what's hard to identify over the phone. Even then, you can sense some aspects of the speaker's culture any time you hear words they say, as it involves word choice and accent.",2016-06-14 14:21:27+00:00,d48r6lc,5.0,t1_d48ofn3,4384.0,science

1724,"I suggest looking at YouTube channel Extra Credits, they have a series about this. 

As far as engines go... Get one and find out, really the easiest way to learn. For free and easy ones, I suggest Game Maker Studio and Construct 2. 

Basically, for both of these, you look at a template object, throw in some different behaviors (code templates, some you make yourself), slap on a spritesheet, and place it in the Level Editor. I haven't tried a 3D one yet, but it has to be the same principle. 

For example, to make a tiny Mario clone in Construct 2, all you do is draw a stick figure, give it the Platformer behavior as a template, and throw it into the Stage. Then draw a block and give it the Solid template. Then draw a flag, and add code to Stickman that translates as When you touch Goalpost summon Fireworks.gif 

I'm kinda tied between recommending Construct 2 or Gamemaker, they both allow you to use custom code. Biggest difference is that Construct uses JS but I can't figure out how to add custom code (It does have a programming tool, but it uses template snippets and, it doesn't let you type in code yourself), while GM does have a built in IDE but it uses it's own markup language.

1725,"Make a target. Ask yourself these questions: 

* What do you want to learn?

If you're here to learn, I suggest Codecademy and W3Schools, and studying HTM5, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML and CSS are smaller and easier (and have tools for free, just use the cheat sheets at W3 trust me), and with JS you can make a lot of stuff for free and learn cool skills. 

If you're here for the making awesome stuff side, DEFINITELY spring for Game Maker. It has its own programming language, but it's not necessary for simpler projects so you can have fun getting your feet wet quite a while before getting chucked off the deep end. You can make your first Mario clone in minutes (if you use the clipart anyway), and yet you can customize every detail and add custom code. It's free, until you decide to take it seriously and get the game published. I loved it, and there are even professional studios using it!

A fire requires heat, fuel, and oxygen. So the idea is to do something that surrounds the fire and cuts off fresh oxygen. Problem, this pretty much means lighting the fire inside a bubble. No, you couldn't have the gas fall on it in some fancy way, it will break into droplets in the fall. Also, gasoline evaporates surprisingly quickly, it's the vapors that burn actually.

The blocks are made of 16^3 voxels, and you can make any number of tiny things with it, including intricately detailed tables, smoother slopes, anything. It doesn't work on interactive blocks tho.

It's not just people on the spectrum who don't believe magic, you know, and a lot of ""science"" before that was basically magic.

There are a few really nice algorithms you can choose. 5 lengths, a PIN, a name, and a pronounceable phrase. And it's nice, as long as you remember the Master Password you made up and which password type you chose, you can generate the same password, but it's completely unique and unpredictable. 

Demonstration: It asks me for my username, Master Password, and site, so I input VectorLightning, ""haxxorzsuck"", and reddit, and choose the password type ""GeneratedMedium"", and it says Taq6_Gah , a fairly good password if that were my real password. If you try it, you'll get the same result.

Think of the perspective. Your idea would feel like a top-down game, while my idea of using the actual map, speed, and position would feel like an augmented reality. The pin doesn't represent you, it *is* you, showing your location in reality *and* the game simultaneously.

Intersections roll an RNG every minute, 16 numbers. 1-4 means a free pistol spawns. 5-8 means a zombie spawns, unless it reaches the cap of ten in a half mile radius. 

Zombies spawned after an even roll favor turning clockwise, odd = clockwise. Also, spawned on 5-6 means favoring turning, 7-8 = walking straight, for a total of 4 easy AIs. They die if they are shot or walk out of the mile radius, and they match your walking pace. 

The first item is a pistol. You have a trigger button, and it will destroy a zombie directly down the street you're on or closest to. One bullet each. 

Score = steps taken since start + 25 per dead zombie. 

Perhaps to simplify further, we try making it with a controller and premade map and then try making a map from G-maps then add gps control. ",2016-03-05 19:00:53+00:00,d0ordr5,2.0,t1_d0opada,3622.0,SomebodyMakeThis

Python is a favorite, because it's easy and used anywhere someone needs to pick up coding skills. It's even used on the ISS! [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) has a good series on Python, but the most important detail is that once you get the basics, there's a TON of plugins for extra scripts built-in. It's generally for **command-line** style scripting, but you can use it for some other things. I've heard of python games, python websites, I think I even saw a music visualizer for Windows Media written in it. But I have no experience with these other than the professor showing me a library that implements a GUI.

Web apps are my field of study, so my favorite is [W3 Schools](https://w3schools.com). Sure, you gotta start with HTML and CSS, but they're easy and everyone just uses references all the time anyway. Then you start with Javascript, which is when things get fun. JS will be good for interactive apps with buttons and characters running around, and there are apps that can make HTML5 run on android and iOS, such as Cordova.

2139,"Sonic Generations is one of the later ones. The ultimate boss is a creature called the Time Eater, and Eggman made it eat part of the timeline to erase his failiures. Sonic and his friends were sucked into a void called Whitespace. (They were gathered -- and the game was made -- because it was Sonic's 20th birthday party.) Places and people from each of the main games got pulled into this dimension where time is meaningless. My theory: Whitespace is basically the Retcon Shredder, and even though beating the Time Eater restored the timeline, it was a bit crumpled and torn like a bad time travel movie. 

Basically the whole story is an excuse plot to put Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic in the same game. They remade a lot of favorite levels, and made 3D versions of classics and 2D versions of newer ones like from the Adventure series or Colors. 

It's a great game, whether you're a fan of modern or classic Sonic. Classic plays exactly like in Sonic 2, and Modern plays just like Colors. ",2016-02-26 00:11:56+00:00,d0dyepk,8.0,t1_d0dwynz,2252.0,comics

Falling block entities are used all the time in commands and mods.  

As far as performance, it's simple for blocks. Moving a magnet performs a check for iron, and they step closer until they touch, then they check if they should fall.

2459,"TLDR: The difference is that the other guys are more about the user, while here it's more about the communities. 

First example: Facebook and Twitter posts are organized by person, then by tag. Here, it's primarily sorted by tag then by person. (Someone's going to come in here saying that subs aren't hashtags, but they totally are to others. I'm in favor of saying so r/subredditsashashtags) Most networks ask if you want to follow a person, but Reddit asks if you want to follow a community.

Also, notice that *nobody* here uses a real name. Some on Facebook and Twitter are like this too, but over there there are actual *profiles* and *biographies*. Over here, the name is all we have. 

I won't say it's better or worse, both seem equally good and bad. On one hand, individual-based networks (I call facebook this) are easier for people trying to communicate with circles of friends, but terrible for someone who doesn't have any friends on the network to follow. On the other hand, community-based networks (Reddit) are much better for people who want to *find* people to talk to, or even don't care who in particular sees it. Redditors are looking for new friends, help with info, another player in a game, people to share news with or geek out with, or really anything besides talking to the guys they already know. 

---

Personally, I'd like to see a network that combines the two types. Subs (or maybe call them ""clubs""?), but also personal pages, avatars, bios, etc. Maybe there should be 4 main pages: Friends' feed, community feeds, a combination, and the hottest stuff from all sources.",2016-01-23 04:35:09+00:00,cz8n435,1.0,t3_4292kx,5363.0,NoStupidQuestions

The names-getting-recycled thing might just be a paperwork error, I haven't actually heard of this. 

""Focuses on the living not the dead"". Uh, wasn't the whole thing with the cross something about letting us into heaven *after* we die? Also we don't work on that nearly as often as you think. The temples have visitors every day nearly, but it's not like they're always jam-packed with LDS visiting every other week.

Also, God's given literally everything to us, shouldn't we give back? But I'm not going to push you, I know it'll just be another argument. 

We also beg to differ on the war thing, and state that *modern society* is waging war on the family structure. That *is* what the traditional definition of marriage supports, is it not? Either way, I know this conversation is going nowhere.

The ""Be ye therefore perfect"" thing? Well shouldn't that be *everyone's* goal??? Constant improvement, striving to be perfect? Is that a crime???

OK, new metaphor: The brain is a circuit board. Each cell is both logic gate and tiny memory unit. When a neuron dies, it loses both functions. Not only do you have bad drive sectors, but parts of your processor die too. 

But the brain is flexible too. Given time you can relearn a lost skill or brain function, but this implies other neurons taking it's place. Any lost memories are gone forever. Also, neurons that already have a job have to lose that job to take a new task, and you don't get many new neurons unless you're a little kid. 


Neurologists are trying to figure out how to get stem cells to become brain cells and reconnect broken nerves, among other things. If this happens, it will patch dead parts of the brain, but memories are still gone and functions still need relearned and adapted to.

2662,"Welcome to the world of computing on a budget. There are far more alternatives to the most popular things than advertised, it just takes a little digging.  

[LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) and [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) are opensource clones that contain Word clones and more, and although they ask for donations, they're 100% free. Do anything you like, type of free. They're a bit less classy though, they resemble MS office before the ribbon came about. They're forks of the same project so they'll seem similar, but I prefer Libre. 

[WPS office](wps.com) is another one. It's freemium, as in you pay to remove watermarks and allow macros. I used it for a while, it's actually pretty familiar if you're used to newer iterations of Word.

[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/) is awesome because it comes with the basic editors, and you only pay if you want lots of space. You can just download and delete when you're done tho. It also converts to any file type pretty well. Also did I mention you don't need to download any software?

Personally I just learned HTML + CSS. Same results except pagination, and literally everyone can read it. It can do the same stuff other than pagination things, and its very impressive on a resume. [You can find some tutorials here](http://www.w3schools.com/), but the basics will do for documents. Learn some basic CSS and use the heading tags, paragraph tags, img tags, span tags, and ID and Class attributes and you'll be covered.

_____

If you have more requests, I would look at [AlternativeTo](http://alternativeto.net/). They catalog 'wares of any and every kind, and sort and filter them based on requests, such as freeware. 

Also, [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net) hosts and catalogs opensource software. If a team decided to make something, be it a rival to a professional software or a simple tool, you'll definitely find it here. Almost all the best opensource stuff is found here.

Also if you want to try out a freeware for just a day save some hassle with installs. See if it's got a [Portable version](http://portableapps.com).

In the case of breads and cakes, eggs work with either yeast or baking soda/powder. (Side note, b.powder contains b.soda.) The latter two will react with other ingredients to create gasses, which create all the bubbles in bread and cake. The eggs are what cause it to hold this spongy shape. 

As also noted, blood can work, but that's not seen as civilized anymore for understandable reasons. However, it's kinda hard to find a workable substitute.

The TLDR version is that the eyes deform in a way that benefits the most common task.

Awesome theme? Stick with 7. 

A built-in appstore that actually works this time? 10. Now. 

Win10 has many new features, but nothing game changing. 

If you've got a touchscreen, tablet mode is your friend and if you don't, they brought back the win7 start menu. 

Cortana is a Siri clone that seems pretty good, plus actually has app integration, such as reading from Twitter or your radio app. 

Modern apps (stuff that's phone and tablet friendly) are now properly integrated and fit in windows, which can be resized however you like. Also, tablet mode makes classic style apps (stuff that's not for a phone) work better on a touch interface. 

Also, multiple desktops are a thing now. It's not a game changer, but it's handy for having a lot of programs at once, and paused Store apps when you switch. 

Nothing seriously game changing, but it's nicer if you don't mind losing the Aero theme.

3105,"Nobody really knows how they're stored but I can say there's a common theory why we don't remember everything.

Basically, we collect so much information that our mind has to figure out what is important. This is what everyone calls attention. You can only pay attention to so many things at once, so you filter out what you're not looking at or trying to listen to. This stuff gets saved to short-term memory. 

That doesn't explain everything though. We still have to decide what's important to save to long-term and what isn't. On a subconscious level, we almost always mark certain things as priority: the first thing in a set, the last one, the most weird ones, and anything that repeats (that you still remember by the second or third time). You can manually label these yourself with a few techniques, the simplest is a journal. Not just because you can read it later, the act of doing something to help yourself remember it is sometimes all it takes to get the subconscious to label it important, and so it gets filed into longterm. Others methods are to tie a joke to it, or imagine the detail blown to absurd proportions. This technique is a piece of the Mind Palace thing in Sherlock, which is a real thing that just needs practice. 

What's next is a little fuzzy. Some theorize that long-term memory isn't actually saved permanently until REM sleep, but that doesn't explain why it seems that some lessons can appear to be overwritten. ",2015-11-09 17:02:21+00:00,cwu8fjx,1.0,t3_3s0tru,85829.0,explainlikeimfive
3106,"There is a very popular and successful, but *EVIL* game design template called the Skinner Box. 

There was a psychologist named Skinner (duh) whose most famous study discovered Operant Conditioning. Basically, a slot machine trains you to want to hit the button, in a way similar to that weird-but-true TV stuff where we condition reactions such as terrified of cats.  The premise is simple: Make the person want to hit the button, by associating the button with a prize, in this case game coin but in other cases it's game weapons, or even IRL candy works. In fact, he discovered it by *inventing* the slot machine, except it was designed for a pidgeon and the prize was fish. The slot machine is the direct descendant of the ""Skinner box"", the only difference is that it's shinier and it also lets you see how close you were (with some designs).

3136,"There's some common processes, but not all of them do the same thing.

As said by others, frying meat denature proteins, and I bet it happens to grilled or broiled meat too. It also happens to boiled eggs. Any time cooked food changes color, chemical reactions are happening and with meat, it's safe to say proteins are breaking down. 

Baking breads and cakes causes it to rise in two ways, depending on ingredients. Yeast is used because it fermented a little and produces gasses that inflate the bread, explaining all the spongy holes. Also, baking powder/soda does something similar, but with chemical reactions with the other ingredients. Which to use is basically determined by desired flavor. Side note, gluten is what keeps bread and cake nice and fluffy. But when you're cooking for a no-gluten meal, eggs can help. Still, don't experiment if you're cooking dinner, it's hard to get right without a recipe.

Boiling pasta is actually simpler. Soaking the pasta adds water which makes it soft, and making it warm is just that. Well, maybe it makes the soak a bit faster but that's about it. 

Frying brings up both boiling and denaturing. It infused oils and spices dissolved in it (if any), and denatures proteins.

Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuqmKg6QQTw) for a good explanation but I'm trying to sum it up here. 

Problem: We use radiation to use internet, but there's only so many frequencies that work at all. And no, we can't just keep splitting the frequencies up without causing major packet loss. 

We use more internet than cell companies can provide, so we *must* slow down or switch to wired. Cell companies are doing this by forcing us to slow down. However, I don't sympathize, they *really* should've mentioned it sometime. This is *not* something to ignore and sweep aside.

The video claims that we (should have) flat-out hit the ceiling in 2014, but they're right actually, we did run out of frequencies. Cell providers have to keep buying frequencies that were used for other things, such as air-broadcast TV. In fact, several air TV channels died because a few cell providers turned them into cell channels. And even worse is that there are many people who bought licenses to frequencies but just don't use them at all. 


This is a pretty sturdy ceiling, unless we switch to using wired internet everywhere. That's probably not gonna happen anytime soon though.",2015-11-06 19:30:39+00:00,cwqzgq5,1.0,t3_3rq0et,55431.0,OutOfTheLoop

It had a really sweet Task View thing. Tapping Win+Tab or the button next to Cortana (probably, settings) and it had multi desktop support now, like a Mac or Linux. 

Most apps work in a proper windowframe now. I can have all the Modern apps I want open and resized and positioned exactly how I want. Most awesome of it all. 

They're trying to replace Control Panel with something noob friendly, but that doesn't mean it's going anywhere.

3364,"I hear you and have dreamed up the same thing. Unfortunately, there's some problems with this that just can't be averted easily without someone finding the big red RESET button or trying to build a new country somehow.

Firstly, I'd like to say that this has worked. Greece was at one point a direct democracy (this idea). Or maybe it was Rome someone help. The real problem with this model is that the countries were small, and each town could easily vote on each issue with 100% attendance at the town hall (as far as counting legal voters). But nation wide, every town rounding up everyone to vote on every proposition, whoo that's a lot of work. Plus there's not much time to explain all the details. 

Secondly, Congress, while they're not exactly doing their job optimally, are supposed to be educated in what they're voting for and knowing the impact of the bill on their representative sector. Granted none of them deal with internet but that's gotta change soon. The point is that there's a reason they represent portions of the country.

Also our representatives, congress and the president, are constantly busy. This brings us back to the first one. Do you *really* want to go back to the voting booths every day? This can't be like reddit, you know, not every town has cheap wifi yet.

I could go on. It's difficult to manage this, to put it simply. There's concerns about hackers, informing everyone, getting every vote, constantly voting, communications, management, logistics, resetting the entire foundation of our government, *blah.* Too much to think about.


I do love the idea though. I dream of a day when there's a powerful political party that has direct voting on each problem online before they make any official decisions. It just ain't happening yet.

3606,"There's a concept... Well, have you played the Telephone game ever? It's even more fun with translations.

As you can guess, the Bible has been translated, re-translated, transcribed, hand-copied, rereretranslated, altered, rearranged, edited, and just plain messed up. And the Hebrew language tends to have double-meanings for a word, and that doesn't help translators. 

This is related also another problem that's also addressed in the early New Testament (During Christ's time here) where he basically chews a bunch of people out for not obeying the original law, because their ancestors mistranslated the laws and also kept changing it. For one example, in [Genesis 2.3](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/2), Day 7 (later known as the Sabbath, and then Sunday/Saturday depending who you ask.) was sanctified. Then in [Exodus 20.8-11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/20.8), it was told in the Ten Commandments to not work that day. Fast forward. People have been retranslating it and playing telephone for many centuries by Christ's time. Around [Matthew 12.10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/12.10), we see that they take it over-the-top-literally. Other references that I forget about say they would even have laws regarding how many steps you could take a day. Christ basically calls this rubbish, taking it to the extreme where they can't even help an injured man, and explains that the law's been corrupted sometime over the ages. The same has happened to the Bible itself.

I'm gonna come right out, I'm LDS. (Most of you know us as Mormons. They're the same thing.) We do believe in the bible as well as the book of Mormon (another conversation), but ""as far as it is translated correctly"". Seriously, that's literally what it says in our Articles of Faith.

The basic principle is that if your immune system is wrestling with minor bacteria from dirt constantly, it gets stronger. The immune system needs training just as much as your muscles and brain do. 

The original vaccine was no different. This one was someone studying a smallpox epidemic who realized that people who were dealing with dairy cows (and fighting a weaker disease known as ""cowpox"" daily) were *immunized* to pox in general. He learned that an immune system dealing with a weaker variant of disease will become better at fighting similar ones.

Playing with pets and dirt is no different. Those kids run into tons of low-level bacteria constantly, they level up, they can take on higher-level bacteria without help.

For simplicity let's assume the divider is already between them, because the ends are designed to stop and not kill so for the driver they're about the same, but dynamics with traffic are different.
(effectiveness may vary) If we make him hit the concrete barrier, that's about it. One ambulance and a tow truck, and everyone else driving around. 

Now let's rewind and erase the barrier. There's cars he could hit going 45 mph. Wow this dude's bookin' it. Now he can take out another car, maybe even two or three behind it, causing a huuuge pile up. Now they have to swerve into the other side to get away, surprising the guy who was a ways behind George and causing him to go into the ditch. It's chaos put there.

3753,"Audio quality is definitely a thing, but it has nothing to do with screen resolution. At all. Audio quality is an interesting thing to look at, but it is most certainly not measured that way. 

I suggest you download the program [Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/) and look at sound files with me. You can either record one, open a file, or look for the Generate options at the top. *And can someone help me out with terminology thanks*

A sound document consists of a message declaring the Sample Rate (Hz), and a series of sound samples that when played will sound like a recording. Each sample is a signal that when given to a speaker generates a sound. For example, a simple tone looks like [this wave](https://sandilands.info/sgordon/images/sine-wave-signal-1.png), while a more complicated sound might look more [like this](http://www.zytrax.com/tech/audio/time-wave-1.jpg). These are *increadibly* short clips though, zoom in to see this wave in your file.

A speaker ~~cannot~~ *CAN* process a true sound wave, but digital audio is stored in binary though, so when this is played, it's broken into chunks of a fraction of a second, usually as many chunks a speaker can handle per second, then these chunks are fed to a gadget called the Digital-to-analog converter, which returns not binary code but an analog signal, and these analog chunks of signal are fed to the speaker one by one.  ^I ^think. ^Maybe ^the ^converter ^is ^what ^chops ^it. (Thanks u/IBNobody )

Now the answer is simple: **A speaker that does higher-quality sound will play the tones more accurately, and be able to play more samples per second. However audio quality is completely separate from video quality.** Note that sound pitch is hertz as well. But both sample rate and pitch are in hertz. Remember that sample rate refers to how many samples are played per second, and during that moment it plays each note.",2015-08-23 21:57:07+00:00,cud7z86,1.0,t3_3i4bzo,3634.0,explainlikeimfive

* Tomorrow morning, and every day after, make three lists. Everything you need to do today, everything you want to do someday, and every habit you wish you didn't have. Before bed, review this list and see what you achieved.

* Take a Weightlifting class every year. I will thank you and so will your shorts.

* Learn to draw. In a few years you will want to make a webcomic and that is awesome. 

* You will buy Minecraft. I don't care if you don't know what that is yet. Wait for 1.8 tho and don't mess with Pocket or Win10 version.

* When you decide to stop screwing around on the internet and get serious, change your pseudonym to Vector Lightning. It's the only one you will be able to find that's not taken on many sites. Trust me, all the cool ones are already taken.

* Tablet apps are no longer a thing and run in windowframes. Unless you ask it to but I'm still figuring that out. 
* Start menu is just like Win7, but it also has a pile of tiles to the right. You can also choose to revert it back to a fullscreen tablet style start screen. 
* Virtual keyboard almost never pops up anymore (except on lock screen but I can live with it)
* MS Edge is not as nice as other browsers but it actually is pretty good now. (IE got the recycle bin)
* Virtual desktops are *AWESOME!* (Protip: to switch after adding an extra desktop, use Win+Ctrl+arrows)
* Transparent bubble screensaver works again! 
* Only complaints: Themes are always white frame with a color accent for buttons, and a dark start menu with the accent color. Kinda vanilla. Also guest account went out the window.

You are outside the map and inside the ground or something. Because of an error, Collision Detector didn't notice you and what you should've hit, so you fell through. 

3D models are always hollow, simply because mass is calculated and not rendered. Unlike a 2D game engine relying on collision masks, it can't tell when objects overlap, so it doesn't know that you're inside something. Collision errors are also more likely, for both flavors of collision detectors, when you're moving fast. It calculates your location in the next frame, not true motion.
