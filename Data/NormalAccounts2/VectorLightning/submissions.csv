The whole thing generates above normally generated terrain, basically dropping a mountain of ice on top of a field, with the top few layers being snow. Unlike typical generation, there is no dirt layer. A snow layer of 5 meters on surface, a layer of 10 meter thick transparent ice with random debris inside (Bones, stones, logs, boulders... iron golems with the head detached?), a relatively thin and patchy layer of packed ice, and below that, normal stone. 

For extra awesome, ravines generate in the ice, and rivers can cut through the glacier. Not making a valley tho, but cutting a buried river *under the ice*!  
Edit: not just going straight into it, the river should carve a little tunnel into the ice, I'm thinking the cross section of the river tunnel should have a semicircle in the top half cutting through the ice, and the water should be only 3 or 4 meters deep, max, with packed ice on the riverbed. 

Nothing grows on top of it, as there is no soil layer. Animals are very rare, and all that spawn here are dropped to a few hit points due to having been lost in a cold environment without food for who knows how long. Except the undead, all mobs that spawn here over the snow (besides breeding) are two steps from death. 

Possible extra features that would be awesome but not required: 

* Yeti mob
* The snow golem's big bad brother, the Frost Giant. 3x2 packed ice for the legs, 2x2 snow for the torso, 3 block long arms of ice, 2x2x2 pumpkins for the head. It's big. It's bad. It's a new (mini?)boss, but tame it and you are unstoppable. Can crush you, if you get hit with ranged attack you freeze for a second, generates a blizzard to blind you, etc. 
* Ice castle that randomly generates. 50% chance of a modified Stronghold generating under it, if so there's a few Frost Giant guardians outside. 
* There's a small chance of finding a villager with Redstone trades in a sealed snow cave named Edward. Edward Snowed-in, geddit?
* If this happens, can we get more frozen blocks? Snow bricks and stairs, packed ice stairs, snow wall, etc?
* Some kind of frost monster, like the opposite of a blaze? Idk.
* If it spawns near water, it'll form an iceberg, rather than a glacier. Similar, but there's no connection to ground underneath, and there's not as much debris. ",minecraftsuggestions,Biome: the Glacier,https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/5d7j61/biome_the_glacier/

A purple gel that actually seems to have some kind of AI, even though it's composed of weird liquid blocks. 


I'm not sure what rules it should have, I'll edit in any suggestions. I want all the constructive criticism. 

* Finite, although it can eat and grow. 
* Slowly hurts anything not wearing boots, except Endermen. It's acidic, and apparently Endermen are immune to it but not water. 
* It flows downhill, and it tries to stick together as one blob. 
* Pools are generally a full block in volume, but it'll spread out in a very thin layer. (You know how water that's flowing but the source gets cut off sort of becomes a flat puddle before vanishing? That's the Amoeba's typical form when discovered.) 
* It'll randomly scoot around, as long as its not flowing uphill. Slowly it's feeling for some plant to eat, it really likes Chorus plants but flowers and grass and crops will do. And meat, but it can't sense that. 
* It'll stretch out a tendril toward a plant if it's within a 3 block radius. 
* Items that fall in get absorbed, and add 1/8 of a cube to its volume. Same with plants.
* Will flow off a cliff and get stuck. 
* Buckets can capture a block of it. 

Player and mob interaction

* Damaging, unless wearing boots or are Enderman. Doesn't even wear out boots if metal or diamond
* You will sink in, but slowly. 
* You float if you sprint

Liquid interactions: 

* General: it avoids liquids. If any comes within a 3 block radius, it gathers together, any partial blocks climb on top of the rest. It can climb up slopes, but it must sacrifice one block to use to flow upwards, otherwise it can't escape. 
* Lava: If forced to touch, the amoeba becomes End Gel. 

* Water: Both freeze into a strange End Ice. 

* End Gel:Unlike slime, this is 100% bouncy, no sticky slime balls to drop. Unlike slime, this acts like a trampoline. Upon landing, you sink in a little then back up. If you jump while rising back, you add 15% to your jump height. Shift will not hurt you when you land, but you will sink in a lot further before coming to a rest. 
* End Ice: No fiction at all, you can slide on it without stopping but you can't change direction. Well, you can't without sprinting, anyway. Sneaking will slow you down as much as if you were on normal ice, but it won't catch edges.

Perhaps they could make things interesting by having regions with different landforms, such as a Desert variant designed to make sand dunes, a jungle with hills and intentional waterfalls...

Specific ideas:

Vanilla flavored: 

* The Dunes. Desert, with a lot of wave shaped sand mountains. Steeper than anything found in vanilla. 
* The Berg. Ice cube out in the middle of the ocean, does not touch bottom of sea.
* Shrublands. Populated by bushes made of spruce needles, with some coarse dirt patches.
* Volcano. Single mountain with crater on peak, could be filled with water or lava or obsidian or just rock. Obsidian streaks and gravel patches and coarse dirt scattered all over the sides.
* Mangrove Forest. Basically combine the jungle with the swamp. 
* Ridge Forest. Up where I'm from in the Rockies, spruce forests are pretty dense, basically just plant a ton of shrubs as well as the evergreen trees. Ferns aren't cutting it. Also make the terrain gen more resemble a slightly tamed-down Extreme Hills. Should rename it but I don't know what to call it. Ed, thanks to u/derborgus3333 for the idea to rename it Ridge; before I called it Rockies referring to the mountains I live near to.
* Ridge River. Can you put boulders and whirlpools in the middle of a narrow river? 
* Ridge Lake. Not enough lily pads and blue flowers in the entire swamp to full this, also use some sugarcane to substitute for cattails. Plants everywhere. 
* Palouse Hills. Lots of hills, very round hills, no trees. IRL this place is amazing for wheat and legume farming, are biome-based bonuses on this kind of thing possible?

Not-so-vanilla weirdness that still sounds cool:

* Petrified Forest. A mix between jungle and swamp, but with granite and diorite instead of logs and no leaves. Shallow dirt layer. Can we make a brown stone?
* The Infection. A small ""biome"" themed after the Nether, with a broken portal at the center and obsidian veins sprawling away from the portal. Netherrack, soul sand, etc for ground, with a gradiented layer of stained clay gradienting from red to black to grey between the netherrack and the stone underneath.
* The Crater. A large rim surrounding a flattened stone pit, with a spire of iron in the center. Also, one or two flattened bone pancakes, poor dino :( In the code, this should be codenamed Chicxulub.
* The Glitch. Jagged on purpose, it'll be obvious when you see it. Chunks are flattened, and there are large block pits and mounds here and there, as well as perfectly square trees. 
* The floating isle. Over the ocean, spawn a small Ender-esque island, but made of classic blocks. An island in the sky, over the ocean. Could resemble any biome
* Ruined Kingdom. Creeper craters everywhere, with some filled with water, statues here and there, broken structures here and there...",minecraftsuggestions,"A few biome ideas.

Also, there could be a gamerule called SlingshotSharing, where if you hold any item in offhand and fire the slingshot at a player, they can catch that item. Perfect for teamwork, and for ensuring that another player picks it up without anyone intercepting it. This idea is secondary tho.

What I plan to do is make Rose Gold with Redstone however. 

# What is it? 

* Gold nugget + Redstone = Rose Wiring. 
* Conducts redstone signal, but is solid so you can choose which sides it connects to, unlike redstone powder which connects on all sides. 
* Can be made into block, but doesn't generate signal. 
* Conducts redstone signal and connects to redstone dust. 
* Let's paint it the color of copper. 

# Why make this? 

* As it is wiring rather than dust trails, you can have parallel wires without them connecting, you have to manually bend them to cross the wires. Means much more compact circuitry, however fully compatible as you can choose to have it connect on all sides. 
* As it is a metal, it should be strong enough to make rods, in which case it should be good enough to go upwards! 
* As it's more solid, it should be a better conductor. I'm pretty sure copper filings in a tube wouldn't conduct as well as actual copper wire. 
* ~~The color could be interesting and its a metal, why not let it be used to craft a new armor and tool set? Something between gold and iron, but since its got redstone in it lets make it very receptive to enchantments.~~ Fine, I guess it's not that great an idea.

# How?  
Gold ingots can be crafted into nuggets right? One nugget + one redstone = 5 RoseGold wire pieces. 

Wires are only straight, unless you bend it in the table. 

* three wires in the grid in an L shape, returns 3 Bent wires, right click to rotate. Intentionally fits in personal crafting grid. 
* Straighten any wire by placing in grid, maybe by trying to stack it in with wire? Nah, too different. 
* Craft a T intersection by drawing this intersection. Only returns two, but can be uncrafted simply by placing in the table. 
* Craft fourway intersection by either putting one on each side or making a 2x2 square, returns one until uncrafted. 
* Craft the Vertical Rod by drawing a ""door"" with wire in the table. Can uncraft. 

* Turn wire and nuggets into ingots by making a 3x3 in table. In recipes other than bending wire, nuggets and wire are interchangeable. 
* Ingots can be turned into nuggets, or into wire by placing two end to end. 

Any piece can be rotated once placed. For realism, maybe they can all drop bent wire when broken, I wouldn't care since straightening is simple as setting them in the table.

Once that's settled, time to ramp it up a bit isn't it? Let's add some new challenges for the hardcore. These should have a second difficulty switch. (Simple difficulty curve VS Challenging difficulty curve). Taking some inspiration from Tough As Nails but some I made up on my own. 

* Need sleep, you start getting dizzy if you don't rest for 3 days. Doesn't happen unless you craft a bed or sleep in one. 
* Need water, but only after your first time swimming. Buckets of water are drinkable, but are now labelled by cleanliness, either Clean, Dirty, Filthy, Salty, Boiled, or Purified, depending on where you got it. Rivers are clean, swamps are filthy, everything else dirty. Boil it in a furnace to Sanitize it, craft Charcoal Filter to Purify it (Paper charcoal sandwich). Like rotten meat, water that isn't clean has a chance of giving you a random negative potion, dirtier water having greater chance of being bad with Filthy having 80% of being bad. Also salty water actually costs some Hydration points while Purified gives double hydration points. 
* Heat. You catch fire if you're in direct desert sun for too long, like skeletons, but diamond armor can keep you cool too, but iron and gold actually speed up the overheating process. Also you get Hypothermia (slow Wither + Nausea) effect if you're in a snowy biome and in water, and can be cured immediately by being near fire, or slowly by going inside as defined by being under a ceiling made of any artificial block.",minecraftsuggestions,Difficulty curve.

Yes, the dreaded Sandwitch, who instead of throwing potions, drops sand on your head. Pack a shovel. 

* Yellow and cyan outfit. 
* Obeys line-of-sight rule. 
* Very vulnerable to suffocation, in case you trick her into getting stuck in her own trap. Or as u/toast0727 suggests, instead she's rather strong against suffocation and instead her weakness is water which causes her to melt and dissolve.
* First attack, conjures block of sand over you, 3x3x3. 
* Secondary attack, constructs sandstone cage around you and drops in two sand, suffocating anyone not expecting it but allowing someone with quick reflexes to jump off the sand just dropped in. 
* For my next trick I'm borrowing InfiniteNexus' idea below: Another cloud of particle sand, this slows with status effects, blinds you with particles, and lingers for 5 seconds or so. Also, damages over time. 
* Sand could be either color but is usually yellow. 
* Drops one of a few predefined sets of items: either two bread and some random meat, sticks sand sugarcane, 1-4 sand, shovel and bucket, or, after a very long battle only for this one, diamond shovel of Silk Touch.
* On islands that occupy one single chunk, there's a chance of a Sandwitch Hut generating. Just the same but made with birch and sandstone.
* Achievement: Like bringing knives to a gunfight. Kill Sandy with an anvil. 

Why it's great 

* Interesting new mob, puns are fun 
* It's an anti-creeper. Instead of leaving craters everywhere it leaves sand everywhere for you to clean up. 
* Requires a new strategy. Like creepers you can't just charge in swords flailing. 
* Makes a nonrenewable resource renewable. But it wasn't rare to start, so it's perfect for challenges like Skyblock. 
* While it could be farmed for sand, this one you actually have to fight in order to get loot, unlike golem grinding.

* Higher speed 
* More momentum 
* Similarly to boats and Elytra, it's harder to turn sharply. 
* Works on all kinds of ice. Packed, normal, and Frost. 
* Wears down ever so slowly while sliding. 
* If you trip (try to slide onto a block that's not ice), you go flying head-first and crash, similar crash damage code to Elytra. Also you're one block tall while this is happening, you're on your belly. 
* While skating, everything has knockback doubled, at cost of the player being slowed down if they attack a mob. 
* Acceleration is a key detail, you don't go from 0 to full speed in less than a second. 
* While skating at high speed, and wearing Elytra, it is possible to jump and take off... But let's cap maximum altitude at 10 blocks higher than you started unless they implement Fireworks Engines or whatever.

First and foremost, we need to have some **prewritten books**, it'd make some things interesting and others easier. 

They should show up as various types of loot. Villager trades, chests, rare monster drops... 

* **Redstone manual**. Is. A. MUST! 
* **Wildlife guide**, stuff like where certain mobs are more likely to be found. Let's assume the author hasn't been to the nether tho. 
* **Diet handbook**. Table for different foodstuffs. 
* ""Have you been to all the biomes?"" workbook, still editable. 
* Brewing for the Apprentice. 
* A list of enchantments 
* **Crafting recipes for Dummies** 
* The adventures of Montana James: *Journey to the Farlands, Nether you mine, and To the End and Back*. Could be used as a mini novel, but I'd like the idea of a kid reading it and deciding to try to become the legend they just read about. 
* The journal of a villager that became a zombie and locked himself up or got lost in a cave, to protect the village or family. (Referencing another suggestion of mine, [The Orchard](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/416dok/more_types_of_crops_and_a_rare_orchard/) look at the end 

Other simple, easy to make details that could be done with command blocks: 

* **Tutor villager** sells them for emeralds. 
* Maybe spawn them in the Noob Chest, as well as some dungeon chests. 
* As a secret similar to the records dropped by creepers killed by skeletons, skeletons killed by anvils drop books. Or something like this. 

More features I'd love to see but are somewhat more complicated: 

* **Formatting buttons** 
* Generating these should be toggleable before worldgen. 
* Bookshelves. Not boxes painted to look like bookshelves. A chest specifically for storing books, signed or blank or with quill inside, the texture indicates how full it is and opening it shows the books in alphabetical order, unwritten books sorted by content in lieu of title. 
* **Dyeable cover**. You could store this in the book's content with one of those weird symbols, do something like ""If the book starts with §# the next word is the color for the cover.""
* **Cover page**, a spot for the title and a spot for the author's name. What's important is that it shows the cover when you open the book. 
* Multiple designs. Just a few simple cover choices, hitting a button cycles through them. Stuff like choosing between using a latch or not, having a colored rectangle, a stripe, some icon... I dunno, this may need some work let's not worry about it too much. 
* **Letter**. Basically like a book, but limited to 2048 letters and you get the ink back. 
* **Mailbox**. A small chest only you can look in (toggle with gamerule ""strangersCheckMail"") that can hold any item that's not a full block, same capacity as a small chest.

* Must be turned on in settings or /gamerule 
* Of course most of these things are intended to be hard to get, but sometimes for new guys it's more convenient to get it from a villager. Let's make it costly tho.

* Stonemason. Sells all types of minerals like Prismarine, Netherrack, Quartz, Granite... Dirt too, who knows, it'd be good on Skyblock maps. 
* Bulk Distributor for rare materials, not sure what to call it. Paper, leather, sticks, diamond, iron... The idea isn't so much about rare merch here than buying in bulk.

If they do this in some order we can use this! 

1. Upon account creation, autogenerate a few Trap Passwords (Trapwords, anyone?) that the user never sees. A few should be near the beginning in alphabetical order, and a few near the end. And all are shorter than the real thing, but varying length. For added security let's put two traps near the real thing (as in nearby when alphabetized but still different enough to be hard to type on accident). Some of these traps need to be common passwords. The system should check if the trap matches the real password and rerolls if it *does* match.

2. Bot comes along and generates a bunch of passwords. It's more likely to discover a trapword than the real password due to statistics and strategy. 

3. Upon receiving a trapword the server can do a few things. I like the idea of emailing the user and distracting the hacker by feeding him fake generated data. Or we could just do the obligatory YOU JUST ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD. I would suggest to ban the IP address but I forgot about proxies. I dunno, I have no idea what happens next, I mean, the user's password is still secret so all we can say is that someone's trying to hack them. 12 year old me would say to throw a virus at them but now we're just getting messy.

* Flows out to a radius of 3 similar to lava. Ingredients can affect this, such as Slowness making it slower and syrupy, while Swiftness spreads further. 
* When potions and/or water are next to each other, they should create a one-block line of Mixed Potion blocks similarly to how lava and water react, which basically acts either like a watered-down version or like if you brewed those two potions in the same bottle. 

The ingredients should mess with the liquid's properties as well. 

* Unless the potion had redstone, it lasts exactly how long you stay in the potion bath. 
* Gunpowder would make it spread out further, base spread is 3. 
* Dragon Breath causes the potion to have a perpetual cloud of Lingering vapor above the block. With this you could make a carpet bridge over the potion and still be affected.

It'll have lower health unless with armor, since its made of sticks. Also its gotta have a hard recipe because it's going to be advanced. 

1. Place a redstone block in ground. 
2. Place chest in front of redstone block and one block higher. 
3. Place armor stand in front of chest and on redsrone, facing front of chest. 
4. Pumpkin + redstone block + leather cap 
5. Place head on top of stand. Watch as the Stickman steps off of the base. Oh and he needs arms, should be a simple fix right? 

The golem gets 3 hearts, and can mend itself if given sticks and strings. (1 stick, 1 string, 1 heart after 15 second wait.) When idle he stands on the base looking away from the chest, doing a breathing animation (not really breathing but he wants to look lifelike.) He gets half the inventory space you do. Also, he returns to the base either at sundown or when his inventory is full, and sleeps thru the night. And he shouldn't go further than a 3 chunk radius away from the base. Put an item in his hand and he'll go do that job. If he gets damaged, say half a heart left, I can't decide if he should keep going or give up and go home. 

Now, I know this will seem a bit overpowered, hence I wanted to make his stats weak and his crafting really expensive, but I don't know what to do to make it more fair. But the OP abilities is the whole point so bear with me. The whole idea is to make an NPC who does stuff to help out. To add a little weaksauce tho, mobs are aggressive to him unless he's standing still. Also, some of these jobs should probably be skipped and some more would be skipped anyway but I wanted to say all of them anyway. 

For assigning jobs, he has to be on his base. No way to give him a new job until he goes back home, although a quit command could be a good idea, maybe tell him to stop by slapping him or taking his tools. (implying you can see his inventory. Good idea?) Also, to move his base just mine it. He'll follow you around until you place the base again. However, it must be on a redstone cube again and must be near a chest. 

Jobs: 

* Farmer. Give him a crop item or seed and he'll grow more of what you've got as long as there's already some of that thing planted. If it's cactus he has a 1/16 chance of hurting himself 1/2 a heart. When he's through with one crop he'll check the chest to see if you left more seeds for him. Being an unintelligent robot, he has a 25% chance of cutting a melon vine or pumpkin vine, or the base of a sugarcane, in which chase he replants it where it was. 
* Lumberjack. Give him an axe and he'll go cut trees. Put saplings in his chest or hand and he'll replant, and if you put a log in his hand he'll look for that specific type of tree. Give him an apple and he'll specifically break oak leaves searching for them. And getting the logs cut when he's done. Of course, he only gets what he can reach from the ground. 
* Flower Gardener. Give him bonemeal and he alternates between spreading the bonemeal, picking flowers, mowing the lawn, fertilizing large flowers, and restarting. 
* Miner. Give him a pickaxe, and he looks for either exposed minerals or the nearest cave (Defined by dark place surrounded by stone or dirt). Give him a mineral and he'll look for something specific, or give him cobble and he'll choose to instead widen the cave a little, smoothing it out and making it more square and level. 
* Landscaper. Give him a shovel and he'll attempt to smooth out the area, removing hills and filling dips. (Algorithm: Search for air blocks with dirt on 3 sides, and search for dirt blocks with air on 3 sides.). Alternatively, give him sand or gravel and he'll look for that type of block and mine, careful to not make too steep a slope that he can't get out. 
* Shepherd. Give him shears and he'll hit all the sheep in 3 block radius, obeying line-of-sight. Use dyed wool or dyes to choose a specific color. 
* Butcher/farmer. Give him a sword and he'll go slaughter some animals. Give him the sword *and* wheat or carrots and he'll breed the animals when there's two left. Or just the food and he'll just breed them. 
* Fisherman. You can figure it out. 
* Sentry. Give him a bow and arrows, and he'll shoot anything unfriendly like a Snowlem. Stays in one place unless on leash, but he walks slowly because he doesn't want to mess up his aim. 
* Potion guy. Give him splash portions or lingering potions, and he follows you. If he got harmful potions he throws them at enemies, if he got good potions he throws at you when you give him the signal: looking at him and ""waving"". 
* Mechanical vandal. Only on hard mode. Give him flint and steel, and he'll set stuff on fire. Self explanatory, sometimes you just want to see the world burn. 
* Interior Designer. Give him two similar blocks of different color, dump a lot of one in the chest, and he'll get to work. He breaks blocks matching what's in his left hand and replaces them with what's in his right. Put necessary tools in the chest. 
* Auto Crafter. Plunk a table in front of him, make a thing, and give him the thing. He looks in the chest to see if he has inventory to make more. Also works on furnace, anvil, and brewing stand. 
* Copycat architect. No idea how to assign it but the idea is to show him what you want him to build and tell him where to build it, harvesting resources in the same manner done before. 

Boss idea on the side: Herobrine Boss Battle. Give him a player head and he'll look at you confused. Did you kill a player, or ask him to kill someone? Either way, that goes against the Laws of Robotics right? He goes mad from having to choose between lawfulness and obedience or loyalty and instead just goes on a rampage, arbitrarily choosing tasks and constructing his own tools. He can mine, he can craft, he can build, he doesn't need you, right? And maybe some time after he runs away, he crafts armor and initiates the ultimate boss battle: Doppelganger Duel. 

Other cosmetic ideas: 

* Dances when there's a jukebox around, walks in a bouncy way. 
* Dogs run away from him, unless you're around. 
* Asks villagers for trades. Or villagers being able to ask him to do jobs.
* Trades flowers with Iron Golem. 
* If his inventory is full and some are flowers, he plants a row of flowers to lighten his load.
* Sprints away from exactly 3 things: Lava, fire, and flaming zombies. *Especially* the flaming zombies.
* Distracted by bunnies and tiny slimes.
* Rare naturally spawning variant found in village. Have to give him an emerald to get one day's worth of work out of him.",minecraftsuggestions,Enchanted armor stand.

Yes it needs water, no it doesn't exactly need to be a full meter deep... Halves would be good, but to keep it similar to actual water flow it should have 8 levels. Just like snow. 

How would it interact with full liquid blocks? Well... I'm making this up on the fly but we may have to retool how fluid mechanics work altogether... Each ""block"" of water should have two Depth tags, how much there is total (to allow excess water to flow in) and retained water (how much is kept when the inflowing water is gone). So the source block says ""8 8"", meaning it is full, the block next to it says ""6 0"" because it's 0.6 m deep yet it isn't a source. The part where it gets interesting is the half-block ones. Labeled 0.4 deep when not flooded, but if something flows into it it adjusts to that depth. 

Is this too crazy? Maybe. Would this be useful? Perhaps, it could be used for shallow streams. I'd really love for it to interact properly with slabs tho. 

Edit, for taking 1/8 of a block of water maybe the bowl would be the tool.

Hands up if you ever archive binge on a comic or a blog. Keep them up if you've forgotten to bookmark where you left off. Keep them up if you wish it would just bookmark automatically, and maybe automagically calculate how much is left and even tell you when they've updated.  
^Oh ^wait ^I ^can't ^see ^your ^hands. 

Other attempts to solve:  
[Comic Rocket](http://comic-rocket.com) is what I think of, and while its pretty good, it *desperately* needs improved. It indexes the comics serverside, and clientside you get a list of Serials which are lists of urls for the comics, hopefully in order, and containing a flag that indicates where you left off. When reading, it adds a toolbar via iFrame with a scrubber and a button to Add To Comics if you're new to this one, as well as sharing and going back to your list. 

So why not just use that?  
This service is *excellent*, but it's the first of its kind and can be greatly improved.  
* A lot more of this work can be done clientside with no burden on the user. A lot of what we need, most browsers do anyway. (Particularly tracking history and uploading it to Sync)
* Also the indexing service is awkward, a lot of comic series have titles in the urls instead of numbers, so the bot isn't good at recognizing order automatically on the first pass and only gets the order figured out when looking for new comics. 
* Also, I don't have this issue, but others say it really trips up on comics with an ""are you old enough or do you want the censored version"" page. 
* For some reason scaling is AWFUL on mobile. (Edit, redacted a comment about the app, apparently it's in early beta so of *course* it's missing a ton of stuff)
* It breaking on mobile should count for 5 reasons. 

What to do about it:  
Someone should make a tool, be it app, browser mod, or site, that has Smart Bookmarks.  
Bare minimum, 
* Each bookmark file tracks history similarly to a browser tab 
* Upon closing tab, it automatically replaces this bookmark itself with the current url  
If you want to be awesome 
* Share bookmarks on Facebook or something, or if it's a site, allow people to view your bookmark list like a Facebook page (ComicRocket is *great* as far as social stuff goes, you can even PM the author of a comic or check out your friends lists) 
* Use other people's synced bookmarks to figure out the serial order, so if you're going to follow CR's model it can actually figure out the order more accurately and detect moved pages. That would mean my idea would have to be used for an Index Doctor mode or something, but having either of these would be an improvement. 
* Sorting options. The site sorts by how many pages are left, this is awesome, but not always practical for those guys who bookmark tons of comics. Better than the app tho, the only option is alphabetical.  
If you want to be completely unbelievably amazing 
* Panel detection. Zoom in on the individual panels in the strip on a tap. 
* Preloading. This is the only reason the app isn't completely dead to me. It downloads the next comic while you're reading this one, and holds onto the previous one. It deletes the one before that tho. The idea is to have a buffer, and keep that buffer long enough that in case you hit the button before you can read the end you still have it in memory.",SomebodyMakeThis,SMT: a browser or bookmark thing specifically for webcomics and blog archive binges,https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/51a3c6/smt_a_browser_or_bookmark_thing_specifically_for/

That way, you could decorate better, have better signs, maybe even wallpaper tiles. 

Paintings are just white until you use them on an easel (recipe uses a bunch of sticks), when they open a painting tool. You get the same color set as dyes for leather, and the typical toolkit (Brush, flood, picker) Alternative to painting, you could throw an item at it as a template. The paintings are just 16x16, but the Easel can stick canvases together, when you hang them they move around until they can fit, bottom left trying to fit onto the block you clicked. 

Other blocks: 

Printing press. Not just for books anymore. Craft with a piston, any dye, and 3 paper. It opens a UI for copying banners, books, and paintings now, only way to copy paintings. 

Wallpaper. 2x2 papers in a grid makes a blank wallpaper, insert into printing press to color it. Mechanically, it just looks like a planks block with wallpaper on one side. Under the hood, when you use it on a wooden block it replaces said block with ""Wallpaper block"", which has three data spots, one for what type of block it will drop, one for which faces are papered, and one for the art design. Also, dragon breath bottles can be used as wallpaper remover. The point is to be able to have one block with two colors on different sides. 

Tiles. Crafted using polished stone of any kind in slab formation but yields 12, it's flat as carpet and you can use the press to paint them. It's basically a painting for your floor. White carpet can get this too but tiles can placed underwater and look right. 

Glass paintings. Glass panes in the printing press yields a transparent painting that acts like normal panes, white pixels are interpreted as clear. Requires silk to break. Unlike normal glass, a blank one only has white streaks on the sides, not the edge of the face, the edge when you look from the side. 

Tshirts. Wool shirts can be crafted like armor, and run through the press. 

Tiny side idea for realism, using the painting on a filled cauldron will randomly shift the color of each pixel slightly. Or painting + water bottle in the printing press.

When I open and close the CD tray, it always asks for a different CD. Even if I didn't do anything that asks for a disk. It tries to autoplay the disk but fails and asks for a different disk. Even if there's not one in there, or if I have a brand new music disk or game or whatever. It's an infinite loop, it freaks when I close the tray so the only way to close the tray is to shut it off first. 

I also noticed that it hangs up if I bump the eject button while its booting up and close it again if there was a CD in there. I should test note. 

What's completely baffling is that when I finally took it to a techie in person to have him check the wires it worked just fine! He sent me back home only for me to record a gif of said problem and email him. And I did manage to install a game at one point. And the other techie I sent it to for other reasons completely ignored the CD drive, presumably because he found no issues either ( The monitor was crushed, but the CD player was weird before that. ). It always breaks when I have it except in the presence of another nerd what is this magic. No, it's not the way I hold it, I tried it both on my lap and on a table in a different building.

Alternatively, it can be designed to place horizontally, and redstone would make it fall and ensnare a mob from above. You know, make a pressure plate trigger the nets falling.  
Both design ideas scare chickens and rabbits and endermen. 

* Net on a stick. Craft how it sounds, maybe two sticks for handle. Use it to catch chickens and rabbits, maybe baby zombies too. The net is out of commission while it holds the mob, but you can use it again to set it loose, say in a fence or over in the neighbor's yard or a lava pit.

Can someone tell me what's wrong? Is this just not necessary, is it too complicated or pointless, what exactly do the haters hate? 

Here's a few ideas around fish. 

1. ACTUAL MOB. Same spawning rules as squids, except maybe giving different types different rules such as depth or biome. Something basic such as the big fish only being in oceans tho. The models for the tiny ones could be like the 1 pixel wide things the Items get

2. Different types.  
.Colorful fish living near jungles, including goldfish which is inedible like clown fish.  
.Giant tuna and swordfish, which live in ocean along with pufferfish. Also sharks and dolphins, which can't be caught. Sharks act like wolves; ""Don't hurt me and I won't hurt you."", dolphins... maybe tamable?  
.Electric eels, swamps only. Hurt only if you touch them but don't actively search for you.  
.Salmon only spawn in biomes with spruce trees.  
.Let's rename the generic one Trout, they spawn everywhere. Or cod if it's in the ocean. (they're saltwater fish irl)   
.Desert biome gets a skeletal fish. Useless, unless you're feeding cats or looking for a weird pet.  
.Catfish spawn in water blocks that happen to be on top of dirt. Not gravel or sand. (IRL they like muddy rivers generally)
.Some kind of lava fish exclusively found in the nether?

3. Fish tank, and fish bucket. The tank is technically a hybrid of a chest and a cauldron, created by the same recipe as a cauldron but with glass panes. Pour water in it, and place fish in it, and they'll swim around! The fish bucket is necessary to hold a live fish, though. You can either go swimming and have a 50 chance of catching by ""attacking"" with a bucket, or if the mechanics get redesigned, crafting a live fish and a water bucket together.

4. Redesigned fishing mechanics. This part may get long and may not be worth considering, as it's not specifically ""better fish mechanics"".  
The rods need to be more realistic for this to work. Have casting work similar to a bow and have some distance, and also when you hold the button you reel slowly. The lure sinks slowly, and the line acts like a leash. (Walk backwards, the lure moves closer. Walk forwards, the lure has some room for random drifting.)  
 When you cast, it checks if there are any small fish nearby. (Small = anything but sharks and dolphins.) If there are at least 2 in the chunk, fine, if not we'll get to that. Fish look at the lure, and every second have a 1/64 chance of deciding to bite.
If the lure hits the bottom, it will switch back to the classic mode of fishing: Random selection between fish, which might include random junk or prizes. Or, if there's no fish in the area, it'll spawn a ""random"" fish, an invisible mob that acts like the above, despawns when the lure disappears, and picks a prize when reeled in just like the current mechanics.  
A freshly caught fish is called ""Live [x]"", and has a durability bar underneath it showing how much oxygen it has. It lives for a minute unless you put it in the crafting table, either alone to give a Raw Fish, or with a water bucket to get Fish In A Bucket, perfect for fishtanks.",minecraftsuggestions,More fish!

**Crafting**: Dirt slabs are half-blocks of dirt, so to make it, just place 3 dirt blocks next to each other on a table and get 6. To undo, place two slabs next to each other and get one cube back, or even more simply stack them while building and it becomes a cube
 

**What's unique**: The block is an unstable platform, just like those collapsing boardwalks in Mario games or loose overhangs in Sonic.

**What it does**:
It's got 4 forms: Plain dirt, grassy, podzol, and mycelium. These have roots showing through the texture from underneath.  
Most importantly, it's *semistable*. If it's triggered, it will shudder and collapse after a second, falling and dropping whatever is above it.  
It's stable if either its above a solid block or connected to 2-4 blocks on the sides, unless they're more half dirt or sand/gravel, so if it's surrounded by three and you drop something on it, nothing should happen.   
One other effect: you can't jump off of an unstable block. This triggers the block breaking, so jumping is disabled to simulate the block absorbing the jump. 

**Triggers**  

* Redstone
* Breaking a block next to it or moving that block with a piston. This includes dirt slabs which break it in an eighth of the time, we want this chain-reaction friendly. 
* Anything besides chickens or baby animals walking on it, unless sneaking
* A sneaky or light animal jumping on it or falling from over a meter. 
* Sand or anvil falling on it.
* Being in range of any explosion, if it survives the blast itself.
* Easter egg gag: Dropped feathers break it instantly. 

**Why?** 
Because it's *unique*. The only other platform that can be taken away is a trapdoor, but it isn't nearly as versatile as this. It can be useful for traps, adventure maps, new temples, sinkholes, more realistic canyons, you name it.  
Actually, I like the idea of it being used as a lid for an underground structure, maybe an abandoned dwarven temple city or something. (If that idea gets used, no need to implement dwarves, it's an abandoned city.)

[MVP form:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvCri1tqIxQ) Intersections roll an RNG every minute, 16 numbers. 1-4 means a zombie spawns, unless it reaches the cap of ten in a half mile radius. 5-12 means a free pistol spawns, but depending on how long the game's been going that range shrinks down to 1.

Zombies spawned after an even roll favor turning clockwise, odd = clockwise. Also, spawned on 1-2 means favoring turning, 3-4 = walking straight, for a total of 4 easy AIs. They die if they are shot or walk out of the mile radius, and they match your walking pace.

The first item is a pistol. You have a trigger button, and it will destroy a zombie directly down the street you're on or closest to. One bullet each.

Score = steps taken since start + 25 per dead zombie.

Perhaps to simplify further, we try making it with a controller and premade map and then try making a map from G-maps then add gps control. 

---
  
Zombies should wind up having a few strategies, similar to Pacman 256. You know, some that are fast but can't find you easily, some that are slow but do track you, that sort of thing. 

There should also be 3 types of items: Tower bases that can be placed on the side of a road, powerups that can be used in-hand or on a turret, and some kind of energy/currency like PacDots or Ingress XM.  The powerups would have a very strong but short ability when used in-hand, and a perpetual but somewhat weak effect when used in a turret. Back to the pistol, in-hand would be an insta-kill while giving it to a turret would be a low-power but recharging weapon that could fight off multiple zombies. Also, the turrets would get an upgrade tree, like Bloons TD5, each upgrade costing another power of the same type and some of the currency.",SomebodyMakeThis,"[SMT] A PacMan maze, using real maps and player location, meets tower defense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/4906dx/smt_a_pacman_maze_using_real_maps_and_player/

### New things:  
Blocks: Magnetite ore, magnetite block, magnetized iron, switch magnet (?)  
Items: Magnetite lump, magnetized iron ingot, mineral locator (?), horseshoe magnet  
""Enchantment"": Magnetic. 3 levels, no book (or requires 2048 levels?). Used to indicate magnetic tools and items.

### Obtaining:  
There is a rare mineral IRL called Magnetite. It's basically iron in a rarer crystalline structure that lines up and amplifies the magnetic properties of iron. (It's quantum level complicated) In MC it could be a very rare variant of iron ore. Magnetite ore drops 1-3 magnets, which are just lumps of the stuff.  
No smelting is required, but *maybe* it could be smelted to get standard iron, as it is an iron compound. You guys decide.  
I want to also design an equivalent to an electromagnet, but I wouldn't know what to call it other than a Switch magnet.  
Crafting recipes are at the end.  

###Large magnets  
Magnetite cubes and magnetized iron behave exactly the same; If an iron block of any kind lines up with the magnet, the two will attract. Iron blocks / anvils and magnets will attract each other and meet in the middle, and iron that would be bolted down to things (like iron bars, doors, or hoppers. Ore counts too.) will attract the magnet without dislodging. If you don't want your things to move around, a magnet will be glued down by slime and/or a sticky piston, and so will iron. Useful for machinery stuff, especially if the Switch magnet gets implemented.
  Also, magnetic items will attract to the magnet, and the iron golem will drift to the magnet and struggle to get away.  
The effective range is 3m for items, and 5m for golems and cubes. But only iron items. 

###Magnetic items
Magnetic items have two properties. 
All of them will attract iron items from a further range. Each magnet has a level of 1-4. If it's a hand item, it boosts the attract range 25% per level. If it's armor magnetism stacks, and each level grants 10% to the attract range. Punching while holding a magnet grants a 10% boost for .25 seconds. (You're not punching, you're waving the magnet a little closer to the shiny thing)  
Hand items have another property: When you're near placed iron or iron ore, the magnets will ""buzz"" and look like it's trying to fly toward the thing. If you toss it while it's buzzing and you don't have magnets on, it'll lead you to the iron and stick to the wall if there's rock in the way. Let's say the range is 1 for each level if obstructed, and triple that if unobstructed. 

###Locator compass  
Elsewhere, u/accountnumber3 suggested that this idea of locating minerals be bumped up a notch, where we make a unique advanced compass that can locate the nearest mineral vein of its type, such as a golden compass that points to the closest gold. Thought it's worth throwing in, especially to make spelunking more interesting, I have no idea why it works so let's just say redstone = magic. The recipe should be fairly expensive, but as it's not inherently overpowered it should be somewhere between that and cheap.

###Chart of magnetic levels  
Switch magnets have no charge unless placed and powered.  
1: Magnetic lump, magnet ore (Silk or creative).  
2: Magnetite cube, magnetic ingot  
3: Any magnetized armor or tools (ie built with magnetized iron.)  
4: The Horseshoe magnet, The Mystical Book of Magnetism that May or May Not Only Exist In Creative

###Crafting  
Magnetite ore is the only new natural resource, but once you get enough, you can have as many magnets as iron you can find.  
Magnetite cube: Fill table with magnetite lumps  
Magnetized iron: Place an iron block and place magnetite on each side. Big block will separate to form 9 magnetic ingots, as expected.  
Any magnetic tool or armor: Simply use magnetic iron in place.  
Horseshoe magnet: two magnetic iron pieces, one above the other.   
Mineral Locator: Cube of desired mineral in the center, magnets on the corners, and redstone in the sides.   
Switch Magnet: Magnetite lumps in corners, iron on sides, repeater in center, redstone on the ends.   ",minecraftsuggestions,Magnetism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/477vxl/magnetism/

What if someone made a network that combines aspects of both? Users have individual pages like Facebook, but there are also ""Clubs"" that have the same role as subreddits? 

""Why?"" Because not only could people follow their friends and converse with their own circles of friends, but they could also search for communities like here. Users could choose to use it for communication with their own friends or the world at large, because *both* have the tools provided for it. 

On a technical side, there could be a special ""smart sub"" for friends. Unlike the normal subs that behave much like Reddit, the viewers in this sub would only see posts from the people they follow, even if that post belongs in an actual sub.

First, if this gets implemented, apple trees are coming in and Oak apples are going. Because who finds apples in an oak tree? Also, fruit trees have a few phases.

1. Sapling, duh
2. Basic tree
3. After time, leaves have a chance to turn into blossoms
4. After time, blossoms have a chance to become a fruit block. 
5. After more time, leaves might spread to fill the hole where the fruit was. It won't spread outside of the tree's original shape, and stop if the trunk gets cut up.

Yes this implies being able to set down a fruit, but let's just make that work similarly to flowers. 

I was originally thinking of apple trees, but it could be a few other things too. For one thing, I saw a mod that implemented nuts (which could be collected and roasted, edible but no saturation), and this could also be done with mangoes and oranges and well, any tree fruit. Also, pine/spruce trees could create pinecones, which can be used as fuel (Same burn as a stick) or projectile dealing half a heart of damage. Thrown through fire, and it would light a creeper on fire.

Part 2, small shrubs. It's a block that resembles a crop and has 6 phases. 4 growth phases, unripe fruit, and ripe fruit. If you punch it while it's ripe, it'll drop fruit and fall back to unripe phase, and when punched again it'll break off, dropping seeds. (Craft seed same way as a melon seed.) I'd like to see strawberries, blueberries, jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, sweet peas, a talker variant for corn... You can see where it'll go. I could name dozens that fit this model. 

Part 3, thornbush berries. It's something between the fruit tree and the shrub. But let's start over. The sapling has 4 stages until it generates a root block underneath, which when broken without silk touch drops dirt and sticks. The root block replaces the sapling block with leaves, then flowers, then unripe fruit, then ripe fruit. The thorn bushes can be either raspberry or blackberry. The catch is that it hurts you when you walk into it like a cactus, and it slows you if you fall in it, like a less extreme web. And it has to be cut with shears if you want it removed fast. I'm ok with it dropping sticks because I don't know what to do with thorn vines other than a really weird whip thing. (I guess it should be planted by seed, but I don't know how they sell them IRL)

While taking about spiky things: cactus fruit. Look it up. 

Some people will ask for these new fruits to have unique effects, and while it'd be hard to come up with a new effect for each fruit, I know one that HAS to have one: Jalapenos set you on fire temporarily, give you speed, and melt snow and ice if you stand on it. Also, keeping with the theme, raspberries or blackberries grant resistance to enchantment of Thorns as well as thorn vines and cacti. There could also be unique fruits such as... Bubble berry that grows underwater and grants water breathing for 15 seconds? I dunno, just throwing around ideas. 

----

These bushes and fruit trees could be rare finds in other green biomes, but I was thinking of them being mainly found in an orchard, which is an alternate possibility when generating villages. It wouldn't necessarily have each type of fruit, but it'd have somewhere between 1 and 5 crop fields, and at least one of those is a fruit tree or berry shrub. It should be basically an alternate to villages. Some advantage to living alone, but not making things radically different.

There'd be a central hut and one villager, the Orchard Farmer. Radiating from the hut are a few paths, most leading to crop fields, rows of berry bushes, or a grid of fruit trees, one type each. One of the paths would lead to the Tool Shed, with buckets, seeds, hoes, and shovels in item frames, and just for fun, two framed books. And of course, a zombie in there, gotta defend the loot. One book is an inventory, and the other is some journal. The journal could have some interesting snips... 

This would also imply that the villagers can work with crops besides wheat and potatoes, but I wouldn't think it'd be a major difference. I *would* like to see villagers having a favorite food that they'd be attracted to, replace a crop with, or maybe even offer a better trade after receiving, but that's another topic...

----

Revised a little, the igloos give me an awesome idea.... Getting side tracked... but I can't help but write something for the journal concept!

Sure, there's the Reversions mechanic, but that's a hassle considering nobody notices anything at first.

I was wondering, what if somebody made a project similar to Wikipedia, and the main articles worked the same, but the Talk side of the article was a Reddit clone? 
For the talk half, there's an auto-generated ""post"" for each article, and the ones with most recent activity are brought to the top of the list. 
And it could interpret the Portals exactly the same as Subreddits, except tweaked to allow a post to exist in multiple subs, so I guess the subs are more like tags / portals than true subs.

I'm referring to the whole ""combos = special moves"" thing. A platform game, and many attacks to choose from but not all of them are effective. Each 'bot can defend itself against certain attacks, and also does attacks that can be countered in a special way. Also maybe some combos can be used as parkour stunts, like [vaulting](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/parkour/images/4/46/DK.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130514035047) or making the Leg Sweep double as a power slide while running. 

Health: 

Instead of ""rings"", your character simply heals over time, maybe every step returns 1% health. I dunno, I'm trying to design it so you can walk into an ambush, kick some butts, and walk away sore but still capable of getting away from the next one. This one needs work. 

Possible plot idea that still needs help: 

A certain popular Digital Assistant software gets replaced with a GlaDOS clone by virus, and uses 3D printing to build a robot army because *someone's* gotta have a good 3D printer that handles both plastic and metal. ... Or something like that.  Each boss battle is a bot factory, and Boss Bots are immunized to attacks you tend to like and weaker to attacks you don't use often.  

Character concepts: 

I have 4 characters in mind: One strong guy who can only handle so much button mashing at a time, one fast guy who's not so strong but can handle *really* fast button mashing, one wizard who's not strong or fast but with the right combo can one-shot even a boss, as long as not interrupted, and a cartoony guy who plays like Sonic, spindash and head bopping and homing attack included. The last guy needs work tho. 

Why do those character types matter? Well, experience and skill levels. Strong guy is like a standard fighting game character. Fast guy is better for the noob who just smashes buttons because he can do a lot of weak attacks real fast like [Dash Incredible](https://youtu.be/-b5OxLRlBr0?t=143). The wizard is for hardcore players who must master all the moves, as a massive challenge. And the Sonic ripoff, for people who just don't get fighter games yet still want to play. What to use here, I have no idea, maybe a cartoony Parkour kid?

I'm getting derailed.

One thing I thought about was how to handle glitches like the MissingNo from Pokemon. This thing is caused by the game reading junk data as a pokemon species ID and stats right?

My idea is that if a Junk ID is detected (should be simple if it checks if the ID is in the dictionary), it replaces the card with a deliberately designed Glitch creature.

Let's say that Indy Studio created ""A Game"" last year and shared it for free. 
Later, someone bought Indy Studio and after the next update started selling A Game for $60.
After this change, Indy deletes all data of the old version, so the only officially available content is the paid version.
Knowing the internet though, someone is going to put the installer for the old version on his site and share it, and making a small profit off the ads that are claimed to be used to fund the site. For kicks let's call the site pi.rates.

Indy Studio finds out about this and decides to sue pi.rates, but pi.rates claims that ""Indy Studio never charged for this version of the game, and neither are we."" The TOA is a basic but strict one that essentially states ""Do not distribute, but you may share footage of the game, as long as it is not for profit.""

The exact game in question is Asphalt 8, and I'll give a quick description here, but the question still applies to all racing games. 
In Asphalt, the only powerup is a Nitro Canister, and you can hold a finite amount of Nitro. You can also collect it by powersliding, going off ramps, and to smaller extents by smashing stuff including other cars. You even get some as a reward if you manage to not hit a wall for a certain amount of time. One more interesting stunt -- but I don't know if it's common -- is using the Power Slide to skid around a corner, then use the free Nitro to break out of the slide and straighten out at the same time, while normally you would just continue to skid for a moment before being *able* to straighten. Oh and you get to smash the other cars too, they respawn at the nearest safe location in 3 seconds.",pcgaming,"Why do so many ""Top racing tips"" include saving a boost for the last stretch?",https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/3m650t/why_do_so_many_top_racing_tips_include_saving_a/

Estimated year of release: Somewhere between 1995 and 2003. Probably.

Notable characters:????? Aliens that looked like big ants. Also astronauts in hovercraft. 

Notable gameplay mechanics:???

Setting: Edge of the solar system. ""Planet X"" was pretty blue and icy, but mountainous. Also populated by enormous ants, and home of a research team.
