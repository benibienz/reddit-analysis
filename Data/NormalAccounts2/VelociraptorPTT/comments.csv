So I go into a game and I will usually load in first. but as soon as i am in the map and actually playing ping shoots to between 150-500. It does it on no other game.

6,"Looking over the Atlantic ocean, the Illuminati's clubhouse is carefully sculpted into the the west face of a cliff face in Cornwall England, every 3 months all the richest, people gather there for one big wager match of godlike proportions. There are wager rivals among the robust philanthropists, like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates.
These two have been especially reckless lately, causing chaos among media for the last 9 months. 

Suddenly a new person comes through the door clipboard in hand, two armed guards by her side, with chained briefcases to there left hands. With a monotone voice, she says ""Hi I am Susan Wojcicki... The CEO of YouTube"" Soon everyone in the club house turns to face her, shouting and screaming ""I WANT TO PLACE A BET!"" she turns to both Bill and Mark and says ""I want a Reverse bet, if you can make youtube worse than it already is I will give you 20 million each"" 

Bill and Mark look at each other and nod. ""BUT!"" Susan says quickly ""If one of you can do it by yourself you get the whole pot plus and extra 10 million."" 

Right away each one gets to work, competing against the other trying to find out ways of making the YouTube system worse. Mark try's hacking the site, Bill try's buying out employee's.

After 3 years all they have done is make YouTube better, they have missed all other wages, not because they didn't care about the money but for pride. Eventually Mark gives up and say's ""screw this"" Bill Gates is still trying hard to see what he could do to destroy this platform that's when he got the idea ""Maybe we can look at all the slightly stupid stuff going on with smaller YouTube accounts"" So he placed a sentinel someone who could stir up the community but yet have a huge fan base so he could never be touched, after the exchanging of some money and a few systems the the operation ""LeafyIsHere"" began. 

The following year caused so much uproar that YouTube had to change it's terms of services, causing the following devastation to the platform, law suits, hatred, fake pranks. The whole site had it's dark underbelly exposed, he exposed YouTube. 

He later received the money, but the rivalry between him and Mark was only fueled.",2016-08-24 08:45:36+00:00,d6ufn6v,1,t3_4z7qtb,54046,WritingPrompts

As you're drifting off into sleep e.g. extremely tired, heavy eyelids. Simply think of your self being dissolved or dissapearing from the feat up to the head. Then open your eyes you won't be able to move anything underneath your head so you can still call for help. This is a weird stage because now what ever you think of can extremely influence your perspective reality and the dream that comes with it. So think of something nice or an adventure and your brain will take it into account a give you a good sleep.

For missing time my mum calls it catnapping it where you fall as sleep and wake up instantly like you do when the hospital after you have had an anesthetic but hours of time have gone by. for the Saturday actually being Friday that itself could well have been a dream and you sleep walked and got yourself a drink of water.",2016-03-21 08:59:39+00:00,d17nv2g,1,t3_4b84e9,60146,nosleep
