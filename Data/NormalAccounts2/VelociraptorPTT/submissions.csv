What I don't understand is the crucible is prothean design, so why were they 3 choices. The protheans wouldn't make a synthesis, control and destroy ending on purpose if anything they would have just put a destroy in there because that was their original plan how would they know that synthesis was the last stage of evolution. The star child was the reapers collective knowledge so why did it help Shepard and activate the bridges and tell him everything about the crucible even though it was prothean? In the extended cut it say in every ending that we won. 

Except in The shooting of the star child when it voice turns into a reapers and says so be it and then the ending show dr liara t-soni saying we lost just like the protheans. So the reapers help you with bridges and when you shoot them they don't help you, but why would they help you in the first place to destroy themselves.

Knowing this ME Andromeda is coming out and this is evidence that we won, but what if you chose the shoot the star child ending.

Now if you do everything right you can choose the destroy perfect ending where everyone even shepard lives but synthetics die. This is the only ending that makes sense. 

So to clarify in bulletpoints
• Why did the prothean make three firing options for the crucible
•How did they know that synthesis was the final stage of evolution
•Why did the star child help shepard (starchild is collective of reaper knowlwdge/reaper a.i) so why did reapers help you to destroy themselves
•If you shoot the starchild it doesn't help you everyone dies so how does andromeda take place.

Was this all an elaborate setup by the reapers to find a organic species that was better than them to take the reapers place to rule the universe thus they were actually the creators of the crucible that why they were 3 options for you to take all good decisions in order to stop the conflict between man and machine. were the reapers just waiting for a species that were smart enough and resilient enough to create the crucible and defeat them. In ME2 harbinger was talking about how humans are so perfect as a species that why it was wanting to create a human reaper. But failed at that to a human. I mean its almost like the reapers knew humans were going to be the ones to become what they already are. the crucible just so happend to be on mars and humans learned FTL from mars it all really coincidental, so what I am looking for is a bit more of a sturdy answer.

I thought of a fucking brilliant idea for school a few weeks ago I thought for some money I would come into the school dressed as a lass all Kawaii and stuff and everyone was like yeah do it. I go to a six form (Americans it's like collage but a higher standard of work and education... sometimes) so skip forward about two weeks everyone is raging at me like ""why have you no done it yet"". I bought the clothes from a site called ASOS anyway I show the guys the clothes I have got they were like OMG he is actually gonna do it. Plus I had already been guaranteed to get paid for doing this, so win, win. School photo day was ever dawning upon us so I though ""guys I will do it on school photo day"" anyway that never happened. It also turned out that one of my friends who is a woman had pretty much the same outfit as me and really wanted to see me do this. I thought can let her down. On Friday 4th December 2015... yesterday coming to the end of the day we were having a mess about with my mate called errm... lets say Fredrik for privacy reason obviously. Anyway we were giving a lot of banter to him. After the day I felt bad so I thought seeing as though I let him down coming not coming to school dressed like the Kawaii lass I promised I dressed up and told him I will send him a picture...

Get ready guys here is the shit storm
I in confidence said here I was an arse earlier you can see this and get me back INSTEAD OF USING SNAPCHAT I USED FB MESSENGER... you can now see where this is going. He promised me he wouldn't send it anyone, that was a fucking lie anyways not an hour later this picture or well two pictures managed to reach my little brother. I know right internet is brutal but I didn't really give a flying monkey toss. anyway my Dad got angry, My Mum got scared ya know because life is ruined shit.

But here is the creamy butter to the bread everyone who got it already knew it was a joke and Fredrik the person who sent it got everyone to stop before it reached anywhere out of school I avoided the shit storm before anything got way too serious and I guess I have Fredrik to thank and also blame for that but this was my fault all round. No one even sent me messages and I also went out that night and people I knew hadn't even seen it. So I guess I didn't get internet famous too bad. 

But in all seriousness this has happened to people and they have lost their lives to it I was very lucky... The worst part is the girl who wanted to see me dressed up didn't even see it.

TL;DR Sent picture of me as women to friend, thus friend shared pictures. It all stopped before and shit hit the fan.
