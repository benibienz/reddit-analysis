Freejam has already decreased the score for destroying the crystals but due to being a fast phased robot, i can continue capturing towers until i overlaps everyone else's scores.

208,"**For those who haven't read the Novel yet, here is the alternative story from the novel itself.**

[Spoiler from the Novel](/s ""Haruhiro was left behind instead of Ranta, Deathspot(the monster) ignored Haruhiro to go for the rest of the group but Haruhiro decided to go after Deathspot and he suddenly saw the light, he followed the light and killed Deathspot using backstab."")
The story is completely different from the anime because there was no scaffolding mentioned, and since the anime is ending in the next episode we can assume that Ranta is going to die and the rest of the group will become stronger and continue their journey. 
**I think that the next episode is going to be a sad ending.**",2016-03-20 21:44:53+00:00,d1750fy,1.0,t3_4b867d,18847.0,anime
