I recently attempted to play Tesla on TDM because they seem to be very viable in this gamemode, however a few minutes ago i just encountered 6-7 tesla bots in TDM and all we did was chase each other around the map. It ended up being one sided for our team because we had faster tesla bots and me having cloak module.

To be honest it was fun BUT it is just a matter of time before everyone starts taking out only their tesla bots in TDM, and i find it such a waste of opportunity for such a good gamemode if everyone choses to abuse teslas this way.

During a combat in Battle Arena, i got killed by an enemy. When i respawned i noticed that i was glowing. My movement was stripped by an enemy which caused me to drop (i was a tesseract) but rather than dropping to the ground, i fell through the map instead. At this moment, i minimized my window so i could turn on my screen capture. When i maximized robocraft, i seem to have drifted to the enemy base and my health has fully regenerated.

To be honest, i tried to shoot at their reactor out of curiousity but after finding out that the plasma volley was useless, i gave up and decided to try and fly back to the surface.
