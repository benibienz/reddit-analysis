50,Many will say don't play this and that. But it really depends on yourself. If you like to max out dmg you would need to do lots of theory crafting. If you just want to play the game -&gt; decide on your classes before you start. Www.tosbase.com has a calculator for that. Because otherwise you will need to restart a char if you picked the wrong classes. There is no class reset. Only skill and Stat reset. So choose wisely. But I think everything is viable.

51,"Let's be real there are many things which are fine and many many problems.

Pro:

* many different classes
* nice skills
* many items will take days to get
* premium can be bought from other players
* it's more a journey than just rushing to max lvl

Con:

* damn laggy, one person can make the whole server drop their fps just by extremely spamming the shout system
* not optimized 10 people in your range are a huge problem for most PCs 
* you can level up to 225 without grinding ever, after that the game isn't finished and you need to grind the last 55 lvl's .. for me that's no fun
* pvp is still in beta and not balanced
* dungeon limit is 2 ( 3 for premium )
* trading and the market is just a mess
* only the 6 best get loot on world bosses
* not enough mobs on most maps for grinding
* you don't get exp from mobs which are much lower than yourself

Even on all these cons I would recommend it for everyone who loved RO anyone else is just better of waiting for optimization and all that shit. Also as you can see most of the cons can be fixed and would make the game just awesome.
