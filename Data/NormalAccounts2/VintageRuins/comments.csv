Most chess rating systems employ rating floors. We could do the same thing but only make the floor affect the next 2.5 month period. And in a way unique to overwatch. 

For instance all players could start at 1400: a pretty average rating. The next 10-15 games could be considered ""provisional"" and thus affect that rating much more significantly than the games following ""provisional"" status. And if by the end of the season you had reached a rating of 1850, your new rating floor for the next season would be 1800. In other words, you'd start there and the cycle could repeat.

It's an hour drive, every single morning some idiot has had a wreck as well. Hillbillies in beat up trucks consistently drive aggressively. I've been tailed by some for literally no reason before when I drove home late at night.

 There are very few entertaining bars. The ""tourist"" area is basically one strip that's about 2-3 blocks long. There's a LOT of crime here too. I've had a friend be mugged twice in two different areas of the fucking hellhole. The nightlife is lackluster. Everything feels 5-10 years behind as far as culture.

You're an actual role model, whose opinion people respect: who's now afraid to completely sever ties with someone who in the past few months only been making headlines due to cyber bullying and witch-hunting. He's making his career via all the ideals/practices you condemn, but when those practices have the face of someone you're ""okay"" with... you only take a lukewarm stance. 

Take the viral video that the girl posted about ""Dear Fat People"" for instance. You instantly said you viewed her as a friend up until she uploaded that video. You publicly addressed the issue, called her out, and made it CLEAR where you stood. You used your ability to reach out to hundreds of thousands of people to do some good.

It was just a really dull repetition of 80s-style background thugs without any of the passion that made them stand out back then. 

It's a cool idea, with the whole ""single tracking shot"" for sure. But cuts could have easily made this much better: and few would have even noticed the cuts had you done fast whip-pans during the fight and cut during those pans. 

The gimmick of a single tracking shot didn't save some of the weaker kicks/punches and slower choreography that quick edits and better angles would've sold on a much more impactful level. It also doesn't really excuse the poor dialogue. 

The music during the fight really, really takes away from it as well. It's just campy, easily-licensed, artificial sounding filler. It really clashes with what's happening on screen, too.

The short should really have both. That would've set this video above and beyond the mediocrity I feel like it achieves at the moment. 

Take The Poacher or whatever for instance. Professional actors but terrible performances. I'm not blaming the actors as they didn't write the material and weren't the directors.

292,"I think Dromoka's may make a great 2-3 of in the side. It's definitely a strong card for handling the incoming flying-scissor overlords. 

I've started messing around with GW now based on the lists that were put up in the PT (after playing with two earlier versions that splashed black) and I really feel like this may be the most streamlined version that works at least somewhat well against aggro. Since a friend of mine has been playing UR thopters for a while now, I'm still trying to figure out the best way to actually completely counteract the deck though. 

Honestly what happens that allows me to win most often is just a nuts-hand (i.e. 1-2 Heralds, 1-2 Banishing Lights, etc.)  and him whiffing on Ensoul for turn two. A turn 2 ensoul on a darksteel/thopter is very, very difficult to counter if they just play the rest of the game leaving enough open to counter your banishing lights. It hits like a motherfucker and puts you on a very fast clock. 

A couple of Citadel Sieges have helped me significantly enough to where I'm considering playing 2-3 in my sideboard for the matchup. Being able to shut down the largest threat of their board has proved pretty damn effective so far. 

That, along with Dromoka's, Banishings, Silkwraps, should hopefully be enough to at least come closer to leveling the playing field. I've also considered making Elspeth a 2-of in the side, but I doubt she'll play well with the 4-of Kruphix's. Once she's in the GY that's that. The largest issue is that we don't have access to Languish or similar cards (that come to my mind at least) that help wipe boards. 

I'd consider Sylvan Caryatids as they both help to accelerate the curve and dodge the plethora of Seismic Waves UR players will side in to counter your Eidilons and Heralds too. Not to mention they're just another step in the anti-aggro direction. ",2015-08-04 04:26:27+00:00,ctqrigv,1,t3_3fpg88,2121,spikes
