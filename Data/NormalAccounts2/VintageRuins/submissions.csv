The owners of the agency I work at are finally realizing that they need to pay more respect to the creative process, as some clients have critiqued what has been done up to this point. I've started getting tasked with more important responsibilities in the agency overall, and am now being seen as one-of, if not the, creative head of the agency. While this is awesome, it's also a daunting new experience. 

I was recently asked by an owner of the agency to help develop a template for creative meetings that provided members of the meeting with the goals/information about the brand we were discussing. The brief would be handed out, hopefully a day or two before the meeting, to give ample time to prepare. 

Here's a few questions/facts we're considering putting onto the brief at the moment:

* Size/Scale of what we're attempting to solve/discuss today (As in ""Big picture"", ""rebranding"", or small tier things such as ""commercial spots"", ""online campaigns"", or a mix).
* Budget available. To help understand and put a limit on the scope of ideas.
* Existing Brand identity/summary. To help better understand the client. 

**Some questions I have for you guys:**

* Is this similar to how you've handled creative meetings in your own agency? If not, what else would you suggest to get ready for a creative meeting that would involve ideas for campaigns and brand identities?

* What are some questions/facts you would expect to see on such a document to help you have more information before you went into a meeting? 

* If you were in charge of such a meeting, and had to fill out a questionnaire like the one I'm (*poorly*) attempting to create, what questions/facts would you expect/want to be on it in order to prepare creatives?

The deck regularly 2-1's and I think performs well enough, but is extremely straightforward, narrow-mindedly aggressive, and scoops to virtually any board clears. The sheer burst-power of the deck oftentimes makes up for these shortcomings, especially in an aggro-centric meta (which is where we pilot it) but I'm hoping it's not the best version we have at our disposal.

Most recently, [This](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=88776) list showed up as a 4th place finisher in a regionals tournament. While I'm personally unsure of the Thornbow Archer's viability compared to the replaced Leaf Gilder, I'm still respecting the high-placement it achieved and some of the other additions, such as Nissa. Does anyone have any thoughts on whether Leaf Gilder deserves a spot in the deck or is he too slow and vulnerable?

So far, I've been trying to find a good balance between the two decks. I realize that Elves isn't top tier yet (hoping BFZ changes that) but the deck can still surprise people with the explosive Shaman bursts. Which leads me to having this list so far of my own:

Sadly, I don't own Thoughtseize or that would replace the Duress in the SB. I believe that's probably the 4-of that is almost always sided in to counteract the opponent siding in board clears, too. 

I'm considering 2 Obelisk of Urd in the mainboard. It seems like the best solution to board wipes. Being able to possibly convoke for turn 3 (which I believe would happen regularly enough), makes me think it may be worth missing out on attacking the opponent for one turn in order to get +2/+2 elves that avoid upcoming UR Thopter's Seismic Ruptures. 

One of my big questions for the community would be thoughts on 2-3 mainboarded Foul Tongue Shrieks for surprise finishing damage. Often times a Shaman of the Pack will land and hit the opponent for massive amounts of damage, but still lack the final punch to finish them off. I haven't seen this card being used in any Elf decks I've found so far, and I'm wondering if it could potentially help push the burst-like nature of Elves a bit further. What are your thoughts on possibly siding out 2 Chord of Callings in order to mainboard 2 Foul Tongue Shrieks or Obelisk of Urds? 

If anyone can think of any other changes to the overall deck, feel free to suggest some, and offer up any discussions of what can potentially at least make this archetype rise to the top of tier 2 or the bottom of tier 1 in Standard.
