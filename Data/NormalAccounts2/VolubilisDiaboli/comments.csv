5,"I would definitely play hcuim, mostly because I believe abusing death mechanics on an ult is ridiculous, but also because it would feel closer to what the game used to be like (I mean losing all your shit on death)",2016-10-19 20:59:01+00:00,d8zb67h,1,t3_58acdk,25902,W385
6,"They must have lol, I think they should just remove it and not even poll it because otherwise most of the playerbase have adapted to having virtually no risk in most pvm situations, and they don't want to have the game become harder. Also, too many people these days have been abusing it as a ""clever use of game mechanics"" specifically on UIM to not risk any items in wilderness or other dangerous areas.",2016-10-15 20:06:34+00:00,d8tfjo3,3,t1_d8tf7wc,462,2007scape

This was right before NZ said he got killed, the guy (noscopeafk) was coming in and out of the CC for a few hours. He wasn't in the CC list anymore at this point (I just had it open by chance in the screenshot) because as soon as NZ called him out he left.

Also, I didn't screenshot it but NoscopeAFK was whispering me after and saying ""he wasn't in the clan chat at the time I killed him so good luck proving it""",2016-08-27 18:11:38+00:00,d6z15tl,1,t3_4ztir7,32053,W385
