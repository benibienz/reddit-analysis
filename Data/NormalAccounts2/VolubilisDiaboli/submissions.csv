So what if I want to do the event, and I kill my uim to get the 1 hour timer, but then my internet goes out for 2 hours and I can't log back in to get my shit, fuck me right? I have 0 deaths on my ult and I would very much like to keep it that way, I'm not too keen on having to die to do an event.

I know nobody is forcing me to do the event, and I CAN just wait until next year, but was the intention with this event to make it undoable for people who don't want to abuse a game mechanic?",2007scape,H'ween 2016 event hates uim,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/58jmqj/hween_2016_event_hates_uim/
