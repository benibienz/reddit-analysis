Another way to get the news out.  

&gt;1) Create a PROFESSIONAL press release (or pay $5 for someone to do it for you)

&gt;2) Submit the release to prbuzz or any other distribution network.

&gt;3) Hundreds of legacy news sites will automatically post the press releases.

&gt;4) Reporters often check press releases for interesting news, if your release is good they might write a story about it.

&gt;Easiest way to get this all done is to go on Fiverr.com and pay $5 for someone in India to write and distribute the press release for you.

&gt;Investigators were targeting apartment complexes where women hoping to have ""anchor babies"" were living. Children born in the United States automatically become U.S. citizens, and once they are 21 years old these ""anchors"" can help relatives move to the country.  

&gt;Documents on property ownership and income are sometimes necessary to get U.S. tourist visas. *Yu said 90 percent of his clients lied to immigration authorities to get their visas.*

&gt;Ma said pregnant women paid from 100,000 to 500,000 yuan to have their babies in the United States. Most bills came to about 200,000 yuan, or US$ 32,400, which covered a two-month stay before delivery and another month afterward.

&gt;A business with five to six rooms can make a profit of about 50,000 yuan a month and margins for larger ones are even greater, Ma said.

&gt;*Nearly 40,000 women headed to the United States to have their baby in 2014*, said a website called A-amsm.com that provides ratings of the services offered by the ""anchor baby"" businesses. The number in 2004 was around 850.

&gt;A Chinese woman who had a baby in Los Angles said *women usually enter the United States via Honolulu or Las Vegas* because immigration screening there is less strict than in California.

One of the comments worth reading.

 

&gt;You should hyperlink to the Wright piece you reference in the NYT.
Wright is saying concentration and competition are distinct concepts, and an increase in concentration does not necessarily lead to an increase in prices. Both of these statements are verifiably true. Furthermore, the implication that Wright fails to understand the Fed, CEA, and academics is wholly unfounded and must be based on a misreading of all four parties.  

&gt;Wright is well-respected by economists for understanding economists, and I actually first met Wright when he was the keynote speaker at a reception for the Nobel recipients for 2012 — funny how somebody can be asked to speak about a Nobel in economics, with the recipients in the audience, yet Dayen can just dismiss him as flying “in the face…of common sense….” and all the right people (the same people Dayen will shit on next column for being so much dumber than he is).


&gt;The conflicts of interest are there and legitimate concerns. But the article focuses on making Wright look stupid, and it, uh, backfires.
Cave, lector.

&gt;A University of Louisiana at Lafayette student faces a criminal mischief charge for allegedly fabricating a story about being attacked near campus Wednesday by two men who yelled ethnic slurs and then stole her wallet and hijab head covering.

&gt;Khadija Altamimi, 18, was issued a misdemeanor summons for a violation of the city's criminal mischief law, which carries a penalty of up to $500 and 30 days in jail, according to Lafayette Police records released Friday.

&gt;She was not booked on the charge, and no court date had been set.

&gt;Altamimi could not be reached for comment on Friday.

&gt;News of the attack went viral after the **University of Louisiana at Lafayette sent out an e-mail to students Wednesday evening with a description of the suspects that stated one was wearing a white ""Trump"" hat.
Lafayette Police announced Thursday that the student had made up the story,** though no explanation was offered why she did.

&gt;The student's claim of being attacked was reported online Thursday morning by almost every major news organization in Louisiana and several national news outlets.

&gt;""Obvious sensational titles are one giveaway,"" he said.

Like Pedo's, spirit dinners and satanic worship? 

&gt;""Also look at the quality of the hosting organisation, and also if this is something that many different credible news sources have commented on.  


So if the MSM didn't report on Wikileaks releasing Podesta's emails the emails aren't credible? 


&gt;""Also there are sites such as snopes.com which have a database of known/debunked fake stories that is regularly updated.

Snopes?! That's rich. 


&gt;""Essentially, be critical when you read online content.""

337,"&gt;harasses you based on your religion.  

No doubt it's been here since the first religion and it's never going away. Nobody should be harassed for their religion. Many moved here because they couldn't stand the harassment they had in their home country.  


&gt;Say you are a muslim woman. You grew up during 9/11. After that event, you were subject to islamophobia.  

The us gov orchestrated it. Your beef is with the George Bush Gov that made it happen. They screwed all of us.

&gt;All of a sudden there is a presidential candidate whose rhetoric,  

Have you any understanding of how long the border has been an issue? Do you understand why it hasn't been fixed? Without DJT's use of rhetoric we would still be on the course to abuse illegal immigrants. You're aware some are forced to use diapers because bathroom breaks get you fired? Have you any compassion for people that are abused and have no recourse or restitution? Does this fit in with your worldview at all?  
  
His rhetoric on immigration was needed to jolt the American public to the dangers we face from terrorists entering our country. Of course Jeb or Hillary would have carried on campaigns to kill brown people but that's of no real concern as long as harassment of your religion is safe in failing broke assed America.  



&gt;potential for hate  

Unavoidable. 

&gt;All I asked was for some acknowledgement of this particular REAL issue facing americans,  

Unavoidable but the problem isn't Donald John Trump. The problem is the policies and terrible deeds that got us where we are. In a perfect world we wouldn't have attacked the middle east and bankrupt our country for the corps and elite. In a perfect world our neighbors to the south wouldn't have come to depend on it's citizens getting abused by multinational corps to send social security home. We wouldn't be competing for jobs with illegals and we wouldn't perceive Muslims as having attacking us. I've tried for many years to get the truth out and now 50% of Americans believe the government made 9/11 happen. If we got to 100% nobody blames Muslims for 9/11. ISIS is a whole other issue that we also created. Why live in a country that would do such things that bring scorn on those who don't deserve it??

It's very possible that Silsby is a dimwit and got set up to be a middle man of shuffling children. She invited a group of people to come with that has no idea they were doing anything illegal. One guy thought he could help Haiti with his construction skills.

What we need to figure out is how she met up with Puello and who he really is, he had 25+ identities. His wife is in jail for some pretty sketchy stuff.

Something else weird happened with Buchanan before she ran for office, she literally prepares for a plane of children to leave and after she completed the paperwork somebody else essentially swooped in and flew off with them.

There is somebody higher up manipulating people to get these children together and prepare them for an orphanage, and then they cut in and take them.

Where do they go? Could be for organ harvesting/trafficking, child prostitution, slave labor etc...

They prey on children during natural disasters such as earthquakes. They could be doing it through Clinton Foundation or CHAI.

&gt;In March, after her arrest, evidence was introduced in Silsby’s case showing
that on January 26, 2010, she had previously attempted to take a different
group of 40 children across the border. Haitian and Dominican
authorities turned her away for lack of authorizing documents. Three days
later she attempted to cross over with the second group—the 33 children—
again without proper documentation.  
 
&gt;Suspicions about Silsby’s intent to smuggle or traffic the children to the
Dominican Republic further increased, when on March 19, 2010, **Silsby’s
legal advisor—Jorge Torres-Puello, an American-Dominican living in the
Dominican Republic as a fugitive—was arrested and accused of human trafficking.**  

&gt;**U.S. authorities revealed that Torres-Puello was “linked to a network
that trafficked in Haitian and Central American children and [was]
wanted in the United States, El Salvador and Costa Rica.” His wife was already imprisoned in El Salvador and “faced charges of presumed sexual
exploitation of minors and women.”**


&gt;In the end, her sentence was based on the least polemic charge against her. **The pressing issue— whether Silsby intended to deliver the children into trafficking rings
or grey adoption markets—was not addressed or resolved.**

***  

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the case ""unfortunate."" ""The Haitian nation acted to protect children who were being removed from their country without appropriate documentation,"" she said. ""It was unfortunate that, **whatever the motivation,** this group of Americans took matters into their own hands.""

Trump would ask Bernie about Venezuela and Bernie would hope a bird landed on his podium. No contest.

&gt;*Thursday 26 October 1995*  


&gt;Washington (Reuter) - Someone forged the torn-up suicide note that was discovered after White House lawyer Vincent Foster was found with a fatal gunshot wound, a group of handwriting experts said yesterday.
Three handwriting specialists presented analysis at a news conference of the note found in Foster's briefcase after the deputy White House counsel was found dead on 20 July 1993 in a park near Washington. They said it appeared the note was not written by Foster but was a forgery...

http://fortune.com/2015/05/27/karen-finney-hillary-clinton/  

Race issues strike a personal chord with Karen Finney. Her African-American father’s last name, Finney, comes from the man who once owned the family as slaves. Yet her mother, Mildred Lee, is the great, great, great niece of Robert E. Lee—or “the General,” as he is referred to within the family.

“That is my American story, a mixed race heritage that I am proud of, just as Virginia, the South and our country has a mixed history,” she wrote in a 2010 Huffington Post column decrying Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s decision to celebrate a Confederate History Month without mentioning slavery.

Finney is the daughter of a civil-rights-lawyer father and a labor-negotiator mother. She moved with her mother from New York to Berkeley at age 7, attended UCLA, and worked as a teaching assistant in a minimum-security facility for pregnant teenagers in Los Angeles. That experience kindled a passion for public education and eventually launched her into a career in liberal politics.

She’s been in the Clinton orbit since the early 1990s, when she was drawn to presumptive Democratic nominee Bill Clinton after his visit to riot-torn Los Angeles in 1992. Clinton, she recalls, “didn’t demonize these young people.” In the 1990s, Finney joined the Clinton White House as the First Lady’s deputy press secretary and later as a traveling press secretary on her 2000 Senate campaign.

In the late ’90s and again from 2002 to 2004, Finney made a foray into the private sector, overseeing growth and branding of the children’s academic book company Scholastic Inc. In the months after 9/11 she managed crisis communications for the New York City Board of Education. She also worked for Elizabeth Edwards during the 2004 Kerry/Edwards presidential campaign.

She became a familiar face on TV as communications director for the Democratic National Committee, where she helped then-DNC Chair Howard Dean develop a “50 state strategy’’ to shore up the party’s ground machinery beyond the usual dozen or so contested states in presidential elections.

In 2013, Finney’s practiced punditry paid off with her own MSNBC weekend show, called “Disrupt.” Her show was cancelled after one year but the training has proven valuable to her current hot-seat of a job, where she has had to defend the former Secretary of State’s use of a personal email server and explain the Clinton Foundation’s foreign money trail. She also serves as deputy to Communications Director Jennifer Palimieri.

“Having my show was a huge help” in understanding how to deploy facts and research to make an argument, she says. Finney’s long association with MSNBC—she was a regular guest on CNN and Fox News as well as MSNBC before she got her own show—also means she’s no stranger to cable news’ ideological fencing. **Indeed, her first episode of “Disrupt” was dedicated to the GOP’s supposed “war on women,” and she later came under fire by conservatives when she called out the “crazy crackers on the right” who use “hateful language.”** 


What does Finney see as her central challenge for 2016? Creating an environment were voters can see the “real” Hillary Clinton, she says. “People think they know her,” Finney says of her candidate. “But she’s the most unknown well-known person in the world.”",2016-10-16 20:39:25+00:00,d8uroxv,2.0,t1_d8ur8nj,577.0,The_Donald

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Band    

&gt;Band has most recently been cited for abusing his working relationship with President Clinton to improperly influence Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by seeking access to the Secretary on behalf of contributors to the Clintons' foundation. In the Fall of 2013, Band was the Subject of a New York Post article entitled ""How Doug Band drove a wedge through the Clinton dynasty.""  
***   

http://nypost.com/2015/06/21/clinton-confidant-cuts-ties-with-the-formidable-family/


&gt;The New Republic noted the suspicious nature of Band’s work in a 2013 article.

“There’s an undertow of transactionalism in the glittering annual dinners, the fixation on celebrity and a certain contingent of donors whose charitable contributions and business interests occupy an uncomfortable proximity. More than anyone else except [Bill] Clinton himself, Band is responsible for creating this culture. And not only did he create it, he has thrived in it.”",2016-10-10 18:41:46+00:00,d8m7hom,1.0,t3_56t1bb,5887.0,The_Donald

&gt;More than 5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost between 1997 and 2014,  



&gt;Between 2001, when China came into the WTO, and 2013 the U.S. trade deficit with China increased $240 billion. These growing trade deficits eliminated 3.2 million U.S. jobs. China became the third largest recipient of FDI in the world, which fueled the growth of thousands of new manufacturing plants that generated exports to the United States and other markets.  

&gt;President Bill Clinton claimed that the agreement then being negotiated to allow China into the World Trade Organization (WTO) would create “a win-win result for both countries.”

https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform  

&gt;Defend The Laws And Constitution Of The United States

&gt;America will only be great as long as America remains a nation of laws that lives according to the Constitution. No one is above the law. The following steps will return to the American people the safety of their laws, which politicians have stolen from them:

&gt;**Triple the number of ICE officers.** As the President of the ICE Officers’ Council explained in Congressional testimony: “Only approximately 5,000 officers and agents within ICE perform the lion’s share of ICE’s immigration mission…Compare that to the Los Angeles Police Department at approximately 10,000 officers. Approximately 5,000 officers in ICE cover 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam, and are attempting to enforce immigration law against 11 million illegal aliens already in the interior of the United States. Since 9-11, the U.S. Border Patrol has tripled in size, while ICE’s immigration enforcement arm, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), has remained at relatively the same size.” This will be funded by accepting the recommendation of the Inspector General for Tax Administration and eliminating tax credit payments to illegal immigrants.

&gt;**Nationwide e-verify.** This simple measure will protect jobs for unemployed Americans.

&gt;**Mandatory return of all criminal aliens.** The Obama Administration has released 76,000 aliens from its custody with criminal convictions since 2013 alone. All criminal aliens must be returned to their home countries, a process which can be aided by canceling any visas to foreign countries which will not accept their own criminals, and making it a separate and additional crime to commit an offense while here illegally.

&gt;**Detention**—not catch-and-release. Illegal aliens apprehended crossing the border must be detained until they are sent home, no more catch-and-release.

&gt;**Defund sanctuary cities.** Cut-off federal grants to any city which refuses to cooperate with federal law enforcement.

&gt;**Enhanced penalties for overstaying a visa.** Millions of people come to the United States on temporary visas but refuse to leave, without consequence. This is a threat to national security. Individuals who refuse to leave at the time their visa expires should be subject to criminal penalties; this will also help give local jurisdictions the power to hold visa overstays until federal authorities arrive. Completion of a visa tracking system – required by law but blocked by lobbyists – will be necessary as well.

&gt;**Cooperate with local gang task forces.** ICE officers should accompany local police departments conducting raids of violent street gangs like MS-13 and the 18th street gang, which have terrorized the country. All illegal aliens in gangs should be apprehended and deported. Again, quoting Chris Crane: “ICE Officers and Agents are forced to apply the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Directive, not to children in schools, but to adult inmates in jails. If an illegal-alien inmate simply claims eligibility, ICE is forced to release the alien back into the community. This includes serious criminals who have committed felonies, who have assaulted officers, and who prey on children…ICE officers should be required to place detainers on every illegal alien they encounter in jails and prisons, since these aliens not only violated immigration laws, but then went on to engage in activities that led to their arrest by police; ICE officers should be required to issue Notices to Appear to all illegal aliens with criminal convictions, DUI convictions, or a gang affiliation; ICE should be working with any state or local drug or gang task force that asks for such assistance.”

&gt;**End birthright citizenship.** This remains the biggest magnet for illegal immigration. By a 2:1 margin, voters say it’s the wrong policy, including Harry Reid who said “no sane country” would give automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.

&gt;**Put American Workers First**

&gt;Decades of disastrous trade deals and immigration policies have destroyed our middle class. Today, nearly 40% of black teenagers are unemployed. Nearly 30% of Hispanic teenagers are unemployed. For black Americans without high school diplomas, the bottom has fallen out: more than 70% were employed in 1960, compared to less than 40% in 2000. Across the economy, the percentage of adults in the labor force has collapsed to a level not experienced in generations. As CBS news wrote in a piece entitled “America’s incredible shrinking middle class”: “If the middle-class is the economic backbone of America, then the country is developing osteoporosis.”

&gt;The influx of foreign workers holds down salaries, keeps unemployment high, and makes it difficult for poor and working class Americans – including immigrants themselves and their children – to earn a middle class wage. Nearly half of all immigrants and their US-born children currently live in or near poverty, including more than 60 percent of Hispanic immigrants. Every year, we voluntarily admit another 2 million new immigrants, guest workers, refugees, and dependents, growing our existing all-time historic record population of 42 million immigrants. We need to control the admission of new low-earning workers in order to: help wages grow, get teenagers back to work, aid minorities’ rise into the middle class, help schools and communities falling behind, and to ensure our immigrant members of the national family become part of the American dream.

&gt;Additionally, we need to stop giving legal immigrant visas to people bent on causing us harm. From the 9/11 hijackers, to the Boston Bombers, and many others, our immigration system is being used to attack us. The President of the immigration caseworkers union declared in a statement on ISIS: “We've become the visa clearinghouse for the world.”

&gt;Here are some additional specific policy proposals for long-term reform:

&gt;**Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs.** We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program's lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.

&gt;**Requirement to hire American workers first.** Too many visas, like the H-1B, have no such requirement. In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and incomes collapsing, we need companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS.

&gt;**End welfare abuse.** Applicants for entry to the United States should be required to certify that they can pay for their own housing, healthcare and other needs before coming to the U.S.

&gt;**Jobs program for inner city youth.** The J-1 visa jobs program for foreign youth will be terminated and replaced with a resume bank for inner city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program.

&gt;**Refugee program for American children.** Increase standards for the admission of refugees and asylum-seekers to crack down on abuses. Use the monies saved on expensive refugee programs to help place American children without parents in safer homes and communities, and to improve community safety in high crime neighborhoods in the United States.

&gt;**Immigration moderation.** Before any new green cards are issued to foreign workers abroad, there will be a pause where employers will have to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed immigrant and native workers. This will help reverse women's plummeting workplace participation rate, grow wages, and allow record immigration levels to subside to more moderate historical averages.

In various media interviews, Broaddrick stated that Clinton raped her and that Hillary Clinton knew about it, and tried to threaten Broaddrick into remaining silent. She started giving some interviews in 2015 because Hillary Clinton's statement that victims of sexual assault should be believed angered her.[6]

Broaddrick's allegations resurfaced in the 2016 presidential campaign. In various media interviews, Broaddrick stated that Clinton raped her and that Hillary Clinton knew about it, and tried to threaten Broaddrick into remaining silent. She started giving some interviews in 2015 because Hillary Clinton's statement that victims of sexual assault should be believed angered her.[6]

&gt;At the time of Trump’s ad people were under the impression that this was a brutal and barbaric attack done by a group of degenerates, and when they learned she lost 80% of her blood and almost lost an eye most people were horrified.  


&gt;**“Trisha Meili was comatose for 12 days. She suffered from severe hypothermia, severe brain damage, Class 4 (the most severe) hemorrhagic shock, and loss of 75–80 per cent of her blood from five deep stab wounds and a gash on one of her thighs, and internal bleeding. Her skull had been fractured so badly that her left eye was removed from the eye socket, which in turn was fractured in 21 places, and she suffered as well from facial fractures. The initial medical prognosis was that Meili would die. She was given last rites. The police initially listed the attack as a probable homicide. At best, doctors thought that she would remain in a permanent coma due to her injuries. She came out of her coma 12 days after her attack, and spent seven weeks in Metropolitan Hospital in East Harlem. When she emerged from her coma, she was initially unable to talk, read, or walk.“**  

***  

&gt;and who refused black tenants.  

Honestly, If you see the words “welfare recipient” and instantly think of black people, doesn’t that make you the racist?


&gt;Trump argued in court that forcing him to rent to welfare recipients **(and due to the racial coding in everyone’s brains at this point, most of you will attribute that to black people even though statistics show otherwise)** was wrong considering his operation was mostly moderate and luxury apartments, note the absence of any racial indications or coding. The situation was basically Trump not wanting to rent to welfare recipients, and I’m sure most people would have reservations about renting luxury housing to welfare recipients, it doesn’t make them racist.

&gt;A Rasmussen survey in 2014 found that just [4 percent](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/november_2014/just_4_say_candidates_keep_their_campaign_promises) of likely voters that year believed that “most politicians” kept the promises they made on the campaign trail, while 83 percent did not. (The remaining 13 percent were undecided.)

The good news is you can raise your bar quite a bit.   


Graphic: [The history of U.S presidents keeping their promises](https://i.sli.mg/LvTU79.png)  


&gt;George W. Bush promised [tax cuts](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/26/us/the-2000-campaign-the-tax-plan-bush-tax-plan-the-debate-takes-shape.html) and [education reform](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/30/us/2000-campaign-education-policies-bush-gore-stake-claims-federal-role-education.html), and within the first year of his administration had [delivered](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/19/us/dressed-as-tooth-fairy-irs-will-drop-a-note-to-millions.html) on [both](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/us/focusing-on-home-front-bush-signs-education-bill.html). Barack Obama promised to focus on the [economy](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/us/politics/01text-obama.html), [health care](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/us/politics/22check.html) and the [environment](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/us/politics/19climate.html). Once in office, he pushed first a [massive stimulus package](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/obama-signs-stimulus-bill/) and then the [Affordable Care Act](http://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/1247467431610/obama-signs-health-bill.html) through Congress, and he has worked with [China](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/us-china-joint-presidential-statement-climate-change) and others in the international community on climate change, despite strong legislative opposition. As for the promises that get abandoned, many have more to do with changing circumstances than a lack of principles.   


&gt;Political scientists have been studying the question of campaign promises for almost 50 years, and the results are remarkably consistent. Most of the literature suggests that presidents make at least a “good faith” effort to keep an average of about two-thirds of their campaign promises; the exact numbers differ from study to study, depending on how the authors define what counts as a campaign promise and what it means to keep it.

&gt;In August 2012 the Secretary of State at the time was one Hillary Rodham Clinton. The President was and still is one Barack Hussein Obama.

&gt;The DIA report said, in essence, that if we (the U.S. and our local cronies) keep aiding al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and other such sterling democrats, something really nasty would arise in eastern Syria.

[""Hard-Working . . . White Americans""](http://mije.org/richardprince/hard-working-white-americans)  


*Thursday, May 8, 2008*  

Mainstream Media Downplay Hillary Clinton Comment  


**A day after many observers declared it nearly impossible for Sen. Hillary Clinton to overtake Sen. Barack Obama** to win the Democratic presidential nomination, Clinton told USA Today, ""I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on."" As evidence, the story said, Clinton cited an Associated Press article ""that found how Sen. Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me.  


""There's a pattern emerging here,"" Clinton said.  


To many, it was a shocking statement — equating ""hard-working Americans"" with ""white Americans"" and a naked attempt to cast herself as ""the white candidate"" in the race.  


...  

The Windsor Star in Windsor, Ontario, headlined its story, ""Obama nears finish line; Desperate Clinton plays race card.""  



On Salon.com, Joe Conason asked ""Was Hillary channeling George Wallace? Hillary's reckless exploitation of racial division could split the Democratic Party over race — a tragic legacy for the Clintons.""  


""Racists should decide the Democratic nomination,"" Issac J. Bailey wrote Friday in the Myrtle Beach (S.C.) Sun News. ""Sen. Hillary Clinton didn't use those words in an interview with USA Today, but she came close.""

2194,"&gt;Good thing straight up calling Mexicans rapists doesn't count as being racist.  

There you go again. Rinse and repeat the lies until you forget you're lying. Sad.  





&gt; Trump calls Mexican Immigrants “rapists and criminals”  

&gt;It’s amazing to me how many people believe this and yet can’t tell me the full paragraph he said this statement in or where they even heard it…. because most haven’t.  


&gt;People these days go along with headlines and skim articles (if they even get that far) and take things to be instant truths. They don’t approach anything with a healthy air of skepticism and are gullible enough to believe anything that sounds remotely good to them.  


&gt;They don’t want to dig beyond the surface of anything because they’re satisfied with the mirage on the surface of the water. That’s why this is such an infamous quote, and with people’s lack of analytical skills they don’t truly comprehend what was said.  


&gt;I watched the video along with reading the transcript, and many people took what Trump was saying out of context. First of all, he never meant that all Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals – not even all of the illegals. The first thing he said before he made the “offensive” comments was:

    &gt;“These are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you.” *pointing at people in the crowd*

&gt;So everyone completely ignored the fact that he started off saying that Mexico has good people (their best) and he’s differentiating them from the ones he’s referring to, and decided to take his words out of context (because anyone with critical thinking ability could put 2 + 2 together and realize he was talking about illegal immigrants).  


&gt;The next part is what everyone in the Anti-Trump crowd has taken offense to without really understanding what was said:  


&gt;“They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

&gt;**and let’s break this down to make it easy to understand.**  


&gt;1). **Yes, he was talking about illegal immigrants and not all Mexican immigrants.** While it may have been offensive and I admit he should have been more careful/clear with his choice of words, the sentiment he’s expressing isn’t new in terms of our nation’s worries. In fact some of the same outlets that are now slandering him have addressed the issue before, but they were more clear with their words as to not have them misconstrued.  


&gt;2). Trump said in a later interview that he got this information from a Fusion article (which he did misread and misinterpret) stating that many women who come to this country from Mexico tend to pay the price of either giving up their bodies willingly, or being raped. This is an issue that could have been handled better, but is it an issue of Trump thinking less of Mexican immigrants? Not unless you wanted to take offense to something that wasn’t there. Even after he clarified his statement, people still can’t bring themselves to comprehend this correctly.  


&gt;3). **Even after finishing with “Some, I assume, are good people” people still found it necessary to overlook that and instantly scream that Trump called all Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. Sometimes I wonder do people look at information to truly comprehend it, or just to satisfy their own preconceived notions.**

&gt;He also added that Curiel may have been biased against him because of his ethnicity due to Trump’s plan to build a wall, which i agree is a statement he could have gone without saying. However, according to CBSNews Trump was attempting to have Curiel recused from the case in October 2014 because of “animosity towards Mr. Trump and his views,” and with the media falsely branding him as the most racist, sexist xenophobe to walk the planet for the entire election it does make you wonder.

Juanita on Bill Clinton: [""When everything was over with, he got up and straightened himself, and I was crying at the moment and he walks to the door, and calmly puts on his sunglasses.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanita_Broaddrick#Allegations_against_Bill_Clinton)   And before he goes out the door he says ‘You better get some ice on that.’ And he turned and went out the door.”  

Broaddrick's allegations resurfaced in the 2016 presidential campaign. In various media interviews, Broaddrick stated that Clinton raped her and that Hillary Clinton knew about it, and tried to threaten Broaddrick into remaining silent. She started giving some interviews in 2015 because Hillary Clinton's statement that victims of sexual assault should be believed angered her.[6]

She started giving some interviews in 2015 because Hillary Clinton's statement that victims of sexual assault should be believed angered her.[6]

In various media interviews, Broaddrick stated that Clinton raped her and that Hillary Clinton knew about it, and tried to threaten Broaddrick into remaining silent. She started giving some interviews in 2015 because Hillary Clinton's statement that victims of sexual assault should be believed angered her.[6]

&gt;**NAFTA’s promoters also claimed that NAFTA would be a huge benefit to Mexico, stemming illegal immigration to the U.S., drug trafficking and other corruption, and other ills.** But even with Mexico’s $1 trillion NAFTA surplus with the U.S., Mexico still suffers a chronic global trade deficit as China and other countries use it as a back door to the U.S. Last year Mexico paid $60 billion for imports of mostly manufactured goods from China while earning only $6 billion from exports of mostly mineral and agricultural commodities to China. (Remember this the next time a bankers’ retainer claims U.S. trade data overstates deficits with China.)

***  

&gt;NAFTA caused massive employment-related demographic shifts, both within and between countries. **In Mexico, subsidized agricultural imports from the United States sparked unprecedented migration. The country lost 1 million jobs in corn alone between 1991 and 2000, and an additional million in the agricultural sector as a whole.** This drove waves of desperate migration from rural areas, both into the industrial sector in the north and across the border into the United States and Canada.

This is what Trump's platform is:

- [No more nation building](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-foreign-policy-doctrine-nation-building) in the Middle East. He was also calling the Iraq War a mistake way before it was cool to do so.

- [Lower and middle class tax cuts.](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform)

- Focus on American jobs.

- Doesn't want the government charging interest on student loans: [""That’s probably one of the only things the government shouldn’t make money off. I think it’s terrible that one of the only profit centers we have is student loans"".](http://www.studentdebtrelief.us/news/donald-trump-on-the-student-loan-crisis/) Open to student loan forgiveness programs.

- Wants to [audit the Federal Reserve.](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-24/donald-trump-right-here-are-100-reasons-why-we-need-audit-federal-reserve)

- [He's genuinely against TPP.](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/23/news/economy/trump-trade-deal/)

- Wants to allow states to legalize marijuana: [""Marijuana is such a big thing. I think medical should happen - right? Don't we agree? I think so. And then I really believe we should leave it up to the states.""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/29/trump-wants-marijuana-legalization-decided-at-the-state-level/)

- Doesn't have any special interests groups funding him unlike the other candidates. [Has called for all candidates to return the money they're getting back to Super PACs and to remove special interest groups from our election process.](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/donald-trump-return-super-pac-donations-215105)

- Likes [universal healthcare](http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/28/trump-60-minutes-interview-n2057986), is open to replacing America's broken system with something similar to Canada.

- Moderate on social issues (e.g. affirmative action, women's health, gay rights)

- Focus on broad-based American nationalism instead of narrow and divisive race and gender identity politics.

- Acknowledgement that political correctness is obnoxious.

- Desire to put America first in trade deals instead of pure Wall Street globalism that exploits third world workers abroad and destroys domestic jobs.

- Realist based foreign policy. (e.g. deal with Putin if it is in our national interest to do so, even if he isn't a nice guy).

- National pride. The man loves his country and thinks it is the best. Every country should have a leader like that.

- Diversity: [he employed women in leadership roles before it was popular to do that.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-a-champion-of-women-his-female-employees-think-so/2015/11/23/7eafac80-88da-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html) And he did it in the construction industry of all places.

- He has absolutely nothing against legal immigration, [he's encouraged it many times.](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/28/trump-in-favor-of-legal-immigration-only.html) His grandparents are immigrants, his wife is an immigrant, several of his closest business partners in New York are immigrants. He is against uncontrolled, illegal immigration.

- Hugely successful businessman, knows how to manage money, how to invest for the future and a fantastic negotiator.

- Unlike other candidates, his economic plan actually makes sense. [It would result in ""an 11 percent higher GDP, a 29 percent larger capital stock, 6.5 percent higher wages, and 5.3 million more full-time equivalent jobs"".](http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-s-tax-plan)

- Take a look at this video of him [back in 1991 talking about how to utilize the upper class to re-invest in America or face higher taxes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-HPlMHnORo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=86) Not only is he very knowledgable in economics and investment, but the tax structure he offers up back in 91' seems relevant even today to help alleviate some of the complaints we have about 1%'ers and wall street.

- Acknowledges the danger of allowing mass refugees from places governed by fundamentalist terrorist groups, even if such acknowledgment is not politically correct.

- He is a HIGH ENERGY individual who has literally created tens of thousands of jobs just with his own personal business, imagine what he could do by being a leader of America.

Open borders for illegal immigrants to serve multinational corps. It's time to stop the exploration, erosion of USA jobs and enforce existing laws.

Let's get serious and look at a model.  
  
 

&gt;Analysis of 300 polls across 40 markets from 1980 through current Our model proves the power of presidential approval ratings. It determines that in order for a successor candidate to have better than even chances of winning, the sitting president must have an approval rating of above 55 percent. Because Barack Obama’s average approval rating is now at 45 percent, a successor candidate (i.e. Democrat) is unlikely to win.

2008

&gt;Noah Feldman recently sketched out in the New York Times an inviting portrait of Shariah as the rule of law and a legitimate basis for order in an Islamic society. *Glaringly absent from his lengthy paean to Shariah, however, is any mention of how Islamic law institutionalizes discrimination against non-Muslims — which makes it anything but a stable foundation for a genuinely pluralistic republic.*  

 ***  
&gt;In a recent Friday sermon preached in Islam’s holiest city, Mecca, Sheikh Marzouq Salem Al-Ghamdi said this about Jews and Christians in Muslim lands:   


&gt;If the infidels live among the Muslims, in accordance with the conditions set out by the Prophet “” there is nothing wrong with it provided they pay Jizya to the Islamic treasury. Other conditions are…that they do not renovate a church or a monastery, do not rebuild ones that were destroyed, that they feed for three days any Muslim who passes by their homes…that they rise when a Muslim wishes to sit, that they do not imitate Muslims in dress and speech, nor ride horses, nor own swords, nor arm themselves with any kind of weapon; that they do not sell wine, do not show the cross, do not ring church bells, do not raise their voices during prayer, that they shave their hair in front so as to make them easily identifiable, do not incite anyone against the Muslims, and do not strike a Muslim …If they violate these conditions, they have no protection.

“I think the migration has been a horrible thing for Europe,” he said. “A lot of that was pushed by the EU.”

I have a lot of investments there. I would say that they're better off without it. But I want them to make their own decision.”
March 24th, ITV: Asked if now was the right time for Britain to quit the EU, Mr Trump said: 'Yes, my mother was born, as you know in Scotland, in Stornoway, and she loved Scotland.

QUESTION: In terms of the goal of this operation, is it to protect civilians or is it to remove Colonel Qadhafi from power?    


SECRETARY CLINTON: It is to protect civilians and it is to provide access for humanitarian assistance. If you read the very comprehensive resolution that the Security Council passed, it is focused on protecting civilians from their own government.    


***  

&gt;According to a Le Monde article dated May 13, 2014,[3] there were between 600,000 and 1,000,000 Libyan refugees in Tunisia, many of which were political opponents of the present forces in power in Libya, and many of which are supporters of the Jamahiriya of Muammar Gaddafi.

The entire annual increase in U.S. vehicle exports to Korea are dwarfed by less than one-month of the increase alone in Korea’s exports.

&gt;“The failures of the Korea FTA show why future trade deals need to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers; include strong rules of origin; develop enforceable labor and environmental standards; and stop our country’s focus on negotiating enhanced protections for corporations at the expense of workers’ rights.  And, these provisions need to be backed up by strong implementation and enforcement provisions to guarantee results,” Gerard declared.

2930,"&gt;I think it’s more of an issue...  
  

Not exactly.  



&gt;The attacks on Trump are, in my view as a Civil Rights lawyer for more than thirty years, utterly hypocritical. I base this on the undeniable fact that for decades ""White"" judges (and jurors and prosecutors and police) have been repeatedly attacked and their decisions criticized with express citations to the fact that they are ""White.""    



&gt;Why shouldn't this Hispanic judge be treated like a White judge? The fact is, all judges, including Hispanic and other non-White judges, are unelected, unaccountable, politically-connected political appointees, who are subject to criticism just as is any other governmental office holder.  


&gt;Judges are not a high-priesthood to which we citizens are required to genuflect, and never criticize or question. They are politicians by-any-other-name. It is just easier for these lawyers to get appointed to government office, i.e., judgeships, by appropriate political donations to the right party and the right political connections, then it is to get elected.  


&gt;If any citizen would criticize any politician in any elected office, or any bureaucrat in any appointed office, then that citizen should feel free to criticize any judge, no matter their race, and including questioning whether their decisions are influenced by their race. Otherwise, we citizens are but serfs or subjects quivering with fear under the tyranny of judicial mystic. After all, they are nothing but political appointees; lawyers in dresses. Never should a citizen quake before a man who goes to work in a dress.  


&gt;Although Donald Trump was not my first choice, I give Trump, as a public figure, newly minted political office seeker, and presumptive nominee for the Presidency, credit for having the courage to eschew political correctness and to publicly criticize this federal judge for perceived bias and failure to recuse himself from the Trump University litigation while being a member of a Hispanic racialist organization, the La Raza Lawyers Association.  


&gt;Why should Trump or any American fear to publicly question the impartiality of a judge who is a member of an organization which has in its very name a racial identification, ""La Raza,"" and is not shy in proclaiming ""Viva La Raza!"" (Long Live The Race!)""? If he was White and a member of the KKK Lawyers Association, would the politicians, media mavens, and the politically-correct thought police rush to condemn Trump for questioning whether the Judge's race influenced his decisions?  


&gt;I was one of the attorneys for Cesar Chavez in California for some twenty years. He was proud of his Mexican heritage, but never once did I ever hear him identify himself as ""Raza,"" or join in crying ""Viva La Raza!"" On the contrary, Cesar Chavez, a great, third-generation American of Mexican descent, a WWII veteran who joined the Navy at 17 and served for the duration in defense of his country, the United States, and was the moral heart of the American labor movement, expressly told me he wouldn't use the term ""La Raza"" because he considered it ""racist.""  


&gt;Why, then, this rush of politicians and media to defend this Hispanic judge from criticism and questioning as to whether his decisions are influenced by his race? There is no similar rush to defend White judges, prosecutors, police, or jurors, when they are questioned, criticized, and attacked as ""White"" by the likes of Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Black Lies Matter, anti-Trump ""Viva La Raza!"" rioters waving Mexican Flags and burning the U.S. Flag, or other race-baiting non-White racialist individuals or organizations. Isn't that ""racist""?  


&gt;Manifestly, this federal judge was appointed by President Obama to his life-tenured federal judgeship not despite being Hispanic but because he is Hispanic. This is true, too, concerning Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor, who was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by Obama not on merit, but because she is Puerto Rican, and an activist leader of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund.

&gt;U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who has been criticized by Donald Trump as a “hater” appointed by President Obama who should be recused from the case, listed his membership in the “La Raza Lawyers of San Diego” on a judicial questionnaire he filled out when he was selected to be a federal judge. He was named in a brochure as a member of the selection committee for the organization’s 2014 Annual Scholarship Fund Dinner &amp; Gala. Meanwhile, the San-Diego based law firm representing the plaintiffs in the Trump University case, Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd, was listed as a sponsor of the event.

&gt;Apparently, it is now not only politically incorrect, but, in Newt Gingrich's term, ""inexcusable,"" to bring up the religious, racial or ethnic background of a judge, or suggest this might influence his actions on the bench.  

&gt;But these things matter.  

&gt;Does Newt think that when LBJ appointed Thurgood Marshall, ex-head of the NAACP, to the Supreme Court, he did not think Marshall would bring his unique experience as a black man and civil rights leader to the bench?  

&gt;Surely, that was among the reasons Marshall was appointed.
When Obama named Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, a woman of Puerto Rican descent who went through college on affirmative action scholarships, did Obama think this would not influence her decision when it came to whether or not to abolish affirmative action?  

&gt;**""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life,"" Sotomayor said in a speech at Berkeley law school and in other forums.**    

&gt;Translation: Ethnicity matters, and my Latina background helps guide my decisions...

Asked if he thought Britain would be better of if it left, he said: ""I don't know, you'd have to ask them. I just think they may leave.""

&gt;""I am going to treat everybody fairly but it wouldn't make any difference to me whether they were in the EU or not,"" Trump said. ""You would certainly not be back of the queue, that I can tell you.""  



&gt;Trump said that the EU is ""very bureaucratic and very difficult"" and has been a ""disaster,"" according to the interview.  



&gt;""I think maybe it's time … in light of what's happened with the craziness that's happening with the migration, people pouring all over the place.""  


&gt;May 5, Fox News: In an interview with Fox News’s “Special Report with Bret Baier,” Trump said the influx of Syrian refugees should convince the U.K. to exit the EU.  


&gt;“I think the migration has been a horrible thing for Europe,” he said. “A lot of that was pushed by the EU.”  


&gt;“I would say that they're better off without it, personally, but I'm not making that as a recommendation, just my feeling. I know Great Britain very well. I know, you know, the country very well. I have a lot of investments there. I would say that they're better off without it. But I want them to make their own decision.”  


&gt;March 24th, ITV: Asked if now was the right time for Britain to quit the EU, Mr Trump said: 'Yes, my mother was born, as you know in Scotland, in Stornoway, and she loved Scotland. 'She loved it more than anything, she'd go back every year religiously with my sisters and just had a great feeling for it and a great love for the people of Scotland and I think that Britain will separate from the EU. 'I think maybe it's time, especially in light of what's happened, with the craziness that's going on with the migration, with people pouring in all over the place.  


&gt;'I think that Britain will end up separating from the EU, that's my opinion.

By comparison, Ben Carson and Trump — two popular “outsiders” — seem much better at knowing how to talk to ordinary people. In fact, the famed neurosurgeon and the real estate tycoon are so good at “dialing down” their language that they speak at very low grade levels — Carson at sixth grade and Trump at fourth.

On May 27, Curiel, at the request of The Washington Post, made public plaintiff accusations against Trump University -- that the whole thing was a scam. The Post, which Bob Woodward tells us has 20 reporters digging for dirt in Trump's past, had a field day.

And who is Curiel?

An appointee of President Obama, he has for years been associated with the La Raza Lawyers Association of San Diego, which supports pro-illegal immigrant organizations.

Set aside the folly of letting Clinton surrogates like the Post distract him from the message he should be delivering, what did Trump do to be smeared by a bipartisan media mob as a ""racist""?

He attacked the independence of the judiciary, we are told.

But Presidents Jefferson and Jackson attacked the Supreme Court, and FDR, fed up with New Deal programs being struck down, tried to ""pack the court"" by raising the number of justices to 15 if necessary.

Abraham Lincoln leveled ""that eminent tribunal"" in his first inaugural, and once considered arresting Chief Justice Roger Taney.

The conservative movement was propelled by attacks on the Warren Court. In the '50s and '60s, ""Impeach Earl Warren!"" was plastered on billboards and bumper stickers all across God's country.

The judiciary is independent, but that does not mean that federal judges are exempt from the same robust criticism as presidents or members of Congress.

Obama himself attacked the Citizens United decision in a State of the Union address, with the justices sitting right in front of him.

But Trump's real hanging offense was that he brought up the judge's ancestry, as the son of Mexican immigrants, implying that he was something of a judicial version of Univision's Jorge Ramos.

Apparently, it is now not only politically incorrect, but, in Newt Gingrich's term, ""inexcusable,"" to bring up the religious, racial or ethnic background of a judge, or suggest this might influence his actions on the bench.

But these things matter.

Does Newt think that when LBJ appointed Thurgood Marshall, ex-head of the NAACP, to the Supreme Court, he did not think Marshall would bring his unique experience as a black man and civil rights leader to the bench?

Surely, that was among the reasons Marshall was appointed.

When Obama named Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, a woman of Puerto Rican descent who went through college on affirmative action scholarships, did Obama think this would not influence her decision when it came to whether or not to abolish affirmative action?

""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life,"" Sotomayor said in a speech at Berkeley law school and in other forums.

Translation: Ethnicity matters, and my Latina background helps guide my decisions...

&gt;While critics of Trump have argued that the San Diego La Raza Lawyers’ association is not affiliated with the National Council of La Raza, consider the following:

• The San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association is a member of the La Raza Lawyers of California, affiliated with the Chicano/Latino Bar Association of California.  

• On the website of the La Raza Lawyers Association of California, at the bottom of the “Links &amp; Affiliates Page,” the National Council of La Raza is listed.  

• The website of the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association is joint-listed as San Diego’s Latino/Latina Bar Association.

• On the “endorsements” page, the combined website lists the National Council of La Raza as part of the “community,” along with the Hispanic National Bar Association,, a group that emerged with a changed name from the originally formed La Raza National Lawyers Association and the La Raza National Bar Association tracing its origin back to 1971.

• Further, while the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association and the National Council of La Raza are legally separate incorporated entities, the two groups appear to have an affiliation that traces back to the emergence of MEChA, the Moviemento Estudiantil Chicanos de Atzlán.

• MEChA is a 1960s radical separatist student movement in California that espoused the mythical Aztec idea of a “nation of Aztlán,” comprising much of the southwestern United States, including California.

United States, however, the Court held that only “true” threats are outside the First Amendment.981 The defendant in Watts, at a public rally at which he was expressing his opposition to the military draft, said, “If they ever make me carry a rifle, the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.”982 He was convicted of violating a federal statute that prohibited “any threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States.” The Supreme Court reversed. Interpreting the statute “with the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind,”983 it found that the defendant had not made a “true ‘threat,”’ but had indulged in mere “political hyperbole.”984  http://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-01/43-threats-of-violence.html

So, when he gets it passed and actually tortures someone he'll be equal to Hillary and Bill. It's not likely he'll convince many people. Maybe Bill and Hillary will switch positions again when it's politically expedient?   


At least he talked about it and the public had a conversation.

May 26, 2016 - **An America First Energy Plan**  
  

• American energy dominance will be declared a strategic economic and foreign policy goal of the United States.  

 
• America has 1.5 times as much oil as the combined proven resources of all OPEC countries; we have more Natural Gas than Russia, Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia Combined; we have three times more coal than Russia. Our total untapped oil and gas reserves on federal lands equal an estimated $50 trillion.  


• We will become, and stay, totally independent of any need to import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations hostile to our interests.  


• At the same time, we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy.    


• We will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure. Cheaper energy will also boost American agriculture.  

• We will get the bureaucracy out of the way of innovation, so we can pursue all forms of energy. This includes renewable energies and the technologies of the future. It includes nuclear, wind and solar energy – but not to the exclusion of other energy. The government should not pick winners and losers. Instead, it should remove obstacles to exploration. Any market has ups and downs, but lifting these draconian barriers will ensure that we are no longer at the mercy of global markets.

&gt;According to Gage, Trump is the only presidential candidate or major public figure who has written the Truther group a custom letter after being sent their DVDs and literature. Trump's campaign, Gage said, thanked the members of Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth for their “continued support.”

&gt;“Thank you for your book and DVDs,” read the email, which Gage forwarded to me. “Our advisors will investigate the claims made by the architects and engineers more thoroughly and draw their own conclusions from there. We appreciate your continued support. Sincerely, The Trump Campaign.”

&gt;Gage and his group were starstruck. “Someone actually acknowledged we took the time to send them something and said they would look at it,” Gage said. “That’s historic at this level of politics, a presidential candidate.”

&gt;...Near the end of our conversation, even Gage confessed he misses his life before 9/11 Truth.

&gt;“It is tiring after nine years, I have to say,” he said. “I am an architect, I’d rather be practicing architecture. I’ve been full time as a 9/11 Truth activist for five years and I’m looking forward to going back to architecture. I make more money, I have more fun.”

&gt;He paused.

&gt;“But my country’s at stake.”

&gt;Elizabeth Warren needs to explain how Harvard Law’s official EEOC records identified her as Native American. In order for her to be listed in the Action Plan Book dated 1999, she would have had to self-report this information to Harvard at some point (assuming Harvard did not intuit this by looking at her).  


&gt;While Warren’s defenders insist she did not benefit from her minority status, that is no longer the question. As always, it’s the “cover-up,” not the “crime,” that does the most damage.  


&gt;In this case, the facts are clearly at odds with the story Warren has told about her employment record. The voters in Massachusetts are entitled to take her truthfulness into account when they make their decision about who will represent them this November.

***   
Links to:  

&gt;Bernie Sanders may be the most spineless presidential candidate in history. **When the protesters started yelling at him, he stopped, looked around nervously, then sheepishly asked his Secret Service detail, “Er, you want to do something about those guys?”** No wonder #BlackLivesMatter was able to steal his microphone! Contrast this with Trump turning to fight a maniac who tried to rush the stage and attack him. Sanders gets a couple of hecklers and he dumps a loaf in his Depends.

&gt;It’s this lack of backbone – combined with his inability to secure the Black vote – that will doom Sanders’ campaign...

Enforcing established laws and national security is a ""radical separation"" brought on by ""shame""?! Funny to see people need to twist the story to suit their bias. Not a bad article otherwise.

So, those high paying manufacturing jobs should have stayed, and increased in number, in the USA. 


&gt;The point wasn't to generate more revenue for America.  


*“(i)t is essential that we move aggressively [to negotiate new trade pacts], because trade means jobs. More trade means higher incomes for American workers.”* Bush on NAFTA    

&gt;It was to keep some of the manufacturing from going to China, and to keep those dollars in North America.  

Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in 1993, the rise in the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico through 2002 has caused the displacement of production that supported 879,280 U.S. jobs. Most of those lost jobs were high-wage positions in manufacturing industries. The loss of these jobs is just the most visible tip of NAFTA’s impact on the U.S. economy. In fact, NAFTA has also contributed to rising income inequality, suppressed real wages for production workers, weakened workers’ collective bargaining powers and ability to organize unions, and reduced fringe benefits.

&gt;Modeling results is a simple concept: look at past data, identify patterns, and use those patterns to make predictions.

3493,"The Donald and the Dollar

The night of the Indiana primary, something interesting happened in the currency market.

As the Asian session was just opening, the news of Donald Trump’s decisive victory pushed the dollar higher against most major trading partners, especially against the yen.

Then, later in the night, when Ted Cruz dropped out of the race, the greenback pushed even higher.

For most investors, the notion that the Donald is good for the dollar may seem bizarre. This is, after all, the man who sent the media and conventional economists into outbursts of rage when he suggested that the U.S. government should negotiate its debt with creditors.

In all fairness to Trump, that wasn’t really what he said. He was simply musing about the prospect of using “on-the-run” bonds (those freshly issued by the Treasury) to pay off the “off-the-run” bonds (those that have been circulating in the secondary market for a while).

The idea is that off-the-run bonds trade at a discount to on-the-run bonds, kind of like the discount that occurs when a brand-new car is driven off the lot. The product is essentially the same, but now it’s worth a lot less.
The U.S. presidential race could have a big impact on the dollar/yuan rate.

In any case, Trump’s ruminations were not even that unorthodox. The U.S. Treasury considered such a plan as early as 1999, when the U.S. was running budget surpluses and when the government was thinking about reducing the face amount of U.S. debt. Still, the kernel behind Trump’s idea does imply that he is betting on the deterioration of U.S. credit as a way to squeeze the creditors.

So why then would the dollar rally on the idea of a Trump win? The reason actually lies elsewhere. One of Trump’s strongest and most committed policy stances is that the U.S.-China trade relationship should be seriously re-examined.

His take-no-prisoners stance against the Chinese could actually become the key stress point in the global economy. China is already hurting. After spending more than a trillion dollars in additional credit, the Chinese economy continues to slow. In fact, imports have fallen by double-digits on a year-over-year basis for the first four months of 2016.
“Now that a Trump presidency looks like a real possibility, the prospect of a yuan crash has become a much bigger risk.”

Despite their typical bravado, the Chinese leadership is clearly worried. And what they fear most is a rapid devaluation of the yuan. The country is already running a debt-to-GDP ratio of 280%. And despite $3 trillion in reserves, Chinese policymakers are very concerned that capital outflows could quickly deplete their war chest.

For the past few months, mollified by the dovish stance of the Fed and the still uncertain outcome of the Republican primaries, the yuan stabilized. But now that a Trump presidency looks like a real possibility, the prospect of a yuan crash has become a much bigger risk.

Trump, of course, is the master of seizing his opponents’ weakness and will likely be much more hardnosed with the Chinese than Hillary Clinton would be. Little wonder, then, that the yuan has fallen to its weakest reading against the buck in more than two months. The currency markets are beginning to understand just how the game will be played.

Although dollar strength may be viewed as positive from a political point of view, economically it could wreak havoc on the markets.

U.S. equity markets are American in name only. Many Dow Jones-listed companies earn as much as 70% of their revenue offshore. A strengthening dollar could depress earnings for several quarters forward and cause a correction in stocks of 20% or more.

That’s why for equity investors this summer the most important number to follow will not be the market’s P/E ratio, but rather the dollar’s exchange rate and Trump’s presidential poll readings. As the dollar starts to rise along with Trump’s poll numbers, stocks could fall hard.

You're not wrong. I couldn't find a ""he's going to lose"" comment from the Clinton campaign.  



&gt;And they will look similarly foolish in November.    

Nah, Trump and the simple fact that it would be historically unprecedented for her to win will be enough.  
***   

&gt;But any intelligent discussion of 2016 must begin with the fact that history is very strongly against the Democrats in 2016. In the modern two-party era (beginning with the first Republican Party presidential campaign in 1856), there have been 16 elections following the re-election of an incumbent president; in 11 of those races, there was no incumbent on the ballot. An analysis of those elections shows a startlingly uniform pattern over time: the incumbent party (i.e., the party that won the last election) consistently lost ground relative to the challenger party (the party out of power), especially when running without an incumbent on the ballot. And in nearly every such election, that loss of popular support was evident in closely-divided battleground states, rather than confined to uncompetitive states. The trend has persisted in winning and losing elections, in elections with and without third-party challengers, in times of war and peace, booms and depressions. It has become more, rather than less, pronounced in the years since World War II, and at all times has been more pronounced when the incumbent party is the Democrats.

&gt;Given the narrow margin for error enjoyed by President Obama in 2012, a swing of a little less than 3 points in the two-party vote would hand the White House to the Republicans—and swings of that size are far more the rule than the exception.

&gt;*He specified later that he didn’t mean renegotiating bond terms, which countries like Argentina and Greece have done repeatedly. What he says he meant was buying back bonds at discounts after rates have risen, much as a company at risk of bankruptcy might buy its own bonds back at, say, 70 cents on the dollar and thus reduce what it owes. “I don’t want to renegotiate the bonds, but I think you can do discounting,” he said.*  
  

&gt;This is actually a good trade. If you issue, say, a 2 percent 10-year at par, and rates go up to 5 percent, your bond will be worth about $77. So you can buy it back by issuing $77 of 5 percent 10-year debt. This is not an improvement in, like, economic or net-present-value terms. But it is a reduction in the face amount of the debt, and politically, people seem to care about the face amount of the U.S. government's debt. We've talked about this before, when we discussed the idea of issuing super-high-coupon bonds to get around the debt ceiling; the Trump trade is ""a more subtle variant"" of that plan.

The food we eat is cheap because underpaid people, with no rights, are continually exploited by tax dodging multinational corps in cahoots with the gov.

&gt;You do realize that ""US debt"" is NOT ""trade deficit"" right?  

Why are you talking about the debt? What's been done to fix it that Trump will have to re-fix?   

&gt;ACTUAL Chinese military adventurism   


&gt;The fact that the global trading system is not working as promised is most dramatically evident in the seas around China. Beijing is engaged in a pattern of provocation bordering on recklessness. In late 2013, China unilaterally imposed an “air defense declaration zone” covering portions of the East China Sea. Earlier this year, the Chinese navy set about transforming a reef in the Spratly Islands into a military base.

&gt;International relations in East and South Asia are tenser than at any time since the 1960s. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last year compared the situation to 1914 just before World War One. The U.S. Navy recently began to directly challenge China’s claims of sovereignty over large swaths of the South China Sea.

• Bring China to the bargaining table by immediately declaring it a currency manipulator.  

• Protect American ingenuity and investment by forcing China to uphold intellectual property laws and stop their unfair and unlawful practice of forcing U.S. companies to share proprietary technology with Chinese competitors as a condition of entry to China’s market.  

• Reclaim millions of American jobs and reviving American manufacturing by putting an end to China’s illegal export subsidies and lax labor and environmental standards. No more sweatshops or pollution havens stealing jobs from American workers.  

• Strengthen our negotiating position by lowering our corporate tax rate to keep American companies and jobs here at home, attacking our debt and deficit so China cannot use financial blackmail against us, and bolstering the U.S. military presence in the East and South China Seas to discourage Chinese adventurism.

&gt;Economists estimate the Chinese yuan is undervalued by anywhere from 15% to 40%. This grossly undervalued yuan gives Chinese exporters a huge advantage while imposing the equivalent of a heavy tariff on U.S. exports to China. Such currency manipulation, in concert with China’s other unfair practices, has resulted in chronic U.S. trade deficits, a severe weakening of the U.S. manufacturing base and the loss of tens of millions of American jobs.  


&gt;In a system of truly free trade and floating exchange rates like a Trump administration would support, America's massive trade deficit with China would not persist. On day one of the Trump administration the U.S. Treasury Department will designate China as a currency manipulator. This will begin a process that imposes appropriate countervailing duties on artificially cheap Chinese products, defends U.S. manufacturers and workers, and revitalizes job growth in America. We must stand up to China’s blackmail and reject corporate America’s manipulation of our politicians. The U.S. Treasury’s designation of China as a currency manipulator will force China to the negotiating table and open the door to a fair – and far better – trading relationship.

&gt;Too many companies – from great American brands to innovative startups – are leaving America, either directly or through corporate inversions. The Democrats want to outlaw inversions, but that will never work. Companies leaving is not the disease, it is the symptom. Politicians in Washington have let America fall from the best corporate tax rate in the industrialized world in the 1980’s (thanks to Ronald Reagan) to the worst rate in the industrialized world. That is unacceptable. Under the Trump plan, America will compete with the world and win by cutting the corporate tax rate to 15%, taking our rate from one of the worst to one of the best.

Found this.  


 

&gt;Section 4, Article 4 of the U.S. Constitution, which states:

&gt;*The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.*  


&gt;ABC argues the constitutional is “unconditional,” “objective, not subjective,” “does not allow any decision by Washington” and “does not empower the U.S. government.”

&gt;“Thus, it is a constitutional command that the United State government ‘shall’ protect the border states against (a) invasion and (b) domestic violence related to a failure to secure the border,” ABC’s request to states explains.

&gt;“Border incursions by violent drug smugglers and other criminals form the primary basis for this constitutional demand. To protect against these criminals, the U.S. government is constitutionally required to secure the state’s borders (for all purposes).”

&gt;The request notes that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that states gave up many of their rights to pass laws controlling incursions when they joined the union. Furthermore, President Obama has exercised absolute control in that regard, bringing a lawsuit against Arizona for its law allowing state law enforcement officers to enforce federal immigration laws.

&gt;“Article 4, Section 4 was a corresponding guarantee that the U.S. government would take over that responsibility. As a condition of Arizona giving up the power that the U.S. Supreme Court says has been ceded to the federal government, Arizona received in return an absolute, unconditional guarantee of protection from the federal government. Therefore, Arizona does have the power under our U.S. Constitution to force action by Washington to secure Arizona’s border with Mexico to the same extent that Arizona handed over such power to the federal government,” the ABC campaign explains.




&gt;“‘Invasion’ does not necessarily have to be large,” the group says. ‘In 1789, a typical military action could be a small cross-border raiding party. A state of war might involve months of inactivity in between small battles.

This is new to me but it's getting clear that if Trump wins the shenanigans stop.   



&gt;All of our trading partners (competitors) understand trade deficits and they do something about them. When Mexico agreed to eliminate a tariff on imported goods from the U.S. they immediately enacted a 15% value added tax on U.S. imports. When the countries in the CAFTA agreement dropped their tariffs, most of these countries replaced the tariffs with a 12% consumption tax on imports. In fact, 148 of our trading partners have a value added tax (VAT) or goods and service tax (GST), and they range from 2% to 27%. These are a form of a consumption tax and they are levied in a number of different ways,

&gt;The U.S. has tried for many years to offset the VAT and GST by exempting our exporter’s income from U.S. taxes by up to 30%. In 1998, 2000, and 2004 the European Union appealed to the World Trade Organization (WTO) claiming that the exemptions were tax subsidies and the WTO ruled against the U.S. all 3 times. The only way we can offset the VATs is to implement our own. But the multi-national corporations and the Republican Congress are against raising taxes of any type (so far).

&gt;The so called free traders (be they Democrat or Republican) are not really free traders. They are supporters of mercantile trade where countries like China and Japan get to manipulate their currencies and use VATs against us to increase their exports and reduce their imports from us. Even though there is a provision in the WTO agreement that prohibits currency manipulation we do nothing about it.

The U.S. ran an overall trade deficit in goods in 2015 of $736.1719 billion. The largest contributor was   
China, $365,694,500,000   
Germany, $74,192,600,000   
Japan, $68,647,900,000   
Mexico, $58,363,700,000   
Vietnam, $30,921,400,000  

&gt;*Some analysts contend that the large U.S. trade deficit is an indicator that the trade relationship is unbalanced, unfair, and damaging to the U.S. economy,” said the report. “Others argue the large trade deficit with China is more of a reflection of global supply chains, where China is often the final point of assembly for export-oriented multinational firms.”*

That's not correct.  


&gt;according to the most up-to-date census data, based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), there has been a massive spike in net migration from Mexico since 2014,     

&gt;Here are the numbers obfuscated by Pew and ignored by the media:  


&gt;From 2009-2014, net migration was -140,000.  Because of the recession, roughly 140,000 more Mexican nationals left the country than migrated in from Mexico.  

&gt;Yet, from July 2014 through June 2015, the trend was completely reversed.  There was a 740,000 net increase in Mexican migration.  The population from Mexico grew 449,000 in just the first 6 months of 2015 alone!  

&gt;And this doesn’t factor in the massive influx from Central American countries.  There has been a 460,000 net increase in immigration from Central America since July 2014.

Bill must have known about Jeffrey’s girls. There were three desks in the living area of the villa on the island. They were covered with pictures of Jeffrey shaking hands with famous people and photos of naked girls, including one of me that Jeffrey had at all his houses, lying in a hammock. We all dined together that night. Jeffrey was at the head of the table. Bill was at his left. I sat across from him. Emmy Tayler, Ghislaine’s blonde British assistant, sat at my right. Ghislaine was at Bill’s left and at the left of Ghislaine there were two olive-skinned brunettes who’d flown in with us from New York. I’d never met them before. I’d say they were no older than 17, very innocent-looking.""

&gt;""opening up libel laws""  


&gt;*Libel laws are restrictions on misinformation that can be published. One of its elements, the element that Trump was referencing, is falsity. Falsity is exactly what it sounds like: A false factual statement.*    



&gt;[Here's a screenshot from CNN](https://i.sli.mg/zHDoFT.png). It says here that Trump needs 400 delegates to hit 1237. That's false. A reasonable person would think Trump only needs 390. You can google that shit or just do some very basic math. CNN is clearly negligent in reporting this.  


&gt;However, under the current system, Trump can't sue. He is a public figure and the rule for public figures is that you've gotta prove actual malice, meaning that he'd have to prove that CNN was out to get him. That's very hard.  


&gt;Another element is that the statement must be defamatory. Trump could easily show that it is. Plenty of research has been done to show that benchmark numbers matter to people, which is why $9.99 is a better price than $10.00. Tons of things he could cite to show 400 will discourage people and hurt his image.  


&gt;I can't tell you what the damage actually is or whether or not it'd be in Trump's interest to sue. That'd take more investigation than I've done. I know the law, but that's about it. The point is that CNN can defame Trump like this with near impunity and he has no legal recourse.

&gt;PolitiFact started off straight. As a partnership of Congressional Quarterly and the Tampa Bay Times (then the St. Petersburg Times) formed in 2007, the outfit won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the 2008 election. The partnership dissolved shortly after when The Poynnter Institute – the parent company of both outfits – sold off CQ.

&gt;The Florida journalists carried on alone, and their liberal tendencies became more obvious as the “Pants on Fire” rulings piled up on one side. By one count, from the end of that partnership to the end of 2011, the national PolitiFact operation has issued 119 Pants on Fire ratings for Republican or conservative claims, and only 13 for liberal or Democratic claims.

&gt;In another tally, just of claims made by elected officials, Republicans lose 64-10 over the same three-year period.

&gt;Remember when the president flew to Europe to make a pitch. Now, this is the President of the United States. He made a pitch for the Olympics to come to the United States and I think that’s great. I like it. But if you’re the president, you don’t go over there make a pitch and then not win, right? Too big of a position. If you’re the president, you got to know the answer before you go over.  


&gt;Trump said the president should have called to find out whether or not the Olympics would take place in America or not before leaving the country. “So, we have the President of the United States go over to make a pitch for the Olympics and he gets rejected. We didn’t come in first, or second or third. I think we came in fourth.”  


&gt;**“When you’re the President of the United States and you want to get the Olympics to come to this country, and you go over there and you don’t know the answer beforehand, you’re incompetent. You’re incompetent,” Trump challenged, adding, “Totally incompetent.”**

3966,"&gt;What the fuck has happened?  

You bought the spin.  


&gt;A story is making the rounds on Facebook that claims Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is calling for “ID badges” for American Muslims. The image on the story is of Jewish children wearing yellow starts during the Holocaust. Very frightening–and a lie.

&gt;Step 1: Seed. The lie begins with a Yahoo! profile in which Trump is asked, supposedly (the reporter does not provide his exact question), if he would “require registering Muslims in a database or giving them a form of special identification that noted their religion.”

&gt;Trump does not say yes or no. Instead, he dodges the question, and comes back to the question of monitoring mosques (which the U.S. has done in the past): “We’re going to have to–we’re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely,” Trump said when presented with the idea. “We’re going to have to look at the mosques. We’re going to have to look very, very carefully.”

&gt;The Yahoo! reporter, Hunter Walker (a hater of note), construes Trump’s answer as follows: “He wouldn’t rule it out.”

&gt;Step 2: Amplify. The story is picked up by CNN. Sara Murray asks whether Trump would “rule out” a database for Muslims–borrowing from Walker’s article. Trump is surprised, and tells her, truthfully, that he never responded to Walker’s question...

&gt;Step 3: Distort. NBC News’ Vaughn Hillyard confronts Trump: “Should there be a database system that tracks the Muslims here in this country?” Trump replies: “There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems. And today you can do it. But right now, we have to have a border, we have to have strength, we have to have a wall, and we cannot let what’s happening to this country happen any longer.” Hillyard asks: “But that’s something your White House would like to implement?” Trump: “Oh I would certainly implement that. Absolutely.” Hillyard follows up: What do you think the effect of that would be? How would that work? It would stop people from coming in illegally. We have to stop people from coming into our country illegally.” Hillyard asks if Trump would go to mosques to register people. “Different places,” Trump says.

&gt;Step 4: Smear. Hillyard comes back later, asking Trump: “Mr. Trump, why would Muslim databases not be the same thing as requiring Jews to register in Nazi Germany?” Trump realizes Hillyard is out for blood. “You tell me,” he says, and walks away...

&gt;To get the full gist of how the contrived Nazi allegation was advanced, read the ;original article.

[Defend The Laws And Constitution Of The United States](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform)  


America will only be great as long as America remains a nation of laws that lives according to the Constitution. No one is above the law. The following steps will return to the American people the safety of their laws, which politicians have stolen from them:

Triple the number of ICE officers. As the President of the ICE Officers’ Council explained in Congressional testimony: “Only approximately 5,000 officers and agents within ICE perform the lion’s share of ICE’s immigration mission…Compare that to the Los Angeles Police Department at approximately 10,000 officers. Approximately 5,000 officers in ICE cover 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam, and are attempting to enforce immigration law against 11 million illegal aliens already in the interior of the United States. Since 9-11, the U.S. Border Patrol has tripled in size, while ICE’s immigration enforcement arm, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), has remained at relatively the same size.” This will be funded by accepting the recommendation of the Inspector General for Tax Administration and eliminating tax credit payments to illegal immigrants.

Nationwide e-verify. This simple measure will protect jobs for unemployed Americans.

Mandatory return of all criminal aliens. The Obama Administration has released 76,000 aliens from its custody with criminal convictions since 2013 alone. All criminal aliens must be returned to their home countries, a process which can be aided by canceling any visas to foreign countries which will not accept their own criminals, and making it a separate and additional crime to commit an offense while here illegally.

Detention—not catch-and-release. Illegal aliens apprehended crossing the border must be detained until they are sent home, no more catch-and-release.

Defund sanctuary cities. Cut-off federal grants to any city which refuses to cooperate with federal law enforcement.

Enhanced penalties for overstaying a visa. Millions of people come to the United States on temporary visas but refuse to leave, without consequence. This is a threat to national security. Individuals who refuse to leave at the time their visa expires should be subject to criminal penalties; this will also help give local jurisdictions the power to hold visa overstays until federal authorities arrive. Completion of a visa tracking system – required by law but blocked by lobbyists – will be necessary as well.

Cooperate with local gang task forces. ICE officers should accompany local police departments conducting raids of violent street gangs like MS-13 and the 18th street gang, which have terrorized the country. All illegal aliens in gangs should be apprehended and deported. Again, quoting Chris Crane: “ICE Officers and Agents are forced to apply the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Directive, not to children in schools, but to adult inmates in jails. If an illegal-alien inmate simply claims eligibility, ICE is forced to release the alien back into the community. This includes serious criminals who have committed felonies, who have assaulted officers, and who prey on children…ICE officers should be required to place detainers on every illegal alien they encounter in jails and prisons, since these aliens not only violated immigration laws, but then went on to engage in activities that led to their arrest by police; ICE officers should be required to issue Notices to Appear to all illegal aliens with criminal convictions, DUI convictions, or a gang affiliation; ICE should be working with any state or local drug or gang task force that asks for such assistance.”

End birthright citizenship. This remains the biggest magnet for illegal immigration. By a 2:1 margin, voters say it’s the wrong policy, including Harry Reid who said “no sane country” would give automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.

Put American Workers First

Decades of disastrous trade deals and immigration policies have destroyed our middle class. Today, nearly 40% of black teenagers are unemployed. Nearly 30% of Hispanic teenagers are unemployed. For black Americans without high school diplomas, the bottom has fallen out: more than 70% were employed in 1960, compared to less than 40% in 2000. Across the economy, the percentage of adults in the labor force has collapsed to a level not experienced in generations. As CBS news wrote in a piece entitled “America’s incredible shrinking middle class”: “If the middle-class is the economic backbone of America, then the country is developing osteoporosis.”

The influx of foreign workers holds down salaries, keeps unemployment high, and makes it difficult for poor and working class Americans – including immigrants themselves and their children – to earn a middle class wage. Nearly half of all immigrants and their US-born children currently live in or near poverty, including more than 60 percent of Hispanic immigrants. Every year, we voluntarily admit another 2 million new immigrants, guest workers, refugees, and dependents, growing our existing all-time historic record population of 42 million immigrants. We need to control the admission of new low-earning workers in order to: help wages grow, get teenagers back to work, aid minorities’ rise into the middle class, help schools and communities falling behind, and to ensure our immigrant members of the national family become part of the American dream.

Additionally, we need to stop giving legal immigrant visas to people bent on causing us harm. From the 9/11 hijackers, to the Boston Bombers, and many others, our immigration system is being used to attack us. The President of the immigration caseworkers union declared in a statement on ISIS: “We've become the visa clearinghouse for the world.”

&gt;In July 2014 Obama met with the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala at the White House to discuss their ""shared responsibility"" to stem the flow of migrants to the United States. The four leaders pledged to ""address the underlying causes of migration by reducing criminal activity and promoting greater social and economic opportunity."" The Central American presidents said that the United States bore some responsibility for the crisis, due to its market for illicit substances that pass through the region, and its ""ambiguity"" on immigration reform. All three countries have launched media campaigns to discourage illegal outward migration.  

&gt;Luis Alberto Moreno, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, has proposed a large-scale aid package for the Northern Triangle similar to Plan Colombia, a U.S. aid program enacted 1999 that he says helped Colombia reduce violence and spur its economy. He argues that the money should go toward strengthening Central American institutions and rule of law, and combating crime.

&gt;“I think a lot of people think if he gets within 50-100 [of 1,237], he’ll be able to carry it,” said Steve House, the Colorado GOP chairman, who is himself an unbound delegate and is already being courted by the Trump and Cruz campaign  



&gt;“If he’s close after June 7, there’ll be a compelling reason for folks to say he’s won the most delegates by a lot and he’s won the most voters by a ton,” said Ron Kaufman, an RNC member from Massachusetts who is close to Mitt Romney and supported Jeb Bush earlier this year.

&gt;Kaufman believes this is the likeliest resolution to the GOP’s dramatic primary—and a perfectly acceptable one at that. “In the end, we want to make sure all those millions of people who voted in a Republican primary understand their votes were worthwhile. You just can’t kick all those voters—more than have ever voted in our primary before—to the curb. We want to make sure they’re with us in November.”  [source](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/trumps-real-magic-number-is-less-than-1-237-222184)

Donald J. Trump had this to say.  


&gt;“Look, nobody has better toys than I do,” he told reporters at a hotel on Staten Island, where he pressed his case that the system was rigged against him. “I can put them in the best planes and bring them to the best resorts anywhere in the world.”  

&gt;But Mr. Trump said that was unseemly.
&gt;“You’re basically buying these people,” he added. “You’re basically saying, ‘Delegate, listen, we’re going to send you to Mar-a-Lago on a Boeing 757, you’re going to use the spa, you’re going to this, you’re going to that, we want your vote.’ That’s a corrupt system.” [source](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/us/politics/donald-trump-delegates-new-york.html?_r=1)

Don't forget that to deny Trump delegates they changed the vote in FLA to winner take all because they thought Marco or Bush would win.

CO Zero Votes [Precinct Popular Vote](http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/CO-R)   

What's more.  

&gt;The GOP executive committee has voted to cancel the traditional presidential preference poll after the national party changed its rules to require a state's delegates to support the candidate who wins the caucus vote.

&gt;The move makes Colorado the only state so far to forfeit a role in the early nomination process, according to political experts, but other caucus states are still considering how to adapt to the new rule.  

&gt;The Colorado system often favors anti-establishment candidates who draw a dedicated following among activists — as evidenced by Rick Santorum's victory in 2012 caucus. So the party's move may hurt GOP contenders such as Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Rand Paul, who would have received a boost if they won the state.  http://web.archive.org/web/20160411185114/http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28700919/colorado-republicans-cancel-2016-presidential-caucus-vote

On the morning of September 11, the firehouse, under the direction of Battalion Chief Joseph Pfeifer, was called out on a reported ""odor of gas"" at Church and Lispenard Streets. Jules rode with Pfeifer to investigate, while Gedeon stayed behind at the firehouse with the ""probie.""

4113,"&gt;Today, there are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants here in the United States.  Some crossed the border illegally.  Others avoid immigration laws by overstaying their visas.  Regardless of how they came, the overwhelming majority of these folks are just trying to earn a living and provide for their families.  (Applause.)
 
&gt;But we have to acknowledge they’ve broken the rules.  They’ve cut in front of the line.  And what is also true is that the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are trying to immigrate legally.
 
&gt;Also, because undocumented immigrants live in the shadows, where they’re vulnerable to unscrupulous businesses that skirt taxes, and pay workers less than the minimum wage, or cut corners with health and safety laws, this puts companies who follow the rules, and Americans who rightly demand the minimum wage or overtime or just a safe place to work, it puts those businesses at a disadvantage.
 
&gt;Think about it.  Over the past decade, even before the recession hit, middle-class families were struggling to get by as the costs went up for everything, from health care, to college tuition, to groceries, to gas.  Their incomes didn’t go up with those prices.  We’re seeing it again right now with gas prices.
 
&gt;So one way to strengthen the middle class in America is to reform the immigration system so that there is no longer a massive underground economy that exploits a cheap source of labor while depressing wages for everybody else.  I want incomes for middle-class families to rise again.  (Applause.)  I want prosperity in this country to be widely shared.  (Applause.)  I want everybody to be able to reach that American dream.  And that’s why immigration reform is an economic imperative.  It’s an economic imperative.  (Applause.)

Needlessly so. The state of Sonora has [one of the healthiest economies within the Mexican nation](http://www.explorandomexico.com/state/25/Sonora/economy/) and the [26th lowest unemployment rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mexican_states_by_unemployment).  

Want to check and see if unemployment went down in Arizona? No interest in the American and legal immigrants getting those new jobs? The immigrants that came here legally probably came because they wanted a job too. Can you guess who deserves the job?

But I don't expect much from six corporate news organizations that don't want to address illegal immigration because they like cheap labor as much as you enjoy the privilege of prospering off people who can't fight back. Sad.

Mexico does actively send undesirables here.  When we send them back, [Mexico sent a delegation to Arizona](http://archive.is/Lf8u0#selection-315.0-315.90) eight years ago to complain about our deporting them.  They don’t want them back.

&gt;""Many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it. But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally,"" wrote Trump.

Not in the [Precinct Popular Vote](http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/CO-R)   

What's more.  

&gt;The GOP executive committee has voted to cancel the traditional presidential preference poll after the national party changed its rules to require a state's delegates to support the candidate who wins the caucus vote.

&gt;The move makes Colorado the only state so far to forfeit a role in the early nomination process, according to political experts, but other caucus states are still considering how to adapt to the new rule.  

&gt;The Colorado system often favors anti-establishment candidates who draw a dedicated following among activists — as evidenced by Rick Santorum's victory in 2012 caucus. So the party's move may hurt GOP contenders such as Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Rand Paul, who would have received a boost if they won the state.  http://web.archive.org/web/20160411185114/http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28700919/colorado-republicans-cancel-2016-presidential-caucus-vote

[Is rape the price to pay for migrant women chasing the American Dream?](http://fusion.net/story/17321/is-rape-the-price-to-pay-for-migrant-women-chasing-the-american-dream/)  

&gt;A staggering 80 percent of Central American girls and women crossing Mexico en route to the United States are raped along the way, according to directors of migrant shelters interviewed by Fusion.  

The Fusion article builds on an Amnesty International report that estimated rapes at 60%. 

It's true women get raped and Don Lemon knows all about it. The pipeline of criminals raping women stretches across the length of Mexico to the border of the USA. Nobody talks about it Obama doesn't, Hillary doesn't, Bernie doesn't, Ted's a mess, nobody cares because nobody talks about it. Oh yeah. Donald J. Trump talks about it. It's about goddamned time. What's your answer to women getting raped on the way to provide you with cheap labor? That's one hell of a price to pay to get a job.

That's the problem with holding a rally question and kkk dreams so close to heart. 


&gt;When asked about Trump as the GOP nominee in November instead of Cruz, registered voters are split between Clinton and Trump, though the race is tighter: Thirty-eight percent would vote for Clinton and 36 percent would vote for Trump. Another 16 percent would vote for a third party candidate and 8 percent would abstain from voting.

The Economic Bill of Rights  


January 11, 1944  


Often referred to as the ""Second Bill of Rights""  


Excerpted from Franklin Delano Roosevelt's message to Congress on the State of the Union. **This was proposed not to amend the Constitution, but rather as a political challenge, encouraging Congress to draft legislation to achieve these aspirations.** It is sometimes referred to as the ""Second Bill of Rights.""   



It is our duty now to begin to lay the plans and determine the strategy for the winning of a lasting peace and the establishment of an American standard of living higher than ever before known. We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people — whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth — is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and insecure.    



This Republic had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rights — among them the right of free speech, free press, free worship, trial by jury, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. They were our rights to life and liberty.  


As our nation has grown in size and stature, however — as our industrial economy expanded — these political rights proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness.  


We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. ""Necessitous men are not free men."" People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.  


In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all — regardless of station, race, or creed.  



Among these are:  


    The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;   


    The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;  

    The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;  

    The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;  

    The right of every family to a decent home;  

    The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;  

    The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;  

    The right to a good education.  


All of these rights spell security. And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being.  


America's own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens.

&gt;Another unnoticed fact is that Graham’s calls for release of the 28 pages have matched up, chronologically, with changes in Saudi government leadership. That is, the times when Graham has made noise about the 28 pages have run parallel to the times of uncertainty with regard to the succession of the Saudi monarchy or Saudi strategic partnerships. This suggests that Graham is simply using the redacted section of his report as a control mechanism to bring new Saudi leadership in line with continued U.S. interests.

4521,"&gt; Marijuana-related traffic deaths increased 32 percent    

Did you get that quote from the [Rocky Mountain HIDTA](https://www.ncjrs.gov/ondcppubs/publications/enforce/hidta2001/rocky-fs.html) office of national drug control policy who's responsible for drug task forces?




&gt;There are a number of statistical lies that are being presented.
&gt;1. If you had a blood alcohol level that would put you near a coma, and you tested positive for THC, it is reported as being ""marijuana related,"" even though THC was probably not causative whatsoever. Kinda like shooting heroin and dying of an OD, but since you have aspirin (or THC or fill-in-the blank) in your blood, it is attributed to the aspirin.  

&gt;2. The numbers are still tiny. There was an article about ""Marijuana related calls to the Rocky Mountain Poison Center is now in double digits"" meaning there were now 11 calls. The AAPCC does not issue any warnings regarding THC use and toxicity.  

&gt;2. THC was not routinely tested in the blood so any year-over-year increase is meaningless at this point.  

&gt;3. No one really knows how much THC affects your driving. Most studies outside of active prohibitionists like NIDA show that its effects are minimal. There are hundreds of studies, take a look on Google. NORML has a bunch of links. http://norml.org/library/item/.... The 5ng number used by the state is absurd, it is indicative that you used cannabis in the last few days.  

&gt;4. As another comment pointed out, the issue in the end is simple. If traffic fatalities are down, then cannabis is responsible for a net increase in safety. This holds true for other areas such as domestic violence, where alcohol is probably causative of at least half of the incidents.  

&gt;The argument that ""now we have n deaths from cannabis shows what a bad mistake legalization is,"" is like saying there are were some deaths from vaccines (there are) so they should be banned, even if banning them results in 10,000's or 100,000's of deaths.",2016-04-11 21:36:21+00:00,d1yzsod,3.0,t1_d1yw6pv,4858.0,politics

&gt;""great for veterans?""   

Yeah, really. Super great for veterans.  


&gt;More significant costs would come from Mr. Trump’s plan to reform the Veterans Affairs administration and the VA health system in particular. While most of his policy proposals would have relatively small and largely offsetting costs and savings, Mr. Trump’s plan to allow “all veterans eligible for VA health care [to] bring their veteran’s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately” (emphasis in original) would come with significant cost. Last year, CBO estimated several similar but much less expansive bills would roughly double VA health spending – costing in the range of $500 billion over a decade. Unlike legislation that would limit private health care to those facing long wait times at the VA and based on VA contracts, Mr. Trump’s proposal would offer private health care to all veterans and allow them to see any doctor. As a result, his proposal could be significantly more expensive and ultimately cost between $500 billion and $1 trillion over ten years.",2016-04-06 19:01:31+00:00,d1shtsa,2.0,t1_d1sf8q6,3225.0,politics

&gt;Undocumented workers earn some of the lowest wages in our country. Moreover, the corporations employing them profit by not having to pay undocumented workers health and sometimes from paying them below minimum wage. Undocumented workers are the staples of our agricultural, restaurant, landscaping, hospitality, and housekeeping industries. Yet they remain social pariahs for a significant number of political candidates and voters. [source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-merriman/our-economy-profits-from-_2_b_2551900.html)

Remember that all the data handled by a nation’s Secretary of State was knowingly handed over to a private company (Platte River Networks) with no clearance to handle potentially classified government information! 


Secretary of State John Kerry was asked by Congress a month ago if he would use or allow his staff to use a private server to send and receive classified information. This is what he said:

    *“In today’s world, given all that we’ve learned and what we understand about the vulnerability of our system, we don’t do that, no.”*

&gt;Conclusion

&gt;The glyphosate tests on the 10 wines were not a scientific study. However, these tests provide compelling evidence that the wine producers which use glyphosate based herbicides or other toxic chemicals in any product and regulators who approve products for safety will need to conduct or require independent testing for glyphosate and co formulants and responsibly insure the safety and purity of their wines.

&gt;The results which show glyphosate present in organic and biodynamic wine point to serious implications for the organic and biodynamic wine industry. If herbicide drift is not contained, the value of the wine, name brand and livelihood of these farmers are at risk due to no fault of their own. Conventional chemically farmed vineyard owners may reconsider the legal implications of contaminating a neighbor’s crops. 700 lawsuits are currently pending against Monsanto for the connection between non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Roundup.

&gt;Currently the FDA does not require end product testing or labeling for pesticides. The EPA also does not require full formulation, long term safety testing of herbicide or pesticide products such as Roundup; they only require the testing of the declared “active” chemical ingredient. Therefore we do not know the type or amount of the other co­formulants in the glyphosate based herbicides or other pesticides that are also likely to be present in the wines.

&gt;By not requiring the full formulation long­term safety testing of all chemical combinations in products consumed by our citizens, the claim that any of these products are safe is a fraud. The fact is that none of the pesticides, herbicides, food, or beverages are properly tested and labeled.

&gt;Concerned citizens are encouraged to ask their wine producers if they use pesticides and herbicides such as Roundup/glyphosate and do their best to avoid toxic chemical exposure.

&gt;Glyphosate residues are allowed on 160 of food and feed crops by the EPA at levels 0.2 to 400 ppm (1). The level of glyphosate detected in the wine far exceeds the residues allowed on fruit. German scientists have shown that 0.1 ppb of glyphosate, which is patented as an antibiotic, has been shown to destroy the beneficial gut bacteria and promote the proliferation of pathogenic gut bacteria.(2) The gut bacteria are where 70% of the immune system lies in humans.

&gt;0.1ppt of glyphosate has also been shown to stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells.(3) Glyphosate has been shown to destroy human placental cells,(4) be a neurotoxin (5), cause sex hormone changes and liver and kidney damage (6), birth defects and miscarriages (7) (8). Glyphosate has also been shown to increase antibiotic resistance, which could be leading to superbugs (9).

&gt;Glyphosate has been deemed a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization. (10)

In every conversation, in every meeting, you're careful to watch your every word. Every casual encounter in the hallway becomes a potential confrontation. Every time you meet a co-worker's eyes, you wonder if they are well-disposed or a secret enemy seeking to destroy your job, your career, and your life. You walk on eggshells, and you learn to stop sharing your opinion with anyone about anything, unless it is about something safely innocuous, like sports. What you don't realize is that you've just survived your first SJW attack. And you're luckier than most. You still have your job, you still have your reputation, and you still have your friends and family. Tens of thousands of people are not so lucky. In the universities, in the churches, in the corporations, in the professional associations, in the editorial offices, in the game studios, and just about everywhere else you can imagine, free speech and free thought are under siege by a group of fanatics as self-righteous as Savonarola, as ruthless as Stalin, as ambitious as Napoleon, and as crazy as Caligula.

In general

Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end the following:
(z)
(1)

If the food or an ingredient of the food is produced or derived from genetic engineering, unless it bears labeling stating that fact in accordance with paragraphs (3) and (4).
(2)

The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply—
(A)

**if it is a processed food and the ingredients produced from genetic engineering do not, in the aggregate, account for more than nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total weight of the processed food;**
(B)

if the food would be subject to this paragraph solely because a genetically engineered vaccine was used at any point in the production of the food or the lifecycle of its agricultural inputs; or
(C)

if it is a food or processed food that would be subject to this paragraph solely because it was produced using a processing aid (including yeast) or enzyme that was produced or derived from genetic engineering.
(3)

In the case of a food that is not a food described in paragraph (4), a producer shall meet the labeling requirement under this paragraph by inserting either—
(A)

the words ""genetically engineered"" or the abbreviation ""GE"" in parenthesis immediately following the common or usual name of each genetically engineered ingredient;
(B)

an asterisk next to the common or usual name of each genetically engineered ingredient with a statement, in a font size no smaller than the words ""Ingredient List"", at the bottom of the ingredient list that denotes that the ingredient or ingredients are genetically engineered;
(C)

a statement, established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, at the bottom of the ingredient list (or if there is no such ingredient list, on the information panel of the food) that would disclose that the food is produced or partially produced with genetic engineering or contains genetically engineered ingredients; or
(D)

**a symbol, established by the Secretary, that would disclose the presence of a genetically engineered ingredient or genetically engineered ingredients in the food in a clear and conspicuous manner.
(4)**  



In the case of a food or an ingredient of a food that is produced or derived from genetic engineering and is a raw agricultural commodity either unpackaged or packaged for retail sale, the producer complies with labeling regulations established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture.
(5)

For purposes of this paragraph, whether a food or ingredient of a food was produced or derived from a genetically engineered plant variety or animal shall, by itself, constitute information that is material within the meaning of section 201(n).

4936,"&gt;If a man wants to be the President he should have already known that inciting violence at his rally's was a bad move.   

When did that become a requirement? 

&gt;A leader shows forethought to not let this happen in the first place, and Trump lacks that entirely.  

Is that why they make an announcement not to be violent before the rally and why Tump says it before he starts into his stump speech because he's not showing forethought?  

&gt;Am I supposed to wait for him to fuck up a peace accord before he learns how to negotiate like an adult between countries?  

His negotiation skills are in question? Negotiations are typically what rich businessman are particularly skilled in. 

&gt;No.  

Then don't wait. Whatever that means? 

&gt;He should get these things right the first time because he is trying to be a leader.   

Trying is multiple attempts at getting things right by definition.

&gt;And yet Kasich came in less than 10 points ahead of a New York real estate developer — half of Trump’s margin of victory over Rubio in Rubio’s home state. Adjusting for the home state advantage, that’s a humiliating defeat.

&gt;**House Speaker Paul Ryan's spokeswoman says he ""will not accept a nomination"" to be the Republican running for president — even if his predecessor, John Boehner, nominated him.**  

&gt;The possibility of a Ryan nomination at a contested Republican Party convention started when he said in a CNBC interview, ""There are a lot of people running for president. We'll see. Who knows?""

&gt;Former House Speaker John Boehner jumped on the comments, saying he would support Ryan if Republicans can't nominate any candidate at the convention. His spokesman, Dave Schnittger, said Boehner made the comments Wednesday at a conference in Boca Raton, Florida.

&gt;But Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong moved quickly to quash any talk of Ryan becoming the nominee.

&gt;**""The speaker is grateful for the support, but he is not interested,"" she said in an emailed statement. ""He will not accept a nomination and believes our nominee should be someone who ran this year.""**

According to this footnote, “Abu Zubaydah, who worked closely with the al Qaeda leadership,** has stated that KSM originally presented Bin Ladin with a scaled-down version of the 9/11 plan, and that Bin Ladin urged KSM to expand the operation with the comment, ‘Why do you use an axe when you can use a bulldozer?’”[8]  That’s pretty extensive and intimate knowledge for someone who was never associated with al Qaeda.

&gt;It’s unclear why Amazon disabled this feature, and the company did not answer to repeated requests for comment. But the move definitely comes at a weird time. Apple has received support from some users and technologists in its fight with the FBI over the encryption of the iPhone, which is enabled by default since 2014. For some, Amazon’s backtrack might be a good enough reason to boycott the company.

5143,"U.S. Under Attack; World Trade Center Destroyed

The United States was struck Tuesday by what appeared to be a coordinate series of terrorist attacks on Washington, D.C., and New York City that have destroyed the World Trade Center and are feared to have left many thousands dead.

Both the towers of the World Trade Center collapsed after being hit by planes. An aircraft also hit the Pentagon in the Washington, D.C., area, causing serious damage. There are reports of a fourth airliner had been brought down near Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, by U.S. military fighters. A fifth plane has crashed in Western Pennsylvania. A car bomb exploded outside the State Department, according to State Department sources.

CBS News reported that as many as eight planes have been hijacked and only four have been accounted for.

President Bush described as the incidents as an “apparent terrorist attack” and “a national tragedy.” He said that the U.S. “would hunt down and find” the perpetrators.

The White House has been evacuated and New York City is on full terror alert. The Federal Aviation Administration has grounded all outgoing flights in the country. All international flights to U.S. destinations have been diverted to Canada. Military jets flew above New York and Washington following the attacks.

The first incident happened at about 9 a.m. when an American Airlines passenger jet — that had been reportedly hijacked on a flight from Boston to Los Angeles — hit the northern tower of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan’s financial district. Shortly afterward, the southern tower was struck by an unmarked plane.

An hour later, the tower collapsed, following what eyewitnesses describe as a series of 15 explosions inside the building. Half an hour after that, the second tower fell, leaving southern Manhattan covered in a pall of smoke and dust.

About 50,000 people work in the World Trade Center. Many were arriving to their jobs when the first plane struck. Workers in buildings across Manhattan were evacuated. The New York stock exchange was closed for the day.

“We looked outside and there was a second plane, it looked like it came from the east side, there were no markings,” according to Forbes.com CFO Bob Tomlinson, who was facing the buildings from his Flatiron district office. “[The plane] was big, and dark –brown or black — it was large, and it had a military look.”

The second impact, which happened about 15 minutes after the first, caused an enormous ball of fire and scattered huge chunks of debris on the sidewalks and streets below. The fire could be seen for miles on the clear, cool September day

The attacks come 23 years after the signing of the Camp David Accords on Sept. 17, 1978. That agreement, brokered by President Jimmy Carter between Egyptian President Muhammad Anwar al-Sadat and Menachem Begin, the then Prime Minister of Israel was supposed to provide a framework for peace in the Middle East.

It also comes eight years after the World Trade Center was bombed in a terrorist attack, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000.

The twin towers of the World Trade Center, one of the most recognizable landmarks in the United States, each have 110 stories, rising up 1,300 feet and are the tallest buildings in New York City and the third tallest buildings on the planet. The towers are home to financial firms like long bond traders Cantor Fitzgerald and mutual fund firm Fred Alger Management, as well as the famous tourist restaurant Windows on the World.

How could that possibly be, if the official story were true? According to that story, United 93, going 580 miles per hour, crashed into a field in Pennsylvania. Such a crash would have instantly disconnected all calls. Would the fact that these two calls remained connected for over an hour not prove that the calls were not coming from UA 93?

**SEC. 909. United States-Israel trade and commercial enhancement.**

(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:

(1) Israel is America’s dependable, democratic ally in the Middle East—an area of paramount strategic importance to the United States.

(2) The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement formed the modern foundation of the bilateral commercial relationship between the two countries and was the first such agreement signed by the United States with a foreign country.

(3) The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement has been instrumental in expanding commerce and the strategic relationship between the United States and Israel.

(4) More than $45,000,000,000 in goods and services is traded annually between the two countries, in addition to roughly $10,000,000,000 in United States foreign direct investment in Israel.

(5) The United States continues to look for and find new opportunities to enhance cooperation with Israel, including through the enactment of the United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–150; 22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) and the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 (Public Law 113–296; 128 Stat. 4075).

(6) It has been the policy of the United States Government to combat all elements of the Arab League Boycott of Israel by—

(A) public statements of Administration officials;

(B) enactment of relevant sections of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.) (as continued in effect pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)), including sections to ensure foreign persons comply with applicable reporting requirements relating to the Boycott;

(C) enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (Public Law 94–455; 90 Stat. 1520) that denies certain tax benefits to entities abiding by the Boycott;

(D) ensuring through free trade agreements with Bahrain and Oman that such countries no longer participate in the Boycott; and

(E) ensuring as a condition of membership in the World Trade Organization that Saudi Arabia no longer enforces the secondary or tertiary elements of the Boycott.

(b) Statements of policy.—Congress—

(1) supports the strengthening of economic cooperation between the United States and Israel and recognizes the tremendous strategic, economic, and technological value of cooperation with Israel;

(2) recognizes the benefit of cooperation with Israel to United States companies, including by improving American competitiveness in global markets;

(3) recognizes the importance of trade and commercial relations to the pursuit and sustainability of peace, and supports efforts to bring together the United States, Israel, the Palestinian territories, and others in enhanced commerce;

(4) opposes politically motivated actions that penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations specifically with Israel, such as boycotts of, divestment from, or sanctions against Israel;

(5) notes that boycotts of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel by governments, governmental bodies, quasi-governmental bodies, international organizations, and other such entities are contrary to principle of nondiscrimination under the GATT 1994 (as defined in section 2(1)(B) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3501(1)(B)));

(6) encourages the inclusion of politically motivated actions that penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations specifically with Israel such as boycotts of, divestment from, or sanctions against Israel as a topic of discussion at the U.S.-Israel Joint Economic Development Group (JEDG) to support the strengthening of the United States-Israel commercial relationship and combat any commercial discrimination against Israel; and

(7) supports efforts to prevent investigations or prosecutions by governments or international organizations of United States persons solely on the basis of such persons doing business with Israel, with Israeli entities, or in any territory controlled by Israel.

(c) Principal trade negotiating objectives of the United States.—

(1) COMMERCIAL PARTNERSHIPS.—Among the principal trade negotiating objectives of the United States for proposed trade agreements with foreign countries regarding commercial partnerships are the following:

(A) To discourage actions by potential trading partners that directly or indirectly prejudice or otherwise discourage commercial activity solely between the United States and Israel.

(B) To discourage politically motivated boycotts of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel and to seek the elimination of politically motivated nontariff barriers on Israeli goods, services, or other commerce imposed on Israel.

(C) To seek the elimination of state-sponsored unsanctioned foreign boycotts of Israel, or compliance with the Arab League Boycott of Israel, by prospective trading partners.

(2) EFFECTIVE DATE.—This subsection takes effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and applies with respect to negotiations commenced before, on, or after such date of enactment.

(d) Report on politically motivated acts of boycott of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel.—

(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the President shall submit to Congress a report on politically motivated boycotts of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel.

(2) MATTERS TO BE INCLUDED.—The report required by paragraph (1) shall include the following:

(A) A description of the establishment of barriers to trade, including nontariff barriers, investment, or commerce by foreign countries or international organizations against United States persons operating or doing business in Israel, with Israeli entities, or in Israeli-controlled territories.

(B) A description of specific steps being taken by the United States to encourage foreign countries and international organizations to cease creating such barriers and to dismantle measures already in place, and an assessment of the effectiveness of such steps.

(C) A description of specific steps being taken by the United States to prevent investigations or prosecutions by governments or international organizations of United States persons solely on the basis of such persons doing business with Israel, with Israeli entities, or in Israeli-controlled territories.

(D) Decisions by foreign persons, including corporate entities and state-affiliated financial institutions, that limit or prohibit economic relations with Israel or persons doing business in Israel or in any territory controlled by Israel.

(e) Certain foreign judgments against United States persons.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no domestic court shall recognize or enforce any foreign judgment entered against a United States person that conducts business operations in Israel, or any territory controlled by Israel, if the domestic court determines that the foreign judgment is based, in whole or in part, on a determination by a foreign court that the United States person’s conducting business operations in Israel or any territory controlled by Israel or with Israeli entities constitutes a violation of law.

(f) Definitions.—In this section:

(1) BOYCOTT OF, DIVESTMENT FROM, AND SANCTIONS AGAINST ISRAEL.—The term “boycott of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel” means actions by states, nonmember states of the United Nations, international organizations, or affiliated agencies of international organizations that are politically motivated and are intended to penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations specifically with Israel or persons doing business in Israel or in any territory controlled by Israel.

Clouds of hot dust.  
***  




“Then the dust cloud hits us. Then it got real hot. It felt like it was going to light up almost.” -Thomas Spinard, FDNY Engine 7  

“A wave — a hot, solid, black wave of heat threw me down the block.” – David Handschuh, New York’s Daily News  

“When I was running, some hot stuff went down by back, because I didn’t have time to put my coat back on, and I had some — well, I guess between first and second degree burns on my back.” -Marcel Claes, FDNY Firefighter  

“And then we’re engulfed in the smoke, which was horrendous. One thing I remember, it was hot. The smoke was hot and that scared me” -Paramedic Manuel Delgado “I remember making it into the tunnel and it was this incredible amount of wind, debris, heat….” -Brian Fitzpatrick FDNY Firefighter  

“A huge, huge blast of hot wind gusting and smoke and dust and all kinds of debris hit me” -Firefighter Louis Giaconelli  

“This super-hot wind blew and it just got dark as night and you couldn’t breathe” -Firefighter Todd Heaney / Quotes compiled from Kevin Ryan's blog. “When I get to the rig, about half a block down West Street, the building came down. It is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life.  

At first I look up and I hear a boom and a strange noise. I can't really describe it […] We hold each other, and then we get engulfed in that cloud right away. And we don't know what it is. It is such a weird color, and we don't know if it is going to light up or not. It is very hot.
138 We are in front of 90 West Street, just across the street from the south tower, and we really try to outrun it, but the cloud hits us so fast that we cannot run anymore.” - Battalion Chief Tom Vallebuona, Battalion 21, in Dennis Smith's Report from Ground Zero, Ibid., p. 123.   


“[T]he second building is starting to come apart. […] We run across the street back towards the World Financial Center and get to those big floor-level windows. Luckily for us the glass had been knocked out when the first building came down, so we [were able to] jump into the [lobby] and hide behind a large column just in the interior. But with all the windows out, it is like a large, open garage space. Then, hiding behind this column, my arms crossed like a mummy, I begin to feel the power of all the debris and rubble rushing past. And there is a great deafening noise. It feels like the world is falling apart. If you've ever been at a demolition site, where you hear a building coming down, if you magnify that by a hundred or a thousand, it might have given you a good idea [of the sound]. So I stay pressed against the column, and first I feel a positive wave of energy go by, and then a negative pressure because it is creating a vacuum, and I am hoping that it doesn't suck me out. And then I can't breathe. I try to put my mask on, and then there is a tremendous amount of heat, but it only lasts for a minute before everything goes black.” - Firefighter Phil McArdle, Hazmat Unit 1S in Dennis Smith, Ibid., p. 119.

&gt;4.3. Molybdenum spherule in the USGS data set  


&gt;Two of the authors pursued a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) action with the USGS to obtain any additional SEM/XEDS data from them which had not been previously published. The new data demonstrated, significantly, that the USGS team had observed and studied a molybdenum-rich spherule which was not mentioned in the earlier reports. A micrograph image shows a bright pill-shaped spherule labeled “20MOSPH-1.TIF” (below). The brightness of the object suggests that backscattered electron imaging was used in acquiring the image (the report notes that this technique was used in the study), and that indeed a heavier metal such as Mo is present in the oblong spherule. (We see similar shapes; see SEM image below right and Fig. 1.)    


&gt;In the same data set obtained via FOIA action, an XEDS spectrum labeled “Molysph.TIF” and two nearly identical XEDS curves (with additional elemental identifications) labeled “Molly spectrum 25 kV” accompany what we deduce applies to the Mo spherule, given the designations. One of the spectra extends to approximately 19 keV (the electron beam energy was no doubt 25 kV), and shows a clear Mo line at 17.3 keV. This removes ambiguity regarding the peak at ~2.3 keV, which could otherwise be S or Pb or Bi (for example). The XEDS plots for this spherule labeled “Moly sph” show significant concentrations of aluminum, oxygen and calcium in addition to the dominant molybdenum peak and deserve further investigation. (For example, the Mo/Al peak height ratio is Mo:Al :: 5:1.)  


&gt;We discern that considerable study was performed on this Mo-rich spherule, given the number of images and XEDS plots for it, yet these data were not previously released in the public USGS reports.**[2] We emphasize these data because of the extremely high melting temperature of molybdenum, and the observation of this molybdenum-rich spherule. Molybdenum is a refractory metal known for its extremely high melting point [9]. Mo melts at 2,623 °C (4,753 °F) [10], although addition of other elements may lower the melting point. No explanation of the high temperature needed to form the observed Mo-rich spherule is given in the USGS material (either published or obtained by FOIA action).

5216,"&gt;Elaborate please?  

The good Dr. tells many strange tales and never explains how they happened.  


&gt;One piece Dr. Astaneh-Asl saw was a charred horizontal I-beam from 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper that collapsed from fire eight hours after the attacks. The beam, so named because its cross-section looks like a capital I, had clearly endured searing temperatures. Parts of the flat top of the I, once five-eighths of an inch thick, had vaporized.

&gt;Less clear was whether the beam had been charred after the collapse, as it lay in the pile of burning rubble, or whether it had been engulfed in the fire that led to the building's collapse, which would provide a more telling clue.

&gt;The answer lay in the beam's twisted shape. As weight pushed down, the center portion had buckled outward.

&gt;''This tells me it buckled while it was attached to the column,'' not as it fell, Dr. Astaneh-Asl said, adding, ''It had burned first, then buckled.''

“Then the dust cloud hits us. Then it got real hot. It felt like it was going to light up
almost.” -Thomas Spinard, FDNY Engine 7  

“A wave — a hot, solid, black wave of heat threw me down the block.” – David
Handschuh, New York’s Daily News  

“When I was running, some hot stuff went down by back, because I didn’t have time
to put my coat back on, and I had some — well, I guess between first and second
degree burns on my back.” -Marcel Claes, FDNY Firefighter  

“And then we’re engulfed in the smoke, which was horrendous. One thing I remember,
it was hot. The smoke was hot and that scared me” -Paramedic Manuel Delgado
“I remember making it into the tunnel and it was this incredible amount of wind,
debris, heat….” -Brian Fitzpatrick FDNY Firefighter  

“A huge, huge blast of hot wind gusting and smoke and dust and all kinds of debris hit
me” -Firefighter Louis Giaconelli  

“This super-hot wind blew and it just got dark as night and you couldn’t breathe”
-Firefighter Todd Heaney / Quotes compiled from Kevin Ryan's blog.
“When I get to the rig, about half a block down West Street, the building came down. It
is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life.  


At first I look up and I hear a boom and a strange noise. I can't really describe it
[…] We hold each other, and then we get engulfed in that cloud right away. And we
don't know what it is. It is such a weird color, and we don't know if it is going to light up
or not. It is very hot.  


138
We are in front of 90 West Street, just across the street from the south tower,
and we really try to outrun it, but the cloud hits us so fast that we cannot run anymore.”
- Battalion Chief Tom Vallebuona, Battalion 21, in Dennis Smith's Report from Ground
Zero, Ibid., p. 123.  

“[T]he second building is starting to come apart. […]
We run across the street back towards the World Financial Center and get to
those big floor-level windows. Luckily for us the glass had been knocked out when the
first building came down, so we [were able to] jump into the [lobby] and hide behind a
large column just in the interior. But with all the windows out, it is like a large, open
garage space. Then, hiding behind this column, my arms crossed like a mummy, I
begin to feel the power of all the debris and rubble rushing past. And there is a great
deafening noise. It feels like the world is falling apart. If you've ever been at a
demolition site, where you hear a building coming down, if you magnify that by a
hundred or a thousand, it might have given you a good idea [of the sound].
So I stay pressed against the column, and first I feel a positive wave of energy
go by, and then a negative pressure because it is creating a vacuum, and I am hoping
that it doesn't suck me out. And then I can't breathe. I try to put my mask on, and then
there is a tremendous amount of heat, but it only lasts for a minute before everything
goes black.”

&gt;NIST’s findings do not support the “pancake theory” of collapse, which is premised on a progressive failure of the floor systems in the WTC towers (the composite floor system—that connected the core columns and the perimeter columns—consisted of a grid of steel “trusses” integrated with a concrete slab; see diagram).   


&gt;Instead, the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards. Thus, the floors did not fail progressively to cause a pancaking phenomenon.

FEMA Report 1.5.2 Unusual Building Loads 



&gt;The additional qualifiers is that they assumed a 707 without full fuel and it be accidental.  
Obvious lie   

That the WTC was designed only to withstand a collision with a Boeing 707 that was seeking to land at a nearby airport, and therefore low on fuel, is an obvious lie. Why is it an obvious lie? Well, because if you take into consideration planes that are landing at an airport, then you must consider planes that are taking off, and such planes are fully laden with fuel.  


&gt;Which was not properly installed in the first place and was past expiration in the second place.

1.2  Legal Considerations  


&gt;If there is no evidence to support charges of complicity by U.S. government officials, than no legal action will be taken except for the continued execution of U.S. Executive and military policies that are currently underway.  If evidence is found to be sufficient to only support the “Accomplice Theory”, then no legal action will be taken until a suspect for the crimes on 9/11 is apprehended and brought to trial.  Then, the U.S. officials suspected of being an accomplice to the prime suspect should be tried together for the same offenses.  If however, evidence is found to be sufficient to support the “Conspiracy Theory”, then the U.S. officials suspected of being apart of a conspiracy to commit the crimes on 9/11 should be tried together for the same offenses.

 &gt;The following subsections describe the legal matters that must be considered in regards to prosecuting individuals for the crimes committed on September 11, 2001.  First, a description of the applicable charges is presented.  This is followed by legal arguments that have been made regarding immunity from prosecution for the Executive branch of government.  Next, pre-trial procedures for such crimes are explained.  Then, the procedures that could be expected to be followed during a trial are described.  Finally, the possible ramifications resulting from the conviction of government leaders are presented.

RJ Lee also found evidence for the evaporation of lead, requiring a temperature of 3164ºF.

▪ A USGS study found a molybdenum-rich spherule. Melting would require a temperature of 4753ºF.

▪ These temperatures require the presence of other processes besides jet fuel and office furnishings.

▪ Molten iron/steel poured from the north face of the South Tower in the minutes leading up to its collapse. Attempts to characterize this as molten aluminum are not credible because aluminum is silvery in daylight at its melting temperature.

This flow of molten metal is yellow-orange, characteristic of molten iron. There appears to be an ongoing reaction in the flow because it flares up a number of times as it falls.

▪ There is abundant eyewitness testimony of molten iron in the rubble pile by first responders and others. Some firemen described it like being in a foundry.

[Our most solid evidence for the use of explosives in the destruction of the World Trade Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20160215153523/http://www.htmlpublish.com/newTestDocStorage/DocStorage/f0fc1f40fde84171a68c8612d5931980/Thesis-Outline.htm)  

Evidence of thermitic reactions during the WTC destruction

▪ The iron spheres found in the dust are not consistent with droplets of molten structural steel. They lack the other elements found in steel. They are, however, typical of byproducts of thermitic reactions.

▪ Ordinary thermite burns at about 4500ºF, limited by the boiling point of aluminum. There are other variants of thermite including thermate (with the addition of sulfur) and ""superthermite"" or ""nano-thermite"" which involves much finer association of sub- micron size particles of aluminum and iron oxide. Nanothermite is a military grade material produced at the national laboratories, not available on the open market.

▪ The fact that molten iron was produced during the WTC destruction requires temperatures out of reach of ordinary fires, but explainable by the presence of thermite.

▪ Iron spheres are a normal byproduct of the thermitic reaction, the iron coming from the iron component of thermite itself. The reaction proceeds violently and sprays iron droplets which condense before hitting the ground, producing spheres. The composition of the spheres from the WTC dust is consistent with this source, and there is no other reasonable source.

▪ The dust contains red-grey chips (a red layer backed by a grey layer). The red layer has been tested and identified as an unreacted highly energetic thermitic nanocomposite (or nanothermite).

• Typical thermite consists of powdered iron oxide in close association with powdered aluminum. At the ignition temperature, the oxygen is liberated from the iron oxide and captured by the aluminum in a stronly exothermic reaction producing very high temperatures. The primary byproducts are molten (typically splattered) iron droplets and aluminum oxide which is seen as white smoke.

◦ Smaller grain size exposes greater surface area and allows the reaction to go faster. Nanothermite refers to the extremely small size of the reactant particles: 1000 nanometers (nm) = 1 micron. A micron is a millionth of a meter. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.

• The red-grey chips are a composite material that contains metalic aluminum in the form of platelets about 40 nanometers thick and iron oxide grains about 100

nanometers across intimately mixed and embedded in an organic polymer matrix.

• Ordinary thermite is considered an incendiary, something which produces extremely high temperatures. Nanothermite releases its energy much more quickly due to the size of the particles. However, to become an explosive it needs a rapidly expanding gas that can create a shock wave. The red polymer could have this effect.

• The red-grey chips undergo a highly exothermic reaction at a lower trigger temperature than ordinary thermite and gives off energy comparable to published data for known nanothermite.

• They are observed to produce iron spheres as a byproduct, proving that it achieves a temperature high enough to melt iron.

• The assertion that these are merely paint chips does not take the highly energetic behavior of the material into account.

• The assertion that thermitic behavior in the rubble pile was due to the presence of aluminum from the plane and rust from the building components is a frivolous and disingenuous suggestion. It is precisely the small scale of the components that gives thermite its characteristics, and which motivates the design of nanothermite to further enhance the reaction. Furthermore, the accidental coming together of aluminum and iron oxide cannot account for the presence of highly engineered red- grey chips in the dust.

▪ The presence of energetic material is displayed during the actual destruction of the Twin Towers in the behavior of the streams of material that are thrown out.

• Projectiles can be observed fragmenting midair

• Many of the surfaces of the ejected beams trail voluminous white smoke consistent with aluminum oxide, a byproduct of thermitic reactions.

• Some of these projectiles change direction or accelerate mid air, and the smoke trails take sharp turns following them, confirming that the smoke is being emitted from the projectiles rather than simply being entrained in its wake.

1.2  Legal Considerations  


&gt;If there is no evidence to support charges of complicity by U.S. government officials, than no legal action will be taken except for the continued execution of U.S. Executive and military policies that are currently underway.  If evidence is found to be sufficient to only support the “Accomplice Theory”, then no legal action will be taken until a suspect for the crimes on 9/11 is apprehended and brought to trial.  Then, the U.S. officials suspected of being an accomplice to the prime suspect should be tried together for the same offenses.  If however, evidence is found to be sufficient to support the “Conspiracy Theory”, then the U.S. officials suspected of being apart of a conspiracy to commit the crimes on 9/11 should be tried together for the same offenses.

 &gt;The following subsections describe the legal matters that must be considered in regards to prosecuting individuals for the crimes committed on September 11, 2001.  First, a description of the applicable charges is presented.  This is followed by legal arguments that have been made regarding immunity from prosecution for the Executive branch of government.  Next, pre-trial procedures for such crimes are explained.  Then, the procedures that could be expected to be followed during a trial are described.  Finally, the possible ramifications resulting from the conviction of government leaders are presented.

5297,"&gt;Of all the reasons to suspect that the hijackings were allowed to occur, nobody is going to be on board with seriously looking at any no-hijackers theory.   

Who boarded the planes is a long way from a no-hijacker theory. 


Chapter 2 from the book ""*Hijacking America’s Mind on 9/11*"" by Elias Davidsson  

[Shattering the myth of 19 Muslim hijackers](http://aldeilis.net/english/no-evidence-that-muslims-hijacked-planes-on-911/)

&gt;6.Conclusions

The United States government, through its agencies and particularly the FBI, confiscated immediately after the events all available documentation regarding the boarding of the aircraft.Dozens of witnesses from the airlines and the respective airports were interviewed by the FBI.All existing evidence regarding the boarding of the four 9/11 flights must therefore be in the hands of the US authorities.

A government what was innocent of mass-murder would be expected not only to seek the truth about this crime, but show particular zeal in doing so, including by presenting the most incriminating evidence it possesses. It would do so both to satisfy a legitimate expectation of its population (and in the case of 9/11 of the world community) and to dispel any existing suspicions of its own complicity.

On the base of evidence provided in this chapter, the following inescapable and unassailable conclusions impose themselves:

• Due to the lack of concrete and verifiable evidence that the 19 alleged hijackers boarded the four aircraft, it is unconscionable and slanderous to accuse these individuals of participation in the mass-murder. Such accusations constitute a grievous attack on their dignity and that of their families.

• By consistently refusing to confirm through authenticated documents that the 19 alleged hijackers had boarded the four aircraft, the US government manifests its bad faith and justifies charges that it is lying to its population and to the international community about the events of 9/11.

• By providing me with a deceptive reply regarding the passenger lists (see above), the FBI manifested its attempt to conceal their absence.

• By ignoring the numerous and glaring contradictions regarding the identities of the alleged hijackers, the 9/11 Commission manifested its intent to maintain the official myth of 19 Muslim terrorists.

• By refusing to allow interviews with personnel who were responsible for passengers boarding the four aircraft of 9/11130, the airlines manifested their intent to conceal evidence about the circumstances of the aircraft boarding.

From the FEMA Report:

&gt;A.3.1.3 Response of High-rise, Steel-frame Buildings in Previous Fire Incidents:

&gt;In recent years, three notable fires have occurred in steel frame buildings, though none involved the total floor area as in WTC 1 and WTC 2. However, prior to September 11, 2001, no protected steel frame buildings had been known to collapse due to fire. These previous three fire incidents include the following:


    &gt;[1st Interstate Bank Building, Los Angeles 1st Interstate Bank Building, Los Angeles, May 4-5, 1988] 

    &gt;[Broadgate Phase 8, UK Broadgate Phase 8, UK, 1990] 

    &gt;[One Meridian Plaza, Philadelphia One Meridian Plaza, Philadelphia, February 23-24, 1991] 


&gt;In the case of the fire at One Meridian Plaza, the fire burned uncontrolled for the first 11 hours and lasted 19 hours. Contents from nine floors were completely consumed in the fire. In addition to these experiences in fire incidents, as a result of the Broadgate fire, British Steel and the Building Research Establishment performed a series of six experiments at Cardington in the mid-1990s to investigate the behavior of steel frame buildings. These experiments were conducted in a simulated, eight-story building. Secondary steel beams were not protected. Despite the temperature of the steel beam reaching 800-900 degrees Centigrade (1,500-1,700 degrees Fahrenheit) in three tests (well above the traditionally assumed critical temperature of 600 degrees Centigrade [1,100 degrees Fahrenheit]), no collapse was observed in any of the six experiments.

&gt;One important aspect of these previous incidents is that the columns remained intact and sustained their load carrying ability throughout the fire incidents (though there was no structural damage caused by impacts). Throughout the fire in One Meridian Plaza, horizontal forces were exerted on the columns by the girders and despite the 24 to 36-inch deflections of the girders, floor beams, and concrete and steel deck floor slabs, the columns continued to stabilize the building throughout the fire and for several years after the fire.

&gt;Dear Mr. McAuliff:

&gt;iATL received two samples on August 8, 2011. One sample was a paper white number 10 business envelope that contained grey dust/debris that was logged in as 4389292/Batch 249141. Another sample was a swatch (~4”x6”) of dark tightly woven material that was covered with a thin irregular coating of grey dust. This second sample also had additional grey dust loose in the bag that held the swatch. The second sample was logged in as 4389293/Batch 249142. The samples were secured in large 1 gallon 3mil poly zip lock bags that were transferred to the laboratory with an overnight courier... 

&gt;Analysis:

&gt;Each sample was tested using several analytical techniques. These included pH, Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM), Analytical Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Electron Diffraction (SAED), and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS). The results are summarized below. Additional analytical reports, documentation, and references are also attached.
*** 

&gt;Results:

&gt;The pH of the sample dust ranged between 9.6 and 10.2.

&gt;The PLM analysis revealed a mixture of many components all very fine (&lt;1mm). The non-fibrous constituents (~50%) include polystyrene foam, vermiculite mineral, combustion product (carbon soot), mineral dust of gypsum, calcite, dolomite, and quartz. The fibrous fraction (~50%) included cellulose (wood and paper fragments), fibrous glass such as glass wool with yellow resin coating, FiberglassTM, colorless mineral wool, refractory ceramic fibers, limestone, calcites, carbon fibers, synthetics (including fragments of cloth), and chrysotile asbestos associated with the lime and carbonate insulation debris.

&gt;The TEM analysis paralleled the light microscope results with additional chemical signatures of silicates, kaolin- clays, pigments (TiO2), calcites, dolomites, carbonates, metal complexes (sub-micron chromium, aluminum/iron matrices), and chrysotile asbestos.

&gt;The AAS analysis results for lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), and Zinc (Zn) note the following concentrations….

&gt;After Dennis Kucinich refused to sell Muni Light, Cleveland's publicly owned electric utility, the Cleveland mafia put out a hit on Kucinich. A hit man from Maryland planned to shoot him in the head during the Columbus Day Parade, but the plot fell apart when Kucinich was hospitalized and missed the event. When the city fell into default shortly thereafter, the mafia leaders called off the contract killer.


&gt;Specifically, it was the Cleveland Trust Company that suddenly required all of the city's debts be paid in full, which forced the city into default, after news of Kucinich's refusal to sell the city utility. For years, these debts were routinely rolled over, pending future payment, until Kucinich's announcement was made public. In 1998 the Cleveland City Council honored him for having had the ""courage and foresight"" to stand up to the banks, which saved the city an estimated $195 million between 1985 and 1995.

Keep in mind, if the data all showed 1's, meaning door open, we can definitively say the data is erroneous, as there is no way the cockpit door would be open for 40 hours of passenger service at American Airlines. And if logic has any value, this would be the bit value recorded if the FLIGHT DECK DOOR parameter wasn't hooked up to the system so when a tech reviews the data, he can readily admit its not valid.

But the fact is the data shows all 0's for the last flight and verified by P4T. This means the door was closed for that flight and the hijacking impossible BASED ON THE DATA.

Why was Kurt Sonnenfeld following this guy around in1987?? wtf


&gt;My apartment on Thompson St. was searched about a fortnight after I moved there. My girlfriend had a shop a few doors down. She became alert to the fact that we were being followed for a period of two years thereafter. Occasionally, she would ask: ""Who's that guy?"" - ""Who are those two guys following us?"" They were the same two photographers, ""assigned to supervise the clean-up operation for FEMA"",-Jim Chestnutt and Kurt Sonnenfeld. (photos provided.) As my proteges in Denver will attest, they were completely incongruous in promoting themselves as a professional ""photo-assistants"" to various friends of mine at the time.

&gt;This pair did not go unnoticed by David Zinser's landlord and neighbor, Frank Ponte. Both he and 'Doc' provided their assurances for my safety, and I soon believed it was entertaining 'to be tailed' in this way. (Doc's got a PhD in spy novels.) About two years later, I made a scheduled visit to see my friend Haidar's Studio, on Sunset Boulevard, in LA. Later that week, we received a visit from these two, again offering their ""professional assistant services."" -This time, I directly confronted the pair, and I said, ""You two guys look familiar."" With this, Kurt said, ""I'll wait in the car,"" and he left without looking back.

Airplanes manufactured before October 11, 1991, with an FDAU or DFDAU as of July 16, 1996.
Airplanes manufactured after October 11, 1991, after August 18, 2000, and after August 18, 2002.

AIRPLANES MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO OCTOBER 11, 1991, WITHOUT AN FDAU OR DFDAU INSTALLED AS OF JULY 16, 1996.
The new rule requires that by August 18, 2001 the FDR record at least 18 parameter groups. For most airplanes, this is an increase from 11 parameter groups, as described in ""Effects of 1989 FAA Flight Data Recorder Rule Change"" on page 32. 

The new rule requires that by four years from date of rule at least 22 parameter groups be recorded by the FDR. In this group are Boeing models 727, 737, 747, 757, 767, DC-10, and MD-80.

Flight 77 = N644AA 2460 

Certificate Issue Date	05/08/1991

http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NN...Numbertxt=644AA

N644AA = AIRPLANES MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO OCTOBER 11, 1991

So N644AA has been updated before August 18, 2001

5447," &gt;The truth is, studies that best adhere to scientific research methods find that cameras are actually associated with an increase in crashes and injuries.  

&gt;Research from the University of Tennessee shows the cameras are used to generate revenue. 

&gt;Have you ever received a traffic camera ticket? It comes on an “official letter” from the city. However, it’s actually not the city. It’s RedFlex or ATS using the city’s letterhead.   


&gt;In a single year, Gallatin and Murfreesboro collected more than $1.4 Million in traffic camera fines. The cities sent almost $1.1 Million of that money out of state and country to pay ATS and RedFlex.  

Selling out the state and citizens appears to be the intent.  Mind boggling

&gt;Tennessee officials were likely involved in accepting bribes to install cameras across the state.

&gt;Perhaps the largest untapped source of information about events leading up to 9/11 is the raw intelligence files about al Qaeda and terrorist threats gathered by the eavesdropping National Security Agency.  


&gt;In his 2008 book “The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation,” former New York Times reporter Philip Shenon said Commission investigators neglected to examine that “gold mine” of NSA 9/11 data until days before the commission’s final report was due.  


&gt;Found in that limited time, and noted in the commission’s report, was “strong evidence that Iran facilitated the transit of al-Qaeda members into and out of Afghanistan before 9/11, and that some of these were future 9/11 hijackers…We believe this topic requires future investigation by the U.S. government.”

&gt;You should do some research into how reliable eyewitness testimony is.  

Thanks for the suggestion. I did and the author (Graeme MacQueen) did as well. 




&gt;But first let me raise one of the commonest objections I confront when presenting this material. Eyewitness evidence, say the objectors, is “soft,” untrustworthy, unreliable. According to such critics it does not matter how many eyewitnesses there are to an event or who these eyewitnesses are or how their accounts relate to each other: the best plan is just to dismiss everything they say. This is an odd view. I do not find support for it either in social scientific studies of eyewitness testimony or in the scholarly literature on criminal investigation.   

[1] Eyewitness evidence certainly has its vulnerabilities: we know that eyewitnesses can misperceive, misremember and deceive. But, as with other kinds of evidence, we have developed ways of checking to see if what the witnesses report is accurate. For example, we look for corroborating evidence—further eyewitness evidence as well as evidence of entirely different kinds.  



&gt;Is eyewitness evidence relevant to the investigation of explosions? The National Fire Protection Association’s manual on fire and explosion investigations states clearly that in an explosion investigation, “the investigator should take into consideration all the available information, including witness statements.” [2]  



&gt;In any case, my paper has been written largely as a critique of the handling of eyewitness evidence of explosions by the 9/11 Commission and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Both of these organizations make extensive use of eyewitness evidence and evidently consider it valid and important. When I disagree with NIST and the 9/11 Commission on eyewitness testimony, therefore, I do so not at the level of principle but at the level of application.

5474,"&gt;Further, the transcribed oral histories of First Responders that were recorded in the days and weeks following 9/11 indicate strongly that debris from loaded commercial jets was in plain view in the area surrounding the towers; 


&gt;Christopher Attanasio (EMT): ""...we took 2nd Avenue all the way down. Upon arrival, towers one and two were both ablaze. The second plane had hit the second tower already. Both towers were totally engulfed. People were jumping out of the buildings. There was airplane fuselage and landing gear around the site. Body parts, victims' remains on the floor. There were some injuries on the street. Some cars were on fire.""

&gt;John Breen (FDNY): ""We did see part of -- I didn't see it, but Jeff Johnson told me later on he did see part of the landing gear actually fell right through the roof and it was in one of the Jacuzzis in another room.""

&gt;Michael Cain (FDNY): ""We parked on West Street and I guess about Albany, West Street and Albany, got out of the car and started going up West Street and there were body parts in the street. The plane wheel was in the street.""

&gt;Richard Carletti (FDNY): ""When we passed 10 and 10, there's a bridge that runs I guess into one of the buildings directly south of Trade Center No. 2. There's a pedestrian walkway. As we passed that, we came into the debris field. It was jet parts and body parts.""

&gt;Manuel Delgado (EMS): ""An explosion goes off. [Actually, this was the second plane impact. -rep] I immediately tell everyone to get out of the car and hide somewhere, go underneath something. It's interesting because, as we were there, there was a police car, I guess, on Vesey, on the corner there, and some debris comes down from whatever this explosion was, at the time we really didn't know, and it just crushes it, I mean, crushes the top front of the police car, which really scared me at that point.

    Q. Could you tell if it was airplane parts?

    A. It looked like an airplane part afterward, yes, it did. It looked like part of an engine. It was pretty big. It was probably the size of the hood because it kind of hit it, bounced, and then rolled off.""

&gt;Michael Donovan (FDNY): ""We heard the plane briefly, the earth shook, the buildings shook, a tremendous fireball overhead. I thought there was a bomb or an explosion. A tremendous fireball, flaming debris, pieces of the airplane, fuselage, landing gear, pieces of the building.""

&gt;Thomas Fiztpatrick (FDNY): ""I figured, as long as we didn't get hit by the plane, we were ahead of the game. The next thing I was worried about was getting hit by the parts. Various pieces of the plane were falling on the street. As we went down the street you could see parts of aircraft with stencil numbers on it and things like that. There was a wheel, or like a wheel housing or something else there in the street.""

&gt;Ray Goldbach (FDNY): ""The four of us got out of the car, we started to cross Broadway, and the second plane went into the other tower. I don't know what time it was, but Tom McDonald yelled something like holy shit, oh, fuck. He hit the ground out on the street. We all got up. We kept walking. I believe we went down - I don't know whether it was Dey or Cortlandt Street. We walked down that block. It was littered with airplane parts, pieces of the building.""

&gt;Steve Grabher (FDNY): ""...by the time we got near 2 World Trade Center people were jumping off the roof like crazy. Landing near the hotel and the street was littered with body parts. I don't know if it was from the plane or what. But there was just body parts all over the place. Chunks of meat. I saw an airplane tire. I walked past an airplane tire. What looked like an airplane tire.""

    Stephen Gregory (FDNY): ""I saw airplane parts on West Street.

    Q. How did you know they were airplane parts?

    A. It looked like pieces of a plane, skin of a plane. I mean, they weren't really discernible. I couldn't say this was this part of a plane or that was that part. Just knowing a plane had hit the building and I looked and I saw it looked like the skin off a wing or a fuselage or wherever it came from.

    Q. Clearly not building material?

    A. No. The building material was sort of gray and you could see it, you know, how it differed from the plane.""

&gt;Michael Guttenberg (Office of Medical Affairs): ""The other thing that was actually evident, though, is what appeared to be some plane parts, like some circular pieces of a plane, and lots of shoes. I don't know if that was women jumping out of their – jumping out of their heels to run, but there were -- just impressed me there were no -- you know, there were no injuries on the street at that point, but there was lots of shoes all over the place and plane parts. It was the same thing in both directions.""

&gt;Michael Hazel (FDNY): ""We just passed a compact car where the engine was running and the door was open, which looked to me like the driver had escaped, but from the back seat to the trunk was crushed by a jet engine.""

&gt;Todd Heaney (FDNY): ""THERE WERE PEOPLE DEAD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE DONT KNOW IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT WHAT DID YOU DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY IT WHATEVER YOU SAW YOU KNOW THEY THE PEOPLE WERE JUST EVERYWHERE SAW SOME LUGGAGE FROM THE PLANE""

&gt;Stephen Hess (EMS): ""...our initial response was seeing body parts and airplane parts all over the west side. Just traumatic to see.""

&gt;Paul Hyland (FDNY): ""We were coming across and we walked down. We had to go down to the command center. We carried all our tools, the bottles, everything, and as we're walking down, part of the plane engine was sitting right in the street, still burning. I said, look, this is the plane.""

&gt;Robert Kimball (EMS): ""Like I remember walking by with the chief, and I remember seeing the airplane engine, you know, pieces of, you know, obviously trade center all over.""

&gt;John Lynn (FDNY): ""I parked soon thereafter on West Street, geared up and walked along West Street, where I noticed landing gear and the evidence of some kind of explosion.""

&gt;Orlando Martinez (EMS): ""Once we started taking off, I guess 30 feet in front of us, there was a lady on the ground by the curb and she was just waving her arms. That's all she could wave. Her legs were crushed. Apparently she got hit by part of the landing gear, one of the tires of the airplane. There was a large tire next to her. The person who was next to her, I guess worked with her, said something hit her. It may have been the landing gear. It was a large piece of metal that was so sharp it slit her whole back open, buttocks. Her legs were exposed, bones. We boarded her as fast as we could. There was nowhere to grab her. She was too slippery, so I grabbed the hip bone. That was exposed. We just kind of picked her up, put her on the long board and we strapped her up, put her on the stretcher and took as much flesh as we could. It was just hanging all over the place, put it between her legs. Put her in the ambulance and rushed her to Beekman.""",2015-12-31 15:00:53+00:00,cyhbf6t,1.0,t3_3yx00t,70.0,911truth

Best quote:  
&gt;The events of the past two years

police culture is dysfunctional and   
in need of a democratic reformation.  


***  


&gt;...As former New York Police Department Commissioner **Howard Safir told Fox News in May, “Similar to athletes on the playing field, sometimes it's difficult to tune out the boos from the no-talents sipping their drinks, sitting comfortably in their seats. It's demoralizing to read about the misguided anti-cop gibberish spewing from those who take their freedoms for granted.”**  


&gt;The disdain in such imagery, increasingly common in the world of policing, is striking. It smacks of a police-state, bunker mentality that sees democratic values and just about any limits on the power of law enforcement as threats. **In other words, the Safirs want the public -- particularly in communities of color and poor neighborhoods -- to shut up and do as it’s told when a police officer says so. If the cops give the orders, compliance -- so this line of thinking goes -- isn’t optional, no matter how egregious the misconduct or how sensible the reforms. Obey or else.**

&gt;The 110-story towers of the World Trade Center were designed to withstand as a whole the forces caused by a horizontal impact of a large commercial aircraft (Appendix I). So why did a total collapse occur? The cause was the dynamic consequence of the prolonged heating of the steel columns to very high temperature.  

&gt;A 1964 3-page white paper by John Skilling, one of the towers' structural engineers, states: ""The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 7007-DC8) traveling at 600 miles per hour... ...such collision would result in only local damage and could not cause collapse..."" :: NIST NCSTAR 1-2, Appendix A (pp. 306 ff)
""Richard Roth of the architectural firm of Emery Roth &amp; Sons, issued the statement defending the safety of the twin towers, which the firm, in association with Minoru Yamasaki, designed for the center. Mr. Roth said that a structural analysis by the firm of Worthington, Skilling, Helle &amp; Jackson had found that if a tower were hit by an airliner at 600 miles an hour, the damage to the tower would be only local and its occupants outside the immediate area of impact would not be endangered."" :: New York Times, February 15th, 1964

&gt;In 1965, real estate baron Lawrence Wien charged that the design of the Twins is structurally unsound. Richard Roth fired back with a 3-page telegram:

&gt;THE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT BY THE FIRM OF WORTHINGTON, SKILLING, HELLE &amp; JACKSON IS THE MOST COMPLETE AND DETAILED OF ANY EVER MADE FOR ANY BUILDING STRUCTURE. THE PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS ALONE COVER 1,200 PAGES AND INVOLVE OVER 100 DETAILED DRAWINGS.

**BECAUSE OF ITS CONFIGURATION, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THAT OF A STEEL BEAM 209' DEEP, THE TOWERS ARE ACTUALLY FAR LESS DARING STRUCTURALLY THAN A CONVENTIONAL BUILDING SUCH AS THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING WHERE THE SPINE OR BRACED AREA OF THE BUILDING IS FAR SMALLER IN RELATION TO ITS HEIGHT.**  


&gt;THE BUILDING AS DESIGNED IS SIXTEEN TIMES STIFFER THAN A CONVENTIONAL STRUCTURE. THE DESIGN CONCEPT IS SO SOUND THAT THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE IN HIS DESIGN WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE ECONOMICS OF THE STRUCTURE. :: City in the Sky, Times Books, Henry Hold and Company, LLC, 2003, pp. 134 ff (as quoted on 911research.wtc7.net)   


&gt;Structural engineer Charlie Thornton in 1988 said that a fully loaded 747 — a three hundred ton element — crashing into a building that has been designed to carry thirteen thousand tons would probably not do anything to the major building. It could affect localized structural elements, knock out a column, and there could be some damage, but as far as a plane knocking a building over of that type, that would not happen. :: video

&gt;John Skilling: ""Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed. The building structure would still be there. However, I'm not saying that properly applied explosives — shaped explosives — of that magnitude could not do a tremendous amount of damage. I would imagine that if you took the top expert in that type of work and gave him the assignment of bringing these buildings down with explosives, I would bet that he could do it."" :: Seattle Times, February 27, 1993

&gt;The towers' construction manager, Frank deMartini, explained in January 2001 that the building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it and that the building could probably sustain multiple impacts because the structure is like the mosquito netting on a screen door — an intense grid, and the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting, really doing nothing. :: video

Title:   7 World Trade Center    

Sponsors:   Daniel Barnum, FAIA and Fifty Members of the Institute  

Intent:   To cause the AIA to adopt a Position Statement in support of a new investigation into the complete collapse of 7 World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.  


&gt;...NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the AIA Board of Directors shall adopt a Position Statement, to be published in the AIA Directory of Public Policies and Position Statements, stating:  

*The AIA’s belief that incidents involving the catastrophic failure of buildings and other structures must be investigated using the highest standards of science- based investigation and analysis in order to provide accurate and meaningful information in the development of model building codes;

*The AIA’s recognition that many members of the architecture profession believe the NIST investigation into the complete collapse of 7 World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, did not adhere to the principles of the scientific method and, as a result, the conclusions of the NIST investigation are fatally flawed;*  

*The AIA’s belief that this perspective merits further study; and*  

*The AIA’s support for a new investigation into the complete collapse of 7 World Trade Center.  

***  
What's interesting is AIA's silence on the NIST building 7 Report and further lack of intellectual curiosity on adopting a position statement on building 7. 
Do they not want to address the issue at all?   

But not all is lost as this is movement to eventually gain enough signatures. Fifty now and no doubt more next year.

5552,"&gt;not that the beams needed to melt in order for the tower to fall!!  

Sticking with the available evidence we understand ""jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams"" is spot on. 


&gt;One piece Dr. Astaneh-Asl saw was a charred horizontal I-beam from 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper that collapsed from fire eight hours after the attacks. The beam, so named because its cross-section looks like a capital I, had clearly endured searing temperatures. **Parts of the flat top of the I, once five-eighths of an inch thick, had vaporized.**  


&gt;**Less clear was whether the beam had been charred after the collapse, as it lay in the pile of burning rubble, or whether it had been engulfed in the fire that led to the building's collapse,** which would provide a more telling clue.  
  


&gt;The answer lay in the beam's twisted shape. As weight pushed down, the center portion had buckled outward. ''This tells me it buckled while it was attached to the column,'' not as it fell, **Dr. Astaneh-Asl said, adding, ''It had burned first, then buckled.''**

&gt;Modified Explosives  


&gt;Defined as explosive formulations with higher energy density than traditional explosives (such as TNT, RDX, and HMX). Unlike traditional explosives, the reaction rate of these materials depends on the initiation stimulus, which also enables control of energy release rate.
EMPI designs, fabricates, and tests several modified explosive formulations. Examples include: APEX (aluminum perfluoropolyether explosive), APEX Hybrids, and RMBX (Reactive Multiphase Blast).    

&gt;Nano-Energetics  


&gt;We have an extensive engineering database for novel nano-composites.  For example, nano-thermites and nano-explosives with discrete metal fuel and oxidizer particles in the 100 nm or less size range. These compositions react and liberate energy by a rapid combustion process and classified as a special class of pyrotechnics or low explosives.


&gt;The small particles enable improved mixing and reduced diffusion lengths for fast reaction rates.  Many variables such as composition, morphology, and processing can be customized for specific application control.

It was the interesting details that got me.  


&gt;All major roadways in and out of New York were to be destroyed on 9/11.  It was these teams, brought in from Israel that included the Mohammed Atta group, confirmed as directly tied to both the CIA and Egyptian intelligence, that were under surveillance by a combined task force that coordinated with local law enforcement.

&gt;So, when thousands of pounds of explosives were placed inside the cable anchorage, teams were dispatched to disable these devices as soon as the attack at the World Trade Center began.  


&gt;Both the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels were to be demolished.  We have only one arrest confirmation from the Manhattan side.  NYPD roadblocks at the Lincoln Tunnel chased down a van that did a quick turn-around to avoid arrest.  Two suspects were arrested with weapons and a truck filled with explosives.  Police commissioner Bernie Kerik, recently released from prison, was on the scene with his personal Counter Terrorism Squad to take custody.  They were never seen since.  


&gt;The “dancer/art student” groups had a variety of tasks on 9/11, among them:

&gt;Planting jammers on buildings on exhibit one to block Port Authority dispatchers and first responder radios

&gt;Plant explosives on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge where the cables are anchored, in order to collapse the bridge  

&gt;• Explode a truck in the Lincoln Tunnel   

&gt;• Explode a truck in the Holland Tunnel    

&gt;• Park trucks with demolition devices in specific parking areas of the twin towers  

&gt;• Coordinate with Mohammed Atta and his group  


&gt;*Of the 3 jammers locations shown below, two of those planted were recovered by the FCC and are held in evidence in Houston, Texas awaiting the “waiting until hell freezes over” Grand Jury to reconvene on Able Danger and 9/11.*  
  

Never heard of this 'jammer"" and would like to know if it can be confirmed.

&gt;NEW YORK, Dec. 19, 2001

&gt;(CBS) Firefighters have extinguished almost all but the last remnants of underground fires that have burned at the World Trade Center site for more than three months since the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.

&gt;""Just in the last week the fires have actually been put out,"" Gov. George Pataki told a group of about 50 upstate elected officials during a tour of the disaster site on Wednesday.

&gt;Battalion Chief Brian Dixon confirmed later Wednesday that the main bodies of fire have been extinguished, although he said small pockets or ""hot spots"" are still being discovered.

&gt;""The FDNY has made great progress in putting out the fires at the World Trade Center,"" Dixon said.

&gt;**But Dixon noted a firetruck remains on standby at the site, and the department considers it an active fire scene.**

5733,"&gt;So, the existence of the molybdenum spherule is evidence of a previously molten state, as with the iron and aluminosilicates also mentioned in the paper. At around 2,610 to 2,623 ºC (4,753 ºF), molybdenum has one of the highest melting points of all pure elements, although the addition of other elements would lower it. Molybdenum is used to improve the strength of steels at high temperatures, and was included in some of the pressure vessel steels A 302, A 533, A542, and A514-65. (See page 17 or ""43 of 86"" from NIST NCSTAR 1-3A, their report on structural steel specifications.)

&gt;Molybdenum was also specified in some of the Japanese steel such as WEL-TEN 80, and is a possible extra in JIS G3114-73. Japanese steel was used to fabricate the perimeter columns and spandrels.

&gt;Yawata Iron and Steel Co. supplied most of the steel to PC&amp;F for the perimeter columns and spandrels. In general, the exterior (or web) and side (or flange) plates of each column and the spandrels were fabricated from Japanese steel, and the interior web plate was fabricated from domestic steel. Source (same link as previous, see page 22 or ""48 of 86"")

&gt;In the WTC2 fire zone of floors 77-83, some 11.5% of the perimeter column steel was rated at 100 ksi yield strength. [See NIST Appendix E, June 04, Table E-4.] Yawata Iron and Steel Co. (now Nippon Steel) shipped 46,000 metric tons of WEL-TEN 60, 60R, 62, 70 and 80 to PC&amp;F (Pacific Car and Foundry). The WEL-TEN 80 is rated at 100 ksi, so the source of the molten molybdenum may well have been 100 ksi perimeter columns.

&gt;An office compartment fire could not have melted any steel members, much less molybdenum.   

&gt;...installed iron(III) oxide-based thermate in the hollow perimeter columns so as to simulate a top-down collapse induced by ""impact and fire damage"", the thermate's ability to generate temperatures of 2,500 ºC (4,532 ºF) would have been capable of melting some molybdenum alloyed with iron and other elements.",2015-10-25 15:00:25+00:00,cwc78qf,1.0,t3_3q58en,6702.0,conspiracy

[World Trade Center Molybdenum spherule in the USGS data set](http://imgur.com/G1S1tHg)  

**Extremely high temperatures during the World Trade Center destruction**  
*Steven E. Jones1 , Jeffrey Farrer2, Gregory S. Jenkins3, Frank Legge4, James Gourley, Kevin Ryan, Daniel Farnsworth, and Crockett Grabbe5.*  


&gt;**4.3. [Molybdenum spherule in the USGS data set](http://www.takeourworldback.com/short/cache/WTCHighTemps.htm)**  


&gt;Two of the authors pursued a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) action with the USGS to obtain any additional SEM/XEDS data from them which had not been previously published. The new data demonstrated, significantly, that the USGS team had observed and studied a molybdenum-rich spherule which was not mentioned in the earlier reports. A micrograph image shows a bright pill-shaped spherule labeled “20MOSPH-1.TIF” (below). The brightness of the object suggests that backscattered electron imaging was used in acquiring the image (the report notes that this technique was used in the study), and that indeed a heavier metal such as Mo is present in the oblong spherule. (We see similar shapes; see SEM image below right and Fig. 1.)

 

&gt;In the same data set obtained via FOIA action, an XEDS spectrum labeled “Molysph.TIF” and two nearly identical XEDS curves (with additional elemental identifications) labeled “Molly spectrum 25 kV” accompany what we deduce applies to the Mo spherule, given the designations. One of the spectra extends to approximately 19 keV (the electron beam energy was no doubt 25 kV), and shows a clear Mo line at 17.3 keV. This removes ambiguity regarding the peak at ~2.3 keV, which could otherwise be S or Pb or Bi (for example). The XEDS plots for this spherule labeled “Moly sph” show significant concentrations of aluminum, oxygen and calcium in addition to the dominant molybdenum peak and deserve further investigation. (For example, the Mo/Al peak height ratio is Mo:Al :: 5:1.)

&gt;We discern that considerable study was performed on this Mo-rich spherule, given the number of images and XEDS plots for it, yet these data were not previously released in the public USGS reports.[2] We emphasize these data because of the extremely high melting temperature of molybdenum, and the observation of this molybdenum-rich spherule. Molybdenum is a refractory metal known for its extremely high melting point [9]. Mo melts at 2,623 °C (4,753 °F) [10], although addition of other elements may lower the melting point. No explanation of the high temperature needed to form the observed Mo-rich spherule is given in the USGS material (either published or obtained by FOIA action).

*The following uses for molybdenum are gathered from a number of sources as well as from anecdotal comments. I'd be delighted to receive corrections as well as additional referenced uses (please use the feedback mechanism to add uses).*  


valuable alloying agent (contributes to the hardenability and toughness of quenched and tempered steels). Almost all ultra-high strength steels contain molybdenum in amounts from 0.25 to 8%
    improves the strength of steel at high temperatures
    electrodes for electrically heated glass furnaces
    nuclear energy applications
    missile and aircraft parts
    valuable catalyst in petroleum refining
    filament material in electrical applications
    essential trace element in plant nutrition. Some soils are barren for lack of this element in the soil
    molybdenum disulphide is a good lubricant, especially at high temperatures where normal oils decompose

Dr. Greening has some very good observations. 

&gt;JREFers always use one or more of the following modes of attack:

&gt;(ii) Taunt the CTist with “where’s your evidence?”  

&gt;(iii) Question the CTist’s credentials – “Are you a scientist?”; “Are you an engineer?”  

&gt;(iv) Ask the CTist why there are no peer-reviewed journal articles refuting NIST.  

&gt;(v) Ask the CTist if they are going to submit an article to a peer-reviewed journal.

&gt;When a CTist retreats, the JREFers pass the time patting each other on the back for another debunking job well done and discuss how idiotic that particular CTist was. While this may be a source of entertainment for the JREFers, this type of mutual admiration is not particularly helpful to anyone seeking to understand how the Twin Towers collapsed. In fact, I would say that the JREFers appear to be fixated only on smothering scientific debate under a blanket of NIST, FEMA, Kean, Fox and CNN “Truths”!

&gt;**Why did the BBC report the WTC Building 7 collapse twenty minutes in advance of the event?**  


&gt;They refuse to give their source. They also lost the footage for a few years. The BBC explanations for this on their website received much negative comment and attention as it makes sense that reporting an event before it happens, then not quoting the source and losing the footage does not bode well for good journalism, on the day ""in the fog of war"" as some have put it, or afterwards when questions were arrogantly dismissed. 

&gt;Conspiracy or not, proper journalists would answer these questions. They are relevant as a matter of record. Ridiculing those who ask these questions begs other questions. Why so certain there is no problem with the BBC reporting on this subject? Heard of Jimmy Savile? After all, these are just questions. Since Quora is a place to ask questions and have them answered by people who know, why not try answering them before resorting to the name calling, defending the establishment as a knee jerk reaction and using dismissive language found in many answers on this question.

&gt;Whether or not BBC was part of a conspiracy or not, is not the question. The question is why did they report it all? Who knew it would collapse and why? If there was advance warning of this event it should be known. It may silence those who believe it was a conspiracy. Perhaps the forewarning will explain the conspiracy away. The fact that this is not revealed only makes matters worse. 

&gt;This is relevant to understanding the event. For anyone to say ""they made a mistake"" is an opinion. You can't mistakenly predict the future so another, proper explanation is required. Showing the information they received will resolve this but it's not forth coming. But the ""there's nothing to see here"" attitude answers nothing.

&gt;In addition, for those who concede that mistakes are made in the reporting of these things, it would behoove them to apply this instant knee jerk defense to all reporting of such events in the media. There are, no doubt, many incorrect reports and it means that for those who want thorough answers we have to work harder than quoting powerful news organizations that make mistakes, as the final word on these matters.

&gt;A proper answer on Quora addresses the question and backs it up. 

&gt;The answer to this question is: We don't know why, but we should.

&gt;In 1999, Helms says, she got a message from the Taliban leadership that they were willing to turn over all of bin Laden’s communications equipment, which they had seized, to the U.S. When she called the State Department with this offer, officials were at first interested, but later said, “No. We want him.”

&gt;In the same year, Prince Turki, head of Saudi intelligence, reputedly came up with a scheme to capture bin Laden on his own; after consulting with the Taliban he flew his private plane to Kabul and drove out to see Mullah Omar at his HQ. The two men sat down, as Helms recounts the story, and the Saudi said, “There’s just one little thing. Will you kill bin Laden before you put him on the plane?” Mullah Omar called for a bucket of cold water. As the Saudi delegation fidgeted, he took off his turban, splashed water on his head, and then washed his hands before sitting back down. “You know why I asked for the cold water?” he asked Turki. “What you just said made my blood boil.”

&gt;Bin Laden was a guest of the Afghanis and there was no way they were going to kill him, though they might turn him over for a trial. But that the deal collapsed, and Turki flew home empty-handed.

&gt;What are the serious issues?

&gt;• While the TPP has been kept secret from the public, large corporate interests have had a seat at the table throughout the process. These businesses have an obligation to make as much money as possible for their shareholders. This means that a great many of the deals that form the basis of the TPP have been negotiated with an eye to advantaging those businesses, potentially at the expense of the average citizen.

&gt;• ""Free trade"" as the TPP proposes is nothing new - globalization has already happened, and we are all the beneficiaries. What this deal will offer is not for the average citizen, who might see a few price differences on common products - it is for the large corporate interests who will have more freedom to move jobs and production to areas where it is cheaper to conduct business.

&gt;• There should be no such areas within the TPP zone, but part of the negotiation involves exceptions in place specifically to help these companies. The consistent standards that the TPP desires to set? Corporations would like to see those standards lowered - it is in their best interest to have access to a labor, property and capital market where they pay the least amount of money to conduct their business.

&gt;• Tariffs exist in part to protect domestic industry - jobs - from the vagaries of a global market. If cheaper US milk is sold in Canada, Canadian milk producers will have to choose whether to sell their own products more cheaply or else close down and go out of business. If it is not possible for these farmers to sell at a lower price and still remain profitable, then that choice is not a choice at all.

&gt;• The TPP's intellectual property provisions, which have been the subject of several leaks, are harsher than existing law, a product (again) of corporate involvement in the deal. They aim to crack down on several ways people use intellectual property, fairly and otherwise, and their scope means there is significant possibility for abuse and harrassment.

&gt;• More damagingly, the TPP applies those laws to drugs with an eye to preventing cheaper medicine from being available on the market - products that by rights should be subject to competition as their prices are heavily inflated beyond the cost of production.

&gt;• The TPP will offer a method by which companies can attack laws that affect them, suing governments through a tribunal for such offenses as trying to protect youth from cigarette marketing images, trying to protect the environment from dangerous industrial contaminants, or even refusing to pass laws removing or suppressing regulations where beneficial to corporate activity. These are all issues that already happen under various trade deals.

&gt;• We, the public, and our elected representatives will not have a great deal of time or means to push back against this trade deal if we dislike it. The text will only be released when absolutely necessary (a period of 60 days in the US) and steps have already been taken to ensure that elected officials cannot muck about with the deal. While this is logical (it would not be fair to negotiate terms and then change them back at home without discussing it), it does mean that instead of being able to debate and dissect we're committed to an all-or-nothing deal.

&gt;Tl;dr the TPP puts local industries at risk, threatens jobs, attacks your privacy, and you may be looking at paying more for important medications (either directly or through your government). It's being sold as lower prices and better standards across the board, but lower prices are meaningless by themselves - purchasing power is what you really want - and there is no guarantee that standards need to be raised instead of lowered.

Must have been two different authors because the site does support explosives bring down the towers. 


The site claims to have waited until it knew for certain it was an inside job and claims it wants to cut to the chase and expose what purports to be a solid case of explosions bringing down the towers. The level of research at this site ranges from excellent to poor. Questionable YT sources for ""explosion noises"" are used as evidence.

***  

Seven days after the FBI put that out...  
 
***  

**FBI Chief Raises New Doubts Over Hijackers' Identities**  
  

Investigation: FBI chief raises questions on how much is known about the suspects. Some names used also belong to Saudi citizens who are alive.   





FBI Director Robert Mueller acknowledged Thursday that investigators may not know the true identities of some of the 19 suspected airplane hijackers from last week's suicide attacks.

Mueller said last week that he had ""a fairly high level of confidence"" that the FBI knew the real names of the hijackers, based on flight manifests and follow-up interviews.

But while in Pennsylvania on Thursday for a tour of the crash site there, he raised fresh doubts about the accuracy of the identifications.

""We have several hijackers whose identities were those of the names on the manifests,"" Mueller said. ""We have several others that are still in question. The investigation is ongoing, and I am not certain as to several of the others.""

Officials refused to say how many hijackers may have used false identities, but officials of the Saudi Arabian government said Thursday that six of the men that the United States has named as hijackers killed in the attacks appear to be living in the Middle East.

Investigators believe that some of the 19 suspected hijackers may have stolen the identities of law-abiding Middle Easterners, further complicating the probe.

Confusion over the identities of some of the terrorists is one reason authorities have delayed putting out the photographs of the hijackers, as they had planned to do last week, Justice Department spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said.

The Saudi citizens who were mistakenly linked to last week's tragedy are horrified, said a diplomat at the Saudi Embassy here.

""You should see the hate mail we are getting,"" said Gaafar Allagany, head of the embassy's information center. ""We think this was part of the plan.""

The six Saudis are:

* Abdulaziz Alomari, a name used by one of the suspected hijackers on American Airlines Flight 11, the first plane that crashed into the World Trade Center.

A man with the same name is an electrical engineer in Saudi Arabia. He lived in Denver, where he got his degree from the University of Colorado, from 1993 until last year.

""In 1995, his apartment was broken into in Denver and his passport and other official documents were stolen,"" Allagany said.

* Salem Alhamzi, a name used by one of the suspected hijackers on American Airlines Flight 77, the plane that crashed into the Pentagon.

A man with the same name works for the Saudi Royal Commission in the Saudi city of Yanbu.

* Saeed Alghamdi, a name used by one of the alleged hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania.

A Saudi Arabian pilot, currently on a mission to Tunisia, has the same name.

* Ahmed Alnami, a name used by another suspected hijacker on Flight 93.

A 33-year-old Saudi Arabian pilot with the same name is alive in Riyadh.

* Wail Alshehri, a name used by one of the suspected hijackers on American Airlines Flight 11.

A man by the same name is a pilot whose father is a Saudi diplomat in Bombay. ""I personally talked to both father and son today,"" Allagany said.

* Waleed M. Alshehri, a name used by another alleged hijacker on Flight 11, is the same name as the other son of the diplomat. Allagany said that man is living in Jidda.

""This is a respectable family. I know his sons, and they're both alive,"" he said.

In other developments Thursday, an FBI official in San Antonio discounted any ties between two Indian nationals arrested on an Amtrak train in Fort Worth last week and a San Antonio physician also being held for questioning following the terror attacks.

""There's no connection"" between them ""at this time,"" said special agent Rene Salinas, spokesman for the FBI's office in San Antonio.

Salinas also said federal agents found nothing suspicious in the purchase of airline tickets from San Antonio to San Diego for a scheduled flight Saturday by the physician, Al-Badr Al-Hazmi. The 34-year-old Saudi national is studying at the University of Texas Health Science Center.

The FBI list of people wanted for questioning included Al-Hazmi and four other people, three with the surname Al-Hazmi. According to the list, the five individuals were booked on the same flights leaving Saturday from San Antonio, going to Denver and on to San Diego, and then returning Oct. 20.

Also Thursday, a Muslim cleric questioned by prosecutors about last week's attacks called the suicide operations ""vicious and cowardly acts of terror"" and also protested his treatment by the FBI.

The clergyman, Moataz Al-Hallak, led a mosque in suburban Dallas, where suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden's former personal secretary prayed.

""We had a calamity,"" Al-Hallak said. ""We don't want to add more innocent victims. It's been hard.""

Bin Laden's former secretary was convicted in May of conspiring to kill Americans in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Al-Hallak testified three times under a grant of immunity to the grand jury in that case.

Thirteen months ago, Al-Hallak moved to a suburb of Washington, where the five hijackers suspected of forcing a plane into the Pentagon apparently spent the week before the crash.

FBI agents in Dallas told reporters last week that they wanted to speak to Al-Hallak in connection with the attacks. His name, native land and birth date were entered on the agency's watch list.

Agents said Al-Hallak may have made statements predicting the attacks while he was visiting Texas, an assertion his lawyer denied.

On Wednesday, the clergyman spent three hours with federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, who led the government's case in the embassy bombings trial. Al-Hallak said he answered every question.

""I don't know Bin Laden. I don't know what he did. I don't know what he did not do,"" Al-Hallak said at a Thursday news conference.

Bin Laden ""has been accused of committing horrible crimes,"" Al-Hallak said. ""These accusations need to be proved in a court of law, and justice needs to be established.""

Given the confusion over suspects' identities, the FBI is moving carefully to determine whether a man arrested near Chicago late Wednesday--identified as Nabil Al-Marabh--is the man on a watch list of possible associates of the terrorists.

Kathleen McChesney of the Chicago FBI office said Al-Marabh's vehicle and residence were searched and that numerous law enforcement agencies, including a Chicago-based terrorism task force and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, are working together ""so we know exactly who this person is.""

Al-Marabh, a 34-year-old former cabdriver, was picked up in Burbank, Ill., at a convenience store where he had worked for several days.

Al-Marabh was being held on a warrant from Boston stemming from probation violations.

Property records indicate that in the mid-1990s he shared a Boston apartment with accused terrorist Raed Hijazi.

Hijazi is in jail in Jordan on charges that he planned to blow up a hotel during millennium celebrations. Both men drove taxis for the Boston Cab Co.

Federal officials believe Al-Marabh and Hijazi may have close ties to two of the suspected hijackers in last week's attack. They also have been linked with two men suspected of helping to plan last year's bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole in Yemen.

Authorities last week scoured a series of residences in Boston where Al-Marabh lived over 10 years. On Monday, federal agents raided a Detroit residence with his name on the mailbox.

According to law enforcement documents, Al-Marabh was three hours away from Detroit at the time, obtaining a driver's license in Three Oaks, Mich., near the Indiana border.

Al-Marabh, a short, stocky native of Kuwait, pleaded guilty in Boston last December to stabbing his roommate. Witnesses said he yelled, ""If this wasn't America, I'd kill you.""

His court-appointed lawyer, Robert Menton, said Al-Marabh told him he stabbed Arafat Abuhejeb ""because he deserved it."" Menton said his client described himself as a holy man with a degree in international relations from a Middle Eastern university. He also told his lawyer he had a wife at home in Kuwait.

But Al-Marabh told at least one of his numerous Boston-area landlords that the Vietnamese woman he lived with was his wife.

Although a court file called him an indigent, Al-Marabh ""always seemed to have money"" and traveled often, his lawyer said. Menton said his client was concerned about being sentenced to jail for the stabbing ""because he said he needed to get back to Kuwait.""

He was given a six-month suspended sentence. But probation department records in Boston show that he never reported, as he was ordered to do, and an arrest warrant was issued for him in March.

In addition, records from the office of the Michigan secretary of state show that on Sept. 11, 2000, Al-Marabh obtained a license that permits him to drive semi-trucks containing hazardous materials, including explosives and caustic materials.

5963,"&gt;The city’s water woes come amid a troublesome moment in Flint’s history: Throttled by financial uncertainty, **Flint was placed into state receivership in 2011, when Republican governor Rick Snyder appointed an emergency manager with vast power to oversee the city’s day-to-day operations.** Flint also ranks high on the list of violent US cities, a standing that’s exacerbated by a continually fleeing tax base.

&gt;It’s against that backdrop that Flint’s water supply became a source of trouble, following then **emergency manager Ed Kurtz’s decision, in April 2014, to decline a short-term deal with Detroit to continue receiving water from the city, and instead sign a contract to join a new system.**

&gt;Immediately, problems arose. Residents complained about water that was suddenly cloudy, odorous and tasted rancid. Test results showed levels of fecal coliform bacteria and, eventually, elevated levels of total trihalomethanes, chemical compounds which, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, can lead to liver or kidney issues for an individual who consumes water with high levels over a long period of time.
Advertisement

&gt;As the problems continued to fester, residents started to organize and rally for clean, affordable water. Flint residents pay an average $140 monthly bill for water, an analysis by the Flint Journal found.

&gt;During a meeting in January, **Walters said she approached the city’s emergency manager to show off a collection of water bottles that contained her discolored supply. “He told me that I was a liar and stupid,” Walters said.**

http://www.jonesreport.com/articles/270207_bbc_lost_response.html  

&gt;Here is the BBC's response to the questions about the footage that was unearthed yesterday, with my comments after each statement.

BBC *1. We're not part of a conspiracy. Nobody told us what to say or do on September 11th. We didn't get told in advance that buildings were going to fall down. We didn't receive press releases or scripts in advance of events happening.*  


**""We didn't get told in advance that buildings were going to fall down."" If this is true, then how on earth did the BBC report the collapse of Building 7 before it happened? Psychic clairvoyance? Of course they were told that WTC 7 was coming down, just like the firefighters, police, first responders and CNN were told it was coming down. They had to have had a source for making such a claim. The BBC is acting like the naughty little boy who got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. No one here is claiming the BBC are ""part of the conspiracy,"" but their hideous penchant to just repeat what authorities tell them without even a cursory investigation (and with the Building they are telling us has collapsed mockingly filling the background shot of the report), is a damning indictment of their yellow journalism when it comes to 9/11.**  





BBC *2. In the chaos and confusion of the day, I'm quite sure we said things which turned out to be untrue or inaccurate - but at the time were based on the best information we had. We did what we always did - sourced our reports, used qualifying words like ""apparently"" or ""it's reported"" or ""we're hearing"" and constantly tried to check and double check the information we were receiving.*  


**How do ""chaos and confusion"" explain how the BBC reported on the collapse of a building, a collapse that happened ""unexpectedly"" according to their Conspiracy Files hit piece documentary, before it happened? In one breath the BBC is claiming they were not told of the impending collapse of the Building and in the next they are telling us that all their information is sourced. Which is it to be? Did the BBC have a source telling them the building was about to collapse or not? If not, how on earth could they pre-empt its fall? Do BBC reporters have access to a time machine? What was the source of this information?**  


BBC *3. Our reporter Jane Standley was in New York on the day of the attacks, and like everyone who was there, has the events seared on her mind. I've spoken to her today and unsurprisingly, she doesn't remember minute-by-minute what she said or did - like everybody else that day she was trying to make sense of what she was seeing; what she was being told; and what was being told to her by colleagues in London who were monitoring feeds and wires services.*  


**Trying to make sense of what she was being told? She obviously didn't make much sense of the fact that the Building she was reporting had collapsed was prominently standing behind her! Unfortunately, for a news organization that prides itself on accuracy and credibility, ""she doesn't remember"" just doesn't cut it as an excuse.**  


BBC *4. We no longer have the original tapes of our 9/11 coverage (for reasons of cock-up, not conspiracy). So if someone has got a recording of our output, I'd love to get hold of it. We do have the tapes for our sister channel News 24, but they don't help clear up the issue one way or another.*  

**We are asked to believe that the world's premiere news organization has somehow lost all its tapes of perhaps the biggest news event of the past 60 years. This is a copout. Whether they have lost the tapes or not, the BBC simply doesn't want to verify one hundred per cent their monumental foul-up, because they know it would only increase the exposure of this issue and lead to further questions. What is there to clear up? The reporter is standing in front of the building while saying it has already collapsed! This is a blatant effort to try and placate people making complaints while refusing to admit a monumental faux pas that further undermines the BBC's credibility in the aftermath of the Conspiracy Files debacle.**  


BBC *5. If we reported the building had collapsed before it had done so, it would have been an error - no more than that. As one of the comments on You Tube says today ""so the guy in the studio didn't quite know what was going on? Woah, that totally proves conspiracy... ""*  


**So now the BBC are so devoid of answers, they have to enlist the help of some moronic comment on a You Tube blog? Instead of issuing official statements and seeking the advice of legal professionals they produce a cobbled together five paragraph blog and include the testimony of some moron on a You Tube comment board. Pathetic! Answer the question BBC - what was your source for reporting on multiple occasions that Building 7 had collapsed before it had collapsed, and identify the source that enabled the anchorman to comment that the building had collapsed due to it being weakened, an explanation still unanswered by NIST five and a half years later.**  


**If you had reported the collapse of the twin towers before it happened would that have been just an error too? This ""error"" translated as $800 million plus in insurance bounty for Larry Silverstein - I'm sure Industrial Risk Insurers would be interested to know the source of your ""error."" In addition, two seperate sources reported that Secret Service Agent Craig Miller died as a result of the collapse of Building 7. Do you think he would have been interested in the ""error"" that led to your correspondent reporting the building's downfall in advance?**

Bush Sought ‘Way’ To Invade Iraq?

Jan. 11, 2004

A year ago, Paul O'Neill was fired from his job as George Bush's Treasury Secretary for disagreeing too many times with the president's policy on tax cuts. 

Now, O'Neill - who is known for speaking his mind - talks for the first time about his two years inside the Bush administration. His story is the centerpiece of a new book being published this week about the way the Bush White House is run. 

Entitled ""The Price of Loyalty,"" the book by a former Wall Street Journal reporter draws on interviews with high-level officials who gave the author their personal accounts of meetings with the president, their notes and documents. 

But the main source of the book was Paul O'Neill. Correspondent Lesley Stahl reports. 

Paul O'Neill says he is going public because he thinks the Bush Administration has been too secretive about how decisions have been made. 

Will this be seen as a “kiss-and-tell"" book? 

“I've come to believe that people will say damn near anything, so I'm sure somebody will say all of that and more,” says O’Neill, who was George Bush's top economic policy official. 

In the book, O’Neill says that the president did not make decisions in a methodical way: there was no free-flow of ideas or open debate. 

At cabinet meetings, he says the president was ""like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people. There is no discernible connection,"" forcing top officials to act ""on little more than hunches about what the president might think."" 

This is what O'Neill says happened at his first hour-long, one-on-one meeting with Mr. Bush: “I went in with a long list of things to talk about, and I thought to engage on and as the book says, I was surprised that it turned out me talking, and the president just listening … As I recall, it was mostly a monologue.” 

He also says that President Bush was disengaged, at least on domestic issues, and that disturbed him. And he says that wasn't his experience when he worked as a top official under Presidents Nixon and Ford, or the way he ran things when he was chairman of Alcoa. 

O'Neill readily agreed to tell his story to the book's author Ron Suskind – and he adds that he's taking no money for his part in the book. 

Suskind says he interviewed hundreds of people for the book – including several cabinet members. 

O'Neill is the only one who spoke on the record, but Suskind says that someone high up in the administration – Donald Rumsfeld - warned O’Neill not to do this book. 

Was it a warning, or a threat? 

“I don't think so. I think it was the White House concerned,” says Suskind. “Understandably, because O'Neill has spent extraordinary amounts of time with the president. They said, ‘This could really be the one moment where things are revealed.’""

Not only did O'Neill give Suskind his time, he gave him 19,000 internal documents. 

“Everything's there: Memoranda to the President, handwritten ""thank you"" notes, 100-page documents. Stuff that's sensitive,” says Suskind, adding that in some cases, it included transcripts of private, high-level National Security Council meetings. “You don’t get higher than that.” 

And what happened at President Bush's very first National Security Council meeting is one of O'Neill's most startling revelations. 

“From the very beginning, there was a conviction, that Saddam Hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go,” says O’Neill, who adds that going after Saddam was topic ""A"" 10 days after the inauguration - eight months before Sept. 11. 

“From the very first instance, it was about Iraq. It was about what we can do to change this regime,” says Suskind. “Day one, these things were laid and sealed.” 

As treasury secretary, O'Neill was a permanent member of the National Security Council. He says in the book he was surprised at the meeting that questions such as ""Why Saddam?"" and ""Why now?"" were never asked. 

""It was all about finding a way to do it. That was the tone of it. The president saying ‘Go find me a way to do this,’"" says O’Neill. “For me, the notion of pre-emption, that the U.S. has the unilateral right to do whatever we decide to do, is a really huge leap.” 

And that came up at this first meeting, says O’Neill, who adds that the discussion of Iraq continued at the next National Security Council meeting two days later. 

He got briefing materials under this cover sheet. “There are memos. One of them marked, secret, says, ‘Plan for post-Saddam Iraq,’"" adds Suskind, who says that they discussed an occupation of Iraq in January and February of 2001. 

Based on his interviews with O'Neill and several other officials at the meetings, Suskind writes that the planning envisioned peacekeeping troops, war crimes tribunals, and even divvying up Iraq's oil wealth. 

He obtained one Pentagon document, dated March 5, 2001, and entitled ""Foreign Suitors for Iraqi Oilfield contracts,"" which includes a map of potential areas for exploration. 

“It talks about contractors around the world from, you know, 30-40 countries. And which ones have what intentions,” says Suskind. “On oil in Iraq.” 

During the campaign, candidate Bush had criticized the Clinton-Gore Administration for being too interventionist: ""If we don't stop extending our troops all around the world in nation-building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road. And I'm going to prevent that."" 

“The thing that's most surprising, I think, is how emphatically, from the very first, the administration had said ‘X’ during the campaign, but from the first day was often doing ‘Y,’” says Suskind. “Not just saying ‘Y,’ but actively moving toward the opposite of what they had said during the election.” 

The president had promised to cut taxes, and he did. Within six months of taking office, he pushed a trillion dollars worth of tax cuts through Congress. 
But O'Neill thought it should have been the end. After 9/11 and the war in Afghanistan, the budget deficit was growing. So at a meeting with the vice president after the mid-term elections in 2002, Suskind writes that O'Neill argued against a second round of tax cuts. 

“Cheney, at this moment, shows his hand,” says Suskind. “He says, ‘You know, Paul, Reagan proved that deficits don't matter. We won the mid-term elections, this is our due.’ … O'Neill is speechless.” 

”It was not just about not wanting the tax cut. It was about how to use the nation's resources to improve the condition of our society,” says O’Neill. “And I thought the weight of working on Social Security and fundamental tax reform was a lot more important than a tax reduction.” 

Did he think it was irresponsible? “Well, it's for sure not what I would have done,” says O’Neill. 

The former treasury secretary accuses Vice President Dick Cheney of not being an honest broker, but, with a handful of others, part of ""a praetorian guard that encircled the president"" to block out contrary views. ""This is the way Dick likes it,"" says O’Neill.

Bush Sought ‘Way’ To Invade Iraq?

Jan. 11, 2004

A year ago, Paul O'Neill was fired from his job as George Bush's Treasury Secretary for disagreeing too many times with the president's policy on tax cuts. 

Now, O'Neill - who is known for speaking his mind - talks for the first time about his two years inside the Bush administration. His story is the centerpiece of a new book being published this week about the way the Bush White House is run. 

Entitled ""The Price of Loyalty,"" the book by a former Wall Street Journal reporter draws on interviews with high-level officials who gave the author their personal accounts of meetings with the president, their notes and documents. 

But the main source of the book was Paul O'Neill. Correspondent Lesley Stahl reports. 

Paul O'Neill says he is going public because he thinks the Bush Administration has been too secretive about how decisions have been made. 

Will this be seen as a “kiss-and-tell"" book? 

“I've come to believe that people will say damn near anything, so I'm sure somebody will say all of that and more,” says O’Neill, who was George Bush's top economic policy official. 

In the book, O’Neill says that the president did not make decisions in a methodical way: there was no free-flow of ideas or open debate. 

At cabinet meetings, he says the president was ""like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people. There is no discernible connection,"" forcing top officials to act ""on little more than hunches about what the president might think."" 

This is what O'Neill says happened at his first hour-long, one-on-one meeting with Mr. Bush: “I went in with a long list of things to talk about, and I thought to engage on and as the book says, I was surprised that it turned out me talking, and the president just listening … As I recall, it was mostly a monologue.” 

He also says that President Bush was disengaged, at least on domestic issues, and that disturbed him. And he says that wasn't his experience when he worked as a top official under Presidents Nixon and Ford, or the way he ran things when he was chairman of Alcoa. 

O'Neill readily agreed to tell his story to the book's author Ron Suskind – and he adds that he's taking no money for his part in the book. 

Suskind says he interviewed hundreds of people for the book – including several cabinet members. 

O'Neill is the only one who spoke on the record, but Suskind says that someone high up in the administration – Donald Rumsfeld - warned O’Neill not to do this book. 

Was it a warning, or a threat? 

“I don't think so. I think it was the White House concerned,” says Suskind. “Understandably, because O'Neill has spent extraordinary amounts of time with the president. They said, ‘This could really be the one moment where things are revealed.’""

Not only did O'Neill give Suskind his time, he gave him 19,000 internal documents. 

“Everything's there: Memoranda to the President, handwritten ""thank you"" notes, 100-page documents. Stuff that's sensitive,” says Suskind, adding that in some cases, it included transcripts of private, high-level National Security Council meetings. “You don’t get higher than that.” 

And what happened at President Bush's very first National Security Council meeting is one of O'Neill's most startling revelations. 

“From the very beginning, there was a conviction, that Saddam Hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go,” says O’Neill, who adds that going after Saddam was topic ""A"" 10 days after the inauguration - eight months before Sept. 11. 

“From the very first instance, it was about Iraq. It was about what we can do to change this regime,” says Suskind. “Day one, these things were laid and sealed.” 

As treasury secretary, O'Neill was a permanent member of the National Security Council. He says in the book he was surprised at the meeting that questions such as ""Why Saddam?"" and ""Why now?"" were never asked. 

""It was all about finding a way to do it. That was the tone of it. The president saying ‘Go find me a way to do this,’"" says O’Neill. “For me, the notion of pre-emption, that the U.S. has the unilateral right to do whatever we decide to do, is a really huge leap.” 

And that came up at this first meeting, says O’Neill, who adds that the discussion of Iraq continued at the next National Security Council meeting two days later. 

He got briefing materials under this cover sheet. “There are memos. One of them marked, secret, says, ‘Plan for post-Saddam Iraq,’"" adds Suskind, who says that they discussed an occupation of Iraq in January and February of 2001. 

Based on his interviews with O'Neill and several other officials at the meetings, Suskind writes that the planning envisioned peacekeeping troops, war crimes tribunals, and even divvying up Iraq's oil wealth. 

He obtained one Pentagon document, dated March 5, 2001, and entitled ""Foreign Suitors for Iraqi Oilfield contracts,"" which includes a map of potential areas for exploration. 

“It talks about contractors around the world from, you know, 30-40 countries. And which ones have what intentions,” says Suskind. “On oil in Iraq.” 

During the campaign, candidate Bush had criticized the Clinton-Gore Administration for being too interventionist: ""If we don't stop extending our troops all around the world in nation-building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road. And I'm going to prevent that."" 

“The thing that's most surprising, I think, is how emphatically, from the very first, the administration had said ‘X’ during the campaign, but from the first day was often doing ‘Y,’” says Suskind. “Not just saying ‘Y,’ but actively moving toward the opposite of what they had said during the election.” 

The president had promised to cut taxes, and he did. Within six months of taking office, he pushed a trillion dollars worth of tax cuts through Congress. 
But O'Neill thought it should have been the end. After 9/11 and the war in Afghanistan, the budget deficit was growing. So at a meeting with the vice president after the mid-term elections in 2002, Suskind writes that O'Neill argued against a second round of tax cuts. 

“Cheney, at this moment, shows his hand,” says Suskind. “He says, ‘You know, Paul, Reagan proved that deficits don't matter. We won the mid-term elections, this is our due.’ … O'Neill is speechless.” 

”It was not just about not wanting the tax cut. It was about how to use the nation's resources to improve the condition of our society,” says O’Neill. “And I thought the weight of working on Social Security and fundamental tax reform was a lot more important than a tax reduction.” 

Did he think it was irresponsible? “Well, it's for sure not what I would have done,” says O’Neill. 

The former treasury secretary accuses Vice President Dick Cheney of not being an honest broker, but, with a handful of others, part of ""a praetorian guard that encircled the president"" to block out contrary views. ""This is the way Dick likes it,"" says O’Neill. 

Meanwhile, the White House was losing patience with O'Neill. He was becoming known for a series of off-the-cuff remarks his critics called gaffes. One of them sent the dollar into a nosedive and required major damage control. 

Twice during stock market meltdowns, O'Neill was not available to the president: He was out of the country - one time on a trip to Africa with the Irish rock star Bono.

6001,"Some elaboration is badly needed. 

***  
&gt;Both technical calculations and testimony from WTC structural engineers confirm that the Twin Towers were built to withstand the impact from the passenger jets that hit them on 9/11.

Airplane impact tests conducted by WTC structural engineers during the design of the Twin Towers used the Boeing 707, which was one of the largest passenger jets in the world at the time. The results of the test, carried out early in 1964, calculated that the towers would handle the impact of a 707 traveling at 600 mph without collapsing.

Even though the two Boeing 767 aircraft that were said to be used in the 9/11 attacks were slightly larger than the 707, technical comparisons show that the 707 has more destructive force at cruising speed. The following analysis was compiled by 911research.net:

 

The maximum takeoff weight for a Boeing 707-320B is 336,000 pounds.
The maximum takeoff weight for a Boeing 767-200ER is 395,000 pounds.

The wingspan of a Boeing 707 is 146 feet.
The wingspan of a Boeing 767 is 156 feet.

The length of a Boeing 707 is 153 feet.
The length of a Boeing 767 is 159 feet.

The Boeing 707 could carry 23,000 gallons of fuel.
The Boeing 767 could carry 23,980 gallons of fuel.

The cruise speed of a Boeing 707 is 607 mph = 890 ft/s,
The cruise speed of a Boeing 767 is 530 mph = 777 ft/s.

So, the Boeing 707 and 767 are very similar aircraft, with the main differences being that the 767 is slightly heavier and the 707 is faster.

In designing the towers to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707, the designers would have assumed that the aircraft was operated normally. So they would have assumed that the aircraft was traveling at its cruise speed (i.e., not at faster speeds perhaps flown by suicide pilots). With this in mind, we can calculate the energy that the plane would impart to the towers in any accidental collision.

The kinetic energy released by the impact of a Boeing 707 at cruise speed is
= 0.5 x 336,000 x (890)^2/32.174
= 4.136 billion ft lbs force (5,607,720 Kilojoules).

The kinetic energy released by the impact of a Boeing 767 at cruise speed is
= 0.5 x 395,000 x (777)^2/32.174
= 3.706 billion ft lbs force (5,024,650 Kilojoules).

From this, we see that under normal flying conditions, a Boeing 707 would smash into the WTC with about 10 percent more energy than would the slightly heavier Boeing 767. That is, under normal flying conditions, a Boeing 707 would do more damage than a Boeing 767.

 

So what can be said about the actual impacts?

The speed of impact of AA Flight 11 was 470 mph = 689 ft/s.
The speed of impact of UA Flight 175 was 590 mph = 865 ft/s.

The kinetic energy released by the impact of AA Flight 11 was
= 0.5 x 395,000 x (689)^2/32.174
= 2.914 billion ft lbs force (3,950,950 Kilojoules).

This is well within limits that the towers were built to survive. So why did the North tower fall?

The kinetic energy released by the impact of UA Flight 175 was
= 0.5 x 395,000 x (865)^2/32.174
= 4.593 billion ft lbs force (6,227,270 Kilojoules).

This is within 10 percent of the energy released by the impact of a Boeing 707 at cruise speed. So, it would be also a surprise for the 767 impact to have caused the South tower to fall.",2015-10-02 05:39:07+00:00,cvlffug,4.0,t1_cvld4x3,5709.0,conspiracy

Don't know.  It's a compelling case for three photos being merged. The author doesn't seem to contest the one in the middle with the molten material and the grappler except to say it wasn't present at the time the other photos were taken. If you go looking for the author ([Frank Silecchia](http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2006/WTC-Jones19mar06.htm)) you'll find the story behind the pic it appears to be missing. Frank also found the WTC cross. I haven't seen where Steven explains the story. No doubt molten steel was found so this story is interesting because of the reasons behind publishing a photo without provenance. No doubt Steven Jones does excellent research so why does and anomaly exist at all? It doesn't seem like he needed this pic to bolster his already strong case for molten steel so possibly he was tricked?

&gt;Who would pick up molten steel with a steel crane claw?  

Found this. 

&gt;Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees... Special expertise was needed. OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments to reduce the hazards.

&gt;He said that during the second call, he was asked to disclose his Social Security number, date of birth, passport number and military identification number.

&gt;The Advertiser has been unable to confirm the identity of a man who answered the phone at Larson's apartment Sept. 12 and identified himself as a close family friend named Steve Jocelyn.

The manager of the Lahaina complex where Larson lives said no one named Jocelyn lives there.

And will the media do an about-face with them, and obligingly lavish coverage on what it has complicitly covered up since 9/11?  

If all this is going on because of 9/11 Truth it's a demonstration on the weight of the movement, after media, politicians and 28 page truthers implicate Saudi Arabia or not, the movement will still trudge along making noise and attracting attention yet some other way. 

Seems the 28 page story may have somewhat legitimized investigating 9/11Truth overall? Considering ""conspiracy theorist"" now being more acceptable to the general public this story may just backfire and cause more people to look at the evidence collected and the case against the official story. Just my two cents.

PM's senior researcher, 25-year-old Benjamin Chertoff, authored a propagandistic cover story entitled ""Debunking 9/11 Lies"" which seeks to discredit all independent 9/11 research that challenges the official version of events.

Chertoff said he was the ""senior researcher"" of the piece. **When asked if he was related to Michael Chertoff, he said, ""I don't know.""** Clearly uncomfortable about discussing the matter further, he told me that all questions about the article should be put to the publicist ? the one who never answers the phone.

&gt;Energetic composites

&gt;MICs can be designed for both fast and slow reactions. The present invention includes chemical reactions between substances which have not previously been useful in applications requiring energetic materials. The reactions take place between atoms which are not bound together in a single molecule, but which are disposed sufficiently close to one another so that rapid chemical reactions will take place. This is accomplished by use of a composite having thin layers of reactants which are separated by thin layers of a material referred to as a buffer which prevents the reaction from taking place until an external triggering stress is applied to initiate the reaction. In addition to MICs which can be designed such that the reactions proceed rapidly, MICs which react more slowly can be designed. **In general, MICs can be designed to suit the application.** For example, if the application requires heat but not gasses, the MIC can be so designed.

Well that's certainly news to me olivepudding! I've been taught not to lie and it's not about to start now that I'm a 9/11truther. You're mistaken in your accusation. 
 

&gt;In its August draft, (NIST NCSTAR 1-9, Draft for Public Comment, Vol. 2: 595-96, 596, 610.) in which it said that the collapse occurred 40 percent slower than free fall, NIST had repeatedly said that its analysis was **“consistent with physical principles.”** One encountered this phrase at least three times.   

[In the final report](http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610) (PDF), however, **every instance of this phrase had been removed.** 


So yes NIST did remove ""consistent with physical principles"" from the final b7 report. 

&gt;it doesn't mention 'unexplained' free fall anywhere.  

How can it mention what it didn't explain? Google 2.25 + building 7 and hit me back when you find the explanation by NIST or anyone for that matter.

The group was founded in 2006 and said its mission was to “expose the official lies and cover-up surrounding the events of September 11, 2001 in a way that inspires the people to overcome denial and understand the truth.” Mr. Gage spoke via video link from San Francisco, California.*

Pre-9/11 Upgraded GPS Service Provided 243 Foot Wide Aerial Navigation Corridors

Amended Version of Journal of 9/11 Studies Paper

Enhanced GPS service (WAAS) now in use by the U.S. commercial aviation industry and activated 13 months prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, provided virtual aerial navigation corridors only 243 wide and a 95% confidence that an aircraft's true position will fall within such a corridor . Such corridors can be navigated entirely by autopilot and flight management systems scheduled in 1996 and 1998 to be contained by United and American airlines Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft like those used during the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.


RNP .02 / Boeing 767-200 / World Trade Center Tower


WAAS also supports required navigation performance (RNP) operations, says Raytheon, providing a precision navigation capability down to RNP 0.02 (an accuracy of 0.02nm).

http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2003/01/07/159964/ups-wins-faa-certification-for-wide-area-gps-receiver.html...


RNP is a required navigation performance level described by the specification of a numeric value indicating the required navigation accuracy for a specific operation, typically specified laterally in nautical miles - e.g., RNP 1 is a Required Navigation Performance of ± 1 nautical mile (95% Probability).

http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/ACNumber/BBADA17DA0D0BBD1862569BA006F64D0?OpenDocument...


1 nautical mile = 6,076 feet

RNP 0.02 = RNP (0.02 nautical mile radius) x 2 = RNP (121.5 foot radius) x 2 = a 243 foot wide corridor.

AMENDED VERSION: Wide Area Augmentation System Signal Now Available

August 24, 2000

WASHINGTON, DC — After a successful 21-day stability test of the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) signal in space, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) declared that it is now available.

http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=5249


According to Raytheon’s director-satellite navigation systems, the newly activated WAAS signal was used by rescuers at New York City's Ground Zero site following September 11, 2001 in order to precisely survey the site:

And, at the World Trade Center, rescue teams used WAAS to survey the site during the recovery program.

http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/categories/commercial/12571.html


By 1996 and 1998, United and American airlines Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft, like those used during the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were scheduled to contain flight management systems and signal receivers capable of utilizing the new GPS service.

Rockwell's Collins Landing System Picked for Both Airbus and Boeing Planes

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Sept. 6, 1996 /PRNewswire/ -- Rockwell's Collins Commercial Avionics, based in Cedar Rapids, has made major announcements of the selection of its Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) landing system by two of the world's leading aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing ... Subsequent certifications are planned for Boeing's ... 757 and 767 ... The Multi-Mode Receiver ... expands capabilities required by the air transport industry as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is phased into operation.

http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18652301.html


GNSS-1 is the first generation system and is the combination of existing satellite navigation systems ... In the United States, the satellite based component is the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_navigation_satellite_system


October 1999:

Digital flight control systems on Boeing airplanes ... automatically fly the airplanes on pre-selected routes, headings, speed or altitude maneuvers.

http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55993162.html


An Air China Boeing 757, generally containing common flight systems with the Boeing 767, reportedly navigated a complex flight segment exclusively under GPS guided autopilot control via RNP operation:

Guided entirely by autopilot, an Air China Boeing 757 jet last month snaked along a narrow river valley between towering Himalayan peaks ... Pilots and passengers looked out to mountains left and right as the airplane automatically followed the twists of the valley, descending on a precisely plotted highway in the sky toward a runway still out of sight ... Using global-positioning satellites and on-board instruments, Naverus' navigation technology pinpoints the location of a fast-moving jet to within yards ... ""You're watching the whole thing unfold. The airplane is turning, going where it's supposed to go ... it's all automatic.""

http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003316294_naverus22.html...


The WAAS signal also made possible under autopilot control, the 370 degree decending right turn from an altitude of 7,000 feet, performed by American Airlines flight 77 prior to its reported impact with the Pentagon building in Arlington, VA on September 11, 2001.

Stanford University, 1998:

The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) ... allows pilots to fly ... approaches that cannot necessarily be flown with current instrumentation ... Complex curved approaches, including approaches turning to a short (less than one mile) final ... Pathways were constructed from ... climbing, or descending constant radius arcs ... Autopilots could use WAAS position and velocity to fly curved trajectories.

How many have seen the evidence for demolition? After seeing and maybe agreeing how many will talk about it at the office? 


&gt;A competent Civil Engineer will see two 747s slam into two towers at high speed imparting HUGE kinetic forces into a structure not designed for those sized loads,     

What are we to make of this?

No and here's why. Squibs near the collapse front are one thing but [squibs shooting out sixty floors below](http://imgur.com/a/XN1Fp) are travel faster than the free falling debris field?

&gt;""Reports of explosions"" This is the clincher and this is totally without context. There were lots of reports of mini-explosions, especially from first responders before the towers came down but they turned out to be the impacts of jumpers from the upper floors.

CIA Document #1035-960

RE: Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report

1. Our Concern. From the day of President Kennedy's assassination on, there has been speculation about the responsibility for his murder. Although this was stemmed for a time by the Warren Commission report, (which appeared at the end of September 1964), various writers have now had time to scan the Commission's published report and documents for new pretexts for questioning, and there has been a new wave of books and articles criticizing the Commission's findings. In most cases the critics have speculated as to the existence of some kind of conspiracy, and often they have implied that the Commission itself was involved. Presumably as a result of the increasing challenge to the Warren Commission's report, a public opinion poll recently indicated that 46% of the American public did not think that Oswald acted alone, while more than half of those polled thought that the Commission had left some questions unresolved. Doubtless polls abroad would show similar, or possibly more adverse results.

2. This trend of opinion is a matter of concern to the U.S. government, including our organization. The members of the Warren Commission were naturally chosen for their integrity, experience and prominence. They represented both major parties, and they and their staff were deliberately drawn from all sections of the country. Just because of the standing of the Commissioners, efforts to impugn their rectitude and wisdom tend to cast doubt on the whole leadership of American society. Moreover, there seems to be an increasing tendency to hint that President Johnson himself, as the one person who might be said to have benefited, was in some way responsible for the assassination.

Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government. Our organization itself is directly involved: among other facts, we contributed information to the investigation. Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments.

3. Action. We do not recommend that discussion of the assassination question be initiated where it is not already taking place. Where discussion is active [business] addresses are requested:

a. To discuss the publicity problem with [?] and friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors), pointing out that the Warren Commission made as thorough an investigation as humanly possible, that the charges of the critics are without serious foundation, and that further speculative discussion only plays into the hands of the opposition. Point out also that parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists. Urge them to use their influence to discourage unfounded and irresponsible speculation.

b. To employ propaganda assets to [negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to this guidance should provide useful background material for passing to assets. Our ploy should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (I) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (I) politically interested, (III) financially interested, (IV) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (V) infatuated with their own theories. In the course of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy may be to single out Epstein's theory for attack, using the attached Fletcher [?] article and Spectator piece for background. (Although Mark Lane's book is much less convincing that Epstein's and comes off badly where confronted by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.)

4. In private to media discussions not directed at any particular writer, or in attacking publications which may be yet forthcoming, the following arguments should be useful:

a. No significant new evidence has emerged which the Commission did not consider. The assassination is sometimes compared (e.g., by Joachim Joesten and Bertrand Russell) with the Dreyfus case; however, unlike that case, the attack on the Warren Commission have produced no new evidence, no new culprits have been convincingly identified, and there is no agreement among the critics. (A better parallel, though an imperfect one, might be with the Reichstag fire of 1933, which some competent historians (Fritz Tobias, AJ.P. Taylor, D.C. Watt) now believe was set by Vander Lubbe on his own initiative, without acting for either Nazis or Communists; the Nazis tried to pin the blame on the Communists, but the latter have been more successful in convincing the world that the Nazis were to blame.)

b. Critics usually overvalue particular items and ignore others. They tend to place more emphasis on the recollections of individual witnesses (which are less reliable and more divergent--and hence offer more hand-holds for criticism) and less on ballistics, autopsy, and photographic evidence. A close examination of the Commission's records will usually show that the conflicting eyewitness accounts are quoted out of context, or were discarded by the Commission for good and sufficient reason.

c. Conspiracy on the large scale often suggested would be impossible to conceal in the United States, esp. since informants could expect to receive large royalties, etc. Note that Robert Kennedy, Attorney General at the time and John F.

CIA Document #1035-960

RE: Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report

1. Our Concern. From the day of President Kennedy's assassination on, there has been speculation about the responsibility for his murder. Although this was stemmed for a time by the Warren Commission report, (which appeared at the end of September 1964), various writers have now had time to scan the Commission's published report and documents for new pretexts for questioning, and there has been a new wave of books and articles criticizing the Commission's findings. In most cases the critics have speculated as to the existence of some kind of conspiracy, and often they have implied that the Commission itself was involved. Presumably as a result of the increasing challenge to the Warren Commission's report, a public opinion poll recently indicated that 46% of the American public did not think that Oswald acted alone, while more than half of those polled thought that the Commission had left some questions unresolved. Doubtless polls abroad would show similar, or possibly more adverse results.

2. This trend of opinion is a matter of concern to the U.S. government, including our organization. The members of the Warren Commission were naturally chosen for their integrity, experience and prominence. They represented both major parties, and they and their staff were deliberately drawn from all sections of the country. Just because of the standing of the Commissioners, efforts to impugn their rectitude and wisdom tend to cast doubt on the whole leadership of American society. Moreover, there seems to be an increasing tendency to hint that President Johnson himself, as the one person who might be said to have benefited, was in some way responsible for the assassination.

Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government. Our organization itself is directly involved: among other facts, we contributed information to the investigation. Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments.

3. Action. We do not recommend that discussion of the assassination question be initiated where it is not already taking place. Where discussion is active [business] addresses are requested:

a. To discuss the publicity problem with [?] and friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors), pointing out that the Warren Commission made as thorough an investigation as humanly possible, that the charges of the critics are without serious foundation, and that further speculative discussion only plays into the hands of the opposition. Point out also that parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists. Urge them to use their influence to discourage unfounded and irresponsible speculation.

b. To employ propaganda assets to [negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to this guidance should provide useful background material for passing to assets. Our ploy should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (I) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (I) politically interested, (III) financially interested, (IV) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (V) infatuated with their own theories. In the course of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy may be to single out Epstein's theory for attack, using the attached Fletcher [?] article and Spectator piece for background. (Although Mark Lane's book is much less convincing that Epstein's and comes off badly where confronted by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.)

4. In private to media discussions not directed at any particular writer, or in attacking publications which may be yet forthcoming, the following arguments should be useful:

a. No significant new evidence has emerged which the Commission did not consider. The assassination is sometimes compared (e.g., by Joachim Joesten and Bertrand Russell) with the Dreyfus case; however, unlike that case, the attack on the Warren Commission have produced no new evidence, no new culprits have been convincingly identified, and there is no agreement among the critics. (A better parallel, though an imperfect one, might be with the Reichstag fire of 1933, which some competent historians (Fritz Tobias, AJ.P. Taylor, D.C. Watt) now believe was set by Vander Lubbe on his own initiative, without acting for either Nazis or Communists; the Nazis tried to pin the blame on the Communists, but the latter have been more successful in convincing the world that the Nazis were to blame.)

b. Critics usually overvalue particular items and ignore others. They tend to place more emphasis on the recollections of individual witnesses (which are less reliable and more divergent--and hence offer more hand-holds for criticism) and less on ballistics, autopsy, and photographic evidence. A close examination of the Commission's records will usually show that the conflicting eyewitness accounts are quoted out of context, or were discarded by the Commission for good and sufficient reason.

c. Conspiracy on the large scale often suggested would be impossible to conceal in the United States, esp. since informants could expect to receive large royalties, etc. Note that Robert Kennedy, Attorney General at the time and John F. Kennedy's brother, would be the last man to overlook or conceal any conspiracy. And as one reviewer pointed out, Congressman Gerald R. Ford would hardly have held his tongue for the sake of the Democratic administration, and Senator Russell would have had every political interest in exposing any misdeeds on the part of Chief Justice Warren. A conspirator moreover would hardly choose a location for a shooting where so much depended on conditions beyond his control: the route, the speed of the cars, the moving target, the risk that the assassin would be discovered. A group of wealthy conspirators could have arranged much more secure conditions.

d. Critics have often been enticed by a form of intellectual pride: they light on some theory and fall in love with it; they also scoff at the Commission because it did not always answer every question with a flat decision one way or the other. Actually, the make-up of the Commission and its staff was an excellent safeguard against over-commitment to any one theory, or against the illicit transformation of probabilities into certainties.

e. Oswald would not have been any sensible person's choice for a co-conspirator. He was a ""loner,"" mixed up, of questionable reliability and an unknown quantity to any professional intelligence service.

6252,"&gt;Abu Zubaydah, a man once called al-Qaeda’s “chief of operations,” appears to be at the center of an unraveling of the official myth behind al Qaeda.  After his capture in early 2002, Zubaydah was the first “detainee” known to be tortured.  The information allegedly obtained from his torture played a large part in the creation of the official account of 9/11 and in the justification for the continued use of such torture techniques.  Yet in September, 2009, the U.S. government admitted that Zubaydah was never a member or associate of al Qaeda at all.  These facts raise an alarming number of questions about the veracity of our knowledge about al Qaeda, and the true identity of the people who are said to be behind the 9/11 attacks...  

&gt;...The 9/11 Commission called Zubaydah an “Al Qaeda associate,” a “long-time ally of Bin Ladin,” a “Bin Ladin lieutenant,” and an “al Qaeda lieutenant.”[1] The Commission’s claims were somewhat contradictory in that Zubaydah was, in the Commission’s report, represented as both an al Qaeda leader and simply a terrorist colleague who collaborated in the training and recruiting of operatives.  For example, the Commission reported that Zubaydah “helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan” [Khalden Camp], and that Bin Laden had an agreement with Zubaydah to “conduct reciprocal recruiting efforts whereby promising trainees at the camps would be invited to join al Qaeda.”  It was unclear why a “Bin Laden lieutenant” would need such a reciprocal agreement with Bin Laden.

Long suspected but holy shit! 


&gt;Naming the names

&gt;The academics identified by these emails as cooperating with industry and PR firms include:

&gt;Profs. Bruce Chassy (University of Illinois) and Alan McHughen (University of California, Riverside) who worked together to destroy the credibility of Russian scientist and GMO critic Irina Ermakova.

&gt;They persuaded the journal Nature Biotechnology to interview Ermakova about her research and describe it. This interview was followed by a detailed critique of her research (about which none of the authors were expert). Ermakova was neither told of the critique nor given a chance to answer it. This whole elaborate subterfuge required her to be sent a dummy proof of the article she thought she was publishing in the journal.

&gt;Prof. Calestuous Juma (Harvard University) longtime advocate of GMOs for Africa.

&gt;Prof. Wayne Parrott (University of Georgia) a serial intervener in academic GMO debates.

&gt;Prof. Roger Beachy (Danforth Center, formerly USAID). Beachy is the principle living exponent of a classic biotech strategy: to respond rapidly to a report or publication critical of some aspect of the technology with a multi-author ‘rebuttal‘.

&gt;Thus the inaugural report of the Bioscience Resource Project on the genome damage caused by genetic engineering (A. K. Wilson, J. R. Latham and R. A. Steinbrecher 2006) was met, even before formal publication, with both barrels from 23 professors, including Roger Beachy (Altpeter et al 2005)].

&gt;Prof. Ron Herring (Cornell) who has helped to promote GMOs in India and fought todefuse the farmer suicide debate in India.

&gt;Prof. C S Prakash (Tuskegee University) is the convener of the influential listserv AgBioWorld. AgBioWorld was the all-important conduit for a petition signed by 3,000 scientists calling for the retraction of a 2001 scientific paper showing GMO contamination of Mexican corn (Quist and Chapela 2001).

&gt;As detailed in an article called ‘The Fake Persuaders‘, the scientists who initiated the petition, and made inaccurate and inflammatory statements about the authors, were not real people. However, their emails could be traced back to servers belonging to Monsanto or Bivings, a PR company that was working with Monsanto at the time.

&gt;Prof. Nina Fedoroff (Penn State) is the most prominent of all of the scientists looped into all of the Times emails. Nina Fedoroff was the 2011-2012 President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The AAAS is the foremost scientific body in the US.

&gt;During her Presidency, Fedoroff, who is also a contributor to the NY Times, used her position to coordinated and sign a letter on behalf of 60 prominent scientists. This letter was sent to EPA as part of an effort to defeat a pesticide regulatory effort.

&gt;The real coordinator was Monsanto but Fedoroff participated in phone conferences and email exchanges with them (including with the prominent lobbyist Stanley Abramson) and gets credit in the emails for “moving the ball far down the field”. Yet Nina Fedoroff is not once named in the main article and nowhere at all is her position noted.

&gt;So the story that academia’s most vocal GMO defenders, and some of its most prominent scientists, are copied into these emails is missing. The focus on individuals like Folta occludes a demonstration, for the first time ever, of long-suspected and intricate coordination and cooperation among them...

&gt;Notability


[FRINGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fringe_theories)

&gt;For a fringe theory to be considered notable it is not sufficient that it has been discussed, positively or negatively, by groups or individuals – even if those groups are notable enough for a Wikipedia article themselves. **To be notable, a topic must receive significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject.** Otherwise it is not notable enough for a dedicated article in Wikipedia.    


****  

&gt;Subjects receive attention in Wikipedia in proportion to the level of detail in the sources from which the article is written. For example, if the only references to a particular subject are in news sources, then a level of detail which is greater than that which appears in these news sources is inappropriate, because Wikipedia policy prohibits original research. The no original research policy strongly encourages the collection and organization of information from existing secondary sources, and allows for careful use of primary sources.  



&gt;News organizations  




&gt;News sources often contain both factual content and opinion content. **""News reporting"" from well-established news outlets is generally considered to be reliable for statements of fact**(though even the most reputable reporting sometimes contains errors). News reporting from less-established outlets is generally considered less reliable for statements of fact. Most newspapers also reprint items from news agencies such as BBC News, Reuters, Interfax, Agence France-Presse or the Associated Press, which are responsible for accuracy. The agency should be cited in addition to the newspaper that reprinted it.  

If it's not reported it's not news applies to Wikipedia. Maybe they'll address the current state of the MSM and offer some balance? If not it appears censorship will be the continued route until they can't get away with it any longer.

The material was then transported to CFB Shearwater, where it was assembled and inspected by over 350 investigators from multiple organizations, such as the TSB, NTSB, FAA, AAIB, Boeing, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Swissair.[27][28]  


&gt;As each piece of wreckage was brought in, it was carefully cleaned with fresh water, sorted, and weighed. The item was then placed in a specific area of a hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed and moved to a custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar.[29] Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.  


&gt;The lack of flight recorder data for the last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was a major factor in its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.[30]

KSM talked about bombs in building and placing them *high*(?) enough to prevent people from escaping. This this tidbit from President Bush is interesting because KSM is the accused mastermind/architect of the 9/11 plan and subsequent to planes hitting the building a theory for bombs in the WTC was also born the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 suppressed and not investigated. Did KSM hire someone to place bombs in the building? I've been told the sources for terrorist funding wasn't fully investigated. I fear it's some kind of conspiracy. After 14 years we really need to get to what KSM did and didn't do.

Badly needed solidification.

Any sources for ""disrupted plots"" available in the public record that mention placing explosives *high* enough to prevent escape? Considering it doesn't make sense it should stand out in the case against KSM. Anyone?  
 

&gt;...as uncovered by questioning KSM.   

Maybe we'll get confirmation from the Gitmo trial? 

&gt;In my opinion, this ""explosives"" speech does not help in that endeavor.  

With the theory bombs in the building being being born on the morning of September 11, 2001, and without any investigation for bombs in the building, KSM saying bombs in the building needs further investigation.

&gt;Miko is unlike any NFL spouse I've ever met in some 25 years covering the sport. Most keep a distance from the NFL's inner workings. Most never go near the press. Almost all never publicly criticize the NFL, particularly when their husband is still in the league. They're too afraid....   


&gt;There is no box that neatly fits Miko. She is a brilliant woman, a self-starter, an unabashed user of curse words, but she is also respectful to people who treat her with respect.

First, there have been sharp increases in the amounts and numbers of chemical herbicides applied to GM crops, and still further increases — the largest in a generation — are scheduled to occur in the next few years. **Second, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified glyphosate, the herbicide most widely used on GM crops, as a “probable human carcinogen”1 and classified a second herbicide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), as a “possible human carcinogen.”2**

&gt;These developments suggest that GM foods and the herbicides applied to them may pose hazards to human health that were not examined in previous assessments. We believe that the time has therefore come to thoroughly reconsider all aspects of the safety of plant biotechnology. The National Academy of Sciences has convened a new committee to reassess the social, economic, environmental, and human health effects of GM crops. This development is welcome, but the committee's report is not expected until at least 2016.

&gt;Furthermore, he graduated in mathematics, he is a lecturer in geopolitics at the Royal College of Higher Military Education of the Kingdom of Morocco, director of the Revue française de géopolitique (French Review of Geopolitics (annual, Ellipses, Paris)) and director of several collections published by Ellipses in Paris (Grands enjeux, Taupe-Niveau, Référence géopolitique... High Stakes, Taupe-Niveau, geopolitical Reference...). From 2003 to 2009 he was a lecturer at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland (history of political ideas). He taught at the Collège interarmées de défense (CID: French Joint Defense College) where since 1999 he is in charge of geopolitics courses.  He is also a higher officer in the French Naval Reserve.

***  


&gt;**Following the publication of his book Chronique du choc des civilisations** (""Chronicle of the clash of civilizations""), Aymeric Chauprade was accused by the French journalist Jean Guisnel[5] of expressing indulgence concerning September 11 conspiracy theories.* **This earned him, at the beginning of February 2009, being deprived of his chair at the Joint Defense College,** *by an express decision of the supervising Minister Hervé Morin.*[6][7][8]


&gt;During this controversy, Aymeric Chauprade (which filed a complaint against the Minister as well as against the newspaper Le Point)  


&gt;**Administrative Court ruled in favour of A. Chauprade and suspended the decision of Hervé Morin, saying that the minister had violated a ""fundamental freedom"", the Human Rights defense.**[12][13] On 1 June 2011, the **Paris Administrative Court confirmed the annulment of the decision made by Morin stressing that it resulted ""from an irregular procedure""**, according to the wording of the judgement.[14]

6323,"&gt;From the New Jersey Law Journal, August 4, 2003:  

&gt;**“The Sept. 11 investigation was supervised by Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff, head of the U.S. Criminal Justice Division,""**  
  
  


&gt;*More on Chertoff from the New Yorker, November 5, 2001:*  


&gt;“Since the September 11th terrorist attacks, Chertoff’s office has become the funnel for what is probably the most important criminal investigation in American history, as prosecutors and F.B.I. investigators pour in to seek the boss’s approval. **What leads can we use from the search of a hijacker’s car in Portland, Maine? Where do the hijackers? credit-card records lead”? For day-to-day decisions, Chertoff has the last word”?** 


***  

&gt;[Michael Chertoff, FBI, 9/11](http://aldeilis.net/english/michael-chertoff-fbi-911/) 


&gt;A political partisan, Michael Chertoff became special counsel to the Whitewater Commission established in 1994 by the Republican-majority Congress to investigate the involvement of Bill and Hilary Clinton in real estate deals in Arkansas and other business deals. Now widely regarded as a political witch hunt...  the investigation that ultimately failed to find that the Clintons had done anything illegal.  

***  

&gt;Chertoff is a longtime member and activist in the Federalist Society. ...Association members believe that the Constitution and the country’s laws should primarily serve to ensure order and social orthodoxy rather than democracy and human rights.
***  

&gt;During his short stint as federal appeals court judge in the 3 rd Court District, Chertoff demonstrated his generally dismissive attitude toward asylum claims–ruling against immigrants in 14 of 18 immigration cases. In one case, he denied asylum to a Bangladeshi man who was imprisoned, severely beaten in jail, and forced to denounce his dissident political party. Despite his requiring 19 days of medical care after his release, Chertoff denied asylum on the grounds that the treatment didn’t constitute torture. (3) Chertoff also overruled a lower-court immigration judge’s decision to question the credibility of the asylum petition of a Chinese man who was seeking refuge because his wife was involuntarily sterilized.
***  

&gt;As the architect of the post-September 11th initiatives on the domestic war on terror, Chertoff supervised the round-up of 750 Arabs and other Muslims on suspicion of immigration violations. Not one of the almost exclusively Muslim “detainees? was indicted for terrorism-related crimes. 
***  

&gt;Chertoff, who also coordinated the aggressive questioning of more than 5,000 Arab Americans immediately after the 9/11   
***  

&gt;According to Chertoff, “We are at a transition point in the evolution of legal doctrine to govern the armed conflict of terror.” 

***  
&gt;Michael Chertoff, a rabbi’s son from northern New Jersey, is widely respected for his razor-sharp mind...

[9/11 AND CHERTOFF: COUSIN WROTE 9/11 PROPAGANDA FOR PM](http://aldeilis.net/english/cousin-of-dept-of-homeland-security-head-wrote-911-propaganda-for-popular-mechanics/)  



&gt;But the March 2005 issue of Popular Mechanics (PM) plumbs new depths of nepotism and Hearst-style ""yellow journalism"" with its cover story about 9/11. **PM's senior researcher, 25-year-old Benjamin Chertoff, authored a propagandistic cover story entitled ""Debunking 9/11 Lies"" which seeks to discredit all independent 9/11 research that challenges the official version of events.**  


&gt;This means that Hearst paid Benjamin Chertoff to write an article supporting the seriously flawed explanation that is based on a practically non-existent investigation of the terror event that directly led to the creation of the massive national security department his ""cousin"" now heads.  

***   

&gt;Because the manager of public relations for Popular Mechanics didn't respond to repeated calls from American Free Press, I called Benjamin Chertoff, the magazine's ""senior researcher,"" directly.

&gt;Chertoff said he was the ""senior researcher"" of the piece. **When asked if he was related to Michael Chertoff, he said, ""I don't know.""** Clearly uncomfortable about discussing the matter further, he told me that all questions about the article should be put to the publicist ? the one who never answers the phone.  


&gt;Benjamin's mother in Pelham, New York, however, was more willing to talk. Asked if Benjamin was related to the new Secretary of Homeland Security, Judy said, ""Yes, of course, he is a cousin.""

&gt;On 12 September 2001, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1368 (2001) in which the Council condemned “in the strongest terms the horrifying terrorist attacks which took place on 11 September 2001 in New York, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania and regards such acts, like any act of international terrorism, as a threat to international peace and security.”  

&gt;The resolution “calls on all States to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these terrorist attacks and stresses that those responsible for aiding, supporting or harboring the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these acts will be held accountable.”

&gt;On 28th September 2001, the UN Security Council adopted another resolution (No. 1373 (2001)) dealing with the same matter, at this time under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which made the resolution binding upon UN member states. In that resolution, which equally referred to the attacks of 11. September 2001, the Council required of all States to:

&gt;“(e) Ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice and ensure that, in addition to any other measures against them, such terrorist acts are established as serious criminal offenses in domestic laws and regulations and that the punishment duly reflects the seriousness of such terrorist acts;

&gt;(f) Afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal investigations or criminal proceedings relating to the financing or support of terrorist acts, including assistance in obtaining evidence in their possession necessary for the proceedings;

[Some international law issues arising from the events of 9/11](http://aldeilis.net/english/some-international-law-issues-arising-from-the-events-of-911/)  


***  


&gt;The events of 9/11 are of crucial importance with regard to the current development of international law for various reasons:

&gt;(a)  Questions arise about how states designate events such as 9/11. Are such events an ""armed attack"", domestic mass murder, crimes against humanity?  Each designation  leads to different responses. The US government choose to designate the events as an ""armed attack"" in order to justify the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan and avoid a criminal investigation.  Are states free to designate acts such as the murder of 3000 people as they wish?     

&gt;(b)  How can a legal observer assess whether the designation of 9/11 as an ""armed attack"" was justified?  What mechanism exists to challenge such determination? Was the response to this alleged ""armed attack"" commensurate with customary international law and the obligations under the UN Charter?  Are states under the obligation, under international law, to prove that an ""armed attack"" from another state occurred before invoking self-defense? What are the minimal standards of evidence?  Is secret evidence that an attack emanated from another state, sufficient to invoke self-defense?

&gt;(c)  Did the Security Council act in good faith, when it decided 24 hours after the events that the events of 9/11 were an act of ""international terrorism""  when at that time the Council did not and could not know who were the perpetrators of this mass murder? [In fact the Security Council was never presented with any such evidence]. Are there any principles in international law which could be invoked to deal with a situation in which the Security Council makes legal determinations on contrived, secret, fabricated or non-existent evidence?  What are the legal consequences of a determination by the Security Council made in bad faith, or as part of a conspiracy of its members?  Can international law, as a set of norms, be used to assess whether the Security Council acts in good faith and on the base of true facts? Are States legally required to presume the good faith of the Security Council?

&gt;(d)  Does the duty to protect the right to life under the ICCPR, which the US has ratified, extend to the obligation of the contracting parties to ""adequately investigate"" the arbitrary deprivation of life within their own jurisdictions?  If so, what is the exact content and scope of such an obligation? Did regional human rights courts identify and define an obligation to investigate the violation of the right to life?

&gt;(e) Does the Security Council possess the right, under the UN Charter, to enforce the investigation and prosecution of crimes against humanity?  What measures can the United Nations take, in he view of the failure by the US to adequately investigate the events of 9/11?

&gt;(f)  Does the designation ""international terrorism"" for particular acts bring the impugned acts under the realm of international criminal law? If so, are there any appropriate rules of international criminal law applicable to ""international terrorism""? If not, what is the appropriate legal regime to deal with such acts?  Is ""international terrorism"" a criminal offense that should be dealt according to the norms of criminal law?  Is there any base in customary international law that would support the establishment of a sui generis legal regime for ""international terrorism""?

Not this one it's theoretical. Time has shown the 2001 information that claims to demonstrate a ""very serious threat"" to the U.S.A. to now be merely Pickard's assumption. The attacks he assumed would take place didn't pan out. Considering it's central to his case it now serves to undermine the need to toss aside due process. Pickard claims assassination kills less civilians than conventional methods but he doesn't mention ""drones"" and the civilian deaths from them. At the end of the day due process was considered the best argument against assassinations. *This article theorizes about killing terrorists without due process and against generally accepted International law.*   


Executive order 2333 and it not being against the law for the CIA to assassinated but directive from the President was a great find. Great informational article.

The term truther appears to be self-chosen. Jon Gold, an activist in the 9/11 Truth movement, wrote on his blog recently that the term originated in late 2004 when he was bucking up a fellow activist who “was tired of being ridiculed,” telling him, “You’re a 9/11 truther, don’t let them get to you.” Gold added, “In the back of my mind, I thought of the term ‘Quaker.’”

6392,"To see the GMO fraud let's focus on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  


&gt;*The Food Additive Amendment of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act institutes
a precautionary approach and requires that new additives to food must be
demonstrated safe before they are marketed.* (21 U.S.C. Sec. 321)
An official Senate report described the intent of the amendment as follows:
*“While Congress did not want to unnecessarily stifle technological advances, it
nevertheless intended that additives created through new technologies be proven
safe before they go to market.* (S. Rep. 2422, 1958 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5301- 2
(emphasis added))  

**  

&gt;**Although the FDA admits that the various genetic materials implanted in bioengineered organisms are within the amendment’s purview, it claims they are
exempt from testing because they are generally recognized as safe (GRAS).**

&gt;**However**, **the FDA’s regulations state that substances added to food that were
not in use prior to 1958 cannot qualify as GRAS unless they meet two
requirements.**  **Not only must they be acknowledged as safe by an overwhelming
consensus of experts, but this consensus must be based on “scientific
procedures” – which ordinarily entails studies published in peer-reviewed
journals.** (21 CFR Sec. 170.30 (a-b) ) [Source](http://3dd.816.myftpupload.com/article-on-illegality-of-fda/)

The FDA violated its own rule and unleashed a Frankenstein's monster on an unwitting public. 
The big concern starts when we go digging for mention of safety in the original documents. 

Take the first GMO product *Flavr savr* for example the company that produced this states that rat tests show it's safe. The FDA rules say ""overwhelming consensus"" in the form of peer reviewed papers is needed (independent papers too) for approval. What passes for approval in the linked PDF's is the company refuting a hand full of comments at a ""open comment"" event. [USDA APHIS permits and documentation](http://www.aphis.usda.gov/biotechnology/petitions_table_pending.shtml)  

***  

&gt;FDA regulations further stipulate that *these scientific procedures must
provide a demonstration of safety and that GRAS substances “…require the same
quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of
the substance as a food additive.”* (21 CFR Sec. 170.30(b)) Thus, it’s clear that
the GRAS exemption is not supposed to reduce the degree of testing but rather to
relieve a producer from performing new tests for substances already known to be
safe on the basis of previous ones. 
***  

The FDA wants ""overwhelming consensus"" but we find not even a ""consensus"" exists.  
 

&gt;[Statement: No scientific consensus on GMO safety](http://www.ensser.org/increasing-public-information/no-scientific-consensus-on-gmo-safety/)

&gt;*As scientists, physicians, academics, and experts from disciplines relevant to the scientific, legal, social and safety assessment aspects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs),[1] we strongly reject claims by GM seed developers and some scientists, commentators, and journalists that there is a “scientific consensus” on GMO safety[2] [3] [4] and that the debate on this topic is “over”.[5]*  

&gt;*We feel compelled to issue this statement because the claimed consensus on GMO safety does not exist. **The claim that it does exist is misleading and misrepresents the currently available scientific evidence and the broad diversity of opinion among scientists on this issue.** Moreover, the claim encourages a climate of complacency that could lead to a lack of regulatory and scientific rigour and appropriate caution, potentially endangering the health of humans, animals, and the environment.

&gt;*Science and society do not proceed on the basis of a constructed consensus, as current knowledge is always open to well-founded challenge and disagreement...*  
  


***  
We can see the public started consuming GMO's long before achieving ""overwhelming consensus"" by ""peer reviewed papers"". The FDA let us down probably due to underfunding,  r policy changes helped along by George H. Bush, industry pressure and industry being the only ones capable of testing in the first place. 


We can be comforted by the fact countries are [banning (blue) and forcing GMO's to label](http://web.archive.org/web/20150823202743/http://naturalsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/gmo-foods-label-world.png) which Monsanto called a ""scull and crossbones"" for its gmo products. Apparently the ""Dark Act bill"" to not allow the public gmo information only stands a 30% of passing in the Senate and with at least 13 states introducing labeling bills, Campbells moving toward gmo labeling (after spending millions to defeat label efforts) and the public waking up to the fraud we can see the end in sight. **The European Union recently *released* member countries to decide if they want GMO's.** That's a huge deal and we'll see what bans continue and if the coveted ""green status"" is worth losing by entertaining risky GMO's.

2014 Paper.
[Reassessing the Plastic Hinge Model for Energy Dissipation of Axially Loaded Columns](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jstruc/2014/795257/)  

&gt;*While our test program was very limited in the both the number and types of experiments undertaken, our findings suggest that the energy dissipation of axially loaded columns depends on various parameters, namely, slenderness of the column, tensile strength and the ductility of the material, and so forth, and its estimation is not a trivial matter. While the plastic hinge model does have merit in its simplicity and may be better suited for analysis of laterally loaded members, its application to axially loaded columns warrants caution. There clearly are limitations to applying such a model when dealing with structural members that primarily resist axial loads. **Overall, there is a need by the structural engineering community to further investigate the issue of energy dissipation potentials of steel columns and their role in mitigating progressive collapse of buildings.**

&gt;Could the source of sulfur be as simple as -""acid rain""?

&gt;Could nearby ocean salts such a sodium sulfate play a role?

Slide 83.  
&gt;At This Time We don't Know!  
***  

At this time we do know!     

Dr. Astaneh-Asl's account places an 8 hour timeframe on the eutectic action that caused the severe steel wastage. Severe corrosion, deep mystery, [novel phenomenon](https://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html), evaporation, very unusual event, etc.  
 


&gt;One piece Dr. Astaneh-Asl saw was a charred horizontal I-beam from 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper that collapsed from fire eight hours after the attacks. The beam, so named because its cross-section looks like a capital I, had clearly endured searing temperatures. Parts of the flat top of the I, once five-eighths of an inch thick, had vaporized.  

&gt;Less clear was whether the beam had been charred after the collapse, as it lay in the pile of burning rubble, or whether it had been engulfed in the fire that led to the building's collapse, which would provide a more telling clue.  


&gt;The answer lay in the beam's twisted shape. As weight pushed down, the center portion had buckled outward.  


&gt;''This tells me it buckled while it was attached to the column,'' not as it fell, Dr. Astaneh-Asl said, adding, ''It had burned first, then buckled.''  [Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/science/scarred-steel-holds-clues-and-remedies.html)   
***  

&gt;For example, valuable information could come from analysis of the blackened steel from the floors engulfed in flame after the airplane collisions. Steel flanges had been reduced from an inch thick to paper thin, Astaneh said. [Source](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2001/10/03_grou.html)  
 
We need to know how the ""eutectic action"" happened that's why astaneh's timeframe is important. [Can you imagine 15.8mm of steel gone in 8](http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/vbimghost.php?do=displayimg&amp;imgid=27691) days or an inch of steel turning to a ""[razor sharpness](https://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)"" in just 2 weeks?   


[Dr. Astaneh-Asl findings are similar to FEMA's](http://imgur.com/ijKf1J6) ""It is also possible that the phenomenon started prior to collapse and accelerated the weakening of the steel structure. A detailed study into the mechanisms of this phenomenon is needed to determine what risk, if any, is presented to existing steel structures exposed to severe and long-burning fires. 

Now we can see why after NIST said it would address ""all major recommendations in the (FEMA) report"" they couldn't dare mention the swiss cheese steel!  If a spontaneously created mixture  in the WTC office fires involving drywall releasing sulfur gas can melt steel in 8 hours we need to find out specifically how this happened.

&gt;Published on Dec 31, 2014
&gt;Canadian filmmaker Adnan Zuberi joins James to discuss his award-winning 2013 documentary, [9/11 in the Academic Community: Academia’s Treatment of Critical Perspectives on 9/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F2TWZ1xfJI). Zuberi also discuss his own experiences as a university student contributing to his creation of the film, as well as more recent projects addressing geopolitics and the “war on terror.”

&gt;9/11 in the Academic Community features interviews with several notable academics, including John McMurtry, Graeme MacQueen, Lynn Margulis, and Walter G. Pitman, to examine scholars’ critical perspectives on the events of September 11, 2001 and how these have been received in their respective academic fields. *Contrary to the widely-held notion that academe is a bastion of free thought and inquiry, university faculty and administrators are often indifferent, if not hostile toward, colleagues that study or take public stances on controversial topics.*

&gt;**Using this context, the film also addresses dilemmas within university settings, including the commonplace use of terms that act as “thought-stoppers” in academic discourse, and the profound implications of the fact that the official 9/11 narrative is based on the testimony of tortured prisoners.**  


&gt;Zuberi also addresses his experience in developing strategies for appealing to academic community constituents that stand apart from standard appeals to facts and reason that have come to characterize the truth community.

&gt;9/11 in the Academic Community was awarded for “Documentary Achievement” at the University of Toronto Film Festival. Since its release, has also received the praise of prominent professors and university administrators alike.

6429,"&gt;...I tend to only focus on what can be proven using science and logic.  

Most logical and reasonable. 
 
To see the fraud let's focus on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  


&gt;*The Food Additive Amendment of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act institutes
a precautionary approach and requires that new additives to food must be
demonstrated safe before they are marketed.* (21 U.S.C. Sec. 321)
An official Senate report described the intent of the amendment as follows:
*“While Congress did not want to unnecessarily stifle technological advances, it
nevertheless intended that additives created through new technologies be proven
safe before they go to market.* (S. Rep. 2422, 1958 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5301- 2
(emphasis added))  


&gt;*Although the FDA admits that the various genetic materials implanted in bioengineered organisms are within the amendment’s purview, it claims they are
exempt from testing because they are generally recognized as safe (GRAS).*

&gt;**However**, *the FDA’s regulations state that substances added to food that were
not in use prior to 1958 cannot qualify as GRAS unless they meet two
requirements.*  **Not only must they be acknowledged as safe by an overwhelming
consensus of experts, but this consensus must be based on “scientific
procedures” – which ordinarily entails studies published in peer-reviewed
journals.** (21 CFR Sec. 170.30 (a-b) ) [Source](http://3dd.816.myftpupload.com/article-on-illegality-of-fda/)

The FDA violated its own rule and unleashed a Frankenstein's monster on an unwitting public. 
The big concern starts when we go digging for mention of safety in the original documents. 

Take the first GMO product *Flavr savr* for example the company that produced this states that rat tests show it's safe. The FDA rules say ""overwhelming consensus"" in the form of peer reviewed papers is needed (independent papers too) for approval. What passes for approval in the linked PDF's is the company refuting a hand full of comments at a ""open comment"" event. [USDA APHIS permits and documentation](http://www.aphis.usda.gov/biotechnology/petitions_table_pending.shtml)  

***  

&gt;FDA regulations further stipulate that *these scientific procedures must
provide a demonstration of safety and that GRAS substances “…require the same
quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of
the substance as a food additive.”* (21 CFR Sec. 170.30(b)) Thus, it’s clear that
the GRAS exemption is not supposed to reduce the degree of testing but rather to
relieve a producer from performing new tests for substances already known to be
safe on the basis of previous ones. 
***  

The FDA wants ""overwhelming consensus"" but we find not even a ""consensus"" exists.  
 

&gt;[Statement: No scientific consensus on GMO safety](http://www.ensser.org/increasing-public-information/no-scientific-consensus-on-gmo-safety/)

&gt;*As scientists, physicians, academics, and experts from disciplines relevant to the scientific, legal, social and safety assessment aspects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs),[1] we strongly reject claims by GM seed developers and some scientists, commentators, and journalists that there is a “scientific consensus” on GMO safety[2] [3] [4] and that the debate on this topic is “over”.[5]*  

&gt;*We feel compelled to issue this statement because the claimed consensus on GMO safety does not exist. **The claim that it does exist is misleading and misrepresents the currently available scientific evidence and the broad diversity of opinion among scientists on this issue.** Moreover, the claim encourages a climate of complacency that could lead to a lack of regulatory and scientific rigour and appropriate caution, potentially endangering the health of humans, animals, and the environment.

&gt;*Science and society do not proceed on the basis of a constructed consensus, as current knowledge is always open to well-founded challenge and disagreement...*  
  


***  
We can see the public started consuming GMO's long before achieving ""overwhelming consensus"" by ""peer reviewed papers"". The FDA let us down probably due to underfunding,  r policy changes helped along by George H. Bush, industry pressure and industry being the only ones capable of testing in the first place. 


We can be comforted by the fact countries are [banning (blue) and forcing GMO's to label](http://web.archive.org/web/20150823202743/http://naturalsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/gmo-foods-label-world.png) which Monsanto called a ""scull and crossbones"" for its gmo products. Apparently the ""Dark Act bill"" to not allow the public gmo information only stands a 30% of passing in the Senate and with at least 13 states introducing labeling bills, Campbells moving toward gmo labeling (after spending millions to defeat label efforts) and the public waking up to the fraud we can see the end in sight. **The European Union recently *released* member countries to decide if they want GMO's.** That's a huge deal and we'll see what bans continue and if the coveted ""green status"" is worth losing by entertaining risky GMO's.  



Trolls don't want us looking at the details which means they are supporting the devil.

Found this. 

&gt;Task 1 is achieved with aerosol bombs of decapacitating gas hidden in luggage. The gas is fentanyl, the extremely potent opiate used by Russian forces to end the hostage crisis in the theater in Chechnya.

&gt;Time: 2.15pm
Venue: Court 1 Hastings Magistrates Court, Bohemia Rd, Hastings TN34 1ND

&gt;Summary Overview

&gt;On 23rd March Matt Campbell of Sussex, United Kingdom, will go to court against the BBC and will claim that the BBC is in violation of UK anti-terrorist legislation in the way that they have covered up evidence relating to 9/11 and evidence relating to the murder of his brother Geoff. Geoff Campbell was killed while inside the North Tower of the World Trade Centre on September 11th, 2001. Mr Campbell will claim that he has reasonable cause to believe that the BBC has been wilfully complicit in the deliberate cover up of vital and incontrovertible evidence relating to how his brother Geoff was killed and that as such the BBC is guilty of complicity with terrorism.

&gt;Representing Mr Campbell’s case against the BBC is senior litigation solicitor and human rights activist Mahtab Aziz who has represented a number of well-known public figures such as Imran Khan, the former Pakistan cricketer captain turned politician, Herbie Hide the former 2 time World Heavyweight boxing champion and a number of other internationally well-known artists, singers and sportsmen. Mr Aziz also advised British Film Director Tony Rooke at Horsham Magistrates Court in 2013 for his similar case against the BBC’s alleged cover up of 9/11 evidence. That particular court case between Mr Rooke and the BBC was attended by several hundred members of the public and by independent journalists from across Europe where they witnessed Mr Rooke achieve a partial victory against the BBC.

&gt;Mr Campbell will also be calling on the support of a number of expert witnesses.

&gt;Legal details of Mr Campbell’s court case 

Mr Campbell claims that the BBC is refusing to inform the public of incontrovertible scientific evidence relating to free fall acceleration during the collapse of World Trade Centre Building 7, and the BBC appears to be supporting a cover up of the true events of that day. He is therefore pleading “Not Guilty” to having an appropriate TV licence as he has ”reasonable cause” to suspect that by funding the BBC through his TV Licence Fees he would be supporting the purposes of terrorism and he would be guilty of breaking the law under Article 15 Section 3 of the Terrorism Act.

&gt;**He will also claim that the BBC is guilty of an offence under Section 38B of the Terrorism Act 2000 as amended by Section 117 of Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. Under Section 38B(2) of the TA 2000 if a person without reasonable excuse, fails to disclose information falling within Section 38B(1). A person may commit this offence through total inactivity (by not answering police questions or by not volunteering information), through the partial suppression of information, or by relating a false account when the true facts are known...**


&gt;Mr Campbell’s court case against the BBC is based upon the allegation that he has reasonable cause to believe that the BBC has been deliberately withholding the available evidence which supposedly proves his belief that the three towers were brought down through controlled demolition. Mr Campbell claims that numerous professional experts from around the world and more than 500 members of the public have provided detailed evidence and written requests to the BBC demanding that they adhere to their Editorial Guidelines and their Royal Charter and show the public what he claims is incontrovertible scientific evidence and eye-witness evidence. He claims that this evidence proves beyond any doubt that his brother Geoff was murdered in a way that is very different to what he has been told by government officials and by the coroner. Mr Campbell aims to present to the court in Sussex evidence showing that the BBC has been deliberately covering up this vital information from the public.

&gt;Mr Campbell believes that by covering up this evidence the BBC are supporting those terrorists to get away with their crime which included the murder of his brother. Therefore, according to Mr Campbell, to pay his TV Licence Fee to the BBC would in fact be a criminal act according to Section 15, Article 3 of the Terrorism Act. Mr Campbell believes that he has a situation of conflict of law whereby he is prepared to continue paying his TV Licence Fee, but not if it goes to the BBC, because to provide funds to the BBC would be to provide funds to an organisation that is supporting an act of terrorism, according to Mr Campbell and his lawyers.

&gt;Evidence to support Mr Campbell’s allegation of controlled demolition

&gt;The following are some of the points of evidence that Mr Campbell cites as supporting the allegation that the three towers that collapsed on 9/11 collapsed due to controlled, explosive demolition. This is not a complete list of Mr Campbell’s evidence:

&gt;1. **Confirmed free fall of WTC Building 7**  
World Trade Centre Building 7 fell at free-fall acceleration for at least 2.25 seconds (105 feet/8 stories) as confirmed in 2008 by the official investigators NIST (National Institute for Standards &amp; Technology). This means that at least 8 stories of the building collapsed with absolutely zero structural resistance within them, and that all 80 of the core steel columns, and all of the steel beam cross connections for those 8 stories had to have been completely severed, all within a split second of each other in order to achieve the perfectly symmetrical free fall collapse that is seen in WTC Building 7. The only thing that can achieve this is controlled-demolition using carefully placed explosives and perfectly timed detonation. Controlled Demolition of a high rise tower cannot be prepared within a few hours. It takes weeks or months to plan and implement


&gt;3. **The BBC’s misinformation &amp; refusal to notify the public about critical and incontrovertible evidence**  
In 2007 the BBC ran a documentary which claimed that despite what hundreds of professional engineers, physicists, demolition experts, and scientists were claiming about free fall of WTC Building 7, they were in fact wrong and there was no free fall of WTC Building 7. Even after NIST, the official investigators, officially confirmed the existence of free fall in 2008 the BBC has refused to comply with the requirements of their own Editorial Guidelines and publicly correct their error about this absolutely vital issue. This is despite a number of professional experts and more than 500 members of the public making written requests in 2012 to the BBC for them to do so. The BBC still has not corrected this error and still has not informed the public of the quite incredible fact that in 2008 NIST officially confirmed the existence of free fall of WTC Building 7, which can only occur through controlled demolition.

&gt;In addition to this, a great deal more incontrovertible evidence supporting the controlled demolition of the three towers has been forwarded to the BBC by numerous professional experts and hundreds of the public, but the BBC has refused to show this evidence to the public. This includes eye witness testimonies from 118 first responder fire fighters on 9/11 who reported hearing or seeing explosions going off in all three towers. These eye witness reports were originally suppressed by the US government, but were later forced to be released through the Freedom of Information Act.

&gt;**4. BBC deliberately misleading the public with biased and inaccurate reporting**  
Despite having hundreds of people demanding that the BBC show the evidence described above, the BBC has refused to do this and have instead shown documentaries which are seemingly designed only to smear and discredit the reputation of the professional individuals and organisations bringing this evidence forward, and the BBC has instead presented information that is based on methodology that runs in direct contradiction to the BBC’s own Editorial Guidelines for providing accurate and impartial information. This has included such things as removing the sounds of huge explosions going off in WTC Building 7 moments before it collapsed during one of the BBC’s documentaries which was examining the claims of hundreds of professional experts that WTC Building 7 was brought down with explosives in a controlled demolition. Why would the BBC remove these sounds of explosions going off in a documentary aimed specifically at examining the claims that the collapse of the towers on 9/11 may have been due to explosives?

**Mr Campbell and his support team will be asking these questions and more in the upcoming court case.**

GE developers are increasingly avoiding regulation by engineering GE crops without inserting transgenes from APHIS’s “plant pest” list. USDA has declared these types of GE crops beyond its authority to regulate, so they receive no federal oversight before potential commercialization. This loophole makes public disclosure of all information related to the unregulated GE crop, like GE sorghum, all the more crucial.*  
  
 
&gt;*Crops escaping field trials: GE crops that escape the confines of field trials, called “unauthorized releases,” are of particular concern because these GE plants can live in the wild and cross with native plants, or contaminate related conventional or organic crops. Timely public disclosure of information related to releases from field trials is essential for mitigation of these potential harms. CFS has filed several FOIA requests regarding field trials to which APHIS failed to provide timely responses, jeopardizing local farmers and environments.*  
  


&gt;*In 2004, CFS filed a FOIA request related to field trials of GE “Roundup Ready” creeping bentgrass. APHIS delayed its response for over four years; meanwhile, the state of Oregon is still trying to find and destroy escaped feral populations of the GE bentgrass.  CFS made another FOIA request regarding GE bentgrass in 2010, to which APHIS took over 5 years to respond.
CFS has made three requests regarding GE wheat field trials since 2002 and APHIS has failed to provide a timely respond each time. In the first instance, CFS had to file a lawsuit to compel APHIS to respond. To date, APHIS has failed to make any response to date to CFS’s most recent request. GE wheat contaminated an Oregon wheat field in 2013, causing millions of dollars of lost revenue for wheat growers in the subsequent years as sensitive foreign markets temporally shut down.*  

&gt;This is the fourth time CFS has had to sue APHIS to compel compliance with FOIA, and is the most extensive challenge to APHIS’s pattern of unreasonable delays to date.

&gt;A commentator has attempted to ""debunk"" the findings of molten steel at Ground Zero, which I mention in my article below, [""Interrogating 9/11""](http://nafeez.blogspot.com/2006/09/interrogating-911.html). There are a number of problems with this approach, first and foremost which is the overriding ideological predisposition to ""prove"" that no molten steel was found. This is a disingenious position, as looking at the data itself, the sheer volume of people who witnessed the molten metal demonstrates that the phenomenon did exist. The vast majority of observers insisted that this was actually molten steel, not any other kind of metal, which was often seen to be dripping either directly off steel beams, or from the cores where the beams were originally erected. Now looking at the data in its totality, the insistence that it was not molten steel in the face of this credible testimony is simply bizarre. The insistence is not founded in fact, but merely in the assumption that all the observers at Ground Zero were wrong. My position is simply this:  


&gt;1. the data largely speaks for itself, and in the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary, should be taken at face value.  

&gt;2. whereas a final conclusion may not be deductible on this basis, preliminary probable inferences are justifiable on the basis of the available data.

&gt;3. such inferences based on reasonable grounds indicate an unresolved anomaly in the official narrative.

&gt;The anomaly could be consistent with a variety of interpretations. What I don't understand is the desire of some, such as the commentator, to completely deny that any such anomaly exists. This is, indeed, exactly what the official NIST investigation did, pretend that there was never any molten metal. I can accept that the findings of molten steel have not been forensically confirmed, but this is precisely because, as Thompson also documents, the Bush administration deliberately ensured that the materials were collected and scrapped before any such investigation was possible. We are, therefore, forced to work solely with the data that we do have, which is overwhelming and credible enough to justify the conclusion that an anomaly relating to the WTC collapse persists, and that independent investigation is necessary.

&gt;It is such independent investigation that the 9/11 families continue to call for, not to support some preconceived lunatic fringe theories, but to get to the unsullied truth -- not simply for the sake of their own ""closure"", but because the phenomenon of terrorism since 9/11 continues to play an integral role in the international system, and continues to kill and maim innocent civilians around the world.

&gt;Physical chemistry is a subject that bridges physics and chemistry. It involves the study of the interactions between matter and energy.

&gt;In your opinion, do you think thermite could've been used in these buildings to produce melted molybdenum and vaporized aluminosilicates, despite the fact that thermite burns at about 4000 F, 

I haven't found the answer. I assume other bombs were responsible for the higher temps.

&gt;Thermite 1,800 degrees celsius is 3,272 degrees fahrenheit.  

Even lower because adding sulfur to thermite lowers the maximum temperature. From a paper at the [Journal of 9/11 Studies](http://www.journalof911studies.com/articles.html)  

[Some Physical Chemistry Aspects of Thermite, Thermate, Iron-
Aluminum-Rich Microspheres, the Eutectic, and the Iron-Sulfur
System as Applied to the Demise of Three World Trade Center

&gt;*The higher the maximum temperature reached by the molten mix, the longer it will remain molten as it flows away from the cut. But we pay a price to increase that maximum temperature. Addition of sulfur decreases the temperature at which the molten mix solidifies and increases the time available for the molten mix to flow away from the cut. Adding sulfur would decrease the required maximum temperature, and thus, decrease the amount of thermite needed to do a particular job. Only experimentation can determine what the optimum proportion of sulfur would be to minimize the amount of thermite needed to accomplish the desired cut.*

&gt;or is it possible that the collapse could've caused these intense temperatures? Perhaps the intense heat is caused by a combination of the combustion of jet fuel and thermite?   

Jet fuel burned up pretty quick. Unless you ask this [FDNY first responder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vczx8ETKg-g).

If they followed the rules/laws one would guess that to be the case.  What rules do you know of?  


&gt;Which GMO are we talking about?  

First ones consumed by an unwitting public.  

&gt;What reason do we have to treat them differently than any other new food?  

It's the FDA that appears to have failed us/we.  
 
&gt;The Food Additive Amendment of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act institutes
a precautionary approach and requires that new additives to food must be
demonstrated safe before they are marketed. (21 U.S.C. Sec. 321)  

&gt;An official Senate report described the intent of the amendment as follows:
“While Congress did not want to unnecessarily stifle technological advances, it
nevertheless intended that additives created through new technologies be proven
safe before they go to market. (S. Rep. 2422, 1958 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5301- 2
(emphasis added)) 

Wasn't it GMO soybeans and tomatoes? Where should we go to see the list of dependent and independent peer reviewed papers that garnered overwhelming consensus for said GMO products?  

Nope. FDA bowed to corporate pressure.  

&gt;Although the FDA admits that the various genetic materials implanted in bioengineered organisms are within the amendment’s purview, it claims they are
exempt from testing because they are generally recognized as safe (GRAS).  

&gt;However, the FDA’s regulations state that substances added to food that were
not in use prior to 1958 cannot qualify as GRAS unless they meet two
requirements. Not only must they be acknowledged as safe by an overwhelming
consensus of experts, but this consensus must be based on “scientific
procedures” – which ordinarily entails studies published in peer-reviewed
journals. (21 CFR Sec. 170.30 (a-b) )  

&gt;FDA regulations further stipulate that these scientific procedures must
provide a demonstration of safety and that GRAS substances “…require the same
quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of
the substance as a food additive.” (21 CFR Sec. 170.30(b)) Thus, it’s clear that
the GRAS exemption is not supposed to reduce the degree of testing but rather to
relieve a producer from performing new tests for substances already known to be
safe on the basis of previous ones.  

Slow death (labels, banning) is the sentence for the backdoor dealings by the GMO and FDA that took the public for granted. Good riddance.

&gt;The very first line of the ordinance to ban GMOs in Josephine County states its purpose:

&gt;“[to] maintain and protect seed sovereignty and local control, free from outside corporate interests and unnecessary and overreaching preemption by the state and federal governments, of this County’s agriculture, environment, public health, economy and private property rights as they pertain to genetic contamination from genetically engineered plants;”

""Just in the last week the fires have actually been put out,""   
Gov. George Pataki  Dec 19 2001  




Nafeez Ahmed sums it up pretty well.  


&gt;A commentator has attempted to ""debunk"" the findings of molten steel at Ground Zero, which I mention in my article below, [""Interrogating 9/11""](http://nafeez.blogspot.com/2006/09/interrogating-911.html). There are a number of problems with this approach, first and foremost which is the overriding ideological predisposition to ""prove"" that no molten steel was found. This is a disingenious position, as looking at the data itself, the sheer volume of people who witnessed the molten metal demonstrates that the phenomenon did exist. The vast majority of observers insisted that this was actually molten steel, not any other kind of metal, which was often seen to be dripping either directly off steel beams, or from the cores where the beams were originally erected. Now looking at the data in its totality, the insistence that it was not molten steel in the face of this credible testimony is simply bizarre. The insistence is not founded in fact, but merely in the assumption that all the observers at Ground Zero were wrong. My position is simply this:  


&gt;1. the data largely speaks for itself, and in the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary, should be taken at face value.  

&gt;2. whereas a final conclusion may not be deductible on this basis, preliminary probable inferences are justifiable on the basis of the available data.

&gt;3. such inferences based on reasonable grounds indicate an unresolved anomaly in the official narrative.

&gt;The anomaly could be consistent with a variety of interpretations. What I don't understand is the desire of some, such as the commentator, to completely deny that any such anomaly exists. This is, indeed, exactly what the official NIST investigation did, pretend that there was never any molten metal. I can accept that the findings of molten steel have not been forensically confirmed, but this is precisely because, as Thompson also documents, the Bush administration deliberately ensured that the materials were collected and scrapped before any such investigation was possible. We are, therefore, forced to work solely with the data that we do have, which is overwhelming and credible enough to justify the conclusion that an anomaly relating to the WTC collapse persists, and that independent investigation is necessary.

&gt;It is such independent investigation that the 9/11 families continue to call for, not to support some preconceived lunatic fringe theories, but to get to the unsullied truth -- not simply for the sake of their own ""closure"", but because the phenomenon of terrorism since 9/11 continues to play an integral role in the international system, and continues to kill and maim innocent civilians around the world.

So you're not aware of NIST denying molten material?  After truthers asked questions  eureka NIST had a new answer! How do you like those apples?  
 

Let me get this straight. So after answering a question no one asked ""An unfortunately common misconception is that 'jet fuel can't melt steel beams'..."", saying the WTC towers were a ""accidental smelting oven"" while providing no sources, and after repeated editing of your posts you're not going to attempt answering the question you clicked on?

&gt;Canadian Human Rights Act.

&gt;The purpose of Canadian human rights legislation is to protect against discrimination and to guarantee rights and freedoms. With respect to employment, its more specific objectiveis to eliminate exclusion that is arbitrary and based on preconceived ideas concerning personal characteristics which may not affect a person’s ability to do a job. When investigating complaints of discrimination in employment based on disability, the focus ison the effects of the distinction, exclusion or preference by an employer  


&gt;The Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability and perceived disability 4. Disability includes a previous or existing dependence on alcoholor a drug 5. Further, the Act also prohibits discrimination based on the actual or perceived possibility that an individual may develop a drug or alcohol dependency in the future.

&gt;4. What caused the fires in WTC 7?  

&gt;Debris from the collapse of WTC 1, which was 370 feet to the south, ignited fires on at least 10 floors in the building at its south and west faces. However, only the fires on some of the lower floors—7 through 9 and 11 through 13—burned out of control. These lower-floor fires—which spread and grew because the water supply to the automatic sprinkler system for these floors had failed—were similar to building fires experienced in other tall buildings. The primary and backup water supply to the sprinkler systems for the lower floors relied on the city's water supply, whose lines were damaged by the collapse of WTC 1 and WTC 2. These uncontrolled lower-floor fires eventually spread to the northeast part of WTC 7, where the building's collapse began.

Who knows maybe if NIST got the 40 million originally requested we wouldn't have needed invasion? World class experts were at the ready after 9/11. We could have rebuilt the buildings because the beams were tagged.  Anyhoo give what you can.

[This is why 9/11 matters!](http://aldeilis.net/english/this-is-why-911-matters/)  


Debatably not.  

there would be no ""war on terror"".

Without 9/11 there would be no ""clash of civilizations""

Without 9/11 there would be no war in Afghanistan.

Without 9/11 there would be no war in Iraq.

Without 9/11 there would be no war in… (insert any country classified as part of the ""axis of evil"" or defined as being 'with the terrorists')

Without 9/11 thousands of U.S. troops would not have been sent to their deaths.

Without 9/11 hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan would not have been sentenced to their deaths.

Without 9/11 there would be no inaction on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Without 9/11 there would be no civilian contractors in Iraq and the scandal that has followed them would have been averted.

Without 9/11 there would be no false military reporting (Pat Tillman, Jessica Lynch), and no crack down on the freedom of the press (banning photographing the returning coffins).

Without 9/11 there would be no Patriot Act.

Without 9/11 there would be no NSA warrantless wiretapping program.

Without 9/11 there would be no Camp Delta and no Camp X-ray at Guantanamo Bay.

Without 9/11 there would be no Military Commissions Act and no coordinated program of extraordinary rendition, indefinite detention and torture of those defined as “enemy combatants”.

Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in secrecy and complete militarization of intelligence under the newly created office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Without 9/11 there would not be thousands of dead and dying emergency workers who are suffering crippling and fatal respiratory illnesses.

Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in military and security spending that goes arm in arm with huge cutbacks in other key social programs (such as levees in New Orleans).

Without 9/11 there would have been no total abandonment of fiscal restraint, which has contributed to plunging the nation into an abyss of debt and looks likely to tip the world into a deep recession if not a complete depression.

And on and on and on.

Perhaps most importantly, without 9/11 there would be no ""post 9/11 society/mentality"".  

At the end of the day 9/11 Truth is the peace movement.

Why exactly? 

&gt;And people would have heard the windows blow out eventually. 

Is this more than speculation?

&gt;It was either this or nothing. 

Why? Let's talk.  

&gt;Do you honestly believe the world's largest sky scrapers wouldn't make any noises before they go down?  

What type of noises would we expect or is it possibly too confusing to get to the bottom of it all?  


&gt;Even if it was tnt, why haven't we heard anything about other people seeing others go about the building they haven't seen before? 

I'm going to disagree because I know that's not true.  




&gt;Why isn't there a shockwave visible?   

Are they all visible? Didn't people in the basement get hit by something that blew doors, skin and them around?  

&gt;Do you know how the structural integrity of a building works?   

Not exactly. What about it?   

&gt;And what about the noise of the windows blowing out, 

You mentioned that before. What did the eyewitness say about windows being blown out? Where did you look?  

&gt;and the inside structure fatally collapsing? Do you believe that happens silently?  

You mentioned that before.  No. What sounds should we expect?  

&gt;Also, saying that my opinion is denial just because it's different from your own is a good way to make people think you're fucking crazy.

&gt;*Thus, it’s clear that the GRAS exemption is not supposed to reduce the degree of testing but rather to relieve a producer from performing new tests for substances already known to be safe on the basis of previous ones.* [Source](http://3dd.816.myftpupload.com/article-on-illegality-of-fda/)

&gt;As I previously mentioned, the truther movement is an unsuccessful group effort to discredit the event in an attempt to portray it as a conspiracy  

By all means. you are entitled to your opinion.  


&gt;If someone in the truther community comes forward with dramatic new evidence, or a properly substantiated theory, then yes that would be fantastic, but they haven't. Not in 14 years.  

That's unrealistic and a bar set by imagination. Much like the 9/11 commission imagined they had an investigation.  



&gt;They just solely exist to discredit the event, and haven't made any headway, quite the reverse and have only entrenched their position further  

Your opinion and some more imagination.

Yes and neither political body did that.

Which the reports from the political body and the politically hostage NIST don't.

Not plausible and sweeping generalizations are ever so easy. Sorta like hand waving things away.

As stated, that's a complex process best left to an actual criminal investigation not an unorganized, unfunded body of people looking for the truth. Exposing the complex nature of intelligence agencies operations through the use of the public record isn't a realistic expectation in the least. 
 

I believe the ultimate purpose of the truth movement is to create the environment for 9/11 truth to exist. In such an environment an investigation worthy of the horrific event itself can contain world class experts.

At the bottom of the ""dump"" you'll find that your position is incorrect.  


NIST’s [tracking sheet tracks all 30 recommendations](http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/upload/WTCRecommendationsStatusTable.pdf) (PDF) from the NIST WTC investigation and the code “outcomes” from each.  As of August 2011, the most recent update, not one NIST recommendation related to progressive global collapse, “widely dislodged” fireproofing, or linear thermal expansion has been adopted.    



&gt;Does that sound plausible to you?

Mindscapes aren't all that useful for finding the truth. Going to the NIST website to see the recommendations are not support by the building industry that's useful because it proves NIST'S theories incorrect and mostly useless to the people who build building. The Insurance industry, on close inspection, reveals the same.  Your supporting ""investigation"" is proving not plausible.

Right. Like I said before an actual investigation is required.  We're talking about the dark space between the 9/11 Commission and NIST. Forensics for explosives, investigation of alternative scenarios... Everything typical of an actual detailed (think Challenger) investigation. It's important especially now that fire induced collapses and NIST'S findings have been disregarded by the building and insurance industries and debunked long ago by the 911 truth movement. It would be worth it to others if you'd tear the official story a new one with your debunking skills. Maybe write it up and use it to convince people you've made the effort to apply the same scrutiny the other direction. Just an observation like your attempts at conflation.

&gt;The current (2008) NYC code includes changes that were said to be modeled after the ICC’s changes, which were said to be a result of the NIST WTC investigation.  However, the actual changes made were not related to NIST’s three root causes of the WTC destruction.  Instead, they focused on “widened stairwells in high-rise buildings, expanded sprinkler systems, and enhanced emergency voice communication systems.”[14]

&gt;The NYC building code includes a requirement for SFRM bond strength that clearly does not take the WTC investigation into account.  The requirement is that the bond strength “shall not be less than 150 pounds per square foot (psf).“[15]  The problem is that the bond strength of the fireproofing in the WTC was known to be much higher than this and yet we’re told it was still widely dislodged.

&gt;...The tubular systems are fundamental to tall building design. Most buildings over 40 - storeys constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan’s structural engineering principles, examples including the construction of the World Trade Center, Aon Centre, Petronas Towers, Jin Mao Building, and most other supertall sky scrapers since the 1960s . The strong influence of tube structure design is also evident in the construction of the current tallest sky scraper , the Burj Khalifa.  


&gt;Fazlur Rahman Khan, the father of tubular design, is the most influential structural engineer of the 20th century. He has been called the ""Einstein of Structural Engineering"" for his revolutionary work which remain fundamental to modern sky scraper construction.[7] His breakthroughs in structural engineering for tall and long-span buildings exerted an unprecedented and lasting influence on the profession, both nationally and internationally. With a career marked by a legacy of innovations that is unpeered, Khan has become an icon in both architecture and structural engineering.[51]  

&gt;Changes of structure with height. The tubular systems by F.R Khan are fundamental for super tall buildings. Khan's central innovation in sky scraper design and construction was the idea of the ""tube"" structural system for tall buildings, including the ""framed tube"", ""trussed tube"" and ""bundled tube"" variations. His ""tube concept,"" using ""all the exterior wall perimeter structure of a building to simulate a thin - walled tube, revolutionized tall building design "" . The constructions of most super tall sky scrapers since the 1960s, including the construction of the World Trade Center, Petronas Towers and Jin Mao Building, employ a tube structural system.

Don’t take our word on that: the engineers and the architects have studied this thing in extraordinary detail, and they can tell you precisely what caused the collapse of those buildings.

6770,"&gt;PS, literally nobody but conspiracy theorists claim that the beams themselves melted.  


Come again?  

&gt;As the **construction manager for the World Trade Center**, University of Colorado civil engineering professor **Hyman Brown** gets a call every three weeks or so from someone who has a new theory about 9/11. Some of these theories are hard for Brown to dispute, he says, but debunking the central World Trade Center theories embraced by 9/11 Truth Movement is easy.  

&gt;""It is correct that the towers did not collapse because of the airliners hitting it. But we do know how it collapsed and it has nothing to do with conspiracy,"" says Brown. ""What caused the building to collapse is the airplane fuel and the fire-suppression system that we now have, which basically blocks off five-floor blocks, so the fire can’t go up and the fire can’t go down. You now have a fire confined to a five-floor area, burning at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. **The steel in that five-floor area melts.** All the tonnage above the five-floor area comes straight down **when the steel melts.** That broke all the connections, and that caused the building to collapse.""  

&gt;Just-released preliminary findings from a National Institute of Standards and Technology study of the World Trade Center collapse support Brown’s theory. 

&gt;Boulder Weekly, see also Sunday Times and BBC  
&gt;Intense heat **melted steel supports** in Trade Center

&gt;Although the impact of the jetliners was strong, it was the heat from the explosion that most likely caused the buildings to collapse, experts say.
**Richard Ebeltoft, a structural engineer** and University of Arizona architecture lecturer, speculated that flames fueled by thousands of gallons of aviation **fuel melted the buildings steel supports.**  

&gt;**Arizona Daily Wildcat** 
&gt;Don’t take our word on that: the engineers and the architects have studied this thing in extraordinary detail, and they can tell you precisely what caused the collapse of those buildings. What caused the collapse of the buildings, to summarize it, was that the super-heated jet fuel **melted the steel super-structure** of these buildings and caused their collapse. There’s a powerful lot of evidence to sustain that point of view, including the pictures of the airplanes flying into the building.  

 

**Lee Hamilton**, 9/11 Commission co-chair, on CBC, 2006  
&gt;Eventually raging fires **melted the supporting steel struts**  
  


**New Scientist**, September 12th, 2001  

&gt;""It was the fire that killed the buildings. There's nothing on earth that could survive those temperatures with that amount of fuel burning."" said **structural engineer Chris Wise**. **""The columns would have melted, the floors would have melted** and eventually they would have collapsed one on top of each other.""  

**BBC**    


&gt;""The buildings survived the impact and the explosion but not the fire, and that is the problem. The 35 tonnes of **aviation fuel will have melted the steel...""**

That's not how GMOs are tested.  

Genetically modified organism product advocates claim GMO safety has been proven by the fact an (unwitting) public has (been tested) consumed them. The safety claim is untrue as much as the claim is unethical and shameful. That the claim is repeated to the point of nausea demonstrates a lack of critical thinking. 

You learned a week ago the FDA rules clearly state for a new product to be Generally Recognized As 
Safe it requires ""OVERWHELMING consensus"" among the scientific community in the form of peer reviewed papers. You know Roundup Ready Soybeans didn't have this consensus when released in 94 and it doesn't have it now. The best it'll ever garner is broad consensus which doesn't foot the bill. Considering independent study of RRSoybean and other GMO products came with a contract it's certain ""overwhelming consensus"" is forever out of reach for GMO products.   

It's good to know 16 bills across the USA are calling for labels and it's also good to know the GMO DARK act only has a 30% chance of passing the Senate. 

Feel free to fill in the blanks with 90 day Monsanto studies or the [republished Searalini research](http://www.monsanto.no/index.php/en/environment/gmo/gmo-news/237-the-seralini-study-an-attack-on-independent-research) controversy also being an attack on the only independent research that was ""the most detailed and thorough study ever done on a GMO food and its associated pesticide.""

6834,"&gt;It turns out that the **World Trade Centre's rapid collapse was a result of its design**, which used ultra-stiff, long steel beams to hold up each floor. These beams stretched from the lift core at the centre of the building to its perimeter, with no internal columns in between, to avoid wasting floor space.     


Poor research and dumbed down narration would lead one to believe the WTC towers were a one off type of design. 


&gt;Since 1963, a new structural system of framed tubes appeared. Fazlur Khan and J. Rankine defined the framed tube structure as ""a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube - like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation "". Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Horizontal loads (primarily wind) are supported by the structure as a whole. About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity. Tube structures cut down costs, at the same time allow buildings to reach greater heights. Tube-frame construction was first used in the DeWitt - Chestnut Apartment Building , designed by Khan and completed in Chicago in 1963 . It was used soon after for the John Hancock Center and in the construction of the World Trade Center.  


&gt;A variation on the tube frame is the bundled tube, which uses several interconnected tube frames. The Willis Tower in Chicago used this design, employing nine tubes of varying height to achieve its distinct appearance. The bundle tube design was not only highly efficient in economic terms, but it was also ""innovative in its potential for versatile formulation of architectural space. Efficient towers no longer had to be box-like; the tube-units could take on various shapes and could be bundled together in different sorts of groupings "" . The bundled tube structure meant that ""buildings no longer need be boxlike in appearance: they could become sculpture "".  


&gt;**The tubular systems are fundamental to tall building design. Most buildings over 40 - storeys constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan’s structural engineering principles, examples including the construction of the World Trade Center, Aon Centre, Petronas Towers, Jin Mao Building, and most other supertall sky scrapers since the 1960s .

&gt;Private Banks (Quotation)
Quotation: ""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.""

Variations:

""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.""
Sources consulted: Searching on the phrase ""private banks""

Papers of Thomas Jefferson Digital Edition
Thomas Jefferson Retirement Papers
Quotable Jefferson (searching in the index under ""banks"")
Thomas Jefferson Papers collection in Hathi Trust Digital Library
Earliest known appearance in print: 19331

Other attributions: None known.

Status: This quotation is at least partly spurious; see comments below.

Comments: This quotation is often cited as being in an 1802 letter to Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, and/or ""later published in The Debate Over the Recharter of the Bank Bill (1809).""

The first part of the quotation (""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered"") has not been found anywhere in Thomas Jefferson's writings, to Albert Gallatin or otherwise. It is identified in Respectfully Quoted as spurious, and the editor further points out that the words ""inflation"" and ""deflation"" are not documented until after Jefferson's lifetime.2

The second part of the quotation (""I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies..."") may well be a paraphrase of a statement Jefferson made in a letter to John Taylor in 1816. He wrote, ""And I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.""3

The third part of this quotation (""The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs"") may be a misquotation of Jefferson's comment to John Wayles Eppes, ""Bank-paper must be suppressed, and the circulating medium must be restored to the nation to whom it belongs.""4

This first known occurence in print of the spurious first part with the two other quotations is in 1948, although the spurious portion actually appears after the two other quotations.5

Lastly, we have not found a record of any publication called The Debate Over the Recharter of the Bank Bill. There was certainly debate over the recharter of the National Bank leading up to its expiration in 1811, but a search of Congressional documents of that period yields none of the verbiage discussed above.

*Abstract*  

&gt;Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup®, is the most popular herbicide used worldwide. The industry asserts it is minimally toxic to humans, but here we argue otherwise. Residues are found in the main foods of the Western diet, comprised primarily of sugar, corn, soy and wheat. Glyphosate's inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is an overlooked component of its toxicity to mammals. CYP enzymes play crucial roles in biology, one of which is to detoxify xenobiotics. Thus, glyphosate enhances the damaging effects of other food borne chemical residues and environmental toxins.   

&gt;Negative impact on the body is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body. Here, we show how interference with CYP enzymes acts synergistically with disruption of the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids by gut bacteria, as well as impairment in serum sulfate transport. Consequences are most of the diseases and conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.  

&gt;We explain the documented effects of glyphosate and its ability to induce disease, and we show that glyphosate is the “textbook example” of exogenous semiotic entropy: the disruption of homeostasis by environmental toxins.

It looks like you didn't start your GMO education by finding out if it actually should have been released by the FDA to begin with?  
  

Nice research but if you go deeper you'll find disturbing patterns of a compromised regulatory agency.  

&gt;As the FDA was developing its policy on GE foods during 1991- 92, there was not even consensus of safety among its own experts. The predominant opinion was   

(a) that these new foods entail unique risks, especially the potential for
unintended harmful side effects that are difficult to detect and   

(b) that none
can be considered safe unless it has passed rigorous tests capable of screening for such effects.   

These scientists expressed their concerns in numerous memos to superiors – memos that only came to light in 1998 when the Alliance for
Bio-Integrity initiated a lawsuit that forced the FDA to divulge its files.  


For example, microbiologist Dr. Louis Pribyl stated: “There is a profound difference between the types of unexpected effects from traditional breeding and
genetic engineering ….” He added that several aspects of gene- splicing “. . .
may be more hazardous . . .” (#4 in the set of photocopies of FDA memos at
www.biointegrity.org/list.html Numbers after subsequent quotes from FDA
scientists refer to the number in this set.) Similarly, Dr. E.J. Matthews of the
FDA’s Toxicology Group warned that “. . . genetically modified plants could …
contain unexpected high concentrations of plant toxicants…,” and he cautioned
that some of these toxicants could be unexpected and could “…be uniquely
different chemicals that are usually expressed in unrelated plants.” (2) Citing
the potential for such unintended dangers, the Director of FDA’s Center for
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) called for bioengineered products to be demonstrated
safe prior to marketing. He stated: “… CVM believes that animal feeds derived
from genetically modified plants present unique animal and food safety
concerns.” (10) (emphasis added) He explained that residues of unexpected
substances could make meat and milk products harmful to humans.
In light of these unique risks, agency scientists advised that GE foods should
undergo special testing, including toxicological tests. (e.g. 6, 10)
The pervasiveness of the concerns within the scientific staff is attested by
a memo from an FDA official who protested the agency was “… trying to fit a
square peg into a round hole . . . [by] trying to force an ultimate conclusion
that there is no difference between foods modified by genetic engineering and
foods modified by traditional breeding practices.” She declared: “The processes
of genetic engineering and traditional breeding are different, and according to
the technical experts in the agency, they lead to different risks.” (1)
Moreover, FDA officials knew there was not a consensus about the safety of GE
foods among scientists outside the agency either. For instance, FDA’s
Biotechnology Coordinator acknowledged in a letter to a Canadian health official
that there was no such consensus in the scientific community at large. He also
admitted, “I think the question of the potential for some substances to cause
allergenic reactions is particularly difficult to predict.”

Death is death.  


&gt;Showa Denko 


&gt;There are numerous ways in which genetically engineered bacteria might lead to unpredicted contaminants. For example:

&gt;The process of inserting genes can create significant changes in the expression of natural genes throughout the DNA, causing changes in proteins (including enzymes) and their interactions.
Genetic engineering can cause mutations and deletions in the DNA, altering its natural functioning and changing what is produced.  

&gt;As he looked at the memo, Crist wondered why the FDA didn't know about the earlier GM strains. They had access to a lot more information he did. Then his eyes rose to the top of the document to see a fax imprint: ""FDA September 17, 1990."" It had been faxed by the FDA! They knew back in 1990 that the earlier strains were modified, but in 1996, the FDA's biotech coordinator James Maryanski was still claiming ignorance.

&gt;An even greater omission occurred when Douglas Archer, deputy director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, testified before Congress in July 1991 about the epidemic. Not only did he not discuss the earlier bacterial strains, he never even mentioned genetic engineering. Instead, he blamed the disease on ""the dangers inherent in the various health fraud schemes that are being perpetrated upon segments of the American public."" The FDA used this logic to take all L-tryptophan, GM or not, off the market.


&gt;Many studies have verified that the process of genetic engineering can produce unpredicted toxins or allergens. Nevertheless, the FDA does not require any additional safety testing for GM products, whether they are food crops or supplements. Thus, if that same deadly L-tryptophan were first introduced today, it would get on the market.

&gt;**The EMS epidemic took years to identify and was almost missed. The only reason it was discovered was because the disease had three concurrent characteristics: it was rare, acute, and came on quickly. What would happen if all three characteristics had not been in place? What if it took 20 years for onset or only impacted the next generation? What if it produced only mild symptoms like frequent colds? What if it created serious diseases that were common, like cancer, heart-disease, obesity or diabetes? The epidemic might remain undiscovered for decades.**  


What then of the thousands of products currently being fed to US citizens that contain ingredients from genetic modification? Might they be creating problems that don't have all three characteristics? Are they contributing to the doubling of food-related illnesses in the United States between 1994 and 2001, corresponding to the time when many of these products were introduced? We don't know, because no one is looking. And even if we were, derivatives from the four major GM crops, soy, corn, cottonseed, and canola, are found in the majority of processed foods. Unlike L-tryptophan, if common food ingredients were creating health problems, identifying the source might be impossible.

Such corridors can be navigated entirely by autopilot and flight management systems scheduled in 1996 and 1998 to be contained by United and American airlines Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft like those used during the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

Exactly.  




&gt;**Although most Americans (including those who serve in government) are unaware
of it, genetically engineered foods are on the market only because the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) has covered up the warnings of its own scientists,
misrepresented the facts, and violated explicit mandates of U.S. law. The
following points provide the details and describe the solution.**  
  
&gt;The Food Additive Amendment of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act institutes
a precautionary approach and requires that new additives to food must be
demonstrated safe before they are marketed. (21 U.S.C. Sec. 321)
An official Senate report described the intent of the amendment as follows:
“While Congress did not want to unnecessarily stifle technological advances, it
nevertheless intended that additives created through new technologies be proven
safe before they go to market. (S. Rep. 2422, 1958 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5301- 2
(emphasis added))  


&gt;Although the FDA admits that the various genetic materials implanted in bioengineered organisms are within the amendment’s purview, it claims they are
exempt from testing because they are generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
**However, the FDA’s regulations state that substances added to food that were
not in use prior to 1958 cannot qualify as GRAS unless they meet two
requirements. Not only must they be acknowledged as safe by an overwhelming
consensus of experts, but this consensus must be based on “scientific
procedures” – which ordinarily entails studies published in peer-reviewed
journals.** (21 CFR Sec. 170.30 (a-b) )  


&gt;**FDA regulations further stipulate that these scientific procedures must
provide a demonstration of safety and that GRAS substances “…require the same
quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of
the substance as a food additive.” (21 CFR Sec. 170.30(b)) Thus, it’s clear that
the GRAS exemption is not supposed to reduce the degree of testing but rather to
relieve a producer from performing new tests for substances already known to be
safe on the basis of previous ones.  


&gt;Genetically engineered (GE) foods fail both requirements. There is substantial
dispute among experts about their safety; and none has been confirmed safe
through adequate testing.  

&gt;As the FDA was developing its policy on GE foods during 1991- 92, there was
not even consensus of safety among its own experts. The predominant opinion was  
(a) that these new foods entail unique risks, especially the potential for
unintended harmful side effects that are difficult to detect and (b) that none
can be considered safe unless it has passed rigorous tests capable of screening
for such effects. These scientists expressed their concerns in numerous memos to
superiors – memos that only came to light in 1998 when the Alliance for
Bio-Integrity initiated a lawsuit that forced the FDA to divulge its files.
For example, microbiologist Dr. Louis Pribyl stated: “There is a profound
difference between the types of unexpected effects from traditional breeding and
genetic engineering ….” He added that several aspects of gene- splicing “. . .
may be more hazardous . . .” (#4 in the set of photocopies of FDA memos at
www.biointegrity.org/list.html Numbers after subsequent quotes from FDA
scientists refer to the number in this set.) Similarly, Dr. E.J. Matthews of the
FDA’s Toxicology Group warned that “. . . genetically modified plants could …
contain unexpected high concentrations of plant toxicants…,” and he cautioned
that some of these toxicants could be unexpected and could “…be uniquely
different chemicals that are usually expressed in unrelated plants.” (2) Citing
the potential for such unintended dangers, the Director of FDA’s Center for
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) called for bioengineered products to be demonstrated
safe prior to marketing. He stated: “… CVM believes that animal feeds derived
from genetically modified plants present unique animal and food safety
concerns.” (10) (emphasis added) He explained that residues of unexpected
substances could make meat and milk products harmful to humans.
In light of these unique risks, agency scientists advised that GE foods should
undergo special testing, including toxicological tests. (e.g. 6, 10)  


&gt;The pervasiveness of the **concerns within the scientific staff is attested by
a memo from an FDA official who protested the agency was “… trying to fit a
square peg into a round hole . . . [by] trying to force an ultimate conclusion
that there is no difference between foods modified by genetic engineering and
foods modified by traditional breeding practices.” She declared: “The processes
of genetic engineering and traditional breeding are different, and according to
the technical experts in the agency, they lead to different risks.”** (1)
Moreover, FDA officials knew there was not a consensus about the safety of GE
foods among scientists outside the agency either. **For instance, FDA’s
Biotechnology Coordinator acknowledged in a letter to a Canadian health official
that there was no such consensus in the scientific community at large. He also
admitted, “I think the question of the potential for some substances to cause
allergenic reactions is particularly difficult to predict.”** (8)  

&gt;**This lack of consensus in itself disqualifies GE foods from GRAS status.** But
even if consensus did exist, no GE food would qualify as GRAS because none has
satisfactorily passed the level of testing that the law requires – and that the
FDA experts stated is necessary. The agency’s files demonstrate that as of 1992,
there was virtually no evidence to support safety, with one official’s memo to
the Biotechnology Coordinator querying: ” … are we asking the scientific experts
to generate the basis for this policy statement in the absence of any data?”(1).
And the evidentiary base is still deficient because the FDA does not require any
testing; and the tests relied on by the EU, Canada, and others do not adequately
screen for the unexpected side effects about which the FDA scientists warned.
The inadequacy of current testing has been pointed out by numerous experts,
including the Royal Society of Canada and the Public Health Association of
Australia.  


&gt;Despite the ample evidence indicating a lack of consensus about safety, as
well as the lack of requisite evidence to confirm it, the FDA’s decision-makers
(who acknowledge they’ve been operating under a policy “to foster” the U.S.
biotechnology industry) declared it is legitimate to presume that all GE foods
are GRAS – and can therefore be marketed without any testing. In doing so, they
professed themselves “not aware of any information” showing that GE foods differ
from others “in any meaningful way,” despite the extensive input from their
scientists pointing out the significant differences and their serious
implications. (Statement of Policy: Foods Derived From New Plant Varieties, May
29, 1992, Federal Register vol. 57, No. 104 at 22991.)
Although many people have been led to believe that the U.S. district court in
Alliance for Bio-Integrity v. Shalala determined that GE foods are on the market
legally, its decision actually highlights the extent to which their presence is
contrary to the law.  



&gt;As for the evidence that had been within the FDA’s own files in 1992, she
ruled that the administrators were free to disregard the opinions of
subordinates when setting policy. (p.178) This conclusion seems odd, since the
written opinions of the agency’s scientists represented far more than mere
policy preferences. **They constituted solid evidence that a significant number of
experts did not recognize GE foods as safe.** Further, the judge did not mention
the fact that the FDA’s biotechnology coordinator had admitted there was not a
consensus within the scientific community, even though plaintiffs’ briefs had
repeatedly cited the relevant document.  


&gt;**Regardless of whether one agrees that FDA administrators had reasonable basis
in 1992 to presume that GE foods are GRAS, it’s obvious this presumption has
been decisively rebutted, both by the ever-growing dispute among experts and the
ongoing lack of adequate testing.**  


&gt;Consequently, the marketing of GE foods in the U.S. is illegal because none
of them is GRAS and none has undergone formal food additive approval. To rectify
this situation, the FDA needs to acknowledge the truth, admit that GE foods are
not GRAS, and remove them from market. And it must not allow any such product to be re-introduced until it has been confirmed safe through the testing required
by law. **To do so, the agency does not have to reverse any official
determinations, because it has never formally determined that any GE food is
GRAS or that any has been demonstrated safe. It merely has to acknowledge that

&gt;There are numerous ways in which genetically engineered bacteria might lead to unpredicted contaminants. For example:

&gt;The process of inserting genes can create significant changes in the expression of natural genes throughout the DNA, causing changes in proteins (including enzymes) and their interactions.
Genetic engineering can cause mutations and deletions in the DNA, altering its natural functioning and changing what is produced.  

&gt;As he looked at the memo, Crist wondered why the FDA didn't know about the earlier GM strains. They had access to a lot more information he did. Then his eyes rose to the top of the document to see a fax imprint: ""FDA September 17, 1990."" It had been faxed by the FDA! They knew back in 1990 that the earlier strains were modified, but in 1996, the FDA's biotech coordinator James Maryanski was still claiming ignorance.

&gt;An even greater omission occurred when Douglas Archer, deputy director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, testified before Congress in July 1991 about the epidemic. Not only did he not discuss the earlier bacterial strains, he never even mentioned genetic engineering. Instead, he blamed the disease on ""the dangers inherent in the various health fraud schemes that are being perpetrated upon segments of the American public."" The FDA used this logic to take all L-tryptophan, GM or not, off the market.


&gt;Many studies have verified that the process of genetic engineering can produce unpredicted toxins or allergens. Nevertheless, the FDA does not require any additional safety testing for GM products, whether they are food crops or supplements. Thus, if that same deadly L-tryptophan were first introduced today, it would get on the market.

&gt;**The EMS epidemic took years to identify and was almost missed. The only reason it was discovered was because the disease had three concurrent characteristics: it was rare, acute, and came on quickly. What would happen if all three characteristics had not been in place? What if it took 20 years for onset or only impacted the next generation? What if it produced only mild symptoms like frequent colds? What if it created serious diseases that were common, like cancer, heart-disease, obesity or diabetes? The epidemic might remain undiscovered for decades.**  


What then of the thousands of products currently being fed to US citizens that contain ingredients from genetic modification?

&gt;Reagan Gets Idea From 'Rambo' for Next Time
July 01, 1985|From a Times Staff Writer  

&gt;WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in a comment just before he addressed the nation from the Oval Office on Sunday, joked that the movie ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" gave him an idea about how to handle a hostage crisis if he is faced with another one.

&gt;""Boy, after seeing 'Rambo' last night, I know what to do the next time this happens,"" he said, in a remark picked up by microphones placed in his office for the television and radio speech but not carried in the broadcast.

&gt;In the film, a Vietnam veteran, played by actor Sylvester Stallone, launches a bloody rescue mission in Southeast Asia for U.S. servicemen missing in action from the Vietnam War. He battles cold-blooded bureaucrats at home and Communists abroad to save the GIs still being held.  

***   


**[Rambo III](http://rambo.wikia.com/wiki/Mujahideen)**  


&gt;The Mujahideen are headquartered in Peshawar, Pakistan, a city just over the Pakistani border. John Rambo goes to Mousa Ghanin,... Rambo gets the supplies, a briefcase full of C-4 plastic explosives... Rambo calls a mission with the Mujhahideen and Uri tells him the layout of the Soviet prison camp. The Mujahideen initially refuse,... At the very end of the film, the Mujahideen help Rambo in the final battle, and they win.


&gt;Before the end credits begin, a title card is briefly displayed. The original card says: **""This film is dedicated to the brave Mujahideen fighters of Afghanistan.""** However, after the September 11, 2001 attacks, public backlash ensued because some Mujhahideen groups grew to become associated with Al Qaeda during the anarchy after Soviet withdrawl. The title card was then changed to ""This film is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan.""

&gt;2.6Summary
&gt;There are two observations about the collapse of WTC1 which are difficult to harmonize in the context of the official explanation. One is the time with which the collapse took place and the other is the production of large clouds of dust which are seen forming during the entire collapse in the videos of the falling building. The majority of the paper has explored this di±culty by totally ignoring the columns and any resistance they produced. The considerations were based on the need for energy to crush the concrete and momentum conservation. However, if one ignores energy needed to crush the concrete, a reasonable estimate using resistance of the columns also produces surprisingly long times to collapse.

&gt;No-one has ever been able to discover the identity of the mysterious people who ""peer-reviewed"" the paper in question, or what their credentials might be.

You don't seem to be making an accusation? Plus why would a former editor be privy to any internal information?  

&gt;**Scholarly peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal or as a book. The peer review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief or the editorial board) deciding whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish; and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but does by no means prevent publication of all invalid research. Traditionally, peer reviewers have been anonymous, but there are currently a significant amount of open peer review, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well.** [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review)

The layers of reactive substances are separated by thin layers of a buffer material which prevents the reactions from taking place until the desired time.

This class of compositions includes materials which have not previously been capable of use as energetic materials. **The speed and products of the reactions can be varied to suit the application.**

&gt;The 23-member 9/11 Consensus Panel is building a body of evidence-based research into the events of September 11, 2001. This evidence -- derived from a standard scientific reviewing process -- is available to any investigation that may be undertaken by the public, the media, academia, or any other investigative body or institution.  


&gt;[Methodology and Results](http://www.consensus911.org/methodology/)  

 

&gt;A full account of the 9/11 Consensus statements is presented below.

&gt;A simplified Delphi method was used over a six-month period to arrive at the Panel’s Consensus Points regarding the official account of the events of September 11, 2001.

&gt;*The Delphi technique is used in medicine and other applied sciences to generate consensus statements of the best available evidence for treatment protocols, using a series of surveys in which the expert respondents are blind to one another.*

&gt;Starting with Set One in 2011, to establish the best evidence with regard to the alleged events of 9/11, a group of proposed Consensus Points (formulated by Dr. David Ray Griffin and Elizabeth Woodworth) were initially evaluated by four persons expert in 9/11 evidence – persons who remained blind to one another during the process.

&gt;Their feedback was incorporated into the Points, which were then forwarded to a further 19 people with expertise in 9/11 evidence – also blind to one another.

&gt;The larger group rankings and feedback were in turn incorporated into the formulations, and two further rounds of review were conducted, again blind, for all participants who still had reservations about any of the Points or their supporting references.

&gt;As of September 2014, the Consensus Panel has published eight sets of Consensus Points, for a total of 44 Points to date.

&gt;[Point TT-5: The Claim that the World Trade Center Dust Contained No Thermitic Materials](http://www.consensus911.org/point-tt-5/)  


&gt;**The Official Account**  

&gt;Although NIST did not perform any tests [1] to determine whether there were incendiaries (such as thermite) or explosives (such as RDX and nanothermite) in the WTC dust, it claimed [2] that such materials were not present.  

**The Best Evidence**  

Unreacted nanothermitic material, “which can be tailored [3] to behave as an incendiary (like ordinary thermite), or as an explosive,” [4] was found in four independently collected [5] samples of the WTC dust (as reported [6] in a multi-author paper in a peer-reviewed journal).

How does this fit in the mix?

&gt;A complex modulated structure of reactive elements that have the capability of considerably more heat than organic explosives while generating a working fluid or gas. The explosive and method of fabricating same involves a plurality of very thin, stacked, multilayer structures, each composed of reactive components, such as aluminum, separated from a less reactive element, such as copper oxide, by a separator material, such as carbon. The separator material not only separates the reactive materials, but it reacts therewith when detonated to generate higher temperatures. The various layers of material, thickness of 10 to 10,000 angstroms, can be deposited by magnetron sputter deposition. The explosive detonates and combusts a high velocity generating a gas, such as CO, and high temperatures.

&gt;Could the source of sulfur be as simple as -""acid rain""?

&gt;Could nearby ocean salts such a sodium sulfate play a role?

Slide 83.  
&gt;At This Time We don't Know!  
***  

At this time we do know!     

Dr. Astaneh-Asl's account places an 8 hour timeframe on the eutectic action that caused the severe steel wastage. Severe corrosion, deep mystery, [novel phenomenon](https://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html), evaporation, very unusual event, etc.  
 


&gt;One piece Dr. Astaneh-Asl saw was a charred horizontal I-beam from 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper that collapsed from fire eight hours after the attacks. The beam, so named because its cross-section looks like a capital I, had clearly endured searing temperatures. Parts of the flat top of the I, once five-eighths of an inch thick, had vaporized.  

&gt;Less clear was whether the beam had been charred after the collapse, as it lay in the pile of burning rubble, or whether it had been engulfed in the fire that led to the building's collapse, which would provide a more telling clue.  


&gt;The answer lay in the beam's twisted shape. As weight pushed down, the center portion had buckled outward.  


&gt;''This tells me it buckled while it was attached to the column,'' not as it fell, Dr. Astaneh-Asl said, adding, ''It had burned first, then buckled.''  [Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/science/scarred-steel-holds-clues-and-remedies.html)   
***  

&gt;For example, valuable information could come from analysis of the blackened steel from the floors engulfed in flame after the airplane collisions. Steel flanges had been reduced from an inch thick to paper thin, Astaneh said. [Source](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2001/10/03_grou.html)  
 
We need to know how the ""eutectic action"" happened that's why astaneh's timeframe is important. [Can you imagine 15.8mm of steel gone in 8](http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/vbimghost.php?do=displayimg&amp;imgid=27691) days or an inch of steel turning to a ""[razor sharpness](https://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)"" in just 2 weeks?   


[Dr. Astaneh-Asl findings are similar to FEMA's](http://imgur.com/ijKf1J6) ""It is also possible that the phenomenon started prior to collapse and accelerated the weakening of the steel structure. A detailed study into the mechanisms of this phenomenon is needed to determine what risk, if any, is presented to existing steel structures exposed to severe and long-burning fires. 

Now we can see why after NIST said it would address ""all major recommendations in the (FEMA) report"" they couldn't dare mention the swiss cheese steel!  If a spontaneously created mixture  in the WTC office fires involving drywall releasing sulfur gas can melt steel in 8 hours we need to find out specifically how this happened.

&gt;1. Doesn't matter if NIST released the model info or not.   

Sure it does.  

&gt;The information is public; build your own, as many journals have done for themselves.   

Sources?  Everyone would be most interested if 2.25 sec of free fall was recorded in any of these journals as well as an explanation for said free fall. 

&gt;It wasn't the job of the report to mention WTC7, so why would it?   


Sure it was. Leaving out B7 was not providing a complete account of the terrorist events of 9/11.   

&gt;So what? News agencies get incorrect reports during live events all the time. BBC also found the footage; it was simply under the previous year.  

If this happens ""all the time"" it should be easy to find a comparable ""incorrect report"".  


&gt;A&amp;E911 is a joke of an organization,  

That supports a new investigation. How does offering your opinion in broad brush debunk the organization? Wouldn't you need some kind of proof for others to believe your claim?   


 
&gt;As far as I know, there is virtually no evidence for molten steel,   

Does this mean it didn't happen?  
 

&gt;and the sources for it are dubious at best, 

Dubious sources? Can we take a look at some?  

&gt;and usually second hand.  

Again some links would help build your case.  



&gt;Nano thermite was not found,    

Did you find this in a journal or something. I'm very interested in your source!!  

&gt;reactive chips were that resemble many other things. 

What's the consensus for what these nano engineered red gray chips resemble or actually were? After all these years maybe something has been identified?  

 


&gt;The paper was published in a bunk journal with a reputation for lying, 

Source proof?  

&gt;and the samples were never allowed to be examined by anyone else.  

Dust at GZ was collected by many.  What's the problem?    

  


&gt;No, just loud booms, described as explosions, which is extremely common and expected in such a large event.   

What do you figure was booming?  

&gt;There were no squibs down the side of the towers; that's simple rubbish.  

What video shows no squibs?   

 

&gt;...Intercept times are nowhere near as fast as people like to claim.  

Source?   

&gt;It hardly matters when multiple recognizable pieces of debris from a 757 were located, along with a huge number of eyewitnesses.
  
Was that evidence entered into some kind of report you have access to? Seems they ""cleaned"" the ""crime scene"" the same day of the attack. Considering we cannot ascertain what plane hit the Pentagon it certainly does matter a great deal.  

  

&gt;No evidence that the Israelis had foreknowledge. The rest is, therefore, entirely irrelevant.

&gt;*The authors also obtained and examined additional samples of WTC dust which had been collected by independent observers on, or very soon after, 9/11. All of the samples examined contained these very small, peculiar red/gray chips. Previous studies discussing observations of the WTC dust include reports by the RJ Lee Company [14], the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) [15], McGee et al. [13] and Lioy et al. [16] Some of these studies confirmed the finding of iron-rich microspheres, which are also peculiar [5, 8, 11, 13-15] but the red/gray chips analyzed in this study have apparently not been discussed in previously published reports.*    [Source](http://web.archive.org/web/20150704190922/http://www.htmlpublish.com/newTestDocStorage/DocStorage/85809877687148c69d851ddc02499669/Pages%20from%20TOCPJ-2-7-1.htm)

&gt;Abstract  


&gt;A complex modulated structure of reactive elements that have the capability of considerably more heat than organic explosives while generating a working fluid or gas. The explosive and method of fabricating same involves a plurality of very thin, stacked, multilayer structures, each composed of reactive components, such as aluminum, separated from a less reactive element, such as copper oxide, by a separator material, such as carbon. The separator material not only separates the reactive materials, but it reacts therewith when detonated to generate higher temperatures. The various layers of material, thickness of 10 to 10,000 angstroms, can be deposited by magnetron sputter deposition. The explosive detonates and combusts a high velocity generating a gas, such as CO, and high temperatures.

It's available.  



&gt;Since 1963, a new structural system of framed tubes appeared. Fazlur Khan and J. Rankine defined the framed tube structure as ""a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube - like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation "". Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Horizontal loads (primarily wind) are supported by the structure as a whole. About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity. Tube structures cut down costs, at the same time allow buildings to reach greater heights. Tube-frame construction was first used in the DeWitt - Chestnut Apartment Building , designed by Khan and completed in Chicago in 1963 . It was used soon after for the John Hancock Center and in the construction of the World Trade Center.  

&gt;A variation on the tube frame is the bundled tube, which uses several interconnected tube frames. The Willis Tower in Chicago used this design, employing nine tubes of varying height to achieve its distinct appearance. The bundle tube design was not only highly efficient in economic terms, but it was also ""innovative in its potential for versatile formulation of architectural space. Efficient towers no longer had to be box-like; the tube-units could take on various shapes and could be bundled together in different sorts of groupings "" . The bundled tube structure meant that ""buildings no longer need be boxlike in appearance: they could become sculpture "".  

&gt;The tubular systems are fundamental to tall building design. Most buildings over 40 - storeys constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan’s structural engineering principles, examples including the construction of the World Trade Center, Aon Centre, Petronas Towers, Jin Mao Building, and most other supertall sky scrapers since the 1960s . The strong influence of tube structure design is also evident in the construction of the current tallest sky scraper , the Burj Khalifa.  



&gt;Fazlur Rahman Khan, the father of tubular design, is the most influential structural engineer of the 20th century. He has been called the ""Einstein of Structural Engineering"" for his revolutionary work which remain fundamental to modern sky scraper construction.[7] His breakthroughs in structural engineering for tall and long-span buildings exerted an unprecedented and lasting influence on the profession, both nationally and internationally. With a career marked by a legacy of innovations that is unpeered, Khan has become an icon in both architecture and structural engineering.[51]

&gt;*A method for providing chemical energy and energetic compositions of matter consisting of thin layers of substances which will exothermically react with one another. The layers of reactive substances are separated by thin layers of a buffer material which prevents the reactions from taking place until the desired time. The reactions are triggered by an external agent, such as mechanical stress or an electric spark. The compositions are known as metastable interstitial composites (MICs). This class of compositions includes materials which have not previously been capable of use as energetic materials. The speed and products of the reactions can be varied to suit the application.*

This is the latest read on the subject. 

&gt;This would have been a military operation. All large covert military operations use the tactics of compartmentalization and need to know. Every complex operation is split up into a series of subtasks. The people performing their specific task do not necessarily know what others are doing or even what they themselves are really doing. For example, someone is tasked with spraying on nanothermite but is told it’s simply a new form of fireproofing primer paint. This person has no idea what they are actually spraying on. So for all we know only one person at the very top would have known the full plan for the tower demolitions. Anyone who claims that official 9/11 story skeptics are conspiracy theorists is therefore making a purely faith-based evidenceless claim. The believer who makes a claim has the burden of proof to support his claim not the skeptic. [Source](http://skeptopathy.com/wp/?p=334)

7111,"&gt;The hypothesis here requires it to have happened three times, with perfect precision,  


~~Hypothesis~~  Scientific Theory  

 
&gt;Many will claim that I should be calling this a hypothesis rather than a theory. However, let’s look at how others define a scientific theory. The United States National Academy of Sciences says:  


&gt;The formal scientific definition of “theory” is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)…One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.[1]  


&gt;The American Association for the Advancement of Science says:

*A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not “guesses” but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than “just a theory.” It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.*[2]  


&gt;From the first definition, the sticking point may be the “vast body of evidence”. However, the official story has 0 scientific evidence, [as we will soon see](http://skeptopathy.com/wp/?p=334), and the TCD theory has considerable evidence.  

***  
&gt;The fact is no building the height of WTC 7, or even HALF the height of WTC 1+2. has ever been brought down with explosives. The hypothesis here requires it to have happened three times, with perfect precision, in a few hours.

&gt;*A complex modulated structure of reactive elements that have the capability of considerably more heat than organic explosives while generating a working fluid or gas. The explosive and method of fabricating same involves a plurality of very thin, stacked, multilayer structures, each composed of reactive components, such as aluminum, separated from a less reactive element, such as copper oxide, by a separator material, such as carbon. The separator material not only separates the reactive materials, but it reacts therewith when detonated to generate higher temperatures. The various layers of material, thickness of 10 to 10,000 angstroms, can be deposited by magnetron sputter deposition. The explosive detonates and combusts a high velocity generating a gas, such as CO, and high temperatures.*  
  



[1993 Patent ""This invention relates to the fields of chemical reaction kinetics and energetic materials."" ...thin layers of substances, reactions: rapidly, slowly, heat but not gasses, buffer prevents the reactions from taking place, ...desired time, ...designed to suit the application](http://www.google.de/patents/US5266132)    


&gt;*A method for providing chemical energy and energetic compositions of matter consisting of thin layers of substances which will exothermically react with one another. The layers of reactive substances are separated by thin layers of a buffer material which prevents the reactions from taking place until the desired time. The reactions are triggered by an external agent, such as mechanical stress or an electric spark. The compositions are known as metastable interstitial composites (MICs). This class of compositions includes materials which have not previously been capable of use as energetic materials. The speed and products of the reactions can be varied to suit the application.*  

These look similar to what's described in the [Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe](http://benthamopen.com/ABSTRACT/TOCPJ-2-7)

The weird thing is Dr. Astaneh-Asl's account places an 8 hour timeframe on the eutectic action that caused the severe steel wastage. Severe corrosion, deep mystery, [novel phenomenon](https://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html), evaporation, very unusual event, etc.  
 


&gt;One piece Dr. Astaneh-Asl saw was a charred horizontal I-beam from 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper that collapsed from fire eight hours after the attacks. The beam, so named because its cross-section looks like a capital I, had clearly endured searing temperatures. Parts of the flat top of the I, once five-eighths of an inch thick, had vaporized.  

&gt;Less clear was whether the beam had been charred after the collapse, as it lay in the pile of burning rubble, or whether it had been engulfed in the fire that led to the building's collapse, which would provide a more telling clue.  


&gt;The answer lay in the beam's twisted shape. As weight pushed down, the center portion had buckled outward.  


&gt;''This tells me it buckled while it was attached to the column,'' not as it fell, Dr. Astaneh-Asl said, adding, ''It had burned first, then buckled.''  [Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/science/scarred-steel-holds-clues-and-remedies.html)   
***  

&gt;For example, valuable information could come from analysis of the blackened steel from the floors engulfed in flame after the airplane collisions. Steel flanges had been reduced from an inch thick to paper thin, Astaneh said. [Source](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2001/10/03_grou.html)  
 
We need to know how the ""eutectic action"" happened that's why astaneh's timeframe is important. [Can you imagine 15.8mm of steel gone in 8](http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/vbimghost.php?do=displayimg&amp;imgid=27691) days or an inch of steel turning to a ""[razor sharpness](https://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)"" in just 2 weeks?

&gt;Given the magnitude of 9/11 and all that has followed in its wake, it is not unreasonable to inquire whether we, the people of the United States of America, indeed the people of the World, are entitled to a Daubert hearing on the question of the cause(s) of the destruction of WTC 1, 2 and 7 on September 11, 2001.  
 

&gt;In this paper the reader has been provided with a reasonably sufficient introduction to the question of the cause(s) of the destruction of WTC 1, 2 and 7, as well as citations to several sources and documents addressing both sides of the debate on this subject. It is beyond the scope of this paper to go into greater detail. Indeed, it is incumbent upon the readers who are so inclined to dig deeper into the available information and conduct their own research with respect to investigating the facts, proved or alleged, and the science and technology involved in connection with the question of the cause(s) of the destruction of WTC 1, 2 and 7 on September 11, 2001. I will endeavor, however so briefly here, to apply the Daubert factors to the expert opinions on this important issue.  

  
&gt;The official theory as pronounced by NIST (and FEMA) has been scrutinized by numerous architects, engineers, physicists, demolition, and explosive experts. While some members of the scientific community have chosen to accept the official theory, there is no general acceptance of the theory in the scientific community. Indeed, the official theory has been rejected by many qualified experts who have reviewed and scrutinized the NIST reports and the data that NIST has made available.

&gt; Maybe the rumors of advanced knowledge of controlled demolition and an imminent collapse of WTC 7 among the firefighters and public was based off a firefighter seeing tell-tale signs of severe fire damage that nearly every trained firefighter knows how to point out.   

Why speculate when sources are available?   


Oral histories 
http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/met_WTC_histories_01.html  


&gt;The simple truth could be lying in a manual somewhere.  

It's lying in a newspaper.  


Dr. Astaneh-Asl's account places an 8 hour timeframe on the eutectic action that caused the severe steel wastage. Severe corrosion, deep mystery, novel phenomenon, evaporation, very unusual event, etc.  
 


&gt;One piece Dr. Astaneh-Asl saw was a charred horizontal I-beam from 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper that collapsed from fire eight hours after the attacks. The beam, so named because its cross-section looks like a capital I, had clearly endured searing temperatures. Parts of the flat top of the I, once five-eighths of an inch thick, had vaporized.  

&gt;Less clear was whether the beam had been charred after the collapse, as it lay in the pile of burning rubble, or whether it had been engulfed in the fire that led to the building's collapse, which would provide a more telling clue.  


&gt;The answer lay in the beam's twisted shape. As weight pushed down, the center portion had buckled outward.  


&gt;''This tells me it buckled while it was attached to the column,'' not as it fell, Dr. Astaneh-Asl said, adding, ''It had burned first, then buckled.''  [Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/science/scarred-steel-holds-clues-and-remedies.html)   
***  

&gt;For example, valuable information could come from analysis of the blackened steel from the floors engulfed in flame after the airplane collisions. Steel flanges had been reduced from an inch thick to paper thin, Astaneh said. [Source](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2001/10/03_grou.html)  

***  


We need to know how the ""eutectic action"" happened that's why astaneh's timeframe is important. [Can you imagine 15.8mm of steel gone in 8](http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/vbimghost.php?do=displayimg&amp;imgid=27691) days or an inch of steel turning to a ""[razor sharpness](https://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)"" in just 2 weeks?   


[Dr. Astaneh-Asl findings are similar to FEMA's](http://imgur.com/ijKf1J6) ""It is also possible that the phenomenon started prior to collapse and accelerated the weakening of the steel structure. A detailed study into the mechanisms of this phenomenon is needed to determine what risk, if any, is presented to existing steel structures exposed to severe and long-burning fires. 

Where is the scientific intrigue as to why severe steel wastage happened so quickly?  


&gt;The simple truth could be lying in a manual somewhere.  

This appears to be the direction things are heading.

&gt;Just after reaching our cruise altitude of FL350 we noticed a faint, unidentifiable burning smell. We double checked all circuit breaker panels and found them all to be normal. We then called the flight attendant, who was in the rear of the aircraft. We asked her if she had notice an odor. She in fact had noticed an odor while retrieving something from the galley and was now, along with the passengers in the rear of the aircraft, noticing the odor in the rear of the cabin.

PERSONAL DEFENSE SPRAYS: EFFECTS AND MANAGEMENT OF EXPOSURE  


&gt;Federal laws prohibit the transportation of defense sprays on commercial aircraft.44 The reason for this prohibition is obvious; given the fact that most aircraft recirculate a considerable percentage of cabin air, *a leaking or ruptured canister could incapacitate the flight crew as well as passengers*.  


&gt; Anxiety, fear, and disorientation, sometimes to the point of panic, are normal reactions in untrained individuals     
&gt;It is inevitable that patients wearing contact lenses will be exposed to defense sprays.

It may be good to ask here what exactly was able to be seen going on in the buildings while they were collapsing?  

All three videos show open air burning that resembles [what was falling out of a tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LivXaOguXRA) before collapse.   

Reference.  

&gt;[FAQ #14:](http://www1.ae911truth.org/en/affiliate-marketing-program/899-what-was-the-molten-metal-seen-pouring-out-of-the-south-tower-minutes-before-its-collapse-steel-and-iron-or-aluminum-andor-lead.html) What was the Molten Metal Seen Pouring Out of the South Tower Minutes Before its Collapse — Steel and Iron, or Aluminum and/or Lead?   

***    

Smoke color suggests the presence of thermite which is
dense [white smoke](http://postimg.org/image/c1yn3r55l/) with very little odor.  Seems if cables, plastic and other office furnishings were somehow burning after being pulverized the color of the smoke would be black?  
***  




&gt;...and the absence of aluminum in the red/grey flakes found in the debris proved that was not thermate in the end.

Of course we'd need to see your source and contrast it with available research.  

&gt;The chemical signatures found in the [red layers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150627150511/http://www.alienscientist.com/images/nanoth.jpg) are also quite consistent (Fig. 7), each showing the presence of aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), iron (Fe) and oxygen (O), and a significant carbon (C) peak as well. [Source](http://www.alienscientist.com/nanothermite.html)  
***  


&gt;So, it clearly wasn't thermite/ thermate.   


The red/gray chips appear to be Nanoengineered explosives.   

 
A [1996 Patent on Nanoengineered explosives](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5505799.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5505799&amp;RS=PN/5505799) says this:  


&gt;In addition to beryllium, aluminum, and titanium, other inorganic elements or reactive metals such as lithium (Li), calcium (Ca), zirconium (Zr), and yttrium (Y), may be used. Also, the inorganic oxides of other metals, such as gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), nickle (Ni), cobalt (Co), molybdenium (Mo), tin (Sn), and germanium (Ge) may be used. While carbon is the preferred organic component layer between the reactive layer and the oxide layer, other organic components (i.e. polymer films) which will react with both but also prevents any passivating reaction between the reactive material and the inorganic oxide material, may be used. Experimental verification thus far has only involved the use of carbon, as the organic separation layer or component.   

 
The finding of the paper [Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe] (http://benthamopen.com/ABSTRACT/TOCPJ-2-7) shows similarity.  


&gt;*The [consistently rhombic-shaped, faceted appearance of the iron-rich grains](http://web.archive.org/web/20150627200052/http://www.alienscientist.com/images/nanothermit.jpg) strongly suggests that they are crystalline. From these data, it is determined that the red/gray chips from different WTC dust samples are extremely similar in their chemical and structural makeup. It is also shown that within the red layer there is an intimate mixing of the Fe-rich grains and Al/Si plate-like particles and that these particles are embedded in a carbon-rich matrix.*   

We know the red gray chips are thicker than the 1996 patent discription but we also need to know what other developments happened in the eight years from the Energetic composites patent to 2001.  
   


&gt;[1993 patent Energetic composites](http://www.google.de/patents/US5266132)

Needs a source for the insurance bit.  


&gt;If it is true that steel-frame buildings can collapse from fire alone, it is crucial for owners of existing structures and insurers to understand the risk of a sudden fire-induced collapse so that structural repairs and risk adjustments can be factored in. Given the official story, it is remarkable how little insurance premiums, or even design parameters and building construction codes,vi have been modified (if at all) to address the possibility of catastrophic fire-induced progressive collapse. The fact that they have not been modified indicates that insurance companies do not accept the PC hypothesis.

7228,"More info.  


The maximum takeoff weight for a Boeing 707-320B is 336,000 pounds.  
The maximum takeoff weight for a Boeing 767-200ER is 395,000 pounds.   


The wingspan of a Boeing 707 is 146 feet.  
The wingspan of a Boeing 767 is 156 feet.   


The length of a Boeing 707 is 153 feet.  
The length of a Boeing 767 is 159 feet.   


The Boeing 707 could carry 23,000 gallons of fuel.  
The Boeing 767 could carry 23,980 gallons of fuel.   

The cruise speed of a Boeing 707 is 607 mph = 890 ft/s,  
The cruise speed of a Boeing 767 is 530 mph = 777 ft/s.  


So, the Boeing 707 and 767 are very similar aircraft, with the main differences being that the 767 is slightly heavier and the 707 is faster.   


In designing the towers to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707, the designers would have assumed that the aircraft was operated normally. So they would have assumed that the aircraft was traveling at its cruise speed (i.e., not at faster speeds perhaps flown by suicide pilots). With this in mind, we can calculate the energy that the plane would impart to the towers in any accidental collision.  


The kinetic energy released by the impact of a Boeing 707 at cruise speed is  
= 0.5 x 336,000 x (890)^2/32.174   
= 4.136 billion ft lbs force (5,607,720 Kilojoules).   


The kinetic energy released by the impact of a Boeing 767 at cruise speed is  
= 0.5 x 395,000 x (777)^2/32.174   
= 3.706 billion ft lbs force (5,024,650 Kilojoules).   


From this, we see that under normal flying conditions, a Boeing 707 would smash into the WTC with about 10 percent more energy than would the slightly heavier Boeing 767. That is, under normal flying conditions, a Boeing 707 would do more damage than a Boeing 767.  

So what can be said about the actual impacts?  

The speed of impact of AA Flight 11 was 470 mph = 689 ft/s.  
The speed of impact of UA Flight 175 was 590 mph = 865 ft/s.  

The kinetic energy released by the impact of AA Flight 11 was  
= 0.5 x 395,000 x (689)^2/32.174 
= 2.914 billion ft lbs force (3,950,950 Kilojoules).  


This is well within limits that the towers were built to survive. So why did the North tower fall?   


The kinetic energy released by the impact of UA Flight 175 was  
= 0.5 x 395,000 x (865)^2/32.174  
= 4.593 billion ft lbs force (6,227,270 Kilojoules).   


This is within 10 percent of the energy released by the impact of a Boeing 707 at cruise speed. So, it would be also a surprise for the 767 impact to have caused the South tower to fall.

The cruise speed of a Boeing 767 is 530 mph = 777 ft/s.  

The Boeing 707 and 767 are very similar aircraft, with the main differences being that the 767 is slightly heavier and the 707 is faster.  


Since the Boeing 707 had a higher thrust to weight ratio, it would be traveling faster on take-off and on landing.  


The thrust to weight ratio for a Boeing 707 is 4 x 18,000/336,000 = 0.214286.  


The thrust to weight ratio for a Boeing 767 is 2 x 31,500/395,000 = 0.159494.  

In all the likely variations of an accidental impact with the WTC, the Boeing 707 would be traveling faster. In terms of impact damage, this higher speed would more than compensate for the slightly lower weight of the Boeing 707.  


In conclusion we can say that if the twin towers were designed to survive the impact of a Boeing 707, then they were necessarily designed to survive the impact of a Boeing 767.  [Source](http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/boeing_707_767.html)

What the World Trade Center Building Designers Said: **Before and After 9/11** [Source](http://911blogger.com/news/2007-02-07/what-world-trade-center-building-designers-said-and-after-911)   
***  


Before dismissing Frank one must know the whole story...   


Alan Reiss - Port Authority NY/NJ

&gt;Alan Reiss was the PANYNJ's World Trade Center Director, and as such was considered ""mayor"" of the WTC. Reiss was employed at the WTC since 1984, working on building systems, the engineering and capital program, and eventually helping to secure major leases for tenants like Banker's Trust and Fuji Bank. In 1988, he was promoted to the position of the World Trade Center's supervising engineer, in charge of the complex's major systems. He was later promoted to Special Assistant to the Director, and eventually, WTC Director.  


&gt;Reiss took the lead in the response to the 1993 terrorist bombing at the WTC, and it was reported that -- ""As Special Assistant to the Director, he managed the design and construction team that restored the World Trade Center's infrastructure, allowing the Twin Towers to reopen within a month."" At the time he was put in charge of reconstruction, ""a job that required him to meet with top brass twice a day."" Reiss said about this period -- ""there were so many innovations we made.... After the 1993 bombing, we implemented a ten-year redevelopment program. We were spending half a billion dollars on upgrades. It was an engineer's dream.""  


&gt;Part of these upgrades involved constructing new command and control centers throughout the buildings. A new Security Command Center was built on the 22nd floor of the north tower (WTC 1), and a new Operations Control Center was constructed in the B1 level of the south tower (WTC2). Additionally, NYC officials responded to the 1993 bombing by establishing The Office of Emergency Management (OEM), over a period of years, ""to promote unified operations between and among the various city emergency responder departments."" The OEM was controversial, in that it was not appreciated by the NYPD, which already had an emergency center. But ultimately, ""on September 11, 2001, the OEM center located at WTC 7 became ineffective as WTC 7 was evacuated."" During Rudy Giuliani's run for President, he and his former employee Jerome Hauer traded accusations about who made the choice of putting the OEM in WTC 7.

&gt;When interviewed after the attacks, Alan Reiss ""compared the energy of the planes' impacts to the detonation of a tactical nuclear weapon. But he said the buildings' construction may have saved some lives."" Reiss had the highest level of access to the towers, as would be expected for the Director of the WTC. But what is most interesting about Alan Reiss is the evidence that he was not telling the truth after the attacks. The first part of this evidence has to do with his surprising story of what happened to him on that day, and the visible evidence of his experience.  


&gt;Many senior managers at the PANYNJ who had knowledge of the buildings died on 9/11 trying to help others escape, but Reiss survived. In his testimony to the 9/11 Commission, Reiss stated -- ""We were stunned when 2 WTC was also hit by a plane. The police officers and I rushed to the rear emergency exit and looked up at the tower and realized we were at war...At the Port Authority Police's request, I then returned to the vicinity of 6 World Trade Center to assess the condition of One World Trade Center with then-Captain Whitaker, commander of the PA Police at the WTC, just as the tower began to collapse. We were both enveloped by this churning black debris cloud as we ran north on West Street. It was darker than any burning building I have ever been in as a volunteer fireman, and it was next to impossible to breathe due to the debris in the air.""  


&gt;One problem with Reiss' testimony is that people who had been ""enveloped by [the] churning black debris cloud"" were completely covered in dust. But Alan Reiss, who is said to have narrowly escaped the 1993 bombing as well, did not appear to have any dust or debris on him despite having been covered by the dust clouds. An interview with Reiss just moments after the destruction of the towers, in which Reiss' police escort turned his back on Reiss and appeared unusually uncomfortable, demonstrated this fact.  


&gt;A second piece of evidence indicating that Alan Reiss was being less than truthful after the attacks includes this quote -- ""Even if someone had told me the threat was a missile, I don't know what I could have done, let alone if someone had told me it was going to be a plane. No one ever thought about a hijacked plane being rammed into a building.""  

He caught whatever [Condi had](http://web.archive.org/web/20150619233747/http://www.htmlpublish.com/newTestDocStorage/DocStorage/423dac30b92e4050b29795ededce3c2c/Columbine1999.htm)  



&gt;The reasons that Reiss should have been aware of the possibility included the fact that several people Reiss would have known had thought about this very scenario, including the WTC tower's design engineer, John Skilling. In a 1993 interview, Skilling said that, in the event of an airliner crash into one of the towers, ""the building structure would still be there."" One of Reiss' own staff members, Frank A. DeMartini, the Manager of WTC Construction, was videotaped explaining how the towers could have withstood multiple impacts from aircraft. Another person that Reiss would have worked with closely throughout the security upgrades, Brian Michael Jenkins, had also assessed the possibility of an airplane attack on the WTC.

Earliest I know was Dr. Astaneh-Asl.  His account places an 8 hour timeframe on the eutectic action that caused the severe steel wastage. Severe corrosion, deep mystery, novel phenomenon, very unusual event, etc.  
 


&gt;One piece Dr. Astaneh-Asl saw was a charred horizontal I-beam from 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story skyscraper that collapsed from fire eight hours after the attacks. The beam, so named because its cross-section looks like a capital I, had clearly endured searing temperatures. Parts of the flat top of the I, once five-eighths of an inch thick, had vaporized.  

&gt;Less clear was whether the beam had been charred after the collapse, as it lay in the pile of burning rubble, or whether it had been engulfed in the fire that led to the building's collapse, which would provide a more telling clue.  


&gt;The answer lay in the beam's twisted shape. As weight pushed down, the center portion had buckled outward.  


&gt;''This tells me it buckled while it was attached to the column,'' not as it fell, Dr. Astaneh-Asl said, adding, ''It had burned first, then buckled.''  [Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/science/scarred-steel-holds-clues-and-remedies.html)

Probably best to continue to weigh all the evidence.  

&gt;Was anyone to present this to an actual peer reviewed publication, they wouldn't even get to the peer review process, they'd have to rewrite completly before facing that part of the process.  

It looks like ASCE is the clear violator of the peer review process. Imagine the implications of this deception! People are counting on the gov to get it right and we see the evidence presented isn't what it says it is. You must have read this paper and quite possibly overlooked the fact the sources weren't public and nobody could duplicate what had been published? What does it say about the ASCE that a paper for the governments version is in clear violation and still published. It's amazing the editor didn't quit! No doubt it gives pause to think about the remaining papers of support.  

&gt;Let's not take into account that one of the worlds highest skyscrapers just fell, dumping debris on top and on the side of the building.  

Let's take this fact into account. What's the relationship between axial walk-off and the impact of the tower on 7?

Analysis of Structural Response of WTC 7 to Fire and Sequential Failures Leading to Collapse 

This paper attempted to peer review the nist report but it didn't cite any publicly accessible sources.

[A previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/39y71v/open_challenge_to_anybody_in_rconspiracy_in/cs7n8te?context=3) may prove informative.  

&gt;**Analysis of Structural Response of WTC 7 to Fire and Sequential Failures Leading to Collapse**  
  

Unfortunately it doesn't reference any public sources sufficient to verify the conclusions. For example, structural calculations demonstrating the ""walk-off"" failure mechanism that hypothetically triggered the progressive collapse are unavailable.  WALK-OFF is important.  


**It seems strange it was allowed in the ASCE Journal at all?**

Food for thought.  
  

**Within the first ten years after “9/11”, the mainstream peer-reviewed literature, worldwide, contained no paper on WTC 7 that concludes with the Progressive Collapse (PC) hypothesis** (Note: Two such PC papers appear in the short-lived Journal of Debunking 9/11 Conspiracy Theories);  
***  

**Within the first ten years, there are 15 distinct CD papers (i.e., arguing for the Controlled Demolition hypothesis, that address WTC 7)**    

&gt;Overall, **from 9/11/01 through 12/31/2012**, there are 35 distinct CD papers versus 25 PC papers; among these, **16 of the CD papers address WTC 7 whereas only 4 PC papers do so**, again indicating overall the importance of the CD hypothesis;.

7266,"**17 Jeb Bush's preparation for Florida State of Emergency**  

**On September 7, 2001,** George W. Bush’s brother and Florida Governor Jeb Bush signed **Florida Executive Order No. 01-261** which states, in part:
&gt;*“I hereby delegate to The Adjutant General of the State of Florida all necessary authority, within approved budgetary appropriations or grants, to order members of the Florida National Guard into active service… for the purpose of training to support law-enforcement personnel and emergency-management personnel in the event of civil disturbances…”*  

&gt;This order effectively placed the Florida National Guard, a unit of the federal U.S. Army, in service of Florida law enforcement and the Florida Emergency Management department four days prior to 9/11.  

&gt;**On the morning of September 11**, Jeb Bush signed **Florida Executive Order No. 01-262** immediately after the second WTC tower fell, making Florida the first state in the U.S. to declare a “State of Emergency” – even before New York and Washington D.C.:  


&gt;*“I hereby declare that a state of emergency exists in the State of Florida... The authority to suspend the effect of any statute or rule governing the conduct of state business, and the further authority to suspend the effect of any order or rule of any governmental entity... The authority to seize and utilize any and all real or personal property as needed to meet this emergency... The authority to order the evacuation of any or all persons from any location in the State of Florida, and the authority to regulate the movement of any or all persons to or from any location in the State; The authority to regulate the return of the evacuees to their home communities... I hereby order the Adjutant General to activate the Florida National Guard for the duration of this emergency.”*  


&gt;This latter move may be plausible given the presence of the president of the United States in the state during surprise attacks by terrorists. **In the context of complicity theories, however, it is quite sensible that these two orders – numerically back-to-back, four days apart, one before and one on 9/11 – were put in place in case the plan went awry and it became necessary to take extraordinary measures to protect one or both Bushes from their own government and/or citizenry.**  
 

&gt;Under complicity theories, the additional sightings of suspicious Middle Eastern men stalking President Bush in Sarasota Florida earlier that morning – driving a large van and requesting entrance to the resort where he was staying – might have provided later evidence for and a means to trigger a state of emergency, if it became necessary.

7280,"Lt. Walsh- Answer: What else I observed in the lobby was that – there’s basically two areas of elevators. There’s elevators off to the left-hand side which are really the express elevators. That would be the elevators that’s facing north. Then on the right-hand side there’s also elevators that are express elevators, and that would be facing south. In the center of these two elevator shafts would be elevators that go to the lower floors. They were blown off the hinges. That’s where the service elevator was also.  


Chief Congiusta- Question: Were these elevators that went to the upper floors? They weren’t side lobby elevators?  


Answer: No, no, I’d say that they went through floors 30 and below.

Question: And they were blown off?

Answer: They were blown off the hinges, and you could see the shafts. The elevators on the extreme north side and the other express elevator on the extreme south side, they looked intact to me from what I could see, the doors anyway…….
…….So I headed for the B stairway. I did not want to deal with elevators. So Ladder 1—  


Question: Were there any elevators working or no? Probably no, I assume.  


Answer: I couldn’t tell about the express elevators. The elevators that I mentioned before that were on the extreme north end and the extreme south end, I don’t know about those elevators. But I headed for where the service elevator was, which was in the center where the lower floor elevators were, the ones where the doors were blown off them.  

----------------------------  


&gt;Lieutenant Walsh makes an extremely relevant point when he shows that the local elevator shafts acted as a conduit for the explosive effects and thereby limits the source of the explosion to the area covered by those shafts. His evidence shows that the elevator shafts affected by the explosions served only the lower floors and not those at the impact levels, thereby ruling out jet fuel from the aircraft as being involved in the explosions.

We're left to ponder why.

&gt;The AIA believes that incidents involving the catastrophic failure of buildings and other structures must be investigated using the highest standards of science-based investigation and analysis in order to provide accurate and meaningful information in the development of model building codes. In adherence to the scientific method, investigations should:   

&gt;• Consider all available data;  
&gt;• Consider hypotheses that most readily explain the available data;  
&gt;• Test those hypotheses and analyze the results without bias; and  
&gt;• Provide for external review and replication by making all data available.    

&gt;The AIA recognizes that many members of the architecture profession believe the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigation into the complete collapse of 7 World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, did not adhere to these principles and, as a result, the conclusions of the NIST investigation are fatally flawed. The AIA believes this perspective merits further study and supports a new investigation into the complete collapse of 7 World Trade Center.

Evidence points towards the cockpit doors being closed. 

*FAR 121.586 states that the lockable door separating the crew compartment and passenger compartment on commercial aircraft must be closed and locked during flight.*   

With or without the doors open is it to be believed the pilots didn't hear any commotion while the hijackers were obtaining keys, killing people and gaining entry?   

No successful hijackings in the USA since the 1970s and and on 9/11 130 pound hijackers attacked eight pilots (some military trained) killed them without leaving evidence of a yoke, pedal or cockpit door moved, no calls for help from three planes and zero transponder hijack code sent?  

&gt;2.) The transponders were turned off by the attackers.  

I disagree.   

&gt;The 9/11 Commission Report provides no evidence to show that hijackers manually deactivated three transponders to cause the loss of ATC data.   


&gt;The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) 9/11 flight studies make no reference dealing with why the transponder signals for these flights were lost.

From a 1993 patent  on [Energetic composites](http://www.google.de/patents/US5266132)  on MIC's (metastable interstitial composites).  


&gt;*A method for providing chemical energy and energetic compositions of matter consisting of thin layers of substances which will exothermically react with one another.*  
 

  
  


&gt;However, it does bring up a point on if the ignition temperature of thermite can be significantly altered in the nano-regime.  

Maybe take heat out of the mix entirely?  
  

&gt;The reactions in MICs may be initiated by means of mechanical stress, exposure to an electron beam, a high voltage electrical discharge, a laser pulse, etc. Any method which disrupts the buffer layers may be used. It is not necessary to disrupt all buffer layers by an external mechanism as reaction of a pair of reactive layers will cause other layers to react. Thin films of the model system having a total of about 1000 reactant layers, each 100 Angstroms thick, and buffer layers formed during deposition were ignited by a gentle touch with a probe. Thicker composites (100 reactant layers, each 1000 Angstroms thick) required a hammer blow and even thicker MICs could not be started by a hammer blow.

No better time than the present.  
  
 
  
  
&gt;If there is one guiding principle to our nation it is the rule of law. It protects the unpopular view, it restrains fear‐based responses in times of trouble, and it sanctifies individual liberty regardless of wealth, faith, or color. The Constitution defines the limits of the Defendants’ authority; detaining individuals as if they were terrorists, in the most restrictive conditions of confinement available, simply because these individuals were, or appeared to be, Arab or Muslim exceeds those limits. It might well be that national security concerns motivated the Defendants to take action, but that is of little solace to those who felt the brunt of that decision. The suffering endured by those who were imprisoned merely because they were caught up in the hysteria of the days immediately following 9/11 is not without a remedy.
