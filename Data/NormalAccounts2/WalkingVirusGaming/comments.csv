0,"**Trinimmortal** - I used to be heavy into League of Legends when I found him so that kind of started the interest but he just seems very genuine to himself and is very animated and puts a lot of effort into what he does, he also is not afraid to do really really stupid things because he thinks they're funny.

**TotalBiscuit** - Others have already said all that needs to be said of TotalBiscuit but the main reason I enjoy him is his honest commentary that aims to help consumers and he does not try to push his own opinion of whether a game is fun or not because he knows that opinion varies, I appreciate that he tries to make it more so of the mechanics and longevity of the game to give people a better idea if the game is for them.",2016-11-22 01:33:13+00:00,daadap8,1.0,t3_5dz8p4,113072.0,Gaming4Gamers

133,"Hello there U/BananaBenYT Friendly neighborhood mod here, first and foremost which post are you speaking of specifically? The most likely reasoning your post is being removed is we request a specific format be followed for feedback requests, this format can be found below as well as posted as the top comment of our [NewTubers Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/4xv6ip/newtubers_rules_v20/). While I do not appreciate you referring to the rules as pathetic, I understand you are frustrated, simply follow the format and you should be fine. I hope you enjoy the rest of your time in the sub and have a great rest of your day! 

An example of how to use Feedback Request Flair:

    Title:

The correct format for the Requesting Feedback flair is [Genre] Title. For Example:

    [Let’s Play] Looking for help with tags

    [Vlog] Is my lighting okay?

    [Travel] Are my transitions too abrupt?

    Content:

The correct format for the Request Feedback flair is Strengths: and Weaknesses: For Example.

    Strengths: I have good audio, and I know that the communication with my partner is mostly funny and entertaining.

    Weaknesses: I think that I speak too slow and perhaps use too large of words for my audience. I also am worried that the transitions can be jarring, and my intro gets a lot of complaints, but I thinks it’s really cool.

- Nostalgia Critic/Linkara from Channel Awesome - just always appreciated their humor mixed with review format

- TeamFourStar - just all the work they put into everything and all they deal with as far as fan demands is really amazing XD.

163,"Hello there, one of the friendly neighborhood mods here, a couple of things to bring up here, firstly, we do not allow posts purely for the sake of promotion, your posts have to start some kind of discussion with the community. Secondly, we do not allow link posts for a reason on this subreddit and that is what your post looks like it is intended to be from the way you have created the threads title.

For your reference I have a link to the [NewTubers Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/4tnblx/newtubers_rules_v10/)

164,"Hey Clay, I arise from my lurky depths to try to provide some feedback!

Positives:

1 - Actual presentation of information kept slower parts interesting.

2 - Your voice/tone suits this kind of video IMO, particularly adding in that unlike some review style videos I've seen your tone actually changes =D

3 - The video quality seemed very good, did not notice any kind of stutters or odd happenings in the video.

Negatives

1 - While the audio is definitely a lot better than before, I have to agree with most of the other people that you could probably do with a bit different mixing going on, your voice can get drowned out as well as I think I hear a bit of static from increasing the gain too much on your audio track to compensate for the game being loud, my recommendation when you go to record is to give a test recording of about 15 seconds saying some things while doing something relatively loud in the game, then see if your voice gets drowned, if it does, lower the game volume more.

2 - Not enough Krillin deaths...that is all

Hope that's useful to you clay XD",2016-08-03 00:20:28+00:00,d61swyk,1.0,t3_4vu9iz,18062.0,NewTubers

Positives:

1)Very good concept for a skit between videos to amp up hype as you said, just need a bit of work on execution and I think you have a good idea there.

2)Editing was well done for the most part!

Negatives:

1)Mic quality was hit or miss in the video, there were points where it seemed alright and then others where it just seemed to have quite a bit of static.

2)As someone else has pointed out, you energy level could do with a bit of a pickup in this video, that and cutting out a bit of the pausing could have made this significantly better IMO.

Positives:

1)Use of edits to accentuate the banter and gameplay! I am a big supporter of using additional edits to enhance the experience for viewers and this always shows more effort to me.

2)Energy remained high and constant! This is always a very important factor to maintain audience engagement, although it kind of sounded like Ziad got a bit lower energy towards the later half of the vid.

3)Super Manly Voice XD...you know what this is XD.

Negatives:

1)Mic quality could us a bit of work(although you already noted that)

2)While the banter was constant and high energy it did not particularly capture my attention but I am rather odd sometimes &gt;_&gt;

1-sorry if it came off confusing, that's probably partially my fault as I used to say something to the effect of ""let's take a look at what went wrong and find the bright side of X"" that probably would have cut down significantly on the confusion XD, I also think that your format idea is an interesting one, but I think keeping the second half lets it end on a positive note which is mostly the note I want taken away anyway XD.

289,"What are you using for editing? And as far as only playing them for a bit you played contra for at least 20-30 mins which could have been a video in and of itself, as far as doing hour long videos because you feel comfortable making them, then just keep doing your thing, just realize that not a lot of people have an hour to dedicate to a video of someone they're not sure if they're interested in, which could negatively affect your viewer retention. As far as adding graphics, usually video editors have some option to have multiple video tracks, you would basically have the gameplay be at the forefront with the graphic behind it and just crop the forefront video to the edge of the game screen so all that comes through those sides is the graphics you have underneath it. As far as not knowing entirely how to edit [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-zrVMKHuto) did a video on editing stuff in power director pro but most of what he talks about can be transferred to other editing programs. It should be useful if you don't have any clue what's going on editing wise, hope that helps and let me know if you have other questions and I'll try to help out how I can",2016-07-09 02:38:40+00:00,d5544pe,4.0,t1_d553rgj,682.0,NewTubers
290,"So first point I'll say as far as feedback is probably reduce the video lengths, particularly if you're playing multiple games just cut the episode into an episode for each game, a lot of times people won't want to watch a hour long gameplay video of someone they don't have any attachment to as usually people like let's plays for the personality attached and if they don't know you then they are likely to see the 1 hour time and not click on it. Aside from that for older games that end up with black bars on the side having some kind of graphic on the side instead of blank screen can do wonders for making it look better. Also I don't know why there was no sound going behind you for contra but gameplay sound behind it or some type of music to fill the dead space can do wonders for the commentary as well. Aside from that try to avoid having the cursor in the center of your screen as that can be kind of distracting as well XD, perhaps also edit some of the more dull bits like the repeated deaths in contra to keep things flowing, or turn the deaths into some kind of comedy montage or a joke of some kind, something to make it interesting XD, anyhow that's just ideas for that, hope that helps!",2016-07-09 02:12:21+00:00,d5539hb,2.0,t1_d5523j5,2100.0,NewTubers
291,"God I loved the streets of rage games when I got the chance to play them (I only had the sega at my dad's house XD) but anyways on to the feedback. As far as audio levels I felt the game could have probably been turned down slightly so as to not overpower you in some instances. As far as audio quality it seemed like there was a decent amount of white noise(possibly from gain boosting your audio?) but aside from that your speech felt kind of monotone, it perked up a bit when you talked about you and your sister playing the game when you were younger but other than that you seemed kind of disinterested for the video. That's just my 2 cents for it anyway XD, hope that helps in some way!",2016-07-09 01:37:20+00:00,d5523in,2.0,t1_d550j09,2789.0,NewTubers

There were a few parts in the video where your audio cut out very oddly like it just skipped a word or something, could have happened in recording could have happened in editing, just something to keep an eye on. Other than that I thought the video was edited together very nicely and your script for it sounded good just needed to have that extra bit of you going on to make it better =D.

295,"As far as what made me want to make one, I just really wanted to entertain people, I know just how much entertainment can provide an escape from the harsh plane of reality, when I first started the channel, I had no idea what I even wanted to do, I dabbled in reviewing free to play games, then moved to a let's play/dub over undertale, then I figured out the series I'm currently doing where i find positive things about poorly received games, it finally seemed to click with me and I've been trying to figure out ways to make that more enjoyable for everyone so I can hopefully brighten up more peoples days. Aside from entertaining people it's also fun to do all the editing and just getting to have that interaction with my subs as well as other content creators. 

As far as goals I've hit i recently hit 100 subs which was the goal to hit before July so thanks to all the people who made that possible XD, as far as next the goal is to continue to learn new ways to improve the series and hopefully hit the 200 mark before October so I can brighten up more peoples day.

I'm honestly not sure what I would suggest to improve the series aside from continue to get more comfortable with commentary(which just comes with time XD)",2016-07-07 23:52:49+00:00,d53k6lb,1.0,t3_4rowy2,32844.0,NewTubers

**1 -** Your commentary audio did not seem to sync up properly with your face cam visuals, I am guessing you record the audio in a separate file and then sync them up during post, which isn't a bad thing, just something you need to watch out for and pay extra special attention to throughout the whole video, and speaking of things to watch out for...

**2 -** at about the 9:11 timestamp there's just a quiet black screen for about 6-8 seconds, it was extremely jarring and felt like a very odd thing to be there.

351,"I would agree to a certain extent, I like gaming channels, most of my subscriptions are to gaming channels, but here is some of the reasons why I sometimes find it hard to give feedback to let's play videos.

1) **The Video Length** - This is more of a personal quirk for the most part, if I start a video I feel a need to finish it in that sitting, and if the video is over 10 minutes long it becomes increasingly difficult for me to focus long enough to give completely accurate and useful feedback, particularly if I do not like the persons style of commentary(we all have different tastes and that's not a bad thing XD). Now sometimes this difficult focusing can be alleviated by some advanced editing tricks, or visual gags of some type, to keep the audience engaged.

2) **The Critic Syndrome** - If you are reviewing and critiquing nothing but let's play videos for, let's say 1-2 hours, you are going to get burned out relatively quickly if you do not happen upon any channels that are doing something differently, particularly when some of the videos are upwards of 25-30 mins.

3) **The Imitators** - A good portion of the times I don't like peoples commentary is because they're trying to be someone else rather than being themselves. I can understand creating a persona or something for your let's play because at least it's still you(in a way XD).

Now, I do still try to give feedback to these channels as well as the other channel types which I have no clue what makes a good one (AKA Vlog, Music, etc. etc.), but like you said I just focus my feedback on the aspects that I do know at least something about, got kind of sidetracked there but moral of the long rant is as follows:

I agree that people need to stop complaining about not being able to give feedback to gaming channels because there is plenty you can still help them with, however I can also see why they would be burn out by it, we all just need to reach a happy medium and continue trying to help each other grow!

Also are you using a audio clean up program to boost your vocals up or are you just doing the noise removal?

Now as far as your video, I thought that it was put together very well, editing seemed really tight and spot on (I also loved that dumb founded/confused look when you had the sonic case in your hand XD) The audio mixing seemed really good as well as the choice of music to play during varying parts of the review.

Although the thumbnails for your videos kind of seem to flip flop back and forth in terms of quality, like your Ratchet and Clank ones/Outlast ones seem pretty good, but your resident evil ones seem a bit lackluster in comparison, in addition to having their episode numbers behind the actual run time in the bottom right.

Audio quality and levels seem really good, very crisp vocal track, the indiana jones music during the boulder part was a little soft but that might have been intentional XD.

I think your channel art is great as well(I just found it really funny for some reason XD).

The only real negative thing comes down to personal preference and that's the run time T_T. although I know before you get a solid fan base it is a better idea to go for shorter run times as people are more likely to invest 5-15 mins on someone they know nothing about than they are to invest 50-60 mins.

The main bit of feedback I got for you is regarding audio, your voice seemed very quiet, in addition it was a bit hard to tell due to having to crank the volume to hear clearly but it sounded like there was quiet a bit of white noise going on, now assuming I'm not crazy on that point I would highly recommend using audacity to not only clear that white noise up, but also to boost your vocal levels as well, there are good ways of doing it without having to increase the gain significantly which is always a good thing because more gain usually means more white noise XD.

As far as levels go I had to turn my headset all the way up to hear you in any discernible manner. And as far as quality goes, it may have just been having to crank my headset up to max but there seemed to be a significant amount of white noise, what are you using to record your vocals? Both what mic and what program? As far as commentary you seemed rather stiff, also from what I understand unless you're going for a bling play of a game or something to that effect it usually is a good idea to play a bit of the game prior to attempting a series on it so you can have less moments of dead time figuring out what's going on, or in the case that you don't do that and go in blind sometimes cutting those confused parts can be a good idea as well.",2016-06-01 23:51:05+00:00,d3sfq0d,2.0,t1_d3rabwx,74292.0,NewTubers

Description: My channel's main series is a game analysis looking at games that are either considered bad or got some kind of bad press and finding the positive things they brought to the table.

As far as what inspired me to do youtube I just always enjoyed entertaining people, pretty much every facet of my life has been entertaining people so I thought I'd try making videos to add to that haha.

Some Youtubers that I really enjoy/get inspiration from would probably be Trinimmortal and Boogie2988, as well as GradeAUnderA.

My personal Favorite from my series currently is probably a toss up between my Diablo 3 and Fable The Journey episodes as I feel like that is where I started learning how to make the videos a bit more engaging to watch.

Thanks much to everyone who read this far and I hope you all have an awesome rest of your day =D. I'll do my best to check out some of you guys inbetween Work and IRL stuff that comes up XD.",2016-06-01 02:14:34+00:00,d3r87kd,1.0,t3_4lyvwr,882.0,NewTubers

Only other bit of feedback would be maybe make the videos slightly shorter as it's easier to watch a 5-10 minute video for people than it is a 15-25 min video, but that's up to you =D. Audio seemed pretty good, you're using some kind of audio clean up program like audacity yes?

However if for example i was unable to record voice work for a majority of the characters on my undertale play through, where the main point is the varied voice work I was doing, then I would just refrain and say what was up somewhere, either on YouTube or some social media.

873,"Hey there, as far as the thumbnail goes it did look pretty good, it probably could have been tweaked slightly as at first it was a bit difficult for me to tell what it was, but it's still way better than anything I've been able to make so far so respect for that haha. I watched some of the other episodes and there's definitely noticeable improvements in some of the editing from earlier episodes. One thing that I noticed with the skits and the intro song is they were a bit softer than the rest of the video, so may want to keep an eye on that in post.

I think the frame work of the episodes are fairly well done and even though the humor didn't resonate with me I could see people wanting to watch more of draggy. Hope that this information helps you in some way and I hope you have a great rest of your day!

923,"So I watched your latest superhot video and I have a few bits of feedback for that specifically, for the general feedback it's mostly the same as travis and final boss have said about the thumbnails and audio levels, although on the topic of audio levels, when you are cleaning up your audio are you just using the noise reduction effect or are you using any others? Now for the specific feedback for the superhot video, when you were having the long moments of difficulty getting to the next core jump you sped up the video, which is fine, but left it completely quiet for the duration of the speed up. This could probably either have been cut in it's entirety to help shorten the video length or had some type of music put to it to make it more of a joke to keep engagement, as it stood I got quite a bit bored during the 3-4 minute stints of speed up. Just a small suggestion for that part if you have something similar happen in future videos, other than that your commentary does really come off as you truly enjoying the game which is nice, keep it up!",2016-04-05 01:49:57+00:00,d1q5rwu,1.0,t3_4daib4,54966.0,NewChannelCentral

Also in your most recent video it seemed like you kept stumbling over your words a lot which made it very difficult to follow what you were saying, it seems like you had a bit less of a  problem with that in your last top 3 snipe video so I don't know what was happening there.

Secondly, I have considered doing video for it, however currently my actual setup right now is not really capable of doing that, so I am doing it in a way that I can with that limitation haha. As far as the reading and not hearing thing, I hear you on that sometimes, my brain has problems processing what I was listening to if I'm reading stuff on occasion. I am still trying to figure out a good amount of time to keep images on there, which if you or anyone else has opinions of I would love to hear. The other concern I have of transferring to video is trying to keep that funny text commentary as the video is going I think would probably be even more distracting and hard to focus on, but I may be overthinking things haha.

I look forward to your first movie review, keep it up!",2016-03-28 03:52:20+00:00,d1fziow,2.0,t1_d1fwgqc,5630.0,NewTubers

Description: I am a gaming focused channel, the series that I will be continuing with is my bright side series, where I take a look at games that had negativity surrounding them and trying to find some of the positives that they brought to the table.

I also checked out some of your videos and I can see the improvement from some of your older videos with your newer ones, the one suggestion I would make is maybe trying to use an audio editing software like audacity to level out the audio levels. Keep up the good work and lets get conversations going!",2016-03-28 01:31:30+00:00,d1fuskh,1.0,t3_4c7f4p,12538.0,NewTubers

1051,"Watched your original megaman playthrough and thought it was pretty good, although I feel like you missed a few prime opportunities for some jokes a few of the times you would say about trying not to die and promptly dying. That's just my opinion though, keep up the good work!",2016-03-27 21:41:26+00:00,d1fmw42,1.0,t3_4c11sl,118310.0,smallgamingchannels

1054,"I watched the first episode, the game seems cool and the audio quality seemed pretty good, I just found myself jumping through the video a lot of the times you got stuck trying to figure out how to make something work.

1060,"Seemed pretty good to me, I feel you did a good job of speaking continuously so as to keep interest, which is good as Papers Please is kind of difficult to keep interest if you're not the one playing it(in my opinion). Only suggestion I might make is maybe address the camera a bit more during the interim between people to try to potentially make it seem more engaged with the audience. Keep up the good work man.",2016-02-10 01:18:28+00:00,czu75ez,1.0,t3_44z5ol,12656.0,PromoteGamingVideos
