Let's start with a few ways that you do not want your post to look

- TITLE: I Made A Video Of Me Playing (X game)

Description: I made a video that I think is funny here it is at www.  Link . com

- TITLE: www. I am just link dropping . com

- Description: [Blank] 

- TITLE: My friends and I made an epic montage, come check it out

- Description: Me and a couple of buddies made an awesome/funny montage of clips in [Insert random game here], you can check it out here: www. link . com any feedback is appreciated.

Now for those of you paying attention these things should have one glaring thing in common, they do not actually facilitate discussion or interaction with the community in helping you to improve, these are all merely aimed at garnering eyes to the video. ""But Virus"" I hear you say, ""Isn't the point of this subreddit to garner more viewers?"" While that may have been true at one point or another this subreddit has since become a place of actual community rather than just a dumping grounds where any meaningful conversation is buried by the wayside. So with that in mind I have examples of how your posts should be looking to try to get the improvements you will need as a smaller YTer, and what these type of posts actually accomplish for you.

- TITLE: New Youtuber looking to exchange meaningful feedback (Utilize the Giving Feedback Flair)

- Description: I am still a relatively new Youtuber and as such I am still in the learning stage of figuring out my biggest opportunities when it comes to my videos, I am looking for feedback to help me determine the things I need to work on and I am willing to give feedback to those who provide me with the meaningful feedback I need to grow(obviously this is vastly over explained here but I want to be clear you get the general message =P) you can find the video I think is best here: www. link . com

Now the main purpose of this kind of post is to not only give/receive feedback from each other, it is also so that you can all learn from each other, a lot of times there may be things in someones videos that you think were done really well, this can open a discussion asking how they accomplished that neat edit, or where they got inspiration for their writing, or asking them for tips on how to become more comfortable in front of the camera/mic. Even if you have to put a limit on how many people you can actually respond to in the description due to time constraints(we don't expect you to no life it here afterall =P), this type of feedback loop can be invaluable to you, particularly in the early learning stages of your video making.

But let's say you've done a few videos, you think you have a decent idea of what you'd like to improve on and have tried to improve on those things over the last couple of videos, well then that brings us to this type of post.

- TITLE: I am looking for feedback on my (audio, video, etc. etc.) in my most recent video

- Description: After receiving feedback through the community I have identified what my biggest problem areas are and have been trying to tackle them to the best of my abilities, I would like to know your guys thoughts on the audio of my most recent video here: www . link . com 
If the audio is not great what can I do to fix it(if budgetary reasons prevent you from purchasing new equipment currently express that in your description)/what would you recommend I do in the interim of new equipment?

While this type of post may not be engaging the community with specific regards to giving other members feedback you are at least looking to start discussions with the community on how to improve, which can lead to information arising for other community members who may be having the same issues as you, which might help them find a potential fix to their problem. It is important for these type of posts that the feedback you are asking for be focused on one or two specific aspects of your video so that the community is able to better give you the information you need, in other words try to focus on your biggest areas of opportunity and work on fixing those before moving on to your next area of opportunity.

Now these are just a couple of examples and are not necessarily templates, I could not hope to fathom all the odd combinations everyone would come up with but just bear in mind that if it does not start a discussion or possibly bring useful information to the community, it will probably be labeled as a Hit &amp; Run Post.

Now I also hear some of you saying ""But Virus, I need 10 comment Karma to actually start posting, how do I get this ever elusive currency?"" Well the answer is simple everyone, start going to some of the feedback threads and providing meaningful feedback to other users that are doing the same, in no time at all I am sure you will get to that elusive 10 karma, just be sure to be kind and upvote any helpful comments you see to help those people reach their 10 karma as well!

**5) Limit your video submissions to a one video per week-**  This way it isn't just a dumping ground for videos.
