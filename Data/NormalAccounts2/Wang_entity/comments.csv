The first time watching the movie I immediately noticed the part where Pitt pushes the antenna down because of the lines above him. Not because it could tangled (though it still might) but because there is a rather high chance on frying your radio.

The second thing was the (and the biggest thing for me) was how the movie portrayed the brotherhood of tankers. I can relate to it in a very similar way. Like the banter between them, how they did things, how ""IDGAF""-like they were to anything else other than their tank and their own fighting. Lighting the cigarette was one thing.

Then the tactics as well. They were portrayed well! Almost nothing to complain there.

All in all one of my favourite movies to watch if Im looking for tanks. Other movie I like watching is Ninth Company (2005) as I remember watching the tank action a lot and for example they actually used the same hand signals which I was taught!

Once also there was a slight accident inside in our tank. When I was turning my turret, something clonked. Not normal, looked down and something was pinned between turret floor and out food box. And that was pressing the battery compartment which held the turret and starting batteries. As you probably remember.

I quickly shut off power and remembered that if I leave my turret like this the driver cant get out as his exit is over the batteries. And wee lad if the batteries would have shorted. So I hand cranked the turret to 12'o'clock.

Only when putting them all in it doesnt want to boot after shutdown.

After manually booting from BIOS all 16gb of ram is usable @1333mhz and CPU&amp;GPU OC is as I want it to be.

It just really might be of the brand mixing as one commentator pointed out. Yet my friend is mixing Corsair with Kingston RAM and he doesnt have a problem.

153,"Some backstory why I bought this:

I decided to buy the SKX009K2 as a small gift to myself after I knew I got into college/university of applied sciences. I like the relaxed and the semi-formal look of this watch so I think it will fit perfectly in uni with all the young and hip students. This isn't my first Seiko 5 if you're wondering, my first was SNZH55 and it served me for three &amp; half years so far. I've also got a basic Casio retro watch as my work watch. So when ordering this I already knew how good the Seiko 5's are. 

Ordered this on Sunday and got it today and immediately swapped the nato strap on it as I have been drooling over others pictures of the same setup. Also this was my first wrist band swap and now that I know how to do it (surprisingly simple!) I might swap sometimes the jubilee wrist band back to switch it up.  So far Im in love with this watch already because I've been drooling over this for the past 6 months.

Maybe this is the start of my watch collection. I have been [watching this watch](http://www.steinhartwatches.de/en/Nav-B-Uhr-44-Vintage-TITANIUM-A-Type,441.html) for quite a while as my proper dress watch as I love the dial. Maybe I'll be getting this for Christmas.

Thank you for reading this.

205,"It was always fun to ""scare"" people by coming through bushes or trees.

This one time when new guys just started their conscript time and were learning the basics in the woods. Like assembling a tent, how to hold a weapon and shit. Well, as we share the same training area as everyone else theres a slight chance we bump into each other. Rarely though but it happened more when we were training tactics with our CV's.

We were training a very basic tactic. Just rehearsing moving side by side with roughly 50m to 100m gaps inbetween. Due to us being in a semi thick forest with some ""roads"" for our tanks. Well, to keep those distances and to not bunch of one of the tanks (our) had to spread more to the left. Well there was nothing but bushes and trees on our left. And we were allowed to go through. In fairness though, dont plow everything you see.

Driver starts going rather quickly, through bushes. Didnt hit any trees. Only mowed the bushes down. Probably about 30m into the forest, couple more bushes to get the ridge. Woosh! A bloody greenhorn camp. Like 3m infront of us.  One guy dropped his weapon and jumped backwards because he got so scared. Most of the froze and probably thought ""wait, thats a tank next to our tent."".

We also were very baffled about the situation but very quickly hit reverse and got out. ""Umm, Captain? There was a camp infront of us. We didnt go through it. Over."" as we were backing up we said over the comms. He laughed.

Couple of days later I managed to find couple of the guys who were in that particular camp and asked them did they even hear us or why did you all get so scared when we popped up. They said they didnt hear us coming, they did know that we were in the area training as well. But that exact moment they didnt hear us coming through. Also most of them really were baffled tremendeously or scared shitless.

Might to do with the fact that on CV's e exhaust is pointed straight back and really the biggest source of sound when infront of it are the tracks. Noticed and realized this later. After youre behind it its rather loud ""BAPBAPBAPBAPBAPBAP"".

In my opinion the whole game is supposed to be intense and yet there are 3rd person servers where you can check corners, over stone fences and lay in thick shubbery and still see pretty much everything. Wheres the intensity when you check a corner and see a zombie there or even a player and he doesnt even know about you because of 3rd person. Compared to actually peeking over the corner by leaning or just by walking. Theres that chance that everything will go to shit because that zombie or player will see you.

The south can push up to the bridge without pretty much any risks. When you push up to the bridge you completely deny northern spawn's spotting bushes and sniping hill area around 0-line. The mountain provides a great support/spotting location as well. From this you can spot the 0-line and snipe even to the castle roads. 

To me the red zone feels okay. Yes the castle hill roads are a bitch to dig out but you can drive under them if youre pushing in. Overall feels balanced.
Though, north spawn can snipe from the bridge through the centre road into MBT sides if they stay around the main road. Then again this is easily countered by the south pushing to the bridge.",2016-05-15 17:04:28+00:00,d36h5sz,1.0,t3_4jgpk0,3460.0,ArmoredWarfare

327,"I might be picky because I was a long time player from WoT. For me it feels very odd when youre trying to switch from tier 8 to tier 5 for example and with the amount of tanks most of the players have it takes ages. In WoT you could press mouse 1 and then ""throw"" the carousel and it will slide surprisingly far. In Armored Warfare it feels odd when it just suddenly stops. Usually one ""throw"" will barely take me from tier 8 to 7, then from 7 to end of 7 and so forth. This might be just getting used to it but I still feel weird using this tactic in AW. I have been avoiding using the scroll wheel and using mouse 1 to move about in the carousel. Im using usually the arrows in AW.

TL;DR: You cannot click and throw the carousel from one end to middle in one quick motion. It stops after like 5-8 tanks. Yes, I know. I'm picky^:(

330,"Applique over ERA &amp; Cage.

Even in PvP I feel like applique bounces shots from autocannons a lot more, angled properly of course. With ERA &amp; Cage I feel like you only have a slight advantage over MBT's firing HEAT. And most of the time unless youre last they have AP loaded for their advantage if they see an MBT.

Especially in PVE applique is the best option. In 0.14 at least tanks which fired HE you could just turn your hull 90 degrees pointing your side applique towards them and mitigate 90-100% of the HE damage. This made flanking MBT's easy if you knew which tanks fire HE and not AP. See an AFV?

334,"Copied my post from another discussion but changed/added bits and bobs here and there.

I bought it and Im sorta enjoying it. I have 36 under me with a okay WR, just under 3200 avg. damage per game. Overall feel of Merkava IIb for me has been good. I enjoy playing it though I still feel like its not a amazing carry vehicle. Acquired many Iron Stars already.

-The gun is great except the pen. It has good accuracy, aimtime, reload and overall gun handling. Downsides is the pen (and maybe the damage but its manageable). Personally I've actually been content with the penetration. It is only 381mm of pen (max 419mm), thats right. It is awful on paper and sorta in game. Right now my accuracy is 0.05, reload 6.3s, aimtime 1.88s and total DPM is 3886. With lvl 3 crew, CBL mk3 and intercom mk3.

-Mobility isnt great, though its better than the Challenger 1's for sure. Of course Chall 1 has armor to carry around but still. Merkava isnt the worst in mobility. Its no Leopard alright.

-Frontal armor is okay. It bounces tier 6's most of the time and some tier 7's. Shit side armor is bane of this tank. Its only 55mm thick. But I do agree the frontal armor at 542mm is unreliable to other t7's, sometimes they keep bouncing and sometimes they just pen every shell. Its steel and has no modiefiers agaisnt ATGM's, turret is still good for ATGM's because of the angles the ATGM is going to hit it. Overall I think the turret is a beast from the front. Not once I have been penetrated from the front when shooting at my turret, some cupola shots only. Merkava IIb is like a Leopard with even more punishing side armor. You angle it a bit and poof, they penetrate you.

-Weakspots which I found reliable from the front is only the LFP, I usually dont even bother aiming at the turret with a another Merkava IIb. Also take note that when looking at a Merkava aim on the right side of the LFP because for some reason its whole lot weaker than the left. If a Merkava is angling the sides are thin paper. Also the turret can be penetrated if its not facing you as the 152mm armor parts will be more visible to you.

So far the best case scenario at least for me has been defending a flank. Preferably a flank without many flanking routes open, Narrows 8-line or Lost Island north side. Easier to keep the front armor towards the enemies and using the turret. With the laser accuracy I can snipe the drivers hatch of a Chall 1 or the floor armor.
Though I dont mean this a defending tank. This can also push but you need to be careful where you drive. Hide your side armor, go hull down and try to only show the stronger part of your LFP to the enemies. With the accuracy and DPM you can eat your enemies alive as soon you can keep penetrating their weakspots. ",2016-05-05 05:57:47+00:00,d2thspq,1.0,t3_4hxycc,13028.0,ArmoredWarfare

413,"I havent really paid attetion  how the aim time works in here, even after ~1000 PVP games and 500 PVE games. But what I can tell you is that it isnt quite same as in WoT. I think the reticle starts to shrink right after you stop or slow down.

In my opinion accuracy is more important than aim time. I try to get my accuracy at least under 0,09 in MBT's. Usually its around 0,07-0,08 and I have found that enough. Sometimes I tend to stack it even more if I can without hindering myself in other aspects. For the fun of it, I've stacked in my T-80 a bunch of damage and left out the aim time out. Its around 2,8 seconds right now IIRC but I do a bunch of damage with HEAT and even with AP rounds and the accuracy (IIRC 0,08) is manageable with CBL mk.3, Exp. prop. mk.3 and some mobility retrofit.

Other thing which I have noticed while playing this game from the start is that your reticle stays relatively small when you move your turret even while moving forward with a slow-ish to medium-ish speed. The bloom effect in this game is really small when you dont turn your hull. This enables do peek corners much more easier because you can creep over the corner, stop for half a second, fire and go back because your reticle has stayed almost its max. accuracy.

tl;dr: Minimum accuracy over aim time in my opinion. Aim time is really manageable with most of the tanks. And with correct retrofits you get +% damage as an extra.",2016-03-26 07:35:18+00:00,d1dzm3e,1.0,t3_4c0bhg,2894.0,ArmoredWarfare

450,"I dont enjoy the style of grinding out new tanks in WT:GF. Yes you can skip a tank completely by not playing it. But this leaves you with the situation that 90% players drive in OP tanks. Why would anyone drive a piece of shit if they can play another tank to completely skip all crap ones and get another tank which is imbalanced like everything else in WT. Also by doing so youre leaving that one crew undertrained. Of course you could play the tank in which you do good with the other crew which isnt the basic crew for you tank but wheres the fun in that? Because once again you dont have to. 

In Wot I dont like the fact you have to first grind out the stuff out and THEN grind out the tank xp. This is where WT:GF and AW does it better. In both games you unlock stuff while also progressing your xp bar to next tank.

I'd rather have AW style of grinding because it takes the good stuff from both games and combines them.

Also I dont get it why you would say the first tanks would be bad. Theyre actually pretty good as the only tanks you cant reliably damage are MBT's at that tier(s). And MBT's at that tier are like bats. You dominate them with vision and flanking. And when you have to worry about the lighter tanks of your tier your guns actually do pretty reliable damage to them.",2016-03-11 06:35:14+00:00,d0vpu72,1.0,t3_49xede,2781.0,ArmoredWarfare

If youre not getting support in a crucial place, fuck that. Dont get yourself killed for nothing.

Also if playing a medium or a heavy or a TD with armor try to see if you can be aggresive and push to a even better location from the basic peek-a-boo area. This usually creates the situation where the enemies are in some odd positions and theyre easier to kill.

Shape doesnt matter usually so much except I want it to take the bigger mail easily inside and preferbably no sticking out screws or bolts in the back-inside wall. They tend to block the smooth entry.

Also sometimes I have to deliver some random items which are a bit larger than the opening. I'll see if I can push it through the hole without destroying it or if I can open the actual mailbox.

537,"[WARNING] Foul language!

I already quit playing regurarily after IS-5 CW. Although, I like the IS-5. 

But I mean fuck those imba tanks, same old generic meta, terrible playerbase and the feeling of doing usually 5-8x more work(=damage mostly) than 2/3 of your team. Also facerolls are boring af for both teams. No fun when your team stomps the opposing team even if you do 6k  damage. No fun losing when you see 3 minutes in to the game that your team already lost 4 of 6 top tier tanks.

Fuck the imba HEAT, russian-biased mediumtank play and overall pick medium and kill all meta, fuck power-creep, fuck arty doing 1,8k damage in one shot by xvm/clan focusing, and fuck that one kurwamacyolomadafakaIkillallunoobwhynohelp guy.

Though I still come to play this game for couple of rounds... Which is odd but I guess if I have spent my money I might as well have a kick out of it.

For some reason I enjoy AW much more right now even if it has more balance issues than WoT and more kinks to work out but atleast theyre doing something about it. WG can suck a bag of penises.

549,"AW is very similiar to WoT. First time I played this game I thought it was a carbon copy of WoT.

If you know the basics of WoT it shouldnt be problem to transfer over. 

New things to look out: ATGM, auto-cannons at higher tiers, ERA &amp; cage, APS, armor add-ons and how mobile MBT's (WoT heavies) are.

Every class is important as someone already mentioned the view range difference. You cant bloody see anything while driving a T-64. This is why you need AFV's/IFV's etc. This why support tanks such like Centauros or Terminators are great. They can punish any careless tanker very quickly. Then you need bumpers or pushers which are MBT's. Its the only class which has armor and a chance to block shots. Use your armor! All other classes are pretty much low armor and something else ie. gun/vision/camo/mobility. Though every tank has fairly good mobility compared to WoT's ""mobile"" mediums.

Now if I try to play WoT my biggest petpeeve is the lack of smokes. Couldnt have though how useful they can be.

Also, arty is pretty balanced in AW PVP.

592,"I just think MBT's in this game as WoT medium tanks with armor. Modern MBT's definitely aren't slow or sluggish, they're surprisingly fast and mobile. They might be a bit slow to accelerate but that's pretty much might be it. They have tremendous amount of torque to provide power to turn the hull quickly (of course it would also depend on which type of a surface they're turning their hull as it might increase the risk of losing a track or digging their own hole by moving a lot of dirt out of the way) and to my knowledge all or at least almost all modern MBT's have second gear when in reverse which allows them to go a lot faster in reverse.

Thus, in my opinion in AW there shouldn't be any drastic nerf at least considering MBT mobility. I'm fine with slight (like really small) adjustments here and there but overall I think right now mobility wise its pretty good.
