1,"Sorry to hear you didn't enjoy playing. We offered a survey to all teams and the majority of feedback we got back was very positive.

All matches were played across all divisions. I don't update Liquipedia because it takes forever, and I never intended to as Liquipedia is not our official standings or anything. All of this was available and linked to through the website (maybe more accessible to managers etc). I feel like criticizing the lack of information on Liquipedia is a pretty unfair way to talk about the league.

&gt; a match in the SC2I team league would regularly take double the amount of time compared to other leagues.

We run bo7 all kill, which might be a bit longer of a format than formats other leagues use, but it's the format that over 85% of 50 teams who responded to the survey preferred and it has been like that for multiple seasons.

There are rules in place &amp; admins available if a match is taking too long due to the other team delaying etc.

I agree the Second / Third Division could have been better -- that is something I was very open about from the first week or two of the league as it was due to admins dropping out, leaving me with three times as much work as I expected (and nowhere near enough time to do it all properly.) Just wanted to put my two cents in though.

Anyways, the tweets are more implied to the fact a lot of teams asked for another season, but are not signing up. It's a little concerning for our sponsors and for my own personal investment.",2016-11-15 02:39:06+00:00,da0qn4n,2.0,t1_da0q53z,682.0,starcraft

I mean outside of that, what more can we do? We tweet every time we are live and use Facebook regularly, for half the season we had a dedicated website which told a complete list of dates and times for upcoming matches as well.

9,"WHY???

I know it is off season, but you know what off season would be great for? Testing NEW maps that our map makers spend all year making for nobody to play on once because there are too few opportunities for them to be noticed or played by a large number of people.

Past this being a massive middle finger to map makers, why these maps? We have had Dusk Towers and Ulrena for SO LONG already this year, they are incredibly dull maps at this point. Daybreak and Echo are also late game / easy three base maps which promote similar play styles to Dusk Towers where split mapping is common. You can argue the same on Newkirk and Whirlwind. So we have 5 maps oriented for super late game play? Having Dusk Towers in the map pool earlier this year was dull enough.

Habitation Station is sorta cool. That's the only redeeming factor for me.

Seriously though, can't we just take some of the maps from TLMC and try them out for a while? Or have a larger map pool with more vetoes available..",2016-10-28 19:44:47+00:00,d9bvg9v,1.0,t3_59w9uu,2480.0,starcraft

15,"Hey!

I send out monthly replay packs to subscribers on the twitch channel / patrons on patreon. They get sent at the very end of a month (or a day or two later) and they include all the games I cast during the month which I'm allowed to release replays for (which is the majority of tournaments, but not all). I also re-send the pack in the middle of the month for any new subscribers (so one month of sub guarantees you two packs). The last one had 400+ replays in.

I also upload all of the best matches I cast to YouTube (www.youtube.com/WardiTV). So todays matches all of them will go on YouTube. The only issue is lately I have cast so much that the YouTube is ~2-3 weeks behind. I upload two videos per day there (sometimes 3) but I don't want to just spam say 10 videos in a day, hence why it is taking a little while to catch up.

Any other questions feel free to ask , &amp; enjoy :)

I don't blame Huk for denying me and other casters. It's in the rules he can do it and it makes sense for him to improve his chances at qualifying. 

The problem is the rules let him do this. DreamHack are reliant on community casting for their coverage of these qualifiers, challenger league etc. It wasn't like this for DH Tours, where they had ESL and DreamHack stream for some of the qualifiers / challenger league.

But if you are going to have one ""official"" English stream that can cover games, when there are 8 games happening initially, then at least 4+ at the same time for most of the evening, I just don't see the logic of allowing community casters but not respecting their time which they are using to help cover YOUR event.

It's stupid that I can cast a lot of games from EU Challenger league (I was even the main English stream of Challenger league the second day because of Basetrade having issues) and the other qualifiers, to then be told that because I'm not ""official"" players can deny me games and basically leave me sitting for a very long time without matches to cover.

I won't lie I did not apply to be an official caster for Montreal. This is because the last two times I asked about being a caster I was ignored / told to email somewhere which was then ignored. Usually I don't care, most of the time it doesn't effect me. But it's pretty shitty, to expect coverage of the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES to be brought by the COMMUNITY who you let players mess around.

I casted all of the EU Qualifiers &amp; Challenger league, but apparently I'm still just some random stream that DreamHack don't care enough about to allow me to continue streaming series when the players kick up a huff.

TL;DR:

* Players are allowed to kick non official streamers. There is only one official English stream.
* I am not an official streamer because I always seem to be ignored when I asked, so I did not ask this time.
* I got denied access to games despite covering most other qualifiers for this event as the secondary English stream, and the main English stream for the second day of Challenger league.
* I feel it's disrespectful to expect the community to provide coverage, and then not protect these streamers when they try to broadcast your content.

72,"&gt; The music / collar shirt thing might be opinion based, but it's something a lot of people agree on

Well the music is something the majority of people are positive about on my stream.

The collar shirt is just in my eyes completely ridiculous. I really cannot understand how me 'dressing up' to sit in my room - not a studio or whatever - improves your experience of the stream. It's just so out of sync with what the stream is. This is actually the first time in years I have heard people suggest this, and the times i have seen people casting in a similar situation to me with a more 'dressed up' outfit more people ask why they are wearing it, more than anything else.

&gt; and use them during the intro, winrate in matchup / maybe even check out the players match history and see if you can sniff out how they like to open on a map / in a matchup.

I appreciate the feedback, but this is already something I do a lot of. Especially in team league I am always crafting a story about players win rates, previous performances and builds, their teams standing and the importance of the match etc.

&gt; but wearing a nice dress shirt, and maybe even a casual tie, would go a long way (for me) for the stream not to appear as a minimum-effort kinda deal. It would really make a difference.

I suppose this goes back to what I said before, but I feel calling it a minimum-effort kind of deal is a bit offensive to the effort I do put it. Before a stream I'm always making sure I'm well presented - sorry that my general attire is a t-shirt and not a collared shirt - but in other types of presentation I really fail to see how it's ""minimum-effort"". The stream has well designed overlays, rotating pop-up images etc. It's all designed to look professional and more. Countdowns on breaks, map images &amp; win rate statistics coming up before games, updated match score and who has played between breaks.

Maybe you didn't mean it like this, but it's how it comes across. I know my stream isn't perfect - there are things that could be higher quality and I could fork out even more money to get even more graphics made and whatever. But for being a non-studio production I feel it is fairly high quality. Idk sorry I'm just trying to defend myself, I just feel as though you're comparing what I'm doing to something way above what I'm capable of achieving.",2016-03-18 01:17:46+00:00,d140e73,7.0,t1_d13zmgr,1299.0,starcraft

Honestly I can't say I agree about the music during breaks - one of the things people in chat are very positive about is that I play different music to usual. I play a wide variety of stuff and obviously some days there will be a few songs in a row people don't like, but generally the thoughts on this is positive.

I've looked at the pros and cons of this for ages. The pros basically cover : people who want me to get a co-caster are happy. I cast better? I don't actually think that is true. I cast worse with other people because I don't enjoy the dynamic as much.

Which happens and it's fine, I would just be sad if it came to this. After building the team league up so far it would be really sad to watch it drop down to the levels of Seasons 1-3 again.

I love the team league, it's the one really unique thing I have left on my stream that I cast on a regular basis. Obviously my stream isn't large enough to naturally attract a whole load of viewers every time it is live, and that's my own problem that I have to keep building up, but it is what is really hurting the team league in continuing as a tournament. With so much Starcraft content on lately it's very hard to take advantage of free time on the TL Calendar, which is what helped so much in season 4.

It's a bit of a vicious series of actions that's going to occur. The team league is a major reason I have content to stream every day --&gt; doesn't get enough viewers to get a new season --&gt; I don't have regular content anymore --&gt; My viewers decrease. This is what is likely going to happen and the next natural step from this is that I have to quit full time StarCraft 2 and probably SC2 events/streaming completely, because I don't think there is a way for me to have this in my life as a part time hobby anymore.

Not really complaining, obviously maybe I am a bit and a bit whiny/sad, but wouldn't you be if you are living your dream and passion, but know it's coming to an end? :D Probably shouldn't write this on reddit and will probably regret it but oh well.

On another note : everyone telling me to get a co-caster, I'm going to go write a blog post or something on why I solo-cast instead of having a co-caster on the stream. I get it - a lot of you want me to have a co-caster. But a lot of people enjoy my solo-casting and they enjoy my different approach to casting which involves a lot of chat interaction and so on. It isn't perfect and sometimes I screw up at it, but that's my style and it's what I enjoy. It makes no sense for me to stop doing something I enjoy for something I enjoy less and which makes me just another caster, instead of having my own style or prominent feature.

The most I can do for Basetrade is speak good about them and sometimes throw them a small host which is fairly insignificant on their viewership. This means they really get nothing in return when they host me, whereas if they host say Nathanias or any more popular streamer / player, they build and buffer connections.

They get way more return of investment hosting someone who has more influence in the scene. So do I ""Deserve"" the hosts? Not really. Time &amp; effort I put into SC2 doesn't mean people should host me. People should host me because they like the content I create and think it is worthwhile, which is true for a lot of streamers, but there are a lot of streamers who are making enjoyable content.

Time &amp; effort I would say is actually the lesser portion of being successful in this industry and is often bypassed by having strong connections.

It takes time to build up to 6 Liberators, it's also expensive and slows down Medivac production and imo it isn't worthwhile to build Liberators to counter 10-11 mutas. More than that sure, but then why is the Zerg massing one unit? The game isn't HotS anymore.

&gt; Bunny build is completely safe from any early attack and provided a great deal of map control and counter options - nobody (except terrans I guess) can seriously say it's fine if they've seen it in action

92,"&gt; ATG is being abused with the bunny build and several Korean zergs and I believe liquid snute have mentioned that this build is just too good - his comes out too early and is too difficult to deal with at little risk to the Terran

Investing into a Fusion Core and the Lib upgrade delays other tech from the Terran. It's also only viable on one or two maps. It can be stressful to deal with as a Zerg, but good scouting will make this easy to identify and react to.

&gt; the way that ATA completely eliminates Muta from the matchup is a big problem and a big reason why tvz has become Terran favored . Muta is needed to help clean up bio after the lings and blings all die. Corruptors are NOT a suitable replacement because they cannot do anything against ground units - unlike every other AA flier in the game - and are thus wasted supply. A very tiny amount of libs (5+) will make Mutas worthless because even if they die and even if Mutas are split your 20 health 20 Muta flock will get cleaned up instantly by any widow mine or marines left

We still see early Mutalisks, just not mass Mutalisks throughout the entire game, which afaik is what the Liberators were designed to stop. Now both players, Zerg and Terran, have to tech to higher parts of their tech tree in the later game.

Corruptors are much more tanky than Mutalisks and that means in larger fights they can be sniping Medivacs with very little risk to themselves. We even saw in HotS Dark playing with Corruptors over Mutalisks at times and this is slightly more common now in LotV. There is very rarely going to be a time you have Corruptors and they have nothing to fight vs Terran. If that is the case and they really are dead supply, it probably doesn't matter because it means your opponent has no Medivacs.

Of course in general we just see Roach Ravager Infestor compositions which use a Fungal / Corrosive combination to clean out Medivacs.

Mutas are only needed to clean up bio after ling/bling die when you are reliant on heavy Mutalisk counts in your composition, otherwise Ling-Bane-Ravager still does quite well and ofc you should be teching to Infestors or so behind it.

Maybe there are issues with the liberator, but I don't think the issues you listed are issues. The first is fixed by map makers knowing about this build and making their maps less friendly to liberators. The other issue I don't think is really true.

For your changes.

&gt; No longer one shots workers, no longer one shots hydras, does less damage against ravager, still Blows up heavy units.

If they don't one shot workers it's basically useless as a harass unit, because it means your opponent has to react very slowly for any damage to be done. Right now in high level games you will see a Liberator picking off a drone then repositioning due to corrosive biles etc.

Imo the Liberator in TvZ before the early game just adds a bit of variety with some different ways to open and harass, especially now Hellion/Hellbat based builds are a lot less common.",2016-01-21 13:15:33+00:00,cz6fxkt,1.0,t3_41zuye,858.0,starcraft

- Yep! Just the threat of the Warp Prism is a major part of PvT gameplay right now.

I had a lot of debate about how to put the build order into this and found it hard to fit into the original video, which is why I wrote it up on the website that's linked in the description and at the start of the video.

For future I will probably add some more pop-up text during the game for important features, such as the gas timings. It was just a bit overwhelming for the first video because I was still learning how to do a lot of stuff like that!
