The Leifeng Cup is a bi-weekly $2200 online tournament played on the Korean server. Broadcast every Monday, Tuesday &amp; Wednesday at 1pm CEST / 7am EDT / 8pm KST the first week features two qualifiers (Chinese and non-Chinese) on the Monday followed by Groups A and B on Tuesday &amp; Wednesday. The following week sees Groups C &amp; D on Monday / Tuesday and the double elimination playoffs on Wednesday.

Recently we have seen players such as Maru, sOs, ByuN, Reality, Solar &amp; more taking part, but with the end of proleague and GSL / SSL the line-up of the events is only getting stronger.

I've worked hard to build a relationship with the Leifeng Cup to bring you live action from inside the game, instead of having to rebroadcast the Chinese stream, so tune in today for the qualifier of Leifeng #155 which is absolutely stacked, to see what it's all about.

The build is a reactored liberator opening which skips the early-game hellions, a trend which is gaining some popularity since LotV.

It's a great way to switch up your TvZ while still finding a strong position in the mid-game which you should be comfortable and familiar with from other TvZ openings.

The full build order is written in detail on the write-up link, alongside some other written material to support the content in the video.
