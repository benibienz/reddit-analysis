141,"Well Trump has said ""If I’m elected I would be very strong in putting certain judges on the bench that maybe could change things.” When talking about marriage equity. 

He cant make up his mind on whether or not trans persons should have rights. 

As for some of the people he plans to appoint:

Ken Blackwell is a Senior Fellow at the Family Research Council (FRC), which was named a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also serves on the board of directors of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. In addition to supporting measures to ban marriage equality, he believes being LGBTQ is a choice, saying, “The reality is, again…that I think we make choices all the time. And I think you make good choices and bad choices in terms of lifestyle. Our expectation is that one’s genetic makeup might make one more inclined to be an arsonist or might make one more inclined to be a kleptomaniac. Do I think that they can be changed? Yes.”

Former Attorney General Ed Meese is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, an organization that asserts that laws protecting LGBTQ people are not “necessary” and “weaken the marriage culture and the freedom of citizens and their associations to affirm their religious or moral convictions…” According to NBC, the conservative Heritage Foundation is helping vet candidates for Trump’s Cabinet. Meese supported Indiana’s disastrous religious refusal law passed under Vice President-Elect Mike Pence, saying it “has nothing to do with refusing to serve gay people.” Meese has also said that marriage equality “shows how the culture has deteriorated over two centuries.”

Kay Cole James, president and founder of the Gloucester Institute, is a former senior vice president of the Family Research Council and a former director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. She worked in the administrations of both George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. The Advocate reported that in her book Transforming America from the Inside Out, James compared LGBTQ people to drug addicts, alcoholics, adulterers, or “anything else sinful.”

Here is a sample of Mike Pences' contributions to the LGBT community. 


In 2000, Pence argued that federal funding for HIV/AIDS treatments should be diverted to gay conversion “therapy” programs to turn gay people heterosexual.

In the 1990s, Pence’s conservative think tank published a bizarre screed against gays in the military that included graphic descriptions of made-up gay sex acts.

As a congressman, Pence supported a constitutional amendment that would’ve banned same-sex marriage across the country and called gay unions a “deterioration of marriage and family” and a sign of “societal collapse.”

Pence voted against the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” in 2010, saying that allowing gays to serve openly in the military was dangerous “social experimentation.”

Pence opposed a federal law that would prohibit anti-gay employment discrimination, calling it a “war on freedom and religion in the workplace.”

As Indiana governor, Pence signed a law designed to let businesses discriminate against LGBTQ customers, then lied about its purpose on national TV.

154,"From what I remember the baby went with the childs mother. 

The dealer was not only put away for being a dealer, but also for child neglect. Him being a heroin dealer is what lead to the police learning that his child was being neglected .

The problem with the 'drugs for all' crowd is that they often dont look past their own nose. What we have right now is not really working, but if everything was legalized it would collapse out already fragile healthcare as well as our economy. Alcohol alone costs the economy around $225 billion add in all these new addicts and it will tip over. 

Call me cold or callous, but I really dont care about the dealers or users I care about the people that get caught in the crossfire. The people like the children or the people that are robbed so a junkie can get his fix, or the people walking home from the store having to step over people shooting up. We are not winning the war on drugs, and I would argue that its only sort of working, but legalization will not work and even if it were tried it would take decades to implement, and treatment programs only work for people that care to get clean which a lot dont.  

There is no magic fix right now, and until there is I have no problem locking them up for the safety of others.",2016-11-11 02:08:10+00:00,d9v9ne2,5.0,t1_d9v8ol0,1332.0,ProtectAndServe

All my glasses go above behind glass (plastic) doors. I added an Ikea puck light to the underside of the top and it made a world of difference when it came to making drinks and just giving a little light to the room. The counter has the bottles we use most as well as a few decorative vessels. Left drawer has pourer spouts, measuring and stirring things and general nick nacks. Right drawer has cocktail books and towels. Top shelf has special glasses and premade mixes and flavorings, and bottom shelf holds the over flow for the decorative vessels as well as the bottles not used that often and bottles of club soda, coke, ginger beer, tonic, and sprite. 

Wine rack is also from overstock.com and was about $50 it holds 16 bottles, currently 14 slots are occupied. It has three slots to hold six glasses. I have four standard glasses and two fancy crystal glasses. there is a shelf above the glasses that has a bottle opener and foil cutter. 

I can not wait to move to a bigger house or apartment. Both my boyfriend and I are avid drinkers and are excited to expand on what we already have set up.

When I was an intern for them one of the employees that I worked with got hired because he spent the last three years building a network of contacts in every level of the hiring process. 

This guy would have made Russian spys proud, he knew names birthdays, kids, favorite foods the works on all these people. So when it came time and his application was in the pile. He went around to everyone he had gotten to know and brushed up with them till his application ended up on top of their piles. 

He also made sure that everyone in the office knew that any requests from the DC Superior Court Marshal were to be given to him so he would have a reason to get to know him. Reason this was so important is in the USMS you could get through everything but you still have to get chosen by a Marshal. 

So after he passed everything, he called up the DC Marshal and let him know that he was in the pile and he got a call the next day he had been selected.

The first time I was double parked and the sneaky bastard came up behind me in an unmarked and then told me I should have moved when I saw him before he lit me up. He finished writing the ticket as the person I was waiting on was getting into my car -_-

The second one was a little funnier. 

So when I bought my truck they sent my title to my apartment building but not my unit and since it was a registered letter it went back to the dealer and this slowed down the process of getting my hard plates put on. My 30 day tags had expired by about three days and I am sitting at a stop light when a motor officer rolls by in a bike lane. As he passes me he stops and walks back craning his head to look at my plate. Knowing full well that he was going to stop me, as soon as the light changed I turned and stopped and he rolled up behind me. He comes up to my window and and I explain what happened, he tells me that I can get another 30 day tag for free if the dealer made the mistake I thank him for the information and he asks for my ID to make sure there are no wants or warrants for me before I can leave. Out of habit I reach into my wallet and slip out my credit card and hand it over. He looks down at it and then back up at me and without breaking a smile he said ""I am not set up for electronic bribes just yet so lets stick with the ID."" I looked at him confused for a second before realizing that I had my credit card in my hand and not my ID. Then we both had a hardy chuckle about that and he told me he had been holding on to that one for awhile. ",2016-09-05 23:14:04+00:00,d7atk3x,1.0,t3_51c1df,2060.0,ProtectAndServe

Another event we would put on was a Call of Duty tournament where we would open the game with a 1V1 head to head match between a former FBI agent and police chief that were professors.

1148,"He deleted it, but this is what the post said. 

&gt;The other night I got pulled over for having a burnt-out tail light. Was it burnt out? Yes. Did I have any way of knowing that? No. It's not like the car fucking tells me when my tail light is burnt out.
So the fucking piece of shit cop tells me I've got a tail light out. Guess what? I carry a replacement bulb in my glove box for just such an occasion. Does this asshole pig let me replace the bulb right there? Nope, he writes me a fix-it ticket. Now I've got to go have the bulb ""inspected"" and pay a dismissal fee.
The fucking prick had the fucking audacity to tell me that it wasn't a big deal, because it's a ""correctable violation."" Yeah, correctable in the sense that I have to waste half my fucking work day and pay a ridiculous fee to ensure that a three dollar bulb was properly replaced. Frankly, that bullshit attitude that ""at least it's not going on your record"" pissed me off more than anything else.
I can't think of a single fucking thing that I would ever call the police for at this point. I keep a gun by my bed, and if someone broke into my house it's not like the cops would get there before I ever managed to shoot the bastard. Anything I called the cops for would just make things way worse. I'm a law abiding citizen—I've never so much as smoked a single puff of marijuana; hell, I don't even speed unless traffic is moving at substantially faster than the speed limit (and if you're sitting there smiling your smug cop grin as if you never speed yourself, then go fuck yourself and die you fucking turd). But you know what? The way people judge their police force is based on how they interact with them, and the primary way in which most citizens interact with the police is through traffic stops. And when you act like super-macho pieces of shit in traffic stops, you make us terrified of you and hate you.
Am I substantially worse off for having gotten this ticket? Not really. I'll deal with it, and at the worst it will be a minor inconvenience for me. Has it made me hate the fucking cops? You bet. From now on, any time a cop gets shot, you better believe I'll be rooting for the shooter. I hope every single one of you piece of shit pigs gets shot in the line of duty.
Is that rational? Maybe not. But if you're wondering why people hate you and mistrust you as much as they do, it's because of shit like this. Small shit. For you, it was an insignificant interaction. A burnt-out tail light, no big deal. For me, though, it was the most infuriating, unfair interaction with the police I am ever likely to have in my life. I don't know any of you, so I don't give a shit about you. In my heart of hearts, though, at this point I would be more than pleased to hear about the death of any one of you. Because as far as I am concerned, you are all that piece of shit cop that had nothing better to do than slightly inconvenience me for no fucking reason other than he was bored and felt like being a prick.

1203,"&gt; The other night I got pulled over for having a burnt-out tail light. Was it burnt out? Yes. Did I have any way of knowing that? No. It's not like the car fucking tells me when my tail light is burnt out.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So the fucking piece of shit cop tells me I've got a tail light out. Guess what? I carry a replacement bulb in my glove box for just such an occasion. Does this asshole pig let me replace the bulb right there? Nope, he writes me a fix-it ticket. Now I've got to go have the bulb ""inspected"" and pay a dismissal fee.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The fucking prick had the fucking audacity to tell me that it wasn't a big deal, because it's a ""correctable violation."" Yeah, correctable in the sense that I have to waste half my fucking work day and pay a ridiculous fee to ensure that a three dollar bulb was properly replaced. Frankly, that bullshit attitude that ""at least it's not going on your record"" pissed me off more than anything else.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I can't think of a single fucking thing that I would ever call the police for at this point. I keep a gun by my bed, and if someone broke into my house it's not like the cops would get there before I ever managed to shoot the bastard. Anything I called the cops for would just make things way worse. I'm a law abiding citizen—I've never so much as smoked a single puff of marijuana; hell, I don't even speed unless traffic is moving at substantially faster than the speed limit (and if you're sitting there smiling your smug cop grin as if you never speed yourself, then go fuck yourself and die you fucking turd). But you know what? The way people judge their police force is based on how they interact with them, and the primary way in which most citizens interact with the police is through traffic stops. And when you act like super-macho pieces of shit in traffic stops, you make us terrified of you and hate you.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Am I substantially worse off for having gotten this ticket? Not really. I'll deal with it, and at the worst it will be a minor inconvenience for me. Has it made me hate the fucking cops? You bet. From now on, any time a cop gets shot, you better believe I'll be rooting for the shooter. I hope every single one of you piece of shit pigs gets shot in the line of duty.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Is that rational? Maybe not. But if you're wondering why people hate you and mistrust you as much as they do, it's because of shit like this. Small shit. For you, it was an insignificant interaction. A burnt-out tail light, no big deal. For me, though, it was the most infuriating, unfair interaction with the police I am ever likely to have in my life. I don't know any of you, so I don't give a shit about you. In my heart of hearts, though, at this point I would be more than pleased to hear about the death of any one of you. Because as far as I am concerned, you are all that piece of shit cop that had nothing better to do than slightly inconvenience me for no fucking reason other than he was bored and felt like being a prick.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Have a nice day. Stay safe out there.

We provided law enforcement services to two apartment complexes where we would deal with low level misdemeanors. One day my shit head of a partner decided to fuck with a resident (the kid was a complete waste of oxygen, but at that exact moment had not been doing anything) 

So he gets into an argument with this guy and all his friends, about six of them, I come to try and defuse it and get a foot in the balls for my trouble. So at this point someone is going to jail, but then my window licker of a partner sprays OC directly in my face trying to hit the other guys. Then, while I am throwing haymakers, this fuck boy runs away leaving me with about six gang bangers. I get knocked down and I roll over on my gun because I cant see to shoot anyone anyway. I am able to get my baton out and I start cracking the shit out everything I can with it. As I try to get up I get hit in the head with a beer bottle and it breaks, knocking me back down. Dazed I try to get up again and get some help from a different resident who had chased off the bangers. He helped me to the pool house where I stood in the shower and washed off the oc and called the police.

While I agree and it looks like he has limited training in drawing from this set up, all the shooters they showed ""drawling faster"" were drawling from external holsters ""concealed"" from open shirts.

As a general rule I would agree, but in this case when the decision was made to engage it makes perfect sense for him to close the gap in a crowded market to engage the shooter when his face is down in the register. Of course he should have pulled the trigger a few more time.

1670,"One guy refused to go back inside and while we were dealing with him one of his roommates kids told us that he is a creeper and asked if we could leave him outside. So we decided to arrest him for drunk in public for everyone's benefit. We do a fake field sobriety test and have him turn around bend down and put his hands out to the side. Then we tell him to raise one foot of the ground and touch the back of his hands together behind his back. At this point we were looking good, but my partners stupid nylon cuff case had velcro and as soon as he opened it the guy spun around saw what was happening and spun back around and took off running saying we werent taking him in. Well his boozy brain got all sloshed around and as soon as he takes off running he trips and bounces off a truck landing on his face about ten feet away. So we walk over and cuff him up and take him in, as funny as it was to watch it made us have to do a seperate form. 

One guy, more sad than funny, we found in the playground at 4 in the afternoon drinking vodka out of the bottle. We asked him where he lived and he said a town an hour away so we hooked him up and searched him. He had a book bag and everything inside was sorted in County Jail property bags. We asked when he got out and it was earlier that day. When we got to booking the Deputies greeted him by name and welcomed to his ""home away from home""

One time four of us were doing a shift change debrief on the corner of the parking lot so we could keep an eye on everything. A guy stumbles down the sidewalk about ten feet from us passes a parked Honda and just straight kicks the side view mirror off. Then he acted like he didnt do it all the way to the jail. 

One guy was puking all over himself then took his shirt off and while he was talking to us forgot that he had puked all over it and started throwing it over his shoulder. It made a wet slap when it hit his back. The worst part was my partner was heaving everytime so I had to try and fight back full on laughing while figuring out what to do. 

My partner got his boot pissed on on acident once by a guy who we went to talk to because he was in the middle of the parking lot peeing. When I say middle I dont mean by a car I mean in the middle of a drive lane in a round about. We walk up and say 'sir' and he whips around really fast. I was able to avoid it, but he pissed all over my partners boot.

2176,"One of my professors was a family friend and honestly they reason I went to college. He was an FBI agent and had a hell of a career. Started in Miami in the 80's as part of an under cover narcotics team, then moved to HRT, then he moved to Dayton Ohio and headed a very successful bank robbery task force, so successful that there were not enough bank robberies to justify his task force. So he thought about retiring, but then 9/11 happened and he went for another eight years on the JTTF.

One day in class the subject of deadly force came up and someone asked if he had ever killed someone. He told us about a story when he was on HTR where they were providing cover for a DEA sting. He was on the roof of a building inside a refrigerator box with a rifle when they got word that the bust went bad. He saw the DEA agent running from the building as the FBI swarmed in, but behind the agent was the suspects in a car and it was clear that they were trying to run down the agent. So my professor said that he lined up the shot, as they were coming toward him, and shot twice. The first cracked the glass and the second went through the drivers throat. The car swerved and hit a loading dock and the DEA agent was able to get away unharmed. 

When asked if it bothered him he said this, and I will always remember it.  ""If taking a life doent bother you then there is something wrong, but the way I looked at only one of them was going home to his family that night and I was going to make damn sure it was the guy on the right side of the law.""

He probably would have gotten more cooperation if the officer called off the dog once he was on top of the suspect instead of letting it drag him around the road for two minutes, then again maybe the suspect would have started fighting. Hell, why did he release the dog at all, the guy was not running and he was obeying commands, just slowly. Also I heard him threaten a taser at one point, why was that not used? Then after he finally gets the dog off the guy he cant even cuff him becasue the dog still wants to rip his throat out so he had to wait till backup arrived anyway.

2557,"&gt; Suppose I did that to some random stranger? I certainly would be going to jail for that. You say the person can leave, but more often than not the person happens to already be where they want to be. Would it make sense if I started peppering a random Walmart customer with questions, and when told to leave them alone to say if they don't to be bothered they can leave? Absolutely not. Only even this is a more trivial aspect of the issue.

Walmart is a poor example since its private property, but if you were in a park, no you would not get arrested that is absurd. You would walk away and if they followed you then it becomes an issue.

&gt;As I said, actually getting a ""no"" to the question ""am I being detained"" is exceedingly rare. The law, and case law is highly confusing to most people. If you have reasonable suspicion you are under no obligation to articulate that reason to me. Hence, how sure can the average person be that they aren't resisting if they attempt to walk away? They can't, and many have gone to jail and even been convicted after the officer offers justification to the court the defendant had no knowledge of or involvement with. Especially when everything the officer is saying tacitly implies some justification exist, while avoiding the direct question.

Once again, where are you getting your numbers from? But lets say that you keep asking and they keep avoiding, then walk away if they tell you to stop then you are not free to go. You cant be resisting if you are not under arrest, a detention is not the same as an arrest. If you go to leave and they say ""hey come back"" and you dont, then you will be in trouble. 

&gt;How many videos do I need to link showing officers explicitly answering the ""am I being detained"" question with ""you will be if you don't show me an ID,"" even in states without a stop and ID law. Even Texas where providing ID is not even required for a detention, only upon arrest. So what you are really saying, for anybody with any gaps in their understanding of the law, is you can leave if you want, but maybe there is a reason why you can lock them up and get a conviction if they try.

Well you have not linked any.

&gt;Even when people fail to get an answer, and assume they can walk away and try, the immediate response essentially tends to be wait, we're not done here, or some variant thereof. Thus implying they have no such authority to leave.

Again, where are you getting this? However if they say come back, then you can assume you are being detained. 

&gt;There is another catch-22 that is often purveyed among law enforcement spokespeople. The opinion that people should just allow their rights to be violated and file a complaint after the fact. The problem is that compliance alone is consent, and consent is an absolute defense against a violation of rights. Hence the effects of following such advice essentially robs people of their rights. Of course there are ways around it, but very few people have the legal understanding and/or language skills to pull it off. So the opinion is in essence screw your rights.

No, wrong again. Compliance does not anywhere mean consent.

""Open your bag.""

""I dont want to""

""Do it anyway""

If you open your bag in this scenario and they had no legal reason to ask you to do that then it would be an illegal search.  This is a custodial interaction, no longer a consensual one. 

&gt;So, if the officer will not respond to the question of whether they are detaining you or not, consistently implies they have reason to detain you, and has a legally justifiable reason you have no knowledge of, is it still a good idea to just walk away? If you try the chances that you will not not charged with resisting with violence when they tackle you and you attempt to break your own fall is slim to none. You now just another felon. So yeah, that's REAL smart advice. Are you starting to get the picture about why people are acting out. Even those that clearly and unlawfully run or violently fight back quiet often do so because they don't comprehend how they can be any better off not doing so. Even someone who studies like hell to get it right more often than not screws up at some point or another and and lands a conviction. Following your advice to just walk away is one of many of those methods to get themselves convicted.

I really wish that I would have read this first and saved myself the time of going through all this, because this is crazy. You think that if you start to walk away after not getting an answer the go to response is to tackle you? Just boom tackled. 

I will sum this up for you and then I am done. If an officer is talking to you and you dont want to talk to him you can walk away from him. If he tells you to come back then you are detained. If an officer is talking to you and you cant tell if you are detained or not then say ""I am done talking and am going to leave now."" If they say you cant, then you are detained. You really dont need a juris doctorate to sort this out. ",2016-05-22 12:12:03+00:00,d3f3u08,17.0,t1_d3f2g18,5182.0,ProtectAndServe
2558,"What I meant by the statement that you quoted was that you seem to think that a person saying they dont want to talk means that the police can no longer talk to them and has to leave them alone. Saying ""no thanks I don't consent to the questions or the contact"" is not some magic phrase that means police have to leave you alone. As you have said this is a public place, the police can talk to anyone they want and if that person is not detained and does not like the questioning then they can leave.

All you have to do is ask, if they dont say yes then you are not detained and are free to leave, and if you stay then thats your choice.   

Also I would be interested in finding your statistics about this.

&gt;First the odds of getting a straight up answer when someone asks straight up ""Am I being detained?"" is less than 10%. 

But lets say you cant get a straight answer, then you can just walk away and if they stop you then you are detained and if they dont then you are good.

2918,"Lets just say that you cant reload quickly, do you think that standard capacity magazines are just going to not exist anymore?

You give a good example, but not one that happens often. Usually shooters kill themselves, are killed by the police or surrender.  

Defensive shootings are just that defensive shootings. It doesn't matter if you are police or a civilian if you are drawing you pistol to shoot more often than not the circumstances are very similar (shootings in a home not withstanding) I.E. one on one and very fast with near or complete magazine dumps. 

Like I said, there is not force field that keeps residence of New York from driving to Pennsylvania and buying a standard capacity magazine.  

[Of the first ten listed here 9 were in gun free zones](http://timelines.latimes.com/deadliest-shooting-rampages/) and the other one was just random locations around the town but was in California of which the whole state is basically a gun free zone.

&gt;it means people would get more chances to stop the guy.

2919,"[Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAFxgQmxbGI) any shooter can strip and replace a magazine in no time, and if the shooter cant then they will just carry two magazines. Regardless of that most shootings happen where no one can legally carry so there is really no reason to worry about the lag in shooting.

The NYPD reported that the average hit rate during gunfights was just 18 percent. When suspects did not return fire, police officers hit their targets 30 percent of the time. So the standard magazine for a Glock 17 is 17 rounds which is over double the allowable limit for a civilian in New York. A larger magazine means you can stay in a fight longer, and have a better chance of landing a hit. Shooting paper or cans is different than shooting in defense of your life.

Seriously the most stand up cop I have ever worked with, he always treated us security with respect and when we needed help he would be the first there. If we fucked up, he would back us in the open then pull us aside and tell us what we did wrong and how to fix it next time. Hell sometimes he would just come shoot the shit with us in between calls. He always towed the line of what was legal and ethical but **never** crossed it.  

I remember one time when the gang bangers were all ganging around doing gang shit, we were way out of our element and called it in. He showed up and started giving them the what fore and a couple other police showed up and were like ""dude this isn't even your district anymore"" and he said in a thick slavic accent, ""these are my people I come when they call.""

So focus on the symptom not the problem, THAT IS THE FUCKING PROBLEM. You focus on the guns becasue they are easy and the only thing you will do is hurt honest people when the violence doesn't stop and they have no way to protect themselves.

Everyone wants to point at violence and say that its the guns fault, while completely ignoring all the other issues and factors.

3402,"&gt;No guns till 21 is that what you're suggesting?

Already cant buy handguns until you are 21. I would be fine with 21 across the board, or just like with alcohol your parents could give it to you whenever they want.

&gt;Up to 40% tax on purchases.

Not sure where you got that number from.


&gt;Enormous government spending on education 

That would be fine with me. 

&gt;and roadside testing for responsible gun usage.

Not sure how that would work since carrying a gun does not effect your ability to drive a car. 


&gt;Control on the quality and amount of guns sold.

Lot of states already do this by putting limits on how many guns can be sold in a month, or how quickly you can buy and take home a gun. 


&gt;No sale of home made guns or ammo.

Cant sell homemade guns, and I dont really care about the ammo. 

&gt;Drinking yourself to death takes ages, it's not a spur of the moment act of extreme emotion so it's more akin to a disease than a weapon.

Edit: I had this response all typed up, but the comment got deleted so I will just add it here. 

&gt;The first person said that gun deaths dont rate close to automobile deaths, you pointed out that could be a false equivocal because for most people cars are more useful than guns. So I brought up alcohol as a similar point of comparison. Alcohol has no real purpose other than pleasure and kills far more people each year than guns, but no one seems to care about that. If someone goes into a mall and shoots four people its national news, but if a drunk driver kills a family of four it wont even make more than local news. All people care about is what outrage garners them the most, and trying to put and end to other peoples hobbies if they disagree with them.

Ok, I don't know how much you know about American city structure so I am going to assume that you know nothing.

In this country we have cities, villages, townships, counties, and hamlets. Each of these can be incorporated that means that they can form their own laws and level their own taxes. There are also force protection departments, like Pentagon Police, FBI Police, Federal Reserve Bank Police and so on, these departments get their authority a different way, usually through Congress. 

Now for the community police their jurisdiction is dependent on their charter size. 

Here is a break down from Wikipedia:

City –The population of a city is over 100,000 people up to 300,000.


Large town – a large town has a population of 20,000 to 100,000.


Town – a town has a population of 1,000 to 20,000.


Village – A village has a population of 100 to 1,000.


Hamlet – a hamlet has a tiny population (&lt;100) and very few (if any) services, and few buildings.  

These are the incorporated areas, the unincorporated areas are generally townships and counties. Counties have Sheriffs as their top law enforcement official instead of a Chief or Commissioner. Also unlike police a Sheriff is elected not hired, and can not be fired until their term is up. The position of Sheriff is in charge of the jail but also can patrol the streets. (In America people go to jail while they are waiting on a trial or if they have been charged of a crime resulting in up to one year of incarceration. Other wise you go to prison.) 

Ok so now we have the basics, lets move on to police powers. Lets use my old home town as an example. The Village of Bellbrook has a police department and is within the Township of Sugarcreek in the County of Greene in the state of Ohio. As jurisdiction goes, work backward. Ohio Highway Patrol can police anywhere in the state (including off highways) Greene county Sheriffs Deputies can police anywhere inside Greene County and so on you get the idea. This does not work the other direction, a Bellbrook police officer can not go to the opposite side of the county and write a traffic ticket in Centerville. 

The size of these are based off ancient texts lol, for instance the city of Washington DC is ten square miles and employs about 4,000 officers where as San Bernardino Sheriffs office covers an area of over 20,000 square miles and has 2000 deputies. It really just depends on how their charters were written when they were written back when the cities were formed. 

I hope this helps and didnt just make it more confusing lol.  ",2015-12-18 06:56:41+00:00,cy3674h,5.0,t1_cy24017,70604.0,ProtectAndServe

4626,"&gt;Denver, CO - A man who lied about his medical condition to get his license has been sentenced after he crashed into a bicycle officer in Denver.

&gt;Moments before the crash surveillance video shows officer John Adsit and other Denver Police officers riding their bikes during a protest on Colfax Avenue last December. Then, another surveillance camera shows a black Mercedes coming out of nowhere and plowing into four officers, dragging officer John Adsit under the car.

&gt;“It was a medical condition,” said Giancarlo Small, the defendant’s attorney. “He had a seizure and that’s how we ended up here today.” Defense attorneys said in court Christopher Booker hadn’t been diagnosed before the accident and didn’t know the seizure risks.

&gt;It came out in court, though, he’d had eleven seizures in ten years and lied about his medical history when applying for his driver’s license, even after the accident. A judge sentenced Booker to six years of community corrections. It’s not the probation he wanted, nor is it the prison sentence the districtattorney wanted either.

&gt;“Every single doctor said that they advised him not to be driving,” said District Attorney Doug Jackson. Now, he’s concerned, even though Booker said he has no plans to drive. A doctor’s note discussed in court says under new medication Booker could drive again.

&gt;Officer Adsit has had 16 surgeries and doesn’t know if he’ll ever be able to be a police officer again.

It started life as a lime spreader, then was turned into a car carrier for a junk yard before landing in that junk yard after they upgraded in the early 80's.

My Dad bought it almost immediately for $100. He put a a four post flat bed on it and used it for hauling grain. When he would get to the grain elevator he would drive up in these straps and they would tip the entire truck up to dump the back, it was quite a spectacle. Once the elevator decided that the liability of tipping a farmers truck to a 45 degree angle with little holding onto it was not something they wanted, they stopped doing it. To keep with the time my Dad installed a dump bed. That remained there for only a short time until he bought his dump truck ( a picture for a different post) Then he ghosted up a fifth wheel, but with no granny gears he never went through with the installation and soon bought a Diamond Reo. Then the truck sat for about a decade before the old man decided to breath new life into it. His new plan is to take the body and put it on an old camper motor, trans, and frame to make a roll back. 

As it sits now, the truck is all original. The reason it sat so long is the four speed transmission went bad, but for years this was my Dads only farm truck so it got lots of use. Everything functions on it, and apart from a crack in the windscreen, a dent in the roof, and the rear glass being broken its in pretty good shape.

5343,"Of the the over 300 million guns less than 100 thousand were used during the commission of a crime. While defensive uses of guns is between 50,000 and a million (since solid records on these things are not kept there is a lot of speculation.) 

You can look at the statistics all day and make them work for both our arguments. The fact is, that bell can't be unrung. No matter how you want to look at our ""*stupid*"" second amendment, its there. Besides that New Zealand and Australia are island countries, the US is not. 

We don't have a gun problem, we have a violence and worth of life problem. Guns do play a large part, but alcohol kills far more people each year in far more creative ways than guns do and just becasue some guy down the street cant handle his drink should not equate to me not being able to. 

I am an avid shooter, and have owned multiple guns for over a decade and have been carrying one for five years. Never once have I or my guns killed anyone and this is the case most of the 11 million people that have a permit. 

I am open to a discussion on ways to curb 'gun' violence, but removing guns completely is not the answer. Nor are arbitrary restrictions on accessories. Trying to solve this violence by flat removing guns is like trying to stop a person from bleeding by removing their blood. ",2015-10-09 09:55:20+00:00,cvtjbbb,10.0,t1_cvtiwqs,1868.0,offbeat

5345,"I love it. 

I used to carry a Glock 22, but when I switch jobs I wanted a 9MM, and this was the only one I had. At first the weight was annoying and I am still not that fond of hammers, but now I really like it. 

Except for the first round I can hammer tacks with it and last time I practiced I put 250 or 300 rounds through before my first malfunction. 

I have fancy Smith and Wesson Hogue grips which fill out my hand well but sink the magazine release a little and that's a bit of a problem. I read that S&amp;W made a Pro Shop version with extended magazine releases, but I have not been able to locate one. The slide stop is really far forward so the only way to easily drop the slide is to grab it, but the ambi safety/decocker makes a fantastic charging handle. 

The biggest drawback is it's an anchor. Fully loaded with the flashlight it's close to three pounds, and it's the ""light weight"" version. 

I bought the gun to help out a friend from an old job and now it's one of my favorite work horses in my collection. The holster patina and scratches on the grips give it great character, and the stainless and aluminum body has the unexpected perk of making it really easy to tell when it's clean.

Copening, who was an 11th-grader at Douglas Byrd High School at the time, is not believed to have had any involvement in the alleged rape, Sheriff's Office Attorney Ronnie Mitchell said.

The charges filed were four counts of making and possessing images of himself and one count of possessing a naked image of his 16-year-old girlfriend.

Age of consent is 16, both the boy that took the picture and his girlfriend were over that. So in theory he could go have sex with every pedophile in the state, and its not a crime until there is a picture of it. Besides that there is no intent, he is not ""distributing child porn"" he had a picture of himself, and that is completely relevant.

This is taking 'letter of the law' to absurd heights. These laws were made to protect children, which has clearly failed in spectacular fashion here

Of course it will be expensive to get the big battery as well as the mega charger, and you would have to have an entire second fleet to use while the first was charging since even at its fastest of 4.5 hours it's still much longer than the standard ten minute gas top off.

I would also ditch the dual cuff pouch and spread them to opposite sides of the belt. The reason being that you want to make sure that no matter how you may be positioned you can can reach at least one set of cuffs. If room is an issue you can attach your cuffs with a belt keeper to reduce their space consumption on your belt. 

Personally I am not a fan of anything too close behind my gun as it can interfere with making a fast grip, but that is nothing a couple belt keepers as spacers wont fix. 

Good spot for your OC, that is where most will recommend it to be. However if that is your only intermediate weapon choice, I would recommend putting it weak side so a transition to your pistol can be done quick and seamless.  

Great choice of firearm holster, they are expensive, but the best on the market.

The one thing that did seem to be agreed upon was that if it was to be a factor in future mental health issues it was becasue of chronic use of high potency strains at a young age. When using marijuana medically to treat cancer it is possible that a user would be young and could suffer mental health issues down the road, but considering the alternative I think that its a calculated risk.

1) This one has people on both sides of the argument. For one most people that are going to be honest, recognize that there is still a drug problem in DC and chronic drug users in an area often lead to other crimes. Other people see laws as unimportant and that the focus should be on rehabilitation and treatment. Also MPD is highly into visability, so having an entire squad that no one sees is viewed as counter to the mission. 

2) No one cares about pot. Not having to make arrests for that is fantastic, and saves time and resources. Ask pretty much any cop and they will tell you that their view on marijuana is just about the same as that on alcohol; hate the 'scene' becasue it leads to problems, and hate people that use then drive, other than that don't give a shit.

3) Nearly every officer is for cameras, **AFTER** detailed policies are in place. When you are a police if its not in the policy you can get into trouble over it. That is what the union is concerned about. The higher ups are more worried about cost, storage, and privacy concerns.

4) Working is fantastic, but no one will do it for free. Also MPD is breaking contractual agreements, which is also a point of concern.

6492,"&gt; Routine use of no-knocks for non violent crime(and more specifically, drug charges of dubious merit).

These are used far less often than people think they are. The reason that a warrant would specify the need for an unannounced entry is the concern that evidence will be destroyed or they received intelligence that the party's involved would be armed or otherwise dangerous. 

&gt;The fact that ""resisting arrest"" is a legitimate charge to keep/prosecute even if turned out that the reason for the original arrest was complete bullshit.

The reason for this is to dissuade people from fighting police in the street. If you think you were arrested illegally then the court is the place to fight it. Every one of the last few high profile unjustified police shootings happened because the officer made a grievous error in judgement when the subject they were dealing with decided to fight it out on the side of the street. 

&gt;Civil Forfeiture as a routine way to pad out budgets.

The thing about civil forfeiture is that your property can be seized if it was purchased through funds acquired from illegal means. If you can prove that you property was purchased with clean money then it will be returned.  

&gt;Various traffic citations used as a way to pad out budgets. Hell, a while back when Virginia went full retard on speeding laws the VSP bragged about how many more patrol vehicles it was going to get them. 

I can't speak to that, as I never heard about it and I live in Virginia, but it could have been a scare tactic to try to keep people from speeding in the first place. The issue here is that the majority of money from tickets does not go to the department that issued it. It really depends on your state, but the largest portion of the fee generally goes to the court, then the education and road funds, and the state gets a cut. By the time all that is done police departments get very little of each infraction.

When was the last time an officer murdered someone in cold blood? I can thing of a handful of times that an officer made a grievous error in judgement, but not a cold blooded murder. 

&gt;but the bad ones get protected, and that's the problem. That's why people don't trust the police. They don't trust that when a bad cop abuses his or her power, that anything will happen.

Were is your source on this bullshit? Bad cops are fired everyday, but since it doesn't fit into your sensationalized media driven narrative (which according to you is not problem) it is not blasted on national news.

Ignorance of the law is not an excuse for breaking it. If you can't be bothered to learn applicable laws then you can not be upset when you get in trouble for breaking one  
 

&gt;We actually do not know this. Both the police &amp; parking enforcement are capable of issuing parking tickets.

I will concede this as a possibility, except in my area the tickets from police are different than the ones from parking enforcement.  

&gt; Says who? It's not a civil matter.
 
Since parking tickets do not go on any kind of an official record and the punishment for breaking them is civil. The government fines you money, you pay it, thats the end
&gt; 
&gt;     A criminal charge is a formal accusation made by a governmental authority asserting that somebody has committed a crime
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A Crime is defined as an unlawful act. It's pretty cut &amp; dry.

7222,"&gt;Guns should be registered, each gun should be able to be run and brought back to a legal owner.

I would not be ok with this for a number of reasons.

&gt;A gov. official should be able to demand your ID if you have that gun in your possession; if not you forfeit your privilege to continue to carry that gun, (ie take a ride in the wagon). 

Unless I am under investigation for a crime absolutely not.

&gt;You need to go to a legal distributor or gov. building (capable of doing/enforcing it) to buy/sell/trade guns; and all of that should be on paperwork somewhere. Each gun must be kept on gov. record with an up to date owner.

Fine with that, except for the registering thing again.  

&gt;Ammo can be sold in other stores, but all ammo purchases must require the buyer to ID themselves and present their permit. 

Ok, other than the need for a permit to *own* a gun. 

&gt;Cons, especially felons, should not be able to purchase or own firearms. If you are locked up and convicted after you legally own firearms, your guns should be seized and you lose your privilege to get them back. You can get go to a court and argue your case to why you should have them back and a board should clear you if they deem fit, but not until you are done serving your sentence, (if you're released early, it's when you're free).

Felons, yeah no, but if I am arrested for a non violent misdemeanor why should I have one of my rights suppressed? 

&gt;When you are going to get a gun permit, you should have several personal references and legitimate reasons to own it. Hunting &amp; recreational are valid reasons, just because is not. Several people should review your application and give their approval or disapproval, majority vote decides whether or not you get the permit. 

Oh god no. Nooooooo no no no. NO. I own 11 guns and only three of them I bought for a specific reason. The other 8 I bought becasue I, wanted a revolver, wanted a .45, wanted James Bonds gun, was given to me, wanted the full size, it was cheap and kind of looked cool, a freind needed money and was too proud to take a loan, or wanted an AR platform. And who are these people that are going to review my application and determine if my *need* is strong enough, because that shit is not working out in DC. 

&gt;You should have to go through a gun safety course once you get your permit before you can buy guns or ammo.

About the only point I agree on.

&gt;If driving is a privilege and not a right, owning and using a gun should be a privilege as well.

If it weren't for that pesky Constitution of ours saying that owning a gun is not a privilege but a **right**",2015-07-04 06:10:46+00:00,csrqxyn,2.0,t1_csrok5z,6885.0,ProtectAndServe

7224,"I live in Virginia, within (depending on traffic) 15 minutes from Maryland and DC. Virginia has Constitutional open carry and a concealed carry permit. We also have significantly less gun crime than our neighbors who have supposedly strict gun laws. ""Well Warneral the reason there is so much gun crime in Maryland and DC is because all of the guns being funneled in from Virgina!"" Perhaps, but then why is our gun crime stat so low? Because only the bad guys have guns there, here that thug is not sure if the little old lady is carrying or not. 

The bell can not be unrung, guns can not be uninvented and no matter how you choose to interpenetrate the Second Amendment, it allows for at least access to guns.

I have carried where I can for the last five years and never once felt like I was about to draw (outside of work). I carry a gun with more than ten rounds in the magazine, I own an AR and I have a 50 round Beta mag and a decent amount of incendiary and armor piercing rounds for it. My AR has a pistol grip, a folding stock, and a flash suppressor. On top of those two guns I own nine more. 

Not once have I, nor my guns killed any police or babies. 

Which brings me to my point. Politicians need to stop pandering to the generally stupid population when it comes to guns by banning or restricting accessories that have nothing to do with a guns lethality and instead focus on the real issues; mental health and criminal accessibility. Every one of the last mass shootings the shooter should never have had access to a firearm, be it because of age or clear mental illness. However its soo much harder to point the finger at mental illness because that would cost money to rectify, where banning or restricting things is a perfect knee jerk reaction to sooth the masses. 

You could put an RPG-7 in my hands and it would be less lethal than a single shot .22 in the hands of a criminal. 

Guns are the great equalizer, they are made to kill, in the hands of the right person they are a tool for self preservation and in the hands of the wrong person they are a tool of destruction. 

I love nearly every aspect of Virginia gun law, the one thing I will concede is that private party sales are a recipe for problems. A gun is my property, so I should be allowed to sell it, but I think that the buyer needs to go through the same process as if I were at a gun store. Also with Virginia not being a stop and identify state nor having any restrictions on open carry I have heard of a couple of felons that used to open carry.

I work for a private housing authority. Two of our site locations are the two most saturated apartments for MS13 in the most saturated area of the east coast. 

I keep busy. 

The outfit I work for bills itself as one that will **eliminate** problems on your property, we are very good at it too. I work in a state that gives private security contractors a lot of authority and my company likes us to use it. 

For instance, in my state I can arrest for any crime committed in my presence. If I do, I am responsible for transportation to the jail, and booking in front of the magistrate, then I appear at court and testify as the arresting officer. 

We deal with petty shit like loitering, drunk in public, noise, and trespassing. This frees the police up to deal with more important stuffs. 

We have a good relationship with the county police and share information pretty freely with patrol guys and the gang task force. 

I have been passively trying, but honestly I don't really want to stay in this state and looking out of state is challenging.
