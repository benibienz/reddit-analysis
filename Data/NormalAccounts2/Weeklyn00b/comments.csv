Nemesis: Pudge, 34%. kinda surprised tbh. I know that he is fucking annoying and that he is probably one of the strongest roamers in the game, but I don't feel like he's that good. Kind of feel like nobody stuns pudge when he ults people, though..

Punching bag: Nature's Prophet. Didn't expect this one either, but I suppose it makes sense. I know the hero very well, so I know how to win against him. Just get a good early advantage and he is useless. It of course also helps that they're all afk jungling for midas and treads for 15 minutes, instead of going phase drums to get an advantage to win.

Comrade: Shadow Demon, 80%! Not really surprised by this, considering how great the hero is, and how much me and my friends have abused dispruption illusions with heroes like luna and drow. Also works really well with NP, which secures the gold and map control lead early game, to get a smooth transition to push rax after a few stat items for my agi carry. I also got 64% winrate with dazzle, probably because he is all around a good hero, that is more or less never a bad pick.

My [last thread, with fanart of NP becoming a volvo car](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/54ex9o/since_humanity_first_stepped_foot_in_europe_there/) got brutally removed from the dota 2 subreddit, mere hours after it's birth. The same thing happened to [my previous masterpiece](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/54cqbq/minimalistic_io_i_painted/). At first I thought this was a mistake, but after [kindly asking the mods to make the thread visible again](http://image.prntscr.com/image/85c8e01f18db44b98f92d645cb3f8845.png) and waiting for hours, I realized that my mistake clearly got ignored. 

Meanwhile, I see none of Drakus' posts being removed, the [dota 2 heroes as lukewarm bowls of water](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4eldse/dota_2_heroes_as_lukewarm_bowls_of_water/) is still there after 5 months (my #1 inspiration by the way), and I see no threads addressing this issue.

775,"""Riot, I'm thirsty. Can I have a glass of water?""

""Hey there! I'm going to jump in here to add some context to this discussion. Our hunger specialists are aware of the issue and they're looking into the possible ways we might want to bring satisfaction in other areas. That said, it's not something that's currently being worked on. First off, what exactly do players mean by a glass of water? Our data shows for example that there's a hidden majority who want juice, or who might be happier with a drinking fountain. We're not sure that a glass is the most effective means of liquid conveyance in the first place, and we don't want to jump the gun on that. I know some players may be disappointed by that, but know that it's not off the table, and instead of expanding our scope in that direction, the team is currently dedicated to expanding the selection of bread available, which we feel will more accurately address player concerns in the short term.""",2016-08-24 21:12:58+00:00,d6v7a2q,1.0,t3_4ze1k6,9495.0,dotamasterrace

Crimson guard could be worth it in many cases though, but it's more situational than anything else.

He is a really good hero though. Win a team fight, gain 200+ damage, dark rift to an enemy tower, destroy it really quickly. The bane of barracks.

For example, I've seen OG go farming NP safelane many times, because #1 it secures a good farm split between the cores while still picking NP and #2 it works with their team. Like, is loda gonna offlane or play np? Fuck no.

It's hard to share the farm with loda, s4 and bulldog, which happens to be a problem that has lasted for years now, especially if you wanna pick something like a prophet or ld.

Therefore he turned to his dungeon full of demonologists, promising freedom to whoever could summon a personal succubus of torment and bind it entirely to his service. The creature who arrived, Akasha by name, visited upon him such exquisite torments that he named her his Secret Queen, and he began to spend all his spare moments submitting to her clever torments‚Äîeventually abdicating all his responsibilities in his pursuit of the painful pleasures that only she could bring. Queen of Pain could bring him to the brink of death, but she was rune-bound to keep him alive. At last the King's neglect of state brought on an uprising. He was dragged from his chamber and hurled from the Tower of Invocations, and at the moment of death, Queen of Pain was let loose into the world, freed from servitude‚Äîfreed to visit her sufferings on anyone she deigned to notice.""

1510,"alright sweet, i have no idea how to mod shit anyways. 

Note:I have no idea which tracks are being played outside of the video

I think Geralt of Rivia should be main menu theme because its epic as fuck, also that is the main menu theme in W3. Replace it with the one featured in the video, and maybe have ""No Surrender"" or ""Blood on the cobblestones"" or ""At war!"" on roshan.


Laning 1 sounds just weird, and laning 2 is a little too grim I think. Would rather have [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So54yJe6CSw) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSuMscTj7Hw) or something. 

I believe ""Battle 1"" plays when there are small skirmishes, so maybe play something a little calmer like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhec7VOacSA) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMDw_3wJEcE), or even ""Wine wars"" from Blood and Wine works. You can replace the one currently set as battle 1 to either battle 2 or battle 3 idk. 

I also think you should put the song being played in ""laning 3"" in main menu, because that's one of the few that fits as a main menu theme. Replace it with ""Dun Tynne Battle"" from blood and wine, it fits almost perfectly. Speaking of main menu, Spikeroog would fit in main menu I think. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-0TZKcerow) also seems to work. It's from a trailer, but it fits. Just cut out the awards stuff.

Killed and ganked are both perfect choices though.

well, that took longer than i thought....

1735,"Opening cinematic (before the main menu) must be a scene in which GiIvasunner uploaded the snow halation crash rip, and him travelling to another dimension. Similar to the [opening to flintstones on the nes(at 0:05)](https://youtu.be/nFcbSjmzm5M)

You play as SiIvagunner in an alternate dimension. Peter griffin and homer simpson joins you as party members. Timmy's dad must be the main villain, as he was described as a low quality ripper in the power rangers gba rip. JustinRPG also joins because he is retarded and jumped into the dimension rift.

There are 3 things to collect, Grand Dad, Snow halation and loud nigra, as they're the most ""important"" ones, but there are challenges you must overcome to get the 3 memes. Kind of like in the original legend of zelda, in which you get the 3 triforce pieces, or in this case, the trinity of forced memes. Each time you get a meme piece, chad warden will talk to you, saying some vague shit about where to go and some motivational shit about AQAP. Chad warden is meta as fuck, being used as a way of communicating with the viewers in the past (through different dimensions). It fits. 

It ends with you having to leave behind family guy and simpson, because they belong in that dimension (after beating timmys dad)

GiIvasunner refused to let JustinRPG into the original universe, saying it's for the best for humanity. you can chose to let him come or make him stay in the alternate universe. Let him come with you and humanity is destroyed, game over. If you dont let him, JustinRPG gets mad, and becomes the true boss of the game. He used kazoo and distorted rips as ""spells"". He also has a reshiram bodypillow, which is uses for normal attacks.

You have to use the powers of the memes, gaining the powers of grand dad, snow halation and loud nigra. After you win, you go into the portal with the 3 saved memes, and greet all your othet memes. Soulja boy, Angry joe, chip da ripper, sens, bane, etika etc. are all there.

Story was amazing, areas were fun. Had no problems with revisiting areas. You go as fast as in other zelda games when you're not sprinting, I don't see the problem.

Twilight Princess motion controls were good, because you could aim better, but the gamecube version is also good.

Spirit tracks was fun, and had some nice post-game activity.

Super Paper Mario is pretty good, kind of innovative. I did get stuck because of some weird code-thing with blocks, though. Never understood how to get past it.

It introduced me to the awesome alchemy build though, because the character went alchemy. Made me unkillable, the only time I died from that point onwards was Imlerith, in which I died 3 times (played on deathmarch all the way)

Also I used console commands at the end of blood and wine to remove my romance with Triss to live with Ciri, who is easily the best character. Need that father - daughter time.

1974,"Yep, this is why I pretty much give up when PA is picked on the other team. There's very little you can do about it, arguably #1 counter. Get force staff after drums if you think it'll be a problem and only use it to escape.

You need to stay in a position in which you don't get focused on NP regardless of their team, it's hard to tell where the most optimal place is. You just have to try to develop a sixth sense in that subject. Let's say your team is coming from the left to kill the enemy heroes, making it a left vs right fight. You might want to position yourself on the northern edge of the fight. The enemies might be too focused on killing your teammates they don't notice you. Might sound retarded, but it's hard to put muscle memory in words or rules. Like I said, you need to get a good grip on it by playing the hero.

You also want to use your team as a human shield, having something to make the enemy unable to get close to you (complemented by sprout, good game design valve SeemsGood). Not ideal if they have ravage or echo slam or anything like that though, then you want to do as mentioned above.

2451,"Around 1960, free jazz was created as a reply to the ""bad"" direction jazz was going. They meant the core element of jazz, improvisation, had dissapeared over the years. The removal of improv first appeared in the ~1930s, with the debut of [swing jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CI-0E_jses), and was created to lift peoples spirit during the financial crisis. After a few years of swing jazz, improv made it's return with [bebop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02apSoxB7B4). After this however, [cool jazz](https://youtu.be/WU4RCzFJDRw?t=59s) was introduced, which only used the necessary notes and had no improv. After this period is when [free jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoJpDPx_qNo) became popular.

I like the early chapters and think its a big part of the game, but its still feels prologuey. The whole 7 needles feels so rushed. It all happens right after the other. It doesnt matter if it was intended for us to know his identity. It's still shitty. Having a big reveal at the end would be so much better, instead of slowly realizing it before the last chapter.

Fast forward many years, I'm playing black, got my favorite pokemon to date, an Aggron. She got ice punch from the move tutor and everything. Transferred it to black 2, to X and to ORAS. Traded a shiny blastoise from black 2 to get the aggronite from Y. Found a shiny swoobat in the wild in X, and the first pokemon after I found and caught after getting pokeballs in ORAS was a shiny zigzagoon. Got myself a gallade that oneshotted everything with close combat and an exploud named BabyRage because that fit. Life was good.

Fast forwards to one day to the summer 2015 I was on vacation, and on an amusement park. I was riding some rollercoaster, pretty harmless and slow.

3226,"Gen 1! Free gen 1 pokemon! Two mega evolutions for both mewtwo and charizard! Yaaay! Nostalgia! Mewtwo was in dire need of mega evolutions, he had *such* low stats. **2 of them**. 

Damn I hate when people consider gen 1 as the true and the ""original"" pokemln game. It's a highly flawed and outdated pokemon game.

I completely agree with you on everything. The only complaint I have with gen 5 is that the world was fairly linear, but B2/W2 fixed this. X/Y's world was a little linear but not quite as much as B/W. I absolutely hate the music in X/Y. Definitely the worst in the series. Lumiose is the worst imo, you hear it so much but it's so boring and bland in comparison to how big and vast the city is supposed to be. It didnt even succeed at that. It felt like a big, but *empty* city. The tower were just a gym you were gonna enter once, which was really boring. The city had these colour-based areas for no reason, with nothing there. There were si few things to do there. The post-game was easy enough and you were finished in an instant, and the rivals or friends were boring as fuck. I wish we get a rival like in HG/SS or gen 5. They were all pretty cool. Really hated the exp share, made it so easy. I want the old one.

It also ran absolutely horribly. Every fight ran at like 20-30 fps, and with 3d it ran at like 10-20 fps. Meanwhile, SSB3DS runs at a steady 60 at 98% of the time. They didnt even fix it for ORAS. There really arent a lot of things happening at a 1vs1 battle. Why it gotta lag? The camera also felt really zoomed in and claustrophobic. They could zoom it out a little... If only it was like colosseum and it ran better. I would rather have them perfected 2d pokemon than have a half-optimized 3d pokemon game. I believe gen 5 ran at 60 fps as well.

3549,"The manga definitely had more characthers fleshed out, but don't forget S1 E12. After corys daily president assassination planning session with Al Qaeda, he got a flashback which answers a lot of questions raised by the fans such as which corys favorite boku no pico character, if he secretly was a radical jew and if jason sexually identifies herself as a female transgender desklamp. According to Superkai64's headcanon it also answers if 9/11 was an inside job or not, and Cory's dedotated wam on his minecraft server. Besides, you SHOULD read the manga before watching the anime, so the characters not being fleshed out in the anime isnt a huge problem, because they already have been in the manga.

This episode really expanded the series' plot development and gave the anime more depth. These changes were true breakthroughs for the anime industry, and is imo one of the reasons cory in the house has aged so well, and is the greatest anime to ever exist.

4098,"Firstly, there are a few heroes who are like this: Sucks early, wrecks late. Spectre and medusa for example. If it's 50 minutes in and you have losed a few raxes, the enemies are ahead of you, but the enemy doesnt have a hero to deal properly with a hero, it is still possible to win. 

Splitpushing is also an useful tool. With tp scrolls, travel boots and spells, splitpushing is easy. If an important hero is dead, and the enemy is trying to get your rax, it is possible to somehow teleport to another lane, and try to threaten their rax. The enemy either got to try to attack the splitpusher, making their push weaken, or do a rax for rax. With proper itemization this can be very effective. Deso to damage buildings more, maelstrom/manta to kill creeps faster or necronomicon to do both.

Other reasons are smoke, roshan, buyback and long duration lockdowns. Making your whole team get invisible for wards and creeps for some seconds can be very rewarding. You can kill a high-priority target to make it easier to get objectives, or to make it less noticable that you take roshan. Buying back from your death can be very valuable. Even though you are behind you have the possibility of having two lives. Having long duration lockdowns to prevent a target from fighting or escaping is also important. Primal roar and fiends grip for example are stuns that lasts like 4-5 seconds. 

Of course it's hard to come back when you're behind,but it is easier than in LoL.",2015-11-03 16:42:41+00:00,cwn0ii1,3.0,t1_cwmylno,2754.0,dotamasterrace

4411,"Well, when I believed I had learnt everything about dota (i was 1k hours in) I thought I had learnt everything about dota.. skip forward today with 2k hours and I'm still learning a little every game.. dota is a very high skill cap game.. This is a hard question because you never stop learning, which makes it satisfying to play the game. 

You are slowly gonna improve so it doesnt matter if you start with ranked in 500 hours or not. I recommend playing a few dozen matches after u reach lvl 50 anyways so u dont land on really low mmr and you have to slowly climb up..

Which heroes goes to which lanes reeeaaaally doesnt matter when you start. Nothing expects your first games to follow the meta. But you should know that carries usually go to top or bot with one support in each lane. Mids are usually spellcasters. In the picking stage there are filters tou can use to find out who are carries and support. There are no role for mids in the filter though. Some heroes are weird with roles. Mirana can for example be played as mid, carry, support, roaming or solo laner. Tusk and bounty can both be carries or supports. Roles will come naturally to you as you play and watch what teammates and enemies do. Any hero can be whatever role they want, really, because of all the different items. But again, dont worry about roles. Just try the game out and heroes you like. There is a guy who got very high mmr by spamming the most support hero ever (Io) as a hard carry.

4418,"Gonna add to more than what the other guy said.

Void can stop time for every singe ally and enemy hero for 4-5 seconds with a huge AoE. Timewalk also makes it easy to initiate. You should only really fight with this hero when your ulti is up, you have someone to protect you when ulti is down or when it is lategame and you're really farmed. Also, his bash does double damage in chronosphere.

Venomancer have the possibility to damage their whole team for a lot of damage. Your job shouldnt be to initiate, because then you'll just die. Try to position yourself so you get your ulti off, but you can escape after that. After your ult, your job in a fight is basically done unless you have items to use.

Both nyx and bounty hunter have invis, and when it breaks it does extra damage. nyx does more damage, but it doesnt scale that well. He does have very good stun though, and good mana burn. Whenever bounty hunter kills someone that is effected by his ultimate, track, him and his allies gains bonus gold. Getting quick damage items on bounty hunter is really easy because of this, so you can do the job better than nyx after a few track kills.

Nature's prophet is my favorite hero. Mostly because of his global 20 second cooldown teleport. It can be used for farming, splitpushing and ganking. For an ez kill, Tell your teammates to get ready, then you tp in, then you sprout an enemy, unless he has a way of cutting trees, or go through them.",2015-10-06 15:00:34+00:00,cvq4pha,3.0,t1_cvpwtbr,21507.0,dotamasterrace

4681,"I got stuck in Gateon Port in gale of darkness. I didn't know where the exit were because of the cutscene.

I kept restarting games because I didn't have enough blocks, or whatever it's called, on the gamecube. Same as my other friend with a gamecube. I remember playing lego star wars, almost exclusively playing episode 1 and 2, because of this. I now know the few levels of lego star wars like it was my back pocket.

I formated my Wii because I didn't know what format meant. I only had mario galaxy, twilight princess and mario strikers, but it was annoying at the time. Also while we're talking about mario strikers, none of my friends were good at the motion control, so I refrained from charging up a shot all the way to start the motion control scene when I were playing against friends.

Not 100% related, but still. After I got a nintendo DS, I gave away my old gameboy + my leafgreen cartridge to a friend. My friend didn't really play it that much, and it ended up being lost. BUT, we managed to find the leafgreen copy 7 years later somehow, and it got returned to me.

Dota can be described as a moba, but so does so many other games. calling it an arts describes the game better. Its not that big of a deal, but you know, arts is kinda the official genre.
