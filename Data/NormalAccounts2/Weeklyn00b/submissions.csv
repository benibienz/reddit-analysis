I'm really going to miss this channel. The last 7-8 months has truly been special. Every hour every day for 9 months a new video was posted, and you never knew what it contained, all you knew was that it were going to be high quality. Sometimes, it was the flintstones theme being played with that game's soundfont, sometimes snow halation over the original track, and sometimes just loud nigra over a boat theme. I can proudly say that I have seen over 90% of siiva's videos, and liked every single one of them, whatever it was. I got really sad when the original channel got removed. Firstly because it was a grand af channel, secondly because my 100+ video playlist of giivasunner rips had to be rebuilt. In the reboot era, I remember creating a siivagunner discord theme for the unofficial discord server, and I won a spot in their detective channel, which focused on solving ARGs. I had several sleepless nights thanks to them. Thst was really fun. I gotta admit, I did not contribute all that much, but I remember helping to solve the ""24"" clue. Chad warden's and the old meme's return was really fucking epic. That was so fucking fun. Rip chad btw. Too bad the reboot mysteries didnt get completely solved. Also, fuck you, the siiva team, for making us watch 30 mins of the nutshack in search of morse codes. Anyways, after that there isn't much to say. The nutshack rips were great, i remember laughing my ass off in the first misha rip, etc. All in all, I have had a gay 'ol time with this channel and it's sad to see it go. 

There is a chance that they're faking it, but I have no idea. I mean, we dont know who is completely behind the reboot, many rips uploaded to giiva isnt reuploaded (got a few of them), and they've faked it like 3 times before. Again, i have no idea. I do believe they will return in a few months though. I feel like we are kind of a big family of like 15, living in a farm, and siiva is our bro and is leaving to pursue his dream in a city, but one day he will return to us and we will eat family recipe soup and we will enjoy it. idk what the fuck im doing with this post anymore, but I cant wait for the last 3 rips, even though at the same time I'm hoping they wont be the last.

25,2016-09-30 13:37:49+00:00,self.DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/557xgq/in_depth_storm_spirit_guide/,False,"For this guide, I'm mainly focusing on the early game, as storm spirit often just needs a good start so he can snowball too win. ^^^also ^^^if ^^^you're ^^^lookin ^^^for ^^^memes, ^^^go ^^^at ^^^the ^^^bottom ^^^of ^^^this ^^^post

When you first spawn into the game you should ask the support to pull you two tangos, so you can afford to buy a null talisman and still get a relatively fast bottle. You get nulls lvl 1 so you can use your Q to secure last hits, and some value harassment damage and last hit damage.

Because of your good mana pool and bottle, don't be afraid to get last hits with your Q and E. It's much better to secure them than getting both of them denied. You should especially do this if it's close to the rune spawning, as it makes the enemy have to make a decision, either get the last hits and exp on the creeps, or get the rune.

You should almost always go the default ability build, as it is the most efficent build. Just use Torte De Lini's guide if you don't know what the default build is.

I think it's the best to go for treads after the bottle, then raindrop and wand. It gives the survivability, tankiness and mana you need before your bloodstone, which should always be gotten first. It synergizes well with storm spirit and his ability to snowball, and the orchid isn't needed first as the enemies abilities aren't that scary in the early-mid game. After bloodstone though, you should almost always go orchid, unless you absolutely need a bkb to survive.

15 minutes bloodstone is your goal for this game. Stack and take camps, or make your supports do it, get kills when you have the chance, have a good map sense, etc. It's very important that you don't die in lane. Ask the supports to buy tps, or sentries if they have a roamer like bounty hunter or riki. If storm spirit gets shut down early it's hard to come back, so the bloodstone timing is crucial. You can often the enemy mid laner when you get level 6, and sometimes earlier if you manage to bait him. Having a support ganking mid will help you a lot, it's highly recommended that you ask for it. You can repay the favor later when you have your level 6.

Storm spirit can do something very few other heroes can, and that is his ability to get into the backlines of the fight. You should exploit this unique strength, which is something I cannot stress enough. If you quickly manage to kill the squishy supports at the back of the fight, you will quickly see that the opponent's ability to teamfight will simply crumble. After this, you can help your team kill the rest. If done correctly **this will win you the game**. Don't go in the second you see an enemy, wait a second and think if there are any heroes you can kill in the backlines. Preferably, you would want a team that consists of heroes that can occupy the carries, or whoever are in the frontlines while you take the heroes in the backlines. 

The storm spirit combo goes as following: position yourself close to the enemy so you dont lose all your mana, zip right behind the enemy, right click while zipped, vortex, hit, remnant, hit and then exhange between zipping and using remnant until they're dead, and you should of course orchid at the earliest possibility, and bkb when needed (activate bkb according to what you think the enemy will do when fighting).


**Now that it's undebatable that this post is a quality, valuable and educational post, I can now safely post my new dota hero/car fusion without the fear of it being removed.** I of course chose to paint Storm Spirit as a Tesla! [Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/nKOzLwD.png), and [here is the speedpaint of the creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzyEf27T7NI). There are of course some high quality rips to go with the high quality drawing. Hope you enjoy.

Ult is his best ability, but also more or less his only ""good"" ability, which is very weak if you are behind, and the enemies rarely run away from you. He needs a lot of farm to be useful compared to many other carries, and doesn't farm as fast.

if you think breathing is boring, think about it as a game! breathing helps with a cycle called ""photosynthesis"". when exhaling, you release co2 gas, which plants absorb to create oxygen, which is a necessity to all living beings on earth, including you! isn't that fun? who knew such a basic human function could be so complicated!

The next 20 or so claims ended with the same results, red gyms instead of blue. Just before I decided to give up I got an interesting message. It included an image of a blue gym, and the location of said gym. I grabbed my phone and rushed to the location. When I got there, guess what I found... not a blue gym, but a yellow one. It's not what I hoped for, but still a rare find. It seemed like the image I got was edited to look like there was a gym there. This is when I decided to stop my hunt for blue gyms.

Notice how giivasunner in the plane and siivagunner after the plane scene is different. Angry joe is the one who filed the copyright strike, right? But the one in the plane and the one after can't be the same person, because how would angry joe win the ballot?

Siivagunner must be a tribute channel to giivasunner, a friend or family member or something. The metal gear solid rips were made together with giivasunner or something like that. At least at the same time when he was alive.

Angry Joe must also be behind the reboot. The mysterious voice in episode2 must be him. He wants to destroy giivasunner, or anything resembling him.

He must've been the one to plant the corrupted rip hardware in the nigra store. Angry Joe is the key of ending the reboot.

Hey what's up guys and welcome to GAME THEORY the smartest show in gaming™©®

You all know some weird shit is going on with GiIvasunner right now, but what if I told you what actually happened is that we have entered a parallel universe?

Just look at [this AQAP rip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjiZIpLYWWM). It foreshadows future events. It starts off with the da/net puzzle room rip referece, your expected GRAND DAD, then out of nowhere, family guy. This isn't just foreshadowing, it's really a small rift to an alternate timeline.

Fast forward to [the crash](https://youtu.be/ywwcZn5bp1Q?t=17s), you can see, Grand dad, snow halation and all that is getting deleted. In other words, the SiIvagunner channel has entered a parallel universe with no fleenstones, snow halation or loud nigra. The rip right after the ""crash"" was an undertale rip, which is known for it's 4th wall breaking alternate timeline stuff.

We need to ask ourself, loyal theorists, what caused this rift to appear? Was it the kazoo rips, was it JustinRPG? Is it our doing, was Chad Warden right? This I do not know, but I have a theory™©® on how to get back.

The rift does not seem to be entirely closed yet. There is something that resembles loud nigra in a [pokemon ruby rip](https://youtu.be/TB3ArY5pf_U?t=53s), and something more resembling loud nigra in [an ocarina of time rip](https://youtu.be/I3Bp3pjvMgs?t=49s). People also claim to hear Joel saying ""DAD"" in [a *portal* 2 rip](https://youtu.be/9N02pb9wRYA?t=1m33s), the most recent high quality video game rips as of now.

What we need to do to travel back to the original universe. We have to find out what caused the crash, and try to make it happen again. By doing this, grand dad, snow halation and loud nigra will reappear. Using the portal to get back might connect the two dimensions even more, and let simpson and family guy keep being featured in rips. There was a good theory on how the dimension might open writted a few hours ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiIvaSunner/comments/4osb6a/my_personal_theory_i_saw_a_deer_today/), saying how memory will overflow which leads to another ""crash"". Perhaps we will soon enter the original universe?

Most people get linkens as a must have on Medusa, but I disagree. I think it only should be gotten if theres a beastmaster, a pudge or something on the enemy team, its also so expensive. An aquila and drums usually does it for stats and regen anyways. Speaking of drums, yay or nay? I think it's a really good fighting item, which is something you kinda need to do, or else your team is just gonna fall behind and the enemy get ahead. Also I think mask of madness is a really good item on her. It accelerates ger farm a lot, and gives her more DPS, It's also very cheap. If you're worried about the dmg amp, you can chose to not use it in fights or only use it when you know its safe. The amp is after the mana shield reduction anyways. I also think daedalus &gt; mkb because of the dmg nerf to mkb, unless there is a hero that has evasion on the enemy team.

Manta is the item I'm most insecure about. I feel like the damage it does is almost nothing. I think it only does 28% of your dmg when your splitshot is active and they die so quickly because of no mana shield.It has such a high cd too. In some cases SnY is better better, but then again, there are no ultimate orb.

You can also ask someone to gank, but dont force it. No one likes anyone complaining about someone not ganking.

Some heroes can jungle pretty easily. Wraith king, storm spirit, leshrac, and some heroes with lifesteal items or heal.

Last thing you can do is to gank another lane. This shouldnt be too hard if you are someone like void with lvl 6, storm spirit and qop. ",learndota2,Tips on what to do when you lose your lane,https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/3luip9/tips_on_what_to_do_when_you_lose_your_lane/
