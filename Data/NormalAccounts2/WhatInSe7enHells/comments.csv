83,"In the beginning, you're going to wanna mine Emeril.  It's nearly as valuable as the rare resources but you can find it in much larger quantities.

Alternatively, you could check the station in your system for the yellow starred items that they pay more for. Find them and sell them. 

Down the line, you've got lots of great options. Mine big asteroids until you see pirates attacking freighters. Kill and loot them.  Or attack the freighters and loot them instead.

Personally I like to find a system that buys Unstable Plasma. You make it with Plutonium and Thamium which you can find anywhere and if they buy at a 100% increase, you can sell them for 60k units a pop.

Or my all time favorite method: find a planet with vortex cubes or gravitino balls.  Most likely, sentinels will freak when you pick one up, giving you a three star wanted level. Butttt you can outrun them pretty easily with an upgraded exosuit. Get the best jet pack and stamina upgrades available, find a trading post and start doing runs filling your inventory to max, selling and repeating. Eventually the cubes will be too far away and the runs will start taking more than ten minutes.  When that happens, fly to a new trading post and start again.

So of those hundreds of millions, the center could contain tens of millions if not more.  Even if there are only a million - hell - 500,000 stars at the center, you still **don't have to worry**.

Multiplayer would work if there was an infinitesimal chance of seeing another player, but everyone could use the info you upload to the Atlas and potentially find ships/planets/life that you've named.  Thus you would experience the vast loneliness of space, knowing that others are out there, but never seeing them.

Oh wait, that's already how it works?  Perfect.

Base building would work if your ship is your home and you build onto it with upgrades that increase its cargo capacity, defenses, etc.  Then you would experience what it's like to be a lone explorer on the final frontier.

Now about this:

""Secondly, while we all start on the edge of said galaxy, if you can just restart the game to get a different planet start, you could do this again and again till you land in the same quadrant of the beginning galaxy as your friend. Thus not having to potentially cross the entire galaxy.""

That is literally the most ridiculous plan to find a friend in NMS that I have ever heard.  Do you understand that getting close enough to your friend could take literally millions of restarts?  The edge of the galaxy is **massive**.  You are severely underestimating the chances of two specific players spawning even *relatively* close to one another.  The first galaxy likely has hundreds of millions of stars in it.  The game has 18000000000000000000 planets.

Watch this and really think about your plan.  If this doesn't change your mind, you are beyond help.  Be logical, man.

Now remember that he just barely scratched the surface of the **first galactic map** in those 3 minutes of zooming through literally millions of starss.  Remember also that SM has said getting to the center will take ""hundreds of hours"".

So let's say, you are on SM starting planet from that video, and your friend is on the last planet they get to.  Remember that this would make you are your friend **lottery-level lucky**.

So say it takes you 400 hours of playing to get to him, doing nothing else, which completely ruins the game because you aren't experiencing any natural discovery.  So, 400 hours in you find you friend somewhere in space.  Assuming you both aren't burnt out and done with the game by then, playing it so rigidly without any of the intended experience.... **Time to play together right?**

WRONG.  The game isn't designed for it.  Thus:

1. If one of you dies, you have to find each other again.  So if you've explored far from the last save point, have fun.  If one of you respawns in a space station, you have to wait to find each other again.

2. You can't trade or interact in any way other than shooting one another.

3. You can't split resources.  Thus, is you find a blueprint, only one of you gets it.  New weapon, flip a coin for who gets to keep it.  Rare resource, only get half.

4. Speaking of resources, the wanted system means that while you are mining twice the resources (but only netting the same amount per person) you are attracting Sentinels twice as fast, soon becoming overwhelmed.

The list goes on and on.  The game isn't designed for multiplayer in any other way than a Journey-esque temporary chance encounter.  Spendng 400 (LOW ESTIMATE) and up to get to someone just so that you can stand next to them and literally get in each others way is ridiculous.

Furthermore, though the distance from the center would be useful as an indicator of conditions (hot, cold, life, etc) the resources available are a similar indicator.  It seems as though we are meant to be able to zip around a system with ease, so I don't see the benefit of knowing how far the planet is.  You can just point your ship in its direction and your ship calculates the distance.

Ordering planets and moons by discovery is somewhat frivolous, because it doesn't tell me anything about how many planets I've discovered total.

He says that it will take hundreds of hours to get to the center of the *galaxy* (let alone the universe) which *does* have a 'gps'.  Finding a single other person could take double that if you factor in the resources and progression necessary to continue traveling.

1. Portals may take you to planets with complex life, giving everyone a 'taste'

2. You may be able to get to a point where you can tell if a system has the potential for life without visiting it, giving you the chance to skip systems.

3. These are raw figures. 1 in 100 million planets does not mean 1 in any 100 million.  Perhaps the periphery is mostly lifeless, but as you progress to the center, the odds get better and better.

""plot line""

NMS has a lore.  There is no plot to the game.  It is a sandbox game

""The ancient civilization tablets are actually human tablets of an ancient form""

""The ancient tablets are actually about rediscovering ourselves and our past""

I don't really know what you are talking about, otherwise.  I can't comment on the sentinel human agreement that you don't really explain.

Building a civilisation or hub is settling down.  It is the opposite of the point of this game.  You implied that the gathering of resources would be a process in order to build up a city.  So once you build a city, or even just a house you are happy with, you have reason to stay there.  It discourages exploration if you have a home base.  If you keep anything in one spot in the universe it disincentivizes you leaving that spot.

This is pure speculation, based on reading just about everything in existence about the game and trying to base my ideas off of what I could see actually meshing well in the developers concept.

The thing is, eclipses here on Earth only happen the way they do because the **apparent size** of the moon and earth are the same.  The Sun is something like 400 times further away, but also 400 larger in diameter, making them appear the same size from our perspective.

Obviously, this isn't the most difficult thing to program relative to the complexity of the rest of the game.  And since eclipses are super scifi and make for great screenshots, I am assuming they built in a high likelihood for similar apparent size in planets/moons.

Also, it would make progress and trade routes **useless** the moment you hit the center, because now you just warp instantly to any point in the entire galaxy as long as anyone has been there!

911,"Fuck my own advice, it's more fun this way.

Explain this to me:  Why does Sean say the chances of finding your friends are ""basically zero""?  He knows that everyone is heading to the center, cause that's how he designed his game.  He knows your friends show up on your map and that third party chat software exists.  And yet, he still says it's singleplayer, still says you won't be able to do it.  Why?  Do you think in all the years he has been working on this game, that he never considered that the chances would be higher at the center?  The center is brighter and significantly larger than the stars in the galactic map.  The space surrounding it is much brighter than the periphery.  You wanna know why?  Because the stars are much more dense as you get closer, meaning by all logic, your chances of meeting a player increase and decrease simultaneously as you get closer to the center, canceling each other out.  Just like the odds of seeing any random person and the odds of finding your specific friends are essentially equal.  A chance meeting is unlikely, but if you are looking for ANYONE, there is a chance someone playing the game spawns near enough to you to make it remotely possible.  But once you start saying me and my ONE friend are going to find each other, you are being foolish.  You will be placed on two randoms stars in a galaxy of hundreds of thousands (minimum).  The odds of you being within a feasible distance of one another are MegaMillions Lottery level improbable.

This is the only logical, intelligent expectation one can have given the facts.  There is NO good reason for SM to lie and you'd be a fool to think he hasn't considered this already...",2016-05-25 04:03:28+00:00,d3iofj1,1.0,t3_4kxmza,3505,NoMansSkyTheGame
912,"Hahaha, it's hilarious that you talk about common sense while arguing with the developer of the game, who says this is singleplayer.  He knows about the center.  He knows about seeing your friends on the galactic map, because he made the damn game.  And he still says you won't find your friends.  How is that not enough for you?  The star that is ""relatively close"" will, by all likelihood be hundreds of thousands of systems away.  You are talking about 2 random people dropped in random spots on the edge of a galaxy-sized galaxy and you think you are going to be close enough to meet?  You do understand that getting from planet to planet is supposed to be difficult, requiring you to mine, learn languages, work with factions, etc. before moving on.  What if you are on opposite sides of the center?  You, sir, have no common sense.",2016-05-25 03:48:56+00:00,d3inxvv,4.0,t1_d3iktag,4864,NoMansSkyTheGame
913,"Your.Friends.Location.Will.Be.Too.Far.Away.

Riddle me this, smart guy: Sean Murray says the odds of meeting your friends are ""basically zero"".  Sean Murray knows that all the players are heading towards the center.  Do you think that in 3+ years of development, he didn't have this oh so brilliant idea that players will have a ""better"" chance at the center?  SO WHY IS HE STILL INSISTING THE CHANCES ARE INFINITESIMAL? 

Look at the galactic map.  You are your ugly friends are dropped in random spots in that mess.  Each point of light is a star.  Look at the comparatively gigantic bright light at the ""center"".  I wonder why it's so much bigger and brighter?  Oh, because its the MOST DENSE area of the map, meaning that the closer you get, your odds increasing is offset by the density of stars, the difficulty of planets and the limits of hyperdrive.

Have some common sense and give up on the multiplayer.  Steam and Sony are both labeling the game SINGLEPLAYER for a reason.  You are fighting with a brick wall.

920,"I considered a ""useful"" way to name things a while back during the height of the hype, but I keep wanting to say fuck it and name things after my favorite Sci-Fi  Lots of people will be doing it, but who cares?  It would be nice to look back and remember Jubal, the warm, pleasant beach planet in the Valentine System.

This was my idea:

example : DVD29C3-K.RAD.PuHr.XXX

DVD - My Initials

29 - System #

C - Planet (preferably A being closest to the sun)

3 - Moon #

K - Korvax, G for Gek, etc. I considered an indicator for faction but we don't know enough about them yet.

RAD - radioactive. HOT, COLD, ACID, etc could be used as well. I would cut it down to a single letter but on the crazy off chance someone comes across them, I want it to be somewhat easy to decipher.

PuHr - Plutonium and Heridium being the resources available.  If this info is already included when we upload to the Atlas, I'll leave it out.

XXX - 3/5 Star Rating for how severe the Sentinel presence and/or how strict they are about mining.  I figure once you visit a planet with XXXXX and get stomped the moment you land, you'd crack the code mighty fast.  The problem with this is it's subjective and I won't have any context until I've explored.  I might rate something XXXXX and then get to another planet and realize the last one was cake.

- Trader Race described as Bird Men (Gek?)

- No cities

YOUR idea of the game was wrong, so now your pouting and whining.  Its like saying you would love Rocket League if instead of cars, you controlled a person and instead of playing soccer you had guns and could shoot each other.

You clearly came here to write a post that would give you the chance to say circlejerk as many times as possible.

And way to leave out the parts of my post that explain WHY you are wrong.  So you can build a base on one planet.  Then leave that planet to build a new base on another one?  What is the point of the base then when you aren't supposed to settle down in this game?

You design your own ship?  The game is filled with an endless array of ships.  While you explore, you can buy a ship that you like.  That is the way ships work in this game.  So adding in the ability to design your own would directly negate the mechanic already in place.

If you say base building, you're wrong.  The same game would still exist after you finished building your base.  And if you ever wanted to play the game, you would have to leave your base.  Because it's an exploration and survival game.

If you say designing a ship, you're still wrong.  The same game will exist when you get out of your ship.  Why would you want to build a ship to fly around in a game you don't like?

If you say multiplayer, get the fuck out of here with that shit cause we have no patience for it.

This is designed to be a single player experience in a multiplayer world.
4. The rest of what you said was basic nonsense.

TLDR: Trying to find your friends in NMS is like trying to play GTAV by following all the rules of the road and not breaking any laws.

The lobby that you carry around with you now can, it's almost like I don't wanna say because people will just test it, it can carry a few people. More than what you will see during the normal course of the game. 

Will your friends take priority?

No. Just to be really clear, the reason that I'm saying this is we just want to be really clear with people that it is not an MMO. All of those questions are leading toward that. There are loads of MMOs out there. People can play those. We want people to be able to get a sense of playing with other people and to see other people and feel like this is a real, live universe.

1140,"I hear you, but I have a few counterpoints.  First off, let's remember that not all players need specific goals to play a game long term.  Plenty of people put hundreds of hours into games that require you to make your own story.  But more importantly, there are a ton of stories and goals built into this game.  Learning languages means more than just being able to trade, it means discovering the unique story of each race.  Exploring ruins to uncover the truth about how they got there (the ancient race) is going to be a great story if you have any faith in our humble leader Sean.  There's going to the center just to see what's there.  

If this still stands, Sean once said that there will be a single, important event for each race or region of space or something that the player can take part in which will change the area forever.  That was a long time ago, but it is confirmed that you will have the chance to get involved in large scale battles and events in an existing universe.  You won't be the star of the show, but that doesn't mean you won't be a part of important things.  There will be conflicts between warring factions and probably a ton more that they haven't shown because HG is trying desperately to not give away everything in a game about discovery and stepping into a science fiction book cover.   Stepping into a story already in motion where you aren't the big hero or the big villian.  But they are probably still out there.

I feel like that's a whole lot of in game goals and a bunch of different stories and plot lines to discover.  Add in the option to play your own version of Han Solo, or Malcolm Reynolds, or a Merchant Prince, and I don't see what more anyone could need from one game.",2016-05-07 01:16:00+00:00,d2vvtwl,2.0,t1_d2vtv8v,3569,NoMansSkyTheGame

That's what the Atlas is for (presumably, unless it's evil of course). I think the idea of groups forming to communicate with each other is neat-o.
