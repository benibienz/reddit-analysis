There is nothing to buy once you have a 48 slot ship.  But I am remaining hopeful that HG will add new things to buy in the future.  This is just about fixing the actual mining, trading process of gaining wealth, not spending it.

First off, here are the restriction I imposed to make the game a bit more rewarding.

- Dismantled scanner
- Never recover lost inventory upon death
- If I die in space, I consider my ship lost, take it down to the surface of the nearest planet and find a crashed one to replace it.
- If I die in atmosphere, I consider my ship crashed and destroy a handful of components.
- As a trader, I leave most ship slots open for cargo, allowing only for full damage upgrade on one weapon, full shields, and the necessary warp drives.
- As a trader, I leave most suit slots open for cargo, allowing only for upgraded sprinting and jet boost.  Basic shields only.

Mods I use:
- Big Things 1/2
- Low Flight
- Police State (makes sentinels an actual threat)

All of this combined has made playing as a trader much more fun, but the problem remains that there is no real incentive to trade the rare items or products when vortex cubes and emeril trade are significantly more lucrative.  Even those latter items are pointless to trade due to the over abundance of them in the galaxy and the binary profit system (either a station buys for (-5%-5%) Galactic Avg or +99%GA.  Those are literally the only options)

I would love to see a Trader Prince Mod that includes these relatively simple changes.

- Re-balance the amount of resources you find on surface.  Include planets truly **covered** in Murrine, for example, such that I can actually fill my inventory with it as fast as I could Emeril.  These planets should be rare, but possible.  Include some actually variety in the amounts available planet to planet.  ATM there is no reason to ever mine the rares, and Emeril is too common.

- Re-balance prices at stations/npcs.  There need to be places where I can buy large quantities of goods for dirt cheap (-200% G.A.) and places where I can sell for more profit (rare stations that buy Emeril for +400% G.A.)  That way, I actually have a reason to keep searching for the perfect buyer.  Further, I have never seen a station that buys Emeril for even +100%, the stations should have a chance to buy or sell ANY item for a range of profits.

- Rebalance the sell price of products.  Make it worthwhile to build things.  Dynamic resonators, Aronium, etc are pointless because you stand to gain SO MUCH MORE income by mining giant rocks of Emeril.

I believe these three simple changes would make the trading aspect of the game significantly more fun.  Let me know what you think.

We see the Snake Kites circling a portal with sine wave-ish land masses.  Then the player travels through the portal to a lush green planet and there they are, circling the portals on this new planet.  There was speculation as to whether they were placed there or had wandered through a portal.

I have always theorized that these creatures are connected to the portals in some way.  I think they always appear around them, and might even be useful as a way to spot a portal location from afar.  In the latest trailer, we see them again, on a totally different planet, and it looks like they are grouped together and circling.

Essentially science and explorer got lumped into one category.

However, there are supposedly still four races: science (korvax), gek (traders), and I'd imagine an explorer and fighter.

So why be rid of the 4th ship class?  It seems as though depending on the controlling race of the area you were in, you could purchase each of the four ship classes.  Granted, you can buy any ship of any class that you see on your travels, but I imagine Korvax NPCs, for instance, would only sell Korvax ships.

Furthermore, I had always heard the ship class specialties as:

fighter - light weapons, engines

trader - heavy weapons, cargo

science - hyperdrive, scanning

explorer - hyperdrive, stealth

I like the symmetry of this, and I'm confused as to how these three ship classes break down in terms of proficiencies.  (Yes, I know you can do anything in any ship).

**HrSi** - Heridium and Silicon are the common resources.  I will omit this if resource info is included upon upload to the Atlas.


That's it!  Simple and to the point.  I can track how many discoveries I've made and still have fun using names from my favorite books.  Since I will be role playing as a merchant prince of sorts, it makes sense to name things in such a way to ease trade.

As for ships, I'm going to use the names of Greek astronomers.  After that I will use the names of Amazons and Titans.  I love the sound of Greek names and they are easy to ""feminize"" if I want my ships to be female ;)

**EDIT:**

Thanks for all the suggestions and kind words!  I'm consider making some changes already!  I think this makes for a better tracking system for me while remaining useful for others and it emphasizes the common name.

Original example (moon): DVD12-A1.Gaal.HrSi

New example (same moon): Gaal.DVD12-A72-b112 .HrSi

**DVD12** - This would still be identifier and system # by order of discovery (12th system discovered)

**A** - This now means the distance from the parent star.  The uppercase denotes a planet.

**72** - This is now the planet # by order of discovery

**b112** - Follows the above.  Lowercase means moon so 'b112' is second moon from the planet, 112th moon discovered

**HrSi** - Still common resources, if necessary

(I tried to make the numbers in the new example more realistic considering that by the 12th system, I will have discovered a *lot* of planets and even more moons.)

I love the concept of having one ship at a time.  Obviously, it doesn't make sense to store a ship in a space station when we are lone explorers constantly on the move.  It also will make for very difficult decisions.  Our ships will show wear and tear, and selling a ship I've grown attached to and been through hell with is going to be *tough*.

Despite all of this, I believe that implementing a freighter that could store large amounts of cargo and up to four ships (one for each type) would be a great addition for later.  Moving storage works.

It does give you the ability to hold ships you would have otherwise sold, but there is a stark downside.  You can park your freighter in a system and take a ship out, but pirates would be able to take out your freighter while you are away.  Perhaps you could have some type of signal that warns you when your freighter takes damage so you can try to rush and protect it, but leaving it alone would be very risky.  Also every time you take that freighter out to a new system, you have to risk all four of your favorite ships, not to mention all the units you put into them and all the cargo onboard.  One group of bad pirates and you've lost your babies. I think the pros and cons even out.

To others, it might be an 'aha moment' of sorts, so I think it is still worth laying out.  Also, we won't know the best strategy for anything until Joon, but what the hell, it's fun to plan and speculate a bit.

So, we know that each class of ship is somewhat better suited to a play style.  Fighter ships will be somewhat better suited for speed and weaponry, Traders will have cargo space and weaponry, Science vessels will have stealth and distance, and Explorers will have scanning and distance.

Given that, what if you want to be a trader or a game hunter, but also want to get to the center as fast as possible?  It's rather simple...

Depending on where you start out, the resources available and the controlling race/factions, choose a play style that will be most effective for raising standing and capital.  If the NPCs are militaristic, start fighting.  If you meet the Korvax, go peaceful and maybe get your mine on.  Once you have enough units, buy the best Explorer you can find and fit it for distance and scannning.  Leave the system and head out.

Start hopping from system to system best you can, scanning and exploring just enough to find what you feel are the most ideal conditions for your intended play style.  If you want to trade, find a system with heavy traffic and lots of barren planets, or find a planet with complex life and get hunting.  Once you are satisfied that you've found a good spot, ditch the Explorer for something more your style and go to town.  Have some fun.

Once you feel done with your current system, or just feel the itch to head closer to the center, buy another Explorer.  You should have more units, so you should be able to fit it even better for even more efficient travel. Rinse and repeat your way to the center while still enjoying the role you wanted to play.



That's it. Simple but effective.  You wont be getting too attached to any one ship but I think it's a decent method for balancing the race to the center with your hopes for being No Man's Sky's Bel Riose or Han Solo.



TL;DR Use an Explorer to system hop until you find good conditions for your intended play style or role, then swap ships for something that fits your role.  Rinse and repeat to the center.",NoMansSkyTheGame,"Given what we now know, I believe this is a solid preliminary strategy for those who have a role in mind, but also want to get to the center fast.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4j97rg/given_what_we_now_know_i_believe_this_is_a_solid/

Imagine you knew almost nothing about NMS, but someone bought it for you on June 20th and you decided to play it.

On your first planet, you get attacked by a plant and acid rain is eating your armor and you have to discover all the mechanics of the game organically, finding cover in a crashed ship or mining the right resources.  You mine too much and learn about the sentinels the hard way, almost dying along the way.  An hour in you realize you can learn alien languages.   Two hours in you find a massive ruin and explore it, discovering many words and beginning to learn about the ancient race that left the sentinels. 3 hours in you fly out into space and see traders warping in for the first time and navigate to a space station to really start the journey.

These are the experiences we all could have had if we had gone into this game blind.  We will never get to experience the game in its purest fashion.

However, it's actually a testament to HG's great achievement in scale.  Like the concept of infinity itself, most people just can't comprehend what a practically infinite universe means.  And I don't mean practically as in 'almost', I mean in practical terms, the universe and even the first galaxy of NMS are infinite.

99% of planets will not be discovered (or was it 99.9?).  We represent the 1% and the 99% stands between you and your buddies.  Sure, a lot of that number comes from the 10th, 20th, 100th galaxy no one will ever see (assuming that we get to visit new galaxies one at a time), but the FIRST galaxy could potentially, dare I say likely house millions of stars.  Yet these 'factions' are laboring under the delusion that they will catalog enough of that to find each other.  They say maybe two people will only be a couple of jumps away from each other.  In reality, you'll be lucky if you and another specific player are within 10,000 jumps of each other. At the center itself, you could still be 1000's of jumps away.

Sean estimates 100 hours of playtime to get to the center of the first galaxy, and he says that is if you are doing literally nothing else.  So everyone who says they can't wait to play, and love the rest of the game but also want to find people can give up right now.  You cannot enjoy this game for what it is while also actively trying to break it.  You cannot explore and learn and love this universe when you are grinding your way to another person.  Any other person.  You will be surrendering your playtime to nothing but mining or selling exactly what you need to get to the next system as fast as humanly possible.  You will miss out on everything the game is meant to be, unless you plan on playing for 150 hours the right way, the way the game was DESIGNED TO BE PLAYED and then putting another couple hundred in to finding your friends or your faction of like-minded simpletons.  All so that you can walk around together and split resources? or fit too many people in one area so that the lobby can't accommodate everyone? Or try to ""command and control"" a system despite there being no in-game mechanics to do so and despite the fact that everyone else playing the game would also have to ACTIVELY SEEK YOUR SYSTEM OUT in order for you to affect them in any way.  It's pointless. 

Before this post gets any longer than it is (I could go on and on) I'll sum up with this: I think the idea of all of us, the entire player base slowly cataloging a chunk of the first galaxy over a year or so is awesome.  That's what the Atlas is for (presumably, unless it's evil of course).  I think the idea of groups forming to communicate with each other is neat-o.  But The CREATOR OF THIS GAME has pleaded with potential players from Day 1 to not think of this as a multiplayer game in any other way than Journey or Dark Souls is a multiplayer game. Do not fight him.  He will win.  You will lose.
