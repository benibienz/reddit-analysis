10,"Thalia is in there just to mess up the opponent if the game goes later than I intend it to. If they slow me down I'll slow them down back but you're right she goes against what the deck is trying to do.

I played against the Devils at the prerelease and they were completely annoying to face plus I'm a sucker for Trample in this deck. The fact that they can attract a blocker would leave room for my already board-established creatures to swing through and deal some damage. They're the finisher I guess.

Thing is I JUST netdecked. Never tried to build my own until some time later when I wanted to try draft.

Totally feel you on the Thalia's Lancers a 4/4 First Strike for 5 won't really be game changing and although I am running a few Legendary Creatures the tutor effect is mediocre. 

About the Duskwatch Recruiter - I'm already running 8 2drop creatures and if I were to add another I'd go with [[Selfless Spirit]]. Dropping an Avacyn, having her transform and sacrificing Selfless Spirit to save all your creatures sounds like a pretty good move.

28,"Yep! There's this Magic the Gathering Format called Standard. You can only use the cards from the newest sets. 

If you go here : http://whatsinstandard.com/ you can see which sets are currently Standard legal.

Also: You really could try going to a prerelease (either tonight at midnight or Saturday/Sunday) cause everyone is playing with the new cards for the first time. Its very laid-back and you're allowed to ask the players around you to help build your deck unlike in other tournaments where that's in no way allowed. Its a really good way to start your collection also. You build a 40 card deck with the cards you open in your boosters and the game store usually supplies you with the lands. Usually 17 / 18 lands to 23 / 22 spells. Once you make a deck you like you can buy some singles or trade your other cards to get cards you feel will complement the deck you built. Just watch out and don't get scammed cause there are a lot of people there trying to take advantage of newer players.

AND Prerelease is the most new player friendly atmosphere. I attended one when I had no clue what I was doing and had a blast. There were some players that tried to use my lack of knowledge to their advantage to get an easy win but there were many others that told me (during the game) what move to make and if I made a bad move they would tell me and let me take it back.",2016-07-15 21:38:34+00:00,d5duo0f,7,t1_d5dsjdk,3122,magicTCG

37,"Hey! Welcome to (possibly) the best community on the planet :P

I haven't been playing that long either but the first thing I would do is to add another color to give your deck more flexibility. Black would look good with the lifegain theme you've got goin.

Adding [[Drana's Emissary]] and [[Cliffhaven Vampire]] should go a long way. I personally also like [[Serene Steward]]. Then since you're in White / Black add [[Ayli, Eternal Pilgrim]]. The Deathtouch on her will make people think twice about attacking with their huge creature and her abilities are relevant to your deck. She's legendary though so remember you can't have more than 1 of her out on the battlefield at once. 

I would also invest in some cheap dual lands like [[Forsaken Sanctuary]] to start off with.

Then I would add a Planeswalker. In my opinion they're the most badass cards out there and they can sway the momentum of battle very quickly. Since you're already in White I'd suggest [[Gideon, Ally of Zendikar]] but he's kinda expensive.

http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&amp;type=+[Planeswalker]&amp;format=+[""Standard""]

That's a list of all the Planeswalkers that are Standard Legal right now and out of all of them in your colors, Gideon &amp; Sorin are the best.

41,"Honestly I had the same problem. First off - Decide which format you want to play and learn it inside out. If you choose standard learn the metagame inside out and you'll be able to pretty much know what your opponent is running if he/she is playing say Rakdos Madness Vamps. 


You'll know there's a possibility of him or her holding a Fiery Temper while he's attacking with an untransformed [[Heir of Falkenrath]] and [[Olivia, Mobilized for War]] with 1 red mana open so you should think twice about blocking his Olivia with your [[Sigarda, Heron's Grace]] . 

Also, I personally suck at Draft so I still play it for fun with friends when the chance appears but when I played my first gameday (which was also my first attempt at constructed) I got to the finals and I believe I would have won had I not forgotten my sideboard at home lol :P (those pesky flyers and lack of Clip Wings)


Finally - You gotta find a deck that speaks to you. The first deck I've built was a G/W +1 / +1 counters deck and didn't even think twice about building anything else. It was instinct. 


TL / DR ;

1 - Choose your Format.

2 - Learn the Metagame

3 - Get a deck that speaks to you.",2016-07-07 02:11:13+00:00,d52a4n1,1,t3_4rlnc9,6750,magicTCG
