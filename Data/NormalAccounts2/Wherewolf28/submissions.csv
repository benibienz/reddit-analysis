I instantly bought it, they have 4 more left. What's the deal???

I lost my father recently and fell deep into depression - I felt lost, disoriented and defeated. After a long while of wallowing I told myself enough is enough; I need to do something so I don't fall too deep into these dark thoughts. While journeying the downtown of my city I saw a poster with ""Games &amp; Hobbies"" written on it, went in the store and met the owner. It was such a welcoming atmosphere that I told myself I would keep going back just to hang out with them. Then I discovered Magic. The art sucked me right in; it was dark and violent (which reflected my feelings at the time) yet had angels (which to me have always represented hope) and noble knights. Just goes to show that everyone from the brooding maniac to the saint could play and enjoy this game. Through playing Magic I have met so many amazing people who have helped me heal both mind and soul. There will always be those MTG players that just straight piss you off but the community as a whole is so welcoming and appreciative that I now wouldn't want to be part of any other tribe.

All in all I thank every single one of you : the spikes, the casuals, the Melvins, the Johnnys and everyone in between. You are a serene group of people and although I know this community will constantly evolve into something different I hope the foundation does not falter. To me the cards aren't what matter most, what matters is the type of person they attract.",magicTCG,A big thank you to the whole Magic community!,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4ubai8/a_big_thank_you_to_the_whole_magic_community/

I was tired of netdecking and tried building this without thinking of all the Selesnya decks running around. I'm pretty happy with it just wondering what you guys / girls think I should replace.

I'm having some trouble against my friends' Rakdos Vampires deck - it gets so many flyers (and creatures in general) up early and its tough to deal with. 

I'm leaving in [[Tenacity]] because it has saved me a few times (although I went from 2 copies to 1). I recently put in [[Gryff's Boon]] just to deal with flyers. Odric seems pretty fly in here also (giving your Tireless Tracker flying with it is worth just seeing the opponents' reaction). What do you guys think of [[Confront the Unknown]] as a combat trick?

Also would like some help with Sideboard. I don't even have one right now and am planning on taking this to FNM tomorrow. I have Hallowed Moonlight against CoCo decks and that would be pretty much it.
