At least they knew why she'd pushed so hard for the Fazbear Act. And she was officially an ambassador for animatronics, now.

King Asgore was at the front, talking about something she didn't care about. It was over, for the monsters. There was nothing to salvage, even considering the fact that humans could be arrested for assault against a monster. No charges, just held for a little while.

Katy tapped her fingers against the desk, growing increasingly annoyed. The sound of metal on metal would have been far more satisfying, but sadly, they didn't know yet. They just knew she was an ""associate of the monster peoples"".

At least her powers *were* fully back, now. That trip on the plane had frightened them back into her. New York was too far, for her taste.

""... However, the monster peoples are a *scourge* on resources...""

Katy tapped her fingers more forcefully, and Freya reached out to grab her hand.

""... They do not have a nation...""

She shook Freya off, and stood up.

""Excuse me, but do you know what you're talking about?""

The US ambassador stopped.

""I-""

""You don't, do you?"" Katy continued, ""You've just made this all up so you can sound good. What ""*scourge*"" is there?""

""They're taking valuable resources!""

""The entire monster population is only around 10,000 individuals. None of them know how to drive yet, so they're not wasting oil, or gas, or whatever, and that's not nearly enough people to waste food, considering they're still drawing from Mt. Ebott's resources.""

""You can't be serious.""

""Oh, but I am.""

~ ~ ~

Katy stalked off, out of the UN building. There was an edge on the sidewalk, and she sat down, head in her hands. Freya walked up behind her.

""Are you okay, Ms. Katy?""

""I'm fine, thanks.""

""Everything will be alright. We'll figure this out.""

Katy smiled.

There was a gunshot.

Freya looked a bit astonished as Katy wiped the oil off her cheek. There was a hole, a clean one, too, that cut into her mouth and bled oil.

The man holding a gun backed up, but Katy was already standing, smirking. Wind rushed around her, and she held her hand out to her side.

There was a flash of light, and a white fox standing there, holding a sword.

He turned to them, wide-eyed, and said, ""You guys are supposed to wait in the entryway if you want to try out the attraction.""

There was a loud crack, and the blackness flashed around them. Once, twice, three times, and they were back in New Home, standing at the barrier. There was another crack, and the monsters, the ones Freya had befriended were standing behind them.

Katy held her hands out in front of her, and a heart appeared in them. It was a soft gray, and Flowey looked a bit confused.

**That's not a color I know.*

""***I think that's probably Corruption.***""

He smiled, and chuckled.

**Good enough for me.*

The heart snapped into the Flower, and Katy disappeared. Flowey morphed, roots tangling up out of the ground, and forming into legs. A long tail formed out of its stem, which slowly became a torso. Four of the petals dropped off, and the other two morphed into ears. Flowey's face became more snout-like, and the form slowly stood up.

A white tiger stood in front of Freya, with a fox's tail.

""***Saber, I'm not sure that went as planned.***"" It said. It looked down at its hands, with a shocked look on its face. ""***We're not even an animatronic.***""

294,"""Hey, Mike, you'll be fine alone in that place for a night, right? I don't want you getting hurt,"" Mike's girlfriend, Jessie, asked.

""I'm gonna be fine! It's just a kids' pizzeria,"" Mike responded.

""Alright. Please, just... be careful.""

Mike smiled, and hopped in his car. He knew about the dangers of Freddy Fazbear's, but it didn't really seem so bad, today. He needed money, and working there might be his only ticket to any other job.

Fazbear's was only a few blocks away, and he got there within a few minutes. He parked his car just as the last guests were leaving, and he smiled and waved while they left.

""Mike! Good to see you've made it,"" A man said. Mike smiled, and offered a hand to shake.

""Good to be here. You must be my boss?"" Mike asked.

""Yes, that I am! I'll help you get all set up in your office, then I'll leave you alone for the night. Oh, I'm Mr. Afton, by the way. Please, call me William.""

""Can do, William.""

Afton opened the door to the pizzeria, and held it open for Mike. The animatronics were standing still on their stage, but they still kind of weirded him out.

""Come on, down this hallway."" Afton urged Mike to move away from the characters, and he quickly followed the advice.

""Now, this is your office. It's not much, but it's safe.""

""Safe? What from?""

""Oh, all sorts of things. People sneaking in, trying to steal stuff, the animatronics themselves, but I doubt you'll actually need to use any of the safety protocols.""

""Why would the animatronics be a threat?""

""Well, they have to move around, at night. Otherwise, their servos get all locked up, and they can't preform for the kids the next day. They're a bit touchy, though, and might see you as an endoskeleton without its costume. Then, they'll try to put you in one, and that wouldn't be good.""

There was a thump outside the right door, and Afton tapped the button behind him. It closed with a metallic bang, and Afton chuckled.

""Hmm, Chica must already be wandering around. Well, that's no matter. Now, you only have a limited amount of power each night. I know, it sounds strange, but we've had to make some pretty serious budget cuts to keep this place running.""

There was another thump outside the left door, and Afton gestured towards it.

""Close that for me, would you, Mike?""

Mike tapped the door button, and it slammed closed.

""Why do I need to close the doors?"" Mike asked.

""Well, that's the thing. Those characters really are dangerous, and those doors keep them out. Here, I'll show you.""

Afton tapped the light button on the right door, and the pair saw Chica, standing in the window.

""Ah, Chica. Hello, darling.""

""What the hell?!""

""Exactly. I fear we may be trapped in here.""

The lights suddenly went out, and the doors shot up.

""Mr. Afton?""

""Yes?""

""Are we going to die?""

351,"Fazbear's Fright. Make it bigger, add more animatronics, and make it safer.

The main thing to do with Fazbear's Fright would be to fully gut it before adding extra space and replacing the ventilation, lighting, and anything else that might be dangerous.

Also, take a good, solid look at any characters before they come in. If they actually happen to have a dead body inside them(I'M LOOKING AT YOU, SPRINGTRAP), either take it out, totally clean out the animatronic, and replace the skeleton with better, safer parts. If they move on their own, take them apart, bash them up, and dump them in a McDonald's dumpster.

The attraction should also have a real Fazbear's vibe to it. That probably means knocking down all inside walls and trying to make it look a bit more like either the FNaF 1 location or the FNaF 2 location. Actual events would be hosted, and it would behave like a real Fazbear's(without the murders) during the day. At night, it would behave mostly like a haunted house.

There would be a small fee for entry, and then small groups could take a ""tour"" of the place, led by a night guard. The night guard gets ""taken"" by one of the animatronics, and then it sort of plays out like the stuff towards the end of TSE, and the goal is basically not to get touched by the animatronics, or you're out of the game.

Everything was black, save for one spark of light ahead of her. She got to her feet, and found that she could stand on the dark void beneath her.

She walked towards the yellow spark. It got larger and larger with every step, until she was standing right in front of it.

Tap.

A white bordered screen came up in front of her.

I'm sort of having trouble soaking this in, y'know? I mean, I guess I was expecting a new game after FNaF 3, so it wasn't really such a big deal for me. When FNaF 4 came out, it was really the last game, at least, for a while.

It's been sort of a shock for me, having the main series over. FNaF World is clearly a spin-off, and I'd count Sister Location in the same vein. While nobody I really know out in the real world appreciates my undying love for the series, I've met so many great people here.

I guess I'll mention some specifics, because why not.

/u/Bonfim_BR, you've been an incredibly encouraging person, and I can't thank you enough. I've tried to art as well as you, but it never really comes out quite right.

You, the guy who wrote this post! AutoMod won't let me tag you, but anyway, you're a great friend. I'm glad you got chosen as a mod, no matter what people think.

/u/Kairinezz, /u/GameboyJr, and the other FazCo mods, it's been such an amazing honor getting to work with you. I just want to say thanks for everything.

And finally, /u/chaosdelivered, I don't think my life would be quite at all the same if I hadn't met you through Reddit. You're one of my best friends, and it's all because of Five Nights at Freddy's.

I'm still forced to be friends with this person, even though when I ask him to please talk a little bit less about a game that I hate that he won't shut up about(PayDay 2), he gets incredibly angry. But, no, I'm not allowed to talk about FNaF either. Not at all.

Mettaton was sitting on a swivel chair next to a counter, which the girl didn't think had been in the game before.

There were two more chairs in the center of the room, which had a strange red liquid on them. Undyne was standing over the chairs, holding a spear, and Papyrus was slowly backing away.

989,"Great, thanks! Some suggestions on lyrics follow.

The 7 line chorus is really, really weird. Everything following it feels sort of off-beat, which is pretty much the whole song.

My suggestion is, instead of this:

&gt;I am confused... what do I do?

&gt;Do I flee? Or do I stay?

&gt;Do I cry? Or do I play?

We go for this:

&gt;I'm so confused, what can I do?

&gt;I won't become someone like you.

&gt;Do I run, or do I stay?

&gt;Should I weep, or should I play?

I know, major changes, but trust me, this sounds better.

Rhyming is important too, so you'll have to adjust a lot of the lines. The next four lines of the chorus can be adjusted, too.

&gt;Is this all a dream or is this real life? Will I survive this unknown nightmare?

&gt;Do they want my blood? Do they want my flesh?

&gt;Or maybe they're my friends?

&gt;Maybe I will just fly, into the light.

To, maybe this?:

&gt;Is this a dream or is this real life?

&gt;Can I make it through the night?

&gt;Do they want my blood? 

&gt;Do they want my flesh?

&gt;Or could they want to be my friends?

&gt;Maybe I'll just fly, fly, fly, into the light.

Repeat that for the rest of the choruses.

Alright, first four lines of the verse.

&gt;Everything is flashing before me, maybe if I believe, they will all go away

&gt;They are gone and I am remaining, do I stay or should I join the party?

&gt;The man behind the curtain, was to blame for all of this

&gt;He locked me in my room again, I will not be scared, because he is with me

This is weird on so many levels. It's lacking rhyming, which most songs should have, and has this really weird cadence to it. This needs a whole ton of adjustment, which I might do in the morning, since it's 1 in the morning right now, and I can't fall asleep, so this is probably the wrong time to be doing this anyway, but I don't think I care anymore.

Again, this is a five line verse. Weird. It either needs to drop a line or add three, but that might get sorted out when the lines get fixed to match the same sort of cadence as the chorus.

The next verse is a four line verse, but there are a few things wrong with this one, too. This should really be the bridge, but it has the same feel as the other verse. I suggest adding a bridge and leaving this verse in with adjustments.

And, it probably needs one or two more instances of the chorus. Just to balance everything out.

I'll probably be back online at 1:00 PM-ish Central Standard. I'll try to work on this some more, then.

They once had one guy renting a five bedroom house, who they didn't really check on for about a year, until he stopped paying his rent for about 4-5 months. The inside of the home smelled of feces and death, and everything seemed to be leaking.

Every single interior had a fist hole in it, and the walls in the basement had been shot multiple times with a BB gun, and had been mutilated with a machete. The carpets had clearly been used as a bathroom, since the toilets had overflown when the tenants couldn't be bothered to clean them out.

There were used tampon applicators, crack pipes, and half smoked joints in all the chairs and couches, and the bedrooms each had two or three dirty mattresses in them, mostly coated with blood and urine.

There were also five big screen TVs, three or four Xboxes, and three PS4s, all unopened, in the garage. And you wonder why they couldn't pay their rent? ",2016-05-31 02:42:28+00:00,d3px28l,1.0,t3_4lpo5p,45220.0,AskReddit

I'd get up, eat breakfast, go to work, and get hit by the 5:30 to St. Paul on the way home. Even if I left early, or late, it'd always be the 5:30 to St. Paul. It had begun to get on my nerves.

But hey, I didn't really have to eat anything, or have normal interactions.

My family and my friends all knew about this, by now. I'd talk to them during work, then head home and get hit by the 5:30 to St. Paul.

I guess the one thing that bothered me was the sheer consistency of it. Why not let me live one freaking work day where I didn't get hit by the bus? It'd be a real nice change of pace.

At least I always woke up the next morning, unharmed. It wasn't a terrible existence. At least all my injuries went away. I convinced someone to hack my arm off with a chainsaw, one day, just before I left work. Well, there was my arm, attached to my body the next day.

I did enjoy the fame, too. Once the newspapers found out about this whole thing, it's been in the news every single day.

1359,"Do *nothing* that shows they get to you.

My gym teacher all through elementary school hated me with a passion, since I seriously hurt myself within the first few weeks I had her. She then refused to let me sit out, and I ended up not being able to bend over for a while without hurting myself. I got a doctor's note, and she seemed to think I forged it.

She then started to despise me, blaming everything that went wrong on me. I never got chosen to do anything, which is distressing for a 7 or 8 year-old. Somebody actually pushed me over, once, and she had *me* sit out for a while, because I fell over.

2nd and 3rd grade were all pretty much like that, but we had a different teacher(the one from the middle school) in 4th grade. She was fine, and much nicer than the asshat I'd had for the past couple years, but she didn't really have any sort of free will when it came to this other teacher.

Almost every day of the week, we ended up sitting and watching the 1st graders have gym class. There were two gyms, and nobody was using the other one, but the jerk didn't seem to think it existed. I still have the sneaking suspicion this was all about me.

I also think she had a problem with the kids who weren't athletic, and would cry without much prompting. She'd constantly get really, really mad at me and one other girl, and we'd end up out in the hall because we were getting ""too emotional"".

Another example of how much she hated me, we played this thing called ""grenade dodgeball"" in 5th grade. I don't want to go in depth explaining the rules, but basically, if you get hit with a ball that isn't stopped, you're out.

One kid hit me incredibly hard in the eye with a ball. They were these tiny little plush things, but it was probably going ~20 miles an hour. I still have no clue how he got it going that fast.

I started to cry, because 1. Everything in that eye was very suddenly incredibly blurry, and 2. ow. The teacher noticed that I was crying, asked me what happened, and I asked her to please talk to the kid that hit me in the eye. Her response was, ""No. Do you want to know what would happen if you got hit in the eye with a grenade? You'd die. Your head would be blown off, and you would be dead. Then I wouldn't have to listen to you complaining anymore, because you wouldn't be around to realize you were dead.""

This actually started a crippling fear of death, for me, which only got her to be meaner.

1389,"Toriel: Flute. She's soft and kind, and a flute just feels like it works well with her.

Sans: Trombone. He's shown to canonically play it, and it's a good fit for him anyway, because puns.

Papyrus: Oboe. Mostly because the melody of Nyeh Heh Heh!/Bonetrousle sounds best on an oboe.

Undyne: Piano. She actually plays it. Otherwise, I'd go for something like a trumpet. A trumpet works really well with a fanfare, and she's a warrior.

Alphys: Clarinet. It's a pretty well rounded instrument, a bit like her, and works well with her leitmotif.

Asgore: Bass drum is a pretty good fit. I'd go with a tuba if you want melody capabilities.

Mettaton: Probably a saxophone. It's showy, and usually has solos in jazz pieces.

Napstablook: Bells. Honestly, bells are a little bit too quiet to be heard in a full concert band. Like Blooky!

[Frisk: A xylophone. It's a pretty simple instrument, and works well for the player character.] (#spoiler)

[Chara: Vibraphone. She has a bit more personality than Frisk, but still fits within the same simple template. Vibraphones are a bit deeper and ring out for a bit longer.] (#spoiler)

Everything was blasted with a blinding white light, and Undyne held out her hand before smashing it down to the ground. Sans fell, and she stomped over to his body.

***Nobody can beat me. I thought you knew that!***

Electricity ran through her veins, sparking out from her in a wide ring. She put her hands on either side of Sans' head, and held it up to her face, growling.

***You are nothing. You're a pathetic being who can't learn when to just stop.  And if you are nothing, your death will mean nothing. I'll avenge him, and it'll be slow and painful, Sans. A tribute to him, in the form of torture.***

Undyne tossed him across the room, slamming him into a wall. Energy flared out of her with every step, and Sans cautiously stood up.

She punched him in the jaw, as hard as she could. He collapsed into a heap again, holding a hand to the mark. His jaw was hanging at an angle, fully disconnected from one side.

She kicked him in the stomach, and sent him reeling back into the wall again. Sparks of electricity connected the two, flying from Sans into Undyne. The threads began to get larger, forming into seven threads, each colored. One green, two blue, one light and one dark, a red one, an orange one, one purple, and one yellow.

Sans looked up, trying to hold his jaw in place.

Toriel stood up, and said, **Sans, you are no longer welcome here. Leave now.*

**oh, c'mon, tori. that'd ruin all the fun!*

((Prepare yourself for some Genocide spoilers right about now!))

A blaster appeared in the air next to Sans, and he said, **it's never too late for an apology, though. well, unless you're dead.*

Undyne came in just as the energy from the blaster began arcing towards Toriel. She shoved Toriel out of the way, and took the hit herself.

**well, i'm glad you could join us, undyne.* Sans said. **y o u ' r e   j u s t   i n   t i m e   f o r   t h e   f u n .**

**Not if I can help it, you creep.* Undyne held up a spear, and pointed it towards Sans. There was a loud *splat*, and she watched as part of her hand dripped onto the floor.

**What the...* She dropped the spear, and tried to take a step towards him. A footprint was left behind, and the bottom of her foot was missing.

**heh, looks like i can kill you.*

**I can't... I can't die! I'm a warrior! I... I deserve... more... ha... I'm not... I won't... I won't die today...*

At that moment, Undyne felt something strange. As her body began to dissolve into dust, it reformed into something even more powerful. Her armor, which she'd abandoned back in Waterfall, formed around her body again, and she became taller, and stronger.

***Hahahaha, oh, Sans. You're gonna have to try a little harder than THAT.***

The remainders of her former body sank away into dust, and she stood, spear in hand, in front of Sans. Her eye glowed with a burning blue light, and her eye patch was gone, revealing a deep black pit underneath it.

**You can let them go to Asgore's castle, getting killed or captured by another. THEY will then bring the child's SOUL to Undyne, and THEY will be the hero.*

**Or, you can kill the human yourself. Bring their SOUL to Undyne. She'll shower you in praise, and we will all be freed. And you might even get to join the Royal Guard!*

**Now, which is it going to be?*

**Please, Tori, I feel terrible! I didn't want to kill anyone! I only want you back.* Asgore said. He was on his knees in front of Toriel, crying.

**You are not getting me back.* Toriel said. She turned away from him, and stood at the gates to his castle.

**Why are you here?*

**There is another human child. I protected them, and now I am here until they come. I promised them they would see me here.*

**What if I don't harm them? Will you take me back then?*

**What are you going to do? Keep them down here for eternity, and leave the rest of us trapped, as well? One of you must die. For all of our sakes, I hope it is you.*",2016-03-23 01:25:41+00:00,d19xcox,48.0,t1_d19t1wp,6595.0,SnowdinTownshipRPG

Toriel looked up at the great gate to Asgore's castle. She was awed at the beautiful colors all around her.

She stepped through the gates, and they closed behind her. Asgore stood in front of her, head down.

**You came back.* He said. He looked up, and smiled patiently at Toriel.

**I never thought this day would come. You came back to me, Tori.*

**I did not want to, ASGORE.* Toriel spat, crossing her arms.

**You are a stain on our great people. Do you not understand what you have done?*

**You are both a coward and a murderer. You have kept your people down in the dark while waiting for yet another human to come, and you have killed every human you have come across. Both make me sick.*

**Golly, you're right.* Asgore said. His smile disappeared.

**I don't want to do either. So I wait down here, hoping that another will stumble down here, so I don't ever have to make that choice for myself.*

She stopped, panting in the midmorning sun. She took her helmet off, and threw it off into the forest, where it bounced away in the pure white snow.

Undyne scanned through the forest, and sat down heavily on the ground. She rubbed her head with a gauntleted hand, and sighed.

**I'll kill this little chump, and take their soul to Asgore myself!*

Toriel hugged the child tight, and said, **Do not worry, little one. You must reach Asgore's castle. I promise I will see you there.*

Undyne pointed at Freya, and the spears all fired at her. Toriel set Freya behind her, and let herself be hit with the countless spears.

She vanished in a puff of white light and snow, leaving Undyne, Papyrus, and Freya standing alone.

**Thank you again, Jeremy.**

Mangle turned, and walked up the stairs. She went into the back room, and picked up Saber's katana. She flipped on the lights, and looked at it carefully. It had a finely carved wooden handle, but the grain of the wood was visible through the worn gray paint. The blade had become dull from usage, and the metal itself was coated with grime that couldn't be scraped off.

She ran her hand across the blade, and felt her power well up inside her. She closed her eyes, and released electricity into the blade. The room lit up vibrantly, and Mangle brought the arm holding the katana above her head. She opened her eyes, and saw a ghostly vision of Saber, kneeling in front of her. It looked up, and saw her, electricity ringing her in a halo of light, and struggled to its feet.

*You're even more beautiful than I knew, Mangle.* A tear ran down his cheek, and he sighed. *I guess I'm never really coming back, huh? Sure, my soul's in your nephew Sam, but you can't ruin his life trying to get me back. I guess the positive side is that he'll be me, without all the grudges and aggression.*

*Try to love him as much as you loved me, okay? He's your flesh and blood, although, you don't really have that anymore, do you? Just give him a chance as his own person, not as me. I understand that you want me back, but I doubt that something like my soul, which was really just cobbled together from leftover scraps of energy, can retain any kind of information or memories between lives. When I was reset, it's not like my hard drive was truly blanked. You helped me to restore it. Sam isn't like that. It's a new body, a new brain, and something completely unlike me. He's human. He's more like you than I ever could be. Not that you'd want to date your nephew, but still. Love him like family, okay?*

*I guess I'll be seeing you. Take care of that katana for me, would you? It's important to me. Hey, maybe, with your powers, you could patch it up a bit for me?*

The figure disappeared, and the electricity began to fade. Mangle brought the katana down into both hands, and pushed the full force of her powers out again.

When the tidal wave of power stopped, the lights in the building had one dark, but she could see the katana with the little bit of light produced by her eyes. The handle had been stained black, and warped into a solid metal hunk. The blade was sharp enough to cut through the first layer of her finger when she simply touched it, and shone with the soft, blue light of her eyes.

She flipped it into her hand, and slashed down with it. Sparks flew across the blade, before sinking back into the handle, where the seemed to originate from.

""April 3rd. Why?""

She stood up, and shoved Tobias back against the wall. Her eyes began to glow a soft blue, and she held her hand against his chest. **You're the one that did this, Tobias. Normally, I wouldn't care if you finally found the courage to kill one of the bad people in this world. I'd be glad for you. But this, you killed my husband. You'll pay dearly. It might be tomorrow, it might be years from now, but your death will come by my hand. And trust me, this won't be a painless death. It'll be long, and slow, and you'll feel your memories slipping away as I shock you again, and again, and again, until you're left an empty husk, with only the recollection of all the pain I've put you through. Then, I'll finally kill you, but only when you finally stop begging for death.**

**Every time you remind me of Saber, your doom comes that much closer. And I swear, I won't back out on this. Not this time.**

The thing is, I don't mean this was every once in a while. Every two fucking hours she'd come up to me and talk at me for around 15 minutes about this. This was during class, too. I got in trouble with my teachers(never anything serious, but I had some pretty serious panic attacks when teachers got made at me) quite a few times because she wouldn't shut up.

After about a year and a half of this, I finally realized that she only ever said two things to me. ""Where's [name of the kid she had a crush on]?"" and ""[Insert random obnoxious thing about being gender fluid]"".

That class gets the worst, most evil long-term sub ever to exist, and was pretty much the polar opposite of the normal teacher.

The one bonus of having this guy was that he would not stop talking. That ended up being kind of a blessing and a curse.

The best talk he had was going from the 1930's to the last Russian Tzar in about 30 minutes. He didn't go straight there, either. He skipped all over the map, and talking about his kids in the middle.

After the good teacher finally came back, a bunch of us in his homeroom class told him that this guy, and this is actually what someone said, ""sucks ass"". The teacher didn't even flinch.

A young man, maybe in his mid-twenties, sat at a desk in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. He was tall and lanky with pasty white skin, and a shock of burning orange hair on his head and deep green eyes with just a hint of yellow. He fiddled with the camera system, trying to tune it past the static.

He finally got it to the right frequency, and it revealed a rightly lit Show Stage with a gleaming purple fox with gigantic ears in the center, straddled by a yellow bear with a hook for a hand, along with a golden rabbit to his left, and a baby blue bunny with rosy cheeks to the right.

Tuning it to the next camera, out in the Game Area, he saw a white and pink fox, smiling gently to the screen. He could see into the Kids' Cove as well, showing the fox's mangled twin and a small red fox, standing on all four legs.

The Prize Corner contained a massive box, which held a black and white Puppet. A smaller jester sat on top of the box, legs softly blowing in the wind.

Then, in the back room, there was another golden bear, the same color as the rabbit. It sat against the wall, eyes shining like day. There was a tiger, with long, sharp fangs and dead eyes, with a sword strapped to its hip.

The man smoothed back his hair, and gently picked up the brown bear head next to him on his desk. His shift would be starting soon.",2016-02-28 18:51:19+00:00,d0h450l,14.0,t1_d0h2l89,2476.0,roleplaysfamilydiner

Everything was black. Black with a hint of blue, but still black. A small, blue dot highlighted the heavens, providing just enough light to turn a small portion of the sky above him soft blue.

It smelled of death and decay. Saber looked down to his own hands, and the small amount of light showed them rusting away as he stared, wrapped in the horror show before him.

He fell to his knees, which emitted a flurry of rust under the sudden pressure. His torso did the same.

He lay on the ground, unable to turn his head to look to the stars.

1983,"The next time Tobias raised his arms, Saber grasped at the floor. The handful of pixels he held stayed attacked to the ground, and he fell again as Fredbear's influence shot towards the ceiling.

Saber stood up, and closed his eyes. He reached inside of himself, and felt the part of Fredbear that was still there. A small, dark patch inside of him. He focused on it, and felt it expand, slowly beginning to eclipse the good in his body. He would do everything to keep his friends safe, even if it meant destroying his mind in the process.

When he opened his eyes, they were dark. He held out his left hand, and the pixels bent to his will, forming a blue sword in his hand. It sparked with dark energy, though it was more like an anti-spark. The flickers were the forces of darkness pulling the light and energy from the air, and fueling Saber's rage and Fredbear created powers.

*Two can play at this game, Fredbear,* Saber said. His voice became more mechanical, sounding like the original animatronics. Record scratching sounds accompanied his speaking. *You forgot one thing. I feed of the energy of other souls. You sheltered inside my body, and I fed off your energy. Your anti-energy. It helped to build your cavern, but left some of your powers in me.*

Saber reached out to touch one, and it disintegrated into nothingness when he made contact with it. The little yellow flakes scattered into the blue depths below.

It felt as if he was standing on nothing, but when he took a step forward, the nothingness held beneath his feet. He lightly cupped one of the large, pink pixels in his hands, and it too vanished once it contacted him. This time, he held the remainder of the pixel in his hands.

2238,"So, back in Middle School, one of my friends was always being amazingly inappropriate and generally answering questions with stupid things. My science teacher eventually stopped calling on him, because, and I think this is right, he answered ""What are alleles"" with ""What's a leele?"".

Anyway, just after Winter break(huh, happens to be around this time), he raised his hand to talk about what he did over break.

He told the story pretty well, and it pretty much went like this:

""So, one day after a swim meet, we went to Applebee's because we lost. I decided to order ribs. I waited an hour. Than another half an hour. Then my ribs finally showed up. I was really hard by that time... wait, no, I was really *hungry*. I meant hungry!""

By the time he finished his last sentence, the entire class was laughing. The science teacher just sort of glared at him until the class quieted down, and said, ""We will never speak of this again.""

The class just kept on going, but it's become a recurring joke between him and the rest of my friends.",2016-01-06 00:56:30+00:00,cynh9di,1.0,t3_3zkang,38687.0,AskReddit

I'm /u/White_Lupin! I figure I'll give you a nice little introduction to the sub, just to... *cough cough*... help you get settled in on your first night.

Let's start with something basic: Mods. Honestly, the mods here are awesome, -popgoes being the best of the best. Fantasma doesn't really help mod, as far as I can tell. Base... it's best not to talk about him. Invaderzz, he's pretty nice, too, but he's kinda new, so it's hard to get a solid opinion.

Artists: There are a few awesome artists on this sub, but the one who posts the most often is LadyFiszi. She does awesome, realistic drawings that usually depict the Purple Guy. [This] (http://ladyfiszi.deviantart.com/) is her DeviantArt page. If you want to go the other way, there's negaduck9, who makes a comic series called Springaling. [This] (http://negaduck9.deviantart.com/art/Springaling-1-Pizza-533917793) is the first one, if you want to read it.

Otherwise well known users: NomNomNomNation, GameboyJr, and GamerBrony13 are probably the people who you'll notice get tons of upvotes on a regular basis. Some other people, like squidnow_amiibo, LivingTooBeDead, and I, people know, but don't tend to go on an upvote rampage about. You'll probably figure out who people like soon enough.

Trolls: Ignore them. It hurts you more than it hurts them.

Fangames: If you happen to be making a fangame, you can post stuff here or at /r/fivenightsatfangames. FNaFG doesn't really get much attention, though.

Alright, I think I've covered a lot of stuff. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask pretty much anyone, although I'm always happy to answer!",2015-12-23 16:47:27+00:00,cy92jhq,1.0,t3_3xz03c,4277.0,fivenightsatfreddys

His wife had left him, his dog had died, and now he was facing vehicular manslaughter charges after that guy jumped in front of his car.

It just wasn't worth it.

Mike took one more breath, and jumped.

""No.""

Mike, it's either jumping or getting stabbed. You've gotta trust me here.

""No!""

Mike, just jump, for Christ's sake.

""Yeah, no.""

Yes.

""No.""

The man with a knife took two steps toward Mike.

""I'm still not moving.""

The man with a knife stabbed Mike, and, as he was falling to the ground, he looked over the cliff, only to see a large expanse of flat rock three feet down that would have saved him.

2483,"As I stepped out of the subway, and back above ground, I looked up to the One World Trade Center. It was massive, even more so than I'd seen on the TV. While I was here, I just had to be careful. I was going to be close to the building for a while.

I considered buying earplugs, but didn't have enough time. A fellow tourist looked up at the building, and said, ""Y'know, except for the bombings and stuff, 2001 one was a pretty good year.""

""No, please, say it wasn't,"" I begged, turning to them and putting my hands together. I had only five seconds before it would happen.

""It was. I graduated in 2001.""

""Why did it have to be now?"" I said. In the middle of my sentence, the scenery around me changed dramatically. Smoke billowed through the air, obscuring everything. This had happened before. The second tower was about to go down. The only thing was, last time I'd heard it, I'd been in the safety of my hometown in Nebraska, far away from where this was all happening.

I heard a booming sound, and a shred of light pierced through the cloud of smoke. The second plane had just crashed, tearing down the South Tower.

Metal scraped against metal, and helped the smoke to give that day an eerie feel.

""Come on, only four more minutes,"" I said to myself. I began to cough, and knew that I should get out of the smoke. But, I couldn't tear away from what was happening. I was stuck on the spot that I had been transported to.

Somebody rushed passed me, and the smoke rippled. I turned my head to watch them run past, and they slowed down, realizing that they'd just run past somebody.

The woman came back to me, holding her shirt over her mouth and nose, trying to filter out the smoke.

""You've got to get out of here. Why are you just standing there? Don't you know what's happening?""

""I do, but I'll be gone soon enough. Don't worry about me, worry about yourself.""

""Please, just come with me. If you want to kill yourself, don't do it from smoke inhalation. That seems like a bad way to go.""

I began to realize who I was talking to. My wife... she'd been in the South Tower, on the day it went down. She'd always talked about how a man who looked just like me refused to come with her, out of the smoke. I'd though nothing of it, but then, I discovered my powers.

""I promise you, I'm not trying to kill myself. Just trust me. Go on and get yourself out of here. In three minutes, It'll be like I was never even here.""

""I guess you won't listen to me. I'll have to drag you out.""

""I can handle myself. Just go.""

She sighed, and a tear rolled out of her eye, presumably from all the smoke. It got into your eyes, and coated your lips. Ash began to drift through the air. The South Tower had gone up in flames, and every wooden thing in the building had turned to nothing more than piles of ash.

""If I tell you about your future, will you go?""

""How would you know anything about my future?""

""You have to trust me."" I took a deep breath, and began, ""You're mother's been pestering you about picking a college for a while now. You'll pick the University of Minnesota. A man, just out of high school and two years younger than you from Nebraska will go there too. You're going to meet him in a basic math class, where the woman sitting between you will never show up.

""You'll fall in love with him, and he with you. He'll even convince you to stop dying your hair. But, after a few dates, you'll begin to think that he's not right for you. On your 7th date, you'll break up with him.

""Two days later, heart-broken and terrified, he'll go to a bridge over the Mississippi and stand there for 30 minutes.

""At the last second, you'll walk by. He'll just be sitting there, tears in his eyes. Just before he pushes himself over the edge, you'll realize that you made a mistake. You'll convince him to come back, and kiss him, under the full moon in Minneapolis.

""On July 3rd, 2007, you'll get married. It will be a beautiful marriage, in the Como Zoo Conservatory. On your wedding night, just after you kiss, you'll tell him that, on the day the Twin Towers fell, a man just like him told you about the future. You'll tell him everything I just told you, and, at first, he won't believe you.

""He'll come home after a trip for work to New York in 2015, and he'll tell you that he finally believes you. He'll say, ""Honey, I'm so sorry for doubting you"".

""And then, I can't tell you anything else. I don't know what happens after 2015, but I can tell you that your life is going to be amazing.""

With only 30 seconds left, she said, ""Thank you. I don't know if I believe you, but I guess we'll see.""

She vanished into the smoke and ash, and I smiled. I would be on a plane back to St. Paul in just two days, and I would tell her that I was stupid for not believing her. I would tell her about my powers, and I would take her out. Maybe to the place where I first proposed to her.

And then, the sirens vanished. The guy who told me that 2001 had been a great year slapped me, and I raised my hand to my cheek.

""Are you okay? Sorry I had to slap you. You weren't responding.""

""Yeah, I'm just fine. I just zoned out for a little while.""

""Alright. I hope you're okay.""

The man walked off, and I looked up the the World Trade Center. It was a magnificent replacement for the Twin Towers, but they'd always hold a special place in my heart.

Fredbear's gets shut down, and Fazbear's first day or so goes perfectly fine, then, we hear about the events that take place during FNaF 2 from the phone calls.

2606,"Well, if we're going on if Golden Freddy is a springlock, I would have to say no. I agree with lots of the people there on the fact that he only has four fingers and no joints in his fingers.

On the other hand, his wear-and-tear is more prominent than those of the other Withered's. That might be some evidence towards the springlock theory, as those suits would probably get torn up pretty fast from people moving around in them all the time. Kids poking at it, and it getting stuck on the animatronic parts inside, seeing as it's a cloth suit, would ruin anything.

Also, we can attribute the four-fingered design as an oversight on Scott's part. After all, Springtrap wasn't in that game, so we can't judge based on if Springtrap had four or five fingers in that game.

I guess I've changed my decision. I'm sort of in the middle of that topic.",2015-12-01 22:54:20+00:00,cxjow80,1.0,t3_3v21k7,3477.0,fnafandshit

2797,"The last bus home. I didn't know it, at the time. I didn't know that it would be the last bus ever to come to the door of my apartment building.

The seats of the bus were soft, and a jade green color. There were tears in almost all the seats, but I managed to find the one empty seat that was still pristine. The carpeted flooring was the same color as the seats, and so was the wallpaper, and the outside of the bus. I silently sat across the row from the old woman in an apartment just a few down from mine.

The ride home was pleasant, but I didn't think much of it. It was the same as every other bus ride I had taken to my complex. It wasn't better, it was just the same.

I stepped out onto the front steps of my building, and helped the old woman off the bus. She muttered, ""Thanks,"" and slowly shuffled inside. She wouldn't let me hold the door.

I followed her in, and went up to my apartment. The television was still on, and the 9 o'clock news was playing softly in the background as I put my leftovers in the fridge.

I sat down in my one armchair, and turned the television up. The people on the news were talking about earthquakes in... Minnesota? There had never been an earthquake there before. There were reports of natural disasters happening all over the globe.

The warning came on the television, then, telling that there was an earthquake about to hit Madison, Wisconsin. I got out of my building as fast as I could, and stepped out of the front door just as the ground began to tremble.

Saber's eyes widened as he looked at Fredbear. He was incredibly damaged, and he was clearly missing some of his endoskeleton, but his eyes still glowed.

*You, of all people.* Saber said, standing up from Mangle. *I can only assume that you know we're in a simulation?*

~ ~ ~

~ ~ ~

((Note: This skips outside, then back to the simulation, but in a different place. In this case, it goes from Saber and Mangle to Jeremy.))

Jeremy locked up his bike on the rack as the last car left the parking lot. He waved at the car, and a little kid with a Toy Bonnie plush waved back. Jeremy smiled, thinking about how much Jackson had liked Toy Bonnie. It was heart-breaking, but he could focus on the happy things. It wasn't hard to do when he worked at... at least he could think about how happy they were here before... Well, he couldn't dwell on that. It was time for his job, after all.

Jeremy grabbed his keys and unlocked the door to the pizzeria. It still smelled like breadsticks, but with a hint of something else.

Blood.

Jeremy had learned to ignore the scent coming from the animatronics. He'd already mentioned it to the manager, and he'd said that, if Jeremy mentioned it again, that he would be fired. Jeremy just pretended like there wasn't anything wrong with the fact that the entire place smelled of blood.

There were sounds from down by the office. Jeremy put his keys in his pocket, trying his best to stay quiet. He glanced at the Toys, and saw that they were all watching him. He shook it off, knowing that he could fight them off if he needed too.

Jeremy leaned around the corner, and saw that there were already animatronics in the office.

""Shit."" He muttered, looking around for something sharp. He'd go for the unknown one first. The tiger.

He went over to the Toys, and patted Toy Bonnie on the shoulder, putting another hand on the guitar.

""Sorry about this."" Jeremy said, wrenching the guitar out of the animatronic's hands. Only the neck of the guitar came, and there was a very sharp metal piece on the broken end.

Jeremy stepped off the stage, and said, ""Sorry, guys. I... I can hope you're in there, right? Well, Jackson, hope you're happy.""

Jeremy stepped into the hallway, and began to slowly walk towards the office, holding the broken guitar piece.

""Hey!"" He yelled. The tiger turned around. Jeremy took a deep breath, ran at the animatronic, holding the guitar piece up. He stabbed the tiger in the chest, and sparks flew.

*Dude!* The animatronic yelled.

""What the heck?"" Jeremy said, letting go of the weapon and stumbling backwards.

*Seriously!* The tiger said, pulling the guitar out of his chest. *That was uncalled for.*",2015-10-18 15:37:40+00:00,cw4147q,46.0,t1_cw409rf,1536.0,roleplaysfamilydiner

So, do you know Five Nights at Freddy's? Hopefully, but, otherwise, here's a [basic explanation from Wikipedia.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s)

In the games, there are five children who have been killed at the pizzeria. They (supposedly) possessed the different animatronics, although that's not important to your question.

The guy who killed them, who was seen in FNaF 2, 3, and 4, killed the children. He's otherwise known as the 'Purple Guy'.

*Thanks, Lara. I'll send the database your way.*

Saber closed his eyes, and a cable appeared in his hands. He plugged one end into the terminal, and the other into his charging port. He looked through the small amount of files that he had left after his reset, and found the massive folder with the database in it.

*Sending it your way now, Lara.* Saber typed in. The instructions for fixing up Mangle appeared in his files, and saw that the database had gone through.

**Saber!** Mangle whined.

*Shut the fuck up, Mangle!**

*Mangle, you are pulling my last cable. I am so close to just putting you out of your misery now. So shut the* fuck *up before I satisfy my need to murder shit.*

Mangle struggled up, and rose to her full height, which might have been about six feet to Saber's eight.

**Y-Y-You can't order me around li-i-ike thi-is! Y-Y-You are supposed to respect every-y-ybody-y! Why-y-y can't y-you just be ni-ice to people!**

Saber turned to face Mangle, and said, *Because I don't* like *people. I like people less than I like people that have become animatronics! Why can't you just shut your mouth and continue to whine in the corner.*

**No! I-I refuse to li-i-isten to y-you!**

Saber unsheathed his claws and picked up the katana that he'd rested against the desk.

*You want to fight, I'll fight. Just know that you'll be mangled even more afterwards.*

Mangle lunged at Saber, opening her mouth. Saber stuck his fist down her throat, and Mangle whined. He took his other hand and put it on her upper jaw, then slid his first hand out and put it on her lower jaw.

*I could snap your jaw off, just like this. Do you want that? Now tell me that you'll stop or I'll do it.*

**But y-you sai-i-i-id-**

*WE'RE OVER THAT SHIT!* Saber shouted. He growled, loudly, in the back of his throat. *YOU, YOU ARE THE ONLY REASON THAT I* CAN *BE SO MAD AT YOU! YOU* NEED *TO FUCK OFF!*

Saber plugged the cord into Mangle's charging port, then said, *If this happened to Mangle, couldn't it have happened to Jeremy and Jackson?*

*Check on them for me. I hope I'll be back soon.* Saber took a deep breath, held Mangle's hand tighter, and plugged the cord into his port.

~ ~ ~

The room was dark. Saber wasn't even sure it was a room. There was a very low ceiling, and it sounded kind of woody when he tapped it.

Saber turned over onto his stomach and looked around. There was a sliver of light up ahead, and he began to shuffle towards it.

Saber tapped the board above the light with one of his claws, and found it very soft. He dug his claws into the wood and pulled down, yanking the wood out of its place.

He hauled himself out of the opening, and saw Jackson, along with two of the other Toy models standing above him.

*Mangle!* Saber yelled.

There was scraping and clunking from the other room, and Saber ran over.

*Mangle! Mangle, I'm so sorry.*

Mangle was back to her original state. The way Saber had found her in Fazbear's Fright.

Jeremy silently stared into the mirror in his bedroom, holding back his tears. It had been just over two weeks since Jackson and Katy had died at Freddy Fazbear's.

The pizzeria hadn't shut down, for some reason. Jeremy was incredibly angry when he first heard that. The place had only opened a week before Jackson and Katy's death, and they wanted to keep it open as long as possible.

So, Jeremy had taken a summer job. He was only 15, but they'd given him the job anyway.

*Mangle, you are the best thing that's ever happened to me. I hope I never lose you again. And... I hope that you never lose me.

I promise you, that will never happen again.*

*Mangle, there is nothing that will come between us again. I can't promise much, but I can promise that only death will bring us apart.*

That would be nice, wouldn't it? Two long-time friends helping each other through similar experiences.

Gosh, it's really been a long time, hasn't it?

You've been my best friend through all of this, Tobias. And I hope to God that you come back at some point.

If you don't, I'll have Mangle and Springtrap tell me stories about how much of a good friend you were to me.

I'll see you in the next life, buddy.

Now, I don't know if what I've been saying is just my thoughts, or if I'm actually saying all of this. If I am, I have one request.

Give me one moment of silence, once I'm gone. It doesn't have to be a long moment. Just a few seconds for the old me.

Jeremy, Springtrap, have you got anything to say? Maybe FredHybrid ((/u/HorderLock)), or the Devil ((/u/Agrael9996))? I've met so many people.

""Saber, I'm sorry to see you go,"" Jeremy said, ""I'll help build you back up."" Jeremy chuckled.

""The weirdest thing is that you may have been my best friend, and you were never human.""

""You were always so nice. I'm amazed how much I was drawn to you.""

""Even before you woke up, when we found you, I felt like you were going to be the best of the bunch.""

""I think I was right.""

""I'm gonna miss you. But I'll be right here beside you when you wake up.""

((Hey, chaosdelivered, are you going to be coming back next summer? Maybe over Winter break, too. I'll see you then.

Thank god.

I'm getting reset.

I can escape my fucking programming.

I always hated the way they'd made me. I never wanted to be so happy, all the time.

Once they told me to kill people, that was when I got to show my true colors.

Not like people liked the real me. But, hey. If I'm happy, they should be happy.

It's been an interesting ride, hasn't it?

I myself have never really been here. The time that I was the most represented was when the Puppet took control. I could make requests, at least.

First, I was bound by my programming.

Second, I was only there when it was time to find prey.

Third, I was being controlled by a malevolent force of evil. At least he let me do most of the work, huh?

Finally, it was my damn programming again.

Jeremy signed the papers that the delivery guy held out, and took the crate off of his hands.

""I guess. I need to go and talk to Saber, once I figure out how to get back to myself. I'm going to the back room. See you later.""

Katy left the room, leaving Jeremy alone with the crate. He found a crow bar and pried the crate open, smiling at the Bonnie character. Even though it was missing its face and arm, it was still beautiful.

Mangle was back, and she was going to show it.

Katy ripped out of the bindings around her wrists, and slipped out of the ones around her ankles, getting to her feet.

Katy took the bandage off of her side, where Saber's cut had entirely healed. Unlimited power could be good for some things.

Katy held up her arms, and the hospital gown morphed into a bright white suit jacket, and her brown hair changed back into its shocking white color. Its proper color. Her silver eyes began to glow a bright blue, and she walked out of the door. The doctors could solve that mystery later. For now, she was going back to Fazbear's Fright. 

Katy almost agreed with Jackson, now. Maybe she was better off *dead*.

Yes, she was better off dead. She was Mangle, damnit.

Katy walked out of the hospital doors and pulled a smartphone out of her pocket, finding directions to Fazbear's Fright as she tied her hair back. Today was a wonderful day.

~~~

When Katy arrived at Fazbear's Fright, after taking the Light Rail, she looked up at the building with glee. She could see Saber, standing perfectly still in the gaping hole in the front wall. There was rubble laying in the grass in front of the building, and Katy walked over to pick a hunk up.

The concrete was warm from laying out in the sun all day. It had a few shards of black and white checkered wallpaper left on one side, and was quite heavy.

Katy set the piece of concrete back on the pile, and went inside the building.

Jeremy was sitting at the front desk, doing paperwork. Katy walked up to the desk and put her hands down, leaning forward.

""Hello, Jeremy,"" Katy said. Jeremy fell off of his chair, and looked up at Katy.

""No, no no no,"" Jeremy muttered, looking shocked.

""What's wrong? I only died and came back to life."" Katy laughed, and looked at Jeremy's face.

""Seriously, what's wrong?"" Katy asked.

""You, you were dead. So was Jackson.""

""Yeah, we realized that.""

""This is messed up.""

""Why?""

""I had gotten over my little siblings being dead. I had gotten over the guilt. Why do I have to be imagining this now?"" Jeremy stood up and walked over to Katy's side of the desk.

""Jeremy, I'm real! I'm the reason this place hasn't been driven into the ground, several times!""

Saber woke up, and saw that all the damage had been repaired. Mangle's doing, of course.

Saber rose to his feet, and looked around. Tobias was slumped against one wall, and the others, FredHybrid an Springtrap, were plugged in along another. Mangle was nowhere to be found.

*Mangle?* Saber yelled, going over to plug in Tobias.

*You'll be alright, bud.* Saber whispered to Tobias. *I'm really sorry for what we, Mangle, I mean, had to do. I'll get you fixed up soon.*",2015-09-21 23:29:24+00:00,cv9la44,3.0,t1_cv8t13w,58594.0,roleplaysfamilydiner

3326,"Katy looked up at the white walls of the hospital, awed. She'd never had a reason to go to a hospital. After all, she'd never broken any bones in the three years that she'd lived.

""Jackson?"" She called, wondering why her brother was nowhere to be found. Her mother and father weren't anywhere, either.

Katy tried to sit up, but felt binding around her wrists and ankles, holding her to the hospital bed. She struggled to break the hold, but couldn't manage it.

Flashes of a battle. Her favorite animatronic, the Puppet, she was there.

""No, silly!"" Katy said to herself, laughing, ""That's just your imagination!""

More, more, a tiger, a purple fox, a yellow bunny, all wrecked.

Katy tried to cover her eyes, but the bindings held her back.

A heavy silence fell over Fazbear’s Fright. The building had been thoroughly destroyed, and all the animatronics had been damaged or destroyed.

It almost wasn’t worth it. Katy was the only one left, standing over the wreckage of the building, bleeding from her nose, her hands, and her side, with severe burns everywhere else. She was too weak to transform back into an animatronic.

It hurt so much. Tears streamed down her face, falling to the ground.

It almost wasn’t worth it.

Sirens sounded from the front of the building. Katy limped over to see several police cars, a fire truck, and an ambulance out front.

This had happened before, but it hadn’t been this bad. If she couldn’t make the transformation, they’d take her to a hospital.

It would almost be worth it.

The fire on the lower level exploded out towards the emergency crews, throwing two policemen backwards across the pavement.

Katy would only be able to do a few things before she passed out. Maybe…

She waved her hand over the fire, putting it out. So many things would be destroyed, but that was for another time. She turned to the wrecked walls and floor, and lifted her arms, using her last fraction of energy, and raised most of the walls back up.

That was enough. There was no way she could make the transformation back, now.

She would let them take her.

""You, you're powered by electricity. I don't recall you charging up since last night."" Katy said to Tobias, who was struggling to get out of Katy's grip.

Katy looked over to Saber, and sent a white beam of light at him.

*Oh god, what have I done?*

""Saber, I need you."" Katy called.

Saber ran over, and Katy pointed to Tobias, who she was now holding up by his neck.

""You can suck the power out of him, right?""

*Yeah, but it will cause an overload.*

""Do it.""

Saber listened, and put his hand up against Tobias' chest, initiating a power transfer.

As the last of Tobias' power was drained, both he and Saber collapsed, Tobias from lack of power, Saber from blowing out his transformer. It would get fixed after just a little while.

Katy looked around, and didn't see Springtrap or the Puppet anywhere.",2015-09-20 15:57:06+00:00,cv7ybrq,61.0,t1_cv7xyt1,659.0,roleplaysfamilydiner

As Tobias reached her, she dodged out of his way and shifted the electricity to one hand, holding the other hand out towards him.

She grabbed Tobias and threw him up in the air, where he smashed against some of the last remaining roof and hit the floor again.

Katy felt a cold blade in her side, and turned to see Saber, holding the katana. It was buried in-between her ribs, and she yanked it out with her hands.

""You."" Katy growled.

Saber hit Katy in the face, and she hit him with the lightning shaft. Saber flew back into the mist, where he crashed against the wall.

Katy's nose began to bleed, and she turned back to Tobias, who was getting up off the floor.

She smashed the rod against the floor, and electricity traveled throughout it, starting a fire on the lower level, but sending Tobias smashing back into a wall.",2015-09-20 15:30:19+00:00,cv7xgs3,59.0,t1_cv7x8vy,474.0,roleplaysfamilydiner

3332,"Katy took a deep breath as smoke came up over her head. She might be able to hold her breath for quite a while, but not long enough. The smoke would seep into her lungs, and she would die. Hopefully Saber would come back. She had tried. If she died now, but Saber had come back to life, he could find a way to bring her back. He was truly magical. If only she hadn't said that. Then, maybe he'd still care for her. Maybe he would still be her friend.

Katy's vision began to fade, and she knew her time was short. Only a few seconds. 10... 9...

Katy waited, silently. Saber...

8... 7...

He was the only one who could save her.

6... 5...

Not much time. Was this really the end?

4... 3...

No, it couldn't be. With her last seconds, Katy began to summon all of her power. Maybe she could truly destroy Mangle. She knew that she would die inside, but at least it wouldn't really be her.

2...

Katy kept all the energy she was summoning within just a few inches of her. All of that electricity, maybe it could do it.

1...

It was too much. The energy exploded out, destroying the top floor, and blowing the smoke around her out.

Katy took a deep breath, and her skin began to lose the purple color that it had been gaining.

Katy dropped down to the ground, letting Tobias have the high ground. It wouldn't matter. She was more powerful than he'd ever be.

Tobias sent a sphere of dark energy at Katy, and she deflected it with a wave of her hand, sending it crashing into a wall.

Mangle looked over to where Saber had been, now incased in smoke.

""Rise for me."" She muttered, holding her hand out towards the smoke.

A spark of electricity shot out towards the smoke, and Katy turned back to Tobias, who was preparing another shot.

*If you can still hear me, Tobias, I'm so sorry. I will repair you afterwards.* Saber said, fighting off the phantom figures that came at him from all directions. He would soon be overcome, leaving only Mangle and Springtrap to fight Tobias.

Saber ran over towards Mangle, but stepped back when a blinding white light started emitting from her.

There was a sharp explosion that sent out towards the Puppet, smacking him against a wall, which crumbled as he hit it.

Mangle stood up, once again in her human form.

""You don't know what you're up against."" Katy(Mangle) said, directing her voice at the Puppet.

It's quite long, but we can do a quick summary for you. The character that you *do not want to bring* is the Puppet. The Puppet is the main antagonist over there, but any OCs or standard characters will work.

Here's a list of characters, just so you know which characters to keep out of that rp.

Saber: OC. Played by White_Lupin

Tobias: OC. Played by chaosdelivered.

FredHybrid: OC. Played by HorderLock

The Music Devil: OC. Played by Agrael9996.

Mangle: FNaF 2 Character. Played by White_Lupin

Springtrap: FNaF 3 Character. Played by AlexIsAnAI.

The Puppet: FNaF 2 Character and main antagonist. Played by AlexIsAnAI.

I think I've got all the important characters on the list. If you want to jump in, go ahead and reply and I'll give you sort of a basic summary. It might be best to come in after the battle with the Puppet, which is going on right now, or you can hop right in and try to help with the fight.

*Y'know, I like to think that everyone's special. The boss in video games always updates their attack. You defeat them once, then, in the next game, they come back with something bigger and better to attack you with. You, on the other hand, you're just doing the same things. Nothing new, nothing special. Although, in other aspects, you're like a video game boss. You attack in stages that you have to defeat individually. First with the smoke creatures, then you're going to try and shut us all down.

A little while later, Erica successfully made it through the entire course.

*Sounds good.* Saber took some of the blood packets out of the desk, and tossed them at Jeremy.

As Jeremy punctured the blood packets, Saber took another packet out from the desk and got it on his hands and his mouth.

There were running footsteps from the hallway, and heavy, mechanical ones following them. The two girls and Perry.

Saber walked up to the door to the office, and growled as the two girls came around the corner.

Anna looked into the office, shrieked, and ran back towards Perry, where he caught her with his hook. She ran back towards Erica, and said, ""Oh my god oh my god oh my god! What the hell are we doing! I didn't think that it would be this scary!""

""So, when does the running start?"" Anna asked.

""Oh, soon enough. It's all about the build-up."" Jeremy responded.

The girls moved on, and Mangle grabbed Jeremy, tugging him down into the trap door, where Jeremy quickly triggered the blockade.

The three girls stopped at the blockade, and Anna started freaking out.

After about 20 minutes, a group of teenage girls came in.

""Hello! Welcome to Fazbear's Fright."" Jeremy said. He'd gotten all the blood cleaned off of him, and wrote up a summary of what the experience would entail. Running, possible injuries, and what to do if you were captured by an animatronic, which was play along with the experience. Not cool to ruin the whole thing for your friends by not being dead. You would also stay in the spot that you were dropped until everyone was called back using the PA system.

There were three girls, and the tallest one said, ""Hi. We saw an ad for this on Facebook from Katy's guitar instructor Stanley. We wanted to come in and see what all the fuss was about.""

""Yeah, sure. So, I'm Jeremy, the night guard here at Fazbear's Fright. If you'd like to take a tour of the building, it will be 20 dollars for each of you. You can pay after the tour, if you'd like.

""We came prepared with 60 bucks and tennis shoes. We're all ready to go.""

""Okay, but you do have to read through and sign these waivers.""

Jeremy fished out three of the waivers, and waited while the girls signed them.

""Sorry, we haven't said our names yet."" The taller girl said, handing in her waiver. ""I'm Erica. This is Katy."" Erica pointed to the shorter redhead. ""And this is Anna."" Erica pointed to the last girl. Anna waved, and went back to reading the form.

Once all the girls were done, Jeremy took the waivers and set them on the desk.

3583,"FNaF uses alternate universes.

There are quite clearly two different options for who the FNaF 4 kid becomes. The Puppet of Golden Freddy. He can be both.

FNaF 2 has the FNaF 4 kid becoming Golden Freddy. The others are the timeline, where, most likely, he becomes the Puppet. FNaF 1 is really quite ambiguous, along with FNaF 3. We have one definite game for each opinion.

FNaF 1: (Purple man character)/(Purple man killed/in jail)/(FNaF 4 kid)

FNaF 2:(Purple man character)/(Purple man killed/in jail)/Golden Freddy

FNaF 3:(Purple man character)/(Purple man killed/in jail)/(FNaF 4 kid)

FNaF 4:(Purple man character)/(Purple man killed/in jail)/The Puppet

Now we want to talk about the Purple Man. FNaF 1 states that he was put in jail after he was caught on the security cameras. FNaF 2 and FNaF 4 don't have any mention of what happened to the Purple Man, so we can update FNaF 1 and 3.

FNaF 1:(Purple man character)/Purple man is in jail/(FNaF 4 kid)

FNaF 2:(Purple man character)/(Purple man killed/in jail)/Golden Freddy

FNaF 3: (Purple man character)/Purple man is killed/(FNaF 4 kid)

Saber lunged at the mass of parts, and grabbed onto what he thought was its neck. He climbed up it and got onto its back, which was a piece of endoskeleton parallel to the ground.

He tugged at its head, and it began to give way at the neck. All the while, the thing was writhing in Saber's grip.

Saber laughed, still pushing at the head.

We now move on to a minigame from FNaF 2, where Carl takes his first victim. This minigame very clearly takes place in Fredbear's, and thus is Carl's first kill. I'm not quite sure if this takes place before or after the events of FNaF 4, but we're going to say that it's after for the purposes of this timeline.

We then move on to a pre-FNaF 2 location, which is shown in Foxy's minigame. Carl takes five more victims. We think that four of these possess Foxy, Chica, Freddy, and Bonnie. But, what about the fifth one? I'll get to that in a little bit.

Now, the Foxy minigame location has closed down within about two months. The new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, the FNaF 2 location, has just opened. The animatronics are tampered with, presumably by Carl, and they go rouge. The Toys are de-comissioned, and the four older mascots, which were destroyed, again, presumably by Carl, get repaired.

The events of FNaF 1 then take place, where long-time employee ""Phone Guy"" is killed. At sometime during this game, Carl is also killed within the old Spring Bonnie costume.

30 years later, fans of the pizzeria find the Spring Bonnie costume and add it to their haunted house. Sadly, the didn't know why the costume was in the backroom, and ""Phone Dude"" may have been killed by Carl, who is now dead inside Spring Bonnie.

The nightguard, Nam Eless, burns Fazbear's Fright to the ground, hoping to fully take out Carl. Sadly, this doesn't work, and he escapes the wrath of the flames.

So, this is all we know at this point. I'm probably leaving some stuff out, but I'm not sure.

Anyway, I promised I'd elaborate on that fifth child.

What if Carl only killed four children that last time? Might the other one have gone searching for his friends, got lost, and died by the hands of a ruthless animatronic? He wouldn't be trapped within the confines of a suit. The bodies certainly aren't actually present in the Foxy minigame, as they were stuffed in the suits. This leaves us with six murdered children and one bitten one. We have enough children to take control of Golden Freddy, who was the bitten child, the Marionette, who was the first kill, and the four main animatronics, who are shown dead in the Foxy minigame.

Hope this helps.",2015-08-25 01:27:34+00:00,cuel89n,1.0,t3_3i9gti,8635.0,fivenightsatfreddys

3791,"You... you took my idea.

I actually set up a dice game to play with my friends when FNaF 2 came out. 

My rules go like this, though:

You start w/ 18 rounds on the clock, and the animatronics start.

Bonnie and Chica can move on the 1st night w/ rolls of 4&lt;. Foxy can move when there are 5 rounds left on the clock. It takes him a 6 on a D6, and a 15 on a D20 if the cameras have been checked. If the cameras aren't checked, then you only need a 5 on the D20.

If the cameras are left un-checked for 3 rounds, Foxy's # on the D6 will drop by 1 # per turn after the three rounds. Once the nightguard begins to check the cameras again, the # will rise by 1 per check.

In order to activate G. Freddy, roll a D20. On a roll of 20, G. Freddy will appear the next time the cameras are checked.

After the animatronic player is done, the nightguard takes off 1 + (1 x animatronics that moved) power. The power starts at 99. The round counter does not move yet.

The nightguard rolls 3 dice, and can use them for different things. The cameras can be acticated on a 3&lt;, and the doors can be closed on 4&lt;. If an animatronic is in the doorway, and the nightguard has checked the cameras, then only a 2&lt; is needed to close a door.

Closing a door and using the cameras takes 2 power.

If G. Freddy gets into the room, or FOxy is running down the hallway, it takes a 12 on a D20 to keep them out.

If the nightguard runs out of power, the animatronic player rolls a D100, /2, and adds what hour the player got to(In seconds), and another 6.

42 seconds is 1 round, and the power outage scenario(The number the animatronic player just rolled) Must last until 6 A.M.

Every night, the D6 # goes down by 1.

On N3, Freddy activates. It takes a 6 on a D6 to move him, + 15 on a D20 if the cameras were looked at, or a 5 on a D20 if the cameras were not checked.

Past N4, Bonnie can also teleport, but he has to go the corner before he goes to the doorway.",2015-08-16 13:38:25+00:00,cu4tiga,1.0,t3_3h5bai,50554.0,fivenightsatfreddys

3795,"""What are you doing, Jake?"" I glared at my friend as he began to tap all the buttons on the elevator.

""I'm just having some fun,"" Jake responded, ""You should learn how to, Alicia.""

""Just because you want to take forever to get to the parking garage doesn't mean you get to ruin my day.""

""It's not going to ruin your day. Calm the frack down.""

I sighed, and Jake continued to press buttons.

""Code accepted.""

""What?"" Jake said, ""WHAT IS GOING ON!""

I was freaking out on the inside, too, but I decided to stay calm, for Jake's sake.

And then, the elevator doors opened.

""Welcome to the world of tomorrow!"" A voice said, with a slight tremolo. 

""What the?"" I said, shocked. This... this was from a TV show. I think it was called Futurama. I'd only ever seen the pilot episode, but this was practically the same thing.

""Alicia?"" Jake said, terrified.

""I think we're in the future."" I said.

""It's from Futurama. I've seen the whole series seven times.""

""Why do you like it that much?""

""I don't know.""

The lights flickered on, and a guy in a lab coat stood in front of us.

""Welcome to the year 3015!"" Lab Coat Guy said, ""I am glad to welcome you to the future!""

Jake and I both looked at him, gaping.

""What?"" Lab Coat Guy said.

""This is a TV show,"" I said.

""Oh, yeah. Matt Groening accurately predicted the future. We'll bring you guys to the Planet Express building, if you want.""

""YES!"" Jake shouted.

We would never get back. This was the end for our former selves, but we would get to meet some of Jake's favorite television characters, so I guess it wasn't all bad.

The first thing you want to do is practice on Night 6. Do the 4/20 pattern on N6, and it'll help you get into the groove without serious consequences if you forget to close the door.

Trust me, you will run out of power and die, but that won't happen on 4/20 as long as you're careful.

One of the biggest things is to keep Foxy from hitting your door. If you check him often enough, he'll stay in the Cove.

Once you hit 5%, stop. Just drop the tablet or phone or whatever (Onto a soft surface, of course) and DO NOT TOUCH IT! You're going to be golden as long as Foxy was either entirely in the Cove or just peeking out. The only danger to ""dropping dead"" in-game is Freddy.

As I started to sweep, I heard gunshots down in the square. I sank my head, and stopped sweeping. By the time he was finished, the place would be a mess again.

At least there was always the Load. At least I wouldn't be dead.

Of course, he wouldn't be either.",2015-07-23 02:32:46+00:00,ctcwtgy,1.0,t3_3e8oa1,21792.0,WritingPrompts

3873,"Maybe, but it's part of the official timeline, so it's probably a prequel to FNaF 3. Maybe the ""Non-official"" timeline would be a continuation of the bad ending, a bit like the official Zelda timeline, where some of the games branch off from alternate fates of the hero. In this case, the timeline could branch off from the ""Souls of the children are released"" timeline, and ""The Souls of the children are trapped"" endings. There could even be a timeline where the purple guy never died, or where he never killed the children at all. If the purple guy never came along, it would be an interesting topic for a game. Why are the animatronics attacking you, if the children never died? It would be a whole other side to an already interesting story. But of course, if may happen again, in the future. Fazbear's Pizza would never get shut down from the bite, as the animatronics would never be haunted. But, if an alternate version of the purple guy appeared fifty years from today, we might just have ourselves a FNaF game set in the future. Although, I don't know what game mechanics would be incorparated. Wind power, maybe.",2015-07-21 02:38:54+00:00,ctagnvz,2.0,t1_ctagewe,450.0,fivenightsatfreddys
