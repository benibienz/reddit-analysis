I'm also a girl, and have a very big crush on the guy who I talk about below.)

I can't sleep. I would love to, but I've spent the last five hours crying. I found out that my best friend is moving to Seattle from Minneapolis, after this year of school ends, and it's finally sinking in.

It's that sort of thing where I never thought I would have to deal with this. Nobody ever really leaves Minnesota. You're here, and you get sort of trapped. It's the concept of the Minnesota goodbye, but on a larger scale. You try to leave. You get in your car, and you're about to pull out of the driveway, then the host of whatever party you were at comes out and goes, ""Oh, hey, you forgot your jacket..."" and you stay there, in the freezing cold of Mid-December, talking to that person. It goes on like that sometimes for an hour. You just keep talking and talking, and then eventually you go, ""Hey, listen, I've got this thing I really need to go to and I'm gonna be late if I stick around any longer,"" when you're already 30 minutes late.

I know I shouldn't be freaking out this much. It's the age of the internet, so I can still talk to him as much as I want, but it's nowhere near the same. He can't come over to my house, carrying a bass guitar he picked up from his dad, along with pages and pages of lyrics to songs he wrote and expect me to pick up my guitar and help him write them. It's not like that. I can't go over to his house and ask if I can pet his cat, just because I feel like it. I have to drive there, or pay for a plane ticket, and that costs real money, something I don't have. I have fake internet points.

Anyway, what did you guys do to deal with your friends moving away? I'm trying to figure something out to make myself calm down a little.",CasualConversation,How did you guys deal with friends moving away in high school?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/5937hj/how_did_you_guys_deal_with_friends_moving_away_in/

You don't fight all the antagonists on one night, ever, as far as I can tell (I'm stuck on Night 4, but I have heard [that](/s ""Baby"") is the antagonist on Night 5.

Doesn't this feel oddly familiar to you guys? Although Night 1 is really more of a tutorial than anything else, Night 2 onwards is the closest I feel we'll ever come to a OWaF. The second night, you face three antagonists(Bidybabs, Ballora, Funtime Foxy), the next night you face two(Funtime Foxy and the Bonnie Puppet), and you face, I guess, two antagonists on Night 4(Minireenas and the Springlocks). Then, you go and confront the big bad on Night 5(Again, I haven't actually played past Night 4, or even seen any videos on it, but this is as far as I can tell from posts I've read here.)

SL has problems, like OWaF was said to face. And, not just glitches, like the elevator continuing to go down, getting stuck in that space under the desk, or the mouse moving around by itself. Night 4 has some of the most serious problems in a FNaF game.

""Hey, Mike, you'll be fine alone in that place for a night, right? I don't want you getting hurt,"" Mike's girlfriend, Jessie, asked.

""I'm gonna be fine! It's just a kids' pizzeria,"" Mike responded.
""Alright. Please, just... be careful.""

Mike smiled, and hopped in his car. He knew about the dangers of Freddy Fazbear's, but it didn't really seem so bad, today. He needed money, and working there might be his only ticket to any other job.

Fazbear's was only a few blocks away, and he got there within a few minutes. He parked his car just as the last guests were leaving, and he smiled and waved while they left.

""Mike! Good to see you've made it,"" A man said. Mike smiled, and offered a hand to shake.

""Good to be here. You must be my boss?"" Mike asked.

""Yes, that I am! I'll help you get all set up in your office, then I'll leave you alone for the night. Oh, I'm Mr. Afton, by the way. Please, call me William.""

""Can do, William.""

Afton opened the door to the pizzeria, and held it open for Mike. The animatronics were standing still on their stage, but they still kind of weirded him out.

""Come on, down this hallway."" Afton urged Mike to move away from the characters, and he quickly followed the advice.

""Now, this is your office. It's not much, but it's safe.""

""Safe? What from?""

""Oh, all sorts of things. People sneaking in, trying to steal stuff, the animatronics themselves, but I doubt you'll actually need to use any of the safety protocols.""

""Why would the animatronics be a threat?""

""Well, they have to move around, at night. Otherwise, their servos get all locked up, and they can't preform for the kids the next day. They're a bit touchy, though, and might see you as an endoskeleton without its costume. Then, they'll try to put you in one, and that wouldn't be good.""

There was a thump outside the right door, and Afton tapped the button behind him. It closed with a metallic bang, and Afton chuckled.

""Hmm, Chica must already be wandering around. Well, that's no matter. Now, you only have a limited amount of power each night. I know, it sounds strange, but we've had to make some pretty serious budget cuts to keep this place running.""

There was another thump outside the left door, and Afton gestured towards it.

""Close that for me, would you, Mike?""

Mike tapped the door button, and it slammed closed.

""Why do I need to close the doors?"" Mike asked.

""Well, that's the thing. Those characters really are dangerous, and those doors keep them out. Here, I'll show you.""

Afton tapped the light button on the right door, and the pair saw Chica, standing in the window.

""Ah, Chica. Hello, darling.""

""What the hell?!""

""Exactly. I fear we may be trapped in here.""

The lights suddenly went out, and the doors shot up.

""Mr. Afton?""

""Yes?""

""Are we going to die?""

""Yes.""",fivenightsatfreddys,"I wrote a story for /u/TheShadowQuill's writing challenge, but I don't really have a title for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/4zzwhz/i_wrote_a_story_for_utheshadowquills_writing/

Okay, at first, this is going to sound like something out of Game Theory, but you need to stick with me here. I'm going to use the handedness of characters(do they use their right hand or left hand to hold things?) in order to figure out Mangle's gender. It won't make sense until the very end, but please read through it.

Let's start with FNaF 1. [This] (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/7/7a/Stage_Normal.png/revision/latest?cb=20140825030838) image is pretty good with helping, there. You can see that Freddy holds his mic in his right hand, and Bonnie strums his guitar with his right. Except, Chica holds the cupcake with her left.

In FNaF 2, everything stays the same. [Toy Freddy] (http://www.fnafgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Toy-Freddy-2.png) still holds the microphone with his right, [Toy Bonnie] (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/f/f1/ToyBonnieInPartyRoom3.png/revision/latest?cb=20141111103328) still strums with his right, and [Toy Chica] (http://media.tumblr.com/0123080ce1ec6c0aaee8a7a2be8fcd32/tumblr_inline_nf07m41Ikr1r0b6w5.png) still holds the cupcake with her left. So, good on Scott for keeping everything straight, there.

The withereds keep this same pattern. At least, Freddy does, and that's really the only character we can count, seeing as the others can't really hold anything. [He still holds his microphone in his right hand.] (http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/29605496399319756/A2C89577145E35B185C8E8A611AECB7362F14253/)

FNaF 3 is where it gets difficult to make observations, but we can try. As far as I can tell, [Freddy] (http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/b/b8/Extra_Freddy.png/revision/latest?cb=20150304013140) still uses his right hand. [Chica] (http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/five-nights-at-freddys-wiki-comment-section/images/4/44/Tell_me_i_m_pretty_phantom_chica_by_gold94chica-d8knwvc.png/revision/latest?cb=20150331143619), doesn't have a prop, and Springtrap doesn't really do anything in terms of props.

FNaF 4 only contributes to Chica. [She still holds the cupcake in her left hand.] (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/6/6b/NightmareChicaExtra.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150724023851) Even [Fredbear] (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9Pq9LFJAh4/maxresdefault.jpg) still holds the microphone in his right hand. 

We come to Sister Location, and this is something I find really odd. [Baby] (http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/fnaf-world-rpg/images/9/9a/Scottgamesbabyteaser.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20160516202824) is very clearly left handed. [Funtime Freddy] (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/4/41/Fnaf5teaser5.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20160521143443) is weird here, as well. He uses his microphone in his left hand, but uses the [Puppet] (https://embed.gyazo.com/e72247e4a08138819460a88d28f63153.png) in his left. (Sorry, that was the best image I could find.) Ballora and Funtime Foxy have no clear handedness.

So far, I've sort of left Foxy out of this. That's because, though his hook is on his right hand through all the games, there's no definite conclusion you can make through that.

Conclusions! It seems like, as far as we know, the male characters in the series are right handed, and the female characters are left handed.

The best thing I can get out of this is Mangle's gender. At the end of the FNaF World trailer, they're shown using a paddleball (at least, I think that's what that is?). With their [***right hand.***] (http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/the-real-fnaf-world/images/6/62/Paddleball_Mangle.gif/revision/latest?cb=20151104164252) This most likely means that **Mangle is a boy.**

TL;DR: Mangle is a guy because he uses his right hand to play paddleball. All the female characters throughout the series are left handed, and all the male characters are right handed.",FazCo,"I think I may have solved Mangle's gender, take 2",https://www.reddit.com/r/FazCo/comments/4x8il4/i_think_i_may_have_solved_mangles_gender_take_2/

News! There's been a whole ton of stuff getting updated on scottgames.com today, but I can't really be bothered to find links. So, enjoy it if you see them!

Also, since I'm actually doing things right now, here's the interview with /u/edgy-triangle. You'll get one with Bonfim next week.

WL: Why do you like FNaF

ET: Well I'll be honest that I didn't think much of it till I watched Markiplier play some of it. What caught my interest was how different it was from most games in the horror genre and the strategic simplicity of the gameplay. Then came the lore from watching FNAF 2 which really pushed me into being a fan--I love that there's a story that you can come to a conclusion to by putting the pieces together. I also realized that this game combines two things I like, robots and ghosts, in an interesting way.

WL: What's your favorite part of the series so far, including FNaF World and TSE?

ET: Favorite part? Well, I can't decide on that--I like each one for their own reasons! As for TSE I have sadly not read it yet, but it sounds like an interesting read.

WL: What prompted you to start making art for the series?

ET: It started with me drawing out a few characters to see how well they'd look in my style. That's when I realized that I like drawing them and continued to do more. Their anatomy is quite easy for me to understand as well, especially with SFM models that I can use to observe that.

WL: What's your favorite thing about the community, both here and on the main subreddit?

ET:  I really love how involved and productive it is! It's nice too see people getting inspired by the game and making fanworks in multiple medias; art, models, music, fangames, crafting--you name it! There's a lot of nice members in this community too; on here, on the main sub, and the Discord chats. Weather it's sharing our art, helping each other deal with the troubles of life, or just simply memeing it up I enjoy hanging out with them. I also have a lot of respect for the creator of the franchise himself: how Scott deals with all the haters has helped my own outlook on life.

WL: Finally, since it's FNaF 1's second birthday, what were your opinions on the game when it first came out?

ET: As I stated before, I didn't really go and check it out when it was originally released. I did see a few bits of fanart on my Tumblr dash, but never got to looking at any Let's Plays to see if I liked it. I was a bit distracted by my other fandoms at the time most likely. I finally had a look at Markiplier's playthrough when I noticed my cousin was a huge fan of it.",FazCo,Lupin's Gold Thread #4 - I already said these were a Monday thing,https://www.reddit.com/r/FazCo/comments/4wrj9w/lupins_gold_thread_4_i_already_said_these_were_a/

It feels like it's been so much longer than that.

I've always been an awkward, nerdy kid. I have a closet full of shirts from various sci-fi fandoms, a room that's painted TARDIS blue, and even mentioning Futurama sends me into a spiral of quotes that you can't really get me out of for about 15 minutes.

This meant that, after switching schools just after FNaF came out, I was kind of alone. Nobody was willing to listen to me ramble about whatever I was interested in that week. So, I skipped between lunch tables every day, trying to find some place that would put up with me.

I stumbled across my best friends by total accident, thanks to FNaF. I got introduced to the series thanks to Markiplier, as I'm sure so many of you have, and I fell in love with it. I bought the first game on my phone, and ended up playing it when I couldn't fall into the conversation that the other people at the table were having.

One person sitting there was a massive fan of the game, as well. I struck up a conversation, and we've been friends ever since.
I'm not saying this because I want you to feel bad for me. I'm saying this because this game has been my life for the past two years. It has been the only thing that's important to me.

I don't know what I would have done without Five Nights at Freddy's. I'm not charming in real life. I stutter, and to cover that, I either don't talk, or I quote something and laugh to try to pretend I'm making actual conversation. But with FNaF, I actually have something to talk about.

Above all else, I'm so thankful for you guys. I've made some of my best friends here, namely /u/chaosdelivered, a certain Squiddy mod, and /u/LilCoach. The art, and the theories, and the general awesomeness that come out of this community are one of the things that have made my life good.

Basically, I, a 15 year-old girl, was forced to sit in the middle of the back seat in the car between two very tall men for 6 hours straight. Everything is still uncomfortable, and I'm gonna have to do it again after they've been on bicycles for 400 miles in 7 days, with almost no showers.

So, yeah.

Anyway, because I was being totally incompetent even before that, there won't be an artist interview this week. But, I don't give a fuck, because then I'd only have three left.

Is done.

If somebody actually draws this, this totally sarcastic half-rant, I'll give you gold. And maybe I'll actually give a fuck.

If two people feel the need to steal my fucks, I'll do a voice over for this. Because I have literally nothing else to do, at this point.

If you need my FNaFsona, I think I give no fucks. Phantom Mangle, or Funtime Foxy, or Phantom Funtime Foxy, I don't really care.

Also, news! I guess there was a teaser. And a movie night that I missed.

I also guess scottgames and fnafworld are down, for some reason.

I'm so done, right now.",FazCo,Lupin's Gold Thread #2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FazCo/comments/4ukn2b/lupins_gold_thread_2/

This is a story generally based off the concept of three different universes/AUs of FNaF colliding. These are a close(ish) representation of the real FNaF universe, Bonfim_BR and superlolzreddit-'s Children comic, and a story I've been writing with chaosdelivered for close to a year now called Still Alive.

I've included a massive explanation of what you need to know about the Still Alive universe at the beginning, since I figure nobody wants to read a five ""book"" story that has parts entirely based in Undertale.

Now, we’re gonna get into the Lupin Exclusive stuff! I have two things that I currently have planned that are unique to my Gold Thread. An interview with an artist on the sub, and my favorite piece of art from the week.

***Lupin’s Art of the Week***

“Phantom Mangle Animup” by /u/_Dragon_King_

As you can tell by my flair, Phantom Mangle is my favorite character, and I just love Dragon’s Artwork. So, this is my Art of the Week! This doesn’t mean it’s the best piece of art, this just means it’s my personal favorite.

[Reddit Link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/FazCo/comments/4sjnj4/phantom_mangle_animup/)

[Imgur Link] (http://i.imgur.com/sF8nKvh.png)

Alright! Now it’s time for the artist interview. I interviewed /u/_Dragon_King_ this week. There are a few simple questions, but nothing really major. Enjoy!

Side note: Throughout the transcript, I’m referred to as WL, and _Dragon_King_ is referred to as DK.

WL: Alright, let’s start this off simple.

WL: Why do you like Five Nights at Freddy's?

DK: Well I was first introduced to the game when Game Grumps played FNaF 1. It was the first time that watching a youtuber play a game actually made me buy the game! The scary thing about FNaF is atmosphere. The idea of these kid friendly robots hunting you down is just so different compared to other horror games. And in other horror games you have to find your way around the enemy, but in FNaF, you have to stop the enemy from finding its way to you. FNaF is ,and has been, my favorite game for the creepy style of horror and gameplay that no other game has done.

WL: Which is your favorite episode of the series(Including FNaF World and TSE), and why?

DK: My favorite game in the series would be a tie between FNaF 1 and FNaF 4. FNaF 1 brought us into such a mysterious game with little tiny hints explaining the lore, while keeping questions open. FNaF 4 was a game changer. New horrifying creatures with gameplay that was so different from the others while sticking to the same genre. Instead of using your vision, you relied completely off of audio. (now if only Scott could make you rely on touch in Sister Location...)

WL: Or maybe even a smell based game :)

WL: Anyway, next question!

WL: What got you to do art for the series?

DK: Well I've been an artist my whole life, and after I became a member of the FNaF community all the way back when FNaF 1 came out, I started to really like Foxy, which to this day is my favorite character. I started to draw Foxy a lot after making the Foxy mask (Which I'm making a mask of every character, btw) and soon started to draw things based off of the series in general.

WL: What's your favorite piece you've done of Foxy?

DK: Hmmmm from what I can think of right now, I would choose the Nightmare Foxy Animup!

WL: (Link, for those wondering: https://www.reddit.com/r/FazCo/comments/4rw08s/nightmare_foxy_animup_my_favorite_character/)

WL: Awesome! I like that one, too.

WL: So, what's your favorite part about the community?

DK: The people that are open to new things and ideas and the other creators that constantly show their creativity and skills to the community, be it art, fangames, or music.

WL: Alright, final question!

WL: Do you think I should keep doing this?

DK: Doing interviews? Yeah, it's a great idea! It let's you learn more about certain people on the sub!

WL: Awesome! Thank you!

Well, congratulations! I didn't think anybody would actually make it this far! I'm going to be doing these incredibly long Gold Threads every week, so enjoy that when it comes next Sunday.",FazCo,Lupin's Gold Thread #1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FazCo/comments/4ta0un/lupins_gold_thread_1/

I'm a moderator on an actual Five Nights at Freddy's subreddit. Working alongside Karinezz, Gameboy, Scrub, N^4, and Retro. This is a massive honor.

Alright, let's get this started! I'll try to be professional, but I'm doing this with a massive earache at 10 at night, so, this might be a bit stilted and everything.

Hey there, everyone! My name's Aeryn, but I usually go by White_Lupin, or even just Lupin on the internet. I'm hitting my first year on Reddit on the 14th, but I was a serious nerd long before I had the chance to express it on the internet.

I'm probably one of the nerdier, more sarcastic people you'll encounter on this subreddit. I'm into quoting Futurama, Farscape(I'm actually named after a character from that show!), Doctor Who, and The Office pretty much every chance I get, and it tends to get combined with a sarcastic rant about something totally useless. I'm also super into music, and do some of my own composition.

In terms of my actual mod duties, I'm doing the Gold Post from here on out! I'm not sure when exactly they'll be, but that's sort of up to me and the other folks now, isn't it?

I'm also a Minnesotan(US), but honestly, I'm more into the internet than fishing or anything like that. You guys get to experience my ""Minnesota Nice"" passive aggressive tendencies first hand, though! I'm hoping to calm them down while helping out around here, but that might not happen. But hey, I'm more likely to bring up something annoying in passing than actually bringing the banhammer down!

I have to say thank you to everyone here. You guys are all awesome people, with awesome art and talents, and I can't wait to see you guys' feedback on my gold thread next week!

P.S. Well, hey, congrats on making it this far. That was kind of awkward and weird, but hey, that's me for you! I'll get up tomorrow and see the strangeness I created, and fix it up, or something. Anyway, thanks again to all the folks that were modding before me for letting me do this. This is huge for me. I've always been a very big fan of FNaF, but my interest had kind of trailed off in the past few months. I saw this sub show up, and it was the thing that got me back into Five Nights at Freddy's.

This community has done so much for me in terms of getting me back into the game, and now I get to be a mod here. Sure, it's not /r/fivenightsatfreddys, it's better. I hope I do a good job. Please, please, feel free to criticize me on anything you'd like me to change. I'm always up for it!

Short Edit: I have to say, I was looking through the mail, and the other three people that didn't get chosen probably would have been better than me at this.

As the bus hit me, I didn't even brace for the impact. It'd all become normal, part of my everyday life. I'd get up, eat breakfast, go to work, and get hit by the 5:30 to St. Paul on the way home. Even if I left early, or late, it'd always be the 5:30 to St. Paul. It had begun to get on my nerves.

But hey, I didn't really have to eat anything, or have normal interactions.

My family and my friends all knew about this, by now. I'd talk to them during work, then head home and get hit by the 5:30 to St. Paul.

I guess the one thing that bothered me was the sheer consistency of it. Why not let me live one freaking work day where I didn't get hit by the bus? It'd be a real nice change of pace.

At least I always woke up the next morning, unharmed. It wasn't a terrible existence. At least all my injuries went away. I convinced someone to hack my arm off with a chainsaw, one day, just before I left work. Well, there was my arm, attached to my body the next day.

I did enjoy the fame, too. Once the newspapers found out about this whole thing, it's been in the news every single day.

Maybe it's gotten annoying, now.

Oh well. Fame isn't everything. Maybe what's important in life is getting hit by the 5:30 to St. Paul.",White_Lupin,5:30 to St. Paul [Writing Prompt],https://www.reddit.com/r/White_Lupin/comments/4grzpb/530_to_st_paul_writing_prompt/

I'm the security guard, so it's my job to help prevent injuries. Well, I could really use some help, so let's get right down to it.

On the job injuries:

In order to prevent on the job injuries, such as Springlock failure, you always need to have one other person helping you. Do not, I repeat, do *not* try to enter a Springlock suit without a spotter. There is a very serious chance of horrible, painful death.

Other injuries, the most common of which is injury from falling animatronic, can be prevented with minimal effort. Do not touch the animatronics while they are on the stage and/or moving. They may fall on you, and Fredbear's Family Diner cannot afford another lawsuit. Springlocks may also be stuck in their coiled position, and you can lose a finger/arm/eye if one unlocks while a body part is inside the suit.

Other injuries:

Keep the children from touching any of the animatronics. Malfunctions can cripple if a body part is in the mouth or joints of an animatronic character. If a child touches a Springlock suit, the Suitee may be injured. **Do not call an ambulance until the Suitee is safely out of the way of children.** This is very, *very* important. We can't have children knowing someone was injured.

This is the first update about my stop-motion FNaF models. I started on Foxy yesterday, and currently have most of his head, and most of his eyepatch done. You can see a picture of both a side-view, and a front-view [here.] (http://imgur.com/gallery/ZRymn)

He's made out of Model Magic, seriously heavy-duty glue, copper wire, and some glaze made for Model Magic.

Let's go on the topic of that glaze for a second. I think that might have been the best thing I could possibly have found for this project. It pretty much insta dries anything it comes into contact with, and gives it a nice shine. The one drawback about that is that some parts of him I don't *want* a shine on. So the eyes and his nose, I used it on, and progressed with letting the rest of it dry naturally.

With next week being Winter Break, I should get a ton of him done between now and my next update. I'll try to post the next one at the same time(7:00 PM CST) next week on Sunday, but don't count on anything.

Oh, and, the first thing I do is probably going to be the Piemations FNaF 2 animation. So, after this, I'll need to make Mangle, Toy Bonnie, Freddy, BB, some dude, and... a Freddy head. I can guarantee you that the final thing in that list will be a death of me.

The one with Foxy’s mask was the hardest to convince.

He said, “No, no! I don’t want to go back to that place after what happened!”

“But we’re throwing a party, just for him! It will allow you all to grieve and have some cake!” He responded.

“No, please. I don’t want to go back.”

“And a special, never before seen character will be there!”

“O-Okay. I’ll come. Just… don’t worry about me if I cry.”

“It’s alright.”

He thinks to himself, “Now I have to set up the spring-lock suits so there are no witnesses.”

He runs to the heavy kid down the street to tell him to come!

The day of the second party arrived.

“Hey kids, check out Golden Bonnie, he’s in the back room!”

Foxy’s Mask was silent at first, then spoke up. “Why is he in the back?” He had a quiet, soft voice, now that he had killed his own brother. He was filled with guilt, yes. He could certainly see that.

Freddy’s Mask quickly followed with, “Yeah, what’s the big deal?” This child had a slight accent. He could tell that he was from New Jersey, just to the East of where they were.

“Because, it’s a special treat, just for you! You’re all going through a rough time in life, and I want to try to make you happier!”

Chica’s Mask was the next to speak. “Why do you care?” She said, brushing her blonde hair back.

“Because, you all come here very often, and your business is appreciated!” He said as he clenched his teeth. 

“You work here?” Bonnie’s Mask scoffed. This kid, he was different. He had the spark of something in his eyes. He wasn’t sure what it was. Mischief, happiness, or terror.

“You know what, if you don’t come in here right now, you can’t see it!”

Chica’s Mask looked back at the others, as she was standing in the front of the group. Freddy’s Mask shrugged, as did Bonnie’s Mask. Foxy’s Mask just stood there, the life gone out of his eyes.

“We’ll come,” Freddy’s Mask said.

“Alright then!” They all entered, following him into the back room. Foxy’s Mask remained behind the others, trailing.

“TIME FOR THE FUN!” He laughed.

“LONDON BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN, FALLING DOWN, LONDON BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN, MY FAIR LADY!”

“COME ON, PALS! SING ALONG WITH ME!”

He walked over to where the Golden Bonnie suit was, and carefully pulled a knife from inside, making sure not to touch the locks on the delicate suit.

“Come on, just sing. The one who sings first dies last.”

“London Bridge is falling down… falling down… falling down,” Chica’s Mask began to murmur. “London Bridge is falling down, my fair lady.”

Freddy’s Mask joined in, his deeper voice contrasting with Chica’s Mask’s.

Bonnie’s Mask was the third to begin, leaving only Foxy’s Mask silent. He was already dead inside, he knew. Maybe… it would be kind to put him out of his misery.

“You first. The silent one is always first.”

He walked up to Foxy’s Mask, who only flinched when the technician walked right up to him, 

“SQUIRM FOR ME!”

Chica’s Mask stopped singing, and quietly said, “Please, don’t do this to us.”

“But, you see, you deserve this!”

“What?” Foxy’s Mask said, “Why do we deserve this? It was just an accident. All just an accident. Please, I didn’t do this on purpose. I didn’t want him to die. I didn’t want it to happen like that.”

“It’s a beautiful day day outside, children. The birds are singing, the flowers are blooming, and kids like you… SHOULD BE BURNING IN HELL!”

“Kill me if you want. I want to escape from all this. Leave my friends. Don’t you *dare* hurt them.”

He repeats “Burning in Hell” Over, and over, and over again, like a broken record.

“I should. Not them. They didn’t do it for themselves. I was the only one who is to blame. Take me, not them. Please, leave my friends…” And then it all ended. Foxy’s Mask’s world went dark. It would stay that way for a while. Blackness, corrupting, crippling, cutting at his soul.

That would be his world.

It was a normal day at the diner, an ordinary technician was just doing his job and helping the employees into their new spring lock suits. 

When suddenly, well, he was in the safe room goofing off, he heard a scream.

The screaming of kids to be specific. The echoed terror of one child’s pain.

He went to go investigate, chuckling a little bit as he walked, though he made sure none of his co-workers, who were beginning to panic as the screams continued, saw this.

What then he saw something that made him burst into laughter

Some of the little brats shoved a kid into Fredbear’s mouth!

But what came the next day, the technician didn’t find hilarious.

He had been fired for failing to save the child.

This is not the tale of revenge you thought it would be.

Oh no, far from it.

Every week, there will also be one game to beat the main campaign of(Nights 1-5). If you compete in that week's Main Campaign competition, then your results will look something like this:

- Night 1: 1 Try

- Night 2: 1 Try

- Night 3: 2 Tries(4 AM, 6 AM)

- Night 4: 4 Tries(3 AM^2, 5 AM, 6 AM)

- Night 5: 3 Tries(3 AM, 5 AM, 6 AM)

If you actually do make it through the night, that counts as one try.

Each night is awarded certain points. Night 1 is worth 2 point, Night 2 is worth 4 points, and so on. For each extra try that it takes you(beyond 1), you lose one point. There are a total of 30 points for each game.

So, in the example I have above, the person would have gotten 21 points. The person with the highest number of points wins that week's competition.

Each night completed will also earn you one point. If you didn't complete Nights 4 and 5 in a week, then you wouldn't get those points. Otherwise, completing a night but losing all your points(Say you have to try 3 times on Night 1) will still earn you 1 point.

He hadn't meant to use all that power, and now he was going to die for it.

He sat as still as he possibly could, waiting for something to happen. It was going to go on like this for a while. He still had about 45 minutes until six when his power had gone out. It was already hard enough working at Hell on Earth, but now, he had to stay absolutely frozen for a whole 45 minutes. This was worse than he ever could have imagined anything being. Well, except death inside a metal contraption designed to house animatronic endoskeletons. That thought alone was enough to keep him still.

Mike listened to the ticking of his watch as the seconds slowly passed. It felt like each second dragged on longer than the last. Tick, tock… tick……tock………tick…………tock……………tick………………

Mike was contemplating giving himself up to the animatronics after just a few minutes of this. Even horrible, painful death would be better than eternal boredom.

A creaking sound came from the hallway. A slow, solid step. Just a single one.

Mike waited for another two minutes, silent, before the next step came.

It had only been five minutes, and Mike knew his end was drawing near. Panic set in, and he did everything he could to not make a single sound.

What if he died in this hellhole? What would become of his family? More importantly, what would become of the animatronics? His whole job was to protect them, and he hadn't done a very good job of that if they were now coming to kill him.

Had he provoked this attack? Had he done such a bad job that the creatures lurking around the building had come to attack him?

""It's only my first night!"" Mike yelled into the hallway, ""I'll do so much better tomorrow!""

There was the sound of another heavy footstep, and realization hit Mike like a sledgehammer.

He'd just made a noise.

He'd been told so many times before starting his job that, if his power went out, that he was not to make a single noise. Any kind of sound could make the animatronics go haywire. He'd just screamed in the face of one of them.

It had only been eight minutes since he had lost his power, and he had already given up his life.

Mike took a deep breath, telling himself that he wasn't going to die tonight. He was going to be okay. He was going to make it home. He was only 24, he couldn't die today.

Another step came from out in the hallway. They had sped up now that Mike had yelled, and he knew it.

He began sobbing, quietly. He tried not to, but the tears came anyway. He knew he was going to die, there was just no way around it. He was the one who had done this, and he couldn't make up for it.

There was one more step, and Freddy's face lit up out in the hallway. A single, low note started to emit from Freddy, and continued for about three minutes. Mike whimpered, and waited patiently for his doom.

Freddy's face went off, and there was a short pause before it came back came back on and played a slightly different note.

Mike looked up to Freddy, and wiped his eyes dry. He still had about 35 minutes before he got off his shift. Freddy couldn't go on for that long, could he?

After about 38 minutes, Freddy slowly flickered into the dark. The power finally dropped entirely off, and Mike sat back in his chair, twiddling his thumbs. It had been so uneventful that he finally stopped caring. He knew that Bonnie and Chica were waiting outside his other door, and that Freddy would get him if he moved. So, he stayed in his chair, waiting out his doom.

Mike sighed, looking to the empty door. It wasn't much, but at least he knew that his family loved him. Even if he died, right then, he would know that he was loved.

He was surprised when he didn't die immediately. He silently waited the next 17 minutes, hearing only the occasional footstep, and, in the last two minutes, hot breath on his face.

The clock went off, and there were quick, running footsteps away from him. The lights slowly flickered back on, and Mike took a deep breath in.

Though few people noticed it, one out of every 10,000 flakes that fell was red. They weren't red because they fell on a stop sign, or because they were seen against the moon.

Do you know why a blood moon is called a blood moon? Only a very small part of it is because the moon turns red. It is because, every once in a while, when something very bad happens, the moon will bleed. It only happens on nights like that one, when snow fills the air, and it's just warm enough for snow to melt as it touches the streets.

That night, a man by the name of David Preston pulled out of the parking lot of a local Chuck E. Cheese competitor in his plum Dodge Shadow, gripping his steering wheel as tight as he could. He had just done something horrible, and did not want to remember it.

He was scared. He knew that, deep inside of him, something had broken. Blackness was consuming him. At some point, maybe the next day, perhaps on his death bed, the darkness would eat him alive.

He tried to convince himself that he didn't do it for the reason that he knew he'd done it. Maybe his mother was right, and a full moon doesn't just pull on the tides, it pulls on your conscience, and ruins your morals. Maybe he just wanted to put them out of their misery.

No, he knew that he had done it for one reason only. He didn't want to know it, but he did.

He did it because he'd enjoyed it.

The moon did not bleed that night for childish reasons. It didn't bleed because some famous man had died, or because a pet dog had run away. It didn't even bleed for the child's life that had been cut short in front of a pizzeria. It bled because a good man's soul had been shattered, and it could not weep.

**Author's Notes:** This was made as a test to see if you guys like this style of writing and/or this storyline. Feel free to tell me if you've got some constructive criticism!

This was a project that me and three other friends started about a year ago, maybe a month or so after FNaF 2 came out. The others have kind of abandoned the project, which is called What The FNaF?, but I felt like it had some good ideas in it.

I decided to come to Reddit to find some help for the project. It's FNaF 2 based, so it uses all the FNaF 2 animatronics. It also has a nightguard named John, a janitor character, and somebody called ""Old Man Gary""(He does... something... at Freddy Fazbear's, but I don't even think the person who came up with him(Which wasn't me, mind you) knew what he did.).

**Sidenote**- Old Man Gary isn't the purple guy, he wasn't involved in any of the storylines. Although... this guy might have done some bad things to children, I don't know.

Anyway, I'm going to need a lot of people to help out. I've got a [subreddit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatTheFNaF/) set up, but it doesn't have anything on it yet. I'll be needing animators, voice actors, and a lot of things overall. So, if you'd like to be the face of What the FNaF?, go ahead and apply.

We were planning on 35 episodes (5 seasons of 7 days), and got most of them planned out. Here's a list of episode titles with their descriptions.

Oh, wait, one more thing. This is meant to be a sarcastic parody of FNaF, not a serious series at all. Some of the episodes are kind of... strange, but that's the whole point.

Season 1, Episode 1: John's New Job. John gets a job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Pretty obvious, right?

S 1, Ep. 2: The Janitor. Introduces the gag of the janitor. There's a janitor for every season, and he/she tends to get killed in horrible ways.

S1, E3: Old Man Gary. Introduced the gag of Old Man Gary.

S1, E4: Golden Freddy. Introduces the character of Golden Freddy, who is basically the one bad guy in the entire series. Although, I wouldn't really say he's a bad guy. Just annoying.

S1, E5: Where's my face? General panic about Withered Bonnie's face. You knew this was coming.

S1, E6: Buying Doors. John gets some doors, and the animatronics all kind of freak out.

S1, E7: Yum Stew. Foxy starts making this thing called ""Yum Stew"", and nobody really knows what it's made out of.

S2, E1: The Daring Spree, Pt. 1. The Freddys all start daring each other to do stupid things. Golden Freddy gets dragged into the mix, at some point.

S2, E2: The Daring Spree, Pt. 2. More of the same stuff from the previous episode.

S2, E3: The Basement. They find some weird stuff in the basement. I think this was when the Puppet finally started making appearances.

S2, E4: Attack of the Memes. Yeah... this one was odd. The animatronics programming(Except for Toy Bonnie's) all get overrun with memes. Insert epic quest to fix it.

S2, E5: Operation: Bite. THis was when we still thought Mangle caused the bite. Oh well, we'll go along with it. Many failed attempts to bite some dude.

S2, E6: Hide-and-Seek. The animatronics get together to play hide-and-seek. The season 2 janitor is in this episode.

S2, E7: Shin Kicking Fun. One animatronic starts kicking another in the shins. There's something weird that happened, but I don't know what it was.

S3, E1: Shadows. The shadow animatronics show up in this episode, and this episode only.

S3, E2: TGIF. ""It's not a Friday, John. It's a Tuesday.""

""So?""

S3, E3: DDR Chica. Probably one of the most sarcastic episodes in the whole series, Chica starts playing DDR.

S3, E4: Bad Scripting. A collection of badly scripted/acted skits.

S3, E5: MLG Nightguard. Again, a sarcastic parody. John gets a bunch of game systems, including a SNES, and gets COD for all of them. Foxy shoots all the game disks.

S3, E6: Toast. Something about toast. I don't remember.

S3, E7: Dropping the Cupcake. Another sarcastic parody, Chica and Toy Chica face off in a rap battle. The cupcakes are the microphones, and they both drop the cupcakes.

S4, E1: Time Machine. The Withereds go forward in time through the different FNaF games, all the way up to FNaF 100.

S4, E2: Empty Slot.

S4, E3: Empty Slot.

S4, E4: Empty Slot.

S4, E5: Other Games: Awesome. The animatronics have a discussion about how other games are better than FNaF.

S4, E6: Empty Slot.

S4, E7: Sandwiches. Something about sandwiches. I don't know.

S5, E1: Empty Slot.

S5, E2: Empty Slot.

S5, E3: Empty Slot.

S5, E4: Empty Slot.

S5, E5: Empty Slot.

S5, E6: Empty Slot.

S5, E7: Day Shift. John gets transferred over to the day shift.",fivenightsatfreddys,"Now that Psychic Friend Fredbear kind of got killed, I've got an idea for a new FNaF show.",https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/3slkvb/now_that_psychic_friend_fredbear_kind_of_got/

Scott actually [responded] (https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/3e83qt/how_five_nights_at_freddys_changed_my_life_update/) to that, and I cried on and off for about two hours out of sheer happiness. Now that the series is ending, and for good, this time, not like what happened in FNaF 3, I'm having a really hard time dealing with it.

I mean, with FNaF ending, the two friends I was talking about in the first link have sort of split off. This game series has been my lifeline, and it's being cut. I don't think I mean that literally, but, I really don't know. It's been *such* an important thing in my life that I don't really feel like I can give it up.

I know what the responses are going to be. ""But FNaF World's going to come out!"". It's not the same thing, at all. I think I bonded with my friends over how tough FNaF was. With an RPG, it just won't be the same.

At least I still have you guys. If I don't have friends in real life, I have people online!

But... really. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm sorry if this post doesn't make any sense, I'm kind of shaken up right now. I'm kind of having trouble thinking, and I didn't pre-write this.

Anyway, this is just so overwhelming. I've spent the last year of my life so devoted to this franchise that I didn't really have time for anything else, and now the last little bit of it that's left is dying away like a rotten egg. (What the hell am I talking about? My English teacher would be sad. I think I'm kinda loopy from jet lag. I flew back from Florida to Wisconsin, today.) When the community finally dies for good, I think that I'll die inside, along with it.

Really, that made no sense. I'm going to try to let you guys decode that. It'll give you some good practice. :)

Quick edit: There's one good thing about all of this. Even when everything else in the community has fallen to the ground, I'll still be here, posting crappy fan art and sappy stories about how horrible my life is. I really shouldn't have posted this. It's just going to make more people hate me, and then I'm probably going to have to figure out how to earn people's trust back. It's just an endless circle of burying yourself in a hole, realizing what a bad idea that was, and then only digging yourself deeper into that hole that is your life.

Another edit: Wow, this sub has really gone to hell. The first link I put up, which is from 3 months ago, is getting downvoted.

As the sledgehammer struck against the wall, cracks erupted everywhere, and there was a low, hollow sound.

Mike flinched back, and said to Jeremy, “Why are we doing this? You’re just hitting a wall.”

“Trust me, Mike!” Jeremy said, preparing to hit the wall again, “I know what I’m doing.”

“Jeremy-”

“Seriously. Just calm down!” Jeremy struck the wall a second time. Another bang echoed throughout the pizzeria, and more cracks appeared.

“This isn’t a good idea! I’m the one who works here, and I’m going to get fired!”

“You know you shouldn’t be working here anyway.”

“I agree,” Fritz said, glancing up from his book, “We’ve both got perfectly good jobs, now.”

“Shut up, Fritz,” Mike said.

Jeremy hit the wall with the hammer again, and it caved in, revealing a wooden door.

“We’ve struck gold, crew,” Jeremy said.

“How’d you know this was here?” Anne asked.

“I just did.” Jeremy responded.

  Fritz put his book down, and came over to the door.

“Why the heck are we doing this?” Mike asked.

Fritz kicked the door, and dust flew everywhere.

“Really. This is such a bad idea.”

Fritz began to back up, and Jeremy quickly dodged out of the way.

“We don’t know what’s gonna be back there!”

Fritz ran at the door, putting his weight into the door. It buckled inwards, and a drop of water fell from the ceiling.

“Well, I guess I’ll go first, huh?” Fritz said, lighting up his flashlight.

“What the hell are you *doing*!” Mike shouted.

Fritz was consumed by the darkness, and the other three stood outside, waiting for him.

There was a scream, and the flashlight beam shone out towards the door as it fell.

“Jesus! This is what I was talking about!” Mike yelled.

Anne gasped, and Jeremy smirked.

“Dude, calm down,” Jeremy said.

“I’m on Mike’s side, at this point,” Anne said, “This was a terrible idea.”

Mike rushed off, and found the light switch. The lights in the building flickered on, shining on the empty stage.

“Shit!” Mike yelled, “We’ve got to get out of here!”

Jeremy snorted, and said, “What’s your problem? They’re not gonna get us.”

“Yes, they are! We have to go, now!”

There was more screaming from the back room, and Mike ran over, looking in through the doorway.

There was an old Springlock suit, laying on the floor, twitching. Fritz had gotten into it.

“Fritz is already dead. We have to get out before the same happens to us!”

“Mike, this was the whole point,” Jeremy said, holding up a remote.

“What the-” Anne said.

“You’re all fools. We knew that one of us had to be the killer.”

“Jeremy, what are you doing?” Mike said.

“You still don’t know. I seriously underestimated your stupidity. Goodbye, Mike.”

A shadow fell over Mike, and he slowly turned around to see Foxy smiling over him.

“Anne, run.” Mike said.

Foxy bit into his shoulder, and Mike screamed.

Anne turned to Jeremy, and he smiled.

“I’ll let you go, Anne. You’ve always been so nice. I can’t believe that you worked the night shift at Fredbear’s. You seem like you wouldn’t last a day.”

Anne ran towards Pirate Cove, where Mike had been dragged.

“I’m so sorry, Mike. I promise you, I won’t forget you.”

Anne bolted out the front door, and Jeremy let go of a button on his remote.

“Come and get me, children. I’ll see you all soon.”

Maybe this will even be in the newspapers. I was *constantly* reading about the deeds I had done that month in the local paper, although I could never tell a soul that it was me.

Well, you must want to know my name. I am Katherine Smith, more commonly known as the Purple Man.

Oh, that's right. You've always though I was a guy. I can hardly believe that I tricked a whole country into thinking that the most famous killer of all time was a man.

But, what did I expect? This whole world is biased towards the male gender. When children were killed at a local pizzeria, of *course* it was a man behind the mask. It might have been a good thing that I started these deaths at 13. It's been four years, can you believe that? Oh, those sweet little *darlings* have been dead for a good long time, now.

Did anybody check the animatronics?

That's where I'll be going. The darlings have come back for me.

I don't even know why I started killing. I suppose… I think that I just wanted a child of my own. One where I would always know where they were. One that I could easily find in my ripe, new teenage-hood.

So, I found a poor little three year old, crying outside of the old Fredbear's Family Diner, and I shot them, right through the heart with a handgun.

The police found that body so quickly. That one didn't go anywhere, so I waited another two years. I wanted them to feel the suspense of not knowing when a killer would strike next.

I have had that feeling all of my life. I never knew when the next electrocution would come.

When Fazbear's opened, I quickly took out five children, all in one sweep. Little children are easily influenced by their favorite characters. I simply donned a costume of the old Spring Bonnie character, brought them to the back room, and killed them, one by one. One with a knife, one with a noose, one with poison, one with electrocution, and the last one, the last one was special. They got the treatment the first one did. A bullet through the heart.

And nobody knew it was coming.

Some idiot night guard got blamed. They're in prison, right now.

I myself, my five little darlings are in the doorway. They want me to die, in worse ways than they did. The suit I used, the old Springlock, well… it's right across the room.

I have always respected my darlings. I will do as they please. I will get in the suit, and let the Springlocks snap down over me.

Karma's a bitch.

Well, we now all know about FNaF World, the brand new RPG based around the FNaF series. I, quite frankly, am amazed. This isn't what I expected.

But, it's what's going to happen.

This is a shocking change from the four hugely successful horror games. If you can pull this off, that would be truly impressive. And, by pull this off, I mean epic boss battles, a good story, and not digressing too much from the original games. Even though this is an RPG, I feel like you could keep... the personalities of the different animatronics. Personalities is hard to describe when it comes to silent antagonists in a horror game about killer animatronics, but I feel like each character has a distinct personality. For instance, let's take FNaF 1 Bonnie. He would end up being kind of outgoing, y'know what I mean?

Anyway, I wanted to talk about boss battles, in particular. They could be just amazing. The big thing is that you have to keep with the FNaF theme. No adorable little badgers, or whatever Chipper was. They have to be really thematic. I think that we all expect that the bosses are going to be either brand new characters, the night guards, or, as a final boss, the Purple Man himself (win the battle, he gets put into the Springtrap suit, you win Springtrap as a character). This would be just amazing, but, you could go a pretty bad way, too. Make all the fights either way too easy, way too hard, or just unexplainable, like not even having characters that would make sense in a FNaF game.

In terms of a good story, that would be pretty easy, judging from your amazing tale of the four main series FNaF games.

But, more than anything, this game has to be memorable.

I don't mean bad memorable, like, ""Wow, that game was so horrible that I'm going to remember it until I die for being *so bad*."" It should be memorable because it was amazing.

I want to look back, twenty years from now, and remember the four amazing main series FNaF games, who changed everybody's perspective on horror each time a new one came out. Who revolutionized the *meaning* of horror within just a year, and I also want to remember the profound RPG that came after them, which revitalized the RPG industry.

I want this game to change the RPG genre as a whole.

And, I know, that's a lot to ask, but I feel like you can do it.

If the original FNaFs can create a huge community, hundreds of fan games, and four amazing horror games in just under a year, this game could change everything about modern gaming.

Anyway, if you, or anybody reading this, made it this far, I just want to say thanks.

And, if it's actually Scott Cawthon reading this, thank *you*, for everything. I know this doesn't seem like the kind of thing that would be coming from the person who sent you a long email about how FNaF changed my life. About how FNaF gave me friends. About how your games gave me a reason to keep on going. This is coming from the person who cried tears of joy when you sent a two sentence response to an email that poured out some of my most personal thoughts.

So, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

This would let the first victim be both the Puppet and Golden Freddy. This way, both the FNaF 2 minigames *and* FNaF 4 would be right. This also allows the newspaper clippings in FNaF 1 to be accurate. In one universe, the Purple Guy is caught, in another, he dies in Springtrap.

Chapter 2:

  I sat down at a round table in a Caribou Coffee across from Ashley, clutching my large dark roast close to my chest.

  ""So,"" I said, although that single word was so quiet that it almost got lost in the noise of the coffee shop.

  ""So, Jeremy,"" Ashley began, ""I've wanted to get to know you, as a friend, for a long time. Why did you keep avoiding me?""

  I sat there, slowly sipping my coffee for about three minutes. Ashley calmly waited, but, after about two and a half minutes, a look of disappointment began to slip onto her smiling face.

  ""Um…"" I began, not sure how to start, ""I just… I- I wasn't sure you'd want to talk to me. It's just- you're so pretty… I didn't have a chance- I…"" I looked up at Ashley, away from my white, paper cup, and she locked eyes with me.

  ""I think you need to get out more."" She laughed, and I chuckled along with her, even though I had a feeling that I had done something horribly wrong. I had been so embarrassed about getting to know the pretty girl at work for almost a year, and she simply laughed it off as if it was nothing. That wasn't my usual experience with girls. Even in high school, I'd been horrible at talking to girls. There was this one classmate, Maria, I think, that seemed so nice. I wanted to talk to her, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. So I ended up running away every chance I got to talk to her. She even came up to me once, but I just couldn't deal. Eventually, she caught me off guard and got me out on a date. We were both so happy, but she… kind of disappeared about a week later. Nobody knows where she went. The worst thing was that there was a murderer caught right around the school just a week later. The police told everybody she died.

  Not a good experience for a nervous wreck like me.

  ""Jeremy?"" Ashley asked. I guess I'd been zoning out.

  ""Um, yeah?"" I responded.

  ""Maybe we should just go to dinner tonight. I can meet you at work after my shift ends. I'll be out around four.""

  ""Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good.""

  ""Good. I don't want you to think that this is a date, though. This is the first time I've talked to you. I don't think that we can possibly be officially dating yet.""

  ""I understand.""

  Ashley stood up from the table, grabbing her coffee and her jacket. She held out her hand, and I shook my head.

  ""If we're not yet dating, I don't think it would be appropriate to hold hands,"" I said.

  Ashley laughed again, and I shied back into my seat.

  ""Don't be such a spoil-sport. Now come on.""

  I stood up, and took Ashley's hand. Her skin was soft and smooth, and I almost flinched away at the thought of my rough hands.

  Ashley just squeezed my hand harder, and I calmed down a little bit. At least she liked me. Just having a friend was encouraging.

  Well, the manager had tried to convince me that we had been friends in elementary school, but I had never even met anybody named Hank until that fateful day.

  ""Come on, Jeremy. Are you coming?"" Ashley pulled me out of the door, and back to Fazbear's, which, luckily, was right next to the coffee shop. I had forgotten my coat, and it was the middle of Winter. 

  As Ashley dragged me back through the door of Fazbear's, she tripped and fell on the ground.

  ""Ashley?"" I asked, ""Are you okay?""

  ""Yeah, yeah. I'm just fine. Listen, you go home, and I'll talk to you tonight. Got it?""

  ""Sounds good. I'll see you tonight.""

  I left the building, and climbed in my car. I ran my hands through my hair, and started my engine. It was going to be a good day, but I was still kind of stressed out from just talking to a girl. I could still get some sleep at home, and I'd be all good for dinner with Ashley tonight.

Rule 1: Basically, no porn. Swearing is allowed, but with restrictions. I don't want over the top swearing, so only use shit, ass, damn, or fuck. And if you can't stand those, just ask and I'll come up with stand-ins for swear words. This rule also states that you should warn people if there is swearing in your post.

Rule 2: Don't downvote people because they're doing the thing this sub is about. This sub is for complaining about FNaF, so please only downvote or report if the complaint is *not* FNaF related. Also, you can complain about anything even remotely FNaF related. You can complain about how much you suck at the games, you can complain about the mods on /r/fivenightsatfreddys (I've fixed my relationship with Kairinezz, so there's nothing here.), or you can complain about the community, or the /r/fivenightsatfreddys users in general. Really, any FNaF sub. Even this one!

Rule 3: Follow reddiquette! This should be pretty simple. If you don't know your reddiquette, there's a link every time you write a comment or a post.

Rule 4: If people find you annoying, you're gonna have to deal with the complaints. You can argue, but don't go over the top with it. Find some ground to stand on. If that doesn't work, then go ahead and use the approved swearwords! But, like I said, you can't go around reporting people just because you were an ass on /r/fivenightsatfreddys or /r/fnaf or whatever.

Rule 5: Respect the mods, but only to a certain extent. /u/SmileyAja and I will both respect you, and your complaints, but you still have to listen. (Right, SmileyAja?) If you feel that we are making an unreasonable request, then feel free and argue, or even make another post complaining about how mean we were. As long as you don't violate the rules (Rule 3 can be broken at times), we won't come after you. You can always ask to get the rules changed if you feel that they're unreasonable.

I'll keep this post up so you guys know the specifics of the rules

Saber walked over to the door and growled. It was a simple steel door, but his scanners told him that it was reinforced with titanium.

 As I walked outside, I sighed. The job was tiring, but at least it was good work. Minimum wage was good. The actual work was good, too. Even though a lot of it was just hauling the animatronics back to the stage after my shift.

  But, I liked it. Physical labor was kind of my thing, so I was really surprised when I liked the desk job so much. There was manual labor after the shift, as at least one of the Toys would move off the Stage and sort of wander around, and even more rarely, one of the old suits would come out of the Services room.

  The old suits were an effort to move back. They had really heavy endoskeletons. At least the newer suits were significantly lighter. I had to hoist them back up on the Stage, so it was good that they were lighter.

  The worst one was the old Freddy suit. I don't know why it was so much heavier, especially with all the missing parts. But it still was, and there wasn't anything I could do about it.

  As I sat down against the wall, I pulled out a pack of fruit snacks from my pocket.

  ""Tasty, tasty fruit snacks,"" I muttered.

  I popped open the packet of fruit snacks, and put one in my mouth. It was really good. I had always loved fruit snacks. They were, honestly, my favorite food. Any kind of fruit snacks. Cheap ones were even better, 'cause they were usually a little stale. Harder fruit snacks were always best.

  Ah well, these were pretty fresh. I was kind of disappointed, but they were still good. I was happy. I had a good job, I had good fruit snacks, and I had a good life.

  I finished my fruit snacks and stood back up. I was quiet for about 30 seconds, then said, ""Tasty, tasty fruit snacks.""

  After another two minutes, I headed back inside to pick up my keys. I really should have grabbed them before I went outside, but it wasn't such a big deal. A little bit of extra walking was never bad.

  As I arrived in my office, I smiled at the messy desk and the yellow lights. It wasn't the best, but it made me happy.

  The only thing that could be better was my cleaning skills. I picked up the empty cup on my desk and threw it in the trash can. At least the desk was a little better. I had an old Fredbear plush from the original restaurant on my desk, and I picked it up and hugged it. It was adorable. I loved it. every once in a while, in the dark building, I thought I saw its eyes glow, but it was all just a trick of the light. That thing was just so cute.

  I put the plush in my messenger bag, and slung it over my shoulder. The only other things in the bag were a large drawing notebook and a few charcoal pencils. The pencils were nicely wrapped up in a piece of cloth and placed inside a small wooden pencil case.

  The reason I had brought my drawing materials was because the Management had agreed to let me turn off the animatronics every once in a while to do some sketches. They wanted new posters, and it turns out that I was the best at drawing in the building. But, it was a good opportunity. I had jumped at the chance to practice my drawing skills on actual animatronics, but it wasn't as fun as I was hoping. The Management told me how to draw the animatronics. They wanted each animatronic to be in a certain position and they ""Did not want it changed"". So is life.

  I walked out of my office and watched as the lights flickered on, coming from down the hallway. Somebody must have showed up.

  ""Hello?"" I asked.

  ""Hey hey hey!"" A voice said. I had never been good with recognizing voices, but this sounded a little bit like Ashley, one of the day-workers.

  ""Ashley?"" I called out.

  ""Yup, you've got it!"" Ashley leaned around the corner and waved at me.

  Ashley was very pretty, but I knew that I would never get to know her. We worked entirely different shifts, and she was far out of my league, even as a friend. Her long, curly red hair was tied back in a ponytail, but it still flowed as gracefully as water. Her jade green eyes flickered in the ambiguous lighting, and she constantly smiled. She worked out in the Dining Area, so she was around a lot of kids. Even if the kids were being annoying, she would smile and gently guide them back to being happy.

  I think I might need to make an adjustment from my earlier statement. She was beautiful. I don't even know how she brought herself to give me words from her perpetually smiling pink lips.

  She was tall, too. Not absurdly tall, but she was maybe 5' 11. I wasn't told her height, or anything, but it seemed like a reasonable estimate. Maybe she wasn't 5' 11. I'm not even sure about my estimate anymore. But, the point was, she was tall.

  ""Hey, Jeremy,"" Ashley said.

  ""Hi,"" I muttered.

  ""Oh, come on. Lighten up.""

  ""I'm perfectly fine.""

  ""No, you're not. You seem mopey."" Ashley started walking down the hallway, and I stumbled backwards into my office. ""Y'know what, my shift doesn't start for another hour. Do you want to go out for coffee?""

  I was silent for about ten seconds, shocked. Ashley, not just talking to me, but, asking me on a date? Well, I suppose it wasn't a date, just two friends, going for coffee, but that meant that I, the weird, geeky night guard, had a friend.

  ""Yeah, sure,"" I said.

  ""Great,"" Ashley said, smiling.

  But, here's the story. In case you ever do get around to reading it.

  When I started middle school, I lost all but one of my friends. They all went to other schools, had different classes than I did, or just became jerks. The one I had mostly read the entire day, so I had little chance to talk to her.

  At lunch, they assigned us seats, but when that ended, I didn't have any place to sit, so I ended up begging other people to let me sit with them.

  I did eventually manage to find a spot I could sit at consistently, but that's not the point.

  I met the first friend in tennis. I never got a partner, so I ended up playing with the people who's partners were sick, or just couldn't come.

  When I first met my future best friend, I didn't think much of it. We ended up playing a tennis match together, and lost, but didn't really talk much. She mentioned the, then unknown to me, new horror game Five Nights at Freddy's. I'd seen a few gameplay videos of it in my ""Recommended"" on YouTube, but not any actual gameplay. At that point, I wasn't a huge fan of horror games.

  Because of her recommendation, I went and found the trailer for the first Five Nights at Freddy's, and was instantly hooked. Even just from the trailer, I was hooked. So I went and watched a full series of gameplay videos, and was astounded.

  I knew I wanted to play the game myself, and got it on mobile, since my computer's a Mac.

  Like I said, when I was first introduced to Five Nights at Freddy's, I tried to avoid scary games as much as possible, so I bought the cheats. I quickly ran through the entire game, using the cheats, and considered the game done with.

  That was when I discovered the lore.

  By then, tennis had ended, and I wasn't sure how to find the friend. I learned that she was in my history class, and we quickly bonded over FIve Nights at Freddy's.

  I had made a friend.

  The second friend I made accidentally, sort of like I assume the first friend did with me.

  I was bored, waiting for gym, and talked to the person next to me. I said something about Five Nights at Freddy's, and she got excited.

  She knew the game, and we talked about it until gym started. I had made a second friend.

  I ended up making a kind of crappy fan game, which I made in a D&amp;D style. You used dice to see if the animatronics move, and if the night guard decides to check the camera, or notices that Bonnie, or whoever, is in the doorway. All three of us ended up playing it on a regular basis, and I bonded with them.

  So, that was all to say thank you, Mr. Cawthon. I can't possibly overstate that. I owe my friendships to you, and your games. So, even if you don't read this, I'll have at least sent it, me saying the things I needed to say to you in your general direction.

  If you did read this, thank you again. This isn't just some ploy to get more Five Nights at Freddy's games out of you. I don't know what to think about the series ending. But, I don't think it really matters, weather the series goes on or ends. The main thing, at this point, is that all the loose ends get tied up.

  Again, thank you. For all you, and subsequently, your games, have done for me.


  EDIT: I sent this to fazbearhelp@yahoo.com. Do you think it will get through to him?


  2nd EDIT: I don't know why this is a question. Sorry about that :)

In this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows. Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.

You have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end.

Okay, so there's the description I'd like to point out a few things here.

The 1st part: We knew this already, just based off of the trailer.

The 2nd part: The last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's *original* story, does that mean Scott might do a spin off of the game?

So it says that we have to defend ourselves against the four animatronics that were introduced in the first game, and even wore things. What does even worse mean? I would assume that means Plushtrap and the Freddles are going to be even bigger threats than Freddy, who will presumably fill the role he did in the 1st game, following a set path and sneaking into your office. That will be bad.

Playing as a child. This means that these characters may truly be a dream, as they, even in the 2nd game, wouldn't attack children.

We now know the game will only be to 6am, as in the previous titles. However, we don't know the starting time yet. We can assume that we'll be starting at midnight. If he wakes up anytime before 11pm, his parents would still be up.

We knew all of this part already, just from the trailer.

The 3rd part: Only have a flashlight? Does this mean we won't be able to close the doors? Even though the trailer said we could, only having a flashlight to protect ourselves makes it sound like the doors can't be closed.

If it scares away things at the far ends of hallways, we can assume that it will be a FNaF 2 Foxy tactic. The animatronics would reset and go away for a little while. However, we aren't told if this will work on the Freddles, who appear on the bed, or Foxy, in the closet. The only two we know this will work on, from the trailer, are Chica and Bonnie.

This last part just says you'll die if you let them get too close. But, shining lights? This probably means that the souls of the children are still trapped. Were the Nightmare suits the suits the children were in? Or is this a prequel to FNaF 3? Maybe a bit like the Borderlands Pre-Sequel? (I know this is a FNaF reddit page, I'm using it as an analogy)

So there's my analysis. Hope it shines some light on FNaF 4 for you guys.

  The Friday the 13th movies are a staple of the horror genre, just like FNaF has become.
  The 4th installment of each of these series has the subtitle ""The Final Chapter"".
  However, Friday the 13th continues with several installments. The 5th movie is ""A New Beginning"".
  Could there be a new beginning with Five Nights at Freddy's?
