4,"At work there is one guy in particular who wants to touch them and then asks me if i crush eggs in them to get them to look this way. Uh, what? Then he starts talking to me in a rasta voice. Its quite annoying. Other people call me hippie. But its literally just a hair style. I like it and think its gorgeous and it literally took away my shedding and hairball problem lol. I have never felt more ""me"" than in my dreads.",2016-04-22 04:21:21+00:00,d2coklq,1,t3_4fkz8p,182566,Dreadlocks
5,"I started my own dreads, and two months in went and had salon maintenance done on them. I honestly think that doing them first made my dreads more uniquely mine because they had time to lock up some and get all loopy and get their own natural character. The salon maintenance was merely to help pull the dreads apart that were starting to velcro and mat together and tighten the roots a bit to neaten them up because I work in an office, but the bodies of the dreads were left alone to do their own thing and I am totally loving them with no regrets :) I told the dreadologist, ""I love my loopiness!"" So I suggest doing your own dreads first and then going to a salon to simply maintain the roots a couple times a year.",2016-04-22 04:11:22+00:00,d2co97c,1,t3_4fvy5t,14295,Dreadlocks
