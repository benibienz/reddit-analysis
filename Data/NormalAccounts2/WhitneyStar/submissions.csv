Its a constant rage that burns inside me. Runs through my veins. Trying not to snap at those I love or holding back an irritated, impatient sigh is a HUGE task. I don't care about conversations with anyone. I don't want to be alone and I do want to be alone at the same time. My fiance irritates the shit out of me. I have purposely bashed my head into the wall before in a tantrum, literally, and it didn't even hurt because I was so full of rage. I am so tired and exhausted from being angry. I want to enjoy life. But it is a struggle to even smile. And this isn't me looking for a pity party. This is the fucking truth and how life is for me everyday. And I cant just turn it on and off. I wish I could though. So sick of this. I am not in medication and have refused medication for it for a long time but I am almost to the point of wanting to get a prescription. I cant take this anymore.",Anger,I'm so tired of being angry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/4zs93u/im_so_tired_of_being_angry/
