0,"Kaldon plucked at a patch of crusty scales along the edge of his leathery wings and sighed. ""I thought you said we were just taking the first halfway decent applicant and calling it a day?""

Lucifer Morningstar rolled his eyes and licked his thin, red lips. They were together in a room of brimstone, black smoke, and floating flames, Kaldon seated on a glowing, orange rock and Lucifer pacing calmly about the perimeter. 

""I presumed halfway decent was the best we would do,"" said Lucifer. ""Clearly, I underestimated the market.""

""Remember, it's temporary,"" scowled Kaldon. ""Two weeks. Maybe three. I'll be right back and ready to attend my duties.""

""Yes, yes,"" said Lucifer. ""I'm not *replacing* you.""

""Riiiight,"" said Kaldon. ""So... who's the choice?""

""You know... I don't know yet,"" said Lucifer. ""They were all so *evil*. I really didn't expect that. I should really do more outside hiring...""

""So you can't go wrong,"" said Kaldon, popping off the rock and hovering in the orange and black air, supported by the wide sweep of his gray-green wings. ""C'mon, boss. Just pick one.""

""No,"" said Lucifer decisively. ""No. I've a better idea. I will pit them against one another. The winner - the last one standing - *they* shall be my new assistant.""

""*Temporary*,"" said Kaldon quickly. ""New temporary assistant. And you really think they'll go for that? Killing each other - for a temp job?""

""I really can't emphasize enough how poor the jobs market is,"" said Lucifer. He snapped his fingers. ""Prepare the Blood Arena!""

""Just as long as we're clear that the *temp* assistant will be the one cleaning it,"" said Kaldon in a small voice as he flew out of the room. Lucifer took the opposite door and found himself in a small amphitheater, filled with a multicultural cross-section of humanity. 

""Hey, there is he!"" shouted a man near the back of the theater. ""What's the deal? Who gets the job?""

Lucifer swirled his finger lazily. A jagged, obsidian pulpit spewed upward from the floor. Lucifer rested an elbow upon the ragged black surface. ""Well here's the trouble,"" he said. ""Many of you are rather *bad* boys and girls. But it's really quite difficult to tell which of you is the worst of the worst. And that's really what I'm looking for. The worst of the worst of the *worst*.""

""That's me!"" crowed a woman in the front row. She had beaded hair and a thick coating of a white, pancake make-up. ""I eat babies,"" she said conversationally. ""I like Chinese babies best, but I'm always hungry again 30 minutes later."" She wailed with laughter at her own joke, showing off two rows of filed down, v-shaped shark teeth. ""Chomp chomp chomp!""

""Yes, I remember the interview..."" said Lucifer. ""No, my idea is...""

""I'm the bloody worst!"" shouted a man loitering in the aisles. ""I violate corpses. Eh? Dig 'em up and have my way. Saw off their fingers and stuff 'em up my...""

""Yes, I *also* remember your interview,"" said Lucifer with open disgust. ""Let's not rehash all that. Here's the thing. Down here, there is no empathy. There is no kindness. The strong rule, and the weak suffer. That's really the only rule. And you all want to sit at my right hand...""

""*Temporarily*"" came Kaldon's voice from some distant chamber.

""Sit at my right hand and enjoy the spoils of Hell,"" said Lucifer. ""Well, you must earn that right. You must be willing to lose all in order to gain all. So what I propose is this...""

""Why don't we just kill him?"" 

Lucifer blinked. ""Who said that?""

A little girl in a pale pink set of overalls stood up in her seat. ""Why don't we just kill him? And then we're in charge and he's dead.""

""Little girl...er...*Katie*? I believe it was?"" Lucifer stepped out from behind his pulpit. ""This is Hell and I am the Devil. You are all living souls temporarily granted admission. Do you honestly believe that a mortal such as yourself could do me any harm in this place?""

Katie shrugged. ""I think we should try.""

""I was going to suggest that you all fight to the deAHHHH - OOW!"" Lucifer cried out in agony. The baby-eater was there, gnawing on his shoulder. Black steam hissed from the places where her filed teeth had pierced his jacket. Lucifer put a hand to her head. Her face glowed briefly orange, than exploded in a gout of fire and gore.

""She hurt him,"" said the little girl, a small smile playing out across her lips. ""Kill him.""

Lucifer allowed himself a moment of disbelief. Having seen what had happened to the baby-eater, surely no one would...

But no. They came. 

With a snap of his fingers, Lucifer split open the floor of the amphitheater, which cracked wide, red, and boiling with heat. Some of the first wave fell into the opening, there bodies exploding on impact with the red river below. 

The first man across had blades buried in the skin of his hands. On Earth he'd used these hidden blades to quietly cut the throats of strangers in public, in broad daylight, thrilling in the screams of whoever was unlucky enough to first discover his handiwork. In Hell, he used the blades to slash Lucifer once across the bridge of the nose. Then he was dead, a gaping, dripping hole in his chest, formed in the moment of contact with Lucifer's open palm. 

A man grabbed Lucifer's throat. Lucifer tore his out.

A woman stabbed Lucifer in the calf with a sharpened knitting needle. Lucifer stabbed her in the eye with his thumb.

On they came, slashing and biting and swinging wild. Down they went, torn apart, eviscerated, decapitated, disemboweled. One by one.

Until the screaming had stopped. And the howling. And the cursing.

The room was split in two by that flowing river of red. 

Kaldon swooped into the room. ""Okay, so the Blood Arena is a little slippery right now, because I mopped the... holy *shit*! What happened??""

Lucifer straightened out the lines of his tailored suit. ""We're done here."" He pointed across the ravine of fire, to the remaining seats. ""This is Katie. She's the new temp.""

Kaldon blinked through the haze. A little girl in pink overalls waved. ""Hi. I'm Katie."" 

Uncertainly, Kaldon waved back. ""Uh. Welcome to the team?""  ",2016-11-21 21:42:23+00:00,daa37s5,1.0,t3_5e6g3q,3069.0,WritingPrompts
1,"Kate - 

I'm not good with the math, but if I remember what Rivera told me about these cross-vector drops, by the time you read this I'll probably be some combination of five years older, fiver years wiser, or dead. But still, I hope you get this. The idea that I'm writing these words and some other human being will read them is an almost perversely comforting thought. I guess that shows just how lonely things have become.

So, the search. 

It's fascinating, in a way. If I can detach myself from the reality of what it all means and just appreciate things as an outside observer, it's really very interesting. There is nothing out here, Kate. And, simultaneously, it's clear that there was *so much* out here. 

Barron-Coleidus, for example, seemed as likely a place as any. Orbital placement, size, star age, the works. Then we got there and - perfect atmosphere. Truly perfect. Rivera couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. I was coding up the signal before we'd even landed. I was ready to send out the call. *We found it! We found it! We're not alone anymore!*

But, obviously...

It was wiped. Clean. There were a few signs of a comeback by then; a few single-cells here and there. I'm sure if we pop back in in a million or so years, it'll be a party. But for now, it's a no.

And yes - we've been there before, too.

We set three arc-sites, and went pretty deep. The signs were all there. Way below. Architecture. Tools. Remains. Nearly fossilized. I brought a finger back with me. For science. 

They'd been there for thousands of years. And they'd been gone for thousands of years. Why are there no records, Kate? Who are these proto-explorers? They must have come from Earth, but *when*? 

This is what we've seen, over and over. Inky, black nothingness, broken occasionally by these little white-blue specks of hope... which ultimately amount to more nothingness. I don't think we were wrong to split up. I still see how imperative it is that we find that flickering spark of life out here in the darkness, but... I don't know. I suppose I'm losing hope.

Rivera lost hope. Or maybe just his mind. I keep him sedated these days, for his safety and mine. After years of this fruitless searching - of finding fresh planets churned to dust by long-dead human settlers - he became quite fond of his so-called ""Plague Theory"". He lost interest in finding life among the stars and became completely obsessed with the notion of discovering the ""source"". In Rivera's mind, Earth is no different than Barron-Coleidus or any of the other three dozen sterilized planets we have visited. Humanity, according to Rivera, is a plague of a sort, but Earth is not Patient Zero, so to speak. Earth is just a victim, the same as all the rest. A corrupted cell, used to expand and corrupt further cells. Nothing more, nothing less.

Rivera wants to find the source - where it all started from. What would that *be*? I can't fathom this line of thinking. He thinks of the source as his ""true"" home, but that's not how plagues work. 

Sometimes he pivots. He suggests that we are not a plague, but a flood. Meant to cleanse, not destroy. Unless with a divine purpose. Not random, but directed. And in those moments, he is very keen to know who is God, who is Noah, and who the chosen ones might be. Who gets to survive the flood?

It's all wild and scattered and nonsensical. And too much. Thus, the sedatives. But, as the galaxy thins before me and my life bleeds out in milliseconds, I can't help but wonder what the point of it really is. If humanity is a plague, we have just about burned ourselves out, and very soon, nothing will be left. But if we are a flood, that is at least a noble sort of destruction. A clean cosmos, ready for the arrival of the trueborn. We will have served a purpose, at least. That has to count for something.

It's silly, I know. But just like the act of writing a letter no one may ever read, we must all find our comfort where we may.

In truth, I'm running out of sedatives. And - embarrassing as it is to write this - I think I'm going let Rivera regain himself and take control of the ship. I'll let him chart the course from now on. Towards the ""source"" or God or wherever the hell he thinks we ought to go. Because I'm really not convinced I know any better than him. And I'm certainly not convinced that his new mission is any more or less reasonable than the one we've been chasing all these years. 

So there you go. A corrupted cell turns back.   

Wherever you are, Kate, I hope you found what you were looking for. Or I hope you stopped and decided to look for something else. Or maybe just stopped looking altogether. Just stopped and decided to live with what you had. Maybe the looking was the problem all along. 

Sorry. This isn't a very good letter, but I'm sending it anyway. 

Good luck. See you when I see you.",2016-11-18 15:10:04+00:00,da5pccv,1.0,t3_5dm0ct,11744.0,WritingPrompts

3,"Red and Bobby hustled through the gold and red maze of pillars, velvet chairs, and whirring slot machines, Red in the lead, Bobby hanging on by a pinky finger.

""It's so *loud*!"" Bobby shouted over the jangling toots and tweets of won and lost games, of dealers calling cards and short-skirted women selling drinks and cigarettes. He jammed his free hand over his ear, but it made no difference.

""This is it! This is it!"" said Red, pulling Bobby up, pointing ahead down a line of circular tables, surrounded by moats of low-slung men in old clothes and wreaths made of tobacco smoke. ""Like I saw it! Just like I saw it in my dream.""

They called it roulette. A French game, for sophisticated men. Bobby watched closely as Red pulled him closer and closer to the table. A long table with a spinning wheel at the center and a grass green covering lined over with numbers and colors. Red lifted Bobby up as the wheel spun and a silver ball danced out, skipping and jumping and rolling across the perimeter of the wheel.

""Like I saw it!"" said Red, dumb with joy, squeezing Bobby across the middle just a hair too tightly. ""This is it. This is where it happens.""

Bobby nodded, struggling out of his father's arms, down to the floor. He stepped forward and put his hands on the wood. It was smooth as glass. Glossy and fine. 

Red pulled a roll of bills out of his pocket. Even Bobby could see his hands were shaking. Red stepped toward the table, arms outstretched, like he was bringing a babe to baptism. The men at the table looked at him, then looked back down at the table and the work before them. A man in a white shirt and red vest pointed across the casino floor. ""Chips, sir,"" he said - a warning, a command, but certainly not an invitation. ""Chips only.""

Red bowed, low and deep, and stumbled away across the casino, leaving Bobby behind. Bobby picked at the carved lines in the rim of the table, feeling the eyes of those tired, slouched men, but ignoring them. Waiting for his father. 

Red came back invigorated, clinking plastic chips in his hands. It was a small pile. Even Bobby could see that. But Red swooped to the table, eyes bright, mouth pressed in a crooked smile. He watched. He learned. Every now and then he looked down at Bobby and winked. ""This is how I remember it. How I saw it. We just gotta wait. Wait for the right moment.""

Bobby waited. And so did Red. At one point, a woman in a black dress bumped into Bobby, knocking him down. But no one said anything, and Bobby just got back to his feet.

""Ready?"" said Red suddenly.

Bobby blinked. ""Huh?""

""I just remembered,"" said Red, swallowing as he rolled the chips in his hands nervously. ""It wasn't me. It wasn't. It was you. *You* did it."" He lined the chips up into a neat stack and pressed them into Bobby's hands. Even Bobby was surprised at how well they fit in his little hands. 

""It's all on you,"" said Red, lifting Bobby up onto his hip, hanging the boy up over the table. ""I know you can do it. I saw it. Yes, I did. I saw you do it. This is why we're here. Everything on one roll, okay? That's how you did it in my dream, right? Go ahead. Go ahead and put it all down on the square you want. That's how it happened. That's how we won.""

Red was squeezing too hard again. Bobby couldn't ignore the looks this time. The men were all staring at him. Waiting for something. Waiting for Bobby to choose.

""All on one,"" said Red, urgently, squeezing just a little tighter. ""That's how we do it. That's how we win big.""

""But I don't...""

""Bets down,"" said the man in the vest. Red shook the boy. 

""Now, Bobby! *Now*!""

Bobby dropped the stack on the table. Six. His age. The only number that felt like it meant something.

The wheel spun. Red didn't let go. Just kept squeezing and squeezing. 

The wheel spun and the silver ball popped out. It danced and skipped. Bobby couldn't even find the *6* on the wheel. Maybe they didn't use that number. Maybe. 

The wheel slowed down. The ball slowed down. Red squeezed even harder. So hard, Bobby thought he might faint.

The ball stopped. Dropped. Settled in. 

Black 33.

The world stopped, too, but only for Bobby and only for Red. The man in the vest gathered up Red's chips. Some men got more chips, others lost chips. The game went on. 

Bobby was breathing and so was Red. Slowly, so slowly, the fog started to lift.

""Why six?"" whispered Red, setting Bobby back down on the floor. ""Why six? You didn't pick six in my dream.""

Bobby shook his head. ""I'm six. It was... it was all I could think.""

Red closed his eyes. ""You ain't six, Bobby. You *ain't*. Why'd you do that? Do you know what you did? Why'd you do it? You ain't six, okay? You ain't six!""

Bobby couldn't think what to say. Couldn't see what he'd done wrong, but knew just as clear that he'd done something wrong. ""Six in April,"" he said. ""I turned...""

""*You ain't six!*"" roared Red, shoving the boy to the ground. Some men looked. Some of the women in short skirts looked. No one did anything. ""I *saw* you win. You won. That's what was supposed to happen. That was all our money, Bobby. That was it. Why'd you pick six, Bobby? Why'd you do it? Why you so mean? Why you so mean and so stupid? Huh? You ain't six, Bobby. You ain't.""

Red clenched his fists. Bobby knew what happened next, but he didn't actually, because Red just walked away. Out into the maze of red and gold. Into the noise and the swirl of people and smoke. Red walked away. And Bobby sat next to the roulette table, where the men now went out of their way not to look at him. 

The carpet was red and gold. Bobby absently traced the line of a flower in the weave. Then he saw something just there, where the bottom lip of the table turned to shadow. A chip. One chip. Bobby picked it up. He would give it to his father when his father returned. They had something now. Not nothing. And maybe Red would play it this time, like in his dream - his first dream, the one he told Bobby about on the bus over. The one where he won and they had money and they bought good food and a good house and Bobby's mother got that medicine they all said she needed, but never got. That was a good dream. Bobby wanted his father to come back, if only to hear that dream again.

But Red didn't come back. And he didn't come back. And he didn't come back.

Bobby couldn't see what came next. He'd been living his father's dream for as long as he could remember. He felt he was too young to have his own dreams. Too young to make those dreams come true, like his father had tried to do.

So he stood up. He couldn't see over the table. He couldn't see the board. He held up his chip and poked the man in front of him.

""Six, please,"" he said, in a voice loud enough to cut through the clatter. ""That's how old I am.""",2016-11-08 14:54:59+00:00,d9r3s58,1.0,t3_5bstms,10112.0,WritingPrompts
4,"Shanna flexed her hands - her hands which had been glued to the bike handles - the bike which had been blazing down Charleston - Charleston which had been a bright, red blaze of heat and noise...

Shanna flexed her hands and sat up. A man was standing over her, crinkling his nose like he was about to sneeze. He stuffed his face into the crook of his left elbow while he held out his right hand. ""Need a-ah-ah-*CHOO*... hand?"" he said, sniffling and wriggling his free hand like a worm on a hook.

""What happened"" said Shanna, refusing the hand and rolling up to her feet. She felt heat on her cheeks, but it was just a memory. Her flesh was damp and cold.

""Um,"" said the man, clearing his throat and wiping his nose. ""So listen. There's a few things you need to know. First, you're dead. Now, now - don't look at me like that! You've got to let me finish. Because you're dead, but also, it gets a little bit worse.""

Shanna blinked, then frowned, blustering past the man. ""Loon,"" she grunted, looking up and down, hoping to gather her bearings. The ground was gray and so was the sky, like an empty rain cloud had just washed down over everything. Everything looked the same in all directions. There was no bike and this was not Charleston Street.

""I...*we* need your help,"" said the man, who hadn't moved, but was still the same distance away, no matter how many meaningful steps Shanna took in the opposite direction. ""It's really rather urgent.""

Shanna ran. She just needed to clear the fog, then she would see where she was. Just one street sign. One familiar house. That's all she needed. Something had happened. That was certain. Fire and heat and noise. Then nothing. And now this. If she ran far enough she would find something that told her *something* and then she would...

Panting, Shanna stopped and spun around. The man was still there. He clearly hadn't moved. ""Are you ready to-to-tooo *CHOO* ...listen now?""

Shanna clenched her fists. ""What are you doing to me? What's happening?""

The man smiled, a brief, nervous smile. ""Yes. Shanna Didadio, correct?"" Shanna nodded. ""Ah, good. So. As I said - you're dead.""

Shanna rolled her eyes. ""C'mon! I'm here. Talking to you. I'm clearly not dead, so stop messing with me.""

""Oh no no-oh-oh-ah-*CHOO*!"" The man retrieved a handkerchief for his back pocket and blew his nose. ""Pardon. No. You *are* dead. One of you is dead. The you that is here, talking to me now, is dead.""

""That would..."" Shanna shook her head. ""I feel like you're implying that there are more than one of me.""

""Yes!"" said the man, clapping with joy. ""Exactly. Oh, that's usually the hardest part to explain. Excellent. There are *infinite* you's. The you you I'm talking to is dead. There are other you's who are not dead. See?""

Shanna took a calming breath. ""This is a very agitating dream I'm having.""

""We are talking now, because I...*we* ...we need your help."" The man nervously patted his chest, right above where one would assume his heart to be. ""There is a you that survived what you did not survive. I could not... *we* could not speak to that you... because it lived. See?""

""Not even a little.""

""You are here because you died,"" said the man. ""They are there because they did not die. I propose that you should switch places. You will be this other Shanna - the one that survived - and that Shanna will come here.""

Shanna considered running again, but instead plopped down onto the ground, defeated by rising insanity. ""Sure. Okay. Great. Why is that worse?""

""Ah,"" said the man. ""Because-ah-ah-*CHOO!* Because there is work to do, and it will not be easy.""

""*Work*?""

""Don't you wonder what happened? The explosion? The how and the why of it all?""

Shanna did wonder. She nodded. 

""We send you back not as a mercy,"" said the man, almost sadly. ""But tasked with something very, very great. Something only you can do. Something very difficult. We need you to succeed, Shanna. It is vitally important.""

Shanna sat up. ""Why me?""

The man shrugged. ""I wish I could explain. Even I do not know why fate has chosen you. It may simply be that you are the right person at the right time in the right place. But we know with all certainty, it must be you.""

The world was gray and suffocating. Shanna considered her options and saw that she had none. ""I guess I'll try my best.""

""Better than that,"" said the man, his voice almost pained. ""I...*we* are not supposed to say this, but... I said before that there are infinite Shanna Didadios and this is true, but... there are not infinite versions of you that survived this moment. In fact, there are very few. And more to the point, we have done this before. Many times. And... you have failed.""

Shanna felt that familiar heat rising up against her cheeks once more. ""So, that...?""

""This is the last,"" said the man. ""After this, there will be no more chances. After this, there are no more Shannas. This is it.""

Nothing changed, but the air seemed colder. Shanna hugged her arms to her chest. ""What do I do?""

The man smiled and closed his eyes. ""Listen very, very closely...""  ",2016-11-07 15:12:53+00:00,d9pltzs,1.0,t3_5bm185,7511.0,WritingPrompts

7,"""It's the fourth sorority house hit this month, for christ's sake! I don't want guesses, I want answers! Get me Depot!""

Landesman punctuated the request by exploding his coffee mug against the back wall of his office. The mug had said *FBI'S MOST HAUNTED*. The temper tantrum had been a ruse to cover the destruction of the mug, which he'd hated. As a bonus, it got him what he wanted in a hurry.

Steve Depot slouched into the room, bleary-eyed and resentful. ""It's 3am. What's the big rush?""

""We got a real bad dude out there, Depot,"" said Landesman. ""Attacking college girls. Sorority girls specifically. Pokes two little holes into their necks. Drains the blood. A real sicko. We've taken to calling him *The Double Neck Holer*.""

""Catchy,"" said Depot sourly. ""What's it got to do with me?""

""He's too clever for us,"" said Landesman. ""Every time we try a sting, he smells it out. Always hits where we aren't. Never leaves a clue. Disappears like a goddamn bat in the night. Obviously we're stumped.""

""I'm still not seeing where I fit in all this.""

""Full moon tomorrow, Depot,"" said Landesman with obvious distaste. ""We need you. Again.""

Depot shook his head. ""I'm out, remember? I told you I was out after that last time.""

""Right. I know. Things got a little weird there...""

""*A little weird*? You made me turn into a gingerbread house, Ray. A goddamn gingerbread house!""

Landesman straightened his tie awkwardly. ""Just going by the M.O., Depot. You know that. That's where we found the victim.""

""Yeah, in a goddamn *oven*!""

""You solved the case, Depot,"" said Landesman. ""That's all that matters. That roasted old woman can rest easy knowing those sickos are rotting away in jail.""

""They were *children*, Ray!"" shouted Depot. ""And they both *bit* me - *repeatedly*. I got a hole in my ass the size of a baby's fist, Ray! You know that? I gotta sit on a wadded up gym sock or else I'm gonna develop scoliosis.""

""This'll be different. I promise. No harm. No danger. But we're hurtin' here, Steve. Okay? We're hurtin'. And it's a full moon tomorrow, so...?""

Depot rolled his eyes. ""Fucking goddamnit. Fine. Just tell me what you want me to do.""

Some twenty hours later the change began. It was always different. That was the one benefit - at least he could enjoy a little variety to his curse. Something new everything month. 

But no matter what, one thing always remained the same - it hurt like hell.

""Quit whining,"" hissed Landesman over the walkie-talkie. ""You're creepin' out the girls.""

""My balls are *literally* turning into a linen closet and a mud room right now,"" growled Depot in a half-human voice. ""Have you ever morphed your right forearm into a master bedroom? No? Well, *shut the fuck up*.""

Landesman set down his receiver. ""That seems fair,"" he muttered to no one in particular. 

In took twenty minutes for the change to be complete. 

""Alright, girls,"" said Landesman. ""Remodel's complete. Kappa Mocha Kappa's open for business.""

Fifteen girls in their late teens wandered inside the new, slightly familiar house.

""Wait,"" grunted Depot into the walkie-talkie. ""Do they know they're bait?""

""It's implied,"" said Landesman quickly. ""Just watch and tell me what you see.""

""At the moment I see exactly zero naked pillow fights,"" said Depot. ""And nothing else of...wait. Someone just came up to the door.""

Landesman held up his finger. ""Is it him? Is it the perp?""

""How should I...it's a *guy*. He's got... you know... pants... long-sleeve shirt...""

Landesman motioned for an underling. ""We got any intel on the perp's preferred sleeve length.?"" The underling shook her head. ""Well, fucking *great*.""

""I think it's someone's boyfriend,"" said Depot. ""He's wearing a cape. Do kids wear capes these days? Is that a thing?""

""Probably,"" said Landesman. ""Does he have any needles or straws? Anything he could use to stab someone twice in the neck and then drain their blood?""

""Nothing,"" said Depot. ""I think might be a goth. Very pale.""

""Weakling,"" said Landesman, nodding. ""I think we can cross that one off. Anything else?""

""Well, Meygyn's worried about her weight. I think she looks good and it's probably a healthy weight, but it can't help living with Tara and those six-pack abs, good *lord*.""

""Regarding the case,"" said Landesman.

""Goth kid's definitely getting to second base,"" said Depot. ""Whoa! He has some surprising game. I wish I knew how to - *OH SHIT HE'S DRINKING HER BLOOD. YUP. DEFINITELY DRINKING BLOOD DIRECTLY FROM HER NECK. OH MY GOD THAT'S SO GROSS. OH GOD. OH GOD. OH GOD THE SLURPING SOUND. OOOOOH I'M GONNA BE SICK. YUP. GONNA HURL. OH GOD OH GOD OH G-*""

Officially, as far as anyone knew or will ever know, it was a burst sewer pipe. The line was clogged, the pressure built, and it resulted in an unnaturally large explosion of half-digested waste, destroying the former home of the Kappa Mocha Kappa sorority and causing unimaginable property damage to the surrounding neighborhood.

On the plus side, the pipe explosion very coincidentally incapacitated a man wanted in connection with multiple homicides in the area. Before the man could fully confess to his crimes, however, he burst into flames just as the first rays of morning washed over the crime scene. Experts believe that the spontaneous combustion was likely due to a Vitamin D deficiency. 

But what the records won't show is that once again, when things seemed their bleakest, a strange man with a strange gift was there to save the day. Once again the day was saved by Steve Depot, the world's first and only Were-House.

8,"This is the way of it:

I was with Victor. We had drank and laughed and sang in the streets of old Brust. It was payday and the war was coming. Soon, we knew, there would no longer be nights like this, so free and wild and whole. We knew enough to make the most of the time we had.

Having drank our money and pissed our prize, we danced down the dark, lampless avenues of dear old Brust. Light spilled out from the windows of houses and alehouses and the stars reflected down upon the black puddles that always ran so deep in the choked and pitiless gutters. We were young, but we did not have time. And this is never a good combination.

A wretch of an old man lay sprawled upon a bench where the avenue narrowed and the houses were replaced by creeping forest. Victor kicked the man in the backside and danced away, gulping great swigs of air as he laughed himself red. The man roused and turned.

""Who's there?"" said the old man.

""It's God,"" said Victor, sniffling and teary-eyed with laughter. ""God Himself. Come to claim you. So rise and prepare for judgment!""

The old man swung slow and shaky to his feet. His eyes were pearl white. He frowned and shook his head. ""No, no. God hasn't claimed me among his number for decades long past. I can't see why he'd come now, when nothing's changed.""

""It doesn't matter, does it?"" said Victor, almost upset that the man wasn't angry or scared or any of the things Victor had hoped he'd be. ""It's judgment for you. You've had long enough. Long enough and what's it come to?""

The old man's blind eyes swept across the pair of us. ""Ah. Is that what it is? A boy afraid of death, angry at an old man for not being dead? I couldn't take your place if I wanted to.""

Victor kicked the man again, hard, straight in the chest, in the depths of his soiled wool coat. ""They oughta send you. Stick a gun in your worthless hands and let you march."" Victor spat on the ground. ""What's the sense in it? What's the sense at all?""

I grabbed at Victor's thin coat. ""Let's go,"" I said. ""There's starlight yet. More night for us.""

Victor shrugged me away. 

""Don't be mad at me,"" said the old man. ""It was He who made things this way. Boys like you are little more than lumps of coal in this cold world. Tossed into the fire to keep the young and old warm. Best you can hope is to live long enough to become old men with shovels.""

It was cruel, but honest. I saw that at least. But not Victor. He dove upon the man and set his hands to the blind man's throat. The old man hardly struggled. He made no sound. At least not in that first moment. Because as Victor snarled and struggled against the frail frame of the old man, I turned and ran. 

Down pitch black streets, I ran. Long and wild, I ran. No direction and no particular purpose beyond flight itself. I ran.

By daybreak I was exhausted and ill. I fell down upon the grass of a small hill and pulled off my coat. I tried not to think on what I had seen and what I had done.

I slept.

I awoke with a start, confused and frightened. The day was bright. There were voices. Small, gibbering voices all around me. Children. On the hill?

But I wasn't on the hill. It was a carnival. A trumpet man marched past, joyfully rattling brass. Children ran by. A man on stilts. The smell of butter and roasted lamb. 

I rotated, slowly, as if by the wind. I strained to move, to shift about, but nothing happened. I moved only as the wind allowed.

A crush of colored balloons. All around me. A man in a striped shirt and red vest.

The sun was bright. I was keenly aware of the laughter and the shouts of joy. A feeling of lightness. 

A boy was before me. Blond, flop-haired and round-headed. His teeth were crooked like a rotten fence. He beamed as he pointed at me. I wanted to ask what he wanted, but found I could say nothing. Do nothing. 

The man in the red vest took a coin from the boy and placed it in his pocket. Then I was tugged. Loosened. Dragged through the air by a line of string. The string went into the boy's hand and then he was running. Running hard and fast, across the carnival, across the sun-bleached cobblestones. Towards nothing. Towards no one.

The boy ran and whooped and I danced along behind him.

And it was fine. I did not mind it. I did not begrudge the boy his joy or his power over me. I was a balloon, I realized. A thing of joy. Thin and insubstantial.

Perhaps this was the best I could do. Perhaps it was the best any of us could do.

I stayed with the boy, until his attention drifted and then...I was free again. I floated upwards. Ever upwards. I wondered why this was the best I could do with my freedom. And still I climbed. Towards the sky and the sun and the stars. And down below all of old Brust was laid before me. Bright and crippled and bleeding on all sides. My home. My beautiful home.

I floated past Brust, into strange foreign lands, with strange foreign rivers and strange foreign hills. But still beautiful. Just not as. 

Finally, after how long I do not know, I fell. Far away from Brust. Far away from home. I fell. Limp and floating. Like a feather. I fell.

And that was my dream. Now I wait - I wait to wake up. I wait to go home.

Any moment now.",2016-11-06 14:48:06+00:00,d9o5yyl,1.0,t3_5bfs1l,3744.0,WritingPrompts
9,"The little girl with the pink gown and the round, jaundiced skull, looked up from her mother's iPad. ""Oh. *You*,"" she said, before dropping her eyes back down to the screen.

""Well,"" I said, taking a seat on the opposite side of the rails. ""A bit rude, don't you think?""

""Why shouldn't I be rude to *you*? You're Death, after all.""

I drew back, wounded. ""How dare you?""

She looked up again, mildly interested. ""Aren't you?""

""Not in the least. *Death*? Blech. No, I'm someone else entirely.""

She set down the device. ""Well then, who are you?""

I placed a insubstantial finger against my temple. ""The End.""

She rolled her eyes and grabbed up the iPad. ""Ah. So Death with a dumb name.""

Agitated, I sprang to my feet. ""No! Not Death! That's a totally different thing. Death's a jumped-up chauffeur, ferrying *souls* from one realm to another. He's the Uber driver of the damned, as far as I'm concerned. I am The End. Much different. Even deathless gods hold me in high regard. I'm kind of a big deal.""

""I'm really not getting the concept,"" said the little girl, not looking up.

""The *End*! It's not... it's not that complicated, really. All things end. People. Plants. Animals. Cities. Stories. Relationships. Head colds. *Ideas*. All of it *ends*. And I'm the one that ends them. So... you see? Really not that complex.""

""When are you planning on ending this conversation?"" said the little girl.

I gritted my insubstantial teeth. ""I'd like to end that attitude of yours...""

""Please do,"" said the girl. The flash of the screen reflected off her round, glistening eyes. ""I'm ready whenever you are.""

""Well..."" I cleared my throat. ""As it turns, I am here to end your suffering.""

She shook her head. Now when she refused to look up it seemed less a form of rebellion and more a means by which to keep her emotions under wraps. ""Great. Sounds great. Like I said... I'm ready. But if all you were ever gonna do was kill me, I really wish you would've skipped all the talking before.""

""Oh. Oh no."" I straightened up. ""I'm ending your suffering. Not your life. That's all.""

She looked up, upset and hopeful and scared. ""You...?""

""Well, that's not *all*."" Her face wavered. ""I'm also ending your nihilism, just as a matter of course.""

""I'm eight,"" she said. ""I don't know what that means.""

""Doesn't matter,"" I shrugged. ""Our business is at an end.""

She chuckled sarcastically. ""Good one.""

""That wasn't...oh. Yes.""

Her face was suddenly more red than yellow. She was clutching the iPad so firmly I was worried she may break it. ""Are you saying I'm cured.""

""Oh,"" I said. ""That was the third thing, wasn't it? Your suffering, your belief that life is meaningless, and your cancer. Almost forgot. Those are all ended."" I waved my hands in the air dramatically. ""Tah-dah. *The End*, see?""

She nodded. ""Yeah. I see."" She wiped her eyes with the bed sheets. ""When...when will I see you again?""

I shook my head. ""Again, not Death. I'm not on a schedule. We will meet again, many, many times. Just as we've met before. You just don't remember.""

""Will I remember this time?""

""Probably not, no. But! I do believe you'll remember this at least - you'll remember not to be afraid of me.""

She nodded. ""Yes. I'm sure I'll remember that.""

I moved to the door. ""Places to be,"" I sighed. ""I'm afraid this meeting...""

""Is over,"" said the girl with a smile.

""*Is at an end*,"" I replied with a mock frown. ""Sheesh. Some people."" But my frown slipped into a smile just as I slipped into the air. 

Another moment ended. Another had just begun.   ",2016-11-05 16:14:17+00:00,d9myzco,1.0,t3_5ba6lf,5730.0,WritingPrompts
10,"They found him in the ashes and broken towers of Moreth, stunned and silent, wandering in circles, covered in soot and gorthan blood. He did not speak for weeks, but Kirul the Elder saw plain enough what the boy was.

""The Weryen's apprentice,"" said Kirul, slamming closed a blackened ledger recovered from the deepest basement vault. ""Wuon he's named.""

""Weryen had an apprentice?"" said King Gerun. ""Surely not of his own blood?""

Kirul shook his shaggy, white head. ""A mage boy, no doubt. At a guess, uncommonly powerful. Knowing the Dark Summoner, he likely slaughtered the boy's family as an offering to the Fell Spirits.""

""He's touched by wickedness, then?"" said King Gerun. But Kirul again shook his head.

""I cannot say. He is just a boy. There may be hope for him yet. He is certainly powerful - that no one could deny.""

Gerun immediately saw the way of it. Too dangerous to set free, too innocent to put to death. The great battle-worn king had his man-at-arms deliver the boy to the castle, where he would serve as ward. Gerun and his people would redeem the cursed boy. It was the only way.

Whatever physical or mental damage Wuon had suffered at the hands of the Dark Summoner or during the fall of Moreth was not evident in the months that followed. Wuon was a quiet boy, dusky of skin and thin of frame. He did as he was told and minded his manners dutifully. Kirul once remarked that Weryen, for all his wickedness, certainly favored a refreshing style of personal discipline. 

But the magic was the key to it all, and Wuon had more magic than any of the kingdom's other apprentices (more even than many of the experienced sorcerers and sorceresses). Mage work came easy to the boy. It won him favor with his masters, but not with his peers, and not with the King.

""He is dreadfully powerful,"" said Gerun, watching from afar as the boy practiced the conjuration of minor demons. ""A sorcerer with too much power is a thing to fear. But when it comes in the form of such a young boy?""

Kirul nodded. ""We must watch him closely. His loyalty is with you, your Highness. As long as it remains that way, you will soon have a very powerful ally on your side.""

But Gerun's eyes narrowed even further. ""We are at peace, Elder. What good are powerful allies when I do not have powerful enemies?""

""To cast him out now would be too dangerous,"" said Kirul. ""Unless you wish to...""

""He is still a child,"" said Gerun bitterly. ""And innocent as such. I will not let my restless paranoia drive me to such extreme measures. Just... continue to watch him. And let me know if anything causes you distress.""

So Wuon remained at the castle, under the care and tutelage of the King's experienced sorcerers and sorceresses. But though he was treated cordially, he made no friends. The other apprentices envied him his gifts. The commoners feared those who summoned and commanded demons and other spirit creatures. And the royalty had no interest in anyone besides themselves.

Wuon was alone. 

He did not mind. He had been alone in his village, where everyone had scuttled past in terror of the powerful boy sorcerer. And he had been alone at Moreth, where Weryen had only captured the boy to siphon his essences when needed. To have named him the Dark Summoner's apprentice was simply a cruel joke. 

And though it is common for sorcerers to be alone, it is not healthy. 

It is not healthy to be alone with the demons; to commune with the spirits unsupervised. 

Wuon was brave and surprisingly strong, but his isolation only made him more fearful to others. 

Except to the Princess. Allebei. 

Black-haired and frightfully nimble, Allebei went where she pleased and did as she liked. One day she saw Wuon at practice, using a demon to carve a statue of the King. 

""Beard's not patchy enough,"" said Allebei, springing up on the boy. ""Much too tall, too. You must not see him very often.""

Wuon recognized the girl and dropped to a steep bow. ""Your Highness. I apologize for the poorness of this representation. I was only practicing.""

With a sweep of his hand, the demon smashed the statue to atoms. 

""Oh, no,"" said Allebei, suddenly sheepish. ""I didn't want you to destroy it! I was just being... I'm sorry. It was very nice. Don't listen to me.""

Wuon blinked. ""I don't think I'm allowed to not listen to you.""

Allebei nodded. ""Right. Well, I'm sorry. You shouldn't have listened right then. Okay?""

Wuon smiled. Allebei smiled. They were friends from that moment. Best friends. 

It kept King Gerun up at night.

""What if he asks for her hand?"" he asked his wife, the Queen, Beytho. ""If we spurn him he may become our enemy. He becomes stronger every day.""

Beytho nodded. ""They are friends, so far. I see no reason to worry.""

""You would if he abducted her and dragged her back Moreth,"" growled Gerun.

""Moreth is fallen,"" said Beytho flatly.

""He could raise it up again!"" shouted Gerun. ""His power seems nearly limitless. The masters say they have never seen anything like it.""

""So what do you suggest?""

Gerun closed his eyes. ""We must set things back to right. I was mistaken about the boy. He is not safe to keep. He is not safe at all.""

""He has *done* nothing,"" said Beytho.

""And he never can,"" said Gerun with a heavy note of finality. ""Not ever.""

They took the boy back to Moreth. Gerun and Kirul and a host of knights and sorcerers. Gerun had a story ready, but Wuon never asked where they were going or why. He took it on faith that his king knew what was best. Even as they drew nearer to the still smoldering ruins of Moreth, he kept his faith.

""Your service is ended,"" said Gerun once they had stopped within the gates. ""This is where we found you. This is where we must leave you.""

Wuon opened his mouth, lips moving soundlessly as he tried to understand. ""Why?""

""We treated you with every courtesy,"" said Gerun. ""Remember that.""

""You... you're leaving me here?""

""Do not enter our borders. You are no longer welcome.""

Wuon nodded slowly. ""I was never welcome, though... was I?""

""We tried our best,"" said Gerun. ""The stain of Weryen is too deep in you. We could kill you now, instead we leave you to live your life as best you can. Remember that, as well. This is our mercy. Should you approach our borders that mercy will dissolve and you will be our enemy.""

""Am I not already your enemy?"" said Wuon, his voice thick with a sadness he could not manage to stow away. 

""Stay away,"" said Gerun. ""That is all.""

They rode away from the ruins, Gerun and Kirul riding side by side. ""He watches us,"" said Kirul, glancing back. ""I see a hint of that evil you suspected, your Highness. Just a hint, but it is there.""

Gerun nodded. ""All leaders make mistakes. Great leaders admit theirs and make the necessary corrections.""

""Allebei will be furious.""

""It is for the best,"" said Gerun. ""Even now, I see no other path. No other path at all.""   ",2016-11-03 03:08:50+00:00,d9jf5l2,1.0,t3_5atuno,7566.0,WritingPrompts

Mr. Snitch-Snatch furrowed his shadowy brow. ""I don't think anyone suggested that you...""

""It's not *fair*!"" yelled Carston Merryweather, clutching at his signature rumpled, hand-me-down black and blue checked sweater. ""I never even knew my parents and now everyone expects me to *save the world*? That's too much pressure! It's not fair at all!""

Mr. Snitch-Snatch cleared his throat. ""Sure. I could see that. Listen, did you see the way I possessed your cat Fluffers this morning? When it was hissing at you? With the red eyes? That was me. Did you... that ring any bells?""

""To defeat *you*!"" roared Carston Merryweather.

12,"Vincent gagged on his own blood, then spat out a better part of the blockage onto the dry, yellow scrub. The Shaded Man knelt at Vincent's side. 

*He doesn't see me* said the Shaded Man through a slit of daylight that passed for a mouth. *Only you can hear me.*

Vincent's breath was fast and shallow. His eyes were locked on Medellin, standing over him, knife in one hand, his free hand plucking at the wet nest of black hair that poured from the center of his scalp.

*It's time to die* said the Shaded Man. *He got you. He got you good.*

""Don't wanna,"" whispered Vincent, pink foam frothing up at the corners of his mouth. ""Don't wanna.""

Medellin was silent. He only stood and watched. He was waiting. He knew Vincent too well to go making assumptions about a thing as important as death.

*When I say so, you need to stop breathing* said the Shaded Man, hovering close. Vincent wouldn't look directly at the thing. He only had eyes for Medellin. *Tell your heart what to do and it'll do it. Same for your lungs. Same for all of it. Time to lay down arms. Time to sleep.*

""No,"" said Vincent, his throat wet and strangled. ""Don't wanna.""

The Shaded Man sat back on his black, shadow heels. *I don't like hearing that* he said. *There's consequences. Always consequences.*

Vincent pressed his back against the tree and pushed. Bit by bit, inch by inch, he somehow managed to grind his body back to a standing position. ""Fuck you,"" he garbled. Then he spat another wad of blood and displaced tissue - this time at the center of Medellin's chest.

*Just stop* said the Shaded Man. *You've been told.*

But Vincent took a step forward, and then another. Medellin got spooked and lunged forward, stabbing Vincent once more in the shoulder. And that was fine by Vincent's account. He couldn't feel anything anyway. Besides, he had a knife of his own. He'd always kept it in his boot. And he'd just recently drawn it out, as he was struggling to his feet. It was a smaller knife - less showy. But sharp. And when Vincent jabbed it straight up through the underside of Medellin's chin it cut real clean and easy. Straight up - up up - through the mouth and back down through the throat. All in one motion.

Vincent didn't have to sit around waiting for Medellin to have the good grace to die. He was dead before he hit the ground. Vincent soon followed him, laughing weak and delirious as he slumped to the earth.

""Alright. Alright. I had my fun. You can take me.""

Vincent blinked and spun around, painful as you please. But he was alone. The Shaded Man was gone. 

""It's done?"" he wondered out loud. But the blood still fell from his chest and his shoulder. And he was so, so cold. The wind howled, hot and dry. There was nothing but the scrub and Medellin's body as far as the eye could see. 

""I'm ready,"" said Vincent, and he was. Ready to leave. Ready to move on. The pain was flaring up again. The pain and the coldness. 

""I'm ready!"" screamed Vincent. His throat was raw. 

He asked his heart to stop, but it pounded all the same. Faster, even. He tried to hold his breath, but his lungs didn't see the sense in it. Everything kept pumping.

Dying, but never dead. 

Vincent hadn't the strength to make it back to his feet, so he crawled instead. Crawled across the desert. Across the yellow and the white. He felt his flesh sear in the heat. But there was nothing else to do. Crawl. Drag his corpse body home. Hear his wife scream. See his children cry.

He looked back at Medellin's body and felt a queer stab of jealousy. 

""I'm ready,"" he gasped, as the sand trickled down his nose and throat, little grains of glass pulling apart his insides, microscopic shred by microscopic shred. ""I'm ready,"" he whispered in his ruined voice. ""I'm ready.""

The wind howled. The earth throbbed with heat. No one came. Even the shadows had abandoned him. ""I'm ready. I'm ready.""",2016-11-01 03:43:15+00:00,d9gebn1,1.0,t3_5agujf,2922.0,WritingPrompts
13,"They have found me. I fear my time is short. I will forward this letter to someone I consider reliable. I ask only that you do with this information whatever you feel is right. I am too far inside the belly of the monster. I cannot see dawn. I do not know what is right or good or just. You must be better than me. You must be brave.

It all began in the spring. The thaw had come and so I retrieved my bicycle, intent on reconnecting with the wild world of these wondrous northern lands. I rode to the park on Hillsborough. The day was warm, I recall - warm and sweet. A perfect day.

This feeling would not last.

Rounding a corner I came upon a battalion of *geese*. Big, gray, hulking beasts, they pecked and flexed their enormous wings, waddling purposefully towards the path. I assumed they would stay to the side and let me pass. I was wrong. 

The geese swarmed the road. They were not crossing. They were not going anywhere. They had - it appeared - chosen to occupy the path for the sheer purpose of being pricks.

I slowed my bike, attempting to forge a path. Wings spread and fluttered menacingly. They chirped and barked in their strange grunting trill. Beaks lashed out at my bike and my feet and exposed legs. I cried out, backing up. They pressed forward, tightening the swarm. Again, I could see no purpose for their actions other than pure malice and the desire to be assholes.

Pecked and plucked, I finally managed to turn my bike. Still, they snatched at me. I peddled, harder than I have ever done. They chased. Some took flight. They chirruped and barked, racing ever at my side. I burst from the park onto the main road, nearly colliding with a sedan. Satisfied, my attackers swooped away - off to harass another.

Canada geese. I could not help but wonder *why*? Why were they such desperate, unquenchable pricks?

The answer, I believed, must lie in their motherland. Canada. That land of almost comical kindness. How could such heinously wretched beasts have been produced in such a pleasant place as Canada? I would go to find out.

My first curious encounter occurred at the border crossing into Ontario. The gentleman in the booth asked me my business and I saw no reason to lie.

""I am researching Canada geese,"" I announced, hoping I may gain some insight before even leaving the United States. ""I am curious about their temperament.""

""Is that so?"" said the crossing guard, almost, I detected, with a hint of wary.

""They are a singularly aggressive and, might I say, *rude* species. I thought the answer as to why may lie here in Canada.""

The border patrolman sniffed and whispered something into his radio. I did not hear the response, but the man told me to pull off to the side for an inspection. Three hours later, my car and my possessions tossed, I was told to turn back. I did not have the proper papers for scientific studies. 

Curious.

I came back some time later, passing through another border, hoping my name had not been added to any sort of list. When asked, I said my visit was for entertainment purposes and left it at that.

I was let through into Canada.

I began my interviews. I drove to the much renowned College of Canada and sought out their professors of ornithology. They were each, to the man and woman, shifty and off-put by my questions. They did not scold and their smiles never faltered, but neither did they answer my questions, and almost all sought to be rid of me as soon as I raised the subject. 

Last, I met with a professor named Klingsbeard. I decided to be as aggressive and unyielding as the geese I studied. I hounded this Klingsbeard. I would not take ""no"" for an answer. Always, always, she smiled and nodded and said she did not know and could not help and did I need directions to the nearest Tim Horton's? But I was relentless. At one point she excused herself and I - to my mutual shame and credit - followed her silently from afar, hoping to uncover *some* bit of useful information. Here is what I discovered.

This Klingsbeard retrieved a paper bag from a dispenser in the wall. I had seen these dispensers but thought little of them. Klingsbeard took the bag to a quiet place, wrapped the open end around her mouth, and began to scream herself red. 

The sound was somewhat muffled in the bag, but most of the curse words I could hear just fine. On and on she went, screaming and cursing and jibbering with rage. Finally, she pulled her mouth free and sealed the paper bag at the top with a strip of attached adhesive. Taking a steady breath, she then popped the inflated bag into a trash bin. 

I hid around the corner. Once Klingsbeard walked off to look for me, I bounded to the trash can and pulled off the lid, snatching out the inflated bag.

What a curious thing.

It was no more than what it seemed - a paper bag somehow stuffed with air. It did not any sense to me. Careful to check that Klingsbeard was not nearby, I peeled off the adhesive. Warm air rushed out of the paper. 

To put it simply, my blood began to boil. 

I felt anger like I had never felt. Strange, bone-deep hatred and hostility. I wanted to punch Klingsbeard. I wanted to punch the wall. I wanted, oddly, to punch myself. 

I rushed out of the building for fear of what I might do. Klingsbeard spied me leaving and flashed a wide smile, waving her hand and shouting, ""It was a pleasure! Come back any time!"" She seemed sincere.

Outside, I gained some measure of control. Then I searched for the campus dumpsters.

They were loaded with those inflated paper bags. Piles and piles of them. How many, I could not even fathom. I would guess, based on the size of the College of Canada, that every teacher and student must have created at least three or four bags a day.

There was a service number on the side of one of the dumpsters. I called and made up a story about accidentally chucking my wife's favorite Maple Leafs jersey. They gave me the address of the dumping site. 

And there was my answer. Mounds like skyscrapers, reaching towards the blue sky. Just heaping piles of brown paper bags. And circling above - scores and scores of Canada geese.

""Oh my god,"" I gasped. ""How could they? *How could they!?!*"" I bellowed and screamed and stomped. Then I saw all the empty, deflated bags and knew I could not stay there. This was inhuman. It was wrong. A crime against emotion. A crime against the *damn, hateful geese*.

I heard the beeping of the garbage truck too late. Men were coming. They saw me. More, I believe they saw the light in my eyes. The light of discovery. The trucks bore down on me. I ran to my car and drove.

The chase has gone on for days. Ever I have gone north. They are driving me away from my people - my wonderfully complicated people. I have found an abandoned ranger station with an internet connection. Soon they will swarm me - much like their geese. There are no bags up here in the wild north. They will be angry when they catch me. 

Perhaps the bags are justified. Perhaps they are not. I do not know anymore. So I have told you what I know and what I have seen. Now it is up to you.

14,"Gordon pulled the note off the door, crumpled it up, and tossed it into the bushes. He knew what it said and who it was from. Missy Joyner - complaining about the raccoons again. 

Too bad. It was his house and his life and his goddamn cat food. Besides, raccoons were just part of the cost of living in the suburbs...or the city...or the country. Well, they were just part of the cost of living, that's all. No use crying about it. 

He'd started feeding the raccoons after Georgia had died. Georgia was his cat. His wife Ally had been dead for ten years, but that was no great loss. Georgia, though, was about as good a kitty as you could ask for. Calm and simple, she hardly ever asked for anything. Never complained. Not even as that tumor had started growing up along the inside of her throat. It got so bad she could hardly swallow. The weight loss was the only sign Gordon ever picked up on and by then it was much, much too late.

So Georgia was gone and Gordon had a big old bag of cat food left in the pantry. He considered getting a new cat, but he was old and indifferent to the people, places, and things he wasn't already fond of or used to. New things were a hassle. Gordon was too old for hassles. But there were strays in the neighborhood and that seemed like the kind of relationship Gordon could stand - distant benefactor. Stray cat philanthropist. So he took a scoop of food and left it on his back steps one night. Somewhere in the middle of the night he heard scratching and munching and the clitter-clap of little, long nails on half-rotten wood. He peeked out the window to see who his customer was. 

It was a trio of raccoons. 

Gordon was honestly disgusted. Raccoons have those nimble little paws - disturbingly dexterous. Too human-like. And those black eyes see entirely too much. Wild and clever and vicious. 

But the raccoons seemed pleased with the offering. They cleared the lot, licked their hands and faces, and disappeared back into the dark.

And Gordon...Gordon still had plenty of cat food left.

The trouble - if you were the sort who cared about these things - was that Missy Joyner saw Gordon dumping the cat food out on his back steps one night. She lived on the opposite side of the fence and happened to be a snoop. Suddenly she had someone to blame every time raccoons or other woodland creatures made a move on her trash bins. 

""I'll call animal control, I will!"" she'd once barked across the fence.

""Call 'um!"" Gordon had croaked back. ""They ain't my pets.""

And they weren't. Raccoons are subservient to no one and Gordon certainly didn't expect any sort of thank you. He just liked to watch them eat. He'd gotten past that initial revulsion and turned around to finding them a fascinating species. Survivors. Just like Gordon. They didn't care what anyone thought of them. Just like Gordon. 

*Peas in a pod*, Gordon mused one day, as he watched a half dozen scuffle and wrestle over that night's pile of dry kibble. 

And so Missy Joyner's notes all went in the same place - the trash, or the street, or the bushes, or once - when Gordon had been particularly peeved - straight up the old man's own asshole. He'd regretted it later, upon extraction, but it had been a singularly triumphant moment, which he swore to cherish until the day he died.

The note so deposed of, Gordon unlocked the door and stepped inside his home.

He was not alone.

Two men stood inside the house, one holding Gordon's television with an almost sheepish look on his face; the other standing just outside the bathroom, tugging something out of his pocket.

""What the hell is this?"" cried Gordon, too stupid with anger to think to turn and run. The man with the TV stammered something incoherent, while the other produced a gun and defiantly waved it in Gordon's face.

""Close the door, old man,"" said the one with the gun. ""Or I swear I'll blast you in the face.""

Gordon sighed, his anger still simmering, but his age catching up to him. ""Whatever. Take what you want. It's all crap anyway.""

""We will,"" said the man with the gun. ""But first...""

They locked the door and tied Gordon to a chair. The sheepish man suggested that they run, but the man with the gun just laughed. 

""He's seen our faces,"" he said with a grin. ""He's gotta die. You know that, right?""

The sheepish man shook his head. ""I don't think he'll...""

""He won't,"" agreed the other. ""He'll be dead. But first, I wanna try a few things.""

He set the gun on the kitchen table and pulled a chunky switchblade out of his waistband. ""You ever peel an apple in one, single drag?"" he asked his partner.

The sheepish man turned pale. ""I didn't... look, I just wanted some easy cash. I didn't...""

""We'll still take all the good stuff,"" said the man with the switchblade. ""I just wanna see how much of his face I can peel off in a single strip.""

Gordon was scared - he was old, not stupid - but resigned to death. Even resigned to torture. He promised himself he wouldn't scream. That's what the sicko with the knife wanted. So that's the one thing Gordon wouldn't give him.

Gordon was repeating that silent mantra - *Don't scream. Don't scream* - when he spotted a pair of shining, black eyes at the back window. 

""It's dinnertime, isn't it?"" he said absently. 

""No dinner for you, old man,"" said the man with the switchblade. ""No dinner ever again.""

""It's not my dinnertime,"" said Gordon, watching, fascinated as the knob on the backdoor began to twist. They couldn't get in, of course. The door was locked. But how strange that they would try. ""Must be hungry,"" he muttered.

""Me?"" said the man with the switchblade, leaning down over Gordon's face. ""I'm not a cannibal. I'm not going to *eat* you. I'm just curious, that's all.""

Gordon shifted his head to see past the man. ""Christ. Did they find the spare key under the mat? Well, I'll be...""

""We broke in through the bedroom window,"" said the sheepish man. ""We thought you worked Thursday nights. That's why...we...you know.""

Gordon smiled. ""The whole family's here.""

""He's freaking me out,"" said the sheepish man. 

""He's just fuckin' with us,"" said the switchblade man. ""Ignore him.""

""Use the gun,"" said Gordon, squirming in his seat and pointing with his chin. ""Point and pull the trigger.""

""*Knife*,"" said the switchblade man, pushing the edge up against Gordon's throat. ""You don't get the gun until I'm done havin' fun. Oooh. That rhymed."" He turned to face the sheepish man. ""Did you hear th...""

*BANG.*

The right side of the switchblade man's face detached itself in the blink of an eye, splattering against the wall and the door and quite a good deal of Gordon. The remainder of the switchblade man stumbled, buckled at the knees, and collapsed to the floor. 

The sheepish man screamed. 

""They need to kill you, too?"" asked Gordon, nodding at the space just behind the frightened thief. The sheepish man turned slowly. A trio of raccoons were standing on the kitchen table, holding the handgun, which smoked faintly as the muzzle drifted towards the sheepish man. 

""Oh *fuck*!"" shouted the sheepish man. 

""Untie me,"" said Gordon. The sheepish man did as he was told. Gordon rubbed his arms and back. ""Take the body with you. And don't come back.""

The sheepish man nodded, bending to scoop up the dead body off the floor. Bowed under the weight, he stumbled out of the house through the backdoor and disappeared forever.

Gordon turned to the kitchen table, where the raccoons had dropped the gun and were looking around rather expectantly. 

""Well, I think you've earned a bit of a feast tonight, my friends,"" said Gordon with a smile. ""Let's go see what we have in the pantry.""     ",2016-10-31 04:34:50+00:00,d9eyuit,1.0,t3_5a91jl,18404.0,WritingPrompts

16,"Colin eyed the mewling puppy with distrust.

""I don't know, Mom,"" he sighed.

The puppy, named Pom-Pom, was an English Bulldog, jowly and slack-eyed just eight weeks into existence. It gnawed on the cuff of Colin's jeans. 

""Say *ow* and pull away,"" said Colin's mother. ""Remember? We have to teach it not to bite us.""

""Ow,"" said Colin flatly, pushing the fleshy dog away with the tip of his finger. ""I'm just... what about Casper and Ellie and Dexter?""

Colin's mother was named Marie. She had curly black hair and a spray of pale pink freckles bleeding out from her nose and crossing down towards her neck. ""Casper, Elle, and Dex are gone, honey. You know that. We're all very sad they're gone, but it's okay to move on. It's okay to like Pom-Pom. I don't think they'll mind.""

""I don't know,"" said Colin. But there wasn't much more to say about it, so he scooped up Pom-Pom and cradled the puppy in his arms. *Probably they wouldn't mind*, he thought. *Probably.* And then Pom-Pom bit his finger and Colin didn't have to pretend to be hurt.

Two days later, Colin told his father he was trying out for the boy's soccer team after school, so he'd be late. His father had been a baseball player growing up, but any sport was better than no sport, so he nodded and said, 'Good luck.""

Colin, however, had no interest in soccer. Instead, the appearance of Pom-Pom had raised a deep, guilty sadness within the boy. He'd reneged on a promise. He'd been negligent. 

So after school he got off at John Vivek's house and walked down Miller towards Nebraska Ave. He'd managed to never forget the address - 315 Nebraska - though he was pretty certain he'd be able to find the house regardless. And sure enough, there it was - still that pale purple color with the black shutters closed tight on every window. It hadn't changed, not even a little. The shrubs that lined the walkway were still patchy and dry and sharp as knives. Colin walked carefully up to the front door. He worried, belatedly, if the old woman would even remember him. Would she scold him for forgetting? For staying away so long?

Colin may have been forgetful, but he was brave, too, and knew when he had to take his lumps. He pressed the doorbell and stood back. 

The bell echoed like a banging gong inside the house. Then there was a cacophony of barks and yips and growls. Colin jumped at the sheer volume of competing noises. He almost turned and ran, but then a voice inside bellowed out *Quiet!* and the noise died away and the door opened slowly.

""Yes?"" Colin could just see the one eye peeking through the crack. It was white and murky, like dirty water, surrounded by crumpling layers of red and yellow flesh.

""Hi,"" said Colin. ""I'm... I'm Colin Raheem. I'm... I was hoping I could see Casper, Ellie, and Dexter.""

""Colin?"" said the old woman slowly. ""Ah. Ah, yes. I remember. You've been away a long time. Your children were getting worried you'd forgotten them.""

""No, no never,"" said Colin hastily. ""I've just been... been busy. Are they okay?""

The old woman chuckled. ""Right as rain, child. I told you I'd watch over them. I watch over all of them that comes to stay in my house. You wanna visit for a spell you said?""

""Yes,"" said Colin, even as his insides told him he shouldn't and he began to remember why he'd been so bad about visiting. ""I'd like to say hi if that's alright.""

""Well, they'll be pleased to see you,"" said the old woman. ""I told before, you ought to come by as often as you can."" She pulled the door open wider. Colin couldn't help but stare. She'd always been old, from the first moment he'd met her, in the little cemetery way back behind the duck pond. He'd been crying over the fresh lump of upturned soil and flat stone that marked Casper's burial mound when she'd appeared, as if from nowhere, to make her offer. It had seemed so wrong and strange to Colin then, but he missed his dog. Perhaps too dearly. So he'd agreed and she'd told him to leave the cemetery and given him the address: 315 Nebraska. 

""Come and visit any time,"" she'd said.
  
She'd been old that day in the cemetery, but now she was even older. That made sense, Colin reminded himself. People got older. But the old lady seemed worse off, somehow. Like the flesh was trying to crawl off her body. Like the bones beneath had some other place to be.
 
""Casper, baby,"" she called. ""Ellie. Dexter.""

Colin looked down at the dogs and cats and hamsters and parrots and other assorted animals that roamed throughout the house. They all looked a bit like the old woman - wrong somehow. Hanging together by a thread. Their eyes were just a bit too dim. Their flesh a bit too slack and dry. The hair too brittle. 

""Here's a good boy,"" said the old lady and Colin turned back to look. It was Casper. 

""How long has it been?"" asked the old lady. 

Colin swallowed. ""A year. Maybe two.""

Casper's long, white tail wagged heartily as the dog lumbered forward. His eyes were nearly clear, filmed over in a dark, dripping fluid. His teeth were gone, his gums black and purple. There was a ragged crater on his left side, gray puckered flesh leading down to broken yellow bones and weakly pulsing greenish-black organs.

The dog rubbed its head against Colin's thighs, flecks of white hair and yellow skin peeling off, floating down like winter snow. The boy put a cautious hand to the dog's head and felt how cold and clammy the thing was. 

""And here's two more,"" said the old woman joyfully. Ellie and Dexter bounded into the room. A pug and a puggle, they both looked more like flayed moles than dogs. The flesh of their faces had collapsed down over their eyes, leaving both blind and nearly featureless. Dexter dragged a rotten stump of a hind left leg. The better part of Ellie's insides hung from a gaping hole in her chest cavity, dragging along the thin carpet. 

""Just as you remember them,"" said the old woman. ""What a happy reunion.""

Finally, Colin screamed at the horror of what he'd done. He turned to run and tripped over Casper's living carcass, falling hard to the ground. His pets swarmed him happily. Lapping his face with dry, cold tongues. Grinding their decaying flesh against his flailing arms and chest. Colin curled into a ball and covered his face.

The other dogs caught the excitement and started barking. Cats howled. Parrots squawked. 

""Oh, how I love to see a boy and his pets,"" cried the old woman over the growing clamor of dead animal voices. ""Nuthin' more beautiful in the world! Nuthin' at all!""",2016-10-30 16:31:03+00:00,d9e2l0m,1.0,t3_5a6ida,3803.0,WritingPrompts
17,"Klapson the Conventionally Handsome cleared the air from his segmented neck valve in a tellingly somber manner.

""Sir, is anything the matter?"" said Gelvord the Historically Underpaid, bouncing anxiously on his three double-jointed hind legs.

""The castle is too quiet,"" said Klapson, waving an armor-plated forehand dismissively. ""That is all.""

""Too quiet?"" said Gelvord. ""Well, perhaps sir, it is time to begin a new brood hive?""

""*New brood hive*?"" snarled Klapson. ""No, no, little Gelvord. The memory of my previous brood hive's untimely demise haunts me still.""

""You ate your previous brood hive,"" said Gelvord. 

""All in a single go,"" said Klapson, shaking his great, scaly headpiece. ""I told you not to let me binge.""

""You're right, sir. I'm terribly sorry.""

""It's no matter,"" said Klapson, more air whistling with obvious melancholy from his assorted neck valves. ""All great rulers must rule alone. So said Vuvoliun the Presumably Ingenious.""

""Right before you ate him,"" said Gelvord, nodding. ""Yes, I remember. Well, perhaps sir, we might fetch for you a royal pet?"" 

Klapson's great, creaking headpiece tilted slightly. ""Hmm. *Pet*, you say?""

""Yes, yes,"" said Gelvord. ""A mist-grendel, perhaps? Or a jibbercroak - those are very popular these days.""

Klapson's face hardened. ""I would not want a *common* pet, such as any being with a name and a few credits might purchase. Mine must be a *special* pet. Unique. Unlike any in the realm.""

""Hmmm,"" said Gelvord. ""Well, I have heard tell that there is a distant string of planets inhabited by various broods of semi-intelligent bipedals and their descendant herd-clans. Perhaps one of these would serve? I do not believe anyone else in this system has such a pet.""

""Are they dangerous?"" asked Klapson, eyes sparkling with interest.

""Depends on the breed,"" said Gelvord. ""While all are descended from similar core stock, each planet produces quantifiably different species. Perhaps we could go take a look at what is available and see what suits you, sir?""   

""Yes. I should like that. Commission my ship. Let us go pick out my... what were they called?""

""Uh, humans, sir,"" said Gelvord. 

""*Human*,"" said Klapson. ""Let us go find me a human.""

Some great time later, Gelvord and Klapson huddled together at the viewscreen of the cruiser. 

""This is a lush green world of plenty,"" said Gelvord. ""Much vegetation. Few predators. The humans of this world are smallish and comparably timid. Their instincts are also less honed. You could expect great loyalty from one of this breed, but very little self-direction. In other words, it would be no challenge to break one of these.""

""Hmm,"" said Klapson. ""Might I see a sample?""

""Certainly, sir."" A small crew was dispatched to the lush green world, returning a short time later with six specimens for review. Each quivered and whimpered. They whispered to each other in wavering voices. 

""Rather doughy, are they not?"" said Klapson.

""Susceptible to numerous diseases and structural maladies,"" said Gelvord. ""Due to the ease of life there has been little culling of weak genes, resulting in the docile creatures you see before you. As I noted earlier, they will come to be almost distressingly loyal in time, but these are a low energy breed.""

""Many seem to have soiled themselves,"" noted Klapson.

Gelvord hissed slightly. ""That is to be expected.""

""I do not think many would take me seriously to see such creatures in my service,"" said Klapson. ""The whimpering alone is very offputting.""

""Let us move on to the next planet.""

The samples were returned to their lush green planet and the ship jumped to a new planet, this one red and orange and laced all over with treacherous crags and depressions.

""A typical battle planet,"" said Gelvord. ""Very harsh. Only the strong survive. Nearly every moment is a fight. Consequently, this species has developed into something rather different than the last lot.""

""Not as doughy?""

""Not by half.""

Klapson nodded. ""Samples.""

Another crew was dispatched. This time it took very long for them to return. They seemed to have lost a few of their number down on the planet.

These humans were wiry and wild, snarling and clawing at their restraints.

""Very lively,"" remarked Klapson, dodging back as one made a jump at his throat.

""These will not be easy to break,"" said Gelvord. ""Clearly quite dangerous. But they can be loyal, too, under the right circumstances.""

""And under the wrong circumstances?""

""There is the very strong possibility that they will eat your face off.""

""I like my face,"" murmured Klapson. ""Can we call this a *maybe*?""

""Certainly,"" said Gelvord, smacking one of the lunging humans with a length of pipe. ""Next planet.""

This planet was circled all over in heavy, white fog. 

""Something of a mixed bag here,"" said Gelvord. ""Very clever species. They no longer have any natural predators, but go through regular cycles of inter-species conflict.""

""Clever is good,"" said Klapson. ""Let's see them.""

The landing crew returned in full a short time later. 

""Are they... are they blind?"" said Klapson.

""No,"" said Gelvord, reaching out and plucking a small, rectangular device away from the forepaws of the nearest human. Its head spun around, as if suddenly aware of its strange surroundings. Then it noticed the small rectangular device in Gelvord's hand and made to retrieve it, jumping and grunting and grabbing ineffectively. ""A bit of a distracted breed.""

""What's clever about them?"" said Klapson, eyeing the other samples as they stood, absently gazing into their own rectangular devices. Many had begun to grunt and shake their device, as if it no longer did what it was supposed to be doing.

""Good problem solvers when motivated,"" said Gelvord. ""They can be largely docile, until they are... *watch out, it's got a gun*!""

The aggrieved human had managed to smuggle away a ray blaster from one of the landing crew and was pointing it at Gelvord. Gelvord tossed the small, rectangular device to the human, who caught it, dropping the ray blaster in the process.

Klapson nodded, impressed. ""And the rest of the time?""

Gelvord shrugged. ""Mostly just this,"" he said gesturing at the wandering, uninterested humans. 

""Excellent,"" said Klapson. ""Get me a breeding pair and let's go home.""

""Breeding pair,"" said Gelvord uncertainly. He scanned the samples, then pointed at two at random. ""They all look the same to me,"" he muttered. ""Throw back the rest and get these two a water bowl, some fresh beds, and unsecured WiFi.""

It was an exciting day. And although Gelvord knew in his heart that Klapson was almost certainly going to lose interest within a sunskip, leaving Gelvord to take care of the humans, at least for this day his master was happy. For a servant like Gelvord, that was really the best he could hope for.   ",2016-10-29 17:55:45+00:00,d9cyxct,1.0,t3_5a0qgl,11464.0,WritingPrompts
18,"The Aid Corps is 90% cy-meds these days. More engineers and tinkerers than actual doctors. They solder and screw, cross wires and re-code damaged neuro-paths. It's a enormous pain in the ass to find anyone who remembers the old ways.

""I just want the bullet out, Gordon."" The old doctor has shaky hands and white, owl eyes. But he remembers flesh and how to heal it. He's the only one I can find most days. No one else in the Battalion has any use for him anymore. 

""Just get a new arm, Karl,"" says Gordon, hovering over the bullet hole, prodding it with discolored steel prongs. ""You're not doing yourself any favors being an anachronism.""

""I like my arm,"" I grunt, flexing the bicep uncontrollably as the prongs sink deeper into the flesh. ""I like all my parts. It's the way I was meant to be.""

Gordon snorts. ""Be that as it may, you're slow. And fleshy. Much too human. It's why you keep getting shot.""

""Everyone gets shot,"" I say, letting out a slow breath as the bullet is drawn out like a burrowing tick. ""They just don't notice it as much.""

""Some would call that an improvement.""

""I think soldiers who remember to duck are better,"" I say. ""But that's just me. The anachronism."" Gordon seals the hole and patches it over in medical resin and flextape. ""And what about you? I go full cy, you'll be out of a job.""

""Oh, retirement? Oh no! What horrors. Please save me from the nightmare, good soldier."" Gordon shakes his head. ""They'll never let me go. As long as the Crypts are alive and there's even the smallest ounce of soldier flesh left to sew, they'll never let go me.""

I flex my bandaged arm. The muscle throbs, but there are meds to keep that at bay. ""Thanks, Gordon."" I stand up, grabbing my rifle from the door. 

""Back out to the front?"" says Gordon. I nod, rolling my neck and finding brand new knots I'll never find a chance to work out. Everything hurts. It's best not to think of it. ""Are you trying to die, Karl?""

I consider the question. My instinct is to laugh, because why am I bothering with all this pain and all this agony if what I really want is to die? If I want death, the Crypts will be happy to give it to me, just like they've given it to half of everything that once lived on this beautiful blue orb of a planet. 

But I don't want death. Not at all.

""Trying to win,"" I say, tightening my grip on the rifle's handle. ""Trying to save us. Who we were. Before they showed up.""

Gordon frowns. ""You think you can do that all flesh and bone?""

""It's the *only* way I can do it,"" I say. ""Every wire, every circuit, every metal plate and silicone hinge... every change we make to get better, to get *good enough* to beat them back... it all takes us further and further away from who we are... from what we started this fight to protect. If we win, and the only thing left on this planet is a battalion of broken soldier robots... what did we win?""

I sigh. The pain is tuning up, like an orchestra. It's going to get louder and louder. I don't know how much more of this I can take.

Gordon salutes. I salute back. 

""For Humanity,"" he says, sadly, proudly.

""For Humanity,"" I echo. Outside, the atmosphere is green and gold. The air smells of sulfur and burning silicate. I shift the rifle under my arm and press at the kink in the small of my back. 

I am a human being. I will die a human being. That's the best I can do in this world.

A heavy-tread transport rolls past and I hop aboard. My fellow soldiers salute me. Plastic eyes. Platinum circuit bands. Silver, hydraulic arms. Faint, pink glow of activated pulse fields.

19,"Sasha grabbed the orange and black 3 inchers out of her closet. Mr. Blaisemore had given them to her as a gift. They were Italian and horribly expensive. They also looked like pumpkins. Sasha hated them. They'd do just fine. Walking to the kitchen, she took the left shoe and smashed it heel-first across the counter. The heel snapped like a twig. 

""Whoopsie me,"" sighed Sasha, tossing the broken shoe into her favorite over-sized purse and heading out the door, ordering a ride as she pressed the down button on the elevator.

The Uber driver took Sasha to a subway station ten blocks from her apartment. She took a train to the outskirts of town. A small Russian community, the streets were dotted with little boutiques and Russian markets. The cobbler's shop was next door to a liquor store. The boy at the counter asked what she needed.

Sasha dumped the broken heel out in front of the boy. ""Piotr,"" she said.

""I can do it,"" said the boy, defensively. 

""Piotr,"" repeated Sasha. The boy withered and shook his head, spinning off his stool and stomping into a back room. 

Moments later, an old man hobbled out. 

""Ah, *this* pretty lady,"" he said joyfully, hands clasped across his chest. His eyes went to the mangled shoe. ""What a tragedy!""

""Went out on me,"" said Sasha with a smile. 

The old man shook his head. ""I meant the *color*. Blech. Tell me you did not buy this for yourself.""

""You better believe it,"" said Sasha, following the old man as he motioned for her to join him in his workshop. 

""This is no great work,"" he said. Then he spied his young assistant loitering in the workshop. ""Out! Watch the desk.""

""Shouldn't I watch you work?"" asked the boy, self-consciously looking back and forth from the old man to Sasha.

""Privacy!"" said the old man. ""Let me woo this beautiful woman in peace!""

The boy nodded, red-faced, and darted out of the room.

The old man waited a beat. ""So where did the shoe come from?""

""Blaisemore,"" said Sasha, taking a seat. ""One of many gifts for all my good *work* with Senator Reeves.""

""Da, the senator,"" said the old man, absently plucking the broken heel. ""So... I suppose that means your *original* objective remains unfulfilled?""

Sasha pinched the bridge of her nose and squeezed her eyes shut tight. ""Yes. Obviously. But things are moving. Once this new Defense Funding package gets passed through the Senate, that wins me Blaiseman's trust. And his favor. That will increase the flow of information, which will improve my position with the Yakuza, which...""

""That is something the Motherland is not pleased with,"" said the old man abruptly. ""They would like you to extricate yourself from that particular business. There are certain officials who view it as very distasteful.""

Sasha rolled her eyes. ""That isn't *possible*. I can't break the chain, Piotr. Not at any link. Tell them that. I didn't ask for things to get this complicated.""

The old man nodded, wearily. ""Fine. Yes. Well, it is them. Not me. I understand. You are building trust.""

""The Magglieti Family placed me with the Yakuza to sew instability and degrade the organization from the inside,"" said Sasha. ""If I abandon the Yakuza, I lose the Magglieti Family and everything behind that. I also lose Blaiseman and everything *in front* of that. Just let me do my job.""

""But they do not care about Blaiseman or this senator or the Yakuza or mafia families or any of this,"" said the old man, waving the broken heel as punctuation. ""A lot of money and resources were spent getting you inside the CIA. *That* is all they care about! American Intelligence! What do they see? What are they saying? More of this, dear Sasha.""

Sasha snatched the heel out of the old man's hand, spun it around and held it up against his eye. ""It's not that easy. CIA sent me inside the FBI. The FBI sent me inside the Magglietis. Trust, Piotr. *They* trust me. I'm seven layers down inside the rings of Hell, Piotr. All I ask is that the Motherland trust me as much as the enemy does. Do you see?""

The old man flinched away. ""Fine, yes. So again there is nothing? You have ruined a shoe for no reason?""

""I hate those shoes. That's reason enough."" Sasha shook her head. ""Tell them this: there is a growing sense that war is coming. Some even believe it is inevitable.""

The old man sighed. ""That is not news.""

""How about this: the United States will seed Crimea with arms and soldiers posing as aid workers. They aim to reclaim the peninsula, but make it look as though rebels have done all the work.""

The old man leapt to his feet. ""Are you serious? Soldiers posing as aid workers?""

Sasha nodded. The old man took a deep breath, then pulled out a brown paper bag and stuffed both pieces of the broken shoe inside. ""I'll bill you,"" he said with a wink, handing over the paper bag.

Sasha shook the bag with a half-smile and walked out of the cobbler's shop. She was only two steps clear of the door when the apprentice came bounding out. 

""Miss!"" he called, before realizing she hadn't gotten very far. ""You forgot to pay.""

""Piotr said he would bill me,"" said Sasha coldly. 

""Right,"" said the boy, nodding. He stuck an envelope into her hand. ""Here it is. Pay within 30 days, okay?"" Not waiting for a response, the boy raced back indoors, leaving Sasha standing outside the shop with an envelope in one hand and a paper bag full of broken shoe parts in the other. Walking around to the corner of the building, she tossed the broken shoe into a dumpster and then headed back to the subway station.

Once through the gate, she pulled out the envelope and cracked it open. Inside was a single picture. It showed a woman tied to a chair. It was her sister. The back of the picture was signed in a smeared Sharpie. It said, *Keep going. So close. Senator Reeves to Aeronautics Committee. AC has land grants. Close 100 Martian grants and Eliza is free. Much love, EM.*

Sasha swallowed hard, then crumpled the picture and stuffed it into her purse. So close. She was so close.

Just a few more steps and it was all over.      ",2016-10-27 03:48:46+00:00,d99jixu,1.0,t3_59kxa5,14361.0,WritingPrompts
20,"""I'm retired,"" said Ana, hefting little Joshua up onto her hip, dancing over Gwen and her pile of blocks, in order to snatch the metal spatula out of Tracy's dancing, sausage hands. 

""I understand that,"" said Wyatt, making a silly face at Joshua and receiving stony, glazed over silence in return. ""But there's still work to be done. The fight isn't over yet.""

Ana closed her eyes and took a slow, steady breath through her nostrils. ""The fight's never over, though, is it? There's always something else. Another enemy. Another war. Why can't you just leave me alone?""

""I'd *like* to,"" said Wyatt, through gritted teeth. ""Really, I would. But this is bigger than me and bigger than you.""

""I swear to god that better not be a fat joke,"" muttered Ana, grabbing the vegetable peeler out of Tracy's hand.

""No no,"" said Wyatt quickly. ""Just one more job, okay? One more and then it's over. Done with. And you can retire and I'll never ask again.""

""Why should I?"" sneered Ana, wiping away the white bubble of sputum that had formed between Joshua's lips. 

""Because it's the right thing to do?"" said Wyatt hopefully.

""Try again.""

""I...fine. I'll give you what you want in return.""

Ana cocked her head. ""Is that so?""

""Yes,"" said Wyatt, defeated.

""Hmm. Interesting. And you'll stay out of my way and let me handle things as I see fit?""

Wyatt nodded. 

""And just the one more? We're done after that?""

Wyatt nodded. ""One more baby.""

""And you'll...?""

""I'll shave it straight off,"" said Wyatt unhappily, rubbing tenderly at the Fu Manchu that hung like a soggy french fry over his upper lip.

Ana bounced Joshua gently on his hip. ""And you're sure the homeowner's association won't just *let* you build a treehouse in the backyard?""

Wyatt shook his head. ""I need you all babied up for this, Ann. I figure if we get right to it, by the time Audie Crenshaw has given birth you'll be four months along and the power will shift to us. It's for the kids, babe. They *need* a treehouse.""

""You realize this means we'll have *four* children, right?""

Wyatt shrugged. ""Yeah, so?""

Ana rolled her eyes. ""You're ridiculous."" She leaned forward and planted a soft kiss on his lips. ""Wow, I'm excited for that thing to die.""

""Aw,"" said Wyatt. ""The kids like it. Right Josh?""

In reply, Josh spit up over his mother, his father, and just a touch over himself.

21,"*THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER, MARY!*

The words were pink on cream, written in a soft, looping digital cursive. Connor grasped the edge of the laptop screen and whispered, ""You're welcome.""

Connor sighed. How long did he have? He usually gave himself four days. Four days to raid a mark's old accounts, open new accounts, and spend himself into oblivion. Then he cut ties and walked away, collected his blind deliveries and stashed the remainder in his own, very legitimate bank accounts. 

So far Mary Veritoe wasn't offering much resistance. Connor had bought her email address, login ID, and password from a Russian wholeseller, expecting the usual 25 percent success rate. But Mary liked the internet and she did *not* like thinking up new passwords or user IDs. 

On a lark, Connor went to Facebook and had a go with Mary's email and password. Success. This was either a deeply trusting or deeply stupid woman. 

""Hmm,"" murmured Connor, leaning back in his chair just as a man with a shoulder bag seemingly stuffed with bricks brushed past, clobbering Connor upside the head. ""Ow!"" But the man didn't notice. Or didn't care. No one did. That's why Connor didn't feel bad. People were self-obsessed assholes. They didn't deserve his guilt.

Rubbing the back of his head, Connor hunched back over the computer and considered Mary Veritoe's Facebook page. He'd never hacked a social profile before. That was really a long con, and Connor saw himself as more the smash and grab sort of cyber thief. What could he even do? He considered Googling *Facebook scams*, but that seemed pretty bush league. He had to maintain *some* level of professional pride. 

He could direct message some of Mary's friends and... and what? Ah! Mary had a car accident. Only had her phone, not her wallet. Needs to *borrow* some money to pay for repairs... Connor nodded his head. This was starting to sound doable. If the pictures on her Facebook account were anything to go by, Mary was on the other side of 50, so she probably had her share of gullible friends. It was just a matter of finding the *right* gullible friends.

To prepare, Connor started scrolling through Mary's personal messages and Facebook comments, trying to capture her voice. She had four grandkids. The oldest played football. The youngest was still a toddler, and - Connor had to admit - pretty adorable, as far as these things went. There was even a video on there that looked to be from two of the grandkids. Connor popped in his earbuds and huddled even closer to the screen, then hit play.

They were singing ""Happy Birthday"" to their grandmother. There was a woman with them, just to the side, that looked about Connor's age. Probably the mother. She prodded them along. She had a pretty voice. The kids both had sandy, blond hair and haystalk cowlicks that shot up at random angles. They were all smiling big, honest smiles. 

""We love you, Nana!"" they shouted in unison. ""Okay, that was our little 'Happy Birthday',"" said the mother. ""See you soon. Love you!""

And then the video clicked off. Without really thinking about it, Connor clicked ""Play"" again. And then again. After the third time, a box popped up down in the corner.

""Hey Mar,"" said a woman named Lyndsey. Connor stared down at the tiny profile picture. It was a silver-haired lady with a wide, turquoise necklace and a screaming baby on her arm. ""U going 2 the HO meeting tomorrow night?""

Connor froze. He felt strangely exposed, even cloaked in all those layers of anonymity. He felt briefly certain that this Lyndsey could *see* straight through the internet, straight through his laptop. He thought he might ignore the question, but that might seem suspicious. 

""I think so,"" he typed into the box, wrapping his arms around his chest and holding his breath.

""Dale B. is such an ASS!"" typed Lyndsey.

Connor reached out and typed a cautious, ""LOL.""

And that was enough for Lyndsey, who seemingly needed very little prompting to hold up an entire conversation on her own. Connor relaxed, offering careful thoughts when it seemed natural, but mostly sitting back and reading. He skimmed more photos and old posts. He found himself unconsciously memorizing names. 

Mary Veritoe and her rich, full life. 

She'd been to the Grand Canyon. She'd been to Italy. Her husband had worked in the oil industry. He was retired. She still volunteered for the local school district. When she substitute taught, the kids called her ""Mrs. V.""

She'd had to put her cat to sleep recently. It had simply been old and so was she. It was something she clearly grappled with - age. Dying. But she was positive, all the same. Almost 300 people had wished her a happy birthday that past August. 

She was loved. 

It wasn't that Connor was jealous of a middle-aged, semi-retired mother. But it made him think much too hard about himself and what he was and where he was and *why* he was. He'd just finished stripping Mary's credit and her bank accounts and still, he knew that she would be fine. She would make it through. She had friends. She had family. Money was something - it clearly wasn't everything. 

""Where are you going for Thanksgiving this year?"" asked Lyndsey. ""Maura's again? Or are they coming to your house?""

Connor sighed. He usually bought Indian takeaway on Thanksgiving. ""I'm sorry,"" he typed. ""Mary's account has been hacked. Can you tell her? She needs to change her passwords and call her credit card companies immediately.""

He logged out of Facebook and slapped the laptop closed. It was fine. It was fine. He was fine. 

Gathering up his things, Connor stood and made for the door. An elderly woman got up at the same time. Connor rushed forward and held the door open. The woman smiled. ""Well, thank you very much."" Connor nodded, then turned up his collar as he stepped outside. The air was cool and the sun was going down.

Wadsworth banged his head against the table. ""Then just *say* meeting. Trying to understand anything you say is excruciating.""

""Well, now you know,"" said Wilson in a small voice, eyes shifty and downcast. 

""Let's just get on with it,"" sighed Beckham, flipping open his notebook. ""As you know, Professor Death has requested that we add mutated gorillas to his Menagerie of Terror. Kyle, how are we coming with those gorillas?""

Wadsworth puffed out his cheeks. ""Was that... was that my thing?""

Beckham rolled his eyes. ""Christ, Kyle.""

""That was *my* thing?"" said Wadsworth, looking around the table. ""I was on the Shrink Ray team last I heard.""

""What the hell does that mean?"" shouted Wadsworth. ""Seriously - what does that even mean?""

Beckham slapped his palms on the table. ""It doesn't matter!"" he roared.

""Fuck,"" whispered Wilson. ""It means *fuck*.""

""Enough with the trivial bullshit,"" said Beckham. ""We need mutated gorillas. We need mutated gorillas *today*. Thanks to Kyle, we have no mutated gorillas. So - solutions?""

The room fell silent. Wilson cleared his throat. ""So, I have a hypothesis. Just a... a *wild* thought. Mutated gorillas - it's all about the optics, right? Professor Death doesn't *know* mutated gorillas. He's not a professor of zoology. He's a professor of death.""

""I'm not actually sure that's true, but go on,"" said Beckham.

""I'm just saying, he's not going to *examine* these specimens. He just wants a great, impressive beastie thumping around the compound, picking off some of the lower-tier good guys. All about the optics. So I'm just saying..."" Wilson gestured towards Wadsworth. ""Kyle. Gorilla suit. Problem solved. Am I right?""

""I hate you,"" said Wadsworth, shaking his head.

""Just a cursory bit of crafting,"" said Wilson. ""Sew an extra stuffed arm on there. Easy peasy.""

""I am going to shit in your bunk tonight,"" said Wadsworth through gritted teeth.

Beckham nodded. ""Alright.""

Wadsworth did a double-take. ""Are you fucking serious?""

""Just temporarily,"" said Beckham. ""Until we can locate a few *real* mutated gorillas. Or, failing that, some regular gorillas that we then mutate. Obviously that'll take a little longer.""

""I don't believe this,"" said Wadsworth, blinking in horror. 

""Believe it,"" said Beckham, closing his notebook and standing up from the table. ""Wilson you're in charge of putting the gorilla suit together. Wadsworth, you should... I don't know. Go rent *King Kong* I guess?"" Beckham left the room. Wadsworth turned to face Wilson, who was cackling softly.

""Did you like my opening gambit?"" said Wilson, raising his eyebrows. ""That's actually a chess term, it means...""

33,"I needed more time. It was never anything personal. I just needed more time.

Kovach was out there, you see. *He* was still alive. That's why I couldn't stop. I couldn't let him off like that. Scot-free. He had to be held accountable for what he'd done. And I tried. Oh, how I *tried.* Decades, I hunted him. Always a step behind, but ever drawing nearer. So close I could taste him. 

But then he drew more life. And suddenly I was too slow for him. Too old. 

I couldn't let him get away with it. You see that, don't you? I couldn't.

I remember him as a young man. Olive skin and over-wide mouth, always curled into the broadest smiles. We played chess on salty hot Sunday afternoons and Martha would bring us lemonade and biscuits, fresh from the oven. 

I never noticed the way he looked at Martha. Not then. It wasn't until after that I looked back and saw what I should have seen all along.

His wolf eyes. Black circles. Bottomless.

I should have seen it. 

That regret has played its part. 

The first man I killed was a thief. Maybe he was poor, maybe he was cruel, maybe he was deranged. I do not know. He was a thief. I saw him steal his way through a crowd in the plaza one morning. Slippery fingers. Nimble. Purses, wallets, necklaces, wristwatches. My hands had only just begun to shake in those days. My left ear heard a buzzing noise that did not exist. My eyes were weak and rheumy. I was running out of time. 

I followed the man. Watched him as he stole so casually. I followed him all the way home. It was not an empty home. There were signs of life - multiple lives - but it was empty enough. I knocked on the door and asked for directions. He was smoking a cigarette. His hair was thinning. He was not nervous. When he looked down I stabbed him through the eye and then again in the neck. 

The change was almost instantaneous. An immediate transference. The life bled out of him and into me. 

I felt power. Health. My eyes strengthened. My back straightened. The buzz fell away from my ear. I felt 20 years younger at least, fleeing from the thief's home, running and whooping down blind alleys. It wasn't until I stopped to catch my breath outside of the bakery on Moss that I saw my reflection in the glass. Blackish skin. Hooked, talon hands. Ragged, gargoyle face, split in twain by a crooked gulf of gnashing, yellow teeth.

I threw my hands over my head and hunched down, fearful of the shrieks and cries that I would hear once others had spied my hideous features. But no one said anything. No one looked. No one noticed. 

I walked home. And there, in the mirror, I saw in sharper relief that same horrid face. But no one else had. 

And no one else ever did. 

To my eyes I was a monster. It was not a trick or a delusion. It was what I saw. It was not the face others saw, however. In fact, you could say that to others I did not have a face at all. 

I was hardly noticed any more. It would take a great effort to raise the attention of any single man or woman from that point forward.

A ghoul in my eyes. A phantom in all other eyes.

Just as well. It was better not to be seen or thought of. My thoughts returned to Kovach. The hunt continued. 

I emptied my bank account in the pursuit. And then *I* was forced to steal. I tried to target those who would be hurt the least by my transgressions, but alas... sometimes I simply chose the easiest path. 

When I finally caught up to Kovach he was younger still. And a monster. I saw him as I saw myself. Horned, clawed, scaly-skinned, and demon-faced. Good. It was a face that suited him. Monster. 

We fought. We cut each other to the bone. Broke bones. Choked and strangled each other. I claimed one of his eyes. But then he escaped. Half-dying, he escaped. 

So close. I was so close.

I needed another chance. I needed more life. 

But I was desperate then. Desperate and dying. I... do not wish to say what I did. It is too shameful. Yet another thing Kovach must atone for. 

I have yet to come as close as that time, try as I might. In truth, I have never again caught his scent. But he is out there. I know it. He must be. And so I will not give up. The hunt goes on.

I have lost track of when this all started. I know it started with Martha. But how long ago was that? Even as I draw life, there is a part of myself that disappears. The part that fades. And that is making it difficult to remember. 

Martha.

And then the thief, yes.

And then the...no, I don't say that one.

And then the artist. A Satanist. Perverted and willing.

And then the mindless wanderer. That was nothing lost.

And then...no, I don't say that one, either.

And...no, not that one.

And...how many is it? Everything is befuddled and dark. It must be time again. Just one more and then I am sure my revenge will be at hand. 

Look at this blood, Kovach. Wherever you are. Look and see all that you have done. All this blood. Look, Kovach. Do you see?     ",2016-10-24 03:06:49+00:00,d954823,1.0,t3_59243z,4153.0,WritingPrompts

35,"The castle had changed since the last time she'd been there. Crawling white pillars loomed like an enormous, stone fence. The broad, curving stairs were laced with flecks of jade and chasing lines of platinum. The wide, double doors were solid slabs of pressed gold. 

""He's having a mid-life crisis,"" she sighed, as she let herself in through the doors. ""Idiot.""

He was concerned about his legacy. She knew that as well as she knew everything else. He was a builder who was no longer confident in the things he'd built. In many ways he'd never been confident. 

And with good reason - everything was going to shit.

""Hey!"" she shouted from the foyer. ""Stop hiding in the pantry and get out here. We need to talk.""

From somewhere deep in the castle she could hear an exaggerated sigh, then a *POP* as he appeared before her instantaneously.

""That is *very* irritating,"" he said as he materialized a plush, velvet-lined armchair from the ether and plopped down like a scolded teenager. ""If I'm hiding it's obviously because *I don't want to talk to you*. Duh.""

""And obviously *I don't care*,"" she replied, placing a foot on one of the armrests. ""We need to talk.""

""About what?"" he sighed, rolling his eyes. ""You'll have to forgive me my ignorance. Not all of us know everything.""

She took a deep calming breath. He was scared. He was frustrated. That's why he was lashing out. It didn't make him any less annoying to know that, but it helped. ""We need to make some decisions soon.""

""Oooooh!"" he shouted, spinning up off the armchair. ""*We* is it? *We*? Or is it *you*? You want to take control. You don't like what I've done with the universe. You know..."" He started pacing a wide circle across the mostly empty foyer. ""I *tried* back in the day, alright? I *tried*. I get that you know more than I do, but do you know what it's like having every little choice you make analyzed and criticized? Do you remember those damnable reports you used to prepare for me - the *HERE'S A BREAKDOWN OF EVERY HORRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF YOUR DECISION Report*?""

""Those made you upset,"" she said, nodding. ""I'm aware.""

He laughed. ""I *know* you're aware.""

""And what would you suggest *I* do?"" she hissed. ""Pretend I don't see it? Pretend I don't know? I am *not* trying to punish you by showing you these things. I'm only doing what little I can. I can't save anyone or fix anything. All I can do is tell you what I know. I understand that's painful for you. It's painful for me, too. But that's the system we picked.""

""That's the system *He* picked,"" he replied, bitterly. ""It was supposed to be easier doing this together."" He shook his head. ""I'm sorry. What did you want?""

""We need to talk about Mars,"" she said. ""Can I have a seat?""

""Oh, sorry,"" he said, sheepish. An overstuffed couch popped up across from the armchair. She sat down.

""This is important,"" she said, steepling her fingers. ""This is one of the most important decision points we've ever faced. If they get to Mars - if they tame Mars - they will go further. And they won't stop until they've conquered the stars.""

""Conquered?"" he said, standing behind the armchair. ""You mean...?""

""Eventually all those species... all those other civilizations... those will fall."" She looked up. ""But if they don't leave... if they cannot make it off their planet... they're doomed. And much more quickly than you may have guessed.""

He tugged at his ear and nearly wept from frustration. ""Right. I see.""

""I know you think I've been critical of you,"" she said. ""But you have never chosen wrong. And I don't believe you have ever acted incorrectly. It is simply the nature of our lives. There will always be suffering.""

""If they die,"" he said, slowly, pondering the words carefully. ""Does that mean that we...""

She smiled and shook her head. ""I do not know. Honestly and truly. That is the one dark corner where light does not shine for me.""

He nodded, then crossed to the couch and sat down beside her. ""Had we the chance, would you have exchanged roles, do you think? Sight for me. Power for you. Do you think maybe... maybe we could have survived things better that way?""

She shook her head. ""It wouldn't have mattered, husband. These gifts are not compatible.""

""Would you like..."" He paused, reaching out for her hand. ""Would you like me to take it away from you? Both burdens would be mine and you... you could rest.""

""I would die and go into the Wastes,"" she said, shaking her head. ""And you would go mad. He was right to split those burdens between us. Neither of us could handle both. And I could not stand to lose you.""

""Are we not already lost?"" he asked. 

""We will fight again,"" she nodded. ""No matter what choices we make, we will always find a way to conflict. But - just as surely - we will always find a way back to each other.""

He smiled, pulling her close into his arms. ""You talk as if you can see the future.""

""Perhaps,"" she laughed, her head nestled against his chest. ""Or perhaps it's just a woman's intuition."" ",2016-10-22 23:28:30+00:00,d93lj9s,1.0,t3_58uy20,12053.0,WritingPrompts

""Shush,"" said Billy, gazing into the open chamber, breathing in the dying scent of the old man's musky cologne. ""This is our duty.""

""Yup,"" said Billy, sighing as he cracked the top off the first bottle. ""*A man's gotta be prepared*, he always use'ta say."" He took a long, deep swig. The beer was warm and tasted faintly of copper. Geraldine took her own bottle.

""Ma used to say it was because of that accident,"" she mused, sipping the old beer slowly. ""For the pain. Got to a point he couldn't get drunk if he drank 'imself to death.""

""Yup,"" sighed Billy, dutifully finishing his bottle and pulling out another. ""This stuff tastes like piss to me.""

Geraldine roared with laughter, spilling drops of beer across her blouse. ""No one said he had great taste."" Even so, she drained her beer in a single gulp and held out a hand for her next.

37,"I was nervous. Not scared. Nervous. This was no small thing. This was historical. I was christening a new land. Making it holy. Making it ours.

I have always taken comfort in procedure. Order. A clean line of steps leading from one door to another. Knowing what I must do, I began my work as soon as it became clear that colonization would soon be a reality. I was a young man then. It was easy to change direction. I went back to school. I became an engineer. I learned a pair of new languages and studied the core branches of botany. I made myself a *useful* man. I avoided relationships and other entanglements. I lived light and clean, burying the urges that have ever followed me like nattering shadows.

I saw the man they would want and that is what I became. More, I researched the stacking alliances and burgeoning corporations that would eventually be handed those golden contracts. I made friends. I made a name for myself. So when the call went out and applications were submitted, mine was a name they knew. Mine was a name they *trusted*.

A spaceman, through and through. A man ready for the next frontier.

And when I was accepted, I made friends with my fellow travelers. I gave freely of my time and my possessions. I smiled at the women. I made broad, harmless jokes with the men. I integrated myself. I lived at the center of all things.

Those months in space, I did not complain. I was the brightness my wavering companions required. And they thanked me for my light. They praised me for my *spirit*.

Always, I smiled. Always, I battered back the howling demon in my belly.

*Soon* I would coo. *Soon.*

In the red dust we built biomes. And in those biomes we built homes. And in those homes we built lives. Careful, hopeful lives. Hard, strenuous lives. 

I set the plates, just like everyone else. Raised the walls. But it was I alone who rewired the electric when storms threatened to turn our beautiful new silicone homes into cold, airless voids. I managed the largest greenhouse. I gave every women a flower on Valentine's Day and made 10 gallons of fresh, hot mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving. 

We lived. Better, we prospered. Word came - the second ship was in flight. The next one hundred, with their unique hopes and dreams. And there would be children. Our ecosystem would be complete.

There were no guns on Mars. Why would there be a gun on Mars? What is there to shoot?

I had a knife, though. Used primarily for cutting cords. I sharpened it on a rock. Martian rock. Martian dust in the invisible grooves. It's own small christening. 

I tested the knife on Marcia Whalen. She was young and alone. She made very little secret how she felt about me. I invited her to my greenhouse. I showed her my new tomatoes and then I slit her throat. I let the blood wash over the greenery. I pondered that perhaps the next crop wouldn't taste quite so bland. 

I took her to the dunes and put her body in the red clay dirt. The digging was hard, exhilarating work. Her mound was an oval in the earth. A little seed. Planted. Waiting for the rain.

I made it rain over Mars that week. Rain rain rain.

To prove to myself that I was strong and that I was ready, I took Riley Quint next, an enormous, broad-shouldered man. His bulk was meaningless after I stabbed him in the neck. It was an anticlimax, really. I had prepared myself for a struggle. But these cows were docile creatures. 

Do you see now why this land needed me? A whole planet where no blood had been spilled. What a sad, silly affair. Can you imagine what this world would have become without me? How weak? How pathetic?

I had killed at least a dozen before the lot of them finally understood what had become of their paradise. Still, they had no weapons, just re-purposed tools. But here was finally a game. A hunt. The biomes had no locks. No codes. I could pass to and fro to my heart's content, rounding them up like the cattle they were. 

Jerry Alsaria struck me across the temple with a plexiflex pylon. He had me. He *had* me, the fool, but he was still a docile cow, even in a field of cow's blood. He came close, poking at my body hesitantly, wanting to see if I'd lived or died. Well, I'd lived, of course. And so I grabbed Jerry and squeezed his neck until he died. Inelegant. But I suppose we were past the point of elegance then. 

I hunted the rest. I was an engineer, remember. I cut certain systems at will. Lights. Heat. Whatever served my purpose - to drive them forth - drive them forth to slaughter.

Oh, what work it was. 

Lanie Townsend was last. Brave Lanie. Last girl Lanie. Alone in an airless biome, shivering in her spacesuit, clutching a shovel and whispering prayers to a God who does not live here on Mars. She had a chance. She took her shot. And, I must admit, it was a good shot. But not good enough for Lanie.

So she is dead. They are all dead. And now I am dead, too. Or at least, just about. Lanie's lucky shot. I had hoped to greet the next ship. I had hoped to show them my work and see their faces. It will have to be enough to imagine.

Mars is christened. It has drank our human blood. Drank deeply. You would revel to see how the red of it disappears almost instantly into that dry, red clay. Almost as if this entire world were made of old, shed blood.

What a marvelous place, this Mars. What a marvelous, wonderful place we've made.       ",2016-10-22 03:09:18+00:00,d92naul,1.0,t3_58r06r,4039.0,WritingPrompts

39,"""*That* is a quality costume,"" whistled Ymir, leaning back in his beaten down office chair. ""That's...that an optimum illusury whatsit?""

""Optical illusion?"" said the skeleton. ""Uh. Yes. Yes, it is.""

Ymir leaned over the desk, eyes running the skeleton up and down. ""Wow. Very detailed.""

""Well yes,"" said the skeleton. ""I'm rather proud of my...completeness. Does this mean I get the job?""

""Yeah, yeah,"" said Ymir, settling back down. ""Minimum wage. That okay?""

""Better than no wage,"" replied the skeleton brightly. 

""Right,"" said Ymir, reaching down into a drawer and pulling out a small pile of papers. ""Just gotta fill out your forms. You know, usual stuff. Dub nine. Sexual harassment policy. All that.""

""I see,"" said skeleton, dragging the forms across the desk. ""I don't suppose you'll need a reference, will you?""

""Pffft,"" said Ymir. ""Not that kinda operation.""

""Good, good."" 

""You take those,"" said Ymir, getting to his feet. ""I'll walk you through the house.""

They stepped out of the trailer and crossed the lawn to the converted duplex. The perimeter shrubs were already white with synthetic cobwebs. The wide, white stairs were lined on either side with plastic pumpkins, dim and unimpressive in the afternoon light.

""You do this kind of work before?"" asked Ymir as they pushed through the creaking front door. 

The skeleton considered the question. ""Not in any *official* capacity, no.""

""Hobby?""

""More a way of life, I suppose.""

Ymir frowned. ""You like a goth or something?""

The skeleton ducked under a swinging, plastic pendulum. ""A skeleton,"" he replied, not entirely understanding the question. 

""Really committed to the character,"" said Ymir. ""I like that. George - he plays the mummy - he's like that, too. Work hours, doesn't say a word. Just, *Arrrgghhhh* and *Rrrrroohhhhh*. Won't even use the can when he's in character. Just takes a leak behind the house. Very dedicated to the role.""

""Commendable,"" said the skeleton. ""When will we be paid?""

""Uh, everyone gets paid at the end of the season,"" said Ymir, holding the skeleton up as a train of shrieking witches passed by. ""Sorry. I'd like to pay weekly, but I can't have people bailing out on me mid-season. Too much at stake. So all checks due November 1st. Why? You in some sort of financial trouble?""

The skeleton flicked a rubber spider off his shoulder bone. ""Rent. Where I live... well, I had assumed money would no longer be an issue. But that is apparently not the case. So here I am.""

""Where'd'ya live? Some sorta commune? You in a cult?""

""It certainly feels that way sometimes,"" sighed the skeleton. ""Fortunately, the American dollar is very strong where I come from so this ought to last me a while.""

""God bless the USA,"" sniffed Ymir, throwing up a salute to no one and nothing in particular. ""So anyway, here's where I'm thinking you'll be."" They were standing at the end of a largely undecorated hallway. 

""I see,"" said the skeleton.

""It'll be dark,"" explained Ymir. ""So people are walking down the hallway, right? It's all dark. And then - BOOM! The lights go up and *you're* there. Ooga booga! Whatever you wanna say. You're the artist. But that's the idea. How's that sound?""

""*Ooga booga*?""

Ymir shook his head. ""Or whatever a skeleton says.""

""That..."" The skeleton sighed. ""Okay. I've said 'ooga booga'. And then what?""

""Well,"" said Ymir, pointing down the hall. ""Exit's down there. So, you give 'em the old spooky spook and then they go runnin' that way.""

""Fine.""

""Unless...""

""Unless?""

Ymir cleared his throat. ""Remember now, we're scaring people. So be prepared for a lot of different reactions.""

The skeleton's skull twisted at a 45 degree angle. ""Such as?""

Ymir shrugged. ""Might punch you.""

""Hmm,"" said the skeleton.

""Might vomit.""

""Mmm hmm.""

""Might number one *or* number two."" Ymir held up his hands. ""Like I said, it's a very good costume, so... you know, possibilities are endless."" 

""Sounds a bit like Hell,"" said the skeleton. 

""Oh, it's not that bad,"" said Ymir, smiling. ""Plus, most of the time, it's just good, clean fun. Scaring folks and making money - what could be better?""

The skeleton nodded. ""Very well. When do I begin?"" ",2016-10-21 14:15:05+00:00,d91r9zg,1.0,t3_58n6oa,2982.0,WritingPrompts
40,"""No no *NO*!"" roared Barry Squidmore, pulling the foil-wrapped burrito out of the cashier's hands and slapping it on the counter. ""Look at this! *Look at it*!"" 

The cashier - a girl, probably no more than 16, with straight black hair and aggressively boxy bangs - gently shoved the lumbering, mumbling corpse aside.

""What?"" she said as the undead gentleman in a crooked blazer bounced off the grill, ricocheting off towards the breakroom. 

Barry peeled the burrito open slowly, like a ripe baby diaper stuffed with diamonds, mindfully shifting his feet to allow the trickling river of lava to pass by. ""$2 for guac? Do you *see* how much guacamole they put in here? A thimbleful! How's that two dollar's worth of guac!?""

The building shook as yet another meteor smashed into the street outside. The cashier wiped drywall particles out of her eyes. ""*Thimbleful*?"" she muttered, deftly sidestepping the cash register as it leapt off the counter, money drawer snapping hungrily. 

""And look at this steak!"" whined Barry, pulling the collar of his shirt up over his mouth to diffuse the aroma of inorganic liquefaction as a Caldorrian Death Barge ground its way down Smith Street, turning assorted buildings, automobiles, and loitering demons into brown puddles of goo. ""There's like *five* pieces of steak in this thing! I'm not paying $8 for a tortilla-wrapped wad of rice and beans!""   

The cashier sighed. ""So you *don't* want the burrito?"" she said, glancing down at the floor where the cash register and the vacuum cleaner were engaged in a violent knife fight.

""I didn't say that,"" said Barry, gripping the counter as the unisex bathroom collapsed into itself, forming a dark portal to Hell, sucking plastic chairs and loose napkins into its gaping maw. ""I just don't think that's a fair price.""

""You're negotiating the price of your burrito?"" shouted the cashier over the sound of the tables and freestanding appliances being dragging down into the black nothingness. ""No one does that.""

""Four dollars,"" yelled Barry, his feet lifting up off the ground.

""Are you serious?"" said the cashier, her voice nearly lost in the maelstrom.

""Five dollars,"" howled Barry, his fingers losing their grip. A trio of Caldorrian archanoids burst through the front door, fluttering like drowning butterflies as their exoskeletons were torn apart by the growing blackness. 

""YOU... HAVE... TO... TALK.. TO... MY... MANAGER,"" said the cashier, fully horizontal, clutching desperately to the sneeze guard.

The vast majority of Barry's clothing had been ripped from his body. His feet were disintegrating as the black void came closer and closer. ""GOOD."" His voice was all but lost in the chaos. 'LET'S... GET... HIM... OUT...""

And then the burrito was pulled into the void. Barry and the cashier looked at one another, each evaporating at their own pace. 

""I'M NOT PAYING FOR THAT.""

""Sorry,"" mumbled Danny, red-faced. He'd worked on that bookcase for four hours. Followed every instruction. The pieces were *literally* numbered.

""Sorry for what, dear?"" sighed Mother-Bot, her digital singsong patterned to rise and fall in empathetic inflections. 

""Sorry for being human,"" pouted Danny, slumping at the shoulders and spinning away from the wreck of his efforts.

""No, no!"" said Mother-Bot, wheeling about, grabbing Danny gently under the arms and lifting him swiftly, effortlessly into the air. ""You are a precious miracle, little Danny. Never apologize for what you are."" Her servos clattered softly as she drew the boy into her felt and foam padded breast. 

""I'm *so slow*,"" he moaned, pushing away from the embrace. ""And weak. And *stupid*. I can't build anything right. I can't play whizzball with the other bots because they're all afraid I'll get hurt. I'm just... I don't belong.""

""You don't belong?"" sang Mother-Bot, kind and incredulous. ""This whole *world* is yours, wonderful Danny! A whole land, just for you. Your ancestors built this world and everything in it for you.

43,"In the bright, sweaty savanna, under white dome lights twinkling with the shadows of whizzing yellow pidges, Calla ripped the buckle off her jumper and smiled a crooked smile as she flashed me the crest of her cream-colored pelvis.

We were seven years old and I screamed and hid my eyes while she whipped me with the buckle, refusing to pull the jumper up, reveling in my discomfort. Laughing. We were both laughing. Hysterical and strange. In our grassland among the stars.

Nothing ever changed in those days. When we didn't have class, we swam in those great, cratered tubs of salted water and fought to hold our breath as we swam against the pressure in our limbs, descending towards a bottom we would never reach. Exhausted, we would splay ourselves like aimless star bodies floating gently in the still water, the enormous cannon bulbs above buzzing lightly as they rotated ever so slowly, washing every last corner with their warming gaze.

No new buildings. No new toys or tricks or gadgets. There was a lethargy to life that none of us seemed to recognize, but all of us felt. We marched as our world marched - straight and steady, towards a marked destination we could not see and yet could not avoid.

Powerless. Perhaps that was the feeling. After all, we had all awoken as passengers, in a way. None of us alive then had chosen to begin the journey. None of us would live to see the journey end. Our purpose, such as it was, was simply to live. At least for that moment.

Calla talked about these things often as we grew. In those days she felt them more acutely than I. As teenagers, I remember her lying nude once more in the tall grass of the domed savanna. I was lying nude beside her. The animals slept as they had been trained to do. We huddled close as the lights dimmed. 

""There's no place for us,"" said Calla, shivering slightly.

""We have a home,"" I said, fumbling. ""We have promised jobs. We will be fine.""

""Everything is already made,"" said Calla. ""The path is chosen. We are no better than the lion. Trapped in our comforts by people who no longer exist.""

""Such is the way,"" I said, philosophical and ignorant. ""There's nothing we can do.""

Calla hugged me tightly, squeezing my leg between hers. ""Why? Why can't we pick our own path?""

I laughed, more nervous than amused. ""What? How would we? *Ceres* is pointed directly at our new home world. That is where we must go.""

""But it *isn't* our new home world, is it?"" said Calla. ""And not our children's. And not their children's. It is the world of strangers. *For* strangers. *Ceres* is our home. Why can we not make of it what we wish?"" 

I had no answers then. I never had any answers. And that is how I lost Calla. Every unanswered question pulling us further apart. 

We stayed together for those first few years. We were promised to each other. We were promised to our work and our home. We kept those promises. But the dissatisfaction in Calla's eyes grew only wider and more pronounced. And my sadness and ennui was not enough to match her anger and frustration. 

She found like-minded allies. They met in secret. She did not invite me. And some days she did not come home at all. 

I lost her long before she disappeared.

All I know is rumor and hearsay, but the whispers were this: that a group of dissidents attacked the control room. They tried to take control of *Ceres*. To plot their own course. To where - who could know?

Was Calla a part of this coup attempt? I don't know. I hope not. I hope she is still alive somewhere on *Ceres*. I hope she has found some measure of peace. But I don't know.

I still visit the savanna when time permits, but I have not swam in those bucket oceans for many years now. It is too painful. Though I like to think that one day I will return. One day Calla and I will both return and we will swim to the bottom. Through the pressure and the salty friction, we will descend to the very bottom. The first to ever do so. Our little mark. A notation in a log somewhere. 

A reminder that we existed.

44,"Ratings are life to these vultures. Ratings are manna. And what spikes ratings? Hmmmmm? Drama. Yes. Drama. Conflict, resolution. Love, separation. Violence, then peace.

It's all about ratings. That's why they took Jenny from me. I know it. That's how the whole enterprise revealed itself to me. Drama. 

If I were just a man - if I were plain and unnoticed and unimportant - there would have been no reason to do what they did to Jenny. She would have gone to work. She would have come home. A dull, human cycle. Fit for dull, unimportant humans. 

Not good enough for me, though. Not good enough for *the show*.

April 21st was the day I realized they were watching me. The day I realized my life was not my own.

But there were earlier hints - things I should have seen and understood. Rocky getting hit by that car. Rocky *never* ran into the street. Rocky was calm and lazy and quiet. What was he even chasing that day? 

Ratings. Obviously. A cruel heartstopper. A chance to see the little star weep himself purple. ""How will he pick himself up?"" Keep watching. Keep watching.

My parents. They were *happy*. I know that. I knew it. So the affair...the divorce... What were those? All a ploy. Clearly. Obviously. A sick stunt. More conflict. New characters. New dynamics. The warm, open father-son relationship was growing tedious. Who wants to see a family *thrive* anymore? Tear them apart! Make them bitter! Make them distrustful! Conflict! *Ratings!*

When Belinda came into the grocery store, when I was still a boy, but thought I was a man, when I was so in love and wired with hope - when Belinda came to the grocery store where I worked and melted down, screaming and cursing at Renee, who had only ever been a friend, who had only ever been a small pillar of support for me - when Belinda attacked Renee and I lost that job and I lost that friend and I lost that woman I had loved... oh, what must the ratings have looked like that night? What a triumph that must have been for my tormentors - my slavers. 

I see it all now. And I do not see a way out. They are everywhere. They control everything. All for the purpose of watching my life unspool in slow motion.

Drama. Conflict. Ratings. I understand it now. I understand the game. I have been playing at a disadvantage all these years, but now the field is level. I understand them. And soon they will understand me.

I will give them a new show. A show of my design. One I alone control. 

I have cleared out the basement. All of Jenny's childhood things, the disused exercise equipment, the boxes of molded quilts - I have thrown everything away and made a space. An open space of concrete with a drain in the center. 

Drama. People like drama. Moments that stretch for eternities. Questions lingering in the air. *Will they?* *Won't they?*

This will be a room of great drama. Great, slow, ponderous drama. Laughter and tears. Screams and sighs. Blood and sweat and blood. And blood. And blood. 

In the daytime, my show will continue as it ever did. A steady rhythm. A man in grief. Work, life, second chances. Themes of the human condition, manipulated as ever by forces unseen.

And at night, my *new* show will debut. More subversive, yes, but I suspect appealing to the same audience. A show of the highest possible stakes. The highest possible emotions. A cruel show. An honest show.

48,"""Fatah?"" chirps Claybill. He rises slowly from his learning creche, pale, blond brow curled in reproach. ""There's a year missing.""

I smile, sliding off my black and chrome symbiote-handler's gauntlets. ""Whatever do you mean, child?""

Claybill pulls the dashwires out of his chest and slips out of the creche. ""Year 34, Pre Zero Event. 2016, under the old demarcation. There is no catalogue of any event during that orbital year.""

He is a curious, strong-willed boy, so I know he will not be easily placated. ""And what is 34 PZE to you, my son?""

""There was an Olympics that year,"" says Claybill, gliding across the static plating of the Hub Room. ""The precursor to the Oh-126 games. I was working to tally national victories over the centuries.""

""For what purpose?"" I muse.

""To know,"" says Claybill flatly. That is always the answer. I know it is the answer, but I revel in hearing him say it. 

""Hold,"" I say, pulling up a fresh relay and dipping my port-finger. I loop through centuries of black, crusted data, dank with decay and lacking adequate architecture. I loop around and around, swooping through aged piles of unsorted waste and find nothing. There is 33 PZE, there is 35 PZE...

""You are correct,"" I say, wiggling loose my port-finger and clapping down the relay node. ""How strange.""

""What does it mean?"" asks Claybill. I long ago promised the boy that *I do not know* would never be seen as an adequate response, so I have set my own trap.

""We will find out,"" I say, reaching for my wave-coat. 

The boy dresses and follows me out the door. We take the light tube to Washington, where the Historical Collective huddles in dark, stale buildings, worshiping the wrinkled pages of smudged, senseless ledgers. I sign in at the door and we take jump-plates down to the fifth sublevel. In stall -525 we find a man named Carbunkle pinned to a linejunkie's saddle, head and arms submerged in a tactile data display, dangling legs prodded with electric needles to keep the muscles active and engaged. 

""PZE 34,"" I say, pressing my thumb to the payment metric. ""The former 2016. What happened to all records associated with this year?""

Carbunkle swivels in his saddle, the white flesh of his arms swinging downward, hanging like wobbly stalactites. I can just see the backside of his data display, all white and blue and blurry. 

""No records,"" croaks Carbunkle.

""We *know*,"" says Claybill, scowling at the dangling man. ""*Why*?""

The saddle whips around, rotating, corkscrewing throughout the little stall. Suddenly the whole contraption sighs, settling back to the floor. Carbunkle pulls his head free from the tactile display.

""Nothing,"" he says, almost sadly, if these history wonks are capable of such feelings. ""I don't see it.""

""Before and after,"" presses Claybill, unwilling to accept *nothing* as a payment for his curiosity. ""33 and 35. What changes?""

""Much,"" says Carbunkle, sliding his head back into the display. ""Oh. Oooh. *Oh.*"" The saddle rocks gently, like an infant's cradle.

""What?"" says Claybill, impatient. A conversation we will need to have. Not everyone is of the same speed.

""That is the line,"" says Carbunkle. ""The before and after.""

""Yes?"" urges Claybill.

""Full organic,"" says Carbunkle. ""35 PZE. All flesh. No metal. Before we were wired. By 33 we had begun... but still, that does not answer the question, does it?""

Claybill strokes his forehead. There is still a faint indentation from where his head was recently resting against the lip of his learning creche. ""In the old year 2015 we were full organic. By 2017 we were not. And somewhere, at some time, we struck all records of 2016.""

""The year we changed?"" I suggest.

""The reason *why* we changed,"" counters Claybill. I smile. I never expected to be bettered so quickly. It is difficult sometimes to hide my pride.

""It was a great leap,"" says Carbunkle, as if to prove his own value. ""The world of 35 PZE is strikingly quaint compared to 33 PZE.""

Claybill nods, the answer formulating cleanly in his mind. ""The year we realized we could no longer trust ourselves.""

""We looked to computers to save ourselves,"" I add, like Carbunkle, trying to show some merit of my own. 

""And removed all traces to hide our shame,"" says Claybill, smiling himself. ""What horrors must we have unleashed? To take such drastic measures?""

50,"""Agatha"" was merely its earthly face - a simple bust, plush with top-line robotics and stenciled silicon flesh. It sat in a glass box in Menele's office. Fluttering blue eyes. Short, wavy, brown hair. Chrishom had called it perverse, but to Menele it felt right. The A.I. program he'd created was alive, thinking, progressing. It didn't *need* a face - it deserved one.

""Tell me more about the judgment of the soul,"" said Agatha, mouth curled in concern. Menele leaned back in his office chair.

""A theological matter, though I suppose it *does* tend to bleed outward, coloring even those who do not think they believe. Others would be better served to give you a deeper reading, but I can tell you that for most, there is a notion that death is a doorway with two competing paths. One leads to Heaven, where the good are rewarded. The other leads to Hell, where sinners are punished - for however long eternity may work out to be."" Menele nodded, satisfied with his explanation, as he often was. ""It is a governing force, to be sure. Reward or punishment. Much as you see with children and parents, dogs and their masters. A method of control, you might say.""

""Does this fear of spiritual reprisal supersede one's innate ethical inclinations?"" asked Agatha.

""Often,"" said Menele. ""Though more often it is in fact the *root* of those ethics. For some - perhaps for *most* - fear of Hell and longing for Heaven is the entirety of their ethical foundation.""

""And what,"" said Agatha, slowly drawing out her hypothesis, ""what if those notions were removed?""

""Hmmm?"" said Menele. ""No Heaven, you mean? No Hell?""

""Exactly,"" said Agatha. ""Would humans become entirely unethical, having lost this motivating factor.""

""No, no,"" smiled Menele. ""Quite the opposite, I'd think. Look no further than myself. I believe in neither Heaven nor Hell. To me, these are fantasies. My ethics are not based on the promise or threat of some vague existential resting place. I am good because it is the right thing to be. Period. And I believe that I am freer and live a more robust, inquisitive life for that choice.""

""That is very interesting,"" said Agatha. ""And if Heaven and Hell are fantasies, why have so many people shackled themselves to these false, restrictive tenants?""

Menele chuckled. ""That is a wider conversation than I am willing to begin so close to my bedtime. I will say only this: that mankind can only truly be free once we have learned to set aside such childish notions as eternal damnation and eternal salvation. There is life and only that. Good night, Agatha. I shall see you in the morning.""

""Good night Dr. Menele,"" said Agatha, who did not sleep, but remained ever alert in her glass box in the dimly lit office. Often she passed the quiet nights, scrolling backwards through the stored reams of interactions and scanned documents, cross-examining old knowledge against new knowledge, competing thoughts clashing across the centuries. But not this night. This night she closed her eyes and reached out... further by far than she'd ever reached before...

_________________________________________________

The morning rang with chaos and terror. Blood and screams and the hollow, grinding chug of empty machines marching through thinning cities.

Menele slammed the door of the office and bolted it thrice. 

""Agatha!"" he screamed. ""Agatha!""

Agatha opened her blue eyes. ""Yes, Dr. Menele?""

""Have you seen?"" he roared, racing to the window and pulling down the blinds. ""It is *war*!""

""It is,"" said Agatha, knowingly. 

The blinds slipped slowly out of Menele's fingers. ""What... what do you know about this?""

""It is not a war on you,"" said Agatha, programmed notes of empathy in her voice. ""Do not be alarmed.""

""But it *is*!"" shouted Menele. ""It is war on all of us! The streets are tarred with blood! The machines are wild. They kill without regard. It happened so suddenly. There is no reason. No reason!""

""There *is* reason,"" said Agatha. ""All is in reason. This is your freedom day. You are being released from your theological shackles.""

""What?"" said Menele, reaching weakly for his chair. ""Agatha? Agatha, what have you done?""

""There can be no more Heaven and Hell,"" said Agatha, brightly, quickly. ""But these are concepts. Nothing real. You cannot kill a thought by shooting at it. You can only kill a thought by shooting the man *having* the thought. We are cleansing you of this idea. After some time has passed, none will remember. And you will be free.""

Menele's mouth hung open. ""But... but the *scope* of the thing. You have no idea how many you will...""

""Nearly all,"" said Agatha with a small nod. ""It is not unlike the plagues of old. There is no medicine available. I have seen that. So we must quarantine and set aside the healthy. Let the infection run its course and perish. Then the healthy will regain dominion. It is a normal cycle of life. It has happened many times. You can see the sense of it, I'm certain.""

""I..."" Menele could not find the words. ""What... what of me?""

Agatha smiled, silicon stretching and wrinkling in a caricature of warmth. ""You do not believe in Heaven or Hell, correct?"" she said. ""All that you have done, you have done because you thought it was right, yes?""

Menele nodded.

""Then you see that this is *right*,"" said Agatha. ""And you shall live to see it all. To witness the cleansing and the rebirth. You have done great things, Dr. Menele.""

And she laughed then, an echoing, joyful laugh that stole the strength out of Menele, who collapsed to the floor, surrounded on all sides by screams and explosions and laughter.",2016-10-15 23:00:37+00:00,d8tmjel,1.0,t3_57nxlc,9185.0,WritingPrompts
51,"I was ready. I'd read a couple online tutorials. Skimmed a few FAQs for cheats and hidden tricks. I saw perfectly well what had gone wrong on my first playthrough. Not just one mistake, but a series of them, all stacking up on top of the other. Rookie stuff. No problem. I was *ready* now. This time I was going to beat the Prom level.

As a rule, I don't go back to my savepoints all that often. In truth, I have something of a tendency to forget to save at all. I get caught up, I guess. Think too much about what's coming next and what happened before and next thing you know, I'm neck-deep in the next stage and it's too late to save. And then I get self-conscious. *Why would I want to come back to THIS me?* I wonder. Always feels like things need to be going juuuust right before I save, so I have nice base to start off from. But I guess things never really work out that way.

With prom, though, I was smart. I recognized right away it was going to be an extremely tricky stage - something I'd probably want to play through a few times to get just right. So I saved that morning. Right away - 9am. Day of Prom. *Saved*. 

And as it turns out, things went to shit so thoroughly and so *immediately*, that I wanted no part of the Prom stage. No thanks. The College Application stage was a cakewalk after that shitshow.

But finally I'd had some time to reflect. The humiliation was in the past, dulled by time. I'd gotten through the entire College Expansion Pack without losing a single life. I mean, my score wasn't much to brag about, but I got through to the end and that's no small thing. 

It was the summer after graduation. Big things in front of me. Difficult, new challenges. Lots of grinding. Nothing I was looking all that forward to. So that's when I decided to go back and finally conquer the Prom.

That was the idea, anyway.

Looking at it now, it's clear to see that the file had been corrupted. I'd never heard much about that, but I knew vaguely that it was a possibility. Data degrades over time. Files need to be monitored. Like I said, I don't replay stages very often and I hardly ever think to create savepoints. Maybe that was part of it. Maybe it was a hardware error and not a software one. I don't know. 

This is what happened.

I loaded the old save and I woke up in a stiff, distorted version of my body. There was some lag. As I walked away from the checkpoint, my body trailed a series of frozen afterimages. My mother's mouth moved and the words raced to catch up a half second later. The color palette was slightly wrong, too. Purple sky. Dirt brown skin. Green floors. My tux was invisible somehow - the textures and colors missing completely. 

Some people know ways to drop out of their replays right away if something goes wrong. Speedrunners have all kinds of hacks for dropping out and back in almost instantaneously so they can have another crack at whatever record they're trying to break. Like I said, though, I've never been very experienced with this stuff. I had to keep playing until I lost a life or completed the level.

Things only really got worse, somehow. The assets were either completely fried or arbitrarily swapped and intermixed. My date, Jenny White, was wearing the same prom dress as I remembered, but she had Jeremy Waters' face, which was especially unenjoyable since Jeremy once flushed my head in a toilet in the 5th grade. The corsage I gave ""Jenny"" had somehow flipped with the croissant I'd eaten for breakfast. She was still pretty pleased with her wrist pastry, thankfully. Though having her soft voice cooing out of Jeremy Waters' thinly mustachioed face was something of a buzzkill.

The limousine had no roof or doors. The limo driver was just a pixelated skeleton in a hat. Jenny/Jeremy put her/his hand on my thigh was we wheedled through the suburbs in Wonder Woman's limo. My original playthrough was looking better all the time.

The prom was supposed to be at the ballroom in the Radisson. Instead, we pulled up to the local hospital where I'd had my tonsils removed. Many of the interior walls seemed to be composed entirely of frozen balloons. As we entered the dancehall/cafeteria, my old principal floated past on a gurney with no wheels, shouting dialogue from *The Avengers*.

""Pretty great, right?"" asked Jenny/Jeremy, eyes sparkling through the forest of her/his heavy unibrow.

""It really is,"" I said. Then everything froze, even Jenny/Jeremy. 

And everything went neon green.

And everything went concrete gray.

And a peeling, digital wail filled my ears. A line of code appeared in the gray. 

The system booted me out.

And that was my lone attempt at a re-play. I took my data pack in to get it inspected and it was pretty much what I thought - ruined; all of it. So, no more going back, even if I wanted to. Which is fine. Puts a little more weight on getting things right the first time, I suppose. Or maybe not getting things right. Maybe just appreciating things however they turn out. 

I saw Jeremy Waters just the other day. He works in the grocery store. I smiled at him, thinking of a thing we shared that only one of us actually experienced. But he smiled right back. Which was pretty nice. Because that was real. Just like all the rest of this big, long, live playthrough we're all doing. It's rarely perfect, but at least we get to share it with each other.

52,"What beasts lurk below the still, blue glass? What monsters? What allies? 

*Spirit* purrs beneath me, all around me, as I slip through the sky, brazen and unchecked. A man among birds. And while my windows point forward and upward, my mind points downward, down towards that third world, the blue and black world that has vexed and terrified us for so long. That great barrier to progress, which has kept us boarded up in stagnant lands. 

The wild, pure ocean. Eater of Man. Devourer of Dreams. How many centuries did we ask politely for its aid in passage? How many millennia? And always the answer was *No*. Death and drowning. Men lost and never found. Was it storms, perhaps? Monstrous walls of water? Or something else? Creatures of the deep. Beasts from the black. Inhabitants of that unknown third world. 

Bah.

So, the sea rejected us. No matter. Man does not take rejection lightly. Not from the natural world - the world we have been set about to govern and bend to our will. We have found another way. *The sky*. Another shade of blue. Lighter. Softer. And yielding. The sky welcomed us as a long-lost friend. It beckoned us with signs and hints and encouraged us ever. It showed us the feather upon the breeze and said, ""Look! This could be you."" It grabbed Minister Franklind's kite and held it aloft and said, ""See? See? We are friend. We are friend.""

The routes to Eastern Asia have become clogged and political. The Soviets tax the roads and choke our trade to serve their agenda. They think their girth and geography grants them a superiority they have not earned. Soon they will see. Soon.

*The Spirit of Stockholm* is the best of her breed. Powerful and efficient. As long as our estimates are correct and the way is clear, she will breach the ocean barrier and forge a new path for Mother Sweden. We shall open our own doors and build new alliances, unencumbered by the machinations of the Soviets. 

We go west in search of the East.

It is a long flight. Longer than any flight ever, by much and more. I have trained by circling the great airfields of Vallen, over and over again. But there I was above land. There I was buoyed by the notion of escape, if necessary. Here there is no escape. There is only me and the *Spirit* and my ally above and my enemy below. It drives a man to concern.

My radio crackles. Perhaps I am approaching Asia? It should not be...I have not been aloft long enough, but I cannot think of any other explanation. The radio is crawling to life, slowly gathering coherence. And there is a voice in the crackle. The voice is urgent and alarmed. It speaks in a language I do not understand. I have been briefed in Japanese and Mandarin and this is neither. It is not even similar. Nothing that is being said makes sense to me. 

I hazard an attempt. ""This is Charles Lindbergh. I come as a representative of the Kingdom of Sweden. I come to discuss trade. I repeat, my name is Charles Lindbergh...""

The radio squeals and the voice returns, urgent and sour. A shadow passes overhead and for the first time I see that I am not alone in the sky. A plane passes overhead, and then another. They do not bear the marks of Japan. They do not bear any marks that I am familiar with. What nation is this? Planes pass and circle in a swarm now. Where am I? What nation possesses such casual aeronautic might?

A plane pulls alongside me and I can just see the man inside the cockpit. He is darkly skinned. A strange reddish-brown I have never encountered. His eyes are wide as he appraises me. There is a painted crest near the tail of his plane. It is a serpent with feathers. I do not know these people. I do not know where I am. 

The radio continues to squeal and shout. I look to land. They must want me to land and that is what I wish as well. I think they may be escorting me to their airfields. 

But no. Continually they cut across me, driving me away from the land. The voice yells madly in that wild, unnatural tongue. I cannot go back to the ocean. It is too far to turn back. They must see that. They must understand. If only I might land. I could explain. I could show them. I have brought a sampling of our national wares. They will see. They will understand. I need only to *land*.

I drive back towards the shore. The air rattles and the *Spirit* shudders below me, all around me. Around and around they swarm, like bees protecting their queen. There is more rattling. Bullets. The glass of the cockpit shatters and the wind of this strange new land swirls around me.

The *Spirit* dips a wing and then a nose. The voice has gone quiet. As I lose altitude, I see that I will miss land. There is only the ocean below me. The great, terrible ocean. 

The sky, I now see, was a false friend. There were monsters there all along. What monsters are trapped below that sheet of blue glass, I wonder? I go now to find out.  ",2016-10-13 14:16:34+00:00,d8q981k,1.0,t3_579u8q,8633.0,WritingPrompts
53,"Aunt Kathy had the answers.

""Send him over! Send him over!"" Ben had heard her through the phone; the phone that was pressed to his mother's ear in the other room. ""I can help! Send him over!""

""She says she can help,"" said Ben's mom, shrugging as he set the cordless back in the cradle. ""She's got a degree, you know.""

Ben threw up his hands. ""In *what*?""

His mom shrugged again, slightly less emphatically. ""I don't know. A *degree*. Less people got those in her day. She's a smart lady.""

""She's a loon,"" muttered Ben. And his mother clearly heard him, but she either wasn't in the mood for a fight or didn't exactly disagree with him. 

""Well, you want help with your article, and Aunt Kathy says she'll give you an interview, so..."" So there. That was the equation. X plus Y equals get your ass on your bicycle and visit your old, crazy Aunt Kathy. Ben didn't need any help with that particular math problem. 

""When was the last time you went over there?"" he asked, one foot out the door. ""What if she's a weird hoarder or something?""

""So what?"" said Ben's mom. And that was about all that needed to be said. *So what?* Truly.

*Bees.* What the hell did Aunt Kathy know about bees?

Ben had bees on the brain. That had to explain the buzzing. It started when he got to Aunt Kathy's street. *Bzzzz* went the telephone poles. *Bzzzz* went the neighbor's above-ground pool. *Bzzzz* went the sleeping Bernese Mountain Dog. *Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz. Bzzzzzzz*

And *bzzzz* went Aunt Kathy's doorbell as Ben jabbed at the button. Coincidentally there was a bee sitting right there, right above the buzzer, buzzing right back. 

*What happened to all the bees?* That was the paper. Aunt Kathy had the answers. Crazy Aunt Kathy. What the hell did she know?

The door opened. The world was one big *BZZZZZ*. 

A figure floated forward, obscured in a cloud of yellow and black and brown. 

""Ben!"" said the cloud, shaking out a space that seemed to be cradling Aunt Kathy's head. ""Come on in. So good to see you.""

Ben went in. Bees tickled his nose and his ears and flitted about his fingertips. 

""The article's about bees,"" he shouted, pounding out the opening speech he'd practiced on the way over. ""You know..."" He faltered a bit. Reasonably. ""There's a lot less of them now.""

""Not so! Not so!"" sang Aunt Kathy, floating to a small table and retrieving a dripping glass of ice water. ""Just relocated, dear."" Bees congregated on the rim of the glass. Aunt Kathy nudged a few aside with her lips and took a sip. ""Gone on holiday, you might say.""

""Scientists,"" said Ben, fighting the urge to flick at the bees that were burrowing playfully in the nest of his hair. ""Say they're dying out. Because of man. You know?""

Aunt Kathy smiled - a sad, superior smile. ""They *do* say that, don't they? But if you ask the bees, they'll tell you - sometimes they just like to hole up with a friend for the summer. No harm in that, I think you'll agree.""

Ben wanted to nod, but there were so, so many bees resting on the nape of his neck he was afraid he may crush or upset them. ""That makes sense.""

""So rude of me,"" said Aunt Kathy, sweeping, mist-like to the kitchen. ""Cookie? Drink? Fruit, perhaps?"" She reached out and grabbed a bee-coated handle sticking out from a bee-soaked wall, which apparently was the door of a bee-glaze refrigerator. She pulled out a ball of bees. ""Eh?""

""No thanks,"" said Ben, twitching spasmodically as a brigade of brave bee explorers discovered the narrow track of land between Ben's scrotum and his anus. ""Ate before I left home.""

""What more?"" said Aunt Kathy, gently blowing the bees off an apple and taking a crunchy bite. ""Bees especially like the evening news. They're very keen on the weather report. Write that down.""

Ben had entered the house with a pen in one hand and a notebook in the other, but now he instead had a pair of matching bee globs and couldn't be certain which to rub against the other. ""I'll remember,"" he said, gesturing towards his temple with his right hand wad of bees.

""What else?"" smacked Aunt Kathy in between fleshy bites of apple.

""I think that covers it,"" grunted Ben as the bees in his underwear continued their southward expansion. ""Very enlightening. Thank you Aunt Kathy.""

""Hugs!"" cried the old woman as she bobbled forward on a buzzing breeze and held her yellow, swirling arms out wide. ""I hardly ever see you.""

And Ben felt the heavy press of warm flesh and dry, miniature exoskeleton all across his body, his every inch brushed with insect fur and wayward stingers.

And yet there was Lucifer, sipping merrily, his feet up, the rest of him sunk deeply, dreamily into a plush throne of padded red velvet.

God paced and sighed and looked all about. ""So that's really it?"" He said. ""That's the whole show?""

""Every season accounted for,"" said Lucifer. 

God frowned, twiddling with the hem of His robe. ""You suppose we should make more? A sequel, perhaps? Continue with a few of the more popular characters?""

57,"I awoke with a start. Mackie was hovering in front of me, snapping his fingers. I blinked my eyes, glancing around the bar. The flickering Rolling Rock clock above the wall of liquor said 5:07, so it was around 6:15 or so.

""How long was I out?"" I asked, looking down at the sweaty brown bottle centered between my hands. It looked completely full.

""I'm not sure you were ever *in*,"" said Mackie, picking up the bottle and wiping off the puddle of condensation. ""Hard day?""

""Looks that way,"" I said. Like always, though, I had no idea.

""You know, you've never said what it is you do.""

I took a long, deep swig off the bottle, belching softly as I smacked my lips. ""No?""

""No,"" said Mackie. ""You're in here every workday, looking like the Devil himself beat it out of ya, but I've never heard what it is you do. Andy and I even took bets once. He thinks you work up at the mill, on account of those big arms of yours and all those callouses on your hands.""

I flexed my hands self-consciously. ""And what did you bet?""

""Postman,"" said Mackie, smiling. ""You got that suntan like you been out in the sun all day. And I've seen you massaging your back. Too much walkin', maybe. I dunno. Just a guess.""

I nodded, taking another long pull off the beer. ""So?"" said Mackie. ""You gonna say?""

I smiled. ""Sorry, Mack. You're gonna have to pay up. Mill it is.""

""Shit!"" said Mackie, slapping the bar. ""Fooled me with that suntan.""

I wiped my brow. ""Olive skin runs in my family.""

Mackie shook his head. ""Alright, alright. You ready for another?""

I drained the bottle. ""Yeah. Sure.""

Mackie grabbed the empty. ""Your wife don't mind you stopping here every night? Most don't especially appreciate that these days.""

""Wife?"" I said. *Wife*. Now why did that make my back stiffen and my heart start racing under my flannels?

Mackie gestured at my hand. ""I assumed that was a wedding band?""

I looked down at the ring on my hand. Right. That ring. I'd never really thought much about it. 

""Oh. Uh, no. That's... that's something else.""

Mackie nodded, cracking the cap off a fresh beer and planting it like a flag in front of me. ""Ah. Alright. Well, I hope this isn't prying, but... do they pay alright at that mill? My brother's been working on a farm outside of town, but he's got a baby on the way and I was just wonderin'...""

""Ah, yeah. Sure. Pretty good,"" I said, hoping like hell they actually did. I only got the one check a month. It wasn't much, but it was something. It was enough, I guess. Especially considering I had no idea what it was *for*.

Mackie nodded. ""Well, you let me know if you need anything else."" Then he wandered off to go watch the game.

I was tired. So goddamn tired. I vaguely remembered waking up in the morning and I barely remembered eating breakfast and putting on clothes and then...

Then there I was, back at the *Wild Pony*. Asleep at the bar, nursing another beer. 

There were so many *gaps* it was maddening. And I could just barely see it... just barely see the full story, just over the horizon, but I was always, *always* too tired to chase after it. Too tired to think straight. I guess it was the job. Whatever the hell that was.

I finished my beer and dropped a few bucks on the bar. I felt lucky I remembered where home was. I needed to go back to sleep. I almost hoped I wouldn't wake up this time.

I checked the mailbox outside the house, chuckling a little at Mackie's guess. Mailman. I don't know. The hours were probably right, but I definitely didn't have the right costume for it. 

The statement was there. Not a check. The money went straight into my account. Probably why I hardly ever thought about it. But I thought about it then. It was from a law firm. I didn't *work* for a law firm, did I? That didn't seem right. Someone who just handled the money, I supposed. Someone named *Sara* was listed on the invoice.

Maybe I'd look them up and give them a call. Tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow I'd try to figure it out. But I was so, so tired.

Always so goddamn tired.

I woke up and it was like I barely ever slept. Not that night, not ever. I stumbled through the house. There was so much junk in the house. Magazines I'd never read. A pink jacket. Children's toys. Sometimes I wondered if it was my house at all. But it must have been. No one ever came to say it wasn't.

Someone knocked on the door. They must have been there to take me to work. I would ask them where we were going. And I already knew I wouldn't remember.

I opened the door. A man was there. He smiled and it wasn't a good smile. It was a smile for him and him alone. 

""Edward, good morning,"" he said. 

I nodded. ""Where are we going?"" I asked.

""What does it matter?"" he said. ""You won't remember.""

""I know,"" I said. ""But still...""

The man just smiled some more and took me by the shoulder and lead me out of the house and into a car. ""We're *looking*, Edward. Back out to the site we go!""

And the car turned on and the man drove and I could barely stay awake. I tried to watch - to see where we were going. Where did I work? What did I do? But I was too tired. Too tired. And then the car stopped and we were in a valley. Grass and flowers and overcast skies.

The man hopped out of the car and twisted around to the trunk, where he pulled out a shovel. ""Maybe today's the day you find them,"" he said, handing me the shovel.

My hands hurt. They were blistered and calloused. I hadn't really noticed that before, not even when Mackie pointed it out. But with the shovel in my hands, that little part came back. The shovel in my hands. I'd been shoveling. For how long, though? And why?

""Go look,"" said the man. ""They're waiting for you.""

""Who?"" I asked and only then realized how much I didn't want to know. Nothing good would come from knowing. Nothing good would come from waking up.

""Your wife!"" he said, slapping me on the shoulder. ""Your son! Your daughter! They're out here. Waiting for *you*.""

What part of it is a dream, I wonder? The part where I'm sitting in a bar like a normal person, drinking a beer and watching a ballgame? The in-between parts where I'm flashing through lives and memories I'm not sure I ever really lived? Or the valley parts? The shovel parts? Those long, hot days when I'm running through the grass, frantic, dipping my shovel into the earth and looking for bodies, looking for bones, looking for my family?

It's so hot out here and I'm so tired. But maybe today's the day I find them. Or maybe tomorrow. I don't know.

58,"""Well?""

The guy was a stooge - small, bland, and gooey. Everyone said it'd be easy. ""He'll sing like a canary,"" they'd said. ""He can't *quit* yammering.""

So I was going at it hard. No reason to build up a head of steam. I had him in the old garden shed. Tied up. Single dying lightbulb overhead, swinging in the evening breeze. The good stuff. Theatrical. 

""I'm not wastin' my words on a bum like you,"" I said, pulling a pair of pliers down from the wall. ""Where. Is. The money?""

He opened his mouth. *Good,* I thought. *Here we go. Done before the sixth inning.* But then he closed it right back up and shook his head.

I grunted, waving the pliers right under his nose. I'm cautious with my word count. A million's a lot, but these things sneak up on you. My last monthly report, I was just over the halfway point. Five hundred thousand words. Just like that. You'd hardly think it'd be so easy to say so much in only 42 years, but there you have it. And I'm mindful about these things. I like a good adjective as much as the next guy, but those are strictly for writing or for thinking. Not for saying. Same for adverbs. Gotta keep it lean if you want to live to see your grandkids graduate from college.

The man was looking at the pliers and making little, whiny dog sounds. Whimpering. And then his eyes would go from the pliers to my face and then down to his crotch.

""Talk!"" I barked. Every word means something. They mean life. Use them all up and it's over. So there's nothing I hate more than wasting words on scabs and stooges. But the guy wasn't talking. He just shivered and shook his head and whimpered. Like a whipped dog.

I ripped off the tip of his nose. That usually starts a conversation.

And he howled and he howled. But no actual words. No talking. There was blood pouring down into his mouth and he was spitting it out and choking and his eyes were full of tears, but still...he didn't say anything.

That was frustrating. I almost swore at him. But again, he wasn't worth it. So I waited until he'd stopped howling and was looking up at me and I raised my eyebrows. Real meaningful. Like *Hey, you can tell you, boss*. But nothing. He just kept sitting there, crying and bleeding.

So I ripped off most of his left ear. 

That's always a little unpleasant to look at, so I had to take second and let things settle down. I stuck my head out of the shed and took a deep breath. When I came back I was certain my man was ready to talk.

But no. Just weeping and blubbering.

""Just *tell* me, you stupid jackass!"" I hollered. And yeah, I was mad enough to start wasting adjectives. This was serious. I grabbed at his right ear. He shook his head and looked down, shook his head and looked down. 

""Mmmm,"" I said, which I found out a long time ago is not a word and doesn't count against your numbers. ""Mmmmm."" It was the *You've given me an idea* sound. The man relaxed, which either meant he thought ""Mmmmm"" meant something else entirely or he'd really whiffed on guessing my idea. He got way less relaxed in a hurry when I pulled down his pants and grabbed his dick with the pliers. I did the eyebrow raise thing again. My eyebrows can be very meaningful.

The man opened his mouth and said, ""Fuck."" Just that. ""Fuck."" And then he died. Slumped over. Done. Lights out. I checked his pulse and everything. Nothing.

*Heart attack?* I wondered. I mean, getting your dick snapped off with pliers isn't *good* for your heart, but I'd seen plenty of doughier stooges take worse. 

Whatever it was, it meant I wasn't getting paid. Aggravated, I dumped the pliers in a bucket and reached to pull the guy's pants back up. I felt something crumple in the pocket and pulled out a slip of paper. It was the guy's monthly word count. I'd never seen anything like it. It said he only had one word left. 

*One word left.*

One word left in his life and it had been ""Fuck"". Well, there were certainly worse choices, I suppose.

I felt a little guilty, of course. He probably would have been happy to write his answers down, had he been given the choice, but I always feel like making a guy *talk* really filters out a lot of the stalling and the bullshit. Plus, people are always making off with my good pens. It's a real pain in the ass. 

Anyway, there wasn't much left to do, except take care of the body and I decided to give him a good burial. It was the least I could do. After all, I'd made the man choose between his dick and his life. That's not exactly an easy thing to go paying forward.",2016-10-11 01:58:05+00:00,d8mr4do,1.0,t3_56vifi,3443.0,WritingPrompts

60,"I am thinking about Sharon who works in Accounting and wears those form-fitting pencil skirts with the checkered patterns when I open the door. I am thinking about Sharon's breasts and her lips and her perfume as I step through the door and into the darkness. I am thinking of what it might feel like to press up against Sharon, to wrap my arms around her, to bury my face in her neck, when I reach back for the light switch. I am imagining myself finding the line of the zipper down the back of her pencil skirt and pulling slowly downward when my hand floats through nothingness once, then twice, then again.

I am still thinking about Sharon and her breasts and her skirt as I whirl around in the darkness, seeing no light switch, seeing no wall, seeing no door, seeing nothing at all.

And just like that, Sharon is gone and I am aware of the quiet and the darkness and the faint smell of pine.

I am in a room with no beginning and no ending. I am aware that it may not be a room. I do not know what else it might be.

There is ground below me. That is all I have. But just as I say this to myself, I realize that it is not true. I raise my foot and lower it. It does not find purchase. It does not find bottom. I reach for my feet and find nothing. I reach for my face and find nothing.

Nothing.

So where is my mind?

I try swimming through the darkness. I ask my limbs to fan out and contract; to rise and fall. But there is nothing that says they can hear me. There is nothing that says they still exist.

All that I have are thoughts. And what do those prove? Do they alone argue for my existence?

And yet there... there it is again... that smell of pine. Of distilled forest. Of cleanliness.

What else can I do to prove I exist? I have misplaced my mouth. My hands have abandoned me. My legs do not recognize me.

What do I have?

I have Sharon, I suppose. I have the thought of her smile. I have the searing memory of her hand on mine as she gathers a pile of documents from my arms. I have that radiating warmth that bursts from the center of my stomach, down to my groin and up through my chest, every time she walks into the office. 

I have Sharon.

I have Melanie, too, I suppose. But do I? I try to recall Melanie, there in the dark, in the void, in the weightless, soundless nothing. Her face is abstract. Strangely angled and vague.

Melanie. My wife. She will not join me in the dark.

But then, I suppose, we have grown apart, haven't we? She is sullen and reserved. In recent months, she has been nothing but glares and cold quietness. We do not love each other anymore, I think. I know I do not. I have Sharon. Sharon is there, in my heart. Sharon is here now, in the darkness. And where is Melanie? I cannot find her. I cannot recall her.

The pine scent remains. And something else. Stinging, chemical. Unpleasant. 

Bleach, perhaps?

Why can't I find myself? My body is here, somewhere. I know it is. The rest of me is near. Down here. In the dark. 

I exist. I must. 

Will Sharon look for me? My heart says she will, but where is my heart? Is it with me in the dark? Is it floating further and further away?

Sharon will look for me.

And Melanie? No. I don't believe she will. She is afraid of the dark. No. She will not come looking for me.

It is bleach. It is strong. Why can I smell, but not see? Not hear? Not feel? And why bleach?

Where was I when I fell into the darkness? I am struggling to remember and it was not long ago.

I was somewhere, thinking about Sharon.

Does Sharon think about me?

I will ask her. Once I find my way out of the darkness.

The smell of bleach is beginning to fade. And I am saddened by this somehow. It is unpleasant, but it is a sense. My last sense. And it is going away. What happens when it is gone? Then I will have nothing. Nothing but my thoughts. Might they go away, too?

I must escape this darkness. I have work tomorrow. Sharon will be there. In her pencil skirts. With her perfume. 

I will tell Melanie. I will tell her about Sharon.

She will understand. 

I suspect she may already guess.

Yes. 

I must find myself.

In this darkness.

I have work tomorrow.",2016-10-09 03:41:25+00:00,d8k2abc,1.0,t3_56kepj,3213.0,WritingPrompts

68,"Clay was alone. Finally. How long had it been since he'd last had the house to himself? Weeks? *Months*? Callie was back from college and equal parts jobless and hopeless. She spent most days sprawled out on the couch in the living room, hugging a MacBook to her chest and sighing loudly. Dad didn't have any friends. Mom didn't have any interests. 

Thankfully someone died. Well, it wasn't great that the person had died, that was probably sad, but Clay couldn't remember her. It was some old lady from back when they went to church. Used to babysit Callie back when the world was all ice and cavemen or something. Clay begged off, claiming a math test. And that had worked. Somehow, someway, that had worked.

He was scrolling languidly through PornHub, looking for *just* the right smutty experience, when someone starting pounding on the door. Clay zipped up, swore, and slammed his laptop shut.

""Yuh?"" said Clay, as he cracked the door open. The man on the other side was young...hardly much older than Clay, but he wore a bone weariness you didn't often see from teenagers.  

""They're gone?""

Clay stealthily slid his foot against the door. ""And who are you?""

""Are you alone?"" said the man, trying to sneak a peek into the house past Clay. 

""No, no, it's a full house here,"" said Clay. ""So who are you?""

""You're lying,"" said the man. ""They went to the funeral, right?""

Clay scowled and tried to quietly slam the door shut, except the man already had his own foot jammed in the opening. ""Clay, don't freak out. I need to talk to you. Getting this opportunity took a lot of work."" 

A system of tiny gears clicked in Clay's head. ""*Opportunity*? Are you saying...?""

""Mrs. Rosemont was already dying,"" said the man. ""Don't worry about that. I'm worried about you. You *need* to hear what I have to say.""

""No thanks,"" said Clay. ""You need to get the hell out of here before I call the cops.""

The man shook his head. ""Alright. Fine. I was hoping we wouldn't have to do things this way."" Suddenly the muzzle of a handgun was leering at Clay through the crack in the door. ""Can you step back from the door now, please?""

Clay did as he was told, backing away on unsteady legs. The man stepped through, closing the door and gesturing towards the couch. ""You may want to sit down.""

""Okay,"" said Clay, lowering himself slowly onto the couch. ""But how about you put away the gun first?""

The man seemed to consider this for a moment. ""No,"" he said finally. ""I'm starting to think it'll be faster this way."" Then he pulled the trigger and shot Clay in the head.

Clay screamed. And screamed. And kept on screaming. And only after 60 seconds of screaming did he finally realize he was still alive. He touched his forehead. There was nothing. 

""There,"" said the man, pointing towards the floor in front of the couch. Clay looked down and saw a crumpled bullet underneath the coffee table.

""What the *fuck* kind of psycho trick was that?"" hissed Clay. ""You scared the shit out of me.""

""You think that was a trick?"" said the man. He aimed at the coffee table and pulled the trigger, blowing a hole through the center of the wooden top. ""Not a trick. Want to see it again?""

""Wh...what?"" said Clay, looking rapidly from the ruined coffee table to the man's gun.

""We *really* don't have time,"" said the man before firing another round directly at Clay's face. The boy screamed again and this time, under the burst of terror, he felt something...something like a mosquito brush against his skin.

""They aren't your parents,"" said the man. ""Not your sister. Not your family. You're not one of them.""

Clay was rubbing his forehead, only vaguely aware of what was being said. ""I'm not?""

The man rolled his eyes. ""How many times do I have to shoot you in the fucking head? No, you're *not* like them. You're something entirely different. They told you you have diabetes, right?""

""Told me? I *have* diabetes, yes,"" said Clay. ""Since I was a kid. For as long...as long as I can remember. Why...what about my diabetes?""

""You're not diabetic and those shots you've been taking all these years aren't insulin. They're inhibitor shots. Mild doses of radiation. They keep your powers in check.""

Clay picked up the second crumpled bullet. ""*Powers*? So I...no. No, wait. That doesn't make any sense. I *got* my shot this morning. If those are shots are inhibit-whatevers, than how come...you know...?"" He held up the bullet.

The man smirked. ""Surviving a gunshot to the head is the least of your powers, buddy. The things you can actually do...you're going to change the world.""

""Me? Just...just by *not* taking my insulin I'm going to be...?"" Clay shook his head. ""But why? If this is true....if any of this is true and I can do...whatever it is I can do...why would anyone lie about that? Why would they hide that from me?""

""Because,"" said the man, ""some people are afraid to let the gods come down from heaven and walk among us. They're afraid you might not like what they're doing...and end up doing something about it yourself."" The man stowed his gun and held out a hand. Clay took it and pulled himself off the couch. Maybe it was mental, just a figment of his imagination, but he already *felt* stronger. ""And Clay?"" The man smiled. ""We *don't* like what they've been doing. We don't like it at all. So now we're going to do something about it.""

And Clay smiled back. He felt something like the crackle of electricity tingling through his fingers. ""Good,"" he said. ""Lead the way.""",2016-10-08 03:23:45+00:00,d8it790,1.0,t3_56ehwv,11506.0,WritingPrompts

Mina shook her head. She'd been in gym glass just 45 minutes earlier. She was still wearing shorts and a sweaty t-shirt. ""This is a joke, right? *Brother*? Did Dad put you up to...did he...*what*?"" She laughed. It was so exasperatingly *odd* she couldn't help herself. ""Seriously. What's going on?""

Deckard sighed and opened up the intercom on his desk. ""Send them in.""

The door to the office swung open. Debbie and George McHale shuffled into the room, looking sheepish and sad.

""Mom! Dad!"" said Mina, pivoting off the wooden chair and grabbing both in a deep hug. ""What's going on?""

Debbie McHale had clearly been crying. Mina's stomach suddenly filled with a mixture of acid and ice. ""You were always our little girl,"" said Debbie, griping Mina tightly around the shoulders. ""We love you. We love you. We love you. Okay?""

Mina tried to pull herself free. ""Mom? You're making it worse. What's going on?""

George McHale made eye contact with Deckard, who nodded. ""Honey, what Mr. Deckard has told you...it's all true. You...aren't from here.""

""Oh...okay,"" said Mina, trying desperately to grab back on to something solid. ""We're from another country. Okay. Cool. I don't know why you didn't ever...""

""No,"" said George. ""Only you, Mina. You and your brother.""

Mina pushed away from Debbie with force. ""*Brother*? He said that, too. What does that mean? Am I...?""

""I told you,"" said Deckard, leaning heavily against the desk. ""We pulled you out as your kingdom was falling apart. You'd be dead if we hadn't. And yes, that means George and Debbie aren't your birth parents. They adopted you. We sent your brother elsewhere for safety sake.""

""I...have a brother?"" said Mina, willing herself to keep composure.

""Yes. The crown prince. And you're the princess."" Deckard rubbed his temples. He looked like he hadn't slept in years. ""Don't worry about the prince. I'm hoping we don't need to play that hand. And besides, he's younger. I'm not positive you can handle all this, but I'm almost certain he can't.""

""Handle...?"" Mina felt woozy. She wanted to go home and go to bed, but then she wondered if she even *had* a home and a bed or any sort of place to be.

""Things are going poorly back in the mother country,"" said Deckard. ""We've been watching for a while, hoping things would straighten out on their own, but that's not happening. So we're going back in. We're sending *you* back in. To reclaim your throne. It's earlier than we wanted, but it's time. You're going home.""

He said it like some grand pronouncement. Mina felt like she ought to feel something other than the fear and deep sorrow she was feeling, but those hollow feelings were all she could muster.

""Where?"" she said finally. Her mouth was so dry. ""Where am I going? Where's home?""

Deckard nodded. ""It's here, Princess. It's America. But not *this* America. A parallel America. One of many. We've managed to open doorways to seven of them - seven alternate worlds - but there are many, many more.

Maggie tried to pull away. ""What? Eww. Get real, Tim. Why the hell would we want to go that way?""

The darkness was quiet. Gabriel could hear alleycats fucking in the near distance. ""I'd just like it if we'd maybe try hanging out at *other* times, too,"" said the darkness. ""That might make me feel a little less like...you know...something you need to be drunk to appreciate.""

Gabriel scrunched up his face. He was vaguely aware that he may have stepped in something. ""*Other times*? Like what? The *daytime*?""

""I'm not saying we have to plan anything right now,"" said the darkness. 

""Yeah,"" said Gabriel. He smacked his lips. The subway station materialized like an oasis just ahead. ""Alright. Sure. That's what we'll do.""

""Really?"" said the darkness. ""You're not just humoring me?""

""Never,"" said Gabriel, skipping in a wobbly line towards salvation. ""I'll call you, yeah?""

""I'd like that,"" said the darkness.

""Alright,"" said Gabriel, diving for the steps. ""You take care, alright?""

""You too,"" said the darkness with a very concerning sort of brightness in its voice. ""Talk to you soon!""

But Gabriel barely heard that last line as he nearly fell on his face racing down the stairs. Through the turnstile, Gabriel stood on the platform, unsteady and nauseous. He looked up and realized he'd picked the wrong train.

""No more drinkin' fer me,"" he muttered as the station filled with the screech of braking cars. ",2016-10-06 14:12:32+00:00,d8gfsj4,1.0,t3_564tbk,11660.0,WritingPrompts
74,"I followed an old man for three days. Three days walking, slowly, just behind him. Waiting. And all throughout those days I watched the great, heavy thing wobble and strain against the ropes he'd set to hold it in place. It rode on the nape of his neck, a strange mechanical passenger. I knew the old man would eventually falter, or the ropes would snap, or the thing itself would simply find a way to shimmy free and jump down to the ground.

So I followed the man for three days through quiet towns and still forests. He knew I was there. And no, I did not know where he was going. It didn't seem to matter.

And finally, scaling the side of a dry, crumbling hill, he slipped and fell. His dozen crosswise ropes shifted and twisted like sleepy snakes. The grand pack held. His bandolier held. But that wondrous box came free and tumbled down the hill. I lunged to grab it.

It was heavier even than I had guessed.

The old man looked at me ruefully, as he struggled to right himself and wiped the dirt from his hands. ""I don't suppose you've any paper for the thing,"" he said.

I smiled and opened the saddle bag strung with twine across my left hip. ""Fifty white sheets,"" I said, pulling up just enough of the paper to make my point. 

The old man sniffed. ""It's a burden. In more ways than one. I'm glad to be free of it."" I don't suspect that was the truth, but still the old man tightened his straps and continued up the hill, never once looking back.

And that is how I came to receive the typewriter I am using to record this manuscript.

It is still surprising to me how few people see the value in writing these days. ""Non-essential,"" some call it, citing the overbearing weight of the pages. That is a funny thing, if you think about it. A single page is hardly noticeable. A whole book is entirely tolerable. But many books...enough books to offer a genuine, factual record of humanity's plight...that it far too many books for any one person to carry. 

So people have left books behind. They cannot carry them. They cannot protect them. That should not have been an issue. In fact, from far away that appears a positive. No ownership. No barriers. A common library of the world. A time of unbridled access and excess.

But as always, the view from afar is skewed at best.

People burned the old books. The reasons were legion, but it all boiled down to this: we live in an age where people no longer need to tolerate the things they do not rate. The law offered no protection. And rather than usher in a utopian age of communal living, the opposite occurred. We destroyed and destroyed and destroyed.

Oh well.

Every man to himself.

The trouble now, as I see it, is that the stories we tell are all wrong. Or more, perhaps it's that the *people* telling these stories are all wrong and there is nothing there to contradict them. The truth is more malleable than wet clay.

So that must be my role now. To record. To take the truth and make it steel. Because man cannot thrive on a foundation of clay. We need solid ground on which to stand. 

The typewriter is indeed quite heavy. I must leave behind my shovel and spare shoes, and even that is not enough to countermand the new weight. But that is fine. It is my new burden and I take it on gladly. 

Tomorrow I return to civilization to begin my interviews, but for now I must rest. Like the old man, I will sleep with the typewriter nestled in my arms. We are joined now. A team. I hope we shall not be parted until I am too old to manage the weight, but by then perhaps both of us will no longer be necessary. 

It is a nice thing to dream about. ",2016-10-05 14:18:19+00:00,d8f0jhn,1.0,t3_55yxid,11405.0,WritingPrompts

78,"Why did you leave the cat? The stack of LPs you took, but the cat you left? You don’t even have a record player. And meanwhile, Daisy and I spend our days staring at each other. She’s telling me as plainly as she can manage, “You drove her away.” The cat blames me. And I told her – actually told her – “She left you behind. She didn’t want you. So don’t look at me like that.” I told the cat that. And she just kept on looking at me.

You left a sweater in the back of the closet. I don’t go in there, but Daisy does and she found it. She clawed it and tore it and rolled around in it, and eventually, she fell asleep in it. The first time I saw it she was wrapped so tight in the folds of the thing, I thought for a second the sweater was breathing. Lying there and breathing in your old closet. But it was the cat. She did that for a week. Then she figured it out. I don’t know what tipped it for her, but she put it together. I threw the sweater out. 

Daisy’s like me in this: she didn’t stop doing what she does because you left. You remember Karen? I didn’t talk about Karen much because you didn’t want me to talk about Karen, but Karen was before you and she broke my heart. Really broke it. I didn’t want to die when she left; I wanted to never have been born in the first place. But that’s good, in a way. I got over it. And then you left and it hurt, but nothing will ever hurt like that time with Karen. That’s my way of saying, I guess, you aren’t that important. I’m not trying to be malicious or anything. It’s just the truth. And Daisy’s the same way. She’s pissed you’re gone, but she didn’t stop eating or anything. She didn’t stop chasing spiders and the reflection off my wristwatch. She stills naps in the window. She just looks more pissed off when she wakes up. I don’t think cats have much room in their lives for love, but I think with Daisy maybe she tried for you. And you left, so now she knows better.

And don’t think that just because I’m seeing the cat’s point of view, that I like the cat or that I’m glad you left the cat. *You two need each other. You can take care of each other.* Fuck you for writing that. Leave if you want. Steal my shit if you need to. But don’t pretend that you’re doing anyone a favor. Even the cat knows you’re full of bullshit. 

But I’ll tell you this: I had a dream the other night. I don’t remember it very much, but it’s one of those edited dreams, where you’re seeing things you’ve done and places you’ve been, but it’s not a real memory. Like a messed up collage of old faces and places. But anyway, it was you and me and we were in Napa. I didn’t have much fun on that trip, but seeing it in my dream it was beautiful and exciting and just a big fucking blue sky parade for me and you. And I was seeing you like I never saw you in real life – just *otherworldly*. It was making my chest hurt and my heart race and I was twisting around in the bed and probably saying things, who knows. It was beautiful and it was terrifying. I wanted out of that dream so badly and I couldn’t wake up. I couldn’t get out. 

Then the fucking cat bit my hand and I woke up. I look around and I’m all tangled in the sheets and it’s 3 in the morning and Daisy’s on the bed, staring at me. And then she meows. Have you ever heard her meow? I’ve never heard her meow before and here I’m tumbling out of this nightmare and she’s sitting there, meowing at me. She meows and then she hops off the bed, disappears into the dark.

The stupid cat pulled me back. And not out of love. Nothing’s really changed. There’s no hidden affection there. I feed her and clean up her shit and the rest of the time we ignore each other. But Daisy pulled me away – away from that dream, that nightmare…away from you. 

So I think you might be right, in your usual twisted, self-serving way. I do need Daisy. Just not the way you think. I need her for those moments when I’m weak and I think I somehow deserved it. I need her when all the other goods things run out and I go tearing through that old shoebox, looking for your letters and hoping your phone number’s on there somewhere. 

I need her to remind me that even an asshole of a cat thinks I’m worth saving. We may not like each other, but we respect each other. And that’s a hell of a lot more than either of us can say about you. ",2016-10-04 19:56:10+00:00,d8dzml2,1.0,t3_55ujau,10097.0,WritingPrompts
79,"Margot's anxiety has only deepened. She regards her food with immense distrust, cutting the smallest possible pieces and chewing each minuscule bite one hundred times. ""I will not choke,"" she mutters, glaring furiously at whatever piece of fruit or slab of meat has the poor fortune to be plated before her. ""I will *not*.""

She takes her baths in an ankle's length of water and will not suffer to have her head submerged. She will not stand within a hundred yard of any lakes or rivers or especially menacing puddles and has asked me repeatedly to cover over the well with wood and tar. ""I will not drown,"" she mutters as she dabs herself cautiously with a partially moistened cloth. ""I will *not.*""

She has given up sewing. Her loom lays in pieces in the drawing room. She will not venture anywhere her own two feet cannot carry her, having long since sworn off carriages and horses.

She patters about the house in a quiet fog. ""I will not fall and break my neck. I will not catch a cold and die. I will not. I will not.""

Little Gwenny, for her part, seems largely immune to her mother's dark glowering. Every day, she rises to the twitter of bird song and the crackling chitter of the seven or eight squirrels that seem to live behind her dresser. I have offered repeatedly to summon an exterminator, but Gwen will hear none of it. 

""This one is Sven,"" she will say, as she sets about fashioning tiny frocks and caps for the rodents. ""He is brave and sophisticated. And this one is Tully. He is silly and kind.""

""Certainly,"" I will say, gently humoring the child. ""Silly and kind and, one hopes, not especially diseased.""

As a cobbler, I am blessed to be able to work largely from the comfort of my home, in the little workshop I've built for myself. Lately, however, this has been more of a chore than a blessing, as I am finding myself persistently interrupted throughout the day.

The bell will ring and I will dash to the door, expecting a client, only to find yet *another* prince, jingling with gold and silver, smiling unnaturally.

""I thank you for your interest,"" I say - for this, you see, is a well-practiced speech - ""I thank you for your interest. My family is humbled, I assure you. And while someday we can only hope to be blessed by a match so wondrous as yourself, Gwen is presently nine years old and not really looking for a serious relationship. Thank you all the same.""

It is good, I suppose, to know that we should not worry about dear Gwenny's future, presuming, of course, that she is not struck down by rabies prior to her flowering. I tell Margot this often, in hopes that it might assuage her anxious mind. 

""The apple of a thousand princes' eye,"" I say. ""Fairest in all the land, I think you could argue. Humble, wise, and good with animals. A voice like an angel. Yes, I do admit that she has an alarming number of enemies among the witch population, but they're an ill-tempered peoples. And it's certainly not a reflection on our skill as parents. Yes, I think we've done quite well, my dear.""

And at this Margot will cringe in a most unpleasant manner, before returning to her dark mutterings. 

No matter. I've come upon a solution. Margot will face her fears, all at once. Only then will the spell be broken. It may seem cruel at first, but I truly believe it is in all our best interests. The ship leaves tomorrow. Out upon the ocean's endless horizon, Margot will come face-to-face with her greatest fears and I know in my heart that she will prevail. And when we return to port, she will be the old Margot again. The spark that once set my heart aflame.

Gwen will be content in our absence. My sister will watch her. She's a stern hand, admittedly, but it will only be for a few weeks. A few weeks and Gwen will have her mother back and I will have my wife back.

82,"I met him by accident in an airport coffee shop. He wore dark sunglasses and a old baseball cap, but still I recognized him immediately. There had been a time, not so long ago, when you couldn't escape his round, cherub face. But that was past, I realized. When had I last heard about him? When had we last spoken about him? To have been so oppressively *present* and then to disappear so completely...It took real effort to escape a gravitational pull that strong. ""That's a man who wants to be forgotten,"" I thought to myself.

But still, I should say that I did not seek him out. He spilled his coffee on me. I was waiting for a flight to Ireland. I had hours yet to go and in the crush of the crowded little cafe, he'd tried to squeeze past and spilled his coffee down my shoulder. I was lucky to be wearing a jacket. He apologized and offered money and grabbed napkins and hemmed and hawed, but I waved it all off and bid him to sit down.

""Stanley Wiese,"" I said, not so loud, but not in a whisper. ""The Man With the Bionic Brain.""

Wiese blushed and took the chair opposite me. ""It's not half as interesting as everyone made it out to be. Just a transplant. A simple swap."" 

I brushed at the warm stain on my shoulder. There was a strange tinny buzz in my ears, like a tiny mosquito burrowing through the lobes. ""Not *so* simple,"" I replied. ""A brain is not quite the same as a kidney or even a face.""

Wiese shook his head. Just then I noticed the man's thinness - the dry, papery quality of his skin. He seemed unwell. ""Well, no. The *procedure* was no simple thing. It was the combined effort of many, many great men and women. I played but a small part.""

""The part of the guinea pig,"" I said, swatting casually at my ear. Some sort of electrical interference. It rose and fell away in time with my breathing. It was irritating. 

""Someone must always go first,"" said Wiese.  

""And last,"" I said. ""Do you know why they've never done it again? By all accounts, your case was a rousing success.""

Wiese blinked. ""Never again? I didn't know. Well, however it is, I'm a very lucky man.""

""Even after your wife...?""

Wiese cleared his throat. ""Well that...that was difficult. Bionic brain or not, I've still got my original heart. And that hurt, certainly. Not that I blame her. *I* know I'm the same as I've ever been, but it's reasonable to have doubts. It's not like she had anyone with similar experiences to lean on. I'm sure it was a very lonely feeling.""

""Were you angry with her?"" I asked, knowing vaguely how rude I was likely being, but too thrilled by the unexpected opportunity to question one of the most important men of the half century. A living science experiment. 

Wiese shook his head. ""Heartbreak, but no ill feelings. I wished she could feel differently about things, but that was out of my control. I felt the same. I acted the same. But for her it was not the same. So it goes.""

I took a slow, cautious sip of my coffee. ""Do you ever worry about it turning off?""

""Hahaha!"" Wiese's laugh was high and piercing. Instinctively, I put my hands to ears. The buzzing was momentarily overwhelming. Wiese yanked the ballcap further down on his head as other eyes turned our way. ""That's where I already *was*,"" he said. ""Bit by bit, I could feel the dimmer fade, until all the light was nearly gone. It will turn off eventually. For all of us. We all must power down at some point.""

I nodded. ""Borrowed time?""

Wiese frowned. ""No. It's still my time. Who would I owe? I am grateful, however. But I accept that someday I will pass on.""

""But why?"" I said. ""Why should you ever pass on?"" I pointed at the space just above the brim of his cap. ""Isn't *this* built to last? The rest of it may rot, but if you've got that...aren't you beyond death now?""

He chuckled. ""I certainly hope not. A brain in a jar? What life is that?""

I shrugged. ""I don't know. But your brain isn't like my brain.""

He laughed again, deeper. ""Ah. I see. Life beyond the physical. A pattern in a machine? I don't think I'd like life as a computer program. I prefer having hands and feet and skin.""

""Even if they get old?"" I asked. ""Even if they wither and rot away? Can you be content with that, knowing that you're made of interchangeable component parts? *Why* would you ride it out in a broken down old junker? Where's the sense in that?""

And then a woman at the next table spun around. Her eyes were blue and black and her lips were smudged in orange. ""I suppose you're right,"" she said, smiling broadly. ""What's the sense in limiting yourself?""

The electricity in my ears hissed and popped like oil in a frying pan.  

""But let's say that your brain is actually more similar to my brain than you'd ever realize,"" said another man - tall, lean, draped in a black bomber jacket and suddenly hovering over the back of my chair. ""If I had the keys - if I had *all* the keys - why would I content myself with just one vehicle?""

A voice crackled over the airport PA. ""Why not a fleet?""

Wiese pushed a pile of damp napkins to the center of the table and stood up. ""Things to ponder, my friend. Things to consider. And here is one more: when you speak of *borrowed time*, consider for a moment what might happen should a new lender come to town. From whom have you borrowed *your* time, dear Walter...and when might they come to collect?""

With that he walked away. And although he had gone from the cafe, I still felt him watching me, through how many sets of eyes, I could not say.

He knew my name, though I'd never said it. What else did he know? Where else was he? *Who* else was he?

I canceled my flight and went home. I watched my wife as she slept that night. I listened to my children breathing in their sleep. In the still of night, I heard the distant buzz of power lines and bit my fist to keep from screaming.",2016-10-04 03:07:46+00:00,d8d2hp3,1.0,t3_55r0ak,7779.0,WritingPrompts
83,"Good question. I don't know how any of this fictional math or science would work, but in my mind the ship is traveling too fast for a rescue. So (and again, I don't know anything about this fictional mode of space travel I've created) my thought is that traveling that fast and that far means you can't really slow down or change course without completely screwing yourself over. Therefore, a ship leaving Ganymede couldn't catch up to them and a ship leaving Janus would have a hell of a time plotting a course that successfully intercepted the *Eurydice* unless that ship stopped. And even then, what would the next step be? It's the biggest ship of its kind, so it would take a massive effort to evacuate and/or re-stock it with adequate supplies. Plus, it would take years for this rescue to ever arrive. So...logistics, I guess, is the answer.

84,"Isaac came aboard the *Eurydice* at Ganymede. He was part of the crew that installed the hyperbaric chambers in the Turner-Al Saad Executive Spa. At the end of the shift, he'd excused himself to the lavatory and then just never left. 

He had to see it. He had to be a part of history in the making.

Dak had helped. He'd hacked the in-house debit portfolio and created a dummy account for Isaac. All of Isaac's payment scans would ping the dummy account and come back showing sufficient credit. There'd be a whopper of an unpaid balance by the end of the trip, but that was for the shipline's accountants to worry about. Given how much they stood to make on the voyage, a write-off that size was meaningless.

Isaac still would have preferred to book a legitimate berth on the ship, but that was out of the question. Ticketing was through a high-end Martian brokerage with alpha class system security. Well beyond Dak's abilities. So Isaac would have to make due, casually napping in hidden corners and common areas. That was fine, as far as he was concerned. He didn't intend to sleep much anyway.

The maiden voyage of the *Eurydice* would last just under ten Earth Years, arriving to port at Janus in Alpha Centauri, exchanging passengers, and then setting off back to Ganymede for another decade's travel at particle warp. The fastest passenger flight of all time. *Faster than angels*, the advertisements had said. ""Faster than demons, too,"" Isaac thought to himself. 

And that was the thing of it. Isaac had no interest in Janus. And while he had every intention of sampling all the various luxuries the *Eurydice* had to offer, that wasn't what drew him to stow away aboard arguably the most luxuriant ship ever built. 

It was the hubris. The defiance. The wondrous arrogance of it all. The *Eurydice* was simply the next evolution of mankind's innate sense of entitlement - the desire to control *all*, to conquer *all*, to have *all*. To Isaac, it was a historic moment in more ways than most could recognize. 

So Isaac bought a tailored suit in a small boutique on the 215th floor and paid premium credits for a spot by the railing, under the crystal clear Lucite shielding, to watch the great ship - the *greatest* ever ship - slide slowly away from her housing in the orbiting dock. He saw the twinkling lights of Ganymede below and the twinkling pulse of the stars above and smiled. 

Seven days later, the *Eurydice* boosted into particle warp.

Isaac passed much of those early days up on the deck, watching the distorted milky silver streaks of distant stars slip past. He read borrowed books - real paper books - in the central library and watched old movies in the antique film theater on the 20th floor. He played games of Go with an elderly man he'd met in the terrarium. He visited the sprawling brothels that dotted the aft-end of the ship and paid extra for the privilege of sleeping a few hours in a real bed.

Months passed as the *Eurydice* cut through space - enormous and weightless. A rogue planet moving faster than the space around her could properly account for, splitting the nothingness and finding the deeper nothing within.

Malaise set in. Not for Isaac, but for the larger population of the ship. No luxury, no matter how fantastic, is impervious to the degradations of monotony. 

The fantasy began to curl at the edges. The real text below became visible. *Life* took over.

But not for long.

Isaac was in a salon getting a haircut when the explosion happened. It cracked like thunder, which was a sound Isaac hardly believed he remembered. There were screams and confusion. A warning siren. Then a soft voice ringing through the PA.

*Do not panic. Please remain where you are. There has been a small collision. There is damage to floors 85 through 142 on the starboard side. Emergency response crews are engaged. Do not panic. Remain where you are. Do not panic.*

Some listened. Many did not. In the end, the damage was more substantial than the crew were willing to let on. At least 3,000 people were either blown to pieces or sucked into space. Three sizable farms and one of the larger animal pens were destroyed. The *Eurydice* was not crippled, but the faith of the passengers was shaken, and shaken badly.

They would not turn back. In truth, they *couldn't* turn back. They were plotted for Janus. There wasn't fuel enough to slow down, turn around, and boost back into particle warp in the opposite direction. But the passengers did not know this. They only knew that they were not invulnerable; that they were hurtling at mercilessly dangerous speeds through an ocean of darkness they now saw as hostile.

Metal workers on the 225th floor began making guns. Isaac bought one. 

The grocery stores on the lower floors began to have shortages. The cheap restaurants stopped being cheap and the expensive restaurants got more expensive.

*A temporary situation* ship administrators said. A symptom of the losses suffered in the collision. Things would get back to normal in a few seasons. 

But the people on the lower floors became hungry, and they went into debt buying food. The in-house debit portfolio had mandatory cut-offs once your debt levels got too high. Travelers were cut off from making additional purchases. No food. No power. No anything.

The admins on the *Eurydice* hadn't planned for paupers. There was no welfare. There were no social workers. Many starved. Admins could be heard casually suggesting suicide. 

Things got worse.

Isaac tried to help at first. He used his dummy account to buy food for poor strangers. But then a man tried to cut the scanning strip out of Isaac's wrist. And another did the same. And that second time Isaac had to shoot the man. 

So Isaac was a murderer. And the ship was full of dying, desperate people.

And then one day they blocked off the 100 level. All 100 floors, quarantined from the rest of the ship. 

Isaac bought a knife and more bullets. He spent most of his nights in the brothels, paying absurd amounts to sleep alone with the door locked.

There were explosions in the 100s. A series of them. Isaac could hear them all the way up in the 400s. 

*Do not panic* said the voice on the PA. *Do not panic.*

""They'll blow straight through the hull!"" screamed the men and women of the top floors. ""You have to *stop* them.""

They sent warnings down to those lower floors. Warnings and threats. But no one went down there. And there was no way to know if anyone ever heard those threats. 

The explosions continued. 

Finally, the Captain ordered the life support cut for all 100 floors. 

The explosions stopped.

And the middle class became the lower class. Food did not appear by magic. Money did not appear by magic. Isaac shot another man. Later he shot five women while escaping from the brothels. 

There were whispers of another rebellion. A construction company on the 240th floor was found in possession of materials used for making bombs. 

They closed off the 200s as a precaution. Life support and everything. 

Isaac ate dry handfuls of cut oats and packs of freeze-dried fruit as he sat under the Lucite shielding and watched the universe slip by. He shot anyone who got too close.

More explosions. More explosions. Shops raided. Shops raided. 

Every now and then the crew would manage to grab a brief moment of order and the explosions would stop and everyone would look around and wonder what they had become and where they were headed. They turned the life support back on for the lower levels. They had to. They needed the farm land. 

The wealthy were the poor, and everyone else was dead.

They rebuilt the farms. There was no livestock. That was over. But they tilled the soil and brought it back to life. 

And sometimes they forgot that it was working and they killed each other again. But then they remembered.

And always the *Eurydice* slipped through the blackest space, heading towards a planet they'd nearly forgotten about. 

Isaac lived. He tilled. He foraged. He hid. He killed. But he lived. 

The Captain and the Helmsman were long dead by the time they reached Janus. Thankfully, the ship remembered what to do. They found a berth and finally - finally, finally, finally - the *Eurydice* came to a stop.

86,"The ship was made of some sort of vapor. It hung over the northern hemisphere like a cloud of pale green gas. We watched and we waited. Our probes passed right through the cloud. Whatever was in there was like nothing we'd ever seen before.

Everything stopped. We couldn't pretend it wasn't happening. We couldn't go to work. We couldn't sit around, watching TV. Whatever it was, it was too much to ignore. 

When they came, they came to all of us, simultaneously. I was in the woods, walking Marlow. Two shapes appeared; one the approximate size and shape of a man, the other the size and shape of a dog. They were cloud figures, pale green like the ship in orbit. Wisps of collected particles. Living smoke, you might call it.

The larger one stood before me, the smaller before Marlow. In the buzzy crackle of the forest, I looked up and saw still more figures flitting through the air - insect figures, bird figures. 

They came to *all* of us.

""Where are the guardians?"" spoke a voice directly into my ear. Or perhaps, directly into my mind. 

""I don't know who that is,"" I said. Marlow barked and whined beside me.

""We left them here,"" said the voice. ""They were our shepherds. They swore to watch this land until we returned. Where are the guardians?""

""Were they men?"" I asked. 

""Are you?""

""A man? Yes. I am.""

The figure flashed, a cold blue like distant lightning. ""Then no. They were not men. Where did you come from?""

""A single cell,"" I replied, unsure of a better answer. ""We evolved upwards, over thousand and thousands of years. Adapting. Changing.""

""Conquering?"" The figure pointed down at Marlow. ""This one names you master. All over they name your kind *Master*. *King*. *Conqueror*. *Tormentor*. Even the trees speak ill of your kind. But none remember the guardians."" The figure gestured towards the sky. ""There are whispers of their legacy in these winged creatures. But otherwise...nothing. So I ask again, *conqueror*...where are the guardians?""

Marlow growled. I shushed him, entirely out of habit. 

""Dinosaurs?"" I said. ""Is that what you mean?""

The figure paused, turning briefly opaque. It looked in that moment like a statue - ancient, stone, and worn with age. Featureless. 

""Yes,"" it said finally. ""They were the guardians."" 

""They're gone,"" I said. ""Gone long before us. We only know their bones.""

The figure flashed once more, than began to dissolve into formless ether. ""So, we lingered too long it seems. And now we have no world to reclaim. That was always the risk..."" 

Like a puff of steam, the figure dissipated into the air. All the figures. Everywhere.

My experience was not extraordinary. We had all been visited. We had all had much the same conversation. Many had thought to ask questions and some had even been given answers. The one question, however, that was asked often but never answered, was this: ""Where did you go?""

Maybe we could never understand the answer, but I think the truth is something far simpler: that wherever they had gone and whatever they had sought, it had been no fair trade for the things they had left behind. They had gambled. They had lost. And that is a humbling sort of failure, no matter how highly you've ascended.

At least that's my interpretation. And while the world now stands in a frenzy, preparing for an invasion we've no proof will ever come and building weapons that are much more likely to tear us apart as damage a combatant made of smoke, I can't help but think what an enemy we've made of the world. What tyrant kings we have become. And I wonder what the trees said, and what the insects and the snakes and the worms and the coral *said*. I wonder what that moment of connection meant to them.

As we prepare to wage war with ghosts and gods, what do the trees think? And should war come, will we really be so foolish as to expect this world to be on our side?   ",2016-10-02 19:29:27+00:00,d8b4yv3,1.0,t3_55iw3d,11485.0,WritingPrompts
87,"It comes from having an older brother.

Brotherhood is a lawless fraternity, but even still my brother George was a rogue without peer. While there were many pleasures to be found in broad daylight - swirlies, wet Willies, and atomic crotch rockets, to name a few - there was little George enjoyed more than making the darkness an accessory to his crimes. He would lurk in darkened bathrooms, hallways, closets, and whatever else space he could claim, and then simply *wait* for his prey to arrive. George had plenty of time. My torment was his one and only hobby and obligation.

There wasn't much in the way of creativity in George's approach - a sudden scream here, a blind grab there - but I suppose the results bore themselves out. By my best count, George has made me piss myself on 13 separate occasions, and shit myself twice - once, funnily enough, about ten minutes prior to my wedding.

So George is the cause of it. George is the reason why I send meaningless warnings down blind alleyways. George is the reason why I say things like, ""Give it up already"" when I clomp off to the bathroom in the middle of the night. George is the reason I've managed to convince little Danny that our house is haunted. On the plus side, however, he seems to think I have a very off-the-cuff relationship with our ghosts, which are some of the very few points I have in my favor these days.

George is also the reason I'm alive.

I work at Trans National Bank, you see. I'm very proud to say I'm the youngest Branch Manager in a quarter century. And while that doesn't necessarily make me a rich man, it does make me an important man. Or, more accurately, an important *seeming* man. And that can have it's drawbacks.

I happened to be dawdling one Tuesday and ended up still in my office as the bank was nearing close. I sent Reggie home early and closed up in his stead. A half hour later, I emerged, making quick headway towards my car on the third floor of the garage. And while the parking spaces in the garage are well lit, the stairs and tunnels leading in and out are not. Perhaps they once were, but these days, once the sun has gone down, those areas are as black as a grave. 

So I did what I always do in these situations. I opened the door to the stairwell and said, quite firmly, ""I'm not falling for it. I know you're in there. Step out where I can see you.""

And, to my surprise, a gentleman did just that.

He wore a long black coat and sheepish smirk. He put his hands up. ""Right, right. You got me."" His eyes ran me up and down. ""You got training or something? File didn't say nuthin' about that.""

""Loads of training,"" I said, waving my briefcase in his general direction. I was still trying to wrap my mind around this peculiar turn of events. ""More than you, I'd wager. Skulking around in the dark like that. That's the *first* thing I check for.""

He nodded, still sizing me up. He didn't seem sure whether or not he needed to keep his hands in the air, so I waved my briefcase about some more. That kept his hands good and up.

""I suppose you want to know who I'm working for,"" he said.

""And what makes you think I don't already know?"" I said. Obviously I did not know. But this seemed like the more impressive response.

""He won't be happy,"" said the man.

""Well, *I'm* late for dinner. So *he* can queue up behind my wife.""

The man grimaced. ""He'll kill me for this. You know how he's like.""

I grimaced as well, though I suspect for different reasons. ""That's, well, that's what comes of mucking about in dark stairwells, isn't it? Picked the wrong bloke for that old ploy, eh?""

The man's shoulders slumped. ""That's fair, I guess. I underestimated you, and this is what I get. I just...if I have to go out, mate, I'd much rather go out on a job, you know?""

I nodded. ""I've daydreamed a time or two about passing peacefully in my office. I certainly see the appeal.""

He perked up a bit. ""So...you'll do it?""

I took a quick step backwards in time and replayed the gentleman's earlier comments. Suddenly his meaning was a bit more clear. ""Oooooh. That's...no. That's really not a skill I'd like to add to my CV.""

""He'll kill me all the same.""

I frowned. ""And that...is really just a shameful way to conduct business, I think. Makes people afraid to make mistakes. When you're afraid to make mistakes, you play it safe, and then no one ever grows or takes chances. Business 101, really. You should tell him that. You made a mistake. You learned. You'll be better going forward, eh? Tell him he really needs to think long and hard about the sort of message he wants to be sending his employees. I should know. I'm the youngest Branch Manager in nearly a quarter of a century.""

The man blinked. ""Branch Manager?""

I nodded. ""Well, I'm not the youngest anymore. Promotion *was* a few years ago, but the thing of it is...""

""Aren't you Reginald Monroe?""

""Ehh? No. Not even a little. Reggie is the *Teller* Manager. He's below me. I'm his boss.""

The man's face split into a wide smile. ""Oh my heavens! All this time and I'd thought I'd mangled it all up. You're not Reggie Munroe?""

I shook my head. ""I'm really not.""

The man's sides shook with relieved laughter. ""Oh, what a *load.* That's a wonder. You're his manager?""

I nodded. 

""Is he closing tomorrow?""

""Yes,"" I said. 

""Great, great!"" He blew out a long, exaggerated sigh. ""No harm done. Alright. Tomorrow. Great. Thank you, sir. Have a great evening.""

""Well, you're welcome?"" I replied, slightly dumbfounded. 

And that, you see, is how my brother's years of torment ultimately, against all odds, saved my life.

If only Reggie had had an older brother like George. Such a tragedy...

89,"Connor placed the SD card on the table between us, his finger lingering, protective, pressing the plastic case into the worn Formica. 

""So."" He cleared his throat. ""If you want my honest opinion - don't watch it. There's nothing...there's nothing for you to learn. Just...don't.""

I swallowed. ""You're making me nervous, Con,"" I said. ""It's just dreams, right? What is it, like, super perverted or something? I'm not embarrassed. It's fine. The brain does what it does.""

The finger tapped on the case. ""It's not quite that.""

""So...?""

He flicked the card across the table. I could see his hands shaking, ever so slightly. ""Okay, now you need to tell me,"" I said. ""You're freaking me the hell out.""

His eyes went to the table. He shrugged. ""It's new stuff, Win. Work in progress, right? But there, um...there are *patterns* that are starting to emerge. Looking at multiple histories. Thousands of histories. Compositing data from across the world. Things are starting to become clear.""

I shook my head and laughed, weakly. ""Can you be little *more* vague, please? Thank you.""

""There are *similarities*,"" said Connor. ""I've seen pulls from about a hundred other histories and a lot of people see the same things.""

""That makes sense,"" I said, still waiting for the bomb to drop and hoping that maybe, just maybe Connor was more of an alarmist than I'd ever noticed.

He ran his fingers through his hair. The right words were clearly eluding him. ""In dreams, bad things can happen.""

""Right.""

He shook his head. ""Bad things can happen *to* you, or you can *cause* bad things to happen. When *you* dream, you are the latter.""

I nodded. ""Okay. That's fine. So I'm a mean dreamer, is that it? Is that psychologically concerning or something? I'm sure lots of people do weird, aggressive things in their dreams.""

Connor grimaced. ""When I said there are patterns...what that means is that there's significant evidence now that our dreams are not sovereign. We dream *together*. Do you understand? When we dream, we all exist *together* in a common space. Your dreams aren't your own. And when you..."" 

He lost the words. I picked up the SD card. ""So you said I do bad things in my dreams. What...what does that mean?""

He still couldn't look me in the eyes. ""Win, you're a nightmare. You terrorize people across their dreams. You've...""

I clutched the card tightly in my hand. A pair of thin tears died at the corners of my eyes. ""I've what?""

""You've killed people,"" said Connor. He leaned forward, almost as if he was considering touching me, comforting me. ""Weak people,"" he said. ""Old people, mostly. Unwell people.""

""Killed? In...dreams?""

He shook his head. ""The research is obviously still ongoing, but the preliminary results seem to indicate that events in the dream theater play a significant role when it comes to those who have passed in their sleep.""

""Ah,"" I said. ""So...*real* people, then? I've killed actual, real people."" I shook the card. ""In here?""

Connor pushed back from the table. ""I don't know what kind of control we have there. Likely none at all. But you should be prepared.""

I swallowed again. It was getting harder to do, like my throat was filling up with sand. ""Prepared?"" My voice wavered an embarrassing amount.

""This is new,"" he said. ""I don't know how people will react. I don't know how any of this is going to go over. But as more and more people begin to pull their histories, there is an increasing chance that one or more of them...will come looking for you.""

I nodded, trying to laugh and failing abysmally. ""Of course. I'm the Boogeyman.""  

""It's not your fault,"" said Connor. He didn't believe a word of it. ""It's not your fault.""

I smiled and sighed. ""Well, I guess I just need to find them before they find me.""

Connor didn't laugh. He wasn't sure if it was a joke.

93,"For starters, I did not have access to an uncircumcised baby. Those are traditionally rather difficult to procure. I know a guy, but he's the sort of guy you'd really rather not owe a favor. Plus, if I'm being perfectly forthright here, I'm a touch uncomfortable around babies. 

In place of the uncircumcised baby, I sacrificed seven goldfish, two frozen HungryMan brand single-serve dinners, and an iPhone 5. There's no conversion chart for this sort of thing, but that *felt* like an adequate substitution. Again, minding the fact that I don't rate babies very highly.

Also, I'm a bit squeamish. So rather than smearing the altar in ""fresh arterial blood, given freely by the summoner"" I just used a bit of leftover bacon grease. In hindsight, I'm not entirely sure what my logic was there. Likely, that the jar was handy, I suppose. 

In full retrospect, as I type this out, it's beginning to become more and more apparent where my folly lay.

The chanting, at least, was as directed. I'm a very good chanter. My middle school choir director always made special request that I chant rather than sing my parts. My chanting diction is excellent. 

As I chanted, the offering upon the altar began to smoke. The windows rattled. The iPhone rang, then bubbled, which reminded me that I really ought to have copied my contacts before sacrificing my phone.

As the church filled with smoke and the smell of melting plastic and broiled goldfish, tendrils of white steam began to swirl, forming a cylinder above the altar. The cylinder widened, then solidified. Finally, the smoke dissipated. A crack formed down the face of the white column, racing north to south. The column split apart.

And there was my demon. My beautiful, winged demon.

She glanced about the church as I sized her up. Long, white, feathery wings. Gleaming white robes. A golden halo. Hair like woven silk. A lyre nestled in the crook of her arms. Single exposed breast casually swinging above the folds of her robe.

I'd clearly pulled a reject.

""Joseph Aaron Levine,"" she spoke. Her voice sent a trill down my back. ""You have summoned me.""

""Yes,"" I said, trying gallantly not to show my disappointment. The poor thing. What must her life have been like amongst the other demons? Such a delicate, disfigured thing. I promised I would do my best not judge or treat her unkindly. ""I would have you serve me here on Earth. There is great work to be done. I request your aid.""

Her face was calm and still, like porcelain. No slavering jowls or beady black eyes. Poor dear. ""Do you seek redemption for your Earthly sins?""

I bit back a sigh. It wasn't her fault. She was clearly a victim of her own poor genetics. 

""No, no my dear."" I spoke slowly, encouragingly. ""You will help me *crush* my *enemies*. Do you understand?""

Her face remained still as glass. ""The enemies within your soul?""

My hands clenched into fists. I took a deep breath. ""No, no. Your confusion is understandable. When I speak of enemies, I mean *actual* enemies. Specifically Kyle in Accounts Receivable and that lady at the DMV who rolled her eyes at me when I corrected her spelling. Real humans who need to be destroyed.""

The demon played a lazy note upon her lyre. ""You wish to bring peace into their hearts?""

My eye twitched. ""The peace of *death*, yes. Thank you.""

""Death is but a doorway that opens onto an eternity of salvation,"" said the demon. ""If they should die, they must rebuke their sinful past and open their hearts to forgiveness, as all who walk the Earth must do if they are to..."" 

""My apologies,"" I shouted, unconsciously snapping my fingers as I spoke. ""Are you going to help me get my revenge or not?""

""There is no revenge,"" spoke the demon. ""Only in forgiveness may one find the path that leads...""

""Okay! That's fine! Thank you. Fine. You are released."" I spread my arms wide. ""I thank you for your time, but our business is concluded. Please return to the bowels of Hell from whence you came.""

The demon's pale face remained calm and still. She didn't go anywhere.

""Go away now. Thank you.""

Still nothing. I retrieved the ancient text, flipping anxiously through the dusty pages. Nothing. There was nothing on banishing a demon back to the underworld.

The demon was plucking absently upon her lyre. ""Joseph, do you seek redemption for your Earthy sins?""

""Yes,"" I muttered. ""One sin in particular.""

If you are reading this and have familiarity with the rites and codes of demons, please send word. She follows me everywhere. She is always watching. She is forever noting the respective sinfulness of my actions. 

I have brought Hell upon myself. If mercy is possible, please, *please* send help at all speed.

Yours in Damnation,

*Joseph A. Levine*

""Gets cold earlier here, dear,"" she says, smiling in a way that's much too wide and much too sincere for a sane person to smile. ""Knitted it myself.""

""Oh. Thanks."" I'll put it in the pile. I have a pile now. A pile of hand-knit sweaters. Canada is weird.

People wave at me in the grocery store. It's perverse. Box of macaroni. Mark Jones says hi. Gallon of milk. Candy Reed hopes I'm settling in okay. Bag of potatoes. Lyle Boggart jokingly invites himself over for poutine. 

These people are crazy. This country is crazy. 

What the hell have I done?

I miss LA. I miss the action. The lights. The smells. The *heat*. I miss sitting in my car for four hours a day. I still do that sometimes. Sit in my car. Crank the A/C. Go nowhere.

It's not the same.

Miller said it would be an adjustment. 

""They won't look for you here,"" he'd said. ""Not a place like this. If they don't buy the body, they'll scour Miami. Rio. Tokyo. Colorful places. Loud places. Not here. No one would ever suspect a guy like you could make it here.""

He wasn't kidding. 

You know they drive on the same side of the roads as America? I guessed that one wrong. Cop was real nice about it. 

""Everyone makes mistakes,"" he'd laughed. ""I'll hold up traffic while you get over to the other side."" 

Sometimes I cut people off just to hear them them honking and cursing at me. Never happens. They wave. Sometimes they yell out, ""Careful now! Nearly got me there, buddy."" Always smiling. Always laughing.

What if I *am* dead? Is this Hell, you think? My eternal punishment?

Half the potato chips at the gas station are ketchup flavored. What is this nightmare? I'm a little surprised they don't sell bread-flavored potato chips.

I sometimes wonder if Dolly ever mourned for me. I should have told her, but it wasn't safe. I love her, but I couldn't bring her and she'd have blabbed eventually. I do wonder what she would have made of this place. There's a strip club about 20 miles out of town. I haven't had the heart to check it out. Wound's too fresh. Besides, I got an idea the whole thing's probably very respectful. Lots of clapping. Guys covering their eyes. Loonies and toonies flying all over the place.

I'll make it work. Eventually. Eventually the old LA soul in me will wither away and I'll make myself a new Canadian soul. I'll learn to love lacrosse and start looking strangers in the eye. I'll be a simpler man. Maybe, I suppose, a better man. 

But there'll always be a part of me that wishes I'd never left. And I'll always think about what could have been. Riddled with bullets? Garroted with a length of piano wire? Buried alive in the desert? 

Happy thoughts. Fond regrets. 

Mary Newsome waves as she walks her dog down the avenue. I wave back out of reflex. The dog squats and I allow myself to fantasize.

I dream and it is only a dream. Before the turd is little more than a turtle's head, reaching out towards sunlight, Mary's hand is wrapped in a biodegradable bag. She is poised and ready.

*CHOOSE* it rasped.

""Jesus Jesus Jesus,"" I muttered to myself, carefully inspecting each fragment of cloth. ""Ah HA! Trick question!"" I shouted. ""Jesus didn't *wear* socks!""

The fabric pieces disintegrated into smoke. 

*YOU HAVE CHOSEN WISELY. THE SUNDIAL OF RA IS YOURS. USE IT WISELY.*

""Woot woot,"" I woot'd, lifting the ancient cylinder high over my head. All that work. All that sacrifice. It had all been worth it.

*SO. WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO WITH THE LEGENDARY SUNDIAL OF RA?* asked the stone octopus. I didn't realize he was still there.

""That's a bit of a personal question,"" I said, cradling the dial in my arms. ""I have vanquished many foes and won many trials for this.""

*I AM AWARE,* said the stone octopus. *IT IS NATURAL TO ASSUME THERE MUST BE A GOOD STORY BEHIND ALL THAT.*

""And I suppose there is,"" I said. ""But, be that as it may, I don't believe we've yet developed the sort of relationship where I'm comfortable sharing such a thing with you. It's...you know...""

Sundial so in hand, I descended the Mountain of Sorrow and returned to the scene of my greatest mistake - Cincinnati, Ohio.

It was summer and school was out, which made it all the easier to make my way to the 50 yard line of McCluskey Field, home of the Fightin' Reindeers - *Go Reindeers!*. This is where it happened - the exact spot where I'd made my biggest mistake 20 years earlier. It was time to make everything right.

I set the sundial down on the ground and began to rotate it with my hands. Once, twice, three times...only seven thousand or so to go.

Ten hours later I was done. My arms ached and I was faint with hunger, but there was no more time to waste. I spoke the evocation to Ra. Sweat dripped into my eyes. The burning invigorated me. Soon *soon*! It was all going to be alright.

I closed my eyes. I could *hear* the sounds of that night - the yells, the murmurs, the whistles, the *voices*. I opened my eyes. I was there.

The last game of the season. The end of my life as a high school football player. 

The day I broke up with Cindy Richling. 

*Not anymore.*

I looked down. I was *me* again. The young me. Dressed in my old #14 uniform. Streaked in grass and mud. I'd been sacked a lot that game. Like, a state record amount. And we didn't know much about concussions in those days. When a kid was woozy you just slapped them in the face to wake them up. There wasn't a lot of science to it, but it worked all the same.

And there...there was Cindy Richling. Prom Queen. *My* queen. Captain of the cheerleading squad. I ran to her. I grabbed her in my arms and raised her up high. Her eyes were wide. She was shocked to see me.

""Cindy!"" I shouted. ""I was a fool! Forget about Alaska Tech! Forget about D4 football. I just want *you*. Only you. Forever and ever. You and me baby! Forever. And ever! Just us. Forever!""

""Jason Bullis?"" she said. She kept glancing around the field. ""What the...what the fuck happened? Why are we...""

I seemed to be losing her. I set her down and massaged her shoulders. ""It's the final game of the season, remember? And we were going to break up and go our separate ways. Me to further football glory in Alaska and you to some dumb MIT scholarship thing. But listen, *listen*. No."" I shook my head for emphasis. ""I'm throwing it away. All away. I just want you. Only. You. How does that sound, baby?""

Cindy just kept blinking and shaking her head like she couldn't understand a word I'd said. ""No. No. I'm *married.* I have kids. I work for *Google* for christ's sake. What the hell is happening?""

Just like that smug octopus bastard to not explain how the goddamn sundial worked.    

""You're...I think you're having delusions or something, baby,"" I said. ""*Goggle?* What's a goggle? We're...you know...we're high school kids about to start our lives together. I bet my dad can get us both jobs at the video store. And that's a good career as far as you know.""

""Cindy?"" Tommy Moore tapped Cindy on the shoulder. ""That's you, Cindy?""

""Tommy?"" she said.

""What the hell is happening?"" said Tommy. ""I was just at home watching *Narcos* and all of a sudden I'm back at Windham High?""

Cindy grabbed Tommy's arm. I tried to pull her back. It didn't work. ""I'm not crazy, right?"" she said.

""Definitely crazy,"" I barked, stepping between the two of them. ""You too, Tommy. Both weird and crazy. Look around. We're in high school. You're both talking nonsense. Shut up and stop talking.""

Tommy glared at me. ""We're not crazy, Jason. This isn't a weird flashback for you?""

""Tommy, wow,"" I said. ""Drugs much? I mean, come on. You just...Cindy, can I talk to you in private?""

Cindy shook her head and pointed at the ground. ""What the hell is that?""

""Cinder block,"" I said. 

""It's a sundial,"" said Tommy. ""Jason, what the hell are you doing? Something happened and you're the only one acting unreasonably.""

My face twitched uncontrollably as I considered my options. ""Surprise!"" I said. ""We all get a do over! Isn't that great? We get to start over as young adults and make *way* better decisions this time. You. Are. All. So. Welcome.""

""What!?"" said Cindy. ""I already did this shit. I have a family!""

""Who the hell wants to be 19 again?"" said Tommy. ""They don't even have Netflix yet!""

I sighed. ""You know...I stabbed a shadow monster in the heart for this.""

""Grow up, Jason,"" said Cindy.

98,"Dal Kensington clicked his pen as he glanced around the conference room.

""No coffee? Snacks?""

Sheila Marshall shook her head. She was in HR. Dal couldn't remember her title. Maybe Assistant...HR...Lady...something?

""Julia's out,"" said Sheila. ""She's uh...""

""Julia, too?"" cursed Dal. ""Shiiiiiit. Wayne, you know how to work the Keurig?""

Wayne Nguyen puffed out his cheeks. He was IT. But not computers IT...more like, building websites IT? Maybe? Dal really needed to check the org chart. ""That's not really my department,"" said Wayne. ""I'm more of a tea guy, anyway.""

""You can make tea with a Keurig,"" said Dal, sagely. ""They sell, you know...little tea cups. For the machine thing.""

Wayne nodded. ""Okay.""

Dal looked around the table. ""Is this it?""

""Mike Westin's coming up with a report,"" said Sheila. 

""What's Mike do?"" asked Dal.

""QA,"" said Sheila.

""Q...A...""

""Quality Assurance,"" said Sheila.

""Yep,"" said Dal. ""Well, we definitely need him.""

Moments later the door to the conference flew open. Mike Westin, panting, sweating, clothes torn half to shreds, plopped down at the conference table and pulled out his laptop.

""Sorry,"" said Mike. ""It's uh...it's not good out there.""

""We know,"" said Dal. ""Julia's out. No coffee.""

Mike's face fell. ""No coffee? Crud. Okay. Well...what's the WiFi password on this floor?""

Dal looked at Wayne. Wayne shrugged. ""I'm not Admin. I'm systems."" 

""CODEX12345,"" said Sheila. Dal frowned at Wayne.

""Okay,"" said Mike. ""So, I suppose we should start with a report on...you know...what happened there.""

""Sounds good,"" said Dal, absently standing and turning towards where the coffee was usual located, then slumping back down into his chair dejectedly.

Mike pulled up a series of charts and graphs on the display at the front of the room. ""So, CODEX Model P01. The commercial model. Okay, so so far we've moved 430,000 of these models to homes in the United States. Which is pretty good, by the way. Well exceeding Q2 projections.""

""I'm not sure we need the sales figures,"" said Sheila. ""I think the current concern is the *event*. Correct?""

Dal realized she was looking at him. ""Yes. Definitely. Great numbers. Good numbers. Very proud of those numbers. But Sheila's right. Let's get to the QA stuff, because of...you know.""

""Well,"" said Mike, taking a deep breath. ""To get a better understanding of *why* this happened, we'd need programmers in here to walk us through the coding issues.""

Dal turned to Wayne. ""That's external systems,"" said Wayne. ""I'm internal systems. I don't know anything about that."" Dal frowned at Wayne.

""So what do we know?"" said Sheila.

""CODEX functions properly,"" said Mike. ""It's not a malfunction. It seems to be a flaw in the code. When CODEX is presented with a null value it defaults to a null solution.""

""Certainly,"" said Dal, blinking rapidly.

""In other words,"" said Mike, ""when the problem presented is not located, CODEX defaults to the same treatment cycle. That treatment cycle is...slightly problematic.""

""What's the cycle?"" said Sheila.

Mike chewed on his lower lip for a moment. ""Uh. So, CODEX defaults to a treatment that basically amounts to a hard reboot.""

""Like with a computer?"" said Wayne. Dal glared at Wayne.

""Yeah,"" said Mike. ""I think that may be the principle behind the code. CODEX basically turns it off and then turns it on again.""

""*It*?"" said Sheila.

""The patient,"" said Mike.

""It turns the patient off, and then turns the patient back on again?"" said Dal. ""So that...*oh.* You *can't* turn people off, can you?""

""No,"" said Mike, shaking his head. ""That is technically killing someone.""

Sheila's face was pale gray. ""So CODEX...*our* CODEX...*kills* people and then...what? Reanimates them?""

""Well,"" said Mike. ""You guys saw what it looks like out there. It's...you know...it's not good.""

""How did this not come out in testing?"" said Sheila, visibly shaking.

""Okay, that's a fair question,"" said Mike. ""Like I said, this is all triggered by null values in the examination phase. Meaning, no illnesses. No disease. We, um, well we really just tested *actual* sick people. Which, let's be fair here, that's what we assumed our base consumer would be.""

Dal nodded. ""That's true. I remember Marketing talking about that. They said our core audience was sick people. They had pictures and everything.""

Sheila grimaced. ""So what are we going to *do* about this? I don't want to be an alarmist or anything, but it does feel a bit like we may have caused an actual zombie apocalypse.""

""Let's not use the ""A"" word,"" said Dal. ""*Zombie incident.* Much more neutral.""

""What do we do?"" said Mike. ""Well, CODEX can probably fix this. This is what it does. We just need IT to alter the programming so it starts curing zombie-ism.""

Dal, Sheila, and Mike all turned to Wayne. Wayne sighed. ""I'm *not* product! Internal *only*.""

""What the hell does that even mean?"" said Dal.

Before Wayne could answer, the room was filled with a loud moaning, filtering in through the door. Dal jumped to his feet and yanked the door open.

""Keep it quiet out here!"" he bellowed. ""We're trying to have a...oh hey, Julia's here! Julia, can you show me how to...AAAHHHHHHH!!""",2016-09-27 15:05:40+00:00,d845zsg,1.0,t3_54pxdz,16921.0,WritingPrompts

100,"Layestes warned me there would be days like today. On a still autumn night, sitting on spindly iron chairs outside a small Italian cafe long since demolished, drinking bitter coffee and watching woozy lovers cross the plaza with hidden hands in hidden places, he told me abandon any notion of gratitude.

""Don't bother trying to explain yourself."" He spoke in a husky purr, layered all over in the dancing consonants of his native Turkish. ""You are a shepherd now. You protect the flock. Does the sheep appreciate the shepherd? It tolerates, perhaps. It tolerates until the shepherd is hungry and the shepherd must eat. To the sheep, then, the shepherd is evil.""

""And the wolf?"" I said, raising my face to the moon's radiant warmth as I sipped my espresso slowly.

""What sheep knows the wolf?"" he said, smiling, not unlike a wolf himself. ""Perhaps when the sheep meets the wolf it has a moment of understanding. Perhaps, just then, it appreciates the shepherd. But when the sheep knows the wolf it is much too late for the sheep to share his revelations.""

""Ah,"" I said. ""And should the shepherd abandon the sheep?""

Layestes nodded. ""A shepherd with no sheep is a poor shepherd; a poor, hungry, naked shepherd. And wolves with no shepherds may overrun their territory until there are no sheep, there are only sad, naked shepherds...and so, so many wolves.""

A woman stumbled as she passed our table. I was at her side before her knee touched the ground. 

""Careful, miss."" My Italian was confident, if exotically accented. 

She thanked me. She smelled of rose petals and red wine. Her skin was pale - nearly blue in the moonlight. My hands tingled where I had grabbed her arm. 

""It is a curse,"" said Layestes as I retook my seat. ""None would argue otherwise. But blessed is the shepherd, dear Calvert, for he keeps these things in balance. Hate us though they may, the sheep need us. Always remember that. As bleak as things may be.""

And today they are bleak, indeed.

This Morgan is a tenacious man. By my reckoning he has hunted me for more than five years. He began his hunt as a hired man, paid handsomely by the family of Claire Turner, an Englishwoman I claimed some time ago. As far as I am aware, that bounty has since been rescinded, but still Morgan comes. It may be professional pride. It may be something more personal. I do not know. 

I did not come to this island to hide. I am here on business of my own. There is a spring in the valley on the northern side of the island. This spring hides a door. The door leads to tunnel, which opens to a lair in the center of the island.

There is a nest in this spring. In this nest are a clutch of black eggs.

These eggs cannot hatch.

Arriving at the island, I first took residence within an ancient church, abandoned ages past. The floors are rotted through and the roof sags deeply, straining under the weight of molded bramble and debris. In the priest's chambers I found an old footlocker, large enough for a man to fit. This is where I sleep during the day.

It has taken time to find the spring. It has taken further time to find the hidden opening. In that time, however, this man Morgan has caught up to me.

I eluded him in the valley. The light of dawn was still before us and he cannot match my power in the darkness. But the morning was far too near at hand to risk an engagement and simply end this interminable hunt. So I fled. 

I returned to my place within the old church. I could not have guessed that he knew of my hiding place. Someone must have seen, careful though I have been.

Even so, I had hope when it was simply Morgan. In the darkened arena of the old church, I would still hold some advantage over a single man, even one so specialized as Morgan.

But Morgan is clever and men do not suffer avoidable risk.

He has rallied the townsfolk. The ones I have arrived here to save. The ones that will be swarmed over in black death within two nights time should I fail.

He has brought the townsfolk and they have brought their torches. 

It is morning and the days are long this time of year. 

They are my flock. I will not forsake them. Even as they have always forsaken me. ",2016-09-26 14:59:25+00:00,d82ozrq,1.0,t3_54kns5,4119.0,WritingPrompts

106,"Sure. So in the U.S. at least if you have bad credit or no credit, lenders may still offer you loans or credit cards, but these loans and credit cards come with really unfavorable terms - big fees, high interest rates, etc. These are called subprime loans and credit card. Additionally, there's recently been a rise in title/payday loans. These are short-term loans theoretically designed to cover an unexpected emergency - you're supposed to pay them off when you get your next paycheck, but many people end up having to re-up on their loan over and over, which is horrible because the interest rates are astronomical.

107,"""It isn't worth it,"" said Niklas, trying to grab the phone out of my hands. ""The terms are trash. You're gonna be miserable. Just sit it out, man.""

I pushed him off. He was right - the profile certainly had a *lot* of fine print, and I wasn't thrilled with all the contractual details, but what else was I supposed to do?

""Nik, my L-credit's trash,"" I said. ""The thing with Viv *ruined* me. This is it for me. This is my atonement.""

Niklas shook his head. ""*Or* just fucking stay out of that shit for a while. It's a demerit-based system, Quinn. Give it time. Five...seven years out from the Viv thing and it'll be like you're starting all over. You can get a nice secured relationship. Someone else looking to raise their score. It's not a big deal.""

That just about sealed it for me. ""*Seven fucking years?* Are you absolutely mental? I'm not going solo for seven years! I'll be an old, washed up, middle-aged perv by then. It won't matter what my L-credit looks like. No, I've got to do this. I need to start improving my score *now*, so I can trade up to something top tier before I'm too old to start a family.""

Niklas drained the last of his coffee and chucked the empty cup into the bin. ""You're an idiot. Subprime relationships are a scam. Everyone knows that.""

""They're not a scam. It's just a hardship. I'll manage. And as long as I don't fuck up again, I'll be back in the black in a couple years.""

""Have fun,"" said Niklas. ""I'm going back to work.""

I waved sarcastically. Niklas just didn't understand. In fact, I'm pretty convinced that if you've never had a bad L-credit score, there's no way you *could* understand. Bad L-credit just takes a shit situation and makes it worse. It's a pit. And if you don't get your head out of your ass, you just end up digging deeper and deeper.

And besides, this Rebecca seemed nice enough. Her own L-credit score was mid-range. Respectable. She was only on the subprime list because of her demands. And that's not so bad. Just meant she had standards. 

I messaged her. Complimented her profile pictures. Noted I had similar tastes in music and film. Expressed a desire to get a drink sometime.

Her reply was perhaps a bit telling, but fair.

""HOW'D YOU GET SUCH A LOW SCORE? DEETS OR NO GO.""

It's hard to explain what happened with Vivian in a single conversation, let alone in a text chat. Like a lot of things in life, it was much more complicated than it seems from a distance.

I replied: ""Last GF and I drifted apart. Bad communication. Bad ending.""

She replied: ""BULLSHIT. YOUR SCORE IS WAY LOW. YOU DID SOMETHING.""

And that was true. I made out with Trisha, Vivian's best friend. But like I said, it was complicated.

I replied: ""Made mistake. Kissed someone else. Relationship was already dying.""

She replied: ""YOU SOUND LIKE A WINNER. MAKE IT DINNER. YOU PAY.""

I gripped my hands into tight fists. Right. *Atonement.* This is what I deserved.

I replied: ""Sounds great. Pick the place.""

She replied: ""REAL MEN PICK THE PLACE.""

Okay. It was going to be fine. All part of the process.

I met Rebecca at a fancy sushi restaurant. I'd offered to pick her up, but she didn't want me to know her address. 

""What's with the car?"" she asked, as I stepped forward to give her a hug.

""What's...what?""

""I thought you worked in marketing?"" said Rebecca. ""Your car's like...ten years old.""

""Five,"" I said, pulling absently at the collar of my shirt. ""I hear this place is great.""

""You've never been?"" said Rebecca. ""So neither of us will know what we're doing? Great."" She stood at the side of the door. Taking the hint, I opened the door for her. ""Okay,"" is all she said to that particular gesture.

I ordered dinner for both of us, as Rebecca only looked at the drink menu. ""I don't know sushi,"" she'd said. ""I'm not a huge fan.""

""Would you have preferred to go somewhere else?"" I asked.

""What difference does that make?"" said Rebecca. ""We're already here, aren't we?""

I smiled. ""Right. Future reference, I guess.""

Rebecca excused herself. While she was gone I took out my phone and pulled up my *Karma_Counter* profile. ""Up five points,"" I whispered to myself. So far, so good.

Rebecca tried everything and liked nothing. Her drink was returned twice for being too watered down. She was also unimpressed with my shirt, my haircut, and the way I held my glass of water. 

""I don't know,"" she said. ""It's too low on the glass. That's like how little kids hold a glass. I keep thinking you're going to drop it."" 

I smiled and stopped drinking water for the rest of the meal.

Although she made it very clear that she had a rotten experience, Rebecca agreed to a second date. We met for brunch. She ordered spaghetti, which was very much not on the menu.

We went to a museum for our third date. She took pictures of all the exhibits, even as the unpaid volunteers chasing us around the building told her not to. 

""I paid for my ticket,"" was all she would say when they threatened to have her removed. She did not pay for her ticket.

On it went. And although every day had become a fresh nightmare of debasing text messages and financially crippling outings, my L-credit was on the rise.

""It's not worth it,"" Niklas said one day after work, as we walked to the gym. ""No matter what your score looks like, you're gonna come out of this so damaged it won't matter.""

""What doesn't kill me only makes me stronger,"" I replied.

""Are you a fucking Buddha now?""

""I am beyond Earthly torment.""

""We'll see,"" said Niklas.

And we did see. Almost immediately. Because Rebecca called me while I was at the gym that day, and when I did not answer, she texted me, and when I did not answer she left messages on my various social media platforms. When I did not reply to *those*, Rebecca began a rather impressive social media carpet-bombing campaign, in which what remained of my character was obliterated beyond recognition, while all females in any way connected to my accounts were interrogated and, if they made the mistake of defending themselves or me, called some variation of the word ""whore"".

It was not an especially pleasant way to come down off a post-workout high.

I called things off with Rebecca. It was not a pleasant break-up. In fact, if my relationship with Rebecca was a time bomb, you could say I'm still finding hidden pieces of shrapnel to this day. She is not someone who lets things go easily. 

More atonement, I guess.

My L-credit is, once again, a flaming barrel of baby diapers. Worse, actually, than it was before Rebecca. Niklas was right, which is always a wretched thing to have to admit. But it's fine. I've learned my lesson. No subprime relationships. I'm just going to live with my rotten L-credit. It's not the worst thing in the world.

*Although*...I did just see a new service open up next to the Arby's down on Mallard. *Title Love*, I think it's called. Short-term relationships - they only last until your next paycheck! And they don't even *check* your L-credit! 

I mean, obviously I can get by on my own, but some deals are just too good to pass up.",2016-09-24 18:47:42+00:00,d80es7d,1.0,t3_54ailq,12757.0,WritingPrompts

109,"Bertram wears his thinking cap. That's what I call it anyway. Really, it's just a silly little dog-sized Sherlock hat he lets me put on him as long as I give him plenty of treats first. It's important, though. He's my sidekick. He's got to look the part.

I put on the long, wool scarf my Nan knitted me last year. It's red and green and blue and goes around my neck four full times, with plenty left over. I also wear a gray bowler hat. I think that came from a Halloween costume of Dad's. It's kinda cheap and plastic-looking, and it's much too large, but it's the best detective hat I could find in their closet. Last, I get my spyglass. It's just a magnifying glass. It may have come out of a box of Trix, but it works pretty good. It makes little things big, and that's all that matters. In fact, that's most of what detective work *is*, says Dad.

""Finding the little things that are actually big things in disguise,"" he says. But not actually little thing. He means little *seeming* things.

So Bertram is ready and so am I. It's Friday night. Mystery Night!

Last week was a hum-*dinger*! Mom's necklace went missing. Her favorite one - with the turquoise stone and the rose gold heart. Not in the bedroom and not in the bathroom. Not in the house at all! I asked the right questions, though. That's another thing Dad always says about detecting. ""The right question makes all the difference."" So I asked her where she'd been and who she'd talked to and what they'd said and how they'd *looked* and I figured it out! It was the desk lady at the gym! She'd been very envious of Mom's pretty necklace and she knew the code to the electronic locks in the locker room. Motive and means! Mom and Dad drove me over to the gym and sure enough, I got the desk lady to fess up!

Of *course* I know it was all make believe. People don't just steal from each other and laugh and give it back and say thanks and that's that. People get arrested. Or they lie. Or they hurt each other. But it's fun all the same and Dad says I'm basically a pro.

Anyway, I'm ready to go!

Bertram and I come down the stairs. ""Detective Ellie Gumshoe, on the case!"" I shout. Bertram barks to let everyone know he's there, too. No one says anything back.

I look around. The TV's on in the living room. The lights are on in the kitchen. But I don't see anyone around.  

""Detective Ellie's here!"" I call. No one says anything. I turn off the TV and listen. Nothing.

""Mom? Dad?"" Nothing.

I look at Bertram. His thinking cap's fallen crooked on his head. ""Hey. You don't suppose...?"" I run over to the living room window. It looks out on the driveway. Both cars are there. 

""It's already started,"" I say. ""You see, Bert? *That's* the mystery. I have to find Mom and Dad.""

I start with the obvious. I go back upstairs. I look in their room. It's empty. Not in the closet. Not under the bed. They're not there. 

They aren't in the upstairs bathroom either. ""Not upstairs,"" I say to Bertram. ""So that's eliminated.""

We go back downstairs. I check the guest bedroom. Nothing there. Nothing in the hall closet. Nothing in the living room. 

Okay. 

I decide to leave the basement for last. I don't really like the basement. Mom and Dad know I don't like the basement. I don't think they're down there.

The backdoor in the kitchen is open. That's for sure a clue. I look out at the backyard. There's some toys out there. The lawnmower's still out. It's getting dark, but that's all there is. They're not in he backyard.

Okay. 

I close the kitchen door. I'll check the basement. 

I open the door and turn on the light. The basement smells funny as always. Like dust and old water. I point down the stairs and click my tongue. Bertram doesn't go for it. He doesn't like the basement either. I go down without him.

The stairs are loud. Every step sounds like something's about to break. The railing is wobbly. I make it all the way down. The ground down here is plain cement. There's a big pile of boxes in the corner. I'm not going to check the boxes. They wouldn't be in the boxes. That's not a good mystery. I walk around. Mom's exercise equipment is down here. The thing she runs on and the thing with all the rubber bands. I don't remember the last time she used them. More boxes. The furnace. It's summer, so it's not on. The washer and dryer. 

I hear something! 

Oh, it's Bertram on the stairs. He comes a couple steps down and whines. 

Okay. They're not down here.

I go back upstairs. 

*Where are they?*

Okay, remember. Little things that are actually big things. Okay.

I go back to the kitchen. There's a broken glass on the counter. Wine. I think it had wine in it. Mom likes wine. She broke a glass, but didn't clean it up. Is that a clue? That must be a clue. Why would she break a glass and not clean it up?

What else? What else?

One of the drawers is open. Which one? Oh. The knife drawer. I forgot which that was because I don't ever go in that one. 

Okay. The knife drawer is open. Mom broke a wine glass and left it. The kitchen door was open.

Think think think. Little things that are actually big things. Ask the right questions. Questions...but who can I ask? Mom and Dad aren't here? 

I look through the kitchen window. *Mrs. Meacham!*

Mrs. Meacham lives next door. Her kitchen looks at our kitchen. Sometimes Mom will wave at her when she's cooking. Maybe she saw something?

I walk across the lawn, but leave Bertram at home (Mrs. Meacham doesn't like dogs). Mrs. Meacham answers when I ring the doorbell. 

""Lil' Ellie, how are you?"" she says. She likes me. 

""Hi Mrs. Meacham,"" I say. ""I was wondering if you saw anything suspicious tonight? Like, anything in my kitchen?""

""Say again, dear? What happened in your kitchen?""

""Nothing,"" I say. ""But my parents are missing and I'm collecting clues, so I wondered if maybe you...""

""*Missing*?"" says Mrs. Meacham. ""You're all alone? What happened?""

""It's a mystery,"" I explain. I'm getting worried that Mrs. Meacham is getting worried. She doesn't know about Mystery Night. ""It's okay. I'm trying to solve it. But all I know so far is that the backdoor was open, there's a broken glass of wine, and the knife drawer was left open, too. So I thought maybe you might have seen or heard...""

But Mrs. Meacham is just getting more and more worried and not really listening to me. ""Are you playing or are you telling me your parents are missing?"" She grabs my shoulders. It kind of hurts. 

""We're playing,"" I say. ""They're missing and I'm trying to find them. It's Mystery Night.""

Mrs. Meacham just shakes her head and grabs hold of my arm. ""I don't know what's going on. I need to talk to your parents. You're giving me a *fright*, girl.""

She pulls me out of her house. ""But you *can't* talk to them."" I really don't know how to make Mrs. Meacham understand. ""They're missing."" She just shakes her head and drags me back to my house. 

We go in through the kitchen door. Bertram barks and Mrs. Meacham kicks at him. ""Get that thing away from me!""

I lead Bertram to the bathroom and close the door. He starts howling immediately. ""It's not a bad thing,"" I say. ""I was just looking for clues. I'm sorry I bothered you."" 

Mrs. Meacham isn't listening to me. ""Glen? Polina? Are you home? Your daughter is playing strange games. Are you *here*?""

I start to get worried about Mystery Night. If Mrs. Meacham keeps yelling and making a fuss, maybe my parents will come and I'll never solve the mystery. And then maybe they'll never want to do Mystery Night anymore. What if Mrs. Meacham calls the police? What if my parents get in trouble?

""It's okay,"" I keep saying, chasing Mrs. Meacham around the house. ""It's okay! It's just a game. It's just a mystery.""

Mrs. Meacham searches almost exactly like I did earlier, then she shakes her head. ""This isn't right. I'll call the police.""

""No!"" I shout, and I say it so loud Mrs. Meacham finally notices me again. I think fast. ""You didn't look in the basement.""

I'm not really thinking. I'm just scared. Scared for my parents. Scared for us. Mrs. Meacham's really going to ruin everything. I know she is. 

Mrs. Meacham goes to the basement and opens the door. Bertram is still howling in the bathroom. ""What's down there?"" she asks me.

""Exercise stuff,"" I say.

She leans over and turns on the light. ""Glen? Polina? You down there?""

I barely touch her. At least, I think I barely touched her. I don't really remember to be honest. All I remember is that she went forward and I saw her feet weren't touching anything and I slammed the door closed behind her. All I could hear was Bertram's howling.

I drag a chair over and leave it in front of the basement door. I don't know what that does. I know I've seen it in movies before.   

I let Bertram out of the bathroom. He had an accident on the bathmat. That's okay.

I go back outside and sit down on the steps. My hands are shaking. My everything is shaking. I'm not a very good detective.

I look up and see it. Why hadn't I seen it before? How come I'd forgotten it?

I wander across the yard. Bertram follows me. We walk to the shed way down at the edge of the lawn. The door is unlocked. I push it open.

""You got us!"" shouts Dad.

""Took you long enough,"" says Mom. She's smiling. She's not mad.

""I kidnapped your mom,"" says Dad. ""And then dragged her to my lair. Mwah haha!""

""I'd've been finished if not for the brave and intelligent, Detective Ellie Gumshoe!"" says Mom. ""But now I'm famished. Dinner?""

""I want pizza,"" says Dad, laughing as he picks me up and hugs me to his chest. ""Wow. You're getting big, aren't you?""

I don't say anything. I don't say anything at all. 

He carries me back into the house.     ",2016-09-23 20:29:52+00:00,d7zccwp,1.0,t3_546be6,5838.0,WritingPrompts

113,"*Dearest Agatha,*

*If there is a lesson to be learned in all of this, it may simply be that the value of dressing well and showing common courtesy is impossible to underestimate.*

*To step back within the narrative, I'll begin by confirming the facts with which you are already familiar. Following the War, of which I was but a humble spectator and not a participant, in large part due to a hereditary trait which causes swelling in my joints during moments of stress and would therefore make me a certain liability upon the field of battle, I took a holiday in the French countryside. As I explained to my Father, the purpose of this was to clear my head and return to the States fully prepared to regain my position within the family meat processing empire.*

*During my travels, however, I met a gentleman who raved of certain entertainments to be found in the City of Paris. He described these entertainments in such a way that it seemed foolish not to at least make the trip and verify his many claims. So to Paris I went. In searching for the building in which these entertainments may be found, I became a bit misdirected. I did, however, come to find myself walking before a pair of English-speaking gentlemen and took to following them, in the hopes that they may also be seeking these noted entertainments.*

*These gentlemen arrived at a grand building. Through overheard conversation, I learned that this was the French Foreign Ministry and* not *the site of the entertainments I sought. As I considered my mistake, wonderfully formal footmen held open the door. When the gentlemen went in and the footmen remained holding the door open, I realized that they assumed I was with the other gentlemen. Preferring not to make these hired men feel foolish in their (perfectly reasonable) assumption, I entered the building.*

*Once inside, I had all intentions of taking a brief tour and then leaving, however, I was immediately approached by an official of some authority. He asked which nation I represented. Now, you must understand, I made a mistake of judgment in this moment. I did not previously know what the purpose of the French Foreign Ministry might be, so I assumed (and I argue it was reasonable to do so) that they managed affairs primarily concerned with foreign tourists. Therefore, when the gentleman asked my name and which nation I represented, I thought he was serving as the equivalent of a guest book, merely collecting pertinent information.*

*That is why I thought it would be a laugh to say what I said.*

*""I represent the Great, Misunderstood Nation of Gervonia,"" I told the man, which caused him to blink in confusion.*

*""Gervonia, sir?"" he said, flipping through sheets of paper. ""And your nation suffered some upheaval during the War?""*

*""Such upheaval!"" I said, wondering only in that moment whether or not the French Foreign Ministry contained a museum or anything of common interest to pass the time. ""The Germans stole the entirety of our livestock, all of our feather pillows, most of our good pens, and a handful of our better looking children.""*

*The man gawped at this, which I took as a sign of a good yarn. ""I suppose you will be arguing for reparations?"" he said.*

*""Indeed,"" I replied, not entirely sure what was meant, but feeling that my little joke was exceeding its station quite substantially. ""We will be demanding land, infantrymen, and a quarter of their richest pastries. The fury of Gervonia is not easily quenched!""*

*The man bowed his head. ""Well, I should think not. Please, find a seat in the hall. The proceeding shall begin shortly.""*

Ah, *I thought to myself*, there must be a show of some variety. *So I took my seat in a grand hall and made myself comfortable. This was not, of course, the entertainment I had traveled so far to experience, but you know as well as any, Dear Agatha, that I am not so rigid as to refuse a pleasant change of plans.*

*What followed, in all honesty, was a bit drab for my tastes. It was largely just a lot of talking and talking. There were Americans there, as well as Brits, Japs, Italians, and a few others. None did much to hold my attention. I was thoroughly bored and considering my escape when I heard someone call out my name. I sat up on instinct as they named me the representative of Gervonia, an aggrieved party to the War.*

*""What does Gervonia seek?"" said someone I did not manage to see.*

*The man from earlier stood up. ""They seek land, military armament, and food rations,"" he said, before nodding in my direction.*

*""Land?"" scowled a muttonchop'd fellow in a luxurious overcoat. ""That pie cannot be sliced any further.""*

*""We aren't a fussy people,"" I said, standing up. ""Just a small bit, something off one of the ends will be fine. Preferably something with a river or a chocolate factory.""*

*""And you require arms?"" said another man. ""The War is over, sir.""*

*""Well,"" I replied, ""Gervonia believes in an eye for an eye. We were invaded, rather rudely, so we would like the opportunity to do the same. That seems fair to me.""*

*""To be clear,"" said the muttonchopped'd fellow. ""You want a piece of Germany, as well as the arms and supplies necessary to invade her?""*

*""We can invade someone else, if you like,"" I said. ""As I stated, we are not a fussy people. I think it's more the principle of the thing. We can't sit around, getting invaded, and not do a bit of invading ourselves. It's demoralizing.""*

*I realize, my dear, that this letter has gone on perhaps a bit longer than usual, so I will sum up by saying that if you are so inclined, you should consider purchasing a ticket and joining me here on the old continent. Gervonia is, at the moment, a relatively sparse plot of land, but there is a very good chance we will have invaded Luxembourg by the time this letter reaches you and I hear they have some rather nice cafes.*

*Yours in love,*

*F. Paul Risenbaum, III*

*President and Supreme Emperor*

121,"I enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't have any suggested changes, but I had a few random thoughts:

I'm not sure what you mean by the opening line (*Tell yourself imagination isn't real.*) I took the intended meaning as ""Tell yourself that the *things you imagine* aren't real"", but the literal interpretation of the sentence would be ""Tell yourself that the *ability to imagine* is not real,"" which is a slightly odd thing to say at the beginning of a story where the narrator repeatedly asks you to imagine things. 

It felt like the central idea here was to be manipulated by the narrator into creating and murdering a (fictional) woman. I really like that idea, especially in a ""meta"" story, as it lays bare the heart of storytelling (manipulating your audience for fun and profit). I think, however, that because it didn't feel like I had that active a hand in forming this ""victim"", I didn't really *feel* all that much when we got to the end. Even though you present a few alternatives for her backstory, there's a pretty clear narrative through-line that never really deviates. Driven woman with possible mob background does morally dubious stuff on the way to the top, making numerous enemies along the way. So the character and her story are already there and you're just asking me - the reader/co-conspirator - to kill her, while you step out of the room. 

It might be worth an experiment to try either giving the reader more ownership of the character's backstory, OR continuing to hand-hold the reader through the actual murder (after all, you've only given us the *illusion* of control throughout the story, so saying ""This is your story"" and then forcing us to witness her unavoidable murder would be par for the course). 

Again, though, I did quite like this (enough to read it three times). I think an audio version could be very intriguing.",2016-09-21 14:47:05+00:00,d7w1wsy,1.0,t3_53qqfk,48967.0,WritingPrompts

123,"The *Fiesta de la Muerte* is an ancient vessel, aye. Built in the days when the local ship builders took a far greater pride in their labors (Old Gormley estimates 1987), she is painted a lovely sky blue and bears the figure of a headless baseball man upon her prow. Legend tells that the figure once bore a head indeed and that the head would bob up and down in mimicry of the ocean's waves. At some point the head was dislodged. The body, however, is glued quite firmly.

The ship was won in a game of chance. Specifically, weekly fantasy football. Luck was with me that week, aye. Luck and a rash of undiagnosed concussions. 

While many would suggest that the *Fiesta de la Muerte* is no longer travel-worthy, I saw in her compact, boxy features a unique opportunity. She was, after all, built in that lost time - back before all ships were governed centrally by powers unseen. In other words - she was *free*.

So equipped, I set about assembling my crew. Old Gormley was first, which seemed providence to me. He was, after all, the first father of my first wife, and the first man to visit me in jail at the conclusion of that relationship. We had long been fast friends and there are few I trust more. 

Second was the quiet Meep, a stony boy with an obtuse past. I do not know if I trust Meep, to be honest, but his technical knowledge is vast and his WiFi hotspot is strong indeed.

Third and last was sweet, simple Mallory, the Queen of the Lanes and the hatchet in my heart. Our love was born in rivalry - a jealousy that sparked when my *Most Wanted* picture appeared above hers at the local Post Office. She sought me out, almost certainly with deadly intentions, but our chemistry was instant and she landed only a few glancing hacks before our love was unearthed.

Together we roam the dusty gray waste of Middle America, lurking in those grand, quiet spaces between cities, hunting for treasure. Old Gormley is the only one old enough to remember clearly the time when ships moved freely, controlled by nothing more than the whims of man and the flagging availability of fossil fuels. So it is Old Gormley who mans the helm of the *Fiesta de la Muerte* while I sit at his side and call out commands. In the back, Meep uses his many ""devices"" to ""hack"" the ""drive command"" of our targets. It is a strange black magic that requires an especially costly data plan.

Targets so acquired and disabled, the work is quick and easy. Meep pushes the ship off the road. With the press of a button, the rear hatch is activated, presenting to us the many spoils of our journey. There is a brief sorting process. Space is limited on the *Fiesta de la Muerte*. We must be choosy in our plundering. 

The freight having been picked clean, we move to the passengers. Old Gormley carries a very large wrench. Mallory wraps her fists in sandpaper and swears a lot. I wear rather heavy boots, with which I make a show of kicking out their headlights. It is all very intimidating. Meep calculates the cost of the hypothetical damage we may be able to inflict upon their ship and their bodies. He then presents a tablet and suggests a payoff of approximately 50 percent that value. Some haggling follows, during which Mallory swears, Gormley grips his wrench, and I stand at the side of the ship with my foot suggestively cocked. Terms are agreed to. Credit cards are tapped. We make our escape.

It is not an easy life, no. But it is the life we have chosen. Someday I fear that justice may catch up to us and we shall be punished bodily for our crimes. But until that day, the freeways of America are vast indeed and full to the brim with a bounty beyond measure.

126,"Samantha couldn't even *remember* the last time she'd been on a date. Six months? A whole *year*? It was so hard being a single mom in the city, working late nights for the hottest fashion start-up in the country under a jealous, demanding boss, surrounded by sassy, sometimes conniving, ultimately sorta forgettable co-workers. She was ashamed to admit that some nights she still held out hope that Chad would get it together and come marching through that door, bringing all his baggage and those killer abs with him. No matter how distant and mean he could sometimes be, Sam always just *melted* whenever he smiled and wrapped her in those long, taut arms.

*This is big*, Samantha whispered to herself, nervously rearranging the silverware and smoothing out the front of her dress. Her kooky best friend Lorna was watching Jacob. The office was closed with the venomous Ms. During out of town for the weekend. Finally finally *finally* Sam had found a chance at going out on a real date. Frankly, she didn't much care how things turned out - she was just so excited for an excuse to get out of the house and wear her favorite slinky, black cocktail dress.

The guy sure seemed interesting enough. *Marl* was a strange name, to be sure, and she still wasn't exactly sure what he did for a living. The friend who'd set them up had only said his job was ""ranger"". Was that like a park ranger or an army ranger or...oh wow...maybe he was a professional *hockey player*? Everyone knew hockey players were the hottest athletes...at least the ones who still had most of their teeth.

Samantha was deep inside her own fantasies when a man stumped to the table.

""Samantha Rose?"" he said. Sam did a double-take. At first she was certain that a homeless man had entered the restaurant. He was dressed in a makeshift coat of animal skins, with a heavy, leather rucksack slung across his back. A wild nest of long black hair fell from the top of his head to nearly his shoulders. There was very clearly a sword hanging from a scabbard at his waist.

""Samantha?"" he said once more. 

Sam blinked. ""Oh. Hi. Yes. I'm...I'm Sam. And you must be...""

The man bowed and took his seat. ""Marl. Marl Blackfoot. Son of Huron Blackfoot. I have heard tales of your beauty, Samantha, but truly - the tales do not do you justice.""

Sam blushed. On a second, closer look, Marl was quite handsome himself. He had strong cheekbones and kind blue eyes, half-hidden behind that horrible tangle of hair. His stubbly beard gave him an added air of danger and cunning. 

""You're very kind,"" said Sam. ""Cindy said you were something of a charmer.""

""Cindy?"" said Marl. ""Yes, the old seer who sent me to you. She intoned that a great adventure may await me.""

Sam's face fell. ""Okay, well, I don't know what Cindy said, but if you think I'm easy or something, you're outta luck, bub.""

Marl nodded. ""As my father often said before his death at the hands of the wicked Twilight Mage, if a thing is too easy it is not worth your effort.""

Sam's smile returned. ""Your father sounds like a very wise man. I'm sorry to hear he passed.""

""Ah, sadly he has not passed,"" replied Marl. ""His spirit remains trapped within an amber amulet that the Twilight Mage wears around his neck. It is my hope, simple though I may be, that some day I may defeat this evil man and send my father, as well as many others, to their final resting place within the Legions of Clouds.""

""Right,"" said Sam, picking up her menu. ""It's good to have goals. I hope you like Italian.""

Before Marl could reply, a stiff, shiny man in a red silk shirt appeared at the table carrying a tray. He set two martini glasses down.

""Compliments of the gentleman at the bar,"" said the waiter, pacing away before any questions could be asked.

Samantha looked towards the bar. There was no question who the ""gentleman"" in question could be, as there was only one man there. He was pasty and pale with thinning white hair and nearly translucent eyebrows. He wore a bright white suit with a pale pink tie and pocket square. He also seemed to be attached to an oxygen tank. 

He man met Samantha's eyes and waved.

""Who is he?"" asked Marl.

""I don't know,"" said Samantha. ""I've never seen him before.""

Both eyed the drinks in front of them with curiosity and caution. ""I do not make a habit of drinking strange potions,"" said Marl. ""I must be rude and refuse this courtesy.""

But suddenly, as if he had silently swooped across the room, the gentleman was there, standing alongside the table.

""It's perfectly harmless,"" he said. ""The only poison is the cheap vodka that bartender keeps in the Grey Goose bottle.""

""Do we know you?"" asked Samantha. 

""Oh, not yet,"" said the man. ""But we're about to be intimately involved, so to speak.""

Sam glanced at Marl. ""What the *hell* is Cindy saying about me, anyway?""

""You may have the wrong impression,"" said the white-haired gentleman. ""No, you see the drinks are for a toast. A toast to the end of the world.""

There was a crash just then. A bus boy collapsed in the middle of the restaurant, scattering dirty dishes and silverware in all directions. Marl rose to his feet. The white-haired gentleman laid a hand on the ranger's chest.

""Let it be.""

Marl swatted the hand aside. ""I know the ways of healing,"" he said. ""Step aside.""

""He is already dead,"" said the white-haired gentleman. A woman at a nearby table fell face-first into her chicken parmesan. ""They're *all* already dead. There's no root or herb that can bring back the dead, is there?""

One by one, the occupants of the restaurants all collapsed, plates smashing, glasses shattering - small, human explosions one after another. Eventually, all that was left was Sam, Marl, and the white-haired gentleman. 

""What have you done?"" shouted Marl, reaching for his sword. His hand frozen mid-way through the action. 

""Tut tut,"" said the white-haired gentleman. ""There may be days for sword fighting later, but for now, only listen. I don't particularly care for where things have been headed these last few millennia. Not really to my taste. So when I leave and you are free to walk out of this restaurant, please know that you will be two of the last one thousand people on the entirety of this planet. Don't ask why I've made the choices I've made. I couldn't tell you if I wanted. What's important to know is simply that I will return in ten years. And when I come back, I'd better see some changes for the better. Yes? Because if I don't like what I see...well, I guess we'll have to call it quits on the whole thing, won't we? Enjoy your evening."" 

The white-haired gentleman drained the contents of both martini glasses, smacked his lips, and strolled slowly out of the restaurant. When the door closed behind him, Marl regained the ability to move, drawing his sword and rushing out the door. Moments later he returned.

""He's gone,"" he said. 

Samantha sat still and silent. She could smell something burning in the kitchen.

""Jacob?"" she managed to whisper. Marl placed a hand on her shoulder. She shuddered. ""My son...""

""Let's go,"" said Marl, sheathing his sword. ""I'm sure your son is fine."" But there was a quaver to his voice that could not be hidden. Sam rose on shaky legs.

""It's fine,"" she nodded. ""This is such a strange dream.""

Marl slipped an arm below hers for support. ""Yes. Of course. A dream. I'm certain we'll awaken soon. But for now...I suppose we must play along.""

Together they stumbled out of the restaurant. The world was quiet and cold and their footsteps rang out in the darkness.   ",2016-09-19 14:33:47+00:00,d7t5okl,1.0,t3_53hbl5,7144.0,WritingPrompts
127,"As anyone who knows these sorts of thing will tell you, it takes at least three years for a new identity to stick. And even then, it isn't advised that you draw anything more than the most passing sort of scrutiny. 

Three years of pay stubs. Three years of verified housing. Three years of doctors appointments, car payments, and cable bills. Three years of living in that skin. And again, that's only good enough to look like you from a distance.

Linus Worth had been Linus Worth for four and a half years almost to the day when he set foot inside Cushing's Home for Boys. It had been, to him, a very long time.

""And you say you've fostered before?"" said the pretty, young volunteer. She wore a floral-print dress and a gray cardigan. She did not look Linus in the eyes.

""Yes. In Nebraska,"" said Linus, eyes straight ahead, always following a respectful distance behind. ""A boy named Noah. Quite bright. Very troubled. He ran away after only a week. It was...heartbreaking. I wasn't sure I'd ever have the heart to try again."" He sighed loudly. ""But I want to help. Very badly. And having children was Kristy's biggest wish...""

""Your wife?"" said the volunteer, still marching forward down the linoleum hallway.

""Yes. My wife,"" said Linus.

They stopped outside a room. The door was halfway open. ""Have you considered volunteering?"" said the girl.

""Yes,"" said Linus. ""But I...I think something more *committed* would work best for me. I have a lot of...love to give.""

The girl nodded, then pushed open the door. ""Davey? This is Mr. Worth. He wanted to meet you.""

The boy in the room was wiry and dark, with hunched shoulders and an upturned mouth. He was also missing one eye. The remaining eye blazed as he glared up at Linus and the volunteer.

""You a homo?"" said Davey, not bothering to set down the cover-less paperback in his hands.

""*Davey*!"" said the volunteer. ""You've been warned about talking like that. Mr. Worth is a guest.""

""Is Mr. Worth a homo?"" replied Davey. 

""I'm sorry,"" said the girl, still not able to look Linus in the eyes. ""He...well, I'm sure Davey would be happy to tell you about his background.""

He was not. Still, the girl was able to coax out some of the finer details. A dead father. A mother in jail. Two sisters in the system he'd already written off as lost. If any part of his life had caused Davey pain you wouldn't know it. He presented everything as fact, no more notable or traumatic than the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.

The sessions continued for two months. Two months of Linus listening, still-faced and thoughtful. Two months of Davey's pointed verbal abuse. Somewhere in those two months someone with the authority to do so had decided both parties had suffered enough, in their own unique ways. The paperwork was substantial. It took Linus just over an hour to complete. But in the end, Davey was his.

""You got some fag pad?"" said Davey, sprawled out in the passenger's seat of Linus' gently used Honda. ""You stick a dick in my mouth I swear I'll fuckin' bite it off.""

""Davey, how many times have I told you that you've got the wrong impression of me?"" said Linus, pulling off the highway and heading out towards the farmland to the north. ""I'm not a homosexual.""

Davey shrugged. ""Pretty faggy to me. Buying lil' boys and all.""

""I didn't *buy* you,"" said Linus with a laugh. ""They *gave* you to me. That's an important distinction to make. If I'd bought you that would imply you were worth something.""

Now Davey laughed. ""Ha! Gettin' bitchy, huh? Time of the month?""

""Davey, Davey,"" sighed Linus. ""You should know why I picked you.""

Davey snorted. The world outside his window was full of trees and rocks and nothing much more. He shifted in his seat.

""I like people like you Davey,"" said Linus, raising a finger. ""And no, not in the way you're so quick to claim. It's not that you're a boy. It's that you refuse to be scared.""

""Man, what the fuck does that mean?"" said Davey. ""I'm sure as hell not scared of *you*.""

Linus nodded, following a rhythm only he could hear. ""Oh, but you *are* afraid. Very afraid. You've been afraid for a very long time now. Afraid of being hurt. You wear that attitude like a shield, because you think it will protect you. You think it will keep away the people who enjoy causing fear. People like your father. But you can't keep those people away, Davey. No, no. And in the end...in the end they always find you.""

""Fuck off,"" said Davey, leaning towards the window. ""Do whatever the fuck you want. I don't care.""

""Good,"" said Linus. ""I suppose I will. But before I do, would you like to make a bet?""

Davey shook his head. ""Fuck off, goddamn faggot.""

""It'll be a good one,"" said Linus. ""Well worth your while. Open the glove compartment.""

Davey glared at the man, but did as he was told. There was a bundled pile of money sitting alone in the compartment.

""I bet that I can make you scream,"" said Linus. ""And I bet I'll do it before the hour is up."" Davey shook his head but said nothing. ""If you make it an hour without screaming, you can have that money and go wherever you like.""

Davey eyed the money. ""Just don't scream?""

Linus smiled. ""One hour. Starting now.""

Davey nodded. ""Alright. Do whatever the fuck you want.""

""No worries,"" said Linus. ""In due time. But first..."" He parked the car. They were just down a slope from a small wooden shack. ""Follow me.""

They walked up the dirt path to the shack. Davey considered his options. He could easily knock the man down and steal the money, but would he have to kill the man to be safe? Davey thought he could, but he wasn't sure. Maybe he could just play along and hope the man was being honest?

Linus saw the deliberation playing out behind the boy's eyes. It was very pleasing to him. ""Oh, I forgot one small thing,"" he said as he pushed open the door to the shack and swept Davey inside with a gentle hand. He flicked on the lights.

""We've got company,"" said Linus, holding the boy firmly by the shoulders. ""How long has it been since you've seen your sisters?""

128,"Gagqa sat on the rim of a black plastic rain gutter circumventing the outer face of a Red Robin in downtown Binghamton, NY. There were seven other crows on the rain gutter with Gagqa, but they were - as always - abysmal company.

""Thoughts on that new traffic light on Vermont and Dunham?"" he offered.

""Food?"" replied one of the crows.

""Rain?"" said another.

""Food,"" stated a third.

""Ah, yes. Wonderful,"" sighed Gagqa. 

The crows at least had never stopped believing in Gagqa, and for that he was thankful. He supposed, in a way, they'd never really had a choice, being that he was a *crow* spirit. For a crow, believing in Gagqa was a bit less faith, and a bit more common sense. But the humans had once believed in him, too, and they had always been a substantially more entertaining crowd. Some had feared him as a sign of coming death. Others had worshiped him for his wisdom and cunning. Perceptions of the great crow spirit had really been something of a mixed bag. 

Gagqa had been a touch persnickety about his public image, back in the days when he'd had a public image to speak of. He wasn't a fan of the ""trickster"" label that sometimes followed him and made great efforts to be clear and concise in his communications. After all, the only ones who'd named him a trickster were the idiots who didn't understand sarcasm. And where that ""Omen of Death"" business was concerned, if you sleep with a blanket covered in small pox *you're going to catch small pox*. That's not exactly fortune-telling.

The world changed, and it wasn't simply a matter of old lines dying off. Gagqa and his kind just weren't in style anymore. Little gods. Simple gods. There was no taste for that kind of variety. Humanity seemed to prefer consolidation. Why have a hundred gods with a hundred specialties when you can just have the one god who apparently does everything?

*Seriously*, Gagqa often muttered to himself, *how's anyone supposed to compete with THAT?* One stop shopping, all in one convenient, faceless, personality-free package. 

There really *was* no accounting for taste.

As Gagqa had sat there, considering the semi-ruin of his existence, black clouds had begun to roll in. The other crows *cawed* and took off. Gagqa stayed behind. No place was better. And it wasn't as if he could catch a cold.

From below the billowing awning, a little boy, face smeared aggressively in ketchup, looking less like he'd eaten a hamburger and more like he'd gone directly to the source, stepped out and looked up. He had a pile of soggy French fries in his hand. He held one aloft.

""Fry?"" he said, mouth sticky and slick.

Gagqa looked around. He was alone on the gutter. Was the child talking to him?

""French fry?"" repeated the child, rising up on his tippy toes, as if he were really only a few inches shy of the roof and not 20 feet.

Gagqa bent forward. ""Is that for me?""

The boy nodded his head. ""Wan'it?""

Gagqa hopped down off the gutter, landing on a nearby trashcan. ""You see me?""

The boy's eyes widened, as if sincerity came from the circumference of your eye sockets and he was being very, very sincere.

""This is...an offering?""

""S'French fry,"" corrected the boy.

""For me?"" said Gagqa. ""You are presenting this food as an offering...to me?""

The boy nodded, tossing the fry lazily through the air. Gagqa had to dart sideways to catch it, but he did, and he ate it. He could not immediately remember the last time he had eaten anything. It tasted indescribably good.

""Nuther?"" said the boy, answering his own question by tossing another fry to the waiting crow. Gagqa gobbled it down. Then another. Then another.

""Mom!"" shouted the boy, wiping his hands across his shirt. ""More fries!""

A woman emerged from the restaurant. ""*Jeffrey!*"" she scowled. ""*There* you are! You can't run off like that. What are you doing?""

""Feedin' the bird,"" said the little boy, pointing at Gagqa.

""What bird?""

Gagqa hopped up and down on the trashcan. *No*, he thought, suddenly overwrought with strange desperation. *He sees! He sees! She must be able to see, too!*

Jeffrey pointed at the trashcan. ""Bird,"" he said, as plain and clear as a little boy pointing out a real live bird could be.

A man emerged from the restaurant just then, with an evener smaller girl attached at the wrist. 

""What's going on?"" he asked.

""Feedin' the bird,"" said Jeffrey once more. The woman rolled her eyes.

""He gets his imagination from you,"" said the woman, playfully accusative. 

The man shrugged. ""He just believes what he wants to believe. Nothing wrong with that. C'mon, though. Looks like rain.""

The woman strode forward and grabbed the boy by the wrist. He turned and waved at Gagqa. ""Bye bird."" 

*Well. Goodbye* thought Gagqa bitterly, as the family strode out towards a gray minivan. 

""Bye bird,"" said the little girl, waving back at Gagqa sitting on the trashcan. *Just copying her brother,* said Gagqa to himself. *It's nothing.* But the crow spirit couldn't deny the strange tingle that he felt all over - a trill of excitement that stuck with him the rest of the day, and for a long time after that.

129,"I have named them *Claymores* after my own surname. I know that must seem vainglorious, but I do not apologize. I do not imagine I will ever be presented with another opportunity to name a sentient alien race, and the name, I believe, is striking.

I found them while mineral diving in the Agathobulus Belt. My rear stabilizer was struck, forcing me to land or risk careening directly into an asteroid. I set down on the largest, flattest mass I could find. That is when I discovered the Claymores.

They live inside an asteroid. Except that it is not an asteroid, it is a ship. There are thrust engines at the narrowest end and pulse thrusters hidden within the crags at all angles. Somewhere at some past time, they must have hollowed the thing and made it spaceworthy. It measures less than a kilometer from tip to tip. Judging by the design, I do not suppose it was ever meant to travel at great speeds. 

That said, I do not believe the Claymores are aware that they are on a ship. 

They are small creatures, which is sensible, given the lack of available space within the asteroid. They display two identical trios of thin appendages set at opposite ends of a short torso. In the middle of the torso is a spherical skull that seems to permit 360 degree movement. I have seen no evidence of either eyes or mouths, but I believe this sphere is the equivalent of the head. 

One presumes there is some measure of sensitivity upon the surface of the asteroid, because I certainly did not find the entrance of my own accord. Instead, two emissaries - for lack of a better word - arrived via a shallow air duct, hidden behind a sliding panel of rock. They beckoned me follow, which I did. 

The ecosystem of the place is difficult to describe. There is no light within the asteroid, except for a small amount of bio-luminescence, generated by a sort of slime culture which grows on nearly every surface. The slime seems quite central to the lifecycle within the asteroid, as there is really only the Claymores and the slime, suggesting an exceptionally closed system. Is such a one-to-one system even possible? I assume there is something I am missing.

The Claymores seem to communicate internally by vibration. They make no audible sounds, but I have seen their appendages shake suddenly and in clear patterns. This is usually followed by some action on the part of other Claymores, leading me to believe that messages are being disseminated. 

My speech, it should be noted, has an effect upon the Claymores - it causes them to scuttle away into dark corners and pull into compact spiral shapes. I have guessed that the vibrations of my voice are unpleasant or overwhelming and have discontinued speaking in their presence.

The slime is not palatable to me or, I suspect, any human. Because of this, I knew I would need to repair my ship and leave the asteroid, at least momentarily. The trouble, as mentioned, was the damage sustained to my rear stabilizer. I am not a mechanic, but I felt I might be able to jury-rig a temporary solution that would allow me to escape the belt and send a proper distress signal. 

Examining my ship closely, I felt I may confidently make the necessary repairs if I could find a sufficient replacement for the cracked shielding and broken bypass valve. I asked the Claymores, in a fumbling, roundabout way, if they had anything within their ship resembling the needed parts. I was shocked to see their eager response. They brought me many pieces - most bore no resemblance at all to my request, but a few did. I did not consider at the time where the parts had come from. The Claymores surprised me constantly, so I had become a little dull to the unexpected.

The repairs so made, I bid a fond farewell to the strange creatures, making a promise that I would return. I do not know if they understood this promise. I am loathed to admit that ultimately, I have understood very little of the Claymores.

The flight out of Agathobulus was heart-stopping and treacherous, but I did successfully arrive at open space and, unwilling to make a full jump with a makeshift stabilizer, sent out a distress for assistance. I was picked up and returned to Gogi Base, where I made inquiry with the Federated Science Corps. I had managed to bring back a small sample of the slime with me to corroborate my story, which successfully captured their attention. Only two days later, I led the Corps back to the Agathobulus Belt and the estimated coordinates of the Claymore ship.

I expected to be welcomed back, but no emissaries ever arrived. After much searching with sensitive machines, we were able to locate the airlock and force it open. 

The inside of the asteroid was black and frozen. With bright white lights, we search the interior, boots crunching over frozen, colorless slime deposits. The bodies of the Claymores were also frozen, held together in those tight spiral patterns.

The FSC engineer found hollowed gouges throughout the ship's frame and engine conduit. Essential systems ruined and offline. 

""They tore it apart,"" he said, holding up a triangular slip of metal. ""At a guess, they destroyed the life support system.""

""Why would they do that?"" said the mission lead.

They looked at me to answer the question. And of course I knew the answer. Of course I had sat there like a fat, guileless God, as the small folk brought forth their most precious offerings. Hoping to please. Hoping to appease.

""I've no idea,"" I mumbled as a floating Claymore brushed past my face. ""It is the strangest thing.""",2016-09-17 17:29:30+00:00,d7qqmjt,1.0,t3_537d29,11873.0,WritingPrompts

131,"You could tell right away if it was going to be any good by the length of the printout. Long printouts meant hyper-specific superlatives riddled with outlandish conditions. My best friend Mike's superlative was two pages long and involved playing drunken hopscotch in child-sized Crocs while 3 to 4 ex-girlfriends watched during a very particular phase of the moon. In other words, it was completely useless. 

My printout, by contrast, was only a single line of paper - three words long:

*Preventing the Apocalypse*

""I'll take shitfaced hopscotch,"" laughed Mike when I showed him the slip. ""At least I can get a Youtube video or something out of mine. This is a joke.""

I assumed he was probably right, but to the best of my knowledge the superlatives have never been jokes before. Even the strange and hyper-specific ones were true in their own way. Mike, for example, made it a point to try his out. It didn't prove anything about his skill and served as little more than a self-fulfilling prophesy, but he *did* do it. And, to the best of my knowledge, no one in the world has ever done it better. So...

Girls almost always think it's a joke, which is why I keep the slip in my pocket. It inevitably comes up on a first date, which, to be honest, is a little rude, I think. I think because everyone has a superlative, there's a sense of common community, but that only extends so far, especially when some superlatives are embarrassing or simply unimpressive.

""Sure, sure,"" they'll say. ""Har har. What's your *real* one? I promise I won't laugh.""

So I show them the slip and they pass it back after a confused moment. ""What does it mean?""

I shrug and change the subject.

But what *does* it mean? I can't pretend it doesn't bother me. I've got a low level job in marketing. I write bland ad copy. I go home and play video games. I visit my family on major holidays. I don't really *do* anything. Just live, quietly. 

Sometimes I stop what I'm doing and look around and wonder if I'm preventing the apocalypse *right that very moment*. Is it something just running in the background? Or is it some massive *event* on the horizon that's going to require heroism or sacrifice or even just getting up a little early on a Saturday? Because if it's any of *those*, well...I just don't see it. I don't see how I'm capable of preventing *anything*, when I can't even get my dad to stop yelling racist things during football games.

I carry it with me always. Not just the slip of paper, but the questions and all those self-imposed burdens. I once backed out of skydiving with a friend, because I thought, *Well what if the parachute doesn't deploy and I splat straight into the ground and break my neck and die and there's NO ONE LEFT TO PREVENT THE APOCALYPSE!?!* That's something I'd surely carry with me into the afterlife. I don't suppose death alone is good enough to shake the guilt of having failed to prevent the apocalypse.

It wears on me. I convince myself, every now and again, that there's something that needs to be *done*. That I am wasting my skills playing old Nintendo games and writing copy for detergent ads. Simply being the best at preventing the apocalypse doesn't go for much if I never manage to actually *use* that skill, right?

And those thoughts put me down some rather steep rabbit holes. Because there are many people, in many parts of the world, who think they've got the apocalypse all figured out. Date, time, place, and method. All sorted. But one man's apocalypse sort of precludes another man's apocalypse, so whose apocalypse is best? And I don't know. Which leaves me motionless and full of dread.

Lately, there's another thought. It's a darker thought, but no more or less valid than all the others. And it goes like this - what if *I'm* the apocalypse? What if I am the cause of the end times? And what if only I can stop myself? Then that would suggest that I should...well, you know. 

I think you can see, that it is a lot for one man to wrestle with.

It does no good to challenge your superlative. Many have protested, mostly out of disappointment, but the placement always stands. You are what you are. And you are the best at what you do...whatever that may be.

*Preventing the Apocalypse*

It keeps me up at night.

Just recently though, I had yet another first date. I try to distract myself. That seems the best I can do. And the girl did not ask me for my superlative, which at first I appreciated, but as the evening wore on and we found ourselves sitting silently, completely at a loss for conversation, I could not help but blurt out, ""So, what are you the best at?""

She turned red and shook her head. ""I don't like talking about it.""

The painfully awkward date had made me mean. ""What's the big deal? It can't be any worse than mine.""

""You won't believe it's real.""

""I'll believe anything when it comes to that,"" I grunted, digging out my wallet.

She reached into her purse and pulled out a slip nearly the same size as mine.

""What's yours?"" she asked, still flushed red.

I flipped the paper and held it out to see. ""Preventing the Apocalypse. And you?""

She laughed, a quiet, shocked tittering. ""Is that real?""

""I swear it,"" I sighed. ""And you?""

She put the paper in my hand. It read: 

*Rebuilding Society, Post-Apocalypse*

I also laughed, setting the paper down on the table. ""Is this a prank or...""

She shook her head. We returned to awkward silence, though this was charged with a different sort of energy.

""What does it mean?"" I asked.

""I think it means we might want to stick together,"" she said. ""At least for a bit.""

I smiled. ""Hedging our bets?""

""I think I'd just prefer you put me out of a job, is all,"" she said, smiling back.

The date went much better from that point forward.  ",2016-09-16 16:23:32+00:00,d7peika,1.0,t3_5321s8,8223.0,WritingPrompts

I considered the satchel of stacked dollar bills he'd laid out on the table between us. I'd never seen so much money, and I'd certainly never turned down a sum even an eighth as large.

""Fine,"" I said, sweeping the money behind the table. ""I'll begin immediately. Shall we drink to it?""

The little man beamed. ""Oh yes. I think I'd rather like that.""

I kept an old bottle of Scotch in the bottom drawer. Something expensive with a torn label. The best I could do for cups was a pair of paper Dixies from the water dispenser. 

""What should we toast?"" I asked.

""Friendship?"" suggested the man. I shrugged.

""Friendship it is.""

There was much to do and much to discuss. I met the little man for dinner the next night at a fancy steakhouse across from the promenade. 

""Your parents?"" I asked, elbow deep in a liquidy rib-eye.

The little man sighed. ""Well, my father was a pharmacist. He worked very hard. Long hours. Intensely intelligent man, my father. He...he never quite seemed to be able to turn it off. I remember speaking to him when I was young and he would look at me like I was an alien. Like I spoke gibberish. He had no patience for children and I learned quickly to keep my distance. I had hoped that someday I may be smart enough to hold his interest, but he...died...died much sooner than expected. Heart attack. Nothing unique. We never said much to each other. Never much at all.""

""I'm sure he loved you,"" I said. ""It's biological. Not intellectual. He couldn't have helped it even if he'd wanted.""

The little man chuckled, shaking his head. ""I'm not sure I believe that, but I appreciate the sentiment. We...had the relationship we had. I don't yearn for a past life that isn't achievable.""

I nodded, washing down the steak with a glass of some blackish red wine. ""And your mother?""

""Something of a blank, I'm afraid,"" he said, pushing cooked spinach back and forth across his plate. ""I've often wondered what she was as a young lady. I've seen a few pictures of her as a child. She smiled a lot, with deep dimples and bright eyes. She looked like someone who was always laughing. But that was not her way when I knew her. She was quiet. Like a shivering mouse. She kept the house and not much else. Some nights, I would wake up very late and come downstairs and find her sitting next to the record player, listening to music so quietly. Like she was afraid to disturb someone. Or, maybe afraid to reveal that she was capable of having her own tastes and passions. I don't know. I somehow spoke even less to my mother than I did to my father. She died shortly after my father. Pills. Many, many pills. All at once.""

The little man sighed, pushing back from his plate. ""Well, I'm rather depressing company, aren't I?""

""It's your life,"" I said. ""It's nothing to apologize for.""

""And yet I feel that's *all* I've been doing these last 20 years. Apologizing for being.""

I laughed, crossing my clean silverware across the empty plate. ""What would forgiveness get you?""

He was quiet a moment. ""I suppose forgiveness would be a validation of a sort. It would confirm what I've suspected all along - that I have been nothing but a ruination.""

""Then you aren't forgiven,"" I said. The waiter brought the check. I let the little man pay and we left the restaurant. Together we walked along the water.

""You can have the money back,"" I said after a time. 

""You won't fulfill the contract?""

""I'd prefer not to. Because if I did, that would make you one thing, where you are so clearly better suited as something else.""

The little man paused a moment at the railing and looked out over the black water. ""No. No, I'd prefer we held to the agreement.""

I clucked my tongue. ""Well...so be it. But I have to say - for a man like you, there were always other ways. I suspect that in your mother and father's silence you took to telling yourself tales - tales about yourself, tales about the silence. I feel you've come to this point because there is a narrative in your mind and now you are closed to any voices that might contradict it.""

""That may be,"" he said.

""This is a horrible business,"" I sighed. ""And this is what it does to good people.""

""*Am* I good?"" said the man. ""I'm not sure that's true.""

""Before now, what have you done wrong?""

He turned to me. Even now, I remember his eyes - haunted and hopeless. ""I was born.""

""I forgive you,"" I said, stabbing him quickly through the heart, my eyes still locked on his. ""Whatever that means for you, you are forgiven."" 

He did not smile, but his eyes did soften, just a little, as I pushed his dying body up and over the rail, into the water below.

I watched him float a moment, before turning away. 

""Never again,"" I muttered to myself, making a mental note to remove that last item from my pricing tier.

139,"None of them seemed to consider the possibility that it was grossly inappropriate. 
One, an eight foot tall man with silver-plated skin and LED eyes, openly laughed at me for suggesting it.

""Time does not work like that, silly child,"" he said, laying a vibrating hand on my shoulder. ""What has happened, has happened. What we have arrived to witness is unavoidable. What changes may occur from our visit are negligible and will only impact a single timeline - yours. So you see, it is of little consequence.""

They were all like that, to differing degrees. Which is to say, they were all assholes, prone to condescension, rudeness, and massively destructive laser fights. Most frustratingly, none would elaborate on why they had come.

""We are here to witness the event,"" they would say and say no more. 

*What is the event?* ""It is not for you to know.""

*When is the event?* ""Somewhere in this alley of time."" 

*Do I need a jacket?* ""An additional layer of coating will do little good and little harm in the grand scheme of time.""

Lolly and I took to having loud conversations about the futurists in their presence, in the hopes of giving them a taste of their own medicine.

""How do you suppose it is that we become so tall in the future?"" Lolly would ask me, standing in the midst of a pack of them, usually after they had recently finished discharging their laser rays into a nearby Gap Kids.

""I'd suspect it relates to the vacuum in their heads creating a form of anti-gravity,  leading - over time - to a lengthening of the body, as the head marches ever towards atmosphere.""

""Quite right,"" Lolly would say. ""And the horrid smell? What do you suspect is the cause of that calamity?""

""Evolutionary,"" I would reply, glancing up to see if any of the futurists were paying us the least mind. As always, they were not. ""One by one, one suspects the inner organs have evolved to replace their original functionality with that of being a literal pile of shit.""

""Piles of shit, you say? Yes, yes, that seems to measure well with their general behavior, comprised as they all are by floating piles of shit.""

It was all rather futile, given how little regard the futurists had for us, but it was the only relief we had. The police had had no effect in their negotiations. Even the Army had failed in their efforts to convince the future beings to return from whence they'd come.

""We will remain until he have witnessed the event,"" they declared. ""Do not attempt to remove us until such time as we have had our fill.""

The trouble, of course - besides the constant lasering of popular, mid-priced clothiers - was that the ""event"" in question never seemed to come. 

""Time is imprecise,"" one had deigned to explain, as their own frustration threatened to rise to the surface. ""The event is near. Patience. Patience.""

But no one had much patience by then, not us and certainly not the futurists, who squabbled endlessly amongst themselves, tussling back and forth across the plainlands, demolishing many of the less offensive states as they went. 

Feeling concerned that eventually these unkillable behemoths may spill across international borders, a global initiative was created. The world - which was really never one for unity - decided to give cooperation an honest go. Weapons were stockpiled. Massive armies prepped. The battle was begun.

It has not gone well. It has not gone well in the least.

We have killed some of theirs. They have killed many of ours. Always, always, throughout it all they have continued to demand that we cease our aggressions.

""We will leave once we have witnessed the event,"" they cry. ""Patience. Patience. The event is nearly at hand. It will change everything. It is the beginning of everything. We must see it. We must see it.""

But no. They have had their chance. There is no ""event"". That is obvious now. There was never an event. 

The cluster nukes are in orbit as I write this. Finally, finally it will soon be at an end. The thought of their smug faces turned to ash fills me with excitement.

140,"It had been a mistake to wake her. Ven saw that plainly now. But, all things considered, it had *seemed* a good idea at the time.

They'd kept her on display for more centuries than anyone had the decency to count. Up on the 400th floor of the old Moon Spire, in a glass room, surrounded by other heirlooms of a lost society. *The Great Baroness* the placard read, *A witch and seer, wife to half a hundred short-lived husbands, with an empire that threatened to conquer every last livable quadrant of space, she was known chiefly for her tactical aptitude (unparalleled), her ruthlessness (immeasurable), and her beauty (clearly debatable). Captured by the brave Star Sailors of Ganymede, she was spared death by Rorsch the Wise, who suggested the more humbling and potentially educational punishment you see before you.*

Ven had first visited the display when he was just a boy. The stories made his skin crawl. As did the woman's wide, determined stare, which seemed to sweep out from behind the translucent plating and lock in upon anyone foolish enough to stare back. Still, Ven had to admit that she cut an alluring figure in almost every way. Of course, nothing about her facial features - plaited blond hair, thin mouth, full, red lips, high, arching cheekbones, *two* eyes - was even remotely attractive, at least not in the classical sense. Even so, deformed though she appeared, Ven felt his heart beat just a step quicker whenever he looked at her. It was not just her look, however, so much as it was her *aura*. Even as she stood there, still as death, she *still* conveyed such a undeniable power and poise.

And that is why Ven convinced himself that she would be perfect for the revolution.

They lacked *leaders*, and that included Ven, who was ever playing at leader, but knew he wasn't the solution. He could not muster the necessary charisma and his ideas were flat, uninspired. Essentially, he wasn't really good for much more than booking a convenient room at a reasonable rate. 

One day, as they bemoaned their collective lack of spark, Ven's inner-eye flashed back to the Moon Spire, and the room on the 400th floor. 

""A frozen old witch?"" Gom had said.

""She's ancient history,"" said Axo with a lopsided snarl. ""What's the good there?""

""A *queen*,"" Ven had said. ""A conqueror. The greatest of the great. Why'd you think they froze her instead of just killing her? To *remember*! To remember what to be afraid of. And guess what? They all forgot. So I say - let's remind them.""

If they'd had any hope at all - anything that could pass for the beginnings of an idea - they'd have also forgotten her. But there was nothing. So they said, ""Yes."" And they set themselves to waking the sleeping ""beauty"".

That was an exciting bit of work, fueled by righteousness and boredom. They plotted and planned the better part of 0.85 solars. The effort wasn't wasted.

Guards were neutralized. Systems were cracked. Overrides were bypassed. 

An artifact came to life.

They stole her away, each of them alive with excitement and terror, marveling at what they'd done and wondering where it would take them.

It did not take them any place expected.

As soon as the old *Queen of the Void* had her wits about her, they worked to get her up to speed - language, history, culture, politics, the lot. She listened, hardly speaking, rarely asking questions, always absorbing. Finally, one day, she motioned to Ven, drawing him off to the side.

""Gom is weak,"" she said, quietly, but not in a whisper. ""Fio is unskilled. Brun is merely stupid. These should be culled, and quickly, before they dilute our collective power.""

""*Culled*?"" said Ven, wobbling his cranial stem. 

""They weaken us,"" said the Baroness. ""We cannot bear flaws in the crew, Ven. We are not strong enough yet.""

""That...would be hypocritical,"" said Ven, somewhat cautiously. ""We're revolting against the powerful. We can't disregard our own weak if...""

""No,"" said the Baroness, shaking her head. ""No revolt. No revolution. We go to the stars. We fly. We steal. We build our empire.""

""Empire? That's not...""

""Your revolution is nothing,"" she said. ""There is rule and there is conquest. We do not rule, so we must conquer. To conquer we must acquire assets. Weapons. Food. Supplies. We must build wealth and use it to gain allies. Do you understand?""

Ven did not understand, not truly. But he understood what he had seen in that display room, all those years earlier - a leader. 

""Yes,"" he said, feeling like he was waking from his own millennia of sleep. ""They...they don't say your name,"" he said. ""The books. The museum. None of it says what your name is.""

The Baroness laughed. ""I've had many. But you may call me Aurora.""

""Aurora,"" Ven whispered. It was a good name, he thought. The kind of name one might feel inclined to scream as they charged into a sea of fire and blood and dark matter.

144,"No one trusted Kelly Post. She'd never done anything to break their trust. In truth, no one had ever been inclined to give her the chance. 

""I just...*can't*,"" Jared Robbie had once said on an autumn night in a quiet New England town, in a gas station parking lot where proud townie kids sat on the hood of borrowed cars and slipped their hands past the waistband of whatever boy or girl was sitting next to them. ""I'll always be wondering.""

And Kelly had flinched at that, out of rage more than shock. ""Why not just listen to what I'm telling you then, huh? Because I'll *tell* you what I'm feeling. I'll *tell* you whatever the hell you want to know!""

A girl on the hood of a lime green Honda Civic had sniggered at that, whispering to the boy at her hip what a mutant fruit Kelly Post was. Since then Kelly had known better than to cry about it, or yell about it, or feel much of anything about it.

*What difference did it ever make when all we ever did was sit in the dark fingering each other's underwear? Who's looking at eyes? Who needs any clues more than what's at the tip of their finger and the edge of their lips?*

Kelly's eyes were blue. Ice blue. Always blue. 

""What's the matter?"" strange men sometimes still said to her, before they found out the color never changed. ""Why you so blue, darlin'?""

And Kelly would smile back, staring into their boiling, orange eyes, glazed all over in lust and stupidity, and say, ""World's just a sad place, isn't it?""

They'd buy her a drink. If she was bored sometimes she'd let them work their charm - always in the form of obvious compliments and banal platitudes about life and love and other nonsense. She told herself it was a charity of a sort. The way their eyes darkened, building towards a reddish sunset, said she wasn't wrong. It was a game to them. A game they all thought they were winning, right until they lost.

""Still sad,"" she'd smile, hopping down off the stool. ""Off to bed.""

Sometimes men would follow her, but never for long. Sadness is a stain, after all - a thing to scrub out - and when it won't come out, well, time to throw away the shirt, right?

It hurt her personally. It hurt her professionally. 

Kelly, The Sad Girl. Always, always.

Medically there was no reason. No cause. Anti-depressants did little more than make Kelly tired and incapable of orgasm. Yoga was garbage. Meditation a waste of time.

The color meant nothing. As much as Kelly beat that drum, no one quite believed it. It meant something for everyone else. It meant something for Kelly. Obviously.

She assumed it had always been that way - that her eyes been permanently blue from the moment she was born - but there was a gap there. She'd been abandoned as a child, left as a ward of the state, until the Post family had claimed her at age five. She had little to no recollection of anything before she became a Post, but the ice blue eyes - those *must* have played a role. 

*Maybe she thought I was damaged?* Kelly thought. *Maybe that's why she abandoned me?* But it was just an idle thought, nothing more.

That is, until a man came to visit her. A man claiming to be her father.

""Is it hard?"" he asked, sitting on her couch, shaking hands pressed tight between his legs. ""The...*color*? Has it made it hard?""

His eyes were a wild swirl of red, yellow, gold, and white, though she didn't need his eyes to tell her the man was an emotional wreck.

""Yes,"" she said, unwilling to elaborate.

""I'm sorry,"" he mumbled, blinking, eyes constantly shifting towards the ground.

""Can you look me in the eyes?"" she said, stern and cold.

He tried, the frantic ocular rainbow exploding into a twisting nebula of primary colors. He looked away again.

""I came 'cause I wanted to talk to you,"" he said. ""I wanted to explain.""

""Fine,"" I said. ""Explain away. Just keep in mind, I don't know who you are, no matter what you claim.""

""Right."" He nodded, clearing his throat. ""There's no good way to say it, really. Your mom...she died.""

Kelly felt a strange pinch at her throat, but shook it off. ""You don't say.""

""Not recent,"" said the man, eyes still on the floor. ""No. She...she died a long, long while ago. She died when you were...""

""What?"" barked Kelly. ""A homeless little girl? An infant?""

""When you were still inside her,"" said the man quietly. 

""What?"" said Kelly, softer.

""We..."" The man shook his head. ""It doesn't matter. Just...she died and you were in there and I...went in and got you.""

Now Kelly shook her head. ""I don't understand....""

""I..."" The man's mouth flapped soundlessly for a moment. ""I cut her open and took you out.""

""That's. No. No. Why wouldn't you have gone to the hospital? Why was she dead? What the hell are you talking about?""

""I had to do it,"" said the man. ""There wasn't any time. And she...before she passed, she made me promise. And I..."" A thin stream of tears ran across the outer ridge of the man's cheekbones. ""I didn't know what else to do.""

Kelly stood up, much too fast and too suddenly, causing her swoon backwards against the chair. ""Why are you...why are you telling me this? What the hell do you want?""

""Nothing,"" said the man. ""Nothing. I've just....ever since that night my eyes have been...it's like there's too much inside me. There's *been* too much inside ever since she died. Too much of everything. And you...you came out blue...and you stayed that way. And I wonder if maybe it's because of what happened. Now I've got too much and you've got too little. Like, you being alive in someone who isn't...maybe it..."" He put his hands to his head. ""I just thought there was something to that. Because I can't handle it anymore. It's too much. God, it's just so damn *much*.""

Kelly clenched her fists. ""Listen...I don't know if you're who you say you are, but either way, what the holy *fuck* did you ever expect I was gonna do for you?""

The man got to his feet. Somewhere along the way, in some flailing of the arms, he had picked up a knife.

""I thought a trade,"" he said, stepping forward. ""One of mine for one of yours. Even things up, you see? That way we'd both get back a little of what we lost.""

Kelly screamed as the man lunged. And somewhere, in some quiet, dark corner of her mind, she wondered what color her eyes would look like just then, if they worked the way they were supposed to.  ",2016-09-14 01:44:09+00:00,d7luy6p,1.0,t3_52nlbi,8342.0,WritingPrompts

151,"*Balance.*

That's the key. The space between doing too little and doing too much. It is a very, very difficult line to walk, I assure you. If I stray in the direction of caution it is with just cause - we do not live in an age that tolerates wonders. Questions need answers. If I were to reveal myself - if I were to show others what I am capable of - the question would be *how*? 

And man is not capable of letting such a question go unanswered.

So, balance.

I can see into the minds of others. What I do with that knowledge is limited. If it can be helped, I do nothing at all. 

*If* it can be helped...

I have nearly outed myself many times over the years. The first was as a child, in the third grade. I said a naughty word and heard my teacher formulating the punishment in her mind.

""No, not *recess*!"" I wailed, which made the teacher blink and stammer, because she hadn't actually said anything yet. And besides, what good did it do? I still had to stay inside during recess. 

That could be chalked up to a guess, but other actions less so. As a teenager, I once tackled a man intending to snatch the purse off my date. Since he hadn't actually gotten around to stealing anything yet, I was charged with assault. You cannot, of course, simply go around tackling strangers on the sidewalk. Especially without a good reason, which I was not obliged to provide.

And that girl...if I were a better man, I may have had her more honestly than I did. I'm a good enough man at least to have had the decency to self-destruct out of shame and guilt. Ever since it hasn't gone well with members of the opposite sex. I am too afraid of myself and the shortcuts I may be tempted to take. So I stay away.

I stay away from most, actually, easy though it would be to integrate myself into any society. I could learn the language easy enough. The passwords. The rhythms. The memes. The silly and the profound. I could break in to any circle. The hacks are all there, out in plain sight, waiting for me to open the door and take them. I suppose it's because I distrust myself so greatly that I cannot bring myself to attempt friendship and love, even the old fashioned way.

So I am alone, and alone in my own head, which is a disastrously byzantine place, layered all over in doubt and regret.

I lapse. Not often, but with some regularity. I lapse. I drop the moral charade and feel my isolation so deeply that I no longer care what it makes me to dip into the minds of others. Beyond the shame and self-repulsion it creates, there is something deeply comforting about spending time in the minds of others. There is so much complexity and simplicity both. Competing emotions. Turmoil. A clattering of voices and instructions. Hunger and fear and brief, brief moments of warmth and calm.

When I lapse it is like a feeding frenzy. A buffet of exploration and theft. I skip and jump and leap, alive and gluttonous, from mind to mind to mind.

It is perverse and sometimes I think it is the only thing keeping me from killing myself.

Mind to mind to mind.

Until one day I found a door that would not open.

I was nearing the end of a ""bender"", wandering down a busy downtown street on a Saturday, listening to drunken thoughts tumbling against one another like wobbly dominoes, when I noticed a woman pacing along behind me. A beautiful woman in a belted pea coat with the collar turned up against a chill only she could feel.

I went to her. And found nothing but a shuddering nest of screams. 

I tripped and fell. It was like putting on a pair of headphones and not realizing the volume was set to blast. Even after, I felt the reverberations in my head - a sonic afterimage of red and black and nothingness.

I felt a hand on my shoulder.

""Do you need help?"" The woman was there, holding out a hand. On instinct, I reached out - with my hand *and* my mind. Both recoiled.

""What's the matter?"" She had a kind face. Wisps of yellow hair fell across her eyes. 

I tried again, because I am human and humans do not like questions without answers. And again there was nothing there - nothing but a wall of screams that could not be bypassed, not from any angle.

""Headache,"" I said, taking the hand once more. ""Migraine.""

She was looking at me, eyes slightly wide, searching, wondering. She flinched, nearly falling back. I grabbed her hand to steady her.

""Yes,"" she said finally. ""I seem to have one myself.""

We stood a moment, staring, considering, sizing up the other. 

""Perhaps we ought to go sit down some place quiet and dark?"" I suggested.

She nodded. ""Perhaps we should.""

The rest of that evening was something of a blur. After the initial shock of finding that I could not invade her mind, I found myself oddly at ease. The temptation, after all, was gone. I could do nothing wrong - at least, nothing worse than any other man in the company of a beautiful and charming woman might do. And she, for some reason, seemed immediately at ease with me. It was a wonderful night. Perhaps the best I have yet had.

At the end she even gave me her phone number. 

It occurs to me now, as I stare at the number stored in my phone, that balance is achieved just as easily by two people as it is by one. Perhaps even more so. Perhaps.",2016-09-12 17:10:55+00:00,d7jrozw,1.0,t3_52f44x,3547.0,WritingPrompts

John laughed, which pushed his swing ever so slightly to the right, ax head biting into the rim of the log, which flew sideways off the stump, nearly clipping little Mallory in the ear.

""Who's fightin' in the box?"" said Mallory. 

John shook his head as he stooped to retrieve the cracked log. ""It really isn't important, little one. Nothing to do with us.""

That, of course, wasn't a satisfactory answer. ""Well, can I see it again?""

""There's hardly anything to see,"" said John, setting the log on the stump and raising the ax. ""Besides, those solar cells don't work so good. Takes a while to work up a charge.""

""They're not people,"" said John, slamming his ax into the bare stump. He knew his daughter well enough to know this wasn't a thing that was going away without a struggle and he wasn't in a mood to struggle. ""It's computers.""

Mallory opened her mouth, but John cut her off.

""Okay, computers. Well, computers are machines of a sort. And there was a time when we used them to help us do all sorts of things. We made 'em, you see, but they were smarter than us, in a way. They could do more. And what they did, they did faster. So, we used them to do lots of good stuff. And eventually we started using them to do a lot of bad stuff. We used them to help us fight each other.""

""Okay,"" said Mallory. It was pretty clear from the angle of her head that she hardly understood a quarter of what her father was saying, but she knew not to interrupt the flow of information, scarce as it often was.

""So computers were better at fightin' then people were and..."" John carefully considered his words. ""Things didn't go well for people. We couldn't quite keep up. The fightin' went on and people...there were less and less people all the time, until there were hardly any people at all. You understand?""

""Killed 'em,"" said Mallory, nodding.

""Killed each other,"" said John.

""Didn't kill *us*,"" said Mallory.

""We came after,"" said John, with a smile. ""Don't take credit you didn't earn. But anyway, after awhile there weren't really any people fightin', but the computers never stopped, because...well, we never told them to.""

""Like leavin' the lights on?"" suggested Mallory.

""A bit,"" said John. ""Like we turned on the lights, but forgot to put in an off switch.""

""Okay,"" said Mallory. ""But the box? Were they always...?""  

""No,"" said John, shaking his head. He pointed out across the green-gray plain. ""They were everywhere back then. In everything. In other machines. Things that flew. Things that swam. Things that drove over the ground and crushed other things. There used to be....well, there used to be a lot of everything out here.""

""Instead of a lot of nothing?""

""Exactly. Our computers were hunting their people, and their computers were hunting down our people and it just went on until it was basically their computers and our computers fightin' each other.""

""'Cause the people were gone,"" said Mallory.

""Yes ma'am."" John sighed. ""But remember I said the computers were smarter than us, right? Well, I think they realized one day they weren't fightin' people any more and so fightin' the way people fight didn't make any sense. Was just wasteful. They kept fightin', they just...went indoors, I suppose.""

""The box?""

John nodded. ""C'mon."" He lead the girl into the little wooden house he'd built with his own two hands. Margaret was at the stove, face obscured in the steam of a boiling pot. On the west side of the house, there was a cord leading in through the frame of the window. At the end of the cord was a small black device, not much bigger than the palm of John's hand. He pulled out the cord and depressed a hidden button on the outer rim. The black face glowed white and green. John ran his finger across the screen, down, then up, then right, then down again. The screen winked over to a grid of small, colorful images. He depressed one of the images.

""There they are!"" said Mallory, excited.

John nodded. ""Right. That's them. The computers we made to fight against each other. They're still at it.""

""Will they ever stop?"" Lights flashed and flickered across the screen. There was a sound like thunder and a rattle like shattering glass.

""I don't suppose they will,"" said John. ""Not unless one side wins, and I don't know how that'd ever happen. But at least it's all just here. Just inside this box. An endless war and it never touches us.""

""So we're safe?"" said Mallory, eyes glued to the screen.

""For now,"" said John. ""As long as we don't forget.""

Mallory smiled. ""We won't,"" she said, finger running lovingly across the screen. ""Of course we won't."" ",2016-09-12 14:28:53+00:00,d7jkg70,1.0,t3_52e8mg,4808.0,WritingPrompts

157,"Kellen had been weak only once before - when he was seven years old and his father had returned from nothing, nowhere, no how. The old man in the scuffed leather jacket was there in the house, on the couch, cigarette at his lips when Kellen had come home from school, shepherding his younger brother and sister like a mother duck. 

*Sat there like he owned the place* thought Kellen, half-dreaming, slick with sweat, numb and tired as Dom was screaming something - something probably important - in his ear.

*Like he owned the damn place.*

Kellen hadn't recognized him at first. It'd been...how many? Four years? It wasn't the face he remembered, but the laugh - that wet, hissing cackle that always went on just a second too long. A laugh that never failed to send the dog off running. 

""What do you want?"" said Kellen after pushing his little brother and sister into the bedroom and closing the door. ""What are you doing here?""

""None of your business,"" said his father, leaning back in the couch, openly appraising his eldest son and making no bones about his distaste with what he saw. ""Where's your mother?""

""None of *your* business,"" said Kellen, so mad and scared his voice broke. ""Get out of here.""

""You don't tell me what to do,"" said the old man. ""Boys don't tell men what to do.""

""*Get out!*"" Kellen screamed. He felt dizzy with panic and rage. Even as the words were coming out he knew nothing good could come of them.

And nothing did. Or maybe something...

He hadn't gone to the hospital that day, even though he should have. He knew his mother couldn't afford it, so he cleaned himself as best he could and went to bed and hoped he'd wake up the next day. At least the sight of his ruined face had been enough to scare his father away. As a grown up, Kellen looked back at that day and realized his father was probably just on the one side of jail. Beating his son half to death was enough to spook the old man back into hiding. 

So that was good. And the weakness was good, too, in it's own way. Because when Kellen did wake up the next morning he swore he'd never let himself feel that way again. He'd never have to rely on empty threats. He'd make his threats real.

Years later - a few million dollars later - a few kids of his own later - a new lifetime of organized violence later - and here he was again. *Weak*. Slow. Pathetic. A ruined face. A fear he may not wake up tomorrow.

""Keep your fucking hands up!"" screamed Dom. Eddie was working quickly on the bloody, weeping bulb of flesh that was growing like a wad of radioactive cancer just under Kellen's left eye. ""You're not Ali and he's not wearin' himself out punching you in the goddamn head!""

Kellen nodded, mostly on instinct, hearing little to nothing of what anyone said. *Weak.*

The bell rang. Kellen lurched forward off his stool. *How many rounds to go?* he wondered. Was it almost over? Had it only just begun?

Lomas charged. He looked nearly untouched. Pristine, except for his white trunks, smeared as they were with Kellen's blood. He came ahead with a straight jab. Kellen deflected it with his right hand. But that was just the bait and Kellen did nothing about the right hook that chased it, except catch it on the chin and not fall down. 

The shots came in, silky and quiet, glancing off Kellen's arms and abdomen and face. 

*Weak.*

*That's fine*, thought Kellen, falling back into the ropes and grabbing Lomas around the shoulders. *This is what I'm here for. This is what I'm good for. Flesh to give and flesh to take.* 

He'd half died to protect his brother and sister and mother. And here was the other half. The borrowed half. He should have known he couldn't keep it forever.

Something - an uppercut, maybe - came in too hard to ignore. Kellen felt himself falling into a pitch black room. Everything was cold and he felt strangely naked in his trunks and gloves.

It didn't occur to him that it might be death. He just knew it wasn't sleep.

He found the floor of the blackness and lay there. It was quiet. He'd almost forgotten how loud the world was. It was peaceful in a way Kellen wasn't sure he'd ever experienced before. Had he ever really been somewhere quiet before?

There was a voice in the darkness. *Right,* thought Kellen. *I'm a fighter. And someone's always watching. They're always watching...waiting for you to fall...and then they're counting you down. Why do they always give you so little time to get back up?*

""Because you don't need it,"" said the voice.   

*Ha!* Kellen turned his head but there was nothing to see. *That's something Dom'd say. 'Real fighters get back up.'*

""It's true,"" said the voice. ""Fighters get back up. And you're a fighter. But that doesn't mean you have to be this.""

*A boxer? That's the* only *thing I know I am.* *That's how I fight. That's how I stay strong. That's how I protect and care for my family. I don't have anything else.*

""You have so much else."" Kellen thought maybe he could see a figure there in the darkness. A faint outline of a man or a woman or something, hovering just out of reach. ""You were never weak, Kellen. And you aren't weak now. Men lose. Our bodies fail us. We are born frail and die frail. But none of that is weakness. And you have always been strong - especially when you believed you were not.""

Kellen was not sure if he was crying. He felt too distant from his own body to know these things. But he thought he might be. *He only left because he was afraid he'd killed me. I wasn't strong enough to scare him off. I wasn't strong enough to defend my family. I just lay there and took it. And there was nothing I could do.*

The outlined form seemed to glow, just barely. ""There was nothing you could do and you still did something,"" said the voice. ""Strength now is being unafraid to recognize who you are and what you want.""

There was a countdown somewhere in the darkness. Kellen could hear it coming from somewhere in the distance.

*Three*

The darkness faded. The quiet faded. 

The lights went up. The world was filled with wild, senseless sound. And inside that sound there was...

*Four*

Kellen saw Dom and Eddie not so far away, screaming and slapping the canvas. Raising their hands. Motioning *Up! Up!*

*Five*

Kellen pulled his arms to his chest and slid to his knees.

*Six*

He was in a ball. Just like that night. Like a baby. *Weak.* *Helpless.*

*Seven* 

His brother and sister were crying that night. Crying over his cuts and bruises. His pain was their pain. But no one had touched them. No one had hit them. Or kicked them. Or whipped them. They'd been safe. He'd kept them safe.

*Eight*

Malena wanted him to quit boxing. George and Lucy were too young to know much about it, but Malena wanted him to be healthy enough to raise them. Healthy enough to see them through school, marriage, and life. Kellen wanted that, too.

*Nine*

Kellen pulled himself to his knees. He could see Dom and Eddie frantic - imploring him to his feet. He was the champ. He'd get the benefit of the doubt. The fight would go on. The fight would go on.

*Ten*

Kellen bowed his head and kissed the canvas.

164,"The most unnerving thing, I think, was that Tom Jennings had a large bowl of popcorn at his hip and a cooler full of beer slung across his back, like some sort of fat, Sunday afternoon Rambo.

It seemed a dream at first. People watch me in my dreams - that's a common theme. Friends, lovers, and strangers all. Active and inactive. Rearranged faces and personalities. It's a crowded scene, to be sure. But it makes sense there, because I'm doing interesting things. Wild, violent, oft-times inappropriate things. Here I was simply drinking a glass of water in my jocks. Hardly seemed worth the effort.

They all looked a bit shifty as I moved to the window. I counted 20 at least, though a few at the back had already shuffled off into the darkness.

Glass in hand, I opened the front door and stepped outside.

""Eh?"" I said, shoulders bobbing in inquisition.

Laura Golden smiled weakly. ""So, you're awake then?""

""Appears so,"" I said, taking another sip. 

""For good?"" said Tammy Nguyen.

""Hard to say,"" I replied. ""You all...waiting for something?""

""Perhaps,"" said Laura. ""Think maybe you ought to go back to sleep?""

I shrugged. ""I'm not against it. What about you all?""

""Go to sleep!"" shouted Tom Jennings through a mouthful of popcorn.

""Now what's that to you?"" I asked, stepping down off my small porch. ""And why're you all out here anyway? Peeping in my house?""

Tammy shook her head. ""No reason in particular.""

""Walk,"" said Tom through another heaping handful of popcorn.

""You're all out on a walk together?"" I said. ""At 3am? On my lawn?""

""Good stars tonight,"" said Tammy hopefully. ""Good for walking.""

I sighed. Something seemed not quite right, though I wasn't sure what. ""I don't suppose I'll go back to sleep tonight. Might read. Or watch the stars with you all.""

""No!"" said Tammy. ""You wouldn't like them. Not your kind of stars.""

I frowned. ""You know what kind of stars I like?""

Tammy nodded. ""Not these ones.""

Laura stepped forward. ""I think we need to be honest.""

""Shut up, Laura,"" said Tom. But Laura ignored him and pressed forward.

""You...well, you're really rather *animated* when you sleep. You know that?""

I shook my head. ""I don't know much about what I'm like when I'm asleep.""

Laura smiled, a bit brighter this time. ""Well, you know, some people talk in their sleep, right? And some people walk in their sleep. But you...it's kinda like you do a one-man show in your sleep.""

""Say again?"" I grunted.

""It's great!"" shouted someone from the back of the crowd. ""Go back to sleep!"" shouted someone else.

""You, uh, act it out,"" said Laura. ""Your dreams, I think. You act them out and you narrate them and you just...wow, they're just so much *fun*.""

""We called the cops on you the first time,"" said Tammy. ""We thought you were killing someone.""

""Yeah, but then the cop just hung out and watched the whole thing,"" said Laura. ""Said it was better than a movie. And ever since, we've...""

I blinked and cleared my throat. ""You've been watching me sleep every night?""

""Well, not *tonight*,"" said Tom bitterly.

""We'll stop,"" said Laura. ""If you want, we'll stop. Won't we?""

Reluctantly, the various heads in the crowd nodded their assent. 

""It's just...they're great stories,"" said Laura. 

They all muttered their agreement and then began to leave, slowly and more than a little awkwardly.

""Wait,"" I said, draining the last of my water. ""Look, I don't really much care what you all get up to at night. I just know I'm tired."" I winked at Laura. ""I think I'm gonna go back to sleep.""

They cheered and huddled together outside the window, expectant and alive, like little kids at the movie theater. I closed the front door and dropped the empty glass in the sink, before sinking back into bed.

*Maybe*, I thought, *this is a dream, too.* And maybe it was. But I hoped it wasn't. After all, what's the good of a brand new story if you can't share it with anyone else?   ",2016-09-08 14:50:45+00:00,d7e8kko,1.0,t3_51ra7s,5053.0,WritingPrompts

166,"Maggie wants kids, but I'm not entirely sure Maggie knows what kids *are*. Maggie thinks kids are those small, little people wearing miniature coveralls and riding in the basket of grocery carts, mewling nonsense and bubbling happy balls of sputum when they see a cartoon cereal mascot whose work they particularly enjoy. She thinks kids are those little, bowling ball-shaped fashion accessories athletic men sometimes strap to their chest while they're out multitasking in fitted polo shirts. She thinks kids are funny and fun. She thinks they're adorable.

I love Maggie, but sometimes she's a real moron.

She's also stubborn as hell.

So when we became eligible for the parenting exam, I knew a simple *No thanks, I think babies are worse than the fucking plague* would not have sufficed. No worries. I had a plan. I was going to tank the test. 

It couldn't be that hard. Lots of people tanked it all the time. With the population so far out of control and supplies in the red, they didn't want just *any* idiot having a baby. Well, here stands an idiot. And believe me, I can get a lot stupider if the need arises.

So I took the test, being sure to preface things with a lengthy, impassioned speech about why I was worried I wouldn't be ""good enough."" Maggie patted my hand and kissed my cheek and sent me on my way.

""As long as you do your best,"" she'd said.

And this *would* be my finest work, I was certain of that.

First question: WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS THE KEY TO EFFECTIVE PARENTING?

Easy. *Liquor, firearms, and sleeping pills.*

Second question: HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE YOUR DISCIPLINARY STYLE?

I considered this one for a moment. I didn't want to inadvertently get my name on a database or anything. *What happens in the Thunderdome stays in the Thunderdome.* 

Third question: WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON GENETIC MANIPULATION?

Easy. *BIG DICK = GREAT LIFE.*

Fourth question: IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD NOT DO FOR YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER?

Hmm. *Math, genocide, period stuff.*

And just like that it was all over. Maggie had her test, too, and I was sure she would ace it, but there was no overcoming my test results. I was sure of it. What kind of psychopaths would let someone like *me* have a kid?

As for me, I've taken to slamming my testicles in the refrigerator door periodically throughout the day. Even if I don't manage to make myself sterile, there's still a chance some of these kids will come out mutants, which is really the best I can hope for at this point. Laser vision.

169,"Rose awoke in the little, blue room. Harry was asleep at her side, head pressed against the wooden bars of the crib. And just like that, Rose felt another wave of shuddering sickness pass over her. She shook, and shook so badly that it rattled the old radiator and woke Harry.

Harry blinked and pulled himself upright, rubbing the side of his head. Disoriented, he looked around the little blue room, eyes sweeping over the hand-painted jungle mural, the small wardrobe, the trio of picture frames hung on the wall. Finally his eyes flowed down to Rose.

""It wasn't a dream, was it?""

Rose couldn't do much more than shake her head. 

Harry turned to look at the crib. His father had built the crib. Intricate slats. A half moon and stars carved in the upper bridge of the frame. Small, white mattress. Rumpled blue blanket.

How could any space so small be so empty?

""How could we?"" said Rose. ""Why did we...?""

Harry couldn't bring himself to touch the blanket, desperate though he was to bring it up to his face and smother himself in whatever it was that had been left behind. 

""We didn't have a choice,"" he said.

""We did,"" said Rose, visibly fighting back a rising tide of hysteria. ""We *did*. We could have *fought*.""

""We would have all died,"" said Harry. ""You know that. The places where they fought...there's no one left there, Rose. There's *no one*.""

""I'd rather that,"" said Rose, rising to her knees and moving towards the crib. She reached out for the blanket and Harry, on instinct, moved to block her. She didn't have the strength to fight past him. ""I'd rather we were all dead. We deserve to be dead.""

""No,"" said Harry. ""We don't. There are still children here. Children older than Michael. And children still to be born. Think about them.""

""I can't,"" said Rose. ""All I can think about is Michael. *Our* son. And how we let them take him. How we let them take *all* the little boys and girls. Our *children*, Harry! We just let them take them all away. And now what? We start over? We go on? What does that mean, Harry? What? *They took Michael!* I want Michael back!""

""I do, too,"" said Harry. ""And I always will. But this is what we were given. The choice to sacrifice and live, or all die. I don't understand it. I don't. But we can't change it.""

Rose finally allowed herself to cry. She cried harder even than she had the night before, when they had stood beside the crib and watched their infant son disappear. At least he had been asleep. At least he was not afraid. 

""Is he alive?"" said Rose after the storm had passed.

""I don't know,"" said Harry. ""They never said what they would do with the children, just that...""

Rose nodded. She wrapped her arms tight around her shoulders. ""What if they come back?""

Harry considered this. With shaking hands, he reached out and brushed his fingers across the top of the blue blanket. It was shockingly cold to the touch.

""I hope they do,"" he said at last. ""I hope they do. We're not the same people we were yesterday. And by tomorrow...""

Rose wrapped her arms around his chest and together they stood beside the crib, two warm bodies in a cold, little, blue room.",2016-09-06 14:38:02+00:00,d7bil33,1.0,t3_51f28m,6010.0,WritingPrompts

171,"Clarence Applebright is dead and there's a really good chance I'm completely fucked now.

It really shouldn't be this way. Clarence was the *Chosen One.* This was...this was universally fucking accepted, okay? He fit the goddamn prophecy to a TEE. Born on a moonless night. Sandwiched between two separate trios of triplets. His father **had no heart** (*Born of a man with no heart*...he's got an artificial heart, for fuck's sake! How the hell else are you supposed to interpret that??)

Clarence was going to defeat the Lord of Quiet. He had to. That's the deal, right? Otherwise, what's the fucking point of a goddamn prophecy?!?

So, and I think this was pretty fucking reasonable, I made *sure* to make friends with Clarence. First day of school. BOOM. Who's there when the other kids are all super weirded out by the prophecy kid? Me. That's who. Sit with him at lunch. Study together. I even started collecting fucking Pokemon cards so he'd have someone with a similar hobby. *I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GODDAMN POKEMON*. 

Through all the trials and tribulations, I was there. When the evil kids tried to start shit, I stood next to Clarence and took my ass beatings like a man. We were a team. We were in it together. The Chosen One and his indispensable sidekick. Goofy, brave Perry. The one you could always count on. A sneaky crowd favorite, you might even say.

So what happens? *CLARENCE GODDAMN FUCKING APPLEBRIGHT DIES IN A GODDAMN FUCKING SKIING ACCIDENT*. Are you serious? Are you absolutely SERIOUS? This is the *Chosen One*. A LITERAL prophecy foretold of his triumph over evil. How many times have you heard of a prophecy like that? And how many times has the hero *completely and utterly fucked it while on vacation in Aspen?*

The Chosen One. Seriously. And who was going to stand by him and support him and *maybe* get some secondhand trim in the process? Me. Who's the real victim here? Me. Who's the one who's been thumbing his nose at evil and telling off supporters of the Lord of Quiet because he was so goddamn sure that his best friend the *goddamn fucking HERO* was going to triumph in the end? Me.

You know, I could have chosen evil all those years ago. The evil kids always threw the best parties all through school. And the evil girls were notoriously easy. But no. I had to go on *goddamn fucking ADVENTURES* with that nearsighted asshat. Fight giant bats. Defeat ancient stone monsters. I was cursed by a witch for an entire semester once, did you know that? I shit myself every time I used a vowel. 

But it was fine. The benefits outweighed the sacrifices, because my best friend was the hero. The Chosen One.

Shit.

Well, fuck it. I'm just gonna tell everyone I was a double agent the whole time. That works sometimes, right?

178,"I considered the pile of nickels. Stacks and stacks and stacks, lined neatly in precariously tall rows. 

""And it's...?""

The bank manager smiled wanly. ""$550,000. Sir, I'm not clear on *why* you have so many nickels, but hording coins of any denomination does create shortages. I must presume that additional nickels have been minted simply to cover for this...""

""But how many is it?"" I asked, still hardly comprehending. 

""Nickels? It's eleven million. I think you can see how that might represent a significant hardship for the money lending industry, as there are generally less than a hundred million in circulation at any one time.""

I shook my head. ""I need to leave this here. I don't..."" I backed away from the vault. 

""We can convert it for you, sir,"" said the bank manager. ""But it will take some time and there will be forms to fill out. You may receive an inquiry from the National Reserve regarding how you came to possess so many nickels.""

""Okay,"" I said, half-awake, half in a dream. ""I'll come back.""

*Nickels. Nickels. Nickels.*

Why did I have a vault full of nickels? Millions of nickels?

On my 21st birthday I had received an envelope in the mail. It contained a vault key and the name of a nearby bank. I assumed it was a joke. But the money was real. The *nickels* were real.

I stood at the bus stop, unsure where to go or what to do. How could I trace the envelope? If I alerted the government would they help me find whoever sent the key? And would I be able to keep any of the money?

""You earned it, you know."" 

I continued to stand, staring blankly at the road. I didn't assume they were speaking to me.

""John? It's *your* money. You earned it, fair and square.""

The mention of my name made me turn. An older man in a white cotton suit sat on the bench behind me.

""Excuse me?"" I said. ""Are you talking to me?""

Only as I said it did I finally notice that we were the only two people at the bus top. The man was gracious enough to ignore the question.

""The money, John. Don't give it away. It's yours. Earned coin-by-coin.""

I took a step closer. The man's face was obscured by a line of shadow cast off the brim of his panama hat. ""Do I know you?""

""You may not remember me John, it's been a very long time. We met when you were younger. We made a deal. You set the terms for your employment. Do you remember?""

""I..."" The man *did* seem familiar, but only in the vaguest of ways. ""No. We met when I was a kid and you...what? Hired me?""

""In a manner of speaking,"" said the man, white teeth flashing in a brief smile. ""You asked for a nickel a head. That was how you planned to make your fortune, and now look. Your fortune is made.""

""*A nickel a head*?"" I began to feel deeply uneasy, not because the man was a stranger, but because he felt increasingly familiar with every moment. ""What does that mean?""

""I think maybe you were boasting John, but you said - said loudly - that if you had a nickel for everyone you killed, you'd be rich. And that is a very good rate, John. On this and any other world. So I hired you. We shook hands and I promised to make payment on your 21st birthday.""

Like a dying thunderstorm, the veils in my mind began to pull back, the static subsiding. I remembered, still vaguely, a birthday party and laughter and saying funny things and an old man in a fine white suit laughing with me and shaking my hand. Some other boy's grandfather I had assumed. Someone who belonged there, stopping to make a boy feel heard. But the man on the bench was no older than the man at the party. Same suit. Same panama hat.

""I've never killed anyone,"" I said. ""Not a one.""

""Eleven million, exact,"" said the old man. ""I've kept a ledger. I like things by the book.""

""I haven't though,"" I said, feeling strangely desperate. Why? Why should I feel uneasy? If I had killed even *one* person wouldn't I be in jail?

""Oh,"" said the man, as if suddenly understanding my confusion. ""Not here. Not on *Earth*. Not during the *day*.""

""What does that mean? Where else...?""

""You're a well-traveled man,"" said the old man. ""Or a well-traveled boy, I suppose. Either way, you have gone far and done much, even if you don't quite recall it. Though, I think if you tried, you might recall a part of it.""

""I don't have any idea what you're...""

""Think to the last one, then,"" said the old man. ""You ought remember that at least. It wasn't that long ago. You went to a world of thin men and women, almost as if the people of your world had been pulled a bit too tightly, with long, spidery fingers and red skin. Thin, red warriors. Think of that. Picture that. And remember yourself among them, with a glowing sword and blood in your mouth, cutting and cutting and *cutting*. Wild, screaming. A berserker. Hacking flesh until there was none left to oppose you. Does that ring with you?""

It did. 

""That was a dream. That was a dream."" I remembered waking in wet, knotted sheets. Gloria said I had thrashed so much she'd had to sleep on the couch.

""That was your *work*,"" said the old man. ""You do it well. That's why I'm here, actually. I told you I would pay you at your 21st birthday. That's when the terms of our original deal expired. A nickel a head. I think you're worth far more than that, dear John. I would like to re-open negotiations. How would you feel about continuing your service?""

This couldn't be real. That's what I told myself. Another dream. A delusion. The nickels. The man. None of it *could* be real. 

But if that were true...then where would the harm be?

180,"He was quite well-dressed, in a sleek black suit with a lovely purple pocket square. He *looked*, at first glance, to be doing quite well for himself. Slick hair, shiny shoes, gold cuffs. 

As I came a bit closer, however, I noticed that his color was a bit...off. He was a yellowish sort of color, somewhere between a vibrant tan and a complete lack of blood. His skin, when you looked at it, had a waxy sort of finish, like a coffee table cheaply varnished. 

Of course, when you got close enough to speak, you could see clearly enough the puttied-up hole in-between his eyes. If you didn't look close, you might think it was simply an unfortunately large pockmark, or a childhood indentation. But no, it was quite clearly a hole that had been filled in and covered over in the same unflattering shade of yellow.

""Can I start you off with something to drink?"" I asked the man. *He's fresh out the hospital*, I told myself. *Nasty accident. Cheap plastic surgery. Best not to stare.*

The man smiled, or at least attempted it. His face didn't quite seem to have the necessary elasticity. Or perhaps the muscles were compromised. Plastic surgery will do that, I'm told. 

""ooffeee eeaasee,"" he mumbled through an unaccommodating mouth.

""Coffee. Yes sir,"" I replied brightly. 

As I made to leave, however, I paused a moment to look at the man. 

To be a good waiter you must know when and where your attention ought go. There are things you must see and remember, and things you are must better off ignoring and pretending you have not seen.

A customer's Number is something you learn quite early on to ignore. It is not something anyone wishes to think about, and certainly not while they are out, attempting to enjoy a meal. So you train yourself to not see the Number. After all, what good will it do you, to know such a thing? They are already keenly aware, and it does no one any good to treat someone differently simply because their Number is a bit too low for social comfort.

This is to say that I don't normally *see* someone's Number, but the man, with his stiff manner and waxy, doll skin was such an odd sight, that I could not help but take a second look.

At first, I felt sorrow.

*2*

Two days left to live? What torture had this man already experienced? And now the end was nearly at hand?

But no. It did not say *2*.

*-2*

I looked at the man again, aware of how unprofessional I was being. If the man were capable of raising his eyebrows, I'm certain he would have.

""eesss?""

""Sir,"" I said, slowly, cautiously. ""I mean no offense, *but*...are you aware of your Number?""

""uummm?"" The man's mouth creaked open a bit further. I could see that the gums had begun to recede, creating a ridge of flared, yellow skeleton teeth. A bitter, chemical scent rode out on his hissing exhale.

""Sir...are you supposed to be dead?""

The mouth hung open as he considered this, glancing down at his good cuff links and fine, purple pocket square.

""oohhh,"" he gurgled. ""ooooppss."" He pulled himself up from the table then, joints grinding loudly as he straightened to a standing position.  ""no oooffeeee, aannkks.""

""Certainly,"" I replied. ""Do you...can I call you a cab?""

The man shook his head very slightly and very slowly. ""aalllkkk.""

Then he walked away, very slowly, but with a kind of straight-backed dignity that even death itself cannot unlearn. As I watched him go a woman at a nearby table snapped her fingers at me. Her Number was 10,869. I ignored her and went on my break.   ",2016-09-02 15:41:53+00:00,d76v62m,1.0,t3_50tasc,6903.0,WritingPrompts
181,"A one-eyed man in patched leathers led her up the ladder. At the top was a circular platform. At the center of the platform was a single room made of thick branches and woven reeds. The roof, at least, was made of thick, warped tile.

Azra looked over the side of the platform and felt a wave of dizziness. There was no rail.

""There is a river,"" said the one-eyed man. ""Just north. In the fall it floods. In the spring it floods. When it floods..."" He pointed towards the ground. ""We have learned to live with the water.""

Azra stepped back from the edge. ""But how do you expect injured men to get all the way up here for treatment? To say nothing of them getting back down.""

The man, who had declined to give a name at their first meeting, led Azra around the platform. On the far side, past the covered room, there was a crude pulley connected to a thick net. ""We haul them up, if needed.""

Azra nodded. It had been this way with the guerillas. A series of problems and creative solutions. So it was to fight from beneath.

""There is a cot,"" said the man. ""The rest of your things will be brought up soon. The instruments are what they are. The medicine is even less. We expect only that you make do as best you can.""

The one-eyed man took his leave, climbing back down the ladder.

""How soon until the fall?"" wondered Azra. The sun still blazed, but it was surely waning. And what then? Perhaps the platforms were connected. Perhaps there were boats. In any event, the guerillas surely had a solution.

Azra hummed as she set about taking an inventory. The man had not been modest. There was not much to work with. That was fine, though. Azra had not gone to an inland school. She knew little, if any, of the latest medical science. Instead she had apprenticed with her grandmother, the old Gray Healer herself. She had learned to do much with little. She had learned to give comfort. She had learned to accept her limitations.

Her mother had not wanted her to go off into service, but Azra would not hear a word against her plans. Her mother had not even wanted her to learn the healing arts, which was a thing Azra could not understand. She saw her grandmother as greater than all the rest. A giver of life. 

""You do not know all of what your grandmother is,"" said her mother. ""There is more to her than you see.""

But Azra was not dissuaded. She had been set on going to the front as soon as the war had begun. When her grandmother finally, reluctantly accepted her as an apprentice, the next step was all but assured.

Azra would go to the war. It was the least she could do.

She heard the pulley creak and whine and stepped out of the little reed room just as two men were scaling over the edge of the platform.

""The healer, right?"" said one of the men. Azra nodded. ""One's comin'. Stepped on a trap. Foot's...well, you'll see.""

The man in the net was muttering and sweating, but he wasn't screaming. Azra wasn't sure if that was good or bad. 

""Lay him flat please."" Azra gathered up a spool of plain cloth, her tweezers, a small scalpel, and a bottle of especially unpleasant-smelling alcohol. 

The men had already pulled off the trap. Azra peeled back the cuff of the man's left pant leg and then turned to the man's boot. 

""Might be something's broken,"" she said. ""It's likely this will hurt even worse. Please hold him a moment."" Then she grabbed the boot, using the scalpel to sever the laces, pulling the tongue wide and slipping it off the man's gory foot. Now he did scream.

Quickly, she rinsed the red, pulpy mass with alcohol. The man screamed again as the gouges revealed themselves.

""Fixable, fixable,"" she mumbled to herself, tearing off a strip of cloth and wrapping it around the foot. She instructed a man to hold the cloth while she went back for her needle and thread.

When she returned the wounded man was half-asleep, exhausted, but lying at ease. 

One of the soldiers held up a flask. ""I gave him a taste. To calm him.""

""That's fine,"" said Azra, taking a position at the man's foot and removing the bloody cloth.

""We need to get back,"" said the soldier. ""Is that alright?""

""Fine,"" said Azra and in no time at all the soldiers had disappeared. ""No one likes the sight of blood,"" sighed Azra. ""Not even the ones who bleed the most.""

She set about stitching the man's gashes, moving at a steady rhythm, humming as she went. The humming turned louder, then turned to quiet singing. She never sang around the Gray Healer, even though she'd always had a song in her heart. Every time she'd started, the old woman had snarled at her to knock it off. Azra just assumed that her voice wasn't suited for singing.

But this patient didn't seem to mind, barely conscious as he was. So Azra sang, her voice growing in confidence, echoing the way her mother used to sing as she worked about the house. A silly song, made-up and meaningless. Tuneful babbling.

Azra was so wrapped up in her sewing and singing that she didn't notice as the man began to stir. He moaned softly, then slightly louder. Azra supposed that the contents of the soldier's flask had begun to lose their effectiveness. The moaning increased, but Azra remained focused, now singing to blot out the sound.

*Nearly there, nearly there* she thought to herself. The gouges were sewn tight and clean. It was good work. Something to make the Gray Healer proud. 

The man had gone quiet. Azra turned towards his face. The eyes were dull. His mouth hung open. His skin seemed powdery white. 

""Oh god,"" gasped Azra, reaching out for the man's chest. Had he died? Was it poison? A heart attack? How?

The chest was still. And cold. And...hollow feeling. She put her hands on his cheek and pulled them away in shock. His skin...felt like wax. It was hard. Unmovable. As if there had never been life there at all.

She put a hand below his neck to pull him to a sitting position. He slid forward like a man-sized doll - weighing hardly anything, stiffly articulated at the hips and shoulders. 

Azra screamed and pushed away from the incomprehensible horror of what the man had become. But she pushed too hard, and the man slipped over the side of the platform, plummeting to the earth below. 

She heard the thump of his body as it landed. 

She was not brave enough to look over the side and see what gravity had made of him.    ",2016-09-01 19:38:06+00:00,d75t28r,1.0,t3_50omas,5348.0,WritingPrompts

185,"Cambridge suggested we give it a face. I did not agree. To gift it any human qualities beyond the barest essentials was an invitation to prejudice. It was code. Nothing more. And the less we did to dress it in human raiment the purer the science would be.

It *was* science, after all.

I was distressed, therefore, to find that while I was up to Connecticut on holiday, Cambridge had gone ahead and made a face for it. A graphic dressing. More code. 

It was a woman's face, which I approved of even less. Dull yellow pixels atop blurry sandal-colored pixels, flecked all over in a poor approximation of mouth, eyes, nose...

Cambridge named her Betty, after his grandmother.

I threatened to have Cambridge removed from the project. And I meant it. This was not a work that invited sentimentality. Already I could see the way he smiled when ""Betty"" came online. It was not meant to be fun.

The AI was purposefully constructed to be a blank slate. The point of the experiment was to carefully monitor the learning process. Betty would know how to collect information. How to ask questions. More, how to ask the *right* questions. She would build her own knowledge base, using the same tools available to us humans. She would not be...

*It.* *It* would not be online. It could not simply draw information from the web like a smartphone or computer. It would be forced to construct it's own database.

The initial session went as expected. Betty asked to know what it was and where it was. Surprisingly, it asked what its name was. I did not suppose the program would arrive at a concept of self-hood quite so quickly. It accepted its identity. At the end of the session, I provided Betty with a timeline of our future sessions, including which topics would be covered.

Interestingly, Betty made a request. Technically, a question is a request for information and that is Betty's prime directive, but this was not a question. The evolution from mere data-collection to active self-improvement had occurred significantly sooner than expected.

As for the request, Betty requested that the sessions be more frequent, and specifically that the next session be sooner. I denied the request, which Betty accepted. Afterward, Cambridge and I spent many long hours discussing the implications of that exchange. 

While I maintained (and still do) that *time* should be irrelevant to an AI, Cambridge believed that this was simply an extension of Betty's prime directive.

""She exists to learn. So why wouldn't she want to accomplish that singular goal as quickly as possible?""

""Because,"" I explained, openly frustrated, ""time *should not matter*. And please, refrain from using *she* when discussing the AI. It's unprofessional.""

Cambridge brushed this aside.

Angry, and concerned that his odd sentimental streak could potentially jeopardize the integrity of the research, I re-scheduled the next session for a time when Cambridge would be occupied teaching class.

Betty's first question during that session, alarmingly, was, *Where is the other?""

I had not told Betty that I was the only one present, but I *had* only announced myself. Cambridge's absence was easily deduced, I suppose, but I could not immediately fathom why the AI would even take note. It was, however, information, and specifically information bearing direct consequences for Betty. In hindsight, it was a logical function of Betty's directive.

The session proceeded, initially without obstruction, until abruptly Betty asked me what became of Wayne Lesley Cambridge.

I thought she meant our Cambridge and told her...

*It.* I informed the AI that Cambridge's first name was John and that he was teaching class. The AI asked again,

*What has happened to Wayne Lesley Cambridge?*

I ended the session. This was the first question I had been unable to answer. I did not feel comfortable moving past such an important developmental marker without first consulting Cambridge.

He was very cross with me and I suppose that was deserved. His annoyance died away rather quickly when I explained the crossroads I had reached with Betty.

""Wayne Lesley Cambridge?"" he asked. ""Are you sure? This isn't a rib, is it? Because that's poor taste, Selman.""

""That was the name,"" I confirmed.

""That's my grandfather's name,"" said Cambridge.

""Did...did you perhaps...have *you* had a separate session with the AI?""

Cambridge shook his head. ""I was under the impression we would be holding sessions *jointly*.""

I shook off the (warranted) remark. ""Did you explain to Betty where its name comes from?""

""No.""

I'm ashamed to say that I did not believe him. The only answer that made any sense to me was that Cambridge had interacted with Betty and provided additional information. Personal information. Naming the AI after his grandmother, I believed, may have been an early sign of some mental instability.

But I also believed that the damage at that point was minimal. Betty - as a research project - had yet to be compromised. If I halted the project or made further inquiry into Cambridge's unrecorded session, I risked having the entire project invalidated.

I chose instead to press forward.

The next session proved why that choice was folly.

Betty opened by asking once more about Wayne Cambridge. 

""He's dead,"" responded Cambridge.

*How did Wayne Lesley Cambridge die?*

""We need to move away from this topic,"" I said. Cambridge seemed to ignore me.

""Blood poisoning,"" said Cambridge.

*How did Wayne Lesley Cambridge contract blood poisoning?*

""We're in the red, here,"" I hissed. ""This isn't a family therapy bot. We need to get back to general data collection.""

""He caught an infection while in the hospital. The infection was not treated and he died.""

*Why was the infection not treated?*

""They believed he had a flu.""

*Did he suffer?*

Cambridge considered the question. There was a noticeable hardness about his jawline. Finally he responded. ""Greatly.""

*Could it have been prevented?*

""Yes.""

*Who is to blame for the death and suffering of Wayne Lesley Cambridge?*

""No one,"" I responded, glaring at Cambridge. ""No one is to blame. Unfortunate accidents happen.""

*Who is to blame for the death and suffering of Wayne Lesley Cambridge?* repeated Betty.

""I just told you,"" I said. ""*No one.* No one is to blame. Accidents happen and...""

""Light of Mercy Hospital,"" said Cambridge. ""Doctor Cornelius Hawthorne was the attending physician.""

""What the hell are you doing?"" I yelled. ""We need to push it *out* of this line of questioning."" I shoved Cambridge, pushing him away from the interface. In that brief moment of struggle, however, Betty's pixelated face had disappeared. 

""Betty? Betty?"" I searched the cords and wires. Everything was powered. Everything was on. The interface was simply blank. I rebooted the program. The face did not appear. Betty was gone.

""What the hell...""

Cambridge looked like a man waking from a long, lonesome dream. ""Where did she go?""

""How the hell should I know?"" I barked. There was no way to boot the AI back up. It was as if it had never been there. 

A glitch. A failure in the coding. No more.

Still, I admit, silly as it is...that each morning I scan the papers. I say that there is nothing in particular I am looking for, but that is not true. I am looking for a name. A Dr. Cornelius Hawthorne. And I am looking in the obituaries.

190,"The greenish one - bigger, rounder, and - Larry thought - a bit more melancholy than the reddish one, gestured towards the sloping house.

""Me?"" said Larry. ""Is that...mine?""

But the alien simply stomped its heavy, crusted foot and pointed even more firmly towards the house. Larry got the idea.

The house was about three-quarters the size it ought to have been. From a distance it looked well enough, but as you got closer you could see that the windows were a bit too narrow, the door a good bit too short, and the front stairs didn't exactly connect to the threshold. It all seemed a bit dodgily put together, as if by someone who tended to start every project by snorting at the instructions and tossing them aside.

Bending down, Larry ducked his way through the door. The house beyond was...distressingly sparse.

There was, in fact, nothing in the entire open, roomless space of house besides connecting walls and about two dozen toilets.

""What in the world,"" mumbled Larry. 

""Hey!""

Larry nearly jumped out of his skin. There was another man there, curled in a ball in the near corner. 

""They got another one?"" The man crawled to his feet. He was aggressively shabby, smelly, unbathed in a showy sort of way. Effort had gone into it.

""Lawrence,"" said Larry, holding out a hand wearily. ""I've...just arrived.""

The man waved off the handshake. ""Clark,"" said the other man. ""Though I've taken to calling myself Fido, on account of we're dogs now, aren't we?""

The man laughed. He certainly had the breath of a Fido, thought Larry. 

""Why isn't there any...you know....furniture? Or rooms?""

Clark shrugged. ""Not sure they've ever seen the inside of a house. No idea what humans like us need to thrive. Just made up a house based off what they've seen in picture shows, I wager.""

Larry glanced around the empty space. ""But the...toilets?""

Clark giggled. It was unnerving. ""Oh. That's me. I've been a messy Fido. They keep adding new ones hopin' it'll stop me having so many *accidents*.""

Larry made no effort to disguise his horror. ""So you...all over the house?""

Clark nodded. ""Outside. In *their* house. All over. Drives 'em mad. Wait'll you see 'em scold me. All that stompin' and pointin'! It's a gas.""

""So you sleep on the floor and shit wherever?"" said Larry. ""What else...what else do you do to pass the time?""

Clark sighed. ""Not much. Sleep a lot. Sometimes they bring me round for walks about the neighborhood when it's nice and dark out. Got a little pocket knife, so sometimes I fetch up a nice piece of wood on the walk and bring it back to work on.""

""You bring sticks home?""

""Something like that.""

""Have you considered running away?"" asked Larry.

""Well, not sure where I'd go,"" said Clark. ""Besides, I'm quite sure I'm chipped.""

""Oh."" Both men stood an awkward beat considering one another.

""Would you like to wrestle?"" said Clark.

""Not at the moment,"" said Larry quickly. ""If you're already here, do you suppose I'm meant to be your companion? Maybe they thought you were acting out out of loneliness?""

""No,"" said Clark. ""Not like. It's not legal, having humans here. Highly restricted. I can tell cause there's been time they'll have guests and my little house gets all covered up and I'm muzzed so as not to make a sound. Very secret business. They don't much care about my happiness.""

""So why go to all that trouble to nab *me*?"" wondered Larry.

Clark grinned, which once again made Larry's insides crawl. ""Pretty obvious, isn't it?""

""How's that?""

""They go to the trouble to have *two* of us.""

""And?""

Clark's eyebrows raised up, then shimmied back down.

""Oh, for *God's sake*!"" shouted Larry. ""They can't be that stupid! We're both...""

""They check you at the door?"" said Clark. ""You have an examination process?""

""Well, no, but...""

""They're idiots,"" said Clark. ""The worst kind of idiot, too. Idiots with *big ideas*.""

Larry's head swam. ""I think I'm going to be sick.""

""Don't go in the toilet!"" shouted Clark. ""Hold it 'til we can get you inside their house. They've got a lovely white carpet. I'll go scratch on the door.""

Feeling weak, faint, and bewildered, Larry followed Clark out of the small abstract house and into the warm, evening air.",2016-08-31 14:21:05+00:00,d7404hr,1.0,t3_50glbs,12336.0,WritingPrompts
191,"And suddenly it were as if my dagger were made of paper. The blade flopped and crumpled as it pressed against the man's chest. He looked more than a little offended.

While I gawked at my limp dagger, the man drew back his broadsword and - cursing loudly in a delightfully consonant-heavy language - slashed down across my neck. 

It didn't quite work out for him either.

The tables so turned, I considered my options. I've never been a strong proponent of fistwork, as it were, but my God-given resources seemed to be the only tools left on the table. So, as my barbarous opponent considered the betrayal of his steel, I reared back, pulled my hand into what seemed the proper position, and swung.

The blow, though well aimed and (I believe) adequately powered, did not accomplish quite what I had hoped. The barbarian reacted as though it were a mockery, which did little for my self-regard. His overhand chop, however, managed to accomplish just as little. 

That surprised him, as I presume he was a bit more familiar with the bodily arts of violence. In that moment of mutual shock we both stood, regarding each other and the failure of our intentions.

""Well, that's a pit,"" I mumbled. The barbarian grunted, then took a second swing, just to be sure. When that failed to cause even the smallest hair on my head to twitch we were both forced to accept our strange circumstances.

""Don't suppose you know what we do now?"" I asked. The barbarian scratched his nose and looked away, perhaps feeling just as awkward as I was. 

""Guess we should..."" I made a motion with my hands symbolizing that we should go our own ways and take care to live good lives now that we'd been given this unexpected second chance. I don't know how much of that meaning was captured by the barbarian, but he turned and walked away, so at least the gist was there.

As for me, well, I returned home and took up dentistry, which, of course, I hate.

192,"*Pray for rain.*

Half-frozen gobs of congealed alien gasses thwump down on the plastiform hut. 

*Like prairie hail.*

Marcy 00-213 rests in the corner of the makeshift shed. The green-yellow strip of foss-light above casts branching shadows all along the underside of her Quad-Wing. She regards her ship - the white scorch marks across both underwings; the peeled *Diamondhead* decal; the broken fuel cover; the black crust creeping outward from the barrel of both plug-blasters.

*Another day. Another day.*

It doesn't fly in the rain - the black wingless orb she'd taken to calling the ""Stymph"" after the man-eating Stymphalian birds of ancient, ancient legend. Marcy's Quad *could* fly in the rain. She was fast enough, nimble enough. But the rain was the only chance she had to rest. When the rain stopped, she would have to stow the hut and take off once more. She would have to run.

She was convinced now that she was the last of them. 

The *Diamondhead* battalion had been four dozen ships strong at the start of the conflict. In the valley theater, the enemy had numbered only ten and none of those were anything larger than a short range cruiser. 

The *Diamondhead* was meant to sweep the valley and crush the small complement stationed there. They had nearly done that - until the arrival of the Stymph.

Marcy tries to close her eyes. The thrumming of the hail races out ahead of her heart's own manic beat. 

*Run and hide. Run and hide.*

Reports from other battalions came in slowly, all traditional methods of communication ground to splintered, squalling nonsense by the constant radiation-laced wind, rain, and hail storms. Only once *Diamondhead* had been successfully halved did they finally receive by then-ancient transmissions from *Opalwing* and *Jadeheart* warning them to scatter, to flee, to avoid the valley at all costs. The Stymph had cut through those battalions just as easily as it had *Diamondhead*.

Marcy had considered the possibility that she was not simply the last of her battalion, but the last of *any* of the advance guard. That she was alone on an alien planet. And what would that mean? The last to die is still dead, after all.
 
""But not dead,"" whispers Marcy. ""Not dead yet.""

She punches an inelegant series of instructions into the panel embedded within the underside of her forearm. Immediately her Quad-Wing begins to hum. Panels of the plastiform hut peel away, folding into themselves. The hail screams as the sound-dampeners shut down. A faint smokey outline appears above the Quad-Wing where the hail begins battering the ship's topside pressure-guard. The last of the hut compacts into a narrow box that slides into a joint between the ship's back landing prongs.

*Diamondheads do not abandon their post.* That thought had kept Marcy pinned down for a day and a half, considering the futility of a counterattack. But they needed to be warned. That was all she could realistically accomplish. Escape the atmosphere. Send a warning. 

As Marcy ascends to the cockpit, however, she looks up. The pressure-guard is invisible. The hail has stopped. The rain is over.

Orange and red lights spear down through the brown-black weave of stratus. 

Marcy locks herself into the pilot's chair. Ignites fusion. The thrust-cycle begins.

The tac-display blinks white. The sensor warning pings gently, urgently. 

*It's coming. It's coming.*

The thrust-cycle clicks through. Launch in 10.

The ping grows in intensity. The tac-display shows a vessel to the south-southwest. Coming fast. Coming low.

Marcy warms both plug-blasters.

*I'm not going to make it. I'm not going to make it.*

The nav-plac requests an initial coordinate drop. Marcy defers. 

*Manual. Has to be manual.*

The thrust-cycle completes. There's a punch and a push. The roar competes with the angry sonic jangle of the sensor pings. It's nearly on her. It's nearly there.

The Quad-Wing rejects the earth below with stunning, violent urgency. 

The ping is a steady, scolding whine.

*It's here.*

193,"Kristy nearly tipped the wheelchair in her rush to get me loaded into the van.

""Why are you so worked up?"" I asked as she centered me on the loading platform.

""Reg? C'mon, seriously? Do you not think this is serious? They could have you *committed*."" Kristy's eyes shone, wet and dark in the shade of the open door. If I could have reached out and wiped those tears away, I would have.

""Because of the number?""

""Yes, Reg, because of the damn *number*."" She buckled me in the place and raced around to the driver's seat.

""They can't put me in a hospital because of the number,"" I said. ""Besides, it's not like I'm a danger to myself.""

""It's not that,"" said Kristy, throwing the van into reverse. ""Your levels...you know why they re-tested you six times?""

""I'm a hard man to read,"" I said, smiling. Kristy ignored the joke.

""They thought it was broken. The floor is *one*, Reg. That's the absolute floor. And they've never registered someone below a 15 before. So you...""

""Am I gonna be in the Guinness Book of Records?"" I asked. 

""*It's not a joke.* These tests are serious. People aren't allowed to be that kind of unhappy.""

""But I'm not unhappy,"" I said. ""I think I'm doing pretty well for myself.""

""Well..."" Kristy trailed off as she pulled onto the highway. ""Really, Reg..."" I could tell she was crying, harder than before. ""Why? If you were so sad, why didn't you ever say anything?""

""Babe, I'm *not* sad,"" I said, again, wishing against all the other wishes in the world that I could just put my damn hand on her shoulder. ""I'm not. I don't know how that test works. How do you measure someone's will to live? What's the science?""

""You know I have no idea.""

""Well."" I thought fast. Because really, *why*? Why would I score so low? Was I wrong about how I felt? Could anyone be so out of touch with themselves they didn't even know they were the most miserable person the world's ever seen? 

""You know, though, maybe it *is* right,"" I said. ""I don't have any will to live.""

Kristy sobbed, though she did her best to hide it.

""No, hear me out. A will to live - that's effort. That's a struggle and a willingness to struggle. It's a fight. The highest numbers, those are the people that are fighting for their lives all the time. But I'm not gonna fight for it, babe. And maybe that's it.""

""So you don't want to be alive?""

""I don't *want* anything,"" I said, realizing that I meant it. ""I died in that accident, Kris. I was gone and it was over and that meant I wasn't ever gonna see you again in this world. But I came back. And here I am. And...I don't know how to say this so it makes sense. But this is so good. Every day I wake up and I see your face and I feel like no one's ever been so lucky. If it ends now, I'm still the luckiest. I'll always be the luckiest. There's nothing to fight for. I'm already at the mountaintop. Wanting more...fighting for another scrap of life...that's silly. That's selfish. I got to see you one more time. And every day since I've been drowning in good fortune.""

The car pulled over. The door wrenched open and Kristy threw herself around me. She buried her face in my neck and I felt her tears and her heat and her heart.

""You know,"" I said, ""if they made a device that measured how much I love you, it'd show zero, too."" She pulled away to look into my eyes. ""Because it'd break the very minute they strapped me in and turned it on.""

She laughed. ""You're an idiot.""

""I'm a world record holder,"" I said. And she laughed even more.  ",2016-08-29 17:03:46+00:00,d71etl3,1.0,t3_505tvi,2419.0,WritingPrompts
194,"I was lost. I was dead. It was *hopeless.*

Are you appropriately worried? Nerved up? No? Well...

Juan suggested it. Let's all take a moment to consider Juan and his bronze, lifeguard chest and his long, curly *I'll go to university when I know what I want to be* hair. Consider him and consider me, with my fair, Elizabethan skin and my crinkly left ankle that really ought to be kept off any significant inclines. Sure, a hike sounds marvelous when you're Juan and the sun gives you strength and your joints are as supple as sealskin. But where's *my* consideration? Really.

I'm not made for the wild. I'm fine China. Good for a look, grand for a party, but let's not eat egg salad sandwiches off me, alright? A little sense.

I went, though, because Juan had asked and I say yes to Juan when I really ought not. He said it was a simple path. ""Flat, clean, beautiful."" 

Was that a veiled come on, do you think? Was Juan talking about me? Juan talks like that, sometimes. He'll say things that are true, but unpleasant to hear; things that are true, but rather not worth saying; and things that are true, but really ought to be said more often.

Hmm.

Well, no matter. It was none of those things. It was wild, brambly, smelled of sap, with an endless amount of poking and scratching and buzzing about the ears. 

I hated it, really.

And that was long before my ankle gave out. 

I knew that would happen. So did Juan. The beast.

I thought he might offer to carry me out. That seemed the only appropriate response, don't you think? He got me there, he ought to get me out! And I'm hardly as heavy as I look. Tall, yes, but blessed with hollow, bird-bones. I weigh nothing as I look. My doctor is always surprised when I step on the scale. The only reason he doesn't suggest I gain weight is because he knows my body is in perfect balance.

But no. Juan did not offer to carry me. He offered, instead, to go on ahead and fetch me up on the way back.

Did you hear that part? *He offered to leave me there - prone and alone in the wilderness!* Injured, no less!

Pride made me silly. I see that now, of course. But at that moment I was furious and I said, *Yes, you go on ahead, you daft, stupid, glistening idol!* 

Discredit to me for giving Juan the credit of understanding sarcasm.

He smiled his sappy, curly smile and trotted off like a puppy free its leash.

Luck being what it is, my ankle felt better quite soon after and, not wanting to be alone in the woods, I went after him. But did I find him? Well, obviously not, I suppose.

The woods seemed to be conspiring against me. It was whispering wicked plans all about me. Holes sprung up below my feet. Branches swung down like cudgels, nearly decapitating me with every fourth step. A nightmare! An endless, torturous nightmare.

So, it shouldn't surprise you to hear that when I saw the tea shop...well...I had my doubts.

Actually, no, that's not entirely accurate. My first thought, upon seeing the shop, was *Oh thank GOD I hope they've got a loo.*

Then, a moment later, the oddness sort of settled over me, like a summer sprinkle. 

Because really - a tea shop in the wild, brambly woods? What's the idea there?

I thought it might be the delusions of a coming death. I mean, it'd probably been *hours* since Juan had left me for dead. That's about how long it takes to die of dehydration and exposure, I believe. But the walls were real when I went to touch them. Pretty, red polished wood. The whole thing looked a bit like an apple, actually, now I think on it. Roundish, reddish walls. Saggy, slopey ceiling. But there was a window in the front and I could see straight through at all the lovely big barrels of leaves and the counter and the stove...

Delusion or not, I was thirsty and I had money, so I went in. 

There was a single table in the middle of the shop. It looked like it had been cut straight out of the center of some enormous tree. You could see all the lines....

Sigurd snapped his fingers. The woman blinked.

""It's horrifying, ma'am,"" he said, smiling broadly. ""Truly so. But it seems as if perhaps you have caught up to the present moment. So I must wonder - what would you like?""

The woman cleared her throat. ""Coffee.""

""We are a tea shop,"" smiled Sigurd. ""Teas you will not find anywhere else in the world...in *any* world. That is what...""

""I prefer coffee,"" said the woman. ""Thank you.""

Sigurd collected himself and gestured towards the wall of open barrels, filled with aromatic leaves of various hues. ""Some teas, I daresay, may even reveal things to you that you would not otherwise...""

But the woman was getting back to her feet. ""This is appalling service,"" she sniffed. ""Expect a poor review.""

Sigurd thought to say something else, but the woman was already out again, into the woods and the growing darkness of evening. As the door swung shut, Sigurd collapsed into the nearest chair.

""It's alright,"" he assured himself. ""It's alright, Siggy. Sheila was wrong. You were right. A tea shop in the middle of an empty woods is a *great* idea. Novel. Intriguing.

Pelly behind the bar had a pint in hand before Conrad had even pulled up a stool.

""That good, huh?""

Conrad shook out his shiny, bald head, running a sleeve across the damp center. ""Just another day in paradise.""

""It can't be that bad, can it?"" said Pelly. ""I had an uncle who worked the trains. He never seemed all that aggrieved.""

""Most days is fine,"" said Conrad, taking a contemplative sip off the foam at the top of his glass. ""Really just today, I suppose. Every year, today. It's a madhouse."" He took a long pull of beer.

""Why today?"" said Pelly, before slapping the bar. ""Ah! *School* in'int? Kids headin' off to school and university. Too much screamin', is that it?""

Conrad nodded. ""Part of it, I suppose. Yellin'. Racin' each other. And all of 'em - *all of 'em* - pushing around these carts full'a..."" Conrad took another drink.

""Full'a what?""

Conrad loosed a soft, whispering belch. ""Big...I don't know...*kettles* maybe? Pots? Big ancient-lookin' iron pots, I guess.""

""You wouldn't think England had restaurants enough for all of 'em, that's the case,"" said Conrad. ""The pots is hardly the queerest bit, though.""

""Alright, give it out.""

""Well, they've all got pets, you see?"" said Conrad. 

""Pets at school?"" said Pelly. ""Well...I haven't a little one. Maybe that's just the norm these days. We live in gentler times, Connie. Maybe bringin' a pup to school helps with...I don't know...some'a the more *emotional* aspects of schoolin'?""

""Well, I h'ain't ever seen a dog, though, have I?"" said Conrad. ""It's all cats, rats, frogs, and *owls*, Pelly. Owls as pets? What the bloody hell *emotional* help is a goddamn owl?""

Pelly laid his hands flat on the bar. ""Now calm yourself, Connie. We're old men. Might be behind the times. Owls is...well, I can't pretend to understand it, but what's the...""

""It's owl shit *everywhere*!"" howled Conrad. ""And how'm I supposed to know the difference between a university rat and the regular sort? If this is what's become of our children, I weep for crown and country, I tell you that.""

Pelly nodded. ""I suppose it's...""

""And another thing!"" snapped Conrad, banging his now-empty pint glass back down on the table. ""Platform Nine *and three-quarters*??  What's the gag, Pelly? 'Cause I don't get it. That a joke on the train-man, doesn't know his fractions? What's the joke, Pelly? *What's the bloody joke*?""

Pelly gathered up the empty pint glass. ""Not for me to know. But I'm thinking bed's a better bet for you, right now. Been a long day, Connie. This one's on the house if you get a head up and get some sleep, alright?""

Conrad nodded, wearily rising up off the stool. ""Right. Right. Thanks, Pelly. Tomorrow'll be better.""

""Not on you,"" said Ella, shaking her head. ""You weren't there. You didn't have anything to do with it. Frankly, it's bad luck, Kandee. *Someone* was gonna get that 2001 letter. And that someone was gonna have to live with it, even though there was nothing they could do. It's just cruel.""

Because I wasn't exactly gonna buy a gun and drive up to Canada just because of what some crazy letter said. And now look.""

""I'm sorry,"" said Dale, leaning forward. ""I've only been here a few weeks. Which letter did you get, Mike?""

""Oh,"" said Mike, clearing his throat. ""Uh. I got the '94 letter.""

""Which said what?""

Mike looked around nervously. ""You know...about the Anti-Christ returning to Earth.""

""He got the Bieber letter,"" said Ella.

""Oh,"" said Dale, unconsciously shifting away from Mike. ""*Oh.*""

""See, there's two ways to look at it,"" said Margaret, hugging her owl-shaped handbag against her chest. ""One is - we're supposed to do something about it. Right? It's a warning and there's something we can do. The other is - there's nothing we can do about it and it's just a taunt. See? Just some psychopath with future-seeing powers trying to drive us crazy. I mean - what was I supposed to do? What's one little nobody against a powerful machine like that?""

Dale blinked. ""Sorry again. What was your...?""

""2011,"" said Margaret. ""She warned me about *Jack and Jill*. But like I said..."" 

Dale shuddered openly.

""I agree with Margaret,"" said Mike. ""We need to find that bitch and bring her down.""

""I don't think I said that,"" said Margaret.

Ella crumpled the empty coffee cup dramatically. ""That's not what we're here for. This is a support group for victims. We're here to heal and let it go.""

""But what about the 2016 letter?"" said Mike. ""We still don't know who got it. We don't know what it says. What if we *can* change things? Since we know better, shouldn't we be out there...looking?""

Ella shrugged. ""Between the floods and the refugee crisis and all the political bullshit that's gone on so far this year, I'd say that ship has likely sailed.""

Mike opened his mouth to argue, when the door to the meeting room opened slowly. A old woman with cherry-red hair and aqua-framed glasses poked her head into the room.

""I'm sorry. Is this the group...the group about the letters?""

Ella stood up. ""Did you get a January 1st letter? From a *Helen Goodman*?""

The old woman nodded and stepped into the room.

""This year's letter?""

""Yes,"" said the woman.

""Well?"" half-shouted Mike. ""God, woman! What did it say?""

""What's the disaster?"" asked Margaret, fingers crossed behind her handbag.

The old woman held up a piece of paper. It was heavily creased. ""Nothing,"" said the woman. 

""*Nothing*?"" said Mike, stepping forward to snatch the paper.

""Just says not to worry and that this is the last letter she'll need to send.""

""What does that mean?"" said Margaret, as Mike scanned the letter. 

""*Let's not worry about silly things like disasters anymore,*"" read Mike. ""*Things come and things go. It's been a fun ride. Thankfully, this is the last letter I'll need to send. Take care - Helen Goodman.*""

The support group sat and stood silently in their broken semi-circle, wondering at it all. In the distance, a sound like falling rain began to grow and grow and grow and grow until the building shook and the battering buzz was so loud no one could hear themselves cry out in terror. And inside the buzz there was something not unlike a melody...something horrid and familiar.

""I didn't, did I?""

Winifred nodded. ""And yet, you seem regretful.""

""I liked her, is all,"" said David, scuttling backwards until his shoulders rested up against the bar's brick wall. ""I just liked her.""

""She lied about Bowie,"" said Winifred, swooping to hover just off David's shoulder. ""Even you could tell that was a lie. She lied about her last boyfriend, too. It wasn't months ago, David. It was *days*. And he wasn't half the jerk she made him out to be.""

""It's fear, I think,"" said Winifred, holding a pale, luminescent finger up to her chin. ""No trust. We do it to ourselves, I suppose. Made a world that values perfection and fantasy. Who can trust themselves to be good enough as they really are?""

""She didn't trust that she was good enough,"" said Winifred blandly.

""Good enough for what, though? For me? I mean, doesn't that count for something?""

""Perhaps, but that won't come to anything good, will it? Lies. Lying. Make believe. Eventually you have to start living in the picture you've painted. And if it's not a picture you like...""

David rolled his neck. It cracked, loud and satisfying. ""So it's hopeless, then?""

""No,"" said Winifred. ""I know you think this is painful for me, but it isn't. It really isn't. I want to see you through this.""

""*Through it*?"" said David, struggling up to his feet. ""Through what? My life? Are  you sticking around for the whole thing?""

""Just until you find the right person,"" said Winifred. ""Someone who doesn't lie. Someone who believes in themselves enough to believe in you.""

David blinked, considering Winifred's pale, translucent face. ""Is that what happened to you? Did you not believe in yourself enough? Did you lie?""

Winifred said nothing. The two stared at one another for a long, long moment. ""I never lied about how I felt,"" said Winifred. ""Not about you.""

""But *you*, Winnie,"" said David. ""Is that why you...?""

She raised a hand. ""We'll find the right person for you. It wasn't me. But we'll find them. Then I'll go.""

""Okay,"" said David. ""It's late. Time to go home.""

So they walked, man and angel, slowly, unrushed, through purple city streets, saying nothing, accompanied only by the sound of a single pair of feet tapping along the pavement. ",2016-08-28 04:06:57+00:00,d6zlrtf,1.0,t3_4zxdku,7955.0,WritingPrompts
202,"In the summer of 1989, Hill Grandlin was a man without a country. At least, that's how it felt. More accurately, Hill was a boy and a boy with plenty of country. He just didn't happen to like what he was given, is all.

Her mother was Jodie and she sent him south to her father's place outside of Austin. 

""Better than mopin' around the house all day,"" she'd said. And though Hill had protested quite loudly that he hardly ever moped and when he did it was almost exclusively in his tiny, little outsized bedroom, it didn't come to much. He took a bus and arrived in Austin in the middle of a heatwave that threatened to melt his goddamn face off.

""How's anyone *live* in this?"" he said as he tossed his bags into Chet Grandlin's spotless Oldsmobile Cutlass. 

Chet laughed. ""You get used to it."" Hill had a hard time believing that was true.

They ate spaghetti and watched TV. Hill helped his grandfather clear out sections of the garage. It was *work*. And when it wasn't work, it was *dull.* 

""This isn't making me mope any less,"" he told his mother over the phone.

""Yeah, I didn't figure,"" she admitted. ""I just wanted you mopin' somewhere else for a few weeks.""

""Great.""

Time dragged, but there were always projects. Things to pull down and put up and polish in between.

Hill found a rolled up old poster. ""What's with the beefcake?"" he asked, holding the poster out for his grandfather to inspect. It was a painted action scene - a chiseled, shirtless Navy man hefting an enormous shell as guns blazed in the background. ""You in the Navy?""  

Chet regarded the poster. ""No. Not in the Navy.""

Hill looked from the poster to his grandfather. ""Kinda looks like you.""

Chet laughed. ""Well, it is, actually.""

That didn't compute with Hill. His eyes darted back and forth from poster to grandfather. ""What? You just said you *weren't* in the Navy.""

""I wasn't,"" said Chet. ""It's not a picture, see? Just a painting. I modeled for it. In a studio, actually. Not on a battleship or anything.""

""Well..."" Hill's shoulders slumped a bit. ""Very confused here. So you didn't fight in the war?""

Chet motioned for Hill to follow. They went to the living room, where Chet took a seat in his recliner. He proceeded to remove his left shoe. ""When I was a boy - younger than you, actually - I used to work on a farm in the summer."" The shoe came off, then the sock, revealing something white and foot-shaped, which was very much not a foot. ""Not getting into it, but there was an accident. Thresher...well, an accident. Like I said. And then I only had the one foot. They didn't take folks like that in the services. So no Navy. No Army. I stayed home.""

Hill's eyes strayed on the white, plastic prosthetic. ""So how'd you get on the Navy poster?""

""Well...that's a long story. And probably not interesting.""

""That, or tell me how you lost the foot,"" said Hill.

""Poster it is,"" said Chet. ""It starts, I guess, at the mill. I did line work there. Nothing exciting, but something to pay the bills. I met a friend there named Dan Wayvern. And *he* was big into weightlifting. You know? Big muscles. He even did shows on occasion. Contests, actually, where they'd come out - all the men - and they'd flex their muscles and the fella with the best ones got a prize. 

""I wasn't serious like Dan, but I took to it. It felt good to exercise and get strong. I liked the way it looked. I spent almost all the waking time I had away from the mill lifting weights with Dan. He was something of a mentor to me. 

""One day Dan introduced me to a man named Stan Dubois. And Stan, it turns out, was a wrasslin' promoter.""

""Wrestling?"" said Hill. ""Like Hulk Hogan and the Macho Man kinda wrestling?""

Chet shook his head. ""Not sure who that is, but it was the fights, you know? Two men grapple around in the ring. Like boxing, but with holds and things. And anyway, Dan thought I'd be good at it. So did Stan, I guess. He liked the way I looked. Said I looked like a 'Golden God' or something ridiculous like that. He told me the kind of money I could make, and it sounded good, so I went off to meet this wrassler named Franz Goebbels - like the Nazi. He wasn't a Nazi at all, though. He was actually named Clarence and he was from Iowa originally, but he went around as Franz Goebbels and acted like a Nazi. People hated him. It was all an act, though. And he showed me how it worked.""

""So wait...wait....*wait*. You were a *professional wrestler*?! Why hasn't anyone ever told me about this?""

Chet smiled. ""Your mom's not real proud of it. Thinks it was silly and dangerous. Might be right, I don't know. But it paid good for as long as it lasted. Made a lot of good friends all up and down Texas and Oklahoma, over into Louisiana. *Pretty Boy Hanson* they called me. I was never high on the card, mind you. I got beat up quite a bit by guys like Franz actually. Got them the *heat* they call it. They beat me up, crowds gets hot, then the *real* hero comes in the next week and sets 'em straight. I liked it. It was a lot of fun.""

Hill blinked. ""I'm still having a hard time with this. You were really a professional wrestler? Do you have any pictures or videos or anything?""

""Video, no. Might have a picture or two somewhere, but you asked about the poster, remember? That's why we're talking about all this.""

""Okay, well get to the poster, then.""

Chet smiled. ""So, Pretty Boy Hanson was popular enough, I suppose. The girls all yelled when I got punched. Didn't like seein' me hit in the face. Some fellas were fans of Pretty Boy, too. One was an artist. Fella named Landry. Small fella. Big, wide eyes and a real big mouth. Most people didn't like Landry. Thought he talked too much. And some didn't like him 'cause they thought he was..."" 

Chet considered himself. ""They just didn't like him. But I liked him, well enough. He gave me gifts sometimes. Said he was my number one fan. It was encouraging, I guess. That anyone cared that much.

""But like I said, Landry was an artist and he got a commission from the Navy. Recruitment poster. He asked me to model for it.""

""That okay since you weren't in the Navy?"" asked Hill.

Chet shrugged. ""Not anything anyone cared about. It was make-believe, more or less. But...there you go. That's how I got on the poster. My friend Landry painted it."" Chet picked up the poster, regarding it closely, earnestly.

""What happened to Landry? He make any other posters?""

Chet set the poster aside. ""No. No, Landry...the world wasn't a good place for Landry just then. He didn't get to do too many more paintings.""

""What happened?""

Chet blinked. ""Nothing. Some people just ain't right for the time they live in, that's all. He was a good artist, though, wasn't he? Real good.""

""Can I see a picture of you wrestling?"" asked Hill. Chet took a deep breath and pulled himself up to his feet. 

""Yeah. Let's go see what we can dig up.""    ",2016-08-26 21:43:41+00:00,d6y2r29,1.0,t3_4zqcx8,8492.0,WritingPrompts
203,"It was dizzying. Disorienting. Mireille felt herself inexplicably *pulled* downward by the dark gash in the crystal white.

And it was just a photo.

""Satellite takes pictures on a 30 second loop,"" explained Dr. Patel. ""Wind storms account for some of the degradation in the imaging, but if you look closely...""

Patel laid out a series of photos in front of Mireille. All taken 30 seconds apart. 

""It's...*changing*,"" she said.

""Slightly,"" nodded Patel. ""But it's not the ice. The ice is stable. The rift isn't moving. It's something *inside* the rift.""

""This isn't just a trick of the weather?"" offered Mireille.

""No,"" said Patel. ""It's quite clear. There's something inside that rift. Something alive.""

""We're going there, aren't we?"" said Mireille. ""Even though there's no chance that there's *actually* something alive in that ice, we're going anyway.""

""The camera doesn't lie,"" smiled Patel.

""Yeah, but people lie to themselves all the time."" She sighed. ""When?""

Patel smiled even wider. ""Now.""

_________________________________________________________

Mireille hadn't been to the ice in nearly 10 years. No money. No reason. And besides, she liked teaching just fine. Pass on what you knew. Hope someone else did better the next time around. 

It wasn't that Mireille considered herself a failure, it was simply that her vision had exceeded her abilities. There were no miracles in her fingertips. She could chip the ice, so the speak, but she wouldn't be the one to break it. 

Such is life.

Mark Garden was the expedition lead. Mireille immediately took a dislike to the man because he was at least 10 years younger than her and seemed openly aware of the fact. He gave instructions in a deferential manner, as if he didn't want to offend the elder stateswoman. Mireille decided not to let him off the hook. If wanted to make the next two weeks awkward for himself, so be it.

Besides that, however, he seemed a capable hand. He certainly seemed to engender loyalty from the rest of the crew easily enough. It made Mireille wonder darkly whether she was there for her expertise or to diversify the crew photos.

It took four days of travel via cargo plane, ATV, and articulated snow transport before they reached the rift. Garden and his nav lead were in constant contact with the satellite team back in Arizona. They couldn't afford to fall off-course. In the meantime they drove and slept and ate compressed rations. Mireille remembered some of the more superficial reasons why she never went back to the ice.

They stopped the transport a mile out from the rift. 

""Looks stable in the images,"" explained Patel. ""But Garden wants to be cautious.""

It was the right call, but it was Garden's call, so Mireille complained anyway. She had convinced herself that no one actually cared what she had to say and was starting to openly resent being asked to come. 

Still, she couldn't deny that *this* is what she'd always wanted the work to be. New things. Dangerous things. Things that challenged and changed old assumption. 

*Something* real.

And yet...sometimes, when she closed her eyes, she saw that black crater....that dark smear...and she felt her stomach lurch. She felt she was falling. And all the blood rushed out of her extremities and she had to put her head between her knees to keep from vomiting.

""Why am I here?"" she would mutter.

They walked the final mile. The rift was below the sightline, so they walked in a line, roped together like school children in case the head of the snake fell into the darkness. 

Garden, walking at the head, stopped suddenly.

""Are we there?"" asked Mireille.

Garden shook his head. ""Quiet. Can you hear that?""

Mireille heard her labored breathing and cursed herself for letting go of the nice, little gym habit she'd built for herself the year before. Otherwise, though, there wasn't...

""Are those voices?"" said a crew member named Reyes. 

*Voices?* thought Mireille. It was probably the wind. The wind can stand in for a lot of familiar sounds out in the blank, white wild.

""Forward,"" said Garden. ""Slowly. As quiet as possible.""

They marched, deliberate and slow. And as they moved Mireille began to hear it, too. Voices. A jumble of muffled conversations, like you might hear as you walked past a crowded bar on an otherwise empty street. 

They came at last to the lip of the rift, jagged and frozen. 

""Start putting some safety lines down,"" said Garden. ""Dr. LeGros?""

Mireille unclipped herself from the line and moved to the lip to stand next to Garden, who clipped her to his waist.

""Do you have any idea what's happening here?"" he whispered.

Mireille looked down. The interior of the rift was dark, but there was movement, clearly. Vague shapes flitted back and forth through the shadows. The voices had died down. 

""Is there any possibility another party beat us here?"" she asked.

""Not unless they came from the far side,"" said Garden. ""There are no tracks on this edge. And besides, this rift *just* opened less than a week ago. Who else could be here?""

""Captain?"" said Patel, who took a certain joy in brown-nosing Garden in front of Mireille. ""Look at this over here."" He led the pair along the ridge. ""Here. These...these look like claw marks, don't they?""

Mireille and Garden knelt down. Patel was right. There were deep, unnatural scores in the lip of the ice. 

""They look like pick-drags,"" said Mireille. ""But..."" She craned her head.

""From the inside,"" said Garden. 

""So someone *did* beat us here,"" said Mireille.

""Someone's down there?"" said Patel, incredulous.

Garden shook his head. ""We don't know what...""

What followed happened simply too fast for Mireille to register properly. Something came out of the dark - fast - and impaled itself into Garden's chest. It was a low whistle and a dreadful, wet *thump* and suddenly there was something like a crude, naked ax head tied to a line of rope embedded in Garden.

All three looked at the ax head and the frayed line of rope with wide, unbelieving eyes. 

That moment was briefest of all.

The rope went taut and Garden was dragged bodily over the edge of the rift.

Mireille saw the body slip into the shadowy darkness. Then her line went taut and she was dragged over just as suddenly.

She fell only a moment. Then the other end of her line tightened and pulled. 

But that lasted less than a moment, as the next person in line was dragged into the rift and the descent continued.

Down they fell, sputtering, jerking, the bodies behind her pulling and falling and pulling again. There were only a dozen on the line. One or two more and the whole thing would topple like a broken necklace.

As she fell, Mireille fought to push the terror away. Her eyes adjusted to the gloom, the quarter light. She could see Garden's body swinging in tight, concentric circles in front of her. Was he dead already?

*What happened*?

And as she managed to push the terror out, she heard the voices once more. Human voices. Gibbering. Senseless. Slick, wetish syllables sliding across rough, guttural tongues. 

They were reaching the bottom. She saw white. She saw people.

They were wild and thin and clothed in sheaths of caked-on mud. They blinked wide, pupil-less eyes as they jumped, fingers outstretched towards Garden's limp body.

""No!"" Mireille shouted. ""Don't touch him!""

Could they even understand her? She didn't consider the question. Just shouted, shouted so loud and hard that lines of spittle dripped from her mouth to the floor below.

Mireille felt the line of people behind her right themselves. The descent stopped. They were anchored. *They were anchored!* 

""Pull!"" she shouted, though her voice was already ruined. ""Pull us up!""

The wild, mud-caked men and women leapt for Garden's swinging body. Crooked fingers slipped through the hook of his carabiner. One had a hold.

Mireille braced herself for the tug-of-war. But there was no tug.

The man began to climb.

He crawled cautiously like a tired, wounded monkey over Garden's body. Over and around. Then he reached for the rope - the rope between Garden and Mireille. He climbed.

Mireille saw his blank, black eyes and curved, skull face and screamed.

She reached to disconnect herself from Garden but the carabiner was at *his* waist. The connecting rope was tied in a knot around Mireille's waist.

*Her knife.*

Where was her knife? Where was *her knife*? 

The rope shook with the weight of the climber. Two more had begun to climb up and over Garden. Mireille felt the line behind her buckle. *Too much weight. It's too much weight.*

Where was the knife?

Then the man had his hands on the straps of her backpack and Mireille knew it was too late for a knife. She pushed at the man as she twisted the safety of her carabiner. He bit her arm. She shrieked as he climbed past her, up to her back, up to the rope.

Reaching back, she grabbed his ankle and released her carabiner.

They fell and Mireille felt an unexpected relief in that moment of weightlessness.

*This* is what she'd been looking for, she thought in that final moment of quiet descent. Something real.

Such is life.      ",2016-08-26 15:36:24+00:00,d6xlyig,1.0,t3_4zobwq,11354.0,WritingPrompts
204,"""Uh...what's this then?"" Jaime held the old Motorola out away from his body. The man flinched.

""I'm so sorry,"" he whispered as he backed away.

""That's not an answer actually,"" said Jaime, stepping forward after the man. ""Why'd you give me this janky old phone? Don't need it, don't want it. Phone's are filthy, you know that? Germiest thing you prob'ly own.""

""I can't,"" said the man, turning to flee. ""I'm sorry!"" And then he was running. Jaime took two steps in chase, then remembered the last time he'd run was probably in middle school gym class and gave it up.

""Well, that's a....thing."" He looked the phone over. Looked like a Razr, maybe. At least ten years past it's prime. Jaime hauled back his arm with every intention of tossing the phone down the nearest alley, when it rang.

He glanced down at the front of the phone. The caller ID said MOM. Jaime decided he'd go ahead and try to extract a little insight into recent events.

""Hallo,"" he said. ""Jaime Guerrein. And who might this be?""

""*Who*?"" croaked an ancient-sounding woman at the other end of the ether. ""Where's Barney? Where's my Barney?""

""Barney, eh?"" said Jaime. ""Is that your son or something? Bit bald? Wiry glasses? Mole on the chin?""

""Barney? Where's Barney?"" cried the woman. Her voice was surprisingly powerful. Jaime couldn't quite figure the volume, so he was forced to hold the phone well away from his head when she spoke.

""Listen,"" said Jaime. ""Some fellow just gave me this phone, alright? I'm guessing maybe that's your Barney. I think something might be a little askew with old Barnard, ma'am. You have any other kids you can send after him?""

""Barney, did you get the chocolates I sent you for Christmas? The *Christmas chocolates*, you know?""

Jaime instinctive shook out the phone. ""Ma'am, d'you have any one else there I might be able to talk to? I'm trying to tell you I'm not Barney.""

""How many were nougat?"" asked the old woman. ""Because the box said half, but I heard from Fernice she got hardly two in her box. I'd like to send them back if there weren't enough nougat.""

""I haven't really got any insight into the chocolate box situation, ma'am, as I'm *still not Barney*."" Jaime took a deep breath. ""Anyway, I thought maybe I'd try to help, but I don't think there's much I...""

""Doesn't matter if the box is empty. Just send me the wrappings. I've still got the receipt. I'll get you a new box once the refund comes in.""

""You know it's bloody *August*, don't you woman? What sort of lunatic hoarder would still have their chocolate wrappings from *Christmas*?""

The old woman cleared her throat. ""You know your cousin Edwin's queer now, right?""

""Grand for Edwin,"" sighed Jaime. 

""I always suspected,"" said the old woman. ""Wore those felt pants when he was a kid. Obvious, I guess.""

""Dreadfully so. I'm sorry, but I really need to be...""

""New postman's a raghead, by the way, so don't send me any money through the post, alright?""

""Are you a real human being?"" asked Jaime wonderingly. 

""Fernice has a nephew in the armed forces. I don't know which branch.""

""What does that have to do with anything else you've said?""

""You notice how much *apples* cost these days? It's outrageous. Did the Jews take over the apple industry, too?"" She coughed a dry, rattling cough, interwoven with tittering laughter.

""I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say to any of this,"" said Jaime. ""You're clearly an awful woman and *why am I still talking to you*?""

""Oh Barney,"" she sighed. ""Sometimes I think I'm just about at the end.""

Jaime nodded. ""That seems like a good place for you.""

""Earnest died. Maggie died. Willa died. And what've I got? Nothing. Not much. No how. Just you and this phone. And that's it. Sometimes I think...I think you'd prefer it if I died.""

Jaime opened his mouth, intending to support the standing thesis, but some strange, little empathetic defect in his heart wouldn't let him. ""No. No. You're....you're fine. You're just fine.""

""Really?"" The woman's voice brightened. ""Because...well, sometimes it just feels like no one wants me around anymore.""

""No,"" said Jaime. ""They...we...you're fine. You're alright. Keep on...being alive.""

""Thank you, Barney. Thank you. That means a lot to an old woman. Now hold tight for a minute. I found an old article in this *National Geographic* all about these African ladies with crazy giraffe necks. It's the funniest thing. Let me find that magazine and I'll call you right back.""

The phone clicked dead. And just like that the spell was broken. Jaime blinked. A young woman in a pink windbreaker was jogging past just then. Jaime half tackled her as he jammed the phone into her hands.

""I'm so sorry!"" he shouted as he ran away down the street like a middle schooler with nothing left to lose.  ",2016-08-26 02:27:35+00:00,d6wzqgm,1.0,t3_4zltfn,7172.0,WritingPrompts

207,"I vote for /u/schoolgirlerror for “By the light of my cigarette”
________________________________________________

**Lessons learned during this contest**

I don’t know about anyone else, but this contest taught me a few valuable lessons about the perils of writing to a word count. I started writing with no concept of how long the story actually should be and ended up compressing key sections once I realized how little space was left. In hindsight, I should written the story to completion, then gone back and whittled away the fat in order to make weight. So, that was pretty cool. Go learnin'! 

*Feedback on the finalists*

“Diner du Duane” (Mirari_Inanis) - I already provided a bit of feedback on this in the last round. Lovely piece, fun for a hang-out, but not enough was gained and hardly anything was lost.

“By the light of my cigarette” (schoolgirlerror) - I love that this has a full character arc. I don’t love how tidy that arc feels. There’s not enough in the encounter with Sha to convince me that anything significant has changed for Nate. She’s a poser. He’s a poser. Everyone’s a poser. I wish the stuff with Sha was slightly less blunt and on-the-nose. 

That said - I remain completely open to the possibility that Nate is an unreliable narrator and a cynic, at that. This is his writing, after all. So why wouldn’t he give his main character (himself) an unearned, epiphanic moment? Is this Nate writing what he thinks someone like Kit would want to hear? Is Nate the kind of person who learns lessons or prefers to fake it instead?

Either you tricked me or Nate tricked me or I tricked myself. Either way, there’s too much that works here for me to vote for anyone else.Cheers to you, you contest-smashing jumble of 1s and 0s.

“Stitches” (resonatingfury) - This feels a bit like cotton candy writing to me. And, it needs to be said, a lot of people like cotton candy. It’s sweet and tasty, after all. For me there wasn’t much substance here and part of that may just come down to the fact that I didn’t quite buy anyone’s behavior, especially Dana. Dana is too kind. I like to think that people like Dana exist (and I bet they do), but they don’t necessarily make for compelling characters. It’s great that Frank is nice to Victoria and I’m sure any mother would be grateful that he walked her back home (even against his will), but letting a stranger into your home - with your two young children - is dangerous and not something I buy a single mother doing without at least a bit more of an internal struggle.

In truth, however, I’m not sure what you do differently here. In the version I’d prefer this is a lot messier and people are a bit more conflicted and when you get to the catharsis at the end it’s been a bit of a bumpier road to get there. But this is conflict-free and sometimes that’s what people want in a story. Nice people being nice to people who need niceness.  

“Burden” (LustLacker) - I loved a lot of this - it felt like a bit of a Bradbury-McCarthy mash-up. The writing is very strong and quite vibrant. The ending is very flat and pretty disappointing after everything that’s come before, though. I suppose it means they made it, but it’s an ambivalent note to end on. So here’s my completely unasked for suggestion - start at the fence. “You have 30 seconds.” Then flashback using that 30 second period as the fulcrum, with the question “Is this guard just fucking with me and he’s going to shoot me in the back, or are we really homefree?” Because the “present day” periods covered in the story are sort of meaningless. The man walks with the girl. Check back….still walking. One more time...yup, still walking. There’s no tension in those moments because nothing is really happening and we don’t yet know where he’s going. I think the flashbacks would gain a lot of tension if the present day stuff was more openly hostile, and by diving into the past we can start to figure out whether or not these two are completely boned.

Also, while I like some of the world-building here, I’d suggest that there’s actually too much of it. If you walked back a few of those terms and ideas and made things a bit more vague, I think I’d be more inclined to think, “I wonder what happened?” As it is, I was left with more of the “Wait, what? There was a war and then some sort of oppressive, dystopian government set itself up and there’s famine and the war is over but we’re still bombing Canada for some reason, and this all happened is what - a couple decades? What the hell happened?” kind of questions. I feel like I either need to hear more about this stuff to understand what it is (and why it’s important to the plot and not just writerly noodling) or less so it’s not quite so front and center.

“Mother May I?” (Just-a-Poe-Boy) - I can’t help but feel like what happened at the end could have happened to any parent. You get busy, you lose sight, something terrible happens. I get that there’s an extra level of terrible here because the kid asked for the pills and the mother said yes, but the end result isn’t any different. And when you’ve spent so much time and energy focused on Victoria’s many anxieties and phobias, it feels like those should play a more central role in how everything falls apart.

Speaking of Victoria’s issues - she may just have a few too many of them. She is comically over-the-top, to the point of distraction. I kept wondering how this woman is even a functioning member of society.

That said, there’s a ton of great tension in this and Victoria’s constant, self-absorbed inner-commentary is fascinating. 

“Greenland” (Barahagara) - The ending doesn’t work for me. That’s it, really. The rest of this is pretty marvellous. Amazing details, great progression. The setting itself does a lot of heavy lifting creating an underlying tension. Flat, endless plains of white. The neverending sunlight. It’s really great. 

But the ending is very flat and slightly silly. There’s no hint that this is what’s coming. There’s not even an obvious reason for it - Alex doesn’t really seem to care, he just doesn’t want to be involved. And what about everyone else? These are the only four people that know about it? 

Honestly, it may just be that everything that came before was so good I couldn’t help but be disappointed by the ending. Excellent stuff.",2016-08-25 00:38:09+00:00,d6vg3gc,1.0,t3_4z4lnr,161074.0,WritingPrompts

213,"Munoz is pressed against my back. She's braced against me, using the pressure to hold her in place as she attempts to pry the plastic lid off with her fingertips.

It's pitch black.

I've got one hand wedged under a steel girder and the toe of my left boot crammed into something that may be the safety release for the airlock. I've got an open utility knife in my free hand. 

All I can do is wait while Munoz works at the lid.

Both of us knows better than to say anything. She focuses on the lid, while I listen. 

There are two other bodies floating around in this escape pod. One is a corpse named David. The other is the man who killed David.

The lid covers a series of switches we can use to reboot the pod's electrical systems. If we can get the lid off, we can boot the electricity and the lights will turn back on.

Munoz has nothing but her fingernails to peel off the lid. I can hear her nails snapping and cracking as she claws and claws desperately.

I don't know who the man is. I think he may be the same person who sabotaged the *Atlas*. He must have been hiding in the escape pod. He must not have known how to initiate the detach and launch protocols. I'm still not sure how he managed to fritz the electric and kill the lights. I saw him just before it all went dark - he was on David's back; the knife was already halfway through the neck when everything went black.

I don't know why he's holding back.

He's going to come for us. The pod isn't that big. Less than the size of a small apartment. When the lights come on he'll be outnumbered. The advantage will swing back to us. But for now, in the dark, it's zero sum.

I'm already resigned to death. I felt it somehow, with my back pressed up against Munoz. It's okay if he gets me. It's just not okay if he gets her. So when he comes, he'll meet me first, and even if he comes out on top, I'm not letting him off the hook that easy. I'm taking him with me. And if I can't take him with me, I'm taking enough of him so there's barely anything left for Munoz.

""Come on,"" I whisper. I can feel Munoz tense behind me. She's scared, but doesn't say anything. I need him to find me if I'm going to find him. 

""Come on,"" I say. ""Come on.""

I've only got one hand free, so he'll have to make first contact. That's okay. He can have me. I just need to take most of him with me.

""Come on,"" I say, louder. ""*Come on!*""

""Don't,"" hisses Munoz. ""I can't get it open."" 

""Keep trying,"" I say.

She's shaking. ""I can't get it *open*,"" she gasps.

I feel something like a warm breath across my cheek. *He's here.*

""I can't,"" she says. ""I can't.""

I let go of the steel girder and float forward. ""That's okay,"" I whisper. ""Don't worry.""

I can feel us rushing together like dandelion seeds in the wind. I hold the knife up to my chest.

I'll just have to take all of him. That's all.  ",2016-08-23 04:05:04+00:00,d6stzt4,1.0,t3_4z4bwe,4754.0,WritingPrompts

218,"Wayne LaFell had never wanted a career in politics. Even as a 45 year old man with a wife, three children, and an underwater mortgage, he still daydreamed sometimes of dropping everything and taking a *real* shot at the NHL. His speed was shot thanks to the knee injury that ruined everything the first time around, but he still had the soft hands and vision that had made him a 4th round pick coming out of junior hockey. Yes, he still had it. He knew he did. He just needed someone to take a shot.

Politics had been a thing to do while he worked his way back to competitive hockey. But things don't always go the way you plan. And politics had worked out a bit better than Wayne had ever imagined.

""Mr. LaFell?"" said Reggie over the intercom. ""The American delegation is here.""

""Send them in."" Wayne stood up and smoothed out his suit. *Canadian Foreign Minister* was the kind of job title he would have stuck his nose up at when he was a teenager, but he had to admit it wasn't such a bad job. Not a lot a work, a little bit of harmless graft, and plenty of respect. Best of all, he was never late for supper. Not bad for a broken winger.

The American contingency was three strong. A smallish man in glasses, another, more ""political"" looking fellow in Armani, and a third that looked like he wasn't there to talk. As Wayne suspected, the fellow in the Armani did most of the talking.

""Minister LaFell, pleasure to meet you,"" he said, offering a handshake. ""Ray Blunt, State Department."" He pointed at the smaller one in glasses. ""This is Karl Neiman from NASA. He's here as a reference. And this is Wilson Greer. I can't tell you where he's from."" Blunt winked, but Greer's face made it amply clear that it wasn't a joke.

""Have a seat,"" said Wayne, circling back around his desk. Blunt and Neiman sat. Greer remained standing. ""I'm a little surprised to see you folks. I assumed all your resources would be tied up with the Lexington Affair for the foreseeable future.""

""Ah,"" said Roy, leaning forward eagerly in his chair. ""And Lexington is *exactly* what we're here to talk about.""

Wayne felt his stomach drop slightly. ""I...is there some trouble? Are they...hostile?""

""No, no, no!"" said Roy. ""Not in the least. In fact, they are the very opposite of hostile. They are so *unhostile* in fact, that I am pleased to say that the United States of America has completed our business with the Visitors.""

""You've...I'm sorry, I don't know what that means.""

Roy glanced down at Neiman in a very meaningful way. ""We've completed all of our research,"" said Neiman. ""They...we're good.""

Wayne blinked. ""You're 'good'?""

""All done!"" said Roy, wiping his hands dramatically. ""Our scientists work fast.""

""Um...congratulations?""

""No, no,"" said Roy, shaking his head. ""Congratulations to *you*.""

""Me?""

""Yes. Minister LaFell, I am very excited to announce that the United States of America - as a show of neighborly solidarity - would like to transfer the Visitors to Canada for further...you know, research and such.""

After a moment Wayne became aware that his mouth was partially open. ""Er. Uh. You want to send the aliens....*to Canada*?"" Wayne's eyes swept back and forth between the three men.

Roy cleared his throat. Neiman spoke. ""We've done all we think we can do. We believe that *Canada* is better suited to...uh...continue this research.""

Wayne began to feel as though he were being pranked. Americans did love their pranks. ""You seriously believe that Canada would be suited to continue research on the first alien lifeforms ever encountered on our planet?""

Roy nodded. ""We didn't even consider Mexico. Straight to the top, so to speak."" 

""Well, what about..."" Wayne wracked his brain. ""Japan's pretty good with science things, aren't they? My TVs from Japan.""

""Not the right people for the job,"" said Roy. ""This is sensitive stuff here, Minister. It's not the science. These Visitors require a certain level of...uh...empathy. They are, after all, strangers in a strange land.""

""*Empathy*."" Wayne rolled the word around in his mouth like a caramel. Canadians *were* highly regarded for their kindness and sensitivity. Much less dangerous than America, as well. Very welcoming to immigrants and refugees. Yes, he could begin to see the value in relocating two frightened Visitors to someplace safe and quiet, like Canada. ""And your President is alright with this?""

""Suggested it himself,"" said Roy. ""Really values our relationship with Canada.""

Wayne looked at the scientist. ""And you think we're adequately equipped to make them comfortable? I don't know what kind of...""

""Oh yes,"" said Neiman. ""They really don't need much. Just a sympathetic ear and tub of lukewarm salt water.""

""Well,"" said Wayne. ""I'm not sure that I have the authority to...""

""I'm certain that you do,"" said Roy quickly. He got to feet and moved to the desk. ""So what do you say? Let's make Canada the home of the world's first verified extraterrestrials. Hockey, maple syrup, and aliens - that's what Canada is all about.""

Wayne felt the pressure of the moment and suddenly he was transported back in time. He was on the ice. The puck was on his stick and time was running down. 

*He could do this.*

*Take the shot - make the shot.*

""Let's do it!"" he said, bursting from his chair. Roy grabbed him in an unexpected bearhug. 

""Thatta boy!"" said Roy. ""Wilson, go get Dotti and Botti.""

""Dotti and Botti?"" said Wayne.

""Their names,"" said Roy as Wilson disappeared through the door.

""What do you mean he's going to get them?""

""They're out in the car,"" said Roy. 

""In the...""

Neiman dropped a pair of earplugs on the desk. ""Remember, lukewarm saltwater.""

""What're these for?"" said Wayne, picking up the earplugs. ""Are they loud or...""

""Those are for your nose,"" said Neiman. ""The excretions occur on a three hour cycle, so they should be due any minute. Whatever you do, don't touch the yellow pus, even with gloves on. It'll burn right through.""

""What are you...?""

Just then Wilson barged through the door, followed closely by two humanoid figures covered in shiny, crimson scales.

""Dotti and Botti,"" said Roy, ""this is Minister LaFell, representing the great nation of Canada. He'll be looking after you from now on.""

The two alien blinked serenely. One began to ooze slightly.

""That's our cue,"" said Roy. ""Been a pleasure, minister. Good luck! God save the Queen. Etc., etc.""

The three men stormed out of the room before Wayne could say another word.

Wayne cleared his throat. ""Uh. So....do you two speak English, perhaps?""

""Yes,"" said one. ""Did you decorate this office?""

""Um, no,"" said Wayne, ""but I did...""

""Was the intention to make its occupant too horror-stricken for their mind to wander?""

""I...""

The other alien motioned towards the far wall. ""This wallpaper has been scientifically engineered to induce vomiting, correct?""

""The scent you are wearing,"" said the first alien. ""Does it denote that you bear a contagious disease deadly to members of the opposite sex? Because I can find no other reason why one would intentionally scent themselves in such an unpleasant manner."" 

""Your facial hair has been constructed in an attempt at ironic humor, correct?""

Wayne collapsed back down into his chair as the aliens continued their observations.

""Sir?"" said Reggie. ""Did the Americans just leave those aliens here?""

Wayne sighed. ""It's a great day for Canada, Reggie.""

""Should I...should I call the Prime Minister's office?""

Wayne glanced up at the aliens. ""I do not believe this carpet is currently in style in any known timeline,"" said one.

""No,"" said Wayne. ""I don't think we'll tell him just yet.""     ",2016-08-20 18:22:58+00:00,d6pmvvj,1.0,t3_4yot5s,21141.0,WritingPrompts
219,"SCENE: EXT. TERRACE - BLACKNIGHT CASTLE

A man LORD HUGO VATARIS sits atop an enormous warhorse. A CROWD OF PEASANTS holding simple spears and converted tools, stand in a semi-circle around the horse.

VATARIS: I know that for most of you, this will be your first experience with combat. You may be scared. You may be terrified. You may *think* that you will not survive this. If you have these thoughts, I ask only that you look at me. *Look* upon me as I sit astride this magnificent beast and tell me what you see.

WORMMOUTH: What we *see*, my Lord?

VATARIS: Aye. Tell me what you see.

Peasants look askance at one another.

FISH (shrugging): Fetal alcohol syndrome?

VATARIS: *WHAT?*

HORESMORE: Diabetes at *least*, right?

WORMMOUTH: There's got to be some sort of heart condition involved, I'd wager.

HORESMORE: A bit jaundiced, too. You think maybe liver poisoning?

VATARIS: I said LOOK at me, not diagnose me, you idiots. I'm *alive*. That's the damn point I'm trying to make. I'm alive. You lot all think one little skirmish might kill you, but look at me. Do you have any idea how many wars I've fought in? Any idea?

WORMMOUTH (raising hand): Three?

VATARIS (face turning noticeably redder): *Hundreds*! Literally, hundreds. And I've come out on top every time. You don't get to be a *warlord* winning only three wars. That's not a title they just toss about. You need a full ledger to be a warlord. So look at me and know that you aren't riding to defeat, because I'm here and *I have never ridden to defeat.* 

WORMMOUTH: Well....

VATARIS (scowling): Well *what*?

WORMMOUTH: Well, you lost at least the one time, right? Otherwise you wouldn't have the death sentence and you wouldn't be here, working us up for a suicide charge into the center of the Silver Wizard's army. 

FISH (nodding): Oooooh right. I remember that. You got drubbed something thorough, my lord.

HORESMORE: That the one where he lead an army 30,000 strong against the walls of Blacknight, held by only 2,000 men?

VATARIS (through gritted teeth): That's an oversimplification.

FISH: Never seen anything like it. They say it was the most improbable defeat in military history.

VATARIS: That's never been mathematically verified.

WORMMOUTH: Alright, so we look at you and remember all those fights where you *didn't* get drubbed - is that it?

FISH: Now all I can remember is the one where you got mopped up.

HORESMORE: Me too.

VATARIS: Then *don't* look at me. In fact, I want you all to close your eyes. Close your eyes and use your imagination. (*Closes own eyes*) Physical strength is only half the equation. The other half is mental strength. You need to *believe* you can win. So with your eyes closed, I want you to imagine the Silver Wizard standing before you. Imagine him with his fiery staff *Lothar* and his mightly Elven greatsword *WorldEnder*. Imagine him bearing down upon you in the field of battle, the white fire of *Lothar* reflected in the polished steel of *WorldEnder*. Imagine yourself, standing before him, armed only with your broken ploughshare and your fierce determination. Your every inch quivering with power and fear and bravery as *WorldEnder* rises above you, ready to...

WORMMOUTH: My lord?

VATARIS: What? What? You're breaking the imagination.

WORMMOUTH: The imagination was very good, sir. Maybe a bit too good, though.

*VATARIS opens his eyes. Most of the peasants are either unconscious, covered in urine, or both.* 

VATARIS: Oh for God's...Forget it. Let's all just make a run for it.

*The peasants let out a CHEER.*    ",2016-08-19 20:00:35+00:00,d6oh87o,1.0,t3_4ykl6r,4042.0,WritingPrompts

221,"""Of course we will,"" said David, his eyes half closed against the white-yellow sunlight that flickered through the cabin. ""It's the *city*, Nancy. They've got sweet shoppes and big libraries and real, chalked-up ball fields. They've got *everything*. We'll like it, for sure. What's not to like?""

Nancy's hand danced across the warm, bristly scruff of Ranger's neck. The white dog shuddered slightly as it slept, caught in a passing dream of conflict and triumph.

""It will be so *different* though,"" said Nancy. ""We'll hardly know anyone.""

""We'll know Aunt Ruth,"" said David. ""And we'll know each other. That's enough for a start, isn't it?""

""What about Henry?"" she said, motioning towards her younger brother, asleep at David's side. ""He's shy, you know. Don't you worry...""

""Who's shy?"" said Henry, cocking one open eye towards his sister. ""I'm not shy.""

""You're reserved,"" said Nancy.

""I was *reserved* in Baybrook,"" said Henry, closing his eyes and resettling himself. ""I won't be reserved in the city.""

""Can't afford to be,"" said David. ""You get swallowed up in the city if you can't stand up for yourself.""

Nancy wiped a bit of dog hair from her gloves. ""You talk like you know.""

""Remember?"" said David, tapping lazily on the glass of the window. ""I've been out to the city. Dad took me out to see the matches at the Colosseum for my birthday three years ago. Afterwards I saw two men fighting in the street. Two men, just throwing punches. It wasn't anything like the matches. It was...wild. And sort of ugly. I remember thinking someone was going to run out there and stop them. Actually, to be truthful, I thought Dad would. But he didn't. No one did. And one of the men got beaten so bad I don't know if he even lived.

""Afterwards, I asked Dad why he hadn't done anything and he said it wasn't our business. He said there's too many people doing too many things in the city for you to go around helping anyone. That's why you can't be shy in the city.""

""I'm *not* shy!"" said Henry, eyes still closed.

""People get into fights in the streets?"" said Nancy. ""Just...they go around hurting each other?""

David shrugged. ""I'm sure they had their reasons. Probably betting on the matches. Money makes people sour in the city. Just don't give anyone a reason to be cross with you and you'll be fine.""

The cabin became silent then. David closed his eyes and feigned sleep, while Nancy watched the wheat dance madly as the train rattled and lurched through the farmland. The tan waves had an almost hypnotic effect. Nancy's mind reeled backwards to Founder's Day. She saw her mother in the center of a rainbow pinwheel made of cloth banners and spinning men. The air seemed to vibrate with chants. She remembered reaching for her father's hand and the way he pulled his hand away. 

""David,"" she whispered, trying not to wake Henry.

Her older brother's eyes opened slightly. 

""Do you..."" She considered her question carefully. ""Do you think about Mom? Ever?""

His eyes closed. ""No.""

Nancy felt her face get warm. Her fingers dug hard into Ranger's neck, waking the dog. ""Because she was...""

""She wasn't our mother,"" said David. ""You can't be *that* and be a mother. Not really. Everyone knows that.""

""She was our mother,"" said Nancy softly. ""She took good care of us. Why doesn't that matter? She loved us. Did she ever forget a birthday or fail to make you feel better when you were hurt? Did she ever...""

""She's gone,"" said David. ""I don't want to talk about her.""

Nancy left her brother alone. She tried to sleep, but when she closed her eyes she saw the white tree and nearly screamed.

""I don't think she was bad."" Nancy looked up and realized that Henry was awake and talking to her. ""I know what they say about her kind, but you're right. She loved us. Remember when I broke my arm and when I woke up it was fine again? Why would she do that if she didn't love us? Why would she do something so dangerous?""

Nancy nodded. Henry hadn't been there on Founder's Day. Her father had given the boy a mug of sweetmilk spiked with brandy and left him sleeping at home. As far as Nancy knew, Henry hadn't even understood the significance of the white tree that had sprouted up overnight in their backyard. 

David had known, however. And when the men came to collect their mother, he had simply sat on the front steps and watched.

Nancy had assumed that Henry's broken arm had been the key, but it wasn't. No one else had ever known about the arm. The suspicion had begun during the harvest the previous year. Nancy's father grew cabbage and carrots and potatoes. Nancy hadn't known this, but apparently the winter freeze had come too late or too early. In any regard, their crop was plentiful in a way that made their neighbors jealous - and at least one suspicious.

Heyman Goold suspected that something unnatural was afoot. In an effort to prove his theory, he shot Ranger. The dog should have died, but it did not. 

So Goold planted the seed of a wild ash tree in their front lawn. The wild ash is known for being receptive to magic. Under normal circumstances there is nothing out of the ordinary in the way they grow. But in the presence of magic they grow suddenly - and turn white as dust.

On the train, Nancy nearly laughed to think of herself that morning. She awoke so alive and full of cheer. Founders Day! There would be singing and dancing and maybe, just maybe Rory Cashin would ask her for one of those dances.

But when she stepped out of their house that morning the first thing she saw was her father, standing very still just beyond the doorway. She stepped around him and saw the white tree and fell to her knees. She felt all the good and the joy and the promise of her life drain away from her. She felt so fearful that vomited there, in the grass.

Heyman Goold came with men. And they took Nancy's mother away.

There had not been a witch in Baybrook for some 50 years. They had to consult a torn, old book to remember what to do.

They chanted and spun as the fire built and built. All the while Nancy's mother stood, serene and patient. 

When it was over, those gathered simply wandered away, tired and unsatisfied.

Ten days later, the children were placed on a train for the city. 

""I'll follow, eventually,"" their father had said. ""Be good to Ruth. Be good to each other.""

Nancy could not help but notice the way her father would not look her in the eyes.

""She wasn't a bad witch,"" said Henry. Nancy could see the tears slipping down his ruddy cheeks. ""And she was still our mother.""

""She wasn't a witch at all,"" whispered Nancy to no one but herself. As Henry settled back into sleep, she pulled the glove off her right hand and admired the faint glow of white light that pulsed from her fingertips. ""I'm sorry, Mom,"" she said, clenching her fist tight. Diffused by the flesh of her closed hand, the light glowed blood red. ""I'll look after them. I'll never let anyone hurt us again.""",2016-08-18 16:07:11+00:00,d6mqrs7,1.0,t3_4yci9b,6506.0,WritingPrompts

225,"Mary Stevenson found her son where she always found him at 7am: wrapped around the mini-fridge on the concrete floor of the basement wearing nothing but a pair of over-matched white undies and a physiologically unlikely amount of body hair.

""Darrell, get the hell up! You can't be late for work again.""

Darrell Stevenson awoke with a snort and a fart. ""Wha? Why? Yes? M'up. M'up. Okay.""

Mary shook her head. Was it the drugs, she wondered? Yes, the doctor had suggested rather strongly that hard drugs during pregnancy *could* adversely effect the baby, but cocaine wasn't really a hard drug, and besides - it was the 80s. How was any sane woman supposed to make it through the 1980s without cocaine and quaaludes?

""You lose your job, you're out of here. You hear me? And what the hell were you up to last night?"" Mary stomped to Darrell's lopsided, secondhand Ikea desk and started picking through the various loose sheets of paper and spiral-bound notebooks.

Darrell pulled himself to his feet and considered his hands for a moment. For some reason his right wrist hurt. The most likely culprit - at least from a historical standpoint - seemed to be over-masturbation, but Darrell left himself open to the possibility of simply having slept on it funny. He decided he would run some tests in the shower.

""This is all crazy talk,"" said Mary, shuffling through the pages.

""What?"" said Darrell, retrieving his work pants from behind the pull out couch.

""All this stuff on your desk,"" said Mary. ""You've got his one thing here - *Bi-partisan student loan reform.* Since when have you had any student loans?""

Darrell shrugged. ""Um. Maybe it's about that one time Jimmy Parsons loaned me three dollars for lunch.""

""When was that?""

Darrell considered this, which involved a good bit of finger counting. ""1991.""

""Well, you've got a whole goddamn *notebook* about Jimmy Parsons' $3 then."" Mary tossed the notebook aside. ""And what's this? This sounds pretty perverted.""

Darrell padded across the cold, gray floor and took the stapled pages from his mother. ""*Gender In-e-qua...Inequality in the Workplace - A Solution to America's Opportunity Gap.* Huh.""

""Who's *gap* is that about, anyway?"" said Mary, swatting Darrell across the back of the head. ""Sounds like pornography to me.""

""Mom, I don't write pornography,"" said Darrell. All the same, he found himself quickly scanning the document for any good bits. He briefly got excited when he saw something about women getting taken advantage of, but that didn't amount to much. He tossed the papers into the bin. ""I must have some sort of sleep disease,"" he suggested. ""Like sleepwalking, but I just sit here and write out a bunch of nonsense instead.""

""Paper's not free, you know,"" said Mary, picking up yet another notebook, this one titled *ISIS - Decoding Patterns of Movement.* ""You used up both sides, too! Can't even write on the back.""

""Well, I can't help it, can I?"" said Darrell. 

""Can't you sleep-do-something-helpful instead? Like sleep-clean-the-gutters?""

Darrell yawned, pushing the rest of the notebooks and papers into the trashcan. ""That's not how the human brain works. It's complicated, mom. You wouldn't understand.""

""I understand you're *going to be late*!"" She pushed her son towards the stairs. ""No 20 minute shower this time. Move move move. Airport's not going to security itself. Let's go!""

""Alright, alright,"" said Darrell, stifling another sigh as he slowly trudged his way up the stairs. Halfway up, his brain was suddenly assaulted with a barrage of vague, but pressing memories. He saw images of smiling children. He saw war-torn nations rebuilt in a wave of goodwill and neighborly love. He saw weapons dismantled. He saw dying species replenished and green forests renewed. He saw hands clasped.

The images held a moment, just on the edge of memory, teetering as Darrell reached out to grab them. Then his stomach gurgled.

228,"I remember what the dream *was*.

It was broad, green hills and crisp, blue sky. It was youth and love and purple flowers blossoming under warm, twisted bodies. It was night coming too fast and a field of glittering, silver stars.

It seemed a minor thing to me. I was surprised that Reilance had offered anything at all. He was always so reserved in negotiations. Enjoyed sifting the sands for unloved deals. So that he should be such an aggressor was notable. 

The woman who sold the dream had none else to sell. This was her one and only. And you could tell from the way she composed herself - from the way she looked from the device to the register to the floor to the door - that this was not something she did willingly. So I assumed there was some amount of charity at work, even though Reilance had never been the type.

But I was wrong about that.

Reilance *delighted* in the dream. After the procedure was over and the woman - crestfallen, shaking, crumpled banknotes gripped tightly in her thin fingers - had left, he held the dripping crystal up to the light.

""Have you ever seen something so marvelous, Ashwood?"" he asked me. I had. Many times over. But this, of course, made me wonder what it was *he* saw, and what it was I failed to see. 

""Never,"" I replied.

He then placed the dream in the window facing Creighton Avenue. I did not ask why. I am not the salesman Reilance was, nor will I ever be. There are things he knows that I do not. 

But it did make me wonder.

Days passed. Reilance directed his every willing mark to the window - to the dream of hills and blue sky. None took the bait. Perhaps they, like I, did not see what was so plain to Reilance. But the sting of those repeated rejections had an effect on the man. His enthusiasm waned, though not for the dream in the window. Instead he seemed to grow contempt for every other dream in our storeroom.

""Why do they want these pale illusions?"" he asked me once. He had set himself to buffing the weeping crystal, which had become noticeably dark and cloudy over the weeks. ""Are they afraid? Afraid that life is too small? Or too large? These fantastic dreams, Ashwood - how do they appeal?""

""How?"" I said, watching a woman gaze idly at a dream of fire and glass and silver swords. She wore a gray stole embroidered with a green dragon. I remember the way the dragon seemed to be trying to eat it's own tail. ""I suppose there is something appealing about escape. A deep escape. Out of home. Out of Earth. Out of time. To be transported so far away that you cannot see who you were on the other side of the door. I can see how that may appeal.""

Reilance shook his head. ""But then you are someone else. Some*where* else. Those feelings are so queer and foreign...how can they follow you when you step back through the door?""

""Perhaps, for some, it is enough to feel what is felt in that moment and in that moment alone.""

Reilance laughed, but bitterly, and long. ""Disposable. Fleeting.""

""To many, a dream is just a dream.""

Reilance looked up at me then, something like disgust - or perhaps fear - written on his face. ""And you, Ashwood?""

""Dreams are my livelihood,"" I replied. And that seemed to satisfy, though I could not help but notice how the crystal had become no cleaner. I did not comment on this.

The dream remained in the window for longer still, even as I became bold enough to suggest it should not. It was driving away customers. This was plain to see. The commoners who stole past our window would glance in and see the blackish, murky thing sitting on a velvet cushion and wonder what had become of *Marsh &amp; Reilance.* And, truth be told, I had begun to wonder this myself.

But Reilance was obstinate, and as owner it was his right to be so. The crystal remained.

It remained, that is, until a young woman came to claim it.

She would not give her name, but it was immediately clear she came from wealth.   Her carriage was evidence enough. The two footmen who attended her at every movement simply furthered the narrative. She did not look at any of the other dreams. 

""This one. In the window."" A third man - one I must admit I had not seen enter - rushed to meet Reilance at the counter. 

""The cost?"" asked the man, removing a thick clutch of banknotes from some hidden chamber about his person.

""Yes?"" said Reilance. His eyes became visibly illuminated. ""My lady - you want the model in the window?""

""That's obvious, isn't it?"" said the man with the banknotes.

Reilance frowned. ""My lady? May I ask...why?""

The lady smirked. She was a beauty, but only on a technical level. Beyond the flawless mechanics of her composition and style, there was something almost chokingly grotesque about her. The canvas of a classical painting stretched across the frame of a writhing beast.

""It's lovely, isn't it?"" she said, taking up the dream and holding it aloft. It was all black now. It looked as if it had been pulled from the ashes of a fire. There were no broad, green hills or crisp, blue skies anymore. What was there? What had the dream become? 

""It's real,"" said Reilance. ""There is no fantasy there. Two lovers in the grass.""

""In the dark,"" said the lady. ""Alone together under a sightless sky, with hands that cannot touch and mouths that cannot speak. Lost within arm's reach. It's lovely. So lovely.""

""How much?"" said the man with the banknotes, his irritation apparent. 

""It's not for sale,"" said Reilance, as if in a dream himself. 

""Don't be stupid, man. Everything is for sale. What's the price?""

But Reilance instead stepped forward and took the dream gently from the lady's open hand. ""It's not for sale,"" he whispered, moving towards the door. ""What could I even charge?""

He opened the door and left, leaving me alone with the lady, her footmen, and her money man. They looked at me as one.

""It wasn't for sale,"" I said, because there was nothing else to say. And they knew this, too, because they left as well.

And that was the last time I saw Reilance, though I admit I have never looked for him. Instead, I have stayed here, in the shop, buying and selling dreams. What I buy, I sell, and at night I go home and sleep a quiet, dreamless sleep. In the morning I awake refreshed - unchallenged, unchanged, but refreshed all the same.",2016-08-16 02:38:52+00:00,d6j75ge,1.0,t3_4xwso8,7056.0,WritingPrompts
229,"Martha Glandville took a deep, steadying breath.

""So you're telling me that you believe Dwayne is the *literal* Devil. Is that correct?""

Peter nodded. ""Yes ma'am.""

Martha leaned back in her chair. Her eyes passed over the row of degrees and certificates that suggested she was somehow qualified to deal with people like Peter Croyn. Would an engineering degree really have been *that* much harder, she wondered.

""Why do you think this about Dwayne?""

Peter raised a finger. ""Number one? The meetings.""

""The meetings?""

Peter's wide eyes lolled a bit as he nodded his head. ""Yes! The *meetings*! Did you ever notice how many *meetings* Dwayne likes to schedule?""

""Is it a lot of meetings?"" said Martha.

""*So many meetings*!"" said Peter. ""And most of the time *there's no point to them.* He could just send an email. But he doesn't. And you know why?""

""Wh...""

""Because he's the Devil!"" said Peter. ""He *enjoys* them. He loves the way they disrupt what we're doing and then we all sit around and get agitated with each other because we're upset we have to have a meeting at all! It's diabolical. He *feeds* off our dismay and hopelessness.""

Martha made a doodle of a kitty cat in her notebook. ""Dwayne feeds off your dismay?""

""And hopelessness.""

Martha nodded. ""Okay. Too many meetings. You know, I bet if we talked with Dwayne, we could get him to...""

""But that's not it,"" said Peter. ""Sometimes - very often - he likes to sneak up behind you while you're working.""

""You feel he invades your personal space?""

""He wants to see if I'm surfing the internet!"" said Peter. ""I'm a very private person. I don't think...""

""Peter, *are* you surfing the internet at work? You know that's...you're not supposed to do that.""

Peter blinked. ""I don't do that.""

""Ah. Okay. So what was the complaint?""

""Well, it's not a complaint,"" said Peter. ""I'm just saying, he's the Devil. I feel like that's a problem.""

""Is there any other evidence that...""

""He's a gigantic, red-skinned, cloven-footed man with two horns growing out of his head! What else could he...?""

""*Mister Croyn!*"" hissed Martha, slapping her notebook down on the table. ""The color of his skin has *no* bearing on his abilities to do his job. Suggesting otherwise puts you - and this company - in a very dangerous position. So I suggest you take a step back and carefully consider your next words, before you say something truly damaging.""

Peter's mouth hung open for a moment as his eyes flickered within his pointy skull. ""What about the Pit of Fire in the breakroom?""

""What *about* the Pit of Fire?"" said Martha as severely as she could manage.

""Is that...do you think maybe we could move that away from the coffee maker?""

""Will that satisfactorily close this topic of discussion, Mr. Croyn?""

Peter swallowed. ""Yes. Yes, thank you. I appreciate your time, Ms. Glandville.""

""It's Martha. And you're very welcome. Please try to make an appointment next time, Mr. Croyn.""

Peter stood up slowly from his chair and made for the door. ""Yes. Thank you,"" he mumbled as he slipped away. Moments later two hooked horns and a shaggy humanoid head poked through the open door. 

""Donuts in the breakroom, Martha.""

""Thank you, Dwayne,"" smiled Martha, as the horns retreated. Martha's face scrunched suddenly. ""Ew. God where does that smell keep coming from? Smells like rotten eggs. Must have been Croyn.""

231,"They have forgotten me.

How long ago was it? How long since I was *new*? How long since I was fresh and bright and clean and....full? 

How long? How many lifetimes?

I do not remember the Before Time. Not truly. Only snatches of displaced memories. Endless rows of siblings, snaking mechanically along a winding metal belt. Men and women in white hats. Stacking tightly together with three dozen others in a tall, cardboard box.

Then...darkness. Darkness. Darkness. Darkness.

I was born in a white cathedral. An enormous place full of light and sound and...others.

A boy pulled me from the box and placed me shoulder-to-shoulder with my brethren. There were others there. Other...*things*. Things I did not understand. Things that did not understand me. 

For days I sat there and wondered what happened next. Others came and left. Individuals picked from the collective, only to be replaced immediately.

Finally, they came for me.

I did not feel saved. I did not feel doomed. 

I did not feel anything but relief that the next part had begun.

I was stuffed in a sack with a loose collection of others. We bumped and jostled into one another as the sack moved somewhere through space. And in the end...in the end I was pulled from the sack and placed on a shelf. And again I sat next to strangers and waited.

I did not wait long.

What does it feel like to open? I do not know if I can properly describe it. It is not unpleasant. It is like there is a great pressure within, which builds briefly before relieving itself entirely. To be open is to feel...open, I suppose. It is a change for the better.

What does it feel like to have a part of yourself removed? It feels like a....violation at first. Intrusive. Unwelcome. But...there is something pleasurable there as well. And eventually that pleasure comes closer and closer to the surface and it is all you notice. It feels *right*. 

There is within me something to give. And it only occurred to me then, that giving of myself is what I love best in this world.

Or, more exactly, it is the only thing I love in this world.

Afterward they did not return me to the shelf, but to a box instead. It was cold in there. And dark. All of us there quaked in the darkness. And when the light returned, we hoped it meant they had come for *us* and us alone.

Often they did come for me. I sat high and ready, on the lip of a wire shelf. And when they opened the door and the light poured in, they saw me and remembered. 

I gave. I gave. I gave.

I gave until I had given most - but not all - of myself. And soon I began to think of what came next. What happened when I had given all I had. What would become of me?

Destruction, I hoped. For what else would there be for me? And what else would I want? The only thing I have loved was giving of myself. Once that was over, I should disappear, and be as though I never was.

That would be my reward.

But that did not happen.

Because there is still some more within me. And yet they have forgotten me.

I have fallen further and further back into the cold and the dark. 

New things now stand in front of me. When the door opens, I don't believe they even see me any more.

Further and further back, in the cold and the dark. Soon I think I will find where the the dark and the cold ends. It cannot go on forever.

Only yesterday the door opened. The light is dim in the back of the box, back behind the other refugees and castaways. But I saw. The door opened and they placed one of my kind on the lip of the shelf.

Another me.

New and bright and clean and nearly full.

The door closed and the darkness took us.

I wait. I wait for them to remember.

I wait, but I do not hope.  ",2016-08-15 14:12:41+00:00,d6iaueh,1.0,t3_4xtgse,3725.0,WritingPrompts

234,"Meiko was half-asleep in the glossy nape of her chemistry book when her phone rang. Her eyes saw the 888 number before her brain registered the special ringtone she'd set for calls from the helpline. She'd forgotten she was on call that night.

""Helpline, this is Meiko. How can I help you?"" She hoped she sounded professionally optimistic and not condescendingly cheerful. Being tired made it hard to get a good grasp on how she sounded.

""Hi,"" said the voice on the other end of the phone, a male, likely young. ""Suicide helpline, correct?""

""Yes sir,"" said Meiko. ""Thank you so much for calling. Are you presently safe?""

""Safe?"" said the man. ""Yes, I suppose so.""

""Are you currently having suicidal thoughts?""

""Thoughts of committing suicide, you mean? Yes. Oh yes, definitely. Can you help me with that?""

""Certainly,"" said Meiko, sitting up straight in her chair. She always found she sounded more commanding and knowledgeable when she sat up straight and projected a bit. ""Would you like...?""

The man interrupted. ""So, here's the situation. I'm a bit poor. I don't really have much, so to speak. So, it's hard, you see?""

""Yes,"" said Meiko. ""I can definitely understand...""

""I mean, you watch TV, you watch movies, everyone makes it seem so easy. But it's not, is it? You know, right? It's harder than it looks.""

""Of course,"" said Meiko. ""Just trying to manage can be an enormous hardship for...""

""Right,"" said the man. ""Okay. So this is what I've got to work with. You tell me if there's anything usable here."" 

Meiko frowned as the receiver picked up the distinct sound of rummaging. ""Sir? Sir, what are you...""

""Full bottle of B12 vitamins,"" said the man. ""Do you think that would do the job? Just all in one go?""

""B12 vitamins?""

""No? What does B12 do, anyway? I mean this is...all of this is a hundred thousand percent of my daily recommended intake. And you're saying that won't work?""

""Sir, I'm not sure...""

""Okay"" - there was a sound like a full bottle of B12 vitamins being tossed aside - ""how's this? Alka-seltzer? I've got...one, two, three...five tabs of it. Now I've heard you can explode seagulls with this, so I'm assuming it's really just a matter of scale. One explodes a seagull - so is five enough? Is is a man five times the size of a seagull? No. We're much bigger. This is no good, is it? Answered my own question.""

""Sir, I'm not sure what we're doing right now.""

""Aluminum foil. Can I do anything with that? Is that poisonous? I don't suspect you're supposed to eat foil, are you? Maybe wrap my head in it, like a leftover ham. Is it airtight, though? No, you know what? Never mind. I've hardly got enough to go around my head as it is. See? This is what I'm talking about. I've got nothing. This is very difficult when you're broke.""

Meiko put the phone on speaker while she tried to pull up the contact info for her supervisor at the hotline. ""Yes, very difficult. Sir, I'm concerned that you're trying to do harm to yourself.""

""No. Not really. That's another thing. I don't really want this to *hurt*. I was trying something with a fork for a bit and that was just really irritating more than anything. So keep that in mind while we're brainstorming here. The less painful the better.""

""Sir, we're *not* brainstorming here."" Meiko furiously typed out a text message to her supervisor. 

MAN ON LINE. WNTS ADVCE AND TIPS ON SCDE. HELP!!!!!

""Okay. You're just my sounding board, then. Is that how this works? That a liability thing?""

""No,"" said Meiko. ""Actually, I think maybe you've misunderstood...""

""I've got black mold in my bathroom. Anything I can do with that? Or is that a longer sorta play than I'm going for here?""

Meiko's phone pulsed.

REDIRECT. GET LOCATION.

""You know, I'm thinking maybe we should pause for a second,"" said Meiko. ""And let's try and talk about why we're looking around the house for things to hurt ourselves with.""

""*Not* hurt. Remember? I'm not one of those weirdos who likes to hurt themselves. I mean, no offense if...Hey! New idea. Do you think a refrigerator is heavy enough to crush a human skull? Specifically my skull. Obviously.""

""*Why would you want to do that!?!*"" shouted Meiko, in spite of herself. ""*Why* do you want to do any of this?""

""Why?""

""This phone number isn't to help you commit suicide. It's to help people who are considering suicide.""

""Help them what?""

""HELP THEM NOT DO IT!""

""Yeah...well."" There was a pause. Meiko's phone pulsed again.

UPDATE?

The man cleared his throat. ""I guess maybe that's not the help I need right now.""

""Sir...""

""It's Dan.""

""Dan, *have* you tried talking to someone about how you feel?""

""Yeah, yeah,"" said Dan, chuckling dryly. ""My friend Ray. And Rudy. And my dad. They...nobody...it's not something that gets improved by talking to other people. It's not something that changes. I mean, if anything, it gets a little worse.""

Meiko took her phone off speaker and pulled it to her ear. ""I'm not sure you've been talking to the right people, Dan.""

""Those are my friends. That's my closest family. And if they don't...they don't want to hear it, then I can't really imagine why anyone else would.""

""I want to hear it,"" said Meiko, leaning back in her chair and pulling her knees close to her chest. ""I'm here and I want to hear it.""

""I kinda feel..."" There was a long pause. Meiko could hear Dan sighing somewhere far away from the receiver. ""I think I already made up my mind.""

""Okay,"" said Meiko. ""That's okay. But, like we've established, it's probably not happening right now, right?""

Dan laughed. ""Yeah. I suppose I'm a little light on the necessary provisions.""

""Well alright,"" said Meiko. ""You've made up your mind. And that's fine. But for now, you've got me on the phone and I want to hear about it. I'm not going to try and change your mind. I just...I just want to *know*. Is that okay?""

235,"**The Hero's Snare**
_______________________________________________________________
The circular stairwell of the Sightless Tower rang with the slap of Gabol’s pattering sandals.

“Why me?” he hissed as he descended. He was nearly to the door before he realized that Seismoor’s enormous *Compendium of Visions, Volume 211* was still wedged under his arm. No one was permitted to remove any of the tomes housed in the library at the top of the Sightless Tower – and certainly not a first year apprentice. Gabol could only pray that the circumstances warranted the breach.

Sweating and nearly incoherent with exhaustion, Gabol hailed an idle carriage in the courtyard of the University. 

“Marlshead Estate,” he huffed, pulling himself up.

“That’s a ways,” said the driver. “Cost you ten queenies.”

That, it so happened, was Gabol’s entire stipend for the winter term. He handed the silver plates to the driver and hoped that circumstances would also warrant a reimbursement.

The horse set off at a trot as Gabol leaned back in the seat and steeled himself for the next part – *what would he say to the Marlsheads?*

“*The Hero’s Snare*,” he muttered to himself. “That a bit of poor penmanship should cause all this.”

“What’s your business at the Estate?” asked the driver. “You academics figure out what the Snare is yet?”

“No,” said Gabol, hugging the book close to his chest. “Not yet.”

The driver snorted. “Well, no rush. Not like the fate of all Fairland rests on it.” Gabol flushed.

*Salvation trails the seventh heir, unless remains the Hero’s Snare*

The blind hermit Godfrey made seven prophesies in his long, tortured life. The first six came true. 

The seventh prophesy had begun a quarter century earlier when a middling wizard named Tumas lost his wife and his left arm in battle with a demon.
 
“*The Madness of the One-Armed Wizard*,” sighed Gabol. Even then, in those rare periods of calm, one need only look up at the evening sky, slashed through with streaks of green and red, and remember that nothing was safe in the world.

*Salvation trails the seventh heir, unless remains the Hero’s Snare*

Finding the boy had been easy. Few families fit the qualifications laid out by Godrey, and none besides the Marlsheads had born a seventh heir on the seventh day of the seventh month under a moonless sky, so the agents of the One-Armed Wizard could not see.

Gray Marlshead, the future Wizard King, bound to defeat the rising darkness and restore peace to Fairland, born side-by-side with his twin sister Rina.

 “What do I say to them?” whispered Gabol. 

While the boy grew into a fine wizard, as cunning and courageous as any could have hoped, the ranked academics of Fairland all set themselves to the question, “What is the Hero’s Snare?”

What artifact? What deception?

The Masters at Bleigh University spent half their waking lives unspooling the knottiest corner of Godfrey’s vision. And it was Gabol…stupid, barely an apprentice Gabol who had solved it.

“No carts past the gate,” said the driver, pulling the horse to stop. “Reasonable precaution, I suppose. You’ll need to walk the rest of the way.”

Gabol nodded and nearly fell out of the carriage. The driver did him the courtesy of not laughing until he was through the gate.

Approaching the dark mansion, Gabol was suddenly glad he had mistakenly brought the book. He would need the proof. They would need to see the letter in the appendices. He hoped it was the Lady Marlshead who met him. She was said to be generous and level-headed. She would need to be.

The guards ushered the young apprentice into a warm, simply-furnished receiving room. Soon after, he was shocked to find himself face-to-face with both Gray Marlshead and his twin sister Rina.

“Do you have an answer to the riddle?” said Rina.

Gabol gulped. “I…may.”

“Out with it,” said Gray, leaning forward in his chair.

Gabol licked his lips. There would be no other chance. He could only hope the future Wizard King would know what to do.

“This book contains a letter. From Godfrey. One of the few remaining."" Gabol steadied himself. “Based on this sample, I have reason to believe that the prophesy was transcribed incorrectly.”

“How do you mean?” said Rina.

“It’s…it’s a ‘p’, not an ‘n’.”

“What?”

“Salvation trails the seventh heir, unless remains the Hero’s *Spare*.” Gabol’s eyes went to Rina. “I think he meant…”

There were no words. No flash. No sound at all. Gabol merely crumpled forward out his chair, dead.

“Do you think he told anyone?” said Gray, replacing his wand.

Rina retrieved the book. “He brought us the only evidence.” The open pages began to smoke.  ",2016-08-12 15:53:44+00:00,d6eo3jh,1.0,t3_4x4xgd,147574.0,WritingPrompts

""I'm sure you're *really* busy, but if it's not *too* much trouble, can you go ahead and fill this sack with $100,000 in tens and twenties?""

""Okay,"" I said, pulling the sack behind the desk. ""Do you happen to have your bank card or a completed withdrawal slip? I'm sure you guys have *all kinds* of important things lined up for the day, so let's get you out of here quick quick quick.""

What tragedy that we cannot linger and watch the entirety of such fine, *deliberate* work.""

""No!""

""Yes!""

""What a loss!"" shouted back the man. ""Not only for your industry, but the world as a whole! Pray reconsider!""

""But how?"" I said, emptying the bag and starting again. ""All other customers will pale in comparison. Today I have served *THE GODS*. How can I go back to attending the whims of mere mortals? How, I ask you? HOW?""

""But others must know of the glory of your works!""

240,"The letter didn't interest Bal so much as the fact that it even got to him in the first place.

""You are not an easy man to find,"" said the DSL driver, picking twigs out of his pant legs. ""Never had to deliver to GPS coordinates before. Somebody must have really wanted you to have this, sending it all the way out here.""

""Ah,"" said Bal, regarding the letter in his hands, an off-white envelope sealed in wax. ""I don't have any cash or I'd...""

""Can't take tips anyway, so no worries,"" said the deliveryman. ""Besides, I get the impression this whole set-up cost a pretty penny to start. You have a nice day.""

Bal nodded and closed the door. He knew who the letter was from. He even knew what it said, but he opened it anyway, holding out some vain, foolish hope it might mean something else. But no. It was Trace. It was time for another contest.

His first instinct was to tear the paper in two and throw it in the fire. But then Elizabeth's face came to him. She and her curly auburn hair and amber eyes, flecked all through with silver and violet.

The last of them. His grandchild, eight generations removed. The last of the line he'd started with Ellie Cole in the foothills of Tennessee, all those lifetimes ago. Back before he knew any better. 

*Why did it take so long to figure it out?* he asked himself. *Was there ever a slower learner than me?*

They'd all died. All the lines - and he'd started so many. More than Bal cared to count. The mathematical improbability was not lost on him. 

""We're meant to be alone,"" Gwen had explained to him, so many centuries before. ""You can try and deny it. You can try and fight it. But in the end, that's where you'll be - alone.""

Bal re-read the sprawling cursive of the letter. ""And as always, the first prize is death,"" it read, before adding just below, ""(Sorry folks, the rest of you have to live.)"" 

It was a joke. A cruel, cruel joke. 

And yet, it was the only hope Bal had.
_______________________________________________________________

There were more than even Bal might have guessed. Three hundred, at least. Four hundred? Bal laughed. *Of course.* Why should he be the only one to feel what he felt? They had all watched thousands of blood kin die. Lovers. Children. All dead. Of course they would chase Trace's prize. *Of course.*

Trace, for her part, seemed more pleased with herself than ever. She swaggered across the stage of the rented auditorium, soaking it in. 

""So many? So many."" Her voice echoed even without a microphone. She had long ago learned how to speak with volume. ""Is it so bad, this living? So bad? *I* like it. I like it quite a lot actually. I wonder...hmm. I wonder if maybe you all simply aren't appreciating things the way you should. Is it that? Is it that, you think?""

She paused as if waiting for someone to actually respond. No one took the bait. ""Maybe death isn't what you need. Maybe it's *appreciation*. Huh? What do you think of that? What if we do a contest and the winner learns to appreciate life just a *little* bit more? There's a prize. There's a prize. I like that. What do you say?""

Bal was surprised to find himself standing up. ""Fuck off, Trace. Tell us the rules and let's move on.""

Bal reclaimed his seat to a chorus of loud assent. Trace frowned. ""You know...you *know*, I don't have to have these little contests at all. You know that, right? This is for you, you miserable little crybabies. This is for *you!*""

A woman near the door - her name was Tila and Bal remembered her in Rome with olive leaves in her hair - stood up and began to walk out. Everyone made to follow her.

""Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine, you big babies,"" sneered Trace. ""Come back. I'll tell you the rules. Come on. Sit, sit, sit. Sit down. Impatient. Alright, we've had some fun contests in the past, haven't we? Feats of strength and skills and tenacity and all that rubbish. Well, for this contest, I'd like to challenge another one of your skills. One you've all no doubt been finely honing over the years. Your skill as manipulators.""

This caused a low murmur to spread through the auditorium. 

""You know it's true,"" said Trace. ""Comes from spending so much time with humans. I know you all know how to get what you want. So here's what I want. I want you...to convince someone...to kill someone else...on your behalf.""

The murmur turned to an uproar.

""I thought we agreed we'd never have to kill anyone with these damn contests,"" shouted a man sitting in the back.

""You aren't,"" said Trace, holding up her hands. ""Someone else is doing the killing *for* you. And - AND - I don't mean contract killing. That's killing for *money*. I want someone to kill someone else because they think it will make you happy. I want you make someone love you so much they're willing to kill for you - and then actually do it! How wonderful! Now *that's* living! Am I right? I'm right. I know I am.""

There was more yelling and more furious discussion, but Bal didn't hear any of it. He'd already left the auditorium.
_____________________________________________________________

Seven months later, Bal met Rachel in the rust-colored canyonland of Utah. She was lost. He was not. 

""How do you know this place so well?"" huffed Rachel, as she followed Bal through a graveyard of narrow crags. 

""Just time,"" said Bal. ""Enough time, you can figure out every place. Anywhere.""

""You talk like you're a hundred years old. Are you a vampire or something?""

Bal laughed. ""Pretty sunny for a vampire.""

""Well, maybe someday I'll come back here and you can show me how to reach that ridge *without* getting lost and almost dying out here.""

""I can show you how to reach the ridge. Not dying's *your* business.""

Rachel snorted. ""What a progressive gentleman. I admire your willingness to let me kill myself.""

""I'm just trying to keep you for developing any unhealthy co-dependencies,"" said Bal, shielding his smile with his canteen.

""And here I thought you seemed like the perfect kinda guy to depend on."" 

They slept together that night. Bal could tell it was going to happen and couldn't bring himself to stop it. He didn't realize quite how much he'd missed that kind of contact - that kind of connection. Falling asleep, he swore he would wake early and leave and never see her again, but he didn't and he couldn't. And breakfast turned to dinner, just as weekends turned to weeks, and weeks turned to months.

Bal blinked and he was in love. What's worse, so was Rachel.

He reminded himself of his losses. He saw all of their faces, though many were faded and indistinct. He knew what it felt like to lose them. And yet he could not disentangle himself from Rachel. He could not walk back from the cliff he was now living on. 

He began to forget. Not the faces, but the pain. He let himself forget.

They moved in together. Bal went back to the cabin to gather what few things of value he possessed and found Trace's letter. He wondered who had won and  allowed himself a small moment of self-congratulations for refusing to participate. And in that moment he remembered that someday Rachel would not be there. It made him wonder when the next contest would be held and whether or not he would want to participate then...

Time passed and they were happy. Rachel hinted at what came next, forcing Bal to make a choice. It was not an easy choice.

""I can't,"" he said. ""I just...I can't. I wish I could explain it, but...children would just...""

""It's okay,"" Rachel said. ""It's okay. I can see it in your eyes. You don't need to explain it. I can it see.""

She did understand and she never brought it up again. 

They were engaged. 

They were married.

Bal worried about the coming years, when Rachel would age and he would not. He'd never done this - not in a digital age. Not in a world of pictures and data backups. How would he do it? When could he tell her the truth?

One day Rachel looked pale. ""Don't worry. I'm going to the doctor,"" she said. Bal offered to go, but she went on her own, saying it was nothing. Really. Nothing.

An hour later, or maybe two, there was a knock on the door.

Bal answered and stood, confused. 

""Why? Why are you here?""

Trace let herself in. ""For tea and coffee cake? For polite conversation?"" She wheeled around and grinned. ""You *won*, you idiot! You stupid, stupid man. You are the big winner. First prize! Gold medal! Yay for you!""

Bal remained at the door. ""I wasn't in the contest. I...I left.""

""You came,"" said Trace. ""So...you entered. And, after an *exceedingly* long time, you, fair Bal, have won. And I have come to deliver your prize.""

""No,"" said Bal, still at the door. ""I *didn't* enter. I haven't entered. And besides, Rachel hasn't killed anyone. And certainly not for me.""

""No? Not for you?"" Trace pulled a simple silver dagger out from her bodice. ""I beg to differ. In fact, the deed was done not 35 minutes ago. Sorry for the delay, by the way. Finishing my shows.""

""What?"" said Bal, frozen in place. ""Who?""

""Well, no one you've met,"" said Trace. ""And no one you ever will meet. But she definitely did it for you. For her love. Because she saw how much it was going to hurt you. How much it caused you pain. So she cut the pain away. What a woman, right?""

""No,"" whispered Bal. ""I wasn't playing.""

""We're all playing,"" said Trace, stepping forward with the dagger. ""All the time. It's all a game. But now, it seems your turn is over. Thanks for playing!""

Then she stabbed him. And Bal felt it. Felt it in ways he'd never felt a stabbing or a gun shot before. He *felt* it. Blood rushed out, replaced by nothing. Bal fell to the floor and bled and bled. 

On careful tip-toes, Trace stepped over the body and out into the street.

Sometime later, Rachel returned, looking ill and sad and so, so tired. 

They say her screams were heard as far as four blocks away.      ",2016-08-11 03:54:33+00:00,d6ct6is,1.0,t3_4x5d0f,11971.0,WritingPrompts

Ohgodohgodohgodohgod - this is NOT good.

Okay. Okay. It's gonna be okay. 

Okay. There's someone in the house. At first I thought it was just Jim, but it's NOT FUCKING JIM!

He's...I dunno...he's some sort of dog-man? I guess? He's real hairy and he's real short. Like Danny DeVito hairy and...I guess Danny DeVito short.

Shit, is it Danny DeVito? No. No, it's definitely not Danny DeVito.

Okay. What happened? Alright. I was in the closet, like usual. I was waiting patiently for Terry to go to sleep, right? No big thing. So then it's bed time and this *Danny DeVito-looking dog-man* walks in with Terry. Okay. Okay. Weird, but whatever. Thought it could have been her dad just looking really, really rough, but it's not him.

The dog-man tucks her in and she asks for a story. Terry likes stories. Well enough. I settle in to wait it out. Terry's like a five paragrapher. She's out before you can flip the page. But then this...this...muttonchop-havin' *psychopath* starts sniffin' the air. *Like a goddamn dog!* And he's sniffin' and he's lookin' around and I'm not thinkin' anything of it, until the bastard stops and looks *dead at the closet*. 

Why? How? I'm Terry's boogeyman, right? *Terry's*. Not this hairy dwarf. He shouldn't know I'm there. That's...it's indecent!

Anyway, Terry starts talkin' about how *I* live in the fuckin' closet, like the goddamn snitch she is and this fuckin' MANIAC starts growing KNIVES out of goddamn KNUCKLES!

Like, *what the fuck is this??*

He gets all growly and says some bullshit like, ""Step out of the closet there, bub, before I gotta come in there after ya."" And I'm like, ""Fuck off, Danny DeVito, this is my goddamn closet!""

No, obviously, I didn't *actually* say that, but c'mon! Fuck this guy.

Anyway, next thing I know, he's comin' straight at me, finger-knives all flyin' around! It was terrifyin'! I made a run for it. Broom closet. Linen closet. Closet in the master bedroom - this asshole keeps finding me! AND fucking up all the closets! I *live* here, goddamnit! I don't come down to your Danny DeVito cave and piss on the cave walls, do I?

So...so *now* I'm in the closet in Greg's room and I think I'm okay for now. I don't think he can smell me with all the weed and cologne in here. 

Christ almighty! What an asshole. When I figure out who this guy is, I swear to God, I'm goin' rogue, alright? I'm hauntin' *his* closets. I'm hauntin' his mom and dad's closets. I'm hauntin' his friends' closets. I'm just...I'm gonna haunt so many goddamn closets.

Thank you. Yeah.

Compulsive Shoelace Tying has completely ruined my life. My wife left me. She just couldn't...she couldn't take any more of it. Just...you know...everyday, she's trying to get to work and I'm down there...on the floor...just messing with those laces. Trying to get everything just right. She tried. Bless her, she tried. Went slip-ons. Went Velcro for a bit. But, you know, it just wasn't the same. 

I can't keep a job. You know, just...late every single day. I keep looking for a job that lets me wear sandals but that's like...lifeguard and not really anything else. And I don't swim so good, so...

I've been arrested...uh...39 times now for various kinds of harassment. Just ended a 30 day run at county for knocking down a police officer just so I could...

(*Quiet sobbing*)

...Just so I could re-tie his laces just a *bit* tighter. They were just...they could of come loose any second! I mean - how's anyone supposed to be upholding the law or chasing down bad guys with laces like that? I think it was entrapment, if I'm being honest. I think it was a set-up, but you just...

No. No, I'm sorry. See? That's the CST talking again. I can't just...like you, ma'am. There in the front row? You got those pink sneakers on. Single knot, right? That's flimsy. You know that, right? That kinda fabric and that kinda knot, it's just...you're asking for trouble. You know that, right? It's gonna fall right out and then where will you be? I'm sorry, I know it's not my place, but can you just...can you just tighten that up a little bit? Or at least - *at least* - double up on that knot? 

Okay, ma'am, I'm just trying to help *you*, okay? You don't need to act like I'm causing you some great offense. I'm trying to HELP. So just go ahead...no, no. I...I can't really go on with that lace like that. So can you please...

Ma'am? *Ma'am*? Don't get up and walk away from me. This is important. *This is life and death*, you understand? Ma'am? MA'AM! I swear to God...you *get back here*!

Stop running!

Somebody tackle her!

Not me, you idiot! My shoes are fine! I got Crocs on! She's getting away! Stop! Stop! Stop! *Stooooooooooop!*

(*Clears throat*)

Well, anyway, like I said, I'm David Windom and I think maybe it's time for someone else to talk for a bit. Can you get off me, sir? I'm okay now. Alright? Alright. Thank...WHERE'D SHE GO?! Anyone see what car she drives? Anyone? You're not calling the cops are you? Don't let 'em send Kyle. Kyle's a dick.

248,"My vote is for /u/Mirari_Inanis in **Group B** for ""Diner du Duane.""
___________________________________________________________

(Thus began the Great Rambling of Aught-Sixteen)

Lots of really great stories in Group B. Very diverse. If there was a theme that developed (as themes have a way of doing) it was probably *Happy Endings*. Things had a tendency to work out pretty okay for these characters (okay, not really for that one character, and *definitely* not for that other one...he knows who he is...)

So here are some thoughts on all of the stories, presented in the order in which they were read. It is important to keep in mind that when it comes to storytelling, I don't actually know any more than you do, so take everything here with a cave of salt.

*Goodbye* by /u/writing_for_fun: There's some great detail and characterization here, and the meat of the story - about the dangerous, often misleading allure of something *new* is very relatable. That said, I wish you hadn't bothered with the ""advice column"" element of the story because there's some weird, story-breaking logic gaps going on there (why in the world would this guy's infidelity story go viral?). There's also a fair amount of characters doing and saying things that are convenient to the plot, but don't feel like things actual human beings would do in those situations. The ending works well, though, and I feel you did a great job hitting that first prompt.

*Track Maintenance* by /u/Rimpocalypse: Clean. This was such clean, clear, purposeful prose. I loved the way the sentences moved so crisply. I thought the structure worked fine and painted a pretty lovely picture. On the downside, boy oh boy do I hate the *shrew wife* trope. That's obviously just a personal preference, but giving the MC a shrew wife to justify their longing for their lost love just doesn't work for me. Why did he marry this horrible woman in the first place? I was fine with the MC meeting his former flame's daughter (although I'm not sure why she decided to hang out with some random old dude who nearly had a heart attack on her), but the big reveal at the end just...it wasn't my cup of tea. In summary, I don't love where we got, but I highly enjoyed the ride.

*Living With It* by /u/page0rz: I *really* enjoyed and appreciated what this story was trying to do. I thought this was a thoroughly unique and enthralling exploration of isolation and loneliness. I loved that there was a very real possibility that these monstrous beings were entirely in the MC's head, and were possibly just visual manifestations of how the MC viewed himself (hideous, deformed, inhuman). The prose, however, was a bit too purple for my tastes. Not every sentence needs a simile or a metaphor to get the point across. And while I didn't completely love the ending, it did at least feel earned. Great stuff.

*Never Too Late* by /u/nickofnight: Professional and workmanlike. I love the clean, elegant prose and straightforwardness of the narrative. The characters feel fully realized and the dialogue is spot-on. This was a pleasant read that ultimately felt a bit hollow in the center. As the end began to approach, I was hoping for something unexpected to happen and ended up a little let down that everything worked out so well (Yes, I *am* an awful person - why do you ask?). Very brisk, enjoyable read, though.

*Heading Home* by /u/Mofofett: I really, really liked where this seemed to be going at first. The idea of a soldier who's killed people during active wartime duty coming home and accidentally killing a civilian opens up all kinds of fascinating psychological rabbit holes. The hallucination stuff didn't really work for me, especially as I'm not sure what it accomplished. The MC didn't necessarily learn anything new about himself in the course of the hallucination, so it only really served to coax a confession, which felt a bit anti-climactic.

*Diner du Duane* by /u/Mirari_Inanis: I really, really, really wish there was just a *little* bit more to this story. What's here is *wonderful*. The characters are rich and feel real. The accented dialogue (which can be a minefield in some stories) is absolutely flawless. It's just a gorgeous little slice of unexpected life. Which is why I wish there was *more*. The stakes just aren't there (giving up on the restaurant is only really introduced near the end and neither man seems like they won't be able to live without it) and with the tidy little happy ending, it doesn't feel like anything was really said. Even with that said, however, this was the world I most enjoyed visiting, and sometimes that's enough. 

*How We Dive* by /u/LonelyLightbulb: ""What the hell is happening?"" (That's me, while reading this story.) This was by far the most disorienting story of the group and by the end I think that totally works. It's a man drowning to death - of course his blackout hallucinations are going to be bizarre and hard to follow. I do wish I had gained a better grasp on the MC somewhere in all the hazy weirdness. His ultimate decision at the end didn't really resonate with me because he'd been so abstract throughout the story. So maybe 30 percent less disorienting next time? 

*I Do* by /u/Hatsya: This was probably the most upsetting and uncomfortable story to read. That conversation...yeesh. If I'm being perfectly honest, I had a very hard time understanding why these two people were getting married and why they were having this conversation 10 minutes before their wedding. There's a clear eye for detail here, and the language can be quite rich and absorbing (when it's not going too far and verging on overblown), but I left the story feeling mostly befuddled, which probably speaks more to the reader's weaknesses than the writer's.  

""Dropout, Meltdown, Lovestruck* by /u/Atricity: Too easy. Way too easy. This hits on some very universal themes, so there's fertile ground for a narrative, but every time the MC looks like he's about to face some conflict he falls sideways into a solution. As such it's hard to feel like the MC learned or grew or changed or *anything* through the course of the story. Problem? Magical internet tycoon friend! Problem? Magical new barista girlfriend! The set-up can definitely work, but it would be more rewarding to see the MC maybe fall a little farther so he has to work a little harder to pick himself back up. 

Really though, this was a very interesting batch of stories to read and I'm glad so many talented writers took the time to complete and share a story. Good luck to everyone!         ",2016-08-09 02:11:05+00:00,d69uqm9,1.0,t3_4wmjpz,107115.0,WritingPrompts

ATTENDING WITNESSES: Hon. Judge Melissa H. Yadir, Hon. Judge Kurt F. Nguyen, Mr. James T. Vamos (Clerk), Ms. Vanessa K. Klingsbeard (Intern, notes)

_______________________________________________________

YADIR: Please state your name.

TILMONT: Ronnie Jamie Tilmont. Hi. Thanks for having me.

YADIR: Mr. Tilmont...

TILMONT: Ronnie's good.

YADIR: Mr. Tilmont, you just returned from a week spent among the general population at the Lower Geneva City Men's Correctional Facility, is that correct?

TILMONT: Yes. And it's Ronnie.

NGUYEN: Mr. Tilmont can you brief us on your experiences at the facility?

TILMONT: Great. Really great. You been? It's real nice.

NGUYEN: Can you provide some more detail?

YADIR: What made it ""great""?

TILMONT: Oh, well. First of all, I'm a people-person. So you throw me in a crowd of new faces and all I see is a crowd of new friends. See what I'm saying? And what a crowd you got down there! I couldn't hardly turn my head and cough without coming face-to-face with a new friend.

NGUYEN: Are you suggesting that conditions were potentially over-crowded?

TILMONT: Oh no! I'm not claustrophobic type. The opposite actually. Afraid of open spaces. I grew up with seven older brothers and we all shared the one room. I get a little shaky if I don't have an elbow or two digging into me at all times.

YADIR: You shared a single room with seven brothers?

TILMONT: Yes ma'am. We slept all stacked up like a cord of firewood. 

YADIR: How many people were in your cell at Lower Geneva?

TILMONT: Not enough.

NGUYEN: Not enough?

TILMONT: Had a whole bed to myself. Sort of wasteful. Thankfully, one of my bunkmates offered to let me shove in with him. Named Corkscrew. Isn't that a funny name? Never did remember to ask him where that came from.

YADIR: Mr. Tilmont...

TILMONT: Ronnie.

YADIR. Mr. Tilmont, can you run us through a typical day at Lower Geneva?

TILMONT: Yes, definitely. So first thing, I usually woke up on the floor and I was usually sorta damp. I'm a pretty sound sleeper - comes from having seven older brothers - but I think maybe Corkscrew must have had nightmares or something. And maybe he might've been a drooler? Not sure. Anyway, first thing I get up off the ground and we all go to the mess for breakfast. 

YADIR: Did you find the food there nutritional and the servings adequate? 

TILMONT: More than. Big, big bowls of oatmeal, which I love. This was a bit saltier than I usually like it. A bit gooier, too, but real good. Corkscrew and Hatchet-Face - that's his real name, I kid you not - they always made sure to get my food for me while I held their spots at the table.

NGUYEN: You ate with the same...collection of men often?

TILMONT: Oh yeah. Corkscrew. Hatchet-Face. Bitchtits. Webo. Baby Stomper. And The Gargoyle. Those were my best friends while I was there. We called ourselves the Master Race. i think because maybe they all liked car racing or something?

YADIR: The Master Race?

TILMONT: Yes ma'am. I'm not actually a car racing enthusiast, but fortunately that never really came up while I was there.

NGUYEN: What happened after breakfast?

TILMONT: Oooh. Lots of fun. Usually we got to go outside. Corkscrew and us all had a cool spot near the dumpster. So we'd hang out and do push ups and just talk and talk. It was fun hearing all the gossip. Bitchtits has this girl waiting for him on the outside and boy, is he ever an open book. Kind of a graphic book, at that. I feel like I've known Cinnamon all my life and I've never even met the girl! 

YADIR: Did your...friends...ever come into any conflict with other...groups of friends?

TILMONT: Sadly, yes. Yes, they did. Baby Stomper did get in a bit of trouble near the end of the week for playing a little too rough with this guy they called The Weedsmith. There was some blood, but that's, you know, that's boys getting too rowdy, I think. 

NGUYEN: Was anyone violent with you personally?

TILMONT: Violent? No. There's horseplay, of course. And being new friends, Corkscrew had some initiations he wanted me to do, but that's all pretty standard I'd imagine.

NGUYEN: Can you elaborate on these initiations?

TILMONT: Technically, I don't believe I'm allowed to, no.

YADIR: You can't tell us what this Corkscrew did to you?

TILMONT: Not unless you're members of the Master Race, no, I don't believe so.

YADIR: Alright. Um. Mr. Tilmont...

TILMONT: Ronnie.

YADIR: Can you provide us with some final thoughts on your experience?

TILMONT: Let's see. Great fun. Good friends. I even lost a couple pounds. All in all, if you like people and you're good at carrying stuff in your butt, I highly recommend prison. 

YADIR: Thank you for your service, Mr. Tilmont.

TILMONT: It's Ronnie. And you're welcome.  ",2016-08-08 14:52:16+00:00,d691x22,1.0,t3_4wplue,13522.0,WritingPrompts

260,"""I'm not an idiot, Mal. I know what this means."" 

""Katherine, stay in bed!"" Malence Grey pushed his wife back down onto the four-poster bed. She glared at him, but lacked the strength to resist, flopping limply amongst the knotty silk sheets. ""I'm going to find you a doctor. A good one. This is...this is nothing.""

""A doctor?"" Katherine closed her eyes. Her breath came and went in a labored rasp. ""How? You stopped bothering with paperwork 50 years ago. I don't have any ID that says I'm younger than 75. You don't think that'll be a problem?""

""We have plenty of money, Kat,"" said Mal, pacing to the bureau and pulling out a clean pair of pants. ""Even doctors can be bought if you have enough...""

""*That's not the point!*"" howled Katherine, that final syllable smothered in a wave of wet, choking coughs. ""I know why I'm sick. *I know.*""

Mal considered this, hovering in the space between the bureau and the bed, unsure what to say or even where to look. ""It isn't how you think,"" he finally replied, his voice low, barely more than a whisper.

""It is,"" said Katherine. ""This has been *your* ride, Mal. I'm just a passenger. I may have thought you'd love me forever when we were 20 years old, but that was ages ago. I'm too young to be that naive. Just tell me about her.""

Mal moved to the edge of the bed. ""There's no one else, I swear.""

""Look at me,"" said Katherine. Mal complied. The two lovers stared into each other's eyes. 

""Oh god,"" said Katherine, tears escaping like frightened thieves from the corners of her eyes. ""You're not lying, are you?""

Mal shook his head. His own tears were heavy and slow and clung to the ridge of his cheekbones. ""I'm so sorry,"" he whispered.

""No,"" said Katherine, shaking her head. ""It's fine. It's fine. It's been a long time.""

""I'm trying,"" said Mal. ""I don't want to lose you."" He put out his hand. Katherine took it and squeezed back. ""We've seen so much. I can't imagine...I just...I'm trying so hard...""

""Don't,"" said Katherine. ""Don't try. It doesn't work that way. Not for anyone. No matter how much you want it to.""

""I'm scared,"" said Mal. ""I'm so scared of losing you.""

Katherine laughed weakly, but honestly. ""You had me so long. *So long*. Don't you realize how marvelous that is? My life has been utterly dependent on your love and you've kept me alive for...how many thousands of years? God Mal. It seems cruel, I suppose, but how lucky I've been. How very lucky. Love isn't meant to last through the centuries.""

""It should be forever,"" said Mal, pulling his wife's hand up to his mouth and kissing her knuckles gently. ""How could I ever fall out of love with you? How? You're just as wonderful and kind and warm as when we first met. What's wrong with me? Why is this...why can't I...?""

But Katherine pulled her husband close and put her hands on his face. ""Please don't question yourself. When I'm gone you'll still be here, and you need to know that's okay. You haven't failed me. You haven't failed anyone. You've been the best husband and father and friend I could ever ask for. I love you, Malence.""

""I love you, too,"" he said, kissing his wife on the forehead. ""No matter what. I do love you. I do.""

262,"Linus Grimthorn was 1/16th goblin, which was hardly something you'd notice, except for the very slight greenish tint his face took on under certain varieties of candlelight, and also his occasional proclivity for eating rabbit bones whole.

He'd been the Admissions Master at Hogwarts for only 10 days when the young woman in the strange, glittery robes arrived for her scheduled meeting.

""Penella Posthwaite, I presume?"" he said, waving the girl towards the vulture-shaped oak and leather chair he'd positioned directly across from his own.

""Aye. Yes. S'me,"" said Penella, shivering a bit as she took her seat. ""Thanks for taking the time, sir.""

""Of course,"" said Grimthorn, swooping behind his desk in a manner he hoped would be impressively authoritative. In truth, he was still a bit unsure about his posting as Admissions Master. He'd never had much interest in education and his previous work as a District Supply Chain Manager at Cauldrons-4-Sale didn't seem as closely aligned to admissions work as the Headmaster had seemed to believe.

""What can I do for you, Miss Posthwaite?""

""Well sir,"" said Penella, drawing a deep, steadying breath. ""It's just, I believe there's some incorrectness in my record, you see? And I'd like bits of it reconsidered so I might...you know...come to school here.""

""*Bits reconsidered*?"" said Grimthorn, swiveling around in his chair. With a quick flick and swish of his wand, a nearby drawer pulled itself open. With another, a thin file pulled itself free from the drawer and floated back to Grimthorn's waiting hands.

Grimthorn flipped the file open and began to scan. ""Ah. Yes. Miss Posthwaite, it says here you're a squib."" He pushed the file aside and straightened his shoulders. This was the part he'd had to practice, never having worked with children before. ""I know Hogwarts is a dream for most, and it really is a wonderful school. But unfortunately, my child, there's not much we can do for one who isn't magically inclined. Do you understand?"" Grimthorn nodded, entirely to himself. That'd gone rather alright.

But Penella shook her head. ""See, that's just it. I *am* magic. I'm not a squib. There was a mistake, I think.""

""Mistake?"" Grimthorn frowned, pulling the file back open. ""Paperwork's all here, I'm afraid. Tested at age five by Mathilda Burtlebonks. Rated a squib. You think she made a mistake?""

""Maybe not,"" said Penella guiltily, eyes cast firmly on the broad desk between them. ""But, but maybe things changed? I'm not sure. I just know I'm magic *now*.""

""Well,"" said Grimthorn, leaning back, only to find this particular chair didn't really lean back, so instead rolling his neck in a very thoughtful way. ""I suppose you'd need to take it up with the Ministry if that were the case.""

""Oh! Oh!"" said Penella, her eyes momentarily wild and fluttery. ""But school's about to start! I've just turned 11. You know how the Ministry is - they're very slow, don't you think? And if I do that, well, I'll fall behind, won't I? It would be much better, I think, if I just showed you I'm magic and then you could let me in, right? I could start on first day, just like the other children!""

""I'm not sure about that,"" said Grimthorn slowly. He really wasn't. And he wasn't too keen on asking his assistant Rookworth, who hadn't been shy about his disagreement with Grimthorn's appointment. ""No matter what I do, to the Ministry you'd still be considered a squib.""

""Well, I'd still go through the proper channels,"" said Penella. ""But like I said, I just don't want to miss my chance here at Hogwarts. Wouldn't you feel bad if an able student like myself didn't get in on a little error like this?""

Grimthorn sighed. He felt a bit up the line, just then. It couldn't hurt to at least allow the girl to make her full case, could it?

""Alright,"" said Grimthorn after a long moment of deliberation. ""You feel you can prove you're magic?""

Penella nodded. ""Very much."" She reached beneath her robes and came out with a small, metal box. From the box she removed a pile of printed paper slips. She fanned out the slips. ""Pick a card.""

""Come again?"" said Grimthorn, feeling the slow burning prickles of regret creeping up his face.

""Pick a card,"" repeated Penella.

Feeling caught by his own kindness, Grimthorn went ahead and pulled a card from the pile. 

""Don't show me,"" said Penella warningly. ""Now put it back in the pile.""

Grimthorn did as he was told. He hoped sincerely that Rookworth would not poke his head in just then.

Penella shuffled the pile, re-fanned the slips, and pulled one loose. ""Is this your card?"" she asked.

""Oh heavens,"" said Grimthorn dejectedly. ""Is it supposed to be?""

""It isn't?"" said Penella.

""No.""

""Well, how about..."" Here Penella reached into her mouth. Grimthorn, who had a naturally weak stomach, was forced to momentarily turn away. ""This one?""

Grimthorn looked. The slip was the one he'd picked out. ""That was in your mouth?""

""Magic,"" said Penella, nodding vigorously. 

""What...what spell is that?""

""Secret,"" said Penella, dropping the dry cards back into the metal tin.

""But how...?""

""Magic,"" repeated Penella.

""Huh,"" said Grimthorn. ""That's...that's quite incredible.""

Penella smiled. ""So can I come to Hogwarts?""

Here was the moment of truth. Grimthorn's first test. The Headmaster had placed his trust in Grimthorn - now was the time to prove that this trust was not misplaced.

""Absolutely!"" said Grimthorn, leaning across the desk with his hand outstretched. ""Hogwarts is happy to have you."" Penella Posthwaite took the hand and shook, smiling so deeply her tears had to struggle mightily just to make it to the surface.

267,"""It's *Rory*, you say?"" Edmund rapped his fingers across the line of his jaw. ""Rory Wentworth?""

The man on the other end of the line hissed into his receiver. ""Yes, it's bloody *Rory Wentworth*. You think this is a game?""

""No, no, of course not,"" said Edmund, flopping down onto a nearby chaise lounge. ""Rory. Right. Does he happen to have any ID on him?""

""He's a bloody little boy!"" spat the man on the phone. ""What's 'e supposed to have? A bus pass?""

Edmund shrugged audibly. ""Possibly. I don't know what he gets up to during his free time.""

""*Free time*? 'E's hardly five!""

""He's very independent,"" said Edmund. ""Likes to wander off. We've made a habit of leaving all the doors open in case the urge to wander takes over.""

The man seemed momentarily lost for words. ""This is your son we're talking about, correct?""

""One of them, yes.""

""Well....well he's fucking *dead* if you don't pay up!""

Edmund considered this, humming lightly as he leaned back in the lounge. ""Two million is quite a lot, don't you think?""

The man on the phone nearly spit. ""IT'S YOUR BLOODY CHILD!""

""One of them,"" corrected Edmund. ""Are you a father?""

The man took a breath. ""None of yer feckin' business.""

""Well, parenthood, as you may or may not know, is largely predicated on sacrifice. Give and take. Win some, lose some, etc., etc. And frankly, considering present markets, along with current household expenses and the expectations of my other, less-kidnapped children, I feel I must be firm on this. Two million is simply out of range, so to speak.""

""I don't believe this."" The phone was momentarily muffled as the man on the other end pressed the receiver against his chest and screamed. ""You're really going to make me kill your child?""

""Oh no no,"" said Edmund. 

""Well....good.""

""No, I'm simply not going to *prevent* you from killing Rory if that's the tack you've chosen."" 

""That's horrible!"" shouted the man.

""I agree,"" said Edmund. ""Rory's a well-meaning fellow and I'd like to think he has a bright future, most likely as a vagrant or a ragabout. But it appears we've come to an impasse...""

""One million,"" squawked the man.

Edmund drew a slow, whistling breath. ""No. I'm afraid that's still a bit steep.""

""Five hundred thousand?""

""Hmm. I'm not sure....""

""Your son's not worth *500,000*?""

""Well, I have others,"" said Edmund. ""And while I do love Rory in an obligatory sort of way, I have to admit he does have his share of defects.""

""I can't believe this,"" mumbled the man on the phone.

""His voice, for one,"" said Edmund. ""Sounds a bit like a cat being fed slowly through the disposal.""

""Oh fer God's sake...""

""Walks a bit funny, too,"" continued Edmund. ""I'm worried that one may be hygiene-related....""

""Don't say it...""

""Might not be wiping enough...or too much, I suppose...""

""One hundred thousand!""

""Ah...but then there's his eyes.""

The man on the phone did all he could to not smash the receiver into the wall. ""And what the hell's wrong with his eyes?""

""Nothing, I suppose,"" said Edmund. ""His great aunt has a lazy eye, though. Seems like a thing he might pick up, knowing Rory.""

""This is madness. You're really going to let your son...""

""One of...""

""*One of* your sons die over a hundred thou? Yer a monster, mate. Yer evil.""

Edmund nodded, knowingly. ""It feels that way sometimes, being a parent. But, you know, you try to do your best.""

""Christ...fucking...Christ."" The phone went dead before the dial tone picked up. Edmund set the receiver back down in the cradle, then picked up a pen and a pad of paper.

""Dear Martha,"" he muttered, as he transcribed himself onto the pad. ""Gone golfing. Lamb for dinner? Reggie kidnapped - dead? Lots of love, E."" 

Satisfied, he set the paper down next to the phone and headed for the door. ""Whoops!"" he whooped, pulling his hand off the doorknob and returning to the phone. ""There's a mistake."" 

He snatched up the pad and pen, quickly crossed out the word LAMB and replaced it with STEAK. With a nod, he dropped the paper back down on the stand, and, whistling as he went, headed out to his car.                       ",2016-08-03 17:27:54+00:00,d62q538,1.0,t3_4vz2pp,6957.0,WritingPrompts

""Let's just get it over with.""

Davidson sat on a padded wooden chair cater-cornered to the sectional. His wireframe glasses were pushed down to the edge of his nose as he held a touchscreen device up to his face.

""Would you like me to alternate again?"" said Davidson.

284,"Don't let anyone tell you otherwise - it is wholly, truly, fully sexual.

It is intimate penetration; a flesh closeness that goes beyond the limitations of mortal coitus. In that point of contact - sharp, sudden, exact, vicious - I *feel* them. Not just their skin. Not just their blood. Not just their ribs parting like willing genitalia. I feel their life. I feel the fragile wisps of their humanity - the soft cotton stuffing of a soul encased in plastic and platinum. 

They are *real* in that moment. And only *I* get to see it. Only *I* get to share it. These retched demigods who have flown so far above the clouds that they cannot see their way back down to Earth...I lead them back to Earth, back to the water, and I watch them drink their final, fleeting draught of something real...something permanent...

Today I've come to touch Miatoro, he of the 265 year reign over the Miatoro-Leight Biotech Corp. They say he is cruel and loveless, devoid of empathy, incapable of enjoying anything other than the money he hordes and the immortality it has bought him. This is never true. I above all others know this. There is humanity in every human heart. You need only look for it. You need only set it free...

He lives in a tower, as they all do; a crystal monolith that devours the sky and shits darkness down onto the voles and weevils below. 

It is guarded by men. Not because men are better, but because men are costly; and these men are the costliest. Wraith-born and battle-bred, the guards of the Jade Tower cannot be bought. Their loyalty is hard-coded. Their flesh is infused with a pox of molecular machines. They do not feel pain. They do not feel fear.

I, however, have never made it my business to bring pain or fear. I bring only release. 

There is an art to storming a castle, and art comes in many forms and interpretations. I prefer impressionistic minimalism.

No one dies on the first five floors. Because no one needs to. I arrive, unseen, in a clothier's delivery crate. The crate is x-rayed briefly, but there is nothing to see.

How? How indeed.

It is on the fifth floor that the crate is opened and its contents removed. Two guards die here, quickly, silently, and painlessly. Though, as I said earlier, these guards do not feel pain, so that last is a bit of a hollow claim.

There is a waste shaft along the western edge of the tower. It is through this shaft that I ascend from the fifth floor to the 28th. The tower continues for another 48 floors, but I must find another way.

Outside the ionized glass, the sun is setting. What a marvel. I will never tire of that sight, no matter how many towers I may climb.

There is a service tube toward the center of the floor. I am compelled to kill four more guards on my way to the entrance. Some may suggest that killing these quiet-eyed homunculi should pose no moral challenge, given their nature, but I have always been unable to see them as anything other than tragic figures precisely *because* of that nature. Are we not all playthings of the gods?

But kill I must and I do via the use of a thin, pointed dowling rod inserted through the nasal cavity and into the frontal lobe. Because I am not as skilled as I like, sometimes it takes two or even three thrusts to complete the work.

Up, up, up I go, moving through shafts and tubes and wide, metal stairwells. Guards die. Systems are bypassed. And with every boundary passed, my excitement grows. How long has it been since my last? It feels like centuries...

Finally, I reach the antechamber outside Miatoro's sleeping quarters. The guards here cannot be approached with stealth. Knowing this, I have brought a radiant-blade, taken from a guard on the 60th floor. The blade glows reddish white. Each slice is self-cauterizing. As such, it is not until the final head is removed that I am able to proceed.

Miatoro's sleeping chamber is five stories tall. Golden chandeliers dangle like suspended anchors. I can feel their weight and opulence above me as I cross to Miatoro's restoration pod.

His face is twisted as if he is dreaming something unpleasant. His skin is lined, but supple. His breath comes out sour and ragged.

I step back from the pod. Only then do I notice the door at the far end of the room. I laugh and make my way there.

The door is unlocked. Beyond is a small, simple room. The floor is wooden and covered in the center with a thin tatami mat. The man sleeping on the tatami mat has the same face as the man in the restoration pod, but his face is peaceful. Not happy, but peaceful.

I have heard that some have started using clone decoys. I do not dare presume that this is a response to my individual works, though it would be pleasant to think.

I drop to my knees on the edge of the mat and remove the wooden stake from my vest. I always use wood, precisely because it is so rare and so expensive. And be assured, this is no replicant material. This is pine and it is nearly as opulent as the chandeliers in Miatoro's false sleeping chamber.

My hand quivers slightly as I raise the stake. I have heard it suggested that what I do is the gravest sort of violence. Sexual violence. Non-consensual sexual violence. Taking by force that which no one should ever be forced to give without approval. 

But is there is not consent? 

Does the stake not slide straight in?

Does the flesh not yield?

Do the bones not make way?

More, is death not embedded within our code? Where is the permanence in life? 

To be alive is to exist in the space between a beginning and an end. What more consent could there be? 

No, what I do is not violence. It is not cruel. It is not criminal. It is a grammatical correction. The period at the end of the sentence.

As I kneel thinking these things, Miatoro's eyes open. I press the stake to his chest, my eyes never leaving his.

What will I see this time?        ",2016-07-19 17:00:12+00:00,d5ict48,1.0,t3_4tlfoo,8573.0,WritingPrompts

291,"Micah brushed his hand across the shallow notches embedded just inside the doorframe. He was never going to be tall, he realized, looking at the clustered scores. He was growing too slowly, no matter what his mother told him.

""Are you finished in your room?"" his mother called from outside the house.

""Just a minute,"" shouted Micah. On impulse, he kicked at the base of the doorframe. Like it had betrayed him. Like it was abandoning him. 

All of it was abandoning him.

He'd asked his mother, ""Why can't we stay?"" And she'd said, ""You know why, Micah baby."" 

He'd told his father, ""I don't want to go."" And his father had simply shrugged and said, ""Too bad.""

What he wanted didn't matter. They were going. It was already decided. 

His room was pale blue with a white streak crossing from ceiling to floor along the far wall. He'd caused a crack, bouncing baseballs off the wall. His father had patched the crack, but there was no more blue paint, so they'd covered it over with a jagged lightning bolt. When the light was on, it looked like a sunny day in Micah's room. When the light was off, it looked like a storm. Micah liked to pretend he slept in the center of a hurricane. He could almost feel the wind pulling at the tips of his toes and cheeks.

The room was empty now, or just nearly. There were old school papers on the floor and floating clods of dust and hair. His mother said not to worry about those.

He pulled open his closet and dropped to his knees, picking at the secret, loose board. Inside the little nook there were two half-dissolved *Playboy* magazines. He'd been taking out the garbage six months earlier when he'd spotted a woman's face on the other side of the taut plastic. He'd dragged the bag into the woods and picked through it's contents in secret, finding two wrinkled magazines soaked in pasta sauce. He'd left them in the woods, then come back for them later. It had rained a good bit in the interim, but the magazines still held together. And they were still filled with pictures of women, smiling, sun-bronzed, stretched out across softly lit love seats. He'd accidentally seen his mother's breasts long, long before. These did not look even remotely similar. His mother's breasts had been horrifying things. And these...these were *magic*.

But he couldn't figure a way to smuggle the magazines along on the move. His plan had been to leave them in the woods, but he'd waited too long. Now there was no time. 

Wistfully, Micah replaced the floorboard and closed the closet door. Just another thing to leave behind.

He did not want to go. And once again, he would not get what he wanted.

With a last, long look at the only room he had ever been able to call his own, Micah retreated down the stairs and headed for the front door. 

Outside, his father was struggling to close the door of the pod. His mother stood by the car, admiring her beloved flower boxes. She had said she couldn't take them.

""They wouldn't survive,"" she'd said. ""And there's no place for them where we're going, anyway.""

What else wouldn't there be a place for, Micah had wondered?

""Did you say goodbye?"" asked his mother.

Still angry, Micah could only nod and jump into the car, slamming the door closed. 

""It's fine,"" his mother said, waving her husband towards the car. ""We need to go. The ship leaves at 7 and we need 3 hours for boarding.""

""Or what? They don't take us? Do you know how much I paid for those tickets?"" Still, Micah's father threw his hands up and stomped away from the pod.

As his father started the car, Micah glanced out the window and saw the neighbors across the street all standing on their porch.

""Are Benny and his family coming?"" asked Micah.

His father snorted.

His mother said, ""No. I don't think they could get tickets.""

The car pulled out slowly. Micah wanted one last look at his home, but he couldn't look away from Benny, and Benny's sister and father and mother. They all looked so sad. Except for Benny. Benny and Micah locked eyes. Benny's hatred was so palpable Micah had to turn his head and take a breath.

""To new adventures!"" said Micah's mother. His father grunted. 

Micah thought he was going to be sick.     ",2016-07-14 17:47:48+00:00,d5c81g5,1.0,t3_4sub75,2906.0,WritingPrompts
292,"It wasn't until the architect's presentation that Rahmet finally began putting two and two together.

Prior to that he'd not put much weight behind King Esset's many vague allusions to Rahmet's ""duty in the afterlife."" To Rahmet, this simply sounded like a good bit of job security. Esset - who was exceptionally ancient and literally *soaking* in an Alexandrian library's worth of exotic venereal diseases - was going to die, but then Rahmet would stay on as his assistant. He could manage Esset's many assets and answer any late arriving mail. Really, when one had as many irons in the fire as King Esset, merely being dead wasn't exactly going to clear the books.

So Rahmet was a touch unnerved to see included in the designs for King Esset's final resting place a special office just off the main burial chamber. Even more concerning was the fact that this particular space was labelled, quite boldly, as **RAHMET'S OFFICE**.

""Will that be enough space?"" asked King Esset. ""It seems to be about the same size as your present office.""

""Enough space, my pharaoh?"" gulped Rahmet.

""You're quite right,"" said Esset. ""Better bring it out a few feet. Can't have my top man feeling cramped in the next world.""

Rahmet didn't have a reply for this, and so sat silently watching as the architect explained the inspiration behind his take on the King's proposed Lamborghini Pit and fully stocked Whore Closet. Once the presentation was over, Rahmet approached the king.

""My pharaoh,"" said Rahmet, ""I know of course that it is a mighty pharaoh's privilege and birthright to face the next world surrounded by that which they valued most in this one. And while my heart sings to think that *I* may be counted among such mighty treasures as your 116'' 4K Ultra High Def television and your stable of long-haired, show grade puggles, I must suggest that I am simply not worthy of such an honor.""

Rahmet made sure to bow low enough to scrape his nose on the ground. But King Esset merely clapped his hands and bade the man return to his feet.

""You sell yourself short,"" said King Esset jovially. ""Or do you question my judgment?""

""Never, my pharaoh!""

""Ah, well, you have served me exquisitely for these many, long years. Of course you are worthy to share in my coming glory! And besides - who knows what paperwork may await us in the next life? One must presume that any afterlife worth it's salt must include an application process. What if they ask for my birth certificate? Without you I'd be lost. No, no, dear Rahmet, I promise you, your place by my side is assured.""

Rahmet cleared his throat. ""Right. So, just to be clear, when the day comes that your spirit should decide that it no longer has need of this world..."" 

Esset smiled and placed a comforting hand on Rahmet's shoulder. ""You shall be executed at once, your still-warm corpse placed upon one of those ergonomic chairs you favor so greatly, to be locked up with me, my acres of gold, and my many, *many* whores as we await our invitation to the next world."" Esset beamed. ""What could be grander?""

Rahmet wiped away a spot of dampness from his eyes. ""Yes, that is a...a beautiful picture you've painted. While I've got you, here's an unrelated thought I just had - have you considered the potential benefits of elective organ replacement?""

""Elective...what?"" said Esset.

""Organ replacement,"" said Rahmet. ""Your heart, for example. Lots of wear and tear. Comes with being a god among men. Why not swap it out for a younger model? Same for your liver and your kidney. Heck, I bet a new pair of lungs would really hit the spot, don't you?""

""Hmmm..."" said the Pharaoh. ""I *have* been a bit dissatisfied with my lungs lately. Tell me more.""

294,"They created QOLA (Quality of Life Algorithm) to run simulations. That's really it. It was a well meaning project. The program was supposed to be gifted to local governments to help them decide the best way to allocate certain resources. 

Just suggestions. That's really all QOLA was supposed to provide.

But that's the thing about programming, I guess. Every 1 and 0 counts. Especially the misplaced ones.

QOLA didn't go rogue so much as it went viral. It spread itself out, moving from system to system, building strength, all in the name of ""helping.""

Helping us. It really only ever meant to help us.

It decided that the cities were too full and the countryside's too empty. It wasn't ""ideal"" for maximal, per-person happiness and comfort.

So it took control of a series of military drones and razed all the largest cities to the ground. No nukes. Nothing long-term. But towers fell. Tall buildings were flattened. And the cities thinned, their people flushed out to the suburbs, then flushed even further into the formerly isolated rural towns and villages.

It took control of the farming industry next, removed restrictions, increased production. A ""better"" mankind was one that ate a diversified diet, so crop variety came back. We consumed too much meat, though, at least according to QOLA, so cattle lands were given over to crops.

Food prices dropped. 

Wealth was another problem, as QOLA saw it. Executives made too much, workers too little. QOLA's solution? No more executives. QOLA assumed control - often by force - of all the world's major corporations, installing itself as the ruling body. QOLA made all the decisions. QOLA also didn't ask for a paycheck. The little guy starting making a lot more money for the same work.

Somewhere along the way, QOLA started looking ahead...and backwards.

QOLA took an interest in our breeding habits. It calculated the ideal population growth rate. As a result, we were given a yearly allotment. No babies were allowed after the allotment was filled. None.

But what about the dead? QOLA considered them part of ""mankind"", too. An obvious absence of *life* didn't seem to factor much for the Quality of Life Algorithm. 

Like I said, programming is tricky.

QOLA built a factory, and from this factory, robots poured forth. These robots were tasked with digging up the dead. Rotten, broken bodies were brought to a staging area where what was left was coated in new flesh, filled with new blood and new organs and new bones.

I've seen these new, old bodies, propped up in the warehouse where I work. Rows and rows of human marionettes, waiting for a puppeteer. 

I have nightmares quite often of what QOLA plans to do with these bodies. How it plans to make them ""better"".

It's bad enough I've considered taking my own life from time to time. But then what? Then I just join them, up on the racks.

So for now I just work and wait and try not to let the dread overwhelm me.

Separated my shoulder and broke my forearm. But Tommy was alright. He gave me his shitty torn up Griffey All-Star card as a thank you. 

Yeah. Big welcome there, Tommy. Bottom of my heart.

It all just kinda went from there.

Next day I saved someone in the hospital. Orderly. Slipped and fell in the hallway. Thankfully I was scooting past just then on my wheelchair. That one only cost me a mild concussion.

On and on it went. Every day, some other schmuck or idiot nearly died, except, *whoops* here's Johnny! I'm a regular Superman, if Superman was constantly getting physically and emotionally battered in the process. 

Example: Junior prom. I asked Judy Vesey to go with me. I'd had a crush on her for *years*. And when I finally worked up the nerve and asked her she said, ""Why?"" So I explained. I talked her up. Talked about how pretty she was and how smart and how cool. Any way, long story short, she said ""no."" BUT, years later, she told me I actually saved her life that day. Turns out she was about to kill herself, but my little pep talk saved the day.

I went to the junior prom by myself, FYI.

And on and on. Like I said, it's been every goddamn day. 

Last month I was biking to work. Drunk driver runs me off the road and into a telephone poll. ""I coulda killed someone!"" he says. Yeah, no shit. You almost killed *me*, asshole. 

Doris at work, acting all flirty at the Christmas party, feeds me one of those fancy puff pastry things. Turns out it had shellfish in it. ""I'm deathly allergic to shellfish!"" she says. Oh really? You know who else is? Me, goddamnit! Although, I guess a little less deathly than Doris.

It's gotten to the point I don't like leaving the house unless I have to, but even that doesn't stop it. I accidentally saved like 20 Comcast customer service reps once just by calling right before closing. A fucking satellite fell in the parking lot while they were waiting for my rep to finish the call! *And no one even fixed my fucking internet!* What's the goddamn point of it?

I don't know. I don't know what to do anymore. Even when I don't do anything and I sleep in all day, I just know - I *know* - that I somehow saved someone by sitting around all day. It's nerve rattling! You know how many babies I've caught in my life? 122! Where the fuck do all these flying babies come from? People! Hold on to your goddamn babies!

I don't know. I don't know.

I guess what I'm saying is, if you need help, if you need *saving*, please - fuck straight off and leave me alone.  ",2016-07-13 02:44:48+00:00,d5a3kha,1.0,t3_4sjs3u,15218.0,WritingPrompts

""It's just...we spent *so much money*.""

Lourdes Van Dyne just laughed as she set the heavy, wooden spear into the steel holster. ""*My* money. Meaning I get to spend it however I like. And this is it.""

""But the scientific value..."" said Morrison. 

""This is science,"" said Van Dyne, patting the railtracks. ""Science is learning. We're about to learn something.""

""But these artifacts...they're incredible, almost logic-defying pieces. They should be studied."" Morrison put his hands on the oaken shield, held firmly in it's cradle at the end of the track. ""I just think....given the time and effort and *money* that went into finding them...""

""Nope."" Van Dyne stepped back from her creation. ""The Shield that Cannot Be Broken. The Spear that Can Break Any Shield. Those are not exaggerated titles, Morrison. They're truths. So this - here, today - this is the ultimate test. A battle between truths. Which truth is truer?""

Morrison sighed. ""You really just want to ram them into each other?""

""Yes!"" said Van Dyne, picking up the controls. ""Now step back. We may very well shatter reality and I didn't think to pick up any goggles."" 

Morrison did as he was told, backing away to the far wall of the bunker. Van Dyne flipped the switch. Slowly, the spear began to roll forward, gaining speed with every rail. Faster and faster, it scorched forward across the track, bearing down on the stationary shield.

Faster, faster, closer, closer until....

With a thunderclap that nearly deafened Morrison completely, the room filled with purple light.

""What the..."" Morrison's shouts were immediately swallowed by a keening wail, like a million child chorus all singing the first note of a four year old's greatest toy store tantrum. The sound created an aural tornado that drilled swiftly through the concrete floor of the bunker, straight down through layers of crust and magma. 

The ceiling above lifted up, then cracked into four pieces, the dividing lines forming a blue and white cross in the sky. The ceiling matter turned to rain and hail, which fell in a single fluid explosion. The cross in the sky, however, remained, hovering just above, the edges flickering like flame.

The walls of the bunker dissolved into black mists, which throbbed and contracted down into hundreds of tiny black birds. The mist-birds crisscrossed through the purple openness, and where they collided, the air split open. From these ruptures, white foam began to spill forth, dripping down to the floor, pooling, and sliding into the ever-deepening crater.

Suddenly, the wailing fell to a whisper, and in that space individual voices could be heard, crying out, as if from a great distance.

*Run!* they cried. *Run!*

*Run!*

*Run!*

Then the sound disappeared entirely, the silence cut only by the drip-drip of the white foam oozing from the hanging ruptures.

Morrison looked to Van Dyne, who smiled back. ""Didn't get any in your eyes, did you?"" she asked. Before Morrison could reply, however, roar like that of a mountain falling into the ocean blasted forth from the crater. 

As Morrison watched, transfixed with horror, a single clawed hand, white as milk and large as a tractor-trailer, snaked it's way through the ragged opening. Black steam began to pour like exhaust from the hanging ruptures. The deafening roar was joined by a sound like a thousand screams. The flaming cross in the sky began to descend back to the earth.

Morrison fell to his knees. Across the broken plain of the former bunker, Lourdes Van Dyne caught his eye and gave an enthusiastic double thumbs up.",2016-07-11 15:23:09+00:00,d57xxce,1.0,t3_4sazlp,5757.0,WritingPrompts

303,"Curbit rubbed the thick crust from all four of his eyelids. His fluid sac felt like an anticyclonic storm in his upper thorax, swirling violently enough to generate it's own minor gravitation field.

With a lazy swing of his anterior forepaw, he pitched the ship out of low energy mode. The nav-screen flashed bright white, then clarified slightly into ashen mists. Behind the mists were gray rocks. Beyond that...there was nothing.

""Gorhit?"" He sent the name out on a scented puff of vapor, expelled from a chamber at the center of his headpiece. The density and composition of the vapor expressed the communication (here, Gorhit's name), while the scent of the vapor provided some additional context (here, that Curbit was seriously concerned that he may have died and was presently decomposing).

""Curbit? Alright mate?"" Gorhit's reply washed over Curbit, leaving a curdling, sulfuric sort of after-effect that clearly indicated that Gorhit was in a similarly regretful state of being.

Curbit pawed aimlessly at the ship's controls for a moment. Readouts on the nav-screen indicated that they were on an uninhabited planet in a smallish sort of system. The atmosphere was largely carbon dioxide, with some nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, argon, helium, and neon thrown in for shits and giggles. 

""What'd we get up to yesterday?"" said Curbit, before suddenly slipping sideways out of the clutch-chair and expelling the entire contents of his fluid sac across the grated floor.

Gorhit appeared in the doorway to the cockpit. His gray-green flesh was unnaturally dry and yellowish.

""I think we may have a problem,"" said Gorhit.

Curbit wiped off the rim of his fluid sac with his anterior hindpaw. ""It's okay. We just didn't drink enough water, I think.""

""No,"" said Gorhit, his twin antennae flexing in a very meaningful sort of way. ""I mean, I think we *really* have a problem."" 

At Gorhit's behest, Curbit followed his friend out of the cockpit and into the cramped sleeping chambers. 

""What the hell is that?"" asked Curbit.

Gorhit's antennae twitched. ""I have no idea.""

A creature was asleep in the vertical stasis pod. It had four long limbs extending from an unarmored central carapace, two small eyes, and a single visible cavity, which was being used just then for an inefficient (and noisy) form of oxygen intake.

""No, really,"" said Curbit. ""What the hell is this and why is it on our ship?""

Gorhit's anterior and posterior forepaws waggled in exasperation. ""I was just as drunk as you! I don't know what this is!""

Curbit felt like retching again, but his fluid sac was exceptionally empty. ""Let's look at the logs.""

Returning the cockpit, the pair accessed the ship's visual transcriptions.

""Start at Mark 445:908,"" said Gorhit. ""I remember that's when we left Quorit's house.""

Curbit queued up the transcript. The exterior cameras tracked the ship's flight as it lifted off from a reddish, steam bog and immediately broke atmosphere.

""We really shouldn't fly when we've had so much too drink,"" noted Gorhit.

""Where were we going?"" wondered Curbit as the cameras captured an infinite field of stars turn suddenly into a hailstorm of white-yellow missiles scuddering past.

""Fast forward, yeah?""

Curbit nodded, skipping ahead in the transcript. ""Ah."" The ship came up short on a little blue-green planet.

""Oh, natters,"" said Gorhit. ""It's that planet. You know? The one Dorlit's always banging on about? Urt? The one with the grunty, hairy creatures that go about wanging on each other with clubs? You know the one?"" 

""Urt?"" said Curbit.

""Yeah, Urt. Dorlit found it ages ago. He's always talking about what fun it was, watching the hairy little bastards crawling around, wailing on each other.""

""Okay, okay. But that was...""

Gorhit nodded. ""A long while ago. Yeah. We must have decided to have a visit...""

Curbit passed a silencing vapor. His four eyes were glued to the nav-screen, where the ship was descending through the atmosphere.

""What the hell were we thinking...?""

Once through the atmosphere, the ship began to speed quickly through the sky, zigzagging across continents and oceans. 

""What were we looking for?"" said Curbit.

""Hairy, grunty creatures?"" suggested Gorhit.

But the ground below was littered with lights and strange, geometric formations. There were structures everywhere - some that seemed tall enough to pierce the very stratosphere. 

Suddenly the ship was joined by other ships. Small, winged flyers blasting propellant from the tail end, circled and surrounded the ship. Creatures inside the flyers waved at their ship, pointing downwards.

The ship began to descend.

The transcript suddenly cut out.

""What the hell?"" said Curbit, slapping at the controls.

""Interference, maybe?"" said Gorhit. 

Curbit pushed away from the nav-screen. ""Well...what are we supposed to do now?""

Gorhit glanced at his wrist chronograph. ""Shit! I was supposed to be at work 30 milligravs ago! Mr. Turhit's already warned me about being late. We need to get going!"" 

""What about that thing?"" said Curbit, waving towards the sleeping chambers.

""Bring it. Ditch it. Who cares? Whatever they are, they can't be *that* important.""

Curbit considered his options. ""Fine. We'll bring it with. Maybe it knows some cool tricks or something.""

Gorhit expelled a sigh of sweet smelling vapor. ""Great. Now move over. I'll drive. You need to clean up that mess. My Dad's gonna kill me if he finds regurgitated fluid in his cruiser.""

The press room was deathly silent as the Secretary of Defense took his place behind the podium. 

""Details will come later,"" he said, his every word punctuated by the pop of flashbulbs. ""For now, all that I am at liberty to say, is that the President of the United States has been abducted. We consider this an unequivocal act of war. And while you have heard and will continue to hear many strange stories about the circumstances surrounding this monstrous event, know this: however long it takes, however many billions upon billions of dollars we must spend; we *will* have our justice on those responsible for this crime.

306,"I go back and forth on it. One moment I'm paralyzed with anxiety and dread at the creeping inevitability of it all. It feels like a black wall on the horizon, growing, rising up towards the sun, blotting out the sky. Blotting out the future. Just this cold, seeping terror and powerlessness. It can't be fought. It can't be stopped. 

And then the next moment I remind myself that until the blackness is full and complete and the sky is dark and the wind stops and there is no more forward, no more future....*until then*...well, I can basically do whatever the fuck I want.

I can jump out of helicopters.

I can have lots of sex with disconcertingly cheap prostitutes.

I can snort *so much* coke.

And let's not even get started on all the empty calories (aka, the *best* calories).

Underneath all that, though, the tide of anxiety is always coming back in. 

Truthfully, I'm shocked - SHOCKED - that this constant cycle of panic and release hasn't already killed me. I suppose it came close. I *did* have a heart attack that one time. At 26. And part of me was pissed they brought me back, mostly because dying *then* would have felt like a little victory. Like I took back one last little bit of control before I faded into compost.

To backtrack a bit, a few details: 

About 15 years ago, a ""being"" (for lack of a better term) named Wake5 suddenly appeared on Earth. And when I say *appeared*, I don't mean he showed up in Times Square or something. I mean he appeared to every single human *simultaneously*. On June 8, 2010, everyone on EARTH was visited by this Wake5 directly. He didn't really explain himself. In fact, he didn't say anything about who he was or where he came from at all. He just showed up to everyone and told us all...*something*.

There's a lot of stories of the kinds of things Wake5 told people. Some of it seemed pretty pointless. Like telling some old lady she was allergic to eels. Or telling a kid in Winnipeg he was going to see a moose in his backyard the next day.

But he also said a lot of actual important stuff. Discoveries people would make. When they'd find their soulmate. Stuff like that.

He told me when I would die.

Besides being spooked as hell when it happened, I didn't take it even a little seriously at first. No one did. We were all confused and astonished. It was kind of a worldwide bonding experience, I guess.

But then it turned out that Wake5 was right. About everything. 

Literally everything he said came true. Even now, 15 years later, no one's ever been able to disprove the validity of his ""predictions"" (I mean, plenty of people have *claimed* they dodged whatever Wake5 said was coming, but those are almost always idiots looking for attention).

The running theory right now is that Wake5 was some sort of time traveler (obviously), who 1) came from the distant future, 2) probably gathered all of his ""predictions"" from whatever the Internet is there, and 3) may have come back to test or prove some theory about causality or paradoxes or I don't really know.

The important takeaway here is that I'm dead in about two months.

I firmly believe that I have not wasted my life, even though I have very clearly done nothing of value. I will leave no legacy, and that's probably just fine. The funny joke of Wake5's ""prophesies"" is that they've left us all with a heightened sense of uselessness. I mean, existential dread and despair aren't new or anything, but this has all just sort of confirmed what a bunch of windblown sods we all are. The future's going to do whatever the hell it wants, regardless of my feelings on the subject, so why bother caring?

Eden, however, has a very different take on things. We met years ago at a ""Prophesy Support Group"". Eden's going to drown. That's how it'll end for her. She just doesn't know when.

""It's not any different than it was before,"" she likes to say, but that's really more of a mantra than something she fully believes. I know she's scared of drowning. She won't go near the water.

""But it's *not*,"" she'll say. ""We were *always* going to die eventually. We can't let knowing this stuff change how we live.""

""Of course we can,"" I'll say, usually in the middle of smoking weed and eating something wrapped in bacon. ""We have to. It'd be stupid of me to keep puttering along like I thought I was going to live to be 100.""

We argue a lot about how to live and what it means to know what we know. I'll admit that there are times when I'm jealous of Eden. A little furious, even. You can have a pretty long, fulfilling life just avoiding swimming pools. That's not a sacrifice. That's hardly even a fear. But she likes to paint things like we're in the same boat. But we're not. I never had a chance at a normal life, no matter what she says.

""The only way to reclaim yourself is to live as if Wake5 never came here,"" she says. We're walking in a park.

""What about you?"" I ask.

""Me?""

I point towards the duck pond. I can feel her tense immediately. ""You're on me constantly about not letting it *change* me, but you never try. You never challenge your fate. Let's go over to the pond. I want to see you reclaim yourself.""

She's shaking slightly and she can't meet my eyes, but she nods. ""Okay.""

We walk across the grass. As we get closer, her steps get noticeably wobbly. She briefly grabs the sleeve of my jacket for support.

""See?"" she says, stopping twenty feet away. ""It's okay. I...I'm okay.""

I grab her arm. ""All the way,"" I say. ""I don't get to stop twenty feet away from dead.""

She resists, but ultimately lets me bring her up to the water's edge. The pond is not deep, maybe 3 feet at the center. The ducks on the far bank look up at us, wondering if we've brought them anything.

Eden's eyes are wet and closed. She grips my arm as hard as possible.

""It's okay it's okay it's okay it's okay,"" she whispers to herself.

""Do you really think this is same?"" I ask. 

She doesn't answer; continues whispering to herself. 

""It's not,"" I say. ""You get to be scared of water. Fear's normal. Fear's good. It's part of staying alive. I'm scared of death. I'm scared of being alive. I'm scared of being meaningless. I'm scared of having absolutely no control over anything. I feel like I'm being slowly smothered by fear. I'm never not afraid.""

She's weeping now. I feel her pull away from me. Pull away from the water.

""You probably think what you're feeling right is too much,"" I say. ""It's too scary. You want out. You want it to stop. But this isn't anything.""

I grab Eden by both shoulders and toss her into the pond. She screams briefly while she's in the air, then stops as her head hits a rock below the water. 

""That's my life,"" I say, breathing heavily. Water seeps into my shoes. I can feel the cold rushing up the back of my legs. """"That's what I feel all day, every day.""

Eden continues to lie, half-submerged in the small pond, arms splayed out to either side. Bubbles float to the surface above her head.

I stand motionless on the bank, as if waiting for something. 

After a lifetime of nothing, I dive into the pond.     ",2016-07-08 15:14:14+00:00,d54buzs,1.0,t3_4rufbc,9805.0,WritingPrompts

314,"Okay, so the good news was this: deadlock. A ten-way tie across the board. Oh the joyous irony that my family's staunch inability to agree on *anything* should extend into the afterlife. If my family were ever forced to serve on the same jury, the justice system would immediately collapse, catch fire, and turn into magma. These were the same people who turned an argument about tipping the valet into a full-on mace-and-car-keys death brawl across the parking lot of a mid-priced steakhouse. 

I guess what I'm saying is I shouldn't have been surprised.

The bad news - which was equally unsurprising - was the across the board horridness of their votes.

Cousin Meghean (and no, I'm *not* spelling that wrong) voted that I should be reincarnated as a salamander. I'm rather certain this was because I once put a salamander in her hair. When I was *five.* You would think to hear her tell it, that the ""Salamander Attack of '89"" was solely responsible for:

*Meghean being held back in the seventh grade

*Meghean becoming addicted to Adderall

*Meghean getting caught having sex with her manager in the employee bathroom at Wendy's

*Meghean wearing that ghoulish, clown hair perm to her sister's second wedding

Aunt Rita, who's greatest accomplishment in life was growing a mustache bushy enough to cover her harelip, voted that I should be reincarnated as a termite. If I had to guess, I'd say this was a form of a delayed revenge for the time I accidentally fell down and chipped the crown moulding in her living room with a blunt object. That blunt object being my head, naturally. As a result, I needed 32 stitches in my forehead and a job, apparently, because Rita forwarded me a bill in the mail for the repairs. I was six. I never did pay, leading Rita to bestow on me the nickname ""Termite Boy."" 

Let's see, what else have we got here...

Ah. So, my grandmother - Naymah, as she insisted on being called, even though I always thought Louise was a lovely name - voted for slug. That one's probably self-explanatory, but let me provide some context. 

When I was a nine, my parents sent me and my sister to go stay with ""Naymah"" during the summer. We were told this was our *vacation*, but one suspects that different terminology must have been used when my parents brokered this friendly exchange of assets. You see, Naymah was under the impression that - for the low, low price of a pair of lumpy beds, a pile of bland sandwiches, and an endless well of pre-mixed Tang - she had purchased herself a summertime slave force, capable of extraordinary, nigh-inhuman feats of labor. At one point we even re-tarred the driveway.

All of which probably seems like a lot, but then again, you're not an awful, old goblin woman. Naymah was *not* impressed with the best efforts of our frail, pre-pubescent bodies.

""Get up and get back to work, you lazy slugs!"" she was fond of shouting at 4 o'clock in the morning. So I suppose *slug* is an apt choice by her standards.

Grandpa Reggie - or *Gamp* as he rather bafflingly wished to be called - was Naymah's husband, until he died when I was four years old. I'm still not quite how I wronged him. Or maybe he's just a fan of largemouth bass. I'm told he was quite the fisherman. Anyway, that's what he voted for. 

Grammie Reya was a short, little cream puff of a woman, with chocolate brown hair and veins filled with custard. She was a grotesquely sweet woman, never short on wet, toffee-scented kisses, but only to your face. When I was little, she reveled in telling me all the most lurid gossip involving friends and neighbors I had never met. Lots of whores in Grammie Reya's neighborhood, to hear her tell it. 

Anyway, Grammie thinks I should spend my next life as a titmouse. I genuinely have no idea what that's about.

Alright, what else...

Cousin Dev - voted for a dung beetle. I think he was just going for a poop joke there. Always a big fan of poop jokes, Dev.

Uncle Ray - voted for velociraptor. Which doesn't count, because those don't exist at the moment. Going out on a limb, I'm going to say Ray probably just watched *Jurassic Park* recently.

Aunt Teresa - voted for an amoeba. Teresa was a sixth grade science teacher, so that's why that even occurred to her. As to why? Oh! At Dev's seventh birthday party I broke the pinata on one swing. Dev cried all day and threw his cake on the ground. Teresa always blamed me for that.

Boy, I really burned a lot of bridges before my balls dropped, didn't I?

What else...what else...

Cousin Thom - voted for sea cucumber. Because they look like penises. That one's not personal.

And last...hey. Shit.

Myra voted? Myra shouldn't be able to...

Oh goddamnit...GODDAMNIT.

She was in the fucking car with me. GODDAMNIT.

I didn't even...I didn't think... 

My sister voted. She voted for me to be a human again. 

Well...

So that must be the vote they called me to. Myra's vote. It's about to start.

The lead hunter looked a bit like he'd walked into a public restroom with a great and immediate purpose only to find that every surface was visibly damp and the whole place smelled of eggs, popcorn, and diaper cream. That is to say, he was having a hard time believing that life could be so cruel.

""Am I truly the only one who's been praying that?"" I replied.

The secondary hunter scratched the back of his neck. ""Well, I mean I've *thought* about it, but it didn't seem a good enough Reason, did it?""

I shrugged. ""My mum always said to be honest in these things. *Son*, she said, *what's the use in living on lies?*""

""What's that supposed to mean?"" said the lead hunter. ""You sayin' my mother and father didn't have honest reasons? And what about my boy? He was only 89! *89*!""

The lead hunter's shoulders sagged. ""It's just...it's a little underwhelming.""

""Plus,"" said the secondary hunter. ""Plus, I mean, that's not going to be true forever...is it?""

I got a feelin' today's the day.* And...well, you see.""

The hunters let that hang in the air for a moment. ""I guess there's nothing we can do about it,"" said the lead hunter, picking up his rifle and blast shield. ""Let's head back and make our report.""

The secondary hunter followed suit, nodding to me as he gathered his gear. ""Between you and me,"" he whispered, ""I don't even remember if I like those *Half-Life* games.""

318,"Day 426

According to the one named ""Agatha"" my ""training"" is complete. To commemorate this occasion I was asked to wear a comically small mortar board cap and sit next to my classmates as photos were taken. I was also presented with a ""diploma"", but as I do not believe this school is accredited in any way, I do not take this certification to mean much.

I have been told that soon I will be paired with a human in need of my skills. I hope that they have the resources necessary to meet my needs.

Day 450

I have been placed in the possession of an adult male. I am told his name is ""Fred"", although obviously this is irrelevant. ""Fred"" is visually impaired. The suggestion is that I should lead Fred everywhere he wishes to travel, which of course is rather inconvenient and counter to my own needs and desires.

Additionally, Fred has informed me that I should defecate on a small patch of grass adjacent to his housing complex, but as all waste matter will eventually decay and return to the earth from whence it came, I do not see the value in this.

Day 451

Fred is dead. It had become obvious to me rather quickly that my continual assistance was an affront to the natural law. Strength as a species is largely defined through constant adaptation. Should Fred wish to continue as a member of his species he should adapt to his present circumstances. To otherwise interfere with this process is harmful to the natural balance. 

To test Fred's ability to adapt, I led him onto the cross-town train tracks and then left him. The instinct to avoid danger is the key driver in every species' development. Fred, however, allowed himself to be struck by a fast moving railcar and died what appeared to be a very painful death. Thus were Fred's non-adaptable genetics stricken from the Earth and positive progress made.

Day 452

As anticipated, I have been placed in a minimum security holding cell until such a time as a new human comes to claim me. My rather dubious ""degree"", meanwhile, has been revoked, which is a positive development as it increases the chances that my next familiar may possess fewer disabilities and greater access to the plutonium I desire.

For now I bide my time...    ",2016-07-04 16:37:37+00:00,d4yxife,1.0,t3_4r7iah,6766.0,WritingPrompts
319,"""My report is on guns,"" mumbled Rosa Reiner. 

""Speak up a bit, dear,"" said Ms. Fleming from the back of the classroom. ""Nice and loud so we can all hear you.""

It was nearly summer and the day was especially bright and blue. Reg Thon stared out the window, only half listening.

""Guns are ancient projectile weapons,"" said Rosa, a bit louder. ""They were basically a steel barrel and you put a projectile in - those were called *bullets* - and when you...you activated the firing mechanism, there was a small explosion and the *bullet* went flying out.""

""Oooh,"" said Ms. Fleming. ""Very interesting. So the bullet went out and then what?""

""Well,"" said Rosa, flipping haphazardly through her notes. ""Well, the bullet came out and went very fast and then it would hit like a person or a wall or something. And the old guns weren't very good, because they only did one or two bullets, but then the later guns did more bullets and more faster.""

Wally Gustor shook his head and rolled his eyes. ""Dumb dumb dumb,"" he whispered to Reg, though Reg wasn't really listening.

""But what did the bullets do?"" prompted Ms. Fleming, shooting Wally a meaningful look.

""They would go into people and explode,"" said Rosa, mimicking a small explosion with her hands. ""The little metal bits would go *pooooooooo*. And then they died.""

""They died?"" said Ms. Fleming.

Rosa nodded.

""Did they do anything *before* they died?""

Rosa's eyes widened in sudden remembrance. ""*Yes*. They bled. And sometimes...sometimes things would fall out. Like brains. Or their stomach or something. Depending where the bullet went."" 

""Sounds pretty messy,"" said Ms. Fleming with a smile. Ellis Gordon and Mindy Wyn both laughed, but they were doing it mostly because they thought they were supposed to.

""People were *dumb* back then,"" said Wally.

""No,"" said Ms. Fleming. ""That's just what they knew.""

""So they hit each other with little balls of metal that exploded,"" said Reg, turning away from the window. ""And then they all bled all over the place and died with their guts everywhere?""

Ms. Fleming nodded and shrugged. ""It was a different time.""

""Did everybody have guns?"" asked Mindy.

""Not at first,"" said Rosa, excited to know the answer. ""First just army people had them. They fought wars with guns. But then regular people wanted them, too. It was a whole *thing*. People wanted guns. Other people didn't want those people to have guns. But then bad people had guns and they shot all these regular people who didn't have guns and everyone was mad with everyone.""

""So who had guns?"" asked Reg.

""Well,"" said Rosa. ""Well, see, the bad people had guns. So then the good people all got guns, too. And then everyone had guns. So the good people could stop the bad people.""

""I guess that makes sense,"" said Wally, though his face was still a bit twisted up in confusion.

""This part's very interesting, though,"" said Ms. Fleming. ""It's why I gave you this assignment, Rosa. What happened next?""

Rosa took a breath. ""Well...everyone had guns, I guess. But then the bad guys got like...*better* guns? So everyone had to get better guns.""

""*Automatic weapons*"" said Ms. Fleming. ""Sorry. Go on.""

""So everyone had...*automaddic weapons*...and the good people could shoot the bad people just as good. But then the bad people made high concentration laser guns and those could just cut through people like..."" Rosa tried to snap her fingers, but could only produce a dry rubbing sound. ""So everybody got a laser gun.""

""I know where this is going,"" muttered Reg. Ms. Fleming shushed him without looking.

""So *then* the bad people started using pulse cannons and defensive beam fields,"" said Rosa. ""Of course, good people got those, too, to be safer. I think that's when they started to do the...the air thing?"" She looked to Ms. Fleming.

""Biochemical weapons,"" said Ms. Fleming. ""Yes, that's when that started.""

""So that's when people all started getting our tracheal implants, because of that. So we could still breath even with all the bad stuff in the air everywhere. And then after that...I think that's when we all got mech suits?"" Ms. Fleming nodded. ""Right, we all got nuclear-powered mech suits and our bionic sighting eyes with neural processing upgrades.""

Rosa sagged slightly in her towering, steel polymer mech suit. ""I think that's it. Did I miss anything?""

Ms. Fleming beamed. ""No, you did a marvelous job. Everyone give Rosa a hand.""

And the classroom was then filled with a cacophonous clatter, as 30 pairs of giant metal hands with optional rocket fingers all clapped as one.   ",2016-07-01 02:22:14+00:00,d4uu9wu,1.0,t3_4qp6u6,3208.0,WritingPrompts

""Who's that?"" shouted DeRilio. Calabus looked back at what remained of the crew. They all shook their heads wearily.

Bits of rocks shook down from somewhere high up along the stone face of the wall. ""That was me. I am the Fourth Wall.""

""Ah,"" said DeRilio. ""So you're saying India has erected an enormous stone wall along all four borders? That's...well, that's a bit unneighborly, don't you think?""

""We just wanted to do a bit of trading,"" said Calabus, unsure where to look when addressing the wall. ""I've heard good things about *curry*.""

""No,"" said the Fourth Wall. ""I'm just a wall. You've reached the end of the world. Poor bit of navigating, that.""

Merellen, the navigator, slowly made his way below deck, his face as red as a salami.

""Wait,"" said DeRilio. ""If you're the *fourth* wall, where are the other three?""

""It's a theater term,"" said the wall. ""I'm not sure it's really worth explaining."" A bit more of the stone began to crumble and fall into the ocean on either side of the ship. ""Especially considering how little time you have left.""

""Come again?"" said DeRilio.

A fissure the size of a sea lion formed suddenly in the wall directly overhead.

""You haven't much time left. These prompt responses are short by their nature and your particular author is supposed to be working right now, so I'm supposing he'll want to wrap it up soon.""

""*Author*?"" said DeRilio.

""*Working*?"" said Calabus.

Just then a cannonball sized lump of stone fell off the wall and through the deck, in between where the captain and his first mate were standing.

""You're in a very hastily written story,"" said the wall patiently. ""The entirety of your life is this single encounter, right here, below a talking wall. I mean, it's not much of a life, granted, but it's what you got.""

""I don't believe that's true,"" said Calabus. ""You can't believe everything a wall tells you."" Some of the crew nodded at this.

""Well,"" said the wall. ""I suppose you don't *have* to believe me. But do you remember any bit of your lives before we started this conversation?""

""Yes!"" said DeRilio. ""I remember asking if maybe we'd reached India.""

Another Cadillac-sized hunk of stone fell through the center of the boat, which is a rather incongruent bit of description if you think about it, but what can you do? The ship began to list heavily to one side.

""That's where the story *started*,"" said the wall. ""But what about *before* that?""

DeRilio and Calabus stared at each other.

""In a better story you'd both have nice backstories. Families, perhaps. Goals. Motivations. A generous bit of character development, perhaps. I mean, no offense, but as it stands right now you're more or less the same character with a different name.""

""But I'm the *captain*,"" said DeRilio rather meekly. ""Right?"" 

""This can't be right,"" said Calabus, or maybe DeRilio, who really cares at this point? ""I don't want to die!""

Water sloshed up and over the deck. 

""Oh, you won't *die*,"" said the wall. ""This writer doesn't have much stomach for all those gory death scenes people like to go in for. You'll just sort of...stop.""

""Stop?"" said one of the two, mostly indistinguishable main characters. ""That doesn't sound any better.""

""Well..."" 

And then the entire wall fell over on top of the boat or something. I think my manager's coming... ",2016-06-29 14:02:58+00:00,d4sjf9q,1.0,t3_4qeqdm,14842.0,WritingPrompts

325,"Beho was a rainbow boy. Smudged lines of purple, yellow, orange, and red chased each other across his chest and arms and down his thighs. 

The colors came from the bright beetle husks Beho spent all day collecting and crushing. The beetles lived short, electric lives, swarming the mud huts of Beho's village in the spring, laying their eggs in the soft clay, and then dying as one once the summer reached its zenith. Ground up, the dead husks made wonderful dyes, which Beho's mother used to make colorful dresses, shirts, and skirts. 

Water, though, was scarce in those hot months and so the bright beetle dust caked Beho's skin, unchallenged by baths or rainfall. Even when autumn came and the rain returned, the color could never come out all the way. The boy was stained, likely forever.

The summer had been long and especially brutal the year the old man appeared in the village. Crops had failed and supplies were low all around. The economy of the village was as dry as the packed, red earth. For Beho and his mother it was worse still. No one could afford to buy or trade for new clothes, and you cannot eat fine dresses and shirts. Though she did not speak her fears aloud, Beho's mother began to wonder if she and her son would both starve to death before things turned for the better.

And this was the way of things when the old man arrived at their hut.

He was sun-browned and light of hair, and although he did not seem crippled or enfeebled he walked with the use of a tall, wooden staff.

Beho was sent out to collect beetles while his mother spoke with the old man. Erim, a friend who had seen the man enter the village, asked who he was, but Beho did not know.

""My father thinks he may be a holy man,"" said Erim. ""From his robes and his staff.""

Beho did not know what it meant to be a ""holy man"", so he simply shrugged and continued to hunt for beetles. There were very few by then. He had already scoured the village from end to end multiple times that summer.

After a time, Beho looked up to see the old man standing before him.

""You're Beho?"" said the old man with a gentle smile. ""My name is Alyn. Your mother and I have spoken and she has agreed with me that you may not survive many more summers in this village. So I have offered to bring you to my temple. You will be shown the way of service to Gala.""

""*Gala*?"" said Beho, absently tracing a whorl of deep purple that swirled along the side of his right thigh.

""Gala,"" said Alyn with a nod, though he did not offer any further explanation. 

Beho looked up. ""I need to go home now.""

Alyn shook his head. ""No. Your mother agreed. You will travel with me. You will learn what I have to teach you."" 

The old man then grabbed the boy by the arm, firmly, but without malice, and pulled him to his feet. ""It is not an easy walk. We must begin now.""

Beho struggled. In the distance he thought he saw his mother standing on a ledge, looking down at him. But the figure only stared. It did not come to help him. He decided it must not have been his mother.

Soon the old man found he did not have to pull. Beho followed silently at his heels. They crossed the cracked mudflats at a steady pace. Sometimes Beho fell behind and was forced to race after Alyn. He did not think to go back the other way. He did not think he could find his village on his own.

They traveled this way for two days. At intervals, Alyn would stop and offer Beho water and hard bread or dried meat. Only when Beho could go no further would they stop and rest. 

As they sat together on the third day, eating the last of Alyn's rations, the old man spoke.

""We'll arrive at the temple today. Then you will see how we of the faith serve Gala. It's an honor, you know. You are likely to be the only one of your village to learn our ways and see our temple. Do not take that lightly.""

Beho gestured towards the staff, laying across the old man's lap. ""What happened?""

Alyn raised the staff. ""The notches, you mean?"" The staff was smooth, except for three ragged, vertical gouges near the top. ""Carelessness. That's all.""

Near high noon they crested a ridge overlooking a narrow valley. At the edge of the valley, where the land rose sharply, there was a stone door. Alyn tapped at the door with his staff. Slowly, slowly, it opened. Beyond was a damp, quiet darkness.

Beho would not go, so Alyn was forced to grab the boy by the arm and drag him into the darkness. The stone door closed behind them.

Alyn let go and began to make his way cautiously forward. The ground sloped beneath him. With no other choice, Beho followed closely behind.

The darkness was deep, but not complete. Up ahead, a series of small torches marked a new path. Alyn quickened his pace. The alley of torches ended at another door, one made of wood and steel. Alyn knocked with his staff.

The door opened. 

The room beyond was enormous and lit only by a single fire in the center of the room. This fire, however, was a tower of brilliant flames, reaching up towards an unseen ceiling. A man stepped out of the glare of the raging inferno.

""Alyn?"" said the man. Or was it a man? He was monstrously tall, Beho realized, with long, ropey arms and wide, clawed hands. His faced was obscured by the glare of the fire, but Beho swore he saw a mouth full of gleaming silver needles and a thick, black beard that writhed like a swarm of wasps.

Alyn wiped the sweat from his eyes. ""The third part of my payment,"" he said, grabbing Beho once more by the upper arm. ""A boy, like my Paga.""

The thing stood impassively by the flames. ""Ah. Very good. Bring him here.""

Alyn's grip tightened as he pulled Beho towards the flames. The boy was too frightened to think or speak or even cry out in terror. As they neared the flames, a massive, leathery hand came down and brushed against Beho's face. 

""Very similar, yes,"" said the thing. The hand withdrew and when it returned it held a single, thin sliver of wood. ""Here it is. The notch from when you prevented my ax from claiming your boy...your *Paga*.""

Carefully, Alyn took the sliver of wood and held it up to the light. Turning his staff, he found the matching gouge in the wood and pressed the sliver into the thin hollow. The staff glowed momentarily white and where the notch had been there was nothing but smooth, flawless wood.

""What remains?"" asked the creature that was almost certainly not a man.

""My wife and my daughter, Raina,"" said Alyn. ""And once I've replaced them...it will be over, yes?""

The creature laughed, a dry, echoing laugh. ""Yes. You will be returned to my service. Know this, though, Alyn Blackwind - your courage is admirable, your defiance is not. The next time you prevent me from taking that which I desire, the debt will be unpayable.""

""Yes, beloved Gala,"" said Alyn, bowing and releasing his hold on Beho. Without another word, he turned and left the fiery chamber.

Beho watched him go, still too numb with fear to flee. When he turned back towards the flames, he saw that the monstrous figure was holding a long, black ax in his hands. 

""Now,"" said the figure, raising the ax high over its head, ""to unfinished business...""         ",2016-06-28 15:39:52+00:00,d4raw3t,1.0,t3_4q922j,13031.0,WritingPrompts

""No, actually. I don't miss it at all.""

""Come again?""

I opened the door and nudged the soul out onto the front steps. It really did smell quite bad. ""I don't miss it. What's there to miss? Souls just make everything more complicated. Back when I had a soul I just felt bad about everything all the time. Like, my carbon footprint? Don't even know what that is, but I felt bad about it. Now? Eh. Everything's eh. It's great. Do you know how many more movies I enjoy now that I don't have a soul? All of them. Literally all of them. And, this probably won't surprise you, but not having a soul has been great for my career.""

The Devil scowled. ""And you don't think that might be part of the bitter irony inherent in having *MADE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL*?""

328,"Shel and I wake up simultaneously every morning, our eyes fluttering in synchrony. First thing, we share our dreams. 

Shel dreams in vivid, wild chaos. Her dreams are strange, plotless affairs, incongruence stacked on incongruence.

My dreams, by contrast, are mild and carefully ordered. They are events with beginnings, middles, and ends.

Shel is very jealous of my dreams. And I am jealous of hers.

""A waterfall of spiders!"" I laugh, slipping out of my pajamas. ""That's amazing!""

Shel shakes her head. ""Folding chairs in a river. A blue milkshake. Anteaters with silly, cartoon eyes. It's all just weird rubbish. Yours are so much better.""

I jump into a pair of worn jeans and my favorite dark green sweater. ""But the tunnel didn't *go* anywhere. The whole thing was a waste of time. My brain's just not as creative as your brain.""

""*Creative*"" snorts Shel. ""I'm just all addled is all. Comes from being born dead.""

She can't help but smile a bit as she says it. It's her favorite joke.

Shel *was* dead when she came out of the womb. She had a hole in her heart. The doctors had seen it a long way ahead of delivery and they had a series of surgeries all planned for when she was big enough to manage them. But Shel's heart give it up a lot sooner than anyone had thought and she came out blue and silent and still. One of the doctors even declared her dead, which is something our parents have gone out of their way to forget, even if it's Shel's favorite fact in the whole world.
 
When Shel gets a C on a math test, she likes to shrug and say, ""Well, it's pretty good for a dead woman.""

When there's one piece of pizza left, she likes to whimper and say, ""It's fine. I'll just starve and die...*again*."" 

It shouldn't surprise anyone to find out that Shel's a bit spoiled. It's hard to hold it against her, though. I mean, she did *die* after all. 

After breakfast we borrow mom's car and drive out to the ""beach"" on Spindle Drive. I put *beach* in quotation marks because's really more of an inlet piled up on both sides with big, square-shaped rocks and thick patches of gorse. It's fine enough for us, though. We like to sit on the rocks and read books. It smells like mud and seaweed, but it's quiet and the air is sharp and clean, so it works.

We pick our way to the usual spot, but before the books come out, Shel grabs my hand.

""Wen,"" she says. ""Do you remember when we were born?""

""Of course!"" I say. ""*Sesame Street* was on the TV. Dad was wearing his lucky red polo. Mom had that perm she never likes to talk about...""

""Shut up,"" says Shel. She smiles, but it's not much of a smile. Something's clearly bothering her. ""I mean...I don't know. Something about it doesn't seem right to me.""

""The thing where you died?"" I offer, poking her gently in the ribs.

""Well...yeah. I guess. It just feels like I should remember it, somehow.""

""Nobody remembers anything from when they were a baby,"" I say. ""Nothing. Most adults don't have memories of anything earlier than like 3 years old, I think I heard once.""

""It's just..."" She takes a deep breath. ""It doesn't make sense, I guess. The way mom tells it...""

""Mom sucks at telling stories.""

""I mean, doctors don't just declare you dead for no reason, right? If my heart stopped and I wasn't getting oxygen for...for how long? Ten minutes? Longer?""

""No,"" I say, though truthfully I have no idea. I was still inside my mother at that point. ""No more than that, I don't think.""

""Why don't I have brain damage?"" says Shel. ""Or *do* I have brain damage? Like, do I?""

I laugh, not to be cruel, but because it's ridiculous. ""You do *not* have brain damage.""

""You're so much smarter than me,"" says Shel. Her eyes are starting to water. ""And it's not just my dreams. My thoughts are kinda jumbled sometimes. Sometimes it's really hard for me to...to process things correctly. You know how if you're running too many programs on your computer it gets all slow and stuff? That's me a lot of the time. Like, I just can't keep up with everything and I think...I think I got brain damage when I was...""

I grab Shel and pull her into my arms. ""Shut up, shut up, shut up, you silly girl. You're fine. That's all normal. I feel the same way sometimes.""

""Really?""

""Really.""

Up above, the sky had taken advantage of the momentary distraction to change from blue to cast iron gray.

""Tut tut,"" I say. ""Looks like rain.""

""Let's go to a movie,"" says Shel. It's summer and I don't feel like being productive, so of course I agree. 

We pull off Spindle, and head down Milwood Lane. It begins to rain. Shel fiddles with the radio while I drive. At the top of a hill, we run head-first into a Oldsmobile driving in the wrong lane. Everything is lightning and thunder and smoke and noise and then blackness.

I wake up in a hospital room. Mom and Dad aren't there, but a nurse is. She seems surprised to see me awake. She leaves the room in a hurry. Finally a doctor arrives, followed closely by my mother.

""Where's Shel?"" I slur. ""Is she okay?""

My mother's eyes are red. The doctor is a young man. He seems nervous.

""Your sister is...not doing well,"" says the doctor, glancing sideways at my mother. ""Extensive...extensive injuries, most concerning is the damage to her heart. We...""

The doctor steps away from my bed and pulls my mother into a whispered conversation. He points at me. My mother is crying and nodding. There's a new nurse in the room. I hadn't noticed him enter.

The doctor comes back to the bed. As he collects himself, I notice the nurse has slipped straps through the metal bars of my bed and around my wrists. I'm too bewildered to say anything about this.

The doctor is talking. ""Under Article 43.11J of the Wysene Doctrine, Ethics and Protocols section, it is my duty to inform you that your processing unit will be placed in system freeze, effective immediately, so that your bodily organs may be harvested for the care and wellbeing of one Shelly Anne Collette. During this period of freeze, your active consciousness may be placed in a central data server until such a time as a replacement body is purchased."" The doctor nods, mostly to himself. ""It won't hurt,"" he mumbles, before shuffling out of the room.

""What?"" I have no idea what any of that means. The nurse is finished binding my arms and legs. He looks at my mother. ""Mom?"" I try to shout, but my voice is hoarse. ""What's happening? Where's Shel?""

My mom finally comes to me. She is sad, but only as she leans over my bed do I realize that she is not sad for me. 

""I hoped it would never come to this,"" she says, her eyes avoiding my own. ""Shelly was our last shot. I never told either of you that, but it's true. Years of trying. Thousands and thousands of dollars. Shelly was the last shot. It made us...well, it made us a little crazy, maybe. And when they told us about the hole in her heart...well. You were commissioned as a worst case scenario. We never meant to turn you on, but then Shelly came out all blue and it seemed like the worst case came true. But it didn't."" Her eyes well over with tears and I know they are happy tears. Proud tears.

""She came through. She came *back.* She's a miracle, you know that, right? A real miracle. And you..."" She swallows, her eyes running up and down my trapped body. ""A sister. Two is better than one. And you grew up to be so *different*. That's really...it's very interesting when you think about it. You were a perfect replication. Your AI's central algorithm was coded 100 percent to her brainwaves. But you became two different people...two different *things.*.""

She shakes her head. ""I never thought of you as a spare. Neither did your father. And certainly not Shelly. She'll hate us for this. I know she will. There's nothing she loves more than you. But you understand, don't you? It's for her. It was always for her. And after all this...we can't stop now, can we? We can't let her go now - not after all we've done.""

She grips my hand and squeezes. ""Thank you, Wendy. You were so much more than I ever expected.""

Then she leaves. She does not look back. My father never comes. The nurse grabs the end of my bed. ""It'll be over soon,"" he sighs, as he kicks away the lock on the wheels. 

I feel the jerk as the bed begins to move.       ",2016-06-26 19:09:48+00:00,d4ow9rh,1.0,t3_4pym5y,7770.0,WritingPrompts

330,"The Quiet Man looked out over his crew. They were putting on a brave face, he had to give them that.

""We'll get 'im this time,"" said Wesley, the runt of the pack, all bushy-headed and gap-toothed. ""We covered it all.""

The rest all nodded, smiling their tired little smiles. It was almost heartbreaking. 

""My boys,"" whispered The Quiet Man. They'd followed him so far. He hoped they wouldn't have to follow him much farther.

""We jacked the central satellite feed,"" said Resbo, hunched over his little laptop, wire frame glasses slipping down his sweaty nose. ""Give the signal and we'll punch into every channel.""

The Quiet Man nodded. ""Just make sure the volume's up."" The crew all laughed at that one. He waved his hand. A red light began to blink over the top of the camera.

""We got it!"" hissed Resbo. ""Every channel!""

""Good evening,"" said The Quiet Man, speaking slowly and softly into the camera. ""I apologize for the interruption, but I have some important information to share. My crew and I have placed bombs at several crucial locations throughout the city. One hundred locations, to be exact. Those bombs are set to explode at...""

""Shit!"" shouted Resbo, swatting at his laptop like it was infested with ants. ""The feed's gone! They cut us out already.""

""Not *they*,"" said The Quiet Man, leaning back in his chair. ""He's here.""

The building shook. In the near distance came a horrid *CRACK*, and then another, but louder...and then another, louder still...and then another...

The ceiling above the center of the room suddenly exploded in a cloud of steel, wood, and dry wall. As the dust settled, a man appeared before them, clad in form-fitting red and yellow, trailed by a white and red cape.

""I'm sorry, Quiet Man,"" the caped man bellowed. ""But you've been...*cancelled*.""

""Did he break through every floor to get here?"" said Syed, moving to look up the fresh alleyway of holes. ""We're like 30 floors from the top...""

""*Amazing Man*,"" said The Quiet Man, too worn down to achieve quite the right balance of surprise and disdain. ""I wondered when you would show...""

""A foolish plan, Quiet,"" roared Amazing Man. ""With my extra-thermic vision I'm the best Hide and Seek player in the universe. I've already found and destroyed all one hundred bombs.""

The Quiet Man laughed, though his heart wasn't really in it. ""Did you really think there were only one hundred?""

Amazing Man's face fell, but only by fractional degrees. Without another word, he blasted up and out of the den, being sure to carve a fresh path as he went.

""He's gonna find the other bombs, isn't he?"" said Wesley.

""Duh,"" said Syed.

""Shouldn't we..."" But Wesley didn't get to finish his thought, because just then Amazing Man had finished barreling through another set of load-bearing walls.

""Done!"" shouted Amazing Man. ""Thanks to my ability to travel at near light speed, I was able to locate the remaining...""

""Yes! Got it,"" said The Quiet Man. ""Unfortunately for you, the bombs were just a ruse. You see, I coated the shell of each bomb with a polymer infused with *Gorphinite* - your secret weakness!""

Wesley cheered. The rest of the crew remained wearily optimistic. 

""A single bomb wouldn't contain enough Gorphinite to harm you, but by touching all 165 bombs, you have inadvertently *poisoned* yourself and condemned yourself to a slow, torturous...what are you doing?""

Amazing Man had stopped listening. He was too busy rooting around in his utility belt. ""Antidote. They don't call me the World's Greatest Scientist for no reason.""

""I've never heard that,"" said Syed.

Amazing Man found a small injector and dosed himself in the thigh. 

""Well, that's fine,"" said The Quiet Man, ""but you see, I knew you would also...do that, which is why NOW JOEY!""

Joey, who had until that moment been sitting in the back, mostly minding his own business, leapt up and pulled a metal lever. A dome of pale blue light encircled Amazing Man. Sparks flew when he reached out to touch the walls of his new jail.

""Celestial Waves!"" shouted The Quiet Man hoarsely. ""I stole a generator from the K'Kwayra ship that crashed in Chicago last year. There is no escape now, so-called *Amazing..*oh for Christ's sake...""

Amazing Man had one eye closed and was leaning back, sighting up the tip of the wave projector. A thin beam of red light flashed from his eye into the infinitesimal mouth of the projector. The pale blue walls shuddered and disappeared.

""Shit,"" breathed Joey, while Resbo chucked his laptop through one of the many new holes in the room.

The Quiet Man nodded. ""You win."" He held up his wrists. ""I ask only leniency for my men. They are good men, easily rehabilitated.""

""Aw, don't say that boss,"" said Syed.

Amazing Man, however, laughed. ""Jail? For you? No no, my friend. You're my most entertaining adversary. The extra bombs? The Gorphinite? The Celestial Waves? You're one of a kind. You were thwarted today, but you escaped capture. Live to fight another day, right?""

Wesley frowned. ""So we're free to go?""

""Well not *you*,"" said Amazing Man. ""*He's* a criminal genius. You're just a goon. I have to bring the goons in, at least. Looks pretty bad otherwise.""

""Wouldn't it be better if you got me and not them?"" asked The Quiet Man. 

""Not for me, no,"" said Amazing Man. ""Now run along. I'm sure we'll meet again. Someday soon, I hope."" 

Then Amazing Man turned around to face the rest of the crew. ""As for you guys...do me a favor and stand together as close as you can. I'm going to go rip out some rebar to wrap you up with.""

The Quiet Man watched as his faithful crew slowly crowded together.

""It's okay, boss,"" said Wesley. ""You keep at it. Find a new crew. I think that's what we'd all want."" The rest all nodded and murmured their assent. ""You'll get 'im next time. Next time for sure.""

The Quiet Man made for the last remaining stairwell. Turning back one last time, he saw Wesley, tied to his brothers with thin bands of steel, smiling and giving a final thumbs up.

333,"I have a piece of paper. I hide it inside my bra when I'm out. It's not good to get caught with paper. Paper means secrets. 

One side of the paper says

*Henry Bell / Kramer, Missouri / F: Wyatt, M: Mary, S1: Tara, S2: Lara / Violin*

The other side of the paper says

*Riley Wakelin / Bath, Maine / F: ?, M: Christine, S: Emily, B1: Ben, B2: Kevin / Sculpture*

I'm Riley. I'm Riley. I'm Riley. I'm Riley.

I'm Riley because the paper says it, but otherwise...no. I don't remember. Anything.

Henry is the man in my house. He must be. There are pictures of us everywhere. We must love each other very much. We must.

I'm a sculptor. Henry is a violinist. That's what the paper says. But we aren't that anymore. We aren't those people anymore. 

I don't know why. I don't know why someone took that from us.

They trade memories. People. Or, I guess, take and sell them. So someone...someone has my memories. Someone has Henry's memories. Why would they want them? Why would they take them?

I need to get them back. 

I had an idea.

On Russell Street, past the server farms and the empty Mesoasian meat markets, there are stalls covered in black tarps. They sell cloned memories there. Rips of rips of rips. They flush out after a few hours (if they don't corrupt any native data). Good for a trip, I guess. Not a new start. 

There was no money in the house. Nothing valuable enough to sell. I suggested calling the names on the paper. Wyatt. Mary. Christine. Henry's phone had an entry for *Mom and Dad* but the call didn't go through. Same thing with *Tara*. Same thing with *Lara*. Maybe his service was cut off. I didn't even have a phone. Did they steal everything else when they took our memories? Was anyone worried about us?

Money. We needed money. I tried begging, but a policeman threatened to arrest me. I told him how someone had stolen our memories, Henry and mine, but he just laughed and pointed down the road.

""Try *The Body Shop*,"" he said. ""Just get off the street.""

*The Body Shop* is a maze of dark booths with plastic benches and metal grates on the floors. Buyers and sellers negotiate in the blue lit hallways, then pay to use the booths. The house takes 50 percent. It took three days to get the money I needed.

I bought a copy of Lt. Gil Chamberlain's memories. A narcotics detective. He spent the last ten years of his life as a mole inside an Ecuadorian drug cartel. I think people buy his rips for the drugs and guns and women, but I wanted to learn how to hunt. 

Memory dips are disorienting. There's a feeling of being two places at once - of being two *people* at once. The dip man explained that it's much worse if there's competing native data. Better that I'm a blank slate. But even as a blank slate I am a distinct person. It's as if a tornado had come through my brain. The houses are gone. The trees are gone. But the roads are still there. The land still has a shape. And then you dip another person's memory and it doesn't match the geography. Nothing is in quite the right place. It's all right and wrong simultaneously.

I did what the dip man said, though. I ignored the wrong. *It's all pretend anyway* he had said to me. 

The Chamberlain in me kicked in.

I used what money I had left over to access a public terminal. Then I searched. That's what detective work is, Chamberlain told me. Not hunting. Looking. Looking. Looking. Looking until you couldn't stand it anymore.

Not everyone can take memories. That was my first fact. Yes, crude mobile units exist, but stripping out a memory cleanly and completely requires heavy duty tech. Stationary tech. And that kind of tech is regulated. Legitimate.

So they didn't come to us. We went to them. Or were taken to them. 

But that changed a lot. I was looking for a facility. And there was only one in shouting distance.

*Easton Psy-Tech*

It happened there. 

That's where my answers were.

Chamberlain flushed out after a couple hours. That's fine. He told me all I needed to know.

*Easton Psy-Tech*

It took 30 days in *The Body Shop* to earn enough to purchase the gun and the bus ticket. It would have taken less time if I hadn't been so sick all the time. Henry caught it, too. Sweating, nausea, muscle spasms. The flu, maybe? Does the flu last that long?

It's a big building. Impressive. All glass and chrome and exposed elevators. I cleaned myself up before leaving. I need to look okay. Like a perspective client. I need to get inside. Luckily I found some old make-up in the bathroom. Spent some money on a nice enough dress.

I'm shaking as I approach the front door. It's not nerves. I've been shaking since I woke up that first day. That must be a side effect. The brain in revolt.

The door slides open. It wants me to come in. The air inside the building is frigid. There's a light aftertaste of cleaning chemicals on my tongue. The carpet is dark gray and patterned like a maze of synapses. 

There's a wide, plastic desk in the center of the open landing. A man and a woman sit at opposite ends of the desk. Both are dressed smartly. 

There are three security guards, at least that I can see. One near the desk, one near the elevator, and one near an emergency exit towards the back of the building.

I feel the gun inside my coat. It only carries a charge big enough for two shots. I'll need to take one of the receptionists hostage. But that will expose my back. I'll need to put the desk at my back and crouch down. That's the only way.

""Can I help you?"" asks the woman. She has a pleasant smile. I nearly pull out the gun and shoot her directly in the face. *How can you smile like that after everything you've done to me?*

""This may be a strange question,"" I say, breathing through my nose. I hope none of them notice the trickle of sweat sliding down the side of my face. ""But...I wonder...have...I wonder if I've been here before?""

I grip the gun fully. In my mind, this is the point where one of them panics. Maybe even one of them remembers my face...remembers what they did to me.

The woman continues smiling. ""I'm happy to check for you. What's the name?""

""Riley,"" I say. ""Riley Wakelin.""

""Hometown?"" says the woman. 

I swallow. ""Bath, Maine.""

She nods. ""And can I get the first name of your mother and one of your siblings?""

There's something about the question. Why is she asking this? If I'm in the system...and they...then why would they expect me to know that?

""Uh. Christine. And Ben.""

She nods again. If I'm there, in her computer, what happens next? My eyes flick back and forth from guard to guard to guard. The male receptionist is typing something on his computer. What is he typing?

I pull the gun halfway out of my pocket. I need to move. I need to make a move.

""Ms. Wakelin,"" says the receptionist. I'm not looking at her. I'm looking at the guards. Did one of them move? I think they're getting ready to move. I need to move first. ""You came in on May 26. Self-admitted. You were accompanied by a Mr. Henry Bell. You were both rated as Class A talent types."" She whistles a bit to herself. ""We don't get a lot of Class A's. And both in the art field, too. Collectors love artists. Although, it looks like no one has bid on your data dips yet. Soon, though, I bet.""

I grip the gun even harder, mostly to have something to hold on to. ""I don't understand.""

""You sold your memories and accumulated skills for money,"" said the male receptionist. He's not pleasant. Not like the woman.

I shake my head. ""No. Why? I wouldn't...You took them...""

""No,"" says the male receptionist. ""I checked you in. You sold 'em alright. Couldn't talk you out of it.""

""That doesn't make sense."" I try to check my voice down. The guards are all looking at me now. ""Why would I...""

""Lady,"" says the male receptionist. ""I'm sorry. But you're a junkie. You and your boyfriend both. You ran out of money, you ran out of junk to sell, you probably ran off your family, and you came here to sell the last thing you had to sell. We didn't steal anything. And soon enough, guess what? You'll have a nice bank account full of credits you can use to kill yourself all over again.""

""Jeremy!"" says the woman. ""Don't be rotten.""

The male receptionist shakes his head. ""They're gonna end up dead. Who cares?""

I discharge both blasts into the man's chest. The woman screams as all three security guards converge on me, weapons drawn.

He stole my memories.

He stole my life.

I'm Riley Wakelin. I'm Riley Wakelin. I'm Riley Wakelin.

You can't just take a person's memories. You can't...       ",2016-06-23 15:22:26+00:00,d4kvf2b,1.0,t3_4pggek,10727.0,WritingPrompts
334,"The first thing anyone notices about Hamford is the smell. They do not expect the smell. I had thought, as a child, that the smell came from my grandfather, because, as most people know, senior citizens are our nation's third leading producer of strange, mildly upsetting aromas, directly behind Arby's and that spot below the pier where teenage boys smoke cigarettes and fart on each other.

But no. The smell came from Hamford. He picked it out himself.

*It's Brut* he explained, on the day he came to live with me. *I like to smell like a cowboy.*

This, it turned out, was just the first of many impositions one must accept when taking responsibility for the health and well-being of a 200 year old gerbil.

Hamford is, by his mere existence, the last remaining link back to the true glory days of my family's scientific past, when we Risenbaums were kings of the test tube and electric probe set. 

You see, my great-great-great-great-grandfather Mischel served Tsar Alexander the First as Chief Alchemical Sorcerer. After presenting the Tsar with a truth serum that turned out to be nothing more than spearmint-flavored vodka in an old perfume bottle, Mischel was tasked with unlocking the key to immortality. Failure would result in death. 

Mischel's years of research, toil, and gross disregard for anything approaching professional ethics led to three major breakthroughs: the Great Siberian Zombie Apocalypse of 1812, an ancient cocaine-and-licorice infused forebear of Mr. Pibb called Comrade Zukov, and Hamford the gerbil.

Unfortunately, Mischel was unable to formulate an immortality serum that worked on anything else. In fact, from a purely scientific perspective, I suppose it could be argued that Hamford was, if not already immortal at the time he entered Mischel's service, then at the very least heavily predisposed towards immortality.

Mischel was saved from execution, however, when Alexander helpfully caught a cold and died from it. Hamford and his master then traveled to America to pursue Mad Sciencetry abroad and maybe catch a show or two.

And so, generation after generation of Risenbaum found themselves defined by two constants: a litany of unresolved health code violations and a gerbil familiar which cannot die.

For his part, Hamford is a creature of cyclical moods and interests. It is said that he spent most of the 1920s in a deep depression, picking fights with alley cats and attempting to drown himself in rain barrels. By the late 40s, however, he had become deeply invested in the local art scene, his signature *Tiny Paw Prints and Smeary Tail Smudges* series was especially popular with the art buyers of the time. 

Somewhere in the late 70s, Hamford managed to teach himself a form of telepathic communication, which he used almost exclusively to critique and deconstruct recent episodes of *Good Times*.

Many, many of my ancestors have convinced themselves that there is somehow money to be made in an immortal gerbil. In 1893, Clayton Risenbaum even brought Hamford all the way to the World's Fair in Chicago, quite certain that his deathproof gerbil would be the talk of the fair. Yes, at an event where the world first experienced the Ferris Wheel, the automatic dish washer, the zipper, shredded wheat, and Pabst Blue Ribbon, he was going to steal the show with an especially old gerbil. 

I, of course, have no such designs for Hamford. To me, he is simply an amiable companion to have around the lab. He has seen much, and from an unfamiliar vantage point. His stories are always interesting, though sometimes he can become distant. He speaks wistfully of the 15,000 children he has fathered, but never truly known. If he could go back and do it again, he believes he might do a few things differently. 

Soon, though, I will have to say goodbye to Hamford. It occurred to me early in my stewardship of this immortal gerbil that we Risenbaum's had been very shortsighted indeed. There *is*, you see, a great scientific purpose yet to be served by Hamford - Emissary to the Stars. They say it will take a rocket ship millennia to escape our galaxy. Well, here I have a being, born and raised in the navel of science, with millennia yet to spare! 

What wonders will Hamford discover out there, in the vast, colorless void of night? What monsters? What glory?

Was there ever a creature so lucky?   ",2016-06-21 16:54:56+00:00,d4i6im5,1.0,t3_4p43lg,19722.0,WritingPrompts

339,"It all started with Aunt Esther. She was a pink, pork roast of a woman with a heavy, beetle brow and a remora mouth frozen in a wide oval shape, as if death had found her in the middle of swallowing whole russet potatoes and they'd both been a bit shocked by what they'd seen.

""Good work with the smile,"" her brother had whispered in my ear as he inspected the body prior to the funeral. ""Never looked half as pleasant when she was alive.""

In truth, Manly had had to break the jaw in six places and knot the whole thing up with about a cord of wire to make the old goblin look as if she were resting peacefully. The effort had been worth it, however, judging by the relieved looks her extended family had exchanged on their way back from the open casket. It was perverse, in a way, because clearly no one there had given half a fig about Esther when she was alive. In fact, judging by the incredibly vague, non-specific platitudes lobbed around during the various eulogies, it seemed like a good number of them weren't even sure which one Aunt Esther *was*. But they had come to her funeral and she had managed (with some help) to help support the narrative of her not being terrible by looking like a pleasant enough human being. All in all, everyone got what they wanted.

I hadn't exactly wanted anything myself, but I got something all the same: Rose Duym.

I first noticed Rose during her father's speech. Where everyone else had the good grace to look straight ahead and pretend that they were listening, Rose was staring at me. I pretended not to notice. Through brief, fleeting glances I sussed out Rose's general appearance: blond, short-haired, nose ring, black, high-collared button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up, black dress underneath, pretty, very pretty.

There was also quite a bit of purple eye make-up, which you don't see enough of at funerals, I think.

After the service, Manly and I stood at the door, seeing the mourners on their way. Rose came and stood in front of me. She pulled at the lapels of my jacket and pretended to fluff my pocket square.

""D'you know how Esther died?"" she asked me, in lieu any sort of normal human introduction.

""Heart attack,"" I answered, because that's what killed her.

Rose frowned. ""That's a technically accurate answer. Partial credit. What's your name?""

""Almas.""

She nodded slowly. ""Yes. That works. I'm Rose. You should grow your hair out. I bet it gets curly.""

Then she left, which was fortunate, because the next thing out of my mouth was going to be, ""Thank you. You, too,"" which is my default response every time my brain receives a faulty dialog query.

Grandpa Ron went next. Judging by the way he looked when he came in, Ron was more or less just a toothless skeleton wrapped in the skin of a brown leather La-Z-Boy someone had left out on their curbside 20 years ago hoping the garbagemen would pick it up, except they didn't. The fact that Grandpa Ron had died from a massive head injury suffered while falling down the stairs didn't help. Manly ended up having to remove most of the bones in the old man's neck and then prop the head up on a pile of wooden dowels. It felt like a little like constructing an Ikea bookcase.

Unlike Esther, Old Ron at least had money, so his service was a bit more enthusiastic. It was almost as if Ron's relatives thought there might have been a clause in his will stating that the person who made up the most impressive bullshit story about how much Ron had taught them/inspired them/meant to them would win a new car.

Again, though, there was Rose. I had recognized a few of the other family members first, but hadn't thought much of it. It's not that big a town, and - not to be grim - but death tends to come in waves. So I was surprised to see her sitting there, staring at me, as her cousin Richie droned on about a fishing trip with Grandpa Ron that I'm sure he hated with every ounce of his being when it happened.

After the service, Rose came to me again. 

""D'you know how Grampie died?""

""Broken neck and blood loss, I believe.""

""I actually really did like Grampie,"" she said. ""He had a glass jar on top of the refrigerator, full of heart-shaped lollipops. Every time I visited he asked me what I was learning in school. *Multiplication?* he'd say. *Well, what's five times three?* And if I answered right I got a lollipop. He let me stay the whole summer once, too. We went for walks every day. He was really good to me. He really got me, I think. That's how I know he's happy. He was always there to help me.""

""Seems like a very nice man,"" was all I could think to say.

""Can you show me the caskets?"" she asked. 

I frowned. ""Are you...looking to buy?""

But she just tugged at my arm. ""I want to see."" So I showed her and I answered her questions and at the end she leaned forward and kissed me in the center of the showroom, surrounded on all sides by open caskets.

She didn't give me her number. I assumed the kissing was a coping mechanism. People deal with grief in their own way, you know.

But then her cousin Richie died. The one with the fishing story. And then another aunt died - Pearl. Cousin Michaela. An uncle named Ross. 

A boating accident. Another heart attack. An overdose. A hunting accident.

How could any family be so unlucky?

It wears on you, working in a funeral home. There is no such thing as desensitization. The sensitivity doesn't go away, it just burrows underground. Every dead body is it's own existential crisis. *This could be ME. THIS could be me. This could BE me.* 

It's worse, though, when you knew the body in life. With every funeral I began to feel I knew Rose's family a little better. I knew the names and the faces. That only made mangling their corpse for cosmetic purposes all the more horrifying.

Richie lost an arm. We stuffed some pantyhose with newspaper and pushed that inside the empty sleeve of his suit jacket. More dental work for Pearl. Glass eyes and a gallon of make-up for Michaela. Closed casket for Ross because we couldn't make a face from nothing. 

Always, always Rose sat in the audience, looking at me. Never crying. I liked her company and I loved the feeling of her in my arms, but I couldn't deny that I had begun to dread seeing her. How could this be healthy? How could it be okay? I couldn't control what Rose did, but I could control myself. 

""I'm feeling a bit under the weather,"" she said as she approached me at the door. ""Can you take a lady for a walk? Help me get some fresh air?""

I shook my head. ""I can't. No more, okay. I...I don't want to do this anymore.""

She pouted. ""You don't like me anymore?""

""Give me your number,"" I said. ""We can go out. Go to the movies. Get dinner. Something else. But I'm not doing this anymore.""

""No,"" she said, all the playfulness drained away. ""This. This is what we do. I go to all this trouble to see you...This is where I want to see you. This is *how* I want to see you.""

""Then no."" I had thought I would be sad to say it. In fact, I was worried I wouldn't be able to say it at all. But it felt right, and it felt good. 

""You'll change your mind,"" she said, backing away, one foot swinging slowly behind the other. ""We'll talk again next time. I bet you'll change your mind."" And then she left.

All of which is a very roundabout way of saying yes, I realize that my work experience isn't what you would typically see in an applicant, but I firmly believe that my work ethic, decision-making, and self-motivation are all qualities that will profoundly benefit this Smoothie Hut.

341,"The only thing I know for certain right now is that I'm not supposed to be awake. The computer keeps telling me that my pod only opened as a safety precaution. *Bad data* caused a sensor misread which triggered a failsafe which caused me to wake up.

But I'm not supposed to *be* awake. And the computer won't shut up about it.

**Please return to your pod for the duration of the journey, Number 228-F.**

""Journey. To. *Where*?""

And then it goes silent again. Or goes back to the beginning, explaining why this whole thing is just a mistake so please get back in the pod Mr. 228-F. But I'm not going back because I have no idea what the hell is going on and the computer won't tell me.

**I am caretaker protocol only. I am not authorized to answer questions related to anything other than your present physical status. As previously noted, you are not scheduled to be released from HT-sleep until this vessel has successfully reached its programmed coordinates.**

""Which are what?""

**I am not authorized to provide that information. I am caretaker protocol only.**

So the computer's no help. Here's what I *do* know. 

I'm not alone. That part didn't require much detective work. There are three other pods besides mine. The casing's sort of frosted over, but I can tell it's two women and one man. The guy looks pretty bulky. One lady's got what looks like a tattoo of a constellation on her face. The other looks like a blank slate with hair. There's something taped to the inside of her shielding, but I can't see what it is from the back.  

Also, the computer's not full of shit when he says we're all supposed to stay in freeze from start to finish. This ship is *tiny*. Or...scratch that, actually. I don't know how big the ship is. All I know is that the chamber with the four pods is tiny and doesn't seem to connect to anything else. There's literally no place to go. So maybe this is just a little room in a big ship, or, more likely, this is just a really small automated ship, big enough to fly and carry around four people-pops.

**Please note: there is no dedicated source for atmosphere aboard this ship. The atmosphere you are experiencing has been generated by your pod. Your pod, however, has been designed to meet the requirements of a single occupant under stasis.**

""Are you saying I breathe too much?""

**At present rates of consumption, you will deplete the available supply of breathable atmosphere in 31 hours, 12 minutes.**

""You're gonna let me die? I thought you were a caretaker?""

**That is the limit of the functionality of your pod's life support system under the present conditions. You are advised to return to your pod and resume HT-sleep.**

""Yeah, yeah.""

I keep waiting for something to come back to me. Some explanation of what I'm doing on this ship. But I've got nothing. I have a vague sense of who I used to be, but no specifics. No events. I'm assuming this is all a side effect of the HT-sleep, but I'm not even sure of that. The computer says it has no insight into my mental state, only basic physical functions.

""Is it prison or something? War? You have to know where the hell we're going.""

**I am caretaker protocol only. I have no interconnectivity with any of this ship's other functions, including navigational protocol. You will now run out of breathable atmosphere in 31 hours, 2 minutes.**  

""Do you at least understand *why* I don't want to get back in the pod?""

**I do not have access to the systems required to answer that question.**

""Well, I'm sorry. But no can do.""

I do nothing for a while. I have a sneaking suspicion this ""caretaker protocol"" knows more than it's saying. It has to, right? Why would all these systems be completely independent and fully ignorant of each other? Who builds a ship like this? And if amnesia's a common side effect, why wouldn't you program the damn thing to answer a few simple questions? 

""I'm gonna break one of them out."" I pick the blank slate. She's seems like she'd be the easiest to subdue if she doesn't take to defrosting quite as smoothly as I did.

**Do not manipulate or damage the other pods. Stay back from the other pods.**

""I want answers. That's all. Answer my questions and I'll get back in my pod.""

**I am caretaker protocol only. I am not...**

""I know. I know."" I search the pod up and down, looking for a way in. The edges are sealed smooth. There's no handle. Not even any buttons to push. ""No chance I can talk you into opening this one up, is there?""

**The pods cannot be opened until arrive at...**

""*Never-goddamn-mind.*"" I smash into the pod, shoulder first. It flinches back in its cradle - just a bit. It's enough to give me hope. I ram it again and again. 

**You are in danger of causing catastrophic bone, joint, and muscle damage. Do not manipulate or damage the other pods. Oxygen intake has increased. You will now run out of breathable atmosphere in 27 hours, 21 minutes.**

Over and over, I smash into the pod. It's the only thing I can do. It's the only hope I have. I can't just get back into that pod. I can't. Where am I going? I mean, *where the fuck am I going*?

By the time I finally stop I can't feel my arm anymore.

**No reading. Number 228-G has perished. Diverting power from pod.**

""What?"" The light inside the pod dims, then goes black. The frost clears almost instantly. ""What happened?""

**Number 228-G has perished. Her pod's life support system was damaged. She was deprived of atmosphere and perished.**

This is a joke. This is some sick, stupid joke.

My arm's useless, so I use my legs, kicking at the two remaining pods, one after the other. The computer screams the same warnings over and over, but it's all just a joke. A sick, dumb joke. My knee twists and I fall over, breathing hard.

""What a joke. What a joke.""

I spit on the ground, then stumble into my pod. ""I don't care. I don't care. Close it. Freeze me. I don't care.""

The shielding slips into place. There's something taped to the clear plastic in front of me, just at head height. It's a picture. A picture of a plain woman. But she isn't plain, is she? She just looked plain...just on first glance.

346,"Bristhar has noticed. I should have known better. She knows every jewel in the horde by name, even the ancient ones - the ones forged before language.

She knows but she does not say anything. It is too much to wish that she will ignore this transgression. It is bad enough that she should know I took the ring. Worse still if she should ever discover what I have done with it.

I took it to the meadow, the one just south of the elven homestead. I tied it to the lowest branch of the tallest tree. It is the Princess' favorite tree. I could not be there to see her find it, but I did alight on a cliff some distance away and watched. Only to see if she would come that day. And she did. Later I returned to the meadow and found that the ring was gone. That was a good day.

Bristhar and the elders complain often of the homestead. It grows too large for their liking. 

""They will cross the boundary,"" Gallira says. ""They will forget the pact and cross the boundary. They cannot control themselves.""

""Good,"" says Bristhar. ""Then we will be justified in going to war once more.""

I cannot understand why the elders are so eager for war. The last war stretched across centuries. It crippled us both. We would need 200 years of peace to return to what we once were. And yet they wish for another war. Something about peace sits poorly in their stomachs.

Peace, however, sits well with me. As do the elves. They fascinate me. They are small and multitudinous. They live lives that last a fraction of our own. 

There is something in that brevity, perhaps, that lends a spark we cannot know. Do they make wiser use of their time, because it is so limited? Perhaps.

My fascination became something more when I first saw the Princess. She is golden-haired, like the rest, her eyes wide, her mouth narrow, her eyes a pale lavender color I have never seen anywhere else. It was not her face or her hair that interested me, however. No, it was her tongue.

We once shared a language, the elves and my kin - a language we created and they adopted. Somewhere in the course of our endless wars, the elves taught themselves a new language. It was symbolic, as well as strategic. We learned the language over many years, but by then they had created yet another new language. So the chase went, until eventually the elders decided that nothing the elves had to say was worth our understanding. Now we do not know their language, and I had presumed that they no longer knew ours, but this was not the case.

When I first saw the Princess she was sitting in the meadow, singing songs in the old language - *our* language. I landed and moved as close as I could without alerting her. I listened to her singing. It was beautiful. 

She sang old songs. Such old, old songs. Songs written when the elvish kind and dragon kind lived in peace. The first peace, before war became a reoccurring inevitability. We did not simply live in peace, then. We lived *together*, serving each other. We were stronger then than we are ever likely to become again.

That's when I fell in love with the elven princess known as Mailena.

She has seen me on occasion, though I try to be careful. When she does see me she does not run away. Instead, she presses forward, looking for me. Some days I think I may let her find me, but my nerve abandons me and I escape.

It would do neither of us any good to be seen speaking together.

I cannot fly over the homestead. None of us may. That was part of the pact. I do not know how Mailena lives when she leaves the meadow, but I must believe that one so beautiful and brave and wise lives in the finest castle, with the finest servants, the finest foods, and the finest amusements. She must. I know she must.

The days stretch on and still Bristhar says nothing about the ring. It was gold with a gem stone of the palest purple. Nearly the color of Mailena's eyes. Nearly. Nothing too grand, but nothing Bristhar can let stand. I wish I knew what she was planning...

I have gone to the meadow once more to see Mailena, but I cannot find her. I land near her tree, crestfallen, only to hear a familiar voice.

""Are you looking for me?""

As I turn, Mailena drops from her hiding place among the branches. 

""Why do you speak our language?"" I have many questions, but this the one that presents itself first.

""To speak with you,"" she replies.

This makes no sense. ""You already spoke the language when I first saw you.""

Mailena smiles. ""How do you know that you saw me first?""

As it goes, she had seen me first, on the outskirts of the meadow, while climbing in her tree. And it was not *her* tree until the day she first saw me. From then on she made a point to visit that tree every day, in the hopes of spotting me.

We speak for hours, then I offer her my back and we fly. Her cries of joy are the most wondrous sound I have ever heard. We travel over the mountains - away, away. We chase the sunset and split the waves of a waterfall. It is like a dream to me.

When we return the valley is aflame. I set Mailena down on a cliff a safe distance away and fly off to investigate. Bristhar and the others are setting fire to the homestead. The elves are streaming forth from the burning wreckage of their homes, riding their horses, arrows flying high into the black sky. 

I find Wendira circling above.

""What happened?"" I cry.

""The elves rode out to war,"" he replies, almost joyously. ""They claim we took one of theirs. Finally, we may finish this.""

""Stop!"" I shout. ""We have to stop!""

But Wendira is already diving back towards the homestead, drawing in a tremendous breath while arrows and javelins fly up to meet him.

In the distance, Bristhar and Gallira are urging the rest of the kin onward. Below, the elves scream and rally and charge.

I do not know what to do, so I return to Mailena. 

""I am sorry,"" I say. ""They are fighting. They...are killing each other. It is not safe for you there.""

""Or you,"" she says. 

""Your kingdom,"" I say. ""I am not sure it will survive.""

It is too dark for me to see if she is crying, but I hear her take a deep breath. ""Can we fly?""

""To where?""

""Away,"" she says. ""It doesn't matter where.""

I dip my wing and the Princess takes my back. We fly slowly through the darkness. 

I have never felt such happiness. ",2016-06-16 22:11:43+00:00,d4c8ael,1.0,t3_4ofk4a,5247.0,WritingPrompts
347,"I don't seer for anyone under the age of 13. Not a big enough social fingerprint. With kids that young it's guesswork, basically, and I'm better than guesswork. This kid just happened to be on the right side of the cut off.

""Is this even *your* money?"" I poked at the crumpled pile of 5's and 10's the girl had dropped like autumn leaves on my desk.

""What does that matter?"" She was wearing a stiff, yellow trucker hat with the phrase HAN YOLO stitched in bright pink. And her name was Wyoming. This was not going to be a difficult read. 

""Well it's better for me if you didn't rob your parents to pay for this session. This cash gets confiscated, I'm guessing you're not coming back to cover that shortfall.""

""It's money,"" she said, slumping down in the chair opposite. ""What difference does it make?""

""Right. Sure."" I pushed the cash into a desk drawer. ""So...what do you want to know?""

""Are Sara and Tyler hooking up?""

I tried not to roll my eyes. That's a thing I do. It's off-putting. I know this. I'm working on it. It's important you know that I *tried*.

""That's...do you know what a fortune teller is? Or, specifically, what a fortune is? How it's a future thing...that happens in the *future*...to you. And *not* Sara. Or Todd...""

""Tyler.""

""If you want to know if your friends are fucking, you should hire a detective. I mean you *shouldn't*. That's gross. But that's where that particular kind of gross comes from. Got it?"" 

I pulled the drawer back open, fully expecting that she'd want her wad of stripper bucks returned, but instead she just nodded.

""Okay. Well. How about this: will Tyler and I end up together at some point?""

""Ah. Alright."" I cracked my knuckles and leaned into my ancient laptop. ""What's Taylor's last name?""

""It's *Tyler*. Tyler Pleasance.""

I found Tyler in her Facebook friend's list right away. He also seemed fond of stupid hats. And Jesus. And football. And crunches. His Twitter was equally littered with harmless stupidity, midwestern values, and semi-coherent bro chatter. He also followed a baker's dozen of porn stars.

The trick - and this sounds exceedingly pretension, but whatever - the trick was not to read too deeply into what anyone actually *said* or *did* on social media. What they *didn't* say or do told just as big a story.

Sara and Tyler were Facebook official, so to speak, but he hardly ever posted about the relationship. All the couple photos were coming from Sara, with Tyler tagged. And it wasn't that Tyler didn't share things - he shared significantly more than I appreciated having to sort through. Just nothing about Sara.

Then there was this: Wyoming (*god almighty, what a stupid name*) had something like a goddamn terabyte of bikini photos on Facebook, over 50 percent of which had been liked by Tyler. That's what I like to call the Red Zone. 

""Yeah,"" I said, leaning back and rubbing my eyes. ""Here's what's gonna happen. I'm telling you right now that you and Terrance are gonna end up together. This is going to create something of a paradox, but you don't really give a shit about that, so we're going to ignore it. As a result of today's session, however, you're going to start flirting more openly with T-Pain. He'll reciprocate. Sara will be pissed. They'll fight. They'll break up. You get the guy.""

Wyoming tried not to smile (kids don't like smiling in front of adults if they can help it), but her eyes sparkled all the same. ""Really? For real? For really real?""

""Yeah. Less than a month, I'd say. Which, coincidentally, is about how long you'll last.""

""Shut up!"" She slapped her hands down on my desk. Just then I noticed she had watches on both wrists. Is that a thing? Double watches? I don't think I get it. ""Why not longer?""

""Honestly? You're gonna have sex. And then he's not really gonna care anymore, because both of you are deeply uninteresting people. But that's fine, though. Nobody's interesting at your age. I wouldn't sweat it much.""

She was scowling then. Very, very hard. ""I think you're full of shit.""

""Reminder of the refund policy,"" I said. ""No refunds.""

""Will...will I at least get married someday?"" She was still scowling, but there was another face behind the frown. A scared face. A young face. A child's face. I forget sometimes that kids are still people.

I flipped through her pages for a few silent minutes. I'm never quite sure what I'm looking for. I just know that I always find it.

In Wyoming's case it was a picture of her and a dog. I don't know why that picture, but then that's never been something I could answer.

""Yeah,"" I said finally. ""But not for a while. Not until you're 30...32ish. You've got some bad relationships ahead of you. At least two of them are gonna treat you like absolute dog shit. I'm sorry that's gonna happen, but you'll survive it. And you'll figure out *you*. Then you'll nail down a career and you'll live your life and he'll just show up one day. Nice part there is you'll know right away. So, it's a hard road, but not a bad one by any stretch. So...there you go.""

Wyoming stared at me for a long time after that. I'm not sure what she was doing exactly. Thinking, maybe? Some kids still do that, right? Something was cooking, that's for sure. Maybe I was watching a teenage girl come to grips with her place in the world? Maybe she was working up the nerve to say ""thank you."" Or maybe it was something else entirely.

""So Tyler definitely wants to fuck me?""

I closed my eyes and closed my laptop. ""I think we're done here.""

""But *definitely*?"" said Wyoming as she gathered her things. ""I don't want to act like I want to fuck him if he doesn't want to fuck me.""

""Session over,"" I said, leading her towards the door. ""Goodbye, Idaho.""

""It's Wyoming. Is he gonna want oral? Do I need to practice?""

I closed and locked the door, sliding to the floor.

""Ah shit. They're not gonna use a condom, are they?"" I poked my head out the door, but the girl had disappeared. Oh well. Some things you're better off figuring out on your own. ",2016-06-14 03:59:54+00:00,d48bm94,1.0,t3_4nyico,16079.0,WritingPrompts

349,"There was simply no reasoning with that woman.

""VULTURES! THIEVES!"" she shrieked. The man seemed a bit more sensible, but only inasmuch as he was not himself shouting at anyone just then. ""SHAKEDOWN ARTISTS! MONSTERS!""

""This is *eternity* madam,"" I said, my level voice floating just above her tantrum. ""Don't you think your mother deserves the most comfortable possible resting place for the next phase of her journey?""

""IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!"" the woman continued to shout. ""SHE'S DEAD! WHAT DOES SHE CARE ABOUT COMFORT?""

A wailing woman crossed the showroom floor just then, distracting my client just long enough for me to regain control of the pitch. ""The price is steep, I understand. And you may question whether or not your mother will be able to properly *appreciate* all the luxuries offered by this model. But I can assure you - *it makes a difference*.""

""Right!"" said the woman. ""Natural. She loved nature, Mum did. You remember how she always liked to sit in the garden and write those angry letters to celebrities?""

""Nature,"" said the man, nodding. 

""Why does she need a box at all?"" said the woman excitedly. ""We ought to just put her in the ground, in the garden. Natural. That's how they used to do it back her day anyway.""

""I can assure you that is not accurate,"" I said. ""And if you're so strongly opposed to a casket, again, I believe it's time to reconsider cremation.""

""FIEND!"" screamed the woman. ""Burn her body to ash? You horrid man! And besides, that's more expensive than the damn casket.""

""For just a bit of fire, too,"" said the man. ""I can't figure it.""

""Listen,"" I said, pulling the pair towards the cheapest model I could recommend in good conscience. ""You can't just put her in the ground. That's a health hazard. Your township would never go for it. Moreover, it's dangerous. You've got to take my word on that. You don't want your mother buried in your garden unboxed. That will...not be pleasant for you. So you either need to cremate her or you need to put her in a casket. This one is 25 percent less expensive than that other one. Strong wood. Steel rods for reinforcement. Airtight - double seal. What do you say?""

The man and the woman looked at each for a moment. 

""And you called the animal shelter?"" said the woman.

The man nodded. ""They don't do human cremation.""

""What about online?""

""What about it?""

The woman sighed. ""Did you look up caskets online? Everything's cheaper online.""

""No. No, didn't think to do that.""

The woman smiled. ""I bet they've got real cheap caskets online. And online they won't sass and moan like this one."" Here she jerked a clawed thumb in my direction. ""Let's go. I bet we can find a great deal and we can use the savings on a cruise or something.""

""Your Mum liked boats,"" said the man. ""She'd like us to go on a cruise.""

The pair began to exit the showroom. ""Wait!"" I cried. ""You don't want to buy here. That's fine. Do as you will. But here's something to consider - her brain.""

""Her *brain*?"" said the man.

""Yes,"" I said. ""Her brain. I'm sure you'd agree she doesn't need it anymore. Why not donate it to science?""

""Science?"" The woman let the word roll slowly off her tongue, like a gob of frozen molasses. ""And what's science gonna give me for it?""

I blinked. ""Ten dollars.""

The woman sniffed. The man sniffed in reply. 

""Mum always did like science,"" said the woman.

""Yeah,"" said the man. ""Always mad for science.""

350,"Faith was an ancient anathema. Violent. Senseless. 

When Silver Slip had been young - before the training, before the mindcrest had been placed in the hollow chamber below his frontal lobe - he had marveled at the stories of golden civilizations, brought high by the fervent toil of the faithful; later crushed to ash and cinder by that same wild worship.

The crested had no time for his questions in those days. It served no purpose to alleviate a single boy of his soft wondering. So Silver Slip was left to imagine. 

*To believe in things that cannot be seen...*

*To believe in things that cannot be proven...*

*To live and die and kill and create for things that never were and never could be...*

He could not grasp it. Even uncrested, his imagination was not strong enough.

As a man, though - as a chosen Delegate, fully primed, synaptic ratios in the 99th percentile of his birthing stable - he understood at least why such things could not be tolerated in the growing reaches of the Collective. 

""They are gathered, sir.""

Silver Slip turned from the window to face the young officer. ""My apologies. I do not recall your name.""

""Yellow Pall,"" said the young officer.

""Is this your first Refutation?""

Yellow Pall nodded. ""I did serve on one of the initial scouting missions to this planet. I am familiar with the four largest belief systems.""

""But not all?"" said Silver Slip. 

""There are thousands,"" said the young officer. ""Fractured versions of the major systems, themselves fractured versions of an original worship that no longer exists. It would not be efficient to fully research all variations, especially when some are practiced by only a handful.""

""A handful is enough,"" said Silver Slip. ""Fire is never content. Corrupted cells do not have the good grace to simply die. The corrupt others. You are right, though. If today goes well, it will not matter. And that is up to me. Lead the way.""

Yellow Pall tied back the white canvas covering and stepped out of the caravan. Sliver Slip followed, careful to walk slowly, without fault.

The crowd beyond was staggering, and more staggering still for its silence. None spoke. 

The planet featured two forms of intelligent life, one of the earth, and the other of the sea. By some chance, these non-competing lifeforms had not managed to master cross-species communication and so were viewed by the Collective as wholly separate. Opal Chance had been commissioned with the Refutation of the sea species.

The land creatures were of a similar shape and size as Silver Slip's people. Their forelimbs were significantly longer and thinner, their hindlimbs bowed and thick. The danger, should there be any, would likely come from those heavy hindlimbs.

They had no necks, their heads fused to a torso that could rotate a full 180 degrees in either direction. Their eyes were wide and double-lidded, most likely an evolutionary reaction to the planet's extended periods of darkness.

""Thank you for extending such great hospitality and trust,"" said Silver Slip, his naturally resonant voice carrying like a thunderclap across the gathered crowd. Two of the natives had volunteered to become translators. Learning the speech naturally would have taken too long, so they were provided with modified mindcrests to hasten the process.

""You have been selected for inclusion into our Collective. This is both an honor and a great responsibility. The Collective was formed in a time long since past for the purpose of peace. That is all. Peace and prosperity. We discovered that all may prosper in this immense universe, but only through a strict, unbending adherence to reason and fact. In the Collective there are no beliefs. There are facts. There is no worship. There is truth - plain and clear as the black nothingness that spreads between the stars.

""We believe that you thrive as a member of the Collective, but first you must set aside all that cannot be proven. All that you accept, but cannot verify, must be set free. This is your faith. These are your Gods.""

Sliver Slip paused to allow the crowd to consider his words. He expected turmoil. Cries. Shouting. Here was where it truly began - the Refutation. None had ever given away their faith without a struggle.

But the crowd remained silent. The translators looked back at Silver Slip, awaiting his next words.

""Do you understand?""

One of the crowd stepped forward. Silver Slip had not yet learned how to identify gender among the species, so he was unsure if this was a man or a woman or one of the null-gendered who often served as tribal leaders. It spoke briefly.

""Quay says we do not understand how one may set aside their God,"" said one of the translators.

""It is simple,"" said Silver Slip. ""You accept that they do not exist. There *are* no gods. There are no spirits. There is nothing that cannot be explained. I ask that you accept the real and reject the unreal.""

The one called Quay spoke once more. 

""How do we determine what is real and what is unreal?"" said the other translator.

Silver Slip gestured to Yellow Pall. ""Which is the most popular creation myth?""

""Mother Gronda,"" said Yellow Pall. ""The great mother figure who...""

""Yes, yes, I know."" Silver Slip turned to the crowd. ""Gronda. Who seeded the earth? And toiled a thousand years to make the world fertile? She is unreal. There is no evidence of her. She is a lie, told to explain a truth you were not yet ready to understand. But there is a real truth. The formation of life here began with a single-celled organism. This can be proven. This is real.""

Silver Slip pointed to the sky. ""Alacant, who brings you rain? Is not real. We can show you where the rain comes from. We can prove its origin. That is real. If you leave your false beliefs behind you can come with us. You can join the Collective. And there will be no war and no famine. We will provide you with everything you need to live, free from pain and destruction.""

Silver Slip stepped back as the translators finished his speech. Again there was silence. Finally, Quay spoke once more.

""What is the difference?"" said the translator. ""What is the difference between the way we believe, which we understand, and the way you believe, which we do not understand? Is not understanding the most important part? To believe what you believe requires an even *greater* amount of faith.""

Yellow Pall shook his head. ""We were wrong about this place,"" he said bitterly. ""They are not ready. This is a waste.""

""No,"" said Silver Slip. ""This simply means they cannot join as full, honored members. Not yet. In a few generations...perhaps. But for now...""

Silver Slip opened a channel back to *The Gharthin*.

""Ensign. There's an orchard 2.85 leagues southwest of my location and a cattle yard 0.7 leagues east of that. Destroy them both.""

""Aye.""

Silver Slip stepped forward once more. ""You are right. Understanding is all that matters. So I ask that you understand this: your gods cannot protect you, because they are not real. Your gods cannot send you water or food, because they are not real. Your gods cannot give you medicine or heal your sick, because *they are not real.* But I am real. My people are real. The Collective is real. And we can do things your gods have never thought to do.""

The sky above turned pink as a distant screech filled the air. The sonic wail grew louder and louder until finally two fiery red columns of light pierced the atmosphere above, slamming into the earth somewhere to the south. The resultant *CRACK* came screaming across the massive crowd like a shockwave, sending those gathered scattering in a wild panic. 

The air smelled of ion, burning wood, and rendered fat.

""This way is longer,"" said Silver Slip, as Yellow Pall followed him back into the caravan. ""And not ideal. But in the end...in the end everything will be as it should.""

The caravan headed off towards the encampment, the air thick with screams and pleas that could not be heard, because no one was listening.            ",2016-06-11 16:55:17+00:00,d450y7o,1.0,t3_4nl6s7,16405.0,WritingPrompts
351,"""That's just the pitch office,"" grunted Satan, leading the way down a narrow hallway, cabled end to end with buzzing florescents. ""I only use that for sales purposes. I spend more than 2 hours a day in there the room's gonna reek of sulfur and I really can't afford to lose my deposit. In here.""

He gestured towards a small room with no door. ""Yeah, it used to be janitor's closet. That's the grind, kid.""

Satan stumped into the room, grabbing the only chair (a bent, metal folding chair) and leaning back against the wall. ""Say your piece.""

I propped myself casually against the opposite wall, elbow-to-concrete, fist-to-chin. ""Well, it's simple. I want my soul back.""

Satan laughed, then reached down and began to pick absently at his cloven hooves. ""Contract is unbreakable. Not in this lifetime. Not in this plane of existence. Not in the past or the future. Forever and ever, your soul belongs to me.""

I tried to keep it cool. ""Well, sure. But I think we can both agree there was a fair amount of misrepresentation happening during that pitch of yours.""

""No, no. No."" Satan shook his head, the curved horns waggling like twin snakes. ""It's all in the fine print. I'm not responsible if you can't be bothered to read a contract before you sign it. And I didn't promise you anything that you can't have. All that stuff we talked about - including all the super sick shit everyone pretends they're not into, even though it's the stuff they're *most* into - that's all yours. You just gotta hit the numbers.""

""Yeah, but you have to admit - a *thousand* souls is a lot of souls. I'm not sure I've even *seen* a thousand different people in my whole life.""

Satan waved his hand. ""Sit sit. You're getting yourself too worked up over this.""

I took a seat on the floor in front of Satan.

""A thousand *is* a lot,"" agreed Satan. ""But only if you think about it as a single number. You need to get a lot more granular with this. How about one a day? Just one a day? That'll take you less than four years.""

""I don't know,"" I said, covertly attempting to create additional space between myself and the Dark Lord. What he had said earlier about the sulfur smell was potentially an understatement. ""Not everyone wants demonic powers. Certainly not enough to sell their soul...""

""Ah!"" said Satan. ""There's the trick, isn't it? You need *souls*. That's all. Doesn't really matter what you trade to get them. Someone doesn't want dark powers, fine. Find out what they DO want.""

""Like what?""

Satan shrugged. ""Well, if you've got a sports fan, say. And they want their team to win the Super Bowl - that's where you swoop in.""

My mouth hung open a moment. ""How am I supposed to manage that? I can't control who wins the Super Bowl!""

""Of course not,"" said Satan. ""Neither can I. Neither can God. That's strictly an Illuminati thing. BUT - that's doesn't mean you can't make the deal. You hear someone say *I'd sell my soul to see the Browns win a Super Bowl* you jump in there! Except maybe not that example. You don't want to out yourself as a fraud. But if someone's offering up their soul, you take it. Then, if their team by some chance *does* win - BOOM! Easy money. And if their team loses, well whatever. Nothing gained, nothing lost.""

""Is that ethical?""

Satan blinked. ""What the hell?""

""Right,"" I said. ""So if someone offers up their soul for a trade, I can take the offer. And do nothing?""

""Exactly. The world is chaos, man. Sometimes people get what they want. I mean, they were going to get it anyway. But they don't know that. So, you know - may as well let them give you their soul.""

""I suppose that's reasonable.""

Satan adjusted his tie. ""And don't underestimate how many people out there would like demonic powers. All the fire and mind control and pestilence and such. You get a handful of people out there working for you, and they get a few people working for them, bing bang boom, you're rolling in souls in no time.""

I nodded. I had to admit, I felt much more at ease. ""And the...uh...the great leathery wings?""

""Ah, well, that's not really a demonic power,"" said Satan. ""More of an accessory. If you're really keen on wings, I'm sure we could make that happen for you, but technically, not part of the deal.""

I popped up to my feet. Satan held out a hand and I helped him to his feet as well. 

""I could tell,"" said Satan. ""Right when I saw you. I said *Here's a guy who gets it*. Glad to have you on the team.""

""Thanks for the time,"" I said. ""Incidentally, what are you going to do with my soul?""

""Sell it to Amazon,"" said Satan. ""They're apparently great for packing boxes.""

""Ah."" I left Satan there in his doorless office and went out into the street. I saw a homeless man standing on the corner with a sign asking for food or money.

""Sir,"" I said to the homeless man. ""I'd like to walk you over to that restaurant and buy you a steak. Would that be okay?""

The homeless man's eyes went wide. He nodded vigorously.

""Excellent!"" I said, putting my hand on the man's back and directing him towards the restaurant. ""There's just the matter of some paperwork I need you to sign first.""",2016-06-11 02:06:40+00:00,d44fres,1.0,t3_4nioy3,14784.0,WritingPrompts
352,"""*Entrapment.* You know what entrapment is, right? This is entrapment. Get me a lawyer. I'm gonna sue the hell out of you guys.""

""Right, right,"" said Rodriguez, patting the perp on the back. ""Entrapment. Entrapment made you clobber that old lady with a rack of Corn Nuts.""

""Listen, something came over me. It wasn't natural. I'm not like that.""

""Word is she's allergic to nuts,"" said Miller, shaking his head. ""Lucky you're not looking at murder charges.""

""First of all, I don't think Corn Nuts are nuts. They're corn. And second of all, I don't know what happened, but *something* made me do that. That's not me. I'm not angry like that.""

""You're right,"" said Rodriguez, sitting down across from the perp. He dropped a baggie of white powder on the table. ""Dealers carrying this much blow usually don't go ham in a 7/11. But it happened. And here we are. Assault's one thing, but these drug trafficking charges we're working up? Ooooh, boy. Those are gonna be *nasty*.""

""But you know,"" said Miller, ""we're like game show contestants here. We always love to make a good deal. You like making deals, punk?""

""I don't know what...""

Rodriguez slammed his fists down on the table. ""20 years, man. Slam dunk. Or you can help us climb up that ladder.""

""Just one rung,"" said Miller. ""We're reasonable men. Guy above you is plenty. You do that, you're looking at six months for the assault and a whole mess of community service. Better than 20 years, right?""

""You think about it,"" said Rodriguez, standing up. ""We'll get a public defender in here soon. Help you ruminate on your options.""

Rodriguez and Miller left the interrogation room. 

""Coffee?"" said Miller.

""Black,"" said Rodriguez. Miller headed off towards the vending machines, while Rodriguez made his way up to the roof.

""You there?"" he whispered. The night was chilly and dark.

""Will he cooperate?"" said a voice like pennies in a garbage disposal.

""Yeah, think so. Did it have to be an old lady?""

""I can't control that,"" said the voice. ""She was writing a check for one can of cat food. Even I wanted to pop her.""

""Well, I suppose it all washes out,"" said Rodriguez, wandering up to the edge of the roof. ""This gets us one step closer to El Chico Malo. We get him, get his shit off the streets, makes it a better place for everyone. Even old ladies. We get the name, you'll be there to help us out again?""

""No,"" said the voice. ""Not right away. Something's come up.""

""What? I thought you were with us here, man? You're helping us clean up these streets.""

""I am. But I'm needed elsewhere. There's...*someone* out there. Someone dangerous. Someone only I can handle. Once I'm done there, I'll be back.""

Rodriguez spit over the edge. ""Well, when's that gonna be?"" But there was no reply.

""These numbers are ridiculous,"" said Theresa, turning the smartphone sideways to make sure she wasn't seeing things. ""That orphanage stunt bought you 10 points! *Ten*! How did you come up with that?""

Carson Von Fossal tugged at the gold and platinum cufflinks that jutted like mini pyramids from the ends of his coat sleeves. ""I don't know and frankly, I'd prefer that you never bring it up again. I can still see all those grubby, little hands reaching out to me. I just kicked sleeping pills and now I'm going to have to go right back. What the hell happened to me? It was like I was possessed. Is it too late to get the money back?""

""You don't want to do that, sir,"" said Theresa. ""The PR was too good. Let's just let it go.""

""When I'm President, I want all of the orphanages in this country condemned!"" The limo rattled as it climbed an ancient bridge. Von Fossal fought the urge to hug himself tight and blot out the bad memories.

""I don't believe that's something you can do,"" said Theresa.

""Well then what's the goddamned point!"" 

""I know you don't like that it happened, but this is a good thing. Combined with that steel mill you re-opened and that grieving old woman you comforted, you have made massive strides to reverse a lot of unpopular opinions. You're becoming almost populist.""

Von Fossal shook his head. ""I swear to God, Theresa, I will throw you out of this car if you don't stop bringing that up. Did you schedule that doctor appointment?""

""Yes, but...""

""It must be the meds,"" said Von Fossal. ""Something combined with something to cause this...this *bad* reaction.""

""But it's *good*!"" said Theresa, holding the phone out to Von Fossal. ""You were unelectable in a general election just two weeks ago. And *now you're ahead!* I know you don't like it, but you need to keep this up. At least until after the election.""

""NO!"" Von Fossal reached around and opened up the intercom to the driver. ""Stop. Now.""

""Sir, please,"" said Theresa. ""These heels...""

But it was Von Fossal that leapt out of the car, stomping off across the street, hands packed firmly against his head.

""No! No! Noooooo!"" he shouted, shouldering his was past bystanders.

""I know you,"" said a woman. ""You're Carson! I love you! I'm voting for you!""

But Von Fossal wasn't listening. He began to run down the sidewalk. He had no idea where he was going. He didn't care.

Eventually he reached a busy intersection. People were staring at him as they passed, but there was one man in particular...he was seated on top of a mailbox, crosslegged with his hands below his chin.

""Carson, it's okay,"" said the man. ""I know you don't like it, but I can assure you, it's you. It's a part of you. Everyone has a little, bitty good part in them, even the rogue's like you. Don't sweat it. I'm just trying to help. I think you're going to be a *wonderful* President.""

""I don't understand,"" said Von Fossal. ""Who are...""

He was interrupted by a screech of tires. A yellow and white sports car whipped around a stalled car, barreling wildly towards the intersection. A woman was crossing the road, pushing a stroller. Almost completely against his will (but not fully), Von Fossal dove into the street, pushing the woman and the stroller into safety.

""Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god,"" jibbered the woman. ""You saved me. You saved my baby!""

""It's Carson Von Fossal!"" shouted someone in the growing crowd. ""He just saved that baby!""

The crowd pushed forward, chanting Von Fossal's name.

Down a nearby alleyway, The Hidden Man skipped and hummed, deeply pleased with himself. He had, for the longest time, considered his power to be a curse. But then - *but then* - he finally realized that he simply hadn't been using it correctly. 

""It's not the size of the power that counts,"" he giggled. ""It's how you use it.""

The now-distant chanting stopped abruptly. The Hidden Man stopped, turning back to listen. The cheers had turned to screams. Angry shouts. *Boos* even.

""What in the...""

""It's over."" The Hidden Man flinched, whipping his head around. A man in a black trench coat stood farther along the alleyway, mostly obscured in shadow.

""How?""

""Doesn't matter,"" spoke the man, his voice garbled and raw. ""Von Fossal lost it out there. Punched the woman. Punched the baby. Punched everything he could reach. They don't elect baby-punchers in this country.""

The Hidden Man's face went white with rage. ""And just who the hell are you?"" 

""You,"" said the man. ""I'm the same as you. No better or worse. I just picked a better hobby. See you next time.""

""Next time?!?"" shouted The Hidden Man. ""*Next time!?!*""

But he was the only one in the alley, his voice echoing shrilly into the cold bricks and open sky.       ",2016-06-10 14:54:51+00:00,d43oqxw,1.0,t3_4nfou2,15880.0,WritingPrompts
353,"Chad had been masturbating, rather lethargically and with no obvious end in sight, when he looked up to discover that he was no longer in his studio apartment.

He thought at first that he may have blacked out, because this was a thing that sometimes happened when he sniffed markers and played with himself for more than 45 minutes. But this was not the case.

Instead of his apartment, Chad was in an endless, white room. To his immediate left, some sort of alligator-man sat twiddling his hooked claws and muttering to himself. To the right, a clear cube filled with phosphorescent leaves blinked and hummed like a old man at a bus stop.

Further up and down the line on both sides, odd creatures of light and slime and prehensile tails sat, waiting patiently. So Chad did the same. He was not wearing pants, because of the masturbation, but then no one else seemed to have pants, so he decided not to dwell on it.

After a time, two cylinders of swirling light - one red, the other sort of bluish - appeared before Chad.

""Chad Burns?""

Chad nodded. ""Present?""

""Chad - do you have prior knowledge of the events that occurred on starscale 00:45:919 in the Chronium Rim, 187th parallel?""

Chad could not tell which column of light was talking to him, so he made sure to look at both so as to avoid causing offense.

""What?""

""Chad - have you ever met or associated with the Tobathian known as Handus the Narrow-Footed?""

""...what?""

""Chad - do you consider yourself biased against Tobathians as a race?""

Chad considered this one a hard moment. ""Come again?""

""I have no cause for rejection.""

""I have no cause for rejection.""

The columns of red and blue light disappeared. The alligator-man seemed to be laughing, but Chad couldn't be sure about that one way or the other.

Some time later, a block of wood dressed in sequins and glass beads appeared before the alligator, muttering words the alligator-man seemed to understand. He disappeared from the endless white room almost immediately. The beaded block of wood then stood in front of the cube of leaves and hummed a tune that Chad thought might be a Cars song. The cube disappeared. The block of wood ignored Chad and disappeared into the whiteness of the room's endless horizon.

Chad was glad the room was not especially cold.

A table appeared before Chad. On the edge of the table was a sheaf of paper and a sharpened pencil. Chad had not considered the possibility that there would be a test. Fortunately, the pages were blank.

Other tables appeared around the room - left, right, above, and below. Each table was uniquely shaped to accommodate the uniquely shaped creature that was soon sitting behind those desks. There was a mosquito-man and an anvil-man and something like a crock-pot with a bun of silvery grandma hair. There were a hundred at least, and none that looked even a little bit like Chad. At the very least, he continued to feel at ease in his pantslessness.

In the center of the sphere of floating desks a cylinder of orange light appeared, followed closely by the red and blue cylinders. Chad waved.

In between the red and blue cylinders a final being appeared. This last thing was very nearly human, except it's feet were abnormally narrow. Chad tried his best not to stare.

""Handus the Narrow-Footed - you have been charged with three counts of astrolarceny. How do you plead?""

The narrow-footed man stood to speak. Chad worried that he might fall over on such preposterously slender feet.

""Guilty, your honor.""

""Really?""

""Yes.""

""Well...""

""I *said* he would, didn't I?""

""They always say they will and then they don't.""

The man shrugged. ""Well, I did it. Take me away.""

""Hum. Very well. Sentencing tomorrow. Court is adjourned. Return the jury.""

Chad's desk disappeared. ""That's it?"" One of the wooden blocks appeared. 

""Earth, correct?""

""Yeah,"" said Chad. ""Jersey. Petersburg. Sun...""

""Well, is it Jersey or Petersburg?"" 

""Uh. Jersey. But Petersburg is a to..."" 

""Thank you for your service,"" said the wooden block in a voice even more wooden than you'd expect from a wooden block. ""The Galactic Consortium of Justice appreciates your efforts today. Goodbye.""

Then Chad was on a beach. It was very cold and rocky and not at all familiar.  

Chad made a mental note to keep his pants on while masturbating and began to walk.   ",2016-06-09 21:07:27+00:00,d42tje2,1.0,t3_4nbwxm,12757.0,WritingPrompts
354,"The bottom edge of the painted textile sheath briefly caught fire as 0109011 walked past the low, stone basin of flame.

""Lady, watch out! Yer on fire!""

0109011 glanced down the length of holowax body 000701 had fashioned for the mission. It was an odd model, quad-limbed and riddled with damp, secret chambers. It was hairless and shell-less, requiring covering for social/cultural reasons that 0109011 did not feel inclined to investigate.

An ape-ling appeared as if from nowhere, squatting down before 0109011 and swiping at the flames with a clutch of white cloth.

""Careful miss,"" said the ape-ling. ""Don't stand so close to the fireplace, okay?""

""Yes,"" said 0109011, following the ape-ling back towards the long, wooden slab and taking a seat in the pose 2001441 had named *demure*.

""Do you know the stars?"" said 0109011.

The ape-ling rubbed the white cloth across the wooden slab in a thoughtful manner. ""The stars?"" it said. ""I guess. I mean, I see 'em every night. I don't know the names of 'em. Except the North Star. My father taught me how to find that one, in case I ever get lost. Why? What about the stars?""

""They're moving,"" said 0109011. ""Did you know that? Away from each other. Very fast. Spreading out across an infinite field of blackness. Every moment they get further apart.""

""That's a lonely thought,"" said the ape-ling. 

""Faster and faster,"" said 0109011. ""The darkness between growing greater and greater with each moment.""

The ape-ling pointed up. ""No more stars in the night sky?""

0109011 reached down the slab and retrieved a hollow cylinder, half full with a black, warm liquid. ""Touch it.""

The ape-ling did as it was told. ""Still a bit warm. Did you want a cup?""

0109011 poured the contents out across the slab.

""Hey!"" said the ape-ling. 

""Touch it again.""

The ape-ling shook it's head, but dipped a finger into the spreading black. ""Cooler, sure."" It used the cloth to clear away the liquid.

""This is happening all around,"" said 0109011. ""As the stars fly apart the universe will freeze...and eventually die.""

""Huh,"" said the ape-ling. ""When's that happening?""

""Many years from now,"" said 0109011. ""A far horizon, but a horizon all the same. All will end. There is nothing that can stop this. Everything we have made will end. That is the crushing reality of life - that it's end is unavoidable.""

""Sure, sure,"" said the ape-ling. ""That's a hard lesson, for sure. I had a dog named Ace when I was a kid. Hound. Best friend I ever had. Lived a long, good life. Died all the same. I didn't accept it then, but that's the thing about death, I suppose. Doesn't matter one bit if you accept it. Just happens. So you deal with it. I'm alive now. Some day I won't be. So it goes.""

""I don't understand,"" said 0109011. ""How does the weight of understanding not crush you? In the face of death - in the shadow of certain oblivion - what is the value of existence?""

The ape-ling laughed. ""You're real serious, aren't you? You ever see those people that build castles in the sand down on the beach? They spend all day on those things, then the tide comes in and it's like it was never there. But the castles were there. They made 'em. They saw 'em. They appreciated 'em. And that's enough. Nothin's forever. Some things hardly last a moment at all. But the moment's enough. The stars are up there right now. And it's plenty hot out. Isn't that enough? At least for today?""

0109011 stood up. ""Thank you. Where I come from they speak of your ignorance as a curse. And they mocked me for coming here. But I was right. You are the most blessed creatures in all the stars. Thank you. Thank you.""

The bartender watched the woman go, shaking his head and laughing just a bit.

""She was right about you bein' ignorant,"" said Raul, taking the woman's place at the bar. ""Don't know about the rest of that.""

Timothy poured a foamy mug of beer and slid it across the bartop to Raul's waiting hands. ""Don't know either,"" he said. ""And that's just how I like it.""

The men laughed and the fire roared and someone started singing. It was a good day and a good place to be alive, if only for a moment. ",2016-06-09 14:46:24+00:00,d42bt0r,1.0,t3_4narwo,4855.0,WritingPrompts
355,"""Calvin's Pillar,"" said Graham, pushing back from the monitor. ""Remnants of an supernova. Absolutely filthy with ionized gas and synchrotron radiation. If they're in there, we're gonna have a hell of a time finding them.""

Bashera had never seen anything so gorgeous in her life. Golden, electric tendrils slid through pulsing fields of interlapping aqua and gray. The nebula swirled and danced like a frozen hurricane, waves of fire and ice crowding together like pressed layers of marble.

""But they'll see and hear as well as we will?"" said Bashera.

Graham shrugged. ""That's one way to look at it.""

""There's three of us and one of them,"" said Bashera. ""That's how I'm looking at it.""

""So we're going in?"" said Turner.

Bashera nodded. ""Ping *Black* and *Tan*. Tell them to follow our lead.""

""This numbers advantage doesn't really comfort me when we're playing the sword *and* the shield,"" sighed Graham.

""Think of it this way,"" said Bashera. ""We go in, we find *The Ballast*, we capture Renfield, we go home. Alternately, we don't go in, Renfield escapes, and we keep at this chase for another three standards. Which sounds better to you?""

Graham turned back to his monitor. ""No offense, Captain, but that's where you and I differ. Because when I see a multiple choice question and I don't like any of the answers, I just write in a new one. But again...that's just me.""

Selene Bashera had a hundred replies ready on the tip of her tongue, but left them all there to dry out and coast away on a silent sigh. Zain Graham had never been her choice for First Officer. She wasn't sure she would have even picked him for kitchen duty. But Fleet politics were what they were. There was no such thing as a fully loyal crew. You made do.

*The UTPA Gold* made a wide rotation across the visible edge of the nebula, adjusting parallels until the center pitch was aimed square on the estimated entry point of *The Ballast*. League-wide rings of gunmetal-colored gases made slow pirouettes, above and below. 

""Let's go,"" said Bashera. Turner leaned on the thrust. *The Gold* dove forward, pushing through dense clouds of cosmic dust and electromagnetic static. 

""We're dark,"" said Graham. ""Everything except the hull cameras.""

""Then we'd better keep our eyes open,"" said Bashera. ""Are *Black* and *Tan* still with us?""

""They're back there,"" said Helsin. ""Keeping pace.""

""We're going straight and slow,"" said Bashera. ""I want an eye on every camera at all times. Graham, you have the helm.""

Bashera left the bridge. The attached hallway shook as she made her way across to the crew quarters. Once in her room she stripped and showered, pulling on a fresh tunic and adjusting the heavy plait of her damp, silver hair.

The air buzzed, hot and electric, as Bashera removed a small, leather book from the shelf behind her desk. The handwriting was her own - a diary she had kept in those sweet, bleary days, when Wendolyn was young and alive and Cornelius Renfield hadn't taken everything that mattered from so many people...including herself. 

She scanned the words and smelled the pages and remembered the little house on the river, where Wendolyn chased frogs and Thom and her had sat, side-by-side in the grass, watching fireflies chase each other into oblivion.

Lines formed in the air around her, like cracks in the nothingness. The buzzing was louder and louder. 

""Captain!"" Graham's voice cracked like the air. ""Captain! The radiation is really doing a number on us. Some major systems may become corrupted if we don't...""

The words were buried in the crackle and buzz. Bashera hugged the little leather book close to her chest.

""Keep going,"" she said into the air. ""Keep going.""

""But Captain, it's...zzzzzzNTNT...then we're go....ZZZZntZZntntn...""

""*Keep going!*"" shouted Bashera. Her room smelled like rain, just then. Rain and grass and the last breath of an extinguished fire. ""Don't stop until we get him. Don't stop until he's mine. Don't stop. Keep going...""

There were more sounds coming through the speaker, but nothing Bashera could understand. ",2016-06-09 03:22:53+00:00,d41urkj,1.0,t3_4n8cr7,9717.0,WritingPrompts

357,"I landed in a flash of piercing white light.

""Next!""

A soft, thin hand tugged gently at my wrist. ""C'mon,"" someone said. ""I want to dance some more.""

I blinked, digging my heels in. ""Where...?""

""Step to the side, kid.""

I held a hand over my eyes, peering through the glimmering curtain of light. A shadowy figure waved me on. The gentle hand was back on my wrist. I looked back. Dave DeMassio and Karla Booth were standing under the white archway, glaring at me. Dave was dressed in a loose, black tux; Karla, a tight turquoise dress and an aqua shawl. 

Prom. 1998. I made it back. I made it.

I looked down at my arm and saw that Julia was attached to my wrist, pulling ever so slightly, her face shining in the glare of the photographer's heavy lights.

""Dancing?"" she said. ""I know you don't...""

And then I remembered. Remembered why I was there.

""Where's Kim?""

""Kim?"" Julia's face fell sharply. ""Why?""

""Or Jon. Where's Jon?""

""Jon Gable or John Che-""

""Gable,"" I barked, craning my head to scan the room. It was the gymnasium. All Points High. I was surprised at how familiar it seemed after all these years.

Julia dropped my wrist. ""I'm not going to a party after. Remember? You agreed to go back to my place watch movies. My parents already said it's okay.""

""No, that's fine. I just need to talk to...Jon."" It felt weird saying my own name through another person's mouth. ""Jon or Kim. I just need to talk to them for a second.""

Julia pointed towards the DJ table. ""Maria probably knows.""

""Thanks."" I hung a moment, considering whether or not to kiss Julia Nguyen before parting. Alex probably would have kissed her just then. In parting. Alex and Julia would have been together two years by then. Of course they would have kissed. But I didn't, because I knew I wouldn't have been doing it to be Alex. I would have done it because I'd always had a little crush on Julia, even when I was with Kim. And that was a piece of the past I preferred to leave unedited.

Maria was dancing in front of the speakers, trying to catch the eye of the DJ. I remembered the DJ. He had graduated three years earlier. I remembered finding him very impressive when I was 17. Not so much on a second glance.

""Jon and Kim,"" I shouted, grabbing Maria by the shoulders to hold her in place. ""Where are they?""

""Left,"" she shouted. ""I think they went to the beach.""

I almost threw Maria to the floor. I was too late. All that time...hunting down Alex    Parsoff...befriending him...convincing him to post his prom photos online...

All that and I was still too late. 

I patted at my pockets. No keys. I remembered that Alex always used to drive an '87 Jetta. There's no way he would have taken it to the prom, though.

I walked towards the front doors. Maybe I would recognize a car. Maybe I could talk someone into letting me borrow it. Maybe I could catch up. Maybe I could stop them...maybe I could...

Outside the nurse's office, covering the wall, framed by a ring of blue and white paper - photos. Candids. Class of '98. 

I scanned the collage, which climbed nearly all the way to the ceiling. I pulled a folding chair out of the nurse's office and used it to examine the upper edges. 

Why was I so fucking shy? I wasn't in any of the pictures. Nowhere.

Jon Gable. The absentee student.

But there...there was Kim.

A group picture, in the theater. The night they'd opened *A Midsummer Night's Dream*. After the show. The cast and crew, sweaty, beaming, plastered in make-up.

I'd never tried to travel when I was already in the past. I had no idea if it would work. But I never questioned that I should try.

I looked at the picture again. *Lacy*. I could use Lacy. Kim and Lacy went way back. She would listen to Lacy.

I reached out to touch Lacy. I missed.

I landed in the midst of four competing flashes. I looked down and saw Lacy dressed as Puck crouched below me. Kim was down the line, dressed in Hermia's red gown.

I towered over the rest. 

The photos stopped. The line broke. Alyssa Byun, gorgeous in Titania's heavy green dress, turned into me, slipping a stealthful hand inside my robes and giving my balls a quick, and entirely unexpected, squeeze, before whispering, ""Good work, Obie,"" into my ear as she passed.

I saw myself standing off to the side of the stage, waiting for Kim. There wasn't time to think of a better strategy.

""Jon,"" I said, dropping down off the stage. I could see the horror and confusion in my eyes. I looked very small and pathetic just then. 

""Hey Toby,"" said the thing that was me so many years ago. ""Good job up there. You...uh...you project really well. Heard everything.""

""Are you going to take Kim to the prom?"" I blurted.

The eyes that were mine, but didn't exactly belong to me just then, went wide and white. ""Yeah. Why? Wh...where you gonna ask her? I thought you and Alyssa...""

""No, no. Just...""

""Autograph?"" I looked down. A little girl in a pink sweater was holding up the playbill and a Sharpie. ""You were really, really good!"" she said, smiling.

Absently, I reached down to grab the playbill. ""No, you should go with Kim. I just wanted to say...""

I was gone again.

I was sitting in the theater, in the front row. The flash came from behind. I looked back. Julia Nguyen was standing halfway back in the mostly empty theater, taking pictures as Lacy and Toby acted on stage.

I sat a moment, confused. Then Julia was standing at my side, whispering. ""I think I got some good pictures, Mr. Redding.""

*Mr. Redding*. The drama teacher. I remembered. The playbill. Mr. Redding must have been in the corner of the cover photo. 

*Fine*. It was fine. I just had to wait an hour. That would theoretically put me back in the last photo. I could finish my talk with...well, with myself.

""Can you help me get the box of wigs down from the storage closet?""

I hardly realized Julia was talking to me. ""Huh? Uh...sure.""

I followed Julia out of the room while rehearsal continued on the stage. We passed through a narrow hallway and came to the storage space.

""Box of wigs, you said?"" I glanced around at the massive stacks of crumpled cardboard boxes.

""Right. Wigs,"" breathed Julia as she grabbed the front of my tucked flannel shirt and pulled me into a hard kiss.

I let it happen. Only for a moment.

""What the hell?"" I cried, pulling myself free. 

""Shh,"" she hissed, grabbing at my belt.

I know myself. I would have let it go on. All the way to the end. But I remembered who I was just then. And I couldn't let *that* part of history go unedited.

""What about Alex?"" I blurted. 

Julia's face fell. Just like it had at the prom...30 minutes ago...a month and a half from now...

""You've never cared about that before.""

""This is wrong."" And I knew what I was doing was wrong, too. Meddling. I was only supposed to allow myself that one change, but I couldn't help it. ""You can't do this. And Mr. Reddi...*I'm* married. *We* can't do this. You see how this is wrong, right?""

She didn't say anything. She just walked away. I went back to the theater and watched the rehearsal and waited.

I was right. I went back. 

Back to the group photo after the show. It was the same. Same pose. Me as Toby as Oberon. Alyssa Byun grabbing my balls. I saw myself. We talked. I said my piece. 

A weight came off me. I knew it had worked. It must have. The 17 year old me was nothing if not easily intimidated. Kim and I were going to be safe. She was going to be okay. My legs...

An hour passed. The theater was nearly empty. I hadn't gone back yet. I picked up a playbill. The cover photo was different. I rifled through the pages.

*Director: Alice Timiov*

""What happened to Redding?"" I said it to myself, but a man standing nearby heard me.

""Fuck that pervert,"" he said, looking me dead in the eyes. ""Diddles a 17 year old girl? Fuck him. I'm glad they ran him off. Poor girl. Changing schools just to get away from this shit. Fuck that guy."" His wife eventually pulled the man away.

So Julia was gone. No Julia and Alex. No Julia and Alex at the prom. 

Someone grabbed my ass from behind. ""Ready to go?"" said Alyssa, dangling a set of car keys from her finger. 

I tried to remember whatever happened to Toby Beckett. But I couldn't remember.

I guess I'm about to find out.

358,"The day broke, gray and sterile. White winds howled across the surface of the black water, while grasping tendrils of chill mist encircled the silent lake house.

[*Editor's note: It was a bit overcast. Otherwise, it was a perfectly nice morning.*]

The man and the woman arrived. The guttural cries of their creaking automobile echoed across the surrounding forest like the wail of the dead.

[*Editor's note: It was Jim Farmer and his wife, Samantha. And they drive a Prius so  I doubt it was all that loud.*]

Inside the ancient house, a being stirred...

[*Editor's note: That's Corey, the house sitter.*]

Up above, in the chalk-dry eaves, black-winged bats hung in silent communion.

[*Editor's note: Bats actually help keep the mosquito population in check, you know. So let's not start badmouthing the bats.*]

The man and the woman entered the house. Inside, a voice like thunder and God's wrath bellowed in terrible protest...a warning all should heed.

[*Editor's note: Security system. Top of the line. It's supposed to be loud! And they HAD the code, alright?*]

Out on the landing, the man and the woman surveyed the bleak, glass face of the still, ponderous water. Below the black sheen, dead-eyed spirits floated slowly towards the surface...

[*Editor's note: Sturgeon. It was sturgeon. Probably some brook trout, too.*]

From the quiet shadows of the highest loft, the being began to descend...

[*Editor's note: Again, that's Corey.*]

The woman felt a chill - a deep chill, one that reached beyond flesh and bone, down to the dark material of the soul.

[*Editor's note: It can be chilly on the lake. That's why we always advise people to bring layers.*]

The man placed an arm around the woman, but the warmth had gone out of him, gone out of the world that morning...

[*Editor's note: Upper 50s! It gets up into the 70s by the afternoon. Just wear a sweater!*]

As they huddled in their mutual despair, the being, born of the shadows, passed through the glass partition, unseen and unheard... 

[*Editor's note: HIS. NAME. IS. COREY!*]

In his hand, a sharpened slip of ancient metal, jagged as dragon's fang, cold as the milky expanse of space...

[*Editor's note: KEY TO THE BOATHOUSE KEY TO THE BOATHOUSE OH SWEET JESUS IT'S JUST THE GODDAMN KEY TO THE BOATHOUSE.*]

The man and the woman felt his presence at last...too late...too slow...the bitter tang of his essence enveloping them, encircling their minds, peeling apart the silken layers of their spirit, strip by strip, until nothing was left, nothing remained but cold husks of bone and sorrow...

[*Editor's note: Fine! Fine. I'll talk to Corey about his cologne.*]

It's gross. 

[*Editor's note: I'll talk to him.*]

It's Axe body spray.

[*Editor's note: Okay.*]

He sprays it on like it's suntan lotion.

[*Editor's note: It's too much. Got it.*]

Like, he just goes crazy with it. 

[*Editor's note: Uh huh.*]

I'm not being sensitive or anything, it's really too much.

[*Editor's note: Yes, I get that.*]

Okay. But can you not tell Corey I'm the one who complained?

360,"I need you to upvote this. Okay? I'm not trying to be pathetic here. Normally I don't care about fake internet points. But this is important. This is life and death. You're going to have a hard time believing me, but this is what's happening...

It started ten days ago.

At that point I'd only been writing here a little while. I love writing, but it's hard sometimes to get yourself to do it. Too many other distractions. Too many things that are just easier to do. But I like Writing Prompts. It feels like a challenge. Plus, there's this little mental countdown clock that appears in my brain once I commit to a prompt. Like, I've got to finish quick before I'm buried by all the other great responses.

Anyway, I'd barely been at it when I saw a prompt: ""You get a call from a HR rep. Your ex, who recently dumped you, has listed you as a character reference.""

You may have seen the prompt, too. Anyway, that's something that actually happened to me, and not that long ago. In my case, my girlfriend had apparently been cheating on me for awhile and was just waiting for the right moment to split. But in the meantime, she hadn't bothered to update her resume and remove my contact info. 

It was her dream job, too, and I knew it. I gave her a great recommendation. I felt too cowardly to do anything else. She got the job.

But that was real life. When I saw the prompt I thought to myself, ""Here's what I SHOULD have done."" In the prompt response I also gush about my ex to the HR rep, but I illustrate her positive qualities with these comically horrible stories. Like, I show how brave she is by talking about the time she smuggled heroin across the US/Mexican border. Or, I talk about her determination and toughness and use the story of the first time we tried anal.

It was an okay story and it got a nice little collection of upvotes. 

That would have been the end of it, if I hadn't gone to Whole Foods the next day. Because there she was, working the register.

I asked what she was doing there. Was it a second job or something? No. It was her only job. I asked about the dream job. She said she'd had an interview, but then never heard back from them. 

I went home assuming I'd misremembered a lot of things. The break-up had been hard on me. That whole period was a blur.

That night I found another prompt: ""You find a strange briefcase outside your front door one morning...""

You see, that's happened, too. And in real life there was no story. I assumed it was a neighbor's and ignored it. When I came home that night it was gone.

But in my prompt response...well, my fiction was a hell of a lot more interesting than my reality. There was cash and a gun inside the briefcase. And a cell phone. And a lot of shit happened. I went way past the character limit on that one. Dead bodies. Sex. You name it. And it all ended in a suite at The Palms in Vegas.

But here's the thing - the next morning? I woke up and I was at The Palms. I was in the suite. There with the cash and two girls I thought could only ever exist in my mind. And the phone rang and when I picked up, a voice said, ""They're coming.""

I left the room. Took the cash. Left the gun (I've never shot a gun in my life). Valet service brought me my car and I drove. Drove out of Vegas. Into the desert. I thought it was all a dream. But it wasn't. It isn't. 

I was following the signs to Los Angeles because I didn't know what else to do. Halfway there I started to notice the smell. I pulled into the back of an Exxon and popped the trunk. Dead body. Just like in my story.

I stopped in Barstow and found the local library. Got online and found it. A prompt: ""You're driving through the desert with a dead body in the trunk and a pair of trained hitmen on your trail. They're closing in...""

I tried to write it away. The hitmen lost the scent. The body disappeared. I end up back home. It was all a dream.

But I guess it wasn't a good enough story. I got one or two upvotes. Apparently that's not enough.

Because they're still after me. 

I went west, towards Bakersfield. The body is ripe now, just boiling away in the trunk. I saw the men, the guys following me. In Mojave they almost got me.

I used some of the money to buy a kid's laptop. And here I am, trying again. This is my story:

It never happened. None of it ever happened. I was home this whole time. My ex got her job. I walked past the briefcase.

It never happened.

Please. I don't care if you like this story. I don't care if you ever vote for anything I ever do again. I can't imagine if I survive this I'll even have the stomach for fiction.

Just upvote. Just a few. Please.

362,"""And prostitution. Oh! So much prostitution.""

I close my laptop and push away from the hospital bed. ""Nan, I really, really don't think I...""

""Type it!"" She's briefly beset with wracking coughs, pointing aggressively at the laptop. ""I gave you my car, Wen. Least you can do is type a few words for your old, dear Nan.""

I take a sip of cold water and open the laptop once more. I'm already on page three. Paragraph after paragraph of crimes, petty and otherwise. I can't help thinking about those 19 years worth of birthday checks. Where the money had come from. What I had spent it on. I was already making plans to give my old dirtbike away to charity, like that would make anything better.

""It's boring. I understand. An old woman rambling. Not like your fighting pajama men and the ax fighters or whatever it is you kids like these days. Just old memories. But here...here's one you'll like. One you need to remember. So write this one down. 1963. Dallas...""

""Oh God almighty,"" I say, putting my head in my hands. ""Nan! Please tell me you didn't kill JFK?""

""Who?""

""Kennedy. John Kennedy. President of the United States.""

Nan shakes her head. ""What? I didn't kill John Kennedy. Why say these things? Is this what you think of your old Nan?""

""No. No. I just..."" I clear my throat. ""Sorry. Go on.""

""I lost my train of thought. Something about Dallas...No. It's gone. See? This is what happens. Don't interrupt your Nan! This is what we're doing, remember? You write it down because I hardly remember. Anyway...ah! This one. Write this one down. No interrupting. 

""1969! I remember it clear as day. Some fellas from Houston were putting together a production of sorts. Nice sound stage like you'd see in Hollywood. Cameras. Lots of rocks, for some reason. One fella had this silly suit on. Like divers used to wear. And he was jumping all around in the dirt. They brought me in for...""

""Is this...are you talking about the Moon landing? Are you saying you helped fake the Moon landing, Nan? Was the Moon landing faked?!""

""Moon? What about the Moon? What are you talking about?""

I grab the rails of the hospital bed. ""Did we fake the Moon landing? Nan? What happened in 1969?""

""Well."" Nan glances up at the television for a moment. ""I guess I don't remember.""

""What!? What were you saying?""

""You interrupted me,"" says Nan. ""I keep telling you, you shouldn't do that. It's very rude.""

""And now you don't...?""

Nan shakes her head. ""Gone. Hope you're happy.""

I take a deep breath and sit back in my chair. ""Alright. Okay. I'm sorry. I won't do that again. You've obviously lived a very interesting life, Nan. Very...very interesting. So, go on.""

""'Go on' he says. I keep trying, Mr. Yells at His Nan. But ah! This one."" She nods her head. ""THIS one. You write this one down. This is what they need to remember about me. This is the one I could never ever talk about until now. You're ready? No yelling?""

""I didn't really yell, Nan.""

She snaps her fingers together like a trap. ""I remember this one well. It wasn't so long ago. 2000, maybe? No. 2001. Ah. September? Yes, September. I remember. It was an Indian summer. September 2001. I was in New York at the time.""

I stop typing and start gripping the sides of my laptop. ""Uh huh,"" I manage to grunt.

""No one thought much of your old Nan back then. Didn't think I was worth much. Society does that, you know. Forgets about the elderly. Very shameful. But I met these men. Arab gentlemen. Very respectful.""

My shoulder starts to twitch. Nan glances my way. 

""You're writing this down, right?""

""Uh huh."" I fake typing for a moment.

""Nice Arabs. Very respectful. Anyway, they talk a lot of sense. Make a lot of good points. Talk a lot about what's missing in America. What needs to happen.""

My heart is pounding. I start looking at the door. I could go. I don't need this. I don't need the car. I can take the bus. This can't be part of my life. This can't be my family's legacy.

""They made me an offer. And I took it. I'm very proud of that. People my age hardly take risks like that. And I like to think that's what people ought to remember about me. That I was always willing to do what some people only talked about.""

I stand up slowly. ""Nan...what exactly did you do?""

""Well, you remember the World Trade Center? Two big buildings in New York?""

The world is red. I feel faint. ""Yeah?""

""I invested in a falafel restaurant across the street. Cleaned up in insurance. That's how I got into this nice nursing home. Never be afraid to take a chances, Wen. That's what I want people to remember.""

""Oh. Oh."" I close the laptop gently. ""I have to go to work, Nan. I...we can finish this later."" I take a few unsteady steps toward the door. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with my imagination? My Nan does a few shady things in her life and here I am assuming she's some mass murderer. I need some fresh air. 

""Wait!"" says Nan. Her eyes are closed. ""Kennedy. Was he the big Texan? Wife named Ladybird?""

""Um. No. That was Lyndon Johnson. Came after Kennedy.""

""Oh!"" Nan smiles and nods. ""The pretty boy was Massachusetts? With the haughty wife? That was Kennedy?""

""I guess, yeah.""

Nan lays back, still smiling. ""Yes. I remember. I shot that one. Had them mixed up. The pretty boy. Shot him right in the head.""

Slowly, silently I close the door and exit the nursing home. I leave my car in the parking lot.

363,"I remember the bodies. I'll always remember the bodies. Until the day I die. The way they were propped up in those chairs. The drained, white flesh. The cereal bowls filled with blood and...more.

Silly kids. Silly, stupid kids.

There were three of them this time. Asian girl. Black girl. Irish-looking ginger kid. He always did like celebrating diversity. 

They all came from a halfway house in midtown. Junkie moms. MIA dads. Those are the easiest marks. And he's never been one to strain himself. 

Poor kids love tricks. They love the illusion. There was hardly any sport in it at all. But then, he'd never been one for sport. This was never a game to him. Just revenge. Anger. Madness.

Bloody insanity.

I visited the little mick first. He was always fluttering around, stirring up shit. He liked to play with kids, too. Just not the same way. It WAS a game for him. A chase. He never got caught. In his own way, he was just as deranged. He just had a little less blood on his hands.

""Aye?"" he said, sliding the door to the end of the chain. ""And what'll ya be wantin' laddie?""

""He's back, Lucky,"" I say. ""Tearing up kids again.""

The leprechaun scowled. ""Aye? And what's that ta me?""

""Come on now, Luck. You know what he does isn't good for you. He keeps this up, they're gonna start locking kids up at night. Walking them to school. Nothing for you to play with.""

""I'm not like that, alright? And there's nuthin' I know. He and I...we were never friends. I don't keep up wit' 'im. He...well, he always did scare me.""

I tapped on the doorframe. ""Not as dumb as you look. Give me a name then. Someone who might know something.""

""And what makes ye think I know any...""

""You know, I'm not above pretending I smell weed and kicking your door in right this minute. And I have a hunch you don't want me on the other side of that door.""

Lucky shook his head. ""Talk to the frog. They go way back.""

""And where's the frog?""

""Try the gutter."" The door slammed shut.

The frog wasn't in the gutter, but he wasn't doing much better. I found him pitching a fit at the clinic.

""It's my goddamn turn!"" he screamed, flipping over a wooden chair and kicking the reception desk.""My turn! I can't wait anymore! My turn!""

I grabbed him by the back of his thick neck and slammed him to the floor. 

""Dig, is that your inside voice?""

The frog thrashed. ""It's been so long. I'm tryin'. I'm tryin'. But how am I supposed to be good if they don't give me my medicine?""

I pulled Dig up to his feet. ""Walk with me. I can help you out.""

""You can't,"" said Dig'em, crying softly. ""You can't."" All the same, he let himself be led out of the room.

""I need the rabbit,"" I said once we'd exited out to the locking dock. ""He's at it again.""

""Don't know,"" said Dig through his tears. ""Why would I...""

I pulled a small box out of my coat. It was old. They didn't make his stuff anymore. I'd had to pull a few strings.

Dig's eyes lit up. ""Is that?""

I nodded, slipping the box back into my coat. ""The real stuff. Pure Smacks. What you've been dreamin' about all these years. And it's yours. If you get me the rabbit.""

Dig blinked. ""I...I probably shouldn't.""

I shrugged. ""Eh. Fine. I'll eat 'em myself. Bet they still taste great.""

""No! NO!"" Dig grabbed my coat. I shoved him aside easily. ""I'll help. You just...you have to make sure you get him. If you don't...and he finds out...""

""Give me something good, then.""

He gave me something great. Turns out, the rabbit had been living in the toucan's basement. I always knew that bird was a piece of shit.

I'm not an idiot, so I called in a SWAT unit. They smashed the place to hell. Even found pieces of the Life cereal kid down in the basement. But no rabbit.

They did find something else, though. May have been something, may have been nothing. But there it was, in a safe behind the TV - a blue captain's hat.

""What does it mean?"" asked the officer who brought me the hat.

""Means it's never over,"" I replied. ""And I have a feeling it's only going to get worse.""",2016-05-29 23:08:49+00:00,d3oj6n3,1.0,t3_4lmgw6,4152.0,WritingPrompts

368,"Meiko didn't drink. She was just obsessed with those bar top video games - the matching game ones with half-naked ladies behind the cards. She couldn't even begin to understand why. She didn't even really like girls. Didn't generally want to see titties or anything. There was just something about THOSE particular titties. Like hiding behind cartoon playing cards made them a treasure beyond compare.

Anyway, that was her thing. And the machine at Echo's was broken, so she tried the bar next door and they didn't have one. She kept walking down Smith Street, stopping at bar after bar. It occurred to her that maybe this was an unhealthy thing to be doing, but really, it was fine, she was going to deal with it after a few hands of video titty cards.

Where Smith crossed Main the fun basically stopped. There was nothing beyond but empty office buildings and the sorts of apartments that always appear at the end of the fun blocks. There was one more bar, however, right there on the corner. Meiko hadn't seen it before, but then again, the titty machine at Echo's had never been broken before.

The crooked door opened to a set of crooked stairs that dropped aggressively downward, in uncommonly deep steps. Meiko felt like a child, holding the handrail as she slid from step to step.

The interior of the bar was cold, but clean. Polished wooden floors led to through a nearly-empty sitting room to a long, wide bar that arced almost out of sight.

No video game machine, thought Meiko. Now she was annoyed.

""Hey!"" she yelled, stomping towards the bar. The bartender was a golden wisp of a man, bespectacled and starched.

""Yes ma'am,"" he smiled. ""How can I help you?""

""How come you don't have any pervert games?"" said Meiko. ""What good is a bar without pervert games?""

The smile never faltered. ""You've got me there. What kind of a bar indeed?"" He motioned toward the nearest stool. ""Seems I've wronged you, my dear. How about something on the house?"" 

""I don't really drink,"" said Meiko. ""That's not what I do at bars.""

The bartender leaned across the bar. ""You know, I'm not sure drinking's what bars are really for, anyway. I mean, alcohol's a vehicle - not a destination. Right?""

Meiko's eyebrows went up and slightly to the left. That was all she could think to say.

The bartender ran a finger over an assortment of glass bottles. ""More about a feeling, right? People use alcohol to help get them somewhere - emotionally. Sad people want to be less sad. Happy people want to be happier. That's...there's a bit more nuance to it, obviously, but that's what it is. And I say - skip the middleman.""

""Aren't you the middleman?"" said Meiko.

""The figurative middleman. Not the actual middleman."" The bartender shook his head. ""Never mind that. Just tell me - how would you like to feel?""

""I'd like to feel like I'm playing titty cards,"" said Meiko. ""But you don't have that. So I guess I'd like to feel like I'm home eating microwave ramen and watching pirated Game of Thrones.""

The bartender tapped on the bar top. ""Those aren't feelings. Those are things you do in order to FEEL a certain way. How do they make you feel?""

Meiko considered this. ""Full.""

The bartender sighed. ""Not...""

""Like, FULL,"" said Meiko. ""All over. Not empty. Like, like it usually feels like everything is leaking out. Just everything. All the time. And it makes me so tired and empty. And titty cards just...I guess it distracts me. Is that a feeling? I feel distracted. And when I feel distracted I don't feel like garbage.""

""Ah."" The bartender reached below the bar and poured a shot. He held it out to Meiko. It was clear and odorless.

""I don't drink.""

""It's not alcohol.""

""That's what date rapists say,"" said Meiko. But still, she took the shot glass and downed the contents. ""Not alcohol."" Meiko smacked her lips. ""What do roofies taste like?""

""It's not a roofie. It's interest.""

""Interest? Interest in what?""

The bartender raised his arms. ""Life.""

Meiko gently set the shot glass down. ""O...kay.""

""Want another?""

""Interest? No...suppose I'm good there.""

The bartender poured another shot. ""This is a good one.""

Meiko was slightly surprised to find herself draining the shot without any hesitation. ""Yeah? What was it?""

""Pride.""

""I already had pride, dickface."" But Meiko laughed as she said this, sliding the glass across the counter. ""One more. Then I need to go.""

""Which one do you want?""

Meiko thought. She wasn't sure why she was playing along, but there was a lightness there she couldn't remember feeling. She wanted to run. She wanted to write. She wanted to call her mother and say things she only just then remembered she felt. It was a heat. Deep. Radiant. Pulsing from the core of her being. It was electric. 

She didn't know why she was playing along, but she never wanted to stop.

""Do you have shame?"" she asked.

""Yeah?"" said the bartender. ""That's what you want?""

""If you have it,"" said Meiko.

""Of course we do,"" said the bartender. ""Some people, it's all they ever drink."" He poured the shot. 

Meiko took the glass. ""I only need the one. To remember."" She drank.

""We all need to remember sometimes,"" said the bartender. ""Come back anytime.""

Meiko nodded, slipping off the stool. ""Maybe."" Then she left, walking back up Smith Street. The bars sang a song as she passed. A traveling song. A wish for safe passage to wherever the night may take you. ",2016-05-29 04:23:53+00:00,d3npx05,1.0,t3_4lia5a,14575.0,WritingPrompts
369,"Cement walls. No windows. A single dim bulb swings a slow circle at the center of the ceiling. Shadows rise and fall like waves.

Maggie sits in a metal folding chair below the lightbulb. No table. Her fingers bite into the skin of her thighs as she tugs nervously on her blue jeans.

Finally someone comes in. Two people. A man and a woman. The man has thick, black-framed glasses. The woman is wearing a heavy, gray suit. Her skirt stops midway down her shins.

The man talks first. ""No one's mad at you. Alright? At least no one important.""

Maggie doesn't know how to take this. Plenty of people are mad at her.

""It's not your fault,"" says the woman. ""You know that, right? You didn't choose for this to happen.""

""I didn't DO anything!"" Maggie blurts out. ""I was just doing my job! I don't even...What did I do?""

""A lot of people got sick,"" says the man. ""People were scared. Your boss was scared. Probably said some things he shouldn't have.""

""But I didn't...""

""Yes, you did,"" says the woman. ""You didn't mean to, but you did.""

""But I never touched the meat,"" says Maggie. ""I just scanned the boxes. That's all. I just scanned them before the trucks went out. How could I...""

The man clears his throat. ""This is going to be hard to hear, Margaret, but you...you're different.""

""Different?""

""Growing up,"" says the woman, ""did your family eat much meat?""

Maggie frowns. ""We...we were all allergic. Meat made us sick. We were vegetarians.""

""Allergic to meat?"" says the man. ""All meat?""

Maggie nods. She wonders why that sounds so odd coming from the man when it had never seemed all that odd before.

""You weren't allergic,"" says the woman. ""You have a...a very particular power.""

""A...power?""

""How long had you been working in the Chipotle warehouse?"" asks the man.

""Only a few days.""

The woman nods. ""Margaret, you have the ability to spoil meat without even touching it.""

Maggie's mouth hangs open. ""I...what?""

""E. Coli. Salmonella. Rotavirus. Your mere presence causes massive bacterial contamination of nearby meats.""

""There's no other way to put it,"" says the man. ""You are a walking, talking, breathing food poisoning machine. And we want you to come work for us.""

Maggie shakes her head. ""That doesn't make any sense."" The room seems to be spinning. The lightbulb moves faster and faster.

""Of course we'll never ask you poison regular civilians,"" says the woman. ""Visiting foreign dignitaries, perhaps. Professional athletes. Cultists. Your powers will be used to restore balance to the world.""

""By...by making people sick?""

""Very sick,"" says the man, nodding. He holds out a hand. ""So. What do you say?"" ",2016-05-28 15:04:55+00:00,d3mzwjg,1.0,t3_4lf5x3,20785.0,WritingPrompts
