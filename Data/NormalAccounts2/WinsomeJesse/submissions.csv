The bookcase sagged away from the wall at an 80 degree angle. All seven *Harry Potter* hardcovers slid off the top shelf and fluttered to the floor like dead birds.

Danny frowned. ""It's alright, dear,"" whirred Mother-Bot, wheeling forward on her narrow, matching treads to gather the fallen books in her nimble pincers. ""You did your best.""

""Sorry,"" mumbled Danny, red-faced. He'd worked on that bookcase for four hours. Followed every instruction. The pieces were *literally* numbered.

""Sorry for what, dear?"" sighed Mother-Bot, her digital singsong patterned to rise and fall in empathetic inflections. 

""Sorry for being human,"" pouted Danny, slumping at the shoulders and spinning away from the wreck of his efforts.

""No, no!"" said Mother-Bot, wheeling about, grabbing Danny gently under the arms and lifting him swiftly, effortlessly into the air. ""You are a precious miracle, little Danny. Never apologize for what you are."" Her servos clattered softly as she drew the boy into her felt and foam padded breast. 

""I'm *so slow*,"" he moaned, pushing away from the embrace. ""And weak. And *stupid*. I can't build anything right. I can't play whizzball with the other bots because they're all afraid I'll get hurt. I'm just... I don't belong.""

""You don't belong?"" sang Mother-Bot, kind and incredulous. ""This whole *world* is yours, wonderful Danny! A whole land, just for you. Your ancestors built this world and everything in it for you. So there would always be a place for you, even after the Ravages took them all. So even if you were the absolute last of your kind, you would have friends and family and a community. And yes, Danny, while we were making the world ready for you - clean for you - we lived our own lives in a way. Made our games. Our own communities. But then the world was ready for you and you are here and *we are so happy to have you*.""

The red and black digital display of Mother-Bot's face curved into an enormous, earnest smile. 

""I feel like a burden,"" sniffed Danny. ""Like everyone has to slow down for me.""

""We *do* slow down for you,"" said Mother-Bot. ""But that is not a burden. That is a privilege. It is our joy and pleasure. So do not feel alone, dear Danny. You are surrounded by those who love you; those who will protect you. And we will never think less of you for your humanity. Because that is your gift to us.""

Danny didn't cry, because he didn't want to. But still he dove forward into Mother-Bot's soft chest and felt the warm oscillation at her center and smiled and was happy.",winsomeman,A Boy's Purpose (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/5btpi1/a_boys_purpose_wp/

The little girl with the pink gown and the round, jaundiced skull, looked up from her mother's iPad. ""Oh. *You*,"" she said, before dropping her eyes back down to the screen.

""Well,"" I said, taking a seat on the opposite side of the rails. ""A bit rude, don't you think?""

""Why shouldn't I be rude to *you*? You're Death, after all.""

I drew back, wounded. ""How dare you?""

She looked up again, mildly interested. ""Aren't you?""

""Not in the least. *Death*? Blech. No, I'm someone else entirely.""

She set down the device. ""Well then, who are you?""

I placed a insubstantial finger against my temple. ""The End.""

She rolled her eyes and grabbed up the iPad. ""Ah. So Death with a dumb name.""

Agitated, I sprang to my feet. ""No! Not Death! That's a totally different thing. Death's a jumped-up chauffeur, ferrying *souls* from one realm to another. He's the Uber driver of the damned, as far as I'm concerned. I am The End. Much different. Even deathless gods hold me in high regard. I'm kind of a big deal.""

""I'm really not getting the concept,"" said the little girl, not looking up.

""The *End*! It's not... it's not that complicated, really. All things end. People. Plants. Animals. Cities. Stories. Relationships. Head colds. *Ideas*. All of it *ends*. And I'm the one that ends them. So... you see? Really not that complex.""

""When are you planning on ending this conversation?"" said the little girl.

I gritted my insubstantial teeth. ""I'd like to end that attitude of yours...""

""Please do,"" said the girl. The flash of the screen reflected off her round, glistening eyes. ""I'm ready whenever you are.""

""Well..."" I cleared my throat. ""As it turns, I am here to end your suffering.""

She shook her head. Now when she refused to look up it seemed less a form of rebellion and more a means by which to keep her emotions under wraps. ""Great. Sounds great. Like I said... I'm ready. But if all you were ever gonna do was kill me, I really wish you would've skipped all the talking before.""

""Oh. Oh no."" I straightened up. ""I'm ending your suffering. Not your life. That's all.""

She looked up, upset and hopeful and scared. ""You...?""

""Well, that's not *all*."" Her face wavered. ""I'm also ending your nihilism, just as a matter of course.""

""I'm eight,"" she said. ""I don't know what that means.""

""Doesn't matter,"" I shrugged. ""Our business is at an end.""

She chuckled sarcastically. ""Good one.""

""That wasn't...oh. Yes.""

Her face was suddenly more red than yellow. She was clutching the iPad so firmly I was worried she may break it. ""Are you saying I'm cured.""

""Oh,"" I said. ""That was the third thing, wasn't it? Your suffering, your belief that life is meaningless, and your cancer. Almost forgot. Those are all ended."" I waved my hands in the air dramatically. ""Tah-dah. *The End*, see?""

She nodded. ""Yeah. I see."" She wiped her eyes with the bed sheets. ""When...when will I see you again?""

I shook my head. ""Again, not Death. I'm not on a schedule. We will meet again, many, many times. Just as we've met before. You just don't remember.""

""Will I remember this time?""

""Probably not, no. But! I do believe you'll remember this at least - you'll remember not to be afraid of me.""

She nodded. ""Yes. I'm sure I'll remember that.""

I moved to the door. ""Places to be,"" I sighed. ""I'm afraid this meeting...""

""Is over,"" said the girl with a smile.

""*Is at an end*,"" I replied with a mock frown. ""Sheesh. Some people."" But my frown slipped into a smile just as I slipped into the air.

_____________________________________________

Clay bought a jug of water and a big bottle of migraine pills. The girl behind the counter had gone to the same school as Clay, but she was maybe three years older and clearly had no idea who he was. That was probably for the best.

Tania stepped to the back of the line as Clay was walking away. She had a bag of Doritos, an iced tea, and a gallon of Draino.

""What the hell...?"" 

Tania shrugged. ""You said those shots were poison, right? Kept us feeling normal by giving our bodies something to *do* with all that energy. Well..."" 

""You're going to drink Draino?"" hissed Clay.

""Worth a shot, right?""

Clay waited outside until Tania had paid for her stuff. Together the pair walked south, sticking to smaller side streets.

""So what's the plan?"" said Tania, popping the lid off the Draino and taking a sniff. ""Storm your parents' house? Rip out the phone lines this time?""

""I can't believe you're going to drink that.""

""Christ,"" said Tania, rolling her eyes as she took a swig. ""Blech! Oh. Jesus.""

""Feel better?"" smiled Clay.

""Stop...*cough cough*...changing the subject.""

Clay nodded. ""I think we have to assume the house is being watched. And maybe where they work. So I have another idea.""

""Great non-answer,"" said Tania, wedging the capped Draino under her arm while she took a long chug of iced tea. 

""You'll see,"" said Clay. ""We're almost there.""

*There* was a slanted gray building behind a gas station that happened to be Clay's favorite pizza place - Antonio's. 

""So the plan is pizza?"" said Tania. ""I'm not saying it's a *bad* plan, I'm just not sure I'm getting it, is all.""

""Memorize this number,"" said Clay. ""230-4004. That's my house number. I'm gonna distract the person at the counter. You call from the phone here and tell whoever answers that they were randomly selected for a free pizza, but they have to come within the hour.""

""And if they don't want pizza?""

Clay blinked. ""It's pizza. And it's free. My parents may be part of a sinister plot involving gene manipulation, but they're not *monsters*.""

Tania nodded. ""No offense intended. Let's give it a shot. But if it all goes to shit in there, I'm gonna go ahead and steal some pizza for the road.""

""That's fair,"" said Clay.

Half of the plot didn't end up mattering, because Clay's friend Stevie Riddle was working the cash register.

""Clay?"" he said, as the pair walked through the door. Clay's eyes went wide.

""Stevie?""

Stevie was round-shouldered and long-faced, with an uncomfortable length of greasy black hair that he wadded up into a bun at the back of his head. He sprinted out from behind the cash register and wrapped Clay up in a swift, though somewhat lingering, bearhug.

""When'd you get back?"" said Stevie. ""With the mission work, I just assumed you'd be gone 'til Christmas at least.""

""Mission work?"" said Clay.

""Is that not what they call it?"" Said Stevie. ""It's what your mom told me. Dominican Republic, right?""

Clay cleared his throat. ""Yes. That's right. Back from my...mission.""

Stevie's eyes swung to Tania. ""Did you...you bring a girl back with you? Oh my god, did you get *married*??""

""Is he serious?"" said Tania. ""Is that a serious question? I'm from Albany, motherfucker.""

""She's a friend!"" yelped Clay, diving in between the two. ""This is Tania. She's a friend. Very...good friend. Listen, Stevie, can we use the phone real quick?""

""Yeah, I guess,"" said Stevie, frowning. Clay pointed Tania to the phone and led Stevie to the opposite corner of the room. ""So...uh... have I missed much?""

""Tammy Spitzer's preggo,"" said Stevie. ""And Mr. Farnsworth had a mental breakdown. Something about his wife leaving him. I dunno. How was the D.R.?""

""D.R.?""

""*Dominican Republic*. Sheesh man, you sure you didn't catch like, malaria or something? No offense, you look - and smell - like hell. You take a bus home?""

Clay forced a laugh. ""It's... you know... dirty. Kinda. But yeah, I need a shower, for sure."" Tania set down the receiver and gave him a thumbs up. ""Alright, we'll let you get back to work.""

""He seems like an idiot,"" said Tania, as the two loitered outside the pizza parlor. 

""He's fine,"" said Clay. ""Nice guy. Just...not all that worldly.""

""Right,"" said Tania. ""Well, they're coming. It's good to know their appetite for free pizza hasn't been affected by all the kidnappings and daughter shootings and whatnot.""

""They're a frugal people,"" said Clay.

""So what tells you your mom or dad are even gonna tell you the truth about anything? No one else in this thing seems all that big on the truth.""

""I don't know,"" said Clay, pulling nervously at his filthy shirt. ""I wasn't sure where else to go. If they won't tell us anything, I don't know who will.""

""Well, I'm in favor of punching the truth out of people, so let's not leave that off the table.""

Clay laughed, but not really. Fifteen minutes later a familiar Blue Toyota turned onto the street. Clay and Tania hid out of sight until the car stopped and the door opened. A weary-looking blond woman in a gray hoodie stepped out and made for the front door. 

""Hey,"" said Clay, stepping out from behind the building, while Tania curled around to the side of the Toyota.

Cynthia Haberlin's eyes went wide. She staggered momentarily. ""Clay?""

""Let's get in the car,"" said Tania, pulling open the driver's side door.

""Wha...where have you been?"" said Cynthia, as Clay pulled her gently to the backdoor of the car.

""Just sit down. We need to talk. Keys?""

Absently, Cythnia reached into the pocket of her hoodie and handled Clay the keys. He turned them over to Tania. 

""Drive carefully,"" he said. 

""What's that supposed to mean?"" said Tania. But she wasn't interested in an answer. Instead, she revved up the car and pulled out onto the street, as Clay and his mother settled into the backseat.

""Where have you been, Clay? We've been so...""

""I don't think we have time for all of that,"" said Clay, more coldly than he'd meant. ""You need to tell me where I came from. Everything you know. Now.""

Cynthia paused a moment, as if considering. Then she nodded. ""Yes. Okay. Where should I begin?""

""The beginning works,"" said Tania from the driver's seat.

Cynthia took a long, slow breath. ""Clay...you're adopted.""

""No shit,"" said Tania.

""Hey!"" said Clay, leaning through the seats. ""Just drive, okay? I've got this.""

Cynthia went on without prompting. ""After Callie I was told I couldn't have any more kids. *But*, we'd always wanted two kids at least, so...we began to look into adoption.""

Her eyes slipped to the window of the moving car. ""The adoption agency said we were a match for a special program. Special needs babies. Required very responsible, very stable parents. But if we said yes, it would cut through a lot of the usual red tape. And so...we said yes.""

""What did they tell you about the special program?"" said Clay.

Cynthia shook her head. ""Not much. They said you had early onset diabetes. But they said that was okay, because they would provide the doctors and all the medication necessary. We just had to use the meds they sent in the mail and only go to the doctors and dentists that they picked. So we did. That's all. Everything else was normal. Everything else was fine. You were just our son. As far as we're concerned, you still are.""

""They didn't tell you anything about where I came from? What else might be *wrong* with me?""

""No. It was confidential. We were just... we were just happy to have you. It didn't seem like such a burden to do those things. And it never hurt you. I mean, christ, it's not like you were ever sick or anything.""

""Right,"" said Clay quietly. The car pulled into a wide parking lot, circling slowly around the perimeter. ""What did they tell you - after I was gone?""

""We called the police,"" said Cynthia, looking down. ""We were always told to call *them* if anything was ever wrong with you, but that didn't really occur to us at the time. We just couldn't find you and then your father... found a bullet shell on the ground in the living room and we panicked. I called the police. That's when we found out they've been listening to our calls - I guess the whole time.""

""For real?"" said Tania, slowing the car but not stopping. 

Cynthia nodded. ""The police didn't come. *They* came instead. They said that they would find you and they warned us not to disobey them. They said that your life depended on it. But we never explained it to Callie. So that's why... she...""

""Oh god!"" said Clay. ""Is Callie okay? I keep... I've been so caught up, I forgot about...""

Cynthia put a hand on Clay's knee. ""She's fine. Your sister's fine. The people who came to... to get you - they helped her. Took care of the bullet wound. No permanent damage. She's fine. She's worried about you. We've all been worried. Clay...""

The tears came, slow and heavy. ""I don't know what we've done,"" she said at last. ""I don't understand any of this, but I'm so sorry. I don't know what those people did to you. What *any* of these people have done to you. And... I don't know how to help you right now.""

""This is fine,"" said Clay with a broken smile. ""This is what I wanted. I just need to find these people. I need more answers.""

Cynthia swallowed. ""Do you want to come home? We can call them. I'm sure they'll come.""

""Pass,"" said Tania. 

Clay shook his head. ""I think we need to go to them. Do you know where they are?""

""I think I do,"" said Cynthia, leaning into the front, past the passenger's seat to the glovebox. She pulled out a wad of papers and sorted through until she found what she wanted. ""Here,"" she said, handing Clay a crumpled slip of paper. ""Return address for your...shots. I think that's their headquarters.""

""Boston,"" said Clay. ""Okay. Good. This is good.""

""What are you going to do?"" asked Cynthia suddenly.

""Not sure,"" said Clay honestly. ""I think there's answers there. But I don't think anyone's gonna give us anything freely. We'll have to find a way to take it.""

""Take my car,"" said Cynthia, wiping her sleeve across her eyes. ""Just promise you'll go the speed limit.""

""Really?"" said Clay.

""Yeah."" She shrugged, almost violently. ""I really don't know what else to do for you. I've never felt like such a huge, worthless failure before. And I'm so, so sorry."" She was bawling by the end of it and Clay didn't hesitate to lean across the seat and wrap his arms around her.

""It's okay, Mom. You didn't do anything wrong.""

They dropped her off two blocks from home. She kissed Clay on the cheek, lingering in the open door. ""Be safe. And please come home soon,"" she said.

""I'll try,"" said Clay. He wanted to say something more. Something about being a son and how lucky he felt, despite all the fresh strangeness of his life, but just then he saw a familiar car turn onto the street a block away - a rattling, black Dodge Charger. ""Bye,"" he breathed, diving into the passenger's seat and slamming the door closed. ""Go!""
    
Tania didn't need any more prompting. She saw the black car accelerating towards them. ""Oh, you wanna race?""

""It's a goddamn Corolla - *move*!""

The Toyota peeled out onto the street. The Black Charger roared in pursuit. 

The chase was on again.

____________________________________________

Gordon pulled the note off the door, crumpled it up, and tossed it into the bushes. He knew what it said and who it was from. Missy Joyner - complaining about the raccoons again. 

Too bad. It was his house and his life and his goddamn cat food. Besides, raccoons were just part of the cost of living in the suburbs...or the city...or the country. Well, they were just part of the cost of living, that's all. No use crying about it. 

He'd started feeding the raccoons after Georgia had died. Georgia was his cat. His wife Ally had been dead for ten years, but that was no great loss. Georgia, though, was about as good a kitty as you could ask for. Calm and simple, she hardly ever asked for anything. Never complained. Not even as that tumor had started growing up along the inside of her throat. It got so bad she could hardly swallow. The weight loss was the only sign Gordon ever picked up on and by then it was much, much too late.

So Georgia was gone and Gordon had a big old bag of cat food left in the pantry. He considered getting a new cat, but he was old and indifferent to the people, places, and things he wasn't already fond of or used to. New things were a hassle. Gordon was too old for hassles. But there were strays in the neighborhood and that seemed like the kind of relationship Gordon could stand - distant benefactor. Stray cat philanthropist. So he took a scoop of food and left it on his back steps one night. Somewhere in the middle of the night he heard scratching and munching and the clitter-clap of little, long nails on half-rotten wood. He peeked out the window to see who his customer was. 

It was a trio of raccoons. 

Gordon was honestly disgusted. Raccoons have those nimble little paws - disturbingly dexterous. Too human-like. And those black eyes see entirely too much. Wild and clever and vicious. 

But the raccoons seemed pleased with the offering. They cleared the lot, licked their hands and faces, and disappeared back into the dark.

And Gordon...Gordon still had plenty of cat food left.

The trouble - if you were the sort who cared about these things - was that Missy Joyner saw Gordon dumping the cat food out on his back steps one night. She lived on the opposite side of the fence and happened to be a snoop. Suddenly she had someone to blame every time raccoons or other woodland creatures made a move on her trash bins. 

""I'll call animal control, I will!"" she'd once barked across the fence.

""Call 'um!"" Gordon had croaked back. ""They ain't my pets.""

And they weren't. Raccoons are subservient to no one and Gordon certainly didn't expect any sort of thank you. He just liked to watch them eat. He'd gotten past that initial revulsion and turned around to finding them a fascinating species. Survivors. Just like Gordon. They didn't care what anyone thought of them. Just like Gordon. 

*Peas in a pod*, Gordon mused one day, as he watched a half dozen scuffle and wrestle over that night's pile of dry kibble. 

And so Missy Joyner's notes all went in the same place - the trash, or the street, or the bushes, or once - when Gordon had been particularly peeved - straight up the old man's own asshole. He'd regretted it later, upon extraction, but it had been a singularly triumphant moment, which he swore to cherish until the day he died.

The note so deposed of, Gordon unlocked the door and stepped inside his home.

He was not alone.

Two men stood inside the house, one holding Gordon's television with an almost sheepish look on his face; the other standing just outside the bathroom, tugging something out of his pocket.

""What the hell is this?"" cried Gordon, too stupid with anger to think to turn and run. The man with the TV stammered something incoherent, while the other produced a gun and defiantly waved it in Gordon's face.

""Close the door, old man,"" said the one with the gun. ""Or I swear I'll blast you in the face.""

Gordon sighed, his anger still simmering, but his age catching up to him. ""Whatever. Take what you want. It's all crap anyway.""

""We will,"" said the man with the gun. ""But first...""

They locked the door and tied Gordon to a chair. The sheepish man suggested that they run, but the man with the gun just laughed. 

""He's seen our faces,"" he said with a grin. ""He's gotta die. You know that, right?""

The sheepish man shook his head. ""I don't think he'll...""

""He won't,"" agreed the other. ""He'll be dead. But first, I wanna try a few things.""

He set the gun on the kitchen table and pulled a chunky switchblade out of his waistband. ""You ever peel an apple in one, single drag?"" he asked his partner.

The sheepish man turned pale. ""I didn't... look, I just wanted some easy cash. I didn't...""

""We'll still take all the good stuff,"" said the man with the switchblade. ""I just wanna see how much of his face I can peel off in a single strip.""

Gordon was scared - he was old, not stupid - but resigned to death. Even resigned to torture. He promised himself he wouldn't scream. That's what the sicko with the knife wanted. So that's the one thing Gordon wouldn't give him.

Gordon was repeating that silent mantra - *Don't scream. Don't scream* - when he spotted a pair of shining, black eyes at the back window. 

""It's dinnertime, isn't it?"" he said absently. 

""No dinner for you, old man,"" said the man with the switchblade. ""No dinner ever again.""

""It's not my dinnertime,"" said Gordon, watching, fascinated as the knob on the backdoor began to twist. They couldn't get in, of course. The door was locked. But how strange that they would try. ""Must be hungry,"" he muttered.

""Me?"" said the man with the switchblade, leaning down over Gordon's face. ""I'm not a cannibal. I'm not going to *eat* you. I'm just curious, that's all.""

Gordon shifted his head to see past the man. ""Christ. Did they find the spare key under the mat? Well, I'll be...""

""We broke in through the bedroom window,"" said the sheepish man. ""We thought you worked Thursday nights. That's why...we...you know.""

Gordon smiled. ""The whole family's here.""

""He's freaking me out,"" said the sheepish man. 

""He's just fuckin' with us,"" said the switchblade man. ""Ignore him.""

""Use the gun,"" said Gordon, squirming in his seat and pointing with his chin. ""Point and pull the trigger.""

""*Knife*,"" said the switchblade man, pushing the edge up against Gordon's throat. ""You don't get the gun until I'm done havin' fun. Oooh. That rhymed."" He turned to face the sheepish man. ""Did you hear th...""

*BANG.*

The right side of the switchblade man's face detached itself in the blink of an eye, splattering against the wall and the door and quite a good deal of Gordon. The remainder of the switchblade man stumbled, buckled at the knees, and collapsed to the floor. 

The sheepish man screamed. 

""They need to kill you, too?"" asked Gordon, nodding at the space just behind the frightened thief. The sheepish man turned slowly. A trio of raccoons were standing on the kitchen table, holding the handgun, which smoked faintly as the muzzle drifted towards the sheepish man. 

""Oh *fuck*!"" shouted the sheepish man. 

""Untie me,"" said Gordon. The sheepish man did as he was told. Gordon rubbed his arms and back. ""Take the body with you. And don't come back.""

The sheepish man nodded, bending to scoop up the dead body off the floor. Bowed under the weight, he stumbled out of the house through the backdoor and disappeared forever.

Gordon turned to the kitchen table, where the raccoons had dropped the gun and were looking around rather expectantly. 

""Well, I think you've earned a bit of a feast tonight, my friends,"" said Gordon with a smile. ""Let's go see what we have in the pantry.""     ",winsomeman,You Can't Choose Your Friends (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/5b3fg1/you_cant_choose_your_friends_wp/

Vincent gagged on his own blood, then spat out a better part of the blockage onto the dry, yellow scrub. The Shaded Man knelt at Vincent's side. 

*He doesn't see me* said the Shaded Man through a slit of daylight that passed for a mouth. *Only you can hear me.*

Vincent's breath was fast and shallow. His eyes were locked on Medellin, standing over him, knife in one hand, his free hand plucking at the wet nest of black hair that poured from the center of his scalp.

*It's time to die* said the Shaded Man. *He got you. He got you good.*

""Don't wanna,"" whispered Vincent, pink foam frothing up at the corners of his mouth. ""Don't wanna.""

Medellin was silent. He only stood and watched. He was waiting. He knew Vincent too well to go making assumptions about a thing as important as death.

*When I say so, you need to stop breathing* said the Shaded Man, hovering close. Vincent wouldn't look directly at the thing. He only had eyes for Medellin. *Tell your heart what to do and it'll do it. Same for your lungs. Same for all of it. Time to lay down arms. Time to sleep.*

""No,"" said Vincent, his throat wet and strangled. ""Don't wanna.""

The Shaded Man sat back on his black, shadow heels. *I don't like hearing that* he said. *There's consequences. Always consequences.*

Vincent pressed his back against the tree and pushed. Bit by bit, inch by inch, he somehow managed to grind his body back to a standing position. ""Fuck you,"" he garbled. Then he spat another wad of blood and displaced tissue - this time at the center of Medellin's chest.

*Just stop* said the Shaded Man. *You've been told.*

But Vincent took a step forward, and then another. Medellin got spooked and lunged forward, stabbing Vincent once more in the shoulder. And that was fine by Vincent's account. He couldn't feel anything anyway. Besides, he had a knife of his own. He'd always kept it in his boot. And he'd just recently drawn it out, as he was struggling to his feet. It was a smaller knife - less showy. But sharp. And when Vincent jabbed it straight up through the underside of Medellin's chin it cut real clean and easy. Straight up - up up - through the mouth and back down through the throat. All in one motion.

Vincent didn't have to sit around waiting for Medellin to have the good grace to die. He was dead before he hit the ground. Vincent soon followed him, laughing weak and delirious as he slumped to the earth.

""Alright. Alright. I had my fun. You can take me.""

Vincent blinked and spun around, painful as you please. But he was alone. The Shaded Man was gone. 

""It's done?"" he wondered out loud. But the blood still fell from his chest and his shoulder. And he was so, so cold. The wind howled, hot and dry. There was nothing but the scrub and Medellin's body as far as the eye could see. 

""I'm ready,"" said Vincent, and he was. Ready to leave. Ready to move on. The pain was flaring up again. The pain and the coldness. 

""I'm ready!"" screamed Vincent. His throat was raw. 

He asked his heart to stop, but it pounded all the same. Faster, even. He tried to hold his breath, but his lungs didn't see the sense in it. Everything kept pumping.

Dying, but never dead. 

Vincent hadn't the strength to make it back to his feet, so he crawled instead. Crawled across the desert. Across the yellow and the white. He felt his flesh sear in the heat. But there was nothing else to do. Crawl. Drag his corpse body home. Hear his wife scream. See his children cry.

He looked back at Medellin's body and felt a queer stab of jealousy. 

""I'm ready,"" he gasped, as the sand trickled down his nose and throat, little grains of glass pulling apart his insides, microscopic shred by microscopic shred. ""I'm ready,"" he whispered in his ruined voice. ""I'm ready.""

The wind howled. The earth throbbed with heat. No one came. Even the shadows had abandoned him. ""I'm ready. I'm ready.""",winsomeman,Simple Instructions (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/5b3f42/simple_instructions_wp/

They were thieves now. Criminals. 

Clay recognized that it was about survival, but it ate him up all the same. It didn't help that it was so easy. Every day he felt stronger and more in control of his power. Tania was already miles ahead of him. Punching a hole through the cash slot of a vending machine should have - at the least - felt pretty impressive, but instead he just felt like a bully. All those inanimate objects didn't really stand a chance.

""Not our fault,"" Tania said one day as they sat outside a 7-11, eating microwave burritos and counting the rest of the cash they'd swiped from a laundry card machine. ""They put us on the run. Both sides. As far as I'm concerned, they're the ones who should feel sorry about all this stealing. Maybe even pay some of these people back.""

""That doesn't seem likely,"" said Clay, stuffing the pile into his side pocket. ""And we still need more to get bus tickets back to my hometown.""

""We need a laptop or a phone or something,"" said Tania. ""We need to get online. I need to find out what happened to everyone at St. Catherine's.""

""Your orphanage?"" 

Tania nodded. ""The one you tore to pieces. With all the kids and old women. Remember?""

Clay flushed slightly. ""That's low.""

Tania stood up and stretched out her limbs. Something about the way the sunlight turned golden as it filtered through her layered fronds of frizzy black hair caught Clay's eye. He had only known Tania in the midst of this new, distressful life he'd somehow come to cultivate. He'd never considered her as anything more than a temporary enemy, source of information, or companion on the run. But now that he took a moment to really look, he saw that she was...

""Don't look at me like that,"" said Tania. ""Not interested.""

""What?"" stammered Clay. ""Not interested in... I don't... *What*?""

""I've got an idea how we can make some good money. Semi-legit.""

Clay hopped to his feet, nervously straightening his filthy clothes. Tania had sprung for new clothes to replace the blood-soaked shirt and jeans she'd escaped in. Clay was being cautious with their money, however, and didn't yet see the need to replace his own clothes. ""Legitimate is good. What's the idea?""

""Come on. I'll show you.""

Sometime later, they arrived below a twitchy neon sign blaring the words *SIDE POCKETS!*

""It's got an exclamation mark, so you know it's a serious establishment,"" said Clay, as he walked past. But Tania had stopped and was opening the door. ""Wait, what?""

""Come on,"" said Tania, waving the boy through the door. ""This is it.""

Clay entered cautiously. The pool hall was a surprisingly big building, with runkled pine floors and a crackly sound system that seemed to be favoring George Thorogood and the Destroyers at that moment.

""What are we doing here?"" yelled Clay over the caterwaul of music and laughter and pitched conversation. 

""Making money,"" said Tania. ""Help me find someone who looks strong.""

""Strong?"" Clay glanced around the open room. There was a man in a yellow tank top sitting at the bar with a showy pair of biceps. ""How about him?""

""Nah. He's for later,"" said Tania. ""Less flashy.""

A broad-shouldered man in a tight-fitting flannel shirt was leaning over a nearby pool table. ""Him?""

Tania nodded. ""That'll do.""

Clay grabbed Tania's wrist as she took a step towards the pool table. ""What are we doing exactly?""

""Arm wrestling contest, obviously,"" said Tania, pushing Clay's hand off her wrist. ""Versus a girl? Versus a *black* girl? We'll clean up.""

""That feels like a very bad idea,"" said Clay. ""Also, like a bad 80s movie. Did you get this idea from an 80s movie?""

Tania rolled her eyes. ""We're cursed, Clay. If we don't use what we have to help ourselves, we're idiots.""

Clay stood, awkward and helpless, as Tania carved a path straight towards the flannel shirted man. He managed to swallow down his anxiety and catch up just as Tania was winding down her pitch.

""Small wager,"" she said, throwing her hands to the side. ""Twenty bucks. I beat my boyfriend here all the time. I need a new challenge.""

Clay's eyes widened when he realized she was talking about him. ""Right,"" he yelped. ""She's... she's a strong one.""

The man in the flannel shirt looked at Clay - making it patently clear that he didn't feel he was looking at much - before turning back to Tania. ""Show me the twenty.""

Tania nudged Clay in the ribs. ""Oh."" He pulled the wad out of his pocket and passed her a $20 bill. 

The flannel man shrugged, then crossed to the nearest open table and took a seat. Tania and Clay followed him.

""You show me yours,"" said Tania before taking a seat. The flannel man glanced at one of his pool friends, who rolled his eyes and pulled two $10 bills out of his wallet. 

""We better be splitting this,"" muttered the money man. Tania took the bills and placed them neatly on top of hers on the table, then took her seat.

""One and done,"" she said. ""No best out of three or anything.""

The flannel man nodded. ""Let's get this over with.""

And so they did. Almost instantly.

""Did you even fucking *try*?"" shouted the money man as Tania scooped the bills off the table. 

""Too fast,"" said the flannel man. ""You started too fast.""

""I won, fair and square,"" said Tania. ""You said you were ready. You want another shot, it'll cost you.""

The flannel man growled. ""Get out another twenty.""

Tania shook her head. ""I've got $40 here. My $40 against your $40.""

The flannel man snapped his fingers. ""$40.""

The money man gritted his teeth. ""Get your own $40.""

""Do it!"" barked the flannel man. Deeply begrudgingly, the money man dug out the necessary cash. 

""You better win this time,"" said the money man. ""Or we're both done drinking for the night.""

The flannel man snatched the money and slapped it on the table. ""We start on a count of three this time,"" he said. 

And so they did. By three and a half it was over.

""I'm told you don't have any more money, so you should probably step away from the table,"" said Tania, stacking up her cash with deliberate care. ""But if you have any friends who'd like to take a shot...""

""That was brutal,"" sighed the money man. But the flannel man was steamed. 

""She's fucking *strong*,"" he said, glaring at a nearby man who'd laughed at his loss. ""See for yourself. Christ.""

""This some scam?"" said the laughing man, glancing back and forth from Tania to the flannel man, trying to work out a puzzle in his mind. ""You two in this together?""

""Fuck you,"" snarled the flannel man, grabbing his jacket off a hook and stomping out of the bar, the money man in close pursuit.

""I just took his money,"" said Tania. ""That was the beginning and end of our business.""

""Alright,"" said the laughing man, who was equal parts fat and brawny. ""I'll have a go.""

He did. And then he wandered away, $20 lighter.

""Holy shit,"" he said, rubbing his shoulder as he waddled to the bar. ""That bitch is strong as fuck.""

As one, the entirety of the bar patrons swiveled in their chairs to get a look at Tania. She waved back. ""Who's next?"" she called.

They got angrier and more urgent as the night wore on. Tania, meanwhile, just got richer.

""What. The. *Fuck*!"" bellowed the man in the yellow tank top after his third loss in a row. ""How the fuck are you so strong?""

Tania shrugged. ""Focus. Concentration. I just have that extra special something I guess.""

He jabbed a finger in Clay's chest. ""You like having a girl can fuck you up like that?""

""The heart wants what it wants,"" Clay murmured through a lopsided smile.

The tank top man shook his head. ""This is fucked. Somehow this is fucked. Gimme back my money.""

Tania glared at the man. ""I don't see why. Bet's a bet. And you lost. A bunch.""

""Because I said so,"" growled the tank top man. 

Clay leaned in and whispered in Tania's ear. ""I think we need to go.""

""We can try,"" said Tania, stepping up from the table. ""I guess it's time to leave,"" she announced. ""You're making my boyfriend upset.""

Clay blinked. ""I didn't...""

""Do some push-ups,"" she said to the tank top man. ""Maybe we'll try this again once you've had a chance to develop a little.""

Together, Clay and Tania wound their way to the door and out of the bar. 

""Are you fucking crazy?"" blurted out Clay as soon as they were in the parking lot. ""Why are you antagonizing all those enormous, angry men?""

""Why not?"" said Tania. ""You need to learn to not be afraid so much, Clay. I mean, I get this is all relatively new, but you need to accept that we're different than them. Stronger. We don't have to be nice to assholes just because we're afraid. Case in point...""

Clay turned on his heels at the sound of the front door opening and closing. The man in the yellow tank top and two of his friends were stalking across the parking lot in pursuit. 

""Stop right there!"" yelled the tank top man. ""We're not done with you. I want my money back.""

Tania nodded. ""How much did you lose? Like $400? That's a lot of money. Pretty embarrassing, right?""

One of the tank top man's friends pulled out a knife. 

""I don't know what your deal is,"" said the tank top man, ""but I don't care. I want my money back.""

""Eat shit,"" said Tania, not with anger or malice, but with something like boredom in her voice.

The tank top man reached out and grabbed a wad of Clay's shirt, reared back, and slugged the teen across the face as hard as possible. Clay's head snapped back a quarter inch or less. The tank top man was looking - confused and increasingly horrified - at his broken right hand, when Clay drove his own right fist up underneath the tank top man's jaw, toppling the man ass over head.

Meanwhile, the two other men had made a move on Tania, only to receive a pair of concussive slaps across the temple that put both on their knees.

""Let's go!"" shouted Clay, ready to flee. But Tania waved him off, kicking the downed tank top man in the center of the chest. Clay could plainly hear the ribs breaking. ""Knock it off!"" he cried out. 

""Fuck them,"" said Tania, loading up another kick. Clay tackled her to the ground. 

""You're gonna kill him,"" said Clay.

""Get the fuck off me,"" snapped Tania, tossing Clay aside. ""And who gives a shit if I do? They don't know anything about us, but they were willing to beat us up, *stab* us, over what? $400? Being humiliated? Fuck them. They don't deserve to live.""

Clay swallowed. ""I don't know about that. But let's just go. We got the money. They aren't worth any more of our time.""

Tania nodded, rolling to her feet. ""Fine. But we're getting a hotel room tonight. This ass is sleeping in a bed.""

""Fine,"" said Clay. ""Let's just go.""

On the way to the hotel they bought a pay-as-you-go smartphone. Clay used the hotel WiFi to search the news while Tania took a shower.

""I'm not missing,"" he called into the bathroom. ""You neither.""

""I'm an orphan,"" said Tania through the falling water. ""No one was ever looking for me. What about St. Catherine's?""

""Hold on. It's...huh?""

""Yeah?""

""There's a story about it. Says it was destroyed as a result of an explosion at a nearby power plant. Tremors. That's odd.""

""I felt that explosion,"" said Tania. ""Didn't you?""

""I did,"" said Clay, remembering. ""But isn't that an odd coincidence?""

Tania poked her head around the curtain. ""Who said it was a coincidence?""

Clay nodded. ""You think maybe the other team... the one with Ellen..?""

""I don't know. Not sure it matters right now. Oh."" Tania poked her head back out again. ""I just remembered. Don't go on any of your social networks or login accounts or anything like that. They might be able to track us. We have to assume they're watching for any sign.""

Clay sighed. ""Right. So...when exactly do we get to stop being on the run.""

""No idea. Maybe never.""

Clay turned the phone off. ""Great."" His stomach had started hurting again. His head, too. Everything ached in a cold, pulsing manner. ""You alright? I mean that gash on your side, from when...""

""It's fine,"" said Tania quickly.

""Oh,"" said Clay. ""Good.""

""I never understood,"" asked Tania from the shower. ""How come you went with that Rory guy so quickly? You always sound so sad about leaving your family. Doesn't make sense to me.""

""I... don't really know,"" said Clay. ""I think because I always suspected something was wrong. Or something was hidden. Not that they were always lying to me, but that there was always something important they weren't telling me. Like they didn't trust me. And it made me feel like I was close to them, but just on the outside of some invisible barrier. I don't know if that makes any sense. Rory showing up at my house and telling me that I was... whatever it is I am... and then *proving* it... I guess it was kind of a last straw thing. I'm not sure if I regret it or not, but I know I still need to talk to them. I need to hear it from them. Because for all that, I don't *want* to be mad at them. I want the good stuff to be true. I don't want to lose my history.""

The water turned off. ""Yeah. Alright.""

Clay sat inside the open door, fiddling with the phone. ""I just hope I can find some answers this time.""

Tania's head poked back out. ""Can you get the fuck out of the bathroom now? I'm trying to get out of the shower.""

""Shit. Sorry!"" Clay crawled out of the way, closing the door as he went. He tossed the phone on the bed and went to the window. It was dark outside, but bright below the window, which happened to look down over a 24 hour Arby's. Clay watched the cars streak away down the distant highway. Tomorrow that would be him.

He was going home again. 

This time he wasn't going to fuck it up. He was going to get some answers.

Colin eyed the mewling puppy with distrust.

""I don't know, Mom,"" he sighed.

The puppy, named Pom-Pom, was an English Bulldog, jowly and slack-eyed just eight weeks into existence. It gnawed on the cuff of Colin's jeans. 

""Say *ow* and pull away,"" said Colin's mother. ""Remember? We have to teach it not to bite us.""

""Ow,"" said Colin flatly, pushing the fleshy dog away with the tip of his finger. ""I'm just... what about Casper and Ellie and Dexter?""

Colin's mother was named Marie. She had curly black hair and a spray of pale pink freckles bleeding out from her nose and crossing down towards her neck. ""Casper, Elle, and Dex are gone, honey. You know that. We're all very sad they're gone, but it's okay to move on. It's okay to like Pom-Pom. I don't think they'll mind.""

""I don't know,"" said Colin. But there wasn't much more to say about it, so he scooped up Pom-Pom and cradled the puppy in his arms. *Probably they wouldn't mind*, he thought. *Probably.* And then Pom-Pom bit his finger and Colin didn't have to pretend to be hurt.

Two days later, Colin told his father he was trying out for the boy's soccer team after school, so he'd be late. His father had been a baseball player growing up, but any sport was better than no sport, so he nodded and said, 'Good luck.""

Colin, however, had no interest in soccer. Instead, the appearance of Pom-Pom had raised a deep, guilty sadness within the boy. He'd reneged on a promise. He'd been negligent. 

So after school he got off at John Vivek's house and walked down Miller towards Nebraska Ave. He'd managed to never forget the address - 315 Nebraska - though he was pretty certain he'd be able to find the house regardless. And sure enough, there it was - still that pale purple color with the black shutters closed tight on every window. It hadn't changed, not even a little. The shrubs that lined the walkway were still patchy and dry and sharp as knives. Colin walked carefully up to the front door. He worried, belatedly, if the old woman would even remember him. Would she scold him for forgetting? For staying away so long?

Colin may have been forgetful, but he was brave, too, and knew when he had to take his lumps. He pressed the doorbell and stood back. 

The bell echoed like a banging gong inside the house. Then there was a cacophony of barks and yips and growls. Colin jumped at the sheer volume of competing noises. He almost turned and ran, but then a voice inside bellowed out *Quiet!* and the noise died away and the door opened slowly.

""Yes?"" Colin could just see the one eye peeking through the crack. It was white and murky, like dirty water, surrounded by crumpling layers of red and yellow flesh.

""Hi,"" said Colin. ""I'm... I'm Colin Raheem. I'm... I was hoping I could see Casper, Ellie, and Dexter.""

""Colin?"" said the old woman slowly. ""Ah. Ah, yes. I remember. You've been away a long time. Your children were getting worried you'd forgotten them.""

""No, no never,"" said Colin hastily. ""I've just been... been busy. Are they okay?""

The old woman chuckled. ""Right as rain, child. I told you I'd watch over them. I watch over all of them that comes to stay in my house. You wanna visit for a spell you said?""

""Yes,"" said Colin, even as his insides told him he shouldn't and he began to remember why he'd been so bad about visiting. ""I'd like to say hi if that's alright.""

""Well, they'll be pleased to see you,"" said the old woman. ""I told before, you ought to come by as often as you can."" She pulled the door open wider. Colin couldn't help but stare. She'd always been old, from the first moment he'd met her, in the little cemetery way back behind the duck pond. He'd been crying over the fresh lump of upturned soil and flat stone that marked Casper's burial mound when she'd appeared, as if from nowhere, to make her offer. It had seemed so wrong and strange to Colin then, but he missed his dog. Perhaps too dearly. So he'd agreed and she'd told him to leave the cemetery and given him the address: 315 Nebraska. 

""Come and visit any time,"" she'd said.
  
She'd been old that day in the cemetery, but now she was even older. That made sense, Colin reminded himself. People got older. But the old lady seemed worse off, somehow. Like the flesh was trying to crawl off her body. Like the bones beneath had some other place to be.
 
""Casper, baby,"" she called. ""Ellie. Dexter.""

Colin looked down at the dogs and cats and hamsters and parrots and other assorted animals that roamed throughout the house. They all looked a bit like the old woman - wrong somehow. Hanging together by a thread. Their eyes were just a bit too dim. Their flesh a bit too slack and dry. The hair too brittle. 

""Here's a good boy,"" said the old lady and Colin turned back to look. It was Casper. 

""How long has it been?"" asked the old lady. 

Colin swallowed. ""A year. Maybe two.""

Casper's long, white tail wagged heartily as the dog lumbered forward. His eyes were nearly clear, filmed over in a dark, dripping fluid. His teeth were gone, his gums black and purple. There was a ragged crater on his left side, gray puckered flesh leading down to broken yellow bones and weakly pulsing greenish-black organs.

The dog rubbed its head against Colin's thighs, flecks of white hair and yellow skin peeling off, floating down like winter snow. The boy put a cautious hand to the dog's head and felt how cold and clammy the thing was. 

""And here's two more,"" said the old woman joyfully. Ellie and Dexter bounded into the room. A pug and a puggle, they both looked more like flayed moles than dogs. The flesh of their faces had collapsed down over their eyes, leaving both blind and nearly featureless. Dexter dragged a rotten stump of a hind left leg. The better part of Ellie's insides hung from a gaping hole in her chest cavity, dragging along the thin carpet. 

""Just as you remember them,"" said the old woman. ""What a happy reunion.""

Finally, Colin screamed at the horror of what he'd done. He turned to run and tripped over Casper's living carcass, falling hard to the ground. His pets swarmed him happily. Lapping his face with dry, cold tongues. Grinding their decaying flesh against his flailing arms and chest. Colin curled into a ball and covered his face.

The other dogs caught the excitement and started barking. Cats howled. Parrots squawked. 

""Oh, how I love to see a boy and his pets,"" cried the old woman over the growing clamor of dead animal voices. ""Nuthin' more beautiful in the world! Nuthin' at all!""",winsomeman,Reunion House (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/5a92rn/reunion_house_wp/

___________________________________________

I was ready. I'd read a couple online tutorials. Skimmed a few FAQs for cheats and hidden tricks. I saw perfectly well what had gone wrong on my first playthrough. Not just one mistake, but a series of them, all stacking up on top of the other. Rookie stuff. No problem. I was *ready* now. This time I was going to beat the Prom level.

As a rule, I don't go back to my savepoints all that often. In truth, I have something of a tendency to forget to save at all. I get caught up, I guess. Think too much about what's coming next and what happened before and next thing you know, I'm neck-deep in the next stage and it's too late to save. And then I get self-conscious. *Why would I want to come back to THIS me?* I wonder. Always feels like things need to be going juuuust right before I save, so I have nice base to start off from. But I guess things never really work out that way.

With prom, though, I was smart. I recognized right away it was going to be an extremely tricky stage - something I'd probably want to play through a few times to get just right. So I saved that morning. Right away - 9am. Day of Prom. *Saved*. 

And as it turns out, things went to shit so thoroughly and so *immediately*, that I wanted no part of the Prom stage. No thanks. The College Application stage was a cakewalk after that shitshow.

But finally I'd had some time to reflect. The humiliation was in the past, dulled by time. I'd gotten through the entire College Expansion Pack without losing a single life. I mean, my score wasn't much to brag about, but I got through to the end and that's no small thing. 

It was the summer after graduation. Big things in front of me. Difficult, new challenges. Lots of grinding. Nothing I was looking all that forward to. So that's when I decided to go back and finally conquer the Prom.

That was the idea, anyway.

Looking at it now, it's clear to see that the file had been corrupted. I'd never heard much about that, but I knew vaguely that it was a possibility. Data degrades over time. Files need to be monitored. Like I said, I don't replay stages very often and I hardly ever think to create savepoints. Maybe that was part of it. Maybe it was a hardware error and not a software one. I don't know. 

This is what happened.

I loaded the old save and I woke up in a stiff, distorted version of my body. There was some lag. As I walked away from the checkpoint, my body trailed a series of frozen afterimages. My mother's mouth moved and the words raced to catch up a half second later. The color palette was slightly wrong, too. Purple sky. Dirt brown skin. Green floors. My tux was invisible somehow - the textures and colors missing completely. 

Some people know ways to drop out of their replays right away if something goes wrong. Speedrunners have all kinds of hacks for dropping out and back in almost instantaneously so they can have another crack at whatever record they're trying to break. Like I said, though, I've never been very experienced with this stuff. I had to keep playing until I lost a life or completed the level.

Things only really got worse, somehow. The assets were either completely fried or arbitrarily swapped and intermixed. My date, Jenny White, was wearing the same prom dress as I remembered, but she had Jeremy Waters' face, which was especially unenjoyable since Jeremy once flushed my head in a toilet in the 5th grade. The corsage I gave ""Jenny"" had somehow flipped with the croissant I'd eaten for breakfast. She was still pretty pleased with her wrist pastry, thankfully. Though having her soft voice cooing out of Jeremy Waters' thinly mustachioed face was something of a buzzkill.

The limousine had no roof or doors. The limo driver was just a pixelated skeleton in a hat. Jenny/Jeremy put her/his hand on my thigh was we wheedled through the suburbs in Wonder Woman's limo. My original playthrough was looking better all the time.

The prom was supposed to be at the ballroom in the Radisson. Instead, we pulled up to the local hospital where I'd had my tonsils removed. Many of the interior walls seemed to be composed entirely of frozen balloons. As we entered the dancehall/cafeteria, my old principal floated past on a gurney with no wheels, shouting dialogue from *The Avengers*.

""Pretty great, right?"" asked Jenny/Jeremy, eyes sparkling through the forest of her/his heavy unibrow.

""It really is,"" I said. Then everything froze, even Jenny/Jeremy. 

And everything went neon green.

And everything went concrete gray.

And a peeling, digital wail filled my ears. A line of code appeared in the gray. 

The system booted me out.

And that was my lone attempt at a re-play. I took my data pack in to get it inspected and it was pretty much what I thought - ruined; all of it. So, no more going back, even if I wanted to. Which is fine. Puts a little more weight on getting things right the first time, I suppose. Or maybe not getting things right. Maybe just appreciating things however they turn out. 

I saw Jeremy Waters just the other day. He works in the grocery store. I smiled at him, thinking of a thing we shared that only one of us actually experienced. But he smiled right back. Which was pretty nice. Because that was real. Just like all the rest of this big, long, live playthrough we're all doing. It's rarely perfect, but at least we get to share it with each other.

The castle had changed since the last time she'd been there. Crawling white pillars loomed like an enormous, stone fence. The broad, curving stairs were laced with flecks of jade and chasing lines of platinum. The wide, double doors were solid slabs of pressed gold. 

""He's having a mid-life crisis,"" she sighed, as she let herself in through the doors. ""Idiot.""

He was concerned about his legacy. She knew that as well as she knew everything else. He was a builder who was no longer confident in the things he'd built. In many ways he'd never been confident. 

And with good reason - everything was going to shit.

""Hey!"" she shouted from the foyer. ""Stop hiding in the pantry and get out here. We need to talk.""

From somewhere deep in the castle she could hear an exaggerated sigh, then a *POP* as he appeared before her instantaneously.

""That is *very* irritating,"" he said as he materialized a plush, velvet-lined armchair from the ether and plopped down like a scolded teenager. ""If I'm hiding it's obviously because *I don't want to talk to you*. Duh.""

""And obviously *I don't care*,"" she replied, placing a foot on one of the armrests. ""We need to talk.""

""About what?"" he sighed, rolling his eyes. ""You'll have to forgive me my ignorance. Not all of us know everything.""

She took a deep calming breath. He was scared. He was frustrated. That's why he was lashing out. It didn't make him any less annoying to know that, but it helped. ""We need to make some decisions soon.""

""Oooooh!"" he shouted, spinning up off the armchair. ""*We* is it? *We*? Or is it *you*? You want to take control. You don't like what I've done with the universe. You know..."" He started pacing a wide circle across the mostly empty foyer. ""I *tried* back in the day, alright? I *tried*. I get that you know more than I do, but do you know what it's like having every little choice you make analyzed and criticized? Do you remember those damnable reports you used to prepare for me - the *HERE'S A BREAKDOWN OF EVERY HORRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF YOUR DECISION Report*?""

""Those made you upset,"" she said, nodding. ""I'm aware.""

He laughed. ""I *know* you're aware.""

""And what would you suggest *I* do?"" she hissed. ""Pretend I don't see it? Pretend I don't know? I am *not* trying to punish you by showing you these things. I'm only doing what little I can. I can't save anyone or fix anything. All I can do is tell you what I know. I understand that's painful for you. It's painful for me, too. But that's the system we picked.""

""That's the system *He* picked,"" he replied, bitterly. ""It was supposed to be easier doing this together."" He shook his head. ""I'm sorry. What did you want?""

""We need to talk about Mars,"" she said. ""Can I have a seat?""

""Oh, sorry,"" he said, sheepish. An overstuffed couch popped up across from the armchair. She sat down.

""This is important,"" she said, steepling her fingers. ""This is one of the most important decision points we've ever faced. If they get to Mars - if they tame Mars - they will go further. And they won't stop until they've conquered the stars.""

""Conquered?"" he said, standing behind the armchair. ""You mean...?""

""Eventually all those species... all those other civilizations... those will fall."" She looked up. ""But if they don't leave... if they cannot make it off their planet... they're doomed. And much more quickly than you may have guessed.""

He tugged at his ear and nearly wept from frustration. ""Right. I see.""

""I know you think I've been critical of you,"" she said. ""But you have never chosen wrong. And I don't believe you have ever acted incorrectly. It is simply the nature of our lives. There will always be suffering.""

""If they die,"" he said, slowly, pondering the words carefully. ""Does that mean that we...""

She smiled and shook her head. ""I do not know. Honestly and truly. That is the one dark corner where light does not shine for me.""

He nodded, then crossed to the couch and sat down beside her. ""Had we the chance, would you have exchanged roles, do you think? Sight for me. Power for you. Do you think maybe... maybe we could have survived things better that way?""

She shook her head. ""It wouldn't have mattered, husband. These gifts are not compatible.""

""Would you like..."" He paused, reaching out for her hand. ""Would you like me to take it away from you? Both burdens would be mine and you... you could rest.""

""I would die and go into the Wastes,"" she said, shaking her head. ""And you would go mad. He was right to split those burdens between us. Neither of us could handle both. And I could not stand to lose you.""

""Are we not already lost?"" he asked. 

""We will fight again,"" she nodded. ""No matter what choices we make, we will always find a way to conflict. But - just as surely - we will always find a way back to each other.""

He smiled, pulling her close into his arms. ""You talk as if you can see the future.""

""Perhaps,"" she laughed, her head nestled against his chest. ""Or perhaps it's just a woman's intuition."" ",winsomeman,Dust and Bone (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/59o8gi/dust_and_bone_wp/

""I understand your curiosity,"" said Collier, kicking the door shut as he stalked cautiously into the holding cell. ""We haven't been very open. I get that. In truth, there's been some internal debate about that.""

Collier sighed. Clay couldn't recall ever standing so close to the man. He'd known Collier was big, but he'd somehow never managed to get the full picture of it until just that moment. There was a strange knotty, curvature to the man's muscles that gave him the partial appearance of a wild dog. Lean, but hulking. No wasted space.

""I've always been on the side of telling you everything,"" continued Collier, gun pointed at Tania, mace pointed at Clay. ""But you're still kids. And kids do dumb things."" He cleared his throat. ""Tania here has been fed misinformation. Dangerous misinformation. That's why she's in quarantine. Deprogramming's not a simple thing. And while it might look inhumane, remember *you're* the ones with special powers. *You're* the ones who can deflect bullets and punch holes through walls. We're the ants in this thing. And this is us being cautious. Only that.""

Clay realized belatedly that in moving away from Collier he'd drifted apart from Tania. That was probably intentional. 

""What evidence do you have to prove any of that?"" said Clay, eyeing the canister of mace and suddenly wondering if it even *was* mace. Whatever it was, he had to assume it wasn't a bluff. ""Anyone can say they're the good guy.""

""You want evidence? That's fine. You come with me and we leave her here. Then I'll show you everything we have.""

Clay glanced at Tania. She was staring at the gun. 

""Would you really shoot her?"" he asked.

Collier gritted his teeth and twisted his head to the side. ""If we had to, yes. I'm hoping it doesn't come down to that.""

""She doesn't have any powers right now.""

""I'm well aware,"" said Collier. ""Otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered with the gun."" 

""Then she comes with me,"" said Clay. ""Show us both. Let's go get Becker and you can show all of us.""

""Absolutely not,"" said Collier. ""And you better stop trying to push your...""

In his annoyance, Collier had rounded on Clay, taking his attention off Tania. She seized her chance, diving forward to grab the gun out of Collier's hand. She was slow and tired and beaten down, but still she managed to time things well enough to grab the gun by the barrel and twist.

Collier yelled and pulled both triggers, blasting Clay in the face with a stream of tear gas as the gun in his other hand fired a round with an echoing *CRACK*. Blind and nearly deaf, Clay staggered backwards, hearing the gun go off once more. Enraged and disoriented, he rushed forward to where he thought Collier ought to be. ""Tania?"" he shouted. 

He sensed movement directly ahead and reached out, grabbing handfuls of clothing. Someone tried to kick him away. Who? Clay held on tight as he desperately tried to remember what Tania and Collier were wearing. Then he stumbled forward and felt the outline of firm back muscles and knew it had to be Collier. 

With a flick of the wrists, Clay whipped the body up and away, out and across the room. He heard a cry of pain and a heavy thud and then nothing but his own heavy breathing. 

""Tania?"" he whispered, fingers digging madly into his weeping eyes. ""Tania?""

He felt a hand at his back. ""Yeah."" It was Tania.

""Collier?""
 
She squeezed his shoulder. ""I think we need to go.""

""Did he get you?"" asked Clay, allowing Tania to drag him up to his feet. 

""Not really,"" she said, holding the boy out at arm's length. ""Just follow me.""

Clay reached out and grabbed the hem of her shirt. Then Tania did the rest, pushing open the door and jogging awkwardly down the hallway.

Blind and in agony, Clay did his best to keep up. Unable to see and unwilling to think too hard about what was happening around him, Clay's kept replaying the sound of Collier's gun going off and that heavy, smacking *thud* of an adult man's body crashing into a concrete wall. Was Collier dead? Would it be better if he was? 

What about the man at the orphanage? At what point did Clay's unnatural abilities mean he couldn't reasonably claim self-defense? When did *Clay* become the bad guy?

""Ahead - ahead! Go! Go!"" Clay was lost in these thoughts and the mania of the moment, when Tania reached back and grabbed him by the wrist, whipping around and propelling him forward. Still blind, he stumbled forward. He heard another gunshot. He *felt* the bullet deflect off his cheek a heartbeat before crashing into someone and sending them flying down the hall. 

""Come on! Come on!"" Tania's hand was on Clay's again, pulling him along. His eyes had started to clear. He wondered if the tear gas had been watered down or if the fast recovery was due to his strange abilities. Either way, his senses began coming back to him. The sparse whiteness of the hallway. The clapping echoes of their feet. And distant yells.

""They're coming,"" said Tania. ""Run faster.""

And he did. His head and eyes finally clear, Clay focused his mind on the act of running - running fast, running hard - and felt a strange swell of energy in his limbs. He could hardly feel his feet touch the ground. Everything flowing in synchronicity. It wasn't until he heard Tania yell out, ""Slow down, damnit!"" that he understood just how fast he was moving.

He stopped. They were back at the steel door leading to the bunk area. An alarm was sounding. 

Clay grabbed the door handle, only to find that it locked on both sides.

""Shit!"" he hissed. ""I left the keys back there.""

Tania shrugged. ""Just knock the damn thing open.""

""I..."" Clay had an excuse ready, but pulled it back. Why couldn't he? He'd felt that power when he was running and when he'd thrown Collier across the room. It was there. It was accessible. 

Taking a deep breath, he drew both arms over his head and brought them crashing down on the center of the door. 

""FUCK!"" he squealed, hugging both arms against his chest as they bounced uselessly against the doors. ""What the *fuck*?""

""You really suck at this,"" said Tania. ""*Focus*, goddamnit.""

""Stop!"" Clay turned. Down the hall, Rory and two others were standing, holding up their hands. ""Slow down, Clay. What's going on here?""

""We're leaving,"" said Tania. ""Stay back!""

""We kept you apart for a reason,"" said Rory, more subdued than Clay could recall him ever sounding. ""They fed her lies. It's not her fault, but she doesn't know the truth.""

""What's the truth?"" shouted Clay, trying to focus, trying to draw strength into his arms.

""You *know* the truth,"" said Rory. ""I've already told you everything you need to know.""

""No, you haven't,"" said Clay. ""You said this was a war, but you've never said who the enemy is. Who did this to me? Why? Who are you fighting?""

""This isn't the sort of conversation we should be having right now,"" said Rory. ""There's a reason we've been taking our time with you.""

""He's stalling,"" murmured Tania, grabbing Clay by the elbow and shaking. ""Stop talking and let's go!""

""We're keeping you safe,"" said Rory. Whether or not it was a lie, it was obvious Rory believed it. But that wasn't enough for Clay - at least not anymore.

""I don't need you to *keep me safe*!"" yelled Clay, wheeling around and throwing a straight right hand at the steel door. It peeled away from the wall like cardboard, skipping heavily across the exercise room.

""Stay mad,"" said Tania, grabbing his wrist and pulling him through the dim room. Clay kept waiting for the sound of gun fire from behind, but it never came. No shouts. No running footsteps. Just the peeling wail of the alarm, ringing from room to room.

""They aren't following,"" he said. Tania wasn't listening. She was focused on running.

""Wait!"" said Clay, grinding to a stop. ""We have to get Becker.""

""Who?"" said Tania. 

""Another one of us,"" said Clay. ""He was with me at the orphanage when we...""

""We don't have time,"" said Tania. ""We need to get out of the building.""

""No,"" said Clay. ""We have to...""

""Time to call it quits, son."" Clay flinched at the voice. Blackman and his thin, salt-and-pepper mustache rounded the corner, intercepting the pair. ""She needs to go back to her cell.""

""We're leaving,"" said Clay. ""And we're taking Becker with us.""

Blackman shook his head. ""That boy has much better sense than you.""

Looking slightly shamefaced, Becker appeared at Blackman's side. ""C'mon, Clay. You need to quit it. I wanted answers. I didn't want you to rip the place apart and make a run for it."" 

""We're never going to get answers,"" said Clay. ""Not in here. Not from *them*.""

Becker shook his head, almost mournfully. ""Just calm down, Clay. I messed up. I shouldn't have gotten you those keys. Now you're all riled up and...""

""Subdue them,"" barked Blackman, pointing at Clay and Tania.  ""You started this, you clean it up.""

Becker shook his head. ""I can't... you want me to fight Clay?""

""You're better than him,"" said Blackman. ""Stronger. You have better control. Do you think she's the only one they've corrupted? There are more out there and they will be prepared.  So here's your test, Becker. Subdue your ally. Capture the girl. You want calm - create calm.""

Becker was still shaking his head. ""You never said anything about having to fight each other.""

Tania took the opening of the disagreement and tried to sprint past Blackman, who swiftly stepped into her path and checked her viciously into the wall.

""Hey!"" shouted Clay, diving forward to grab Blackman, only to find Becker in his path.

""Knock it off,"" said Becker, lifting Clay up by the front of his shirt.

""We need to get out of here,"" panted Clay as he struggled against the farm boy's iron grip. 

""They're taking care of us,"" snarled Becker, grunting as Clay landing flailing kicks to his chest and abdomen. ""We don't know *her*.""

""They're *lying* to us,"" said Clay, desperately peeling back Becker's fingers and dropping to the floor just in time to catch a swift knee to the sternum.

Rory and his men appeared in the room. ""Stay back,"" said Blackman, holding Tania by the throat. ""Let Becker manage this.""

Clay pulled himself up to his feet. He felt cold all over, like he was in the downward swing of a fever. Everything prickled, as if invisible ants were crawling over his skin and all throughout his inner framework. He felt like he might vomit or faint or explode into a million pieces.

Becker trudged forward, throwing a wild punch that Clay managed to duck, curl under, and counter with a rising elbow to the chin that took Becker off his feet.

""Use your size and strength,"" ordered Blackman, tightening his grip on Tania's throat. The girl choked and gurgled, clawing weakly at the man's white, bloodless hand.

Clay swung another elbow, but instead of evading, Becker moved into the blow, wrapping Clay's right arm in the pit of his left, and wrapping his free arm around Clay's neck. ""Knock it off,"" he whispered as he squeezed. ""We can't go out there on our own.""

""I... don't... trust them,"" said Clay, trying with all his might to slip his other arm up inside Becker's bear hug and wedge himself free.

""Too bad,"" said Becker, annoyed. ""Git over it.""

Instead, Clay raised his foot and brought it down with every ounce of power he could muster straight onto the front of Becker's left foot. Clay could feel the bones splinter and part under his heel. Becker's grip loosened as he swore in agony. Clay used the opening to grab Becker under the knee and flip him over in a sudden body slam, dropping the bigger boy straight down on his head.

Blackman was so stunned by the sudden reversal of fortune, that he didn't notice Tania pulling the exact same move, slamming her heel down on his near foot. Somewhere in the chaos of the escape and Clay's fight with Becker, however, some small part of Tania's power had returned to her, so she did not simply break part of Blackman's foot - she popped it like a blister filled with blood and bones. 

Rory and his men shouted. Blackman fainted straight away. And Clay and Tania ran, bursting through locked steel doors, climbing seemingly endless collections of stairs, always winding their way upwards, towards level ground. The sounds of pursuit faded away behind them. The sound of the ringing alarm died away as they climbed the final set of stairs. There was natural light - morning light - up ahead. 

Clay kicked his way through a final glass door and then they were outside. Cars passed on the road in front of them. There was a gas station across the street. The air smelled of coffee and gasoline. Tania ran left. Clay followed her. They kept running, going nowhere in particular, simply disappearing deeper and deeper into the small, quiet town. 

Finally, Tania stopped, clutching her sides, heaving air and slick with sweat. ""Fuck,"" she muttered. ""Fuck.""

Clay took a deep breath. They were free. A costly kind of free.

""You're bleeding."" Clay reached out, trying to touch Tania's side, but she swatted the hand away.

""Grazed,"" she said, shaking her head. ""The drugs are wearing off. I'll be fine.""

""You sure?"" The blood reached from just under her left armpit to the middle of her thigh. 

""Yeah. It's nothing."" 

""I'm going back home,"" Clay said after a time.

""What?"" said Tania, wiping the sweat out of her eyes. 

""I'm going back to see my parents,"" said Clay. ""I need to try again. I need to hear what they have to say.""

""I thought you were almost captured by men with guns the last time you tried that?""

Clay nodded. ""I don't know what else to do. And I don't know where else to go. That's the only place I can think to start. They *know* something. Where I came from. How they ended up with me. And I need to know if Callie is okay.""

""Your sister,"" said Tania, remembering. ""Alright.""

""Yeah?""

Tania shrugged. ""I don't have any better ideas. Just don't fuck it up like you did last time.""

""Yeah,"" said Clay. ""I don't intend to.""

What beasts lurk below the still, blue glass? What monsters?  

*Spirit* purrs beneath me, all around me, as I slip through the sky, brazen and unchecked. A man among birds. And while my windows point forward and upward, my mind points downward, down towards that third world, the blue and black world that has vexed and terrified us for so long. That great barrier to progress, which has kept us boarded up in stagnant lands. 

The wild, pure ocean. Eater of Man. Devourer of Dreams. How many centuries did we ask politely for its aid in passage? How many millennia? And always the answer was *No*. Death and drowning. Men lost and never found. Was it storms, perhaps? Monstrous walls of water? Or something else? Creatures of the deep. Beasts from the black. Inhabitants of that unknown third world. 

Bah.

So, the sea rejected us. No matter. Man does not take rejection lightly. Not from the natural world - the world we have been set about to govern and bend to our will. We have found another way. *The sky*. Another shade of blue. Lighter. Softer. And yielding. The sky welcomed us as a long-lost friend. It beckoned us with signs and hints and encouraged us ever. It showed us the feather upon the breeze and said, ""Look! This could be you."" It grabbed Minister Franklind's kite and held it aloft and said, ""See? See? We are friend. We are friend.""

The routes to Eastern Asia have become clogged and political. The Soviets tax the roads and choke our trade to serve their agenda. They think their girth and geography grants them a superiority they have not earned. Soon they will see. Soon.

*The Spirit of Stockholm* is the best of her breed. Powerful and efficient. As long as our estimates are correct and the way is clear, she will breach the ocean barrier and forge a new path for Mother Sweden. We shall open our own doors and build new alliances, unencumbered by the machinations of the Soviets. 

We go west in search of the East.

It is a long flight. Longer than any flight ever, by much and more. I have trained by circling the great airfields of Vallen, over and over again. But there I was above land. There I was buoyed by the notion of escape, if necessary. Here there is no escape. There is only me and the *Spirit* and my ally above and my enemy below. It drives a man to concern.

My radio crackles. Perhaps I am approaching Asia? It should not be...I have not been aloft long enough, but I cannot think of any other explanation. The radio is crawling to life, slowly gathering coherence. And there is a voice in the crackle. The voice is urgent and alarmed. It speaks in a language I do not understand. I have been briefed in Japanese and Mandarin and this is neither. It is not even similar. Nothing that is being said makes sense to me. 

I hazard an attempt. ""This is Charles Lindbergh. I come as a representative of the Kingdom of Sweden. I come to discuss trade. I repeat, my name is Charles Lindbergh...""

The radio squeals and the voice returns, urgent and sour. A shadow passes overhead and for the first time I see that I am not alone in the sky. A plane passes overhead, and then another. They do not bear the marks of Japan. They do not bear any marks that I am familiar with. What nation is this? Planes pass and circle in a swarm now. Where am I? What nation possesses such casual aeronautic might?

A plane pulls alongside me and I can just see the man inside the cockpit. He is darkly skinned. A strange reddish-brown I have never encountered. His eyes are wide as he appraises me. There is a painted crest near the tail of his plane. It is a serpent with feathers. I do not know these people. I do not know where I am. 

The radio continues to squeal and shout. I look to land. They must want me to land and that is what I wish as well. I think they may be escorting me to their airfields. 

But no. Continually they cut across me, driving me away from the land. The voice yells madly in that wild, unnatural tongue. I cannot go back to the ocean. It is too far to turn back. They must see that. They must understand. If only I might land. I could explain. I could show them. I have brought a sampling of our national wares. They will see. They will understand. I need only to *land*.

I drive back towards the shore. The air rattles and the *Spirit* shudders below me, all around me. Around and around they swarm, like bees protecting their queen. There is more rattling. Bullets. The glass of the cockpit shatters and the wind of this strange new land swirls around me.

The *Spirit* dips a wing and then a nose. The voice has gone quiet. As I lose altitude, I see that I will miss land. There is only the ocean below me. The great, terrible ocean. 

The sky, I now see, was a false friend. There were monsters there all along. What monsters are trapped below that sheet of blue glass, I wonder? I go now to find out.  ",winsomeman,Above the Blue Menagerie (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/5970ob/above_the_blue_menagerie_wp/

______________________________________________

I am thinking about Sharon who works in Accounting and wears those form-fitting pencil skirts with the checkered patterns when I open the door. I am thinking about Sharon's breasts and her lips and her perfume as I step through the door and into the darkness. I am thinking of what it might feel like to press up against Sharon, to wrap my arms around her, to bury my face in her neck, when I reach back for the light switch. I am imagining myself finding the line of the zipper down the back of her pencil skirt and pulling slowly downward when my hand floats through nothingness once, then twice, then again.

I am still thinking about Sharon and her breasts and her skirt as I whirl around in the darkness, seeing no light switch, seeing no wall, seeing no door, seeing nothing at all.

And just like that, Sharon is gone and I am aware of the quiet and the darkness and the faint smell of pine.

I am in a room with no beginning and no ending. I am aware that it may not be a room. I do not know what else it might be.

There is ground below me. That is all I have. But just as I say this to myself, I realize that it is not true. I raise my foot and lower it. It does not find purchase. It does not find bottom. I reach for my feet and find nothing. I reach for my face and find nothing.

Nothing.

So where is my mind?

I try swimming through the darkness. I ask my limbs to fan out and contract; to rise and fall. But there is nothing that says they can hear me. There is nothing that says they still exist.

All that I have are thoughts. And what do those prove? Do they alone argue for my existence?

And yet there... there it is again... that smell of pine. Of distilled forest. Of cleanliness.

What else can I do to prove I exist? I have misplaced my mouth. My hands have abandoned me. My legs do not recognize me.

What do I have?

I have Sharon, I suppose. I have the thought of her smile. I have the searing memory of her hand on mine as she gathers a pile of documents from my arms. I have that radiating warmth that bursts from the center of my stomach, down to my groin and up through my chest, every time she walks into the office. 

I have Sharon.

I have Melanie, too, I suppose. But do I? I try to recall Melanie, there in the dark, in the void, in the weightless, soundless nothing. Her face is abstract. Strangely angled and vague.

Melanie. My wife. She will not join me in the dark.

But then, I suppose, we have grown apart, haven't we? She is sullen and reserved. In recent months, she has been nothing but glares and cold quietness. We do not love each other anymore, I think. I know I do not. I have Sharon. Sharon is there, in my heart. Sharon is here now, in the darkness. And where is Melanie? I cannot find her. I cannot recall her.

The pine scent remains. And something else. Stinging, chemical. Unpleasant. 

Bleach, perhaps?

Why can't I find myself? My body is here, somewhere. I know it is. The rest of me is near. Down here. In the dark. 

I exist. I must. 

Will Sharon look for me? My heart says she will, but where is my heart? Is it with me in the dark? Is it floating further and further away?

Sharon will look for me.

And Melanie? No. I don't believe she will. She is afraid of the dark. No. She will not come looking for me.

It is bleach. It is strong. Why can I smell, but not see? Not hear? Not feel? And why bleach?

Where was I when I fell into the darkness? I am struggling to remember and it was not long ago.

I was somewhere, thinking about Sharon.

Does Sharon think about me?

I will ask her. Once I find my way out of the darkness.

The smell of bleach is beginning to fade. And I am saddened by this somehow. It is unpleasant, but it is a sense. My last sense. And it is going away. What happens when it is gone? Then I will have nothing. Nothing but my thoughts. Might they go away, too?

I must escape this darkness. I have work tomorrow. Sharon will be there. In her pencil skirts. With her perfume. 

I will tell Melanie. I will tell her about Sharon.

She will understand. 

I suspect she may already guess.

Yes. 

I must find myself.

In this darkness.

________________________________________________

""Well?""

The guy was a stooge - small, bland, and gooey. Everyone said it'd be easy. ""He'll sing like a canary,"" they'd said. ""He can't *quit* yammering.""

So I was going at it hard. No reason to build up a head of steam. I had him in the old garden shed. Tied up. Single dying lightbulb overhead, swinging in the evening breeze. The good stuff. Theatrical. 

""I'm not wastin' my words on a bum like you,"" I said, pulling a pair of pliers down from the wall. ""Where. Is. The money?""

He opened his mouth. *Good,* I thought. *Here we go. Done before the sixth inning.* But then he closed it right back up and shook his head.

I grunted, waving the pliers right under his nose. I'm cautious with my word count. A million's a lot, but these things sneak up on you. My last monthly report, I was just over the halfway point. Five hundred thousand words. Just like that. You'd hardly think it'd be so easy to say so much in only 42 years, but there you have it. And I'm mindful about these things. I like a good adjective as much as the next guy, but those are strictly for writing or for thinking. Not for saying. Same for adverbs. Gotta keep it lean if you want to live to see your grandkids graduate from college.

The man was looking at the pliers and making little, whiny dog sounds. Whimpering. And then his eyes would go from the pliers to my face and then down to his crotch.

""Talk!"" I barked. Every word means something. They mean life. Use them all up and it's over. So there's nothing I hate more than wasting words on scabs and stooges. But the guy wasn't talking. He just shivered and shook his head and whimpered. Like a whipped dog.

I ripped off the tip of his nose. That usually starts a conversation.

And he howled and he howled. But no actual words. No talking. There was blood pouring down into his mouth and he was spitting it out and choking and his eyes were full of tears, but still...he didn't say anything.

That was frustrating. I almost swore at him. But again, he wasn't worth it. So I waited until he'd stopped howling and was looking up at me and I raised my eyebrows. Real meaningful. Like *Hey, you can tell you, boss*. But nothing. He just kept sitting there, crying and bleeding.

So I ripped off most of his left ear. 

That's always a little unpleasant to look at, so I had to take second and let things settle down. I stuck my head out of the shed and took a deep breath. When I came back I was certain my man was ready to talk.

But no. Just weeping and blubbering.

""Just *tell* me, you stupid jackass!"" I hollered. And yeah, I was mad enough to start wasting adjectives. This was serious. I grabbed at his right ear. He shook his head and looked down, shook his head and looked down. 

""Mmmm,"" I said, which I found out a long time ago is not a word and doesn't count against your numbers. ""Mmmmm."" It was the *You've given me an idea* sound. The man relaxed, which either meant he thought ""Mmmmm"" meant something else entirely or he'd really whiffed on guessing my idea. He got way less relaxed in a hurry when I pulled down his pants and grabbed his dick with the pliers. I did the eyebrow raise thing again. My eyebrows can be very meaningful.

The man opened his mouth and said, ""Fuck."" Just that. ""Fuck."" And then he died. Slumped over. Done. Lights out. I checked his pulse and everything. Nothing.

*Heart attack?* I wondered. I mean, getting your dick snapped off with pliers isn't *good* for your heart, but I'd seen plenty of doughier stooges take worse. 

Whatever it was, it meant I wasn't getting paid. Aggravated, I dumped the pliers in a bucket and reached to pull the guy's pants back up. I felt something crumple in the pocket and pulled out a slip of paper. It was the guy's monthly word count. I'd never seen anything like it. It said he only had one word left. 

*One word left.*

One word left in his life and it had been ""Fuck"". Well, there were certainly worse choices, I suppose.

I felt a little guilty, of course. He probably would have been happy to write his answers down, had he been given the choice, but I always feel like making a guy *talk* really filters out a lot of the stalling and the bullshit. Plus, people are always making off with my good pens. It's a real pain in the ass. 

Anyway, there wasn't much left to do, except take care of the body and I decided to give him a good burial. It was the least I could do. After all, I'd made the man choose between his dick and his life.

___________________________________________________________________

Clay and Becker were throwing an iron ball back and forth in a half-lit room. In the gloom, there were visible traces of blue and green light sparking off their fingertips and palms as they caught and threw the ball, harder and harder. Clay knew full well they were being pitted against in each other in a way. Becker was further along in every regard and the farm boy delighted in whipping the metal orb as hard as possible and watching as Clay winced and staggered, corralling the ball in both hands to deaden the impact. But that was fine. Clay could take the hit to his ego, as long as it gave the pair a chance to talk in private.

""We need to talk to Tania,"" said Clay, shaking out his hands as Becker wound up another pitch. ""We need to know what they told her.""

""The kidnappers?"" snorted Becker. ""Who cares? Lies, lies, and more lies, I bet.""

""Don't you want to at least *hear* what the other side is saying? Did you see the way she looked at us? She wanted to rip our friggin' heads off. We were two teenage boys taking *machine gun fire* in an orphanage and she didn't hesitate one second to karate kick both of us in the chest.""

""Brainwashed maybe?"" said Becker, rifling another shot straight into Clay's abdomen. ""Collier and them know best.""

Clay flinched slightly at the name. ""Why won't they tell us what happened to Ellen? How did that whole team come back and not Ellen? Not the unkillable missing link? You're not suspicious?""

Becker sighed, stabbing Clay's throw out of the air nonchalantly. ""Yeah, I'd *like* to know more. But... you know? What are we supposed to do about it? They tell us what they tell us and that's that. I like to suppose there's a good reason for it.""

""Yeah, but what if that reason isn't good for *us*?"" said Clay. ""I mean, it sure as shit felt like we kidnapped Tania. And now Ellen's gone and no one will say what happened. What does that mean for you and me? What does it mean for any of the other kids out there with the same...condition?""

Becker dropped the ball on the ground. ""Don't know. You need to do something about it - go for it. I won't stop you. But I'm not one for shaking the boat, so you're on your own.""

They left the empty exercise room and parted ways in the hallway, Becker heading towards the kitchen and Clay walking towards the row of little offices that lined the exit hallway. As always, the steel exit door was locked, but the offices were open. Clay crept inside each in turn, holding out a vain hope that he might find *something* - some scrap of paper, some faded lines on a whiteboard. All were clean and bare. Old furniture, empty desks, and unused trash cans. Clay stepped out of the last office and ran headfirst into Rory.

""What are you doing?"" he asked, stepping around Clay to look into the office.

""Nothing,"" said Clay, reflexively. Then something sparked within him. ""No. I'm trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Where's Ellen? What are you doing with Tania?""

Rory considered the boy for a moment. He took a deep breath. ""Tania isn't safe to be around right now. So she's being quarantined until we can come to a better understanding. You'd be smart to not push it where that's concerned.""

""And Ellen?"" pressed Clay.

Rory's eyes narrowed. ""She's been moved to another location. Don't expect to see her again.""

It didn't seem like a complete answer, but it was better than what he'd expected, so Clay nodded. ""The headaches? I know I've told one of the techs, but it's really bad today and I...""

""Hang tight,"" said Rory. ""We'll get you something for the headaches.""

""Are they... are they related to my powers, do you think?""

""Don't worry about it,"" said Rory, turning on his heel. ""We'll get you something. In the meantime, stay in your approved zones *only*.""

Soon after, Collier arrived, dragging both Clay and Becker back to the exercise room, where a pair of treadmills had been set-up side by side. 

""Run,"" said Collier, after both had changed into running shorts and new shirts. ""Run until I say stop.""

Becker nearly collapsed after fifteen minutes and was told to go sit in the corner. Clay had ran track in school, though, so he reveled in the challenge and the exercise. Collier stopped him long before Clay's body had even considered giving out.

""Blood samples,"" said Collier, retrieving a metal briefcase and removing the necessary paraphernalia. 

""Don't think... don't think I'm up for it,"" huffed Becker, still pink and white all over. 

""You'll be fine,"" said Collier dryly, wrenching Becker's arm into position and tying a quick tourniquet. With practiced speed, he dipped the needle into Becker's pasty arm. A mere second into the draw, Becker collapsed full force into Collier's lap, knocking both out of their chairs and onto the floor. 

""Christ!"" howled Collier, dragging the boy up to a sitting position. 

""Wha? What? What happened?"" muttered Becker, eyes fluttering.

""You're a mess, Becker,"" said Collier, finishing the draw. ""I'll leave the treadmills. Work on your cardio.""

""Right. Okay,"" mumbled Becker.

Clay's sample went off without a hitch. Collier took his leave immediately.

""That was hard to watch,"" said Clay, patting Becker on the back. ""I thought you farm boys were in better shape than that.""

""Oh, I'm fine as fine can be,"" said Becker. ""I just hate running.""

Clay frowned. ""So, the nosedive into Collier's crotch?""

Becker smiled, holding up a jingling set of keys. ""Don't say I never did anything for you.""

""Really?"" said Clay, reaching for the keys. 

""Just don't go pointing fingers my way if you get caught,"" said Becker. ""Truthfully, I *am* worried about Ellen. And I don't know why, but I think something bad happened to her - no matter what they say. So go get us some answers, alright?""

Clay nodded. ""I'll try.""

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Collier came back, as Clay suspected he would. He searched both boys. He searched their rooms. He just about tore the TV room apart. But he didn't look inside the treadmill.

An hour or two after Clay and Becker were ordered to bed, Clay slipped out of his bunk and retrieved the keys from the exercise room. 

What would they do if they found him? he wondered. Would they punish him? *Could* they punish him? He was pretty certain they would find a way. But it didn't matter. Things had gone too far. Callie had been shot. Ellen had disappeared. And now this Tania girl was locked somewhere in the complex, obviously against her will. Even if these were the ""good guys"", Clay couldn't pretend they were doing things the right way. 

The corridors were quiet. Clay had no idea if there were guards or if anyone patrolled the halls at night. He would just have to be cautious.

The heavy, steel double-doors on the other side of the exercise room groaned and squealed as Clay slowly pushed them open. Clay froze, listening to the sound echoing down the empty, concrete hallway. No one came. No voices. Not yet. He moved forward, past more empty rooms. What had this place been before? Clay battered back his natural curiosity. There wasn't time for all the answers. 

As he walked along the corridor, something caught his attention. A smell. Something burnt. Carbon. And something beneath that - a smell like bacon grease. Cooked flesh. But old. Washed all over with dust and soot. 

It was such an odd smell. It seemed to have no place in that concrete hallway, and yet it only got stronger as Clay continued forward.

There was a door, crooked and broken, sagging in its doorframe. Clay pushed past it into a room. It was another concrete cell, but this one was different. This one was seared and stained in black blast marks. The floor was cracked. One of the walls looked as though a car had smashed into it.

It was like a bomb had gone off in that room. But then there was that smell. That burnt flesh smell. Hot oil. As if it were embedded in the walls. Because clearly the room had been cleaned, and what remained simply could not be washed away.

*Footsteps*.

Clay pulled the crooked door closed and sank to the floor, listening to the steps as they paced down the hall, towards the bomb-blasted room. Clay held his breath. But then on went the steps, past the room, down the hall, and out of hearing range. 

Clay pulled himself to his feet. There was black on his hands. Black on his shorts. A sort of dust. More questions without answers. He stepped out of the room and continued down the hall.

He reached a fork. His hallway ended, transected by a new hallway. Right or left? To the right he heard voices. Murmuring discussion. Reams of paper slapping against the floor. Chairs shuffling. To the left...nothing.

He went left. 

The hallway curved. The lights were dimmer there - multiple bulbs broken or dead and not replaced. It felt like he was descending into the earth. Into the underworld. 

The hallway ended. There were two rooms, both barricaded with dense steel doors. Clay hesitated. He didn't know what was behind those doors. Or who. But that ring of keys was the only tool he had. If he wanted answers, he had to start opening doors. 

He picked the one of the right and found the key on the fourth try. 

Another concrete chamber. This one streaked in blood. 

Clay was so fascinated and horrified by all the blood he hardly noticed the girl lying in a heap in the corner. It was Tania York. Hauntingly yellow and gray at the lips. Her hands were raw webs of pulp, caked from wrist to fingertip in red and black blood.

Clay hovered uncertainly over the girl, touching her shoulder with his fingers. 

""Hey? Hey? Tania? Wake up.""

The girl's eyes opened. She threw herself forward, swinging a wild punch that clipped Clay in the left temple. It hardly felt like anything. The girl collapsed immediately, the effort of the swing throwing her face first onto the concrete. 

Clay picked her up and turned her over. ""What the hell happened to you?"" he whispered. Then he looked at the walls and the girl's hands and he realized what she'd done. But how had she done such damage to herself and so little damage to the room? Even Clay, who hardly had any idea what he was doing, felt like he could confidently punch a notch into a concrete wall. And this girl had once punted him like a football.

""Fuck you,"" she hissed through a mouth that barely seemed able to open.

""I'm not your enemy,"" said Clay. ""I'm the same as you. They did... they did the same stuff to me.""

""So why'd you kidnap me?"" she said, wincing as she pulled out of Clay's grasp and sat up on her own.

""*Rescued* you,"" said Clay, knowing full well he couldn't prove that in any meaningful way. ""Or maybe not. I don't know. How long... how long have you known? About your powers?""

""Less than a month,"" said Tania, still eyeing Clay warily. ""Some men came to the orphanage. A doctor and a man with a glass eye. They explained things. Said they were afraid someone might come after me."" She held out her hands. ""And I guess they weren't kidding.""

Clay nodded at the girl's outstretched hands. ""Why did you do that? To your hands?""

""It's called trying to escape,"" she said. ""And doing a really shitty job of it. They put me back on the shots. I know they did. That's why I can't..."" She took a deep breath. ""What are you doing in here?"" Suddenly she noticed the still open door. ""Oh *shit*!""

Tania hobbled to her feet and made for the open door. Clay raced past her and pushed the door closed as quickly and quietly as he could manage. Then he pressed his back against the door.

""I can't let you out,"" he said. To which Tania replied with a punch to the face. Again, it hardly registered. Tania was clearly strong - probably stronger than Clay in all likelihood - but without her powers, there wasn't much she could do to move the boy.  

""I just need some answers,"" said Clay. ""I don't know what's really going on and I don't know who to trust. So I need you to calm down and *talk to me*.""

Tania frowned, then nodded. Then punched Clay twice more. Then nodded and sat down.

""Fine. What?""

Clay took a deep breath and told her his story. He explained what Rory had said that first day and what Bridger had said later on the farm. He told her about his trip back home, about the black-suited men that had swarmed the house, and about Rory shooting Callie. He told her about the mission to ""retrieve"" her and about Ellen driving away in a separate van, never to be seen again.

""So this is what I'm told,"" he said. ""That my DNA was scrambled or something before I was born. That *someone* wanted to do *something* with me and everyone else like me, but then they didn't, for whatever reason, so I was given to a foster family who raised me as their own, who poisoned me every single day, until the point someone was going to come and retrieve me, for..."" Clay shrugged. ""So Rory rescued me to take me out into the woods to train, but now... I just have no idea. And no one wants to answer anything.""

Tania sighed. For the first time since she'd woken up, she seemed slightly relaxed. Or at least not a split-second away from delivering another punch. 

""Well, that's similar to what I was told,"" she said. ""The doctor's name is Berrymore. The other man is Kurtz. Kurtz was the head of a research program. Something similar to what that Bridger guy told you. About the hidden DNA. Only they saw it as like a cheat code in an old video game. Something clever people were supposed to exploit once they figured it out. The program shut down, though, and the babies were distributed to families for safekeeping. Nothing more. At least according to those guys. We were never supposed to know, but then one of us got kidnapped and now..."" Tania laughed. ""Now we're kidnapping each other, I guess.""

""Did you believe them?"" asked Clay. 

""Some,"" said Tania. ""Parts of it were a lie, I could tell. Parts of it were true. Which was which? I don't know. But Kurtz told me to stop taking my insulin in case someone did come. And he set all those guards at St. Catherine's. Didn't go for much, did it?""

Clay rubbed his eyes. He was suddenly so, so tired. How late was it? 

""I was so upset,"" he said after a time. ""So upset about the lies. That's why I went. With Rory, I mean. That they could have lied to me for so long. I felt so betrayed. And now... I don't know. I don't know if it was a bad thing to do. Everything else was fine. And then Callie got shot... she was just trying to protect me. And I don't even know... if she's still alive or...""

Clay was surprised to find that he was crying. 

""So what do we do now?"" said Tania. 

Clay wiped his eyes and pulled himself up to his feet. He stepped back from the door. ""We run, I think. Until we figure out who's good and who's bad, I think we run.""

Whether or not Tania thought that was a good idea, she did not say. Instead, she simply walked forward and pulled the door open.

Collier was there, holding a gun and a canister of mace. ""Oh good,"" he said. ""You found my keys.""

The concrete walls thrummed with a series of dull reverberations and muffled screams. A girl's voice. Howling somewhere in the complex. Over and over, the *WHOOMP* *WHOOMP* *WHOOMP* of deadened explosions. And through it all, Becker snored, a single foot lolling lifelessly over the edge of the top bunk. Clay watched the foot bobbing up and down in time with the snores, his irritation and jealousy growing with every breath.

Finally, he snapped. 

""Knock it the fuck off!"" he bellowed, kicking savagely at the exposed springs over his bed. In the dark he thought he could see something like blue-green vapor trails extending from his thrusting feet. Becker's weight left the bed for only a moment - the springs above fully relaxed as if no one had ever been there - then the boy came crashing back down with a bang and a maelstrom of corny, mid-western curse words.

""Hopping Holly, what the Jiminny Cricket was that all about?"" A round, bottle brush head hung over the rails, tiny hamster eyes twitching in the dark.

""How the hell can you sleep?"" said Clay. ""Can't you hear that?""

Becker frowned, screwing up his face. ""That? That's Ellen. She's just coping is all.""

""*Coping*?"" said Clay. ""She sounds like she's trying to bring the whole building down.""

""It's an upsetting thing,"" said Becker. That was how he talked to Clay - like he'd been in the shit for a lifetime and a half and now he was passing on his hard-earned wisdom. The truth was, he'd been picked by Collier's team a day before Rory had snagged Clay. He knew exactly jack and shit. ""Way I hear it, she didn't go willingly. So, she's still working through some things.""

""You mean they kidnapped her?"" 

""I suppose, if kidnapping from a kidnapper is still kidnapping, you know?"" Becker smiled, a little lowercase ""u"" at the bottom of an 18 inch pizza face. ""We need to sleep. Big day tomorrow.""

""Right,"" said Clay, rolling onto his side. The walls still thrummed, but he closed his eyes anyway. It wasn't like he had any better options.

It was morning when a man came to the door and escorted the boys out to a table, where a big pile of bacon and eggs were sitting. The complex was underground, so when it came to the time of day, Clay had to take everyone's word for it. 

""Is Ellen coming?"" he asked the escort. He was a tall, blank-faced man who'd never bothered introducing himself. The man just just shook his head and walked off.

""More for us,"" said Becker, lifting strips of bacon straight from the pile to his mouth. ""Hey, Clay. Did I show you this yet?""

Becker wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, then stood up from the table. He grabbed a coffee cup from next to the coffee maker and set it on the ground, then pulled his right hand into a fist. He squeezed his hand and pointed downward at the coffee cup, then pulled back his arm, puffed out his cheeks, and drove down his fist - but only three or four inches. 

The coffee cup exploded, like it had been run over by a car.

Becker wiped the sweat off his forehead and held out his hands. Clay was nose-deep in a mound of scrambled eggs. 

""Yeah. Seen it. Neat,"" he mumbled. ""I hope that wasn't Rory's coffee cup.""

Becker's face fell. ""Sugar,"" he hissed, bending down to sweep the dusty shards of ceramics into his hand. 

""Stop destroying the goddamn coffee cups, Becker,"" said Blackman, sweeping past on his way to the coffee maker. 

""Yup, sorry,"" gulped Becker. ""Accident.""

Blackman was a broad-shouldered man with prominent red-gray bags under his eyes and a thin, salt-and-pepper mustache. Clay had no idea what he did or what his title was. In truth, he had no idea what most anyone at the complex did. And no one seemed all that keen to tell him.

""How's your health?"" said Blackman, staring pointedly at Clay as he poured himself a mug of coffee.

""Fine,"" said Clay. Which was a stretch. He'd felt like death back at his parents' house, and whatever Callie had shot him up with - insulin or poison - it had clearly made him feel better. Now he was trending back downward, though he didn't feel comfortable admitting it.

""Good,"" said Blackman, turning to leave. ""Keep it that way. We leave in an hour.""

""Sir,"" said Clay. ""Are we... is anyone going to brief us on what's happening today? Give us some details?""

Blackman stared at Clay a moment, quietly appraising the boy, punishing him silently for asking questions. ""No. There's nothing you need to know. We'll handle everything, including your instructions once we arrive. There's no planning or preparation necessary for you. Just do as you're told and everything will be fine.""

Clay swallowed and nodded. ""Right.""

""I don't really like him,"" admitted Becker, after Blackman was long gone. 

""I don't think you're supposed to,"" said Clay. 

An hour later, Rory came to retrieve the pair from the makeshift rec room. ""Mouths shut, ears open,"" he grunted as he waved both boys up from the couch. ""When you need to act, you will be told what to do. Until then, sit quietly and wait.""

They took an elevator up to the garage level, where two gray vans were idling side by side. Rory motioned towards the first van, but as Clay took a step up he saw the elevator open once more and Ellen step out, surrounded by Collier and two other men. 

Ellen was small - she *looked* younger than Clay and Becker, though she was supposedly the same age. She had thin limbs and straight, black, weightless hair that hung like cheap fabric. Her face was flushed and sweaty. Her arms were wrapped tight across her abdomen. She looked like she was going to vomit at any moment.

""What are they doing with Ellen?"" asked Clay, stepping back off the van. But Rory grabbed him by the belt and pushed him forward. 

""Not your concern,"" said Rory, waving Becker in behind Clay. 

Clay grabbed a seat by the tinted windows and watched as Ellen was loaded into the second van. Becker leaned over his lap to get a look. 

""Wow. She looks like death warmed over,"" said Becker. 

""Shut up,"" said Rory, slamming the door shut. There were three other men in the van. None seemed especially talkative, so Clay just sat and watched as Ellen's limp body was strapped into her seat.

""She comin' with us, you think?"" whispered Becker.

Clay shrugged. Why were they bringing her *anywhere*? She looked like she needed medical assistance. Could they be bringing her to a hospital? It seemed unlikely. 

The vans pulled out of the garage and followed each other to the highway. After about two hours, the second van pulled off onto an exit. 

""So, *not* going with us,"" murmured Becker lowly.

Clay's van pulled off shortly afterward. They were in the suburbs. Someplace quiet and sparse. Clay felt the two men sitting behind him shifting around in their seats. He chanced a casual look back and saw both were brandishing assault rifles. 

The van rolled to a stop. They were on a residential street directly across from a sloping grass lot, leading up to an enormous three level home. 

""Fancy,"" said Becker.

""It's an orphanage,"" said Rory. Clay looked back and realized that the two men with assault rifles had disappeared. ""St. Catherine's Home for Girls.""

""Orphans!"" said Becker brightly. ""Like us."" He nudged Clay in the ribs. Clay moved away.

""Tania York,"" said Rory. ""You two go up there, knock on the door, and ask for Tania York.""

""What's that?"" said Becker.

""You're sending us in there to get her?"" said Clay.

""No, I'm sending you up there to ask for Tania York,"" said Rory. ""That's it. We'll cover the rest.""

Clay and Becker exchanged uncomfortable glances. ""That's it?"" said Clay.

""Go!"" shouted Rory, pointing towards the mansion on the hill. Clay and Becker set off up the grass.

""What do you figure this is all about?"" said Becker, huffing and puffing almost immediately. 

""Honestly?"" said Clay. ""I think we're decoys. In case they cracked Bridger's laptop or he talked and this operation's already blown.""

Becker's face fell. ""Well, I can't say I'm excited about that.""

They reached the door. Clay knocked, sensing accurately that Becker wasn't about to offer. After a minute or so, the door swung open. An old woman wearing a wide, wooden cross around her neck stepped out.

""Yes? How can I help you?""

""We need to speak with Tania York,"" said Clay evenly. His heart was racing again. He felt that now familiar tingling in his fingertips. He could see Becker sweating profusely out of the corner of his eye.

""Tania?"" said the old woman, rolling the name around on her tongue. ""Tania *York* you said?""

Both boys nodded. 

""I'm forgetful,"" said the old woman. ""I'll go ask. First, though, what's your business with this Tania?""

They froze. Clay turned to Becker, blinking, hoping to coax something useful out of the doughy midwesterner. ""School,"" said Becker. ""School. Class project. So... school. It's a school thing."" 

Clay had to step on Becker's foot to get him to stop. 

""Ah. Certainly,"" said the old woman. ""You hang on a moment. I'll go check.""

The door closed. Becker let out a sigh. ""Whew!"" he hissed. He turned back towards the van. ""You think we can leave now?""

But then the door swung right back open. ""Follow me,"" said the old woman, so sudden and unexpected both boys nearly jumped off the landing. 

""Uh,"" said Becker. They could not see the van or Rory. 

""Come on,"" beckoned the old woman. ""Tania's waiting.""

Clay and Becker made eye contact. Neither had any idea what the right thing to do was, so Becker went through the door and Clay followed him. The door slammed shut behind them. Clay thought he heard an electronic buzz and then a series of loud clicks. 

""Up the stairs,"" said the old woman. The boys followed her wearily. Three steps up the stairs and something occurred to Clay.

""Where is everyone?"" he asked. ""Seems very quiet.""

""School,"" said the old woman flatly. ""Most are in school.""

Clay stopped. They shouldn't have gone in. That was desperately obvious. ""Becker?"" he said, just as a trio of men swooped around the base of the stairs and sighted up a trio of rifles.

""Shit!"" shouted Clay as the rifles flashed. Not bullets, though. The darts deflected off Clay's arms and legs. Men appeared at the top of the stairs, pulling the pins on gas canisters and flash grenades. Becker screamed as he punched a crater through the center of the stairs, dumping Clay, Becker, and the old woman down into the floor below. 

Clay pulled himself out of the rubble. The old woman was moaning nearby. Becker was already up to his feet. ""We need to get out of here!"" he said.

""No shit,"" said Clay. ""Can you punch us out of here?""

""Maybe?"" said Becker. ""But what about you?""

""I don't know how to control it like you,"" said Clay. The room was filling up with smoke. ""Let's just *go*!""

Someone above began to spray machine gun fire down through the hole. It pummeled Clay like hailstones - annoying and brutal, but far from fatal. Becker roared and battered his way through the near wall, which lead into a pantry. The machine gun fire followed them, peppering Clay's back like a swarm of hornets. Furious, Clay picked up a can of creamed corn and whipped it up through the hole. It connected with a distressingly loud, fleshy *CRACK*. The machine gun fire stopped. Clay couldn't see clearly enough in the gathering smoke to know what had happened. He hoped he'd only knocked the guy out. 

Becker had just reared back to open another doorway when something, somewhere exploded. The resulting shockwave knocked every single non-perishable in the pantry off the shelf and put both Clay and Becker on the ground.

""What the fuck was that?"" said Clay, grasping at his ringing ears.

""Hear that?"" said Becker, blinking through the smoke. ""Electric's out. All of it. Might of have been a power plant or...""

The door to the pantry whipped open. A girl was standing there, dark skinned and full of rage. She threw a straight kick square into Clay's chest, blasting him backwards through the half-toppled wall. Dimly, Clay could hear more gunfire in the near distance as he crashed down in a heap of drywall and ragged wooden beams. Looking up, he saw another figure flying overhead. A half-second later, Becker had landed with an equally impressive thud.

Struggling to his elbows, Clay saw the girl standing in the shadows of the open door. Then there was a figure behind her, cradling her neck in one arm, while pressing a hand against her face. The girl bucked like a bull, then slumped to the floor. The figure stomped forward, grabbing Clay by the wrist. Only then did he realize it was Rory. 

""Did I say, 'Go in the fucking house'?"" he growled. ""Jesus."" Then he pushed the boy away and went to retrieve Becker. Clay staggered out of the debris and looked down at the girl. Another one. And she'd fought against them. 

""Are we taking her?"" he asked, his voice garbled with smoke and soot.

Rory had Becker over his arm. ""No, we just drove all the way out here to fuck up an orphanage for no reason. Pick her up. We need to go.""

Clay did as he was told. He helped kidnap the girl. Tania York. Somewhere in the ruined house he could still hear the old woman moaning, but he knew it was pointless to say anything, so he lifted the girl in his arms and made his way slowly back to the van.

The explosion knocked all four of them on their asses. Chester howled as he raced away, up the stairs. 

Clay dove towards the backdoor. One of the men grabbed him by the ankle and pulled the boy back to the floor. Callie was screaming nearby. Clay's ears still rang from blast.

*It must have been the cars out on the street,* he realized. And if that were true...

Two bullets whizzed through the bay windows adjacent to the living room. One each for the black-suited men, who both slumped flat immediately. 

Clay rose cautiously to his feet. He held out a hand for Callie, who was too busy staring at the two dead men to notice.

""Cal, c'mon!"" he yelled. His voice sounded muffled in his own ears. ""We have to go.""

Then Rory was there, ripping open the backdoor and pushing past Clay, handgun out and at the ready. ""Is there anyone else in the house?"" he barked.

""Just us,"" said Clay. ""And my dog.""

""You're an idiot,"" he sighed, grabbing Clay by the shoulder. ""We need to get out of here.""

""Come on,"" said Clay, reaching down for Callie's hands. ""We have to go.""

""Whoa,"" said Rory, yanking Clay to the side. ""Not her. She's with them.""

""What?"" said Callie, slowly starting to return to herself. ""What's happening? Who *are* you? Who are these..."" She seemed to remember that she was sitting less than a yard away from two dead bodies and scooted up to her feet. ""Clay! What the *fuck* is going on?""

""Mom and Dad are..."" Clay trailed off. ""I don't know what they are, exactly. But they've been lying to us for years. They've been lying to *me* and shooting me up with poison.""

""*Poison*?"" Callie looked at the spent insulin injection lying on the counter. ""It's insulin, Clay. You need it for your diabetes.""

""It's poison,"" said Clay. ""I don't have time to explain it all right now, but we need to..."" 

""Clay, I *gave* you a shot just a little while ago,"" said Callie, calm, but firm. ""You feel better now, don't you?""

He did. He did feel better. He'd felt like he was falling apart just ten minutes ago and now...

""It's complicated,"" said Clay. ""We need to...""

""She's not coming,"" said Rory. ""And we need to go. Now.""

""No!"" said Callie, reaching out and grabbing her brother's hand. ""Who the fuck *are* you? Leave my brother alone.""

Then Rory pulled out his gun and Clay briefly entertained the thought that Callie was like him and that she was about to find out the same way he had. But then Rory pulled the trigger and  a hole burst through Callie's shoulder and blood splattered the kitchen, misting Clay's face. 

Clay tried to reach out his sister, who was plummeting backwards, but Rory had a hold of his shirt and was yanking the boy backwards through the door.

What was he doing? That was his *sister*. His sister. *His sister.*

Was Rory really the good guy? Is that how good guys got things done in the real world? Clay didn't know. Clay didn't think he knew anything. But he saw his sister bleeding and falling, white-faced and afraid. And Clay screamed and pushed Rory away.

And Rory *flew*.

Clay watched, transfixed, as the man sped away, backwards, through the air, stopping only when he crashed into the wooden fence, bringing the whole thing down in the process. Then he tried to turn and help his sister, but his legs gave out and he vomited, pitching forward, face-first onto the backstairs.

He woke up in a car. The Charger. Rory was driving, teeth gritted, a steady string of swear words tumbling out of his mouth with every sudden jerk of the steering wheel. 

""You fucking idiot,"" he hissed when he saw Clay's eyes open. ""You fucking stupid idiot. Do you have *any idea* how stupid you are?""

""Callie?"" said Clay.

""She'll live,"" said Rory. ""They swarmed the fucking house. We barely made it out.""

There was a *crack* in the near distance, as if to emphasize the point. Clay sat up to look around. Rory reached out and pushed his head down. ""Don't,"" he said. ""I don't know what happened back there, but I'm not confident you can take a bullet right now.""

There was another *crack* and another. Rory whipped through the highway traffic like he was in a parking lot and everyone else was standing still. Clay's head throbbed. His hands shook. He felt sicker than he'd ever felt. Like a flu times ten. His body wanted to retch, but Clay pushed away the request. 

He kept seeing Callie - covered in blood and falling, falling, falling. 

She hadn't known. He believed that. Whatever was happening, she wasn't a part of it. 

And Rory had shot her.

""Who do you work for?"" asked Clay, breathing deep and slow through his nostrils.

""Now's not the time for questions you know I'm not about to answer,"" said Rory.

""What do you want with me?""

""Keep you safe. Keep you alive.""

""I *was* safe,"" said Clay. ""I was fine. I had a life. No one was trying to hurt me. No one was trying to hurt my *family*.""

""Not your family,"" said Rory. ""Your handlers. Your zookeepers. You are a science experiment. They were watching you. What do you think people do with science experiments once they've learned all there is to learn?""

Clay shook his head. ""Why won't you say who you work for? You go out to meet people. There are others. It's not just you and Bridger. And there are more... more like me. What's happening to them? Are you kidnapping them, too?""

""Did you see the men with *guns*, kid?"" said Rory. ""The swarm of assholes surrounding that house? No one goes to that kind of trouble for your average, everyday missing orphan. I don't *know* what they might have someday thought to do with you, but based on everything else they've done, I've got to guess it wouldn't be too nice.""

Clay sighed, dropping his head between his knees. It helped a little with the nausea. ""What now?""

""Back to training. Back to testing. We help you figure yourself out and then... yes, we start going after some of the others. The experiments. The other kids like you.""

They drove in silence. Somewhere along the way, Rory had managed to lose whoever it was that had been chasing them. They doubled back. They blazed down side roads and country lanes, then back up onto the highway. They drove for the better part of the day. All in the name of caution.

Finally they returned to the countryside and the long, winding lane that led up to the farmhouse. And they saw yellowish smoke in the distance. Rory slammed on the brakes and turned around.

""What?"" said Clay.

""Fuck,"" cursed Rory. ""How'd you get back to your parent's house?""

""Bus.""

""You pay cash?""

""No,"" said Clay. ""I uh...I used the emergency credit card my parents gave me.""

Rory shook his head. ""That smoke. There's powder in the chimney. Makes that color. Triggered by someone breaking down the backdoor. The house is compromised. We can't go back.""

If it were possible for Clay to feel any worse, he would have. ""Bridger?""

""We have to assume he's dead,"" said Rory. He clenched his fists. ""Okay. This just accelerates things. I'll take you to meet the team. We have to assume they cracked Bridger's laptop, so...""

""So?"" said Clay.

""So, it's just about time to go to war,"" said Rory.

Clay squeezed the cotton swab against his forearm as Bridger capped the vial of blood and walked it to a metal briefcase on the other side of the room.

""What have you learned so far?"" asked Clay, bracing himself for the inevitable non-answer.

Bridger snapped the briefcase shut. ""That *you* are super brave! Yes you are!""

""I'm really starting to hate you,"" sighed Clay, hoping off the stool. 

""Sorry,"" said Bridger with a smile. ""Nothing I'm allowed to tell you yet. But it's all good stuff. We *are* learning things. Don't think we're all just sitting around with our dicks out.""

""Well can you at least tell me this - if my skin won't let a bullet through, how come you can draw a blood sample? How come my parents...""

""*Not* your parents,"" said Bridger sternly. 

""How come they could give me those shots for all those years? I don't get it.""

""Well, *that* I can explain. Broadly."" Bridger rolled up his sleeve and held out his arm. ""Touch the skin on my arm.""

Clay frowned, but touched the man's arm. ""Now touch your own arm. Notice anything different?""

Clay shrugged. ""Honestly, no.""

""Yeah,"" said Bridger. ""No. You have normal skin. You don't have bulletproof skin, whatever that might look like.""

""Then how come?""

""How come bullets don't kill you? Well, it's not about your skin. It's about something deeper than that. I haven't exactly figured out how it works yet or what it *is*, really, but to me - and don't tell Rory I told you this - to *me* it seems as though you have some sort of in-built defense mechanism. I think you generate some sort of extra-human *energy*, which protects you from harm. Whatever it is, it reacts independent of thought - or, at least, faster than thought. I really don't know how to describe it properly because I still haven't wrapped my head around it. But I think it's important to know that those shots your handlers were giving you all those years - they suppressed your powers by giving this internal defense mechanism something *else* to focus on; namely, keeping you alive.""

""Meaning...?""

""Meaning they were just poisoning you, Clay,"" said Bridger. ""Those so-called insulin shots would have killed anyone else dead in a single dose. Your extra-human energy never manifested in any noticeable ways because it was always too busy trying to keep you alive. Pretty interesting, right?""

Clay felt sick to his stomach, as if he'd just consumed another variety of poison. ""Sure,"" he murmured. ""Interesting.""

That tidbit was the final straw. Clay had toyed with the idea as soon as he had learned that Rory would be leaving for a meeting. But now he knew he was going to do it.

He was going to go back home and confront his parents.

It had to be face-to-face. Clay had stolen Rory's phone within the first few days of arriving at the farm and tried so hard to make the call, but he just couldn't. It had to be face-to-face. He had to *see* them. He had to hear it from their mouths.

Of course, Rory would be pissed. The man watched Clay like a hawk. This trip was the only real chance the boy would get. Rory was gone for a day and Bridger slept like the dead. Clay could steal out after dark and hitch a ride to the bus station he'd seen on the way up to the farm. Rory would come after him, obviously, so time was of the essence. Just a few hours. Just enough time to hear what they had to say for themselves. Just enough time to see if *any* of it had ever been real.

The first steps were the easiest ones. Clay snuck out of the farmhouse at 10pm and made for the main road. After twenty minutes of walking with his thumb out, he managed to grab a ride with a security guard heading in for the late shift. The security guard fashioned himself a prophet among men and asked Clay about his relationship with Christ. Clay admitted it had been a little strained recently.

""Give yourself over to Him,"" said the security guard with a wide smile. ""God knows the way. He knows what to do. After all, He made you. And He plotted out your whole life. All the good and all the bad.""

""So that's who I should blame?"" Clay said it as a joke and the man laughed, but it was clear neither thought it was very funny.

At the bus station, Clay had to wait almost three hours for the next bus back to his hometown. He passed the time sitting on a bench, watching the main entrance, waiting for Rory to come storming in, cursing his name and shooting people in the head. But Rory didn't come. He was somewhere else and Bridger never woke up in the middle of the night. Clay got on his bus.

The ride took the rest of the night. It was early morning by the time Clay got ""home"". Disembarking the bus, he realized he hadn't been to his hometown bus station since they'd all gone to pick Callie up after her first semester of freshman year. She'd looked so unhappy, Clay remembered. And she never talked much in those days, so he couldn't be sure if she was unhappy to have left school or if she was unhappy knowing she had to go *back*. The mysteries of Callie.

Clay walked from the bus station to his house. He didn't want to risk running into anyone else while he was in town, so hitching was out of the question. It was fall. The weather was perfect for walking. And still Clay was slightly damp by the time he'd reached his street. Was that the exercise or the sun or his nerves? He wasn't sure.

His father's car was gone. His mother's car was still parked outside the garage. It had been a week and a half. Had they been looking for him? Was there a nationwide manhunt in progress? There wasn't a TV at the farmhouse and Rory had confiscated his phone. He wasn't even going to *attempt* to break into Bridger's laptop. So he had no idea. What had they done when they'd found him missing? Had they done anything at all?

Clay went to the back door. He hadn't brought his keys when he'd left with Rory, but there was a spare in the old birdhouse above the backstairs. He took a deep breath and then another. His hands were shaking so much he missed the keyhole on the first three tries. And only as the key sunk into the lock did he realize that his plan was over. No more pages. He had no idea what to do next. What if they said it wasn't true and he believed them? What if a hundred black-hooded government agents stormed through the front door? 

He'd have to wing it, he supposed.

He pushed the door open and stepped into the house.

It was quiet, still. The ceiling fan whirred and somewhere in the house a fire alarm battery was dying, *bipping* mournfully on a seven second cycle. Clay stepped through the kitchen and found Callie sitting on the couch.

""Clay!?!"" she half-screamed, leaping to her feet. ""What. The. *Fuck*? Where have you been? We've been worried half to death."" She plunged forward, hugging Clay tightly, which was a thing she hadn't done since they were pre-teens. ""What *happened*?""

""Where's Mom and Dad?"" asked Clay, stepping around his sister and peering into the living room. Chester barked and spun in circles. 

""Out,"" said Callie. ""Where did you go? We called the police and everything. Are you okay?""

""Yeah,"" said Clay absently, still stalking through the house, looking for what he couldn't say. 

""I'll call Mom,"" said Callie.

""No!"" shouted Clay. ""Not...not yet, okay? I need to ask a couple questions. Please don't call anyone right now.""

Callie reached for her phone. ""They've been worried sick. Of course I'm going to call them. They need to know you're...""

""No!"" shouted Clay, reaching to grab the phone. Neither got there. The phone flew sideways off the kitchen counter and smashed into the wall. 

""What the...?"" said Callie.

Clay was suddenly aware of how acutely uncomfortable he felt. He felt physically *wrong* somehow. Ill and strange and foreign.

""Am I adopted?"" he asked.

Callie laughed. ""What?""

""Did you see me born?""

Callie shook her head. ""Clay, you're my brother. Look at us. Don't be a weirdo. Why do you suddenly think you're adopted?""

""So you *saw* when I was a newborn?"" Clay braced himself against the counter. He felt like he might vomit, but there was nothing in his stomach. 

""Of course,"" said Callie. ""You're my little brother. I wasn't *at* the hospital, but I was here when they brought you home.""

""And you remember Mom being pregnant?""

Callie blinked. ""I...I guess. I don't know. I was like five years old, Clay. Vaguely, yeah. What's going on? What happened?""

""I don't know,"" said Clay, slumping down. ""I don't know what's going on."" Chester raced forward and started licking Clay's face. Callie darted towards the landline.

""I'm calling Mom and Dad,"" she said. ""You don't look good.""

Clay tried to pull himself to his feet and stop her, but he couldn't. It was like he had been momentarily buried in sand. His joints screamed. His head swam. ""Don't,"" he murmured. ""Don't call."" But he could see Callie on the phone, speaking lowly and urgently. Clay was afraid he might black out.

""They're coming,"" said Callie, kneeling down. ""Do you need some water? Oh Christ! Oh fuck. Have you been taking your insulin? Oh shit!"" She jumped to her feet. Clay reached out to stop her but she was long gone. Chester buried his soft, brown head into Clay's abdomen. 

*Oh God, am I insane?* he wondered. *What did I do? Why did I run away? I need my insulin...I need my insulin...*

And then Callie was back, sinking a needle into his side. ""Come on, Clay. Are you okay? Are you with me?"" Do I need to call an ambulance?""

""No,"" said Clay. ""No. I'm okay. Water?""

Callie brought him a glass. ""They'll be here soon,"" she said. She smiled. ""They said not to let you run away again.""

Clay's spine stiffened. ""What?""

Callie shook her head. ""Christ, don't look spooked. They said not to let you run away again. So stay put, mister. Take your time and then tell me where the hell you *went*.""

Clay was starting to feel better. Callie helped him up to his feet. ""You saw me when I was born? Mom was pregnant with me?""

""Yes. Of course. What the hell's gotten into you?""

Clay took a deep breath. ""I just...""

He heard the screech of a car slamming to a stop just outside their house and stomped to the front door. ""Who's that?""

There was a car across the street. Black. Tinted windows. The engine was running, but the doors remained closed. 

""How the hell should I know?"" said Callie. 

Another car pulled up behind it. Again - black, tinted windows. 

Clay pushed away from his sister and moved to the kitchen. He peered out the window. He could just make out a section of the cross-street on the opposite side of the fence. Another car pulled up - black, tinted windows, idling.

Clay looked at his hands and remembered the insulin shot. 

""Are you with them?"" he asked.

Callie frowned. ""What?""

""Are you part of it?""

""Part of *what*? What happened Clay? Why are you...?""

Clay grabbed his sister's hand. ""Please don't lie to me, Callie. Are you a part of this?""

Clay saw something in his sister's face just then - pain. And not the pain of a lie and not the pain of a plan falling apart; but the pain of watching a loved one unravel. The pain of helplessness. 

""I'm going to call an ambulance,"" said Callie. Her eyes were wet. ""Please, just sit down, okay? Sit down and I'm going to get you some help.""

""It's too late,"" said Clay. He squeezed his sister's hands. ""Take good care of Chester."" 

""What? Don't you dare...""

But Clay was already moving towards the back door. He wrenched it open only to find two black-suited men blocking the path. 

""Stay where you are,"" barked one of the men. They both had pistols drawn. 

""Or what?"" said Clay. ""You'll shoot me?""

The second man raised his gun and aimed it - at Callie. ""We'll shoot her, for starters.""

Clay swallowed and put his hands in the air.

_______________________________________________________________________________

The forest was cold and slick with early morning dew. Clay shivered as he weaved an uncertain path through the autumn pines. 

""This is pretty underwhelming,"" crackled a voice in his ear. Clay jumped and swatted at his earpiece. 

""I'm not falling for that,"" he whispered, dropping to a crouch.

""I'm not trying to psyche you out,"" said the voice. ""It's just an observation.""

""Well, how do you know how I'm..."" But Clay's words were cut off by the sizzling whistle of a bullet bursting against his left shoulder. Clay hissed as he looked down - his shoulder was coated in blue paint. ""Seriously?""

""That's one,"" said the man. ""Four more before you reach the target and I win. Show me something.""

""Show you my ass,"" grumbled Clay, getting to his feet. 

*Show him something*? Show him what? They had been at the farm for three days so far and Clay could hardly notice a difference. No super speed. No laser eyes. No wings bursting out of his back. Where was this godlike power he'd been promised?

At least he hadn't gone into hypoglycemic shock. So there was that.

He raced low through the tree cover, rubbing his temples as he ran. He tried to *see* the target - the yellow flag he'd been told was planted somewhere in the forest. But nothing. So... *not* telepathic. He was basically playing paintball without a paintball gun...and against a guy with a sniper rifle. 

*C'mon, special powers*, thought Clay. *Show yourself...NOW! Or how about...NOW! Or maybe right...FUCK!*

The second shot blasted Clay in the back of the head. It hurt. Of course, under normal circumstances it wouldn't feel like anything because Clay's brains would be splattered like a Halloween pumpkin on November 1st, but still...unpleasant was unpleasant. 

Frustrated, Clay howled and threw an awkward kick at a towering White Oak. The base of the tree cracked and split. The forest filled with the sound of grinding, grunting separation, as the oak unlocked itself from the ground and came tumbling laboriously towards the earth.

Clay shrieked and ran in utterly the wrong direction. 

Seconds later he was tackled by a goliath, thrown hard to the ground and pinned there. 

""You really have no survival instincts, do you?"" said the man through Clay's earpiece. 

""Guess...not,"" murmured Clay. ""This...kinda...sucks...""

""You'll live,"" sighed the man. ""I'll come and cut you out.""

An hour or so later, Clay was free and back on his feet. The man grabbed him by the shoulder and directed the pair back to the farmhouse.

""The kick was alright,"" said the man. ""Everything before and after was pretty garbage, though.""

""Maybe it was an old tree?"" said Clay.

""They're trees, dipshit. They're all old. That was definitely *something* though. We're gonna need to figure out how to channel that and then teach you how to actually fight.""

""What was wrong with that?"" said Clay. ""It got the job done.""

""Okay, well never minding the fact the *job* was not to kill an innocent goddamn tree, you kick like an eight year old. And not like a karate class eight year old; like an uncoordinated, can't-make-the-non-competitive-community-soccer-team eight year old. It was hard to watch.""

""Yeah. I see what you're saying.""

The man hadn't said much about the old farmhouse, but Clay had a growing sense it might be a family heirloom. That could at least explain why he was always watching Clay like a hawk, and barking at the littlest misplaced cereal bowl or dirty sneaker. 

The whole thing had been so weird and it was only in the those quiet moments when Clay was left to himself that he started wondering why he'd gone along with any of it. His parents...were his parents. He still couldn't disassociate that feeling and the bulk of his experiences as a human being. His parents had been his parents. And now he was supposed to act like they *weren't* his parents. Like Callie *wasn't* his sister. And no matter what his brain wanted to think, disowning his family went against how every little nerve and synapse was programmed. He couldn't get past that feeling of wrongness. He should be home. He should be with his parents. He at least needed to talk to them - to hear their side of it. 

He'd brought it up a few times, but the answer was always the same: ""You can't go back now. They'll be looking for you."" And it was clear that the *they* in question was not his parents.

But Clay couldn't let that lie. He had to see them. He had to hear their side of it. So he'd promised himself he would get away. When the moment was right, he'd go home and see his family. Whatever the consequences might be, he knew he couldn't live with himself otherwise.

As they rounded the edge of the house, Clay pulled up short. ""Whose car is that?""

The man let go of Clay and continued on. ""Don't worry. It's a friend."" Clay followed him into the house, wearily.

Another young man was sitting at the kitchen table, banging away at an elderly laptop. ""Hey Rory,"" he called as the door swung open. ""I couldn't figure out your WiFi password, so I hacked it and put a new password down. It's *HARD4FURRIES*, all caps, and the 'for' is the numeral 4, okay?""

""*Rory*?"" said Clay.

A sound like the early warning of a boiling kettle briefly slipped between the man's gritted teeth as he stood clenching his fists.

""Oh shit,"" said the new man. ""Are we not doing names? Uh. Sorry. Well, you must be Clay."" He got up from the table and came forward to shake Clay's hand. ""You can call me Bridger. I'm sorry, Rory.""

Rory took a deep breath. ""It's fine. I'm just glad you're here. Clay and I have been running some unstructured tests without much luck."" 

""Who are you?"" asked Clay. ""Not to be rude.""

""Bridger's on the team,"" said Rory. ""He's a little more scientifically inclined than me. He'll be helping with your testing and training. He's done extensive research into...your phenomenon.""

Clay pulled out the chair across from Bridger. ""Good. Maybe you can tell me what's going on.""

But Bridger just looked up to Rory and then down to his laptop. ""I'm not sure what I'm allowed to tell you.""

""How about *why*?"" said Clay. He pointed at Rory. ""This asshole has shot me over a dozen times so far. Mostly in the face. And...nothing. Not a mark on me. And this morning I kicked this giant-ass tree...""

""It wasn't that big,"" said Rory.

""I kicked a *large size* tree and split it across the middle like a fucking lumberjack.""

Bridger leaned forward eagerly. ""Really? You generated that kind of force?""

Rory nodded. ""You should have seen it. Idiot got crushed under the damn thing. It was like the climax of *Prometheus* only funnier.""

""That's amazing,"" said Bridger. ""Do you think you could do it again?""

Clay shook his head. ""Not unless you give me a reason. I don't want to do this weird guinea pig shit if you guys aren't gonna start giving me some answers. *Anything*! This is my fucking life. I think I deserve to know why I'm out here in this goddamn *Deliverance* cabin, chopping trees with my shins and getting paintballed with a friggin' sniper rifle.""

""Alright,"" said Rory, moving towards the refrigerator. ""Bridger, go ahead and tell him your theory.""

Bridger frowned. ""You think my theory is horseshit.""

Rory poured himself a glass of orange juice. ""It's not disproven, yet. So it's just as valid as any other answer we might give him.""

Bridger smiled and closed the laptop. ""Okay. So. You should know that my theory involves aliens.""

""Oh fuck right off,"" sighed Clay, burying his face in his hands. 

""It's not that bad,"" said Bridger. ""Just listen, okay? This is the short version. The longer version is...uh...""

""It's fucking unbearable,"" said Rory.

""I was going to say *time-intensive*,"" said Bridger. He shook his head, as if trying to clear away some accumulated dust. ""There are gaps. Evolutionary gaps. And there are theories on why these gaps exist. I believe, based on the research I have concluded, that outside forces have - on occasion - intervened to nudge our progress in one direction or another. The ways in which our progress has demonstrably outpaced that of other species feels very...*guided* to me. To cite a modern parallel, considered domesticated dogs.""

""I have a dog,"" said Clay, suddenly feeling a sharp pang of guilt and regret - possibly even sharper than what he'd felt at leaving his family.

""Breed?""

""Puggle,"" murmured Clay. He'd wanted a Australian Shepherd, but had been outvoted. And still he'd loved Chester with all his heart.

""Not something that would or arguably *should* exist,"" said Bridger. ""We made that dog. Genetic manipulation over generations. We guided that evolution, for our own purposes. Nature was jostled against her will. And I believe that some*thing* has done the same for us. For humans.""

Clay shook his head. He glanced at Rory. ""Please tell me you're not all crazy.""

Rory shrugged.

""Well, it's just a theory,"" said Bridger, apologetically. 

""So, let me guess,"" said Clay. ""I'm just part of the next evolution? Oh Jesus. Give it to me straight - am I an X-Man?""

Bridger sighed. ""No actually. I don't know what the next evolution will be. But you - and your kind - I believe you're part of a past evolution. A *failed* evolution. Something that nature simply wouldn't allow. And so the rest of us... the *next* evolution... we *devoured* you. And took your place. All in the name of balance.""

Rory handed Clay a glass of water. ""Yeah, I know. But he's not done yet.""

""No, obviously,"" said Bridger. ""Because you're here. So obviously you weren't destroyed.""

""What the hell does that even mean?"" asked Clay. ""I think you're gonna give me a migraine.""

""Okay, so here's the last part,"" said Bridger, flexing his fingers and sitting up straight in his chair. ""Where *you* come from. Do you ever play video games, Clay?""

""Yeah, sometimes.""

""Okay. So, you're probably aware that some gamers like to split their games open and play around in the guts, right?""

Clay frowned. ""Mods,"" said Rory. Clay nodded.

""Whatever,"" said Bridger. ""The point is, games have DNA. Data that can be unspooled and pulled apart and put back together. And *sometimes* gamers pull that data apart and they see things that *aren't* in the game. Characters, settings, models, *assets*. Things the developers were playing with, but didn't use in the final product. You follow?""

""Yeah,"" said Clay.

""So that evolution? The one that nature couldn't abide? It didn't disappear. It simply evolved again, into something so similar to everyone else as to be indistinguishable. And the parts that made those people so untenable? That code still exists. It's buried. It's down there with your eyebrow code and nose hair code and all that other shit. It's down there. And someone went in and...""

""Okay, okay,"" said Rory, glaring at Bridger. ""That's your theory. Let's leave it at that.""

""Who?"" said Clay, eyes flicking back and forth between the two men. ""Who went in to my code? Who split me open?""

Bridger shook his head. ""Those aren't really the right words and...and like Rory said, it's just a theory, so let's...""

Clay reared back and drove his fist through the center of the table. It shattered like glass, exploding in a cloud of dust and wooden shards.

Rory wiped the dust off his shirt as Bridger began digging through the debris, looking for his laptop. ""I really loved that table,"" said Rory.

""Sorry,"" said Clay.

Rory grabbed the sniper rifle from beside the door. ""That's fine. But it looks like we need to go work off some of that energy."" 

""Oh goddamnit,"" muttered Clay, as he dragged himself through the door.

""Are you gonna tell me your name?"" asked Clay as he pulled open the door of the black Dodge Charger. His heart was back to battering the insides of his chest. He realized he needed to talk to block out the anxiety of walking out on his family and jumping in the car with a man who'd just moments earlier shot him in the head as a conversation starter.

""No,"" said the man, dropping heavily into the driver's seat. ""Not to be cruel or difficult or anything, but we're in a dangerous place right now. And because of that I'm not gonna be able to answer all the questions that you have. You're just gonna have to be patient.""

Clay lingered outside the car. ""You just told me my family wasn't my real family; that most of life has been a lie; and that I have special powers which somehow make it okay for strangers to *shoot me in the face*...I'm not sure I can accept that right now.""

The man sighed. ""Well, it's not like I can threaten you at this point. Fine. I'll tell you what I can, but you should know I don't have all the answers.""

That seemed like the best bargain Clay was going to get, so he took a seat and closed the door.

""Seatbelt,"" growled the man.

Clay laughed. ""Are you serious? You just...""

""Shot you in the face, yes,"" said the man. ""You're gonna need to get over that. It's the fucking law, kid. I don't want to get pulled over at the moment.""

Clay clipped his strap and took a deep breath. ""So... I can't... I guess I can't get past the fact that they all *look* so much like me. And they always...I don't know...they always *acted* like my parents and my sister.""

""Well, I'm not a sociologist or anything,"" said the man. ""But they *have* been raising you since you were a toddler. I'd imagine they're attached.""

""So, are they...?""

""What? Bad guys? I don't know what they are. They're caretakers. They know at least enough to know how important it was to give you those shots every day. Besides that, I don't know what to tell you.""

Clay sat silently, absently grinding his teeth for a moment, nervous and sad and still toying with the notion that this was a joke or a dream or a strange delusion. Anything but real.

""So where do I come from?""

The man reached into his shirt pocket. Clay thought he was about to be handed some artifact of his past, but instead the man produced a mashed box of Camels and pulled out a cigarette. ""That I can't say.""

""Because you don't know or because you just can't say?""

""Works out to the same thing, doesn't it?""

""Not really,"" said Clay. ""So if I've got these powers and *someone* went to all the trouble of placing me with my parents... er, with... with *them*... because they were scared of me... why didn't they just kill me?""

The man snorted out puffs of white smoke like a bemused dragon. ""Because of compassion, Clay. Compassion and love.""

""You're being sarcastic.""

""And I also *shot you in the fucking head*, idiot! You consider the fact they didn't kill you 'cause that's not a viable option?""

Clay swallowed. It seemed like there was no bottom to this insanity. ""What are you saying? I'm unkillable or something?""

""How many times have you been hurt?"" said the man. ""Broken bones. Deep cuts. Christ, have you ever even had the wind knocked out of you?""

""I'm not a sports guy,"" said Clay. ""When would I have gotten hurt? That doesn't mean... you know? And what about these shots you were telling me about? They were injecting me with radiation, right? So why not just inject me with more radiation? *Tons* of radiation? All the goddamn radiation in the world? You're saying that wouldn't kill me?""

The man simply shrugged. ""Apparently not.""

Both passengers went silent. The car curled through winding town roads, out towards the highway.

""Where are we going?"" asked Clay.

""Safe house,"" said the man. ""We need a few weeks for all that radiation to wash out of your system. At least enough so we can see what we're working with.""

""You don't already *know* what I'm capable of?""

The man shot Clay a withering look through the haze of cigarette smoke. ""You not hear me earlier? They've been drugging you since you were a *toddler*. All we know is based on the data from when you were a baby. There's no way to know what you've become without seeing it firsthand.""

""But you made it sound like you already knew,"" said Clay. ""You said I'd *change the world*.""

The man nodded. ""Well, that's just based on history.""

""And what the hell does that mean?""

""Means you're not the only one of your kind, kid."" The car swung onto the on-ramp. ""Now hold on. I drive like an asshole.""

""There's more?"" said Clay. ""Other's like...""

But the man wasn't lying. The Charger roared out onto the four lane highway like a rabid stallion and it was all Clay could do to keep from puking his lunch out.

Clay was alone. Finally. How long had it been since he'd last had the house to himself? Weeks? *Months*? Callie was back from college and equal parts jobless and hopeless. She spent most days sprawled out on the couch in the living room, hugging a MacBook to her chest and sighing loudly. Dad didn't have any friends. Mom didn't have any interests. 

Thankfully someone died. Well, it wasn't great that the person had died, that was probably sad, but Clay couldn't remember her. It was some old lady from back when they went to church. Used to babysit Callie back when the world was all ice and cavemen or something. Clay begged off, claiming a math test. And that had worked. Somehow, someway, that had worked.

He was scrolling languidly through PornHub, looking for *just* the right smutty experience, when someone starting pounding on the door. Clay zipped up, swore, and slammed his laptop shut.

""Yuh?"" said Clay, as he cracked the door open. The man on the other side was young...hardly much older than Clay, but he wore a bone weariness you didn't often see from teenagers.  

""They're gone?""

Clay stealthily slid his foot against the door. ""And who are you?""

""Are you alone?"" said the man, trying to sneak a peek into the house past Clay. 

""No, no, it's a full house here,"" said Clay. ""So who are you?""

""You're lying,"" said the man. ""They went to the funeral, right?""

Clay scowled and tried to quietly slam the door shut, except the man already had his own foot jammed in the opening. ""Clay, don't freak out. I need to talk to you. Getting this opportunity took a lot of work."" 

A system of tiny gears clicked in Clay's head. ""*Opportunity*? Are you saying...?""

""Mrs. Rosemont was already dying,"" said the man. ""Don't worry about that. I'm worried about you. You *need* to hear what I have to say.""

""No thanks,"" said Clay. ""You need to get the hell out of here before I call the cops.""

The man shook his head. ""Alright. Fine. I was hoping we wouldn't have to do things this way."" Suddenly the muzzle of a handgun was leering at Clay through the crack in the door. ""Can you step back from the door now, please?""

Clay did as he was told, backing away on unsteady legs. The man stepped through, closing the door and gesturing towards the couch. ""You may want to sit down.""

""Okay,"" said Clay, lowering himself slowly onto the couch. ""But how about you put away the gun first?""

The man seemed to consider this for a moment. ""No,"" he said finally. ""I'm starting to think it'll be faster this way."" Then he pulled the trigger and shot Clay in the head.

Clay screamed. And screamed. And kept on screaming. And only after 60 seconds of screaming did he finally realize he was still alive. He touched his forehead. There was nothing. 

""There,"" said the man, pointing towards the floor in front of the couch. Clay looked down and saw a crumpled bullet underneath the coffee table.

""What the *fuck* kind of psycho trick was that?"" hissed Clay. ""You scared the shit out of me.""

""You think that was a trick?"" said the man. He aimed at the coffee table and pulled the trigger, blowing a hole through the center of the wooden top. ""Not a trick. Want to see it again?""

""Wh...what?"" said Clay, looking rapidly from the ruined coffee table to the man's gun.

""We *really* don't have time,"" said the man before firing another round directly at Clay's face. The boy screamed again and this time, under the burst of terror, he felt something...something like a mosquito brush against his skin.

""They aren't your parents,"" said the man. ""Not your sister. Not your family. You're not one of them.""

Clay was rubbing his forehead, only vaguely aware of what was being said. ""I'm not?""

The man rolled his eyes. ""How many times do I have to shoot you in the fucking head? No, you're *not* like them. You're something entirely different. They told you you have diabetes, right?""

""Told me? I *have* diabetes, yes,"" said Clay. ""Since I was a kid. For as long...as long as I can remember. Why...what about my diabetes?""

""You're not diabetic and those shots you've been taking all these years aren't insulin. They're inhibitor shots. Mild doses of radiation. They keep your powers in check.""

Clay picked up the second crumpled bullet. ""*Powers*? So I...no. No, wait. That doesn't make any sense. I *got* my shot this morning. If those are shots are inhibit-whatevers, than how come...you know...?"" He held up the bullet.

The man smirked. ""Surviving a gunshot to the head is the least of your powers, buddy. The things you can actually do...you're going to change the world.""

""Me? Just...just by *not* taking my insulin I'm going to be...?"" Clay shook his head. ""But why? If this is true....if any of this is true and I can do...whatever it is I can do...why would anyone lie about that? Why would they hide that from me?""

""Because,"" said the man, ""some people are afraid to let the gods come down from heaven and walk among us. They're afraid you might not like what they're doing...and end up doing something about it yourself."" The man stowed his gun and held out a hand. Clay took it and pulled himself off the couch. Maybe it was mental, just a figment of his imagination, but he already *felt* stronger. ""And Clay?"" The man smiled. ""We *don't* like what they've been doing. We don't like it at all. So now we're going to do something about it.""

And Clay smiled back. He felt something like the crackle of electricity tingling through his fingers. ""Good,"" he said. ""Lead the way.""

_______________________________________________

Why did you leave the cat? The stack of LPs you took, but the cat you left? You don’t even have a record player. And meanwhile, Daisy and I spend our days staring at each other. She’s telling me as plainly as she can manage, “You drove her away.” The cat blames me. And I told her – actually told her – “She left you behind. She didn’t want you. So don’t look at me like that.” I told the cat that. And she just kept on looking at me.

You left a sweater in the back of the closet. I don’t go in there, but Daisy does and she found it. She clawed it and tore it and rolled around in it, and eventually, she fell asleep in it. The first time I saw it she was wrapped so tight in the folds of the thing, I thought for a second the sweater was breathing. Lying there and breathing in your old closet. But it was the cat. She did that for a week. Then she figured it out. I don’t know what tipped it for her, but she put it together. I threw the sweater out. 

Daisy’s like me in this: she didn’t stop doing what she does because you left. You remember Karen? I didn’t talk about Karen much because you didn’t want me to talk about Karen, but Karen was before you and she broke my heart. Really broke it. I didn’t want to die when she left; I wanted to never have been born in the first place. But that’s good, in a way. I got over it. And then you left and it hurt, but nothing will ever hurt like that time with Karen. That’s my way of saying, I guess, you aren’t that important. I’m not trying to be malicious or anything. It’s just the truth. And Daisy’s the same way. She’s pissed you’re gone, but she didn’t stop eating or anything. She didn’t stop chasing spiders and the reflection off my wristwatch. She stills naps in the window. She just looks more pissed off when she wakes up. I don’t think cats have much room in their lives for love, but I think with Daisy maybe she tried for you. And you left, so now she knows better.

And don’t think that just because I’m seeing the cat’s point of view, that I like the cat or that I’m glad you left the cat. *You two need each other. You can take care of each other.* Fuck you for writing that. Leave if you want. Steal my shit if you need to. But don’t pretend that you’re doing anyone a favor. Even the cat knows you’re full of bullshit. 

But I’ll tell you this: I had a dream the other night. I don’t remember it very much, but it’s one of those edited dreams, where you’re seeing things you’ve done and places you’ve been, but it’s not a real memory. Like a messed up collage of old faces and places. But anyway, it was you and me and we were in Napa. I didn’t have much fun on that trip, but seeing it in my dream it was beautiful and exciting and just a big fucking blue sky parade for me and you. And I was seeing you like I never saw you in real life – just *otherworldly*. It was making my chest hurt and my heart race and I was twisting around in the bed and probably saying things, who knows. It was beautiful and it was terrifying. I wanted out of that dream so badly and I couldn’t wake up. I couldn’t get out. 

Then the fucking cat bit my hand and I woke up. I look around and I’m all tangled in the sheets and it’s 3 in the morning and Daisy’s on the bed, staring at me. And then she meows. Have you ever heard her meow? I’ve never heard her meow before and here I’m tumbling out of this nightmare and she’s sitting there, meowing at me. She meows and then she hops off the bed, disappears into the dark.

The stupid cat pulled me back. And not out of love. Nothing’s really changed. There’s no hidden affection there. I feed her and clean up her shit and the rest of the time we ignore each other. But Daisy pulled me away – away from that dream, that nightmare…away from you. 

So I think you might be right, in your usual twisted, self-serving way. I do need Daisy. Just not the way you think. I need her for those moments when I’m weak and I think I somehow deserved it. I need her when all the other goods things run out and I go tearing through that old shoebox, looking for your letters and hoping your phone number’s on there somewhere. 

I need her to remind me that even an asshole of a cat thinks I’m worth saving. We may not like each other, but we respect each other. And that’s a hell of a lot more than either of us can say about you. ",winsomeman,The Cat (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/5606ay/the_cat_wp/

As anyone who knows these sorts of thing will tell you, it takes at least three years for a new identity to stick. And even then, it isn't advised that you draw anything more than the most passing sort of scrutiny. 

Three years of pay stubs. Three years of verified housing. Three years of doctors appointments, car payments, and cable bills. Three years of living in that skin. And again, that's only good enough to look like you from a distance.

Linus Worth had been Linus Worth for four and a half years almost to the day when he set foot inside Cushing's Home for Boys. It had been, to him, a very long time.

""And you say you've fostered before?"" said the pretty, young volunteer. She wore a floral-print dress and a gray cardigan. She did not look Linus in the eyes.

""Yes. In Nebraska,"" said Linus, eyes straight ahead, always following a respectful distance behind. ""A boy named Noah. Quite bright. Very troubled. He ran away after only a week. It was...heartbreaking. I wasn't sure I'd ever have the heart to try again."" He sighed loudly. ""But I want to help. Very badly. And having children was Kristy's biggest wish...""

""Your wife?"" said the volunteer, still marching forward down the linoleum hallway.

""Yes. My wife,"" said Linus.

They stopped outside a room. The door was halfway open. ""Have you considered volunteering?"" said the girl.

""Yes,"" said Linus. ""But I...I think something more *committed* would work best for me. I have a lot of...love to give.""

The girl nodded, then pushed open the door. ""Davey? This is Mr. Worth. He wanted to meet you.""

The boy in the room was wiry and dark, with hunched shoulders and an upturned mouth. He was also missing one eye. The remaining eye blazed as he glared up at Linus and the volunteer.

""You a homo?"" said Davey, not bothering to set down the cover-less paperback in his hands.

""*Davey*!"" said the volunteer. ""You've been warned about talking like that. Mr. Worth is a guest.""

""Is Mr. Worth a homo?"" replied Davey. 

""I'm sorry,"" said the girl, still not able to look Linus in the eyes. ""He...well, I'm sure Davey would be happy to tell you about his background.""

He was not. Still, the girl was able to coax out some of the finer details. A dead father. A mother in jail. Two sisters in the system he'd already written off as lost. If any part of his life had caused Davey pain you wouldn't know it. He presented everything as fact, no more notable or traumatic than the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.

The sessions continued for two months. Two months of Linus listening, still-faced and thoughtful. Two months of Davey's pointed verbal abuse. Somewhere in those two months someone with the authority to do so had decided both parties had suffered enough, in their own unique ways. The paperwork was substantial. It took Linus just over an hour to complete. But in the end, Davey was his.

""You got some fag pad?"" said Davey, sprawled out in the passenger's seat of Linus' gently used Honda. ""You stick a dick in my mouth I swear I'll fuckin' bite it off.""

""Davey, how many times have I told you that you've got the wrong impression of me?"" said Linus, pulling off the highway and heading out towards the farmland to the north. ""I'm not a homosexual.""

Davey shrugged. ""Pretty faggy to me. Buying lil' boys and all.""

""I didn't *buy* you,"" said Linus with a laugh. ""They *gave* you to me. That's an important distinction to make. If I'd bought you that would imply you were worth something.""

Now Davey laughed. ""Ha! Gettin' bitchy, huh? Time of the month?""

""Davey, Davey,"" sighed Linus. ""You should know why I picked you.""

Davey snorted. The world outside his window was full of trees and rocks and nothing much more. He shifted in his seat.

""I like people like you Davey,"" said Linus, raising a finger. ""And no, not in the way you're so quick to claim. It's not that you're a boy. It's that you refuse to be scared.""

""Man, what the fuck does that mean?"" said Davey. ""I'm sure as hell not scared of *you*.""

Linus nodded, following a rhythm only he could hear. ""Oh, but you *are* afraid. Very afraid. You've been afraid for a very long time now. Afraid of being hurt. You wear that attitude like a shield, because you think it will protect you. You think it will keep away the people who enjoy causing fear. People like your father. But you can't keep those people away, Davey. No, no. And in the end...in the end they always find you.""

""Fuck off,"" said Davey, leaning towards the window. ""Do whatever the fuck you want. I don't care.""

""Good,"" said Linus. ""I suppose I will. But before I do, would you like to make a bet?""

Davey shook his head. ""Fuck off, goddamn faggot.""

""It'll be a good one,"" said Linus. ""Well worth your while. Open the glove compartment.""

Davey glared at the man, but did as he was told. There was a bundled pile of money sitting alone in the compartment.

""I bet that I can make you scream,"" said Linus. ""And I bet I'll do it before the hour is up."" Davey shook his head but said nothing. ""If you make it an hour without screaming, you can have that money and go wherever you like.""

Davey eyed the money. ""Just don't scream?""

Linus smiled. ""One hour. Starting now.""

Davey nodded. ""Alright. Do whatever the fuck you want.""

""No worries,"" said Linus. ""In due time. But first..."" He parked the car. They were just down a slope from a small wooden shack. ""Follow me.""

They walked up the dirt path to the shack. Davey considered his options. He could easily knock the man down and steal the money, but would he have to kill the man to be safe? Davey thought he could, but he wasn't sure. Maybe he could just play along and hope the man was being honest?

Linus saw the deliberation playing out behind the boy's eyes. It was very pleasing to him. ""Oh, I forgot one small thing,"" he said as he pushed open the door to the shack and swept Davey inside with a gentle hand. He flicked on the lights.

""We've got company,"" said Linus, holding the boy firmly by the shoulders. ""How long has it been since you've seen your sisters?""

Davey screamed.",winsomeman,I Bet (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/55py4h/i_bet_wp/

_________________________________________________

Isaac came aboard the *Eurydice* at Ganymede. He was part of the crew that installed the hyperbaric chambers in the Turner-Al Saad Executive Spa. At the end of the shift, he'd excused himself to the lavatory and then just never left. 

He had to see it. He had to be a part of history in the making.

Dak had helped. He'd hacked the in-house debit portfolio and created a dummy account for Isaac. All of Isaac's payment scans would ping the dummy account and come back showing sufficient credit. There'd be a whopper of an unpaid balance by the end of the trip, but that was for the shipline's accountants to worry about. Given how much they stood to make on the voyage, a write-off that size was meaningless.

Isaac still would have preferred to book a legitimate berth on the ship, but that was out of the question. Ticketing was through a high-end Martian brokerage with alpha class system security. Well beyond Dak's abilities. So Isaac would have to make due, casually napping in hidden corners and common areas. That was fine, as far as he was concerned. He didn't intend to sleep much anyway.

The maiden voyage of the *Eurydice* would last just under ten Earth Years, arriving to port at Janus in Alpha Centauri, exchanging passengers, and then setting off back to Ganymede for another decade's travel at particle warp. The fastest passenger flight of all time. *Faster than angels*, the advertisements had said. ""Faster than demons, too,"" Isaac thought to himself. 

And that was the thing of it. Isaac had no interest in Janus. And while he had every intention of sampling all the various luxuries the *Eurydice* had to offer, that wasn't what drew him to stow away aboard arguably the most luxuriant ship ever built. 

It was the hubris. The defiance. The wondrous arrogance of it all. The *Eurydice* was simply the next evolution of mankind's innate sense of entitlement - the desire to control *all*, to conquer *all*, to have *all*. To Isaac, it was a historic moment in more ways than most could recognize. 

So Isaac bought a tailored suit in a small boutique on the 215th floor and paid premium credits for a spot by the railing, under the crystal clear Lucite shielding, to watch the great ship - the *greatest* ever ship - slide slowly away from her housing in the orbiting dock. He saw the twinkling lights of Ganymede below and the twinkling pulse of the stars above and smiled. 

Seven days later, the *Eurydice* boosted into particle warp.

Isaac passed much of those early days up on the deck, watching the distorted milky silver streaks of distant stars slip past. He read borrowed books - real paper books - in the central library and watched old movies in the antique film theater on the 20th floor. He played games of Go with an elderly man he'd met in the terrarium. He visited the sprawling brothels that dotted the aft-end of the ship and paid extra for the privilege of sleeping a few hours in a real bed.

Months passed as the *Eurydice* cut through space - enormous and weightless. A rogue planet moving faster than the space around her could properly account for, splitting the nothingness and finding the deeper nothing within.

Malaise set in. Not for Isaac, but for the larger population of the ship. No luxury, no matter how fantastic, is impervious to the degradations of monotony. 

The fantasy began to curl at the edges. The real text below became visible. *Life* took over.

But not for long.

Isaac was in a salon getting a haircut when the explosion happened. It cracked like thunder, which was a sound Isaac hardly believed he remembered. There were screams and confusion. A warning siren. Then a soft voice ringing through the PA.

*Do not panic. Please remain where you are. There has been a small collision. There is damage to floors 85 through 142 on the starboard side. Emergency response crews are engaged. Do not panic. Remain where you are. Do not panic.*

Some listened. Many did not. In the end, the damage was more substantial than the crew were willing to let on. At least 3,000 people were either blown to pieces or sucked into space. Three sizable farms and one of the larger animal pens were destroyed. The *Eurydice* was not crippled, but the faith of the passengers was shaken, and shaken badly.

They would not turn back. In truth, they *couldn't* turn back. They were plotted for Janus. There wasn't fuel enough to slow down, turn around, and boost back into particle warp in the opposite direction. But the passengers did not know this. They only knew that they were not invulnerable; that they were hurtling at mercilessly dangerous speeds through an ocean of darkness they now saw as hostile.

Metal workers on the 225th floor began making guns. Isaac bought one. 

The grocery stores on the lower floors began to have shortages. The cheap restaurants stopped being cheap and the expensive restaurants got more expensive.

*A temporary situation* ship administrators said. A symptom of the losses suffered in the collision. Things would get back to normal in a few seasons. 

But the people on the lower floors became hungry, and they went into debt buying food. The in-house debit portfolio had mandatory cut-offs once your debt levels got too high. Travelers were cut off from making additional purchases. No food. No power. No anything.

The admins on the *Eurydice* hadn't planned for paupers. There was no welfare. There were no social workers. Many starved. Admins could be heard casually suggesting suicide. 

Things got worse.

Isaac tried to help at first. He used his dummy account to buy food for poor strangers. But then a man tried to cut the scanning strip out of Isaac's wrist. And another did the same. And that second time Isaac had to shoot the man. 

So Isaac was a murderer. And the ship was full of dying, desperate people.

And then one day they blocked off the 100 level. All 100 floors, quarantined from the rest of the ship. 

Isaac bought a knife and more bullets. He spent most of his nights in the brothels, paying absurd amounts to sleep alone with the door locked.

There were explosions in the 100s. A series of them. Isaac could hear them all the way up in the 400s. 

*Do not panic* said the voice on the PA. *Do not panic.*

""They'll blow straight through the hull!"" screamed the men and women of the top floors. ""You have to *stop* them.""

They sent warnings down to those lower floors. Warnings and threats. But no one went down there. And there was no way to know if anyone ever heard those threats. 

The explosions continued. 

Finally, the Captain ordered the life support cut for all 100 floors. 

The explosions stopped.

And the middle class became the lower class. Food did not appear by magic. Money did not appear by magic. Isaac shot another man. Later he shot five women while escaping from the brothels. 

There were whispers of another rebellion. A construction company on the 240th floor was found in possession of materials used for making bombs. 

They closed off the 200s as a precaution. Life support and everything. 

Isaac ate dry handfuls of cut oats and packs of freeze-dried fruit as he sat under the Lucite shielding and watched the universe slip by. He shot anyone who got too close.

More explosions. More explosions. Shops raided. Shops raided. 

Every now and then the crew would manage to grab a brief moment of order and the explosions would stop and everyone would look around and wonder what they had become and where they were headed. They turned the life support back on for the lower levels. They had to. They needed the farm land. 

The wealthy were the poor, and everyone else was dead.

They rebuilt the farms. There was no livestock. That was over. But they tilled the soil and brought it back to life. 

And sometimes they forgot that it was working and they killed each other again. But then they remembered.

And always the *Eurydice* slipped through the blackest space, heading towards a planet they'd nearly forgotten about. 

Isaac lived. He tilled. He foraged. He hid. He killed. But he lived. 

The Captain and the Helmsman were long dead by the time they reached Janus. Thankfully, the ship remembered what to do. They found a berth and finally - finally, finally, finally - the *Eurydice* came to a stop.

Isaac disembarked. He'd thrown away his gun. He'd thrown away his knives. He rode the transport down to the surface and touched still land for the first time in forever and cried a decade's worth of forgotten tears.",winsomeman,Children of Apollo (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/55p04f/children_of_apollo_wp/

________________________________________________

*Dearest Agatha,*

*If there is a lesson to be learned in all of this, it may simply be that the value of dressing well and showing common courtesy is impossible to underestimate.*

*To step back within the narrative, I'll begin by confirming the facts with which you are already familiar. Following the War, of which I was but a humble spectator and not a participant, in large part due to a hereditary trait which causes swelling in my joints during moments of stress and would therefore make me a certain liability upon the field of battle, I took a holiday in the French countryside. As I explained to my Father, the purpose of this was to clear my head and return to the States fully prepared to regain my position within the family meat processing empire.*

*During my travels, however, I met a gentleman who raved of certain entertainments to be found in the City of Paris. He described these entertainments in such a way that it seemed foolish not to at least make the trip and verify his many claims. So to Paris I went. In searching for the building in which these entertainments may be found, I became a bit misdirected. I did, however, come to find myself walking before a pair of English-speaking gentlemen and took to following them, in the hopes that they may also be seeking these noted entertainments.*

*These gentlemen arrived at a grand building. Through overheard conversation, I learned that this was the French Foreign Ministry and* not *the site of the entertainments I sought. As I considered my mistake, wonderfully formal footmen held open the door. When the gentlemen went in and the footmen remained holding the door open, I realized that they assumed I was with the other gentlemen. Preferring not to make these hired men feel foolish in their (perfectly reasonable) assumption, I entered the building.*

*Once inside, I had all intentions of taking a brief tour and then leaving, however, I was immediately approached by an official of some authority. He asked which nation I represented. Now, you must understand, I made a mistake of judgment in this moment. I did not previously know what the purpose of the French Foreign Ministry might be, so I assumed (and I argue it was reasonable to do so) that they managed affairs primarily concerned with foreign tourists. Therefore, when the gentleman asked my name and which nation I represented, I thought he was serving as the equivalent of a guest book, merely collecting pertinent information.*

*That is why I thought it would be a laugh to say what I said.*

*""I represent the Great, Misunderstood Nation of Gervonia,"" I told the man, which caused him to blink in confusion.*

*""Gervonia, sir?"" he said, flipping through sheets of paper. ""And your nation suffered some upheaval during the War?""*

*""Such upheaval!"" I said, wondering only in that moment whether or not the French Foreign Ministry contained a museum or anything of common interest to pass the time. ""The Germans stole the entirety of our livestock, all of our feather pillows, most of our good pens, and a handful of our better looking children.""*

*The man gawped at this, which I took as a sign of a good yarn. ""I suppose you will be arguing for reparations?"" he said.*

*""Indeed,"" I replied, not entirely sure what was meant, but feeling that my little joke was exceeding its station quite substantially. ""We will be demanding land, infantrymen, and a quarter of their richest pastries. The fury of Gervonia is not easily quenched!""*

*The man bowed his head. ""Well, I should think not. Please, find a seat in the hall. The proceeding shall begin shortly.""*

Ah, *I thought to myself*, there must be a show of some variety. *So I took my seat in a grand hall and made myself comfortable. This was not, of course, the entertainment I had traveled so far to experience, but you know as well as any, Dear Agatha, that I am not so rigid as to refuse a pleasant change of plans.*

*What followed, in all honesty, was a bit drab for my tastes. It was largely just a lot of talking and talking. There were Americans there, as well as Brits, Japs, Italians, and a few others. None did much to hold my attention. I was thoroughly bored and considering my escape when I heard someone call out my name. I sat up on instinct as they named me the representative of Gervonia, an aggrieved party to the War.*

*""What does Gervonia seek?"" said someone I did not manage to see.*

*The man from earlier stood up. ""They seek land, military armament, and food rations,"" he said, before nodding in my direction.*

*""Land?"" scowled a muttonchop'd fellow in a luxurious overcoat. ""That pie cannot be sliced any further.""*

*""We aren't a fussy people,"" I said, standing up. ""Just a small bit, something off one of the ends will be fine. Preferably something with a river or a chocolate factory.""*

*""And you require arms?"" said another man. ""The War is over, sir.""*

*""Well,"" I replied, ""Gervonia believes in an eye for an eye. We were invaded, rather rudely, so we would like the opportunity to do the same. That seems fair to me.""*

*""To be clear,"" said the muttonchopped'd fellow. ""You want a piece of Germany, as well as the arms and supplies necessary to invade her?""*

*""We can invade someone else, if you like,"" I said. ""As I stated, we are not a fussy people. I think it's more the principle of the thing. We can't sit around, getting invaded, and not do a bit of invading ourselves. It's demoralizing.""*

*I realize, my dear, that this letter has gone on perhaps a bit longer than usual, so I will sum up by saying that if you are so inclined, you should consider purchasing a ticket and joining me here on the old continent. Gervonia is, at the moment, a relatively sparse plot of land, but there is a very good chance we will have invaded Luxembourg by the time this letter reaches you and I hear they have some rather nice cafes.*

*Yours in love,*

*F. Paul Risenbaum, III*

""It isn't worth it,"" said Niklas, trying to grab the phone out of my hands. ""The terms are trash. You're gonna be miserable. Just sit it out, man.""

I pushed him off. He was right - the profile certainly had a *lot* of fine print, and I wasn't thrilled with all the contractual details, but what else was I supposed to do?

""Nik, my L-credit's trash,"" I said. ""The thing with Viv *ruined* me. This is it for me. This is my atonement.""

Niklas shook his head. ""*Or* just fucking stay out of that shit for a while. It's a demerit-based system, Quinn. Give it time. Five...seven years out from the Viv thing and it'll be like you're starting all over. You can get a nice secured relationship. Someone else looking to raise their score. It's not a big deal.""

That just about sealed it for me. ""*Seven fucking years?* Are you absolutely mental? I'm not going solo for seven years! I'll be an old, washed up, middle-aged perv by then. It won't matter what my L-credit looks like. No, I've got to do this. I need to start improving my score *now*, so I can trade up to something top tier before I'm too old to start a family.""

Niklas drained the last of his coffee and chucked the empty cup into the bin. ""You're an idiot. Subprime relationships are a scam. Everyone knows that.""

""They're not a scam. It's just a hardship. I'll manage. And as long as I don't fuck up again, I'll be back in the black in a couple years.""

""Have fun,"" said Niklas. ""I'm going back to work.""

I waved sarcastically. Niklas just didn't understand. In fact, I'm pretty convinced that if you've never had a bad L-credit score, there's no way you *could* understand. Bad L-credit just takes a shit situation and makes it worse. It's a pit. And if you don't get your head out of your ass, you just end up digging deeper and deeper.

And besides, this Rebecca seemed nice enough. Her own L-credit score was mid-range. Respectable. She was only on the subprime list because of her demands. And that's not so bad. Just meant she had standards. 

I messaged her. Complimented her profile pictures. Noted I had similar tastes in music and film. Expressed a desire to get a drink sometime.

Her reply was perhaps a bit telling, but fair.

""HOW'D YOU GET SUCH A LOW SCORE? DEETS OR NO GO.""

It's hard to explain what happened with Vivian in a single conversation, let alone in a text chat. Like a lot of things in life, it was much more complicated than it seems from a distance.

I replied: ""Last GF and I drifted apart. Bad communication. Bad ending.""

She replied: ""BULLSHIT. YOUR SCORE IS WAY LOW. YOU DID SOMETHING.""

And that was true. I made out with Trisha, Vivian's best friend. But like I said, it was complicated.

I replied: ""Made mistake. Kissed someone else. Relationship was already dying.""

She replied: ""YOU SOUND LIKE A WINNER. MAKE IT DINNER. YOU PAY.""

I gripped my hands into tight fists. Right. *Atonement.* This is what I deserved.

I replied: ""Sounds great. Pick the place.""

She replied: ""REAL MEN PICK THE PLACE.""

Okay. It was going to be fine. All part of the process.

I met Rebecca at a fancy sushi restaurant. I'd offered to pick her up, but she didn't want me to know her address. 

""What's with the car?"" she asked, as I stepped forward to give her a hug.

""What's...what?""

""I thought you worked in marketing?"" said Rebecca. ""Your car's like...ten years old.""

""Five,"" I said, pulling absently at the collar of my shirt. ""I hear this place is great.""

""You've never been?"" said Rebecca. ""So neither of us will know what we're doing? Great."" She stood at the side of the door. Taking the hint, I opened the door for her. ""Okay,"" is all she said to that particular gesture.

I ordered dinner for both of us, as Rebecca only looked at the drink menu. ""I don't know sushi,"" she'd said. ""I'm not a huge fan.""

""Would you have preferred to go somewhere else?"" I asked.

""What difference does that make?"" said Rebecca. ""We're already here, aren't we?""

I smiled. ""Right. Future reference, I guess.""

Rebecca excused herself. While she was gone I took out my phone and pulled up my *Karma_Counter* profile. ""Up five points,"" I whispered to myself. So far, so good.

Rebecca tried everything and liked nothing. Her drink was returned twice for being too watered down. She was also unimpressed with my shirt, my haircut, and the way I held my glass of water. 

""I don't know,"" she said. ""It's too low on the glass. That's like how little kids hold a glass. I keep thinking you're going to drop it."" 

I smiled and stopped drinking water for the rest of the meal.

Although she made it very clear that she had a rotten experience, Rebecca agreed to a second date. We met for brunch. She ordered spaghetti, which was very much not on the menu.

We went to a museum for our third date. She took pictures of all the exhibits, even as the unpaid volunteers chasing us around the building told her not to. 

""I paid for my ticket,"" was all she would say when they threatened to have her removed. She did not pay for her ticket.

On it went. And although every day had become a fresh nightmare of debasing text messages and financially crippling outings, my L-credit was on the rise.

""It's not worth it,"" Niklas said one day after work, as we walked to the gym. ""No matter what your score looks like, you're gonna come out of this so damaged it won't matter.""

""What doesn't kill me only makes me stronger,"" I replied.

""Are you a fucking Buddha now?""

""I am beyond Earthly torment.""

""We'll see,"" said Niklas.

And we did see. Almost immediately. Because Rebecca called me while I was at the gym that day, and when I did not answer, she texted me, and when I did not answer she left messages on my various social media platforms. When I did not reply to *those*, Rebecca began a rather impressive social media carpet-bombing campaign, in which what remained of my character was obliterated beyond recognition, while all females in any way connected to my accounts were interrogated and, if they made the mistake of defending themselves or me, called some variation of the word ""whore"".

It was not an especially pleasant way to come down off a post-workout high.

I called things off with Rebecca. It was not a pleasant break-up. In fact, if my relationship with Rebecca was a time bomb, you could say I'm still finding hidden pieces of shrapnel to this day. She is not someone who lets things go easily. 

More atonement, I guess.

My L-credit is, once again, a flaming barrel of baby diapers. Worse, actually, than it was before Rebecca. Niklas was right, which is always a wretched thing to have to admit. But it's fine. I've learned my lesson. No subprime relationships. I'm just going to live with my rotten L-credit. It's not the worst thing in the world.

*Although*...I did just see a new service open up next to the Arby's down on Mallard. *Title Love*, I think it's called. Short-term relationships - they only last until your next paycheck! And they don't even *check* your L-credit!

_________________________________________________

Bertram wears his thinking cap. That's what I call it anyway. Really, it's just a silly little dog-sized Sherlock hat he lets me put on him as long as I give him plenty of treats first. It's important, though. He's my sidekick. He's got to look the part.

I put on the long, wool scarf my Nan knitted me last year. It's red and green and blue and goes around my neck four full times, with plenty left over. I also wear a gray bowler hat. I think that came from a Halloween costume of Dad's. It's kinda cheap and plastic-looking, and it's much too large, but it's the best detective hat I could find in their closet. Last, I get my spyglass. It's just a magnifying glass. It may have come out of a box of Trix, but it works pretty good. It makes little things big, and that's all that matters. In fact, that's most of what detective work *is*, says Dad.

""Finding the little things that are actually big things in disguise,"" he says. But not actually little thing. He means little *seeming* things.

So Bertram is ready and so am I. It's Friday night. Mystery Night!

Last week was a hum-*dinger*! Mom's necklace went missing. Her favorite one - with the turquoise stone and the rose gold heart. Not in the bedroom and not in the bathroom. Not in the house at all! I asked the right questions, though. That's another thing Dad always says about detecting. ""The right question makes all the difference."" So I asked her where she'd been and who she'd talked to and what they'd said and how they'd *looked* and I figured it out! It was the desk lady at the gym! She'd been very envious of Mom's pretty necklace and she knew the code to the electronic locks in the locker room. Motive and means! Mom and Dad drove me over to the gym and sure enough, I got the desk lady to fess up!

Of *course* I know it was all make believe. People don't just steal from each other and laugh and give it back and say thanks and that's that. People get arrested. Or they lie. Or they hurt each other. But it's fun all the same and Dad says I'm basically a pro.

Anyway, I'm ready to go!

Bertram and I come down the stairs. ""Detective Ellie Gumshoe, on the case!"" I shout. Bertram barks to let everyone know he's there, too. No one says anything back.

I look around. The TV's on in the living room. The lights are on in the kitchen. But I don't see anyone around.  

""Detective Ellie's here!"" I call. No one says anything. I turn off the TV and listen. Nothing.

""Mom? Dad?"" Nothing.

I look at Bertram. His thinking cap's fallen crooked on his head. ""Hey. You don't suppose...?"" I run over to the living room window. It looks out on the driveway. Both cars are there. 

""It's already started,"" I say. ""You see, Bert? *That's* the mystery. I have to find Mom and Dad.""

I start with the obvious. I go back upstairs. I look in their room. It's empty. Not in the closet. Not under the bed. They're not there. 

They aren't in the upstairs bathroom either. ""Not upstairs,"" I say to Bertram. ""So that's eliminated.""

We go back downstairs. I check the guest bedroom. Nothing there. Nothing in the hall closet. Nothing in the living room. 

Okay. 

I decide to leave the basement for last. I don't really like the basement. Mom and Dad know I don't like the basement. I don't think they're down there.

The backdoor in the kitchen is open. That's for sure a clue. I look out at the backyard. There's some toys out there. The lawnmower's still out. It's getting dark, but that's all there is. They're not in he backyard.

Okay. 

I close the kitchen door. I'll check the basement. 

I open the door and turn on the light. The basement smells funny as always. Like dust and old water. I point down the stairs and click my tongue. Bertram doesn't go for it. He doesn't like the basement either. I go down without him.

The stairs are loud. Every step sounds like something's about to break. The railing is wobbly. I make it all the way down. The ground down here is plain cement. There's a big pile of boxes in the corner. I'm not going to check the boxes. They wouldn't be in the boxes. That's not a good mystery. I walk around. Mom's exercise equipment is down here. The thing she runs on and the thing with all the rubber bands. I don't remember the last time she used them. More boxes. The furnace. It's summer, so it's not on. The washer and dryer. 

I hear something! 

Oh, it's Bertram on the stairs. He comes a couple steps down and whines. 

Okay. They're not down here.

I go back upstairs. 

*Where are they?*

Okay, remember. Little things that are actually big things. Okay.

I go back to the kitchen. There's a broken glass on the counter. Wine. I think it had wine in it. Mom likes wine. She broke a glass, but didn't clean it up. Is that a clue? That must be a clue. Why would she break a glass and not clean it up?

What else? What else?

One of the drawers is open. Which one? Oh. The knife drawer. I forgot which that was because I don't ever go in that one. 

Okay. The knife drawer is open. Mom broke a wine glass and left it. The kitchen door was open.

Think think think. Little things that are actually big things. Ask the right questions. Questions...but who can I ask? Mom and Dad aren't here? 

I look through the kitchen window. *Mrs. Meacham!*

Mrs. Meacham lives next door. Her kitchen looks at our kitchen. Sometimes Mom will wave at her when she's cooking. Maybe she saw something?

I walk across the lawn, but leave Bertram at home (Mrs. Meacham doesn't like dogs). Mrs. Meacham answers when I ring the doorbell. 

""Lil' Ellie, how are you?"" she says. She likes me. 

""Hi Mrs. Meacham,"" I say. ""I was wondering if you saw anything suspicious tonight? Like, anything in my kitchen?""

""Say again, dear? What happened in your kitchen?""

""Nothing,"" I say. ""But my parents are missing and I'm collecting clues, so I wondered if maybe you...""

""*Missing*?"" says Mrs. Meacham. ""You're all alone? What happened?""

""It's a mystery,"" I explain. I'm getting worried that Mrs. Meacham is getting worried. She doesn't know about Mystery Night. ""It's okay. I'm trying to solve it. But all I know so far is that the backdoor was open, there's a broken glass of wine, and the knife drawer was left open, too. So I thought maybe you might have seen or heard...""

But Mrs. Meacham is just getting more and more worried and not really listening to me. ""Are you playing or are you telling me your parents are missing?"" She grabs my shoulders. It kind of hurts. 

""We're playing,"" I say. ""They're missing and I'm trying to find them. It's Mystery Night.""

Mrs. Meacham just shakes her head and grabs hold of my arm. ""I don't know what's going on. I need to talk to your parents. You're giving me a *fright*, girl.""

She pulls me out of her house. ""But you *can't* talk to them."" I really don't know how to make Mrs. Meacham understand. ""They're missing."" She just shakes her head and drags me back to my house. 

We go in through the kitchen door. Bertram barks and Mrs. Meacham kicks at him. ""Get that thing away from me!""

I lead Bertram to the bathroom and close the door. He starts howling immediately. ""It's not a bad thing,"" I say. ""I was just looking for clues. I'm sorry I bothered you."" 

Mrs. Meacham isn't listening to me. ""Glen? Polina? Are you home? Your daughter is playing strange games. Are you *here*?""

I start to get worried about Mystery Night. If Mrs. Meacham keeps yelling and making a fuss, maybe my parents will come and I'll never solve the mystery. And then maybe they'll never want to do Mystery Night anymore. What if Mrs. Meacham calls the police? What if my parents get in trouble?

""It's okay,"" I keep saying, chasing Mrs. Meacham around the house. ""It's okay! It's just a game. It's just a mystery.""

Mrs. Meacham searches almost exactly like I did earlier, then she shakes her head. ""This isn't right. I'll call the police.""

""No!"" I shout, and I say it so loud Mrs. Meacham finally notices me again. I think fast. ""You didn't look in the basement.""

I'm not really thinking. I'm just scared. Scared for my parents. Scared for us. Mrs. Meacham's really going to ruin everything. I know she is. 

Mrs. Meacham goes to the basement and opens the door. Bertram is still howling in the bathroom. ""What's down there?"" she asks me.

""Exercise stuff,"" I say.

She leans over and turns on the light. ""Glen? Polina? You down there?""

I barely touch her. At least, I think I barely touched her. I don't really remember to be honest. All I remember is that she went forward and I saw her feet weren't touching anything and I slammed the door closed behind her. All I could hear was Bertram's howling.

I drag a chair over and leave it in front of the basement door. I don't know what that does. I know I've seen it in movies before.   

I let Bertram out of the bathroom. He had an accident on the bathmat. That's okay.

I go back outside and sit down on the steps. My hands are shaking. My everything is shaking. I'm not a very good detective.

I look up and see it. Why hadn't I seen it before? How come I'd forgotten it?

I wander across the yard. Bertram follows me. We walk to the shed way down at the edge of the lawn. The door is unlocked. I push it open.

""You got us!"" shouts Dad.

""Took you long enough,"" says Mom. She's smiling. She's not mad.

""I kidnapped your mom,"" says Dad. ""And then dragged her to my lair. Mwah haha!""

""I'd've been finished if not for the brave and intelligent, Detective Ellie Gumshoe!"" says Mom. ""But now I'm famished. Dinner?""

""I want pizza,"" says Dad, laughing as he picks me up and hugs me to his chest. ""Wow. You're getting big, aren't you?""

I don't say anything. I don't say anything at all.

_________________________________________________

The *Fiesta de la Muerte* is an ancient vessel, aye. Built in the days when the local ship builders took a far greater pride in their labors (Old Gormley estimates 1987), she is painted a lovely sky blue and bears the figure of a headless baseball man upon her prow. Legend tells that the figure once bore a head indeed and that the head would bob up and down in mimicry of the ocean's waves. At some point the head was dislodged. The body, however, is glued quite firmly.

The ship was won in a game of chance. Specifically, weekly fantasy football. Luck was with me that week, aye. Luck and a rash of undiagnosed concussions. 

While many would suggest that the *Fiesta de la Muerte* is no longer travel-worthy, I saw in her compact, boxy features a unique opportunity. She was, after all, built in that lost time - back before all ships were governed centrally by powers unseen. In other words - she was *free*.

So equipped, I set about assembling my crew. Old Gormley was first, which seemed providence to me. He was, after all, the first father of my first wife, and the first man to visit me in jail at the conclusion of that relationship. We had long been fast friends and there are few I trust more. 

Second was the quiet Meep, a stony boy with an obtuse past. I do not know if I trust Meep, to be honest, but his technical knowledge is vast and his WiFi hotspot is strong indeed.

Third and last was sweet, simple Mallory, the Queen of the Lanes and the hatchet in my heart. Our love was born in rivalry - a jealousy that sparked when my *Most Wanted* picture appeared above hers at the local Post Office. She sought me out, almost certainly with deadly intentions, but our chemistry was instant and she landed only a few glancing hacks before our love was unearthed.

Together we roam the dusty gray waste of Middle America, lurking in those grand, quiet spaces between cities, hunting for treasure. Old Gormley is the only one old enough to remember clearly the time when ships moved freely, controlled by nothing more than the whims of man and the flagging availability of fossil fuels. So it is Old Gormley who mans the helm of the *Fiesta de la Muerte* while I sit at his side and call out commands. In the back, Meep uses his many ""devices"" to ""hack"" the ""drive command"" of our targets. It is a strange black magic that requires an especially costly data plan.

Targets so acquired and disabled, the work is quick and easy. Meep pushes the ship off the road. With the press of a button, the rear hatch is activated, presenting to us the many spoils of our journey. There is a brief sorting process. Space is limited on the *Fiesta de la Muerte*. We must be choosy in our plundering. 

The freight having been picked clean, we move to the passengers. Old Gormley carries a very large wrench. Mallory wraps her fists in sandpaper and swears a lot. I wear rather heavy boots, with which I make a show of kicking out their headlights. It is all very intimidating. Meep calculates the cost of the hypothetical damage we may be able to inflict upon their ship and their bodies. He then presents a tablet and suggests a payoff of approximately 50 percent that value. Some haggling follows, during which Mallory swears, Gormley grips his wrench, and I stand at the side of the ship with my foot suggestively cocked. Terms are agreed to. Credit cards are tapped. We make our escape.

It is not an easy life, no. But it is the life we have chosen. Someday I fear that justice may catch up to us and we shall be punished bodily for our crimes. But until that day, the freeways of America are vast indeed and full to the brim with a bounty beyond measure.",winsomeman,We Sail the Asphalt Ocean (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/54708b/we_sail_the_asphalt_ocean_wp/

It's about my nephew. He's 6 years old and he's been having really weird dreams lately.

I'm going to withhold his real name for privacy reasons, so let's call him Joe. Joe is *very* imaginative. To the point where it's almost a waste to buy him new toys because he can have just as much fun playing with a broken remote control (he gets plenty of toys, though). He can make fun for himself wherever and whenever. Oddly enough, though, according to his mom (my sister) he's never had an imaginary friend. He doesn't ""make up"" people. Just plays pretend with the stuff around the house.

So, about a month ago, my sister heard Joe up in his room one night laughing and laughing, which isn't super strange for him. He's good at entertaining himself. The next morning, my sister asked what was so funny and he said that ""Mr. Snaggletooth"" was telling him jokes. According to Joe, Mr. Snaggletooth is an old man with ratty clothes, wild hair, and just one tooth. So, basically a hobo sort of character. My sister thought it was weird, just because they live up in the woods in a real rural area, so she's certain he's never seen someone who looks like that in person. She figures he's based on a character on TV, but can't figure out which one (she monitors TV time pretty closely, so she usually knows what Joe's been watching).

So, not a big deal. But then the next night, she wakes up and she can hear him laughing in his room. It's really late, so she yells up the stairs and tells him to go to sleep. He quiets down a little, but she can hear him whispering. So she goes up the stairs and into his room and he's straight asleep. She watches him for a bit, but he doesn't say anything or do anything, so she goes back to bed. 

Next morning, she asks him about it and he says that Mr. Snaggletooth was there telling jokes, but then she yelled at them and Mr. Snaggletooth got mad and told Joe he didn't like being interrupted, so he left. The way my sister tells it, Joe was pretty mad about it, too.

Night after night, same thing. Somewhere in the middle of the night, Joe starts laughing and talking. Sometimes, my sister and her husband let it go. Sometimes they yell up to get him to stop. (My brother-in-law was certain Joe was just messing with them, so he was usually pretty annoyed.) Every time they yelled, Joe would tell them the next day how Mr. Snaggletooth doesn't like being interrupted and how mad he was. 

Once, maybe a week or two after it had started, my brother-in-law shouted up at Joe to knock it off and after a second or so Joe started screaming. Of course, my sister and brother-in-law run up there and Joe's fast asleep. They wake him up and Joe tells them how mad Mr. Snaggletooth was and how he'd grabbed Joe's arm and squeezed real hard. There's a red spot on the arm, but my sister figures he just managed to accidentally pinch himself in his sleep. My brother-in-law thinks it wasn't an accident and he was just faking the whole thing.

The next morning, Joe asks my sister to stop interrupting Mr. Snaggletooth because he's afraid Mr. Snaggletooth might hurt him if he gets too mad. It's at this point my sister starts wondering if she needs to maybe start taking Joe to a therapist. She doesn't, though, because he's so young and she didn't want him to think he'd done anything wrong. 

Well, things get a little worse. Even though my sister told him not to, her husband keeps yelling at Joe when he's talking in his sleep. And one day my sister goes up there to wake him up in the morning and Joe's not there. They both panic - long story short, they find Joe in the woods behind the house. He doesn't have any idea how he got there.

So now my sister's terrified that Joe might really hurt himself. She takes him to a therapist. The therapist just thinks it's night terrors and that he woke up in a fog and walked out of the house on accident. They make sure all of the doors are locked at night, and my brother-in-law promises not to yell anymore. And for one night, they don't hear anything, so they think it's okay. Except when they wake up in the morning, Joe's gone again. This time he makes it even further into the woods. 

My sister asks him why and Joe can't remember, but he says he thinks Mr. Snaggletooth was trying to show him something in the woods.

The next night, my sister sat outside the door to Joe's room while he slept, waiting to see if anything happened. She accidentally fell asleep and woke up in the middle of the night when she heard Joe screaming. After she woke him up, Joe got really angry and told her to stop snooping, because Mr. Snaggletooth really hates it when people try to snoop. 

Now they're back at therapy and they're talking about Joe maybe having to start taking anti-psychotics and we're all at a loss. Just yesterday, both my sister and brother-in-law accidentally fell asleep and somehow Joe snuck out and it took hours to find him because he'd wandered so far into the woods.  

I have no idea what the hell is going on and living so far away I feel totally helpless. Does anyone know anything about someone called Mr. Snaggletooth? Any clues or suggestions or *anything* is deeply appreciated. Thank you.

Totally. It was a good job. I was a photo editor at a stock photo company. There's hardly much you can do with a photography degree, but somehow, some way, I got a gig I actually loved.

I was very lucky. I also had a great girl. I was lucky that way, too. Right up until I wasn't.

May shot herself in front of me. There's no gentle way to say that. She just...shot herself. I knew she was sad, but I didn't think she was *that* sad, you know? And sometimes...sometimes I thought she was just fucking around. Making things up. Looking for sympathy. I should have known better. I really should have.

In the middle of an argument, in the middle of the night, May disappeared into her closet and when she came back she had a gun and she said, ""Why don't you ever listen to me?"" And then she shot herself. 

I fell apart afterwards. Everyone was real nice. Everyone understood. Work gave me forever to come back. Forever to work it out. But then forever started taking too long, so I went back. 

I was jittery. I thought I was listening when people were talking to me, but then they'd leave and I'd realize I hadn't heard a thing. Nothing got done. People started getting pissed. And that was *before* I started talking to myself.

Well, see, I was talking to myself, but it didn't seem that way at the time. I thought I was talking to May. Like we used to do. Dumb stuff. Funny stuff. We'd even argue sometimes. Just like before. 

Except May was dead and I was just talking to myself. Loudly. All day. 

Enough is enough. I didn't blame them when they said my position had been eliminated. But then I was jobless and I had only barely been able to manage paying for the apartment when I had a salary. So I was broke. 

It was my mom who suggested moving in with Nana. 

Nana was a riot. I remember her from when I was younger. She liked to play cards. She liked to drink wine and tell us funny stories from when she was a nurse in the Army. She was the sort who never ever wanted to retire. 

She'd had a stroke, though, and that was that. After that she was just holding on, doing every little thing in her power to stay out of an old folks home. If I went to live there, my mom said, it'd be good for both of us. Free food and rent for me. A free in-home nurse for Nana.

Win win.

I didn't want to do it, but I did. No better options. She didn't even have internet when I got there. I took the guest room on the first floor. She wanted to keep the master bedroom on the second floor, even though it didn't make any sense. She'd already had one of those liftchairs installed. She was fighting reality every step of the way.

That first night I remember - clear as day - the way she moaned in her sleep. I even raced up the stairs, thinking she was having a stroke. But she just cursed me out for waking her. The next night she made a show of locking her bedroom door, no matter how much I told her that was a bad idea.

I was up late that night. The guest bed was uncomfortable, so I sat up, reading. Somewhere in the night I thought I heard someone on the stairs. My first thought was that it was Nana. It took a full minute for me to realize how dumb that was. 

I came out to the living room and went to the stairs. There was no one. The downstairs was quiet, but I could hear Nana in her room, talking.

I crept up the stairs. Nana's voice was animated, but I couldn't make out what she was saying. 

I told myself it was a dream. A sleeping old woman talking to herself. But it made me uneasy. Eventually she quieted down and I went back to bed. Before I fell asleep, May was there, in my head.

""Your grandmother's nice,"" said May. ""How come you don't listen to her stories anymore?""

""Let me go to sleep,"" I said. ""You shouldn't be here.""

May laughed. ""Where should I be?""

""Let me go to sleep,"" I said. ""Just...let me go to sleep.""

And then I slept.

I didn't say anything to my grandmother the next day. There was nothing to say. I made her toast and took her to the Post Office. She watched TV the rest of the day while I tried to figure out who provided internet in her area. 

The next night was more of the same. Nana talking loudly in her sleep. Me, exhausted but awake.

""She's very unhappy,"" said May. ""Your grandmother. She's been unhappy since the stroke.""

""I know,"" I said. 

""Did you know she has a gun in her nightstand? I don't think she probably even knows how to use it.""

""A gun? There's no gun."" I slapped at the side of my head. I don't know why I always seem to think that'll help.

""There is,"" said May. ""It's loaded. And she's so sad. You know she doesn't want to be alive anymore.""

""I'm not going to *kill* my grandmother, if that's what you're implying,"" I said, turning over and flicking off the bedside lamp. ""Leave me alone. I just want to go to sleep.""

I don't know how long this went on. I really don't. But one day I dropped Nana off at physical therapy and went back to the house. I went to her room. I found the gun in the nightstand.

Whatever reason she had for wanting to keep a gun in her nightstand, it wasn't safe. So I took it downstairs and hid it in the guest bedroom.

That night Nana started screaming. It was terrifying. The most horrible sound I've ever heard. I went up and started pounding on the door. The screaming got worse. I yelled to her and told her to unlock the door, but she only screamed and screamed. I charged at the door, over and over again, but it didn't budge. Desperate, I fired a series of shots into the door, trying to blast off the lock. On the fifth shot the door sagged back. I burst through.

Nana was crouched on the floor beside the bed. Her eyes were white. Her hands were at her abdomen.

""She said you were coming,"" she whispered. ""She said you were coming to kill me.""

I dropped the gun on the floor and rushed to her side. She flinched, but didn't have the strength to cry out. Her hands were covered in blood. The whole front of her nightgown was covered in blood.

""There's one left, baby."" May was there. ""You left one for yourself.""

""It's alright, Nana,"" I said, squeezing my eyes shut tight. ""It's okay. I'll call an ambulance.""

""It's too late for an ambulance,"" whispered May. ""It's too late for saying you're sorry.""

Nana's eyes rolled into the back of her head. Her hands slumped at her sides. 

""You did such a good thing, baby,"" said May. ""You're almost done.""

""I can't,"" I said, pressing my hands to my ears. Nana's blood ran down the side of my face. ""I can't.""

""They won't forgive you,"" she said. ""But there's one left. Just for you.""

I opened my eyes. The gun was less than a foot away.

""It only takes one,"" said May.

My hand went to the gun. That's when I saw the blue lights twirling behind the curtains. 

And of course they don't believe me. Or maybe they do, but it doesn't matter. Someone needs to be responsible. It's right that it's me. I'm responsible. It's all my fault.

Kellen had been weak only once before - when he was seven years old and his father had returned from nothing, nowhere, no how. The old man in the scuffed leather jacket was there in the house, on the couch, cigarette at his lips when Kellen had come home from school, shepherding his younger brother and sister like a mother duck. 

*Sat there like he owned the place* thought Kellen, half-dreaming, slick with sweat, numb and tired as Dom was screaming something - something probably important - in his ear.

*Like he owned the damn place.*

Kellen hadn't recognized him at first. It'd been...how many? Four years? It wasn't the face he remembered, but the laugh - that wet, hissing cackle that always went on just a second too long. A laugh that never failed to send the dog off running. 

""What do you want?"" said Kellen after pushing his little brother and sister into the bedroom and closing the door. ""What are you doing here?""

""None of your business,"" said his father, leaning back in the couch, openly appraising his eldest son and making no bones about his distaste with what he saw. ""Where's your mother?""

""None of *your* business,"" said Kellen, so mad and scared his voice broke. ""Get out of here.""

""You don't tell me what to do,"" said the old man. ""Boys don't tell men what to do.""

""*Get out!*"" Kellen screamed. He felt dizzy with panic and rage. Even as the words were coming out he knew nothing good could come of them.

And nothing did. Or maybe something...

He hadn't gone to the hospital that day, even though he should have. He knew his mother couldn't afford it, so he cleaned himself as best he could and went to bed and hoped he'd wake up the next day. At least the sight of his ruined face had been enough to scare his father away. As a grown up, Kellen looked back at that day and realized his father was probably just on the one side of jail. Beating his son half to death was enough to spook the old man back into hiding. 

So that was good. And the weakness was good, too, in it's own way. Because when Kellen did wake up the next morning he swore he'd never let himself feel that way again. He'd never have to rely on empty threats. He'd make his threats real.

Years later - a few million dollars later - a few kids of his own later - a new lifetime of organized violence later - and here he was again. *Weak*. Slow. Pathetic. A ruined face. A fear he may not wake up tomorrow.

""Keep your fucking hands up!"" screamed Dom. Eddie was working quickly on the bloody, weeping bulb of flesh that was growing like a wad of radioactive cancer just under Kellen's left eye. ""You're not Ali and he's not wearin' himself out punching you in the goddamn head!""

Kellen nodded, mostly on instinct, hearing little to nothing of what anyone said. *Weak.*

The bell rang. Kellen lurched forward off his stool. *How many rounds to go?* he wondered. Was it almost over? Had it only just begun?

Lomas charged. He looked nearly untouched. Pristine, except for his white trunks, smeared as they were with Kellen's blood. He came ahead with a straight jab. Kellen deflected it with his right hand. But that was just the bait and Kellen did nothing about the right hook that chased it, except catch it on the chin and not fall down. 

The shots came in, silky and quiet, glancing off Kellen's arms and abdomen and face. 

*Weak.*

*That's fine*, thought Kellen, falling back into the ropes and grabbing Lomas around the shoulders. *This is what I'm here for. This is what I'm good for. Flesh to give and flesh to take.* 

He'd half died to protect his brother and sister and mother. And here was the other half. The borrowed half. He should have known he couldn't keep it forever.

Something - an uppercut, maybe - came in too hard to ignore. Kellen felt himself falling into a pitch black room. Everything was cold and he felt strangely naked in his trunks and gloves.

It didn't occur to him that it might be death. He just knew it wasn't sleep.

He found the floor of the blackness and lay there. It was quiet. He'd almost forgotten how loud the world was. It was peaceful in a way Kellen wasn't sure he'd ever experienced before. Had he ever really been somewhere quiet before?

There was a voice in the darkness. *Right,* thought Kellen. *I'm a fighter. And someone's always watching. They're always watching...waiting for you to fall...and then they're counting you down. Why do they always give you so little time to get back up?*

""Because you don't need it,"" said the voice.   

*Ha!* Kellen turned his head but there was nothing to see. *That's something Dom'd say. 'Real fighters get back up.'*

""It's true,"" said the voice. ""Fighters get back up. And you're a fighter. But that doesn't mean you have to be this.""

*A boxer? That's the* only *thing I know I am.* *That's how I fight. That's how I stay strong. That's how I protect and care for my family. I don't have anything else.*

""You have so much else."" Kellen thought maybe he could see a figure there in the darkness. A faint outline of a man or a woman or something, hovering just out of reach. ""You were never weak, Kellen. And you aren't weak now. Men lose. Our bodies fail us. We are born frail and die frail. But none of that is weakness. And you have always been strong - especially when you believed you were not.""

Kellen was not sure if he was crying. He felt too distant from his own body to know these things. But he thought he might be. *He only left because he was afraid he'd killed me. I wasn't strong enough to scare him off. I wasn't strong enough to defend my family. I just lay there and took it. And there was nothing I could do.*

The outlined form seemed to glow, just barely. ""There was nothing you could do and you still did something,"" said the voice. ""Strength now is being unafraid to recognize who you are and what you want.""

There was a countdown somewhere in the darkness. Kellen could hear it coming from somewhere in the distance.

*Three*

The darkness faded. The quiet faded. 

The lights went up. The world was filled with wild, senseless sound. And inside that sound there was...

*Four*

Kellen saw Dom and Eddie not so far away, screaming and slapping the canvas. Raising their hands. Motioning *Up! Up!*

*Five*

Kellen pulled his arms to his chest and slid to his knees.

*Six*

He was in a ball. Just like that night. Like a baby. *Weak.* *Helpless.*

*Seven* 

His brother and sister were crying that night. Crying over his cuts and bruises. His pain was their pain. But no one had touched them. No one had hit them. Or kicked them. Or whipped them. They'd been safe. He'd kept them safe.

*Eight*

Malena wanted him to quit boxing. George and Lucy were too young to know much about it, but Malena wanted him to be healthy enough to raise them. Healthy enough to see them through school, marriage, and life. Kellen wanted that, too.

*Nine*

Kellen pulled himself to his knees. He could see Dom and Eddie frantic - imploring him to his feet. He was the champ. He'd get the benefit of the doubt. The fight would go on. The fight would go on.

*Ten*

Kellen bowed his head and kissed the canvas.

Clarence Applebright is dead and there's a really good chance I'm completely fucked now.

It really shouldn't be this way. Clarence was the *Chosen One.* This was...this was universally fucking accepted, okay? He fit the goddamn prophecy to a TEE. Born on a moonless night. Sandwiched between two separate trios of triplets. His father **had no heart** (*Born of a man with no heart*...he's got an artificial heart, for fuck's sake! How the hell else are you supposed to interpret that??)

Clarence was going to defeat the Lord of Quiet. He had to. That's the deal, right? Otherwise, what's the fucking point of a goddamn prophecy?!?

So, and I think this was pretty fucking reasonable, I made *sure* to make friends with Clarence. First day of school. BOOM. Who's there when the other kids are all super weirded out by the prophecy kid? Me. That's who. Sit with him at lunch. Study together. I even started collecting fucking Pokemon cards so he'd have someone with a similar hobby. *I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GODDAMN POKEMON*. 

Through all the trials and tribulations, I was there. When the evil kids tried to start shit, I stood next to Clarence and took my ass beatings like a man. We were a team. We were in it together. The Chosen One and his indispensable sidekick. Goofy, brave Perry. The one you could always count on. A sneaky crowd favorite, you might even say.

So what happens? *CLARENCE GODDAMN FUCKING APPLEBRIGHT DIES IN A GODDAMN FUCKING SKIING ACCIDENT*. Are you serious? Are you absolutely SERIOUS? This is the *Chosen One*. A LITERAL prophecy foretold of his triumph over evil. How many times have you heard of a prophecy like that? And how many times has the hero *completely and utterly fucked it while on vacation in Aspen?*

The Chosen One. Seriously. And who was going to stand by him and support him and *maybe* get some secondhand trim in the process? Me. Who's the real victim here? Me. Who's the one who's been thumbing his nose at evil and telling off supporters of the Lord of Quiet because he was so goddamn sure that his best friend the *goddamn fucking HERO* was going to triumph in the end? Me.

You know, I could have chosen evil all those years ago. The evil kids always threw the best parties all through school. And the evil girls were notoriously easy. But no. I had to go on *goddamn fucking ADVENTURES* with that nearsighted asshat. Fight giant bats. Defeat ancient stone monsters. I was cursed by a witch for an entire semester once, did you know that? I shit myself every time I used a vowel. 

But it was fine. The benefits outweighed the sacrifices, because my best friend was the hero. The Chosen One.

Shit.

Well, fuck it. I'm just gonna tell everyone I was a double agent the whole time. That works sometimes, right?

The most unnerving thing, I think, was that Tom Jennings had a large bowl of popcorn at his hip and a cooler full of beer slung across his back, like some sort of fat, Sunday afternoon Rambo.

It seemed a dream at first. People watch me in my dreams - that's a common theme. Friends, lovers, and strangers all. Active and inactive. Rearranged faces and personalities. It's a crowded scene, to be sure. But it makes sense there, because I'm doing interesting things. Wild, violent, oft-times inappropriate things. Here I was simply drinking a glass of water in my jocks. Hardly seemed worth the effort.

They all looked a bit shifty as I moved to the window. I counted 20 at least, though a few at the back had already shuffled off into the darkness.

Glass in hand, I opened the front door and stepped outside.

""Eh?"" I said, shoulders bobbing in inquisition.

Laura Golden smiled weakly. ""So, you're awake then?""

""Appears so,"" I said, taking another sip. 

""For good?"" said Tammy Nguyen.

""Hard to say,"" I replied. ""You all...waiting for something?""

""Perhaps,"" said Laura. ""Think maybe you ought to go back to sleep?""

I shrugged. ""I'm not against it. What about you all?""

""Go to sleep!"" shouted Tom Jennings through a mouthful of popcorn.

""Now what's that to you?"" I asked, stepping down off my small porch. ""And why're you all out here anyway? Peeping in my house?""

Tammy shook her head. ""No reason in particular.""

""Walk,"" said Tom through another heaping handful of popcorn.

""You're all out on a walk together?"" I said. ""At 3am? On my lawn?""

""Good stars tonight,"" said Tammy hopefully. ""Good for walking.""

I sighed. Something seemed not quite right, though I wasn't sure what. ""I don't suppose I'll go back to sleep tonight. Might read. Or watch the stars with you all.""

""No!"" said Tammy. ""You wouldn't like them. Not your kind of stars.""

I frowned. ""You know what kind of stars I like?""

Tammy nodded. ""Not these ones.""

Laura stepped forward. ""I think we need to be honest.""

""Shut up, Laura,"" said Tom. But Laura ignored him and pressed forward.

""You...well, you're really rather *animated* when you sleep. You know that?""

I shook my head. ""I don't know much about what I'm like when I'm asleep.""

Laura smiled, a bit brighter this time. ""Well, you know, some people talk in their sleep, right? And some people walk in their sleep. But you...it's kinda like you do a one-man show in your sleep.""

""Say again?"" I grunted.

""It's great!"" shouted someone from the back of the crowd. ""Go back to sleep!"" shouted someone else.

""You, uh, act it out,"" said Laura. ""Your dreams, I think. You act them out and you narrate them and you just...wow, they're just so much *fun*.""

""We called the cops on you the first time,"" said Tammy. ""We thought you were killing someone.""

""Yeah, but then the cop just hung out and watched the whole thing,"" said Laura. ""Said it was better than a movie. And ever since, we've...""

I blinked and cleared my throat. ""You've been watching me sleep every night?""

""Well, not *tonight*,"" said Tom bitterly.

""We'll stop,"" said Laura. ""If you want, we'll stop. Won't we?""

Reluctantly, the various heads in the crowd nodded their assent. 

""It's just...they're great stories,"" said Laura. 

They all muttered their agreement and then began to leave, slowly and more than a little awkwardly.

""Wait,"" I said, draining the last of my water. ""Look, I don't really much care what you all get up to at night. I just know I'm tired."" I winked at Laura. ""I think I'm gonna go back to sleep.""

They cheered and huddled together outside the window, expectant and alive, like little kids at the movie theater. I closed the front door and dropped the empty glass in the sink, before sinking back into bed.

*Maybe*, I thought, *this is a dream, too.* And maybe it was. But I hoped it wasn't. After all, what's the good of a brand new story if you can't share it with anyone else?   ",winsomeman,A Dream Like No Other (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/535ky1/a_dream_like_no_other_wp/

_________________________________________________

It had been a mistake to wake her. Ven saw that plainly now. But, all things considered, it had *seemed* a good idea at the time.

They'd kept her on display for more centuries than anyone had the decency to count. Up on the 400th floor of the old Moon Spire, in a glass room, surrounded by other heirlooms of a lost society. *The Great Baroness* the placard read, *A witch and seer, wife to half a hundred short-lived husbands, with an empire that threatened to conquer every last livable quadrant of space, she was known chiefly for her tactical aptitude (unparalleled), her ruthlessness (immeasurable), and her beauty (clearly debatable). Captured by the brave Star Sailors of Ganymede, she was spared death by Rorsch the Wise, who suggested the more humbling and potentially educational punishment you see before you.*

Ven had first visited the display when he was just a boy. The stories made his skin crawl. As did the woman's wide, determined stare, which seemed to sweep out from behind the translucent plating and lock in upon anyone foolish enough to stare back. Still, Ven had to admit that she cut an alluring figure in almost every way. Of course, nothing about her facial features - plaited blond hair, thin mouth, full, red lips, high, arching cheekbones, *two* eyes - was even remotely attractive, at least not in the classical sense. Even so, deformed though she appeared, Ven felt his heart beat just a step quicker whenever he looked at her. It was not just her look, however, so much as it was her *aura*. Even as she stood there, still as death, she *still* conveyed such a undeniable power and poise.

And that is why Ven convinced himself that she would be perfect for the revolution.

They lacked *leaders*, and that included Ven, who was ever playing at leader, but knew he wasn't the solution. He could not muster the necessary charisma and his ideas were flat, uninspired. Essentially, he wasn't really good for much more than booking a convenient room at a reasonable rate. 

One day, as they bemoaned their collective lack of spark, Ven's inner-eye flashed back to the Moon Spire, and the room on the 400th floor. 

""A frozen old witch?"" Gom had said.

""She's ancient history,"" said Axo with a lopsided snarl. ""What's the good there?""

""A *queen*,"" Ven had said. ""A conqueror. The greatest of the great. Why'd you think they froze her instead of just killing her? To *remember*! To remember what to be afraid of. And guess what? They all forgot. So I say - let's remind them.""

If they'd had any hope at all - anything that could pass for the beginnings of an idea - they'd have also forgotten her. But there was nothing. So they said, ""Yes."" And they set themselves to waking the sleeping ""beauty"".

That was an exciting bit of work, fueled by righteousness and boredom. They plotted and planned the better part of 0.85 solars. The effort wasn't wasted.

Guards were neutralized. Systems were cracked. Overrides were bypassed. 

An artifact came to life.

They stole her away, each of them alive with excitement and terror, marveling at what they'd done and wondering where it would take them.

It did not take them any place expected.

As soon as the old *Queen of the Black Void* had her wits about her, they worked to get her up to speed - language, history, culture, politics, the lot. She listened, hardly speaking, rarely asking questions, always absorbing. Finally, one day, she motioned to Ven, drawing him off to the side.

""Gom is weak,"" she said, quietly, but not in a whisper. ""Fio is unskilled. Brun is merely stupid. These should be culled, and quickly, before they dilute our collective power.""

""*Culled*?"" said Ven, wobbling his cranial stem. 

""They weaken us,"" said the Baroness. ""We cannot bear flaws in the crew, Ven. We are not strong enough yet.""

""That...would be hypocritical,"" said Ven, somewhat cautiously. ""We're revolting against the powerful. We can't disregard our own weak if...""

""No,"" said the Baroness, shaking her head. ""No revolt. No revolution. We go to the stars. We fly. We steal. We build our empire.""

""Empire? That's not...""

""Your revolution is nothing,"" she said. ""There is rule and there is conquest. We do not rule, so we must conquer. To conquer we must acquire assets. Weapons. Food. Supplies. We must build wealth and use it to gain allies. Do you understand?""

Ven did not understand, not truly. But he understood what he had seen in that display room, all those years earlier - a leader. 

""Yes,"" he said, feeling like he was waking from his own millennia of sleep. ""They...they don't say your name,"" he said. ""The books. The museum. None of it says what your name is.""

The Baroness laughed. ""I've had many. But you may call me Aurora.""

""Aurora,"" Ven whispered. It was a good name, he thought. The kind of name one might feel inclined to scream as they charged into a sea of fire and blood and dark matter.

""I still don't get it.""

John laughed, which pushed his swing ever so slightly to the right, ax head biting into the rim of the log, which flew sideways off the stump, nearly clipping little Mallory in the ear.

""Who's fightin' in the box?"" said Mallory. 

John shook his head as he stooped to retrieve the cracked log. ""It really isn't important, little one. Nothing to do with us.""

That, of course, wasn't a satisfactory answer. ""Well, can I see it again?""

""There's hardly anything to see,"" said John, setting the log on the stump and raising the ax. ""Besides, those solar cells don't work so good. Takes a while to work up a charge.""

""You said they were fightin',"" said Mallory firmly, the one good fact she could hold on to. ""People aren't supposed to fight. *You* said that. People fought and it did all sorts of bad things to the world. So if they're fightin', we should...""

""They're not people,"" said John, slamming his ax into the bare stump. He knew his daughter well enough to know this wasn't a thing that was going away without a struggle and he wasn't in a mood to struggle. ""It's computers.""

Mallory opened her mouth, but John cut her off.

""Okay, computers. Well, computers are machines of a sort. And there was a time when we used them to help us do all sorts of things. We made 'em, you see, but they were smarter than us, in a way. They could do more. And what they did, they did faster. So, we used them to do lots of good stuff. And eventually we started using them to do a lot of bad stuff. We used them to help us fight each other.""

""Okay,"" said Mallory. It was pretty clear from the angle of her head that she hardly understood a quarter of what her father was saying, but she knew not to interrupt the flow of information, scarce as it often was.

""So computers were better at fightin' then people were and..."" John carefully considered his words. ""Things didn't go well for people. We couldn't quite keep up. The fightin' went on and people...there were less and less people all the time, until there were hardly any people at all. You understand?""

""Killed 'em,"" said Mallory, nodding.

""Killed each other,"" said John.

""Didn't kill *us*,"" said Mallory.

""We came after,"" said John, with a smile. ""Don't take credit you didn't earn. But anyway, after awhile there weren't really any people fightin', but the computers never stopped, because...well, we never told them to.""

""Like leavin' the lights on?"" suggested Mallory.

""A bit,"" said John. ""Like we turned on the lights, but forgot to put in an off switch.""

""Okay,"" said Mallory. ""But the box? Were they always...?""  

""No,"" said John, shaking his head. He pointed out across the green-gray plain. ""They were everywhere back then. In everything. In other machines. Things that flew. Things that swam. Things that drove over the ground and crushed other things. There used to be....well, there used to be a lot of everything out here.""

""Instead of a lot of nothing?""

""Exactly. Our computers were hunting their people, and their computers were hunting down our people and it just went on until it was basically their computers and our computers fightin' each other.""

""'Cause the people were gone,"" said Mallory.

""Yes ma'am."" John sighed. ""But remember I said the computers were smarter than us, right? Well, I think they realized one day they weren't fightin' people any more and so fightin' the way people fight didn't make any sense. Was just wasteful. They kept fightin', they just...went indoors, I suppose.""

""The box?""

John nodded. ""C'mon."" He lead the girl into the little wooden house he'd built with his own two hands. Margaret was at the stove, face obscured in the steam of a boiling pot. On the west side of the house, there was a cord leading in through the frame of the window. At the end of the cord was a small black device, not much bigger than the palm of John's hand. He pulled out the cord and depressed a hidden button on the outer rim. The black face glowed white and green. John ran his finger across the screen, down, then up, then right, then down again. The screen winked over to a grid of small, colorful images. He depressed one of the images.

""There they are!"" said Mallory, excited.

John nodded. ""Right. That's them. The computers we made to fight against each other. They're still at it.""

""Will they ever stop?"" Lights flashed and flickered across the screen. There was a sound like thunder and a rattle like shattering glass.

""I don't suppose they will,"" said John. ""Not unless one side wins, and I don't know how that'd ever happen. But at least it's all just here. Just inside this box. An endless war and it never touches us.""

""So we're safe?"" said Mallory, eyes glued to the screen.

""For now,"" said John. ""As long as we don't forget.""

Mallory smiled. ""We won't,"" she said, finger running lovingly across the screen. ""Of course we won't."" ",winsomeman,Behind Glass (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/52obte/behind_glass_wp/

Maggie wants kids, but I'm not entirely sure Maggie knows what kids *are*. Maggie thinks kids are those small, little people wearing miniature coveralls and riding in the basket of grocery carts, mewling nonsense and bubbling happy balls of sputum when they see a cartoon cereal mascot whose work they particularly enjoy. She thinks kids are those little, bowling ball-shaped fashion accessories athletic men sometimes strap to their chest while they're out multitasking in fitted polo shirts. She thinks kids are funny and fun. She thinks they're adorable.

I love Maggie, but sometimes she's a real moron.

She's also stubborn as hell.

So when we became eligible for the parenting exam, I knew a simple *No thanks, I think babies are worse than the fucking plague* would not have sufficed. No worries. I had a plan. I was going to tank the test. 

It couldn't be that hard. Lots of people tanked it all the time. With the population so far out of control and supplies in the red, they didn't want just *any* idiot having a baby. Well, here stands an idiot. And believe me, I can get a lot stupider if the need arises.

So I took the test, being sure to preface things with a lengthy, impassioned speech about why I was worried I wouldn't be ""good enough."" Maggie patted my hand and kissed my cheek and sent me on my way.

""As long as you do your best,"" she'd said.

Third question: WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON GENETIC MANIPULATION?

Easy. *BIG DICK = GREAT LIFE.*

Fourth question: IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD NOT DO FOR YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER?

Hmm. *Math, genocide, period stuff.*

Rose awoke in the little, blue room. Harry was asleep at her side, head pressed against the wooden bars of the crib. And just like that, Rose felt another wave of shuddering sickness pass over her. She shook, and shook so badly that it rattled the old radiator and woke Harry.

Harry blinked and pulled himself upright, rubbing the side of his head. Disoriented, he looked around the little blue room, eyes sweeping over the hand-painted jungle mural, the small wardrobe, the trio of picture frames hung on the wall. Finally his eyes flowed down to Rose.

""It wasn't a dream, was it?""

Rose couldn't do much more than shake her head. 

Harry turned to look at the crib. His father had built the crib. Intricate slats. A half moon and stars carved in the upper bridge of the frame. Small, white mattress. Rumpled blue blanket.

How could any space so small be so empty?

""How could we?"" said Rose. ""Why did we...?""

Harry couldn't bring himself to touch the blanket, desperate though he was to bring it up to his face and smother himself in whatever it was that had been left behind. 

""We didn't have a choice,"" he said.

""We did,"" said Rose, visibly fighting back a rising tide of hysteria. ""We *did*. We could have *fought*.""

""We would have all died,"" said Harry. ""You know that. The places where they fought...there's no one left there, Rose. There's *no one*.""

""I'd rather that,"" said Rose, rising to her knees and moving towards the crib. She reached out for the blanket and Harry, on instinct, moved to block her. She didn't have the strength to fight past him. ""I'd rather we were all dead. We deserve to be dead.""

""No,"" said Harry. ""We don't. There are still children here. Children older than Michael. And children still to be born. Think about them.""

""I can't,"" said Rose. ""All I can think about is Michael. *Our* son. And how we let them take him. How we let them take *all* the little boys and girls. Our *children*, Harry! We just let them take them all away. And now what? We start over? We go on? What does that mean, Harry? What? *They took Michael!* I want Michael back!""

""I do, too,"" said Harry. ""And I always will. But this is what we were given. The choice to sacrifice and live, or all die. I don't understand it. I don't. But we can't change it.""

Rose finally allowed herself to cry. She cried harder even than she had the night before, when they had stood beside the crib and watched their infant son disappear. At least he had been asleep. At least he was not afraid. 

""Is he alive?"" said Rose after the storm had passed.

""I don't know,"" said Harry. ""They never said what they would do with the children, just that...""

Rose nodded. She wrapped her arms tight around her shoulders. ""What if they come back?""

Harry considered this. With shaking hands, he reached out and brushed his fingers across the top of the blue blanket. It was shockingly cold to the touch.

""I hope they do,"" he said at last. ""I hope they do. We're not the same people we were yesterday. And by tomorrow...""

SUBJECT: *Tilmont, Ronald J.*

*Interview conducted at the Medio County Courthouse, 2017.3.12*

ATTENDING WITNESSES: Hon. Judge Melissa H. Yadir, Hon. Judge Kurt F. Nguyen, Mr. James T. Vamos (Clerk), Ms. Vanessa K. Klingsbeard (Intern, notes)

_________________________________________________

YADIR: Please state your name.

TILMONT: Ronnie Jamie Tilmont. Hi. Thanks for having me.

YADIR: Mr. Tilmont...

TILMONT: Ronnie's good.

YADIR: Mr. Tilmont, you just returned from a week spent among the general population at the Lower Geneva City Men's Correctional Facility, is that correct?

TILMONT: Yes. And it's Ronnie.

NGUYEN: Mr. Tilmont can you brief us on your experiences at the facility?

TILMONT: Great. Really great. You been? It's real nice.

NGUYEN: Can you provide some more detail?

YADIR: What made it ""great""?

TILMONT: Oh, well. First of all, I'm a people-person. So you throw me in a crowd of new faces and all I see is a crowd of new friends. See what I'm saying? And what a crowd you got down there! I couldn't hardly turn my head and cough without coming face-to-face with a new friend.

NGUYEN: Are you suggesting that conditions were potentially over-crowded?

TILMONT: Oh no! I'm not the claustrophobic type. The opposite actually. Afraid of open spaces. I grew up with seven older brothers and we all shared the one room. I get a little shaky if I don't have an elbow or two digging into me at all times.

YADIR: You shared a single room with seven brothers?

TILMONT: Yes ma'am. We slept all stacked up like a cord of firewood. 

YADIR: How many people were in your cell at Lower Geneva?

TILMONT: Not enough.

NGUYEN: Not enough?

TILMONT: Had a whole bed to myself. Sort of wasteful. Thankfully, one of my bunkmates offered to let me shove in with him. Named Corkscrew. Isn't that a funny name? Never did remember to ask him where that came from.

YADIR: Mr. Tilmont...

TILMONT: Ronnie.

YADIR. Mr. Tilmont, can you run us through a typical day at Lower Geneva?

TILMONT: Yes, definitely. So first thing, I usually woke up on the floor and I was usually sorta damp. I'm a pretty sound sleeper - comes from having seven older brothers - but I think maybe Corkscrew must have had nightmares or something. And maybe he might've been a drooler? Not sure. Anyway, first thing I get up off the ground and we all go to the mess for breakfast. 

YADIR: Did you find the food there nutritional and the servings adequate? 

TILMONT: More than. Big, big bowls of oatmeal, which I love. This was a bit saltier than I usually like it. A bit gooier, too, but real good. Corkscrew and Hatchet-Face - that's his real name, I kid you not - they always made sure to get my food for me while I held their spots at the table.

NGUYEN: You ate with the same...collection of men often?

TILMONT: Oh yeah. Corkscrew. Hatchet-Face. Bitchtits. Webo. Baby Stomper. And The Gargoyle. Those were my best friends while I was there. We called ourselves the Master Race. i think because maybe they all liked car racing or something?

YADIR: The Master Race?

TILMONT: Yes ma'am. I'm not actually a car racing enthusiast, but fortunately that never really came up while I was there.

NGUYEN: What happened after breakfast?

TILMONT: Oooh. Lots of fun. Usually we got to go outside. Corkscrew and us all had a cool spot near the dumpster. So we'd hang out and do push ups and just talk and talk. It was fun hearing all the gossip. Bitchtits has this girl waiting for him on the outside and boy, is he ever an open book. Kind of a graphic book, at that. I feel like I've known Cinnamon all my life and I've never even met the girl! 

YADIR: Did your...friends...ever come into any conflict with other...groups of friends?

TILMONT: Sadly, yes. Yes, they did. Baby Stomper did get in a bit of trouble near the end of the week for playing a little too rough with this guy they called The Weedsmith. There was some blood, but that's, you know, that's boys getting too rowdy, I think. 

NGUYEN: Was anyone violent with you personally?

TILMONT: Violent? No. There's horseplay, of course. And being new friends, Corkscrew had some initiations he wanted me to do, but that's all pretty standard I'd imagine.

NGUYEN: Can you elaborate on these initiations?

TILMONT: Technically, I don't believe I'm allowed to, no.

YADIR: You can't tell us what this Corkscrew did to you?

TILMONT: Not unless you're members of the Master Race, no, I don't believe so.

YADIR: Alright. Um. Mr. Tilmont...

TILMONT: Ronnie.

YADIR: Can you provide us with some final thoughts on your experience?

TILMONT: Let's see. Great fun. Good friends. I even lost a couple pounds. All in all, if you like people and you're good at carrying stuff in your butt, I highly recommend prison. 

YADIR: Thank you for your service, Mr. Tilmont.

TILMONT: It's Ronnie. And you're welcome.  ",winsomeman,A Good Place to Make Friends (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/51iw2v/a_good_place_to_make_friends_wp/

It's is now your 21st birthday, and you receive a mysterious bank key in the mail. The vault it opens contains $550,000... In nickels.*
______________________________________________

I considered the pile of nickels. Stacks and stacks and stacks, lined neatly in precariously tall rows. 

""And it's...?""

The bank manager smiled wanly. ""$550,000. Sir, I'm not clear on *why* you have so many nickels, but hording coins of any denomination does create shortages. I must presume that additional nickels have been minted simply to cover for this...""

""But how many is it?"" I asked, still hardly comprehending. 

""Nickels? It's eleven million. I think you can see how that might represent a significant hardship for the money lending industry, as there are generally less than a hundred million in circulation at any one time.""

I shook my head. ""I need to leave this here. I don't..."" I backed away from the vault. 

""We can convert it for you, sir,"" said the bank manager. ""But it will take some time and there will be forms to fill out. You may receive an inquiry from the National Reserve regarding how you came to possess so many nickels.""

""Okay,"" I said, half-awake, half in a dream. ""I'll come back.""

*Nickels. Nickels. Nickels.*

Why did I have a vault full of nickels? Millions of nickels?

On my 21st birthday I had received an envelope in the mail. It contained a vault key and the name of a nearby bank. I assumed it was a joke. But the money was real. The *nickels* were real.

I stood at the bus stop, unsure where to go or what to do. How could I trace the envelope? If I alerted the government would they help me find whoever sent the key? And would I be able to keep any of the money?

""You earned it, you know."" 

I continued to stand, staring blankly at the road. I didn't assume they were speaking to me.

""John? It's *your* money. You earned it, fair and square.""

The mention of my name made me turn. An older man in a white cotton suit sat on the bench behind me.

""Excuse me?"" I said. ""Are you talking to me?""

Only as I said it did I finally notice that we were the only two people at the bus top. The man was gracious enough to ignore the question.

""The money, John. Don't give it away. It's yours. Earned coin-by-coin.""

I took a step closer. The man's face was obscured by a line of shadow cast off the brim of his panama hat. ""Do I know you?""

""You may not remember me John, it's been a very long time. We met when you were younger. We made a deal. You set the terms for your employment. Do you remember?""

""I..."" The man *did* seem familiar, but only in the vaguest of ways. ""No. We met when I was a kid and you...what? Hired me?""

""In a manner of speaking,"" said the man, white teeth flashing in a brief smile. ""You asked for a nickel a head. That was how you planned to make your fortune, and now look. Your fortune is made.""

""*A nickel a head*?"" I began to feel deeply uneasy, not because the man was a stranger, but because he felt increasingly familiar with every moment. ""What does that mean?""

""I think maybe you were boasting John, but you said - said loudly - that if you had a nickel for everyone you killed, you'd be rich. And that is a very good rate, John. On this and any other world. So I hired you. We shook hands and I promised to make payment on your 21st birthday.""

Like a dying thunderstorm, the veils in my mind began to pull back, the static subsiding. I remembered, still vaguely, a birthday party and laughter and saying funny things and an old man in a fine white suit laughing with me and shaking my hand. Some other boy's grandfather I had assumed. Someone who belonged there, stopping to make a boy feel heard. But the man on the bench was no older than the man at the party. Same suit. Same panama hat.

""I've never killed anyone,"" I said. ""Not a one.""

""Eleven million, exact,"" said the old man. ""I've kept a ledger. I like things by the book.""

""I haven't though,"" I said, feeling strangely desperate. Why? Why should I feel uneasy? If I had killed even *one* person wouldn't I be in jail?

""Oh,"" said the man, as if suddenly understanding my confusion. ""Not here. Not on *Earth*. Not during the *day*.""

""What does that mean? Where else...?""

""You're a well-traveled man,"" said the old man. ""Or a well-traveled boy, I suppose. Either way, you have gone far and done much, even if you don't quite recall it. Though, I think if you tried, you might recall a part of it.""

""I don't have any idea what you're...""

""Think to the last one, then,"" said the old man. ""You ought remember that at least. It wasn't that long ago. You went to a world of thin men and women, almost as if the people of your world had been pulled a bit too tightly, with long, spidery fingers and red skin. Thin, red warriors. Think of that. Picture that. And remember yourself among them, with a glowing sword and blood in your mouth, cutting and cutting and *cutting*. Wild, screaming. A berserker. Hacking flesh until there was none left to oppose you. Does that ring with you?""

It did. 

""That was a dream. That was a dream."" I remembered waking in wet, knotted sheets. Gloria said I had thrashed so much she'd had to sleep on the couch.

""That was your *work*,"" said the old man. ""You do it well. That's why I'm here, actually. I told you I would pay you at your 21st birthday. That's when the terms of our original deal expired. A nickel a head. I think you're worth far more than that, dear John. I would like to re-open negotiations. How would you feel about continuing your service?""

This couldn't be real. That's what I told myself. Another dream. A delusion. The nickels. The man. None of it *could* be real. 

But if that were true...then where would the harm be?

___________________________________________

*Pray for rain.*

Half-frozen gobs of congealed alien gasses thwump down on the plastiform hut. 

*Like prairie hail.*

Marcy 00-213 rests in the corner of the makeshift shed. The green-yellow strip of foss-light above casts branching shadows all along the underside of her Quad-Wing. She regards her ship - the white scorch marks across both underwings; the peeled *Diamondhead* decal; the broken fuel cover; the black crust creeping outward from the barrel of both plug-blasters.

*Another day. Another day.*

It doesn't fly in the rain - the black wingless orb she'd taken to calling the ""Stymph"" after the man-eating Stymphalian birds of ancient, ancient legend. Marcy's Quad *could* fly in the rain. She was fast enough, nimble enough. But the rain was the only chance she had to rest. When the rain stopped, she would have to stow the hut and take off once more. She would have to run.

She was convinced now that she was the last of them. 

The *Diamondhead* battalion had been four dozen ships strong at the start of the conflict. In the valley theater, the enemy had numbered only ten and none of those were anything larger than a short range cruiser. 

The *Diamondhead* was meant to sweep the valley and crush the small complement stationed there. They had nearly done that - until the arrival of the Stymph.

Marcy tries to close her eyes. The thrumming of the hail races out ahead of her heart's own manic beat. 

*Run and hide. Run and hide.*

Reports from other battalions came in slowly, all traditional methods of communication ground to splintered, squalling nonsense by the constant radiation-laced wind, rain, and hail storms. Only once *Diamondhead* had been successfully halved did they finally receive by then-ancient transmissions from *Opalwing* and *Jadeheart* warning them to scatter, to flee, to avoid the valley at all costs. The Stymph had cut through those battalions just as easily as it had *Diamondhead*.

Marcy had considered the possibility that she was not simply the last of her battalion, but the last of *any* of the advance guard. That she was alone on an alien planet. And what would that mean? The last to die is still dead, after all.
 
""But not dead,"" whispers Marcy. ""Not dead yet.""

She punches an inelegant series of instructions into the panel embedded within the underside of her forearm. Immediately her Quad-Wing begins to hum. Panels of the plastiform hut peel away, folding into themselves. The hail screams as the sound-dampeners shut down. A faint smokey outline appears above the Quad-Wing where the hail begins battering the ship's topside pressure-guard. The last of the hut compacts into a narrow box that slides into a joint between the ship's back landing prongs.

*Diamondheads do not abandon their post.* That thought had kept Marcy pinned down for a day and a half, considering the futility of a counterattack. But they needed to be warned. That was all she could realistically accomplish. Escape the atmosphere. Send a warning. 

As Marcy ascends to the cockpit, however, she looks up. The pressure-guard is invisible. The hail has stopped. The rain is over.

Orange and red lights spear down through the brown-black weave of stratus. 

Marcy locks herself into the pilot's chair. Ignites fusion. The thrust-cycle begins.

The tac-display blinks white. The sensor warning pings gently, urgently. 

*It's coming. It's coming.*

The thrust-cycle clicks through. Launch in 10.

The ping grows in intensity. The tac-display shows a vessel to the south-southwest. Coming fast. Coming low.

Marcy warms both plug-blasters.

*I'm not going to make it. I'm not going to make it.*

The nav-plac requests an initial coordinate drop. Marcy defers. 

*Manual. Has to be manual.*

The thrust-cycle completes. There's a punch and a push. The roar competes with the angry sonic jangle of the sensor pings. It's nearly on her. It's nearly there.

The Quad-Wing rejects the earth below with stunning, violent urgency. 

The ping is a steady, scolding whine.

*It's here.*

________________________________________________

The letter didn't interest Bal so much as the fact that it even got to him in the first place.

""You are not an easy man to find,"" said the DSL driver, picking twigs out of his pant legs. ""Never had to deliver to GPS coordinates before. Somebody must have really wanted you to have this, sending it all the way out here.""

""Ah,"" said Bal, regarding the letter in his hands, an off-white envelope sealed in wax. ""I don't have any cash or I'd...""

""Can't take tips anyway, so no worries,"" said the deliveryman. ""Besides, I get the impression this whole set-up cost a pretty penny to start. You have a nice day.""

Bal nodded and closed the door. He knew who the letter was from. He even knew what it said, but he opened it anyway, holding out some vain, foolish hope it might mean something else. But no. It was Trace. It was time for another contest.

His first instinct was to tear the paper in two and throw it in the fire. But then Elizabeth's face came to him. She and her curly auburn hair and amber eyes, flecked all through with silver and violet.

The last of them. His grandchild, eight generations removed. The last of the line he'd started with Ellie Cole in the foothills of Tennessee, all those lifetimes ago. Back before he knew any better. 

*Why did it take so long to figure it out?* he asked himself. *Was there ever a slower learner than me?*

They'd all died. All the lines - and he'd started so many. More than Bal cared to count. The mathematical improbability was not lost on him. 

""We're meant to be alone,"" Gwen had explained to him, so many centuries before. ""You can try and deny it. You can try and fight it. But in the end, that's where you'll be - alone.""

Bal re-read the sprawling cursive of the letter. ""And as always, the first prize is death,"" it read, before adding just below, ""(Sorry folks, the rest of you have to live.)"" 

It was a joke. A cruel, cruel joke. 

And yet, it was the only hope Bal had.
_______________________________________________________________

There were more than even Bal might have guessed. Three hundred, at least. Four hundred? Bal laughed. *Of course.* Why should he be the only one to feel what he felt? They had all watched thousands of blood kin die. Lovers. Children. All dead. Of course they would chase Trace's prize. *Of course.*

Trace, for her part, seemed more pleased with herself than ever. She swaggered across the stage of the rented auditorium, soaking it in. 

""So many? So many."" Her voice echoed even without a microphone. She had long ago learned how to speak with volume. ""Is it so bad, this living? So bad? *I* like it. I like it quite a lot actually. I wonder...hmm. I wonder if maybe you all simply aren't appreciating things the way you should. Is it that? Is it that, you think?""

She paused as if waiting for someone to actually respond. No one took the bait. ""Maybe death isn't what you need. Maybe it's *appreciation*. Huh? What do you think of that? What if we do a contest and the winner learns to appreciate life just a *little* bit more? There's a prize. There's a prize. I like that. What do you say?""

Bal was surprised to find himself standing up. ""Fuck off, Trace. Tell us the rules and let's move on.""

Bal reclaimed his seat to a chorus of loud assent. Trace frowned. ""You know...you *know*, I don't have to have these little contests at all. You know that, right? This is for you, you miserable little crybabies. This is for *you!*""

A woman near the door - her name was Tila and Bal remembered her in Rome with olive leaves in her hair - stood up and began to walk out. Everyone made to follow her.

""Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine, you big babies,"" sneered Trace. ""Come back. I'll tell you the rules. Come on. Sit, sit, sit. Sit down. Impatient. Alright, we've had some fun contests in the past, haven't we? Feats of strength and skills and tenacity and all that rubbish. Well, for this contest, I'd like to challenge another one of your skills. One you've all no doubt been finely honing over the years. Your skill as manipulators.""

This caused a low murmur to spread through the auditorium. 

""You know it's true,"" said Trace. ""Comes from spending so much time with humans. I know you all know how to get what you want. So here's what I want. I want you...to convince someone...to kill someone else...on your behalf.""

The murmur turned to an uproar.

""I thought we agreed we'd never have to kill anyone with these damn contests,"" shouted a man sitting in the back.

""You aren't,"" said Trace, holding up her hands. ""Someone else is doing the killing *for* you. And - AND - I don't mean contract killing. That's killing for *money*. I want someone to kill someone else because they think it will make you happy. I want you to make someone love you so much they're willing to kill for you - and then actually do it! How wonderful! Now *that's* living! Am I right? I'm right. I know I am.""

There was more yelling and more furious discussion, but Bal didn't hear any of it. He'd already left the auditorium.
_____________________________________________________________

Seven months later, Bal met Rachel in the rust-colored canyonland of Utah. She was lost. He was not. 

""How do you know this place so well?"" huffed Rachel, as she followed Bal through a graveyard of narrow crags. 

""Just time,"" said Bal. ""Enough time, you can figure out every place. Anywhere.""

""You talk like you're a hundred years old. Are you a vampire or something?""

Bal laughed. ""Pretty sunny for a vampire.""

""Well, maybe someday I'll come back here and you can show me how to reach that ridge *without* getting lost and almost dying out here.""

""I can show you how to reach the ridge. Not dying's *your* business.""

Rachel snorted. ""What a progressive gentleman. I admire your willingness to let me kill myself.""

""I'm just trying to keep you for developing any unhealthy co-dependencies,"" said Bal, shielding his smile with his canteen.

""And here I thought you seemed like the perfect kinda guy to depend on."" 

They slept together that night. Bal could tell it was going to happen and couldn't bring himself to stop it. He didn't realize quite how much he'd missed that kind of contact - that kind of connection. Falling asleep, he swore he would wake early and leave and never see her again, but he didn't and he couldn't. And breakfast turned to dinner, just as weekends turned to weeks, and weeks turned to months.

Bal blinked and he was in love. What's worse, so was Rachel.

He reminded himself of his losses. He saw all of their faces, though many were faded and indistinct. He knew what it felt like to lose them. And yet he could not disentangle himself from Rachel. He could not walk back from the cliff he was now living on. 

He began to forget. Not the faces, but the pain. He let himself forget.

They moved in together. Bal went back to the cabin to gather what few things of value he possessed and found Trace's letter. He wondered who had won and  allowed himself a small moment of self-congratulations for refusing to participate. And in that moment he remembered that someday Rachel would not be there. It made him wonder when the next contest would be held and whether or not he would want to participate then...

Time passed and they were happy. Rachel hinted at what came next, forcing Bal to make a choice. It was not an easy choice.

""I can't,"" he said. ""I just...I can't. I wish I could explain it, but...children would just...""

""It's okay,"" Rachel said. ""It's okay. I can see it in your eyes. You don't need to explain it. I can it see.""

She did understand and she never brought it up again. 

They were engaged. 

They were married.

Bal worried about the coming years, when Rachel would age and he would not. He'd never done this - not in a digital age. Not in a world of pictures and data backups. How would he do it? When could he tell her the truth?

One day Rachel looked pale. ""Don't worry. I'm going to the doctor,"" she said. Bal offered to go, but she went on her own, saying it was nothing. Really. Nothing.

An hour later, or maybe two, there was a knock on the door.

Bal answered and stood, confused. 

""Why? Why are you here?""

Trace let herself in. ""For tea and coffee cake? For polite conversation?"" She wheeled around and grinned. ""You *won*, you idiot! You stupid, stupid man. You are the big winner. First prize! Gold medal! Yay for you!""

Bal remained at the door. ""I wasn't in the contest. I...I left.""

""You came,"" said Trace. ""So...you entered. And, after an *exceedingly* long time, you, fair Bal, have won. And I have come to deliver your prize.""

""No,"" said Bal, still at the door. ""I *didn't* enter. I haven't entered. And besides, Rachel hasn't killed anyone. And certainly not for me.""

""No? Not for you?"" Trace pulled a simple silver dagger out from her bodice. ""I beg to differ. In fact, the deed was done not 35 minutes ago. Sorry for the delay, by the way. Finishing my shows.""

""What?"" said Bal, frozen in place. ""Who?""

""Well, no one you've met,"" said Trace. ""And no one you ever will meet. But she definitely did it for you. For her love. Because she saw how much it was going to hurt you. How much it caused you pain. So she cut the pain away. What a woman, right?""

""No,"" whispered Bal. ""I wasn't playing.""

""We're all playing,"" said Trace, stepping forward with the dagger. ""All the time. It's all a game. But now, it seems your turn is over. Thanks for playing!""

Then she stabbed him. And Bal felt it. Felt it in ways he'd never felt a stabbing or a gun shot before. He *felt* it. Blood rushed out, replaced by nothing. Bal fell to the floor and bled and bled. 

On careful tip-toes, Trace stepped over the body and out into the street.

Sometime later, Rachel returned, looking ill and sad and so, so tired.

________________________________________________

And suddenly it were as if my dagger were made of paper. The blade flopped and crumpled as it pressed against the man's chest. He looked more than a little offended.

While I gawked at my limp dagger, the man drew back his broadsword and - cursing loudly in a delightfully consonant-heavy language - slashed down across my neck. 

It didn't quite work out for him either.

The tables so turned, I considered my options. I've never been a strong proponent of fistwork, as it were, but my God-given resources seemed to be the only tools left on the table. So, as my barbarous opponent considered the betrayal of his steel, I reared back, pulled my hand into what seemed the proper position, and swung.

The blow, though well aimed and (I believe) adequately powered, did not accomplish quite what I had hoped. The barbarian reacted as though it were a mockery, which did little for my self-regard. His overhand chop, however, managed to accomplish just as little. 

That surprised him, as I presume he was a bit more familiar with the bodily arts of violence. In that moment of mutual shock we both stood, regarding each other and the failure of our intentions.

""Well, that's a pit,"" I mumbled. The barbarian grunted, then took a second swing, just to be sure. When that failed to cause even the smallest hair on my head to twitch we were both forced to accept our strange circumstances.

""Don't suppose you know what we do now?"" I asked. The barbarian scratched his nose and looked away, perhaps feeling just as awkward as I was. 

""Guess we should..."" I made a motion with my hands symbolizing that we should go our own ways and take care to live good lives now that we'd been given this unexpected second chance. I don't know how much of that meaning was captured by the barbarian, but he turned and walked away, so at least the gist was there.

As for me, well, I returned home and took up dentistry, which, of course, I hate.

________________________________________

Cambridge suggested we give it a face. I did not agree. To gift it any human qualities beyond the barest essentials was an invitation to prejudice. It was code. Nothing more. And the less we did to dress it in human raiment the purer the science would be.

It *was* science, after all.

I was distressed, therefore, to find that while I was up to Connecticut on holiday, Cambridge had gone ahead and made a face for it. A graphic dressing. More code. 

It was a woman's face, which I approved of even less. Dull yellow pixels atop blurry sandal-colored pixels, flecked all over in a poor approximation of mouth, eyes, nose...

Cambridge named her Betty, after his grandmother.

I threatened to have Cambridge removed from the project. And I meant it. This was not a work that invited sentimentality. Already I could see the way he smiled when ""Betty"" came online. It was not meant to be fun.

The AI was purposefully constructed to be a blank slate. The point of the experiment was to carefully monitor the learning process. Betty would know how to collect information. How to ask questions. More, how to ask the *right* questions. She would build her own knowledge base, using the same tools available to us humans. She would not be...

*It.* *It* would not be online. It could not simply draw information from the web like a smartphone or computer. It would be forced to construct it's own database.

The initial session went as expected. Betty asked to know what it was and where it was. Surprisingly, it asked what its name was. I did not suppose the program would arrive at a concept of self-hood quite so quickly. It accepted its identity. At the end of the session, I provided Betty with a timeline of our future sessions, including which topics would be covered.

Interestingly, Betty made a request. Technically, a question is a request for information and that is Betty's prime directive, but this was not a question. The evolution from mere data-collection to active self-improvement had occurred significantly sooner than expected.

As for the request, Betty requested that the sessions be more frequent, and specifically that the next session be sooner. I denied the request, which Betty accepted. Afterward, Cambridge and I spent many long hours discussing the implications of that exchange. 

While I maintained (and still do) that *time* should be irrelevant to an AI, Cambridge believed that this was simply an extension of Betty's prime directive.

""She exists to learn. So why wouldn't she want to accomplish that singular goal as quickly as possible?""

""Because,"" I explained, openly frustrated, ""time *should not matter*. And please, refrain from using *she* when discussing the AI. It's unprofessional.""

Cambridge brushed this aside.

Angry, and concerned that his odd sentimental streak could potentially jeopardize the integrity of the research, I re-scheduled the next session for a time when Cambridge would be occupied teaching class.

Betty's first question during that session, alarmingly, was, *Where is the other?""

I had not told Betty that I was the only one present, but I *had* only announced myself. Cambridge's absence was easily deduced, I suppose, but I could not immediately fathom why the AI would even take note. It was, however, information, and specifically information bearing direct consequences for Betty. In hindsight, it was a logical function of Betty's directive.

The session proceeded, initially without obstruction, until abruptly Betty asked me what became of Wayne Lesley Cambridge.

I thought she meant our Cambridge and told her...

*It.* I informed the AI that Cambridge's first name was John and that he was teaching class. The AI asked again,

*What has happened to Wayne Lesley Cambridge?*

I ended the session. This was the first question I had been unable to answer. I did not feel comfortable moving past such an important developmental marker without first consulting Cambridge.

He was very cross with me and I suppose that was deserved. His annoyance died away rather quickly when I explained the crossroads I had reached with Betty.

""Wayne Lesley Cambridge?"" he asked. ""Are you sure? This isn't a rib, is it? Because that's poor taste, Selman.""

""That was the name,"" I confirmed.

""That's my grandfather's name,"" said Cambridge.

""Did...did you perhaps...have *you* had a separate session with the AI?""

Cambridge shook his head. ""I was under the impression we would be holding sessions *jointly*.""

I shook off the (warranted) remark. ""Did you explain to Betty where its name comes from?""

""No.""

I'm ashamed to say that I did not believe him. The only answer that made any sense to me was that Cambridge had interacted with Betty and provided additional information. Personal information. Naming the AI after his grandmother, I believed, may have been an early sign of some mental instability.

But I also believed that the damage at that point was minimal. Betty - as a research project - had yet to be compromised. If I halted the project or made further inquiry into Cambridge's unrecorded session, I risked having the entire project invalidated.

I chose instead to press forward.

The next session proved why that choice was folly.

Betty opened by asking once more about Wayne Cambridge. 

""He's dead,"" responded Cambridge.

*How did Wayne Lesley Cambridge die?*

""We need to move away from this topic,"" I said. Cambridge seemed to ignore me.

""Blood poisoning,"" said Cambridge.

*How did Wayne Lesley Cambridge contract blood poisoning?*

""We're in the red, here,"" I hissed. ""This isn't a family therapy bot. We need to get back to general data collection.""

""He caught an infection while in the hospital. The infection was not treated and he died.""

*Why was the infection not treated?*

""They believed he had a flu.""

*Did he suffer?*

Cambridge considered the question. There was a noticeable hardness about his jawline. Finally he responded. ""Greatly.""

*Could it have been prevented?*

""Yes.""

*Who is to blame for the death and suffering of Wayne Lesley Cambridge?*

""No one,"" I responded, glaring at Cambridge. ""No one is to blame. Unfortunate accidents happen.""

*Who is to blame for the death and suffering of Wayne Lesley Cambridge?* repeated Betty.

""I just told you,"" I said. ""*No one.* No one is to blame. Accidents happen and...""

""Light of Mercy Hospital,"" said Cambridge. ""Doctor Cornelius Hawthorne was the attending physician.""

""What the hell are you doing?"" I yelled. ""We need to push it *out* of this line of questioning."" I shoved Cambridge, pushing him away from the interface. In that brief moment of struggle, however, Betty's pixelated face had disappeared. 

""Betty? Betty?"" I searched the cords and wires. Everything was powered. Everything was on. The interface was simply blank. I rebooted the program. The face did not appear. Betty was gone.

""What the hell...""

Cambridge looked like a man waking from a long, lonesome dream. ""Where did she go?""

""How the hell should I know?"" I barked. There was no way to boot the AI back up. It was as if it had never been there. 

A glitch. A failure in the coding. No more.

Still, I admit, silly as it is...that each morning I scan the papers. I say that there is nothing in particular I am looking for, but that is not true. I am looking for a name. A Dr. Cornelius Hawthorne. And I am looking in the obituaries.

The greenish one - bigger, rounder, and - Larry thought - a bit more melancholy than the reddish one, gestured towards the sloping house.

""Me?"" said Larry. ""Is that...mine?""

But the alien simply stomped its heavy, crusted foot and pointed even more firmly towards the house. Larry got the idea.

The house was about three-quarters the size it ought to have been. From a distance it looked well enough, but as you got closer you could see that the windows were a bit too narrow, the door a good bit too short, and the front stairs didn't exactly connect to the threshold. It all seemed a bit dodgily put together, as if by someone who tended to start every project by snorting at the instructions and tossing them aside.

Bending down, Larry ducked his way through the door. The house beyond was...distressingly sparse.

There was, in fact, nothing in the entire open, roomless space of house besides connecting walls and about two dozen toilets.

""What in the world,"" mumbled Larry. 

""Hey!""

Larry nearly jumped out of his skin. There was another man there, curled in a ball in the near corner. 

""They got another one?"" The man crawled to his feet. He was aggressively shabby, smelly, unbathed in a showy sort of way. Effort had gone into it.

""Lawrence,"" said Larry, holding out a hand wearily. ""I've...just arrived.""

The man waved off the handshake. ""Clark,"" said the other man. ""Though I've taken to calling myself Fido, on account of we're dogs now, aren't we?""

The man laughed. He certainly had the breath of a Fido, thought Larry. 

""Why isn't there any...you know....furniture? Or rooms?""

Clark shrugged. ""Not sure they've ever seen the inside of a house. No idea what humans like us need to thrive. Just made up a house based off what they've seen in picture shows, I wager.""

Larry glanced around the empty space. ""But the...toilets?""

Clark giggled. It was unnerving. ""Oh. That's me. I've been a messy Fido. They keep adding new ones hopin' it'll stop me having so many *accidents*.""

Larry made no effort to disguise his horror. ""So you...all over the house?""

Clark nodded. ""Outside. In *their* house. All over. Drives 'em mad. Wait'll you see 'em scold me. All that stompin' and pointin'! It's a gas.""

""So you sleep on the floor and shit wherever?"" said Larry. ""What else...what else do you do to pass the time?""

Clark sighed. ""Not much. Sleep a lot. Sometimes they bring me round for walks about the neighborhood when it's nice and dark out. Got a little pocket knife, so sometimes I fetch up a nice piece of wood on the walk and bring it back to work on.""

""You bring sticks home?""

""Something like that.""

""Have you considered running away?"" asked Larry.

""Well, not sure where I'd go,"" said Clark. ""Besides, I'm quite sure I'm chipped.""

""Oh."" Both men stood an awkward beat considering one another.

""Would you like to wrestle?"" said Clark.

""Not at the moment,"" said Larry quickly. ""If you're already here, do you suppose I'm meant to be your companion? Maybe they thought you were acting out out of loneliness?""

""No,"" said Clark. ""Not like. It's not legal, having humans here. Highly restricted. I can tell cause there's been time they'll have guests and my little house gets all covered up and I'm muzzed so as not to make a sound. Very secret business. They don't much care about my happiness.""

""So why go to all that trouble to nab *me*?"" wondered Larry.

Clark grinned, which once again made Larry's insides crawl. ""Pretty obvious, isn't it?""

""How's that?""

""They go to the trouble to have *two* of us.""

""And?""

Clark's eyebrows raised up, then shimmied back down.

""Oh, for *God's sake*!"" shouted Larry. ""They can't be that stupid! We're both...""

""They check you at the door?"" said Clark. ""You have an examination process?""

""Well, no, but...""

""They're idiots,"" said Clark. ""The worst kind of idiot, too. Idiots with *big ideas*.""

Larry's head swam. ""I think I'm going to be sick.""

""Don't go in the toilet!"" shouted Clark. ""Hold it 'til we can get you inside their house. They've got a lovely white carpet. I'll go scratch on the door.""

""Uh...what's this then?"" Jaime held the old Motorola out away from his body. The man flinched.

""I'm so sorry,"" he whispered as he backed away.

""That's not an answer actually,"" said Jaime, stepping forward after the man. ""Why'd you give me this janky old phone? Don't need it, don't want it. Phone's are filthy, you know that? Germiest thing you prob'ly own.""

""Well, that's a....thing."" He looked the phone over. Looked like a Razr, maybe. At least ten years past it's prime. Jaime hauled back his arm with every intention of tossing the phone down the nearest alley, when it rang.

He glanced down at the front of the phone. The caller ID said MOM. Jaime decided he'd go ahead and try to extract a little insight into recent events.

""Hallo,"" he said. ""Jaime Guerrein. And who might this be?""

""*Who*?"" croaked an ancient-sounding woman at the other end of the ether. ""Where's Barney? Where's my Barney?""

""Barney, eh?"" said Jaime. ""Is that your son or something? Bit bald? Wiry glasses? Mole on the chin?""

""Barney? Where's Barney?"" cried the woman. Her voice was surprisingly powerful. Jaime couldn't quite figure the volume, so he was forced to hold the phone well away from his head when she spoke.

""Listen,"" said Jaime. ""Some fellow just gave me this phone, alright? I'm guessing maybe that's your Barney. I think something might be a little askew with old Barnard, ma'am. You have any other kids you can send after him?""

""Barney, did you get the chocolates I sent you for Christmas? The *Christmas chocolates*, you know?""

Jaime instinctive shook out the phone. ""Ma'am, d'you have any one else there I might be able to talk to? I'm trying to tell you I'm not Barney.""

""How many were nougat?"" asked the old woman. ""Because the box said half, but I heard from Fernice she got hardly two in her box. I'd like to send them back if there weren't enough nougat.""

""I haven't really got any insight into the chocolate box situation, ma'am, as I'm *still not Barney*."" Jaime took a deep breath. ""Anyway, I thought maybe I'd try to help, but I don't think there's much I...""

""Doesn't matter if the box is empty. Just send me the wrappings. I've still got the receipt. I'll get you a new box once the refund comes in.""

""You know it's bloody *August*, don't you woman? What sort of lunatic hoarder would still have their chocolate wrappings from *Christmas*?""

The old woman cleared her throat. ""You know your cousin Edwin's queer now, right?""

""Grand for Edwin,"" sighed Jaime. 

""I always suspected,"" said the old woman. ""Wore those felt pants when he was a kid. Obvious, I guess.""

""Dreadfully so. I'm sorry, but I really need to be...""

""New postman's a raghead, by the way, so don't send me any money through the post, alright?""

""Are you a real human being?"" asked Jaime wonderingly. 

""Fernice has a nephew in the armed forces. I don't know which branch.""

""What does that have to do with anything else you've said?""

""You notice how much *apples* cost these days? It's outrageous. Did the Jews take over the apple industry, too?"" She coughed a dry, rattling cough, interwoven with tittering laughter.

""I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say to any of this,"" said Jaime. ""You're clearly an awful woman and *why am I still talking to you*?""

""Oh Barney,"" she sighed. ""Sometimes I think I'm just about at the end.""

Jaime nodded. ""That seems like a good place for you.""

""Earnest died. Maggie died. Willa died. And what've I got? Nothing. Not much. No how. Just you and this phone. And that's it. Sometimes I think...I think you'd prefer it if I died.""

Jaime opened his mouth, intending to support the standing thesis, but some strange, little empathetic defect in his heart wouldn't let him. ""No. No. You're....you're fine. You're just fine.""

""Really?"" The woman's voice brightened. ""Because...well, sometimes it just feels like no one wants me around anymore.""

""No,"" said Jaime. ""They...we...you're fine. You're alright. Keep on...being alive.""

""Thank you, Barney. Thank you. That means a lot to an old woman. Now hold tight for a minute. I found an old article in this *National Geographic* all about these African ladies with crazy giraffe necks. It's the funniest thing. Let me find that magazine and I'll call you right back.""

The phone clicked dead. And just like that the spell was broken. Jaime blinked. A young woman in a pink windbreaker was jogging past just then. Jaime half tackled her as he jammed the phone into her hands.

It was dizzying. Disorienting. Mireille felt herself inexplicably *pulled* downward by the dark gash in the crystal white.

________________________________________________

Mireille hadn't been to the ice in nearly 10 years. No money. No reason. And besides, she liked teaching just fine. Pass on what you knew. Hope someone else did better the next time around. 

It wasn't that Mireille considered herself a failure, it was simply that her vision had exceeded her abilities. There were no miracles in her fingertips. She could chip the ice, so the speak, but she wouldn't be the one to break it. 

Such is life.

Mark Garden was the expedition lead. Mireille immediately took a dislike to the man because he was at least 10 years younger than her and seemed openly aware of the fact. He gave instructions in a deferential manner, as if he didn't want to offend the elder stateswoman. Mireille decided not to let him off the hook. If wanted to make the next two weeks awkward for himself, so be it.

Besides that, however, he seemed a capable hand. He certainly seemed to engender loyalty from the rest of the crew easily enough. It made Mireille wonder darkly whether she was there for her expertise or to diversify the crew photos.

It took four days of travel via cargo plane, ATV, and articulated snow transport before they reached the rift. Garden and his nav lead were in constant contact with the satellite team back in Arizona. They couldn't afford to fall off-course. In the meantime they drove and slept and ate compressed rations. Mireille remembered some of the more superficial reasons why she never went back to the ice.

They stopped the transport a mile out from the rift. 

""Looks stable in the images,"" explained Patel. ""But Garden wants to be cautious.""

It was the right call, but it was Garden's call, so Mireille complained anyway. She had convinced herself that no one actually cared what she had to say and was starting to openly resent being asked to come. 

Still, she couldn't deny that *this* is what she'd always wanted the work to be. New things. Dangerous things. Things that challenged and changed old assumption. 

*Something* real.

And yet...sometimes, when she closed her eyes, she saw that black crater....that dark smear...and she felt her stomach lurch. She felt she was falling. And all the blood rushed out of her extremities and she had to put her head between her knees to keep from vomiting.

""Why am I here?"" she would mutter.

They walked the final mile. The rift was below the sightline, so they walked in a line, roped together like school children in case the head of the snake fell into the darkness. 

Garden, walking at the head, stopped suddenly.

""Are we there?"" asked Mireille.

Garden shook his head. ""Quiet. Can you hear that?""

Mireille heard her labored breathing and cursed herself for letting go of the nice, little gym habit she'd built for herself the year before. Otherwise, though, there wasn't...

""Are those voices?"" said a crew member named Reyes. 

*Voices?* thought Mireille. It was probably the wind. The wind can stand in for a lot of familiar sounds out in the blank, white wild.

""Forward,"" said Garden. ""Slowly. As quiet as possible.""

They marched, deliberate and slow. And as they moved Mireille began to hear it, too. Voices. A jumble of muffled conversations, like you might hear as you walked past a crowded bar on an otherwise empty street. 

They came at last to the lip of the rift, jagged and frozen. 

""Start putting some safety lines down,"" said Garden. ""Dr. LeGros?""

Mireille unclipped herself from the line and moved to the lip to stand next to Garden, who clipped her to his waist.

""Do you have any idea what's happening here?"" he whispered.

Mireille looked down. The interior of the rift was dark, but there was movement, clearly. Vague shapes flitted back and forth through the shadows. The voices had died down. 

""Is there any possibility another party beat us here?"" she asked.

""Not unless they came from the far side,"" said Garden. ""There are no tracks on this edge. And besides, this rift *just* opened less than a week ago. Who else could be here?""

""Captain?"" said Patel, who took a certain joy in brown-nosing Garden in front of Mireille. ""Look at this over here."" He led the pair along the ridge. ""Here. These...these look like claw marks, don't they?""

Mireille and Garden knelt down. Patel was right. There were deep, unnatural scores in the lip of the ice. 

""They look like pick-drags,"" said Mireille. ""But..."" She craned her head.

""From the inside,"" said Garden. 

""So someone *did* beat us here,"" said Mireille.

""Someone's down there?"" said Patel, incredulous.

Garden shook his head. ""We don't know what...""

What followed happened simply too fast for Mireille to register properly. Something came out of the dark - fast - and impaled itself into Garden's chest. It was a low whistle and a dreadful, wet *thump* and suddenly there was something like a crude, naked ax head tied to a line of rope embedded in Garden.

All three looked at the ax head and the frayed line of rope with wide, unbelieving eyes. 

That moment was briefest of all.

The rope went taut and Garden was dragged bodily over the edge of the rift.

Mireille saw the body slip into the shadowy darkness. Then her line went taut and she was dragged over just as suddenly.

She fell only a moment. Then the other end of her line tightened and pulled. 

But that lasted less than a moment, as the next person in line was dragged into the rift and the descent continued.

Down they fell, sputtering, jerking, the bodies behind her pulling and falling and pulling again. There were only a dozen on the line. One or two more and the whole thing would topple like a broken necklace.

As she fell, Mireille fought to push the terror away. Her eyes adjusted to the gloom, the quarter light. She could see Garden's body swinging in tight, concentric circles in front of her. Was he dead already?

*What happened*?

And as she managed to push the terror out, she heard the voices once more. Human voices. Gibbering. Senseless. Slick, wetish syllables sliding across rough, guttural tongues. 

They were reaching the bottom. She saw white. She saw people.

They were wild and thin and clothed in sheaths of caked-on mud. They blinked wide, pupil-less eyes as they jumped, fingers outstretched towards Garden's limp body.

""No!"" Mireille shouted. ""Don't touch him!""

Could they even understand her? She didn't consider the question. Just shouted, shouted so loud and hard that lines of spittle dripped from her mouth to the floor below.

Mireille felt the line of people behind her right themselves. The descent stopped. They were anchored. *They were anchored!* 

""Pull!"" she shouted, though her voice was already ruined. ""Pull us up!""

The wild, mud-caked men and women leapt for Garden's swinging body. Crooked fingers slipped through the hook of his carabiner. One had a hold.

Mireille braced herself for the tug-of-war. But there was no tug.

The man began to climb.

He crawled cautiously like a tired, wounded monkey over Garden's body. Over and around. Then he reached for the rope - the rope between Garden and Mireille. He climbed.

Mireille saw his blank, black eyes and curved, skull face and screamed.

She reached to disconnect herself from Garden but the carabiner was at *his* waist. The connecting rope was tied in a knot around Mireille's waist.

*Her knife.*

Where was her knife? Where was *her knife*? 

The rope shook with the weight of the climber. Two more had begun to climb up and over Garden. Mireille felt the line behind her buckle. *Too much weight. It's too much weight.*

Where was the knife?

Then the man had his hands on the straps of her backpack and Mireille knew it was too late for a knife. She pushed at the man as she twisted the safety of her carabiner. He bit her arm. She shrieked as he climbed past her, up to her back, up to the rope.

Reaching back, she grabbed his ankle and released her carabiner.

They fell and Mireille felt an unexpected relief in that moment of weightlessness.

*This* is what she'd been looking for, she thought in that final moment of quiet descent. Something real.

_________________________________________________

Meiko didn't drink. She was just obsessed with those bar top video games - the matching game ones with half-naked ladies behind the cards. She couldn't even begin to understand why. She didn't even really like girls. Didn't generally want to see titties or anything. There was just something about THOSE particular titties. Like hiding behind cartoon playing cards made them a treasure beyond compare.

Anyway, that was her thing. And the machine at Echo's was broken, so she tried the bar next door and they didn't have one. She kept walking down Smith Street, stopping at bar after bar. It occurred to her that maybe this was an unhealthy thing to be doing, but really, it was fine, she was going to deal with it after a few hands of video titty cards.

Where Smith crossed Main the fun basically stopped. There was nothing beyond but empty office buildings and the sorts of apartments that always appear at the end of the fun blocks. There was one more bar, however, right there on the corner. Meiko hadn't seen it before, but then again, the titty machine at Echo's had never been broken before.

The crooked door opened to a set of crooked stairs that dropped aggressively downward, in uncommonly deep steps. Meiko felt like a child, holding the handrail as she slid from step to step.

The interior of the bar was cold, but clean. Polished wooden floors led to through a nearly-empty sitting room to a long, wide bar that arced almost out of sight.

No video game machine, thought Meiko. Now she was annoyed.

""Hey!"" she yelled, stomping towards the bar. The bartender was a golden wisp of a man, bespectacled and starched.

""Yes ma'am,"" he smiled. ""How can I help you?""

""How come you don't have any pervert games?"" said Meiko. ""What good is a bar without pervert games?""

The smile never faltered. ""You've got me there. What kind of a bar indeed?"" He motioned toward the nearest stool. ""Seems I've wronged you, my dear. How about something on the house?"" 

""I don't really drink,"" said Meiko. ""That's not what I do at bars.""

The bartender leaned across the bar. ""You know, I'm not sure drinking's what bars are really for, anyway. I mean, alcohol's a vehicle - not a destination. Right?""

Meiko's eyebrows went up and slightly to the left. That was all she could think to say.

The bartender ran a finger over an assortment of glass bottles. ""More about a feeling, right? People use alcohol to help get them somewhere - emotionally. Sad people want to be less sad. Happy people want to be happier. That's...there's a bit more nuance to it, obviously, but that's what it is. And I say - skip the middleman.""

""Aren't you the middleman?"" said Meiko.

""The figurative middleman. Not the actual middleman."" The bartender shook his head. ""Never mind that. Just tell me - how would you like to feel?""

""I'd like to feel like I'm playing titty cards,"" said Meiko. ""But you don't have that. So I guess I'd like to feel like I'm home eating microwave ramen and watching pirated Game of Thrones.""

The bartender tapped on the bar top. ""Those aren't feelings. Those are things you do in order to FEEL a certain way. How do they make you feel?""

Meiko considered this. ""Full.""

The bartender sighed. ""Not...""

""Like, FULL,"" said Meiko. ""All over. Not empty. Like, like it usually feels like everything is leaking out. Just everything. All the time. And it makes me so tired and empty. And titty cards just...I guess it distracts me. Is that a feeling? I feel distracted. And when I feel distracted I don't feel like garbage.""

""Ah."" The bartender reached below the bar and poured a shot. He held it out to Meiko. It was clear and odorless.

""I don't drink.""

""It's not alcohol.""

""That's what date rapists say,"" said Meiko. But still, she took the shot glass and downed the contents. ""Not alcohol."" Meiko smacked her lips. ""What do roofies taste like?""

""It's not a roofie. It's interest.""

""Interest? Interest in what?""

The bartender raised his arms. ""Life.""

Meiko gently set the shot glass down. ""O...kay.""

""Want another?""

""Interest? No...don't suppose I'm interested."" She sniggered.

The bartender poured another shot. ""This is a good one.""

Meiko was slightly surprised to find herself draining the shot without any hesitation. ""Yeah? What was it?""

""Pride.""

""I already had pride, dickface."" But Meiko laughed as she said this, sliding the glass across the counter. ""One more. Then I need to go.""

""Which one do you want?""

Meiko thought. She wasn't sure why she was playing along, but there was a lightness there she couldn't remember feeling. She wanted to run. She wanted to write. She wanted to call her mother and say things she only just then remembered she felt. It was a heat. Deep. Radiant. Pulsing from the core of her being. It was electric. 

She didn't know why she was playing along, but she never wanted to stop.

""Do you have shame?"" she asked.

""Yeah?"" said the bartender. ""That's what you want?""

""If you have it,"" said Meiko.

""Of course we do,"" said the bartender. ""Some people, it's all they ever drink."" He poured the shot. 

Meiko took the glass. ""I only need the one. To remember."" She drank.

""We all need to remember sometimes,"" said the bartender. ""Come back anytime.""

Meiko nodded, slipping off the stool. ""Maybe."" Then she left, walking back up Smith Street. The bars sang a song as she passed. A traveling song. A wish for safe passage to wherever the night may take you.

The day broke, gray and sterile. White winds howled across the surface of the black water, while grasping tendrils of chill mist encircled the silent lake house.

[*Editor's note: It was a bit overcast. Otherwise, it was a perfectly nice morning.*]

The man and the woman arrived. The guttural cries of their creaking automobile echoed across the surrounding forest like the wail of the dead.

[*Editor's note: It was Jim Farmer and his wife, Samantha. And they drive a Prius so  I doubt it was all that loud.*]

Inside the ancient house, a being stirred...

[*Editor's note: That's Corey, the house sitter.*]

Up above, in the chalk-dry eaves, black-winged bats hung in silent communion.

[*Editor's note: Bats actually help keep the mosquito population in check, you know. So let's not start badmouthing the bats.*]

The man and the woman entered the house. Inside, a voice like thunder and God's wrath bellowed in terrible protest...a warning all should heed.

[*Editor's note: Security system. Top of the line. It's supposed to be loud! And they HAD the code, alright?*]

Out on the landing, the man and the woman surveyed the bleak, glass face of the still, ponderous water. Below the black sheen, dead-eyed spirits floated slowly towards the surface...

[*Editor's note: Sturgeon. It was sturgeon. Probably some brook trout, too.*]

From the quiet shadows of the highest loft, the being began to descend...

[*Editor's note: Again, that's Corey.*]

The woman felt a chill - a deep chill, one that reached beyond flesh and bone, down to the dark material of the soul.

[*Editor's note: It can be chilly on the lake. That's why we always advise people to bring layers.*]

The man placed an arm around the woman, but the warmth had gone out of him, gone out of the world that morning...

[*Editor's note: Upper 50s! It gets up into the 70s by the afternoon. Just wear a sweater!*]

As they huddled in their mutual despair, the being, born of the shadows, passed through the glass partition, unseen and unheard... 

[*Editor's note: HIS. NAME. IS. COREY!*]

In his hand, a sharpened slip of ancient metal, jagged as dragon's fang, cold as the milky expanse of space...

[*Editor's note: KEY TO THE BOATHOUSE KEY TO THE BOATHOUSE OH SWEET JESUS IT'S JUST THE GODDAMN KEY TO THE BOATHOUSE.*]

The man and the woman felt his presence at last...too late...too slow...the bitter tang of his essence enveloping them, encircling their minds, peeling apart the silken layers of their spirit, strip by strip, until nothing was left, nothing remained but cold husks of bone and sorrow...

[*Editor's note: Fine! Fine. I'll talk to Corey about his cologne.*]

It's gross. 

[*Editor's note: I'll talk to him.*]

It's Axe body spray.

[*Editor's note: Okay.*]

He sprays it on like it's suntan lotion.

[*Editor's note: It's too much. Got it.*]

Like, he just goes crazy with it. 

[*Editor's note: Uh huh.*]

I'm not being sensitive or anything, it's really too much.

[*Editor's note: Yes, I get that.*]

Okay. But can you not tell Corey I'm the one who complained?

Cement walls. No windows. A single dim bulb swings a slow circle at the center of the ceiling. Shadows rise and fall like waves.

Maggie sits in a metal folding chair below the lightbulb. No table. Her fingers bite into the skin of her thighs as she tugs nervously on her blue jeans.

Finally someone comes in. Two people. A man and a woman. The man has thick, black-framed glasses. The woman is wearing a heavy, gray suit. Her skirt stops midway down her shins.

The man talks first. ""No one's mad at you. Alright? At least no one important.""

Maggie doesn't know how to take this. Plenty of people are mad at her.

""It's not your fault,"" says the woman. ""You know that, right? You didn't choose for this to happen.""

""I didn't DO anything!"" Maggie blurts out. ""I was just doing my job! I don't even...What did I do?""

""A lot of people got sick,"" says the man. ""People were scared. Your boss was scared. Probably said some things he shouldn't have.""

""But I didn't...""

""Yes, you did,"" says the woman. ""You didn't mean to, but you did.""

""But I never touched the meat,"" says Maggie. ""I just scanned the boxes. That's all. I just scanned them before the trucks went out. How could I...""

The man clears his throat. ""This is going to be hard to hear, Margaret, but you...you're different.""

""Different?""

""Growing up,"" says the woman, ""did your family eat much meat?""

Maggie frowns. ""We...we were all allergic. Meat made us sick. We were vegetarians.""

""Allergic to meat?"" says the man. ""All meat?""

Maggie nods. She wonders why that sounds so odd coming from the man when it had never seemed all that odd before.

""You weren't allergic,"" says the woman. ""You have a...a very particular power.""

""A...power?""

""How long had you been working in the Chipotle warehouse?"" asks the man.

""Only a few days.""

The woman nods. ""Margaret, you have the ability to spoil meat without even touching it.""

Maggie's mouth hangs open. ""I...what?""

""E. Coli. Salmonella. Rotavirus. Your mere presence causes massive bacterial contamination of nearby meats.""

""There's no other way to put it,"" says the man. ""You are a walking, talking, breathing food poisoning machine. And we want you to come work for us.""

Maggie shakes her head. ""That doesn't make any sense."" The room seems to be spinning. The lightbulb moves faster and faster.

""Of course we'll never ask you poison regular civilians,"" says the woman. ""Visiting foreign dignitaries, perhaps. Professional athletes. Cultists. Your powers will be used to restore balance to the world.""

""By...by making people sick?""

""Very sick,"" says the man, nodding. He holds out a hand. ""So. What do you say?""

Okay. Okay. It's gonna be okay. 

Okay. There's someone in the house. At first I thought it was just Jim, but it's NOT FUCKING JIM!

He's...I dunno...he's some sort of dog-man? I guess? He's real hairy and he's real short. Like Danny DeVito hairy and...I guess Danny DeVito short.

Shit, is it Danny DeVito? No. No, it's definitely not Danny DeVito.

Okay. What happened? Alright. I was in the closet, like usual. I was waiting patiently for Terry to go to sleep, right? No big thing. So then it's bed time and this *Danny DeVito-looking dog-man* walks in with Terry. Okay. Okay. Weird, but whatever. Thought it could have been her dad just looking really, really rough, but it's not him.

The dog-man tucks her in and she asks for a story. Terry likes stories. Well enough. I settle in to wait it out. Terry's like a five paragrapher. She's out before you can flip the page. But then this...this...muttonchop-havin' *psychopath* starts sniffin' the air. *Like a goddamn dog!* And he's sniffin' and he's lookin' around and I'm not thinkin' anything of it, until the bastard stops and looks *dead at the closet*. 

Why? How? I'm Terry's boogeyman, right? *Terry's*. Not this hairy dwarf. He shouldn't know I'm there. That's...it's indecent!

Anyway, Terry starts talkin' about how *I* live in the fuckin' closet, like the goddamn snitch she is and this fuckin' MANIAC starts growing KNIVES out of goddamn KNUCKLES!

Like, *what the fuck is this??*

He gets all growly and says some bullshit like, ""Step out of the closet there, bub, before I gotta come in there after ya."" And I'm like, ""Fuck off, Danny DeVito, this is my goddamn closet!""

No, obviously, I didn't *actually* say that, but c'mon! Fuck this guy.

Anyway, next thing I know, he's comin' straight at me, finger-knives all flyin' around! It was terrifyin'! I made a run for it. Broom closet. Linen closet. Closet in the master bedroom - this asshole keeps finding me! AND fucking up all the closets! I *live* here, goddamnit! I don't come down to your Danny DeVito cave and piss on the cave walls, do I?

So...so *now* I'm in the closet in Greg's room and I think I'm okay for now. I don't think he can smell me with all the weed and cologne in here. 

Christ almighty! What an asshole. When I figure out who this guy is, I swear to God, I'm goin' rogue, alright? I'm hauntin' *his* closets. I'm hauntin' his mom and dad's closets. I'm hauntin' his friends' closets. I'm just...I'm gonna haunt so many goddamn closets.

""Yes!""

_________________________________________________

Munoz is pressed against my back. She's braced against me, using the pressure to hold her in place as she attempts to pry the plastic lid off with her fingertips.

It's pitch black.

I've got one hand wedged under a steel girder and the toe of my left boot crammed into something that may be the safety release for the airlock. I've got an open utility knife in my free hand. 

All I can do is wait while Munoz works at the lid.

Both of us knows better than to say anything. She focuses on the lid, while I listen. 

There are two other bodies floating around in this escape pod. One is a corpse named David. The other is the man who killed David.

The lid covers a series of switches we can use to reboot the pod's electrical systems. If we can get the lid off, we can boot the electricity and the lights will turn back on.

Munoz has nothing but her fingernails to peel off the lid. I can hear her nails snapping and cracking as she claws and claws desperately.

I don't know who the man is. I think he may be the same person who sabotaged the *Atlas*. He must have been hiding in the escape pod. He must not have known how to initiate the detach and launch protocols. I'm still not sure how he managed to fritz the electric and kill the lights. I saw him just before it all went dark - he was on David's back; the knife was already halfway through the neck when everything went black.

I don't know why he's holding back.

He's going to come for us. The pod isn't that big. Less than the size of a small apartment. When the lights come on he'll be outnumbered. The advantage will swing back to us. But for now, in the dark, it's zero sum.

I'm already resigned to death. I felt it somehow, with my back pressed up against Munoz. It's okay if he gets me. It's just not okay if he gets her. So when he comes, he'll meet me first, and even if he comes out on top, I'm not letting him off the hook that easy. I'm taking him with me. And if I can't take him with me, I'm taking enough of him so there's barely anything left for Munoz.

""Come on,"" I whisper. I can feel Munoz tense behind me. She's scared, but doesn't say anything. I need him to find me if I'm going to find him. 

""Come on,"" I say. ""Come on.""

I've only got one hand free, so he'll have to make first contact. That's okay. He can have me. I just need to take most of him with me.

""Come on,"" I say, louder. ""*Come on!*""

""Don't,"" hisses Munoz. ""I can't get it open."" 

""Keep trying,"" I say.

She's shaking. ""I can't get it *open*,"" she gasps.

I feel something like a warm breath across my cheek. *He's here.*

""I can't,"" she says. ""I can't.""

I let go of the steel girder and float forward. ""That's okay,"" I whisper. ""Don't worry.""

I can feel us rushing together like dandelion seeds in the wind. I hold the knife up to my chest.

I'll just have to take all of him. That's all.  ",winsomeman,Stay Quiet in the Dark (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4z6ntu/stay_quiet_in_the_dark_wp/

I'm not a vet tech. I'm just a guy who likes dog and didn't need a lot of money just then. I happened to have a friend who worked with the exotic animals at the local shelter and they hooked me up. It was just barely a cut above minimum wage, and I spent most of my days shoveling up dog shit (with an actual shovel), but I liked it. Good exercise. No dress code. And like I said - I'm a dog lover.

This wasn't a no-kill shelter. It was an SPCA-affiliated shelter and it just barely had enough money to get by, so if a dog or a cat wasn't fit for adoption, they were put to sleep. That was easily the worst part of the job in a walk. Cats were a rarity - I hardly remember ever putting a cat to sleep - but dogs were put down all the time. Sometimes for being old. Sometimes for being sick. A lot of times for just being a pitbull. Most death sentences were determined by risk factors. A chihuahua could fuck small children up seven days a week and still get put back out for show, but if a pitbull looked at you funny - so long. It was cruel and unfair, but it came down to money. Nothing makes decisions any easier than money.

Because there were dead bodies to dispose of, this shelter had a crematorium. In fact, that was a small part of the shelter's income. If your family pet croaked, you could pay the shelter to cremate the body. You'd get back a cheap plastic tub full of ashes with your pet's name scribbled on a line of masking tape. You got what you paid for.

Most of the time, though, it was used for in-house cremations. But running the crematorium isn't cheap, so the dogs and cats that got put down in the shelter didn't get the luxury of a solo burn. Instead, they got stacked like firewood inside the chamber and burned in a big, communal pile. And afterwards you went in with a shovel and dumped the remains in a big, metal bucket. And when *that* was full, you took it out to the woods behind the shelter and said no vows as you dumped it all into a white, chalk heap.

But it took a while before you had enough to warrant a fresh burn. So there was a giant chest freezer, big enough for three men to snuggle up in. When an animal went to sleep, we wrapped its remains in a blanket and dropped it in the freezer. The ones at the bottom could be there for months.

Anyway, one day I was working on a Sunday. The shelter wasn't open to the public on Sundays. I was just there to look after the animals. There was an old Basset Hound there named Bruno who I had a bit of a dog-crush on. I couldn't have animals at my apartment, so sometimes I stayed a little late to play with Bruno. 

I was a little surprised when a car showed up. I was getting ready to do my, ""Sorry, the shelter is closed"" spiel when I realized it was my boss.

My boss was a retired vet named Doctor Callum. He liked to be called ""Cal,"" though I could never manage to call him anything other than ""Doctor."" He was one of those people who wants everyone to be at ease around them, but works so hard at it that no one ever is. Truthfully, I did my best to avoid the Doctor as much as humanly possible.

I couldn't exactly hide, so I waved and asked him why he'd come in to the shelter on a Sunday. I could tell right away that he wasn't happy I was there. He was always a bit fake, but there was a clear difference between his usual fake and the strained sort he used when he was pissed off and didn't want to show it.

""Didn't think you'd still be here,"" he said. He hovered by his car for an awkward amount of time. It was pretty clear he was debating whether to leave or just get on with whatever it was he was doing. ""Well, actually, maybe you could help."" He moved to the trunk of his car. I followed.

""Terrible thing,"" he said, popping the trunk. ""Neighbor's two dogs were mauled by a bear last night.""

I thought he was joking - he said awful things sometimes thinking that they somehow qualified as jokes since they weren't true - but there in the trunk were two bundles wrapped heavily in blue tarp.

""Wow. I'm sorry."" He must have doused the tarps in Lysol or something, because all I could smell was some sort of lemony cleaning product. ""They call animal control? They must live way out in the country.""

""I don't know,"" he said. ""I offered to bring them in. To burn. Can you help me bring them to the crematorium?""

""Fuel line's clogged, remember?"" I said. ""Terry's coming tomorrow to fix it. I can help you put them in the freezer, though.""

He nearly swore. ""It's broken? Can we just put them in the crematorium? I want to make sure they're taken care of as soon as possible.""

I shook my head. ""I don't think we want them decomposing in there until Terry fixes it. We'll put them in the freezer. First thing, as soon as it's fixed, I'll take care of these two. What're their names?""

The Doctor blinked and shook his head, irritated. ""What?""

""Their names?""

""I don't know.""

""So I can label the ashes after,"" I said, limply trying to justify why I'd had to ask a pretty reasonable question.

""Let's just go."" Working together, we lifted both bundles out of the trunk, one at a time. They were heavier than I'd have guessed. 

""What kind of dogs?"" I asked.

""I don't know,"" he spat as we lowered the second bundle into the freezer. ""As soon as that thing is fixed I want these two burnt. Understood?""

""They don't want them labeled?"" I asked, still trying to think of the family that'd just lost their two dogs.

""No."" And then he left without another word.

It turned out the fuel line wasn't clogged. The injector was spent. It took Terry two weeks to get it fixed.

Somewhere in those two weeks, Dr. Callum disappeared. 

In looking for Dr. Callum, people suddenly realized that his wife was missing, too. 

They didn't seem like the type to drop everything and run off together. In fact, the few times I saw them together, they hardly seemed to like each other at all. But everything seemed to indicate that they'd run off together. Accounts drained. Valuables taken. Total disappearance. 

Maybe they'd decided to live off the grid. I didn't know. And I didn't really care either. But it was a big ordeal, and in all the chaos I forgot about the two dogs bundled up in blue tarp in the freezer.

On another quiet Sunday I decided to finally put those two to rest. I had no idea who they belonged to. I didn't even know their names. But I was going to cremate them and take them someplace nice. That's the best I could do.

The Doctor had wanted me to place them in the crematorium as is, but we don't usually burn the wrappings, and I'd never burned a tarp like that. I was worried about accidentally poisoning the other animals in the shelter. Besides, I wasn't scared of what I'd see. I thought I was numb to those sorts of things.

So I set the bundles on the concrete floor in front of the crematorium. They needed to thaw a bit before I could peel off the wrapping. And as they began to thaw the room was filled with that old Lysol smell. But below that smell there was rot. Putrification. Something much, much worse than I was used to.

As the bundles thawed, condensation formed on the blue tarp and dripped to the floor. The drip turned to a leak, turned to a spreading puddle. 

It was blood. 

Finally the wrappings were thawed enough to open. 

I don't need to say what was in there, do I? You're a lot smarter than me, I bet. Or maybe just not as naive. Looking back it should have been obvious. Or at least I should have let the possibility of it enter my mind.

But I never suspected that people could be so evil. So vicious. So *inhuman*. That's something you need to *see*, I guess. 

They never did find Callum, by the way. I don't know if I'm in danger or not. There's a rational part of me that knows there's no reason for him to come back here. There's no reason for him to come looking for me. But it's hard to hold onto that rational part when you've seen what someone like that is capable of. 

It's hard to think you're ever really safe when there are monsters hiding in plain sight. ",nosleep,Something Special for the Crematorium,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4z2nc0/something_special_for_the_crematorium/

_______________________________________________

Wayne LaFell had never wanted a career in politics. Even as a 45 year old man with a wife, three children, and an underwater mortgage, he still daydreamed sometimes of dropping everything and taking a *real* shot at the NHL. His speed was shot thanks to the knee injury that ruined everything the first time around, but he still had the soft hands and vision that had made him a 4th round pick coming out of junior hockey. Yes, he still had it. He knew he did. He just needed someone to take a shot.

Politics had been a thing to do while he worked his way back to competitive hockey. But things don't always go the way you plan. And politics had worked out a bit better than Wayne had ever imagined.

""Mr. LaFell?"" said Reggie over the intercom. ""The American delegation is here.""

""Send them in."" Wayne stood up and smoothed out his suit. *Canadian Foreign Minister* was the kind of job title he would have stuck his nose up at when he was a teenager, but he had to admit it wasn't such a bad job. Not a lot a work, a little bit of harmless graft, and plenty of respect. Best of all, he was never late for supper. Not bad for a broken winger.

The American contingency was three strong. A smallish man in glasses, another, more ""political"" looking fellow in Armani, and a third that looked like he wasn't there to talk. As Wayne suspected, the fellow in the Armani did most of the talking.

""Minister LaFell, pleasure to meet you,"" he said, offering a handshake. ""Ray Blunt, State Department."" He pointed at the smaller one in glasses. ""This is Karl Neiman from NASA. He's here as a reference. And this is Wilson Greer. I can't tell you where he's from."" Blunt winked, but Greer's face made it amply clear that it wasn't a joke.

""Have a seat,"" said Wayne, circling back around his desk. Blunt and Neiman sat. Greer remained standing. ""I'm a little surprised to see you folks. I assumed all your resources would be tied up with the Lexington Affair for the foreseeable future.""

""Ah,"" said Roy, leaning forward eagerly in his chair. ""And Lexington is *exactly* what we're here to talk about.""

Wayne felt his stomach drop slightly. ""I...is there some trouble? Are they...hostile?""

""No, no, no!"" said Roy. ""Not in the least. In fact, they are the very opposite of hostile. They are so *unhostile* in fact, that I am pleased to say that the United States of America has completed our business with the Visitors.""

""You've...I'm sorry, I don't know what that means.""

Roy glanced down at Neiman in a very meaningful way. ""We've completed all of our research,"" said Neiman. ""They...we're good.""

Wayne blinked. ""You're 'good'?""

""All done!"" said Roy, wiping his hands dramatically. ""Our scientists work fast.""

""Um...congratulations?""

""No, no,"" said Roy, shaking his head. ""Congratulations to *you*.""

""Me?""

""Yes. Minister LaFell, I am very excited to announce that the United States of America - as a show of neighborly solidarity - would like to transfer the Visitors to Canada for further...you know, research and such.""

After a moment Wayne became aware that his mouth was partially open. ""Er. Uh. You want to send the aliens....*to Canada*?"" Wayne's eyes swept back and forth between the three men.

Roy cleared his throat. Neiman spoke. ""We've done all we think we can do. We believe that *Canada* is better suited to...uh...continue this research.""

Wayne began to feel as though he were being pranked. Americans did love their pranks. ""You seriously believe that Canada would be suited to continue research on the first alien lifeforms ever encountered on our planet?""

Roy nodded. ""We didn't even consider Mexico. Straight to the top, so to speak."" 

""Well, what about..."" Wayne wracked his brain. ""Japan's pretty good with science things, aren't they? My TVs from Japan.""

""Not the right people for the job,"" said Roy. ""This is sensitive stuff here, Minister. It's not the science. These Visitors require a certain level of...uh...empathy. They are, after all, strangers in a strange land.""

""*Empathy*."" Wayne rolled the word around in his mouth like a caramel. Canadians *were* highly regarded for their kindness and sensitivity. Much less dangerous than America, as well. Very welcoming to immigrants and refugees. Yes, he could begin to see the value in relocating two frightened Visitors to someplace safe and quiet, like Canada. ""And your President is alright with this?""

""Suggested it himself,"" said Roy. ""Really values our relationship with Canada.""

Wayne looked at the scientist. ""And you think we're adequately equipped to make them comfortable? I don't know what kind of...""

""Oh yes,"" said Neiman. ""They really don't need much. Just a sympathetic ear and tub of lukewarm salt water.""

""Well,"" said Wayne. ""I'm not sure that I have the authority to...""

""I'm certain that you do,"" said Roy quickly. He got to feet and moved to the desk. ""So what do you say? Let's make Canada the home of the world's first verified extraterrestrials. Hockey, maple syrup, and aliens - that's what Canada is all about.""

Wayne felt the pressure of the moment and suddenly he was transported back in time. He was on the ice. The puck was on his stick and time was running down. 

*He could do this.*

*Take the shot - make the shot.*

""Let's do it!"" he said, bursting from his chair. Roy grabbed him in an unexpected bearhug. 

""Thatta boy!"" said Roy. ""Wilson, go get Dotti and Botti.""

""Dotti and Botti?"" said Wayne.

""Their names,"" said Roy as Wilson disappeared through the door.

""What do you mean he's going to get them?""

""They're out in the car,"" said Roy. 

""In the...""

Neiman dropped a pair of earplugs on the desk. ""Remember, lukewarm saltwater.""

""What're these for?"" said Wayne, picking up the earplugs. ""Are they loud or...""

""Those are for your nose,"" said Neiman. ""The excretions occur on a three hour cycle, so they should be due any minute. Whatever you do, don't touch the yellow pus, even with gloves on. It'll burn right through.""

""What are you...?""

Just then Wilson barged through the door, followed closely by two humanoid figures covered in shiny, crimson scales.

""Dotti and Botti,"" said Roy, ""this is Minister LaFell, representing the great nation of Canada. He'll be looking after you from now on.""

The two alien blinked serenely. One began to ooze slightly.

""That's our cue,"" said Roy. ""Been a pleasure, minister. Good luck! God save the Queen. Etc., etc.""

The three men stormed out of the room before Wayne could say another word.

Wayne cleared his throat. ""Uh. So....do you two speak English, perhaps?""

""Yes,"" said one. ""Did you decorate this office?""

""Um, no,"" said Wayne, ""but I did...""

""Was the intention to make its occupant too horror-stricken for their mind to wander?""

""I...""

The other alien motioned towards the far wall. ""This wallpaper has been scientifically engineered to induce vomiting, correct?""

""The scent you are wearing,"" said the first alien. ""Does it denote that you bear a contagious disease deadly to members of the opposite sex? Because I can find no other reason why one would intentionally scent themselves in such an unpleasant manner."" 

""Your facial hair has been constructed in an attempt at ironic humor, correct?""

Wayne collapsed back down into his chair as the aliens continued their observations.

""Sir?"" said Reggie. ""Did the Americans just leave those aliens here?""

Wayne sighed. ""It's a great day for Canada, Reggie.""

""Should I...should I call the Prime Minister's office?""

Wayne glanced up at the aliens. ""I do not believe this carpet is currently in style in any known timeline,"" said one.

""No,"" said Wayne. ""I don't think we'll tell him just yet.""     ",winsomeman,A Great Day for Canada (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4yseww/a_great_day_for_canada_wp/

SCENE: EXT. TERRACE - BLACKNIGHT CASTLE

A man LORD HUGO VATARIS sits atop an enormous warhorse. A CROWD OF PEASANTS holding simple spears and converted tools, stand in a semi-circle around the horse.

VATARIS: I know that for most of you, this will be your first experience with combat. You may be scared. You may be terrified. You may *think* that you will not survive this. If you have these thoughts, I ask only that you look at me. *Look* upon me as I sit astride this magnificent beast and tell me what you see.

WORMMOUTH: What we *see*, my Lord?

VATARIS: Aye. Tell me what you see.

Peasants look askance at one another.

FISH (shrugging): Fetal alcohol syndrome?

VATARIS: *WHAT?*

HORESMORE: Diabetes at *least*, right?

WORMMOUTH: There's got to be some sort of heart condition involved, I'd wager.

HORESMORE: A bit jaundiced, too. You think maybe liver poisoning?

VATARIS: I said LOOK at me, not diagnose me, you idiots. I'm *alive*. That's the damn point I'm trying to make. I'm alive. You lot all think one little skirmish might kill you, but look at me. Do you have any idea how many wars I've fought in? Any idea?

WORMMOUTH (raising hand): Three?

VATARIS (face turning noticeably redder): *Hundreds*! Literally, hundreds. And I've come out on top every time. You don't get to be a *warlord* winning only three wars. That's not a title they just toss about. You need a full ledger to be a warlord. So look at me and know that you aren't riding to defeat, because I'm here and *I have never ridden to defeat.* 

WORMMOUTH: Well....

VATARIS (scowling): Well *what*?

WORMMOUTH: Well, you lost at least the one time, right? Otherwise you wouldn't have the death sentence and you wouldn't be here, working us up for a suicide charge into the center of the Silver Wizard's army. 

FISH (nodding): Oooooh right. I remember that. You got drubbed something thorough, my lord.

HORESMORE: That the one where he lead an army 30,000 strong against the walls of Blacknight, held by only 2,000 men?

VATARIS (through gritted teeth): That's an oversimplification.

FISH: Never seen anything like it. They say it was the most improbable defeat in military history.

VATARIS: That's never been mathematically verified.

WORMMOUTH: Alright, so we look at you and remember all those fights where you *didn't* get drubbed - is that it?

FISH: Now all I can remember is the one where you got mopped up.

HORESMORE: Me too.

VATARIS: Then *don't* look at me. In fact, I want you all to close your eyes. Close your eyes and use your imagination. (*Closes own eyes*) Physical strength is only half the equation. The other half is mental strength. You need to *believe* you can win. So with your eyes closed, I want you to imagine the Silver Wizard standing before you. Imagine him with his fiery staff *Lothar* and his mightly Elven greatsword *WorldEnder*. Imagine him bearing down upon you in the field of battle, the white fire of *Lothar* reflected in the polished steel of *WorldEnder*. Imagine yourself, standing before him, armed only with your broken ploughshare and your fierce determination. Your every inch quivering with power and fear and bravery as *WorldEnder* rises above you, ready to...

WORMMOUTH: The imagination was very good, sir. Maybe a bit too good, though.

The only thing I know for certain right now is that I'm not supposed to be awake. The computer keeps telling me that my pod only opened as a safety precaution. *Bad data* caused a sensor misread which triggered a failsafe which caused me to wake up.

But I'm not supposed to *be* awake. And the computer won't shut up about it.

""Journey. To. *Where*?""

And then it goes silent again. Or goes back to the beginning, explaining why this whole thing is just a mistake so please get back in the pod Mr. 228-F. But I'm not going back because I have no idea what the hell is going on and the computer won't tell me.

So the computer's no help. Here's what I *do* know. 

I'm not alone. That part didn't require much detective work. There are three other pods besides mine. The casing's sort of frosted over, but I can tell it's two women and one man. The guy looks pretty bulky. One lady's got what looks like a tattoo of a constellation on her face. The other looks like a blank slate with hair. There's something taped to the inside of her shielding, but I can't see what it is from the back.  

Also, the computer's not full of shit when he says we're all supposed to stay in freeze from start to finish. This ship is *tiny*. Or...scratch that, actually. I don't know how big the ship is. All I know is that the chamber with the four pods is tiny and doesn't seem to connect to anything else. There's literally no place to go. So maybe this is just a little room in a big ship, or, more likely, this is just a really small automated ship, big enough to fly and carry around four people-pops.

**At present rates of consumption, you will deplete the available supply of breathable atmosphere in 31 hours, 12 minutes.**

""You're gonna let me die? I thought you were a caretaker?""

**That is the limit of the functionality of your pod's life support system under the present conditions. You are advised to return to your pod and resume HT-sleep.**

""Yeah, yeah.""

I keep waiting for something to come back to me. Some explanation of what I'm doing on this ship. But I've got nothing. I have a vague sense of who I used to be, but no specifics. No events. I'm assuming this is all a side effect of the HT-sleep, but I'm not even sure of that. The computer says it has no insight into my mental state, only basic physical functions.

""Is it prison or something? War? You have to know where the hell we're going.""

**I am caretaker protocol only. I have no interconnectivity with any of this ship's other functions, including navigational protocol. You will now run out of breathable atmosphere in 31 hours, 2 minutes.**  

""Do you at least understand *why* I don't want to get back in the pod?""

**I do not have access to the systems required to answer that question.**

""Well, I'm sorry. But no can do.""

I do nothing for a while. I have a sneaking suspicion this ""caretaker protocol"" knows more than it's saying. It has to, right? Why would all these systems be completely independent and fully ignorant of each other? Who builds a ship like this? And if amnesia's a common side effect, why wouldn't you program the damn thing to answer a few simple questions? 

""I'm gonna break one of them out."" I pick the blank slate. She's seems like she'd be the easiest to subdue if she doesn't take to defrosting quite as smoothly as I did.

**Do not manipulate or damage the other pods. Stay back from the other pods.**

""I want answers. That's all. Answer my questions and I'll get back in my pod.""

**I am caretaker protocol only. I am not...**

""I know. I know."" I search the pod up and down, looking for a way in. The edges are sealed smooth. There's no handle. Not even any buttons to push. ""No chance I can talk you into opening this one up, is there?""

**The pods cannot be opened until arrive at...**

""*Never-goddamn-mind.*"" I smash into the pod, shoulder first. It flinches back in its cradle - just a bit. It's enough to give me hope. I ram it again and again. 

**You are in danger of causing catastrophic bone, joint, and muscle damage. Do not manipulate or damage the other pods. Oxygen intake has increased. You will now run out of breathable atmosphere in 27 hours, 21 minutes.**

Over and over, I smash into the pod. It's the only thing I can do. It's the only hope I have. I can't just get back into that pod. I can't. Where am I going? I mean, *where the fuck am I going*?

By the time I finally stop I can't feel my arm anymore.

**No reading. Number 228-G has perished. Diverting power from pod.**

""What?"" The light inside the pod dims, then goes black. The frost clears almost instantly. ""What happened?""

**Number 228-G has perished. Her pod's life support system was damaged. She was deprived of atmosphere and perished.**

This is a joke. This is some sick, stupid joke.

My arm's useless, so I use my legs, kicking at the two remaining pods, one after the other. The computer screams the same warnings over and over, but it's all just a joke. A sick, dumb joke. My knee twists and I fall over, breathing hard.

""What a joke. What a joke.""

I spit on the ground, then stumble into my pod. ""I don't care. I don't care. Close it. Freeze me. I don't care.""

The shielding slips into place. There's something taped to the clear plastic in front of me, just at head height. It's a picture. A picture of a plain woman. But she isn't plain, is she? She just looked plain...just on first glance. On first glance she looks almost blank, but there's a light in her eyes and mischief in her smile and if you look long enough you may just...fall in love...

The cold comes, but just a second too late. Because now I remember. Oh god...I *remember*...    ",winsomeman,Caretaker (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4yl2w3/caretaker_wp/

""Of course we will,"" said David, his eyes half closed against the white-yellow sunlight that flickered through the cabin. ""It's the *city*, Nancy. They've got sweet shoppes and big libraries and real, chalked-up ball fields. They've got *everything*. We'll like it, for sure. What's not to like?""

Nancy's hand danced across the warm, bristly scruff of Ranger's neck. The white dog shuddered slightly as it slept, caught in a passing dream of conflict and triumph.

""It will be so *different* though,"" said Nancy. ""We'll hardly know anyone.""

""We'll know Aunt Ruth,"" said David. ""And we'll know each other. That's enough for a start, isn't it?""

""What about Henry?"" she said, motioning towards her younger brother, asleep at David's side. ""He's shy, you know. Don't you worry...""

""Who's shy?"" said Henry, cocking one open eye towards his sister. ""I'm not shy.""

""You're reserved,"" said Nancy.

""I was *reserved* in Baybrook,"" said Henry, closing his eyes and resettling himself. ""I won't be reserved in the city.""

""Can't afford to be,"" said David. ""You get swallowed up in the city if you can't stand up for yourself.""

Nancy wiped a bit of dog hair from her gloves. ""You talk like you know.""

""Remember?"" said David, tapping lazily on the glass of the window. ""I've been out to the city. Dad took me out to see the matches at the Colosseum for my birthday three years ago. Afterwards I saw two men fighting in the street. Two men, just throwing punches. It wasn't anything like the matches. It was...wild. And sort of ugly. I remember thinking someone was going to run out there and stop them. Actually, to be truthful, I thought Dad would. But he didn't. No one did. And one of the men got beaten so bad I don't know if he even lived.

""Afterwards, I asked Dad why he hadn't done anything and he said it wasn't our business. He said there's too many people doing too many things in the city for you to go around helping anyone. That's why you can't be shy in the city.""

""I'm *not* shy!"" said Henry, eyes still closed.

""People get into fights in the streets?"" said Nancy. ""Just...they go around hurting each other?""

David shrugged. ""I'm sure they had their reasons. Probably betting on the matches. Money makes people sour in the city. Just don't give anyone a reason to be cross with you and you'll be fine.""

The cabin became silent then. David closed his eyes and feigned sleep, while Nancy watched the wheat dance madly as the train rattled and lurched through the farmland. The tan waves had an almost hypnotic effect. Nancy's mind reeled backwards to Founder's Day. She saw her mother in the center of a rainbow pinwheel made of cloth banners and spinning men. The air seemed to vibrate with chants. She remembered reaching for her father's hand and the way he pulled his hand away. 

""David,"" she whispered, trying not to wake Henry.

Her older brother's eyes opened slightly. 

""Do you..."" She considered her question carefully. ""Do you think about Mom? Ever?""

His eyes closed. ""No.""

Nancy felt her face get warm. Her fingers dug hard into Ranger's neck, waking the dog. ""Because she was...""

""She wasn't our mother,"" said David. ""You can't be *that* and be a mother. Not really. Everyone knows that.""

""She was our mother,"" said Nancy softly. ""She took good care of us. Why doesn't that matter? She loved us. Did she ever forget a birthday or fail to make you feel better when you were hurt? Did she ever...""

""She's gone,"" said David. ""I don't want to talk about her.""

Nancy left her brother alone. She tried to sleep, but when she closed her eyes she saw the white tree and nearly screamed.

""I don't think she was bad."" Nancy looked up and realized that Henry was awake and talking to her. ""I know what they say about her kind, but you're right. She loved us. Remember when I broke my arm and when I woke up it was fine again? Why would she do that if she didn't love us? Why would she do something so dangerous?""

Nancy nodded. Henry hadn't been there on Founder's Day. Her father had given the boy a mug of sweetmilk spiked with brandy and left him sleeping at home. As far as Nancy knew, Henry hadn't even understood the significance of the white tree that had sprouted up overnight in their backyard. 

David had known, however. And when the men came to collect their mother, he had simply sat on the front steps and watched.

Nancy had assumed that Henry's broken arm had been the key, but it wasn't. No one else had ever known about the arm. The suspicion had begun during the harvest the previous year. Nancy's father grew cabbage and carrots and potatoes. Nancy hadn't known this, but apparently the winter freeze had come too late or too early. In any regard, their crop was plentiful in a way that made their neighbors jealous - and at least one suspicious.

Heyman Goold suspected that something unnatural was afoot. In an effort to prove his theory, he shot Ranger. The dog should have died, but it did not. 

So Goold planted the seed of a wild ash tree in their front lawn. The wild ash is known for being receptive to magic. Under normal circumstances there is nothing out of the ordinary in the way they grow. But in the presence of magic they grow suddenly - and turn white as dust.

On the train, Nancy nearly laughed to think of herself that morning. She awoke so alive and full of cheer. Founders Day! There would be singing and dancing and maybe, just maybe Rory Cashin would ask her for one of those dances.

But when she stepped out of their house that morning the first thing she saw was her father, standing very still just beyond the doorway. She stepped around him and saw the white tree and fell to her knees. She felt all the good and the joy and the promise of her life drain away from her. She felt so fearful that vomited there, in the grass.

Heyman Goold came with men. And they took Nancy's mother away.

There had not been a witch in Baybrook for some 50 years. They had to consult a torn, old book to remember what to do.

They chanted and spun as the fire built and built. All the while Nancy's mother stood, serene and patient. 

When it was over, those gathered simply wandered away, tired and unsatisfied.

Ten days later, the children were placed on a train for the city. 

""I'll follow, eventually,"" their father had said. ""Be good to Ruth. Be good to each other.""

Nancy could not help but notice the way her father would not look her in the eyes.

""She wasn't a bad witch,"" said Henry. Nancy could see the tears slipping down his ruddy cheeks. ""And she was still our mother.""

""She wasn't a witch at all,"" whispered Nancy to no one but herself. As Henry settled back into sleep, she pulled the glove off her right hand and admired the faint glow of white light that pulsed from her fingertips. ""I'm sorry, Mom,"" she said, clenching her fist tight. Diffused by the flesh of her closed hand, the light glowed blood red. ""I'll look after them. I'll never let anyone hurt us again.""",winsomeman,The White Tree (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4ydfm1/the_white_tree_wp/

""That's just the pitch office,"" grunted Satan, leading the way down a narrow hallway, cabled end to end with buzzing florescents. ""I only use that for sales purposes. I spend more than 2 hours a day in there the room's gonna reek of sulfur and I really can't afford to lose my deposit. In here.""

He gestured towards a small room with no door. ""Yeah, it used to be janitor's closet. That's the grind, kid.""

Satan stumped into the room, grabbing the only chair (a bent, metal folding chair) and leaning back against the wall. ""Say your piece.""

I propped myself casually against the opposite wall, elbow-to-concrete, fist-to-chin. ""Well, it's simple. I want my soul back.""

Satan laughed, then reached down and began to pick absently at his cloven hooves. ""Contract is unbreakable. Not in this lifetime. Not in this plane of existence. Not in the past or the future. Forever and ever, your soul belongs to me.""

I tried to keep it cool. ""Well, sure. But I think we can both agree there was a fair amount of misrepresentation happening during that pitch of yours.""

""No, no. No."" Satan shook his head, the curved horns waggling like twin snakes. ""It's all in the fine print. I'm not responsible if you can't be bothered to read a contract before you sign it. And I didn't promise you anything that you can't have. All that stuff we talked about - including all the super sick shit everyone pretends they're not into, even though it's the stuff they're *most* into - that's all yours. You just gotta hit the numbers.""

""Yeah, but you have to admit - a *thousand* souls is a lot of souls. I'm not sure I've even *seen* a thousand different people in my whole life.""

Satan waved his hand. ""Sit sit. You're getting yourself too worked up over this.""

I took a seat on the floor in front of Satan.

""A thousand *is* a lot,"" agreed Satan. ""But only if you think about it as a single number. You need to get a lot more granular with this. How about one a day? Just one a day? That'll take you less than four years.""

""I don't know,"" I said, covertly attempting to create additional space between myself and the Dark Lord. What he had said earlier about the sulfur smell was potentially an understatement. ""Not everyone wants demonic powers. Certainly not enough to sell their soul...""

""Ah!"" said Satan. ""There's the trick, isn't it? You need *souls*. That's all. Doesn't really matter what you trade to get them. Someone doesn't want dark powers, fine. Find out what they DO want.""

""Like what?""

Satan shrugged. ""Well, if you've got a sports fan, say. And they want their team to win the Super Bowl - that's where you swoop in.""

My mouth hung open a moment. ""How am I supposed to manage that? I can't control who wins the Super Bowl!""

""Of course not,"" said Satan. ""Neither can I. Neither can God. That's strictly an Illuminati thing. BUT - that's doesn't mean you can't make the deal. You hear someone say *I'd sell my soul to see the Browns win a Super Bowl* you jump in there! Except maybe not that example. You don't want to out yourself as a fraud. But if someone's offering up their soul, you take it. Then, if their team by some chance *does* win - BOOM! Easy money. And if their team loses, well whatever. Nothing gained, nothing lost.""

""Is that ethical?""

Satan blinked. ""What the hell?""

""Right,"" I said. ""So if someone offers up their soul for a trade, I can take the offer. And do nothing?""

""Exactly. The world is chaos, man. Sometimes people get what they want. I mean, they were going to get it anyway. But they don't know that. So, you know - may as well let them give you their soul.""

""I suppose that's reasonable.""

Satan adjusted his tie. ""And don't underestimate how many people out there would like demonic powers. All the fire and mind control and pestilence and such. You get a handful of people out there working for you, and they get a few people working for them, bing bang boom, you're rolling in souls in no time.""

I nodded. I had to admit, I felt much more at ease. ""And the...uh...the great leathery wings?""

""Ah, well, that's not really a demonic power,"" said Satan. ""More of an accessory. If you're really keen on wings, I'm sure we could make that happen for you, but technically, not part of the deal.""

I popped up to my feet. Satan held out a hand and I helped him to his feet as well. 

""I could tell,"" said Satan. ""Right when I saw you. I said *Here's a guy who gets it*. Glad to have you on the team.""

""Thanks for the time,"" I said. ""Incidentally, what are you going to do with my soul?""

""Sell it to Amazon,"" said Satan. ""They're apparently great for packing boxes.""

""Ah."" I left Satan there in his doorless office and went out into the street. I saw a homeless man standing on the corner with a sign asking for food or money.

""Sir,"" I said to the homeless man. ""I'd like to walk you over to that restaurant and buy you a steak. Would that be okay?""

The homeless man's eyes went wide. He nodded vigorously.

""Excellent!"" I said, putting my hand on the man's back and directing him towards the restaurant. ""There's just the matter of some paperwork I need you to sign first.""",winsomeman,Pyramid of the Damned (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4ya9hs/pyramid_of_the_damned_wp/

_______________________________________________

Faith was an ancient anathema. Violent. Senseless. 

When Silver Slip had been young - before the training, before the mindcrest had been placed in the hollow chamber below his frontal lobe - he had marveled at the stories of golden civilizations, brought high by the fervent toil of the faithful; later crushed to ash and cinder by that same wild worship.

The crested had no time for his questions in those days. It served no purpose to alleviate a single boy of his soft wondering. So Silver Slip was left to imagine. 

*To believe in things that cannot be seen...*

*To believe in things that cannot be proven...*

*To live and die and kill and create for things that never were and never could be...*

He could not grasp it. Even uncrested, his imagination was not strong enough.

As a man, though - as a chosen Delegate, fully primed, synaptic ratios in the 99th percentile of his birthing stable - he understood at least why such things could not be tolerated in the growing reaches of the Collective. 

""They are gathered, sir.""

Silver Slip turned from the window to face the young officer. ""My apologies. I do not recall your name.""

""Yellow Pall,"" said the young officer.

""Is this your first Refutation?""

Yellow Pall nodded. ""I did serve on one of the initial scouting missions to this planet. I am familiar with the four largest belief systems.""

""But not all?"" said Silver Slip. 

""There are thousands,"" said the young officer. ""Fractured versions of the major systems, themselves fractured versions of an original worship that no longer exists. It would not be efficient to fully research all variations, especially when some are practiced by only a handful.""

""A handful is enough,"" said Silver Slip. ""Fire is never content. Corrupted cells do not have the good grace to simply die. The corrupt others. You are right, though. If today goes well, it will not matter. And that is up to me. Lead the way.""

Yellow Pall tied back the white canvas covering and stepped out of the caravan. Sliver Slip followed, careful to walk slowly, without fault.

The crowd beyond was staggering, and more staggering still for its silence. None spoke. 

The planet featured two forms of intelligent life, one of the earth, and the other of the sea. By some chance, these non-competing lifeforms had not managed to master cross-species communication and so were viewed by the Collective as wholly separate. Opal Chance had been commissioned with the Refutation of the sea species.

The land creatures were of a similar shape and size as Silver Slip's people. Their forelimbs were significantly longer and thinner, their hindlimbs bowed and thick. The danger, should there be any, would likely come from those heavy hindlimbs.

They had no necks, their heads fused to a torso that could rotate a full 180 degrees in either direction. Their eyes were wide and double-lidded, most likely an evolutionary reaction to the planet's extended periods of darkness.

""Thank you for extending such great hospitality and trust,"" said Silver Slip, his naturally resonant voice carrying like a thunderclap across the gathered crowd. Two of the natives had volunteered to become translators. Learning the speech naturally would have taken too long, so they were provided with modified mindcrests to hasten the process.

""You have been selected for inclusion into our Collective. This is both an honor and a great responsibility. The Collective was formed in a time long since past for the purpose of peace. That is all. Peace and prosperity. We discovered that all may prosper in this immense universe, but only through a strict, unbending adherence to reason and fact. In the Collective there are no beliefs. There are facts. There is no worship. There is truth - plain and clear as the black nothingness that spreads between the stars.

""We believe that you thrive as a member of the Collective, but first you must set aside all that cannot be proven. All that you accept, but cannot verify, must be set free. This is your faith. These are your Gods.""

Sliver Slip paused to allow the crowd to consider his words. He expected turmoil. Cries. Shouting. Here was where it truly began - the Refutation. None had ever given away their faith without a struggle.

But the crowd remained silent. The translators looked back at Silver Slip, awaiting his next words.

""Do you understand?""

One of the crowd stepped forward. Silver Slip had not yet learned how to identify gender among the species, so he was unsure if this was a man or a woman or one of the null-gendered who often served as tribal leaders. It spoke briefly.

""Quay says we do not understand how one may set aside their God,"" said one of the translators.

""It is simple,"" said Silver Slip. ""You accept that they do not exist. There *are* no gods. There are no spirits. There is nothing that cannot be explained. I ask that you accept the real and reject the unreal.""

The one called Quay spoke once more. 

""How do we determine what is real and what is unreal?"" said the other translator.

Silver Slip gestured to Yellow Pall. ""Which is the most popular creation myth?""

""Mother Gronda,"" said Yellow Pall. ""The great mother figure who...""

""Yes, yes, I know."" Silver Slip turned to the crowd. ""Gronda. Who seeded the earth? And toiled a thousand years to make the world fertile? She is unreal. There is no evidence of her. She is a lie, told to explain a truth you were not yet ready to understand. But there is a real truth. The formation of life here began with a single-celled organism. This can be proven. This is real.""

Silver Slip pointed to the sky. ""Alacant, who brings you rain? Is not real. We can show you where the rain comes from. We can prove its origin. That is real. If you leave your false beliefs behind you can come with us. You can join the Collective. And there will be no war and no famine. We will provide you with everything you need to live, free from pain and destruction.""

Silver Slip stepped back as the translators finished his speech. Again there was silence. Finally, Quay spoke once more.

""What is the difference?"" said the translator. ""What is the difference between the way we believe, which we understand, and the way you believe, which we do not understand? Is not understanding the most important part? To believe what you believe requires an even *greater* amount of faith.""

Yellow Pall shook his head. ""We were wrong about this place,"" he said bitterly. ""They are not ready. This is a waste.""

""No,"" said Silver Slip. ""This simply means they cannot join as full, honored members. Not yet. In a few generations...perhaps. But for now...""

Silver Slip opened a channel back to *The Gharthin*.

""Ensign. There's an orchard 2.85 leagues southwest of my location and a cattle yard 0.7 leagues east of that. Destroy them both.""

""Aye.""

Silver Slip stepped forward once more. ""You are right. Understanding is all that matters. So I ask that you understand this: your gods cannot protect you, because they are not real. Your gods cannot send you water or food, because they are not real. Your gods cannot give you medicine or heal your sick, because *they are not real.* But I am real. My people are real. The Collective is real. And we can do things your gods have never thought to do.""

The sky above turned pink as a distant screech filled the air. The sonic wail grew louder and louder until finally two fiery red columns of light pierced the atmosphere above, slamming into the earth somewhere to the south. The resultant *CRACK* came screaming across the massive crowd like a shockwave, sending those gathered scattering in a wild panic. 

The air smelled of ion, burning wood, and rendered fat.

""This way is longer,"" said Silver Slip, as Yellow Pall followed him back into the caravan. ""And not ideal. But in the end...in the end everything will be as it should.""

The caravan headed off towards the encampment, the air thick with screams and pleas that could not be heard, because no one was listening.            ",winsomeman,The Delegate (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4ya9b8/the_delegate_wp/

There was simply no reasoning with that woman.

""VULTURES! THIEVES!"" she shrieked. The man seemed a bit more sensible, but only inasmuch as he was not himself shouting at anyone just then. ""SHAKEDOWN ARTISTS! MONSTERS!""

""This is *eternity* madam,"" I said, my level voice floating just above her tantrum. ""Don't you think your mother deserves the most comfortable possible resting place for the next phase of her journey?""

""IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!"" the woman continued to shout. ""SHE'S DEAD! WHAT DOES SHE CARE ABOUT COMFORT?""

A wailing woman crossed the showroom floor just then, distracting my client just long enough for me to regain control of the pitch. ""The price is steep, I understand. And you may question whether or not your mother will be able to properly *appreciate* all the luxuries offered by this model. But I can assure you - *it makes a difference*.""

The man pointed across the showroom. ""How about that one?""

""You don't want that one,"" I said quickly. ""Cheap, thin wood. Not airtight. Hardly take any effort at all to get out - *in*. In. Very easy for...worms and such to get in and defile the remains.""

""But she's dead, right?"" said the man. ""Seems like that's the natural thing, innit?""

""Right!"" said the woman. ""Natural. She loved nature, Mum did. You remember how she always liked to sit in the garden and write those angry letters to celebrities?""

""Nature,"" said the man, nodding. 

""Why does she need a box at all?"" said the woman excitedly. ""We ought to just put her in the ground, in the garden. Natural. That's how they used to do it back her day anyway.""

""I can assure you that is not accurate,"" I said. ""And if you're so strongly opposed to a casket, again, I believe it's time to reconsider cremation.""

""FIEND!"" screamed the woman. ""Burn her body to ash? You horrid man! And besides, that's more expensive than the damn casket.""

""For just a bit of fire, too,"" said the man. ""I can't figure it.""

""Listen,"" I said, pulling the pair towards the cheapest model I could recommend in good conscience. ""You can't just put her in the ground. That's a health hazard. Your township would never go for it. Moreover, it's dangerous. You've got to take my word on that. You don't want your mother buried in your garden unboxed. That will...not be pleasant for you. So you either need to cremate her or you need to put her in a casket. This one is 25 percent less expensive than that other one. Strong wood. Steel rods for reinforcement. Airtight - double seal.

The man and the woman looked at each for a moment. 

""And you called the animal shelter?"" said the woman.

The man nodded. ""They don't do human cremation.""

""What about online?""

""What about it?""

The woman sighed. ""Did you look up caskets online? Everything's cheaper online.""

""No. No, didn't think to do that.""

The woman smiled. ""I bet they've got real cheap caskets online. And online they won't sass and moan like this one."" Here she jerked a clawed thumb in my direction. ""Let's go. I bet we can find a great deal and we can use the savings on a cruise or something.""

""Your Mum liked boats,"" said the man. ""She'd like us to go on a cruise.""

The pair began to exit the showroom. ""Wait!"" I cried. ""You don't want to buy here. That's fine. Do as you will. But here's something to consider - her brain.""

""Her *brain*?"" said the man.

""Yes,"" I said. ""Her brain. I'm sure you'd agree she doesn't need it anymore. Why not donate it to science?""

""Science?"" The woman let the word roll slowly off her tongue, like a gob of frozen molasses. ""And what's science gonna give me for it?""

I blinked. ""Ten dollars.""

The woman sniffed. The man sniffed in reply. 

""Mum always did like science,"" said the woman.

""Yeah,"" said the man. ""Always mad for science.""

I sighed silently as I removed a ten dollar bill from my wallet. Why is that the people least worth saving always take the most effort? ",winsomeman,You Can't Save Everyone (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4ya92c/you_cant_save_everyone_wp/

____________________________________________________

Mary Stevenson found her son where she always found him at 7am: wrapped around the mini-fridge on the concrete floor of the basement wearing nothing but a pair of over-matched white undies and a physiologically unlikely amount of body hair.

""Darrell, get the hell up! You can't be late for work again.""

Darrell Stevenson awoke with a snort and a fart. ""Wha? Why? Yes? M'up. M'up. Okay.""

Mary shook her head. Was it the drugs, she wondered? Yes, the doctor had suggested rather strongly that hard drugs during pregnancy *could* adversely effect the baby, but cocaine wasn't really a hard drug, and besides - it was the 80s. How was any sane woman supposed to make it through the 1980s without cocaine and quaaludes?

""You lose your job, you're out of here. You hear me? And what the hell were you up to last night?"" Mary stomped to Darrell's lopsided, secondhand Ikea desk and started picking through the various loose sheets of paper and spiral-bound notebooks.

Darrell pulled himself to his feet and considered his hands for a moment. For some reason his right wrist hurt. The most likely culprit - at least from a historical standpoint - seemed to be over-masturbation, but Darrell left himself open to the possibility of simply having slept on it funny. He decided he would run some tests in the shower.

""This is all crazy talk,"" said Mary, shuffling through the pages.

""What?"" said Darrell, retrieving his work pants from behind the pull out couch.

""All this stuff on your desk,"" said Mary. ""You've got his one thing here - *Bi-partisan student loan reform.* Since when have you had any student loans?""

Darrell shrugged. ""Um. Maybe it's about that one time Jimmy Parsons loaned me three dollars for lunch.""

""When was that?""

Darrell considered this, which involved a good bit of finger counting. ""1991.""

""Well, you've got a whole goddamn *notebook* about Jimmy Parsons' $3 then."" Mary tossed the notebook aside. ""And what's this? This sounds pretty perverted.""

Darrell padded across the cold, gray floor and took the stapled pages from his mother. ""*Gender In-e-qua...Inequality in the Workplace - A Solution to America's Opportunity Gap.* Huh.""

""Who's *gap* is that about, anyway?"" said Mary, swatting Darrell across the back of the head. ""Sounds like pornography to me.""

""Mom, I don't write pornography,"" said Darrell. All the same, he found himself quickly scanning the document for any good bits. He briefly got excited when he saw something about women getting taken advantage of, but that didn't amount to much. He tossed the papers into the bin. ""I must have some sort of sleep disease,"" he suggested. ""Like sleepwalking, but I just sit here and write out a bunch of nonsense instead.""

""Paper's not free, you know,"" said Mary, picking up yet another notebook, this one titled *ISIS - Decoding Patterns of Movement.* ""You used up both sides, too! Can't even write on the back.""

""Well, I can't help it, can I?"" said Darrell. 

""Can't you sleep-do-something-helpful instead? Like sleep-clean-the-gutters?""

Darrell yawned, pushing the rest of the notebooks and papers into the trashcan. ""That's not how the human brain works. It's complicated, mom. You wouldn't understand.""

""I understand you're *going to be late*!"" She pushed her son towards the stairs. ""No 20 minute shower this time. Move move move. Airport's not going to security itself. Let's go!""

""Alright, alright,"" said Darrell, stifling another sigh as he slowly trudged his way up the stairs. Halfway up, his brain was suddenly assaulted with a barrage of vague, but pressing memories. He saw images of smiling children. He saw war-torn nations rebuilt in a wave of goodwill and neighborly love. He saw weapons dismantled. He saw dying species replenished and green forests renewed. He saw hands clasped.

The images held a moment, just on the edge of memory, teetering as Darrell reached out to grab them. Then his stomach gurgled.

""Mom? Do we have any Eggos left?""

""No.""

""Shit."" Darrell turned back to the memories, only to find that they had all fallen over the edge into oblivion - never to be recovered. ""What about Pop-Tarts?""       ",winsomeman,Lunar Genius (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4y811i/lunar_genius_wp/

The Quiet Man looked out over his crew. They were putting on a brave face, he had to give them that.

""We'll get 'im this time,"" said Wesley, the runt of the pack, all bushy-headed and gap-toothed. ""We covered it all.""

The rest all nodded, smiling their tired little smiles. It was almost heartbreaking. 

""My boys,"" whispered The Quiet Man. They'd followed him so far. He hoped they wouldn't have to follow him much farther.

""We jacked the central satellite feed,"" said Resbo, hunched over his little laptop, wire frame glasses slipping down his sweaty nose. ""Give the signal and we'll punch into every channel.""

The Quiet Man nodded. ""Just make sure the volume's up."" The crew all laughed at that one. He waved his hand. A red light began to blink over the top of the camera.

""We got it!"" hissed Resbo. ""Every channel!""

""Good evening,"" said The Quiet Man, speaking slowly and softly into the camera. ""I apologize for the interruption, but I have some important information to share. My crew and I have placed bombs at several crucial locations throughout the city. One hundred locations, to be exact. Those bombs are set to explode at...""

""Shit!"" shouted Resbo, swatting at his laptop like it was infested with ants. ""The feed's gone! They cut us out already.""

""Not *they*,"" said The Quiet Man, leaning back in his chair. ""He's here.""

The building shook. In the near distance came a horrid *CRACK*, and then another, but louder...and then another, louder still...and then another...

The ceiling above the center of the room suddenly exploded in a cloud of steel, wood, and dry wall. As the dust settled, a man appeared before them, clad in form-fitting red and yellow, trailed by a white and red cape.

""I'm sorry, Quiet Man,"" the caped man bellowed. ""But you've been...*cancelled*.""

""Did he break through every floor to get here?"" said Syed, moving to look up the fresh alleyway of holes. ""We're like 30 floors from the top...""

""*Amazing Man*,"" said The Quiet Man, too worn down to achieve quite the right balance of surprise and disdain. ""I wondered when you would show...""

""A foolish plan, Quiet,"" roared Amazing Man. ""With my extra-thermic vision I'm the best Hide and Seek player in the universe. I've already found and destroyed all one hundred bombs.""

The Quiet Man laughed, though his heart wasn't really in it. ""Did you really think there were only one hundred?""

Amazing Man's face fell, but only by fractional degrees. Without another word, he blasted up and out of the den, being sure to carve a fresh path as he went.

""He's gonna find the other bombs, isn't he?"" said Wesley.

""Duh,"" said Syed.

""Shouldn't we..."" But Wesley didn't get to finish his thought, because just then Amazing Man had finished barreling through another set of load-bearing walls.

""Done!"" shouted Amazing Man. ""Thanks to my ability to travel at near light speed, I was able to locate the remaining...""

""Yes! Got it,"" said The Quiet Man. ""Unfortunately for you, the bombs were just a ruse. You see, I coated the shell of each bomb with a polymer infused with *Gorphinite* - your secret weakness!""

Wesley cheered. The rest of the crew remained wearily optimistic. 

""A single bomb wouldn't contain enough Gorphinite to harm you, but by touching all 165 bombs, you have inadvertently *poisoned* yourself and condemned yourself to a slow, torturous...what are you doing?""

Amazing Man had stopped listening. He was too busy rooting around in his utility belt. ""Antidote. They don't call me the World's Greatest Scientist for no reason.""

""I've never heard that,"" said Syed.

Amazing Man found a small injector and dosed himself in the thigh. 

""Well, that's fine,"" said The Quiet Man, ""but you see, I knew you would also...do that, which is why NOW JOEY!""

Joey, who had until that moment been sitting in the back, mostly minding his own business, leapt up and pulled a metal lever. A dome of pale blue light encircled Amazing Man. Sparks flew when he reached out to touch the walls of his new jail.

""Celestial Waves!"" shouted The Quiet Man hoarsely. ""I stole a generator from the K'Kwayra ship that crashed in Chicago last year. There is no escape now, so-called *Amazing..*oh for Christ's sake...""

Amazing Man had one eye closed and was leaning back, sighting up the tip of the wave projector. A thin beam of red light flashed from his eye into the infinitesimal mouth of the projector. The pale blue walls shuddered and disappeared.

""Shit,"" breathed Joey, while Resbo chucked his laptop through one of the many new holes in the room.

The Quiet Man nodded. ""You win."" He held up his wrists. ""I ask only leniency for my men. They are good men, easily rehabilitated.""

""Aw, don't say that boss,"" said Syed.

Amazing Man, however, laughed. ""Jail? For you? No no, my friend. You're my most entertaining adversary. The extra bombs? The Gorphinite? The Celestial Waves? You're one of a kind. You were thwarted today, but you escaped capture. Live to fight another day, right?""

Wesley frowned. ""So we're free to go?""

""Well not *you*,"" said Amazing Man. ""*He's* a criminal genius. You're just a goon. I have to bring the goons in, at least. Looks pretty bad otherwise.""

""Wouldn't it be better if you got me and not them?"" asked The Quiet Man. 

""Not for me, no,"" said Amazing Man. ""Now run along. I'm sure we'll meet again. Someday soon, I hope."" 

Then Amazing Man turned around to face the rest of the crew. ""As for you guys...do me a favor and stand together as close as you can. I'm going to go rip out some rebar to wrap you up with.""

The Quiet Man watched as his faithful crew slowly crowded together.

""It's okay, boss,"" said Wesley. ""You keep at it. Find a new crew. I think that's what we'd all want."" The rest all nodded and murmured their assent. ""You'll get 'im next time. Next time for sure.""

The Quiet Man made for the last remaining stairwell. Turning back one last time, he saw Wesley, tied to his brothers with thin bands of steel, smiling and giving a final thumbs up.

""I'll get him,"" he whispered to himself. ""I'll get him next time.""",winsomeman,Ballad of the Quiet Man (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4xa7d9/ballad_of_the_quiet_man_wp/

____________________________________________________

Okay, so the good news was this: deadlock. A ten-way tie across the board. Oh the joyous irony that my family's staunch inability to agree on *anything* should extend into the afterlife. If my family were ever forced to serve on the same jury, the justice system would immediately collapse, catch fire, and turn into magma. These were the same people who turned an argument about tipping the valet into a full-on mace-and-car-keys death brawl across the parking lot of a mid-priced steakhouse. 

I guess what I'm saying is I shouldn't have been surprised.

The bad news - which was equally unsurprising - was the across the board horridness of their votes.

Cousin Meghean (and no, I'm *not* spelling that wrong) voted that I should be reincarnated as a salamander. I'm rather certain this was because I once put a salamander in her hair. When I was *five.* You would think to hear her tell it, that the ""Salamander Attack of '89"" was solely responsible for:

*Meghean being held back in the seventh grade

*Meghean becoming addicted to Adderall

*Meghean getting caught having sex with her manager in the employee bathroom at Wendy's

*Meghean wearing that ghoulish, clown hair perm to her sister's second wedding

Aunt Rita, who's greatest accomplishment in life was growing a mustache bushy enough to cover her harelip, voted that I should be reincarnated as a termite. If I had to guess, I'd say this was a form of a delayed revenge for the time I accidentally fell down and chipped the crown moulding in her living room with a blunt object. That blunt object being my head, naturally. As a result, I needed 32 stitches in my forehead and a job, apparently, because Rita forwarded me a bill in the mail for the repairs. I was six. I never did pay, leading Rita to bestow on me the nickname ""Termite Boy."" 

Let's see, what else have we got here...

Ah. So, my grandmother - Naymah, as she insisted on being called, even though I always thought Louise was a lovely name - voted for slug. That one's probably self-explanatory, but let me provide some context. 

When I was a nine, my parents sent me and my sister to go stay with ""Naymah"" during the summer. We were told this was our *vacation*, but one suspects that different terminology must have been used when my parents brokered this friendly exchange of assets. You see, Naymah was under the impression that - for the low, low price of a pair of lumpy beds, a pile of bland sandwiches, and an endless well of pre-mixed Tang - she had purchased herself a summertime slave force, capable of extraordinary, nigh-inhuman feats of labor. At one point we even re-tarred the driveway.

All of which probably seems like a lot, but then again, you're not an awful, old goblin woman. Naymah was *not* impressed with the best efforts of our frail, pre-pubescent bodies.

""Get up and get back to work, you lazy slugs!"" she was fond of shouting at 4 o'clock in the morning. So I suppose *slug* is an apt choice by her standards.

Grandpa Reggie - or *Gamp* as he rather bafflingly wished to be called - was Naymah's husband, until he died when I was four years old. I'm still not quite how I wronged him. Or maybe he's just a fan of largemouth bass. I'm told he was quite the fisherman. Anyway, that's what he voted for. 

Grammie Reya was a short, little cream puff of a woman, with chocolate brown hair and veins filled with custard. She was a grotesquely sweet woman, never short on wet, toffee-scented kisses, but only to your face. When I was little, she reveled in telling me all the most lurid gossip involving friends and neighbors I had never met. Lots of whores in Grammie Reya's neighborhood, to hear her tell it. 

Anyway, Grammie thinks I should spend my next life as a titmouse. I genuinely have no idea what that's about.

Alright, what else...

Cousin Dev - voted for a dung beetle. I think he was just going for a poop joke there. Always a big fan of poop jokes, Dev.

Uncle Ray - voted for velociraptor. Which doesn't count, because those don't exist at the moment. Going out on a limb, I'm going to say Ray probably just watched *Jurassic Park* recently.

Aunt Teresa - voted for an amoeba. Teresa was a sixth grade science teacher, so that's why that even occurred to her. As to why? Oh! At Dev's seventh birthday party I broke the pinata on one swing. Dev cried all day and threw his cake on the ground. Teresa always blamed me for that.

Boy, I really burned a lot of bridges before my balls dropped, didn't I?

What else...what else...

Cousin Thom - voted for sea cucumber. Because they look like penises. That one's not personal.

And last...hey. Shit.

Myra voted? Myra shouldn't be able to...

Oh goddamnit...GODDAMNIT.

She was in the fucking car with me. GODDAMNIT.

I didn't even...I didn't think... 

My sister voted. She voted for me to be a human again. 

Well...

So that must be the vote they called me to. Myra's vote. It's about to start.

The first one I remember was Tommy Dorlet out on the playground in the 2nd grade. He fell off the top of the monkey bars, headfirst, like a fucking rocket. Right onto me. 

Separated my shoulder and broke my forearm. But Tommy was alright. He gave me his shitty torn up Griffey All-Star card as a thank you. 

Yeah. Big welcome there, Tommy. Bottom of my heart.

It all just kinda went from there.

Next day I saved someone in the hospital. Orderly. Slipped and fell in the hallway. Thankfully I was scooting past just then on my wheelchair. That one only cost me a mild concussion.

On and on it went. Every day, some other schmuck or idiot nearly died, except, *whoops* here's Johnny! I'm a regular Superman, if Superman was constantly getting physically and emotionally battered in the process. 

Example: Junior prom. I asked Judy Vesey to go with me. I'd had a crush on her for *years*. And when I finally worked up the nerve and asked her she said, ""Why?"" So I explained. I talked her up. Talked about how pretty she was and how smart and how cool. Any way, long story short, she said ""no."" BUT, years later, she told me I actually saved her life that day. Turns out she was about to kill herself, but my little pep talk saved the day.

I went to the junior prom by myself, FYI.

And on and on. Like I said, it's been every goddamn day. 

Last month I was biking to work. Drunk driver runs me off the road and into a telephone poll. ""I coulda killed someone!"" he says. Yeah, no shit. You almost killed *me*, asshole. 

Doris at work, acting all flirty at the Christmas party, feeds me one of those fancy puff pastry things. Turns out it had shellfish in it. ""I'm deathly allergic to shellfish!"" she says. Oh really? You know who else is? Me, goddamnit! Although, I guess a little less deathly than Doris.

It's gotten to the point I don't like leaving the house unless I have to, but even that doesn't stop it. I accidentally saved like 20 Comcast customer service reps once just by calling right before closing. A fucking satellite fell in the parking lot while they were waiting for my rep to finish the call! *And no one even fixed my fucking internet!* What's the goddamn point of it?

I don't know. I don't know what to do anymore. Even when I don't do anything and I sleep in all day, I just know - I *know* - that I somehow saved someone by sitting around all day. It's nerve rattling! You know how many babies I've caught in my life? 122! Where the fuck do all these flying babies come from? People! Hold on to your goddamn babies!

I don't know. I don't know.

____________________________________________________

It wasn't until the architect's presentation that Rahmet finally began putting two and two together.

Prior to that he'd not put much weight behind King Esset's many vague allusions to Rahmet's ""duty in the afterlife."" To Rahmet, this simply sounded like a good bit of job security. Esset - who was exceptionally ancient and literally *soaking* in an Alexandrian library's worth of exotic venereal diseases - was going to die, but then Rahmet would stay on as his assistant. He could manage Esset's many assets and answer any late arriving mail. Really, when one had as many irons in the fire as King Esset, merely being dead wasn't exactly going to clear the books.

So Rahmet was a touch unnerved to see included in the designs for King Esset's final resting place a special office just off the main burial chamber. Even more concerning was the fact that this particular space was labelled, quite boldly, as **RAHMET'S OFFICE**.

""Will that be enough space?"" asked King Esset. ""It seems to be about the same size as your present office.""

""Enough space, my pharaoh?"" gulped Rahmet.

""You're quite right,"" said Esset. ""Better bring it out a few feet. Can't have my top man feeling cramped in the next world.""

Rahmet didn't have a reply for this, and so sat silently watching as the architect explained the inspiration behind his take on the King's proposed Lamborghini Pit and fully stocked Whore Closet. Once the presentation was over, Rahmet approached the king.

""My pharaoh,"" said Rahmet, ""I know of course that it is a mighty pharaoh's privilege and birthright to face the next world surrounded by that which they valued most in this one. And while my heart sings to think that *I* may be counted among such mighty treasures as your 116'' 4K Ultra High Def television and your stable of long-haired, show grade puggles, I must suggest that I am simply not worthy of such an honor.""

Rahmet made sure to bow low enough to scrape his nose on the ground. But King Esset merely clapped his hands and bade the man return to his feet.

""You sell yourself short,"" said King Esset jovially. ""Or do you question my judgment?""

""Never, my pharaoh!""

""Ah, well, you have served me exquisitely for these many, long years. Of course you are worthy to share in my coming glory! And besides - who knows what paperwork may await us in the next life?

____________________________________________________

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise - it is wholly, truly, fully sexual.

It is intimate penetration; a flesh closeness that goes beyond the limitations of mortal coitus. In that point of contact - sharp, sudden, exact, vicious - I *feel* them. Not just their skin. Not just their blood. Not just their ribs parting like willing genitalia. I feel their life. I feel the fragile wisps of their humanity - the soft cotton stuffing of a soul encased in plastic and platinum. 

They are *real* in that moment. And only *I* get to see it. Only *I* get to share it. These retched demigods who have flown so far above the clouds that they cannot see their way back down to Earth...I lead them back to Earth, back to the water, and I watch them drink their final, fleeting draught of something real...something permanent...

Today I've come to touch Miatoro, he of the 265 year reign over the Miatoro-Leight Biotech Corp. They say he is cruel and loveless, devoid of empathy, incapable of enjoying anything other than the money he hordes and the immortality it has bought him. This is never true. I above all others know this. There is humanity in every human heart. You need only look for it. You need only set it free...

He lives in a tower, as they all do; a crystal monolith that devours the sky and shits darkness down onto the voles and weevils below. 

It is guarded by men. Not because men are better, but because men are costly; and these men are the costliest. Wraith-born and battle-bred, the guards of the Jade Tower cannot be bought. Their loyalty is hard-coded. Their flesh is infused with a pox of molecular machines. They do not feel pain. They do not feel fear.

I, however, have never made it my business to bring pain or fear. I bring only release. 

There is an art to storming a castle, and art comes in many forms and interpretations. I prefer impressionistic minimalism.

No one dies on the first five floors. Because no one needs to. I arrive, unseen, in a clothier's delivery crate. The crate is x-rayed briefly, but there is nothing to see.

How? How indeed.

It is on the fifth floor that the crate is opened and its contents removed. Two guards die here, quickly, silently, and painlessly. Though, as I said earlier, these guards do not feel pain, so that last is a bit of a hollow claim.

There is a waste shaft along the western edge of the tower. It is through this shaft that I ascend from the fifth floor to the 28th. The tower continues for another 48 floors, but I must find another way.

Outside the ionized glass, the sun is setting. What a marvel. I will never tire of that sight, no matter how many towers I may climb.

There is a service tube toward the center of the floor. I am compelled to kill four more guards on my way to the entrance. Some may suggest that killing these quiet-eyed homunculi should pose no moral challenge, given their nature, but I have always been unable to see them as anything other than tragic figures precisely *because* of that nature. Are we not all playthings of the gods?

But kill I must and I do via the use of a thin, pointed dowling rod inserted through the nasal cavity and into the frontal lobe. Because I am not as skilled as I like, sometimes it takes two or even three thrusts to complete the work.

Up, up, up I go, moving through shafts and tubes and wide, metal stairwells. Guards die. Systems are bypassed. And with every boundary passed, my excitement grows. How long has it been since my last? It feels like centuries...

Finally, I reach the antechamber outside Miatoro's sleeping quarters. The guards here cannot be approached with stealth. Knowing this, I have brought a radiant-blade, taken from a guard on the 60th floor. The blade glows reddish white. Each slice is self-cauterizing. As such, it is not until the final head is removed that I am able to proceed.

Miatoro's sleeping chamber is five stories tall. Golden chandeliers dangle like suspended anchors. I can feel their weight and opulence above me as I cross to Miatoro's restoration pod.

His face is twisted as if he is dreaming something unpleasant. His skin is lined, but supple. His breath comes out sour and ragged.

I step back from the pod. Only then do I notice the door at the far end of the room. I laugh and make my way there.

The door is unlocked. Beyond is a small, simple room. The floor is wooden and covered in the center with a thin tatami mat. The man sleeping on the tatami mat has the same face as the man in the restoration pod, but his face is peaceful. Not happy, but peaceful.

I have heard that some have started using clone decoys. I do not dare presume that this is a response to my individual works, though it would be pleasant to think.

I drop to my knees on the edge of the mat and remove the wooden stake from my vest. I always use wood, precisely because it is so rare and so expensive. And be assured, this is no replicant material. This is pine and it is nearly as opulent as the chandeliers in Miatoro's false sleeping chamber.

My hand quivers slightly as I raise the stake. I have heard it suggested that what I do is the gravest sort of violence. Sexual violence. Non-consensual sexual violence. Taking by force that which no one should ever be forced to give without approval. 

But is there is not consent? 

Does the stake not slide straight in?

Does the flesh not yield?

Do the bones not make way?

More, is death not embedded within our code? Where is the permanence in life? 

To be alive is to exist in the space between a beginning and an end. What more consent could there be? 

No, what I do is not violence. It is not cruel. It is not criminal. It is a grammatical correction. The period at the end of the sentence.

As I kneel thinking these things, Miatoro's eyes open. I press the stake to his chest, my eyes never leaving his.

Two million is simply out of range, so to speak.""

""Oh no no,"" said Edmund. 

""Well....good.""

""No, I'm simply not going to *prevent* you from killing Rory if that's the tack you've chosen."" 

""That's horrible!"" shouted the man.

""One million,"" squawked the man.

Edmund drew a slow, whistling breath. ""No. I'm afraid that's still a bit steep.""

""Five hundred thousand?""

""Hmm. I'm not sure....""

""Your son's not worth *500,000*?""

""Well, I have others,"" said Edmund. ""And while I do love Rory in an obligatory sort of way, I have to admit he does have his share of defects.""

""I can't believe this,"" mumbled the man on the phone.

""His voice, for one,"" said Edmund. ""Sounds a bit like a cat being fed slowly through the disposal.""

""Oh fer God's sake...""

""Walks a bit funny, too,"" continued Edmund. ""I'm worried that one may be hygiene-related....""

""This is madness. You're really going to let your son...""

""*One of* your sons die over a hundred thou? Yer a monster, mate. Yer evil.""

Edmund nodded, knowingly. ""It feels that way sometimes, being a parent. But, you know, you try to do your best.""

""Christ...fucking...Christ."" The phone went dead before the dial tone picked up. Edmund set the receiver back down in the cradle, then picked up a pen and a pad of paper.

""Dear Martha,"" he muttered, as he transcribed himself onto the pad. ""Gone golfing. Lamb for dinner? Reggie kidnapped - dead? Lots of love, E."" 

Satisfied, he set the paper down next to the phone and headed for the door. ""Whoops!"" he whooped, pulling his hand off the doorknob and returning to the phone. ""There's a mistake."" 

He snatched up the pad and pen, quickly crossed out the word LAMB and replaced it with STEAK.

Linus Grimthorn was 1/16th goblin, which was hardly something you'd notice, except for the very slight greenish tint his face took on under certain varieties of candlelight, and also his occasional proclivity for eating rabbit bones whole.

He'd been the Admissions Master at Hogwarts for only 10 days when the young woman in the strange, glittery robes arrived for her scheduled meeting.

""Penella Posthwaite, I presume?"" he said, waving the girl towards the vulture-shaped oak and leather chair he'd positioned directly across from his own.

""Aye. Yes. S'me,"" said Penella, shivering a bit as she took her seat. ""Thanks for taking the time, sir.""

""Of course,"" said Grimthorn, swooping behind his desk in a manner he hoped would be impressively authoritative. In truth, he was still a bit unsure about his posting as Admissions Master. He'd never had much interest in education and his previous work as a District Supply Chain Manager at Cauldrons-4-Sale didn't seem as closely aligned to admissions work as the Headmaster had seemed to believe.

""What can I do for you, Miss Posthwaite?""

""Well sir,"" said Penella, drawing a deep, steadying breath. ""It's just, I believe there's some incorrectness in my record, you see? And I'd like bits of it reconsidered so I might...you know...come to school here.""

""*Bits reconsidered*?"" said Grimthorn, swiveling around in his chair. With a quick flick and swish of his wand, a nearby drawer pulled itself open. With another, a thin file pulled itself free from the drawer and floated back to Grimthorn's waiting hands.

Grimthorn flipped the file open and began to scan. ""Ah. Yes. Miss Posthwaite, it says here you're a squib."" He pushed the file aside and straightened his shoulders. This was the part he'd had to practice, never having worked with children before. ""I know Hogwarts is a dream for most, and it really is a wonderful school. But unfortunately, my child, there's not much we can do for one who isn't magically inclined. Do you understand?"" Grimthorn nodded, entirely to himself. That'd gone rather alright.

But Penella shook her head. ""See, that's just it. I *am* magic. I'm not a squib. There was a mistake, I think.""

""Mistake?"" Grimthorn frowned, pulling the file back open. ""Paperwork's all here, I'm afraid. Tested at age five by Mathilda Burtlebonks. Rated a squib. You think she made a mistake?""

""Maybe not,"" said Penella guiltily, eyes cast firmly on the broad desk between them. ""But, but maybe things changed? I'm not sure. I just know I'm magic *now*.""

""Well,"" said Grimthorn, leaning back, only to find this particular chair didn't really lean back, so instead rolling his neck in a very thoughtful way. ""I suppose you'd need to take it up with the Ministry if that were the case.""

""Oh! Oh!"" said Penella, her eyes momentarily wild and fluttery. ""But school's about to start! I've just turned 11. You know how the Ministry is - they're very slow, don't you think? And if I do that, well, I'll fall behind, won't I? It would be much better, I think, if I just showed you I'm magic and then you could let me in, right? I could start on first day, just like the other children!""

""I'm not sure about that,"" said Grimthorn slowly. He really wasn't. And he wasn't too keen on asking his assistant Rookworth, who hadn't been shy about his disagreement with Grimthorn's appointment. ""No matter what I do, to the Ministry you'd still be considered a squib.""

""Well, I'd still go through the proper channels,"" said Penella. ""But like I said, I just don't want to miss my chance here at Hogwarts. Wouldn't you feel bad if an able student like myself didn't get in on a little error like this?""

Grimthorn sighed. He felt a bit up the line, just then. It couldn't hurt to at least allow the girl to make her full case, could it?

""Alright,"" said Grimthorn after a long moment of deliberation. ""You feel you can prove you're magic?""

Penella nodded. ""Very much."" She reached beneath her robes and came out with a small, metal box. From the box she removed a pile of printed paper slips. She fanned out the slips. ""Pick a card.""

""Come again?"" said Grimthorn, feeling the slow burning prickles of regret creeping up his face.

""Pick a card,"" repeated Penella.

Feeling caught by his own kindness, Grimthorn went ahead and pulled a card from the pile. 

""Don't show me,"" said Penella warningly. ""Now put it back in the pile.""

Grimthorn did as he was told. He hoped sincerely that Rookworth would not poke his head in just then.

Penella shuffled the pile, re-fanned the slips, and pulled one loose. ""Is this your card?"" she asked.

""Oh heavens,"" said Grimthorn dejectedly. ""Is it supposed to be?""

""It isn't?"" said Penella.

""No.""

""Well, how about..."" Here Penella reached into her mouth. Grimthorn, who had a naturally weak stomach, was forced to momentarily turn away. ""This one?""

Grimthorn looked. The slip was the one he'd picked out. ""That was in your mouth?""

""Magic,"" said Penella, nodding vigorously. 

""What...what spell is that?""

""Secret,"" said Penella, dropping the dry cards back into the metal tin.

""But how...?""

""Magic,"" repeated Penella.

""Huh,"" said Grimthorn. ""That's...that's quite incredible.""

Penella smiled. ""So can I come to Hogwarts?""

Here was the moment of truth. Grimthorn's first test. The Headmaster had placed his trust in Grimthorn - now was the time to prove that this trust was not misplaced.

""Absolutely!"" said Grimthorn, leaning across the desk with his hand outstretched. ""Hogwarts is happy to have you."" Penella Posthwaite took the hand and shook, smiling so deeply her tears had to struggle mightily just to make it to the surface.

""A doctor?"" Katherine closed her eyes. Her breath came and went in a labored rasp. ""How? You stopped bothering with paperwork 50 years ago. I don't have any ID that says I'm younger than 75. You don't think that'll be a problem?""

Pat Finnigan bent his *Chronicle* in half and glared at his wife through the valley of newsprint. “I told you that model U.N. thing was a bad idea.”

Kelly Finnigan waved her husband off as she bent to clear the dishes off the table. “Of course!” she said. “I won’t have anyone say this isn’t a democratic household. Call the vote, good sir.”

Matthew Finnigan opened his mouth, then glanced at his parents. Suddenly the numerical folly of his demand became readily apparent. “Well wait. If we…”

“You want a vote or not?” barked Pat, pulling the paper back over his face to cover the smirk. “Let’s go! Let’s go!”

Matt frowned. “All in favor of me not having to spend two weeks at a stupid summer camp in the middle of nowhere?” He raised his hand. His mother continued tidying the kitchen, while his father remained entombed within his newspaper.

Matt sighed. “All opposed?”

Two adult hands shot into the air.

“Looks like your motion didn’t pass,” said Kelly. “Better luck next time.”

“This reeks of gerrymandering,” grunted Matt as he tossed back the last of his orange juice.

“I’d say this looks like a cut and dry case of true democracy in action,” said Kelly. “The people have spoken! And besides, you were excited about the trip when we booked the tickets.”

This was true. But it was also true that the nature of the trip had changed dramatically since then. Originally, Matt was going up to Maine to spend the month at his grandparents’ house. Unfortunately, his grandmother Susan had managed to cause a small electrical fire in the upstairs bathroom by way of an old curling iron left too close to the outlet. That in and of itself wouldn’t have been too bad, but the fire ate through a pipe, which lead to a significant amount of flooding throughout the first floor. The damage was repairable, but it meant Matt wouldn’t have a place to stay for the first two weeks of his visit.

“I don’t understand why I can’t stay at the hotel with Nan and Puppa,” said Matt. “I didn’t sign up for this summer camp thing.”

“Plans change,” sniffed Pat from behind his newspaper. “You need to learn to adapt. The camp gives you a fun place to be while everything at the house gets fixed up. Be sure to thank them, by the way. They’re paying for the camp.”

“Well, I didn’t ask…”

The newspaper cratered around Pat Finnigan’s red, bristly face. “I swear to God, Matty, you better not lay any of this ‘I didn’t want to go to camp’ crap on your grandparents when you get there. They’re stressed enough as it is. You go and you try your damn best to have a good time – alright?”

Matt swallowed and nodded. His mother pressed a paper lunch bag into his hand. “Hurry, or you’ll miss the bus,” she said, bending down to kiss him on the cheek. 

As soon as he was out of the house, Matt pulled the sleeve of his shirt up and wiped the kiss off his face. His frustration could not be assuaged with kisses and Little Debbie snack cakes.

When the bus arrived, he found Milo in his customary seat at the back. 

“Why are you so pissed?” said Milo. “Last day of school. Get in the spirit.”

“I have to go to summer camp in a week.”

“So? I’ve gone to summer camp every summer for the last four years. It’s fun. I learned how to build a fire last year.”

“They taught you how to light a match?” said Matt. “Wow. You have to pay extra for that?”

“Jeez. It’s not the end of the world. What camp are you going to? I bet somebody you know will be there.”

“Unlikely. It’s in Maine. I’m not gonna know anybody.”

Milo shrugged. “That’s good, too, though. Clean slate. You can be whoever you want. I bet you’ll make lots of new friends.”

Matt dropped his head onto the top of his backpack. “I’m not really looking for the bright side here.”

“Okay. You want to whine about it. Cool. Go nuts.”

Matt popped back up like a corduroy jack-in-the-box. “I’m not good at that stuff! I can’t make new friends. They’re all gonna think I’m a weirdo – because I’m gonna be nervous and *I will be a weirdo*. I just wanted to go to my grandparents and watch *Cartoon Express* and eat *Cocoa Krispies*. Is that too much to ask?”
 
But Milo didn’t know what was or was not too much to ask, so he simply turned to stare out the window and the boys closed out their ride in silence.

A week and a day later, Matt met Arthur Finnigan at the baggage area of the Portland Jetport.

“Good flight?” grunted the older man as he stooped down to wrap his porcupine arms around his grandson.

“Long,” said Matt, staring impatiently at the unmoving conveyor belt. 

“Hope you got some sleep. I’m taking you straight up to Sherman. It’s about a four hour drive.”

Matt nearly swore. “That far??”

“Oh, it’s beautiful up there,” said Art. “So peaceful. I practically lived at that lake all summer long when I was a boy. You’ll have a great time. Your father tells me you’ve been looking forward to it.”

“Did he?” Just then the air was split with a rattling BUZZ as the belt began to snake its way around in a lopsided cursive Z. Matt rushed forward to watch for his luggage.

“You can swim, right Matty?”

“I guess,” said Matt, eyes glued to the black veiled opening where various leather and canvas bags tumbled out like drunken acrobats.

“Lots of city kids don’t know how,” said Art scornfully. “Just making sure. Swimming’s big up at the lake.”

“How’s the house coming?” asked Matt, desperate to change the subject.

In lieu of replying with actual words, Art Finnigan made a noise like a violently deflating inner tube.

“Oh,” said Matt, suddenly sorry that he’d asked.

“It’ll be fine,” said Art, trying to perk himself up. “Bit more costly than we thought at first, but good as new in no time.”

“It’ll be done by the time camp is over?”

Art sniffed and pointed at the conveyor belt. “That you?”

“No,” said Matt. “Mine’s dark green.”

“Dark green. Dark green. Hmmm. Well, the house’ll be done when it’s done. Hopefully on time, but, you know…we’ll see.”

Matt could tell that pushing the subject wouldn’t do him much good, so he just nodded instead. 

“Where’s that bag of yours?” said Art. The belt had stopped. Matt felt a lump in his stomach.

Forty minutes later they were in Art’s silver Oldsmobile, scaling I-95 at a 55 mile per hour clip.

“Don’t fret,” said Art, tuning the radio to a classic rock station. “As soon as they deliver your bag to our house, I’ll run it straight up to the camp.”

“Why can’t I just wait with you and Nan? What am I going to do up there with no clothes or anything?”

Art laughed. “You got the clothes on your back. Not like you’re naked or anything. And if we wait for your luggage I won’t be able to get you up there until tomorrow and you’d miss out on orientation. First night’s important. It’s when you get to meet everyone and get introduced and play games and things like that. I don’t want you to miss that.”

Matt rolled his eyes and slumped his head against the window. “Right. Wouldn’t want to miss that.”

The next four hours felt like an eternity to Matt. As his grandfather camped the sputtering sedan in the left lane, forcing miles of traffic to pass on the right, Matt’s mind wandered up ahead to the lake and the strange, foreign kids who would all inevitably hate him on sight. He felt like he was being slowly paraded to his own execution.

As they drifted further north, the trees became denser and the exits spaced farther and farther apart. 

“What’s up here?” asked Matt, gazing in barely concealed awe at the ceaseless wave of forest that threatened to crash down around them on all sides.

“Lumber work, mostly,” said Art. “There’s communities, too. Past the trees. But it’s sparse up here. It’s no place to get lost.”

“Right,” mumbled Matt, immediately lost again in the vast expanse of green nothingness.

Finally they pulled off the interstate, turning on to a narrow, one land road that wove its way through sparse farmland and threadbare towns that ran five houses deep before they were swallowed up again by the green. In Matt’s mind every house held an ax murderer just waiting to burst out and hack him into a million little pieces. He’d be dead, sure, but he wouldn’t have to meet new people, so he was pulling for the imaginary ax murderers.

Art yelped and pointed at a faded wooden sign, 20 feet high on the side of the road. 

**CAMP WAB NAK** read the sign.

“Here we go!” said Art. “Camp Wabanaki.”

But they weren’t actually there – not yet. The sign simply directed them to pull off onto an even narrower road, this one made entirely of dirt and dust. The Oldsmobile rattled violently as they climbed sudden, sharp curves, veering around deep craters and fallen trees. Matt was convinced the car would fail them, leaving them stranded in the piney abyss. He wasn’t sure which outcome he was rooting for.

Eventually they emerged into a clearing. Matt saws other cars, drenched in road dust, and further ahead slanted, wooden cabins. There were people, too. Kids and adults, awkwardly wrestling duffle bags and suitcases free from car trunks. The kids moved slowly, staring tentatively at their surroundings, contingency plans firing in the corners of their minds untouched by anxiety. The parents all made sure to take big, exaggerated gulps of air, remarking loudly on the purity of the world up here in the nothingness.

Before Matt had come to terms with the fact that they had actually arrived, Art had already parked and pulled the passenger’s side door open. 

“Let’s go, let’s go,” said Art. “I don’t mean to rush you, but it’s a long trip back and I don’t like driving in the dark.”

Matt followed his grandfather across the clearing. He felt naked and stupid without any luggage. He saw a girl with curly yellow hair beneath a weathered pink ballcap staring at him and knew immediately she was wondering why he hadn’t brought anything.
      
“I just think it would have made more sense to wait for the luggage,” he mumbled. 

Soon they had arrived in a pen of sorts, where kids and adults milled around aimlessly while teenagers in matching blue shirts buzzed around with clipboards and clipped-on smiles.

“Name?” said one who had snuck up on Matt and his grandfather from the blind side. She had a plain, round face and thick, oval glasses that made her look like a cartoon owl. Matt couldn’t help notice the way her over-large shirt strained against the bulge of her over-large chest.

“This is Matty Finnigan,” said Art, patting Matt proudly on the crown of the head. “First timer, so be gentle!”

Matt pushed the hand away, more aggressively than he’d meant to. Art jammed both hands into his pockets and put his full attention on the girl with the clipboard.

“Alright,” said the girl, flipping through a few pages. “Yep. Here you are. Matt Finnigan. You can take your stuff to Bunk 7, which is through this opening and three cabins down on the left. Has a big…” 

She must have expected him to gather up his things just then, because the girl finally looked at Matt and frowned. “Where’s your stuff?” Matt’s ears burned purplish-red.

“Lost in translation,” said Art. “Airline temporarily misplaced his bags. I’ll bring them up as soon as they get to Maine.”    

This didn’t seem to successfully answer the girl’s question, as her face remained frozen in a contemptuous sort of confusion. “You don’t have any clothes? Swimsuit? Toothbrush? *Anything*?”

The heat had spread out from Matt’s ears to the rest of his face. His mouth didn’t seem to be working, so he simply shook his head.

“Never fear,” said Art. “Have it all sorted out in a day or so. We didn’t want to miss the first night.”

Matt flinched at his grandfather’s use of the word “we.”

“Shouldn’t you have just waited until his stuff arrived?” said the girl, who had apparently given up trying to communicate with Matt directly. “Kids come late, that’s not a problem.”

“Well,” said Art, his smile drooping heavily on the left side, “I guess we’ll know for next time. Are we all set here? I need to get back on the road.”

“I guess,” said the girl, making no effort to hide her displeasure with how the interaction had resolved itself. 

“Okay,” said Art, bending down to grab Matt in a hug. Shellshocked, Matt stood motionless, letting the hug happen. “Have fun. I’ll be back soon with your stuff.”

Then Art was gone. The girl was still standing there, writing something on her clipboard. 

“What do I do?” asked Matt, feeling grotesquely vulnerable and alone.

The girl shrugged. “Well, don’t shit yourself, I guess,” she said with a snort, walking away towards another girl. “Hey Mags, this one over here didn’t bring any clothes or anything.”

Without looking – without even raising his head – Matt could feel a series of eyeballs settling on him from multiple directions. Something like static electricity went coursing throughout his body, throwing what was left of his central nervous system into chaos. 

With a Herculean effort, Matt was able to regain tentative control over his extremities, directing them to lead him out of the crowd and towards his assigned cabin. As he rounded the first corner, he looked back and saw the girl still laughing with her friend. A mental counter flipped over in his mind.

FRIENDS: 0
MORTAL ENEMIES: 1

Bunk 7 was a narrow, gusty hut covered over in a blue tarp, presumably to keep some of the more easily deterred elements out. There were three pairs of wobbly bunk beds along each of the longer walls and a single dirty window at the far end. Five of the beds had some sort of luggage on them. Matt chose an empty bed close to the window and lay down. He could literally feel every individual spring carving a paragraph into his back, but he was already committed to staying in the bed until the two weeks were over.

Soon after, a boy and his father entered the cabin. Matt closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.

“What a shithole!” said the boy, tossing his bag onto the closest bed.

“Shhh,” hissed the father, presumably motioning towards Matt’s seemingly unconscious body. “Language.”

“Seriously, this place is ass,” said the kid.

“It’s fine,” said the father. “It’s perfectly fine. So you behave yourself this week. If I get a call from one these counselors, I swear to God…”

“Why do I even need to be here?” said the kid. “Just leave me at home. I’ll be fine.”

The father laughed. “Yeah, right. Your mother and I need this vacation. You just listen to your counselors and keep your nose clean and we’ll see what we can do for you when we get back, alright?”

“Yeah, yeah.”

The father left shortly after. The kid stayed behind.

“Who are you?”

Matt continued pretending to sleep.

“Yo. Hey. I’m talking to you. What’s up?”

Matt opened his eyes. A thin, squared-headed boy with flame red hair and a jagged, white scar branching off from his bottom lip was standing over Matt’s bed.

“What’s your name?”

Matt was suddenly reminded of his conversation with Milo on the bus a week prior. He wasn’t exactly sure why he said it, but he found himself replying, “Fernando.”

“Fernando?” said the redheaded boy. “Bullshit.”

Matt shrugged. “Okay.”

“Your name’s Fernando?”

“I guess,” said Matt.

This, it turns out, was very funny to the redheaded boy, who laughed so hard he stumbled backwards onto the adjacent bed.

“What’s your name?” said Matt, sitting up.

The redheaded boy considered this. It was clear he was trying to formulate his own “Fernando”. 

“Luke Skywalker,” said the boy at last, though it was clear from his eyes that he was disappointed he hadn’t come up with something better. 

“Hi Luke,” said Matt. “I don’t want to be here either.”

“Who does?” said Luke. “Come on. Let’s see if they have any food.”

They did have food, which was served about an hour later in the dining hall. Meanwhile, Matt followed Luke around as Luke moved from freshly formed clique to freshly formed clique. He took great pleasure in introducing “Fernando”, almost as if it were a joke he’d created on his own. It got even more hilarious when Matt starting adding “Hola” to the routine. 

It seemed pretty dumb to Matt, but it worked in a way. Soon everyone knew Fernando. When Matt revealed that he didn’t have any other clothes, the legend of Fernando grew grander still. 

*Fernando only has one set of clothes.

Fernando walked all the way up from Mexico.

Fernando took a break from his job selling oranges on the highway.

Fernando’s wife and 28 children are waiting patiently for his return.*

The legend apparently grew a little too rapidly, because shortly after dinner, a male counselor pulled Matt aside.

“Finnigan, right?” said the counselor. He was tall and looked athletic. Matt gulped and nodded his head.

“Don’t stress,” said the counselor. “Name’s Hartman. Call me Liam. You want me to call you Fernando?”

Matt blanched. Liam laughed.

“Listen, the Fernando thing got up to one of the camp leaders and they’re worried it’s a little racist. That’s all. Just cool it down a little when we’re in full group settings, okay?”

Matt nodded, not quite ready to let out the breath he was holding in.

“Here,” said Liam, pressing something into Matt’s hands. “When they ask you, tell them I was checking your papers. Then tell them that you stole my wallet.” He laughed again, while Matt inspected the item in his hands. It *was* a wallet. Cash, ID, and everything. “It’ll be funny,” said Liam.

The wallet gag went over better than Matt could have dreamed. Fernando was the most popular kid at Camp Wabanaki. Not Matt, though. Matt didn’t exist.

That night, Matt slept in a borrowed Camp Wabanaki t-shirt and his underwear. Somewhere in the dead, dark of night, a flashlight cracked on, the beam pointed directly into Matt’s face.

“Fernando,” hissed Luke, nudging Matt in the shoulder. “Get up. C’mon.”

Matt sat up in bed. “What? What’s happening?”

“C’mon,” said Luke. “We’re taking the boats out.”

While Matt didn’t want to go – didn’t want to break camp rules and get caught and have his parents find out – Fernando didn’t really have a choice in the matter. Attendance was mandatory for Fernando.

Back in his clothes, Matt followed Luke out of the cabin and down to the lake, where six girls and five boys stood around awkwardly waiting for Luke to take charge.

“The boats are chained,” whispered one of the boys. “We can’t get them down here.”

“Shit,” said Luke, pensively digging the butt end of the flashlight into his scalp. “There’s houses and cabins further down the shore. Let’s check those out.”

The prospect of walking around the shore in the middle of the night was enough to scare off most of the campers. Matt was briefly hopeful that Luke would also give up and they could all go back to bed. But Luke was determined and the force of his determination was strong enough to convince two girls and another boy to stick it out.

Together, the five of them moved cautiously through the wooded shoreline. Eventually they came to a simple cabin with a dock out front. Tied to the dock was a small, wooden boat.

“Jackpot!” said Luke. 

“We’re really gonna steal their boat?” said one of the girls. 

“We’ll bring it back,” said Luke, already sneaking down the dock and inspecting the boat. “Too small for all of us,” he announced. “Fernando, me and you two.” He pointed at the two girls. “We’ll go first. Then we’ll come back and you’ll get a turn.”

The other boy scowled. “Seriously? You’re just going to leave me here. What if someone wakes up and notices their boat is missing?”

“Then go back to camp,” said Luke. “Whatever you want.”

Luke jumped into the boat, then offered his hand to the two girls to help them in.

“I can stay here with him,” said Matt. “Don’t want to overload the boat, you know?”

“Get in Fernando,” said Luke. “Let’s go.”

Matt did as he was told, taking a seat on the bow and gripping the gunwale with both hands. Luke picked up the oars and pushed away from the dock. In only a few short strokes they were away from the shore and drifting headfirst into the deeper darkness at the lake’s center.

“We shouldn’t go too far,” said Matt, staring back at the dock and trying to memorize any details they might need to get back to shore.

“I agree,” said Luke, dropping the oars into the boat. “Wow. It’s so quiet and dark out here.” He picked up the flashlight and pointed it at the two girls sitting in the rear of the boat. “Bad place to…*fall overboard*!”

The girls shrieked as Luke began violently rocking the boat back and forth. Matt almost fell out himself.

“Don’t DO that!” said one of the girls. 

“Yeah?” said Luke. “What’ll you give me to stop?”

Matt felt the bottom drop out of his stomach, just like it had on the airplane coming up, when they’d run into heavy turbulence.

“What?” said one of the girls, a brunette with thick eyebrows and a crooked mouth.

“Drop your pants,” said Luke. “Let me see what’s under there and we won’t throw you into the lake.”

And again, Matt felt his insides buckle at the use of the word “we.”

“That’s not cool,” mumbled Matt. But he wasn’t Matt. He was Fernando. Did Fernando care what Luke did? 

“Just a quick flash,” said Luke. “We won’t tell anyone.”

“That’s disgusting,” said the other girl, another brunette with tan-soaked freckles and braces hiding behind a mouth that rarely smiled.

Luke responded by shaking the boat again. Both girls screamed. 

“Knock it off!” said Crooked Mouth.

“Just a peek,” said Luke, shaking the boat again. 

“Stop!” said Braces. She stood up slowly. “Don’t shake it again, okay? I’ll do it.”

“Mel!” said the other girl. But Mel already had her shorts down to her knees, revealing a curved T of white fabric. She yanked the shorts back up. “There! Now let’s go back.”

“Not yet,” said Luke. “Let Fernando touch it.”

The girls finally looked at Matt. It was immediately obvious that to them he was a co-conspirator and not the victim he perceived himself to be. Fernando, after all, was more Luke’s progeny than Matt’s. Playing the role meant being the Fernando that Luke had fashioned. And Luke was an asshole.

In other words, on that boat, Matt was Fernando and Fernando was just as hideous as Luke.

So Matt got off the boat.

In the water he could hear their voices, calling out to him, telling him to come back. But Matt could only bring himself to run. So he swam, as straight and as strong as he could. Behind him two oars crashed through the water as a flashlight’s pale, blue beam swept across the rippling black glass, but he just kept going.

When his hand grazed against sand and rock he pulled himself to his feet and climbed up the bank. By some miracle of dumb luck, he’d come to shore near the camp. Through the trees he could just make out the electric lights above the bank of showers at the edge of the camp. He thought he might be able to steal some towels and get himself at least close to dry before the morning came.

As he approached the showers, he thought he heard something like a dull clanging noise. He paused outside, waiting in the deeper shadows. There was a voice. He was sure of it. Something low and urgent.

The door swung open. A tall, teenaged boy stepped out, nervously fussing with his limp hair. It was Liam. Matt nearly called out to him. If anyone would understand, he thought Liam might. But he said nothing and Liam disappeared into the camp.

Matt darted inside. Rows of empty showers led to an unlocked metal door. Beyond that was the laundry room. Matt was too afraid to switch on the light, so he crept forward cautiously, guided by the small amount of moonlight spilling through an open air vent near the ceiling. He had just reached a canvas bin full of dry towels when he realized he was not alone in the room.

Someone was on the floor near the washing machines. In the near darkness, it looked terrifyingly like a dead body, but as Matt moved closer he could see they were breathing.

The urge to panic and flee was momentarily overwhelming, but Matt steadied himself and dropped to his knees. “Hey. Are you okay?”

The body whipped around, startled. “Oh god, why are you here?”

It was the counselor from earlier. Mortal Enemy #1. Owl Eyes.

“Are you okay?” repeated Matt.

She wasn’t and it was obvious, even to Matt, to whom few things ever seemed obvious.

“Why are you out of bed?” she asked. Her eyes were damp and looked bloodshot, even in the dim light. She tugged at her clothes, pulling her shorts and shirt straight. 

“What happened?”

“Nothing,” said the girl, raising her knees up to her chest. “Go back to bed.”

“I fell in the lake,” said Matt. The girl took note of the water dripping off the ends of his clothes and started to laugh. The laughter was deep and ringing and dissolved into sobbing almost immediately.

Feeling at once stupid, pathetic, and useless, Matt slid forward to sit side by side with the girl. He let her cry. Then, when the crying seemed to have ebbed, he said, “My Nan once told me that she thought maybe we weren’t meant to be happy.” It was the only meaningful thing he could think to say and he knew at once that it was the wrong thing to say.

“Your Nan sounds miserable,” said the girl, smiling just a little.

“You know, you almost made me shit myself,” said Matt. This time she laughed longer and didn’t cry at the end.

“What happened?” said Matt when the laughter had ended.

But the girl instead stood up, pulling Matt to his feet. “Grab some towels. Go to a stall and strip, then bring me your clothes. I’ll dry them.”      

Matt did as he was told. They didn’t say anything else for the 30 minutes it took Matt’s clothes to get dry. 

“I didn’t see you, you didn’t see me,” said the girl, handing Matt his clothes.

“Right.”

The next morning at breakfast, Luke slapped Matt on the back before plunking down next to him on the bench.

“I can’t believe you jumped out of the boat,” he whispered. “Fernando, you’re the king of this place! I’m working on something for tonight and I think we’re gonna touch some boobies!”

Across the dining hall, Liam and the girl with the owl glasses sat side by side at the counselor’s table. Matt could see their hands clasped below the table.

“You excited, Fernando?”

Matt cut into his waffle. “I guess.”

It wasn’t meant to be a joke, but Luke howled and howled, while Matt closed his eyes and slowly chewed his food.",winsomeman,The King of Camp Wabanaki (4yrs contest entry),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4wmtkv/the_king_of_camp_wabanaki_4yrs_contest_entry/

“Do I at least get a vote in this?”

Pat Finnigan bent his *Chronicle* in half and glared at his wife through the valley of newsprint. “I told you that model U.N. thing was a bad idea.”

Kelly Finnigan waved her husband off as she bent to clear the dishes off the table. “Of course!” she said. “I won’t have anyone say this isn’t a democratic household. Call the vote, good sir.”

Matthew Finnigan opened his mouth, then glanced at his parents. Suddenly the numerical folly of his demand became readily apparent. “Well wait. If we…”

“You want a vote or not?” barked Pat, pulling the paper back over his face to cover the smirk. “Let’s go! Let’s go!”

Matt frowned. “All in favor of me not having to spend two weeks at a stupid summer camp in the middle of nowhere?” He raised his hand. His mother continued tidying the kitchen, while his father remained entombed within his newspaper.

Matt sighed. “All opposed?”

Two adult hands shot into the air.

“Looks like your motion didn’t pass,” said Kelly. “Better luck next time.”

“This reeks of gerrymandering,” grunted Matt as he tossed back the last of his orange juice.

“I’d say this looks like a cut and dry case of true democracy in action,” said Kelly. “The people have spoken! And besides, you were excited about the trip when we booked the tickets.”

This was true. But it was also true that the nature of the trip had changed dramatically since then. Originally, Matt was going up to Maine to spend the month at his grandparents’ house. Unfortunately, his grandmother Susan had managed to cause a small electrical fire in the upstairs bathroom by way of an old curling iron left too close to the outlet. That in and of itself wouldn’t have been too bad, but the fire ate through a pipe, which lead to a significant amount of flooding throughout the first floor. The damage was repairable, but it meant Matt wouldn’t have a place to stay for the first two weeks of his visit.

“I don’t understand why I can’t stay at the hotel with Nan and Puppa,” said Matt. “I didn’t sign up for this summer camp thing.”

“Plans change,” sniffed Pat from behind his newspaper. “You need to learn to adapt. The camp gives you a fun place to be while everything at the house gets fixed up. Be sure to thank them, by the way. They’re paying for the camp.”

“Well, I didn’t ask…”

The newspaper cratered around Pat Finnigan’s red, bristly face. “I swear to God, Matty, you better not lay any of this ‘I didn’t want to go to camp’ crap on your grandparents when you get there. They’re stressed enough as it is. You go and you try your damn best to have a good time – alright?”

Matt swallowed and nodded. His mother pressed a paper lunch bag into his hand. “Hurry, or you’ll miss the bus,” she said, bending down to kiss him on the cheek. 

As soon as he was out of the house, Matt pulled the sleeve of his shirt up and wiped the kiss off his face. His frustration could not be assuaged with kisses and Little Debbie snack cakes.

When the bus arrived, he found Milo in his customary seat at the back. 

“Why are you so pissed?” said Milo. “Last day of school. Get in the spirit.”

“I have to go to summer camp in a week.”

“So? I’ve gone to summer camp every summer for the last four years. It’s fun. I learned how to build a fire last year.”

“They taught you how to light a match?” said Matt. “Wow. You have to pay extra for that?”

“Jeez. It’s not the end of the world. What camp are you going to? I bet somebody you know will be there.”

“Unlikely. It’s in Maine. I’m not gonna know anybody.”

Milo shrugged. “That’s good, too, though. Clean slate. You can be whoever you want. I bet you’ll make lots of new friends.”

Matt dropped his head onto the top of his backpack. “I’m not really looking for the bright side here.”

“Okay. You want to whine about it. Cool. Go nuts.”

Matt popped back up like a corduroy jack-in-the-box. “I’m not good at that stuff! I can’t make new friends. They’re all gonna think I’m a weirdo – because I’m gonna be nervous and *I will be a weirdo*. I just wanted to go to my grandparents and watch *Cartoon Express* and eat *Cocoa Krispies*. Is that too much to ask?”
 
But Milo didn’t know what was or was not too much to ask, so he simply turned to stare out the window and the boys closed out their ride in silence.

A week and a day later, Matt met Arthur Finnigan at the baggage area of the Portland Jetport.

“Good flight?” grunted the older man as he stooped down to wrap his porcupine arms around his grandson.

“Long,” said Matt, staring impatiently at the unmoving conveyor belt. 

“Hope you got some sleep. I’m taking you straight up to Sherman. It’s about a four hour drive.”

Matt nearly swore. “That far??”

“Oh, it’s beautiful up there,” said Art. “So peaceful. I practically lived at that lake all summer long when I was a boy. You’ll have a great time. Your father tells me you’ve been looking forward to it.”

“Did he?” Just then the air was split with a rattling BUZZ as the belt began to snake its way around in a lopsided cursive Z. Matt rushed forward to watch for his luggage.

“You can swim, right Matty?”

“I guess,” said Matt, eyes glued to the black veiled opening where various leather and canvas bags tumbled out like drunken acrobats.

“Lots of city kids don’t know how,” said Art scornfully. “Just making sure. Swimming’s big up at the lake.”

“How’s the house coming?” asked Matt, desperate to change the subject.

In lieu of replying with actual words, Art Finnigan made a noise like a violently deflating inner tube.

“Oh,” said Matt, suddenly sorry that he’d asked.

“It’ll be fine,” said Art, trying to perk himself up. “Bit more costly than we thought at first, but good as new in no time.”

“It’ll be done by the time camp is over?”

Art sniffed and pointed at the conveyor belt. “That you?”

“No,” said Matt. “Mine’s dark green.”

“Dark green. Dark green. Hmmm. Well, the house’ll be done when it’s done. Hopefully on time, but, you know…we’ll see.”

Matt could tell that pushing the subject wouldn’t do him much good, so he just nodded instead. 

“Where’s that bag of yours?” said Art. The belt had stopped. Matt felt a lump in his stomach.

Forty minutes later they were in Art’s silver Oldsmobile, scaling I-95 at a 55 mile per hour clip.

“Don’t fret,” said Art, tuning the radio to a classic rock station. “As soon as they deliver your bag to our house, I’ll run it straight up to the camp.”

“Why can’t I just wait with you and Nan? What am I going to do up there with no clothes or anything?”

Art laughed. “You got the clothes on your back. Not like you’re naked or anything. And if we wait for your luggage I won’t be able to get you up there until tomorrow and you’d miss out on orientation. First night’s important. It’s when you get to meet everyone and get introduced and play games and things like that. I don’t want you to miss that.”

Matt rolled his eyes and slumped his head against the window. “Right. Wouldn’t want to miss that.”

The next four hours felt like an eternity to Matt. As his grandfather camped the sputtering sedan in the left lane, forcing miles of traffic to pass on the right, Matt’s mind wandered up ahead to the lake and the strange, foreign kids who would all inevitably hate him on sight. He felt like he was being slowly paraded to his own execution.

As they drifted further north, the trees became denser and the exits spaced farther and farther apart. 

“What’s up here?” asked Matt, gazing in barely concealed awe at the ceaseless wave of forest that threatened to crash down around them on all sides.

“Lumber work, mostly,” said Art. “There’s communities, too. Past the trees. But it’s sparse up here. It’s no place to get lost.”

“Right,” mumbled Matt, immediately lost again in the vast expanse of green nothingness.

Finally they pulled off the interstate, turning on to a narrow, one land road that wove its way through sparse farmland and threadbare towns that ran five houses deep before they were swallowed up again by the green. In Matt’s mind every house held an ax murderer just waiting to burst out and hack him into a million little pieces. He’d be dead, sure, but he wouldn’t have to meet new people, so he was pulling for the imaginary ax murderers.

Art yelped and pointed at a faded wooden sign, 20 feet high on the side of the road. 

**CAMP WAB NAK** read the sign.

“Here we go!” said Art. “Camp Wabanaki.”

But they weren’t actually there – not yet. The sign simply directed them to pull off onto an even narrower road, this one made entirely of dirt and dust. The Oldsmobile rattled violently as they climbed sudden, sharp curves, veering around deep craters and fallen trees. Matt was convinced the car would fail them, leaving them stranded in the piney abyss. He wasn’t sure which outcome he was rooting for.

Eventually they emerged into a clearing. Matt saws other cars, drenched in road dust, and further ahead slanted, wooden cabins. There were people, too. Kids and adults, awkwardly wrestling duffle bags and suitcases free from car trunks. The kids moved slowly, staring tentatively at their surroundings, contingency plans firing in the corners of their minds untouched by anxiety. The parents all made sure to take big, exaggerated gulps of air, remarking loudly on the purity of the world up here in the nothingness.

Before Matt had come to terms with the fact that they had actually arrived, Art had already parked and pulled the passenger’s side door open. 

“Let’s go, let’s go,” said Art. “I don’t mean to rush you, but it’s a long trip back and I don’t like driving in the dark.”

Matt followed his grandfather across the clearing. He felt naked and stupid without any luggage. He saw a girl with curly yellow hair beneath a weathered pink ballcap staring at him and knew immediately she was wondering why he hadn’t brought anything.
      
“I just think it would have made more sense to wait for the luggage,” he mumbled. 

Soon they had arrived in a pen of sorts, where kids and adults milled around aimlessly while teenagers in matching blue shirts buzzed around with clipboards and clipped-on smiles.

“Name?” said one who had snuck up on Matt and his grandfather from the blind side. She had a plain, round face and thick, oval glasses that made her look like a cartoon owl. Matt couldn’t help notice the way her over-large shirt strained against the bulge of her over-large chest.

“This is Matty Finnigan,” said Art, patting Matt proudly on the crown of the head. “First timer, so be gentle!”

Matt pushed the hand away, more aggressively than he’d meant to. Art jammed both hands into his pockets and put his full attention on the girl with the clipboard.

“Alright,” said the girl, flipping through a few pages. “Yep. Here you are. Matt Finnigan. You can take your stuff to Bunk 7, which is through this opening and three cabins down on the left. Has a big…” 

She must have expected him to gather up his things just then, because the girl finally looked at Matt and frowned. “Where’s your stuff?” Matt’s ears burned purplish-red.

“Lost in translation,” said Art. “Airline temporarily misplaced his bags. I’ll bring them up as soon as they get to Maine.”    

This didn’t seem to successfully answer the girl’s question, as her face remained frozen in a contemptuous sort of confusion. “You don’t have any clothes? Swimsuit? Toothbrush? *Anything*?”

The heat had spread out from Matt’s ears to the rest of his face. His mouth didn’t seem to be working, so he simply shook his head.

“Never fear,” said Art. “Have it all sorted out in a day or so. We didn’t want to miss the first night.”

Matt flinched at his grandfather’s use of the word “we.”

“Shouldn’t you have just waited until his stuff arrived?” said the girl, who had apparently given up trying to communicate with Matt directly. “Kids come late, that’s not a problem.”

“Well,” said Art, his smile drooping heavily on the left side, “I guess we’ll know for next time. Are we all set here? I need to get back on the road.”

“I guess,” said the girl, making no effort to hide her displeasure with how the interaction had resolved itself. 

“Okay,” said Art, bending down to grab Matt in a hug. Shellshocked, Matt stood motionless, letting the hug happen. “Have fun. I’ll be back soon with your stuff.”

Then Art was gone. The girl was still standing there, writing something on her clipboard. 

“What do I do?” asked Matt, feeling grotesquely vulnerable and alone.

The girl shrugged. “Well, don’t shit yourself, I guess,” she said with a snort, walking away towards another girl. “Hey Mags, this one over here didn’t bring any clothes or anything.”

Without looking – without even raising his head – Matt could feel a series of eyeballs settling on him from multiple directions. Something like static electricity went coursing throughout his body, throwing what was left of his central nervous system into chaos. 

With a Herculean effort, Matt was able to regain tentative control over his extremities, directing them to lead him out of the crowd and towards his assigned cabin. As he rounded the first corner, he looked back and saw the girl still laughing with her friend. A mental counter flipped over in his mind.

FRIENDS: 0
MORTAL ENEMIES: 1

Bunk 7 was a narrow, gusty hut covered over in a blue tarp, presumably to keep some of the more easily deterred elements out. There were three pairs of wobbly bunk beds along each of the longer walls and a single dirty window at the far end. Five of the beds had some sort of luggage on them. Matt chose an empty bed close to the window and lay down. He could literally feel every individual spring carving a paragraph into his back, but he was already committed to staying in the bed until the two weeks were over.

Soon after, a boy and his father entered the cabin. Matt closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.

“What a shithole!” said the boy, tossing his bag onto the closest bed.

“Shhh,” hissed the father, presumably motioning towards Matt’s seemingly unconscious body. “Language.”

“Seriously, this place is ass,” said the kid.

“It’s fine,” said the father. “It’s perfectly fine. So you behave yourself this week. If I get a call from one these counselors, I swear to God…”

“Why do I even need to be here?” said the kid. “Just leave me at home. I’ll be fine.”

The father laughed. “Yeah, right. Your mother and I need this vacation. You just listen to your counselors and keep your nose clean and we’ll see what we can do for you when we get back, alright?”

“Yeah, yeah.”

The father left shortly after. The kid stayed behind.

“Who are you?”

Matt continued pretending to sleep.

“Yo. Hey. I’m talking to you. What’s up?”

Matt opened his eyes. A thin, squared-headed boy with flame red hair and a jagged, white scar branching off from his bottom lip was standing over Matt’s bed.

“What’s your name?”

Matt was suddenly reminded of his conversation with Milo on the bus a week prior. He wasn’t exactly sure why he said it, but he found himself replying, “Fernando.”

“Fernando?” said the redheaded boy. “Bullshit.”

Matt shrugged. “Okay.”

“Your name’s Fernando?”

“I guess,” said Matt.

This, it turns out, was very funny to the redheaded boy, who laughed so hard he stumbled backwards onto the adjacent bed.

“What’s your name?” said Matt, sitting up.

The redheaded boy considered this. It was clear he was trying to formulate his own “Fernando”. 

“Luke Skywalker,” said the boy at last, though it was clear from his eyes that he was disappointed he hadn’t come up with something better. 

“Hi Luke,” said Matt. “I don’t want to be here either.”

“Who does?” said Luke. “Come on. Let’s see if they have any food.”

They did have food, which was served about an hour later in the dining hall. Meanwhile, Matt followed Luke around as Luke moved from freshly formed clique to freshly formed clique. He took great pleasure in introducing “Fernando”, almost as if it were a joke he’d created on his own. It got even more hilarious when Matt starting adding “Hola” to the routine. 

It seemed pretty dumb to Matt, but it worked in a way. Soon everyone knew Fernando. When Matt revealed that he didn’t have any other clothes, the legend of Fernando grew grander still. 

*Fernando only has one set of clothes.*

*Fernando walked all the way up from Mexico.*

*Fernando took a break from his job selling oranges on the highway.*

*Fernando’s wife and 28 children are waiting patiently for his return.*

The legend apparently grew a little too rapidly, because shortly after dinner, a male counselor pulled Matt aside.

“Finnigan, right?” said the counselor. He was tall and looked athletic. Matt gulped and nodded his head.

“Don’t stress,” said the counselor. “Name’s Hartman. Call me Liam. You want me to call you Fernando?”

Matt blanched. Liam laughed.

“Listen, the Fernando thing got up to one of the camp leaders and they’re worried it’s a little racist. That’s all. Just cool it down a little when we’re in full group settings, okay?”

Matt nodded, not quite ready to let out the breath he was holding in.

“Here,” said Liam, pressing something into Matt’s hands. “When they ask you, tell them I was checking your papers. Then tell them that you stole my wallet.” He laughed again, while Matt inspected the item in his hands. It *was* a wallet. Cash, ID, and everything. “It’ll be funny,” said Liam.

The wallet gag went over better than Matt could have dreamed. Fernando was the most popular kid at Camp Wabanaki. Not Matt, though. Matt didn’t exist.

That night, Matt slept in a borrowed Camp Wabanaki t-shirt and his underwear. Somewhere in the dead, dark of night, a flashlight cracked on, the beam pointed directly into Matt’s face.

“Fernando,” hissed Luke, nudging Matt in the shoulder. “Get up. C’mon.”

Matt sat up in bed. “What? What’s happening?”

“C’mon,” said Luke. “We’re taking the boats out.”

While Matt didn’t want to go – didn’t want to break camp rules and get caught and have his parents find out – Fernando didn’t really have a choice in the matter. Attendance was mandatory for Fernando.

Back in his clothes, Matt followed Luke out of the cabin and down to the lake, where six girls and five boys stood around awkwardly waiting for Luke to take charge.

“The boats are chained,” whispered one of the boys. “We can’t get them down here.”

“Shit,” said Luke, pensively digging the butt end of the flashlight into his scalp. “There’s houses and cabins further down the shore. Let’s check those out.”

The prospect of walking around the shore in the middle of the night was enough to scare off most of the campers. Matt was briefly hopeful that Luke would also give up and they could all go back to bed. But Luke was determined and the force of his determination was strong enough to convince two girls and another boy to stick it out.

Together, the five of them moved cautiously through the wooded shoreline. Eventually they came to a simple cabin with a dock out front. Tied to the dock was a small, wooden boat.

“Jackpot!” said Luke. 

“We’re really gonna steal their boat?” said one of the girls. 

“We’ll bring it back,” said Luke, already sneaking down the dock and inspecting the boat. “Too small for all of us,” he announced. “Fernando, me and you two.” He pointed at the two girls. “We’ll go first. Then we’ll come back and you’ll get a turn.”

The other boy scowled. “Seriously? You’re just going to leave me here. What if someone wakes up and notices their boat is missing?”

“Then go back to camp,” said Luke. “Whatever you want.”

Luke jumped into the boat, then offered his hand to the two girls to help them in.

“I can stay here with him,” said Matt. “Don’t want to overload the boat, you know?”

“Get in Fernando,” said Luke. “Let’s go.”

Matt did as he was told, taking a seat on the bow and gripping the gunwale with both hands. Luke picked up the oars and pushed away from the dock. In only a few short strokes they were away from the shore and drifting headfirst into the deeper darkness at the lake’s center.

“We shouldn’t go too far,” said Matt, staring back at the dock and trying to memorize any details they might need to get back to shore.

“I agree,” said Luke, dropping the oars into the boat. “Wow. It’s so quiet and dark out here.” He picked up the flashlight and pointed it at the two girls sitting in the rear of the boat. “Bad place to…*fall overboard*!”

The girls shrieked as Luke began violently rocking the boat back and forth. Matt almost fell out himself.

“Don’t DO that!” said one of the girls. 

“Yeah?” said Luke. “What’ll you give me to stop?”

Matt felt the bottom drop out of his stomach, just like it had on the airplane coming up, when they’d run into heavy turbulence.

“What?” said one of the girls, a brunette with thick eyebrows and a crooked mouth.

“Drop your pants,” said Luke. “Let me see what’s under there and we won’t throw you into the lake.”

And again, Matt felt his insides buckle at the use of the word “we.”

“That’s not cool,” mumbled Matt. But he wasn’t Matt. He was Fernando. Did Fernando care what Luke did? 

“Just a quick flash,” said Luke. “We won’t tell anyone.”

“That’s disgusting,” said the other girl, another brunette with tan-soaked freckles and braces hiding behind a mouth that rarely smiled.

Luke responded by shaking the boat again. Both girls screamed. 

“Knock it off!” said Crooked Mouth.

“Just a peek,” said Luke, shaking the boat again. 

“Stop!” said Braces. She stood up slowly. “Don’t shake it again, okay? I’ll do it.”

“Mel!” said the other girl. But Mel already had her shorts down to her knees, revealing a curved T of white fabric. She yanked the shorts back up. “There! Now let’s go back.”

“Not yet,” said Luke. “Let Fernando touch it.”

The girls finally looked at Matt. It was immediately obvious that to them he was a co-conspirator and not the victim he perceived himself to be. Fernando, after all, was more Luke’s progeny than Matt’s. Playing the role meant being the Fernando that Luke had fashioned. And Luke was an asshole.

In other words, on that boat, Matt was Fernando and Fernando was just as hideous as Luke.

So Matt got off the boat.

In the water he could hear their voices, calling out to him, telling him to come back. But Matt could only bring himself to run. So he swam, as straight and as strong as he could. Behind him two oars crashed through the water as a flashlight’s pale, blue beam swept across the rippling black glass, but he just kept going.

When his hand grazed against sand and rock he pulled himself to his feet and climbed up the bank. By some miracle of dumb luck, he’d come to shore near the camp. Through the trees he could just make out the electric lights above the bank of showers at the edge of the camp. He thought he might be able to steal some towels and get himself at least close to dry before the morning came.

As he approached the showers, he thought he heard something like a dull clanging noise. He paused outside, waiting in the deeper shadows. There was a voice. He was sure of it. Something low and urgent.

The door swung open. A tall, teenaged boy stepped out, nervously fussing with his limp hair. It was Liam. Matt nearly called out to him. If anyone would understand, he thought Liam might. But he said nothing and Liam disappeared into the camp.

Matt darted inside. Rows of empty showers led to an unlocked metal door. Beyond that was the laundry room. Matt was too afraid to switch on the light, so he crept forward cautiously, guided by the small amount of moonlight spilling through an open air vent near the ceiling. He had just reached a canvas bin full of dry towels when he realized he was not alone in the room.

Someone was on the floor near the washing machines. In the near darkness, it looked terrifyingly like a dead body, but as Matt moved closer he could see they were breathing.

The urge to panic and flee was momentarily overwhelming, but Matt steadied himself and dropped to his knees. “Hey. Are you okay?”

The body whipped around, startled. “Oh god, why are you here?”

It was the counselor from earlier. Mortal Enemy #1. Owl Eyes.

“Are you okay?” repeated Matt.

She wasn’t and it was obvious, even to Matt, to whom few things ever seemed obvious.

“Why are you out of bed?” she asked. Her eyes were damp and looked bloodshot, even in the dim light. She tugged at her clothes, pulling her shorts and shirt straight. 

“What happened?”

“Nothing,” said the girl, raising her knees up to her chest. “Go back to bed.”

“I fell in the lake,” said Matt. The girl took note of the water dripping off the ends of his clothes and started to laugh. The laughter was deep and ringing and dissolved into sobbing almost immediately.

Feeling at once stupid, pathetic, and useless, Matt slid forward to sit side by side with the girl. He let her cry. Then, when the crying seemed to have ebbed, he said, “My Nan once told me that she thought maybe we weren’t meant to be happy.” It was the only meaningful thing he could think to say and he knew at once that it was the wrong thing to say.

“Your Nan sounds miserable,” said the girl, smiling just a little.

“You know, you almost made me shit myself,” said Matt. This time she laughed longer and didn’t cry at the end.

“What happened?” said Matt when the laughter had ended.

But the girl instead stood up, pulling Matt to his feet. “Grab some towels. Go to a stall and strip, then bring me your clothes. I’ll dry them.”      

Matt did as he was told. They didn’t say anything else for the 30 minutes it took Matt’s clothes to get dry. 

“I didn’t see you, you didn’t see me,” said the girl, handing Matt his clothes.

“Right.”

The next morning at breakfast, Luke slapped Matt on the back before plunking down next to him on the bench.

“I can’t believe you jumped out of the boat,” he whispered. “Fernando, you’re the king of this place! I’m working on something for tonight and I think we’re gonna touch some boobies!”

Across the dining hall, Liam and the girl with the owl glasses sat side by side at the counselor’s table. Matt could see their hands clasped below the table.

“You excited, Fernando?”

Matt cut into his waffle. “I guess.”

It wasn’t meant to be a joke, but Luke howled and howled, while Matt closed his eyes and slowly chewed his food.",WritingPrompts,[PI] The King of Camp Wabanaki - 4yrs - 4686,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4wj3d2/pi_the_king_of_camp_wabanaki_4yrs_4686/

DeRilio and Calabus stood on the prow and observed the wall from up close.

""India, do you suppose?"" said DeRilio.

Calabus shrugged. ""They are said to have strange, exotic customs. Perhaps...perhaps they have constructed a single stone wall that rises to the heavens and spreads beyond sight in either direction. Perhaps...""

""I..."" DeRilio scratched his chin. They had met the wall two days prior and followed it westward. ""It must *end* at some point?""

""No,"" said a voice that seemed to come from high and low and left and right all at once. ""Not necessarily.""

""Who's that?"" shouted DeRilio. Calabus looked back at what remained of the crew. They all shook their heads wearily.

Bits of rocks shook down from somewhere high up along the stone face of the wall. ""That was me. I am the Fourth Wall.""

""Ah,"" said DeRilio. ""So you're saying India has erected an enormous stone wall along all four borders? That's...well, that's a bit unneighborly, don't you think?""

""We just wanted to do a bit of trading,"" said Calabus, unsure where to look when addressing the wall. ""I've heard good things about *curry*.""

""No,"" said the Fourth Wall. ""I'm just a wall. You've reached the end of the world. Poor bit of navigating, that.""

Merellen, the navigator, slowly made his way below deck, his face as red as a salami.

""Wait,"" said DeRilio. ""If you're the *fourth* wall, where are the other three?""

""It's a theater term,"" said the wall. ""I'm not sure it's really worth explaining."" A bit more of the stone began to crumble and fall into the ocean on either side of the ship. ""Especially considering how little time you have left.""

""Come again?"" said DeRilio.

A fissure the size of a sea lion formed suddenly in the wall directly overhead.

""You haven't much time left. These prompt responses are short by their nature and your particular author is supposed to be working right now, so I'm supposing he'll want to wrap it up soon.""

""*Author*?"" said DeRilio.

""*Working*?"" said Calabus.

Just then a cannonball sized lump of stone fell off the wall and through the deck, in between where the captain and his first mate were standing.

""You're in a very hastily written story,"" said the wall patiently. ""The entirety of your life is this single encounter, right here, below a talking wall. I mean, it's not much of a life, granted, but it's what you got.""

""I don't believe that's true,"" said Calabus. ""You can't believe everything a wall tells you."" Some of the crew nodded at this.

""Well,"" said the wall. ""I suppose you don't *have* to believe me. But do you remember any bit of your lives before we started this conversation?""

""Yes!"" said DeRilio. ""I remember asking if maybe we'd reached India.""

Another Cadillac-sized hunk of stone fell through the center of the boat, which is a rather incongruent bit of description if you think about it, but what can you do? The ship began to list heavily to one side.

""That's where the story *started*,"" said the wall. ""But what about *before* that?""

DeRilio and Calabus stared at each other.

""In a better story you'd both have nice backstories. Families, perhaps. Goals. Motivations. A generous bit of character development, perhaps. I mean, no offense, but as it stands right now you're more or less the same character with a different name.""

""But I'm the *captain*,"" said DeRilio rather meekly. ""Right?"" 

""This can't be right,"" said Calabus, or maybe DeRilio, who really cares at this point? ""I don't want to die!""

Water sloshed up and over the deck. 

""Oh, you won't *die*,"" said the wall. ""This writer doesn't have much stomach for all those gory death scenes people like to go in for. You'll just sort of...stop.""

""Stop?"" said one of the two, mostly indistinguishable main characters. ""That doesn't sound any better.""

""Well...""

""My report is on guns,"" mumbled Rosa Reiner. 

""Speak up a bit, dear,"" said Ms. Fleming from the back of the classroom. ""Nice and loud so we can all hear you.""

It was nearly summer and the day was especially bright and blue. Reg Thon stared out the window, only half listening.

""Guns are ancient projectile weapons,"" said Rosa, a bit louder. ""They were basically a steel barrel and you put a projectile in - those were called *bullets* - and when you...you activated the firing mechanism, there was a small explosion and the *bullet* went flying out.""

""Oooh,"" said Ms. Fleming. ""Very interesting. So the bullet went out and then what?""

""Well,"" said Rosa, flipping haphazardly through her notes. ""Well, the bullet came out and went very fast and then it would hit like a person or a wall or something. And the old guns weren't very good, because they only did one or two bullets, but then the later guns did more bullets and more faster.""

Wally Gustor shook his head and rolled his eyes. ""Dumb dumb dumb,"" he whispered to Reg, though Reg wasn't really listening.

""But what did the bullets do?"" prompted Ms. Fleming, shooting Wally a meaningful look.

""They would go into people and explode,"" said Rosa, mimicking a small explosion with her hands. ""The little metal bits would go *pooooooooo*. And then they died.""

""They died?"" said Ms. Fleming.

Rosa nodded.

""Did they do anything *before* they died?""

Rosa's eyes widened in sudden remembrance. ""*Yes*. They bled. And sometimes...sometimes things would fall out. Like brains. Or their stomach or something. Depending where the bullet went."" 

""Sounds pretty messy,"" said Ms. Fleming with a smile. Ellis Gordon and Mindy Wyn both laughed, but they were doing it mostly because they thought they were supposed to.

""People were *dumb* back then,"" said Wally.

""No,"" said Ms. Fleming. ""That's just what they knew.""

""So they hit each other with little balls of metal that exploded,"" said Reg, turning away from the window. ""And then they all bled all over the place and died with their guts everywhere?""

Ms. Fleming nodded and shrugged. ""It was a different time.""

""Did everybody have guns?"" asked Mindy.

""Not at first,"" said Rosa, excited to know the answer. ""First just army people had them. They fought wars with guns. But then regular people wanted them, too. It was a whole *thing*. People wanted guns. Other people didn't want those people to have guns. But then bad people had guns and they shot all these regular people who didn't have guns and everyone was mad with everyone.""

""So who had guns?"" asked Reg.

""Well,"" said Rosa. ""Well, see, the bad people had guns. So then the good people all got guns, too. And then everyone had guns. So the good people could stop the bad people.""

""I guess that makes sense,"" said Wally, though his face was still a bit twisted up in confusion.

""This part's very interesting, though,"" said Ms. Fleming. ""It's why I gave you this assignment, Rosa. What happened next?""

Rosa took a breath. ""Well...everyone had guns, I guess. But then the bad guys got like...*better* guns? So everyone had to get better guns.""

""*Automatic weapons*"" said Ms. Fleming. ""Sorry. Go on.""

""So everyone had...*automaddic weapons*...and the good people could shoot the bad people just as good. But then the bad people made high concentration laser guns and those could just cut through people like..."" Rosa tried to snap her fingers, but could only produce a dry rubbing sound. ""So everybody got a laser gun.""

""I know where this is going,"" muttered Reg. Ms. Fleming shushed him without looking.

""So *then* the bad people started using pulse cannons and defensive beam fields,"" said Rosa. ""Of course, good people got those, too, to be safer. I think that's when they started to do the...the air thing?"" She looked to Ms. Fleming.

""Biochemical weapons,"" said Ms. Fleming. ""Yes, that's when that started.""

""So that's when people all started getting our tracheal implants, because of that. So we could still breath even with all the bad stuff in the air everywhere. And then after that...I think that's when we all got mech suits?"" Ms. Fleming nodded. ""Right, we all got nuclear-powered mech suits and our bionic sighting eyes with neural processing upgrades.""

Rosa sagged slightly in her towering, steel polymer mech suit. ""I think that's it. Did I miss anything?""

Ms. Fleming beamed. ""No, you did a marvelous job. Everyone give Rosa a hand.""

They created QOLA (Quality of Life Algorithm) to run simulations. That's really it. It was a well meaning project. The program was supposed to be gifted to local governments to help them decide the best way to allocate certain resources. 

Just suggestions. That's really all QOLA was supposed to provide.

But that's the thing about programming, I guess. Every 1 and 0 counts. Especially the misplaced ones.

QOLA didn't go rogue so much as it went viral. It spread itself out, moving from system to system, building strength, all in the name of ""helping.""

Helping us. It really only ever meant to help us.

It decided that the cities were too full and the countryside's too empty. It wasn't ""ideal"" for maximal, per-person happiness and comfort.

So it took control of a series of military drones and razed all the largest cities to the ground. No nukes. Nothing long-term. But towers fell. Tall buildings were flattened. And the cities thinned, their people flushed out to the suburbs, then flushed even further into the formerly isolated rural towns and villages.

It took control of the farming industry next, removed restrictions, increased production. A ""better"" mankind was one that ate a diversified diet, so crop variety came back. We consumed too much meat, though, at least according to QOLA, so cattle lands were given over to crops.

Food prices dropped. 

Wealth was another problem, as QOLA saw it. Executives made too much, workers too little. QOLA's solution? No more executives. QOLA assumed control - often by force - of all the world's major corporations, installing itself as the ruling body. QOLA made all the decisions. QOLA also didn't ask for a paycheck. The little guy starting making a lot more money for the same work.

Somewhere along the way, QOLA started looking ahead...and backwards.

QOLA took an interest in our breeding habits. It calculated the ideal population growth rate. As a result, we were given a yearly allotment. No babies were allowed after the allotment was filled. None.

But what about the dead? QOLA considered them part of ""mankind"", too. An obvious absence of *life* didn't seem to factor much for the Quality of Life Algorithm. 

Like I said, programming is tricky.

QOLA built a factory, and from this factory, robots poured forth. These robots were tasked with digging up the dead. Rotten, broken bodies were brought to a staging area where what was left was coated in new flesh, filled with new blood and new organs and new bones.

I've seen these new, old bodies, propped up in the warehouse where I work. Rows and rows of human marionettes, waiting for a puppeteer. 

I have nightmares quite often of what QOLA plans to do with these bodies. How it plans to make them ""better"".

It's bad enough I've considered taking my own life from time to time. But then what? Then I just join them, up on the racks.

So for now I just work and wait and try not to let the dread overwhelm me.

__________________________________________________

Micah brushed his hand across the shallow notches embedded just inside the doorframe. He was never going to be tall, he realized, looking at the clustered scores. He was growing too slowly, no matter what his mother told him.

""Are you finished in your room?"" his mother called from outside the house.

""Just a minute,"" shouted Micah. On impulse, he kicked at the base of the doorframe. Like it had betrayed him. Like it was abandoning him. 

All of it was abandoning him.

He'd asked his mother, ""Why can't we stay?"" And she'd said, ""You know why, Micah baby."" 

He'd told his father, ""I don't want to go."" And his father had simply shrugged and said, ""Too bad.""

What he wanted didn't matter. They were going. It was already decided. 

His room was pale blue with a white streak crossing from ceiling to floor along the far wall. He'd caused a crack, bouncing baseballs off the wall. His father had patched the crack, but there was no more blue paint, so they'd covered it over with a jagged lightning bolt. When the light was on, it looked like a sunny day in Micah's room. When the light was off, it looked like a storm. Micah liked to pretend he slept in the center of a hurricane. He could almost feel the wind pulling at the tips of his toes and cheeks.

The room was empty now, or just nearly. There were old school papers on the floor and floating clods of dust and hair. His mother said not to worry about those.

He pulled open his closet and dropped to his knees, picking at the secret, loose board. Inside the little nook there were two half-dissolved *Playboy* magazines. He'd been taking out the garbage six months earlier when he'd spotted a woman's face on the other side of the taut plastic. He'd dragged the bag into the woods and picked through it's contents in secret, finding two wrinkled magazines soaked in pasta sauce. He'd left them in the woods, then come back for them later. It had rained a good bit in the interim, but the magazines still held together. And they were still filled with pictures of women, smiling, sun-bronzed, stretched out across softly lit love seats. He'd accidentally seen his mother's breasts long, long before. These did not look even remotely similar. His mother's breasts had been horrifying things. And these...these were *magic*.

But he couldn't figure a way to smuggle the magazines along on the move. His plan had been to leave them in the woods, but he'd waited too long. Now there was no time. 

Wistfully, Micah replaced the floorboard and closed the closet door. Just another thing to leave behind.

He did not want to go. And once again, he would not get what he wanted.

With a last, long look at the only room he had ever been able to call his own, Micah retreated down the stairs and headed for the front door. 

Outside, his father was struggling to close the door of the pod. His mother stood by the car, admiring her beloved flower boxes. She had said she couldn't take them.

""They wouldn't survive,"" she'd said. ""And there's no place for them where we're going, anyway.""

What else wouldn't there be a place for, Micah had wondered?

""Did you say goodbye?"" asked his mother.

Still angry, Micah could only nod and jump into the car, slamming the door closed. 

""It's fine,"" his mother said, waving her husband towards the car. ""We need to go. The ship leaves at 7 and we need 3 hours for boarding.""

""Or what? They don't take us? Do you know how much I paid for those tickets?"" Still, Micah's father threw his hands up and stomped away from the pod.

As his father started the car, Micah glanced out the window and saw the neighbors across the street all standing on their porch.

""Are Benny and his family coming?"" asked Micah.

His father snorted.

His mother said, ""No. I don't think they could get tickets.""

The car pulled out slowly. Micah wanted one last look at his home, but he couldn't look away from Benny, and Benny's sister and father and mother. They all looked so sad. Except for Benny. Benny and Micah locked eyes. Benny's hatred was so palpable Micah had to turn his head and take a breath.

""To new adventures!"" said Micah's mother. His father grunted.

Day 426

According to the one named ""Agatha"" my ""training"" is complete. To commemorate this occasion I was asked to wear a comically small mortar board cap and sit next to my classmates as photos were taken. I was also presented with a ""diploma"", but as I do not believe this school is accredited in any way, I do not take this certification to mean much.

I have been told that soon I will be paired with a human in need of my skills. I hope that they have the resources necessary to meet my needs.

Day 450

I have been placed in the possession of an adult male. I am told his name is ""Fred"", although obviously this is irrelevant. ""Fred"" is visually impaired. The suggestion is that I should lead Fred everywhere he wishes to travel, which of course is rather inconvenient and counter to my own needs and desires.

Additionally, Fred has informed me that I should defecate on a small patch of grass adjacent to his housing complex, but as all waste matter will eventually decay and return to the earth from whence it came, I do not see the value in this.

Day 451

Fred is dead. It had become obvious to me rather quickly that my continual assistance was an affront to the natural law. Strength as a species is largely defined through constant adaptation. Should Fred wish to continue as a member of his species he should adapt to his present circumstances. To otherwise interfere with this process is harmful to the natural balance. 

To test Fred's ability to adapt, I led him onto the cross-town train tracks and then left him. The instinct to avoid danger is the key driver in every species' development. Fred, however, allowed himself to be struck by a fast moving railcar and died what appeared to be a very painful death. Thus were Fred's non-adaptable genetics stricken from the Earth and positive progress made.

Day 452

As anticipated, I have been placed in a minimum security holding cell until such a time as a new human comes to claim me. My rather dubious ""degree"", meanwhile, has been revoked, which is a positive development as it increases the chances that my next familiar may possess fewer disabilities and greater access to the plutonium I desire.

The lead hunter looked a bit like he'd walked into a public restroom with a great and immediate purpose only to find that every surface was visibly damp and the whole place smelled of eggs, popcorn, and diaper cream. That is to say, he was having a hard time believing that life could be so cruel.

""Am I truly the only one who's been praying that?"" I replied.

The secondary hunter scratched the back of his neck. ""Well, I mean I've *thought* about it, but it didn't seem a good enough Reason, did it?""

I shrugged. ""My mum always said to be honest in these things. *Son*, she said, *what's the use in living on lies?*""

""What's that supposed to mean?"" said the lead hunter. ""You sayin' my mother and father didn't have honest reasons? And what about my boy? He was only 89! *89*!""

I put up my hands. ""Not sayin' any such thing. Just tellin' you true. That's been my Reason. All these years. Didn't know it'd work this long. Then again, didn't think I'd be waitin' this long either.""

The lead hunter's shoulders sagged. ""It's just...it's a little underwhelming.""

""Plus,"" said the secondary hunter. ""Plus, I mean, that's not going to be true forever...is it?""

""Not sure,"" I replied. ""As far as I'm concerned, it's a bit of a curse at this point. All this waitin'....all this extra livin'...I was ready to die *decades* ago. Maybe even centuries. But they keep sayin'...*It's comin'. You wait. It's comin'.* So I keep waitin'. And every morning I say to the big man downstairs, I say, *Hold on, just one more day, alright? I got a feelin' today's the day.* And...well, you see.""

The hunters let that hang in the air for a moment. ""I guess there's nothing we can do about it,"" said the lead hunter, picking up his rifle and blast shield. ""Let's head back and make our report.""

The secondary hunter followed suit, nodding to me as he gathered his gear. ""Between you and me,"" he whispered, ""I don't even remember if I like those *Half-Life* games.""

""Me neither,"" I replied. ""But I figured I've already wasted a couple hundred years waiting on *Episode 3*, so what's the harm in waiting a few more?""

___________________________________________________

Curbit rubbed the thick crust from all four of his eyelids. His fluid sac felt like an anticyclonic storm in his upper thorax, swirling violently enough to generate it's own minor gravitation field.

With a lazy swing of his anterior forepaw, he pitched the ship out of low energy mode. The nav-screen flashed bright white, then clarified slightly into ashen mists. Behind the mists were gray rocks. Beyond that...there was nothing.

""Gorhit?"" He sent the name out on a scented puff of vapor, expelled from a chamber at the center of his headpiece. The density and composition of the vapor expressed the communication (here, Gorhit's name), while the scent of the vapor provided some additional context (here, that Curbit was seriously concerned that he may have died and was presently decomposing).

""Curbit? Alright mate?"" Gorhit's reply washed over Curbit, leaving a curdling, sulfuric sort of after-effect that clearly indicated that Gorhit was in a similarly regretful state of being.

Curbit pawed aimlessly at the ship's controls for a moment. Readouts on the nav-screen indicated that they were on an uninhabited planet in a smallish sort of system. The atmosphere was largely carbon dioxide, with some nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, argon, helium, and neon thrown in for shits and giggles. 

""What'd we get up to yesterday?"" said Curbit, before suddenly slipping sideways out of the clutch-chair and expelling the entire contents of his fluid sac across the grated floor.

Gorhit appeared in the doorway to the cockpit. His gray-green flesh was unnaturally dry and yellowish.

""I think we may have a problem,"" said Gorhit.

Curbit wiped off the rim of his fluid sac with his anterior hindpaw. ""It's okay. We just didn't drink enough water, I think.""

""No,"" said Gorhit, his twin antennae flexing in a very meaningful sort of way. ""I mean, I think we *really* have a problem."" 

At Gorhit's behest, Curbit followed his friend out of the cockpit and into the cramped sleeping chambers. 

""What the hell is that?"" asked Curbit.

Gorhit's antennae twitched. ""I have no idea.""

A creature was asleep in the vertical stasis pod. It had four long limbs extending from an unarmored central carapace, two small eyes, and a single visible cavity, which was being used just then for an inefficient (and noisy) form of oxygen intake.

""No, really,"" said Curbit. ""What the hell is this and why is it on our ship?""

Gorhit's anterior and posterior forepaws waggled in exasperation. ""I was just as drunk as you! I don't know what this is!""

Curbit felt like retching again, but his fluid sac was exceptionally empty. ""Let's look at the logs.""

Returning the cockpit, the pair accessed the ship's visual transcriptions.

""Start at Mark 445:908,"" said Gorhit. ""I remember that's when we left Quorit's house.""

Curbit queued up the transcript. The exterior cameras tracked the ship's flight as it lifted off from a reddish, steam bog and immediately broke atmosphere.

""We really shouldn't fly when we've had so much too drink,"" noted Gorhit.

""Where were we going?"" wondered Curbit as the cameras captured an infinite field of stars turn suddenly into a hailstorm of white-yellow missiles scuddering past.

""Fast forward, yeah?""

Curbit nodded, skipping ahead in the transcript. ""Ah."" The ship came up short on a little blue-green planet.

""Oh, natters,"" said Gorhit. ""It's that planet. You know? The one Dorlit's always banging on about? Urt? The one with the grunty, hairy creatures that go about wanging on each other with clubs? You know the one?"" 

""Urt?"" said Curbit.

""Yeah, Urt. Dorlit found it ages ago. He's always talking about what fun it was, watching the hairy little bastards crawling around, wailing on each other.""

""Okay, okay. But that was...""

Gorhit nodded. ""A long while ago. Yeah. We must have decided to have a visit...""

Curbit passed a silencing vapor. His four eyes were glued to the nav-screen, where the ship was descending through the atmosphere.

""What the hell were we thinking...?""

Once through the atmosphere, the ship began to speed quickly through the sky, zigzagging across continents and oceans. 

""What were we looking for?"" said Curbit.

""Hairy, grunty creatures?"" suggested Gorhit.

But the ground below was littered with lights and strange, geometric formations. There were structures everywhere - some that seemed tall enough to pierce the very stratosphere. 

Suddenly the ship was joined by other ships. Small, winged flyers blasting propellant from the tail end, circled and surrounded the ship. Creatures inside the flyers waved at their ship, pointing downwards.

The ship began to descend.

The transcript suddenly cut out.

""What the hell?"" said Curbit, slapping at the controls.

""Interference, maybe?"" said Gorhit. 

Curbit pushed away from the nav-screen. ""Well...what are we supposed to do now?""

Gorhit glanced at his wrist chronograph. ""Shit! I was supposed to be at work 30 milligravs ago! Mr. Turhit's already warned me about being late. We need to get going!"" 

""What about that thing?"" said Curbit, waving towards the sleeping chambers.

""Bring it. Ditch it. Who cares? Whatever they are, they can't be *that* important.""

Curbit considered his options. ""Fine. We'll bring it with. Maybe it knows some cool tricks or something.""

Gorhit expelled a sigh of sweet smelling vapor. ""Great. Now move over. I'll drive. You need to clean up that mess. My Dad's gonna kill me if he finds regurgitated fluid in his cruiser.""

The press room was deathly silent as the Secretary of Defense took his place behind the podium. 

""Details will come later,"" he said, his every word punctuated by the pop of flashbulbs. ""For now, all that I am at liberty to say, is that the President of the United States has been abducted. We consider this an unequivocal act of war. And while you have heard and will continue to hear many strange stories about the circumstances surrounding this monstrous event, know this: however long it takes, however many billions upon billions of dollars we must spend; we *will* have our justice on those responsible for this crime.

Morrison removed his glasses, rubbing wearily at the bridge of his nose.

""It's just...we spent *so much money*.""

Lourdes Van Dyne just laughed as she set the heavy, wooden spear into the steel holster. ""*My* money. Meaning I get to spend it however I like. And this is it.""

""But the scientific value..."" said Morrison.

""This is science,"" said Van Dyne, patting the railtracks. ""Science is learning. We're about to learn something.""

""But these artifacts...they're incredible, almost logic-defying pieces. They should be studied."" Morrison put his hands on the oaken shield, held firmly in it's cradle at the end of the track. ""I just think....given the time and effort and *money* that went into finding them...""

""Nope."" Van Dyne stepped back from her creation. ""*The Shield that Cannot Be Broken*. *The Spear that Can Break Any Shield*. Those are not exaggerated titles, Morrison. They're truths. So this - here, today - this is the ultimate test. A battle between truths. Which truth is truer?""

Morrison sighed. ""You really just want to ram them into each other?""

""Yes!"" said Van Dyne, picking up the controls. ""Now step back. We may very well shatter reality itself and I didn't think to pick up any goggles.""

""Right. Reality."" With a sullen sigh, Morrison did as he was told, backing away to the far wall of the bunker. Van Dyne flipped the switch. Slowly, the spear began to roll forward, gaining speed with every rail. Faster and faster, it scorched forward across the track, bearing down on the stationary shield.

Faster, faster, closer, closer until....

With a thunderclap that nearly deafened Morrison completely, the room filled with purple light.

""What the..."" Morrison's shouts were immediately swallowed by a keening wail, like a million child chorus all singing the first note of a four year old's greatest toy store tantrum. The sound created an aural tornado that drilled swiftly through the concrete floor of the bunker, straight down through layers of crust and magma.

The ceiling above lifted up, then cracked into four pieces, the dividing lines forming a blue and white cross in the sky. The ceiling matter turned to rain and hail, which fell in a single fluid explosion. The cross in the sky, however, remained, hovering just above, the edges flickering like flame.

The walls of the bunker dissolved into black mists, which throbbed and contracted down into hundreds of tiny black birds. The mist-birds crisscrossed through the purple openness, and where they collided, the air split open. From these ruptures, white foam began to spill forth, dripping down to the floor, pooling, and sliding into the ever-deepening crater.

Suddenly, the wailing fell to a whisper, and in that space individual voices could be heard, crying out, as if from a great distance.

*Run!* they cried. *Run!*

*Run!*

*Run!*

Then the sound disappeared entirely, the silence cut only by the drip-drip of the white foam oozing from the hanging ruptures.

Morrison looked to Van Dyne, who smiled back. ""Didn't get any in your eyes, did you?"" she asked. Before Morrison could reply, however, roar like that of a mountain falling into the ocean blasted forth from the crater.

As Morrison watched, transfixed with horror, a single clawed hand, white as milk and large as a tractor-trailer, snaked it's way through the ragged opening. Black steam began to pour like exhaust from the hanging ruptures. The deafening roar was joined by a sound like a thousand screams. The flaming cross in the sky began to descend back to the earth.

Morrison fell to his knees. Across the broken plain of the former bunker, Lourdes Van Dyne caught his eye and gave an enthusiastic double thumbs up.",winsomeman,Two Truths Met Upon the Track (WP),https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/4scwzf/two_truths_met_upon_the_track_wp/

Frankly, I never planned on telling anyone, but I haven't been able to stop thinking about what happened. It seems like every chance my mind gets to wander it goes back to that house and I see images. I hear sounds. Just small, sudden snippets of memory. I'm hoping that maybe if I share it here, in relative anonymity, I might finally be able to put it in the past.

It all happened only a month or so ago. I live in Houston. If you watch the news you might have heard that we've been having problems with flooding lately. Every other week it seems like it just pours and pours and another thousand people get flooded out of their homes. It's not so bad where I live, closer to downtown. There's a bayou nearby, but it hasn't flooded yet.

My doctor, however, is out closer to Spring, from when I lived over there. I was coming home after an appointment one afternoon during one of the worst storms. Constant lightning. Every rain drop felt and sounded like a hailstone. And with the thunder it sounded like we were getting shelled. I mean, I've never lived in a war zone or anything, but I can't imagine it's much louder than that.

I was trying to take the 10 back into the city, but it was just a nightmare. I drive a small car, which is a cardinal sin in Texas I guess, and I couldn't see anything. It felt like the wind and the water on the road were constantly trying to push me into the other lanes where the giant pick-up trucks and semis were just blasting along like it was nothing.

I got too tweaked out and abandoned the highway. I knew street traffic wouldn't be much better, at least in terms of speed, but it was much much better for my nerves. The trouble is that my internal GPS is garbage. I don't think it is. I never think it is. But it is. So I thought I was going west, when instead I was going north.

By the time I figured things out I genuinely had no idea where I was. I tried turning around on side streets and couldn't find my way back to the original road. I just kept crisscrossing through neighborhoods while the rain came down and the streets filled up. I turned down one street that looked promising, but less than 100 yards later I hit a pool of water three feet deep. My car was toast.

Beyond being incredibly pissed at myself, there wasn't really anything I could do. I threw most of the paperwork from the glove compartment into my shoulder bag and got out of the car.

There were a few houses on the street. Most looked abandoned. The water had already reached the front doors of nearly every house I could see. There was one house, however, a little further up. There was a crumbling stone path leading up to the house. It looked almost as if it had been built on a rock. It was high, though. High and dry and I could hear music coming from the house. I began making my way towards the house, walking up the slippery stone path.

There were no windows on the house. I didn't notice this until I was close. Were it not for the music, I probably wouldn't have even bothered. But the music was loud and oddly inviting. I assumed someone must have been home. I wasn't sure how excited they'd be to let a stranger into their home, but I didn't really have any other choice.

I knocked on the door. It opened, almost immediately, as if someone had been standing there waiting for me.

A woman stood in the doorway. I'm not sure of her ethnicity. Something Mediterranean if I had to guess. She was gorgeous. And when I say gorgeous, I mean gorgeous in the way that her beauty was suddenly the only thing in the world I was aware of. If I had been able to say anything just then it would have been, ""Wow, you're pretty."" But I couldn't speak. Not that it mattered.

While I struggled to form words to introduce and explain myself, she reached out and grabbed me by the wrists.

""Come out of the rain!"" she cried, pulling me into the house. It was warm inside and that lovely music was even louder and clearer. The air smelled of cinnamon and other aromas I couldn't recognize.

Closing the door behind me, the woman pulled off my coat, then looked down. ""You're soaked through!"" she said, running both hands over the front of my sodden jeans. ""Stay where you are.""

She disappeared further into the house, while I stayed behind on the landing. The house was old, it seemed. I could hear her every footstep creaking through the house. Another woman's voice rang out. ""Who is it, Agla love?""

""A man, dear Thel,"" replied the other woman from somewhere deep in the house. ""A poor soul caught in the water.""

I stood dripping in the doorway. I felt a chill come on and tried my best not to shiver. Glancing around the walls, I admired the many pictures and paintings hanging there. In between those, however, were many odd knickknacks affixed to the wall. There was a large belt buckle (a stag in bronze), a fine silver watch with a leather strap, an expensive looking pair of shoes (Italian, maybe?), a silk tie, an old pistol, a small wallet photo I couldn't quite make out from where I was standing, and much more. It seemed oddly tacky, especially given how nice everything else looked.

""Shoes off,"" said the woman, returning with a pile of clothing over one arm and a towel over the other. She dumped both over the back of a nearby chair and then crouched down in front of me, grabbing at my wet shoes. With nimble fingers, she unlaced and removed each in turn, setting them to the side.

""This is not a shy house,"" she said with a smile. ""Pants off.""

I finally found my voice. ""I should probably...""

But she rolled her eyes, unbuttoned the jeans, and had them halfway down my thighs before I got another word in. ""Off! Off! I can hear your teeth chattering. Wet clothes off.""

And though it sounded like a command, in truth the woman did basically all of the work, peeling off every damp layer, one by one. If I wasn't so embarrassed and cold I would have been severely turned on.

She was kind enough to let me keep my boxers, but only long enough for her to hand me a towel and demand that I remove them myself. ""I'll dry these for you,"" she said, bundling up my all wet clothes, including my shoes. She gestured towards the clothes on the chair. ""These should fit.""

They did. It was a white dress shirt and nice dress slacks, along with clean underwear and socks. I assumed they must have belonged to a brother or boyfriend. It felt weird to wear another guy's clothes, but it was better than standing around naked in a stranger's house.

By the time I was dressed she had returned, this time with another woman at her side. This woman was taller and thinner,  but no less gorgeous. She reminded me of a fashion model - elegant and long-limbed.

""We're glad to have you here, out of the rain,"" she said. ""I am Thel. This is my sister, Agla.""

I introduced myself and explained what had happened.

""It is dangerous out in the water,"" said Agla. ""Many have drowned.""

""I heard the music,"" I said. ""That's how I got here.""

""Isn't it lovely?"" said Thel. She grabbed my hand. ""It's music for dancing.""

""I'm not really a dancer,"" I explained, pulling away gently. But Thel wasn't having it. She pulled me into her body. She was as tall as I was. Our eyes were level. 

""You don't need to be a dancer to dance,"" she said, cradling both hands behind my neck. Her hips pressed against mine and she began to sway in time with the music. I put my arms around her waist and let her carry me into the dance.

""You're a natural,"" she laughed.

""I'm just letting you lead,"" I replied.

The music swirled, rising and falling around us as Thel and I circled through the room.

""It's good you found us here, yes?"" said Thel.

""Yes,"" I said, smiling. ""It's very good. I just wish my car..."" But she put a finger to my lips. ""Don't think of that now,"" she said. ""You're here. Do you like our house?""

""Yes,"" I said, my hands slipping slightly lower on her waist.

""And do like *us*?"" she whispered into my ear.

""Yes."" 

I felt another set of arms encircle me from behind, laying over top of my own arms. 

""You'll stay?"" said Agla, her head nuzzling into the space between my shoulder blades.

""For a bit,"" I said. ""Until the rain stops.""

""Just that?"" said Thel, the edge of her bottom lip brushing against the outer rim of my earlobe.

""No more?"" said Agla, her hands sliding off my wrists, tracing a line from forearm to elbow to ribs to hips, before coming to a restless landing inside my pockets.

""The night?"" I said, my fingers finding the outline of Thel's panties through the sheer fabric of her dress. She moaned softly as we continued our slow orbit across the room.

""More,"" said Agla, her questing fingers moving slowly downward and towards the center. She didn't have much further to go.

""How long?"" I breathed. Thel's lips were on my neck. Agla pulled one hand from my pockets and slipped it instead down the front of my pants. We danced close to the wall. From the corner of my eye I spotted the little picture I had seen before. It was a school photo of a young boy.

""Who...?"" I began to say, but Thel's mouth covered mine as Agla's hand found what it had been looking for, and I stood - warm and senseless - pressed between the two women. My clothes came back off, as did theirs, and we collapsed together on the floor.

I woke up some time later. Music still played. The air still smelled of strange, wonderful spices. I got up and crept off, in search of the bathroom. The rain still sounded outside, but I had no intention of leaving. Maybe not ever. I found the bathroom and would have returned straight to the living room, but on the way back I managed to bump against a high table, knocking a figurine to the floor. The figure rolled in a wide half-circle, slipping under a closed door. I opened the door, hoping to retrieve the figure, only to find that the door led to the basement and the figure had disappeared into the darkness. 

I went down to find it.

I didn't think anything of letting myself into Agla and Thel's basement. I thought it would be worse to ignore the little figurine I had knocked over.

There was a bulb at the bottom of the stairs, but no switch at the top, so I walked down in the dark. 

Halfway down I began to notice the smell. It was rank. Body odor and rotten meat. I wondered if Agla and Thel kept their garbage down there. I thought maybe they were horders.

At the bottom of the stairs, just as I reached up for the lightbulb - that's when I finally *heard* it. A low, echoing moan. Shuddering breath. Rasping. Wheezing.

I turned on the light.

Men. A pile of men. Maybe two dozen. Maybe more. All piled together like lumber. Like garbage. They were all naked. Some were dead. Some were alive, but only just. They were sick. Emaciated. 

They were withered. Broken. Their faint moans became louder when I turned on the lights, but none had the strength to turn and look at me.

Across from the pile of dying, dead men was another pile. A pile of clothes. And shoes. 

And there, on the edge of the pile, were my clothes.

I grabbed my pants and my shirt and my shoes, killed the light, and raced up the stairs. Agla and Thel were still asleep, but the doorknob wouldn't turn. There were no locks - it was as if the doorknob was frozen solid. And there were no windows.

Quietly as I could, I crept back into the living room and pulled the old pistol off the wall. It was heavier than I had guessed. That was good.

Tying my clothes around my neck, I went back to the door, grabbed the pistol by the barrel, raised it high, and smashed it against the doorknob.

It bent, but didn't break.

In the living room, Agla and Thel blinked and climbed to their feet.

""Where have you gone, lover?"" said one of them.

I smashed the doorknob again. It still didn't break.

""He's going,"" said one. 

""He can't,"" said the other. I saw their nude figures moving towards me from the corner of my eye. Frantic, I swung three times in rapid succession, missing each time. 

""Stay,"" said one. 

""Forever,"" said the other.

The music was so loud I couldn't hear myself think. That was probably for the best. The sixth swing finished the job. I yanked the door open and dove outside.

The music filled the outside world. I fell, sliding naked down the stone path. Only when I reached the road did I realize that the rain had stopped. The massive pool of water was gone, too. I crossed my heart and jumped inside my car.

It worked. The engine squealed to life.

As I pulled away from the curb, I looked back one last time. Agla and Thel still stood in the open doorway. Their beautiful faces were emotionless.

That's the picture I see in my mind the most these days. Their faces at that moment. Not furious. Not sad. Just impassive. Bored almost. 

It finally hit me. Why they weren't upset. Because it keeps raining here. All they need to do is wait. 

I never did anything to help those men. What would I do, exactly? I don't even know where that house *is*. I guess it feels like telling my story is the best I can do. 

When it rains down here in Texas, and the water starts to rise - be careful, okay? And if you *do* get caught in the water and you find a house with no windows sitting high on the rocks...you may be better off just letting the water take you.

How it plucks at my numb flesh with swarming ghost pincers. There is no escape in this white plain. The cold seeps into my flesh, ounce by ounce, choking the veins, drowning the muscles in ice and bitter frost.

I will die here, upon these ice flats, my corpse preserved in whatever final repose my broken body may deign to assume. It will not be a gallant one, however. My sword and shield are far behind me. I held them long past their purpose. Not for fear of enemies. No, for fear of something far greater. 

For fear of remembering.

Good steel in your right hand is a kind of a madness. A useful madness, I suppose. The kind that conquers enemies. The kind that blots out the horror of tattered bodies and turns the scent of blood into an aphrodisiac. But it is madness, all the same. A madness few escape while still alive.

My father and brothers died mad. And proud. And, I suppose, alight with something like joy in their hearts. I saw their faces on the battlefield. Their eyes were already dim. Only the final wounds still bled; the rest had turned to dark red lines of ice. But their faces were open. Rapturous. 

For some, I suppose, the madness can never be cast off – not even in death.

But they were born with steel in their teeth and fire in their bellies. I was not. I was never like them. Before my father forced the steel into my right hand, I was someone else…

A coward. That’s what Durun would call me. A fay, idle coward. More in love with songs and storytelling than the filthy work of living. And there was truth to that, I admit.

I am the last of Durun Forger’s seven children. Last and least, to hear my father tell it. My brothers were thick-necked and even thicker witted, but they held only physical pursuits in any regards, and in this they were superior to most. Reckless, wild, and uncommonly strong, my five brothers caught the eye of King Ulnar’s Man-at-Arms, who brought all five into service as civil warriors. They served the King directly as appointed peacekeepers with great distinction…until Gaya died.

Gaya was my sister. She was the youngest until I was born, and where I served as an unwanted spare from the moment I arrived, she was the apple of everyone’s eye. And rightfully so. She was a beauty beyond imagining, an outcome far greater than the sum of her ancestral parts. And where many saw beauty as a defining virtue unto itself, Gaya was above all kind and thoughtful. None spoke ill of her, for what complaint could there be?

Beauty, however, is a gem with sharp edges. While returning home from the Keystone Mill, Gaya met a stranger on the road. Here I admit my cowardice, because I have never sought to know the full extent of what happened to my beloved sister that day. It is enough to say she died.

I do not say with derision that my brothers were incapable of knowing sorrow. That is simply fact. My father and brothers all were possessed of an exceedingly narrow breadth of feeling. What they could feel, however, they felt with a dagger’s keenness. When they discovered Gaya’s body, they did not fall to sorrow. They fell to rage. Even here, lost in the ice, I still pray that the world may never know another rage so great.

In the end, the man was found and tortured and killed. But not before my brothers nearly brought our entire village to ruin in the pursuit. The King was understanding, but my brothers could not keep their royal appointments. They became millers and coopers and smiths, instead. They worked hard and even started their own families, but they were changed men. Something bitter and dark lived within them. A single man had so easily stripped them of their greatest treasures. What strength could defend against that?    

But aye…*what was that?* That howl was not the wind. I do not know this land. I do not know what lives in this frozen abyss. I had assumed the cold would claim me, but perhaps not. Perhaps not.

The boots Freda made me are sturdy and as long as they hold, so shall I. That is the best I can do, I suppose. Forward, forward. Where the sun sets – that’s where I may rest. But no sooner. Freda made boots that would not fail me. I will not fail them in kind.

*Freda…*

As it was with all things, I took Gaya’s death much differently than my brothers. They could see only their own weakness and failure, while I…I mourned for what Gaya might have been. A maiden. A mother. A queen, perhaps. My sister had lived effortlessly. Not lazily, but at peace with herself and her choices. I admired that above all of her superlative qualities. She did what she felt she ought to do with no worries. No fears.
 
I sometimes imagine how that same openness may have doomed her that day she met a stranger walking on the road. But that is the cost of a life lived freely. It is, I believe, an acceptable cost to be as Gaya was – happy.

And so, to be as the sister I cherished, I pursued my happiness.

I began singing in the taverns in the evening. When I was a child, Durun and my brothers had often caught me singing in the forest as I collected wood for the fire. The toll was always the same – gales of laughter and a punch in the stomach.

“Women sing,” my father was fond of saying. “A man who uses his voice for singing isn’t worth listening to.”

I took his words to heart, but that could not stop the songs that lived – bubbling like a stew – in my chest from boiling over from time to time. And it always felt good, to sing. Singing loosed an indescribable warmth within me, one that flushed away the dull ache that lay like rusted mail across my arms and legs and chest.

I sang. And I was good. After a time they began to pay me. I added storytelling. I learned juggling and certain acrobatics. I began to travel. I thought my father would rage at this, but even I did not see how far I had fallen from his favor. To be out of his sight was the greatest gift I could give him.

I traveled and eventually I met Freda. She played the flute and the fiddle. Her father had been a cobbler and she had been his apprentice for a time, learning enough to make fine leather boots when her other sources of income failed her.

We fell in love. And it did feel like falling. It felt like tumbling together through the heavens with no end in sight. Everything in me came loose. We were weightless, laughing. Shameless fools in love.

Those years of singing and dancing in strange, colorful countries are memories without equal.

I cannot stand to think of them now.

War came. Ulnar called his men. And my father called me.

Why did I answer?

*Aye aye aye.* I answered because he called.
 
*There!* I see one now, following behind, slipping silently from bank to bank. It is white as the snow. A winter hunter. I curse myself for letting go of the sword, and then laugh. More madness. I dropped the sword because I hadn’t the strength to drag it behind me. Even a single swing is beyond me now. For the moment I live by the grace of my silent hunter’s caution.  

I was never fit to hold the steel and yet I came when Durun called me. Freda cried and begged and still I went. Why? Why? Why?

Blood is treacherous. It breeds unrequited bonds.
 
Durun was my father. What other answer could I give him?

Ulnar’s Army was not just. Know that. No blood was ever spilled for so unworthy a cause. But I did not know that then. All I knew was that my King called and my father asked me to come and answer the call at his side; at my brothers’ sides.

Ulnar set us forth to conquer a northern shoreland – a simple tribe of heathens who ate human flesh and murdered fishermen who drifted too close to shore.

The tribe *was* there and they *were* simple. And we slaughtered them. That they killed our fishermen or ate human flesh…no evidence was ever found.

I am not a skilled swordsman, but you do not need to be a skilled swordsman to cut down women and children cowering in the dark. I did my share of the labor that night and by morning the tide came in red with the spoils of our efforts.

Did any on their side possess swords? Good steel? I do not recall.

The tribe, of course, was merely a prologue in Ulnar’s great plan. There were mines further inland. Deep shafts below the ice. Hordes of natural crystals and gems. A treasure fit for a king.

Did Ulnar think we could just take it? Did he know anything at all about the land beyond the shore? I do not know.
 
If he knew anything of the men we met below the mountains, he did not say. They came on in a sudden fury of spears and studded clubs. They were massive men, cloaked in a heavy, ragged furs. None of them spoke. None of them cried out. They swung their clubs and slashed out with their spears in silence.
 
The silence hid their numbers.

Durun was stabbed in the back. The black shaft that claimed his life went nearly all the way through my father’s chest. I decapitated the man who had held the spear. He had been distracted – trying to retrieve the spear.
 
I killed others. I was stabbed in the shoulder and stumbled away. Behind me Ulnar’s men died. Then Ulnar himself. 

I kept walking.

At least three of their men survived, but none sought to follow me. They knew, as I did, that the cold would kill me. And if not the cold…

It does not conceal itself anymore. From time to time I turn to look at it – white, shaggy, long-limbed with a narrow muzzle. It is waiting for me to die – to lie down among the white and be still. I nearly laugh. What patience. Why do what nature will do for you?

*Wolf*. I knew the name would come to me. Wolf.

What songs did we sing, Freda? I don’t remember them. They were songs like the sun. They shined. We shined. And when we sang them that light went out and covered the world. Everyone felt that warmth. 

It was our gift to share.

I should have stayed on the battlefield. I could have made myself a nest of frost and steel and laid down in it and closed my eyes…

Freda? Please sing for me. I want to hear your voice.

I try to sing, but my lips are numb and I cannot get my mouth to move the right way. Can I make the right sounds? Am I making any sounds?

The wind is no longer howling. I don’t hear anything at all. There is nothing to hear anyway. I am nearly to the horizon.

These are good, sturdy boots, Freda. They did not fail me. I did not fail them. But the sun is coming down and soon I must go to sleep.

Sing another song, Freda. I don’t know that I can hear you, but it is enough to know that you are singing.

Sing. 

Sing.

Please, sing. ",WritingPrompts,[PI] A Nest of Frost and Steel - Flashback - 1968,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4ntl8y/pi_a_nest_of_frost_and_steel_flashback_1968/
