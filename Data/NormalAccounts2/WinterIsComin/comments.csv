86,"I think the moment where we see Illyrio's shoulders slump as Tyrion goes forth to meet up with Grif and Young Grif is a rare glimpse of the true Illyrio. 

&gt;""Good fortune,"" Illyrio called after them. ""Tell the boy I am sorry that I will not be with him for his wedding. I will rejoin you in Westeros. That I swear, by my sweet Serra's hands.""

&gt;The last that Tyrion Lannister saw of Illyrio Mopatis, the magister was standing by his litter in his brocade robes, his massive shoulders slumped. As his figure dwindled in their dust, the lord of cheese looked almost small.

He also makes sure to give Young Grif some of his favorite candy!

&gt; ""There is a gift for the boy in one of the chests. Some candied ginger. He was always fond of it."" Illyrio sounded oddly sad. ""I thought I might continue on to Ghoyan Drohe with you. A farewell feast before you start downriver â€¦""

If Illyrio didn't sire Aegon VI himself, he surely raised him from early childhood. The only other person he speaks so compassionately about is Serra, but there's a more theatrical nature to his spiel about her.

&gt;""A maiden? I know the way of that."" Illyrio thrust his right hand up his left sleeve and drew out a silver locket. Inside was a painted likeness of a woman with big blue eyes and pale golden hair streaked by silver. ""Serra. I found her in a Lysene pillow house and brought her home to warm my bed, but in the end I wed her. Me, whose first wife had been a cousin of the Prince of Pentos. The palace gates were closed to me thereafter, but I did not care. The price was small enough, for Serra.""

&gt;""How did she die?"" Tyrion knew that she was dead; no man spoke so fondly of a woman who had abandoned him.

&gt;""A Braavosi trading galley called at Pentos on her way back from the Jade Sea. The Treasure carried cloves and saffron, jet and jade, scarlet samite, green silk â€¦ and the grey death. We slew her oarsmen as they came ashore and burned the ship at anchor, but the rats crept down the oars and paddled to the quay on cold stone feet. The plague took two thousand before it ran its course."" Magister Illyrio closed the locket. ""I keep her hands in my bedchamber. Her hands that were so soft â€¦""

Anyhoo, those are just two of my favorite glimpses of Illyrio that we glean from Tyrion's perspective in ADWD. Is he genuinely emotionally invested in the success of Aegon VI, or is it a front that he's showing to Tyrion in an attempt to make him their pawn? I lean towards a mix of the two. Maybe in his scheming with Varys, it started from the concept to create the perfect prince to sweep across Westeros, and whether they actually rescued Aegon VI or if he's a Blackfyre or just some Lyseni, Illyrio came to care for the child.

98,"Even with the little we know about Joanna, I'm absolutely sure she wasn't interested in Aerys post-wedding.

There's nothing concrete to support the idea that Joanna returned his 'affection' as he descended further into madness, and on a superficial level, became much less physically attractive. She's not stupid. Tywin is the better consort of the two in every sense. 

As to this quote supporting the idea of Jaime and Cersei not being Tywin's;

&gt;One. One hand, clasped tight around the sword hilt. Only one. ""In my dreams I always have two hands.""
He raised his right arm and stared uncomprehending at the ugliness of his stump.

""I am a knight,"" he told her, ""and Cersei is a queen.""
A tear rolled down her cheek.

Could you elaborate why exactly that implies that they're not Tywin's kids?

101,"I'm getting tired of hearing about A+J=C+J.

**Joanna and Tywin got married in 263 AC,** at which Aerys made lude comments and 'took liberties' during the bedding. Not long after, she was dismissed to Casterly Rock by Rhaella and ""seldom visited court."" 

&gt;It has been reliably reported, however, that King Aerys took unwonted liberties with Lady Joanna's person during her bedding ceremony, to Tywin's displeasure. Not long thereafter, Queen Rhaella dismissed Joanna Lannister from her service. No reason for this was ever given, but Lady Joanna departed at once for Casterly Rock and seldom visited King's Landing thereafter.

**Jaime and Cersei were born in 266.** Sure, there's some room to say that Aerys could have forced himself upon her during any of those visits. But keep in mind the relationship between Tywin and Joanna, and what that says about her personality. It doesn't seem like they shared any secrets.

Tyrion, however, is a little more likely to be Aerys's kid in the sense of the timeline and Tywin's actions. At a tourney in 272 AC, Aerys insults Joanna, basically asking if nursing children had made her breasts sag. The day after, Tywin *resigns*. Wait, so it's totally chill for Aerys to fondle Joanna during their bedding ceremony, but insult her boobs and Tywin's done with this shit? Seems fishy. I find it more likely that the night after the tourney was the occasion on which Aerys finally assaults Joanna. That seems like grounds for Tywin resigning, and in his pride he would use the insult at the tourney as the cover-up reason. Tyrion was born in 273, probably less than a year later.

In addition, it's really unlikely that all of the current lannister brood are Aerys' given that he produced no other bastards we know of and many of his wife's pregnancies resulted in miscarriages. Many of Rhaella's miscarriages supposedly had wings or tails. There's a big rumor that Tyrion had a tail, and that it was removed. Loose connection, but it's there.

Either way its tinfoily. But it's a lot less tinfoil for Tyrion. ",2016-09-02 01:41:00+00:00,d767yxz,3.0,t1_d75ogus,27722.0,asoiaf

We might even say that, unlike the Dornish, whose independence was bought with burned flesh and broken castles, through the actions of Torrhen the North got independence in all but name, for free.

I don't think Arianne did any harm to Myrcella during the blackout. Your explanation makes a lot more sense. But I think OP is right to be suspicious about Darkstar's role.

179,"Moor was also noted not to have any significant allegiances, and this is a stretch but a man not having known allegiances could easily be someone Littlefinger would find extremely useful, and a kingsguard knight to boot. Part of the theory that Littlefinger sent Mandon has to do with a remark Tyrion makes about possibly knowing the true killer of Jon Arryn, to which Littlefinger literally sits up straight in his chair and says he'd be very interested to know who Tyrion thinks it is. 

&gt;""She believes she has good reason. When I was her guest in the Eyrie, she insisted that I'd murdered her husband, and was not inclined to listen to denials."" He leaned forward. ""If I gave her Jon Arryn's true killer, she might think more kindly of me.""

&gt;That made Littlefinger sit up. ""True killer? I confess, you make me curious. Who do you propose?""
It was Tyrion's turn to smile. ""Gifts I give my friends, freely. Lysa Arryn would need to understand that.""

After the reader knows about the true nature of Jon's death in ASoS, it's easy to sense Littlefinger having an internal freakout at this moment, because Tyrion's words could easily be construed as a veiled threat. Shortly after that is the battle, and the attempt on Tyrion's life by Moor. Cersei I think is the red herring, obvious candidate who Baelish himself knew Tyrion would probably blame.

&gt;Thus, the question I have is if Catelyn went out of her way to mistreat Jon in the past -- and which form this might have taken -- or if she rather tried to avoid and ignore him?

&gt;GRRM:""Mistreatment"" is a loaded word. Did Catelyn beat Jon bloody? No. Did she distance herself from him? Yes. Did she verbally abuse and attack him? No. (The instance in Bran's bedroom was obviously a very special case). But I am sure she was very protective of the rights of her own children, and in that sense always drew the line sharply between bastard and trueborn where issues like seating on the high table for the king's visit were at issue.

&gt;And Jon surely knew that she would have preferred to have him elsewhere.

The bottom line is that the way she treated Jon at Bran's bed is pretty much THE worst interaction they've ever had. Not necessarily excusable behavior, but she certainly could've treated him and/or Ned a lot worse throughout their lives.

 She mainly was out to protect the rights of *her* offspring, and in a feudalistic society where blood ties to nobility are very important, having John hanging around looking more like his 'father' than any of the trueborn kids Cat bears is what really grates on her year after year.

239,"These are the only things I've flipped recently. I also own a 51 but unfortunately can't find it:

**1. AB 3.0** 

My personal favorite, because I'm a rollover heavy flipper. Everyone here knows about the beast's butt. Although it's heavy, it has perfect aerial balance for my preferences. The chevron cutouts, rear weight bias, and the slim but long dimensions running on bushings make it consistent as hell and very forgiving. Makes me think I would really love a hole pattern ex10. (Next on the list to obtain)

**2. Replicant**

All of the preferential characteristics that are lost in the AB due to it's rear bias are present in spades here. Where the AB is methodical and flowing, the replicant feels zingy and glass-smooth, ready to respond to every wrist motion. Slightly longer overall and thicker due to the scale-liner construction, I really like what BRS has done with these. They filled a gaping hole in the affordable bali market, and soon they'll do it again with Barebones.

**3. BM42**

Smaller than the BRS boys, and with looser tolerances. The old standard bearer that time has passed by. It'll always be coveted and respected for being what it was for so long, and for its timeless looks. Now that community knifemakers have gotten so damn good, as a flipper the 42 has been outclassed for a few years now. Still a great overall balisong, which all modern makers owe at least some degree of respect.

- A utilitarian blade, at least as an option, could be pretty neat. I like your ruler idea especially.

- Given that Squidtrainer 1 is a lighter, aluminum handled channel flipper, a sandwich steel handle design with more rear bias would be very nice for diversity in 'feel'

- For similar reasons, a more circular handle profile would be my preference compared to the beveled corners of the Squidtrainer 1.

The weight is close, but the beast is a tiny bit heavier and the weight is more focused towards the ends of the handles. This lets it carry crazy momentum in rollovers and aerials, but slows down twirling. The Replicant has that characteristic as well, but not to as far of an extent; it handles a bit neutrally but can also carry good momentum without much arm effort.

Autoroll is a good way to describe the AB, though. If you enjoy horizontal flipping and rarely do vertical stuff, AB is a safe choice.
