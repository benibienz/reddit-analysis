Damn, is the balance on this thing good! It comes alive in your hands, and the 'swinging a bucket of water' analogy for horizontal rollovers is totally appropriate. I thought that twirling would be a lot rougher than the Replicant, but it takes only a tiny bit more effort since the handles are marginally shorter and the weight carries towards the backs of the handles.

The blade on this thing is as sharp as you've heard. I'm babying it after breaking the tips off of both my 42 and replicant over wood flooring. It already gave me a kiss on the back of my right hand as I slightly flubbed a scissor. The lightest graze managed to slice and draw blood. 

The grooves and angles on the handles make the AB not as comfortable as a rounded replicant but easier to control, since the handles themselves aren't as wide. It's also a bit less bouncy in its handling compared to my replicant, but that could just be my sub-optimal loctite job.

Only flaw so far: the latch. It's a tiny bit wide so it gets caught up all the time in the bite handle. If you're anything beyond an intermediate flipper, you gotta take that sucker off or it's gonna put a stopper to your combos at some point. The knife is much more confidence inspiring without it.

The AB melds a slender frame with an amazing rear balanced set-up and perfect dimensions in handles and blade. It's not a flashy knife, but it doesn't need to be. It's performance speaks all.

tl;dr the AB 3.0 lives up to the hype. If you have the means, I highly recommend it. It's the BMW M3 of balisongs; handsome but understated looks, with surprising practicality and performance. Looks like a normal sedan (butterfly knife) to most, but those in the know are aware of its capabilites.

The 42's natural state is to be flipped with sweaty hands. That layer of lubrication (gross, I know) has been helping me flip like a fucking speed demon.

I haven't flipped seriously since 2013, and I haven't really followed the 'scene' since about 2011, so I was utterly delighted to see that a couple of outstanding members of the bali community came together to fill the void in quality flippers ever since the discontinuation of the venerable 42. We are truly lucky to have the guys over at Bladerunners Systems!

I managed to snag a white and green Replicant off of Instagram a couple days ago, and I've now had the chance to play with it for a few hours. (I'm not a phenomenal flipper or anything, but I know most of your basic rollover combos, twirls and aerials. )

To the extent of my abilities, this thing flips like a dream. 

I was worried initially that it would be too heavy for my liking at 4.9oz, since I'm most used to flipping a 51. (3.3oz) After fooling around with it for a while, I've found that the way the weight is distributed in the Replicant makes it a much better flipper than the 51 and suits my preferences more than the 42. The 42's weight is distributed equally along the handle, what with each handle being a channeled piece of Ti. 

The Replicant carries its weight towards the ends of the handles due to the heavy spacers and combo of lightweight G10/Ti liners. Even the blade design moves weight towards the outside. To quote SilentJay, this knife is really what the 51 always should've been. It's longer, beefier, and better balanced. The center of its mass sits perfectly at the third chevron down from the blade. These characteristics make for a large but agile and predictable flipper.

It's main strength is how it carries momentum in rollovers. It moves through helixes, eight balls and chaplins with confidence. If the momentum stops, it's your own damn fault. 

The only trick that has held me up so far is the cherry picker; I think because I have an earlier non-rounded handle version it's a little hard for me to complete the underhand-overhand transition between my fingers 2 and 3. Hard to explain, but if you're familiar with the cherry picker you know what part I'm talking about. I'm convinced that this problem is probably solved with rounded handles, which all the newer Replicants come with.

Aerials came to me pretty easily at first, but when I started practicing opening and closing, it bit me pretty good on my middle finger and tip of my second finger. The blade doesn't come absurdly sharp, but I definitely got sliced pretty good. If you're a beginner, do yourself a favor: tape up the edge, and watch the FUCK out for the tip. It is just about the sharpest, nastiest tip I've ever seen on a pocket knife, period.

This knife is an acrobatic animal, if you can afford it on the secondhand market or can wait for them to hit BladeHQ, I highly recommend it. This is the perfect knife to save up for if all you've had are CCCs or Bear and Son/Bear Ops products. It operates in a completely different universe.

Compared to specific knives:

42: I like the rep better as a flipper even though it's a little heavier and not as pretty.

51: Really well made knife, but do yourself a favor and save up for a replicant if you're deciding between these two. You get used to a better and more rounded knife that will teach you well. If you already own the 51, it's probably better to invest in the Flytanium scales. (Haven't flipped a fly51 yet, so take that for what it's worth)

Kimura: Haven't flipped a Kimura for a couple years, but the build quality of the thing still stands out in my mind. It felt like it could survive a bomb. Replicant is objectively a better flipper; it's lighter and longer.

BRS is really an amazing company. These guys are balisong makers that love and believe in what they do, and were born from the flipping community. Props to them for putting out fantastic products at a fair price. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the Alpha Beast 3.0!
