The two rat covenant areas in the game are filled with deactivated traps that can be turned on with phaross lockstones, allowing a rat covenant member to create a gauntlet of obstacles. Then players attempting to go through these areas in their own games are instead pulled into the world of a covenant defender to face a booby trapped, grumpy rat bro defended version of the area.
