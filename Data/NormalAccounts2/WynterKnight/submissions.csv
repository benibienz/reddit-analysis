* 1080p gaming (preferrably mostly maxed out for well optimized AAA releases). I also like to multitask video on a second monitor while I play, and I have heard that some cards do this better than others.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* Im looking at something in the 800-1000 range. Some wiggle room allowed; if a big improvement can be made for another 100 bucks, go for it. Longevity over price.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* 3-5 weeks. I understand sales can change, but even having parts to reference from is so helpful.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

* Entire tower, including case, motherboard and all internals. I also should include a windows installation in this. All peripherals and monitors are fine though.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* Illinois, USA. 

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* 2 Asus 1080p monitors (one 27"" , one 21.5""), Logitech G9x mouse, Logitech G930 wireless headset, Logitech G106 keyboard.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Would rather not have to worry about overclocking right away. Might be an option down the line to get some more life out of the hardware.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* An SSD boot drive as an optional addon, do not take this from the budget unless some is left over. 2TB harddrive will be fine for the mostpart.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* Not at all. Keep the airflow good and i could care less about flashy looks.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* I assume so. I'm actually pretty happy with windows 10, so lets go with that.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

* I would prefer 16 Gigs of ram if possible (DDR4), and an i5 or i7. Dual core is really not a realistic option anymore.
