27,"**Budget** - Maximum of $50

**Source** - PC and iPhone

**Requirements for Isolation** - Isolation is not much of a problem, will be using at home most of the time. 

**Will you be using these Headphones in Public?** Yes

**Preferred Type of Headphone** -  IEMs!

**Preferred tonal balance** -  Want overall balanced headphones, but a little bass never hurt anyone :)

**Past headphones** - Haven't used any IEMs worth mentioning, best i've purchased were NarMoo R1M's and i like the bass but the quality wasn't all there. Also worth mentioning i don't have an amp nor have i ever owned one, i know nothing about high quality audio so don't roast me too hard. 

**Preferred Music** - Listen to rap, hiphop, r&amp;b, and a little rock here and there. 

**What would you like to improve on from your set-up** - Looking for some that will last me a long time, don't know anything about amps and all that stuff so if you could shine some light it would be appreciated i'm a huge noob. 

Sidenote: **The headphones need to have a in line mic! Might be using them for calls and such.**

I honestly can say that every route is flawed when it comes to surrenders, i cannot think of a way for people to avoid a cheater in a match though! Many of us don't have enough spare time to wait out a match to it's end, abandoning just gives us a MM ban which is basically like waiting out the game, but if they get rid of the abandon cooldowns trolls and derankers will abuse it. 

It's a touchy subject and i see no clear solution unless cheaters just disappear which is not possible. ",2016-06-15 20:11:13+00:00,d4anfgm,3,t1_d4ajnny,4608.0,GlobalOffensive
