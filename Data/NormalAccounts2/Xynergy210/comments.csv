117,"Best way is to get referrals for life!


**What is Referrals for Life?**

Some sites give you a flat amount of points for referring someone while other sites give you a percentage of what your referrals make for LIFE. This means as long as he is actively using his/her account to gain points, you gain points as well. If for example, you get 10% of all referral earnings and they get 500 points, then you get 50 points. As such, these are probably the best type of referrals you want to spread. I am going to let you know the ones I use.

-----------------------------

**InstaGC**

*[InstaGC gives out 10 points (10 cents) for everyone that signs up using your referral link and confirms their email address. In addition, you receive 10% of all their earnings.](http://i.imgur.com/Gj394mx.png)*

**[InstaGC [Ref]](https://www.instagc.com/293297) / [[Non-Ref]](https://www.instagc.com/)** -  I use InstaGC for one thing only and that is to watch videos [HERE](https://www.instagc.com/watch/) semi-passively. Play the video and minimize it and the points will rack up. Expect about $1 a day from doing this. The playlist will end after 4-6 hours or so and you will have to refresh and press play again.

----------------------------

**EarnHoney**

*[EarnHoney gives out 10% of what your referrals make for LIFE](http://i.imgur.com/I1tA0uc.png)*

**[EarnHoney [Ref]](http://www.earnhoney.com/home/?referrer=11E7916B72) / [[Non-Ref]](http://www.earnhoney.com)** - Play videos and earn points. Go to ""Buzz TV"" or ""Watch"" section and play the video and let the points rack up. I use Firefox and it's been working perfectly for me. You can make up to 30 HD (Honey Dollars) per hour. 100 HD is approximately $1. 

----------------------------

**SwagBucks**

*[SwagBucks gives out 10% of what your referrals make for LIFE. When they earn 500 SB, you earn 50 SB!](http://i.imgur.com/w03oKoQ.png)*

**[Swagbucks [Ref]](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/bankailou) / [[Non-Ref]](http://www.swagbucks.com/)** - I mainly use SwagBucks to play all the apps on my phone. You can search them up on the Play Store or take a look at all of them here: http://www.swagbucks.com/mobile.

I install a GreasyFork script to be able to keep track of all the points I make per day with Swagbucks. Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) first then install [Sbx Dashboard](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/4829-sbx-dashboard). You will be able to see your progress under ""My SB"" section.

There is a 12% discount every month on $25 gift cards so its best to redeem them once every month to maximize your points.

**G2A**

*Here is how G2A referral system works - http://i.imgur.com/oHjScZx.png*

**[G2A [Ref]](https://www.g2a.com/r/k2aellie) / [[Non-Ref]](https://www.g2a.com/)** - This site sells digital games for a really discounted price. Whether or not they get the keys legitimately is another topic. Their referral system is REALLY amazing because not only do you get referrals from the person you refer, but you get points from the people they refer as well. [They also use a cookie system so if they don't buy something from G2A immediately but do later on, you will still get credit for their purchase.](http://i.imgur.com/I6He9Wb.png)

right now since interest rate is ~0.xx%, money can easily be borrowed and so there is a lot of free cash flow right?

that means value of the dollar isnt as high as before?

so fed wants to increase interest rate so that people borrow less and then have to pay back the interest rate they currently owe thus the money gets ""deleted"" or gone from the economy.

increasing interest rate will cause inflation to go down so the people that already have money saved right now now has a higher value of currency?",2015-10-08 04:58:02+00:00,cvs6l2x,5.0,t1_cvs4k5m,4942.0,investing

edit: do u mean that since interest rate is at ~0 right now, banks can keep borrowing from fed thus money is constantly being circulated so there is a lot of free cash flow? and since theres lot of cash flow, the value of our dollar isnt as strong as b4? so by increasing interest rate, they try to decrease the amount of cash flowing and increase the value of our dollar?",2015-10-08 04:48:32+00:00,cvs6cl2,2.0,t1_cvs618c,741.0,investing
