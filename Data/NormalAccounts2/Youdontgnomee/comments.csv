1,"I hope I can. What's going on puddin? Just general wisdom or something particular? One thing I know for sure is that no one should ever try to face anything like this alone. If people reach out to love you and help you, take it. Don't feel guilty if you have to ask for assistance. Humans need to feel needed and loved. There is no way I could have done this without the amazing support system of doctors, nurses, family and friends that rallied together when I found out. I have never felt more genuinely loved and appreciated until this happened. And as much suffering as I went through, looking back on all that has happened, it still humbles me everyday that people want me around for as long as possible.

It's getting frustrating and monotonous, but the universe keeps working things out for me just when I need them the most. I'm just grateful that I'm not where I was more than a year ago...in agonizing pain 24 hours a day, sleeping 14-18 hours, and not knowing what was causing it.  I will say this though, when you are sick, the WORST thing you can do for yourself is to ignore it. And the second worst, is to stress over it.

Give yourself some time to grow, and be grateful for the women that are in your life as much as they are. Sometimes, relationships make life more difficult than being single.

152,"I can definitely ring in some advice here if you are willing to hear it. As a female, who has plenty of guy friends (yes I recognize that most of them probably want something more than a friendship from me) the biggest complaint that I hear, is that girls don't pay attention to them enough to get to know them. While I understand that some women are very superficial and shallow, you have to remember that not all girls are that way. While you are paying attention to the tall, fit blonde in stilettos...there may be an intelligent, interesting, loyal woman standing behind her. I have introduced many of my single and wanting friends to women, and so many times, the guys reject these girls before they even meet them. Reasons can be as small as ""She has weird teeth"" to ""She isn't Charlize Theron"". Point blank everyone has standards, but superficial standards should never be deal breakers. Of course, it is human instinct to want someone physically attractive but that is characteristic of lust.  Prioritize your standards in the 3-1 ratio. 3 internal characteristics for every 1 physical. I.E. I look for guys who are genuine, charismatic, and cultured...and I hope that they have sweet brown eyes. Most of the men I have dated have a good work ethic, are intelligent, and come from a good family...and it's a bonus if they have a cute butt. I will never date someone who has a dull personality, who is overly emotional or clingy, or who doesn't have any direction in life...

Fast forward to 22 year old me, on my own, and I get horribly sick while staying at my, at the time, boyfriend's house for the weekend. One night, I'm way to exhausted to get up and cook for myself so I give him basic instructions on how to make me a grilled cheese sandwich and microwave some tomato bisque. For a single guy, who can't cook anything beyond cereal, HE MAKES THE BEST GODDAMN GRILLED CHEESE I have ever tasted.. ever. In addition to his level combination of his compassion and care, my raging hormones took control and halfway through eating my sandwich, we start getting it on. I mean we went at it like two teenagers at prom!! Idk if it was all of the medicine that I was on or if I was just super into it, but it was one of the best sexual encounters I had ever had... almost an hour later, we finish up and I realize that I still have half of my grilled cheese left. I ate it in one bite. To.this day, almost 7 years later, I still can't eat a grilled cheese without getting hot and bothered...
