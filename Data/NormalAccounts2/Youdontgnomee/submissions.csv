Over a year ago, I fell really ill. I started going to doctors to try to figure out what was going on and no one was giving me answers. Within this past year, I started dating my boyfriend, let's call him superman. Superman and I have known each other for almost 3 years; we were friends for a while, fell off, ran into each other, had our first kiss on a patio overlooking the bay, under fireworks on NYE and then started dating almost immediately.  I mean it's kind of a fairy tale beginning, like super cheesy romantic. However, every fairy tale has an antagonist, right? So I find out, 3 months into our relationship about a very serious health issue that is plaguing me, let's call it kryptonite.

Now, one of the reasons that superman loves me is because of how happy I am all the time. Some people have resting bitch face, I have resting happy clown face. I'm a very positive and upbeat person. So, when I lose my shit, sometimes I don't show how upset I really am. It's a character flaw,  I do tell him that I'm upset, scared, angry, nervous, in pain, etc. I definitely told him what was going on and he understood very easily. Superman is 10 years older, formerly worked in the health industry, and he has a great grasp on life. He is calm, cool, collective, supportive. He isn't one to panic easily. 

But then, I find out that kryptonite is on a terminal level. I fucking lose it. I become a mess. That day, i gave him a solid out. I told him if he wanted to walk away, if he didn't want to do this with me, that he had every right to. We were not in love yet, we were barely approaching half a year, but THIS guy, this mother effer, grabbed my hand and said ""I got you. I'm not going anwhere"". 
 BEAUTIFUL right? The epitome of fairy tale.
 So I start treatment, I get sick, I get extremely sick. My mother has to come and live with me, she has to feed me, bathe me, give me medicine, drive me to all of my appointments. If boyfriend is superman, Mom is momgod. She just blows me out of the water how momgod she is. Superman kinda fades back, let's mom handle it, and comes to visit when I'm feeling well, cooks for us... all that jazz. The guy is just great. Just does everything right. 

 Recently, I have been feeling much better so momgod went back home, and superman is staying with me to take care of me. He talks to momgod all the time, he is friends with dadgod. He watches my diet, takes care of me on bad days, washes dishes, encourages me. My entire family...aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, they have all met him. Everyone loves him... except me. I feel so bad for him. I pity him. I would never be able to do what he did. I know that I don't love him, bc if he was in my position, I don't think that I could do what he has done. But, I want to be with him forever. What he has done for me, how he has handled this is the prime example of what a life partner should be. I would marry him in a heartbeat if he asked because I know that he is the type of man that would love me unconditionally for the rest of my life. Everyday there is a new checkmate in my very intricate chess game of a world, and I don't know if I have much life left. 
 The dilemma here, is that I NEED him. Boy, do I need to be with this man. I would actually die if he left me now, but I want to tell him to just go, run! Just leave me here, go live your life. I feel like I should handle this on my own. I feel like the biggest burden. It's so inconvenient. I can't even give him half of what he deserves right now. I'm a parasite, always needing help, up all night throwing up, interrupting his sleep; I can't even clean the house by myself. 
I hate knowing that this is a terrible experience for him. I just don't feel like he is happy and it's breaking my heart that I can't be the person I should be in this relationship. It's  very unfair to him that he has to suffer. The other night, he had a few glasses of wine and really opened up to me. He said something that I will never forget. He said, ""One day, I realized, that I was watching you die."" 
And this is true. I'm doing pretty well with my treatments. The doctors are optimisitic, but everyday is another battle. Just when I think everything is going to be okay, it takes a sharp turn. Everyday there is a new fear, a new problem, a labyrinth of health issues.
 I just want him to be happy. I'm kind of doing okay with this whole kryptonite issue. I accept it.  I do my thing, go to my Dr visits, take my meds... it's life right now. That's what I gotta do. He doesn't have to do this. He deserves to go to the movies on friday night, not the emergency room. He deserves for someone to cook him dinner, go dancing, take out on couples dates; he deserves someone who can make him laugh more than cry, someone who can fold his clothes instead of throwing up on his expensive socks, he deserves someone he can kiss and hold without the fear of ripping a tube out of her back and urine leaks all over the bed. This poor guy. 

What do I do here? Do I let him go? If I do, it's going to hurt and I'm going to suffer, but he won't. He will have happiness.  My selfish side says ""keep him around, who cares if he is exhausted and miserable, you are more important""/ but my heart says ""let him pursue happiness and just try to do this on your own, this isn't his battle to fight"" I'm terrified of being alone but I'm more terrified of hurting other people, especially someone as amazing as he is. Watching others suffer on my behalf is my greatest fear... more than dying.",Advice,My boyfriend is watching me die.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/569beg/my_boyfriend_is_watching_me_die/
