39,"ALRIGHT EVERYBODY I'VE GOT AN UPDATE:

I just spoke to her concerning all the replies and wishes I have been recieving in my inbox. 

I spoke to her on Facebook, but she didn't seem to trust me as I've never spoke to her before so she gave me her number and asked me to call her.

So I call her and talk to her and she just starts going on tangents about random shit. I eventually cut in since I am very tired from working all day and I just wanna get this talk over with and head to bed.

She goes on to tell me that she doesn't feel comfortable with getting gifts from random people on the internet so I tell her that was unfortunate since many people were willing to help. 

She starts to go off on another tangent talking about other irrelevant things, so again I am very tired and very hungry so I just tell her that I'm sorry we couldn't work something out and that she has a nice birthday.

She says and I quote ""Wow, so that's it? Fuck you.""

Then I get [this](http://imgur.com/a/akSAT) message.

So I guess moral of the story is maybe I should think twice about helping strangers from now on. 

**EDIT:** IT GETS BETTER. SHE KEEPS SENDING ME FUCKING VOICE MESSAGES ON FACEBOOK YELLING AT ME IN HER TANGENTS. Oh well at least she blocked me afterwards.",2016-10-16 02:08:06+00:00,d8ttsq6,1.0,t3_5710k1,356230.0,sadcringe

145,"Man, this post is so me.

I go through my whole MAL and change shows ratinngs at least once a month.

The worst offenders:

- **Evangelion** -  I didn't really pick up on all the symbolism the first time around and I just failed to see the hype. About a year has passed and I've done a lot of reflecting and learning more about what I watched and I've really come to appreciate it. That being said, I don't know what to rate it. I think I need to do a rewatch to get a concrete answer.

- **Welcome to the NHK** - This was my second rated 10 on my list. It sat that way for a while. After about a year I think I saw some pictures from the show that made me really think about it again. The show hit me really hard the first time since I was in a rough spot in my life, but now looking at it again through a different light I realized I downright didn't like this one arc in the show and noticed the choppy animation that I missed the first watch. That lowered the score to an 8 until last week when I moved it back to a 10 when I remembered how much I loved it.

I really struggle with my rating system: I try to rate things critically and as unbiased as I can, but some shows just hit way too deep for me to justify rating them lower. I guess that's what's great about MAL though, it's all subjective.",2016-09-21 04:43:28+00:00,d7vmz4n,1.0,t3_53riyx,594.0,anime

It was shown in a conversation between Roswaal and Ram that they didn't trust Subaru completely, so the three could have just came together and kept discussing the matter. Rem, being the only one other than Beako who can smell the witch on him, didn't mention it to anyone.

She even goes off on this tangent at the beginning of the seventh episode about how she snapped and decided to kill Subaru just because it made her writhe in anger just seeing him talk to her.

The biggest thing I appreciate about you is your willingness to learn. I have friends who are Silver V and below who want to improve so bad, but they aren't willing to keep an open mind to advice and actually take it. They're determined to do it on their own and that really stunts growth. 

You have a good mindset towards this game, you know that you don't have to be Faker every game and try your hardest to solo carry. This game isn't all about mechanics and fast reaction times. You can win a game off of vision and macro play alone. As long as you keep trying your hardest to LEARN the game you will improve.

199,"Hey man, I don't play this game so often anymore, but I still keep up with pro games and the subreddit. It genuinely makes me happy to see someone trying so hard to improve and enjoying this game. 

Kind of bums me out when I think of how much of a chore this game feels like to play. Keep it up! That really sucks about your arthritis however, at least you have a distraction.

I read your comment on why you take tp, build oasis, etc. That's fine, you gave a reasonable explanation which is much more than most players with different builds. My biggest suggestion would probably be getting Cooldown Reduction boots on Sona. You said you were going for more of a healer position and to be honest, Sona is more of a spam bot anyways so being able to hit 40% cooldown reduction is very nice.

Oh one more thing after glancing over your games again. It's really beneficial to upgrade your trinket to Sweeping Lens once you can. It really helps with clearing away vision and such.

Sorry for the wall of text, this post just made me kind of happy so I wanted to give you a genuine response.

Fate/Stay Night the VN has three main (?) routes.

- One route was made into DEEN's Fate/Stay Night adaptation. Not sure if this route has a name.

- Second route I'm pretty sure is called Unlimted Blade Works route and that is where the most recent anime comes from.

- The third and final main route is called Heaven's Feel. This arc is being made into a movie and IIRC it's pretty infamous because it's supposedly been in production awhile I think. According to VN readers, many people consider this arc to be their favorite. Not sure why, I think it's generally a lot darker and has some more mature themes. I *think*.

I was told that he was at the burned tower at the back of the city so I went there and battled through Rattata and Zubat until I reached the bottom floor. Then I saw the three legendary dogs in all of their Gen II sprite glory. I watched them leap up and run off: I was amazed. I spent most of my time in that game, painstakingly whittling down each of their health bars as I chased them across the Johto region. It was during this journey to catch these elusive beasts that I learned about the power of a technique I still use to this day: If you spam the A+B buttons while the pokeball is being thrown and trying to catch the pokemon, your success rate is increased by at least 20.754346%. 

After catching the three mythical legendary drifters, I thought my journey in Johto was complete. I had toppled Red, the former champion. I had explored the world. I had become a master trainer. Then I heard of this rumor that supposedly allowed a player to catch Celebi in the Ilex forest, not unlike the old ""Mew under the truck"" rumor.

He's a spooky skeleton knight who fights against the God Hand and who is theorized to have ties with Void. Why are they all dead? They were sacrifices to the Apostles and demons during the Eclipse. Where is Zodd at the moment of the Eclipse? Also not shown, but he is fighting SK outside of the vortex that the Eclipse is happening inside of. How can he exists outside of the Eclipse? Because he is an Apostle. Apostles are former humans who have forsaken their humanity to achieve their dreams. Now finally, the first episode of the anime is part of the Black Swordsman Arc in the manga. It is the first arc of the story, then the following arc is the huge flashback known as the Golden Age.

662,"When I was 16 I was invited by a friend of mine to take a trip to a little mountain town for this Oktoberfest they hold each year. We stayed in a pretty nice cabin that was about a 10 minute drive out of the town. The first night there we sat around in the hot tub and smoked some cigarettes until we got bored. My friend had the idea that we should walk around outside and explore the area a bit. We used to do this a lot back in his neighborhood, so I felt inclined to agree. I mean, we had nothing better to do. We took a flashlight and were on our way. After walking down the dark gravel driveway we hit the main road and decided to walk towards the left, the area away from town. After a few minutes of walking we found a stray dog that scared the living shit out of us as we took a detour down a little road. We were playing with him for a little bit, then decided to walk back to the road. The dog of course followed us so we just had to roll with it. A few minutes pass and we see another side road on the opposite side of the street and decide to cross it and go to it. This is where things get weird. My friend runs across the street and I'm just walking across it. Right before I finish crossing a car comes from over the hill going at least 60. After I'm done crossing I turn around and see if the dog is still with us, only to see the car hit him and the dog yelp. My friend and I look away for a minute and we look again and the dog is gone. There was no blood and we didn't hear a single leaf rustle from movement. It was like the dog didn't exist. We decided that we had enough and walked back to our cabin. Needless to say, we didn't go out the next night.",2016-01-24 17:56:41+00:00,cza6ieq,1.0,t3_42e6kk,54096.0,AskReddit

Now what has anime meant to me this year? Oh boy, this year has been crazy. I decided to take some time off of school, moved out from my parent's house, and started working over 50 hours a week at 19. This crazy change in pace was so difficult for me and I'm so thankful for my group of friends and all the anime that I decided to spend my free time watching. Every single night when I got home, I would dedicate at least an hour to talking to a group of friends on Skype and then watching as much anime as I can before I pass it. Those two things really made getting through working so much and living on my own for the first time much, much easier. One of my favorite things that has happened this year has been introducing two of my best friends to some of my favorite series  (Berserk, Hyouka, Steins;Gate, Hunter X Hunter.)

One of my favorite scenes in the show is when she gets drunk, because it's so uncharacteristic of her, but still so damn adorable.

I loved the Berserk anime and movies and I thought they were really well condensed to get Berserk more ""mainstream"" exposure. That being said, the two adaptations pale in comparison to the manga. Miura is in my opinion one of the best artists in manga, maybe second to Takehiko Inoue. Every panel of Berserk is drawn with such attention to detail that it is always a pleasure to look at. 

Miura's storytelling in world building really shine in the manga as well. It's hard for me to even put how I feel about the manga in words. I think it's the closest thing to perfect I've read in manga.",2015-08-30 20:19:28+00:00,cul2qja,1.0,t3_3iznlr,1589.0,anime
