2,"Faora was just making quick leaps/slides forward (we see Nam-Ek do that in one scene too).  She wasn't ""running.""  When Zod and Nam-Ek actually RUN at full speed, they make craters.  Kryptonian speed is based on strength.  It's not a separate power.  It's very much derived from that.  That's what separates Superman's speed and Flash's speed.  They come from different ""sources.""

So if Superman was thrusting forward for any extended length of time, it'd presumably be a pretty violent action.

And that's the way it should be, honestly.  It makes more sense, seeing as they're trying to give a pseudo-scientific explanation for Superman's powers.  I like that Kryptonian speed is more ""burst"" based.  It's not a sustainable thing, unless they're flying.

Heroes with limitless powers aren't always the most interesting.  They need a weakness.  Even Superman has Kryptonite.  You need something that doesn't make them ""better"" than their villains 100% of the time.  

As far as I know, the only reason why Flash isn't going light speed 24/7 in the comics is because he chooses not to.  But that creates some problems.

They wanted to recapture the spirit of the OT (understandably), so they focused on a Rebels 2.0 vs Empire 2.0 story.  And in order for that story to make sense, the Jedi couldn't be around.  So the whole thing is a little contrived.  

You could have had a story set 30 years after RotJ that featured a fully functional New Republic and New Jedi Order.  And new characters could have been introduced in that context.  But that's not what we got.

I'm not saying the ST is doomed.  There are ways they could ""redeem"" the OT characters.  But that's my point.  They NEED some redemption, as the ST has set them back, and it did so unnecessarily.",2016-10-17 17:55:56+00:00,d8w0e2q,4.0,t1_d8w04xa,301.0,StarWars

So if it was Vader's destiny to destroy the Sith, then I think it should be Luke's destiny to restore the Jedi.  And if they take that away from him so they can give it to Rey, then you've pretty much stripped Luke of the one REALLY cool thing he should have done after RotJ.

Keep in mind that I'm not talking about having Superman's ""dream"" be the FOCUS of the movie.  It's just his own little subplot that culminates when he makes his physical return towards the end of the movie.  It gives him some CHARACTER development while the main story is going on.  But the focus of the beginning of the movie would still be on Batman putting the team together.

And honestly, I don't think the movie is going to be that stuffed.  In all likelihood, they won't be getting into too much detail on the other JLers' origins.  They're probably saving that for their own solo movies.

Just open the movie by introducing Darkseid/Steppenwolf and the Parademon threat.  Then you move on to Batman putting the team together in a Superman-less world.  Along the way, we get bits and pieces about who these new characters are and what they represent.  Then you bring in the Superman subplot.  We get inside his head.  Then you go back to the team struggling to deal with the threat, only to realize that the world NEEDS Superman.  So we bounce back and forth between the Superman subplot and Batman trying to figure out a way to bring him back.  And then he comes back.  And then the team takes care of the bad guys.

The reason they chose Steppenwolf is because he doesn't need a ton of development.  He's fodder.  He can still be menacing, but he's probably not going to be that ""deep.""

This is where you're getting mixed up.  The Rebellion was an illegal faction that existed within the legitimate Empire.  The First Order is not an illegal faction.  It's the legal successor to the Empire (which became a rump state after losing to the Alliance).  While it's true that the New Republic controls most of what was once the Empire, that DOESN'T mean that the New Republic is a reorganization of the Imperial government (the way that the Empire was a reorganization of the Old Republic).  It's an entirely new entity.

The Old Republic became the Empire became the First Order.  The Alliance formed during the age of the Empire, won a war for independence, and then formed a NEW government (the New Republic).  The territories they control are irrelevant, as we're discussing the governments at hand.  So during TFA, there are two major governments in the galaxy.  One was formed from the Empire (which was formed from the Old Republic).  This is the First Order.  One was formed from the Rebel Alliance (which won its independence following the Battle of Endor).  This is the New Republic.  This is canon.",2016-09-12 03:19:22+00:00,d7j4dqv,6.0,t1_d7j44li,409.0,StarWars

Because as it stands, the movie suggests something that's slightly different than what the reality might end up being, as far as the geopolitical context goes.  And I don't think that's something that you want to keep a mystery, as it's important when it comes to understanding how the various parties relate to one another.

For example, the movie doesn't tell us that Republic's support of the Resistance is reluctant at best.  But that sounds like it might be important to know moving forward.  As is, it just sounds like the Resistance is a Republic-sponsored insurgency within the First Order's borders.  But from all the EU materials, we know that's not really the case.  So you're leading people down one path, only to change the perception in the next movie... unless you read all the extra stuff of course.  But that's my point.  You shouldn't have to.

If you're going to give us three distinct parties, and you want their relationships to each other to be nuanced, you HAVE to provide the necessary context.

236,"I can think of several explanations that aren't that complicated.  And I don't think it's shallow at all.  Whether Snoke is Plagueis or not, the character STILL needs to be explained.  I'm just not opposed to them CONNECTING him to this other character that was established in RotS.  Saying he's Plagueis in and of itself isn't enough, and that's not at all what I'm suggesting.  

It just gives us a new perspective on everything that has come before.  And I'm seeing it as a win for both of them.  Palpatine sidelines his master and gets to rule the galaxy.  Plagueis is forced to watch from the shadows for like 50+ years, but he gets to try to correct his apprentice's mistakes.  Palpatine WAS the real threat during the PT and OT.  That isn't changed.

And the Resistance was founded on the premise that the First Order would eventually threaten the Republic.  They were the only ones who could act though because the Republic officially had a non-aggression treaty with the Imperial Remnant (which eventually became the First Order).  

So it's not like they're two totally unrelated entities.  And without the Republic's big guns, the Resistance will likely have to turn to the other Republican systems for assistance.

346,"Thoughts:

This is a MUCH better version of this movie. It's not really a DIFFERENT version (so if you hated it the first time, this won't change your mind), but it's a more complete version of the story they were trying to tell. 

Right off the bat, the editing is like lightyears better. Scenes are given time to breathe and transitions are added between the various subplots. It's so much smoother. Also, Clark/Superman gets quite a bit more to do in this version. He makes several trips to Gotham to investigate Batman, which helps his motivation come fight night. 

It's not really like one or two scenes that fill out the 30 minutes, but it's like they sprinkled in new stuff throughout the movie that simply expands on what's going on. To be honest, WB is pretty dumb for not releasing this version of the movie to begin with. I have a feeling that fewer people would have bitched about it. But one could also argue that they shouldn't be making a 3 hour superhero movie to begin with. So I get both sides. But the Ultimate Edition thankfully expands on what needed to be expanded on.
