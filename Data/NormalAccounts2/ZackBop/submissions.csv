That said, I think it's important that he maintain this ability.  Him being as fast as light is what makes him awesome.  But how do you limit this power?

I think they could introduce a concept (and maybe this is already in the comics) where the more power he draws from the Speed Force (which allows him to move at light speeds), the more ""drained"" he gets.  Think of it like the Super Saiyan concept from DBZ.  You can only stay in that ""state"" for a limited time.  Otherwise, it drains you completely.

Yes, it's kind of a ""know a guy who knows a guy"" type of situation, but both of the individuals in question work for WB.  That's as much as I'll say about that.  I had a very long phone conversation with one of them.  And with that, here is what I can tell you:

The movie does indeed begin with a ""history lesson.""  Darkseid has invaded Earth before, but he was fended off by an alliance of humans, Atlanteans, and Amazonians.  He came to Earth via this giant portal (Boom Tube) that was sustained by three Motherboxes.  Following his defeat, the Motherboxes were scattered around the planet (one with humans, one with Atlanteans, and one with Amazonians).  The basic idea is that the more Motherboxes you have in one place, the more powerful the portal becomes, which in turn leads to more forces of Apokolips coming through.  Keep that in mind, as it relates to the plot later on.  Oh, and guess who's narrating the opening?  Diana Prince, of course.  And who is she talking to?  Bruce Wayne.

So we jump back to present day and the world is still mourning Superman.  Bruce, worried about what could be coming, is searching out the metahumans from Lex's file.  We find him in the north looking for Arthur Curry.  As the trailer shows us, Arthur is not interested in joining.  Bruce returns to Gotham to explain the situation to Diana.  Bruce and Diana discuss that, and then Diana mentions that there have been sightings of what we know to be Parademons.  She goes off to try and recruit Cyborg, while Bruce suits up as Batman to investigate the Parademon sightings.

Diana suspects that the ""birth"" of Cyborg is what led to the Parademons to Earth (since he was created by a Motherbox).  The pieces are starting to come together.  The Parademons are trying to bring the Motherboxes together (one of which is Cyborg himself) to lead the forces of Apokolips to Earth.  Unfortunately for Bruce and Diana, Cyborg also turns them down.  But shortly after, they (the Parademons, obviously) kidnap Cyborg's father in an effort to draw him out.

Bruce and Diana meet once more and discuss whether it's even worth it to try and recruit Barry Allen.  Both are feeling a little down that they've been unsuccessful thus far.  But Bruce agrees to give it a try.  We get the scene from the trailer, and Bruce is obviously surprised (but happy) when Barry agrees to join.  The three of them (Bruce, Diana, and Barry) then travel to Gotham to meet with Gordon and discuss the recent Parademon events.  This is where Cyborg joins them, as he wants to get his father back.  Together, the team goes on their first mission.  Gordon tells them that there have been Parademon sightings in Gotham's sewers.  They go to check it out, which leads to the first big action set piece (other than the opening).  They're able to take out the Parademons lurking down there, but not without taking a few bumps and bruises.  The four of them might not be enough to get the job done.  Cyborg then hacks into all computer networks and GPS tracking systems to find that the Parademons are moving toward the Mediterranean Sea.  Diana realizes that they're going to ""the ruins"" of Themyscira (I found it interesting that my source referred to it as ""the ruins"") to snatch up the Motherbox there.  The team knows they have to go there to stop them, but there is a debate about whether they can bring Cyborg along because of the implications of his presence there (being next to one of the other Motherboxes).  Cyborg gives them the whole, ""I'm not staying behind,"" speech and says he has to save his father.  They jump in the Flying Fox and head in that direction.

From there, the story moves in an interesting direction.  For those who didn't want another ""dream sequence"" in JL, you might be disappointed, but I think this totally works, as it gives Superman a role in the movie besides just being the savior at the end.  The story jumps to Krypton.  You heard that right.  We see Kal-El (in his black suit) living happily alongside Jor-El and Lara.  We quickly learn that this is taking place inside Clark's comatose mind.  While Clark is ""happy"" here, he isn't truly fulfilled.  The sequence then transitions to Smallville.  Clark is working on the farm with his aging father and mother, and while he's still ""happy,"" he longs for something more.  Finally, the sequence transitions to Metropolils.  What was described to me here sounds like the closest thing we're getting to a Reeve-esque Superman moment from Cavill.  He's on assignment with Lois, but then he hears trouble and runs off to save the day, smiling (yes, smiling) and kissing Lois goodbye as he leaves.  We get the shirt-rip too.  The sequence ends with Superman making the save and finding true happiness in helping others.  We then cut back to what's going on in the ""real world.""

I'm going to briefly cover what happens next, as I have to leave soon.  So basically the JL arrives at Themyscira and things go south pretty quickly.  Because Cyborg is near the other Motherbox, the portal grows stronger and Steppenwolf comes through.  The heroes are in real trouble now, as Steppenwolf and the Parademons are going to march on Atlantis and seize the final Motherbox (so Darkseid can arrive).  Batman comes to realize that they aren't going to stop them without Superman, and the team agrees to split up.  Batman will travel to Arkham to speak with Luthor, while the rest of the team will travel to Atlantis make one final pitch to Arthur.  You can probably guess where things go from here.  Batman finds out from Luthor that there's a way to revive Superman in the Kryptonian ship, but Luthor won't agree to tell him unless he gets him out of Arkham.  Batman reluctantly agrees.  And as the rest of the JL is trying to convince Arthur, the attack on Atlantis begins.  With that, he agrees to help them and protect his people.  

So the final act of the story begins with Batman reviving Superman and the JL trying to protect Atlantis (which is off the coast) from Steppenwolf and the Parademons.  Batman and Superman join the fight, and together, the united JL is able to save the day and prevent the arrival of Darkseid.  The story ends with Superman addressing the planet from Washington, DC.  My friend explained that there's a sort of montage of scenes that will show the people of Earth looking hopeful about their new heroes, and that's intercut Clark reuniting with Lois and his mother.  

And yes, there will be a post-credits scene.  Two, actually.  The first is Luthor making an ""agreement"" with Deathstroke.  The second shows Abin Sur crash landing on Earth.

Obviously, I had to leave a bunch of stuff out.  To be clear, I don't have ALL the details about what happens.  Just the general flow of the story with some details sprinkled in.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask, but I can't guarantee that I'll know the answer.  But whether I do or don't, I'll let you know.

Again, this could end up not being accurate, but it's from people I trust.  So fire away.

Luke makes a promise that he'll seek out more Force potentials and return to the fight as soon as he can.

And that won't happen until the end of IX.  He'll sit out most of the movie, and when it looks like all hope is lost, he'll return with a group of new Jedi (maybe like 4-5 students) and help the good guys win.

What happened to Leia after the OT? She failed the secure the peace that she fought so hard for and ended up getting drawn back into conflict with a new version of the Empire. 

And Luke? He failed to start up a new Jedi Order and become the great Jedi Master that we all thought he would become.

But if Luke can get a new Jedi Order off the ground before he dies, then he will be redeemed (IMO). And if Leia eventually secures some peace in the galaxy, she'll get her happy ending. As for Han... If Ben still feels bad about what he did and eventually turns good, then maybe Han didn't die in vain.

But the symbol of that freedom -- the New Republic -- was destroyed by the NEW version of the Empire before we even got a chance to know about it or care about it.  And yes, Luke apparently put together some sort of new Jedi Order, but that was also destroyed (off-screen, no less) before we got a chance to know about it or care about it.  
 
So our heroes ""won"" in the OT, but did they really?  By the end of TFA, it's like all of their accomplishments never even happened.  We didn't get to see the ""spoils"" of what they fought for.

They could remedy this by having our new heroes help the old ones FINISH the job (by creating an even better version of the New Republic and an even better version of the Jedi Order), but if our older heroes all die off before that happens, it'll be kinda hard to see them as anything other than failures.

In any case, I have a general idea of what happened prior to TPM, and I also have my own thoughts (fan-fic) on what may or may not have happened (in a general sense).  I try to just go by the movies, books, comics, and TV shows.  But here is how I like to think about it:

GALACTIC HISTORY ACCORDING TO ZACKBOP

In the beginning, there was chaos.  A great number of galactic governments were all fighting for power.  It was a full-scale war.  A small group of monks who studied the Force -- the Jedi -- proposed the idea of a Galactic Republic to secure peace and justice.  This happened roughly 26,000 years before ANH.  When the Jedi themselves rejected official positions of power, a group of power-hunger Jedi left the Order to create the Sith Brotherhood. 

Over the next 25,000 years, there was perpetual corruption, gridlock, and infighting among the Republican systems.  Although full-scale wars were avoided, the government was deteriorating over time.  This was mainly due to the Sith's attempts at seizing power for themselves.  Roughly 1,000 years before the Clone Wars, the Sith were all but defeated and the Republic underwent a democratic reformation to secure a lasting peace.  The Sith (now in hiding) also reformed under Darth Bane, who instituted the Rule of Two.  

And that pretty much takes us right up to TPM, when the Sith made their presence known again and the Republic started to fall apart.

Again, this is just generally how I think about galactic history.  I'm sure not everything I said there is canon, but it's just how I like to understand it when I watch the movies.  And as far as I know, nothing I said here is actually contradicted by the movies (though I could be wrong).",StarWars,Where is all of the galactic history stuff canonized?,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/50hcf9/where_is_all_of_the_galactic_history_stuff/

Just that he destroyed ""it all"" (as in, what Luke had built). This likely entails the deaths of most of Luke's students, but what if some of the older ones survived? What if Luke basically told them to go into hiding to avoid whatever plans Snoke had for them? 

Snoke seems to believe that Skywalker's return will lead to the rise of the new Jedi. That could be because he'd go searching for brand new students, or it could be because he already has some students out there who he could recruit back into his circle. 

Here is what I'm thinking: 

Luke is reluctant to train Rey because of what happened with Ben. He doesn't want to be responsible for training a group of Force wielders that can fall to the dark side. So that's why he broke up what was left of his Jedi Order. During Rey's training, she learns about his other students. And after the good guys suffer some sort of defeat in Episode VIII, she convinces Luke to go find the remaining students, as the galaxy needs the Jedi now more than ever.
