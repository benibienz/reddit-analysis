First of all I am a fan of the Helix Duo I posted about. If I can't come on here and say "" hey guys check out this modded nes this guy built over at helixduo.com."" then what can i say? Am I supposed to paint some fucking hieroglyphics on a wall and take a picture of it? Or how about this ""I'm going to wait for this cool system who's name I can't say. I will be far to busy playing with this system who's name I can't say to be bothered with the nes classic (am I allowed to say that I mean I might work for Nintendo and I could be marketing for them) anyway this system which from here forward I will call ""&lt;♤♡●÷%£$"" (since the mere mention of its actual name angers the almighty dark overlords of the ban hammer realm.) Is really cool it can do really cool things except you guessed it I can't mention a thing it actually does. But trust me it's awesome. Since I can't mention the ""&lt;《♤♡●÷%£$"" by its real name you will have to Google it on your own. Just google He....oops almost said it I could feel the dark overlords picking up their ban hammers... so in closing here is what I've been able to share with you:

Cool system... can't say it's name
It can be found on a website...but I cant give you the sites name
It does some really cool stuff trust me...but I'll get banned if I tell you any of it

Do you realize just how fucking dumb this shit is? Isn't that the god damn point of websites like yours? Isn't this where people come to freely chat about cool stuff they find? I could understand if I had posted this in say in a subreddit for classic barbie doll collectors. But I posted about a cool retro system in the GOD DAMN subreddit ""RETROGAMING"" did you reign down the ban hammer on the first person that posted about the nes classic edition? Did you accuse them of attempted marketing? That person could be working for nintendo. Obviously you didn't because there is an nes classic thread. Yet I get banned from the retrogaming thread for sharing something cool I found... and get threatened that if I tried posting again I would get a full site ban. I'll tell you what get your hand off your never seen an actual woman dick. And grab your almighty ""hammer o bans a lot"" and hit me with it. Cause I don't give a flying fuck if you all out ban me.

**9,720** metallicats *banging their head against the stage like they never did before* for **7 years!**

Man, I fucking love [Metallica](http://www.gfycat.com/OptimalValidHyrax). First of all, their music is fucking good. Not a lot of bands have the ability to create compositions like [*Master of Puppets*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx27NL_iqEM), which almost has more in common with Beethoven than it does with rock and roll. Second, they still rock. 

Metallica is very special to me. I remember when I first got on the internet the very first [Excite](http://www.excite.com/) search I did was for Metallica. The band helped get me through some tough times with songs like *Fade to Black* and *Sanitarium*. And when they weren't doing that I was rocking out with *Battery* and *For Whom the Bell Tolls.* The first CD I ever owned? Metallica. The first ""real"" concert I ever went to? Metallica with Jerry Cantrell and Days of the New on September 11th, 1997.  So, I am pretty happy to get to feature /r/Metallica on Subreddit of the Day, especially since it's never been featured before. 

The reason why /r/Metallica was chosen as Subreddit of the Day is because tomorrow is a very special day. For the first time in eight years Metallica is releasing a new album, **Hardwired... to Self-Destruct**! It's also the first time they've released an album since I've been on reddit. 

So far, the three tracks officially released sound fucking metal.  

* [Hardwired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhBHL3v4d3I)
* [Moth Into Flame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tdKl-gTpZg)
* [Atlas, Rise!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFAcOnhcpGA)

The leaked tracks sound good too, but I ain't about to link to some illegal streams. 

**Edit:** Okay, the day before this feature is to go live Metallica released all the tracks on [Metallica.com](https://metallica.com/) in the form of music videos. My favorite track off this album is [*Spit Out the Bone*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m46Z0-HXySo&amp;ab_channel=MetallicaTV). I am really resisting the urge to write an album review in this space. Since I think it's more fun for people to have a listen themselves and form their own opinions, I ain't gonna. So tell us what you think in the comments. 

/r/Metallica is where the reddit party is gonna be tonight for everyone who is picking up the new album at 11:59PM today for **BLACKENED FRIDAY** midnight releases. The sub is already all abuzz with the likes of [fan-made album art](https://i.reddituploads.com/0d0b2fac17014948812bc873c49d39e4?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=526e2e5728d269ad184392e14103ae95), [fan covers of new songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4q4H2I1SxE), and of course all of the news and interviews that come with a big album release like this. 


That's enough from me.  All I really had to say here was ""new Metallica album!"" So, let's talk to the mods. 

---


&gt;#1. Tell me about your first experience with Metallica. (How old were you. What was the first song you heard, first album you had, etc.)

&gt;&gt;**/u/gws923:**  I was maybe 8 or 9 years old and Enter Sandman came on the radio in the car. I had been listening mostly to Raffi and other kid songs up until that point but for some reason sandman caught my attention. ""What... What is this?"" I asked my bro. He bought me the album Ride the Lightning and gave me his old boom box. I stuck the tape in, sat on the floor and listening to For Whom The Bell Tolls over, and over, and over again. It was love at first sight.

&gt;&gt;**/u/OhFuckBalls:**  It was 2008 and I was 15, my father who then lived abroad, gifted me his old school music player with just one thing on it - Death Magnetic. That was my rather late introduction to music as a whole, and it was the only album I listened to for a couple months.

&gt;&gt;**/u/thepistonhead:** One night in 2006, I was bored out of my mind surfing channels on TV. One channel was playing 'Some Kind of Monster' - Metallica's newest documentary. I was not interested in Metallica at this point, but hey, there was nothing else to watch.

&gt;&gt;Before this point, my friends had tried getting me into Metallica, but I hated them. I recall vividly downloading Master of Puppets upon the recommendation of a friend, listening to the first track 'Battery, frowning my face then deleting the whole thing after 2 minutes. I was scared by it. It was nothing like I had heard before.

&gt;&gt;However, when I watched 'some kind of monster', I found myself headbanging along to the title track. I loved how slow and heavy it was compared to Battery. This is ironic because 1) the typical entry into Metallica is with the thrashier music like Battery and 2) some kind of monster and St. Anger get a lot of shit, but without it, I would never have gotten into Metallica and seen them live 6 times around the world.

&gt;#2. What's your favorite song (and why)?

&gt;&gt;**/u/gws923:** Hard to say. For the sake of picking I'll go with Damage Inc.

&gt;&gt;**/u/OhFuckBalls:**  Hard to choose and all, but probably Orion. A choice and a song that speaks for itself.

&gt;&gt;**/u/thepistonhead:** Orion. Cliff Burton's bass is magical and I find the fact that he didn't play the song before his death incredibly touching.

&gt;#3. What's your favorite album (and why)? 

&gt;&gt;**/u/gws923:** Just as hard. I would say either Ride the Lightning or Kill em all, though Death Magnetic pretty single handedly got me through a very tough year of my life.

&gt;&gt;**/u/OhFuckBalls:**  ...And Justice for All. Something about the aggression, despair and anger of the whole album just grips me and refuses to let go.

&gt;&gt;**/u/thepistonhead:** ...And Justice For All. Metallica's technical peak and lyrical peak in my opinion.

&gt;#4. A lot of people seem to love the old shit and hate the new, or to love it all, or love it all except for St. Anger. What's the atmosphere like on /r/Metallica? 

&gt;&gt;**/u/gws923:** Ah yes, the age old question. While I personally favor the older stuff, Death Magnetic, and a few select tracks from the others, I would say the subreddit at a whole tends to run the gamut. People are very quick to defend 90s Metallica in our sub, though the old guard has its representation as well. It is amazing how much people will argue about old/new Metallica, whether Lars sucks or not... We can be pretty divided. But I think the general atmosphere is ""to each their own.""

&gt;&gt;**/u/OhFuckBalls:**  Hey, St. Anger is one of my all time favourites... As /u/gws923  said, the atmosphere is pretty much ''to each their own'', and it seems like even St. Anger finds some respect after all these years.

&gt;&gt;**/u/thepistonhead:** We escape most of the hate; to actively subscribe to a Metallica subreddit signifies some continued interest and fandom of the band. The criticism we do get is mostly constructive and discussed in a relatively mature manner to other areas on the internet.

I've been going back to the old games and am running into a problem that I don't remember. 

When calling a lot of passing plays the QB is automatically handing off the ball to the HB. I press A for the snap. I naturally press down to get some room to throw, but then the HB gets the ball and I am running backwards. The HB is on A, so it's as if the controller is pressing A twice. 

I at first thought it was a controller problem, but I tried it with several controllers and it just keeps automatically handing off the the HB on a lot of plays, even if I don't press any buttons. 

This is happening in all three NFL 2K and 2K1.  

Here's my second question. This one only pertains to 2K1. There's a defensive play called ""Atomic Blitz."" My friend and I were playing 2K1 the other day and he started picking this on every play. I couldn't find a way to stop it. I started doing the same to him and he couldn't stop it either. It shut down every running play and sacked the QB before any pass could be thrown. Once we started doing this the game just came to a total halt and we'd have to punt on a 4th down. The only time any points got on the board is if the punt was returned within FG range. So, my questions this: How do you stop that or defend against it? 

I played hours and hours of 2K1 online back in the day, and played in tournaments on Dricas, and I never had either of these problems, nor do I recall anyone ever mentioning it. I feel like, in both cases, we just forgot how to play. We're getting together next weekend for a session of Dreamcast games, so I'd like to try and figure out what I am doing wrong. Any advice would be appreciated. ",dreamcast,Need some help with the NFL 2K series,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamcast/comments/5c4tsd/need_some_help_with_the_nfl_2k_series/

For those who don't know, *Humans* is a British show that airs on Channel 4 in the U.K. and I believe BBC America in the U.S. (Shoutout to /r/HumansTV!) The premise of the show is that there are synths, which are the equivalent of hosts. The major exception is that they're not designed for entertainment. They're designed for service. They supplant human jobs, both white and blue collar. Although they're used for recreation (e.g. prostitution) too. 

Basically, in *Humans* the synths are slaves. Like *Westworld*, the show centers around the androids obtaining consciousness. 

So, my question is this. In any of the information related to the show is there mention of hosts being employed outside of the park, for labor, or prostitution, or other business purposes? I know we see them used as greeters when guests enter the park. However, it seems that there would be significant market value for their use as essentially a slave race. 

If not, I can't help but wonder of that's the bigger picture of the shareholders. A host race of slaves driving busses, working in factories, doing housework, doing accounting, et cetera, would allow the shareholders to profit from all sectors of the market. 

Note, I am just starting episode 5 right now. So if this was mentioned at all in tonight's episode, well, I haven't finished it yet.  ",westworld,[Question/Speculation/Theory] Hosts outside of Westworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5aande/questionspeculationtheory_hosts_outside_of/

It took three hours from the time of the first report for this spammer to get nuked. There were 15 reports total, and all of them were being brigaded. 

The spammers know that the bot doesn't catch comment spam, at least not if the account has some karma. 

They also know that reddit doesn't, so as far as I've ever seen, go back and nuke their entire history. That means that all of the back links they created get to stay unless users report them to mods. 

After the account gets nuked mods can't go through the history to see how many comments the spammers made. 

There's gotta be a way for this to work better. Maybe if enough ""recognized"" mods make reports. That could be mods with a certain karma threshold, like over 100k, or mods of subs over a certain size, like over 100k, or mods with track records of making legitimate reports. 

Mods might need the ability to see the history of shadowbanned users in order to commence clean-up operations. 

Reddit admins need the ability to nuke a spammer's entire history (if they don't already have that). If they do have it, it should be standard practice if it's not already.

Today we are introducing the Doctor Who Community Discord Server, run by /r/DoctorWho, /r/Gallifrey, and /r/ClassTV. 

### [Click here to join!](https://discord.gg/pq7BaQ4)

----
What is Discord?
---

Discord is a (fairly) new free service that features text and voice channels allowing groups of people to instant message one another and participate in live group chat via text or voice. It also allows users to share images and files very easily and offers multiple discussion channels. 

The best part is that you don't need to download or register for anything to try it out! 

---
How do you intend to use it?
---

The Discord server is for discussing *Doctor Who*, *Class*, Big Finish, and everything else in the Whoniverse with like-minded redditors in IM form, especially during live episode airings. 

We will also be putting on Big Finish nights, where we listen to and comment on a BF audio each week. Currently, these are planned for Sundays 6-8pm.

It also has mod channels for we mighty overlords to pass our dictatorship judgements.

As far as voice channels are concerned, we don't intend to use them as such, but if you want to use them, feel free.

---
But is there enough interest? Won't it just die over time?
---

Possibly, but not for a long while, we hope. At the very least the mods will be about, so there will always be, for the foreseeable future, someone around to chat with (although they may not reply instantly). In fact, we've been testing it with just the mods for the past several weeks, and the chat is already lively.

---
Compatible platforms?
---

Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc). Also downloadable on Windows 7+, OSX 10.10+, iOS 7.1+ and Android 4.1+. Also available for Linux but they call it a beta still (works fine for me!).

---
Ehhhh....What other subs use it?
---

LOTS! Examples include: Most of the TV subs (all of DC and MCU, /r/TheWalkingDead), Games (/r/PS4, /r/oculus, /r/runescape, /r/Starcraft), /r/OutoftheLoop, /r/Android. I also launched the /r/Plex Community server a few months ago which has gone fantastic!

---
Cool! How do I join?
---

### [Click here](https://discord.gg/pq7BaQ4)

Simply follow the instructions. Don't forget to register or else your username may be made available for other people. If you're already on another Discord server, you can just join immediately if you're signed in and be on multiple servers easily.

As the title says, I just got done cataloging all of gaming magazines. They're mostly retro. Some are modern. 

A few are from when I was a kid that I've managed to hang on to. Although most of those were lost in various moves. I miss the stack of Next Gen that I had. 

I worked at GameStop from 2000-2002, so I had a ton of magazines from those years since we tossed them out when the next issue came in. Had a complete set of OCDM. 

There's a stack of EGMs from 2006. Not sure where those came from. Probably were handed out at E3.

I couldn't figure out how to get it to work in the game. So I ran out today and bought Lethal Enforcers II to test it out. 

Here's the result. 

The fire button and the start button on the gun both work. 

When I pull the fire button the screen flashes as expected, but the gun doesn't register it. 

When I shoot at a light bulb it does register. 

The television I'm using is a 36"" Sony Trinitron. Standard definition. 4:3 ratio. CRT. The glass is flat and not rounded. 

I've messed with the picture settings on the TV and still can't get it to work. 

The TV works fine with my NES Zapper and Master System Phaser. It also works fine with my SNES Super Scope and Sega Menacer, but I realize those are different technologies. 

So, is my gun broken, not compatible with my television, or are there any suggestions on how to adjust the picture settings to help it work?

You could win **FIVE** retro vinyl decals from /r/RetroBattlestations and a $10 Amazon gift certificate from us at /r/retrogaming!

What do you need to do to enter? Post a picture or video of your favorite Halloween or ""spooky"" game on your favorite platform. What's a spooky game? That would be any kind of game that has a main theme focused on horror or the paranormal. It doesn't have to be a game meant to be scary, silly or cheesy spooky games are fine too.

Entries will be ranked based on several categories, including:

* How unique: both the game and the platform will be considered
* How great of an achievement: level or score reached 
* Effort and presentation: based on the atmosphere and spookiness including Halloween props and lighting

So, here are some tips to winning. Post games not posted yet. Post stuff from platforms not posted yet. Be as creative as possible. Pics, gifs, videos, it's all good. 

At the end of the month whichever sub has the best overall score will be declared the winning subreddit and the grand prizes from both subs will be awarded to the person from the winning who submits the highest ranked post in the winning sub.

Whether or not there is a grand prize winner from /r/retrogaming, the runner up will get some reddit gold. 

**Entry Rules:**

1. Spooky Month is from October 1st to October 31st. All posts within this time period will qualify. 

2. To participate in the contest you need to [make a new post to /r/retrogaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/submit) of a picture, video, or gif that you shot for this contest of a spooky game. 

2. Put ""CONTEST 6"" in the title of your post. If you forget this, send us a modmail and we'll flair your post. 

3. Make sure **your reddit username** and ***the date*** (like, written on a sticky note or a piece of paper or something), and the entire machine are visible in the picture. If you’re submitting an entire album please make sure the verification photo is first. 

4. No pictures of just the screen. Posts must include the gaming machine. 

5. **No emulators**. 

Posts that don't meet these criteria will be disqualified. 

You are welcome to submit multiple entries which will count towards the overall score for the sub, however each redditor will only be entered into the contest once.

In an effort to change that, I wanted to ask our community members some questions. The best answers (or maybe all of them) will be used in a feature on /r/SubredditOfTheDay. 

Here's what I've got.

1. What do you like most about this community?

2. If you could pick five games for a person to try out who has never played an Xbox, what would they be and why?

3. Do you still play your Xbox online? (If yes, tell us about the experience.) 

4. Have you ever had to repair or replace your Xbox? What about modding it? (If yes, why, what happened, what was the outcome.)

5. What do you think a new user will immediately notice about /r/OriginalXbox?

6. What are your favorite posts on this sub?

Ys, that's right, thr ar mor than 3,000 popl on rddit who want to liminat th lttr that coms btwn ""D"" and ""F."" 

What did th fifth lttr do to dsrv to b shunnd? Th argumnt is that it's unncssary. Words work just fin without th lttr. Popl hav bn saying that about ""Z"" for a whil, though, and it's still hr, and for obvious rasons I am fond of it. :)

Rally, though, /r/AVoid5 was cratd in rspons to /r/-mbold-nth--, a subrddit that glorifis th unnamd lttr. 

What can you do for th caus?

But it started out trying really hard to get things right, hiring expert consultants and such. 

I think there were also some mistakes the show made; putting a wedge between Leo and Bartlet and reducing John Spencer's role comes to mind. 

But the entire space station storyline, from start to finish, drives me crazy. It drove me crazy back when it aired, and rewatching the show now it makes me even more crazy. First of all, there's no place on Earth where a military shuttle could be launched without being detected, and then it's not like people can't see objects that size in LEO. Second of all, the ISS has always had a Soyuz for emergency crew return. Third, the way they completely ruined Toby's character with it. 

I just got to *Things Fall Apart* in my latest rewatch, and it feels like the show is falling apart at this point.

I finally got it for what I feel is a reasonable price ($180) and it's [super mint](http://i.imgur.com/FViYb6V.jpg). I was really hesitant to pull the trigger on it because I had never heard of it when it came out. Last year I bought *Guardian Heroes*, which is another pricey Saturn game, and I turned out to not really like it, so I sold it. I am a collector, but I mostly collect games I play and enjoy. So I did my research on it and eventually pulled the trigger when I found a copy I liked. This is a late release U.S. Saturn game (1997), and obviously not all that popular, so that means it's on the uncommon side. Fortunately, the demand for the game isn't super high. It is more common in Japan where it's called *Torico* and came out a year sooner. But unless you speak Japanese, it's probably not playable because it's very dialog heavy. 

I am a big fan of adventure games. The atmosphere, exploration, [puzzle solving](http://i.imgur.com/fr160aD.jpg), I love it. In fact, *D* is a favorite of mine, and this game gets compared to *D* often. The comparison is apt. *Lunacy* is an adventure game on rails that uses pre-rendered graphics. The game starts out by giving you amnesia and dropping you in an unfamiliar place. It's up to you to figure out what to do. 

The game is [two discs](http://i.imgur.com/1Bc0l2P.jpg). It's kinda disappointing that the disc art is the same. I always feel like that's a missed opportunity. Anyways, each disc is almost like a different game. The first disc is all about the City of Mists, which has no mist, and that's part of the plot. You'll spend a lot of time exploring, finding characters, and talking to them. The town layout is very confusing. It's so confusing, in fact, that either developer System Sacom or publisher Atlas decided to include a [map](http://i.imgur.com/QaqGtFJ.jpg). Would you look at that map for the City of Mists? It's microscopic. There's all that unused white space that could've been better utilized by, you know, having a useful map. Fortunately, someone on GameFAQs made a much more readable ASCII map. The town is actually really small. There's not a whole lot there, so you'll go back and forth a few times. What will get you lost is the fact that when you come out of a street and onto an new one, you might not be facing the same way as you were before. Also, the intersections look a lot alike. There are few visual landmarks. I focused a lot on following the map after wandering around on my own for a while. 

The town doesn't have a lot of characters. IIRC there are seven, and four of them are always in pairs. So you spend a lot of time going back and forth between them figuring out what you need to to do next, hence heavy reliance on the map. The thing that frustrated me the most is that some of the event triggers to move the game forward are not obvious. In one part in particular you have to talk to a character who has never previously left her house in a place where there's never been a character before. She delivers some really unimportant dialog and then you can proceed. This is despite the fact that you can do a lot of stuff out of order, so by this point I had already figured out what I needed and where I needed to go, but I spent a lot of time going all over the place trying to figure out why I couldn't advance until I stumbled on this interaction. 

Disc 2 is the City of Moons, and without giving much away it's a mystical realm, whereas the City of Mists is the physical world. The City of Moons is much cooler. You travel around to different towers to unlock each puzzle. One of my favorite thing about this is that most every tower has puzzle within a puzzle. The first thing you need to do is figure out how to progress, but all of your ""friends"" from the town are trapped here. Going forward with the game will kill them. Or you can figure out how to save them before moving on. I really like that choice. In one instance I killed someone because I wasn't thinking. Let me give you an example, though. There's a scene where you need to get through a door, but it's turned one of the townspeople to stone. The game also gives you a sword. The guy says he's lived a full life (because even as a statue he can still talk) and that's it's okay to bash through him, killing him. I did find the way to return him to flesh and save him. 

To make things easier, when you walk the paths between each of the towers (see the black lines on the map) you run at like super speeds. Sometimes it does that up and down stairs. It's weird that it doesn't happen at a walking pace, but when you're going back and forth you'll be thankful for it. I found myself wishing that it was also a feature from Disc 1. The other thing is there are these painting that are one way portals. Some you have to use, some you don't. Finally, all of the towers are color coded so you know where you are. Earth tower, silver tower, water tower, et cetera. 

As I said above, I did my research before buying it. One of the contemporary reviews praised the quality of the voice acting. You and I both know that voice acting in 90s games was usually stiff and awful. From scene one, *Lunacy* is no exception, but it was adequate. The script could've been westernized a little better, though. 

I played the game in one sitting over five or six hours. I was getting bored and almost put it down after the first disc, but the City of Moons really picked up the pace. You can save and exit pretty much at any point, which is always nice. 

When I think about playing it over again, I probably will one day. I can get it done faster now that I've done it once, but I am in no hurry. There is some added replay value designed into the game. If you save everyone in the City of Moons then after you beat the game you'll get cut scenes with them back in the City of Mists. 

Since I started this out comparing the game to *D*, I'll say that I don't find it as unique, or as charming, and that the atmosphere isn't quite as immersive. I still like it though. If I had to rate it on a scale of 1-10 it would probably be somewhere around a seven. Still, especially when considering the price, this game is more for dedicated Saturn collectors and fans of old school adventure games. 

I'll wish I took pics throughout the game. I didn't. But I'll leave you with these two shots, which I thought were funny.

",gamecollecting,I recently picked up Lunacy for Saturn. Here's a look at it and my review.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/51rbok/i_recently_picked_up_lunacy_for_saturn_heres_a/
1548,2016-09-08 13:35:30+00:00,self.SegaSaturn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SegaSaturn/comments/51rbjq/i_recently_picked_up_lunacy_heres_a_look_at_it/,False,"*Lunacy* has been on my radar for about a year now. I finally got it for what I feel is a reasonable price ($180) and it's [super mint](http://i.imgur.com/FViYb6V.jpg). I was really hesitant to pull the trigger on it because I had never heard of it when it came out. Last year I bought *Guardian Heroes*, which is another pricey Saturn game, and I turned out to not really like it. So I did my research on it and eventually pulled the trigger when I found a copy I liked. This is a late release U.S. Saturn game (1997), and obviously not all that popular, so that means it's on the uncommon side. Fortunately, the demand for the game isn't super high. It is more common in Japan where it's called *Torico* and came out a year sooner. But unless you speak Japanese, it's probably not playable because it's very dialog heavy. 

I am a big fan of adventure games. The atmosphere, exploration, [puzzle solving](http://i.imgur.com/fr160aD.jpg), I love it. In fact, *D* is a favorite of mine, and this game gets compared to *D* often. The comparison is apt. *Lunacy* is an adventure game on rails that uses pre-rendered graphics. The game starts out by giving you amnesia and dropping you in an unfamiliar place. It's up to you to figure out what to do. 

The game is [two discs](http://i.imgur.com/1Bc0l2P.jpg). It's kinda disappointing that the disc art is the same. I always feel like that's a missed opportunity. Anyways, each disc is almost like a different game. The first disc is all about the City of Mists, which has no mist, and that's part of the plot. You'll spend a lot of time exploring, finding characters, and talking to them. The town layout is very confusing. It's so confusing, in fact, that either developer System Sacom or publisher Atlas decided to include a [map](http://i.imgur.com/QaqGtFJ.jpg). Would you look at that map for the City of Mists? It's microscopic. There's all that unused white space that could've been better utilized by, you know, having a useful map. Fortunately, someone on GameFAQs made a much more readable ASCII map. The town is actually really small. There's not a whole lot there, so you'll go back and forth a few times. What will get you lost is the fact that when you come out of a street and onto an new one, you might not be facing the same way as you were before. Also, the intersections look a lot alike. There are few visual landmarks. I focused a lot on following the map after wandering around on my own for a while. 

The town doesn't have a lot of characters. IIRC there are seven, and four of them are always in pairs. So you spend a lot of time going back and forth between them figuring out what you need to to do next, hence heavy reliance on the map. The thing that frustrated me the most is that some of the event triggers to move the game forward are not obvious. In one part in particular you have to talk to a character who has never previously left her house in a place where there's never been a character before. She delivers some really unimportant dialog and then you can proceed.

About halfway through season five the lack of Sorkin really takes hold. I never really liked the Bingo Bob story, that Will left to work for him, or that Sam's departure was never explained, and those are just a few of the minor issues I have with the post-Sorkin era, but with this episode what irks me is that Toby, Josh, and CJ never put it together that Bob was the leaker. Since they don't like or trust Bob, they would've looked at him before Will would have. And if they looked, they'd of seen it. Just one of the smaller ways that the characters were diminished through new writing.

* Box – top

http://i.imgur.com/dLD0xLk.jpg

Chaotic Cube was released in the United States in 1970. It was licensed by the Pacific Game Company from Nintendo, who had released it a year earlier in Japan as Challenge Dice. It was also known as Puzzle Dice.

* Anyone can take it apart... that's easy...

http://i.imgur.com/kxfoSSU.jpg

I think they look rather handsome.

* Game
http://i.imgur.com/xxZkJFN.jpg

Okay, so here's how the game works. There are four kinds of pegs of varying length and color. The idea is to get them all in the cube at once. The inside of the dice is hollow and the pegs take up space, so the trick is to put them all in so they fit.
* Whoops
http://i.imgur.com/15xpBrd.jpg

It's not as challenging as a Rubik's Cube, but I do wish I had taken a pic before I took it all apart the first time. It looks rather silly when you don't get it right.

We also see the Nintendo branding on the game itself.

#Roulette

http://i.imgur.com/jRR77LY.jpg

In the 60s and 70s Nintendo made a few versions of roulette.

* Roulette #250 and Logo

http://i.imgur.com/80QuenA.jpg

Judging by the logo used and the font, I am gonna guess this was made between 1965 and 1970.

* Inside the box

http://i.imgur.com/FSOMYtJ.jpg

The NG ""Nintendo Games"" logo was also used around 1965.

* out of the box

http://i.imgur.com/ctIQd6K.jpg

The roulette game itself is a plastic box in two pieces.

* Game open

http://i.imgur.com/NysA7hx.jpg

Taking off the top part with the spinner wheel reveals the chips, instructions, and board.

* Board

http://i.imgur.com/vZ3haKU.jpg

It's a pretty big board for such a small box.

* Instructions 

http://i.imgur.com/D8AMcs7.jpg

Not sure what region this was released in, but I was surprised to see that the instructions are totally in English.

*  Chips 
http://i.imgur.com/lOxUUi2.jpg

I guess it's no surprise that all of the chips have a big N on them.

#Playing Cards

http://i.imgur.com/5pGFK5T.jpg

I had to grab a pack of Nintendo playing cards... for reasons.

* Cards

http://i.imgur.com/OD0XPZZ.jpg

I am not sure what year these were made. Judging by the logo anywhere between 1965 and 2006 is possible. They're not the rarer ones made in the end of the 19th century or beginning of the 20th, but these all plastic playing cards are pretty cool.

#A closer look at Nintendo Duck Hunt Kosenju from 1976, a projector-based shooting game

* Box

http://i.imgur.com/CBc1zMF.jpg

When most people think of Nintendo's Duck Hunt they think of a game played on the NES with a Zapper. But long before Nintendo made Famicom, they came out with an electromechanical home game. This version of Duck Hunt was released in Japan in 1976, the same year that Atari was revolutionizing the console market in the U.S. with Home Pong.

* Side of box

http://i.imgur.com/Z6KAJjU.jpg

I don't know what any of this says, but there is some writing on the box's flap.

* Box open

http://i.imgur.com/mGcPhhm.jpg

Inside the box there are three things, the projector, the gun in two parts, and the instructions. There's also this little tag, but again, I have no idea what it says.


* Instructions 

http://i.imgur.com/LRvfxYR.jpg

This version of the game came from Caracas, so they're all in Spanish. Fortunately, there are pictures. Also, it's all pretty self-explanatory.

* Gun

http://i.imgur.com/UTL0mLo.jpg

The rifle comes in two pieces and assembles by snapping it together.

* Inside the gun

http://i.imgur.com/DjVhbLP.jpg

The clear thing on the top is the flash. This wasn't working when I first got it, but I was able to get it to work by cleaning some contacts. that's why I took it apart. Since I already did that, I figured I'd post a pic.  It still needs some work, but I don't think there's anything catastrophically wrong with it.

* Ammo

http://i.imgur.com/tqXt9ip.jpg


The gun runs on two C batteries that are inserted into the stock of the gun.


* Rifle Assembled 

http://i.imgur.com/R1Plbbk.jpg

It's a lot shorter than I expected. But it still looks pretty cool. It's like a sawed off shotgun.


* Copyright 

http://i.imgur.com/avpUyF2.jpg

Below the barrel of the gun we see the 1976 copyright. Funnily, I couldn't locate any identifying marks from Nintendo on the actual projector.

* Projector 

http://i.imgur.com/YSE4OtJ.jpg

Here's the projector. The mirror looks cooked. That's because it moves. Light comes out of the base, goes through a lens, and then the mirror tilts and rotates to make the ducks fly.

* Side view

http://i.imgur.com/XKcWxGk.jpg

And here's the side profile of the machine.

* Power

http://i.imgur.com/Jz918iQ.jpg

The Projector is powered by four D batteries. I happen to have some other games that take D size batteries, so I had a few on hand.

* How it works

http://i.imgur.com/nyFaulr.png

I tried and failed to get a good pic of the inside of the projector in action. It has a lot of gears and such, so I decided against taking it all apart. Besides, it does appear to function perfectly. Anyways, I wanted to show something, so I went to uspto.gov and looked up the patent. These diagrams show how the mechanical parts inside the projector simulate a duck flying. The patent number is listed, so anyone can go pull the full document for more cool diagrams.

* Peering into the projector 
http://i.imgur.com/vn4dWF8.jpg

I told you I could not get a cool pic of this. But what we see down there is a white disc. That's the part shown in the previous sketch. It's what makes the duck fly. I believe the little black square on top is the light sensor that senses the flash from the gun. The gun just produces a light. It's not wired or anything. So the console detects a hit when the light from the gun detects the flash bouncing back into it. When that happens it makes a quack sound and then plays an animation of a duck falling.

* Still peering into the projector 

http://i.imgur.com/6oKLtBS.jpg

I tried to take a pic while it was on. I told you it didn't turn out well.

* In Action 

http://i.imgur.com/wfCMOuV.jpg

Speaking of photos not turning out well, I could not get a clear shot of the duck in flight. It just looks like a blob of light here because it doesn't hold still and my phone's camera couldn't focus in time. Trust me though, it really looks like a duck!

* In action 

http://i.imgur.com/X1JCC4F.gifv

I decided to do a little video to make a gif out of the game in action. This is just two duck paths out of many. The patterns are designed to appear as if they're random. I also cut out the time in between the ducks flying. 


#Nintendo CTG-BK6

* Box

http://i.imgur.com/644BCNu.jpg

The Nintendo CTG-BK 6 is a first generation console in Nintendo's 1970s line of 'Color TV Game' systems. These were only released in Japan. Nintendo's primary competitor was Bandai's popular TV Jack line.


* Side of the box

http://i.imgur.com/uM3y2Xz.jpg

was pretty happy when I got home from school and saw a package from Japan sitting by my front door. I ordered this months ago. I get a lot of stuff from Japan on eBay. Usually it's fine. But I had a lot of problems with this seller. I was just relieved the system was here. 

I really want a Color TV Game-6, which is Nintendo's first console, but it's just nice to have just one model from their first generation line.

* Box Open

http://i.imgur.com/cwGvUOQ.jpg

I really want a Color TV Game-6, which is Nintendo's first console, but it's just nice to have just one model from their first generation line. I am also happy that the box is in a lot better shape than I had expected.

* Console outside of box 

http://i.imgur.com/vKOvNYX.jpg

My first reaction upon opening this was ""yuck."" Handling it turned my hands black. 

It was still cool holding a Nintendo console from 1979 that was designed, in part, by Shigeru Miyamoto.

* Console only 

http://i.imgur.com/mlMqZrf.jpg

The ""6"" in CTG-BK 6 represents the six built-in games. CTG stands for ""Color TV Game."" And I am pretty sure that the ""BK"" stands for ""blocks."" 

This is a ""pong"" console. Like all first generation consoles, it plays dedicated games that are on a chip. *Well, there are very few exceptions to that rule. In this case, it plays six variations of what is essentially Breakout. This is one of many Breakout clones from the 70s and 80s.

If you look to the right, you'll see the original reusable zip tie that came with it. It's also pictured on the front of the box. Why are these not used?! So much better than disposable twist ties. Sheesh.  

* Close up of controls

http://i.imgur.com/LI7qSQh.jpg

From left to right. The first thing is a ""serve"" button. This serves the ball to get the game going or to bring it back into play if you miss it. Then there's the power switch. The red button is the reset button. You need to push it when you change games. The first switch selects the games. You can see a chart below of the brick configuration of each game. Also, the rules are a little different in some of the later games. But the first three are typical breakout fare. Next is a switch that selects the number of ball per round. Finally, there's the knob that is used to control the paddle on screen.

* Back of console

http://i.imgur.com/GQo7nu0.jpg

To the left you can see the protruding video cable. It is the same thing as we had in the U.S. during the first and second+ generations. There's also a switch on the bottom that selects between channel 1 and 2. Then, of course, is the serial number and such.

* TV-Game Switch

http://i.imgur.com/3gRJt65.jpg

So, fuck. The seller showed a pic of the game switch and power supply in the auction, but didn't ship it. It took almost three months for this to get here, so I am not holding my breath on getting the missing items. Here I am going to use a standard TV/Game Switch with a 300 to 75 Ohm Matching Transformer. This is my preferred set up. In fact, it's always back there. A lot of people prefer to side-step the box altogether and use a Coaxial (F-type) to Female RCA Adapter. But for reasons, I like it this way.

* Power Supply

http://i.imgur.com/J8QhSVA.jpg

I just mentioned that the seller forgot to ship me the power supply. But after some quick google-fu I found a helpful YouTube comment that said that the power supply from my very first console works great. This, of course, is the Model 1 Genesis power adapter.

* Inside

http://i.imgur.com/gdAYCK8.jpg

I took the back off. People familiar with my albums know that I don't usually do things like this. So why? Because I got a picture, I could move the paddle, but the serve and reset buttons did nothing. I figure either there's a lose wire or a dirty contact, or something is spilled inside of it considering the exterior condition. 

I was able to immediately mess with the screw things to get better picture, which was nice.

* Removing the main board

http://i.imgur.com/wYunl4Q.jpg

After checking connections on the main board I determined that everything was okay. Two screws removed it and exposed the back of the control board.

* Removing the control board

http://i.imgur.com/fBcvIvJ.jpg

After removing the control board there was one immediate problem. The little rubber thing that makes the reset button contact the board was sideways. I figured that was that, put it all back together, and... Nope. Still no serve. So I took it all apart and looked at the control board's contacts. Super dirty. Nothing a pink eraser couldn't fix.

* 95

http://i.imgur.com/GsyZfWG.jpg

For reasons that are widely available on the internet, but that I don't care to learn, channel 1 and 2 on a Japanese console equates to channels 95 and 96 in the U.S. I got a better picture on 95, so that's what I am using here.

* Games

http://i.imgur.com/xjfwlzZ.jpg

The following pics will be of a few of the games that are on the system. This is game 3, just because that's what I played first.

* Game 1

http://i.imgur.com/VOrXjqi.jpg
Basic Breakout.


* Game 2

http://i.imgur.com/uE2F1QF.jpg

* Game 4

http://i.imgur.com/X3ehEAD.jpg

* Game 6 

http://i.imgur.com/zFg3KHS.jpg

I have no idea of the rules of this. Well, kind of an idea. I couldn't find a good FAQs. If someone has a link, please share. I thought I had a pic of game 5, but whatever. It's just more breakout, y'all.

* In action

http://i.imgur.com/vIODdyH.gifv

I took a crappy phone video, but at least I am not an idiot this time and held it sideways like you're supposed to when shooting video. I sped this up about 200 percent to make it fit in under 15 seconds. 

You can't hear it, but the console has bloops and bleeps. Those are entirely drowned out by the fact that this console picks up the local classic rock station. So the soundtrack I am playing to here is ""Start Me Up"" by The Rolling Stones. 

Seriously, this console either has no shielding, or someone removed it from mine before I bought it. it needs some.

* The Manual 

http://i.imgur.com/SjWwBre.jpg

At least I have a manual in very nice condition. Let's look inside, K? K.

* I like this 

http://i.imgur.com/Fsk3w3q.jpg

On the last page there's an illustration that, I am pretty sure, is telling you the right ways to hold this. Thought I'd think that A) is still showing the wrong ways too. But there's no upside down one, so it's throwing me off. 

Edit: Turns out this is instructions for left-handed players. Being a lefty myself, I find this to be silly. It's much easier to just use my left hand on the paddle with the console facing forward. Then left is left and right is right.


* TV Color Games

http://i.imgur.com/FTXHY1N.jpg

The 6 is the first one that Nintendo made. The 15 adds more modes of play. This is also the first time Nintendo made a controller. The 112 just looks awesome.

* My favorite thing 

http://i.imgur.com/zX9QaLR.jpg

I absolutely adore stuff like this. It really adds to the piece for me. It doesn't add to the value. It's just something I really enjoy finding. 

The original owner taped the receipt to the warranty page of the manual. I wonder if it says do to that? 

Anyways, this was originally purchased on December 17, 1979 for 10,500 yen. In my head I imagine that it was a Christmas gift for a child who would be very excited to play this new Nintendo game. 

If anyone who's curious, 10,500 yen is about $92.50 USD. Adjusted for inflation... that's about $302 today. :)

* Cleaning 

http://i.imgur.com/RCJ8nB7.jpg

There's a lot of case damage. It looks like the power cord may have been wrapped around it and melted. I am using window cleaner right now and have already made a lot of progress. I have a lot more work to do to clean this up properly. That's all for now!

#Nintendo Game &amp; Watch - 1980

http://i.imgur.com/nF44JNq.jpg

Nintendo began producing Game &amp; Watch games in 1980 as LCD technology began to become more and more affordable. Their first one was called ""Ball."" Pictured is the 1982 releases of Donkey Kong. It's the second Game &amp; Watch game to use two screens. But it's the first game in history to use a d-pad.

---

That’s all I got for today. I hope you enjoyed this pics and descriptions. 

Oh yeah, and mods asked me to say where I got this all from. eBay. All of it.

There's an article about After Burner on 32X. The writer says he knows a lot of people who would pass on the nearly arcade perfect conversion, and suggested that Sega should port the following games:

* Galaxy Force
* Stadium Cross
* Power Drift 
* Golden Axe: Revenge of Deathaddler 
* Super Hang-On 
* Spiderman (arcade)
* Outrunners 
* Super Monaco
* Arabian Fight

For me, *Wing War* is the game I would've liked to have seen. It's a Model 1 arcade game like Virtua Fighter, Star Wars Arcade, and Virtua Racing. I think it could've really been a killer app for 32X.

Some subs, like /r/gentlemanboners, have it styled so that when you're typing the title it capitalizes each letter. Others, like /r/PeopleBeingJerks have it styled so it's all caps when you're typing. 

Since it doesn't actually post like that, this makes it extremely annoying when you're typing out the title. You gotta turn off CSS when posting on a lot of subs to make sure your capitalization is right. 

But if you're xposting from one sub to another it'll keep that title formatting. So you gotta redo your title if you kept the CSS on. 

On subs I mod, and I suspect this is the case with many subs, we didn't even know that the CSS affects the title box text/font. On /r/subredditoftheday it's almost impossible to input a title with the CSS turned on because of the color that our CSS changes the title font to. 

As a mod and as a user, it'd be just super easy if reddit went back to not styling the title box text and font.

This probably isn't stable, but it serves to illustrate the idea I had. 

I've always wondered how people in the world of Westeros can never know the seasons. 

We know that the known world is probably just the norther hemisphere of either the east or west hemisphere of their planet. Or at least it could be. 

http://i.imgur.com/QaC4z8x.png

Essos would relate to Asia, Westeros to Europe, Southoryos to norther Africa, and Ulhtos could be part of either Essos or Southoryos, or its own thing. But this is just the northern part of one hemisphere. What's missing from this map is the ""White Waste"" that's north of the Shivering Sea. It's described to have what we know as an aurora. So we know it's the north pole. 

However, I guess [this](http://i.imgur.com/Hj97djS.png) could be the actual map. So they could be in the southern hemisphere, but it's easier to assume that north means north. 

So in the solar system diagram I have five things labeled. 

* Star - This is the center of the solar system.
* World - This is ""The World"" that contains Westeros, it's really a natural satellite of gas giant.
* Gas Giant - A planet that the world of Westeros orbits.
* Moon - We know that the world of Westeros has at least one moon, but it's really a moon of the gas giant, and it orbits both its planet and Westeros.
* Sun - A companion star the the star at the center of this solar system. From the Westerosi perspective, this is the sun. 

How I imagine this is that ""The World"" is tidally locked with its planet. The hemisphere that Westeros lies on always faces away from both the planet and the central star. 

The ""sun,"" which is really a more distant companion star, is the only star seen from Westeros. Its long and somewhat eccentric orbit, combined with the orbit of the planet that ""The World"" orbits, makes it difficult for inhabitants to predict the length of seasons; that combined with some poor records and little science. It's not that the seasons are altogether unpredictable, but the technology and scientific knowledge to do so doesn't exist. 

We also know that east Essos contains the Shadow Lands and the city of  Asshai. The shadows cast are not from mountains, but from the planet that ""The World"" is tidally locked to. Half of the world would never seen any sun. 

Okay, that's my hypothesis. Is it at all plausible?

Feel free to knock it down now.

**9,868** *subscribers* for **about a month!**

First of all, that's impressive growth. Just saying. Right?  Knowing the subreddit's origins explains why. The sub began shortly after [this album](http://imgur.com/a/k5I6M) became a popular post in /r/pics. As is tradition, one user had the idea that there should be a subreddit dedicated to this concept, and [yet another](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4mw1pu/the_flooding_in_paris_today_compared_to_the_great/d3ytzvx) suggested a name for such a sub. 

A reply to a top comment on a rising thread being a surefire way to get upvotes and attention on the front page, it wasn't long before /u/nowheredust seized the moment and created it. (A redditor after my own heart!) Overnight a reddit community was born, with new posts and thousands of subscribers. The next day it would be trending. 

There are three basic kinds of submissions to be found here. The first is similar to the post that started it all, [people holding up old photographs in the actual locations where they were originally taken](http://i.imgur.com/Yt9pVDY.jpg). The second type is something created by Photoshop wizards, [where an old photograph is blended with a modern one in the same location](http://imgur.com/QfMdJlS), leading to a remarkable ghostly effect.  The third type is more simple, [a side-by-side comparison of a photo taken in the past and one taken recently](http://imgur.com/a/uhbuM). 

This is a remarkable young subreddit, with a large user-base and an amazing premise. It represents the best of reddit's creativity and abilities to organically form communities around new ideas. It is truly deserving of the title ""Subreddit of the Day.""

On behalf of the mod team I'd like to thank everyone who has been doing an amazing job of keeping this sub filled with new content on a daily basis. [This gif's for you!](http://www.gfycat.com/EagerVagueKawala)

This sub is the brilliant idea of /u/DanyalEscaped. So we should all thank him for coming up with it. 

For everyone who is new here coming from the trending thread, here's what we're about: 

Our subreddit is basically what /r/news would be like if this were 1916. It's for news that happened or was published exactly 100 years ago to the day. So, for example, today will be all about the events of June 27th, 1916. 

There's a lot going on in the world in 1916. There's kind of a big war raging in Europe, America is in the midst of a presidential election, and there's the threat of war looming between the U.S. and Mexico. It's not all ""big event"" kind of stuff. Just yesterday (-100 years) *The New York Times* reported that kerosene will be the alternative fuel of the future and will cut fuel costs. Also, horseshoe fitters are losing business. Oh yeah, and there's a conflict in Ireland that's threatening to tear the U.K. apart. 


If you're interested in participating in our sub, feel free to comment or submit photos or articles from 100 years ago. 

It can be challenging to find content from exactly 100 years ago to post, so here are three strategies that I like to use. 

1. A lot of newspapers have online archives going back over 100 years. Those are great for headlines. They usually publish the previous day's news, but that's okay to post. 
2. A google image search of the date can frequently turn up some interesting results. 
3. You can use the google news search function to set the date back exactly 100 years. 

If anyone has questions I'd be happy to answer them here. And we welcome everyone to the community! Thanks again to our regular posters. This sub is nothing without you!

The game is a glitchy, low res Minecraft-esque shooter with a very bad frame rate. In the game a whole team of people play online in a very, very tiny arena. A giant spawns and is basically harmless, and everyone shoots at it. It's like shooting a wall. For every shot players earn $3 in in-game money. 

If someone told anyone the idea for this game in... say... 1997, it would be regarded as one of the worst ideas ever. But now it's profitable. 

That's when it dawned on me that as time passes the worse the idea is the more profitable it will become. A bad idea today is the future's cash cow. I am gonna call this ""Zadoc's law.""  

Twitter is a good example. Think back 16 years. If someone said the next big website would be a forum to send 140 character SMS texts on the internet it would be laughed at. Today it's valued at around $10 billion. 

Here's another example: Donald Trump. 

So, what are some other examples of Zadoc's law in action?

**5,338** people *are confused* for **1 month!**

What the fuck, gravity? We learned about you when we were little kids. We know how you're supposed to work. Shit falls down.

Then tell me, why the fuck  [is this dude sitting on a wall](http://i.imgur.com/2urtxKq.jpg)? Have we spotted a person with legit supernatural power?  [This chick is standing on one!](http://i.imgur.com/TlBjK6U.jpg) I guess walking on walls isn't the greatest super power, but it's better than my super power, which is shitposting on reddit.

Check out  [this gif](http://imgur.com/GILwREU.gifv)). Gravity is so confused that I am seriously confused. Okay, not really. I eventually figured it out. but I was though, for almost a minute!

You never even knew that you wanted to sit on trees until you saw  [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/daraoriordain/19906684270/in/dateposted-public/). Just like you may not have know that gravity could be confusing until you saw this post and found /r/ConfusingGravity. Enjoy.

About us: We report news as it happened exactly 100 years ago to the day. Imagine if reddit existed in 1916. We'd be /r/news. 

Why should you run our ad?

Well, I believe that we represent the very best of the spirit of reddit. We're a community interested in history. Subscribing to /r/100yearsago is the most interesting and interactive way to study and learn about the World War I as it happened. There's also a presidential election coming up too!

These conferences felt like a disappointment. Yes, there are a lot of good games coming out this year. But few are surprises. There wasn't a ton of gameplay shown. Sony is betting on VR. 

The real issue for me is that in the next 18 months there are three consoles that are going to be released, and literally none of them were on display. Not one. 

To me this is a testament to how little faith that Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo have in their current hardware. 

In the past 40 years, the idea of releasing an upgraded console within the same generation is almost unprecedented. This is something that has been planned before (Sega Neptune, Atari Jaguar II), but the only time I can recall it happening was with Channel F, and even then it wasn't graphical updates. 

With Nintendo, the double down on Zelda kind of makes sense considering... But if this hodgepodge of popular game features were called ""Joe's Adventures"" and if it were made by ""Game Studio A"" would anyone even give a little bit of a shit? If it didn't have the names ""Nintendo,"" ""Zelda,"" and ""Miyamoto"" would it even stand out as a PS4 game? 

Anyway, I am not just disappointed by what was and wasn't shown, but by the general direction of the industry. At least there will be awesome games.

**5,650** gamers *gaming* for **7 years!**

Last May a group of mods from across multiple gaming subreddits joined together to re-launch /r/consoles as a place that is free of the PC vs. console war of words. It's a community where people can come to find the latest news about current generation consoles or even post about their childhood gaming systems. 

/r/consoles is a good mix between /r/gaming and /r/games; a middle ground of sorts. While the community fosters discussion it allow encourages people to share media content. The emphasis is on quality content, not just news. 

**Who is /r/consoles for?**

Every fan of console gaming. From PS4 to Xbox One, From Wii to Wii U, from Atari 2600 to Sega Genesis, from Game Boy to Nintendo 3DS, if you game on consoles this is a subreddit for you. It's all about the love of gaming, not flame wars over which console is the best.

Well, of course. The name of this subreddit is *Accidental* Racism. Not *Intentional* or *Actual* Racism. This sub is for things that are made with innocent intentions but out of context can have the appearance of being racism. 

Let me give two recent examples. 

[This post](http://imgur.com/6tXk8QS) was made earlier. [Here's the report](http://i.imgur.com/NigtRxU.png). No, it's not racist on purpose. But for a person who lives in a culture, like most of the United States, where ""white power"" is well known as a rallying cry for white supremacists, the connection is easily made.

 [Here's another recent post](http://i.imgur.com/kmUjbvt.jpg). And this was the [top comment](http://i.imgur.com/JSbpjTN.png). The Western Union advertising is obviously innocently intended. But it can be misconstrued to mean something else, in this case ownership of an Asian man named Wu. [That's the joke](http://i.imgur.com/U7Ghu2s.gif). This is, at its base, a humor sub. 


On to the rules... 

1. No intentional racism. I think that much should be clear by now. We removed posts that are intentionally racist. Keep that in /r/4chan or /r/ImGoingToHellForThis... or something. If something is actually racist, please report it. Please do not report posts that are actually innocently intended. 


2. This one has been explained already, but our sidebar definition for what content is suited for this sub is, ""Some examples of what accidental racism could be wording that came out wrong, ironic pictures, or something that just didn't come out like expected.""   

3. It doesn't have to be accidental racism, it can be accidental sexism, ageism, or or any other kind of ism. Please don't report posts that are some other kind of accidental thing. 

4. Just don't repost within 90 days. No big. Hasn't been an issue. 

5. Mark stuff NSFW. Also, no big. Also hasn't been an issue. And, of course, mods can flag it if a user forgets. 

6. Here's a big one, do not complain  that in some contexts the accidental racism is innocent or tenuous. We know. It's *accidental*. Leave that to /r/iamverysmart. On almost every single post we remove comments pointing out that the post isn't actually racist. No duh. We don't allow actually racist stuff. It's like people don't understand what sub they are on. We remove these comments when we see them. If you see them, please report them. If you don't get how a thing can be racist in a certain light, it's okay to ask. That's no problem. I don't get all if it when I first see a post either. A lot of times I end up googling for the context. 

Alright, that's it. The main thing is that content here isn't actually racist and is only racist via accident, and please don't complain that posts aren't really racist. I mean, see the title of this suberddit. ",AccidentalRacism,A note about this sub.

#All Flairs 

http://i.imgur.com/wSBc9O5.png


#Console Flairs

http://i.imgur.com/5HadypX.png

Your top five favorite consoles are:

1. SNES
2. NES
3. Nintendo 64
4. PlayStation
5. Genesis/Mega Drive

Changes since last time:

In January, and in every other report previously, the favorite was NES. /r/SNES is the largest subreddit in our network that's dedicated to a single platform, so it makes sense that it finally took the lead. 

I thought about it, and I decided to classify Virtual Boy as a console. Previously it was classified as a handheld. What it really is is a tabletop console. There are two other tabletops that we track, AdvetureVision and Vectrex, and we put those in consoles, so it made sense to throw Virtual Boy in here too. It's not really portable, the suggestion that it is is as true as cake.  

#Computer Flairs

http://i.imgur.com/M88oIgf.png

Your top five favorite computer platforms are:

1. DOS
2. Windows
3. Commodore 64
4. Amiga
5. ZX Spectrum

The list is the same as last check, except Atari 8-bit moved up a place and into a tie with Apple II. 

#Handheld Flairs

http://i.imgur.com/Nbi0BZa.png

Your top five favorite handhelds are:

1. Game Boy Advance
2. Game Boy
3. Game Boy Color 
4. Neo Geo Pocket Color
5. Sega Game Gear tied with Tiger Game.com

Changes since January: 

Game Gear was in 6th place last time behind Game.com. Maybe next check it'll bump Game.com out of the top five. Also last time one of you had Atari Lynx flair. This round it's not represented. I guess you changed it or deleted your account. 

#Coin-Op Flairs

http://i.imgur.com/r5kEkkN.png

Changes since January: 

No changes, except four of you picked two flairs in each category. 

#Flair Stats By Company

http://i.imgur.com/zDYDye7.png

Your top five favorite system designers are:

1. Nintendo
2. Sega
3. Sony
4. Microsoft 
5. Atari

Changes since January:

The most notable change is that TurboGrafx fans bumped NEC up from 12th place to 6th. I also removed categories for coin-op and pinball manufactures because it seemed silly to count them in this graph. 

#Flair Stats by System Type

http://i.imgur.com/qj6tRy8.png

No changes here. You greatly prefer consoles, followed by computers at a distant second place, followed more closely by handhelds, with coin-op way, way in last place.  

#Flair By Console Generation 

http://i.imgur.com/3BmcK6U.png

Changes since January: 

Six months ago the fifth generation consoles were your favorite. But before that it was usually the fourth generation, and it's back to normal. It probably helps that most new flair was SNES and that Sega is the second favorite company. The fourth generation actually has a lot of consoles in it, so that helps some. But the second generation has the most and it's down in fourth place. 

One new category was added to this list; ""Paleo Fifth Generation."" This is comprised of Jaguar, 32X, and Virtual Boy. Since a fourth generation console can't natively play a game like Star Wars Arcade, they're definitely not really 4th gen consoles. But since none of these can handle a game like Tomb Raider, they're not really 5th gen either. They're somewhere in between. So I made up a category. 

---

Here's an album of all of the user flair to choose from, complete with a description of which flair represents which system:

http://imgur.com/a/nv6UL 

There are several platforms available that haven't yet been selected. (All of which are better than Game.com.)

If you haven't selected user flair for yourself yet, you can do so by finding your username in the sidebar and clicking the ""edit"" link next to it.

*But I have a flair for PC Engine, Mega Drive, Famicom (etc.) and it's not on this list!*

All of the flairs are combined and listed under the U.S. name. So Famicom becomes NES, and so on. ",retrogaming,/r/retrogaming Flair Stats for the first half of 2016,https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/4nnwl5/rretrogaming_flair_stats_for_the_first_half_of/

This is the Tiger Telematics Gizmondo, a handheld video game console that was released in 2005 and discontinued the next year as  the company and its subsidiary, Gizmondo Europe, spiraled into bankruptcy. 

This is the absolute most spectacular failure in gaming history, bar none. It involved organized crime, money laundering, grand theft auto (the crime, not the game), embezzlement, fraud, impersonating anti-terrorism officials, and more. Wired has a [fantastic article](http://www.wired.com/2006/10/gizmondo/) on all of this. 

I haven't played one of these things since 2005 when I first heard of it at that year's E3. I don't even think Gizmondo had a booth. They just had booth babes walking around in car racing inspired outfits asking people to try it out. My impression of it then was that it felt cheap, and I quickly forgot about the $400 handheld. To be fair, it was only $300 if you got a version that included ads that would be delivered to you via a cell network. What a terrible idea. Besides, the PSP was coming out. It was everywhere at the 2005 E3, and it was pretty damn awesome. Game Boy Micro was also there. And, of course, DS had already been released. I never gave the Gizmondo much of a second thought. And I had no idea of how much money had been sunk into this thing. 

Apparently, the big idea behind Gizmondo was to sell expensive GPS tracking devices to parents. The company figured this would work if the kids wanted the devices, so they put them in a game console. In the UK this thing had a pretty big launch from a media perspective. I guess there was a lot of hype there. Gizmondo had its own version of an Apple store in London. In the U.S. the company couldn't get a single major retailer to carry the thing, and it was sold exclusively from a few mall kiosks. 

The device itself is overly complex, and not very comfortable to hold. The position of the L/R buttons is the worst of any console I've ever played, either on a handheld or controller. They're just elevated way above the unit and need to be a lot lower. It uses the diamond button configuration that was then standard and originally popularized by Nintendo. The d-pad is actually pretty good, and the buttons are stiff and responsive, just the way I like them. 

You'll notice that the buttons aren't labeled as numbers or letters. Instead they are stop, play, back, and fast forward. This is because the device was meant to be an all in one thing that played movies and music. There are also a series of buttons on the top of the system called ""piano keys."" These are for volume, brightness, power, a shortcut the the home screen, and a way to check alerts, which are incoming SMS messages. 

Gizmondo is powered by a version of Microsoft's Windows CE. Movies and music would play in Windows Media Player. There was probably a service to download these over a cell network, but you could also connect the Gizmondo to a pc via an included mini USB cable, or just transfer media to an SD card. I find the operating system to be slow, glitchy, and unresponsive. Apparently there are several homebrew versions of the OS that you can upgrade to. 

Speaking of the OS, it's pretty annoying to operate, too. It has a lot of quirks that make no sense and aren't mentioned in the user manual. For example, I had a hard time figuring out how to turn the thing off. When you press the power button a menu comes up and the ""power off"" button was grayed out. I later discovered that you can't turn the thing off if you have a game inserted or if it's charging. It automatically turns on when it's charging. 

Speaking of charging now, the battery sucks because they had to make it unique to the unit. They're also very hard to come by these days. In fact, you can get a Gizmondo with no battery for pretty cheap, thirty dollars or less. But then good luck with it. You can hack another kind of cellphone battery and Frankenstein it to make it Gizmondo compatible. You also can't turn the device off when you charge it. Plug it in to charge and it'll turn itself on. 

Another really annoying thing about Gizmondo is that you can't use it at all unless you have a SIM card installed. When I first got it to take a charge, which I had a hard time doing, all I got was a no sim card error. I don't usually have extra sim cards laying around. But I knew there was one in my Nokia N-Gage so I used that. Fortunately, it doesn't need to actually connect to a network. It requires a sim card for the ad delivery system, for registration, for GPS, and for sending and receiving text messages. The device also has a camera, so you can send picture attachments as well. 

The games themselves come in DVD cases, but they're just on standard SD cards. Each game comes with an SD card holder, similar to N-Gage. The graphics are somewhere between an N64 and a Dreamcast. I don't know if it could've done better, but I kinda doubt it. It doesn't have any sprawling games, either. Every game is either a sports or a puzzle game. Of the few games I've played, some are pretty good. Trailblazer, for example, is really fun and has nice looking graphics. 

Most of the games were developed by Gizmondo or by companies set up by Gizmondo to make games. But EA actually published a few games on this thing as well. They wouldn't support Dreamcast (because Sega refused to give them sports exclusivity), but you can play SSX 3 and FIFA 2005 on this thing. I am not sure how many releases there actually were. Wikipedia lists 14, but I've seen games for sale not on the list. They could've been completed, but unreleased. It's hard to know because there's really very little information about Gizmondo on the net. The fan forums are all gone and no one owned this thing.  It's reported that there are only 25,000 units. 

The last thing I'll say is that the screen size feels small for this era. My Gizmondo is currently sitting next to my PSP, and the contrast of the wide screen on PSP compared to the Gizmondo's much smaller screen just jumps right out at me. Tiger Telematics did announce a wide screen version just before the U.S. release, but the company went bankrupt faster than they could make a new version. 

If you were ever curious about a Gizmondo, there it is. A disastrous handheld clearly designed by committee with few games that tries to do too many things and isn't very comfortable to hold.

3909,2016-05-21 07:08:18+00:00,self.Nuon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nuon/comments/4kcjz9/programmer_jeff_minter_of_llamasoft_talks_about/,False,"&gt;T3K continues to come along nicely too - Flippers, Fuseballs and Pulsars are all apparent upon the Web now, and the level sequencer is working to the extent where you can launch all the Embryos for a level and it will launch and hatch Embryos at a rate commensurate to the level until they are all gone. Interestingly, I dug up an old interview with Theurer talking about old Tempest, and in it he states that ""the more of an enemy you shoot, the more of that type come out"". This is quite cool, since it means you can't just nail your scariest enemies at the start of the level, because that will engender more. You might have to leave them awhile and avoid them, or risk being overrun with what you fear the most... I will make my sequencer do the same kind of thing, and see how it plays.

&gt;Working on the enemies has inspired me to make more additions to my already overstuffed vector core... objects can now own a CLUT and do endpoint colour loads out of that - although everything is in 32-bit, having a local clut for an object is quite handy, since you can munge the clut in all the trad ways and get nice cycling and pulsing happening within an object much more easily than having to traverse the whole vectorlist and change all the absolute colour loads. The vector stuff looks really yummy... 'specially nice having intensity-interpolation between endpoints, means enemies can have vectors that taper off into nothingness, looks like beams of light coming out of the edge of the enemy... yummy yummy. And, since I moved the shatter stuff inboard into vector core, now when you blow them up they break up into a cloud of tumbling vector-debris. Cool.

&gt;Now I'll be going for finishing off the first few enemies' behaviour routines, getting the level sequencer to initiate level transitions automatically, and getting player deaths happening. At that point there will be something that actually plays in a game-like manner and I will prolly spend a week or two getting the initial balance of gameplay right... the most crucial thing of all... and then I can just get into adding all the 3K extras and goodies, of which there will be precisely one fuckload :-)

&gt;Oh, I love being a videogame designer. I love being a videogame player, too. Ain't life grand sometimes?

&gt;Until next time, goodbye from Flossie, Alastair, Vindy (true curry-hound!) and... the Mighty Gazelle!

&gt;Well... on to better news now. I'm still beavering away on T3K, which continues to look nicer and nicer. I added subpixel accuracy to some of my main graphics routines, with the result that my displays are now even more smooth and unpixelly than ever; I've just put in the Powerups, which rez in in a lovely swirly fashion and look very nice indeed, and the swirly bonus points which are quite similar to the old Pixelshatter effects out of T2K, but with heaps of translucency and smoothness and rotatey stuff, very tasty! I have lots of cool SFX in there too, but unfortunately a lot of them will have to be replaced before the game gets released - I basically borrowed heavily from the MAME sample sets, so you've got everything from Berzerk's robots saying ""Chicken detected in pocket!"" to Space Fury's imperious alien saying ""Warships, dispose of my arse at once!"" (hey, you've got to have a good old play with the sample editor, haven't you?). It's a bit of fun while I'm working on the game; I'm sure we'll get some equally groovy but legal sample sets for the release version. I've also been tweaking at the gameplay (cor, looking at my last update a lot has happened since - you can now get killed, the level transitions are in) - particularly on the firing, which needed to be speeded up to make the gameplay properly Tempest-like. One neat little thing I have added in there is that you can steal the enemy's shots! You know how in Tempest there is always a little gap in the bullet stream which prevents you from just nailing the FIRE button for a continuous stream that would make it very hard for the baddies to get you? Well, it starts out like that in T3K, but if you're bold, you can augment your firepower. When an enemy fires a shot at you, you can either dodge the shot as per usual, or, if you're bold, you can tough it out, get in front of the shot, and take it out with your own bullets. If you take this more risky approach, then every enemy shot you shoot gets nicked from the Enemy Shots Available list and added to your own! Of course, you risk mistiming this manoeuvre and getting blasted off the Web, but the more often you get it right, the more powerful you become and the weaker they become. It's cool.

&gt;Upon my return it was straight back into work mode - the audio boys at VM had cooked up an FFT for me, and they wanted to be able to demonstrate a Nuon VLM at CES, which started on the 7th Jan - so I duly leapt back into the code. Despite only having a few days, I managed to come up with a few cool VLM effects which went down quite well at the show, so I'm told. It's evident that the VLM on Nuon is going to be rather spiffy - already the effects I have are far more responsive to the audio than the old Jaguar VLM effects, partly because the frame rate is higher so there is less lag between stuff happening in the music and happening on the screen, and partly because with the extra Nuon grunt I can do much more mungeing of the data before passing it on to the graphics, allowing extra cool stuff to happen - parts of effects can change size according to the overall energy in certain bands of the spectrum, and there are smoothly-varying params as well as the immediately-responding raw spectrum which can be used... the overall effect is Very Nice Indeed. I figure if I can get such stuff after only a few days, gimme a few weeks (and a bit more power, too, because there are certain parts of the Nuon audio libs I won't need to use in the final version that were necessary for the demo, and I will get about a third as much again rendering power in the final version) - anyway, gimme a decent run at it and I will produce a beast of a VLM which will cause your inner footwear to be forcibly removed ;-)

First are things that maybe could've avoided/staved off the crash. 

* 1980 - Atari does not release Atari 400 as a computer in 1979. Instead releases it as a console to replace the already aging Video Computer System. 

* 1982 - Mattel does not re-release Intellivision as Intellivision II. Instead focuses on replacing Intellivision with the canceled Intellivision III project. 

* 1983 - Coleco does not release Adam and focuses support on ColecoVision. Works on a successor console. 

* 1984 - Warner does not sell Atari. Instead releases the 8-bit 7800 ProSystem in 1984 as planned. 

Here are some things that maybe could've helped Atari. 

* 1989 - Atari releases a console version of their 16-bit Lynx handheld. 

Some things that could've helped Sega

* *1994-95 - Jointly released PlayStation with Sony
* 1994-1996 - Canceled Saturn and internally developed new hardware, or went with M2 or SGi chipsets, and released a more powerful console in 1996 while supporting Genesis/32X aggressively. Also having simply replaced Genesis with the ""Neptune"" and marketing as an upgraded Genesis, and then marketing the 32X adapter only to the existing userbase. 
* 2001 - Not canceling Dreamcast. By 2001 it had a userbase of 10 million, just under half of what GameCube and Xbox eventually achieved. It would've also been the most affordable console of its generation. Perhaps a price drop to $99.99. And until Xbox Live launched in 2002 it would've had online console gaming all to itself. 

Other what-ifs

* What if Nintendo released Sony's CD add-on?
* What if Magnavox released Odyssey^3 in 1982? 
* What if Nintendo 64 used optical media? Would it have been more competitive against PlayStation, and prevented Sony's total domination of the 6th generation?

One form makes it difficult to physically write. I compensate in normal life by typing. But even then, after every few letters I find myself hitting the backspace key a lot. One component to it is a deficit in my fine motor skills. Which holds me back when playing drums, although playing drums helped with it at the same time. 

So, right now I am writing this big long four or five thousand word paper for college. I am at 3400ish now, not sure where it'll end up. 

Like always I started out writing it stone sober. But over the past hour I've had about a glass and a half of wine. Maybe two. I've found that my fingertips are going exactly where I want them to go. Typing is a lot easier, and I am not making any mistakes. Like at all. My normal WPM with the mistakes is about 45. I am not into taking a typing test right now, but it's so much easier. 

A cursory google search shows that there's research to suggest that brain damage from alcohol abuse can cause dysgraphia. But none to show that it, or other downers can alleviate it.  There is a study suggesting that uppers such as methylphenidate, typically an ADHD drug, can help, but I've never liked uppers and can't imagine that.

#/r/betterCallSaul 

**89,645** criminals *lawyering up* for **3 years!**

Possibly the greatest show on television right now will wrap its sophomore season tonight. 

James ""Jimmy"" McGill, Esq. is the [big damn hero](http://gfycat.com/ThirdThreadbareAmericanbobtail) for this show. The audience loves him. We want to see him do well, although we already know [what happens to him.](http://gfycat.com/TestyAridBaldeagle) Is that where his story ends? Maybe not. It'll probably be a long time before we find out as *Better Call Saul* has been renewed for a third season, and there will probably be more to come. The real question is, when will we see Jimmy become Saul Goodman? Could it be tonight? 

Jimmy or Saul, whichever name you prefer to use, isn't the only character in the show. 

Fans love Mike. He's [a total bad ass](http://gfycat.com/ParallelPoliteBrownbutterfly), and we knew that from *Breaking Bad.* Somehow he seems even more hardcore now than he does in the future. But Mike doesn't kill... yet. He hasn't crossed that line. Sooner or later he will, though, and I can't wait to see that transformation. 

We also love [Kim](http://i.imgur.com/AdilAqK.jpg). What's not to love about her? [Jimmy sure does love her.](http://i.imgur.com/vgSV27T.jpg) I really don't want to see him lose her. But we all know that at some point he will. Maybe it's that loss that transforms him into Saul. Kim started out as unflinching in her morals, but slowly she's looked the other way on Jimmy's legal shenanigans. 

And then, of course, there's [Chuck](http://i.imgur.com/uvsUtiB.jpg). Crazy Chuck. Jimmy idolized his brother. All he wanted was his love and acceptance. In the end what he got was betrayal. [Fuck Chuck](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckchuck), am I right? The big question on everyone's mind today is, [""He ded?""](https://media.giphy.com/media/10bF8gYQtI32sE/giphy.gif) Well, you're going to have to wait until next season to find out? 

lol, jk. This isn't *The Walking Dead.* We'll find out only hours from now. 

###What's so great about /r/betterCallSaul? 

Man, the fans are just phenomenal. I always watch the show late, but I make damn sure to read the sub the minute after I do. All of the fan theories, interpretations, and little catches that I missed add a lot of depth to the experience. I would've never caught that the restaurant in [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/1W5mckz.png) is the same one where Jesse gave money to the homeless dude. The *Breaking Bad* references are so minor that if not for the community I'd miss a lot of them, if not all. 

The fans are also way better at pointing out the brilliance of the cinematography than I am capable of noticing, like the similarity between [these two scenes](http://i.imgur.com/NOTvGqW.jpg) in back to back episodes. I did totally catch [this Beatles reference](http://i.imgur.com/1iMKCZ4.jpg), though! 

I'd just like to take a moment to thank everyone in the community and the fantastic mods for providing a great experience for a fan like me. 

---

Here are some questions for the fans. 

&gt;#1. Will we see Saul tonight?

&gt;&gt;

&gt;#2. Is Chuck going to live?

&gt;&gt;

&gt;#3. Will Jimmy and Kim's relationship, professional and romantic, survive this season?

&gt;&gt;

&gt;#4. How long will it be before Mike takes it to the next level?

&gt;&gt;

&gt;#5. What have your favorite *Better Call Saul* moments been?

&gt;&gt;

Please give us your answers in the comments section.

It's all good, man!

When I founded this subreddit three years ago I wasn't sure it'd even be able to muster 50 users, let alone 500. (Are we possibly the largest 32X-specific community on the internet?) I myself was a new redditor back then with very little idea of how reddit really worked. 

I've always loved 32X, though. I think it goes back to one weekend in 1994 I flew out to visit my uncle. He showed me DOOM on his PC.  I thought it was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. And then I found out that there was going to be this 32X thing and DOOM would be a launch title. 

I was sold. I just had to sell my mom on it. We were pretty poor. My dad had left and my mom, sister, and I were living in a two bedroom apartment. She was working full time and had a part time job. That Christmas she added a second part-time job at Toys 'R' Us. 

The only two gifts I got in 1994 were the 32X and DOOM. I couldn't have been more happy. It turned out to be one of the most memorable Christmases I ever had. Blockbuster had a small 32X section, so I also rented a lot of Star Wars Arcade and Metal Head. I have fond memories of that. 

So, 32X has always been a little special to me. As time went on it got a bad rep, but I always loved it. At one time or another I've owned all of the U.S. released games, though I am two games short at the moment. 

A big thank you to everyone who has ever been to this little sub, the first sub I ever made or even modded for that matter. It's literally 10 times larger than I ever expected it to be.

A lot of people say they'd love to get a Saturn, but the games are all too expensive. Well, not all of them. Yeah, some are pretty costly. Some are pretty cheap. Of course, really cheap games aren't always good. So I put together this list in order to encourage people to take a look at Saturn who thought that all of the good games for it were priced out of their reach. 

Game | Average Price | Genre| Description 
---|---|----|----
Scud: The Disposable Assassin	|	$5 	|	Side-Scrolling Shooter	|	In the future there are android assassins that you can buy from vending machines. They're supposed to self destruct, but this one doesn't. It's a Contra-lite side scrolling shooter with some first person scenes thrown in. It has a two player mode, but for some reason SegaSoft left out the story/cut scenes for it. The game gets trashed in most reviews, but it's pretty fun, easy to play, but can get difficult. 
Daytona USA CCE	|	$6 	|	Racing 	|	Daytona USA launched Saturn and Championship Circuit Edition is basically an upgraded version. Everyone knows this arcade racer, and if you like that sort of thing, then you'll like this. 
Virtua Fighter Remix	|	$6 	|	Fighting 	|	If you want the arcade experience of the original Virtua Fighter at home, then this is the best version. Ignore the  version that doesn't say ""remix."" It's terrible. Some say the 32X version is still better than Remix, but I think Remix edges it out. 
Sega Rally Championship	|	$7 	|	Racing 	|	Another Sega arcade racing conversion. This time it's rally racing. To be honest, I am not a big fan. I tried really hard to like this as it came with the Net Link 3.0 web browser, so I played it online. I am just not a racing game fan. But the game is super popular, so if you're into that sort of thing, the consensus is that it's very good. 
Virtua Fighter 2	|	$8 	|	Fighting	|	Virtua Fighter isn't for everyone, but the if you're into 3D fighting sims then VF2 is the pinnacle of the genre in the 90s. 
Deep Fear	|	$11 	|	Survival Horror	|	This one is an import, and I am basing the price on the Japanese import. The region lockout on Saturn is pretty easy to get around with a model 1 or the 4-in-1 cart. This game is Sega's answer to Resident Evil. It didn't get a U.S. release, and the UK version is a lot of money. Fortunately, all of the voice acting is in English, and so are a lot, but not all, of the menus. This is very playable for an English speaker, and a must have for Saturn horror fans. 
AMOK	|	$12 	|	3rd Person Shooter	|	Like a lot of the games on this list, this was also on PC. But it's a Saturn console exclusive. This is an early third person shooter that takes place under water. It's fast paced and has varied gameplay (running vs. swimming). The control is very good and so is the music. It's a fun game that is generally overlooked. 
Fighting Vipers	|	$12 	|	Fighting	|	I really like this fighting game. It's very arcadey, kind of the opposite of VF2. You have a roster of ""90s cool"" characters who roller blade, play guitar, and skateboard. Some characters have weapons. The cool thing about this title is the walled combat rings and the armor system. You can use the walls to jump off of, or slam opponents into. At the end of a match you can satisfyingly throw opponents through them, which is awesome. Every character has upper and lower body armor. It can be broken off via special moves. All of this stuff did make it into MegaMix. In fact, when FMM came out I traded my copy of FV for it. So it's the one game on this list that you might not really need if you have FMM. That said, I am really glad I played FV first. I also feel like there's some stuff in this game that didn't make it to FMM. I forget, though. 
Wing Arms	|	$13 	|	Flight Combat Sim	|	Here's a pretty good WWII flight sim fighter. It has terrible voice acting, like worse than most 90s stuff, but it does have a kinda neat alternate reality story that drives it. The game looks and plays well. It's not the greatest flight sim game on consoles in its generation, but it's good. 
The Mansion of Hidden Souls	|	$13 	|	Adventure	|	This game is the sequel to ""Mansion of Hidden Souls"" on Sega CD. They Should've called it ""Mansion of Hidden Souls 2"" or something. But no, they slapped a ""The"" in front of it. Yeah, that makes it different sounding enough, right? Wrong. I think most people thing this is an upgraded version of the Sega CD game. Even the Wikipedia page thinks it is. It's not. It's a totally different game. A true sequel. This is a straight up adventure game. It plays a lot like D. Pre-rendered 3D with point and click controls. I liked D better, but it's good if you like old school adventure games. 
Virtua Fighter Kids	|	$14 	|	Fighting	|	VF Kids is graphically more advanced than VF2, and the characters have some big heads and cool animations. If you like VF, then you'll like this. It's also different enough to make it worth the extra purchase. 
The Horde	|	$14 	|	Action/Strategy	|	Okay, so this really isn't a Saturn console exclusive. It's really a 3DO port. But most people didn't have a 3DO, and unlike most early 3DO games that were later ported, this one didn't get a PSX release. Crystal Dynamics made really good games and this one is no exception. It's kinda hard to describe. It's a strategy game in that you build a town and manage resources. But it's an action game in that you also hack and slash enemies. Like any good mid-90s game, there's also some really super cheese live action cut scenes. Wikipedia says they were cut from the Saturn version. Maybe reduced, because at least some of them are definitely there. This game is ""different,"" and in a good way. 
Fighters MegaMix	|	$18 	|	Fighting	|	Another ""must own"" title for Saturn owners. Sega boasted that it was the second best selling game in America when it came out. That's because there weren't enough Saturn owners around to make it a best seller. Still, it combines all of the characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers into one game. It's a lot more arcadey than VF2 and lacks the ring-out mechanic. Not all stages have walls either, like FV, but you can change a setting for that. It's a bit faster than FV. Also coming to the roster are characters from Sonic the Fighters, Virtua Cop 2, and Daytona USA, plus a few more. 
Virtua Cop 2	|	$18 	|	Light Gun Shooter	|	Sure, I could put Virtua Cop on this list, but why do that when you can own Virtua Cop 2? Sure, both are worth owning, but this one's better. You'll need a CRT, but it's worth it for the lightgun action… especially if you have two Virtua Guns! 
Last Bronx	|	$19 	|	Fighting - Weapons Based	|	Sega were really good at making 3D fighters. This is a weapons based fighter that plays great. 
Virtual On: Cybertroopers	|	$19 	|	Arcade	|	I really loved Virtual On. I never had the dual analog twinstick (probably one day), but I played this over and over online via Net Link. This is a really fun mech combat game that's as much strategy as it is fighting. Great for one player or two in split-screen mode. It also looks fantastic. 
Sonic 3D Blast	|	$20 	|	Platform	|	This game takes a lot of shit, and admittedly it's deserved because it completely departs the traditional Sonic formula. But if you're going to own 3D Blast, then own the Saturn version. First of all, it looks better. Second of all, it sounds better. And most importantly, the bonus stages are like the precursor to Sonic Adventure. They're amazing. If this game were released and it were just the bonus stages, they're so good this would've been a best seller. It would've sold millions. So, it's worth it for that alone. 
NiGHS Into Dreams…	|	$21 	|	Action	|	Pretty much a must own for Saturn. Prices seem all over the place for this one. If you're getting just the game and not the boxset that contains the 3D analog controller, I've seen this sell for as low as $10 recently. But at the same time a high of over $30. But I am still averaging this at $21. If I were stuck on a desert island and had only one game to play for the rest of my life, it'd be this one. It just doesn't get old and it challenges you to constantly challenge yourself. 
Blazing Heroes/Mystaria: The Realms of Lore	|	$27 	|	Strategy RPG	|	This is as close to Shining Force III as you're going to get on Saturn without spending $180. For some reason the game is under-appreciated, and I am totally fine with that because it means the price is low. The ""Mysteria"" version is less common and can cost more. The game was renamed shortly after release due to some trademark issue. 

Notes: 

^1 These are CIB prices only. Loose games can be had for less. 

^2 There's a Sega Saturn 3 Pack that comes with Daytona USA, Virtua Fighter 2, and Virtua Cop that can be had for only about $10. 

^3 Prices are largely based on completed eBay auctions. 

^4 Some games, (like Steep Slope Sliders, GunGriffion, and others), may have made the list, but there wasn't enough recent sales data. This was almost a top 25. 

^5 There are several games that are just priced out of my $30 range. Panzer Dragoon can be had for about $36, for example. Mr. Bones is in that range as well. Panzer Dragoon II: Zweii is in the $50 range. Die Hard Arcade seems to vary widely, between $40 and $80. Might be on the cusp of going up in value due to low supply and high demand. So, once the door is open, there are a lot of options out there for really good games that are well under $100 that can't be had anywhere else. 

^6 This list is highly subjective. I am not into Bug! or Clockwork Knight, and I would not recommend them to anyone. Then again, you may not like all of the games I mentioned. This list is just to help give people a general idea of what's out there for not a lot of money.

4858,2016-04-16 13:11:05+00:00,self.SegaSaturn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SegaSaturn/comments/4f1u1r/people_say_saturn_is_too_expensive_to_collect_for/,False,"I put this list together because I am a pretty big Saturn fan. A lot of people say they'd love to get a Saturn, but the games are all too expensive. Well, not all of them. Yeah, some are pretty costly. Some are pretty cheap. Of course, really cheap games aren't always good. So I put together this list in order to encourage people to take a look at Saturn who thought that all of the good games for it were priced out of their reach. 

Game | Average Price | Genre| Description 
---|---|----|----
Scud: The Disposable Assassin	|	$5 	|	Side-Scrolling Shooter	|	In the future there are android assassins that you can buy from vending machines. They're supposed to self destruct, but this one doesn't. It's a Contra-lite side scrolling shooter with some first person scenes thrown in. It has a two player mode, but for some reason SegaSoft left out the story/cut scenes for it. The game gets trashed in most reviews, but it's pretty fun, easy to play, but can get difficult. 
Daytona USA CCE	|	$6 	|	Racing 	|	Daytona USA launched Saturn and Championship Circuit Edition is basically an upgraded version. Everyone knows this arcade racer, and if you like that sort of thing, then you'll like this. 
Virtua Fighter Remix	|	$6 	|	Fighting 	|	If you want the arcade experience of the original Virtua Fighter at home, then this is the best version. Ignore the  version that doesn't say ""remix."" It's terrible. Some say the 32X version is still better than Remix, but I think Remix edges it out. 
Sega Rally Championship	|	$7 	|	Racing 	|	Another Sega arcade racing conversion. This time it's rally racing. To be honest, I am not a big fan. I tried really hard to like this as it came with the Net Link 3.0 web browser, so I played it online. I am just not a racing game fan. But the game is super popular, so if you're into that sort of thing, the consensus is that it's very good. 
Virtua Fighter 2	|	$8 	|	Fighting	|	Virtua Fighter isn't for everyone, but the if you're into 3D fighting sims then VF2 is the pinnacle of the genre in the 90s. 
Deep Fear	|	$11 	|	Survival Horror	|	This one is an import, and I am basing the price on the Japanese import. The region lockout on Saturn is pretty easy to get around with a model 1 or the 4-in-1 cart. This game is Sega's answer to Resident Evil. It didn't get a U.S. release, and the UK version is a lot of money. Fortunately, all of the voice acting is in English, and so are a lot, but not all, of the menus. This is very playable for an English speaker, and a must have for Saturn horror fans. 
AMOK	|	$12 	|	3rd Person Shooter	|	Like a lot of the games on this list, this was also on PC. But it's a Saturn console exclusive. This is an early third person shooter that takes place under water. It's fast paced and has varied gameplay (running vs. swimming). The control is very good and so is the music. It's a fun game that is generally overlooked. 
Fighting Vipers	|	$12 	|	Fighting	|	I really like this fighting game. It's very arcadey, kind of the opposite of VF2. You have a roster of ""90s cool"" characters who roller blade, play guitar, and skateboard. Some characters have weapons. The cool thing about this title is the walled combat rings and the armor system. You can use the walls to jump off of, or slam opponents into. At the end of a match you can satisfyingly throw opponents through them, which is awesome. Every character has upper and lower body armor. It can be broken off via special moves. All of this stuff did make it into MegaMix. In fact, when FMM came out I traded my copy of FV for it. So it's the one game on this list that you might not really need if you have FMM. That said, I am really glad I played FV first. I also feel like there's some stuff in this game that didn't make it to FMM. I forget, though. 
Wing Arms	|	$13 	|	Flight Combat Sim	|	Here's a pretty good WWII flight sim fighter. It has terrible voice acting, like worse than most 90s stuff, but it does have a kinda neat alternate reality story that drives it. The game looks and plays well. It's not the greatest flight sim game on consoles in its generation, but it's good. 
The Mansion of Hidden Souls	|	$13 	|	Adventure	|	This game is the sequel to ""Mansion of Hidden Souls"" on Sega CD. They Should've called it ""Mansion of Hidden Souls 2"" or something. But no, they slapped a ""The"" in front of it. Yeah, that makes it different sounding enough, right? Wrong. I think most people thing this is an upgraded version of the Sega CD game. Even the Wikipedia page thinks it is. It's not. It's a totally different game. A true sequel. This is a straight up adventure game. It plays a lot like D. Pre-rendered 3D with point and click controls. I liked D better, but it's good if you like old school adventure games. 
Virtua Fighter Kids	|	$14 	|	Fighting	|	VF Kids is graphically more advanced than VF2, and the characters have some big heads and cool animations. If you like VF, then you'll like this. It's also different enough to make it worth the extra purchase. 
The Horde	|	$14 	|	Action/Strategy	|	Okay, so this really isn't a Saturn console exclusive. It's really a 3DO port. But most people didn't have a 3DO, and unlike most early 3DO games that were later ported, this one didn't get a PSX release. Crystal Dynamics made really good games and this one is no exception. It's kinda hard to describe. It's a strategy game in that you build a town and manage resources. But it's an action game in that you also hack and slash enemies. Like any good mid-90s game, there's also some really super cheese live action cut scenes. Wikipedia says they were cut from the Saturn version. Maybe reduced, because at least some of them are definitely there. This game is ""different,"" and in a good way. 
Fighters MegaMix	|	$18 	|	Fighting	|	Another ""must own"" title for Saturn owners. Sega boasted that it was the second best selling game in America when it came out. That's because there weren't enough Saturn owners around to make it a best seller. Still, it combines all of the characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers into one game. It's a lot more arcadey than VF2 and lacks the ring-out mechanic. Not all stages have walls either, like FV, but you can change a setting for that. It's a bit faster than FV. Also coming to the roster are characters from Sonic the Fighters, Virtua Cop 2, and Daytona USA, plus a few more. 
Virtua Cop 2	|	$18 	|	Light Gun Shooter	|	Sure, I could put Virtua Cop on this list, but why do that when you can own Virtua Cop 2? Sure, both are worth owning, but this one's better. You'll need a CRT, but it's worth it for the lightgun action… especially if you have two Virtua Guns! 
Last Bronx	|	$19 	|	Fighting - Weapons Based	|	Sega were really good at making 3D fighters. This is a weapons based fighter that plays great. 
Virtual On: Cybertroopers	|	$19 	|	Arcade	|	I really loved Virtual On. I never had the dual analog twinstick (probably one day), but I played this over and over online via Net Link. This is a really fun mech combat game that's as much strategy as it is fighting. Great for one player or two in split-screen mode. It also looks fantastic. 
Sonic 3D Blast	|	$20 	|	Platform	|	This game takes a lot of shit, and admittedly it's deserved because it completely departs the traditional Sonic formula. But if you're going to own 3D Blast, then own the Saturn version. First of all, it looks better. Second of all, it sounds better. And most importantly, the bonus stages are like the precursor to Sonic Adventure. They're amazing. If this game were released and it were just the bonus stages, they're so good this would've been a best seller. It would've sold millions. So, it's worth it for that alone. 
NiGHS Into Dreams…	|	$21 	|	Action	|	Pretty much a must own for Saturn. Prices seem all over the place for this one. If you're getting just the game and not the boxset that contains the 3D analog controller, I've seen this sell for as low as $10 recently. But at the same time a high of over $30. But I am still averaging this at $21. If I were stuck on a desert island and had only one game to play for the rest of my life, it'd be this one. It just doesn't get old and it challenges you to constantly challenge yourself. 
Blazing Heroes/Mystaria: The Realms of Lore	|	$27 	|	Strategy RPG	|	This is as close to Shining Force III as you're going to get on Saturn without spending $180. For some reason the game is under-appreciated, and I am totally fine with that because it means the price is low. The ""Mysteria"" version is less common and can cost more. The game was renamed shortly after release due to some trademark issue.

About: The subreddit was created by /u/surrenderdorothy and I. The idea is to have a SFW Porn sub that allows historical documents. The main reason for this sub's existence that such posts are not allowed on /r/HistoryPorn. That's why we share a lot of mods with /r/HistoryPorn. Further, they refer such posts to our sub and have a CSS sticky to us at the top of their sub. Finally, our sub has complied with SFW Porn Network rules since day ojne. For these reasons, I feel that our sub fills an important role in the SFW Porn Network. 

Mods:

Many of our mods are already mods of others SFW Porn Network Subs.

**10,134** guessers *guessing* for **2 years!**

Here's how /r/SwordOrSheath works. Someone posts a picture of a person, and then it's up to you to guess if that person has a sword or a sheath. Of course, by ""sword"" I mean *dick*. And by ""sheath"" I mean *a vagina*. 

Wanna play? Of course you do. 

Moderator and founder /u/MaverickTopGun was kind enough to give me what he considers to be the three hardest examples on the sub. 

1. [This is a male/female couple. Can you tell which is which?](http://imgur.com/a/7YcR4)
2. [Raid boss](http://imgur.com/jLSv57N)
3. [Front page of the newspaper](http://imgur.com/sr1SON7)

The answers to these are awaiting you in the comments section of this post. So, be warned there will be spoilers. 

When I asked how this sub got started, here was the response. 

&gt;&gt;I made up the game as a game to play with friends when people watching. They liked the name and someone thought it would be a good subreddit (styled after drunkorakid) so I made it.

Before playing you should know that this game has rules. No posts of transgender persons, and absolutely no bullying! 

##So, do you have what it takes to play this game?

5050,2016-04-09 09:14:40+00:00,self.retrogaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/4e0nha/saturn_is_too_expensive_to_collect_for_heres_my/,False,"I put this list together because I am a pretty big Saturn fan. A lot of people say they'd love to get a Saturn, but the games are all too expensive. Well, not all of them. Yeah, some are pretty costly. Some are pretty cheap. Of course, really cheap games aren't always good. So I put together this list in order to encourage people to take a look at Saturn who thought that all of the good games for it were priced out of their reach. 

Game | Average Price | Genre| Description 
---|---|----|----
Scud: The Disposable Assassin	|	$5 	|	Side-Scrolling Shooter	|	In the future there are android assassins that you can buy from vending machines. They're supposed to self destruct, but this one doesn't. It's a Contra-lite side scrolling shooter with some first person scenes thrown in. It has a two player mode, but for some reason SegaSoft left out the story/cut scenes for it. The game gets trashed in most reviews, but it's pretty fun, easy to play, but can get difficult. 
Daytona USA CCE	|	$6 	|	Racing 	|	Daytona USA launched Saturn and Championship Circuit Edition is basically an upgraded version. Everyone knows this arcade racer, and if you like that sort of thing, then you'll like this. 
Virtua Fighter Remix	|	$6 	|	Fighting 	|	If you want the arcade experience of the original Virtua Fighter at home, then this is the best version. Ignore the  version that doesn't say ""remix."" It's terrible. Some say the 32X version is still better than Remix, but I think Remix edges it out. 
Sega Rally Championship	|	$7 	|	Racing 	|	Another Sega arcade racing conversion. This time it's rally racing. To be honest, I am not a big fan. I tried really hard to like this as it came with the Net Link 3.0 web browser, so I played it online. I am just not a racing game fan. But the game is super popular, so if you're into that sort of thing, the consensus is that it's very good. 
Virtua Fighter 2	|	$8 	|	Fighting	|	Virtua Fighter isn't for everyone, but the if you're into 3D fighting sims then VF2 is the pinnacle of the genre in the 90s. 
Deep Fear	|	$11 	|	Survival Horror	|	This one is an import, and I am basing the price on the Japanese import. The region lockout on Saturn is pretty easy to get around with a model 1 or the 4-in-1 cart. This game is Sega's answer to Resident Evil. It didn't get a U.S. release, and the UK version is a lot of money. Fortunately, all of the voice acting is in English, and so are a lot, but not all, of the menus. This is very playable for an English speaker, and a must have for Saturn horror fans. 
AMOK	|	$12 	|	3rd Person Shooter	|	Like a lot of the games on this list, this was also on PC. But it's a Saturn console exclusive. This is an early third person shooter that takes place under water. It's fast paced and has varied gameplay (running vs. swimming). The control is very good and so is the music. It's a fun game that is generally overlooked. 
Fighting Vipers	|	$12 	|	Fighting	|	I really like this fighting game. It's very arcadey, kind of the opposite of VF2. You have a roster of ""90s cool"" characters who roller blade, play guitar, and skateboard. Some characters have weapons. The cool thing about this title is the walled combat rings and the armor system. You can use the walls to jump off of, or slam opponents into. At the end of a match you can satisfyingly throw opponents through them, which is awesome. Every character has upper and lower body armor. It can be broken off via special moves. All of this stuff did make it into MegaMix. In fact, when FMM came out I traded my copy of FV for it. So it's the one game on this list that you might not really need if you have FMM. That said, I am really glad I played FV first. I also feel like there's some stuff in this game that didn't make it to FMM. I forget, though. 
Wing Arms	|	$13 	|	Flight Combat Sim	|	Here's a pretty good WWII flight sim fighter. It has terrible voice acting, like worse than most 90s stuff, but it does have a kinda neat alternate reality story that drives it. The game looks and plays well. It's not the greatest flight sim game on consoles in its generation, but it's good. 
The Mansion of Hidden Souls	|	$13 	|	Adventure	|	This game is the sequel to ""Mansion of Hidden Souls"" on Sega CD. They Should've called it ""Mansion of Hidden Souls 2"" or something. But no, they slapped a ""The"" in front of it. Yeah, that makes it different sounding enough, right? Wrong. I think most people thing this is an upgraded version of the Sega CD game. Even the Wikipedia page thinks it is. It's not. It's a totally different game. A true sequel. This is a straight up adventure game. It plays a lot like D. Pre-rendered 3D with point and click controls. I liked D better, but it's good if you like old school adventure games. 
Virtua Fighter Kids	|	$14 	|	Fighting	|	VF Kids is graphically more advanced than VF2, and the characters have some big heads and cool animations. If you like VF, then you'll like this. It's also different enough to make it worth the extra purchase. 
The Horde	|	$14 	|	Action/Strategy	|	Okay, so this really isn't a Saturn console exclusive. It's really a 3DO port. But most people didn't have a 3DO, and unlike most early 3DO games that were later ported, this one didn't get a PSX release. Crystal Dynamics made really good games and this one is no exception. It's kinda hard to describe. It's a strategy game in that you build a town and manage resources. But it's an action game in that you also hack and slash enemies. Like any good mid-90s game, there's also some really super cheese live action cut scenes. Wikipedia says they were cut from the Saturn version. Maybe reduced, because at least some of them are definitely there. This game is ""different,"" and in a good way. 
Fighters MegaMix	|	$18 	|	Fighting	|	Another ""must own"" title for Saturn owners. Sega boasted that it was the second best selling game in America when it came out. That's because there weren't enough Saturn owners around to make it a best seller. Still, it combines all of the characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers into one game. It's a lot more arcadey than VF2 and lacks the ring-out mechanic. Not all stages have walls either, like FV, but you can change a setting for that. It's a bit faster than FV. Also coming to the roster are characters from Sonic the Fighters, Virtua Cop 2, and Daytona USA, plus a few more. 
Virtua Cop 2	|	$18 	|	Light Gun Shooter	|	Sure, I could put Virtua Cop on this list, but why do that when you can own Virtua Cop 2? Sure, both are worth owning, but this one's better. You'll need a CRT, but it's worth it for the lightgun action… especially if you have two Virtua Guns! 
Last Bronx	|	$19 	|	Fighting - Weapons Based	|	Sega were really good at making 3D fighters. This is a weapons based fighter that plays great. 
Virtual On: Cybertroopers	|	$19 	|	Arcade	|	I really loved Virtual On. I never had the dual analog twinstick (probably one day), but I played this over and over online via Net Link. This is a really fun mech combat game that's as much strategy as it is fighting. Great for one player or two in split-screen mode. It also looks fantastic. 
Sonic 3D Blast	|	$20 	|	Platform	|	This game takes a lot of shit, and admittedly it's deserved because it completely departs the traditional Sonic formula. But if you're going to own 3D Blast, then own the Saturn version. First of all, it looks better. Second of all, it sounds better. And most importantly, the bonus stages are like the precursor to Sonic Adventure. They're amazing. If this game were released and it were just the bonus stages, they're so good this would've been a best seller. It would've sold millions. So, it's worth it for that alone. 
NiGHS Into Dreams…	|	$21 	|	Action	|	Pretty much a must own for Saturn. Prices seem all over the place for this one. If you're getting just the game and not the boxset that contains the 3D analog controller, I've seen this sell for as low as $10 recently. But at the same time a high of over $30. But I am still averaging this at $21. If I were stuck on a desert island and had only one game to play for the rest of my life, it'd be this one. It just doesn't get old and it challenges you to constantly challenge yourself. 
Blazing Heroes/Mystaria: The Realms of Lore	|	$27 	|	Strategy RPG	|	This is as close to Shining Force III as you're going to get on Saturn without spending $180. For some reason the game is under-appreciated, and I am totally fine with that because it means the price is low. The ""Mysteria"" version is less common and can cost more. The game was renamed shortly after release due to some trademark issue. 

Notes: 

^1 These are CIB prices only. Loose games can be had for less. 

^2 There's a Sega Saturn 3 Pack that comes with Daytona USA, Virtua Fighter 2, and Virtua Cop that can be had for only about $10. 

^3 Prices are largely based on completed eBay auctions. 

^4 Some games, (like Steep Slope Sliders, GunGriffion, and others), may have made the list, but there wasn't enough recent sales data. This was almost a top 25. 

^5 There are several games that are just priced out of my $30 range. Panzer Dragoon can be had for about $36, for example. Mr. Bones is in that range as well. Panzer Dragoon II: Zweii is in the $50 range. Die Hard Arcade seems to vary widely, between $40 and $80. Might be on the cusp of going up in value due to low supply and high demand. So, once the door is open, there are a lot of options out there for really good games that are well under $100 that can't be had anywhere else. 

^6 This list is highly subjective. I am not into Bug! or Clockwork Knight, and I would not recommend them to anyone. Then again, you may not like all of the games I mentioned. This list is just to help give people a general idea of what's out there for not a lot of money.

**9,829** *gifually frustrated* people for **7 months!**

GIFs are pretty popular on reddit. (That's GIF with a hard G, by the way.) There are GIFs, GIFVs, Gfycats, WEBMs, and whatever else. There are so many subs dedicated to just GIFs that I am not sure they've ever even been counted. Plus there are so many other subs that allow GIF posts in addition to other content. 

**So, what's this GIF sub all about?**

K, I'll tell you. /r/gifsthatendtoosoon is for when you are really expecting one more thing to happen and you don't see it. The GIF ends before you're satisfied. Admit it. It's happened to you oh so many times before. It feels like [this](http://i.imgur.com/LrpEfkq.gifv). 

Here are some examples:

* [Great shot!](http://livedoor.4.blogimg.jp/kinisoku/imgs/b/f/bf4fea89.gif)
* [Nutcracker](http://i.imgur.com/Lq6m5QY.gifv) 
* [Turkey cake](https://i.imgur.com/1brOghQ.gifv)
* [Airless tire](http://i.imgur.com/G9Y3gMD.gifv)
* [Dancing on the counter-top](http://i.imgur.com/KuHZ0vk.gifv) 

Got that frustrated feeling? 

Let's see what the mods have to say for themselves.

---

&gt;#1. What gif that ended too soon infuriates you the most?


&gt;&gt;**/u/Rook730:** I would have to say that [this](http://i.imgur.com/c7ilQna.gif) gif is the most frustrating for me. Not only does it end too soon, but it ends in a way which I didn't expect. Apparently most people agree with me as it is [top #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifsthatendtoosoon/comments/3j3prb/tetris/) of all time. We do allow NSFW content though and there are a significant number of people who enjoy tormenting themselves with posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifsthatendtoosoon/comments/3j4wz2/wait_for_it_nsfw/). 

&gt;&gt;**/u/-Replicated:** [This one](http://i.imgur.com/u9rmVVb.gifv) you miss the reactions, the aftermath, everything.

&gt;#2. How'd this sub get started?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Rook730:** I started this sub after a request was made in /r/gaming. The post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3j2su8/i_can_totally_get_behind_this_gtav_mod/culxu0d?context=3).



&gt;#3. Tell us about yourself.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Rook730:** I am an engineer by trade and that has absolutely nothing to do with why /r/gifsthatendtoosoon was created or is a thriving subreddit community, but it is an interesting tidbit for you.

&gt;&gt; I guess being an engineer is relevant as I am captivated by numbers, so I thought I would share some with you all. /r/gifsthatendtoosoon average approximately 2,500 unique IP visitations a day and are increasing by an average of 50 subscribers a day. If you are interested you can view our stats [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifsthatendtoosoon/about/traffic/).

&gt;&gt;**/u/-Replicated:** I browse Reddit wayyy too much, play games and watch a podcast called Painkiller Already, RSK!


&gt;#5.  Do you want to be disappointed daily? 

&gt;&gt;**/u/-Replicated:**  then why not come on down to /r/gifsthatendtoosoon 

&gt;#6. What's your favorite band/musician?


&gt;&gt;**/u/Rook730:** I will shamelessly plug for a fantastic band called [Walk Off The Earth](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsERENcA_H3_G-O_Bhh5syw). These guys (and girl) are all fantastically talented musicians who have fun at what they do and inspire others to join in the merriment.

&gt;&gt;**/u/-Replicated:** Right now I would say Houndmouth [here's one from them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8wifV5RYr8)

&gt;&gt;Thanks for the opportunity, have a great day!

**Genre:** Accessory 

**Estimated year of release:** 1950s

**Other details:** This item is really useful for second generation systems that have antenna connectors, especially when you're connecting one to a TV that only has antenna in and not coax. 

It looks like a clothespin. It also works like one, mechanically. At the front of it there are metal teeth to clamp down on the antenna in screws on the television. On the top of it there's an antenna in port. 

The way you would use this is to connect a device, such as a TV/Game Switch or a coax to antenna converter to the top of it, and then you clamp it to the antenna in port on the back of the television. 

That way if you change devices you don't have to unscrew one and screw in another. 

My google-fu is failing me right now. The shop that repaired my antique television had one and the guy showed it to me. But I can't figure out what it's called.

**337** artists *shakin' things up* for **3 years!**

This is a small sub, so I am going to keep this short and sweet. 

Do you know what an Etch A Sketch is? Of course you do! Well, probably. If not, it's [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch)! Yes, I am talking about one of those red, mechanical toys that most of us grew up with drawing crude pictures on. 

There is definitely a certain skill to using one well, and the folks at /r/etchasketch really have a knack for it! (I never did.)

Check out some of their creations:

* [The Last Supper](http://imgur.com/aWpKbWq)
* [Game Boy](http://i.imgur.com/it1YBjB.jpg)
* [Pam from Archer](http://i.imgur.com/anYMBI7.jpg)

* [A classic](http://i.imgur.com/IW9zPP1.jpg) [NSFW]

That should be enough to get your interest piqued.

For more about the subreddit, check out what its mods have to say:

---

&gt;#1. Do remember the first time that you saw an Etch A Sketch?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Simon_Draws:** I shared a box of toys with my sister when I was about 5, and I distinctly recall having an Etch A Sketch. I remember that I would bang the screen on sharp edges and pry at the corners of the toy, trying to see what the inside looked like. Twenty years later, I saw an Etch A Sketch in a convenience store and impulsively purchased one.

&gt;&gt;**/u/lotterywish:** Definitely as a wee kid, but as an adult I picked one up and used it as an ice-breaker activity for house parties. I made everyone draw a boat if it was their first time over.

&gt;#2. What is your favorite post from the sub?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Simon_Draws:** [""Crusader stands watch over medieval witch burning.""](http://i.imgur.com/5DlmuR7.jpg) by /u/lotterywish is extraordinarily detailed and well thought out. There are several wild Etch a Sketch artists out there like /u/pikajane and /u/Etch_A_Sketcher who submit amazing art outside of the subreddit. [This one](http://i.imgur.com/syfRO.jpg) by /u/pikajane was drawn sideways on a Pocket Etch A Sketch! It blows my mind.

&gt;&gt;**/u/lotterywish:** [""...we will have 180 sucscribers by 2020""](https://www.reddit.com/r/etchasketch/comments/48a00i/at_this_rate_we_will_have_180_subscribers_by_2020/)
Simon_Draws crosspost that starting the first big blow-up for the sub, crazy that 3 weeks ago that was the actual subscriber projection. It was just a really clever use of the Etchasketch!

&gt;#3. How difficult is it really for a person to get started making great drawings with their Etch A Sketch?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Simon_Draws:** It's taken me almost a year of on-and-off doodling with an Etch A Sketch to unlock the secret of drawing what I want to depict. Even then, writing a short message takes me almost half an hour. You will need to visualize what to draw, where to start, and most importantly where the point is moving. I've shaken many an Etch A Sketch in frustration after making a mistake an hour later. After a while, your fingers move the knobs instinctively (now you're thinking with Etch A Sketches!)

&gt;&gt;**/u/lotterywish:** It's not hard at all. Every single time you pick up the Etchasketch and draw something you get a little better or learn something new. It's a fun thing to have around the house for adults and kids alike (I swear I'm not from Ohio-Art corportate)

&gt;#4. Tell us about yourself a little.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Simon_Draws:**  I started this novelty account after being inspired by /u/motivatinggiraffe's cheerful posts and comments. I draw pictures for complete strangers to bring them joy and happiness. Since then, I expanded my medium to include pixel art and Etch A Sketching.

&gt;&gt;**/u/lotterywish:** I'm a creative writer for Canadian radio, and most of my drawings are done in about an hour or two spread over lunch breaks.

&gt;#5. Anything else to add?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Simon_Draws:** The inside of an Etch A Sketch is filled with aluminum powder. There are also small polystyrene balls that help spread the powder and keep it from clumping.

&gt;&gt;&gt;/u/ZadocPaet: Neat.

&gt;&gt;**/u/lotterywish:** ""What's the key to a good Etchasketch?""
 Lots of time spent going back and forth in tight little lines. It takes forever, and it looks decent!

&gt;#6. What's the key to a good Etch A Sketch?

**57,899** dads *with dad-like reflexes* for **1 year!**

**What is a dad reflex?** 

It's a superpower obtained after becoming a father. It allows dads to literally save the day by performing superhuman feats. 

Here are some examples:

* [Dad pushes his son out of the way of traffic and takes the hit \[possibly NSFW\]](http://i.imgur.com/YPqd5Fs.gifv)

* [Dad makes no-look back-handed grab at the grocery store](http://i.imgur.com/p2iFzyK.gifv)

* [Dad rescues little girl from disaster](http://i.imgur.com/PHoijrL.gif)

**Do dad reflexes need to be good?**

Nope, they can be shitty. That's why each post is rated on a scale of 0-5 stars. Usually five-star dad reflexes are reserved for when dad actually puts himself in danger when making a save. There are plenty of zero and one star examples. Want to see some? Of course you do. 

* [Dad catches ball with one hand!](http://i.imgur.com/AKCQ7cd.gifv)
* [Dad caught me slippin. Love him.](http://i.imgur.com/YaEedqD.gif)

**Do the reflexes have to be by actual dads?**

Nope, dude. They can be from anyone doing a superhuman feat to save something. That's right, *something*, not *someone*. There don't even have to be kids in the gifs and videos on /r/dadreflexes. How does that work? Like this:

* [Dad saves his car](http://i.imgur.com/p3qsQKF.gifv)
* [Dad does the tablecloth trick](http://i.imgur.com/NAVndM7.gifv)
* [A different type of Father reacts quickly](http://imgur.com/5MB67TK)

As you can see, /r/DadReflexes has a specific kind of content, and lots of diverse submissions. So check it out!

**2,845** readers *discovering the small subs* for **1 year!**

I am a moderator there, so I can tell you first hand that Tiny Subreddit of the Day is a lot like this one. Regular users send us nominations for great small subs, and we we feature one of them every single day. The goal is to help people discover little subreddits that they may not have ever noticed before. 

TSRotD has been featured here before, [about a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/2hoclt/september_28th_2014_rtinysubredditoftheday_daily/?ref=search_posts). But a lot has changed. It used to operate a lot like this one. Each featured sub would have a great big write-up and mod interviews, as is common here. But that turned out to be [a lot of work](https://www.reddit.com/r/TinySubredditoftheDay/comments/49v21z/march_10h_2016_rtinysubredditoftheday_were_back/) for little pay off, so [last September](https://www.reddit.com/r/TinySubredditoftheDay/comments/3kojsi/sept_12th_2015_rtinysubredditoftheday_is/) the subreddit announced that it was closing. Shortly thereafter it [entered into a partnership with Subreddit of the Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/TinySubredditoftheDay/comments/3ky08s/rtinysubredditoftheday_update_a_new_partnership/), which is how I got to be a mod of the sub. 

After some discussion it was decided that we would feature one subreddit a day, but as a link. This way we could still highlight great small communities on reddit. About a month ago TSRotD returned from the dead. With a new format and the help of [some sidebar ads on reddit](http://imgur.com/a/PxlMH), the sub is now doing great. 

Personally, the thing I love most about modding at /r/tinysubredditoftheday is the appreciation shown by members of the featured subs. That and watching their number of subscribers tick up overnight. 

I don't run the show alone, however. So I asked a few questions of fellow mod **/u/nekosune**, who has been there since before me. 

---

&gt;&gt;Woooo my second time ansering questions!

&gt;#1. What do you like about the small subs?

&gt;&gt;The potential to turn into brilliant ones thanks to the fostering community.

&gt;#2.  What are some of your favorite subs to have ever been featured on TSRotD?

&gt;&gt;/r/catshiding cats, what more can you say?

&gt;#3. How do you find such little reddits?

&gt;&gt; Mostly so far? others do, Looking at /r/newsubreddits helps

&gt;#4. Who are you?

&gt;&gt; I am /u/nekosune , programmer

&gt;#5.  What is your favorite cheese? 

&gt;&gt;Blue cheese

If you're looking to go further down the rabbit hole to find even more great subs, check out /r/TinySubredditOfTheDay. And if you know of a good small subreddit that needs more love, please [nominate it!](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/tinysubredditoftheday&amp;subject=Subreddit%20Nomination) The criteria is that they must be at least 30 days old, active, and have less than 1,000 users.

It doesn't work on my Trinitron, my little 80s portable RCA, or my 1951 RCA. 

Symptoms are different on the different TVs. Screen is fuzzy on the Trinitron, it is fuzzy and rolls on the 80s RCA. On the RCA Victor it's crystal clear, the the display shows up four times. 

I used to have a Panasonic Tau as my main retro TV, and before that a generic 90s Toshiba CRT, and it worked on those. I took it to a trade show last year and I forget what TV I had, but it worked fine on that one too. 

I know there's a technical reason and a way to know which TVs it is and is not compatible with. Anyone know it?",gamecollecting,Technical question about Odyseey.

How to take an element of a photo and ""cut it out"" so that the background is transparent. I've needed to do this professionally many times. Also in posts to /r/photoshopbattles. ;) 

So here's how you do it. 

Before getting started you're going to need your polygon tool. That is, by default, disabled in SnagIt 12, which is what I am using. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SnagIt/comments/4b5kt7/how_to_get_the_polygon_tool_back_in_snagit/) explains how to do it. 

You're going to need to save the image you're going to be editing as a .png file so that in can support transparency. Also a good idea to start with high quality image in the first place. 

**Step 1.** Start by creating your polygon at one of the edges of the screen. 

http://i.imgur.com/Sm1PSDn.png

* *Note: I prefer to use a color that will stand out in the image, a one point line, and no anti-aliasing.*

**Step 2.** Draw the first line towards the object that you're going to cut out and begin to outline it. Zoom in for any parts that are ""rounded"" or highly detailed. 

http://i.imgur.com/uUuZuzK.png

http://i.imgur.com/LyHhuvy.png

**Step 3.** DO NOT completely outline the object. Instead come close. Then go back near your starting point. From there, begin to draw a box around the object. 

http://i.imgur.com/cKKYExV.png

**Step 4.** Complete the polygon. Then fill it with a color that isn't in the image. Here I use a ""green screen"" kind of a bright green. 


http://i.imgur.com/Fx2s5Dp.png

**Step 5.** Flatten the object. 

* *Note: Before flattening, make sure you have the lines lined up correctly. Zoom in. Go over it. Adjust the vectors as needed. A tip I have is to always add extra vectors because it allows for better adjustment.* 

**Step 6.** There is going to be a gap, as seen above. Use the shape tool to create another shape to fill it in. Use the same color as before for the fill. 

http://i.imgur.com/dZu4Ynx.png

**Step 7.** Use the Selection tool to select the area around the object. 

http://i.imgur.com/RAEIHUT.png

**Step 8.** Crop the image. 

http://i.imgur.com/vZjPDeD.png

**Step 9.** Use the Fill tool to fill the shape with transparency. 

http://i.imgur.com/Wrv3ITF.png

* *Note: Make sure the background of the image is set to transparent.*

That's it. Once you've done that you have a ""cut out"" image that you can use in a nice clean instruction manual, web app, PowerPoint, or what have you. You can also drop your cut out image into some other image [like this](http://i.imgur.com/F1d3Khs.png)! (Sort of what one might do in /r/photoshopbattles.) 


Here is the final product from this tutorial:

I could have done a **much** better job here by zooming in and making sure I got every little detail. But this was quick and dirty for the purposes of this post.

I am making it because I use this technique a lot in instructional design. 

Why use it? Because sometimes you're on space, e.g. page width. You want to instruct a reader on how to find an object relative to the screen, but it's the object that's the thing, so you don't need to capture the entire screen. 

So let's do it. 

For my example I am going to use another TechSmith tool, Camtasia Studio. (Shout out to /r/CamtasiaStudio!) 

In this example let's imagine that I am trying to draw the reader's attention to the tabs menu. 

--

**Step 1.** Capture the screen. 

http://i.imgur.com/F8dBfoD.png

**Step 2.** Use the selection tool to copy the area that is the subject of the instruction. 

**Step 3.** Paste the area. 

**Step 4.** Resize the pasted object. To maintain aspect ratio, hold the shift key while dragging the vectors. 

http://i.imgur.com/w0eWSnC.png

* *Note: In this example, I extended the size of the canvas so that the object is not entirely in front of the application window.* 

**Step 5.** Flatten the object. Right-click &gt; Flatten Object. 

* *Note: I find it important to flatten objects so that they aren't accidentally moved or selected.* 

**Step 6.** Use the Shape tool to draw a rectangle around both the origin area of the application and the pasted area of the application. 

http://i.imgur.com/yZtX4Jg.png

**Step 7.** Use the line tool to draw a line from the top right of the origin rectangle to the top right of the destination rectangle. Repeat this for the bottom left. 

http://i.imgur.com/lvtlI8v.png

* *Note: Make sure that the lines line up to the corners. Zoom if needed.* 

At this point, the image can be done. To get more fancy, follow the remaining steps. 

**Step 8.** Repeat 'Step 7' for the top left corners. Then draw a line from the bottom right of the origin rectangle to approximately where it would end if it were to go behind the destination rectangle. 

http://i.imgur.com/ScL19qZ.png

* *Note: To line this up effectively I first guess on where the line for the bottom right would end. Then I draw a line from the bottom right of the destination rectangle to the bottom right of the origin rectangle. Next I line up the first line. Once aligned I delete the second.* 

**Step 9.** Use the shapes tool to draw a polygon around the outside borders of the destination rectangle, then follow the lines and complete your polygon. 

* *Note: The polygon tool is not shown by default in SnagIt 12. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SnagIt/comments/4b5kt7/how_to_get_the_polygon_tool_back_in_snagit/) to enable it.* 

**Step 10.** Use the Opacity tool (Tools &gt; Effects &gt; Opacity) to select an opacity between 50 and 25 percent.

I was asked to submit this again because last time the bot didn't work. 

The subreddit was created by /u/surrenderdorothy and myself as  a sub for images of historical documents.  In particular, as a place for people to go due to the fact that /r/historyporn doesn't allow documents. 

Before she deleted her account, SD said she had the process for admission in the works. So I am trying to get the ball rolling again on this. 

I already mod one subreddit that is in the SFW Network. In fact, all of our mods except for one mod subs in the network. 

Our subreddit already complies with SFW rules for titles. ",PornOverlords,[Discussion] Admit /r/ArchivePorn to SFW Network,https://www.reddit.com/r/PornOverlords/comments/4b1rhz/discussion_admit_rarchiveporn_to_sfw_network/

**3,369** wharf rats *scraping rust* for **10 months!**

As it turns out, there are a lot of different kinds of dry docks that I didn't know existed. Like there are [floating dry docks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_dock#Floating), slipways, which is a ramp where a ship or boat enters and exists the water; there are graving docks, which is what typically comes to my mind when I think of a dry dock, essentially a boat out of water. 

I'll admit it. When I began to write this feature I tried to learn some about the subject, which I admittedly knew nothing about. But that's not the beauty of this sub, or any of the SFW Porn subs for that matter. The beauty is that you get to look at beautiful pictures and enjoy them. It doesn't matter if you're super familiar with the subject or not. You have eyeballs. And that's all you need in order  to enjoy /r/drydockporn. 

I'm going to share with you some pics from the sub that really caught my eye. 

[This is an aerial view of four Lafayette-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines in the early stages of being scrapped out in a graving dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Washington in 1993](http://i.imgur.com/Q5cFLat.jpg). That just looks powerful to me. 

[Here's a gif of some guys launch a ship in 2015.](http://i.imgur.com/U8hU5XU.gifv) At first I didn't know what was going on. I had no idea they used axes for that. But it does look pretty cool. 

[The propeller of the U.S.S. George Washington out of water just dwarfs these four men.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/USS_George_Washington_%28CVN-73%29_propeller.jpg) Shipbuilding is an impressive feat of engineering. 

To find out more from someone who knows what they're actually talking about, I turned to moderator **/u/sverdrupian**.

&gt;#1. What made you want to start up this sub?

&gt;&gt;I started this sub because it's at a unique intersection of my passions and appeared to be a missing niche in the SFW Porn network. I like detailed photos that show how machines work or are used. I also have an interest in the ocean and marine science. Throw in a bit of history and world travel to the mix and the result is /r/drydockporn.

&gt;#2. What's the attraction to boats and ships out of water?

&gt;&gt;Ships out of water expose the entire shape of the hull and interesting working bits like [propellers and rudders](https://i.imgur.com/2ADIZ5p.jpg).  It's a chance to see the entirety of the vessel. A ship going in to drydock is like a car going into the garage to have work done. Ship [launches](https://i.imgur.com/P3p7ovV.jpg) are like a car in the showroom - brand new and shiny. For historical photos, it's often the photos of the ships in drydock, where a photographer could get close and setup a tripod, which preserve the best [detailed images](https://i.imgur.com/yoXzAA4.jpg) of vessels.


&gt;#3. How do you feel about the backlash that the SFW Porn Network has been getting on reddit lately for having 'porn' in the title?

&gt;&gt; Meh. It's reddit. Having *porn* in the title helps emphasize what makes great SFWporn, it's not just about any photo - great SFWporn requires an interestingly and unique topic, well lit, and displayed with glamour and attention to detail. If people are uptight about the name they can start their own subreddits or go to Voat.

&gt;#4. Tell me about you.

&gt;&gt;I've sailed on the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. I'm currently reading *The Disappearing Spoon* by Sam Kean. When I travel to new cities I like to go to the Maritime Museum, if there is one. Favorite concerts I've been to include The Pretenders, Bruce Springsteen,  Bob Dylan, The Grateful Dead, and Ani Difranco. My g-grandfather was an oyster monger.

&gt;#5. What was the last ship you were on?  

&gt;&gt;The Cape May - Lewes Ferry.

When was the last time you were on a ship?

So I could make an announcement without competing with a post about an awesome tiny subreddit. That's why. 


After a long absence we've come back. There is a big difference. We're not doing the interviews with mods anymore. Why? It's super time consuming. And since we our selves are a pretty small sub, there's little pay off. Almost no one to read it. 

Instead, we've taken to linking to awesome tiny subs. We can say what makes them awesome in the title, and people can just click right on through to check them out. This way we can operate the sub and promote tiny subreddits.

Most people who I know and grew up with don't believe in god or religion. The very idea to us is just preposterous. My generation is known for being a bit rebellious, too. So is a lot of our music. Leaving god behind was an easy way to rebel against society. 

I am newly back in college. I went when I was young, had a kid, and then dropped out. Now I am back full-time. I am usually the old guy in class. 

A lot of my professors welcome group discussion. Group participation is a big trend in education these days. Like they're trying to mirror social media in a classroom setting. 

I am really surprised by the number of people who are outspokenly religious. A lot of them call it ""spiritual,"" but it always involves a higher power of some kind, either borrowed from a mainstream religion or a creation of their own mind. 

This is a pretty stark contrast to when I was in college the first time, where a lot of people I interacted with were admittedly atheist. It was common. I say I don't believe in religion now and I get weird looks. 

The other thing too that strikes me as funny is the number of young white guys who have converted to Islam and are outspokenly Muslim. It's like becoming Muslim is the new in-road to joining the counter-culture. 

Finally, it doesn't seem to me like this generation is very rebellious. They're somewhat anti-establishment, but they don't want to not be a part of it. They want to join it in order to change it. I wonder if that has something to do with why they seem more religious to me. 

I want to stress that a lot of these religious people would describe themselves as ""non-religious"" even though they have very highly developed religious beliefs. Again, IMO, their way of joining the counter-culture. 

That said, this is purely anecdotal. I was just wondering if anyone else noticed the same thing.

The game is awesome. It's like [Scorched Earth](http://www.whicken.com/scorch/) except it's real time instead of turn based. It's up to seven players! You can buy all sorts of cool weapons and power ups between levels; nukes, shields, jets, MIRVs, and so on. It's pretty crazy when there are tanks flying around. 

I've always heard how awesome this game is, but I only recently tracked down a copy of Quake. The game is awesome. If you have a Saturn and you haven't played it before then you owe it to yourself. 

The only downside is that there are no computer controlled characters. So you need to get people together. If you don't own a multi-tap, it's still a lot of fun one-on-one.

This week we're bringing the subreddits that are sure to please the eyes, mouse, and controller alike. Let's go!***

#/r/CRTGaming  

**504** *gamers* for **1 month!**

So, what is a CRT? It's a cathode ray tube. You know, like in a ""tube"" TV. The technology has been around for more than half a century. But it has more or less entirely been replaced by high definition LCD monitors over the past decade. So why would anyone want to use a CRT for gaming, and why is there a whole community on reddit that formed around this idea?

Well, if you're like me and like to play retro games, there's nothing better than an old CRT to hook your old consoles up to. Systems like Genesis and NES weren't designed to work with wide screen, HD displays. The result is often stretched, blurry graphics and laggy gaming. There are devices like Framemeister that can fix this problem for you, but they're literally hundreds of dollars. And a nice CRT is next to nothing. At my local Goodwill stores; they're all $1. I got my 36"" Sony Trinitron off of Craigslist for a fraction of what an up scaler would cost me. 

For people who are into retro games and want an authentic experience, to play the games as they were intended to be seen, then owning a CRT monitor, large or small, is the best and most economical way to go. 

All I am telling you now are words. Pictures tell a better story, right? Well, let's look at some. [Sonic 2 is looking fantastic in RGB](https://i.imgur.com/0OXnmFG.jpg).  Check out [Punch-Out](http://i.imgur.com/3yU4TuG.jpg). [F-Zero](http://i.imgur.com/BxZCWGq.jpg), anyone? How about [Mario](http://imgur.com/DQIJaR7)? They look crisp and clean, exactly how they were designed to look when played.  

Sure, those look super nice. But you know what's even more convincing? A side by side comparison. [This is Mario on a LCD vs a CRT.](http://i.imgur.com/A7CtZ0s.jpg) That's the kind of authenticity sought out by members on /r/crtgaming. 

/r/crtgaming is the go to subreddit for learning about which CRTs to buy, which ones are the best, and what the best inputs/connections are (BTW, it's RGB). 

Let's ask the mod team some questions and get some more technical details. 

---

&gt;#1. What is so desirable about CRT?

&gt;&gt;**/u/dak01:** CRTs have many advantages over modern display technology for playing classic video games. The analog video signals generated by older game systems need to be processed before they can be displayed on modern screens. This processing introduces a significant delay and alters the image in undesirable ways. Some CRTs also produce a visual effect referred to as ""scanlines"" which many find appealing. There are dedicated products that can be used with modern displays to minimize these negative effects and simulate scanlines but they are currently very expensive and arguably still inferior. (ex: Framemeister)

&gt;&gt;It's also a matter of authenticity. Modern emulation technology makes playing these games as easy as clicking a link in your web browser. Yet people still go to great lengths and expense to play on original hardware and CRTs. There's something unique about the experience and I recommend it to anyone interested in classic or retro gaming.

&gt;&gt;**/u/WulfsigeAK:** I think CRT's are the way retro games were meant to be played. The artist new the limitations of the displays at the time and designed their characters and backgrounds accordingly. They also don't have any video input lag. Have you every tried to play guitar hero on a projector? Of course an LCD/OLED is faster than a projector. But if your opponent is 10ms faster than you, then your not going be able to react as fast. And then there are lightgun games.

&gt;#2. What are the best CRTs?

&gt;&gt;**/u/dak01:** The idea is to get the best video signal out of your game and send it directly to a CRT without altering it. The very best types of signals available are called RGB and Component (also VGA in some cases). Finding a CRT that supports one of these is very important. There are two main categories to be considered, consumer televisions and professional monitors. High end consumer TVs provide an excellent image and can often be acquired at low or no cost. Professional monitors can be more difficult to acquire but they provide a significant increase in image quality. Sony PVM professional video monitors being among the most popular and desirable. We have created a WIKI page which contains useful information such as model numbers and specifications for a variety of different CRTs useful for gaming. 


&gt;&gt;**/u/WulfsigeAK:** The best CRT's are RGB and/or VGA multi-sync. Arcade Tri-sync monitors.

&gt;#3. What's a good balance for someone who wants both quality and affordability?


&gt;&gt;**/u/dak01:** I recommend a 14"" PVM using RGB. It will provide superb image quality at a great size for your desktop and can be bought and shipped for relatively low cost. (In comparison to other options)
Affordability is not straightforward when it comes to CRTs because they are no longer being manufactured. Depending on where you live you may find a electronics recycler or private seller nearby willing to give you a high quality CRT for next to nothing. Or you might be forced to pay a high price online and have one shipped. It all depends on availability in your area and luck.

&gt;&gt;**/u/WulfsigeAK:** Trinitron's with S-Video would be about the best quality for price as you can find one locally for next to nothing. (most just want them gone to make room) If you want to make the leap to RGB then an 8""-14"" would be a good option. 19""+ are not too expensive either ($75), its the shipping cost that will hit your wallet the hardest.

&gt;#4. Your sub took off pretty fast for such a niche topic. To what do you attribute that to?

&gt;&gt;**/u/dak01:** I think there was a lack of information about this subject on reddit and online in general. While at the same time there are countless subs and websites dedicated to retro gaming. When I first became interested in this subject, google led me to niche gaming forums where I read through individual posts for anything I could find. I eventually found some very helpful and knowledgeable people on sites like the shmups and Neo Geo forums, retrorgb.com, and others. (links are on the sub) I though reddit would be a perfect place to have a community that can focus on CRTs regardless of which classic system you like. Initially we posted all the research and links we had gathered and I think people found it helpful. Also many gaming subs were nice enough to let me post links promoting the sub and I think that helped a lot.

&gt;&gt;**/u/WulfsigeAK:** I really don't know how it took off so fast. I've always loved CRT's and i'm glad that there are others who also into playing retro games the way they were meant to.

&gt;#5. What are some of your favorite posts?

&gt;&gt;**/u/dak01:** My favorites are always the stories of people searching and finding something great for cheap. We recently had a post where a first time buyer stumbled upon a treasure trove of 9 high quality PVMs nearby for a very cheap price and took them all home. Beginners luck... The search for a CRT can be a fun part of the process if you have the patience for it.

&gt;&gt;**/u/WulfsigeAK:** My Favorite posts are people who just got their 1st RGB monitor and can see with their own eyes what all the hype is about. I like photos of setups with all their consoles hooked up. I also like when people post questions about issues they are having, if I can help someone getting it resolved, then they can help someone else with the same issue later down the line.

&gt;#6. Do you worry about CRTs becoming more expensive or harder to find if more people become aware of them?

&gt;&gt;**/u/dak01:** I think the more people appreciate them the better it is for everyone because that means fewer CRTs will be discarded as trash and end up in a landfill or dump.



&gt;#7. What should you not use a CRT for? 

&gt;&gt;**/u/WulfsigeAK:** One word; Fishtank.

I really have to give it up to the mod team. Building a subreddit is hard. And here, in just a month, they've gone from zero users to more than 500 while maintaining an active community. Just 500 subscribers might not seem like a lot. But it really is when you consider how niche the subject it. They're also one of the newest members of the [Retro Gaming Network](http://www.reddit.com/r/RetroGamingNetwork/wiki/network#wiki_general/). It really is a fantastic sub. 

If you like retro gaming you should check this sub out. Period.

My Genesis that I got for Christmas in 1992 was my first console. I got a 32X in 1994 for Christmas, and I love it, hence my user flair here. A year or three ago I added a first generation Sega CD to the mix creating my [Sega Tower of Power^^TM](http://imgur.com/a/zT667) for the first time. 

So, anyways... My eleven-year-old son in into football thanks to my step-dad. He kicks my ass in Madden '16. But I kick his ass in NFL 2K. He also likes making YouTube videos and wants to do something other than Minecraft. So he had this idea to make a series about football games throughout history. I have a few old football games due to buying lots and such, but not that many. So we went to the local game store and bought a dozen old football games for a few dollars. Several of them were for Genesis. 

I connect my Tower of Power^^TM up to my television and there's a problem. The game doesn't work. I try another. No good. I grab one off of my shelf. Nada. Fuck. The Sega CD boot screen is freezing up too. So I decide to disconnect the Sega CD. 

It's important to know that when you're running a model 1 Sega CD the L/R audio comes from the Sega CD and only the video comes from the Genesis, or in my case, the 32X. 

I get the Sega CD removed. Clean up all the connections. Pop another game in. No sound. Oh god. My childhood Genesis isn't working. I try more games. No sound. 

Okay, maybe it's the 32X. I remove it, connect the model 1 Genesis via RF (because I don't have a model 1 A/V cable) and it works fine. 

I wonder if the 32X has a problem. I run it through my model 2 Genesis using the same A/V cables as before, and it works fine. There's sound. Okay. I connect it back up to the model 1 Genesis. No sound. Shit. 

I decide to try one more thing. I thought it was weird that there was sound on the Sega CD boot screen, so I used a Y audio cable to connect the headphone jack stereo output directly the L/R audio input on the television and use the A/V for video only. Pop in Sonic 1. ""SEEEGAAAAA!"" Huh. 

Then I reconnected the Sega CD and everything worked fine. Not sure why the Sega CD was acting jankey in the first place. I might've had the 10v Sega CD power supply in the Genesis, and the 9v Genesis power supply in the Sega CD. Not sure if that would do it though. Also maybe cleaning fixed it. Could've been a connecting thing. 

But now I am left with the fact that there's definitely damage to my Genesis. I have no idea how long it's been broken since I haven't run the audio via A/V in a while, not since I got the model 1 Sega CD. I also noticed that it gets really hot underneath it. For the life of me I can't remember if that's normal and I am just noticing it now, or it's a symptom of the problem. 

Since it's my first console it's irreplaceable to me. Fortunately I do have a work around for now. Also I have four other consoles capable of playing Genesis games. 

In the end it turned out that the two Genesis football games I bought just don't work. The random game I pulled off of my shelf to test also happened to be dirty. Had that not happened, then I wouldn't have ever noticed there was a problem. 

My Genesis isn't totally broken, so it's not a full nightmare scenario, but it is broken somewhat. For some reason I never really thought it would happen. It's by far not my most valuable console. Not even close to being the oldest one I have. But it is the one that means the most to me.

This week we're bringing the subreddits that are sure to please the eyes, mouse, and controller alike. Let's go!***


#/r/gaminggifs 

**6,710** *kick ass gamers* watching gaming gifs for **3 years!**

Although /r/gaminggifs has been around for three years, it really didn't take off until about seven months ago. One of the things that really helped it grow is right at the time it ""relaunched"" is that /r/gaming started allowing gifs. Plus a short-lived reddit sidebar ad didn't hurt. 

What can I say about /r/gaminggifs? What you'll find there is exactly what you would expect. The title says it all. It's a subreddit for GIFS and it's about GAMING. So the posts are entirely gifs related to gaming. You probably figured that out by now. /r/gaminggifs is a features a nice cross of the kinds of things you'd find in /r/gaming, /r/GamePhysics, and /r/retrogaming. There's something for everyone. 

Let's take a look at some of the popular posts:

* [What I'd do with a Portal gun](http://i.imgur.com/dLR1JNp.gif)
* [A good time for a bathroom break](http://i.imgur.com/8b99Vxj.gif)
* [No more stunt jumps in my neighborhood](http://www.gfycat.com/DefiniteFearlessCobra) 
* [This game just got a little dark](http://i.imgur.com/BNB2QUV.gifv)
* [Need a lift, officer?](http://i.imgur.com/4XYMSLy.gif)

* [Sup?](http://i.imgur.com/sSRlE91.gifv)

Well, I think that's enough of that. Did you find something you like yet? Check out the sub. That's only a small sample. 

But before you do, read what the mods had too say.

&gt;#1. Why are you so fucking awesome?

**/u/siouxsie_siouxv2:**  I'm kind of a big deal on a fairly irrelevant social media site.

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:**  I saved a litter of puppies from a fire.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Aerron:** Gaminggifs is so fucking awesome because 90% of redditors play games and have a 20 second attention span. It's a marriage made in cyberspace!


&gt;&gt;**/u/dystopika:**  It's really the community that makes a space truly awesome.

&gt;#2. What's your favorite post?

**/u/siouxsie_siouxv2:**  Of all time? No idea. In /r/gaminggifs? Still no idea.

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:**  [U-Posts](http://i.imgur.com/wmcU3UD.png)

&gt;&gt;**/u/Aerron:** My favorite post is the one I lean on when I'm supposed to be working.

&gt;&gt;**/u/dystopika:**  I love the gifs of older, forgotten games that don't get as many upvotes.

&gt;#3. GIF or JIF?

**/u/siouxsie_siouxv2:**  GIF

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:**  http://i.imgur.com/XxiVQ8F.gifv

&gt;&gt;**/u/Aerron:** This shit ain't peanut butter.

&gt;&gt;**/u/dystopika:**  [Clearing throat.](http://i.imgur.com/TZcrZq3.gif)  

&gt;&gt;I know it's a hopelessly unpopular stance on reddit but it's pronounced ""JIF"". Like the creator of the format intended. I realize that ""graphics"" has a hard ""g"" sound. ""SCUBA"" stands for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus: do you pronounce it ""scubbuh"" because ""underwater"" has a short ""u"" sound? No, you don't. Because an acronym's pronunciation isn't slavish to the words it's composed of.
What are your other favorite subs?

&gt;#4. What are your other favorite subs?

**/u/siouxsie_siouxv2:**  /r/HighQualityGifs is my favorite subreddit. And the other 600 subs I mod all tie for second.

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:**  I've been really enjoying Firehouse Subs on my lunch breaks.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Aerron:** I refuse to name them in public.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Editor's Note: Speculate away! 

&gt;&gt;**/u/dystopika:**  /r/photoshopbattles is such a glorious way to lose hours of productivity. And I'd like to offer an unsolicited shout-out to /r/80s_sandwich.

&gt;#5. Who do you think will win over on /r/giftournament? 

**/u/siouxsie_siouxv2:**  /u/guygoald of course!


&gt;#6. Why are you wasting our time?

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:**  Because it's fun.

&gt;&gt;&gt;**/u/siouxsie_siouxv2:** /r/GIFing0Fucks

&gt;#7. Why did the chicken cross the road?


&gt;&gt;**/u/Aerron:** To show the possum it could be done.

Back when it was called Retro VGS I interviewed Mike Kennedy and he lied to my face. 

First there was the failed IndieGoGo campaign. Then the project came back with all news specs as Coleco Chameleon. I thought it seemed legit. A less ambitious project with maybe some corporate backing from River West Brands. 

Then there was the NYC Toy Fair. I was probably one of the only people who hadn't written this console off by then. But when Mike showed a SNES Jr. in a Jaguar shell, that was it for me. The fact that they never even addressed it is insane. That was my last straw. 

A few days ago Mike showed a new prototype of the Chameleon in a clear shell. I knew this was too good to be true. It only took a few days for internet sleuths to reveal that it was just some fucking capture card. Mike took the damning pic off of Facebook and still hasn't responded. 

I don't think Mike set out to lie. He really wanted to build this. And it was a good idea and it would've been cool. All these homebrews on one console with subsidized carts? Neat. 

But having and idea and having a product are two totally different things. You have to have the money and skill to turn the idea into a product. Anyone can have an idea. Few can make it into a product. And an even smaller number will be able to bring that product to market with any measure of success. 

Mike is a guy who had a good idea and no idea what the fuck he was doing. So when he couldn't deliver instead of telling people he needed more time, he perpetrated a fraud. And when he got caught instead of owning up to it he lied again. 

Basically, I think it's time to face facts that this thing will never be real. And if it is real, it won't be in the form of a crowd-sourced project. No one in their right mind would back such a campaign. 

The only way I'd ever buy this is if I went into a store and saw one on the shelf. I'd still feel bad for supporting Mike in any way. But I do like owning weird failed consoles. And if this were to ever go to retail I think it'd look nice on my shelf sitting next to my Mattel HyperScan, Tiger Game.com, RCA Studio II, and of course my Atari Jaguar. 

So feel free to trash and make fun of Retro VGS/Coleco Chameleon/River West/Mike here all you want. ",ColecoChameleon,About this sub,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColecoChameleon/comments/48mite/about_this_sub/

I use eBay primarily to buy and sell retro video games. 

Recently I sold a video game, *Guardian Heroes* for Sega Saturn. It was a BIN for what I would consider a reasonable price. It sold within a few hours. Payment was received immediately, and it shipped the next business day. 

I attempted to use my PayPal debit card and I was declined. I attempted to make an online transaction using my PayPal balance, and I was also declined. I was very confused by this because I had just made a sale. 

I logged into PayPal to find that the funds are on hold. 

I've never had a payment be held on PayPal ever in the past almost 16 years. 

I called PayPal customer service and I spoke with three managers. That's how many it took me to get a straight answer. 

What came out of the conversation is that PayPal has updated their security policy and that sales of ""collectors"" video games and consoles now have a very high potential to trigger a security flag. I've heard of this happening recently to other game sellers too. But they thought it had something to do with their account. It doesn't. 

As a person who primarily deals in retro video games, this is devastating. What makes it worse is that there really is not a good alternative to either eBay or PayPal. If you want to sell something fast, reach and international audience, then eBay is really the only option, as its main competitors were all dispatched years ago. There also isn't really any good alternative to PayPal for eBay transactions. 

Here's the short version of how the new policy affects ""collector"" video games: 

If your sale triggers PayPal's criteria, which I am told is extensive, then the payment to your account will be placed on hold until two to three business days after the buyer has received the item. 

That in and of itself is pretty crappy. But here's what makes it worse. 

PayPal will not release shipping portion of the payment either. So if you're doing a big sale, or selling heavy items, then you need to 100 percent come out of pocket. 

This is just unacceptable to me. 

If this has happened to you then you can call PayPal's customer service department, complain online, or write them at:

* 110v to 220v converter 
* Several adapters that converts SCART to A/V out
* Two PAL/SECAM to NTSC converters 

Okay, the console powers on and works fine. Docs are in both French and Spanish. I bought it from the UK. It was unopened. No idea if it's PAL or SECAM. 

I have three SCART/AV adapters. One has a switch that has Input/Output on it. When I use this one I get audio out. The second adapter doesn't have the switch and does nothing. The third is an actual cable with SCART one one side and A/V on the other. It also does nothing. 

I tried a more expensive PAL/SECAM converter, but it does only HDMI out and my retro gaming TV doesn't have HDMI-in, But I tried it on my laptop and I get nothing. I also tried it on my Trinitron with an HDMI to A/V cable and nothing. 

So, I am kind of at a loss, here. 

My last shot will be to try the Amstrad monitor cable. I bought on from the UK and is modded to do A/V out. Then I'll try to run that to a converter. 

Any ideas of how I can get video on this thing?

Second Prize: $10 Amazon gift certificate 

Third Prize: 1 month of reddit gold

Rules:

1. Post a link or a self-post of the gaming item you've owned the longest. Not the oldest thing you've owned. But the thing you've had for the most time. DO NOT make your submission in this thread. 

2. Put [Contest 5] in the title. If your forget to, then just PM the mods and we'll flair your post appropriately. 

3. **Your reddit username must be visible in the post.** Bolded because it's being missed. You can write it down on a piece of paper or something. 

4. The item doesn't need to be retro. If you're younger and the thing you owned the longest is a GameCube or Xbox 360, that's fine. 

The contest begins... Right now. It ends in the afternoon of Friday, February 26. 

Winners will not be confirmed by upvotes alone, but by creativity and additional details (like the story behind it). 

Our mods will vote for the winner. Also mods can participate but are not eligible to win. 

Edit: Due to the popularity of the contest, the first prize has been updated and a second prize has been added!",retrogaming,Contest 5 - The gaming item you've owned the longest,https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/46h8wj/contest_5_the_gaming_item_youve_owned_the_longest/

These posts aren't super great for a few reasons.

1. The matches are temporary. People who are interested might not see the post until too late. 
2. The matches are temporary. The posts are no longer valid after the game ends. 
3. It causes modding work to remove expired posts. 
4. A bunch in a row clutters the sub. 

**Proposal: Notification System for Xlink Kai Matches**

Would you like to get a notification each time there's an Xlink Kai match? I can easily set that up. 

* It would require people who want notifications to accept a mod position. 
* It would require people who set up matches to accept a mod position and send a PM. 

When there's a match then everyone who is signed up will get a PM on reddit. 

Is this something anyone would be interested in? 

Or would you rather see the posts?

If implemented, we'd disallow posts to the sub about matches. People would need to use the notification system.

On that list, **most** subs are represented by a screenshot of a video game. 

The first person to name all of the screenshots **wins a $10 gift certificate to Amazon.com.** 

If no one gets them all by, say, Monday morning, then the person  to name the most will win. 

If you put it a good effort and don't win, then second prize will be reddit gold.

*20,087* people doing *just their job* for **2 years!**

Sometimes shit is just not your job. You have a task, you do it well, but the overall product isn't fantastic because somebody else failed in doing their part. It happens all of the time. 

For example, [this plumber](http://imgur.com/xHNoS7Y) did his job flawlessly, but he's not the clock mover. Someone else failed in their task. 

[Here we can see the road painter did his job](https://i.imgur.com/78GWZWF.jpg), but it wasn't his job to move the bike. [Here's another example](http://imgur.com/ZTlcrHz) where a highly skilled road painter executed his task flawlessly. But animal control failed to clean up beforehand. Just like the litter picker-uppers didn't do what they were supposed to do [here](http://imgur.com/jzhIvZc).

[This guy](http://i.imgur.com/6McnTYT.jpg) had one job; to hang a handicap sign. But it wasn't his job to make the door wheelchair accessible. [This guy's job](https://i.imgur.com/yv1JvcQ.jpg) was to put the candy in the machines, not to open the bags. 

Work orders don't make sense all of the time. But it's not always your job to question them. [Put the bench here?](http://i.imgur.com/mZgp64U.jpg) Okay. [The railing crosses this bike path?](http://imgur.com/27dbI5D) Whatever. Making sure the plans made sense was not my job. Right? Right. 

For more, I spoke with moderator /u/donthurtthisguy.

&gt;#1. Which ""job"" posted to your sub would you least like to do?

&gt;&gt; Easily [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NotMyJob/comments/42i33i/piss_fountain_xpost_from_rthatshitsfunny/) one. I can't think of a way this is going to be resolved without me covered in urine. 


&gt;#2. Most like to do?

&gt;&gt; [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/NotMyJob/comments/3tq5sd/hey_can_you_put_this_shirt_on_that_mannequin/) may as well have been me. I've worked that kind of job and I've done things exactly like it. Whoever did that is my spirit animal.

&gt;#3. How'd this sub get started?

&gt;&gt; For that one you'd have to ask /u/ani625 I didn't create it, but it was dead when I found it. I thought the sub had potential so I asked if he'd mind help moderating it and he kindly invited me.


&gt;#4. Is reddit literally your job?

&gt;&gt; Not quite, though I do a fair bit of it at work. I'm a data analyst which is actually more interesting than it sounds. It helps that I work for a company with only a handful of employees. When I accomplish something it actually makes me feel like I've made a difference instead of just finding number for a faceless corporation.

&gt;#5. What's the most notmyjob thing you've ever done?

&gt;&gt;  This is the best one I can think of at the moment. I worked the gate at a major campground. If the internet or power went out we were supposed to write everything down that happened so it could be put in the computer when it came back up. If someone came in during this magical time without a reservation, I'd let them in for free and tell them to be gone before they did their rounds in the morning.

So, what's not your job?

I have a spreadsheet that I use to track what games I own, the value of each game, and the condition. 

Each game platform has its own tab, and there are 85 tabs. 

I have a separate tab that I use called ""stats"" where I pull data that calculates the number of games per system, the value of games per system, et cetera. 

The only problem is that I want to be able to see all of the games I own on one tab so I can sort them by value across all 85 systems. 

The solution I use right now is that every time I add games to any of the 85 other tabs I copy/past them to an ""All Games"" tab. 

What I'd ideally like to happen is that if I enter a new game into the tab for any system it'll automatically be entered into the ""All Games"" tab. 

I am pretty much stuck on this problem. I've tried messing around with VB solutions, but I haven't been able to get anything to work right. 

**TL;DR** Basically, when I enter a new line on other tabs I want that like to be automatically added to one specific tab. 

I hope that makes sense. 

Please help! Thank you!

Comics are stories told with pictures and words. The origins of comics dates back thousands of years. /r/comics is a subreddit dating back eight years, which is like thousands of years in reddit time. 

The kind of comics we're talking about here are not comic books, rather the kind that is similar to what you grew up reading in the news paper. It's also not for rage comics. That's a whole other sub. 

Often times the stories that comics tell are funny. They can brighten our days.

I bet you're smiling already. 

Comics aren't just for the laughs, though. They're also for feels and to give a more profound message.

You're probably still smiling. 

/r/comics is a place for comics that tell any kind of a story. It's for people who want to post comics they found or ones they made. If you message the mods you can get a special artist flair. Of course, it's also for people like me who just enjoy reading comics. 

For more on the sub I spoke with the mods. 


---

&gt;#1. What is your favorite webcomic?

&gt;&gt;**/u/ani625**: Cyanide &amp; Happiness. I also like Savage Chickens.

&gt;&gt;**/u/reverend_green1**: That's a tough one. I think right now I'd go with Oglaf.

&gt;&gt;**/u/JakeTheHawk:**  Jim Benton Cartoons


&gt;#2. As a mod of /r/comics, what kinds of situations do you have to handle the most?

&gt;&gt;**/u/ani625**: Mostly flairing artists and dealing with whiners/complainers.

&gt;&gt;**/u/reverend_green1**: I handle modqueue, modmail, and flair. Sometimes I even ban people if they break our rules!


&gt;&gt;**/u/JakeTheHawk:**  I assign user flair


&gt;#3. Can you define your subreddit in one sentence?

&gt;&gt;**/u/ani625**: Where everybody knows your name.

&gt;&gt;**/u/reverend_green1**: We like comics.

&gt;&gt;**/u/JakeTheHawk:**  Lots of funnies, occasional sads, and confused with r/comicbooks.


&gt;#4. How did you come to enjoy comics?

&gt;&gt;**/u/ani625**: I've always been a fan of comics, and was got involved in the sub ever since I signed up on reddit. It's also the 1st sub I got modded to.

&gt;&gt;**/u/reverend_green1**: I've always liked comics, used to read them in the paper every day before school when I was younger. Now I generally stick to webcomics.

&gt;&gt;**/u/JakeTheHawk:**  I've been reading comics since I was a kid. No clue what my first one was, but it was definitely something out of the newspaper. And for super heroes, I'd go to the antiques store with my grandma as a kid and there was a box just filled with old issues for maybe ten cents a piece.


&gt;#5. I asked him to make up a question and answer it. 

&gt;&gt;**/u/ani625**: http://i.imgur.com/eepBtL9.gifv

&gt;#6. Why don't you call more often?


&gt;&gt;**/u/reverend_green1**: I'm busy mom, let me live my life.


&gt;#7. Who is your daddy and what does he do? 



&gt;&gt;**/u/JakeTheHawk:**  Mike, and he makes machines be not broke.

So was wasn't super happy that it wasn't able to connect to wifi. The troubleshooting on Xbox.com said it was a hardware defect and it had to be sent back. But working with Xbox support we were able to fix it. 

Here are the steps we took:

&gt;Let us start with cleaning the console cache. On your Xbox home screen, please go to settings&gt;&gt; all settings&gt;&gt; Disc &amp; Blu ray&gt;&gt;under Bluray click Persistent Storage&gt;&gt;Clear persistent Storage.

This didn't do anything. 

&gt;Kindly go to settings&gt;&gt; all settings&gt;. network&gt;&gt; network settings&gt;&gt; advance settings&gt;&gt; alternate mac address&gt;&gt; clear alternate mac address. It will restart the console.

Also didn't do anything. 

&gt;Thank you. now please toggle the network offline., settings&gt;&gt;all settings&gt;.network&gt;&gt; network settings&gt;. GO OFFLINE

&gt; Then do a power drain.  Please turn off your console, unplug all cables (including kinect if available) and unplug the power cable from the power outlet or wall socket. Wait for 3 minute until the power supply drain.

This seemed to do the trick. 

&gt; You may now set up your console and turn it on. Then  go online,settings&gt;&gt; all settings&gt;. network&gt;.network settings&gt;. go online

I actually didn't have to do this last one. When the console came back on it automatically connect to XBL. 

It worked. So glad I didn't have to send back a five week old console. 

I am not sure if just the last step did it or if it was a combination of things, but I couldn't find this entire list of steps anywhere, so I thought I'd share it here since it did work for me.

**12,145** people calling out *real conspiracies* for **1 year!**

See the title. Conspiracies do exist. But they're often over looked in favor of more fantastic conspiracy theories that are nonsense, but better capture the imagination. 

My personal favorite conspiracy is how [Republican members of the House of Representatives capped the size of the legislative body in 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reapportionment_Act_of_1929) in order to prevent the opposition party from gaining more seats. Before this point the House had increased in size along with the population. In my personal opinion this under-representation of of the people in the federal government has spiraled out of control leading to the many partisan political crises that America faces today. 

The members of /r/actualconspiracies' community have compiled a great many examples of conspiracies that are real which have been confirmed by the mod team. I'd like to list for you some popular examples from the last year. 

The most popular post on the sub is a [self-post](https://www.reddit.com/r/actualconspiracies/comments/2zntsy/user_creates_over_twenty_accounts_controls_over_a/) from /u/duckvimes_, where he detailed how one user created a network of alt accounts in order to push Neo Nazi, Holocaust denying agenda. That is a very meta example. 

Of course, most consparicies don't have to do with reddit. A lot have to do with the U.S. government. The most popular in that category is a post about[ the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA Torture](https://www.reddit.com/r/actualconspiracies/comments/2ouyfw/wikipedia_summarizes_the_findings_of_the_senate/), which details a conspiracy perpetrated by the CIA to cover up torture by giving false information to both the media and other government agencies, proving yet again that even the government cannot trust the government. 

Corporations, of course, are no stranger to conspiracies either. Walgreens, GNC,  and others [Knowingly sold herbal supplements that didn't even have the ingredients printed on the label](https://www.reddit.com/r/actualconspiracies/comments/2uqj5a/washington_post_reports_on_how_80_of_supplements/). And we all know how [Volkswagen deliberately cheated on U.S. air pollution tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/actualconspiracies/comments/3lo80w/20092015_bloomberg_reports_on_how_volkswagen/).


The sub has a lot more actual conspiracies to comb through. I encourage you to visit it and discover some more. 

But now, let's chat with the mods to find out more. 

---

&gt;#1. What is the most batshit crazy true conspiracy you know of?


&gt;&gt;**/u/duckvimes_:**  I don't know if lobbying fits the dictionary definition for ""conspiracy"", but it's definitely pretty damn close. Corporate interests really do have a lot of power in the political process, and I think it really needs to be reigned in.

&gt;&gt;**/u/confluencer:** The 2003 invasion of Iraq, wherein the world’s greatest superpower invaded and overthrew a major sovereign nation it was previously allied with based upon entirely fabricated evidence and the organized manipulation of the media by a handful of conservative psychopaths with zero understanding of what they were doing.

&gt;&gt;Their use of those who died on 9/11 as some kind of rallying cry truly sickens me.

&gt;&gt;Their actions lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, including thousands of our own soldiers, many trillions of tax dollars wasted, a massive blow out in our debt load, the resurgence of terrorist organizations in the Middle East, and get this, the administration (and by extension, party) that brought this to fruition wasn't reduced to rubble for what I can safely say has been the greatest fuck up of the 21st century. Well, that is until they oversaw the implosion of the global economy.

&gt;&gt;Now that’s fucking crazy.

&gt;&gt;It’s not just that it was done, or that it was done recently, or that it was done at such breathtaking scale.

&gt;&gt;No, it’s fucking crazy because they got away with it. It’s a work of fucking art.

&gt;#2.  With the level of conspiracies that exist in the world, do you believe that democracy or republican government can function?


&gt;&gt;**/u/duckvimes_:**  Yes. It's not all black and white--we can have a functional democracy even if there are some small issues. It might not be perfect, but there's a middle ground between a perfectly democratic government and North Korea.

&gt;&gt;**/u/confluencer:** I believe that democratic governance is one of the only forms that can robustly withstand the massive number of actual conspiracies that fill the world today.

&gt;&gt;Despotic dictatorships are awash with actual conspiracies, usually of the ruling party, and there is often no easy way to fight back. The operators are unknown, what they do is secret and the public has zero insight into what they are doing. Just look at North Korea and you’ll understand this.

&gt;&gt;Does that mean the US and its Western counterparts have nothing to improve upon? Hell to the fucking no. Our sub is filled to the brim with actual conspiracies located in these countries, precisely because we can see what is going on. We still have a long way to go.

&gt;&gt;What it does mean is that you can only push back and fix problems upon which you can shine a light. If you don’t investigate and inspect cracks in buildings, they fall, and so it goes with civilization.

&gt;&gt;If those in power snuff out the ability to shine a light on the cracks in our society, then the only solution is to light the edifice on fire.

&gt;#3. What's a good example of what to NOT post to /r/actualconspiracies?

&gt;&gt;**/u/duckvimes_:** Grainy YouTube videos.

&gt;&gt;**/u/confluencer:** Anything that doesn't follow our rules. We don't tolerate any stupid shit.


&gt;#4. Tell us about you and why you got involved in this sub.

&gt;&gt;**/u/duckvimes_:**   I've always been interested in conspiracy theories. Not as someone who believes them, but as someone who laughs (and occasionally sighs/facepalms/sobs) at their stupidity. Favorite is the Hollow Earth theory. I mod also mod /r/isrconspiracyracist and /r/TopMindsOfReddit, which both discuss conspiracy theories and conspiracy theorists. As far as getting involved in this sub, though, I received an invitation after putting together this graph showing how /r/holocaust is controlled by racists and neo-Nazis.

&gt;&gt;**/u/confluencer:**  I love investigative journalism, massive in depth reports, historical books and long articles. I like understanding what is actually going on, you know with evidence contextualized with history, an understanding of humanity, game theory and a skeptical mind.

&gt;&gt;I got sick and tired of all the fucking bullshit being spouted by idiots about pointless, irrelevant, and fake conspiracies, so I founded this sub to talk about shit that actually matters.

&gt;&gt;Civilization is the total sum of actual conspiracies run by people, both big and small, incompetent and competent, malevolent and benevolent, and it is up to us as responsible, intelligent, skeptical and discerning citizens of the world to understand, discuss, and fight back against the absolute clusterfuck of fuckery that is going on in the world today using the scientific method as our razor.


&gt;&gt;I got involved with this because I want to take back “conspiracy” from the loons and the fuckwits and bring it back to its original meaning, as a term of art in law concerning the sustained and deliberate organization by members of a group in secret to commit an immoral and illegal act.

&gt;&gt;The world is filled with actual conspiracies that are attempting to fuck over the the futures of billions and it’s up to us to crush them, however we can.

&gt;&gt;Every little bit counts.

&gt;#5. What have been your favorite submissions to /r/actualconspiracies?

&gt;&gt;**/u/confluencer:** There have been so many great ones, but here are a few of my favorites

It's about the same cost as a PS4 or an Xbox One with two extra controllers and two games. I just bought my son an Xbox One for Christmas with an extra controller and five games, and I spent a lot more than I'd spend on Oculus. It also comes with several games and a controller, so it's unlike the current gen of consoles where you need to spend at least $50 more to get the game you want. If you're like me you'll have to spend a few hundred more because there are multiple games you want. Approx. $500 is about what I spent on the original Xbox, by the way, after picking up a few games and extra controllers. Point being, being an early adopter of new tech is always expensive. 

This is brand new tech coming to the market, so of course it's expensive. It's also a lot less money than Google Glass, and it's far more useful for gaming. 

I'd also like to remind people that $600 for Oculus is about the same price as a Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge and other higher end smart phones. Everyone is so used to paying for their phones via contract that they forget how much it costs. If you have decent credit you can charge the Oculus and you'll probably pay less in the long run then you would for a high end smart phone by the time you pay it off through your carrier. 

I mod /r/VirtualBoy so I have an alert set up for when people mention Virtual Boy on reddit. I am getting bombarded lately with posts comparing Oculus to Virtual Boy. These are not comparable at all. Virtual Boy failed for several reasons, chief among them is that it didn't live up to what Nintendo promised. It was supposed to be ""Virtual Reality."" It wasn't. It had red and black monochromatic display. It wasn't portable despite being advertised as being so. Few of its games took advantage of the 3D effect enough to warrant them being on a 3D console. Further, the chief complaint with Oculus is the cost. Virtual Boy's $179 price wasn't that high for 1995. Consider that PlayStation launched at $299 and Saturn came out at $399. There are not parallels here. Unlike Virtual Boy, Oculus does exactly as it's advertised to do and it has support from developers.

The day after Christmas I took my son to get a new keyboard for his new computer that he got for Christmas, not being satisfied with the spare one that I had. Driving back home from Fry's Electronics we pass by the police station. It's less than half a mile from my house. It was all roped off with caution tape, and the road off to the side of the main road was closed. 

I thought it was weird that they'd have their own place roped off like that. Having been a government employee before I figured it was a bomb threat. We used to get a lot of those and we'd just either be locked down or evacuated. At least four or five times a year. 

Nope, it wasn't that. Just a dude throwing rocks at the police station and the vehicles. They have these big rocks the size of grapefruit out front of it for decoration. It's super common in Arizona landscaping. 

Anyways, in the police station where the police work, the police station I used to get high in front of when I was in high school, instead of tasing the guy, or getting a beanbag gun, or just moving back a few few feet,  they just shot him. Seems like a nonproportional response. 

Dude was a 41 year old white guy, so I guess it won't be national news. But just goes to show that police stupidity doesn't always see race. Of course the guy was an idiot and you shouldn't throw rocks at police. But it's dumb to shoot someone armed with rocks, IMO. 

I don't usually give a fuck about these stories, and I can't say that I give much of a fuck about this one, but the fact that it was literally on my street is a little uncomfortable.

There's an audio jack on the front that he'd like to use his ear buds in. 

Both the audio jack on the back and the one in the front I can't get to work. 

When I go to ""Playback devices"" Windows sees them, says they are working and that all drivers are up to date, but they're grayed out and I can't select them. 

As I said, audio works fine through the HDMI connection. When I connect headphones via USB those work fine too. 

It's just these two pesky audio jacks. 

I feel like I've run into this problem before on an older version of Windows, either 7 or 8, and was able to fix it. But I've been over and over it and I can't figure out what I am missing.

This is the Tiger Telematics Gizmondo, a handheld video game console that was released in 2005 and discontinued the next year as  the company and its subsidiary, Gizmondo Europe, spiraled into bankruptcy. 

This is the absolute most spectacular failure in gaming history, bar none. It involved organized crime, money laundering, grand theft auto (the crime, not the game), embezzlement, fraud, impersonating anti-terrorism officials, and more. Wired has a [fantastic article](http://www.wired.com/2006/10/gizmondo/) on all of this. 

I haven't played one of these things since 2005 when I first heard of it at that year's E3. I don't even think Gizmondo had a booth. They just had booth babes walking around in car racing inspired outfits asking people to try it out. My impression of it then was that it felt cheap, and I quickly forgot about the $400 handheld. To be fair, it was only $300 if you got a version that included ads that would be delivered to you via a cell network. What a terrible idea. Besides, the PSP was coming out. It was everywhere at the 2005 E3, and it was pretty damn awesome. Game Boy Micro was also there. And, of course, DS had already been released. I never gave the Gizmondo much of a second thought. And I had no idea of how much money had been sunk into this thing. 

Apparently, the big idea behind Gizmondo was to sell expensive GPS tracking devices to parents. The company figured this would work if the kids wanted the devices, so they put them in a game console. In the UK this thing had a pretty big launch from a media perspective. I guess there was a lot of hype there. Gizmondo had its own version of an Apple store in London. In the U.S. the company couldn't get a single major retailer to carry the thing, and it was sold exclusively from a few mall kiosks. 

The device itself is overly complex, and not very comfortable to hold. The position of the L/R buttons is the worst of any console I've ever played, either on a handheld or controller. They're just elevated way above the unit and need to be a lot lower. It uses the diamond button configuration that was then standard and originally popularized by Nintendo. The d-pad is actually pretty good, and the buttons are stiff and responsive, just the way I like them. 

You'll notice that the buttons aren't labeled as numbers or letters. Instead they are stop, play, back, and fast forward. This is because the device was meant to be an all in one thing that played movies and music. There are also a series of buttons on the top of the system called ""piano keys."" These are for volume, brightness, power, a shortcut the the home screen, and a way to check alerts, which are incoming SMS messages. 

Gizmondo is powered by a version of Microsoft's Windows CE. Movies and music would play in Windows Media Player. There was probably a service to download these over a cell network, but you could also connect the Gizmondo to a pc via an included mini USB cable, or just transfer media to an SD card. I find the operating system to be slow, glitchy, and unresponsive. Apparently there are several homebrew versions of the OS that you can upgrade to. 

Speaking of the OS, it's pretty annoying to operate, too. It has a lot of quirks that make no sense and aren't mentioned in the user manual. For example, I had a hard time figuring out how to turn the thing off. When you press the power button a menu comes up and the ""power off"" button was grayed out. I later discovered that you can't turn the thing off if you have a game inserted or if it's charging. It automatically turns on when it's charging. 

Speaking of charging now, the battery sucks because they had to make it unique to the unit. They're also very hard to come by these days. In fact, you can get a Gizmondo with no battery for pretty cheap, thirty dollars or less. But then good luck with it. You can hack another kind of cellphone battery and Frankenstein it to make it Gizmondo compatible. You also can't turn the device off when you charge it. Plug it in to charge and it'll turn itself on. 

Another really annoying thing about Gizmondo is that you can't use it at all unless you have a SIM card installed. When I first got it to take a charge, which I had a hard time doing, all I got was a no sim card error. I don't usually have extra sim cards laying around. But I knew there was one in my Nokia N-Gage so I used that. Fortunately, it doesn't need to actually connect to a network. It requires a sim card for the ad delivery system, for registration, for GPS, and for sending and receiving text messages. The device also has a camera, so you can send picture attachments as well. 

The games themselves come in DVD cases, but they're just on standard SD cards. Each game comes with an SD card holder, similar to N-Gage. The graphics are somewhere between an N64 and a Dreamcast. I don't know if it could've done better, but I kinda doubt it. It doesn't have any sprawling games, either. Every game is either a sports or a puzzle game. Of the few games I've played, some are pretty good. Trailblazer, for example, is really fun and has nice looking graphics. 

Most of the games were developed by Gizmondo or by companies set up by Gizmondo to make games. But EA actually published a few games on this thing as well. They wouldn't support Dreamcast (because Sega refused to give them sports exclusivity), but you can play SSX 3 and FIFA 2005 on this thing. I am not sure how many releases there actually were. Wikipedia lists 14, but I've seen games for sale not on the list. They could've been completed, but unreleased. It's hard to know because there's really very little information about Gizmondo on the net. The fan forums are all gone and no one owned this thing.  It's reported that there are only 25,000 units. 

The last thing I'll say is that the screen size feels small for this era. My Gizmondo is currently sitting next to my PSP, and the contrast of the wide screen on PSP compared to the Gizmondo's much smaller screen just jumps right out at me. Tiger Telematics did announce a wide screen version just before the U.S. release, but the company went bankrupt faster than they could make a new version. 

If you were ever curious about a Gizmondo, there it is. A disastrous handheld clearly designed by committee with few games that tries to do too many things and isn't very comfortable to hold.

To be fair, it was only $300 if you got a version that included ads that would be delivered to you via a cell network. What a terrible idea. Besides, the PSP was coming out. It was everywhere at the 2005 E3, and it was pretty damn awesome. Game Boy Micro was also there. And, of course, DS had already been released. I never gave the Gizmondo much of a second thought. And I had no idea of how much money had been sunk into this thing. 

Apparently, the big idea behind Gizmondo was to sell expensive GPS tracking devices to parents. The company figured this would work if the kids wanted the devices, so they put them in a game console. In the UK this thing had a pretty big launch from a media perspective. I guess there was a lot of hype there. Gizmondo had its own version of an Apple store in London. In the U.S. the company couldn't get a single major retailer to carry the thing, and it was sold exclusively from a few mall kiosks. 

The device itself is overly complex, and not very comfortable to hold. The position of the L/R buttons is the worst of any console I've ever played, either on a handheld or controller. They're just elevated way above the unit and need to be a lot lower. It uses the diamond button configuration that was then standard and originally popularized by Nintendo. The d-pad is actually pretty good, and the buttons are stiff and responsive, just the way I like them. 

You'll notice that the buttons aren't labeled as numbers or letters. Instead they are stop, play, back, and fast forward. This is because the device was meant to be an all in one thing that played movies and music. There are also a series of buttons on the top of the system called ""piano keys."" These are for volume, brightness, power, a shortcut the the home screen, and a way to check alerts, which are incoming SMS messages. 

Gizmondo is powered by a version of Microsoft's Windows CE. Movies and music would play in Windows Media Player. There was probably a service to download these over a cell network, but you could also connect the Gizmondo to a pc via an included mini USB cable, or just transfer media to an SD card. I find the operating system to be slow, glitchy, and unresponsive. Apparently there are several homebrew versions of the OS that you can upgrade to. 

Speaking of the OS, it's pretty annoying to operate, too. It has a lot of quirks that make no sense and aren't mentioned in the user manual. For example, I had a hard time figuring out how to turn the thing off. When you press the power button a menu comes up and the ""power off"" button was grayed out. I later discovered that you can't turn the thing off if you have a game inserted or if it's charging. It automatically turns on when it's charging. 

Speaking of charging now, the battery sucks because they had to make it unique to the unit. They're also very hard to come by these days. In fact, you can get a Gizmondo with no battery for pretty cheap, thirty dollars or less. But then good luck with it. You can hack another kind of cellphone battery and Frankenstein it to make it Gizmondo compatible. You also can't turn the device off when you charge it. Plug it in to charge and it'll turn itself on. 

Another really annoying thing about Gizmondo is that you can't use it at all unless you have a SIM card installed. When I first got it to take a charge, which I had a hard time doing, all I got was a no sim card error. I don't usually have extra sim cards laying around. But I knew there was one in my Nokia N-Gage so I used that. Fortunately, it doesn't need to actually connect to a network. It requires a sim card for the ad delivery system, for registration, for GPS, and for sending and receiving text messages. The device also has a camera, so you can send picture attachments as well. 

The games themselves come in DVD cases, but they're just on standard SD cards. Each game comes with an SD card holder, similar to N-Gage. The graphics are somewhere between an N64 and a Dreamcast. I don't know if it could've done better, but I kinda doubt it. It doesn't have any sprawling games, either. Every game is either a sports or a puzzle game. Of the few games I've played, some are pretty good. Trailblazer, for example, is really fun and has nice looking graphics. 

Most of the games were developed by Gizmondo or by companies set up by Gizmondo to make games. But EA actually published a few games on this thing as well. They wouldn't support Dreamcast (because Sega refused to give them sports exclusivity), but you can play SSX 3 and FIFA 2005 on this thing. I am not sure how many releases there actually were. Wikipedia lists 14, but I've seen games for sale not on the list. They could've been completed, but unreleased. It's hard to know because there's really very little information about Gizmondo on the net. The fan forums are all gone and no one owned this thing.  It's reported that there are only 25,000 units. 

The last thing I'll say is that the screen size feels small for this era. My Gizmondo is currently sitting next to my PSP, and the contrast of the wide screen on PSP compared to the Gizmondo's much smaller screen just jumps right out at me. Tiger Telematics did announce a wide screen version just before the U.S. release, but the company went bankrupt faster than they could make a new version. 

If you were ever curious about a Gizmondo, there it is. A disastrous handheld clearly designed by committee with few games that tries to do too many things and isn't very comfortable to hold.

This is the Tiger Telematics Gizmondo, a handheld video game console that was released in 2005 and discontinued the next year as  the company and its subsidiary, Gizmondo Europe, spiraled into bankruptcy. 

This is the absolute most spectacular failure in gaming history, bar none. It involved organized crime, money laundering, grand theft auto (the crime, not the game), embezzlement, fraud, impersonating anti-terrorism officials, and more. Wired has a [fantastic article](http://www.wired.com/2006/10/gizmondo/) on all of this.

7071,2015-12-21 08:54:21+00:00,self.FuckCongress,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckCongress/comments/3xol8m/congress_rigged_itself_to_usurp_power_from_the/,False,"The Federalist Papers were written in order to convince the American people that a new constitution, the current one, should pass and replace the original U.S. Constitution, the Articles of Confederacy. 

In Federalist No. 52 James Madison wrote, ""As it is essential to liberty that the government in general should have a common interest with the people, so it is particularly essential that the House of Representatives should have an immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the people.""

But the government doesn't... because we're supposed to be a republic. That means the people are supposed to be represented in the government. In our case, via the House of Representatives. But we haven't had representation for decades. 

Why? Because 435 representatives is far too few to provide adequate representation. 

The Constitution was designed to add representatives after each enumeration. This happened until around 1911 with the House of Representatives arbitrarily froze the number at 435. 

The founders foresaw this problem and tried to prevent it with the first proposed amendment to the Constitution, often called Article the First, which would've capped the size of a Congressional district to 50,000. (Yes, the Bill of Rights originally had [twelve amendments](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html), not just the ten that passed.) Now the average size of a CD is 1:750,000, and there are some that are over a million. Of all western democracies the people of United States have the least representation in government.  

James Madison predicted this problem when he wrote the Constitution, as he stated in Federalist No. 55:

1. So small a number of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the public interests; 

2. They will not possess a proper knowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous constituents; 

3. They will be taken from that class of citizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim at a permanent elevation of the few on the depression of the many; 

4.  That as defective as the number will be in the first instance, it will be more and more disproportionate, by the increase of the people, and the obstacles which will prevent a correspondent increase of the representatives. 

As the United States has grown and now that the number of the seats in the House no longer grows with it, each of Madison's predictions have come true. 

1. The House represents not the public but those who buy and sell them. 

2. Members of the House are completely out of touch with average Americans. 

3. Representatives come almost exclusively from the top 1 percent of Americans. 

4. As the population increases the problem is getting worse and worse. The government cannot function. We have no power. The Constitution cannot work. 

So therefore it doesn't matter if you and I vote or don't vote, or who or what we vote for. For it to matter we need to have representation. If we the people were represented we'd have the ability to fire a candidate, SuperPACs and special interests would be powerless, third parties would once again become viable, and so forth and so on. 

The problem is that our ""Representatives"" are slaves. And if they're slaves then what does that make us? Also slaves. The idea that voting is any kind of a choice is an illusion; on the local level or the federal level. Money wins elections alone. 

Until last year I voted in every election. Even on school tax propositions. I was a true believer and I volunteered for a number of political campaigns, and even helped to manage a campaign once. It's just all bullshit. Our representatives are slaves. We're slaves. The people who we work for are slaves. This is really 'farm America,' where we're the crop, and everyone gets to harvest us for our money and for labor. 

Voting can't do anything if the system is defective, as Madison points out. If you want to change it then you need an amendment to the United States Constitution to include a version of Article the First. In order to get that you need a Constitutional Convention. In order to get that you need 34 state legislatures to pass a resolution calling for such a convention. 

I'd suggest something simple, like... *There shall not be less than one representative for every fifty thousand persons.* And then give it a 'Murica-y name, like ""The Essential Liberty Amendment."" 

Really, even if a handful of states were to ratify then it would probably put enough pressure on Congress to make some sort of a change. 

We do that, and I'll vote again. Until then, I am smart enough to know that slaves don't really get a say in the business of their masters. 

Until the Constitution is fixed and intent of is architects is restored, America is, effectively, over. ",FuckCongress,Congress rigged itself to usurp power from the people,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckCongress/comments/3xol8m/congress_rigged_itself_to_usurp_power_from_the/

**21,809** *amateur biologists* shitposting for **1 year!**

Do you know how I know that some dogs disguise themselves as platypuses for tax reason? [Because reddit told me.](https://i.imgur.com/Gx58aJ5.jpg) This is the internet, folks. And the rules of the internet is that the internet doesn't like. Don't believe me? Check your user's manual. 

I think /r/ShittyAnimalFacts is one of the most scientifically accurate and informative subs in all of redditdom. Just check out these facts that you can't find anywhere else!

* [Duck can actually melt](https://i.imgur.com/tGUIBTE.jpg). It's true. There's photographic evidence. How can you even deny it?
* The harmless [tiger moth](https://i.imgur.com/Ytsvt5u.jpg) does a great job of looking like a tiger. 
* [Otters](https://i.imgur.com/QnHNx24.jpg) are frequent mugging victims.
* [Golden retrievers](http://i.imgur.com/4jbot46.gifv) are really marine predators that hunt in packs. You idiots probably think they're really land mammals. Nope, they're seals of the dog family!
* A gecko's body can carry an electric charge of over 100,000 volts. Just watch [this dude](http://i.imgur.com/6H5xVIw.gif) get electrocuted by one! This makes the Geico gekko and Gex really scary to me. 

That's just a sample of the scientifically accurate amazement that you'll find on /r/ShittyAnimalFacts. 

For more, let's talk to the mods.

&gt;#1. How did this sub get started?

&gt;&gt;**/u/IranianGenius:** Kijafa birthed it after a fifteen month pregnancy full of drama, confusion, love-making, more drama, and mystery.

&gt;#2. Show us some of your favorite posts.

&gt;&gt;**/u/pnewell:** [One that's a repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyAnimalFacts/comments/39h26v/golden_retrievers_have_eschewed_sexual/cs3hqi8). [One I particularly like](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyAnimalFacts/comments/2zcm1p/when_times_are_good_and_bellies_are_full/). [One I xposted to /r/aww that frontpage'd](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyAnimalFacts/comments/324c6p/when_frightened_seal_pups_flee_danger_by_curling/). [This one fooled a ton of people](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyAnimalFacts/comments/2yoe45/hawks_can_talk_by_tapping_beaks_one_zoo_taught/). [slowbears](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyAnimalFacts/comments/39l096/slowbears_are_very_affectionate_and_have_been/) and [trashpandas](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyAnimalFacts/comments/3dy0mu/trash_pandas_often_camouflage_themselves_as_herds/)... two of our favorite animals. 

&gt;&gt;**/u/reverend_green1:** [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyAnimalFacts/comments/2dfy3v/popcorn_is_hallucinogenic_for_raccoons/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyAnimalFacts/comments/2dfvik/crows_and_jackdaws_are_the_same_animal_until_they/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyAnimalFacts/comments/2dgcps/birds_arent_real/)

&gt;&gt;**/u/Alantha:** I feel like this is an invasion of my privacy.

&gt;#3. How often do you see people fooled into believing any of this stuff is actually real?

&gt;&gt;**/u/IranianGenius:** All the time.

&gt;&gt;**/u/reverend_green1:** Every once in a while you see someone in the comments that got fooled.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Alantha:** I see it often enough where, as a scientist, I worry about our future.

&gt;&gt;**/u/pnewell:** I get people pretty often. Made /r/shittieranimalfacts to capture those moments, promptly forgot about it...

&gt;#4. Tell us about you.

&gt;&gt;**/u/IranianGenius:** I like ice cream sandwiches.

&gt;&gt;**/u/reverend_green1:** I should be working right now.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Alantha:** I'm a behavioral ecologist who enjoys wasting time here on Reddit answering science questions and occasionally fooling people on our beautiful little sub.

&gt;#5. What subreddits do you recommend?

&gt;&gt;**/u/IranianGenius:** /r/Slygifs, /r/ListofSubreddits, /r/babycorgis, and /r/FunAskReddit. And some shitty sub about animal facts.

&gt;#6. What is best in life? 

&gt;&gt;**/u/Alantha:** To crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women!

**3,588** *trumps trumping* **for 5 days!**

https://i.imgur.com/tGilWYV.png

Here's a subreddit to find out what businessman, reality TV star, and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump J. Trump thinks about any issue you can fathom.  

Wanna see some examples? Of course you do. So here are some!

Q. What would trump say on mental illness?    
A. If they're mentally ill, they should just stop. Just stop doing whats making you ill. Stop doing that. It's not my problem. I can't stop you from thinking things that make you ill, so just don't. Thanks. - [Donald Trump](https://www.reddit.com/user/SynthesisP)  

Q. What are Trump's feelings on Time Magazine's Person of the Year, Angela Merkel?      
A. Angela Merkel is terrible. She's letting in Muslim refugees. Muslims! Did you know that? She's not even tracking them. How do you know which are our enemies? It's terrible. She's terrible. She's telling our children that Muslims are people too. What kind of a leader does that? And I love the Muslims, I love the Arabs, I think they're fun--the sand never gets out of your shoes, you can take it with you everywhere. They're great people but what's more important is I know they're our enemy. I know they're our enemy and I'll shoot them on sight. Or make a deal with them.

Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump. Donald Trump, now there's a Person of the Year. I have great respect for Trump. He's a good friend of mine. But this Angela Merkel business...how are we losing to these people? How? They're letting in Muslims! - [Donald Trump](https://www.reddit.com/user/Vittgenstein)

Q. What is Trump's opinion on Golden State's 23-0 start?     
A. I've been very successful in my life. I'm a very rich person and have made myself great. You can't be great without some failures though. These so-called ""Warriors"" haven't had to work a day in their lives! They just walk onto the field and the other team is so scared, they just give up. But that's not what I'd do. I'd assemble 12 of the best athletes this country has to offer, and not just basketball players, but football players, baseball players, like my good friend Derek Jeter, New York guys with real heart, basically any athlete except soccer players, and we'd go out there and whip those so-called ""Warriors"" and send them back to the socialist distopia that is The Bay Area! Then we'll build a wall around them and make them pay for it! - [Donald Trump](https://www.reddit.com/user/sscspagftphbpdh17)

Q. After Emperor Donald Trump has just exterminated all the Jedi. How does he explain his actions to the people of the galaxy?     
A. I  gave this big, beautiful order, you've never seen an order like this, order 66, a-a-a-and some of my best friends, my really good force sensitive Jedi friends, are saying ""this is a brilliant idea, we think this is a good idea, its the smartest idea anybody has ever had, this is will bring a beautiful, wonderful balance to the force."" - [Donald Trump 
](https://www.reddit.com/user/bearreport57)

Q. What would Trump say to the navy Seals copy pasta?     
A. Navy Seals love me. Love me. Let me tell you, I know some Navy Seals, hell I own a few that I keep in one of my zoos. Terrific creatures. We feed them fish, I've made a lot of money in the fish market Over the years. Those seals waddle up in excitement when they hear my voice. It is a magnificent voice, in all fairness to the seals. - [Donald Trump](https://www.reddit.com/user/kpnitreal)

Now, if that's not amazing enough, I was able to track down The Donald himself, whose reddit username is /u/crazyzach21, and ask him a few questions. 

&gt;#1. Who the hell do you think you are?

&gt;&gt;Look here, I know who I am. The real question is who the hell are you? I wanna know why /r/subredditoftheday isn't just called /r/trumpoftheday because everyday is my day.


&gt;#2. Who the hell does Trump think he is?

&gt;&gt;Please see above answer. I'm a busy man. I don't have time repeating myself 20 times.



&gt;#3. Why the hell does this subreddit exist?

&gt;&gt;It's clear why this subreddit exists. Reddit loves me and I don't blame them! What's not to love? I am the epitome of the American Dream. Self-made billionaire, very successful business man, and future President of the United States of America. These redditors have been inspired to spread the Trump message. I thank them for their commitment.



&gt;#4. What the hell?

&gt;#5. How the hell...

&gt;&gt;I think we are done here sir.

**2,099** *science lovers* for **6 months!**

Did you ever wish there were a sub like /r/todayilearned for your burning need to consume scientific facts? Well, there is! It's only existed for six months, so you may not have heard of it. If you're reading this then you already know that I am talking about /r/ScienceFacts!

What can you find on /r/ScienceFacts? Posts about verifiable science-y stuff only. No pseudoscience. No gifs. Not even image macros. Only links to articles and videos from reputable scientific sources that can be confirmed. 

What can you learn on /r/ScienceFacts? 

I learned that [the aardvark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orycteropodidae) is the only species in its order, making it a very unique little critter. I learned that it's possible to create [renewable energy with steam](http://cen.acs.org/articles/90/i48/Sunlight-Plus-Nanoparticles-Generates-Steam.html). I also learned that boozing while doing coke creates [super cocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaethylene). Maybe don't try that one at home. 

For more on the sub let's talk to the mod team.

&gt;#1. What is your favorite science fact?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Alantha:** It's impossible for me to choose a favorite! I am not even sure I can choose a favorite within one branch of science. There are so many interesting facts out there.

&gt;&gt; I always find the incredibly long lifespans of other organisms to be fascinating. For instance, Methuselah, a bristlecone pine tree from California's White Mountains, is thought to be almost 5,000 years old. Or that some Bowhead whales are still alive today who were attacked by harpooners over 130 years ago (we have records of some with old harpoon scarring). What must that animal be thinking when it sees a ship now? Does it remember?

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:** Uranus is the only planet named for a greek god instead of a roman one. If it had been the roman god, it would have been named ""Caelus"".

&gt;&gt;**/u/remotectrl:** I don't know if I had a favorite *fact*, but my favorite scientific paper is probably [this one about homosexual necrophilia behavior in a mallard duck](http://www.hetnatuurhistorisch.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/documents-nmr/Persberichten/Persberichten/persberichten_2013/DSA8_243-248.pdf). There are a lot of fun titles for bat research papers like [""Bats and Balls""](http://www.life.umd.edu/faculty/wilkinson/WilkMcCrack03.pdf) (about sperm competition), [""Concerns about extrapolating right off the bat](https://www.fort.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/products/publications/23202/23202.pdf) (about population estimates), and [""Bats and Robins""](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3868078?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) (about bats hunting migrating songbirds) that I find really charming as well.

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_Say_I_Say:** If you could fold a piece of paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the observable universe.

&gt;#2. What is your scientific background?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Alantha:** I am a behavioral ecologist by training and education, I have a M.S. in Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology. I currently specialize in insects, but have worked with birds in the past and my B.S. is in Marine Biology. I've also done some mosquito population genetic research and worked for an environmental consulting company for a few years as an ecologist. Currently I just submitted a paper for publication and I am teaching at a state university. Hoping to start a PhD soon.

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:** Computer science :P

&gt;&gt;**/u/remotectrl:** I have a bachelors degree in biology and spent several years as a biological field technician across the US. I've since settled down and use reddit as an educational outreach tool. I also volunteer at my local zoo.

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_Say_I_Say:** I bought a telescope and point it at shiny things in the sky, so, science! Also, I've read like all of Stephen Hawking's books. Ok, maybe 1 1/2 of them, but still, Hawking!

&gt;&gt;**/u/preggit:** I'm a ^^^COMPUTER scientist, I lurk in the background and do the CSS.

&gt;#3. The sub's growth has been exploding. What's responsible about that?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Alantha:** The sub sort of blew up once we went public only a few days ago. I had it private for a few months because I was really busy. I had a popular comment about whales and dolphins hanging out and I mentioned the sub at the bottom. I think that was the spark.

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:** The other mods in this subreddit have been doing a ton more promo than I have.


&gt;&gt;**/u/remotectrl:** /u/alantha!

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_Say_I_Say:** Some people like science and other people like facts. We bring them together and then force them to subscribe through intimidation and blackmail.



&gt;#4. What scientific fact frightens you the most?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Alantha:** Probably my and everyone else's mortality! All organisms must die eventually, we don't have a way around it (yet). The potential to not exist is terrifying to me.

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:** There is a mental disorder called Cotard’s syndrome which the affected person believes they are dead.

&gt;&gt;* eg: There’s the 59-year-old woman who was hospitalized in the United Kingdom after reporting feeling like she was ""a rotting corpse."" She told doctors the blood circulation to her legs was damaged, and her legs were falling off.

&gt;&gt;**/u/remotectrl:** I'm probably most terrified of [~~raccoon~~ trashpanda roundworm](http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/baylisascaris/). Also [gamma ray bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst#Hypothetical_effects_of_gamma-ray_bursts_in_the_past) as a form of existential terror.

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_Say_I_Say:** The lack of any scientific facts about what happens when we die. Do I just cease to exist forever?

&gt;#5. What scientific fact most leaves you in awe?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Alantha:** The vastness of the universe and how we don't know whether it is finite or infinite. I'm not sure which would be more disturbing as truth. It gets me every time to think about how many other solar systems there are out there, yet how so very alone we are even when surrounded by billions of other planets.

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:** Weirdly, for me, I find it incredible that the universe may be finite. There's super interesting theories on whether it's kind of like earth where you'd just end back up where you start, or whether it's like a mobius strip type of situation.

&gt;&gt;**/u/remotectrl:** [The multi-generation monarch butterfly migration](http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/pollinators/Monarch_Butterfly/migration/index.shtml) doesn't make any damn sense to me. HOW DO THEY DO IT? It almost makes me angry how spectacular it is.

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_Say_I_Say:** A teaspoon of material from a neutron star would weigh about 10 million tons.

&gt;#6. What non-science subjects do you enjoy? 

&gt;&gt;**/u/Alantha:** I'm a pretty big Star Wars fan! I am super excited for the next movies. I also enjoy running, hiking, video games and reading. It's not all science all the time.

&gt;#7. Why are you even answering these questions since you're not /u/Alantha?

&gt;&gt;**/u/j0be:** I have a brief moment of respite from work and feel like answering questions. You don't own me.

&gt;#8. What is your favorite bat?

&gt;&gt;**/u/remotectrl:** [Red bats!](https://www.reddit.com/r/BatFacts/search?q=red+bat&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all)

&gt;#9. How did you get to be so handsome and debonair??

&gt;&gt;**/u/I_Say_I_Say:** Oh, you.

Issue: Drive shows up in This PC but cannot be accessed. 

Methods tried:

* Right click &gt; Format in This PC. It just does nothing 
* I tried chkdsk when running the command prompt as an administrator. It says I don't have permissions. 
* I checked the properties on the drive. There's no security tab. 
* I ran diskpart and attempted to format the drive that way. It just gets stuck at 0.

Album: http://imgur.com/a/zT667

I've posted this album before, but I wanted to chime in because I like participating in theme weeks. 

So, here's my story. 

I'm in my 30s now. As a kid my first memory of a video game was on my dad's Atari 2600, a 6-switch model, when I was about four. I remember loving Missile Command and Combat, though I was frustrated by the airplane portions. Unfortunately, it was stolen. 

When I was in grade school Nintendo was the thing. I was one of the only kids who didn't have one. We were pretty low income. As a kid who loved video games I made sure to make friends with kids who had an NES. After school I'd take the bus to my babysitter's house. They had two Nintendos! I'd play Mario, TMNT, and Simon's Quest mostly. 

In 1991 my family moved across the country. Of course, Super Nintendo came out that year and I just had to have it. Christmas 1991 passed, my birthday in 1992 passed, but I had finally talked my parents into getting me one. Super Mario World here I come!

There was just one small problem, though. No one I knew had a Super. All of my new friends only had Genesis. At first I tried to resist and stay loyal to Nintendo. But we had sleepovers and I played a lot of Sonic. They convinced me to ask for a Sega so we can trade games and stuff. So I did. Right before Christmas I told my parents that I wanted a Sega, and that Sega was better. They said that ""Santa"" might have already gotten me a Super Nintendo. I said that Genesis was cheaper, and they should return it. So they did, and they used the extra money towards my own 15"" TV set for my bedroom. 

Like a lot of kids growing up in the 90s I did the rental thing. I only ever owned about five games. But every weekend we'd walk to the mom and pop rental video rental store, which was actually called Mom N Pop Video, and I'd get to pick out a game for the weekend, for better or for worse. 

I stuck with Sega. Got a 32X and Doom for Christmas in 1994. For Christmas 1995 I got a Saturn despite everyone trying to talk me out of the decision. My mom couldn't afford a game for me. So I played the crap out of the Bug and Panzer Dragoon sampler it came with. I finally got a game on my birthday in 1995 two months later. We couldn't afford a computer, so with the Net Link my Saturn became my access point to the internet. Then I job, and bought a Dreamcast on day one, just an hour after my high school girlfriend broke up with me. Sonic Adventure and SoulCalibur made me feel better. 

Still, I had all of these memories of my dad's Atari, my babysitter's NES, and all of those Genesis, Saturn, and 32X games I rented and never owned. I got a job at Babbage's and began just buying my childhood memories. All of my favorite games. Then I turned to the games and consoles that I never got to own, but thought were cool as a kid. Jaguar, 3DO, PlayStation, Sega CD. And then I started buying ones I had only read about on the internet thanks to my Saturn; Master System, Channel F, Vectrex. 

It started with the Atari, and moved to Nintendo, but Genesis is where it really happened for me. It was mine. It really was like being part of something back then. And I still have it. It's still in its box thanks to my dad telling me to save it so we could transport it if we moved. Because of that I've never thrown away any packaging.

And here I am today with 76 consoles, computers, and handhelds, and 609 games between them all talking to fellow collectors on reddit.  ",retrobattlestations,[Longest Machine] Sega Genesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/3tgvza/longest_machine_sega_genesis/

I am making this a sticky thread because we've had a few complains from people who either aren't as far in the books yet, or who are show watchers who are now planning to read the books. I think the comments are great, and I am going to read them regardless, but it's nice to help prevent people from being spoiled. 

Also, a reminder for show watchers: Unless the thread has [SPOILERS] in the title, or has spoiler flair, please tag all show spoilers in your comments.  

A spoiler tag looks like this: 

[This is a spoiler sentence.](/spoiler)

Here's how it's done:

    [This is a spoiler sentence.](/spoiler)

A reminder to everyone: Please refrain from putting spoilers in the title of posts. 

We're a really small sub, and all of your posts and comments are appreciated. As mods, we really don't want to remove anyone's comments - and we haven't so far! 

Help us all out by using spoiler tags appropriately. 

You're an awesome community. I am super proud of this subreddit and every member. Despite our small size, we have an excellent and active community here. 

Thanks!

One possible theory for this is bad writing. There's a whole other thread on that, so I won't get into it. So I'll put forth my own theory. The Zygons have developed a level of psychic ability. Not enough to control people, but enough to put a suggestion in their head and to create doubt. I expect that to be revealed in next week's episode.

Sega Online: If you weren't making games, what would you want to do?

Eno-san:
After I left high school, I pretty much just listened to music, read magazines
and didn't do much for about a year. Then I realized I had to do so I found a
job working for a software company.

If I weren't making games, I would be something music-related. I'd probably go
back to school and earn an advanced degree in it first. There are an enormous
amount of talented people in the music industry - I think a degree is
essential.
The other thing I might do is some type of free-lance work, but I'd still make
music on the side

Sega Online: Who is your favorite group?

Eno-san:
I listened to the Beatles, and YMO (Yellow Magic Orchestra) when I was young.
I also spent a lot of time making my own music, playing the organ. Eventually
my father bought me a computer for the purpose of creating music. Learning how
to make music on the computer, lead to my career in making videogames.

In junior high school I formed a couple of bands - a rock band, a techno band
and a punk band. In one way or another, I was always involved in music. I
don't have any particular music that I can say is my absolute favorite, my
taste is diverse, however I do tend towards music from the UK and European
music. I'm listening to Bjork a lot lately.

Sega Online: How much did the concept of Enemy Zero change from the time you
began developing it to its completion?

Eno-san:
The story is almost the same. Typically I think about the storylines when I'm
on a long airplane flight. That's what happened with Enemy Zero, I was on my
way back from a trip to Germany and I thought up the story. I find when I'm
flying it's the perfect time to think about stories, because there are no
phones ringing and no interruptions. Once I think up a story I usually stick
closely to it in the game's development.

Sega Online: What will Laura Lewis' next  be?

Eno-san:
She's going to be in D2. When I was thinking up a character for Enemy Zero, I
knew I wanted a character whose motions would show off the tributes of a
interactive movie game. The fluid movements of a woman seemed appropriate to
meet this challenge. Since we had Laura from D, we decided to modify her
character for Enemy Zero.

Sega Online: What do you hope people will most appreciate when they play this
game?

Eno-San
That it's different. Unlike fighting  role-playing or racing, I think gamers
will really feel this game, that they'll be drawn into the  experience, even
on an emotional level.

Sega Online: Eno-san, We know how busy you are and appreciate your taking the
time to meet - it's been a pleasure, thank you!",SegaSaturn,"1997 Interview Interview with Kenji Eno, President of Warp and Producer, Director &amp; Storywriter of Enemy Zero",https://www.reddit.com/r/SegaSaturn/comments/3r1wd0/1997_interview_interview_with_kenji_eno_president/

It's actually hard for me to believe how long ago it was. 

It's easy for some to forget, or to have never realized in the first place, how hot Dreamcast was in its day. It broke every entertainment record when it launched. It sold well. It was impossible to escape the presence of Dreamcast on television, radio, or in other media. It was pretty popular. It was everywhere. 

In the year 2000 sales of Dreamcast did decline. It's worth noting that 2000 marks the largest downturn in the video game market since the famous crash in 1983. The video game hardware sales fell 20  percent over 1999, which was then the record high. 

The decline had to do with the fact that the market was getting ready to transition to a new generation. part of it was also to do with Sony's PS2 hype machine. If you weren't around in 2000 to witness the PS2 hype, it's really indescribable. It reminds me a bit of Iraq's Comical Ali, though that's a dated reference as well. Basically, Sony had engineered an marketing environment where PS2 would be released and simultaneously crush both Sega and Nintendo, and make Microsoft cancel Xbox before it launched. It would also power the world's super computer and nuclear missiles. 

Meanwhile, Sega released a steady stream fantastic of games, made online console gaming mainstream, and got big third parties to support their console. (That's another thing that is often forgotten, by the way. Sega got every single major third party developer to support Dreamcast aside from EA.) And Sega's marketing was on point and more reminiscent of the Genesis era, Sega scream and all. 

It really seemed like Sega was doing everything right, right up until they quit. Another important thing to remember is that Sega did quit. Dreamcast didn't ""fail."" It didn't experience a slow death like Atari Jaguar or Phillips CD-i. It was still doing well when Sega threw in the towel to become a third party developer. In fact, it was the first time that Sega had been out of the red since Saturn. 

Sega's exit from the market seemed like a squandered opportunity, at the time and in retrospect, for Sega to position themselves and Dreamcast as a less expensive, powerful alternative to PS2 that was the only console with online gaming (and it would be until XBL launched in 2002). 


After recently speaking to Tom Kalinske who was Sega's CEO during the Genesis era, and after reading console wars a second time, it hit me. Peter Moore's Sega just wasn't hungry. 

In Console Wars Sega's former marketing director Al Nilsen was as puzzled as anyone as too why Sega of Japan wasn't successful as Sega of America. He concluded that JOJ employees were hardworking and brilliant, but they wouldn't do anything to win, whereas Tom Kalinske's Sega of America would. 

Kalinske didn't just want to have a good video game console and make great games, the approach that Nintendo took. ""Let the games speak for themselves."" Well, that approach resulted in Nintendo falling from the position of market leader, and it allowed Sega to go from 1 percent market share to 54 percent marketshare in just three years. 

On the other hand, Kalinske and his team wanted to win at all costs. They did the side by side Sonic vs. Mario commercials, they did the mall tour, they did ""blast processing."" They openly mocked Nintendo. They said that people who prefer Game Boy might also like drinking toilet water. Kalinske even formed alliances with Sony, 3DO, and Silicon Graphics to make sure that that Sega would remain on top. If SOJ had listened he told me that he had no doubt that he was right. I believe him. 

Peter Moore's Sega of America was like Peter Main, Howard Lincoln, and Minoru Arakawa's Nintendo of America. Make good games, make a good console, and that's all that matter. While Sony was positioning PS2 as a KT level extinction event for its rivals Sega just went on making games. They never once went after PS2 directly. They didn't call out it's weak launch line up, they didn't call out its jaggies. They didn't call out its lack of online games. They didn't make up a fancy blast processing-worthy buzzword for its full screen anti aliasing that PS2 lacked. Sega didn't stand up and fight. 

[Sega needed official marketing like this.](http://www.ukresistance.co.uk/ukr/pics/dcstandbig.gif) The only time they remotely stood up to Sony was[ a mild tease at Sony for not being able to meet consumer demand.](http://megagames.com/sites/default/files/game-content-images/segson_l1.jpg) Not only too little too late, but they never followed up. 

In spite of having great hardware, great games, online gaming, great marketing, and strong third party support, Dreamcast never reached its full potential because Sega never brought the fight to Sony. Sega didn't try to win at all costs as Kalinske had only years before.

/r/GallowBoob is what's called a username subreddit. What's that? It's a subreddit that shares the same name as person's username. These are good to have for remembering stuff, as a folder for your own content, or just to prevent someone from stealing yours to troll you. [I have mine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ZadocPaet) You should grab yours too. [Here's a meta list of prominent user subreddits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/users)

Now that we know what a username sub is, what's the /r/GallowBoob all about? It's a subreddit all about /u/GallowBoob, of course! Who the fuck is he? Quite simply put, he's a guy who is very good at reddit. Possibly the most prolific redditor ever. [Just check out his rankings on karmalb.com.](http://i.imgur.com/ximHqVo.jpg)

As the title says, if you've spent any time at all on /r/all you've seen GallowBoob's posts. The man shares the best content he finds and makes it popular across a wide spectrum of subreddits. He also crossposts content from some subs to other relevant ones. By the way, [xposting is not the same thing as reposting](http://i.imgur.com/3OuqnR6.gifv), which he doesn't do that often. Being one of the best content submitters on reddit has earned g-boob both [fans](https://i.imgur.com/T295tIW.jpg) and [enemies](http://i.imgur.com/qtjhJMd.jpg) alike. 

So, what is /r/GallowBoob all about? Really it's a big GallowBoob circlejerk. [In this post, g-boob shows off reddit's special settings for power users only](https://i.imgur.com/9NIZBCH.png). I can tell you from personal experience that many of these tools do come in handy. 

Some of GallowBoob's fans post gifts for him, [like this NSFW pic](https://i.imgur.com/NqFakZG.jpg). I have to say, if that's what people send you on reddit as a reward for just using reddit, then you're doing something right. I'd rather have one of these than a lifetime of reddit gold. 

One user, /u/cynnie, [developed a web app](http://csloisel.github.io/is-gallow-front/) to determine when GallowBoob is on the front page of reddit. You know you've arrived on reddit when strangers make you apps.

Some posts describe [what GallowBoob does when he finds new content](http://i.imgur.com/IVMqRTr.gifv). To be honest, [I have this exact same reaction](http://www.gfycat.com/RealisticGoodnaturedBream).  

There are even some sighting of GallowBoob in the wild that pop up from time to time, like [this one of him driving home after a long day](https://i.imgur.com/0io3JOf.jpg) of working ~~for reddit~~. 

I think you get the point. Let's hear from the man himself and his reddit friends. 


---

&gt;#1. What's the typical day in the life of GallowBoob like?

&gt;&gt;**/u/GallowBoob:** Usually starts with an emergency poop, followed by checking reddit for PMs of nudes (it's not a thing but please make it one), cooking basic food with absolutely no special ingredients comes next, drop fresh content on reddit and have webcam sex with Brangelina, poop some more, sleep, repeat.

&gt;&gt;**/u/maybesaydie:**  A typical day in the life of GallowBoob is something mere mortals can only dream of.

&gt;#2. What's the typical day in the life of a mod of /r/GallowBoob like? Also, describe the sub.

&gt;&gt;**/u/GallowBoob:**  ~~We usually take turns logging onto /u/GallowBoob~~ Making reddit a better place!

&gt;&gt;**/u/maybesaydie:** A typical day in the life of a /r/GallowBoob mod has been pretty quiet for me because I just started. The sub is a wonderland of cool gifs and strange questions from plebs who are, most of the time, admiring and curious. I understand that sometimes assholes show up but they are dispatched with haste.

&gt;&gt;**/u/mar10wright:** A typical day is filled with spreading the gospel of the Boobian race. Leading people to the understanding of their true karmic lord, /r/gallowboob.

&gt;#3. Can you explain to our readers the difference between xposting and reposting?

&gt;&gt;**/u/GallowBoob:**  Cross posting makes the fabric that links communities together, bigger ones help smaller ones grow. Reposting means finding content on a sub and posting it again **on that same sub**. To take that content elsewhere is neither the work of Satan nor does it keep anyone at reddit HQ up at night. (check www.karmadecay.com for reposts, and for the love of Dog don't blab about reposts when it isn't one, for each repost flagging that is false you kill an orphaned puppy)

&gt;&gt;**/u/maybesaydie:** XPosting is where you find excellent content on reddit and post it yourself in another subreddit that you think might enjoy it. You always credit the original post and sub. Reposting is just plain stealing and is done by people with bad manners who were probably raised by wolves.

&gt;#4. Fans vs. enemies, which does GallowBoob have more of?

&gt;&gt;**/u/GallowBoob:** I like to think I have a lot of positive vibes from reddit, making the occasional unfounded negative ones funny if anything. I haven't slept with anyone's wife/husband and I didn't trick anyone into buying penis enlargement pills, not sure what I am supposed to be hated for. Let alone any active redditor out there.

&gt;&gt;**/u/maybesaydie:** For a while there all he had was enemies but then he did that [CasualAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/3fvmw0/im_a_10_month_user_with_over_5_million_combined/) and I think that gained him lots of fans. I don't know if there's an official count of one versus the other, however.

&gt;&gt;**/u/endless_vanity:**  Gallow has more fans than enemies. It's a small percentage of users that actually care about karma status right off the top. It's an even smaller percent from that crowd that cares if you whore it up often.

&gt;&gt;**/u/mar10wright:** There are more and more fans every day honestly, at first it was astounding how many people came to the sub that were actually upset by GB. Now it's mostly people who are positive and who realize how absurd it is to get upset about someone posting things to reddit.

&gt;&gt;He has haters, but the amount of people who blindly care less or who even do care out measures the haters by quite a spread.

&gt;#5. What is your penis size and flavor?

&gt;&gt;**/u/GallowBoob:**  Yes.

&gt;#6. what made you decide to be the most prolific link poster in reddit history?

&gt;&gt;**/u/GallowBoob:** The money. /s 

&gt;&gt;Honestly it all started by tinkering with imgur, I grew there and ended up meeting a lot of people online. Always had a thing for online communities, I was part of an anime/manga French forum as a prepubescent child and it was my first internet interaction. I found imgur great, ended up becoming one of the top 10 posters there and somewhat friends with Sarah Schaaf which ensued in helping them organize [their first Imgur meetup outside of the States. It took place in London's Hyde Park (Kensington Gardens)](http://imgur.com/blog/2014/07/28/operation-upvote-imgurians-take-london/). After which a friend showed me reddit, and explained to me how it works. (/u/alouf) Little did he know... I was going to insert my e-peen into reddit's moist gaping hole and become what I always wanted to be, a meme. 

&gt;&gt;Jokes aside, I didn't plan any of it, I just reddited here and there, experiencing the impact of sending off entertainers and artists VIRAL in less than 24 hours and watching as the entire internet fed off of this content ""front paging"" on reddit and rippling all over the interwebs. This drive made me try it some more, and more, and even a bit more until I found myself too involved in reddit and it's userbase to turn back. Living in the age of the online where everyone is trying to make it and witnessing it first hand by being the default conduit for such an end was too much to just say ""oh lol k cool"". 

&gt;&gt;The fact I didn't feel any drive at being a Landscape Architect for the remainders of my days also was a factor in how much I reddited. This ended up opening new doors to me, I kept the doors open long enough while powering through a few months of unemployment and soon enough I'll be employed in the online, Media and what not. I'll make an announcement when it happens for the sake of transparency but in no way does it affect my redditing (example of plugging products/articles from that media group are a nono and I intend of keeping both separate because fuck that noise). 

&gt;&gt; tl;dr reddited too hard, ended up being swallowed whole by the internet, if one day I can afford a garden and a puppy it would have all been worth it. If not, then I would have a pretty shit excuse as to why I lost 1-2 years of my life becoming an online memer.

&gt;#7. What tips do you have for users who post to reddit?

&gt;&gt;**/u/GallowBoob:** First of all I wouldn't mind answering any questions anyone has regarding redditing in general, as good as I can. Often get approached regarding ""how can I get exposure for X or Y project of mine?"", from entertainers to artists to your regular redditor trying to get something out there. I usually try my best, I guess the most important thing is: 

&gt;&gt;* Content 

&gt;&gt;* How you title it

&gt;&gt;* Where you post it

&gt;&gt;* When you post it

&gt;&gt;I wouldn't mind answering questions when they are asked, be it PM or in comments (granted I try to minimize rogue comments as they tend to aggregate shitstorms where not necessary, so PM is best) It's not about abusing reddit, it's about using it for what it is intended, sharing relevant content to interested communities. Oh and boobs. 

&gt;#8. Mods, when did you first meet Gallowboob?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Iyamnotdead:** I first came across Mr Boob when he was a young account of around 300k karma. I enjoyed the content he was posting and sent him a message, to ignore the haters (yes they were around back then) and told him of a private sub which would be a safe haven where the kabul meet and discuss all things Reddit.

&gt;&gt; He repaid my kindness by sending me nudes. That was where I came across him the second time.

&gt;&gt;He's a good man, and get's more than his fair share of hate. We're here to help deal with that, ~~and to help by posting on his account~~.

&gt;#9. Who allowed you to moderate this wonderful sub, /u/maybesaydie?

&gt;&gt;**/u/maybesaydie:** Why the lovely /u/siouxsie_siouxv2 to whom I am eternally grateful.

It's shit like this that turns me off to certain fandoms. I watch movies and TV shows because they're fun and entertaining. It's not my life. 

There are a certain class of fans, for example in Star Trek fandom, that will actually try to berate you if you say that the continuity doesn't match on two episodes for the simple fact that the writers forgot, didn't think of it, or didn't care. Oh no, you're a fucktard because you're too idiotic to invent some convoluted ""in universe"" explanation.

/r/RetroTube is a subreddit for videos of retro gaming only. It's brought to you by /u/spookycookies and the mods of /r/retrogaming! 

The number one thing that mods here do is monitor YouTube posts.

It's perfectly okay to post your retro game let's play, reviews, and what have you here. 

Your content is welcome. However, we ask that your self promotional content not be more than around 10 percent of your total posts. For more information please Reddit's self-promotion rules.

Read them here:

http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion

Because of this, we've created /r/RetroTube, a place where 100 percent of your submissions can be your own content. Just please don't post your videos more than once a day. 

**It's important to note that no rules are chaining on /r/retrogaming.** 

Here it's business as usual. We will only be referring *excessive* YouTube submissions to /r/RetroTube. 

We hope that in time /r/RetroTube can grow into becoming a community where people can share and discuss their retro game videos.

8322,2015-10-03 04:52:43+00:00,self.Heroes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Heroes/comments/3nb9f8/spoilers_i_am_more_convinced_now_than_ever_of_a/,False,"I just rewatched each of the Reborn episodes. Everyone's probably heard the popular theory on that Noah is really Sylar. 

Some reasons that I initially suspected this is because Noah survives Odessa unscathed, he seems to have forgotten that he needed glasses, plus Renee wiped his memory. There's a plan for Noah, but it's not time for him to come into the fold yet. However, it was more of a sneaky suspicion than anything for me. 

I believe that the real Noah Bennett died in Odessa along with most everyone who was there. 

Having just rewatched the new series it clicked in my head that it really is Sylar. He's not in Noah's form because he's evil and had to be contained. His transformation from ~~good to evil~~ evil to good at the end of the last series was real. 

Sylar is in Noah's form because him being in the hands of Renautas would be a disaster. They could use him and his powers to do anything; even destroy the entire world. This is why Molly Walker reacted so strongly to him being at Renautas. She'd rather be caught than have them find Sylar... which they could do with her tech. It could also be that she's focusing all of her energy on just not revealing Noah's location.  

When I first watched the scene where Molly runs from Noah it didn't make any sense to me at all. But now it does make sense if she's trying to protect him. 

It has been widely reported that Zachary Quinto declined an invitation to return for this series. Many have also pointed out that Quinto has a very busy schedule right now. 

On that note I submit an alternative theory, yet equally compelling. Noah Bennett is not Syler. Rather, he's a fully restored Peter Petrelli. Peter could've been healed by some other evo, like baby Parkman or maybe even Claire. Or Peter could've come into contact with someone who had his original power, or Peter could be holding onto Sylar's power. What makes this idea fit is that according to IMDb, Milo Ventimiglia doesn't have anything in production at all. 

Ventimiglia has only said that he wasn't asked to return, not that he wouldn't. If either Quinto or Ventimiglia were to come back, it wouldn't be the first time a show has hidden that a cast member is returning, or that a cast member has denied that they'd return. 

One prominent example is that Steve Carrel said that he wasn't returning to The Office for the series finale, and the show denied it as well. They managed to keep the secret well under wraps. Similarly, Doctor Who was able to keep quiet the fact that Paul McGann had reprized his role as the Eighth Doctor as part of the 50th Anniversary ""Night of the Doctor"" special. It didn't leak out right up until they were ready to release the special. I am sure there are other examples. 

**TL;DR - It's more convincing to me now than ever that Noah is really Sylar, and if not, then he's a fully powered Peter Petrelli. The Noah avatar that he's in right now was created by Matt and Renee in order to keep Sylar/Peter from falling into the hands of Renautas. Noah died in Odessa like most everyone else did.**

Recently several gifs have been posted that were hosted on sites that redirects mobile users to malware, but on a PC it looks like a normal gif. 

In order to combat this we're allowing only approved hosts. If think there's a host that should be approved that's not already, then either reply to this thread or send us a mod mail and we'll review it. 

The currently approved domains are:

* imgur
* i.imgur
* gfycat
* giant.gfycat
* giphy
* YouTube

All of this information is in the sidebar. 

If you submit a link from a non-approved host you'll get a message from AutoModerator, and you're welcome to resubmit with an approved host. 

Since we have your attention, here's a brief explanation of each of the other rules. 

* Rule 1 - Reflexes can be good OR bad. In other words, please don't downvote or report a link because it was a fail. Dads sometimes do that. 

* Rule 2 - Try to start posts with ""Dad..."" It used to say ""Start all posts with 'Dad...' but it was changed because a lot of good posts didn't follow that rule. So we encourage posts to begin with ""Dad..."" but won't be removing posts that don't. So please don't report posts to us that comply with the wording of the old rule. 

* Rule 3 - Use RES compatible links. In other words, link directly to an image on imgur, not to the imgur page. ",DadReflexes,[META] New rules,https://www.reddit.com/r/DadReflexes/comments/3kumod/meta_new_rules/

**1,386** *haters* for **2 months!**

Let's face facts. Just looking at people who are FAT32 is [disgusting](https://i.imgur.com/OcmpxUL.png). Their diet of files *no larger than* 4gb is **offensive**. Sometimes these FAT fucks just need to [be taken out](http://www.recordshred.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hard-drive-destroyed.jpg). Thank goodness reddit now has a safe space to hate on FAT32people! 

[applause.gif](http://i.imgur.com/dhMeAzK.gif)

The people of /r/FAT32peoplehate have just one thing in common. There's only one requirement to fit in. Hate FAT32people. 

[FAT32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table) is a throw back from the 70s, much like the FDA's archaic dietary idea that bacon was bad for you but eating a ton of carbs was good. Just look at how FAT [this hard drive](https://i.imgur.com/uqKOX.jpg) got on that bread! It needs a forklift to even get on a plane. You know you wouldn't want to sit next to it. 

Long ago I joined the NTFSmasterrace and left FAT32 behind me. But sometimes I and others still have to deal with these files. Like Xbox 360 doesn't accept anything but FAT32 formatted removable drives. [Why the fuck](http://i.imgur.com/1Aa7gKJ.jpg) do they have that requirement? [I can't put a movie on the thing that's over 4gb!](https://i.imgur.com/rcJxDoh.png) (Seeing that png made me throw up a little in my mouth.) 

These days many are going from being FAT32people to NTFSmasterrace. Just check out [this progress pic](https://i.imgur.com/rV4Oca3.png). 

For more reasons to hate on FAT32people I turned to subreddit founder **/u/Teddiebeer**.

&gt;#1. What's the deal with FAT32 people?

&gt;&gt;FAT32 People are the people who willingly choose to use or support the FAT32 filesystem over the vast array of superior file-systems. Whether they're still on Windows 95 or use software that supports, or even encourages FAT32 usage (And is therefore an enabler).

&gt;#2. Why do we hate FAT32 people?

&gt;&gt;FAT32 is a filesystem made in the mid-90s, meant to replace FAT16 and it's own predecessors, which has its own origins back in the mid-to-late 70's. It is nothing more than a dated technology. An ugly hack made by people who didn't understand the possible repercussions of their actions.

&gt;&gt;FAT32 is nothing more than an ugly, disgusting hack. Anyone willing to do that to themselves is deserving of every bit of vitriol thrown their way. Anyone that uses FAT32 is an ignorant, disgusting person that refuses to not only help themselves but is willing to drag down the rest of society for their own selfish ignorance.

&gt;#3. What's your favorite post?

&gt;&gt;Revelations 17:3 • So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a filesystem sit upon a magnetic medium, full of names of blasphemy, having four read/write heads and a MBR.
17:4 • And the filesystem was arrayed in sectors and in clusters, and decked with ASCII and a volume label and serial number, having a golden FAT in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication with the user-level:

&gt;&gt;17:5 • And upon her volume label was a name written, MYSTERY_BAB.

&gt;#4. How did this sub even get started?

&gt;&gt;So there is this recurring thread on the facepunch.com forums called ""Computer Illiterate People that think they know things and general chat"". As a professional computer illiterate it goes without saying that I feel right at home, probably to the annoyance of the regulars as my antics generally involve humour nobody gets or would be more at home in another reality. Around the time that hating on ""fat people"" was apparently an interesting thing to do. A user complained that Google was splitting up a download in several parts while our technology of the present could perfectly handle it as a single file. One of the little hoodlums replied with /r/FAT32peoplehate. In my sorry state of finding myself too funny I replied with ""done,"" linking to my newly registered subreddit. As more and more unlucky fools started subscribing I realised that I need to contribute something besides awful posts so I started working on that awful CSS theme.

&gt;#5. Who even are you?

&gt;&gt;Just some random person on the internet.

8905,2015-09-03 14:54:23+00:00,self.Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3jhtft/i_spent_the_week_playing_retro_video_games_with/,False,"I spent Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at the Game On Expo. I had a booth called Retro Game Living Room. I brought a couch, a coffee table, a TV stand, an old CRT, around20 game consoles and about 50 games. 

I started with the first game console ever made and went one by one, changing consoles out every hour, going forward in history. 

I played games with a lot of people, taught them about the consoles and how to play the games. It was a lot of hard work, but it was also a lot of fun. 

It was surprising to which consoles resonated and which didn't. Saturn and Astrocade were two of the biggest hits. Then again, it's not that surprising in some cases. No one wanted to play Jaguar.

All in all, around 400 people played a game at some point. And more than 1000 watched. Most of them had questions. 

I was really impressed by a lot of the younger kids' knowledge of older video game systems, how much they appreciated them, and how so many said they preferred older games to a lot of the newer ones. 

I think YouTube entertainment has a lot to do with the knowledge factor. It's cute when a 9 year old is explaining why Atari Jaguar said it was 64 bits and then questions whether or not it had all of those bits. Thank you James Rolfe. 

Kids really liked these games. The videos of kids playing old video games, that YouTube series, is bunk. I am confident in saying that. Sure, these are kids at an expo, but many of them never played these consoles before and came with their parents. So I don't think the sample bias is that bad. 

I attribute this firstly to the return of single screen games thanks to indy developers' efforts on XBL and mobile devices. Games like Geometry Wars, I Made A Game With Zombies In It, Plants vs. Zombies, and so on. 

The thing is that most of those newer games are not quite as good as, nor do they hold up as well, or have the same universal appeal and integrity of design as games like Galaga, Ms. Pac-Man, Space Fortress, or Missile Command. So it's easy to see why a kid can pick up Burger Time on Intellivision for the first time or Warlords on 2600 and have a blast. 

I also credit the response of young gamers to these older games to the frustration felt by gamers who are sick of unfinished products being released (as final products) and requiring updates. Many commented that they didn't mind the slow load times of the Sega CD's 1x speed drive because it's still a lot faster than downloading updates. I further credit this to the frustration that gamers experience over downloadable content. Many expressed surprise that characters in fighting games could be unlocked; that the unlockables were earned as a reward for good game play and that you didn't have to pay money for them.

**25,668** *emus* for **7 years!**

I recently learned that /r/emulation was one of the very first subreddits created during the subreddits beta. I think that's fitting since through emulation gamers can experience beta and alpha builds of old games that we would otherwise have never been able to play. 

Emulators are programs that allow us to play games for old systems on new hardware. It is really important to gamers in a number of ways. First, it's the only way to play a lot of rare titles that now sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars. It's the only way some people to play older games at all. It also often serves as an introduction to retro gaming for many, as some people are more likely to play *Missile Command* on an emulator than they are to come across a real live working Atari 2600. For me, emulation was a big part of why I started collecting retro games and consoles.

So, what is /r/emulation like? Well, it's a subreddit where people talk about emulation. It's where you can find out what emulators work best with which hardware. Emulation isn't just for PCs anymore. They can be installed on consoles, portable devices, and even [calculators](https://i.imgur.com/fIJa0Fz.jpg). /r/emulation is a place to get help with running your emulators properly. It's just not a place to ask where to find pirated software. 

Other than discussions, there are lots of posts showcasing emulation in action, like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoVFzm3_Z-4) of an Xbox 360 emulator running *Sonic 4*. There are guides, like [this one](http://www.myconsole.io/how-to-play-snes-games-from-steam-with-the-steam-overlay/) on how to play SNES games from Steam. Here's [another guide](http://a.pomf.se/bakjsn.png) about which controllers are best to use for your retro games on a PC. 

/r/emulation is a great sub to explore the world of emulation, whether you've dabbled it it before and are experience, or are discovering it for the very first time. 

For more about the sub, I spoke with moderator **/u/neonkidxy**.

&gt;#1. Can you tell me about the history of /r/emulation? It's not every day that you come across a sub that's seven years old.

&gt;&gt;I came in 3 or so years ago, so not much history has happened with me, We do have several devs who work on emulation here though, we've seen the rise and fall of emulators and have been keeping up with some of the oldest emulators around

&gt;#2. Describe the community. How to the users interact? What kind of posts are most popular?

&gt;&gt;Our community can be some of the most helpful people around, as long as you don't ask a question that can easily be found by reading a popular wiki or easy google. That's mostly true for every subreddit I've found though. The community interacts with each other very well except when it comes to clarifying the rules which are always a hot debate. The most popular post are the ones about an emulator updating.

&gt;#3. What are the most popular emulators?

&gt;&gt;It seems that Dolphin, VBA-M, and Project64 ver 1.6 are the most popular.

&gt;#4. What is your stance on piracy? Do you consider the use of ROMs to be piracy?

&gt;&gt;My personal stance is that it's okay as long as the you can't find them for a reasonable price, I would love if nintendo reworked their entire library to be more like steam, Kinda glad that they don't or I wouldn't have any money left at all. Obtaining ROMS online is illegal, dumping them is not.

&gt;#5. Is there anything that's not allowed to be posted to /r/emulation?

&gt;&gt;Unfortunately there is not.

&gt;#6. How does emulation compare with using real hardware? Are there any advantages or disadvantages?

&gt;&gt;Emulation is much better than original hardware, you get to put things in HD and apply filters as well as more, the only disadvantage is that accuracy suffers which leaves some games unplayable or having graphical problems

&gt;#7. Who even are you and how'd you get mixed up in this sub anyways?

&gt;&gt;I'm just a nobody who loves emulation, I came to /r/emulation when I had just started coming to reddit, I asked questions and answered them and started giving suggestions and then /u/Moz made me a mod.

&gt;#8. Why are you into emulation? What's your favorite games/systems/etc?

&gt;&gt;It's awesome to be able to play games from other systems and figure out how to use the enhancements and such, I have a soft spot for VBA-M and Final fantasy 6.

Oh boy, do the admins talk shit. They talk a lot of shit. I am talking enough shit to reach the moon, come back, and circle the planet a few times. Even then I am sure there'd still be some shit left just piled up in the streets. 

With the amount of shit we're talking about here; with this level of shit, there's got to be a crew to take care of it all. And that's where /r/ShitTheAdminsSay comes in. 

All kidding aside, it's no joke that reddit admins having been getting a lot of shit themselves recently. Even people who don't know what reddit is knows that. Here's a thing that happened to me the other week. My neighbor was recently put on a keto diet to control her kidney stones and she's telling me about it one day while I'm taking the trash bins to the curb. She mentions how she misses sweets. I started telling her about this great no sugar, no flour cake I make, and how I got it from this one subreddit called /r/ketorecipes, how it's a community about this one specific topic, and how she should go there for a lot of fantastic recipes...  

She interrupted me cold. 

*I would never go on a hate site where they shame fat people. I've been heavy my whole life!*

&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

Love the admins or hate them, you've got to love the fact that /r/ShitTheAdminsSay is a real thing, I tell you. It keeps an easy to search record of the shit the admins have said. 

In the case of my elderly neighbor, I could've gone the sub, and pulled up several posts that show that [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitTheAdminsSay/comments/3drmb3/spez_7_years_ago_weve_always_banned_hate_speech/) [doesn't like](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitTheAdminsSay/comments/3fytmr/your_css_has_been_altered_to_restore_the/) [hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitTheAdminsSay/comments/3fy3rz/uspez_posts_an_update_to_reddits_content_policy/) stuff. It's a great place to fact check reddit policy. 

Of course, /r/ShitTheAdminsSay isn't just useful for that one thing. 

If you've ever wondered what can earn you a ban, just search the sub. You'll find [some](http://i.imgur.com/HDqNuV0.png) [behaviors](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitTheAdminsSay/comments/39dcmr/downvoting_a_users_entire_history_and_pm_spam_can/) to [avoid](http://i.imgur.com/X55tdJQ.jpg).

It's fun to see when an admin tells someone to straight up [quit their bullshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitTheAdminsSay/comments/3ey31f/user_claims_to_have_been_shadow_banned_for_no/). When they have [a sense of humor](https://twitter.com/Boriss/status/609055057779163136) or[ get real](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitTheAdminsSay/comments/34370p/using_retard_as_an_insult_is_really_shitty/). These are people too. Speaking of the people, you can even show all posts from specific admins.

The next time you want to find out what admins say, or see and admin say something, then go to /r/ShitTheAdminsSay!


And now, here's some shit the mods of /r/ShitTheAdminsSay say. 

&gt;#1. What's the deal with this sub? 

&gt;&gt;**/u/Br00ce:** The sub started after I got into a debate with someone over what /u/alienth said about mods determining what is spam in their own subreddit. The person called me a liar and I realized I didn't have the link to backup my claims. I thought it would be a cool idea to have centralized place to keep interesting quotes since they make important statement all over the site.

&gt;&gt;**/u/angrypotato1:** just keep a record on what admins say, pretty useful as reddit's press releases are pretty unclear at times


&gt;#2. What are some of the more interesting posts to you?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Br00ce:** I have to admit I have a bit of a butter tooth so the /r/science modmail leaks and the ""popcorn tastes good"" comments are my favorite. Some of the other ones is [cupcake saying /r/fitnesscirclejerk are the biggest brigaders](http://redd.it/2mqac2) and [the real reason /r/jailbait was banned](http://redd.it/2m319b).


&gt;#3. Did you have a rough time during any of the recent reddit controversies? 


&gt;&gt;**/u/Br00ce:** The recent drama only gave us subscribers through totesmetabot (when mods do not remove it).



&gt;#4. Who is your favorite admin?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Br00ce:** Deimorz. He is a straight shooter who doesn't take crap from anyone.


&gt;&gt;**/u/Dropping_fruits:** I'd say dacvak, but he doesn't work for reddit anymore. Then I'd say cupcake but she doesn't for there anymore either. Then I'd say Victoria but she is also gone. I guess I'll have to go with deimorz.

&gt;&gt;**/u/angrypotato1:** former would have to be /u/yishan for all the hilarious smackdown's he's done. Current would be /u/Deimorz bcoz he's a handy guy and automod. shoutout to cupcake, sporkicide, kripsy and ocrasorm for being real nice too

&gt;#5. What is the community like?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Br00ce:** The community is absolutely amazing. Everyone is super friendly and don't harass the admins.



&gt;#6. Tell us a little bit about you. Also, add anything here that you like.


&gt;&gt;**/u/Br00ce:** I am just a normal 22 year old college student from Virginia. I am a big redskins and caps fan. I love going mountain biking and going out to the bars with my friends.


&gt;&gt;**/u/angrypotato1:** im 11 and waht is this

I used to use Kgen for Genesis, SNES9x for Super Nintendo, and Stella for Atari 2600. 

My son just found out emulators are a thing and would like to get into using some. However, I have no idea what the best ones are right now. 

Currently I have him using Archive.org's retro console living room. But I remember back in the day that you could use real emulators to map out buttons to a controller, so I'd like to do that. Especially since I have a USB Saturn controller for him to use. 

So, anyone know what the best emulators are right now for basically every system? ",retrogaming,Good emulators?,http://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/3g7nob/good_emulators/

#On Violence In Video Games &amp; Parenting 

Rob: Now, I have a question for you, not only as a game programmer, but as a therapist. Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 3… Violence in video games: how do you think that really affects people?

Daniel: I think I think the conversation is really flawed because no one has the same sort of perspective that you do with programming, seeing it from both ends of the fence.

Howard: Well thank you. I hope that's true. The thing is this is something that's really been studied and what’s interesting is people don't really talk about the research on it very much. Everybody cites examples of how horrible this is, so I'm going to start out with a quote from quite a while ago. I don’t remember who said it. It was a very funny guy who said this. I think it was Dick Cavett, maybe. “If T.V. and movies really impacted people behavior, comedy would be breaking out in the streets.”

The thing is that you look at violent offenders, and you look and you go, ‘Oh look. They play violent video games.’ That's true that's very true that violent offenders absolutely play violent video games. But it's very fallacious logic to say that, ‘Well if violent offenders play violent video games, then video games cause violent behavior.’ You know, a lot of heroin addicts started on milk.

Rob: it's a logical fallacy. It's a false cause, or what they call post hoc ergo propter hoc Just because…

Howard: Exactly! Very good, very good. It is post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. Exactly. It’s a total logical fallacy. What it is, if you want to study violence in video games, you don't look at violent offenders and then see how many of them play violent video games, because of course they will. People who have a violent predisposition are going to seek violence in everything they do including their entertainment and gaming. And they’ll go to violent movies, and they will play violent games, and they will do violence.

If you want to answer the question, ‘Do video games cause violence?’ You want to look at everybody who plays violent video games, and ask ‘how many of them are violent offenders?’ When you look at it that way, of the literally hundreds of millions, if not billions of people who play violent video games, a very, very small percentage of those people commit violence. Because people talk about the violent impulses it generates, but they don't talk about the cathartic feelings it also releases and gives vent to.

Also you're dealing with the idea of people differentiate between fantasy and reality. Some people can’t, but most people can. Most people understand the difference between playing a video game and operating in real life. And there is a difference.

There was a Harvard study, I think in 2004 or 2005, that did a whole survey of a lot of video game research that's been done and they invalidated a great deal of it. Their official results at the end, Harvard University said that there is absolutely no correlation between people playing violent video games and committing violence. It does not stimulate violence. The thing that people comeback to is that violent people play violent video games. Well of course they do. But that's that's not predictive. That's just consequential. If you look at the research, if you look at the really quality research not just scare tactics stuff, because there's a lot of that, there it is.

As a therapist I've gone through training. This is kind of a really interesting topic for me. I’m really glad you brought this up because I go to trainings and out of parenting seminars, where you have to learn what good pareting is and stuff, they would always have a chapter and hear about how do you deal with video games.

Okay, so if you don't mind I’d really like to talk about this for just a second. I mean this is a huge thing that actually could be a public service.

So they would they would give these things and and then start talking about how horrible video games are, and what a destructive force they are in people’s lives, and parents need to cut them out and not let their kids play video games. They were actually doing this. Then they would give examples. They would show scenes from video games of horrible, destructive violent things, and what I noticed, and I would raise my hand. I would talk about this in the seminars because these are full of people who really aren’t video game players or video game enthusiasts. They're quite the opposite. They're buying this. They’re swallowing this, one hundred percent. They will be showing examples of games that were never released, games that were not out, and it's like really? That's the game you’re s that's from? That's your example? Nobody has this game. This game is not played. They just found footage from a game.

So what I tell people is this. Video games are an issue in parenting because there are kids who spend a lot of time playing video games to the exclusion of dealing with their parents and families at times. And it isolates people, it separates, it severs relationships in some ways, it can get to be a real problem.

So parents say, ‘Well then, we've got to keep the kids from playing video games.’ Well, what I explain to parents is, “Okay, so you if you tell your kids they can’t play games, that’s like telling them ‘don't do drugs.’” Do you think it's really going to stop them? What it's going to do is it's going to stop them from letting you know what they're doing, but they're going to do what they're going to do. They're going to go visit their friends. Unless you’re just going to lock them in their room and not let them out, they're going to find ways to do that because it's omnipresent. It's everywhere. And it's fun. It's engaging. And it's a part of their social culture.

Rob: Yeah, and I feel that it would probably damage the parent-child relationship. I’m a dad myself. My son’s ten. And my biggest problem with his isolation is not video games, because video games can be very social because I get to share then with my son. Not only do we get to play Halo together, on Atari 2600 and it’s fun to us. Even to my ten year old.

Howard: Right, but you see, that’s the key.

Rob: But the big problem is, for me and him, for his isolation, is YouTube. It’s the wanting to go on YouTube and watch the let’s plays. Not the gaming.

Howard: That that can be, but it's the same thing with YouTube as it is with all this other stuff. They are things you can do together. So I tell parents is don't try to restrict what your child does. Get involved with it. If you play games with your child. First of all, it becomes a joining experience and you enhance your relationship. Secondly, if you have presence in your child's life you have the chance to explain to them, ‘Well you know this is fun and this is like wild, but this is not real life at all. This is totally off base. This is a ridiculous way of seeing things.’ And it is. It’s okay for video games, because video games are the place for things to be ridiculous. But there's a difference between games and life.

Kids need to learn that at some point and most kids do. The thing is to use it as a bridge; use it as a place to connect with your child, not as something that’s devil, to be avoided, and to try and cut it off because all you're going to be doing is putting off your relationship with your child.

Parents think kids are out of control and ‘what can they do?’ But the one thing that's always been true in humanity and will remain true is that parents are in a position to have the most influence on their children out of anyone in the world. There is no one else the child looks to more for examples of how it is. If you don't use that position well, then you can you can lose the influence, you can abdicate your responsibility, but don't believe that just because kids nowadays do all this newfangled stuff that you as a parent no longer have standing in their psyche, in their mind. That's just not true.

The truth is a lot of parents are not interested in taking the time and effort that is required to invest in a child to raise because they have other interests and other things they want to do. People need to be more honest about whether or not they really want to have kids, and if that's really something they want to commit to, because being a parent is a tough job and it's a big job. And games won't do it for you and T.V. won't do it for you. Trying to set dogmatic rules about what should or shouldn’t be in your kid's life, that won't do it either. It takes time, investment, and being together with them, and playing games together, watching YouTube videos together, doing things like that, that can be a really healthy way to raise a child and build a parent-child relationship.

I see that get mistaken all over the place in trainings for therapists. It's crazy. So I just want to say that. That little public service announcement. Thank you for bringing that up. That’s really a good point.

Rob: Oh, no. Thank you for your feedback on that. I mean to me, you know, gaming is part of culture. I grew up with games and I'm happy that my son's going up with games. It's not as bad as it used to be, the attacks on video games and violence as it was you know when I was kid. I was a senior in high school when Columbine happened. They liked to blame Doom and Marilyn Manson, right?

Howard: Right.

Rob: So back then it was really under attack. It seems to me over the past ten years it's gotten so much more manageable and so much more open and so much less under attack, and gaming so much more mainstream and about fifty percent of gamers are female, and you know so forth and so on. But it's still something that comes up often enough.

Howard: It does but you know frequently it comes up on the part of people with some kind of an agenda and people who are not really informed or it's certainly not citing research.

Daniel: It’ who can we blame that's not us.

Howard: Yeah. Evasion of responsibility is very, very popular hobby because people get positive feedback for it. They get relief from having to do something.

Howard also talked a lot about his transition from programming to becoming a therapist, some about Atari, and a really funny bit about Steven Spielberg being an alien.

Rob: Now, I have a question for you, not only as a game programmer, but as a therapist. Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 3… Violence in video games: how do you think that really affects people?

Daniel: I think I think the conversation is really flawed because no one has the same sort of perspective that you do with programming, seeing it from both ends of the fence.

Howard: Well thank you. I hope that's true. The thing is this is something that's really been studied and what’s interesting is people don't really talk about the research on it very much. Everybody cites examples of how horrible this is, so I'm going to start out with a quote from quite a while ago. I don’t remember who said it. It was a very funny guy who said this. I think it was Dick Cavett, maybe. “If T.V. and movies really impacted people behavior, comedy would be breaking out in the streets.”

The thing is that you look at violent offenders, and you look and you go, ‘Oh look. They play violent video games.’ That's true that's very true that violent offenders absolutely play violent video games. But it's very fallacious logic to say that, ‘Well if violent offenders play violent video games, then video games cause violent behavior.’ You know, a lot of heroin addicts started on milk.

Rob: it's a logical fallacy. It's a false cause, or what they call post hoc ergo propter hoc Just because…

Howard: Exactly! Very good, very good. It is post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. Exactly. It’s a total logical fallacy. What it is, if you want to study violence in video games, you don't look at violent offenders and then see how many of them play violent video games, because of course they will. People who have a violent predisposition are going to seek violence in everything they do including their entertainment and gaming. And they’ll go to violent movies, and they will play violent games, and they will do violence.

If you want to answer the question, ‘Do video games cause violence?’ You want to look at everybody who plays violent video games, and ask ‘how many of them are violent offenders?’ When you look at it that way, of the literally hundreds of millions, if not billions of people who play violent video games, a very, very small percentage of those people commit violence. Because people talk about the violent impulses it generates, but they don't talk about the cathartic feelings it also releases and gives vent to.

Also you're dealing with the idea of people differentiate between fantasy and reality. Some people can’t, but most people can. Most people understand the difference between playing a video game and operating in real life. And there is a difference.

There was a Harvard study, I think in 2004 or 2005, that did a whole survey of a lot of video game research that's been done and they invalidated a great deal of it. Their official results at the end, Harvard University said that there is absolutely no correlation between people playing violent video games and committing violence. It does not stimulate violence. The thing that people comeback to is that violent people play violent video games. Well of course they do. But that's that's not predictive. That's just consequential. If you look at the research, if you look at the really quality research not just scare tactics stuff, because there's a lot of that, there it is.

As a therapist I've gone through training. This is kind of a really interesting topic for me. I’m really glad you brought this up because I go to trainings and out of parenting seminars, where you have to learn what good pareting is and stuff, they would always have a chapter and hear about how do you deal with video games.

Okay, so if you don't mind I’d really like to talk about this for just a second. I mean this is a huge thing that actually could be a public service.

So they would they would give these things and and then start talking about how horrible video games are, and what a destructive force they are in people’s lives, and parents need to cut them out and not let their kids play video games. They were actually doing this. Then they would give examples. They would show scenes from video games of horrible, destructive violent things, and what I noticed, and I would raise my hand. I would talk about this in the seminars because these are full of people who really aren’t video game players or video game enthusiasts. They're quite the opposite. They're buying this. They’re swallowing this, one hundred percent. They will be showing examples of games that were never released, games that were not out, and it's like really? That's the game you’re s that's from? That's your example? Nobody has this game. This game is not played. They just found footage from a game.

So what I tell people is this. Video games are an issue in parenting because there are kids who spend a lot of time playing video games to the exclusion of dealing with their parents and families at times. And it isolates people, it separates, it severs relationships in some ways, it can get to be a real problem.

So parents say, ‘Well then, we've got to keep the kids from playing video games.’ Well, what I explain to parents is, “Okay, so you if you tell your kids they can’t play games, that’s like telling them ‘don't do drugs.’” Do you think it's really going to stop them? What it's going to do is it's going to stop them from letting you know what they're doing, but they're going to do what they're going to do. They're going to go visit their friends. Unless you’re just going to lock them in their room and not let them out, they're going to find ways to do that because it's omnipresent. It's everywhere. And it's fun. It's engaging. And it's a part of their social culture.

Rob: Yeah, and I feel that it would probably damage the parent-child relationship. I’m a dad myself. My son’s ten. And my biggest problem with his isolation is not video games, because video games can be very social because I get to share then with my son. Not only do we get to play Halo together, on Atari 2600 and it’s fun to us. Even to my ten year old.

Howard: Right, but you see, that’s the key.

Rob: But the big problem is, for me and him, for his isolation, is YouTube. It’s the wanting to go on YouTube and watch the let’s plays. Not the gaming.

Howard: That that can be, but it's the same thing with YouTube as it is with all this other stuff. They are things you can do together. So I tell parents is don't try to restrict what your child does. Get involved with it. If you play games with your child. First of all, it becomes a joining experience and you enhance your relationship. Secondly, if you have presence in your child's life you have the chance to explain to them, ‘Well you know this is fun and this is like wild, but this is not real life at all. This is totally off base. This is a ridiculous way of seeing things.’ And it is. It’s okay for video games, because video games are the place for things to be ridiculous. But there's a difference between games and life.

Kids need to learn that at some point and most kids do. The thing is to use it as a bridge; use it as a place to connect with your child, not as something that’s devil, to be avoided, and to try and cut it off because all you're going to be doing is putting off your relationship with your child.

Parents think kids are out of control and ‘what can they do?’ But the one thing that's always been true in humanity and will remain true is that parents are in a position to have the most influence on their children out of anyone in the world. There is no one else the child looks to more for examples of how it is. If you don't use that position well, then you can you can lose the influence, you can abdicate your responsibility, but don't believe that just because kids nowadays do all this newfangled stuff that you as a parent no longer have standing in their psyche, in their mind. That's just not true.

The truth is a lot of parents are not interested in taking the time and effort that is required to invest in a child to raise because they have other interests and other things they want to do. People need to be more honest about whether or not they really want to have kids, and if that's really something they want to commit to, because being a parent is a tough job and it's a big job. And games won't do it for you and T.V. won't do it for you. Trying to set dogmatic rules about what should or shouldn’t be in your kid's life, that won't do it either. It takes time, investment, and being together with them, and playing games together, watching YouTube videos together, doing things like that, that can be a really healthy way to raise a child and build a parent-child relationship.

The flairs chosen are mostly from games featured in AVGN episodes that I was able to find good sprite sheets for. Though there are a few meta flairs thrown in for good measure. 

I am also taking suggestions for new user flairs to add. 

Keep in mind that if you make a suggestion I need to be able to find a good **clean** image to make a flair from. By ""clean"" I mean something, preferably in a .png format, that has a transparent background (or a background I can easily make transparent), and will scale well down to a max width/height of 32 pixels. 

So, make you're suggestions!

When making suggestions please be as specific as possible (i.e. I'd prefer a suggestion of ""Tanooki Mario from SMB 3"" as opposed to ""some flairs from SMB 3."" If you can link me the sprite that'd be even better. Please also don't request like a ton of flairs from one game all at once so that we have a lot of diversity. 

Right now I am focusing on adding flairs that fit into one of the three following categories; the shitty games that suck ass that have been featured in AVGN episodes, the platforms that those games are on, and meta flairs related to the Cinemassacre shows.  

I'll take suggestions until sometime on Monday when I actually get around to working on this. Then after a while I'll open up another suggestion thread. Like in a month or two. 

To assign yourself user flair look in the sidebar. Next to your username there's a link that says ""edit flair."" ",TheCinemassacre,You may now select user flairs!,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheCinemassacre/comments/3ejwem/you_may_now_select_user_flairs/

I recently added user flairs. I've done this a bunch of times on other subs that use non-naut CSS themes and have had no issues. 

The flairs show up fine in the comments. But in the sub it's glitched out. 

Example:

http://i.imgur.com/Gtnoysb.png

In this pic you can see my user flair on only one of my submissions. But on the rest it shows some weird glitch. 

You can also see /u/sjhunter6311's user flair in the pic. 

What's more weird is that in incognito mode I can't see either mine or his. 

Here's a sample of the code:

    /* --- User Flair --- */
    
    .flairselector .customizer {
    display: none !important;
    }
    
    .flair {
    border: none !important;
    top:20px;
    padding:0px;
    background: url(%%flairsheet%%);
    display:inline-block;
    }
    
    .flairselector,
    .flairselector ul,
    .flairselector ul li {
        float: none;
        margin: 0;
        width: auto!important;
    }
    .flairselector {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(-50%);
        transform: translateX(-50%);
    }
    .flairoptionpane {
        width: 130px;
    }
    
    .flair-15475{ background-position: -5px -5px; width: 16px;  height: 32px; }
    
    
    
    .flair-19428 {
        width: 22px;
        height: 32px;
        background-position: -31px -5px;
    }
    
    .flair-25174 {
        width: 29px;
        height: 32px;
        background-position: -63px -5px;
    }
    
    .flair-2600 {
        width: 32px;
        height: 32px;
        background-position: -102px -5px;
    }
    

For a bonus, can someone tell me why is it that when I adjust the ""   .flairoptionpane {width: 130px;"" that it doesn't increase the number of columns to more than three? It widens it, but I still just have three columns.

Astronomy is a large branch of science. It ought to be big because it studies the biggest thing know to exist. The universe itself. And not just the universe, but the objects within it. Everything from galaxies to black holes to planets to comets and asteroids. Sub-disciplines of astronomy deal in physics, chemistry, geology, and other related sciences.

Today is a historic day when a small craft from Earth called New Horizons expands the horizon of human exploration by traveling to the farthest object we've ever reached, Pluto, and beyond. The small space probe has already sent back [stunning images](http://i.imgur.com/eKCJ6al.jpg) and has discovered that Pluto is larger than Eris, the discovery of which was the catalyst for the IAU stripping Pluto of its planethood. It is in celebration of this fact that /r/Astronomy is honored as subreddit of the day. 

The subreddit itself is full of fantastic pictures of [far away galaxies](https://i.imgur.com/MhupMEB.jpg); real ones. It's a place where amateur astronomers [frequently post images that they've taken themselves.](http://i.imgur.com/9y7R3z9.gif) It's a place to get updates on the most recent scientific news and analysis of space related advances. However, I think best of all, is that the community is friendly, knowledgeable, willing and eager to answer astronomy related questions. 

I interviewed moderator /u/VoijaRisa about the sub, the science of astronomy, and the New Horizons' mission to Pluto. 

---

&gt;#1. Let's start by talking about your subreddit. What is the community like? What kind of posts do people find? How does it generally differ from subs like /r/Space and /r/SpacePorn? What are some common topics of discussion? What released fields of science are talked about frequently? 

&gt;&gt;I don't personally dive into the community much, but I wouldn't say that there is a strong set of ""regulars"" like one might expect. Instead, I often see new names popping up offering some great commentary.

&gt;&gt;In regards to how /r/Astronomy differs, there is certainly a lot of overlap. /r/Space seems to concentrate on the human actions in space, such as manned or robotic missions. /r/SpacePorn concentrates on the amazing images produced by both professional and advanced amateurs. /r/Astronomy doesn't prohibit these, but we do try to set some limits on quality in those realms (the most frequently removed posts, after astrology ones, is poor quality phone cam pics).

&gt;&gt;Instead, /r/Astronomy is meant to focus more on the science of Astronomy so our sub tends to have more news articles and press releases of discoveries. But obviously, we do allow that overlap since many of our users tend to be interested in those other areas too.



&gt;#2. What are some of your favorite posts ever to grace /r/astronomy? 

&gt;&gt;I hate promoting slightly off topic posts, but [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/1jn99a/for_my_first_post_my_proposal/) in which a young man asked his girlfriend to marry him through the lens of a telescope made my heart go pitter patter.

&gt;&gt;More towards what we're really looking for in this sub would be [this gif](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/2vakrc/250_years_of_planet_detection_in_60_seconds/) /u/HughO2 submitted looking at the discovery of planets through time. I'm just old enough to remember teachers in elementary school telling me we'd never discover planets outside our solar system. And here we are, several hundred later... [""Do the impossible. See the invisible.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V7aUT13qtM)

&gt;#3. Tell me about your background. What interested you in astronomy, how'd you end up as a mod here? What most interests you about astronomy?

&gt;&gt;I can't even remember what got me interested in Astronomy. I grew up in the suburbs of St. Louis and my family never went camping so it sure wasn't seeing the amazing night sky. I was in my teens before I ever saw the Milky Way or Hale-Bopp came around. It was just always something that I loved. Back in the day when VHS was still a thing, I would rent documentaries like Cosmos nearly as often as I would Ghostbusters. I took a class on Astronomy in High School which didn't really teach me much I didn't know.

&gt;&gt;I went to college to be a Physics teacher, and started taking Astronomy classes there which led to me changing schools and majors to do Astronomy. Unfortunately, my math skills aren't quite there (I swear I'm just minorly dyslexic, not enough to affect me in everyday life, but when you're doing 2 page derivations, you can't make any stupid mistakes) and I didn't go on to grad school.

&gt;&gt;Instead, I took a job in the business world which has me in front of a computer all day. When there's no customers, I sneak on Reddit for a bit. When the call went out for new mods, I figured I'd have sufficient time and signed up.

&gt;&gt;What interests me the most about astronomy? No way I can narrow that down. It's everything. There are certainly parts that don't get me really excited anymore (Oh boy... Another exoplanet.... Lookie... Another survey of a generic cluster...), but these sorts of things are building blocks for larger things that are amazing to my mind. To touch on the examples I just gave, sure, any individual exoplanet might not be a big deal anymore, but we know so many now that we can really test theories about planetary formation and it's changed a lot of what we thought to be true. While one cluster is generally yawn-worthy, look at hundreds of them and you can figure out how stars form and evolve.

&gt;&gt;Big ideas from discreet data on things that we generally can't even touch? Mindblowing.

&gt;#4. Today is a big day. Nine years ago the fastest vehicle ever created by mankind was launched from Earth and today is scheduled to arrive at Pluto. Like you, I've been looking forward to this for a long time. How important is this mission, scientifically? What do you expect that we'll discover? Did you anticipate any findings that have so far been ruled out?


&gt;&gt;Scientifically, I don't find this to be the most impactful mission ever simply because it's so narrow. New Horizons is only really looking at Pluto and other rocky things way out there in the solar system, unlike say the Hubble Space Telescope which can do so many things that it revolutionized several whole fields of Astronomy.

&gt;&gt;But to those that are really into what New Horizons is looking at, this could be a holy grail type mission. Until just the past week or so, the best pictures we had of Pluto were just a few pixels across. We've gotten some spectroscopy before allowing us to know a rough chemical composition, but this is going to be the first time we've ever seen an outer solar system body close up. Who knows what we'll find.

&gt;&gt;And that's what's really exciting to me. I hate the question ""What are we going to learn from this? What's the benefit?"" If we knew the answer to that already, there would be no point in doing it. Ben Franklin didn't fly a proverbial kite in a thunderstorm to develop our electric grid. He did it because we didn't know.

&gt;#5. I don't think we can talk about today without talking about Pluto and planethood. Alan Stern, the principle investigator of the New Horizons mission, said when the probe launched that the IAU definition of planet, which includes the controversial language that a planet must clear its own neighborhood, ""It's an awful definition; it's sloppy science and it would never pass peer review."" Other scientists have criticized the definition for only addressing planets found orbiting our star, and not interstellar objects, or the growing number of exoplanets, or composition, or mass, and because it does not address how the object formed. What are your thoughts on all of this? Is the IAU scientifically sound? Should it be altered? If so, how would you modify it? Simply put, is Pluto a planet? If not, why not? And if not, what are some scientific reasons aside from the ""doesn't clear its own path"" criteria?

&gt;&gt;I'm *honor bound* to call Pluto a planet. I went to the same university as Clyde Tombaugh, the person who discovered Pluto. I'm pretty sure they'd revoke my degree if I said otherwise. However, that's not a satisfying answer so let me flesh out the topic some.

&gt;&gt;One of the first reasons people (especially on facebook for some reason) often give for Pluto planethood is that it's ""always"" been that way. And there's certainly some merit to that. There's a bunch of things in Astronomy that we do because it's ""always"" been that way. Like measuring the brightness of stars in ""magnitudes"". Not only is that system logarithmic, it's backwards! (Brighter objects are lower, even negative). Dumb.

&gt;&gt;Regardless, the magnitude system is functional and that's what it boils down to in my mind. Do we learn something by classifying things certain ways? Does re-categorization help things make more sense? There's certainly instances in Astronomy where we have done major shifts in our organizational structure because it was better. Like in the early 1900's we used to classify stars into boxes based on their spectral lines, ranked A-Z. It wasn't especially helpful until Annie Jump Cannon shuffled the order and deleted a bunch making the new order O,B,A,F,G,K,M which traces the temperature of stars from hottest to coolest.

&gt;&gt;So I'm ok with reclassification if it serves a purpose. Do I think we can learn something by redefining our boxes? Probably. Unfortunately, I don't think our new system is really much better. The definition is too vague and doesn't really make things make more sense. So until we come up with something that makes more sense, I'll keep calling Pluto a planet. And a Kuiper Belt Object.

&gt;#6. What are some other exploration missions that are coming up that people can look forward to?

&gt;&gt;I'm really anticipating the James Webb Space Telescope. Hubble is in desperate need of a successor, and while the JWST will be operating in slightly different wavelengths (looking at slightly different colors of light), it should be huge.

&gt;&gt;Beyond that, I try not to get too excited about much. There's just too much budget cutting or re-prioritizing happening for me to want to get into it. Sadly, there's a lot of half built missions collecting dust so until it's on the launch pad, I keep my expectations minimal.

&gt;#7. What are your favorite past missions?

&gt;&gt;The Hubble Space Telescope in my mind has to take the #1 spot. This one was just a beast in terms of what it cranked out. When talking about such things, I often try to remind people that few individual teams or instruments can really claim credit for a discovery; there's so much collaboration, standing on the shoulders of giants, confirmation using multiple instruments that goes into a discovery that you just can't. But if any instrument could, Hubble was it.

&gt;&gt;The KEPLER space telescope was a big one in my mind too. The number of exoplanets it discovered is huge. As I mentioned earlier on, this raw data on what different solar systems look like is the raw data that will allow us really challenge or theories of formation.


&gt;&gt;I also love the COBE mission. This was the first satellite mission to really measure the comic microwave background. In particular, it was the mission which showed that the data matched our models of the universe to a truly impressive degree which later gave rise to a well known [XKCD comic](http://www.xkcd.com/54/).



&gt;#8. While on the subject of the exploration of our Solar System, if you can pick an object to send an orbiter or lander to, (within our solar system) where would you send it and why?

&gt;&gt;I've always thought another Jupiter mission would be great. There's a lot of excitement about Europa and the potential for life in the liquid water ocean buried beneath a few miles of ice, but that's pretty ambitious and I'm not sure how feasible such a mission would be (although the movie Europa Report was awesome).
Rather, I wouldn't mind seeing a mission to Jupiter just to study all the little moons that get no love. Many of them orbit retrograde (backwards) or at odd angles which is a pretty good indication that they've been captured. Thus, I think we could potentially get a diverse sampling of objects (asteroids, comets, Kuiper Belt Objects,....) all in one location.

&gt;&gt;I'd also like to see another Venus mission. Venus is actually the closest planet to Earth in terms of mass and relatively easy to get to. Unlike all the superior planets (further away from the Sun), you can basically drop a probe to get it to Venus since you're not climbing out of the Sun's gravity well. Of course, it's not that easy. After all, Japan tried to send a mission to Venus in 2010 and missed, but that probe will be swinging around the Sun later this year and will have a second chance.

&gt;#9. What do you think is the most interesting place outside of our solar system and why?

&gt;&gt;The Boomerang nebula is pretty cool in that it is actually colder than the ambient temperature of the universe. There's also a giant void of galaxies that is pretty interesting for why it's so empty. I suppose the ""why"" that's cool is subjective though.

&gt;#10. Many of our readers may be wanting to get into amateur astronomy. Where should they start? What equipment would they need? What can the expect to see? In regards to the latter, do you have some examples of pictures?

&gt;&gt;For most, ""amateur astronomy"" means stargazing. To start that, go outside. Preferably somewhere dark and away from the city. Get some sort of reference guide to help you learn the brightest stars and constellations. There's plenty of great apps out there like Google Sky or for a tablet, Stellarium, but be careful with those as lit screens will kill your night vision.

&gt;&gt;If you're really into it, then it's time to sink some money into some kind of optical device. There's many people who swear by binoculars. Those are great for open clusters like the Pleiades and you can see that the planets aren't just points of light, or that the Milky Way is made up of all sorts of faint stars. But I've never liked having to hold them, so I prefer a telescope. Dobsonians are great starter ones as you can get fairly large ones cheaply but don't tend to have the bells and whistles.

&gt;&gt;With a starter scope (4-8"" objective lens or mirror), you'll start getting more into deep sky objects; galaxies, nebulae, globular clusters, and the like. Pretty much the entire [Messier Catalog](http://www.seasky.org/astronomy/astronomy-messier.html) will be available to find. However, they're not going to look like the pictures. Galaxies will often look like fuzzy blobs unless you're in really good dark sky conditions where you'll start making out the disk. Some nebulae will look pretty good. The Orion nebula is easy to see detail in, but others often leave new people wondering if they're seeing a real astronomical object, or a passing cloud.

&gt;&gt;If you're interested in seeing what things might look like, just hang around /r/Astronomy. Many people post pictures they've taken. While the most impressive ones are taken with advanced equipment, the ones taken with cell phones (that are of sufficient clarity that we keep them up) are often representative of what you can see with a pretty beginner setup.

&gt;#11. If I missed something you'd like to talk about, please add it in here.

&gt;&gt;In answering your questions, we focused pretty heavily on space missions for the science of Astronomy. But I just want to remind people that the vast majority of Astronomy comes from telescopes down here on the Earth. In fact, our technology is getting so good that ground based telescopes are equal if not better than the Hubble is now.
And don't forget that there's actually Astronomy that's done underground. The detection of neutrinos from the sun was done in an old coal mine. There's currently a project called IceCube that's looking for interstellar neutrinos using the Antarctic ice as a shield from all the other noise.

&gt;&gt;Astronomy really is a huge field and, while we lament budget cuts and the like, there's more going on than the pros can even handle. Missions like the aforementioned KEPLER are generating so much data that they are turning to the public to help crowdsource the analysis. [Planet Hunters](http://www.planethunters.org/) is a big one. But there's many more out there that need people. There's bunches over at [Galaxy Zoo](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/) from classifying galaxies to marking craters on the moon.
So go out and discover something.

Before we can talk about this subreddit, we need to know what a gif is. I can go into a lot a technical mumbo jumbo, but basically these days we're calling a gif a short video that's a few seconds and doesn't play sound. It's important that these clips are short and load fast because our attention spans as redditors are really, really tiny. 

Okay, now that we know what I mean when I say ""gif"" do you know what a tournament is? I hope so because I am not 'splaining it. 

What the mods of /r/GifTournament do is have a big ass contest every so often, pitting the best gif makers from all over reddit against one and another. Oh, they come from /r/HighQualityGifs, and /r/DubbedGIFS, and /r/shittyreactiongifs, and well, every gif corner that reddit has to offer, which are a lot. 

http://i.imgur.com/UZpU93b.gifv

The current tournament is Battle #4 and [round three](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifTournament/comments/3d2zjd/giftournament_battle_4_round_3/]) just began. It's too late to enter, but it's damn entertaining to check it out as a spectator and upvote the gifs you like. 

You are probably waiting to see some examples, amirite? So here are some from Battle #2.

For more details and stuff I send a modmail to the sub. /u/hero0fwar, a man of few words, had this to say. 

&gt;#1. How did this whole thing get started?

&gt;&gt;This sub started because I was high one night watching blood sport and I thought, gifs need a kumite

&gt;#2. How can our readers get involved? How can someone participate if they don't make dank gifs?

&gt;&gt;Get involved by following and signing up when the seeding happens. What do non giffers get? Best God damn entertainment of their lives.

&gt;#3. How does this even work?

&gt;&gt;Structure, basically NCAA March Madness for gifs. Battles go live every Sunday until there is one man left standing.

Now, as for this CSS, it's a work in progress. I wanted to get something up real quick to make this sub look readable. There's a lot to do still, so I wanted to ask everyone for suggestions. First, what icons would you like to see? I haven't added upvote/downvote buttons, a mail icon, and I am using the standard Naut sprite sheet for other icons still. I was thinking about adapting something similar for the voting icons as what we use currently on /r/GamingGifs, but obviously AVGN related. 

Along those same lines, what do you think would make killer user flairs? 

Let me know if y'all have any other CSS suggestions.

I am not too interested in it because I have a working one. But it might be nice to have to trade or sell. 

Well, they have like 40 or some televisions. So I decide to test it before getting it, unlike the $40 a dropped on a PS3 two weeks ago (which did not work and could not be fixed by me). 

I haul a television over to the testing area, connect it up, nothing. The PS2 power light is on and green, so I want to make sure it's not the TV. 

I get another one. Haul it over. Plug it in doesn't turn on. 

&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

I end up doing this two more times. Which happens to have been all of the TVs under 20 inches. So now I am on to bigger. 

I lug a TV over, and it powers up Yay!

The channel buttons don't work. 

I get another one. Lug it over. Hook it up. It's already tuned to channel 3. The PS2 boots up. POOF! The tube makes a loud sound and doesn't come back on. 

The next smallest TV is like 32 inches. Lug it over. Hook it all up. 

Does it turn on? Check!

Do the channel buttons work? Check! 

I pop a game in the PS2 and... it doesn't read. I look at the disk. It's wrecked. I go back and grab another one. Pop it in and...


PS2 is fried, as I figured. 

That whole process took 40 minutes. ",retrogaming,[rant post] Just Goodwill things,http://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/3cq6v9/rant_post_just_goodwill_things/

A great one, really. However, it seems like one of those things that was just half implemented. However, they're cumbersome and hard for users to find. 

I would like to see a system put in place where /m/nameofmulti works the same as /r/nameofsub. 

I would limit this to multis where all of the subreddits opted in. Examples of such multis are the SFWPorn Network, NationalPhotoSubs, Retro Gaming Network, and the Shitty Network. I know there are more, but these are just off of the top of my head. 

When there exist these multis, allow users to sub to them specifically. Allow multiple curators, and allow the curators to style the CSS. Multis can be a powerful tool. It's a good way for subs to get noticed. But as it stands they are very difficult to use, and rely on prominent placing within subreddits, and for users to click on them.

It takes well placed xposts, the luck of getting picked for an ad in the sidebar, or a well placed comment in a rising thread for a subreddit to take off. 

I've spoken with /u/Drunken_Economist about this too. Reddit needs a subreddit discovery tool. 

People don't know how to find subreddits or use their hot page. I've even talked to people in /r/CenturyClub, meaning they've earned 100k karma, and they still don't know how to use the hot page or why they should bother subscribing to subs. 

I'd like to see a module in the sidebar, like where the ad is, that says, ""hey, you like /r/gaming? Maybe you'd like /r/consoles, /r/retrogaming, or /r/nintendo"" or something to that effect. 

Furthermore, I am a big fan of reddit and I am an advocate. I tell my friends all of the time to get on reddit. Here's the thing. They get on reddit, look at their front page, see a bunch of links, and then they are confused and peace out. These are people who are just like me. They're the ideal candidates to become redditors. People who are disappointed with the lack of community on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, people who grew up visiting internet forums who miss that community, and have no idea how to find, join, and become a part of communities on reddit. The one time I got a friend to join reddit I made his account for him, unsubbed him from the defaults, and picked a bunch of communities for him and then gave him the account. 

You know, I don't even know how to get to the search tool for subreddits without going to the URL and typing gibberish like /r/asdlfkdsalfkjds so that it pops me into the search tool. 

Along those lines, the idea of having default subreddits is antiquated. A new user would have a better experience if they were presented with a tool that asks them about their interests and based on those interests in suggests subreddits of all sizes for them to join. The qualifier for a sub to be presented should be based on activity, not subscriber count. There are a lot of very active subs for specific interests that are under 10,000 subscribers. That way they start out with their hot page that contains stuff that they're interested in. Then you could make the default landing page be /r/all instead of the defaults for people who are not signed in. Or only keep defaults for non-members. Whatever. 

Speaking of user experience, some RES features need to be part of the site, specifically embedded images and videos. New users are confounded that they need to go off site to see all of the content. I tell them, ""well, you need this third party plug-in"" and the response is always WTF. 

I don't know if you guys run focus groups, but you should. These groups should not just include default mods either. But mods of small subs and regular reddit users who aren't mods. It should be obvious, but the rebellion against reddit last week had nothing to do with mod tools. Redditors not only don't care, but they don't like mods in general. They're just frustrated by a bad user experience and they used the mod rebellion as an excuse to channel that frustration.  

I think that what I've outlined here are core basic points that are necessary for reddit to survive the next few years. You're really the only social media site that is built around communities. Communities are the strength of reddit. We need tools to foster the growth of communities. That's the number one thing that reddit needs but doesn't have. It's just smart business. 

Edit: One more thing. The trending subreddits is great, but it'd be better if they appeared sitewide. ",ModSupport,Flat out there needs to be a better way for users to discover subreddits,http://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/3ciqrl/flat_out_there_needs_to_be_a_better_way_for_users/

As you may know, anyone on reddit can report any post or comment to the moderators anonymously. Don't believe me? Just look down at the set of links below this post. 

Reporting a post a way that you can tell moderators that a post doesn't belong. Is it spam? Does it contain personal information? Should it be removed for some other reason? If so, then you can fill in the blank! Moderators are notified of these reports and then make a decision on whether to remove or approve the reported post. 

However, not all redditors use this feature in good faith. Some use it as a ""super downvote."" Yet others are snarky in when the fill in the blanks. Aaaaaand that's where /r/BestOfReports comes in. It's a fun sub where moderators share some of the wackiest reports they've ever received. 

What now? You wanna see some examples? Okay. Let's do that then. 

* Mods of /r/videos received [this report](https://i.imgur.com/cfwxjit.png). What's rule #3 you ask? No witch hunting. Ba da tush! 

* The person who made [this report](https://i.imgur.com/DGoXnuY.png) was seemingly trying to make a valid point. 

* [Here's a comment that was reported because OP delivered.](https://i.imgur.com/3PPoul3.png)

I am sure you get the point by now, but these are fun so let's look at a few more. 

* [Here's what the mods of /r/sweden have to deal with every single time one of their posts reaches /r/all.](https://i.imgur.com/JPE7sMF.png) 

* Some people actually think it's a good idea to use the report feature [to insult the moderators.](https://i.imgur.com/C30mhZb.png)

* [This poor fellow just didn't know what to do!](https://i.imgur.com/OlkO3PT.png)

* Here's one of mine. [This disgruntled Pluto fan felt that this /r/charts post wasn't accurate.](http://i.imgur.com/FXmE8wZ.png)

* [This guy thinks reddit mods have control over Google](https://i.imgur.com/mMO7n51.png). Can Google even ban people?

* [I'll end this list on a positive note.](https://i.imgur.com/ZZtXcXA.png)

&gt;#1. How'd this become a thing?

&gt;&gt;**/u/K_Lobstah:** I made it as a joke when they announced report reasons I think.

&gt;&gt;**/u/agentlame:** I made /r/superdownvote to showcase moronic shit people report. When report reasons came along klobs stole my idea and thunder.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Werner__Herzog:** K_Lob made it when report reasons where announced, like literally 30 minutes after the announcement. Dude had a killer instinct that day.

&gt;&gt;**/u/the_dinks:** My best friend (and huge Detroit Tigers fan) /u/K_Lobstah had just inherited massive land holdings from his uncle, a Duke, and we were smoking Salvia on his newly acquired veranda when he turned to me and asked, ""wouldn't it be funny to have a subreddit centered around the silly reports we get?"" I'm not sure what happened next, but I do know I woke up the next morning with a tattoo of French electronica group Air's faces on my ass and a new subreddit in my modbox.

&gt;&gt;**/u/ManWithoutModem:**  ayy lmao



&gt;#2. Do you think it's easy for a person who doesn't mod to view the sub and get why this shit is so fucking funny?

&gt;&gt;**/u/K_Lobstah:** how the shit would I know the answer to that question I'm not a scientist.

&gt;&gt;**/u/agentlame:** Funny is universal. I suspect most subscribers aren't even mods.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Werner__Herzog:** Yeah, mostly. A lot of people who comment here don't moderate any subreddits.

&gt;&gt;**/u/the_dinks:** If you've ever organized a bake sale, you know what it's like to deal with the various idiots that surround you. Some of the humor is dependent on reddit ""inside jokes,"" but it doesn't exactly take a lot of brainpower to understand ""ayy lmao.""

&gt;&gt;**/u/Gilgamesh-:** The whole idea of it being a report and the anonymity of that report makes it pretty easy to laugh at them.

&gt;&gt;**/u/ManWithoutModem:**  not at all to be honest. shoutout to /r/needamod!

&gt;&gt;**/u/stopscopiesme:**  the super-downvote kind of reports translate well, but automoderator mistakes and mod call-outs do not

&gt;&gt;* on subreddits in general: 5-30% are probably jokes

&gt;&gt;* on r/BestOfReports: 100% are probably jokes, [seriously it stopped being funny when the sub was about two days old](https://i.imgur.com/fZ9fO1u.png) 

&gt;&gt;**/u/the_dinks:** think it's funnier when the reports are ""found"" humor, rather than forced, but if it's funny I'll post it regardless. Don't try too hard to get on the sub, though, that shit's tired.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Gilgamesh-:** Most of the reports posted here are probably serious - people are silly. A significant minority will be jokes, though.

&gt;&gt;**/u/ManWithoutModem:**  like 50/50



&gt;#5. Do you have any advice for users who report submissions?


&gt;&gt;**/u/K_Lobstah:** No one would listen to it anyway.

&gt;&gt;**/u/agentlame:** ""Breaking reddit"" doesn't mean what you think it means.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Werner__Herzog:** Chose an actual report reason.

&gt;&gt;**/u/the_dinks:** Don't be afraid to report. We rely on reports to do the job the admins refuse to help us with.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Gilgamesh-:** If you click ""other"", put text in the box.

&gt;&gt;**/u/ManWithoutModem:**  don't call us names please (i've seen reports telling me to kill myself)


&gt;&gt;**/u/stopscopiesme:**  &lt;no reason&gt; reduces the likelihood that your report will cause a removal. writing ""reported"" is does not qualify as a report reason

&gt;#6. Who even are you and why are you talking to me?


&gt;&gt;**/u/K_Lobstah:**  I'm not even sure I know which subreddit we're talking about.

&gt;&gt;**/u/agentlame:** I am become cancer. Destroyer of reddit.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Werner__Herzog:** It's me, Werner.

&gt;&gt;**/u/the_dinks:** I'm /u/the_dinks , and responding to modmail inquiries is the only way to quiet the screams in my head.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Gilgamesh-:** go away

&gt;&gt;**/u/ManWithoutModem:**  no idea, i usually don't answer questions for these tbh.

&gt;&gt;**/u/stopscopiesme:**  I'm a metacancer modwhore, and when K_Lobstah makes a cool subreddit, I beg him to mod me until he gets so annoyed he gives in

&gt;#7. What's the most annoying report you've had?

&gt;&gt;**/u/K_Lobstah:** Can't remember but I bet you guys get some pretty dumb ones when you post this on srotd

&gt;&gt;**/u/agentlame:** Most are legit. Many are funny. Some are dumb. Few are annoying.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Werner__Herzog:** *User report: 1: &lt;no reason&gt;*

&gt;&gt;**/u/the_dinks:** I don't think any report is particularly annoying, but [this one](http://imgur.com/a/M0XFh#dMEushh)  puzzles me. Even if I wasn't a mod, it's a fuckin' cat sub. Who cares?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Gilgamesh-:** Every single one of the reports on /r/bestofreports.

&gt;&gt;**/u/ManWithoutModem:**  someone telling the mod team to die of cancer for not removing a post that had 60 upvotes and was 30 minutes old.

&gt;&gt;**/u/stopscopiesme:**  there are people in /r/energy who are constantly reporting each other's comment calling one another paid shills and accusing each other of being stalkers. it's more annoying than funny so I don't have screenshots

&gt;#8. Add whatever you like here.

&gt;&gt;**/u/K_Lobstah:** Ron Paul 2020

&gt;&gt;**/u/agentlame:** /r/fucking

&gt;&gt;**/u/Werner__Herzog:** The universe is indifferent.

&gt;&gt;**/u/angrypotato1:** Hey


&gt;&gt;**/u/the_dinks:** Also, go listen to DJ Koze's new DJ-Kicks mix. It's very good.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Gilgamesh-:** no

&gt;&gt;**/u/ManWithoutModem:**  dOK]

&gt;&gt;**/u/splattypus:** [Hey Zadoc](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/fgwv.gif)

&gt;&gt;**/u/Clarkey7163:** Can I just get a bunch of Aussie stereotypes as my answers?

&gt;&gt;Thanks!

&gt;&gt;*[Editors Note: I thought about this and didn't. Mostly because I don't know many.]*

&gt;&gt;**/u/stopscopiesme:**  I'm really pleased with the popularity of our subreddit. It makes me wish that a subreddit for modmail screenshots could be a thing, but a lot of mods think it violates the privacy of our users. The shit we tend to get in modmail is so much more vitriolic and crazy

**4,784,174** *readers for* **7 years!**

A lot of great comments on reddit go unnoticed. Informative posts. Great stories. Epic debates, and just things that are funny. To prevent these gems from falling through the cracks, /r/bestof steps up to both immortalize them and expose them to a large audience. 

It should be noted that /r/bestof is for excellent comments only, not great top level posts. People wanting to post to the subreddit should read the sidebar first and also the submission instructions. There are two very important rules. 

1. Posts must be made with np links. That's when you replace the ""www"" in a reddit URL with ""np."" This puts the links in ""no participation"" mode. On certain subreddits when people follow an np link then they cannot participate. This prevents a lot of brigading, which, by the way, can earn you a shadowban on reddit. For more in-depth information on this feature please see /r/NoParticipation.  

2. When you submit a post you must add ""?context=3"" to the end of the URL. This allows a person who follows the link to see related replies to the comment. 

So, what makes /r/bestof worthwhile for you to subscribe to?

The subreddit plays two very important roles on reddit. 

Of course it helps people find interesting comments that might have otherwise been missed. For example, last month /u/GovSchwarzenegger, yes, *that* Schwarzenegger, popped into /r/gainit to help encourage a demoralized gym goer [with this comment.](http://np.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/2zfjmf/bad_day_at_the_gym_completely_demoralized/cpksp8e?context=3) 

Along the same lines, in the previous example I bet you've never heard of /r/gainit before, which if you couldn't tell from the name is a subreddit for people looking to put on lean weight. /r/bestof helps to give exposure to smaller subs like this. 

As a meta subreddit, the community is diverse, and the feel of the conversation differs from one thread to another. However, every day there's at least one link posted per day that almost everyone can relate to in one way or another. 

For more on the community let's talk to the elite mod team and get to know them a little better. 


&gt;#1. Please tell us a little about you. What do you like to do most on reddit? How'd you end up as a mod on /r/bestof?

&gt;&gt;**/u/stopscopiesme:**  I'm an on-again-off-again student, and I'm currently an avid reader of /r/bestofreports. When discussing adding new mods, my name was brought up, despite no one here really ""knowing"" me. The cabal works in mysterious ways.

&gt;&gt;**/u/davidreiss666:** I've been on Reddit for a long time now. Over eight years. I like to moderate and approve submissions for users. I also like to remove spam and report the spammers to the admins. I've done about 100,000 spam reports in my time on Reddit.

&gt;&gt;I started out moderating /r/History and /r/Scifi several years ago. And since then I have been added to a lot of other subreddits, including /r/Bestof. Mostly because other mods seem to think I am a good mod to have around.

&gt;&gt;**/u/GodOfAtheism:**  [I post dank memes.](http://i.imgur.com/s9bS1.jpg) Some are [danker](http://i.imgur.com/eG6TTX6.jpg) than others. I'm told I'm [moderately competent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h10D-Q0fWz4) but I find that hard to believe. I got brought on here because despite all that, I put in work and am pretty consistently on top of the mod queue.

&gt;&gt;**/u/soupyhands:**  i like to help people out. some users havent been around as long as we have and could benefit from our experience. if you have a question just message the mods, we'd be pleased to help you out.

&gt;#2. /r/bestof features the best comments on reddit. In your opinion, what is the best of the best?


&gt;&gt;**/u/davidreiss666:** I like history a lot. So, I like submissions of comments from /r/History, /r/AskHistorians, and similar typess of subreddits. I also like Politics and sometimes there is a good comment at /r/Politics (a much maligned subreddit) that can yield interesting discussion away from the overly partisan atmosphere.

&gt;&gt;**/u/GodOfAtheism:** Basically everything /u/Here_Comes_The_King posts.

&gt;&gt;**/u/soupyhands:** i like stuff from /r/space and /r/explainitlikeimfive, as well as /r/personalfinance and /r/legaladvice

&gt;#3. What makes the /r/bestof community stand out from the rest of reddit? What makes it unique?

&gt;&gt;**/u/stopscopiesme:** It's a bit more populist than other reddit exclusives like r/IAmA or r/blog. Anyone's comment can get submitted and rocket into prominence. As the largest meta subreddit, we cause the largest vote swings, which is not a way the moderators of r/bestof like to stand out.

&gt;&gt;**/u/GodOfAtheism:**  The breadth of comments linked. You can see [persuasive arguments](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/32u0po/a_great_explanation_of_why_and_how_children/), [interesting fiction](https://np.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2ez940/wp_lucifer_the_devil_himself_is_your_best_friend/ck4elii?context=3), [neat stories from folks' real lives](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/2inz6v/human_physiology_teacher_unwittingly_creates/), be [brought up](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/2zq47o/arnold_shows_up_to_help_a_demoralized_gymgoer/), or be [brought down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/2rmzqo/only_martyrs_teach_now_in_america_a_teacher/)

&gt;&gt;**/u/soupyhands:** bestof is a massive meta sub which can be a good thing or a bad thing. we try to make sure that the stuff posted here is high quality and isnt harassing anyone. submissions here can get big fast so we appreciate when users get involved by hitting report on inappropriate posts.


&gt;#4. What do you find is the biggest challenge to moderating the sub?

&gt;&gt;**/u/stopscopiesme:** If we don't catch it fast enough, r/bestof can end up handing out a ridiculous amount of downvotes. (I believe there have been several times a comment went below -1000). I have wondered if we couldn't be stricter and remove things before they became a massive vote brigade, but sometimes the best you can do is damage control.

&gt;&gt;We highlight comments and self posts, not submissions. Guise pls, stop submitting links to things that are the full comments of a link to a picture or news article.

&gt;&gt;**/u/davidreiss666:** Keeping the quality high requires us to intervene a lot. Remove submissions that aren't up to snuff. Sometimes we talk to other mod teams to see if they want a submission removed from /r/Bestof. We are a subreddit with more than Four million subscribers. In the past there have been issues where the Bestof community and submitted community didn't mesh well with us, as such we will remove a submission at the submitted mod-teams request. No questions asked.

&gt;&gt;**/u/soupyhands:** because of the size of the sub content is persistent which makes it tough to stay on top of the bad apples. we try our best.

&gt;#5. I feel like a lot of people are confused about how np links. Can you tell us briefly what that is, what it does, why they're used, and what the dangers are of participating in a thread that is linked to from /r/bestof?

&gt;&gt;**/u/stopscopiesme:**  NP is interesting because it's user created and implemented if and only if a subreddit's mods put it in. Despite it not being native to the site, the admins have encouraged it. There are many many subreddits who don't have it in their stylesheet, and therefore an NP link to them is the same as a WWW one. An NP link does not magically apply the CSS to any subreddit. And even IF a subreddit uses the CSS, it's incredibly easy for someone who wants to vote brigade to disable it. For NP to work, it requires the compliance of three parties: the subreddit that's doing the linking, the subreddit that is linked, and the people viewing the linked thread. It's very flawed and I hope the admins will come up with something better.

&gt;&gt;**/u/davidreiss666:** If a user ignores NP and votes, the admins sometimes will, in cases where users are acting negatively in the other subreddit, shadow ban their accounts.

&gt;&gt;**/u/GodOfAtheism:**  No Participation functions via CSS and removes the vote buttons and commenting options. It's a good faith measure intended to prevent folks from commenting. While there is no specific rule on reddit against linking to a thread or particular comments within one, the admins tend to not look favorably on things involving folks all voting one way for a particular purpose. This can lead to [shadowbanning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbanning) offenders. We try to be good neighbors by mandating NP on all links.**

&gt;&gt;**/u/soupyhands:** np is our attempt to keep the metaredditors from bestof from getting involved in other subreddits threads. its somewhat effective but only if the other subreddit uses the np css on their stylesheet, which makes it hit and miss. its the best of a limited set of tools that will allow the sub to function and avoid brigades when possible. we know the sub still brigades but we have always responded to requests from other mods to keep our subscribers out of their subreddits.

&gt;#6. Is there anything else you'd like to add? 

&gt;&gt;**/u/davidreiss666:** Where ever you go, there you are.

&gt;&gt;**/u/GodOfAtheism:**  Subs which are pretty dope and you should prob check out if they reflect your interests:

&gt;&gt;* /r/artisanvideos/ - It's masters of their craft doing their thing, typical video length is in the ten minute range.

&gt;&gt;* /r/indepthstories/ - Long form articles about all sorts of stuff.

&gt;&gt;* /r/goodlongposts/ - It's an entirely bot run sub which exclusively links to longer reddit comments in a select group of subs that have been significantly upvoted.

&gt;&gt;* /r/braveryjerk - An artistic masterpiece of a subreddit with a highly engaged community of folks deeply interested in its content.

&gt;&gt;Shameless plugs:

&gt;&gt;* /r/rainymood - Take chill music. Put on rainymood.com. Chillax.

&gt;&gt;* /r/fite_me_irl - We are all warriors on the inside.


&gt;&gt;**/u/soupyhands:** if you want to try something new, head over to /r/bouldering and have fun while getting fit. if you need tunes check out /r/classictrance :)

http://i.imgur.com/9YSMuUU.jpg

The AMA had a rocky start. First the time posted was 9:30 PST, not specifying it was AM or PM. Most assumed it was 9:30am, but after about a half an hour of there being no AMA it was announced that it was actually going to be 9:30 at night. Then the AMA was posted seven hours before it actually begin, so the mods of /r/IAmA removed it. However, /u/Yu_Suzuki started answering questions in the deleted thread. Fortunately, it didn't take them long to figure out the mistake. 

After the false start Yu Suzuki answered our questions for about **five hours straight**. Which is pretty great. I really applaud him for doing that. It's extra hard work considering that he had to work through a translator for most of it. 

**The majority of the AMA was, of course, focused around *Shenmue III*. Here's what we learned about the game.**

One controversy surrounding *Shenmue III* was that people were worried that the villages discussed in the stretch goals would not be included if the stretch goals weren't met. It was confirmed that the villages are already in the game, and that the stretch goals are to expand them or to ""power them up"" as Yu Suzuki put it. 

Here the details shared about the Choubu and Bailu villages. 

&gt;Choubu is a riverside village with lots of shops, souvenir stores, hotels and temples. The quests in this village should be very enjoyable, I think.

&gt;Bailu is the village where Shenhua was raised and also a place that Ryo's father, Iwao, had visited when he was younger. Here as well the quests will play an important role as Ryo and Shenhua start their journey.

A lot of elements from previous games will be returning, including the day/night and weather cycles. Other elements are being considered. These include the journal, the ability to practice moves, and the FREE battle system. Part time jobs will be available to make money as in past games and the return of the forklift will be a Kickstarter stretch goal. The return of duck races is a possibility. Even assets from the original games will be reused. 

When asked if *Shenmue III* will see the introduction of a bicycle, Yu Suzuki responded that in *Shenmue* there was a 60 horsepower bike, and in *Shenmue III* there may be something like a one horsepower bike. Perhaps an actual horse? Ryo’s face bandage will return, but there may be a special option to remove it; such an option is under consideration. 

The Rapport and Character Perspective Systems were explained. “In Shenmue III the ""Rapport System"" will govern changes in Shenhua's actions depending on your conversations with or actions towards her. The ""Character Perspective System"" will highlight different characters personalities as they go through the story.” The latter is a $5 million stretch goal. Yu Suzuki also stated that if $5 million is hit then all of the things he really wants to do in *Shenmue III* will become a reality. He added that if $10 million is reached “it will truly have the features of an open world.” Of course, the meaning of that statement is open to interpretation. 

Ryo's face model from the Kickstarter trailer has been criticized by fans. Yu Suzuki admitted that it's not the final version. He has a vision in his mind of how Ryo's face should look. It's not there yet but it will be realized before the game is finalized. 

As for new features, something resembling a co-op or vs. mode is being considered for *Shenmue III.*

Yu Suzuki will be refining the controls in *Shenmue III* to make them more user friendly. While previous games in the franchise had very good controls, small things like open drawers could be a little clunky. Refining the controls after so many years is expected. 

Since Ys Net in independent of Sega it was asked whether or popular IPs on Sony consoles would make their way into the game in the forms of capsule toys. No decisions have been made on what toys will be in the game. 

It is confirmed that there will be a version of the game that uses Japanese voice actors. It is not decided if all regions will have the option to use the Japanese dub with English subtitles. 

When directly asked if arcade games will return in Shenmue III, Yu Suzuki responds, ""I plan on making plans."" Very ambiguous. Possible yes? It could mean that he has to obtain licenses from Sega and other companies to get arcades in the game. It’d be cool to play *Galaga* or *Space Invaders* alongside *After Burner*. 

**Here's what we learned about Shenmue in general**

The original game was set to include 16 chapters. However we've now learned that it has been whittled down to eleven. We know already that a chapter taking place on the boat between the first and second games was removed and later released in comic book form. It's possible that we'll see something similar happen, or that the chapters have been condenses. The entirety of the story will span 4-5 games. 

The story of *Shenmue* was inspired by trips that Yu Suzuki made to China while he was location hunting during development of *Virtua Fighter.* Shenmue itself is tree imagined by Yu Suzuki that is  like a cherry blossom tree and only blooms in the spring. 

When asked if Ryo will ever use a sword Yu Suzuki declined to comment, leaving open the possibility that weapons-based combat in the Shenmue world could happen. 

The reason why *Shenmue* is set in the 80s instead of the present day to ""put forward the differences in culture and values between the two periods.""

By now it should be obvious to anyone that *Shenmue III* won’t conclude the story. A sequel is contingent on fans liking the new game. ""If the fans are not happy with 3 there will not be a 4. So I please hope we can together make this game the best it can be."" I am sure sales will have something to do with it as well. 

The question of new releases of the original games has come up. Sega would be responsible for any remasters and re-releases of *Shenmue I* and *II*. If it looks like *Shenmue III* is going to be a hit, and if it turns out to be a commercial success, it would be a smart move on Sega’s part to capitalize on that. 

If Ryo ever returns to Japan it will not be in *Shenmue III*. 

Yu Suzuki loves the idea of incorporating VR and using it “to peer into the world of Shenmue, but there are no plans for it. 

**Here's what we've learned about the Kickstarter campaign**

After the campaign ends it hasn't been determined whether or not Yu Suzuki's company, Ys Net, will accept Paypal donations similar to the model used by *Star Citizen.* Nonetheless, this option is being considered. 

We should expect more funding tiers for the Kickstarter, in particular between the $500 and $3000 mark.

**Here are some things we learned about Yu Suzuki**

His favorite console is Dreamcast. He had a hand in designing both the hardware and several important games for the console. He’s an avid airsoft player. Airsoft is kind of like paint ball, but with guns that are realistic approximations of real weapons that shoot plastic BBs. Apparently there have been airsoft battles in the office. He’s a pet owner and has three Yorkshire terriers and a turtle. He’s a fan of Amine, but only older stuff. 

Yu Suzuki still works directly on games by writing algorithms, logic verification, and by making simple prototypes. 

When asked about the state of gaming in Japan Yu Suzuki responded that he believes the popularity of mobile games in the Japanese market is causing game budgets to decrease, making it harder for designers to express their vision. His hope is that the console and PC markets will gain in popularity to reverse this trend.

It’s his opinion that the essence of an arcade game is that there is only a three minute window to express what the game is.

If Ryo were to ever face Akira (from Virtua Fighter) then Akira would win because he has been around for five games whereas Ryo has only been around for three. 

A part of one of my questions asked if Yu Suzuki had a favorite game that he developed other than *Shenmue.* He replied, “I had fun making all the games I worked on, and can't say one was better than another.” Good answer. 

Yu Suzuki's favorite song from Shenmue is the Tomato Mart theme.

Why does Yu Suzuki create? ""Why does one climb the mountain? The shark cannot breath when it does not swim.""

Updates:

Okay, so this has been handled and executed very poorly. Here are the highlights:

* The original post on Kickstarter said 9:30 PST with no AM or PM designation 
* It was updated a little after 10am to say it would be 9:30pm
* A post was made on Kickstarter linking to am [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ag05q/i_am_yu_suzuki_ama/) 
* However, /u/Yu_Suzuki didn't come to the AMA because it was still more than seven hours away. The mods removed it. 
* It's past 9:30 and still no AMA

More updates:

/u/Yu_Suzuki is now answering questions in the deleted thread. 

Update 3: 

**New AMA is live!**

* Yu Suzuki would like to bring the journal back and will look into it. 
* Yu Suzuki believes that the popularity of mobile games in the Japanese market is causing game budgets to decrease, making it harder for designers to express their vision. His hope is that the console and PC markets will gain in popularity to reverse this trend.
* Shenmue III might contain something like a 1 horsepower bike. Perhaps an actual horse?  
* The essence of an arcade game is that there is only a 3 minute window to express what the game is.
* Something resembling a co-op or vs. mode is being considered for Shenmue III. 
* In Shenmue III the ""Rapport System"" will govern changes in Shenhua's actions depending on your conversations with or actions towards her. The ""Character Perspective System"" will highlight different characters personalities as they go through the story.
* Shenmue III will contain part time jobs. It's hinted at the stretch goals may include the forklift job. Edit: Now confirmed. 
* It looks we'll get the most complete version of Shenmue III if the [$10 million mark](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ahcwf/i_am_yu_suzuki_new_posting/cscpvmm) is hit.
* Akira would defeat Ryo in a fight. 
* Possible return of duck racing. 
* Yu Suzuki declines to reveal whether or not Ryo will ever use a sword.
* Yu Suzuki answers one of my questions. ""I had fun making all the games I worked on, and can't say one was better than another.""
* Shenmue is set in the 80s instead of the present day to ""put forward the differences in culture and values between the two periods.""
* Yu Suzuki's favorite song from Shenmue is the Tomato Mart theme.
* Expect more funding tiers for the Kickstarter, in particular between the $500 and $3000 mark. 
* Shenmue IV is contingent on fans liking Shenmue III. ""If the fans are not happy with 3 there will not be a 4. So I please hope we can together make this game the best it can be.""
* Dreamcast is Yu Suzuki's favorite console. 
* When directly asked if arcade games will return in Shenmue III, Yu Suzuki responds, ""I plan on making plans."" Very ambiguous. Possible yes? 
* Why does Yu Suzuki create? ""Why does one climb the mountain?
The shark cannot breath when it does not swim.""
* Yu Suzuki has three Yorkshire terriers and a turtle as pets.
* Sega would be responsible for any remasters and re-releases of Shenmue I and II. 
* [Details about Chobu and Bailu villages.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ahcwf/i_am_yu_suzuki_new_posting/cscr3gd)
* The villages mentioned in the stretch goal are already in the game. The stretch goals are to add extras to them. Not to add the villages. 
* Ryo may one day return to Japan, but it won't be in Shenmue III. ",retrogaming,Yu Suzuki will be on reddit TODAY!,http://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/3aey6d/yu_suzuki_will_be_on_reddit_today/

For the past ten years I've been an instructional designer and training specialist. My skills are in writing, teaching, and communicating ideas. A few years ago I was laid off from my federal job due to sequestration. I found that not having finished college when I was younger was preventing me from getting interviews. So, I decided to go back to college and finish up a degree in communications, and then go back to my career. 

I've always been really interested in science, especially planetary sciences. As a part of my degree I am required to have two sciences and two labs. I took Geology for both, and a third one and a lab as an elective, which I begin next semester. They are 101, historical geology, and Astrogeology. 

One thing I know is that I hate maps. That's not my thing. Otherwise, it all clicks very well with me, and it was always an interest of mine. I am not sure what I would be able to do as a geologist with just a bachelor's, however. I do not plan to get a master's or a PhD. 

I can already teach and write. I don't even know what kind of jobs are really out there, or if they are obtainable. It does occur to me that I might be happier working with science rather than writing classes on change in the workplace or on pivot tables in Excel. I mean, I am good at those things, but it's not like it'll ever be fulfilling. Not to say that geology would be. But maybe. 

I am sure you guys see these kinds of posts frequently. But any responses would be nice. 

Am I too old? Are there jobs? What kind are there? Would a bachelor's even be useful? Whatever you can tell me would be great. Thanks. ",geology,"So, I am considering a career in geology.
