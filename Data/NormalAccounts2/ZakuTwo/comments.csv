74,"Austrian economists were responsible for a lot of the simplest theoretical background of modern mainstream economics, but their school of thought started to fracture with study of the Great Depression. People who still self identify as Austrians today are usually pushing two main ideas: that empirical study of the economy is pointless because they don't think it's possible for their theoretical models to be wrong (and if they appear to be wrong in empirical studies, the studies are just missing something), and that central banking does more harm than good.  You could argue the latter since it's more of a value judgement than an objective argument (although you'd be up against basically every economist in the world who isn't an Austrian or Marxist), but wholesale rejection of econometrics in favor of a priori theories is utterly ridiculous.  

The Chicago School was skeptical of econometrics but accepted central banking; it doesn't really exist as an actual group anymore like Austrian economics does because it has a bunch of successors who interpret newer events differently, unlike modern-day Austrians who claim the economic history of the past century perfectly conforms to their original models.

91,"That's possible against theater-range assets, but ICBMs are deep in the middle of nowhere to protect them from conventional strikes (the Dakotas and a few sites in Russia that I can't remember off the to of my head). Cruise missiles and bombers are vulnerable to SAMs and interceptors, so ballistic missiles are the only real option for counterforce strikes on silos. Conventional intercontinental ballistic missiles could be developed, but there's no point since any intercontinental ballistic launch is assumed to be nuclear-tipped. The Chinese have conventional (slightly longer than?) theater-range ballistic missiles for targeting carriers and airbases, but those were developed for a practical purpose (countering the efficiency of Aegis-equipped ships against regular ASMs). America talked about conventional sub-launched ballistic missiles but that was shot down because they could be confused for nuclear launches by observers.  The Soviets and NATO had conventional and nuclear theater-range missiles but they've been rendered obsolete against superpowers by missile defenses (THAAD, PAC-3, S-300/400, Iron Dome). 

Also it's worth noting that silo fields are spaced out enough that you need a warhead for each individual silo, which is why they take so many enemy nukes to target. 

Hypersonic missiles (conventional and/or nuclear) are probably the future of strategic deterrence but we're a decade or so from functional prototypes. The good news is that they're especially geared towards counterforce strikes rather than hitting population centers, but only the US has actually made real progress on or shown a lot of interest in them.

112,"At the very least, though, soft SF still concerns itself with the sociological, military, political, etc. effects of its technologies. DS9 was the only Trek series that really concerned itself with how this society can practically function for normal people. The others have FTL, replicators, and phasers as window dressing for morality plays that involve supernatural beings 2/3 of the time. 

We're told that Roddenberry's space Communism from TNG onwards makes the Federation a perfect utopia but it's never demonstrated how it works until DS9 showed us quotas of energy credits.  Replicators should fuck with domestic and international economics in really interesting ways, and we'd have potential for good plots and moral quandaries if the Federation had to struggle to import fuel for these extremely power-intensive devices. The pre-replicator Federation *did* have that problem in TOS, it was the driving factor behind the cold war with the Klingons, but it just gets magically handwaved for the sake of Roddenberry utopia after that. Because the perfect utopia Federation would *never* engage in a resource war.

The mechanics of how Trek's warp drives work don't really matter because they're not portrayed consistently enough in terms of their capabilities and shortcomings. And if the writers knew enough about real physics and military tactics the intersection of those with Trek technology would make for much more interesting battles than the TNG standard of ""two giant ships move slowly and shoot each other with phasers until technobabble gives one the upper hand."" Warp drives literally tearing apart the fabric of spacetime could have had interesting ramifications, but it was lazily handwaved away by speed limits after one episode because the writers didn't want to deal with it. 

...and I adore TOS but it's pure fantasy that was even further detached from science in the 60s than TNG was from science in the 80s.

Anyway my main point is that in Trek the technology can do whatever Roddenberry or the writers want (yeah there's no money, whatever), and it's less concerned about the ramifications of those technologies than real SF.  And in light of that, I don't think Star Trek belongs on a high horse of being ""more scientific"" than Star Wars.",2016-10-18 12:51:12+00:00,d8x4ehj,6.0,t1_d8x33u3,2589.0,startrek

If you don't want to get a license, don't do stupid shit with it, and even if you are licensed you're better off sticking to FRS frequencies for airsoft because you're expected to use your FCC-assigned callsign on GMRS.  Stupid shit in this instance can be defined as transmitting on *any* non-FRS frequency or high power settings.  The UV-5R can transmit on any frequency between 400-520MHz; a *lot* of that outside of the FRS and GMRS bands is government-exclusive or commercially licensed and transmitting on them *will* get you buttfucked.

Most cheap walkie-talkies these days are hybrid FRS/GMRS, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea to just go out and use GMRS channels.  Hobbyists triangulate and report pirate transmissions for fun (foxhunting) and the FCC has its own spectrum analysis tools for hunting unlicensed users.

For reference, [here are FRS frequencies](http://www.buytwowayradios.com/blog/2006/07/frs_and_gmrs_frequencies.aspx) and [here's a guide on getting a Technician License](http://www.arrl.org/what-to-bring-to-an-exam-session).  In the past the FCC has proposed making GMRS unlicensed with a power limit reduced from its current one, but unless that ever actually happens you should play it safe with a license and FRS.",2016-07-29 23:57:05+00:00,d5wlcef,2.0,t1_d5wjhqq,3037.0,airsoft

Survivability in the context of aviation means not getting hit in the first place.

535,"Her statements about the [Emory Wheel piece](http://emorywheel.com/emory-students-express-discontent-with-administrative-response-to-trump-chalkings/) are also extremely dishonest semantics; from Snopes, all she really has to say about it is:

&gt;The term ""counseling"" only appeared in the item's comments section, and ""safe spaces"" was included as a paraphrase (meaning the purportedly oversensitive students invoking the concept hadn't actually used the words)

And she also quotes a PR-friendly soundbyte from the protest's organizer:

&gt;Firstly, we are not asking that these students censor their politics, nor are we asking that administration chooses to intervene in student politics. Rather, what we are asking for is equality and equity -- we want a streamlined, consistent method of communication to deal with instances of unrest on Emory's campus. This means race, color and economic status should not determine whether or not the University needs to be prompted to send out a response of acknowledgement of events. Secondly, we ask the Emory University Student Body and individuals nationally to fight for our right of freedom of speech the way they have for Trump supporters.

But from the actual article, there's plenty of hurt feelings and calls for outright bans on Trump supporters with tolerance for them conflated as approval of their views (bold emphasis mine, paraphrase brackets from the article):

&gt;“**I’m supposed to feel comfortable and safe** [here],” one student said. “But this man is being supported by students on our campus and our administration shows that they, by their silence, support it as well … I don’t deserve to feel afraid at my school,” she added.

&gt;“How can you not [disavow Trump] when Trump’s platform and his values undermine Emory’s values that I believe are diversity and inclusivity when they are obviously not [something that Trump supports]” one student said tearfully. **“Banning Muslims?

550,"It would take forever to catalog everything, but I'll pick out a few highlights suggesting that the author's worldview is modern intersectional Marxism:

&gt;When combined with the Christmas imagery that comes with the games’ “Black Friday” timescale—wrapped trees lined up on the streets, fairy lights twinkling above burnt out cars—it starts to feel like a visual interrogation of late Capitalism.

Late Capitalism is used by Marxists to describe post-WW2 Western economies in a way that still leaves room for Marxism's more eschatological elements (inevitable global class consciousness and revolution).

&gt;But when the game says New York, it isn’t referring to the citizens or the culture, instead it is referring to that most important of features in a capitalist society—property.

Common theme among racially-conscious intersectional Marxists, look at how often BLM talks about the law prioritizing ""white property over black lives.""

...I'm not sure how well this criticism works anyway, considering that Rikers gleefully kill cops, cleaners immolate people who they think might be infected, and the rioters are frequently seen beating the shit out of people they're mugging or holding them at gunpoint.  When someone threatens you with force in order to steal your property, that makes them a threat to your personal safety.

&gt;The “Rikers” are the prisoners of Rikers island prison that lies off the coast of The Bronx. They are the most obvious member of what The Division presents as societies’ dangerous underclass—known criminals. ... A gang of blue-collar garbage men and janitors equipped with flamethrowers, they represent the lowest rung of the working class. The third gang are the “Rioters,” a majority black, generic street gang, decked in hoodies and caps that spend their time looting electronics stores and dead bodies. ... Together, these gangs present a trinity of soft political targets, those that can be killed with little social guilt or questioning. The Division mercilessly uses these skewed representations to justify its political violence.

Marx himself harbored contempt for the lumpenproletariat (the criminals and hopelessly poor vs the working class) because he thought they were too concerned with their own survival to achieve class consciousness,  However, intersectional Marxists place greater emphasis on normativity vs othered classes than the bourgeois vs proletariat, and see underclasses as potential allies should they recognize their victimhood.

Also, I may be harping on this article's convenient omissions a bit too much, but the only possible reasons that he didn't list the LMB are that he didn't play the game long enough to encounter them or that they don't fit into his narrative.

I majored in the sociology of technology, I understand that most of these ideas are perfectly well-respected in humanities and social science departments, but in American society at large they are extremely heterodoxical.  It's difficult enough to have a serious discussion about the racial undertones to what society deems to be criminal behavior, something like this article that blames it all on fringe notions of kyriarchical oppression while also pretending to be a game review for public consumption is doomed to fail.",2016-03-21 14:48:15+00:00,d17vg3m,3.0,t1_d17ns8t,21254.0,truegaming

793,"A small discount isn't worth making a scene declining since people will usually insist anyway.  Leave the difference or a significant portion of it as a tip and you're good.  You really shouldn't take anything totally free or a discount under 50%; either leave a huge tip that makes up most or all of the price or decline it.  You may subconsciously expect a discount at some places after awhile, but if you ask for a discount or show disappointment that you didn't get one, you're an asshole.

Don't exclusively go to the places that give big discounts either; it's not necessarily given because they like us, but sometimes (often) because they want a uniformed police presence in their business to deter crime.  If you only go to a few restaurants because they give discounts you'll be neglecting the other places in town.

If it's not coming from businesses outside of your jurisdiction (stuff like Oakley SI) I don't think it's as big of a deal since you won't have to objectively police them on the job, but keep in mind that they have motives too (maintaining Oakley's high speed dynamic operator image by giving them away cheap to LE/mil).",2015-08-05 13:45:36+00:00,ctsa72d,1.0,t3_3ftlz7,43774.0,ProtectAndServe
