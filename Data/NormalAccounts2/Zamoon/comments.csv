87,"*I was only 9 years old*

I loved Tio very much, I had all the merchandise and manga

I pray to Tio every night before bed, thanking her for the life I ahve been given

""Tio is love"" I said. ""Tio is life""

Miss Smith hears me and calls me a faggot

I knew she was just jealous of my devotion to Tio

I called her a cunt

She slaps me and sends me to go to sleep

I'm crying now, and my face hurts

I lay in bed and it's very cold

A warmth is moving towards me

It's Tio, I feel so happy

She whispers to my ear: ""this is my shop""

She grabs me with her powerful ogre hands and put me on my hands and knees

I'm ready


You know what? I am not going to continue the story. You all know what happens next. I'm out.

89,"~~Imagine zombina being a cop/detective or something but gets ambushed by a psychopath mad scientist in the hallway of an abandoned building. The psychopath hacks human zombina to little bits by rapidly mashing her with an axe. The mad scientist then sews the body-parts together, and adds a few artificial things such as robotic hearts and the blood fluid which prevents decomposition. He then uses computers to edit zombina's brain so she will lack certain emotions, and also to change her personality. He then replaces one of the eyes with another random eye from another victim because the scientist accidentally destroyed one of zombina's eyes with the axe. When zombina wakes up, she kills the scientist because the scientist made a few accidents in modifying zombina's brain. Zombina becomes terrified of her new body, and decides to enter human civilisation, pretending she is an extraspecies.~~

91,"Wasp spiders are called ""wasp spiders"" because of the black and yellow stripe pattern on their abdomen, similar to those of wasps (that is at least what I think). However, her purple hair and clothing does not match the patterns of a wasp spider at all.

However, if you look closely at her legs most of them in the picture are black. However, if you look at the legs closely enough you can see some yellow, which can suggest that she does posses the abdomen of a wasp spider.

What really confuses me is the placement of her legs, as they look like they are sort of sticking out of her back or something, or she could just possess very long legs. I mean, wasp spiders do have fairly long legs, I guess.",2015-10-26 11:55:15+00:00,cwd99pq,2.0,t1_cwd8jfs,2535.0,MonsterMusume

A few years later I saw random ""click bait"" posts on Facebook about the Anime getting announced or something like that. I was instantly reminded about MM, and I forgot about that too.

Tio- Definitely ANM48, or anything similar to that. Pop music.

Zombina- She probably goes raving to rock/heavy metal. Most of her metal would probably be death metal. It's just a guess based off her personality. 

Manako- This one is a bit tricky. ~~Probably sits on her bed eating ice cream while listening to sad instrumental music~~ It is possible that she barely listens to anything, being introverted and all. She might force herself to listen to whatever everyone else listens to just to fit in.

Doppel- No-one knows much about Doppel. No one questions Doppel. No one even knows what she looks like. She probably listens to things ~~that normal people cannot hear very well, I don't know, a dog whistle or something.~~ similar to what Zombina listens to.
