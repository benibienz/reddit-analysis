I tried giving them other formations but the game keeps telling me that the archers are unable to use that formation as they aren't infantry or cavalry.

Is there any way to fix this problem? Does the same happen to you? Is there a formation that can be used by archers effectively that I haven't tried yet?

*To: King Graveth*

*Subject: I need your help man*

*From: King Harlaus*

*Can you do me a favour? Declare war on us and take Dhirim. This way when we take back the city I am able to keep it for myself. If you help me I will give you 50k denars along with enough troops to help you take Jelkala and Grunwalder Castle from the Sarranids.*

*To: King Harlaus*

*Subject: RE: I need your help man*

*From: King Graveth*

*Bruh. Are you insane? If we attack Dhirim then your lords will kill us all! Is this some sort of trap?*

EMAIL 3:

*To: King Graveth*

*Subject: RE: RE: I need your help man*

*From: King Harlaus*

*I will host a feast in Praven so all my dumbass lords will get distracted. Come on, do you have any idea how much butter is stored in that city and how much I need it?*

EMAIL 4:

*To: King Harlaus*

*Subject: RE: RE: RE: I need your help man*

*From: King Graveth*

*Fine, but you promise to give me the money and the troops, right? You better hurry up and get that feast running, it is almost harvesting season.*


The day after these emails were sent Harlaus hosted a feast and the Rhodoks declared war on Swadia. Dhirim was immediately attacked.

Like, these mercenaries are wayyy too fucking powerful. If you join a faction as a mercenary and raid a few caravans you will have enough money to hire loads of level 4-6 troops. Because of the time it takes to level up normal troops in Floris I just end up buying loads of high level mercenaries.

And these mercenaries are really fucking good. Like, the infantry (which for some reason could be hired in groups of 16) are basically a horde of greatsword-wielding heavily armoured death machines. With only like 3-5k denars I can hire a group of heavy cavalry. 

Every time I need to stock up on troops instead of going from village to village I just go from tavern to tavern instead, and I end up with a shitton of doppelsoldners, landsknechts, kenaus and komtur ritters.

Also for some reason, I never get many archers in my army.

Because of this, I started to imagine a group of different interspecies working together for survival.

For an example, lets take four interspecies. The Monoeye, the Harpy, the Ogre and the Cyclops (Monoeye subspecies). Here are what I think are the survival advantages/disadvantages of each interspecies: 
Monoeye- They have a very long ranged eyesight, and this could possibly mean that Monoeyes back then were be good hunters. Their long eyesight also means that they are able to spot predators from a long distance.
Harpy- Surprisingly good caretakers. Are able to fly long distances, which could make good ""scouts"" or whatever. However, they lack intelligence.
Ogre- Very large, strong but also easygoing. This would make them good at farming due to their strength (and can also pick fruits from very tall trees). They wouldn't make good hunters as they may easily scare away their prey.
Cyclops- Good blacksmiths/craftsmen(or woman :P). No depth perception, like normal monoeyes.

In a community like this, the ogres and the cyclops would be staying in the village/living areas. Both species together would be able to build very well if they work together. The cyclops are able to make farming tools for the ogres and bows/arrows from the monoeyes (who are hunters). The monoeyes would be good at hunting thanks to their long eyesight, and along with the ogres, help provide food for the community. Harpies would be able to look after the young of all the other species and their own. As harpies could mate with humans, they should be able to mate with other interspecies males as well (which is a bit creepy). The harpies will choose to stay with the community, as there is a higher chance of survival.

Now lets say that hunting began to fade away, and everyone began herding animals instead. The monoeyes and he harpies would make good herders. The harpies are good caretakers, and can look after the animals as shown in the chapter where Papi looked after the chicks (the monoeyes can remind them of things if they forget, such as feeding the animals). The monoeyes can spot predators or any other threats to the herd from a long distance, and would be able to also spot lost animals from the herd. Harpies could use their flying abilities to recover the lost animals if they are small enough. If monoeyes ever get lost due to the lack of depth perception, harpies can help the monoeyes. As they can fly, they will have a good image of where the lost monoeyes will need to go.
