9,"*Rummaging noises*

""Hmm..."" I hum while I thrust my arm beneath the surface of the 'irregular item bin'. Various body parts, all of a wide variety of weirdness, made various scrapping and smooshing noises. Some might say that touching disembodied parts of technically unborn babies is a horror, and shouldn't be allowed. But they obviously haven't been sterilized in a crappy workplace. Some pointy teeth here, a metallic organ there, all parts that I would have to get out and inspect in order to make a baby that has at least some form of symmetry. Now, this process could be much easier if I was using one of those kiosks from the Bulid-A-Babie workshops, but I like being able to make stuff with my own hands, to be able to shape it the way I see fit; or you know, because I don't have a thousand just lying around under my sofa waiting to be spent. My hands keep touching at the parts, the palms feeling for the 'usable' pieces. The motions bring me back to the days when I was just a factory worker. My prosthetic leg shudders with a light pain at my memory, so I force myself to go blank, like always. Only, I can't shake the feeling of dread at the back of my heart and the nausea of despair at the forefront of my mind. My life had sucked since day one of my existence, and all because I was born to a poor family. It may not have been as such for people like my grandparents, who often tell me how you could become whatever you wanted to be with enough hard effort. That was then, but when you can buy the child of your dreams, someone who would live out a destiny you make for them, why wouldn't you? Well, you wouldn't, because the end result would make all those dream jobs a very saturated market, and you would be ruining the life of your own child. They would be put on a path that they can not take, and unlike regularly born people, you can't really shake pre-determined programming with a shrug of the pants. Babies like me, we have no choice. I sort of slouch, a pressure against my neck. I look back to the parts I picked out, and I know what to do. ""I maybe a failure as an adult"" I whisper to my self as I grab the skull and spine. ""I maybe a failure as a spouse"" I say to myself louder, piecing together the limbs. ""And I maybe a failure of a child"" I tell myself while I meticulously place the scales, bit by bit. ""But you..."" I say to the baby, almost complete. ""Will live a path you forge for yourself."" This baby would look strange to many, and fascinating to some. I haven't heard too much about dragons, but I know that they let no one else tell them what they are to be. This child of mine will be as great or meek as they desire, and nobody else will be the same as them. I ponder if that is a good thing or a bad thing as I bring it to the animation table. I stroke at it's pointy scales and think of all the other 'better' choices I could have made, both in life, and in the creation of this baby. But as my scarred hand reaches toward the switch, my uncertainty falls away from me. Eat your heart out Babies-R-Us.
