&gt;Party consists of Human Wizard (Me), Minotaur Pally, Fey Construct Thingy Warlord, Incubus Fighter, Dragonborn Wizard, and a Darkborn (Think of Endermen) Fighter

&gt;We are currently in a haunted house

&gt;3Spoopy5Me

&gt;All the PC's wander off and get lost, each experiencing the spoops

&gt;Everyone, and a shifter ally we found while wondering the house, get back together in the living room

&gt;Wall begins to bleed a bright red blood

&gt;I make a throwaway line OOC about licking the blood

&gt;Player who is using the Fey Construct Thingy decides this is a great idea and goes for it (Despite not having a tongue)

&gt;DM has to describe taste of blood.

&gt;DM irritation +5

&gt;Go around the house, then we get confronted by some Gargoyles

&gt;[Goyals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0_aCEhyjNk)

&gt;Before they animate and fight us, Fey Construct Thingy decided to pick it's nose.

&gt;[TFW You have to describe picking a nose](http://imgur.com/gallery/ry2YXI5)

&gt;DM Irritation +25

&gt;Jump down a hole into the sewers after fighting ghost lady boss

&gt;Meet some Non-Human Racists

&gt;Whoop Non-Human Racists 

&gt;Along the way, Fey Construct Thingy decides to mess with ancient sewer stuffs

&gt;DM Irritation +66

&gt;Being the nice guy that he is, the DM decided he wouldn't do anything that would actually harm anyone, but boy did he create **something**

&gt;Out of nowhere, the ghost of an elf comes out of nowhere and bitch slaps the Fey Construct Thingy, doing no damage

&gt;Fey Construct Thingy decides to try and kill a ghost, as you do.

&gt;Instead smoothly caresses the ghostly hair of the elf.

&gt;No roll, no matter how large or natural, will get you a hit on this guy

&gt;Fey Construct Thingy disappointed, but is back on track


&gt;Now, this was surely intended to be a one time thing, I know that. But if something really catches my fancy, I make it a running joke.

&gt;This elf is one of those things


&gt;Later on in the campaign, one month in real time, we are seeking information on what to do next. Others are consulting with their contacts, and you know what I said when the DM asked what I was going to do?

&gt;""I am going to try and summon the ghost elf to help us figure out what to do next.""

&gt;It took a second for everyone at the table to get what I was saying, but it made for a nice chuckle once they did.

&gt;I roll to summon, and get a 17 + Modifiers

&gt;A WILD GHOST ELF HAS APPEARED!

&gt;Ghost elf happily gives directions, then goes back to the land of used plot devices. 


&gt;When we get to a undead (Sentient, mind you) village in the middle of a swamp, we go around looking for stuff to do. Shadow Assassin (Played by the same player of the Fey Construct Thingy) get into shenanigans 

&gt;Roll to attempt to summon the ghost elf once again to stop him from doing something stupid

&gt;Ghost Elf ╰( ⁰ ਊ ⁰ )━☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ Shadow Assassin

&gt;[How It Felt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoMYwZT19Do)

&gt;Passing gamer (We hold sessions at a game shop) calls the elf 'Baymax', and it stuck


&gt;I am currently taking it upon myself to raise Baymax to god status. I already have it so that his slaps deal Necrotic, Poison, and Force damage so far.

&gt;There were many more instances were I invoked Baymax out of the joke graveyard, but these were just the more interesting encounters involving him.

The characters you need to know about:
Oddball: An enderman (Custom Race) character that our DM usually plays. He is a fighter, and usually is the comic relief in the campaign. Carries a giant cleaver

Dusty: Grizzly knoll archer npc we bring along.

Jarvin: Apparently a dragon hunter, though all he does is shout his own name like a pokemon.

Rinehart: Half-Incubus that is played by the same friend who played Sarah

Sarah: Kitsune wizard that is focused on pyromancy.

William Slate (Me): Wisecracking human wizard.

Jericho: Minotaur Paladin who is usually the leader.

Shadow Assassin: He has a name, just can't recall it now. Is the 'troublemaker' character type.

Ravinheart: Like a Khajit. Is a ranger.

Now, before we begin, you'll be needing some backstory. We were starting an intricate quest called the 'Chronoscope' which would allow us the players to temporarily DM our characters back backstories and get some good loot In the process. We would have special effects whenever we started one, such as encounter skills being at will, and others as the deputy DMs felt were needed. We finished Jericho and Raven heart's origin story, and then we got to Sarah's. It was fairly neat, had some puzzles, some traps, and even some zombies. Now, when we get to the final area, we are to fight a shadow dragon. It was an epic battle, the likes of which would be told for ages. We were in over our heads and we would surely- Oh wait, the dragon is dead. It took the amount of time to read those two sentences for our in-game characters to brutally crush the dragon. In only two full turns, we managed to:

*Sneak attack it twice
*Cast six spells
*Shoot about seventeen arrows
*Call it's mother an elf 
*Slice at it a good few times

It feel dead not soon after, and the person who had taken the DM mantel was left with an intense grimace at seeing the boss he made fall so quickly. Next session we had and he was back with a vengeance. He had his other character go next, and this time we didn't have any special effects to help us. Another bout of puzzles, some demons, and a big hole later, we come to the end boss of his second character. His past self is busy arguing with a lich, so Oddball gets curious and starts putting his hand through the memories faces. The deputy DM then initiated the boss fight and made the lich and his pet drago-lich able to be touched. He hadn't noticed that Oddball had his hand between the lich's neck before he made them solid, so with a sufficient strength check, Oddball breaks his hand out of the sudden neck and effectively decapitated the lich. With an entire part of the boss fight gone, our temporary DM scrambles his drago-lich. Sadly (but not really for us), we also kill this dragon in two turns. Without help from the lich, the drago-lich was put through:

*Two 600 lb. Cleaver slices to the neck
*A stealth attack to the neck
*A spectral ram spell to the neck, knocking it prone
*A fireball
*A coup de gra on the neck.

We broke it's neck, and when all you are made of is bones, that is bad. It died like a chump, and made the temporary DM's grimace intensify even more. 

From all of this, I learned that not only should I not underestimate the players, but that I should have a counter for everything they might throw if I wanted to give them a real worthy boss fight. And that is how I created 'The Dark Drake'.
