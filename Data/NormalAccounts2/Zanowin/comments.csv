955,"&gt;Never hand the police anything voluntarily that could be used to incriminate you. If you have hours of dashcam footage, how do you know for certain you didn't break the law?  


This is basically /r/Dashcam credo. They all say that SD cards are tiny and could get ""lost"" by the officer. IANAL but their suggestion is (with accidents, but I think it will hold here), don't tell anyone you have a dashcam, after you get home, pull your dashcan footage and extract the parts relevant to the crash (or in your case, driving in the neighborhood), see if they can help or hurt your case, if they can help your case, only show the footage to your lawyer or at trial.  

There are more things people do, but I don't think they belong here.
