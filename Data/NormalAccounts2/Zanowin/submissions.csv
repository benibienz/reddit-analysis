Dick is the high commander and a bumbling fool. The Big Giant Head sent his most inept team to Earth to check out how stupid we are and now ignorant we would be to aliens and an Earth take over.  



After receiving enough updates, the Big Giant Head sends his most capable team led by Dr. Liam Neesam (John Cleese) to plan the Earth take over.  


We are led to believe that Dr. Liam Neesam is going rogue and wanting to turn the world into a Monkey theme park on his on. But if you remember, he just won an award. So The Big Giant Head should know what he's doing and likes what he sees.   


Dick finds out about Monkey world and stops Dr. Liam Neesam by using the Monkey wand on him. So everything is good, right? Dr. Liam Neesam is a monkey and no longer a dange, right?  Wrong! we find out at the end of the series that the Solomons are being called back to the home planet. What is the reason? Turning Dr. Liam Neesam into a monkey.  

So even though Dr. Liam Neesam is a monkey, it's not permanent. More than likely, after he goes back home he reverts back to his natural state.   


As soon as the Solomons are back on their home planet, Dr. Liam Neesam will come back to work and proceed with turning all humans into monkeys.

I was researching this for my own purposes, and noticed that the [JCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC_virus) virus named after John Cunningham had a striking similarity to our own virus ridden Jon Connington.  

It seems that JCV is in a lot of people and it won't affect them, unless they have a weakened immune system. JCV can result in PML or [Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy). 

&gt;PML Symptoms can develop over several weeks to months. Symptoms depend on location of damage in the brain and the degree of damage. The most prominent symptoms are ""clumsiness, progressive weakness and visual, speech, and sometimes personality changes""[1] The lesions affecting the parietal and occipital lobes can lead to a phenomenon known as [alien hand syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_hand_syndrome)

At least that's what I thought when I came across it. I'll let the experts come up with tinfoil :p
