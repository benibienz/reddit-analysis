40,"You have several choices when getting a ship-

* [Standalone ship](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/Standalone-Ships/Cutlass-Black)- Just a ship, nothing else.  You also need a ""game package"" to actually have a copy of the game and play.

* Ship/Game package- A copy of the game and a ship.  This is [the Cutlass Black game package](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/Packages/Cutlass-Black)

Or you can CCU (cross-chassis upgrade) a ship you already have, using that ship's value to upgrade.

&gt; What's the main differences between the Cutlass and the Titan?

The Titan is more of a *fighter* straight up guns and pilot up front, a very small cargo bay in the back, and a bed/escape pod in between.

The Cutlass is more of a *ship*, if that makes any sense. You can have a co-pilot behind you, and a friend in the turret (or slave the turret to the pilot, or in the future have an NPC gun for you)

The Cutlass is pretty bare-bones right now, and not the best at combat. But the rework will fix that.

Ah, that's not really your fault.

I'm still kinda new here too, but as I understand it, flying with HOTAS is kind of at a disadvantage right now.  ESP assist is not working right or something. I can't hit a thing myself most of the time.

The other issue is that the Connie apparently got hit pretty hard with the nerf bat (speed and maneuverability) last go 'round.  

AND armor is not yet in the game- both ship and personal armor(that armor suit is just for show ATM).  Armor is especially important for the Connie, cause right now they only need to drop our shields and then they can start popping off our engines. 

I love the Connie, love the looks, love the role, and I can't wait for the Merlin to be unlocked.  It is a ship that will be at a disadvantage without NPCs or players at the turrets (and turrets are also in a bad stop ATM) and the snub fighter. 

But I hear it's Chris Roberts' favorite ship, so I do think it will end up in a better spot than it is in now.  ",2016-10-01 22:33:48+00:00,d8a32gm,,t1_d88low7,,StarCitizenTraining

Well, that's a tough thing- see if you want to rank up to Elite combat rank yourself, you have to kill NPCs with your combat ranking *or higher.* And if you make it to deadly rank, only to find that elite rank NPCs are super hard to find, you'll never make elite (especially since there's a diminishing return, to get from deadly to elite, you have to kill about as many ships as you did to get to deadly)

Just out of curiosity- what ship are you using for that?

I did some nav beacon hunting in a python, stayed till I was out of SCB and ammo, as I used to, killed a gunship and two smaller ships- $168k in credits for the bounty.  I'd used to make around 1mil in the time it took to run out. 

I was happy with the fight, even with only killing a few ships, but I would like it if they'd boost the bounties to match the challenge. 

With my 5mil rebuy, I'd have to do nearly 30 of those BH runs to make a rebuy, with a good chance I could lose my ship in one of those 30 runs.  (or by being interdicted by an NPC on the way back to the station when I'm out of everything.)

On my second play though I decided to build a nice settlement in Sanctuary. I cleared a build site and built a great multi-story building for the settlers. I made a lounge, kitchen, bar, beds- everything they could want!


I found the settlers would just hang out in the empty yellow house, few would even set foot in the fantastic home I'd made for them.

So a rang the bell, made sure it was empty, and completely walled off the yellow house.

Came back later, a few more settlers in the home I'd built, good. But several standing outside the walled off yellow house. 

And I could hear banging. Sturges had somehow teleported into the walls and was hammering on that fan he loves so much. 

So I gave up.  The settlers are drawn to that yellow house like moths to a light. Moved the furniture into it and tore down the thing I'd built.

Well there's your problem right there. 

Firstly, piracy isn't gonna be a money making venture.  I do it for the adrenaline rush, if I can scoop up some cargo it's a bonus.

Cobra is what you want, u/ReginaldButterwinkle 's Cobra is fine, though I'd suggest a class A thruster. More often or not people try to pull a runner.  Python is too slow, and honestly you'd never be able to fill its cargohold anyway.

The T9 and trader conda/python players are in solo. Most I see are T6s or Cobras.

I post in chat to stop and submit to cargo scan, if they do I don't kill them even if they have no cargo. But if they refuse or run I'm more than happy to blast them right out of space.",2015-09-21 02:13:46+00:00,cv8lmxb,1.0,t3_3lqlrk,8456.0,EliteDangerous
