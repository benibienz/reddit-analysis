And we also know that it will [look freakin' sweet.](https://youtu.be/pRMCI-d1rUc)

But CIG please release a hangar-ready version for us with the 2.6 update.

They're still working on getting it flight ready- maybe some thrusters to move or some more polish on the interior- but it ought to be mostly done.

I know the ship pipeline is fast enough to make the hangar-ready stage kinda redundant.  But doing it for the Cat would let the Youtubers make intro vids for it, drumming up interest for the ship when it eventually goes on sale for the anniversary and/or for 3.0.

A [Signet Roamer](http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Necromancer_-_Signet_Roamer)

and a [Chillormancer Roamer](http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Chillormancer_Roamer).

Is there a better build?  

What benefits are there to choosing one versus the other?
