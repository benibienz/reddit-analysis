My small group, being +/- 4 or so years were coming of age during 9/11 and then entering the workforce during the 2008 recession. Those two events left markers on our group that we are more cautious and take less risks and care more about lending a hand to those in need. We save more spend less. It's really interesting considering a stereotype for millennias  is selfish and materialistic. This same subset also remembers life before technology, but is very adept at using it.

21,"Southern Christian lady here.   I told our minister that the words submit and obey weren't allowed in our ceremony and be prepared to be interrupted if they were. Ha. 

Sounds like the minister hails from a very backward idea of a man's and woman's role in marriage.  I could dive into this topic pretty hard with scripture to back me up, but that's not what you posted about. I've heard of some men playing nice until the nuptials are said. I'd keep in touch with your friend. Plan a girl night when she gets back. You be really flexible with your availability. If she makes excuses that's a red flag.   Go visit her at their house for dinner.  Does he help with cooking and/or cleanup? Does he expect her to wait on him hand and foot? Those are all red flags. 

Many others pointed out the minister could just be a total tool. This happens. You should see these types of folks when I bring up equality in marriage. Quite funny. I'm an excellent debater and usually have them stumbling over their words.

37,"I read a few of the top comments. You are getting some really sound advice. Hopefully I'm not repeating anything, but here's my take. 

Babies are a LOT of work. Think about how much work it's taking care of your husband. Multiply that work load by 10.  Do you get breaks? Can you take a shower uninterrupted? Can you eat a whole meal peacefully? Can you read a chapter book sipping on a cup of coffee in peace?  The answer to those questions is ""no"" with a baby on board, unless you have a fully healthy adult's assistance.  I have two kids under 4. My husbands works two weeks out of town and two weeks home.  The first year of each babies life those two weeks going solo are rough.  Not only will you have a baby, I'm imagine your husband to be about as time consuming as a toddler. You are going to spent. 

Do NOT take on the responsibility of an elderly person.  I like the top comments suggestion of finding an assisted living center.  And your idea about funding visits three times a year. Both great compromises. 

Bonus: Here's some unsolicited advice. It seems you guys make enough to hire a nanny for the baby. I did daycare at first then switched to a nanny. A good nanny is worth her weight in gold. Also do you have a cleaning service that comes regularly? If not I'd recommend signing up for that too.  A nanny and a housekeeper made my life as a working mother a lot easier.

61,"Dad is that you come through a time machine? Seriously though, this while situation is very almost too much like my childhood.  Im one of seven kids. Mom was a hand washing germ-a-phob but I would not have let a baby crawl on our carpet even after a vacuum. I'm now in my 30s. Hindsight is 20/20 so here are the things I believe could have made a difference to the filth. 

1) Your wife is probably overwhelmed. 5 kids is a lot. (I have 2, they are a lot).  She might be the SAHM, but you are still both responsible for household chores. For example, you are there in the evening eating dinner so you should help with those dishes. Saying she's responsible for all the chores as well as the kids is giving her a 24/7 task with no break. That'll drive anyone bonkers. 

2) If you expect kids to do things, they need to be aware of the expectation.  Start small. I do ten minutes of pick up time before bedtime. It's a small amount of time, but makes a huge difference. From there gradually add chores.  And for goodness sakes be consistent. 

3) Getting things back in order will not happen overnight. Focus on one room at a time. ORGANIZE the room. Every thing in there needs to have a designated spot. Each room should also have a ""carb box"" to quickly put things that do not belong in that room. These get put away during 10 minute clean up time. 

4) If you want to bring organization and cleanliness someone has to drive it.  You need to decide if you can be that person or if you can accept living in the filth. ",2016-01-23 05:12:25+00:00,cz8o34y,1.0,t3_4270dh,36513.0,relationships

My advice is that you live for 3 months on what you would with just one income. Until you can do that without dipping into savings I'd  highly recommend her staying at her job.  If she really really wants it she'll stay focused for the 3 months and learn to adjust to the lifestyle. And you too. ",2016-01-19 02:56:24+00:00,cz3i3cn,1.0,t3_41j4rb,45091.0,relationships

102,"I think you've got a really complicated thing going on here. 

She was definitely wrong for not letting you know she was going off birth control. That said you told her the chances of you getting her pregnant were really slim, I believe you said close to zero. Taking birth control every sucks (I'm a female).  It can mess with your mood, sex drive as well as weight. She may have reasoned that you were basically infertile anyway so why keep taking it.  She still should have discussed this with you. 

Furthermore, not cumming inside makes it very unlikely to get pregnant. For reasons stated above I got off birth control (of course my husband knew) and our birth control method was ""pull and pray"".  In five years we only got pregnant when we wanted. And both times on the first attempt so both of us are very fertile. What I am getting at is this baby might not be yours. Even if you really think there is no way she cheated, she still may have.  

Basically, you have one of two situations. She thought there was zero chance of getting pregnant and thought the birth control was unnecessary, which given your fertility plus pulling out makes sense. Or she cheated on you. 

Now I'm going to address the abortion issue. IF the baby is indeed yours and you really love her you need to understand her view. I'm not saying agree. I'm saying understand. Most pro-life people see the fetus as the early stages of a human life. Take a moment to read a few stories about women who have had a miscarriage. They don't feel like they lost a few cells, they feel they lost their baby and a part of them. Even though you don't agree, it won't change the way she feels. There is a good chance what you are asking feels like murder to her. A mother's job is to protect her baby. If she already believes what she has is a baby, an abortion will likely send her into a spiral of depression and you loose the girl you fell in love with in spirit. My mom was pressured into having an abortion before my dad came along. She still FORTY years later thinks about that baby. An abortion won't fix the problem. That baby dead or alive will always be part of your life if you want her in it. If you want your child free life, you may have to cut ties and leave. Which being she didn't tell you about getting off birth control, I think you'd be justified.

If you are in the US, You can open a 529 account and put money in tax free and when nephew uses it for legit college expenses it's still tax free. I have one for each of my sons. The accounts are in my name with each of them names the beneficiary of their respective fund. You can put just a little to start or have an auto-draft as little as $10 a month. The site lets you send info to others so they can contribute as well.  If she complains about this, so what. Nephew gets the money when he's over 18. 

As for SIL. I am thinking Something deeper is going on. I suggest taking her for some girl time. Having a baby is a huge life adjustment. Let her know that you are sorry if there is any miscommunication, but you love your nephew and are excited to be part of his life. When you go over to invite her out, bring food.  Tell her you want to be there for her and your nephew. Offer to babysit so B and SIL can go on a date.

I do think there is a compromise to be made here. 

Why not switch to a degree program that will help your career as a tradesman?  Perhaps business management? Or small business?  Most trade schools are only a couple of years. You could finish you degree at Uni then go to the trade school of your choice. A degree relevant to management will significantly help your career.

142,"Going off of the sticker chart. I made my three year old a Good Behavior Rule board and had a treasure box system. I listed the rules and used 5 alligators(clothe pins colored green) and 5 stars(foam cutout held on by blue colored clothe pins). The alligators moved down the side to a new box every time a rule was broken. If the alligator made it to the bottom a star got eaten. At the end of the week however many stars he has left he got one treasure box prize for each star. My system gives him 35 times to be bad before he gets no prize. The idea was to make sure he at least got one prize so he learns the value of keeping his stars. All the prizes are cheap toys/trinkets. We saw a huge improvement in behavior with this system. 

The other thing is that I implemented the 90/10 rule. 90% of the attention he gets from me is positive. 10% negative. When he does something right/nice I thank home make a big deal of it. I'll tell him that makes me happy. When he bad I tell him the behavior makes me sad or mad. He doesn't like me to be mad so sometimes just saying that stops him in his tracks.

146,"Mom of 3 year old here. And I just moved in with my BIL while our house gets built. I'm going to give my two cents on the three old acting up then follow with some things that worked for my 3 year old. 

This 3 year old has been through a lot of upheaval.  And from the sounds of things the previous living arrangement were also volatile. Claudia has been the only stable element in Veronica's little world.  I can see why when mom leaves the room she freaks out. When we moved my three old took it hard, and we didn't leave bad situation. The other thing is almost all toddlers go through these phases. They cry, they wine, and throw fits. The parent has to whether them.  How they whether them does make a difference and produce positive results if handle correctly. 

What helped my toddler adjust was consistency and clearly defined rules. I made a rule chart. I also wanted to make the experience positive. So I had a treasure box with a system that rewarded when rules were not broken. (If your interested in the details of the system, I'll be happy to share.). We read the rules every day. I stay positive about it. And tell him how happy it makes mama when he follows the rules. Since implementing the rule chart we saw vast improvement.  No whining is one of the rules. ;-). I still also do time outs. Huge fan of the time out room mentioned in one of the other comments. 

I also put into play a strict bedtime routine. He can tell you now exactly what to expect in the evenings. It took bedtime from chaos to hum-de-hum. I have a one year old also. The routine has been like magic. 

I will say no behavior change will happen overnight. So don't get your hopes up the magic will be quick. 

As for bringing it up with Claudia, that's going to be tough. My BIL has a couple of times inserted himself in where he only made things worse. (Toddler was crabby and BIL took a toy away). I'll add the house we are in is my husband's grandparents so we are equals in roommates. Your situation is a little different as you are the lease holder. I think I'd approach it in that you recognized this is a difficult transition time for Veronica and you'd like to try putting the rules up on a board and making following them fun for Veronica.  You want Claudia to make the rules as she is the mom and you will add your house rules. The treasure box stuff can be cheap, non messy (Do NOT get stickers) items. Kids just like the idea of earning and getting stuff.  As far as the routine that's harder to approach. 

Good luck! And think of how stressed out the crying makes you, Claudia, I promise, is that times 100. 

One more thing. Check my post history. I asked in r/parenting how to get my 3 year old to stop acting like his baby brother. The advice given was pretty solid. Only one person replied, but I implemented it and saw improvements too. ",2015-11-11 03:18:44+00:00,cww4nr5,1.0,t3_3sajr6,37073.0,relationships

Unlike you I did not have even one warm parent. I have never been in the receiving end of unconditional love. To be honest before my sons came along I didn't understand non-romantic touching (hugs, cuddles, ect). I will say there is something beyond just what I can see which my children. They were a part of me. I can can sense things about them no one can. Our souls truly were one at one time.  I do get where you are coming from. 

That said, I also believe that one day my sons will each meet a woman who will be their romantic soulmate. And just like my husband places his immediate family (me and the boys) before his parents, I expect this woman to ""outrank"" me. But she needs to be worthy of that position. I'm afraid anyone who would spit on you is not. 

In the future I would approach this or questions like it like' "" The strongest non-romantic bond I have with someone is my mother. The strongest romantic bond is with you. I can't wait for our bond to grow stronger and look forward to a wonderful future together.""

Some other things I thought about:

1) Start documenting everything she does. Write it down or type it up. Record conversations if you can legally do so in your state.  If she ever attempts to involve CPS you will have a well documented case of her crazy. 

2) Beware she may go to extremes, such a planting drugs reporting false abuse. Don't give her opportunities so do so. Can you lock your bedroom door so she can't go in there while you are gone? When you arrive home after her visit check the bathroom to make sure nothing was left there. When your son gets mobile (if he isn't already) he will fall, trip intentionally jump off the couch, ect.  He will get bruises and scraps.  Both my sons almost always have a bruise from just being an adventurous boy.  I could see if she saw bruises as a non-parent would decide to report you. She may even be messed up enough to convince herself she is ""saving"" your son.   I would advise you to cut contact completely. And never EVER let her be alone with son. 

3)  You have been VERY passive against her advances. If someone ever tried to take my baby while latched hell fire would rain down on them. Sister assumes what is yours is hers and has absolutely no respect or fear of you. Time to change that. Like I said earlier you are mom, it's Mama Bear time.

235,"Fuck. How did it come to this? My heavy sigh let me know I know exactly how I got here. Here in a bar about to convince my immortal enemy to sleep with me. The man responsible for my parents death. Sure he was just a teenager at the time, but I remember that day 1,369 years ago like it was yesterday. 

Michael was still mortal then. I was always immortal being born to immortal parents. There are very few ways to which immortals can die. One of which is the Leaching Spell. When cast the Leaching Spell transfers the immortality from the closet immortals to the spell casters. Immediately, the losers of endless life succumb to their actual age.  My parents were 1,456 and 456. They turned to dust right before my eyes. I was only 13.  Michael claimed when Madam Zeek told him he would become immortal he had no idea the cost. Bull shit.  

Michael was smart. Too smart.  We grew up in the Castle together. He was the son of the page and my parents allowed him to be tutored alongside me.  It didn't take him long to figure out my parents sourse of wealth was rooted in their immortality. Michael formed an alliance with Madam Zeek.  Together they found the rare stone required for the spell and stole my parents immorality. I vowed to give my parents vengeance.  

I am halfway to my goal. Madam Zeek was wiped off the face of the Earth in 1863. The second way a immortal can die is by stabbing the heart with a sapphire spike. That day haunts me as well. As surely as this day will too. 

The third and final way a immortal can die is despicable. There is a very rare blood disease that actually can kill us. We aren't carriers. The mortals are. And my brother slept with a carrier mortal.  What idiot doesn't screen first!? It's a simple test. The mortals don't even know we do it. Nevertheless, Daniel, my only brother, has been given the kiss of death. The only cure is a blood transfusions from a healthy immortal with shared DNA of the same blood type. The problem is my brother has a rare blood type. Only he and one other immortal have it.  In order to save my brother Michael and I need to have a child together. 

I look at him relaxed into his bar stool.  His hand is running up a blonde lady's through. He is definitely on the prowl. I glance at the mirror. Satisfied with my disguise I take a deep breath and head toward Michael. ",2015-10-13 03:26:11+00:00,cvxrnbe,1.0,t3_3ogssi,40368.0,WritingPrompts

256,"I was actually born in California and my mom was a classic beach girl; she grew up in San Clemente. I am very aware of those superficial girls you talk about.  But there are shallow girls everywhere, but also real girls too. 

Listen, my husband got turned down many many times before I came along. The excuses ranged from he was too nice to not looking for a boyfriend. He held out for that girl that would see him for him. Now those other girls are stuck raising children with crap dads and/or husbands that make pennies compared to mine. Note here that when I met my husband he was at the bottom of his career ladder and I was positioned to be the bread winner. He worked hard and earned his way to his current manager position. The point is hold out for the good girl. Don't settle for the superficial ones. But don't be afraid to ask out any girl that catches your eye. If she says no, move on. Not worth your time. I was told by many men that they were afraid to ask me because I looked like a snob. Thank God my husband didn't let that phase him. He says all the rejection he faced is worth it and he'd face it all again just to get to me. 

And when you take girls out on a date take them someone where fun and exciting. Girls crave excitement which is why many go for the bad boys, but dates like rock climbing, ice skating, museums with a scavenger hunt make you not boring. Don't do dinner and a movie.

This really hot young girl with this like 40 year old"" It was a small dive boat, we were the only Arkansans on board. 

So my husband isn't ugly, but I'd say his looks are probably average. This is going to sound conceded, but I'm a great catch. 8-10 in the looks, down to earth, reasonableness intelligence (ChemE), and positive about life despite a terrible childhood.  What made me fall for him and keeps me in love is his personality. I commend you for seeking a therapist. You need to get happy with yourself because women worth having are looking for more than surface looks.  You need to be happy to make someone else happy. Especially now that you are 28. My husband is now 34 and me 30. We no longer get the bald comments. You will grow into your baldness. In fact I am pretty sure him looking older has helped in his career. Looks fade. They always do.  I'm sure mine will one day too. 

My point is that you will find someone who will appreciate you for you and find you sexy as hell. But you have to get your personality sexy first. That is what last. See that therapist and get happy. ",2015-10-01 12:26:34+00:00,cvkeinc,1.0,t3_3mzp71,68184.0,relationships

Up until the then the mother could kill her child if she decided she could not afford another mouth to feed or whatever. Many older siblings  witnessed their mother disposing of the live infant/toddler. Think for a moment how you feel about that. Would you be okay with the killing of a healthy bouncing one year old, or does it shock and sadden you that the babies own mother would say never mind you are too much of a burden on me?

That is the same feeling many anti-abortion people feel about a fetus. They equate those that would abort to the mother who takes her one year olds life and those that stand by as those that walk on by as the one year old takes his last breath. They feel they are advocating for a human being. A person. A soul. 

Now you don't have to agree, like I said the abortion issue all depends on when you believe the fetus owns its own humanity. But that's the other side.

307,"Every time a I see an article on abortion issues, rather it be prolife or pro choice, I am amazed at the lack of compassion either side has. I do not think this is an issue that will ever be resolved. Abortions have been happening since before Ancient Rome. How someone feels comes down to when they believe the living organism inside the mother has its own humanity. This is a core value that is very hard to change. 

I don't understand why the prolife doesn't spend money on the things that provide more women the ability and funds to make the choice of carrying a baby to term. Like erasing the sigma of having a baby out of wedlock. Or providing more birth control options. Or paying for good childcare while in school, not current government ones that are shitholes. Or putting research towards womb transferring.  Or allowing mothers to receive donations for giving her baby up for adoptions (yes I realize some women will try to sell their baby through this).  Or encouraging a freakin' leaving wage. Many abortions happen because the mother cannot afford the child.  I realize there will still be some abortions, but I believe those would happen whether legal or not. Some women just do not want be pregnant.  But why not address the issues that lead women to decide abortion is the best option?  The choice is still with the women, but more babies are carried to term.

371,"You are actually correct for some groups. I worked in a community with an extremely high crime rate and also a high African American population. One of my co-workers was an older black gentleman. He worked a lot with the youth in the area and also talked frank about blacks and whites. Made me (white) feel comfortable (like I wasn't being racist) asking why the black on black crime in the area was so high. He said that they (the young black men) prove they are a man by either taking a bullet or shooting a bullet. 

He said he tries to catch them young to prevent that way of thinking but he can't catch them all. :-(",2015-06-19 03:59:56+00:00,csbiyqg,5.0,t1_csbczm2,11923.0,dataisbeautiful
