My background is I have a chemical engineering degree and worked in the industry for five years  as a process engineer and Environmental, Health, and Safety engineer. I am also really good at organizing huge events and am extremely creative. Currently, I am a stay at home mom and working on putting the business plan, financial analysis, and operating agreement together.  

Husband has the farming background. Generations of small farmers. He currently works a job that allows him to be off 2 weeks than work 2 weeks.  He's a site manager so he also brings in managing skills. He's currently preparing the land to plant the pumpkins. 

Back when I worked full time we lived close to several pumpkin patches, but now the closet one is 80 miles. I took my boys and was very surprised to see how many locals made the trip. Our area is wanting to grow the tourist sector as well. So it seems an attraction for both locals and visitors could have potential. Additionally, I really enjoy this kind of thing. 

My biggest unknown is how to get an estimate on customers and pumpkin sales.  I've thrown some reasonable estimates together, but don't feel good about it.

My MIL(let's call her Helga) called this morning to inform me that a couple that my husband and I know really well have separated. And that I needed to stay away from the woman because ""all she does is bitch to her husband"".  I don't know what irritates me more. Her telling me to a Adobe my friend during a trailing time or the fact she threw her under the bus. Helga is good friends with the husband's parents. So my MIL is getting her info from my friend's MIL. So it's pretty much double trouble MIL. 

Seeing that I understand what it means to be a true friend I was already aware of the situation and that the husband is an active alcoholic, partying and going to bars. Let me add they have a 3 year old and a 1 year old. I told Helga that my friend was justified to be angry, but that taking sides was not something someone who wants to support a marriage should do. And until my friend says she wants to throw in the towel, I am going to support her reconciling with her husband.  (No physical abuse or cheating involved). I have been able to offer my friend support in a way others can't. I grew up with an alcoholic father.  I grew up with a mom that never took a firm stand against the alcohol. I also understand the things that a spouse can do to help an alcoholic become an inactive alcoholic. And the things that a spouse can do to hurt. I am forever scarred because of my childhood. But maybe just maybe I can use that to help this couple and their two little boys. 

But NO I should just stay away.  God forbid I become a bitch to her son just by association.
