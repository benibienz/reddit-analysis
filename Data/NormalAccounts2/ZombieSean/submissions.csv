We are totally compatible and I think she is the perfect one for me. The only problem is she lives 5 hours away and I'm a senior in high school with no drivers license. She graduated last year and is working a part time job. When our relationship started last November she was a senior in high school. The only time we actually met each other was last February. After hard consideration I have decided it would be for the best if we broke up right now because of the distance. This hurts me very much but I feel it's the right choice in the end since it is extremely stressful keeping this kind of relationship and I go off to college next year which would make matters worse. Basically, I am just wondering what I should do now. I still love her with all my heart and I don't want to lose her.

Tl:dr I broke up from my long distance relationship but still want her really bad, what should I do?
