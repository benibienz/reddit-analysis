423,"So 3 days ago my wife had enough. All the time raiding, farming, and strikes for hours. She came to me and all she said was your addiction is getting on my nerves and im about to solve this problem. She then proceeds to give me a kiss, tell me she loves me and with a shit eating grin she leaves. My only thought was she is probably gonna turn off the internet. Then again I have a very sweet wife, and she wouldn't ever do something that low. So I sat pondering while fighting the war priest with some friends. After about 30 minutes I hear her car pull up. I patiently wait for her to come inside to see this scheme she has come up with. However after she came inside I get not a single word.  Then I see our second TV round the corner to my mancave, my brother holding one end and my wife at the other. At this point im dumbfounded and have no idea what the hell is going on. She sets the tv on another stand next to mine, then goes and grabs a bag she brought in. She walks in smiles and in the most dick way possible she pulls out the newest Destiny addition ps4, says and I quote ""SUCK IT!""She said ""since you wont spend more time with me, ill make you spend time with me!"" My wife is a avid COD player so she takes to FPS and MMOs pretty well. Im super excited, she currently has 2 hunters and soon to be working on another. So believe me I sure as hell appreciate her!!!
