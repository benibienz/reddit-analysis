I cant think of any reason this would be a bad idea accept to make sure I buy new bearings and seals and check for any serious rust before purchase. Also to make sure there is no water in the forks or in the tank. Any reasons why this would be a bad idea I figured this would be cheaper than buying new and I wouldnt have to worry about a monthy payment.

So at least the are both V-Twins, but I dont know all the differences. Anyways he called and told me his bike today while riding broke down, oil started coming from the exhaust and the bike died and now it wont crank. My first thoughts would be the piston ring or rings could be bad the, cylinder walls are severally scarred and/or an exhaust valve is not seated. Now im by no means a master mechanic, but I want to do anything I can to help my buddy he hasnt even had his bike a year and this happens to him. If there is anything else it could be? I will probably be able to tell you guy more when I get a chance to look at it but any and all help is appreciated.

Im for Tyler, Texas and I get the amazing experience of becoming a fireman! As you can tell im extremely excited, but I have a few questions about the academy and about the job in general.

1. What can I do to prepare for the academy? I know fitness helps, but im fairly fit and have good endurance and stamina, but what else can I work on?

2. In the academy I can rent gear or buy my own what would be the best choice?

3. In my smallish town I have asked around and it seems like this town doesnt higher very often. Do you have a long commute to your firehouse? And how far do you think is too far of a commute?

4. I plan to become a Fire Marshal when possible. How long before I can become one after being a fireman? I tried googling this and couldn't get a straight answer.

5. What is the worst and best part of your career?

6. If you could tell any one important thing to a new guy what would it be?

If there is anything else you think I should know add it along, the more I know the better! 

Im looking forward to reading any and all responses! Im sorry I have poor grammer!

However I have a dilemma. My wife has a minor case of Scoliosis, and she is always in pain after only a 30 min ride with me. I hate that she can't ride with me it absolutely kills me. My wife adores riding with me as well but just cant handle the pain. Well I have thought about it and im considering trading in my Sporty for a Street Bob. Simply because I think its more upright not only for me but for her. UNLESS there is an alternative. There are some things I should mention though. I have a 24 inch Burly Brands sissy bar and stock passenger seat on my bike. Would it help just getting a taller sissy bar and a more comfortable seat or would you guys think it wouldnt help her much. Im also looking at progressive shocks so that is something to consider as well. So would it be more justified to buy a more upright bike or is it possible to help accommodate her more on my bike? Not to be a broken record but remember to keep in mind she does have minor Scoliosis. Im hoping someone is maybe haveing a similar situation God willing no ones wife have Scoliosis, but on the off chance they do please share your experience with anything like this. Thank you for any and all help, and Happy New Year /r/Harley :)

I like to ride year round regardless of temp. However I dont have a garage and I dont know how to protect my bike other than a cover. I figure I wont need a trickle charger because ill be riding every day if not every other day. Is there anything I can to to help maintain my bike during winter while im riding? Different tires?
