2,Yeah they are quite similar and thats pretty much the same reason why i want to summon for other people :D it takes long to get a decent amount of scrolls if you dont buy them... but lets grow bigger together so maybe we get asked to summon : D,2016-11-16 00:05:44+00:00,da210ow,3,t1_da1cjvd,30251,summonerswar

11,"I just started doing it. If I didn't know how to do something or how to edit something I watched a video from other youtubers on how to do it.

12,"thanks for the wall of text xD jk I carefully read through all that and pretty much have to agree with it. Of course I could be a korean farmer and that's why I provided you guys my channel, but I see that it still could be a bait. Sorry for asking on here and like I said, I think I just have to be patient and someday maybe I'll get the chance :)

No problem, I understand where it's coming from. I hope I didn't scare you away from my channel with the post... the whole reason why I posted this is because I'm impatient. ",2016-11-12 13:08:17+00:00,d9x4bho,4,t1_d9wmqaf,43016,summonerswar
13,"I really like #1 this would put alot more diversity to the arena matches. 
As much as I hate to fight against a seara I don't think she should be nerfed... just like the spd leader from psamathe and the others. some monster will always be considerd op. I would much more like to see other farmable monsters getting a little buff to counter those guys.
Number 5 is a really interesting idea that would take away alot from that speed meta 
I don't like the idea of #6 just like you that would make both pretty weak. Although it would make my life alot easier killing them :D",2016-11-12 01:53:52+00:00,d9woc5r,1,t3_5chb6p,12605,summonerswar

23,"I do have a Logitech c920 myself and I'm pretty happy with it. the quiality is great and I think alot of other youtubers use it too. 
that being said I don't know if it works on slow computers but I don't think you'll have a problem running it (I use win 10 and it works fine) 

Yes, you can easily place it on alot of different monitors.

I don't know of any other good webcams with a similar price but I bought the Logitech c525 before and switched to the c920 shortly after because the quality was really bad.

So I would definitely recommend the c920 hope I could atleast help you a little bit :) If you want to see the camera in action you can check out my channel :)",2016-11-11 00:54:03+00:00,d9v6gaw,1,t3_5cbhz8,1216,NewTubers

39,Best way is to use a mirroring program on your pc so you get your mobilephone screen on your pc screen. I use mirroring 360 which is a really easy to use program. It costs around 12 bucks but you can use a 7 day tray version which should be enough. Then you need a program to record your gameplay ob your pc. Open broadcaster software is an easy to use program and its free you should try it :),2016-10-24 01:49:44+00:00,d9517o5,1,t3_58v6m5,103890,summonerswar
