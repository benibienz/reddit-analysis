My channel is more or less new (first video I uploaded was half a year ago) and I really want to improve my channels looks and videos. The banner is currently being worked on so that wont be a problem. But I want my channel to be more welcoming and the other problem is that my viewers only watch my videos for like 2 mins on average so what do you guys think I should improve in my videos ? As an example you could watch my last two videos and tell me in which way I can make sure to get my viewers more hooked :)
Strength: I am still learning but I'm pretty happy with my editing skills, I do have a pretty good setup which I'm constantly improving (I still need better lights and a nice background)
Weakness: I'm still not super confident with my english but it is getting better with each video. I don't really know what else could be a weakness thats why I'm asking you guys :P 

This is my channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_ZUZ3Ech86DTQ-yPvxtjw

Thank you guys alot for helping me :)
