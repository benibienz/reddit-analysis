I added two plus two, even though there is no official proof that it was iCloud generating this problem (no one from the jailbreak community has said this per se, I consider myself an unofficial source of information).
 These first nights I deactivated iCloud AND didn't charge my phone (made my best to have 100% before going to sleep). Everything went swell.
