I have a jailbroken iPhone 5, running 9.0.2. And during this last month I have noticed it’s been acting really weird when the data are active. The battery drains like crazy! For example, the % drops from 68% to 29% in a flash, but if I disable data and reboot it, it usually returns to the 68% or 67%. 
I always have the phone running on battery saving mode, and I don’t have overbearing lockscreen tweaks, I have jellylock unified, and protean (for status bar organization and icons).

I once tried to install weatherboard and another similar tweak , but uninstalled them after a few hours because they required to always have my location active and that takes up my data usage.

What could be causing this battery drainage and deregulation? Do you have any ideas?
Should I access the folders of uninstalled tweaks and delete them to make sure they’re not sucking up my battery?

Also, has a jailbreak come out for the iOS 10 for iPhone 5? I remember reading that it has been done for 5S and up, but still no word for iPhone 5… Should I have any hope?

I ask to correct them, and after that more than half of the folders are empty. After the error checking, correction files are created with the name of some of the folders.

I have tried deleting the error files and copying the missing folders again, but this seems like a vicious cycle that won't end. I'm getting frustrated with this...  Can you think of what could be causing this? I tried formatting the pen drive to its default settings and still nothing...

The phone would always crash overnight and in the morning I would always have an ""Apple Logo of Death"", and it would be stuck there the whole day, unless I would DFU it. 
After reading quite a bit, about how I should restore the phone to factory settings, jailbreak (updating and reinstalling Cydia Substrate), turning it off and then, rebooting, and only then restore my local computer backup; none of those procedures seemed to be working and everyday I had to re-jailbreak, and downgrade the iOS since 9.1 came out.
Then I read one post somewhere that it might be the iCloud backup that was creating conflict with the tweaks and the jailbreak itself (it was something along those lines). So one night I decided to not allow iCloud to backup anything (still logged but everything is disabled) and turn off my data and my wifi connection before going to sleep. And somehow, in someway, IT WORKED!! It's been three days now since I've done this and I never had a problem with overnight crashing. 

I don't know if this will help you in any way, just thought I'd share my experience and my way to get around the overnight crashes... Hope I helped someone!!

EDIT: Guys, I'm giving you my experience, I am not a developer, a programmer nor do I understand tweak-building whatsoever... I'm just sharing my solution. I'm feeling a bit scared when some of you ask me for advice because I'm afraid I won't be helping at all...",jailbreak,"[Discussion] For those experiencing overnight crashing and consequential ""Apple Logo of Death"", this was my crazy solution...",https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3q9lge/discussion_for_those_experiencing_overnight/

First of all it took me 7 tries to successfully jailbreak it. It would stop at 90% and cydia would't appear on my phone. Then I was able to jailbreak it (after a lot of cursing at the phone). ""Cool, I did it!!"". At the end of the day my battery was low and I thought of letting it drain until the end, a bad habit of mine and the worst idea with the jailbreak, as I found out after. When the phone died, I plugged it to start charging and the phone got stuck on the Apple logo. After half an hour, I started panicking. DFU'ed the phone and everything was ok, but Cydia was no longer on my phone and Pangu9 said the phone was already jailbroken. Restored the phone to the original settings and then put all my backup data on it. The next morning I jailbroke the phone once again, this time with Pangu9 1.0.1 (it only took me 3 tries this time), and the day after, when i let my battery go all the way down IT HAPPENED AGAIN! (Yes, it was stupid of me, but I thought this version of Pangu9 would be more stable, how was I suppose to know?) So now here I am, DFU'ing the iPhone 5 again, restoring to original settings, putting all my data on it again, and giving one more try to the Pangu9 1.0.1 jailbreak.
