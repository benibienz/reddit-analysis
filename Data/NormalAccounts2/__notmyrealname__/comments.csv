3,"With enough practice your hand will know all by itself what size an ""octave"" is. Even without a piano in front of me, I can reach an octave with my fingers without even thinking about. It's muscle memory. 

For practice, might I suggest you try out some of your regular practice routines using octaves as a replacement? When you're just starting out, I'd suggest running through a scale and reaching an octave for the first and last note, so that the scale begins and ends with you hitting that octave in time, from a different finger position. 

I wouldn't suggest doing entirely octaved scales for practice - at least not initially - for a couple of reason. Firstly, this won't really help you learn how to *transition* to and from an octave reach, as you'll be starting and maintaining the same finger position throughout. And secondly, practicing this way will likely encourage ""tensing"", where you might inadvertently tense your fingers to try an maintain the shape. This is bad practice and will affect timing as well as transition to and from this finger position. ",2016-11-15 12:11:46+00:00,da15hu1,2,t1_da0j746,44704,piano

16,"I guess it's different for everybody, but my motivation comes from three places that I can think of. 

The first is enjoying the music. If there's a piece I want to play because I enjoy the sound, I'm more motivated to not only learn it, but to get it *right*. If I love a piece, I want to do it justice when I play. If you want motivation, find pieces you like to listen to. It doesn't even have to be a ""piano"" piece. You can find a decent piano cover for just about anything, and if you're feeling up to it, you can even prepare a cover yourself! It's great from a learning perspective; experimenting with how to translate something into a piano piece, and it feels very rewarding when you get it right!

The second for me is the challenge. I like to pick things that I know are a little bit harder than I'm used to. These are the pieces that will take me the longest to learn, and will be the most frustrating. Personally, the satisfaction of finally doing something that, for me, was very difficult far outweighs the negative feelings of frustration felt toward reaching that point. 

And the last is learning and playing pieces that are fun. Some music, and I assume the nature of this music differs from person to person, is just fun to play. Not necessarily complex or even a genre you're particular interested in, but the actions are enjoyable. Coming from a 100% classical music background, I've only now started getting into ragtime, and I absolutely love it! Despite not being a massive fan of the genre, it's just so damn fun to play! So maybe it's worth looking into different genres and styles and finding one that looks interesting to you? 

It takes discipline, and like most things, the reward is often only at the end, not the beginning or the middle. Some days, I just don't feel like practising, but *every* day, I feel like *playing*. So I make sure I do that. If I can't muster the energy to tackle the latest measure in the latest piece I'm trying to get to grips with, I'll instead spend 20 minutes playing what I already know, and just enjoy the music.

22,"What I'm saying is that arming yourself, and *threatening* someone whose only intent was to steal your TV is *more likely* to create a threatening situation for your family than simply letting them get on with it. 

A burglar almost certainly doesn't want to kill you over a few bucks, however if you threaten him, he now has *incentive* to hurt you (and your family), as his life is on the line. Bare in mind that most criminals are non-violent, so the *more* likely scenario is that your threats incites a violent altercation with a non-violent criminal, than your gun saving you from an actually violent criminal. 

To me, a mobile phone on your bedside table is *far* more likely to save you and your family than a weapon is, and I want to give them the best chance possible.

23,"If something like that happened to me, I'd want those guys dead. That whole situation is awful, truly, truly awful. However, I feel that would be an emotionally driven response, and I don't want to base my decisions that way. Instances such as those stated above, are very rare in comparison to regular burglaries. The vast, vast, majority of the time, the guy breaking into your house is some kid, who's had a really shit go of life - partly from personal decisions, but also from unavoidable circumstances (upbringing, environment, social standing, race, mental state), and to kill him is to say that your stuff is worth more than his life. To me, this is murder. No *person*, no matter how deranged, is less valuable than some ""*thing*"" I own. Of course that's a personal conclusion that others will disagree with. Additionally, arming yourself gives incentive to a potentially non-violent criminal, with no intent of causing harm, to then exercise force instead of only relieving you of your stuff, in fact, I feel that arming yourself is *more* likely to incite violence, both from you, *and* the criminal in question, than the criminal, alone, causing you harm.

Jokes aside (and I was really just poking fun at Christianity there, I don't honestly think the religious are in any way less cognitively capable than anyone else) people believe that which they have been exposed to, and that with which they can maintain an internal logical consistency. For me, things like organised religion fall apart at the first hurdle, where metaphor and literals get lost in the swaths of text, and word-of-mouth philosophy. I *can't* accept that there was a talking snake, that the whole earth flooded, and that the universe is only 6000 years old. That fails my internal consistency test. So where do I draw the line? Earth age as stated in the bible is a metaphor, but zombie Jesus is literal? Nope. That fails too for me, but I guess it wouldn't for all, and people can't really control that feeling. 

I would *love* to believe in *something*. Something that gives me purpose and makes me special, but I'm being totally honest when I say I simply *can't*. It doesn't make sense to me. It's not that I'm ""smarter"" than people ""taken in"" by religion - I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm ""religiously stupid""? Maybe my eternal soul is a fucking dumbass?

If they were good people they would die and go to a nice place (he decided what ""good"" was), if they weren't they would be punished forever in the most vile ways imaginable. So now everything's just a mess. No ones is perfect, so no one can go to the nice place without doing stuff like sacrifice and shit. Seems silly but thems the rulez.

49,"Wow same deal here. My father is a Pastor. My sister is the apple of his eye. She was heavily involved in the church growing up, and when she finished secondary school, she took a gap year working full time, without pay, for the church, found a nice christian dude (her second boyfriend), married him, and they have a kid now. They're both still heavily involved the church. 

My parents are good people, and they try their best not to play favourites, but I guess they can't help it. They paid for my sisters University (after saying our whole lives we'd have to to pay for it ourselves) and paid for all of her expenses both during Uni, and throughout her gap year. 

For me, they helped buy a ticket out of the country and I was on my own from there. 

I've been living in the UK for 8 years now and they've visited twice in that time, once because my sister was coming up, and the other time because they had a church conference nearby. The were hear about 3 weeks and spent 2 nights with me. 

Now that my sister is moving up here too, they're looking at making frequent visits by getting involved with churches in the UK. 

I guess I'm making them sound kind of awful, but like I said, they don't *mean* to play favourites, they just can't help it. Every few months they feel guilty and try to keep in touch with me via text and Skype video calls. That normally lasts a couple of weeks, then they forget and I don't hear from them for a few months. Plus a lot of the times when I do see them, they end up giving me a bunch of money saying, ""Well, we've been helping your sister out, so we thought we'd be fair and give you some money too."". I try to refuse, but they're pretty insistent. They *want* to be fair and I know they *love* me, but our lifestyles and ideologies are so diametrically opposed that's it's difficult. We can't get personal with each other for fear of someone being offended. They're opposed to things like gay rights, and pro things like the death penalty, so for the sake of our relationship our conversations have to be pretty shallow, like the weather, or tennis or something. Kinda sucks really. They really are nice people, we just don't see eye to eye on a lot of the important stuff. ",2016-07-05 08:16:39+00:00,d4zrsij,2,t1_d4zqcxf,4665,AskReddit

When you do something, you create a neurological pathway in your brain, and when you remember something, synapses fire along that pathway. The pathway isn't a ""thing"" so much as it is a *configuration* of things, and while those things may die, the new things replace them to maintain that configuration. 

Like a road. The road itself is the memory, not the destination - the twists and turns, the ups and downs. As the road erodes and potholes form, they are continuously filled in, so that after a period of time, none of the *original* tar that made up the road is still there, but the road still follows the same basic patterns - the twists and turns, the ups and downs.

Maybe a difference in lifestyle means it's less likely to give you the same benefits or convenience than it does me, maybe you haven't considered something that a smartphone has to offer that would benefit you greatly, maybe *I* haven't considered something you have and I'd be better without one?

For me personally, there are just so many benefits to a smartphone that I sometimes feel some technologically adverse people fail to realise. 

The assumption from some is that a smartphone is a phone with lots of, *""fun""*, but ultimately unnecessary fluff to go with it, and why bother with all that extra stuff if you just want to make and receive calls and texts? 

For *me* it's not a phone with extra ""fluff"", but a *computer* that can also make an receive calls. It allows me to do all the things that used to be accessible only from my home or my work (where my computers are). Now I'm able to carry them out absolutely anywhere, and I'm not just talking about games and facebook. I'm talking about accessing my bank account and managing my finances (I can even use my phone as my ""card"" instead of my actual debit card with Android Pay), getting emails, receiving headline news as and when it happens, constant whether updates (it's nice to if it's about to rain 10 minutes before I go for lunch), satellite navigation (I just tell my phone ""Take me *insert place here*"" and it'll direct me from wherever I am), not to mention holding gigabytes of my books and music (waaay more than I could actually carry, and easier than carrying a phone AND a kindle/mp3 player/whatever), not to mention internet access instantly available where ever I go, all accessible from a tiny device that fits neatly into my pocket.

I agree that one can always learn more, but surely you reach a point where ""more"" is no longer what someone can *show* you, but rather that which *you* must discover, as there is no one *to* show you? 

Where is the need for a teacher in situations where you are more qualified and more experienced than any teacher available to you? Does it just help to have an outside party evaluate your technique, even if you ""know better""? 

On that, note, do the current top professional pianists still have ""lessons""? I imagine they collaborate with others and try to learn together *with* people, but don't see what any teacher could... well... teach them?

It's ""Hammer *action*"". I never said they actually had hammers, just that they try to simulate the feel. I can tell the difference, I just make do. Different digital pianos employ completely different methods to create that simulation, it is in no way a ""brand"", but rather a specification. I linked a diagram in my last comment with an example, there are many others. 

Maybe you can hear 64 polyphony immediately, please be aware that many people can't and understand that this doesn't make them stupid.

89,"I'd love a piano but I need to save space, and can't make that much noise in my apartment, I'm talking about a best suited alternative, not a replacement,  for a piano. 

""Hammer action"", and ""weighted keys"" are not brand names, they are key types. 

[Synthesisers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Inside_the_Yamaha_SY77.jpg) just  have a pad to read the key press. 

[Hammer action and weighted keys](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-11YiRsKO1pI/UmdIhTJKr2I/AAAAAAAAEws/LGqTQNgoCEM/s1600/AHAIV-F+key+action.jpg) have weights and pivots to offer resistance to a key press and simulate a hammer strike. 

You're right  that notes drop when sustained after reaching the polyphony limit, but it's not as noticable as you make it out to be. Also for the most part you should be employing proper pedal control and not sustaining notes throughout the entirety of a song or for very long periods, (exceptions obviously apply). If I was to link you a recording of a played piece, one played on a piano, one on a digital piano with 64 voice polyphony, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference. 

You fail to mention that ""velocity"" is the same measure a piano uses for note volume. The speed with which the hammer strikes the string determines the volume. Velocity sensitive keys try to emulate this. 

I know you mean well, and you're right that you can get a piano reasonably cheap, and that, no matter how closely imitated, a digital piano is not a piano and will have it's differences, but do you have to be so condescending? Maybe you didn't mean to and I read into that incorrectly, for which I apologise if that is the case, but repeating ""you haven't learned enough to tell the difference"" thrice in that manner comes across as pretty rude, which is your prerogative I guess, but a little tact would help your argument.",2016-05-26 21:03:45+00:00,d3kyc3m,3,t1_d3kv3q6,4211,piano

91,"As you're from the UK, if you're willing to go a *little* bit over your stipulated price there, I would like to recommend the gear4music digital piano, the [DP-6](http://www.gear4music.com/Keyboards-and-Pianos/DP-6-Digital-Piano-by-Gear4music/X25).

It's very versatile and offers most of the features you'd find in the very high-end expensive name brand digital piano (such as Roland, Yamaha and Casio), most notably fully weighted, graded hammer-action keys, which is an absolute *must* in my opinion for that ""real piano feel"" which you often need to pay out the arse for, as well as 64 voice polyphony (which is more honestly more than enough despite some newer models now providing 128+). 

I can't really attest to how well it is compared to the other name-brand counterparts (it's the best I could afford), but comparing it to the old upright acoustic I had at my parents place, it feels, sounds, and plays better than I could have hoped, and looks pretty nice as a furniture piece to boot. 

I'm not a shill for gear4music, I promise, I was just so gladdened at how well it performed (my expectation were quite low considering the price). I've played for about 11 years, but when I moved out of my folks place, I left the country (and my piano) behind, and for a few years I rarely managed to get any playing in. I missed it horribly, but I didn't have the space for an acoustic, and I couldn't afford a decent digital. After THREE YEARS I had enough, bit the bullet and bought the best I could afford that (seemed) to offer the most, and I was very pleased with the DP-6 (I still use it now). 

I should note however that the pedal it comes with is *awful*. It's a sqaure, plastic, clunky nightmare, and I'd suggest buying a replacement with the piano. You can get a perfectly fine one for +/-£15. ",2016-05-26 10:00:55+00:00,d3k8o6r,1,t3_4l2ic6,37674,piano

96,"&gt;Morrowind was superior in every way besides the graphics engine. In the grand scheme of things, that barely even matters.

What about AI? That sucked in Morrowind. People were just lifeless puppets, reacting only when initiated by a scripted scene or direct player interaction. They just... stood there. This was improved tremendously in Oblivion, and more so in Skyrim. 

What about those god awful RTD strikes? At the start of the game [it feels like you miss more times than you hit](https://youtu.be/6TKSL9wENUE). Not to mention those *god awful* animations. 

Listen, a *lot* of people like Morrowind, and that's fine, but it's kinda naive to assume because you or anyone in particular preferred it that makes it objectively better. Skyrim was a wildly successful game, and many consider it a fantastic game, and their opinions are valid regardless of what people think. I think Skyrim is fucking awesome. I think Morrowind is fucking awesome (although much too dated now) and I think Oblivion is fucking awesome. I think Each game offered new stuff the last did not, and I missed feature from the previous every time, but how shit would it be if we just got a new Morrowind ever 5 years? Just the same thing again and again and again. Some shit isn't going to work. Some stuff people aren't going to like, but you *have* to try and evolve the franchise. You have to *keep trying to make it better*, and thank god Bethesda is doing that. They could easily make money just pumping out the same shit every year, but I guess they don't want to do that (yet), and to me that's a good thing.

97,"&gt;Anyone remember Levitation? 

This was removed more due to hardware limitation than anything else. They couldn't account for someone trying to levitate over a city wall which existed in a separate cell and was separated by a loading screen. 

&gt;Polearms? Throwing knives? 

Yeah. They got rid of spears and throwing knives, but what about crossbows? How about forging your own weapons? What about dual wielding? Morrowind didn't have those things.

&gt; Heck, how about Athletics, Acrobatics

How about sprinting, shield bashing, mounted combat and no more 30mph humans jumping 30ft in the air. I mean, it was a *little* silly. 

&gt;the Mysticism school of magic?

The school names are just a means of sorting the different spells. The mysticism spells just happened to fit nicely into Alteration or Conjuration. There were some really great improvements to magic in Skyrim. 


&gt;Back in Morrowind we were given hints about where to go. Fuzzy instructions. And off we went exploring the game world, all freely available for us. By Skyrim, the railroading is so strong that quest-givers no longer have to give us any information, as it is implied we just follow the arrow through the completely linear dungeon to reach the goal.

&gt;By the next Elder Scrolls game, I expect they will have done away with any and all delusions of choice and turned the whole game into ""Press this button to progress the game"".

Hopfeully not, this is where we, as the players, need to communicate our desires and if enough of us feel the same Bethesda will listen. What we must be careful *not* to do is detract from all the good they've done. I'd hate to lose some of the things Skyrim introduced, like sprinting, shield bashing, mounted combat, enhanced vampirism and lycanthropy, levelling up by doing (this is a bit of split topic), improvements to magic (could be less underpowered though), world depth, and yes, even radiant quests because we all couldn't shut up about how Morrowind was better in ever conceivable way, when that really isn't the case.

As an infant, you know nothing. You have no control over the world as it unfurls around you. Your exposure to the world was tailored uniquely from a perspective mostly out of your control. You didn't get to choose where you were born, what race you were, what sex you were, what you looked like, what you heard, or what you saw, and yet in those formative years, the foundations of your personality were being built. Cognitive biases were created and enforced by the family raising you who shared those biases. Beliefs start to form. Aided by peer interaction, and social learning, conclusions are drawn by yourself from *real* observations *you experienced* and *honest* interpretations so far as you've been raised to make those interpretations.

We're all attracted to different things aesthetically, and that's okay, there's nothing we can do about that. If I'm not attracted to tall girls for example, I can't *make* myself attracted to them.

At first glance it's easy to attribute the same logic to the above scenario, but does it really fit? What significance does a persons *past* physical state have on what you may or may not consider attractive? If I wasn't attracted to overweight women, and I met a woman that *used* to be overweight, does it make sense for me to say, ""Oh, you *used* to be fat? I'm sorry that's gross.""? 

Now again, I want to emphasise, that *I agree with you*, I am *not* attracted to a vagina that used to be a penis, but I guess what I'm saying is *that is* ***not*** *fine*.

150,"I get what you're saying, but something that seems like a big deal to you or me, might not to the Bethesda team or even the fan-base as a whole. When I think about the ""little things"", I don't think about gimmicky mechanics like gambling on fights or races, but about contextual story-telling present in the game world; terminals that offer no purpose other than to offer a history of the building you wondered to, gunfights in the distance which have nothing to with you, a family of skeletons still sat having breakfast as they were when the bombs fell. These are the little details Bethesda excels at.

As for mechanics, what pleases some is irrelevant to others, and with something included something will be excluded. Some people will be disappointed all of the time. No company can get it all right simply because there is no such thing as ""all right"". 

That being said it's important to voice you opinions on what *should* be a priority. I think you'll find that even though it may not fall in line with how you, or anyone other individual in particular, envisions the game should be, Bethesda will do there best to comply with the desires of their audience (it's in their best interest to do so). I know it feels like some of the things you pointed out are what *most* of the fans are after, and that Bethesda has ignored them, but I think you'll find that when you voice an opinion about something you want, only those that agree or vehemently disagree will chime in on that opinion, and those affirming or dissenting opinions form the basis of of what you think the community as a whole desires:

""Lots of people agree with me, this must be what *most* people want"" 

or 

""Lost of people disagree with me, people must *not* want this"".

That is literally impossible. The ""t"" and ""th"" sounds are made because placing the tongue on the roof of the mouth and the top teeth block the air travelling from the lungs over the vocal chords. Releasing your tongue allows the sound to ""escape"" and generates a noise related to the gaps being created while the tongue is removed from that surface and the speed at which this process occurs. Placing your tongue on the bottom of your mouth or on your bottom teeth would not block access to the airway. There is no way to make plosive noises this way.

I'm not calling you out or anything, I'm also tongue tied (tongue is connected via a, sort of, sheet to the bottom of my mouth) but not so much so that it's affected my speech in any noticable way, I'm just not able to stick my tongue out of my mouth very far.

You talk about ""dumbing down"" in Skyrim compared to Oblivion, Oblivion compared to Morrowind, and Fallout 1/2 and Fallout 3, but I think this is an oversimplification. You're right, in a sense, that from your perspective of playing the statistics to your favour and developing your character based on quantifiable traits, has been simplified. Skyrim does this much more intuitively, and I can see how someone looking for a DnD type adventure suffers from these simplifications. Those types of people don't make the whole ""core-fanbase"" though. There are others of us, who want more of an immersive role-playing experience, and that's exactly what they've done. Morrowind, for all it's merits, is a dead plane. The people are puppets, and the world, quiet and unresponsive. I feel like a player in a game. In Oblivion less so, and in Skyrim less still. The people have more personality and the world feels more realised and interactable. I feel like I'm *living* there, *doing* the quests, *fighting* the battles, as opposed to playing the game, rolling the die, and upping my stats. In this sense, Skyrim feels *smarter* than the previous iterations, not dumber.

As for my personal opinion,  it's not as cut and dry as that. It's not a case of ""assuming *just in case*"".

The geographical and cultural disparity of religion lends evidence to the very reasonable idea that religion is man-made, with different parts of the world practising religion as it formed within their own culture.

Personally I don't see the harm in personal belief, but am saddened if it closes a person to *real* answers. The perception of God has shrunk considerably over the years. We know a God didn't make all the plethora of different animals, evolution did. We know a God doesn't control the weather, planetary and environmental conditions dictate weather patterns. We know a God doesn't create natural disasters, like eathquakes and volcanoes, tectonic movements below the surface of the earth do. 

There's still many questions left unanswered. How did life first emerge? What was the catalyst for the birth of our universe? These are *important* questions, and whilst I will always sit firmly in a position of skepticism over a Godly assumtion, I think it's okay to attribute those unanswered questions to a higher-power, as long as that doesn't stop people from looking for the answers, *even* if it's something they don't want to hear, and that applies to atheists too!

It seems to me, and I'm hopeful, that fallout 4 will group the responses by tone and inflection, with an emotional response mapped to a specifc button (positive, negative, neutral, question (or some other combination)).

That's fair enough. It's a fun game to play, and if you're not into the underlying story and just want to kill some monsters I can understand that.

How so? I mean sure, they pull some elements from many different stories from the same genre as well as other genres, but that isn't exclusive to Fantasy. It applies to literally every story that anyone writes at this point. No single element in any story is going to be unique no matter how hard you try, but the point is that the combination of these elements that make up the *whole* story are what makes it original and unique. Witcher 3 has monsters, fantastical elements and a heroes journey like many other stories, but this combined with all the characters, their relationships with eachother and individual personalities, the politics and landscape of the world, the justification and or implementation of these fanstastical elements, the nature of the journey as it relates to the protagonist and antagonist(s), the atmosphere and tone etc. None of these by themselves are unique to a story, but combined they *do* make something unique and special.

189,"The key is the character you are roleplaying. He/she has to have a *personality*. Think about this before hand. You can think of a backstory, but that often isn't necessary and/or might contradict with revelations in the game you learn about ""yourself"", but you have to be a decided ""character"". 

When I create my character, the first question I ask is, ""What is this characters motivation?"". Does he/she lust for power? Money? Peace? Adventure? What's the definitive driving factor for the character. 

Once I have that down, I pick personality traits to complement that. Is he/she brash, or boastful? Rude? Anxious? Curious? Hot tempered? I pick several of these, and will very purposefully pick my SPECIAL skills to reflect these. 

The trick then, once the character is created, is to *be* that character. When faced with a decision, don't think, ""What should I do?"". Instead think, ""What would my character do?"". Sometimes this might conflict with what you would have chosen or would normally choose, but it's much more rewarding from a roleplaying perspective in my opinion. It does limit the way you interact with the game, and will result in certain quests going undone if they don't fit with character you've created, but it makes the journey all the more real in opinion. 

As an example, I might play as a very curious, but anxious individual, devoted to exploring the wastes and finding a place to call home. This character would have high intelligence, but low charisma. He isn't very strong, doesn't have much endurance, and is lacking in agility, but he *is* perceptive. What ever's left is placed in luck. 

This kind of guy isn't too fond of confrontation, and chooses instead to hone sneaking.

I mean, my partner and I are sexually loyal, and I'm completely happy with that, but at what point did the cave men and women decide, ""Nah. I think it'd just be better if we all decided that the only way to do this is with one person for the rest of your life."". For the record, I'm honestly not arguing with anyone here, the thread just suddenly made me realise how weird the whole arrangement is. 

Is it because people are inherantly jealous? I mean, given a situation where the norm was to *not* be exclusive with sex, I can't see that really being the case, as jealousy stems mostly from fear of *losing* people, and if sex was suddenly disconnected from specifically being a relational activity then people wouldn't experience the same levels of jealousy as they do in the current state of things. Much like we aren't (or shouldn't be) jealous of our partners having friends. Imagine if, like the rules of sex, you could only be friends with the person with whom you are in a relationship, and befriending an outsider was considered infidelity? 

The whole arrangement seems pretty arbitrary to be honest. ",2015-07-02 15:20:57+00:00,cspxb1b,6,t1_cspvk53,2913,AskReddit

Pretty much every boss will beat you the first time you play them in DS (or maybe I just suck), with Witcher I could come up against a challenging boss or monster, but still beat it. I also prefer the world in Witcher and enjoyed the story driven approach, but still really liked the detailed, self exploratory approach DS does when it comes to telling a story.

230,"You're right, and for me immersion is equally as important. What I'm disputing however is that this new implementation breaks that immersion. You say you getting to choose exactly what the PC says avoids a disconnect between the PC and the player, but I disagree. You choose a pre-written statement, and the NPC to which you are conversing responds dependant on how the *developer interpreted* the exchange. Maybe you imagined it harsh, but the developer imagined it light-heartedly, or vice versa.  These prompts allow you to set the mood of a conversation instead of the words expressed, and in reality you *never* had the ability to choose the words, you could only select from a small subset, and that remains unchanged. Setting the mood is an *addition* to the conversation mechanic, one that, with the right implementation , lends to a far more immersive experience. 

My point about time sensitive situations still stands, prompts offer quicker, relevant responses than fully written statements. 

I'm not saying the new way this works will be good or bad, I'm just saying that it *could* be great and we won't know until we get our hands on it and give it a go! It'd suck if Bethesda never even tried to improve on the way things are done, because the franchise would just stagnate. I'm sure there'll be a bunch of stuff people love and hate about Fallout 4, as was the case with every game in the series preceding it, the idea being that they at least have to *try* and make something better than they did last time! Some thing's they'll get wrong, but hey, how else are they supposed to find out what really works? ",2015-06-18 16:44:42+00:00,csauun1,5,t1_csas9lx,3843,Fallout
231,"I don't see how seeing the full text and just seeing the context differ all that much. Sure, people argue that if you can see the whole text, and it goes unspoken by the PC, they get to internally voice the tone and inflection, but it doesn't really work like that, because the person to whom the PC is talking will respond dependant on what the developer *intended* the tone and inflection to be, not what was interpreted by the player. With context displayed, I feel the player can *better* communicate in a manner more in line with the way they're looking to behave, rather than reading a long awesome quip and taking it seriously only to have the conservation partner understand it as sarcasm. 

Also, keep in mind that some of these functional sacrifices lead the way to better innovate and immerse the in-game conversation mechanic. With this kind of fluid, intuitive mecahinic, the PC could be able to do things like speaking to multiple people at once. They've introduced conversation that doesn't pause the game now, again, I'd say this a step in the right direction; just providing the context allows the player to respond *quickly* instead of the long awkward silences that were ever-present in the previous games as you read and slowly weighed the response options. This ability to respond quickly is pretty much a *vital* addition in real-time conversations given time sensitive situations. ",2015-06-18 09:57:09+00:00,csajnsd,3,t1_csac3gr,23206,Fallout

235,"Building a house in Hearthfire got my Smithing WAY up. Plus, I think people weren't really doing it right with their smithing. The way it works in Skyrim is that the XP gain is conversely proportional to the *value* of the item you are making. Expensive items equate to big XP, cheap items equate to low XP. Then people complained that it takes a million iron daggers to level their smithing and that they had to grind, but obviously that's the case; iron daggers are cheap as shit and easy to make. I bet you collected a bunch of jewels in your playthrough, we all did! Make a bunch of expensive jewelery. That'll level you up pretty fast and it's pretty easy to do without having to grind. From a roleplaying perspective this makes sense also. You aren't going to become a master smither making iron daggers unless you're making millions of them. The materials are cheap and easy to work with and the design is simple. More complicated items are where you would really hone your craft.
