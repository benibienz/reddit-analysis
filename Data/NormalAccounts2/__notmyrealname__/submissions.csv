The time signature is 2/4 and typically within each measure there are 4 quavered notes making up the left hand, and 8 semi-quavered notes making up the right. When using my metronome to get the timing of the piece it was far less intuitive to accurately hit four notes (in the right hand) on a single beat while keeping in time with the 2/4 time signature than it was to use a 4/4 time signature, and hit **two** to every beat instead of 4; effectively treating the quavers as crotchets and the semi-quavers as quavers. I understand why a 2/4 signature might be of benefit to better understand note emphasis on each measure start, as intended by the composer, however changing the notation within each measure (quavers to crotchets, semi-quavers to quavers etc), not only maintains these measure starts, but made timing easier, and, in my opinion, would have made greater logistics sense from a reading standpoint - where one 4/4 bar could contain 4 crotchets as opposed to one *2/4* bar containing  4 quavers. Is this just a preference, or are there logistical reasons for choosing one time signature over another? I hope that made sense, but I'm basically asking what is the difference between [this] (http://m.imgur.com/Jk5iZ6t) and [this] (http://m.imgur.com/bR42NUO)",piano,Theory Question about time signatures,https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/5dspmq/theory_question_about_time_signatures/

Most times it's a rickety piece of shit, but I just can't help myself! I generally really struggle to play in front of people, I guess because in most situations I'm specifically trying to ""perform"" a piece, but whenever I hop onto a public piano, I don't feel so accountable for my performance and technique. Plus I'm usually preceded by someone angrily mashing the keys, trying desperately to remember how to play chopsticks to prove to their friends that they could and pissing everyone around them off - so, psychologically speaking, I generally don't feel I've anything to ""prove"". I love playing, and I like to think that's the only reason I'm ever compelled to play on a public piano, but the truth is, I like the attention too. Sometimes there'll be a little kid watching in aw, or a stranger who throws out a complement or two, or maybe I've a friend with me who'd never heard me play, but more often than not - as it's normally 2AM at some train station - a drunken lout swaying haphazardly to the rhythm of the keys with a stupid grin on their face.

I had a teacher for about a year when I was 12 or 13 years old. She taught me the basics of theory, and throughout the year I was guided on my technique (posture, positioning, that sort of thing), but ultimately she wanted me to continue on to exams and a level of professionalism that I wasn't striving for. I'm a hobbyist, and play because I love to play, not because I want to teach or to perform. When I knew enough that I felt I could pursue my *own* passions for playing (without too many terrible habits), I left the teacher and have been playing on my own since. 

I have a *fairly* sound understanding of music theory gained mostly on the fly as I pick up pieces with notation or terms with which I am not familiar, and research accordingly. This has worked fairly well for me thus far, but as I only learn what I ""need"" to for the piece at hand, unless it's something I come across often, I don't retain the information at all, and when eventually I do stumble across it, I have to ""relearn"" what I've already done. 

I was wondering if any of you know of any good free resources for learning, and *retaining* music theory. I was thinking something along the lines of interactive websites and/or apps, offering quizzes or something similar to aid in solidifying and reviewing information gained?

I decided at the age of about 12, after about a year of being taught, that I loved to play and did so only for myself and the pleasure that it brought me, and was not concerned with perfect technique or grading that my teacher was offering. I left my piano lessons behind and pursued only the music in which I found enjoyment, including my own composition. I played for my fathers church as a teen until I left my home (and my piano) to move to another country. Other than a few drunken sing-a-longs where an instrument is present, and visits to grandparents (who have a truly terrible acoustic), I've played very little over the years. I've wanted a piano for many years, but haven't had the living space (nor the money) to do so, and recently for my upcoming birthday, my wife has purchased a digital piano for me to play at home. For myself and my mediocre abilities it is perfect, but I'm curious of people's preferences as to which is the better option given the choice? 

I had a look on several forums I found discussing the topic, and a common statement was, ""You just can't beat the feel of a *real* piano"". For me, every piano I've ever played has felt different from the last and the variances of those differences doesn't extend beyond the feel of a decent weighted, hammer-action digital piano. Sure it feels ""different"" than *your* piano, but so does every other piano. Of course this might come down to the way I play. 

Additional complaints I couldn't fully understand were in regards to the digital sound being incomparable to that of a real piano. Of course compared to a keyboard of the 80's with it's cookie-cutter recording playing and cutting in time with the plastic buttons I would absolutely agree, but I don't know if I would with any modern, half-decent digital piano. I will concede that on a technical level, the piano sound is something truly unique and unmatched in terms of mechanical application. Hundreds of parts acting in tandem, sympathetic vibrations, and internal resonance are of course going to create a sound impossible to perfectly replicate, but can people really tell the difference? If the same piece was played on a digital piano and a real piano, and the recordings played back to you, would you be able to tell the difference? 

Of course, for live performances I can see and absolutely agree that this is where the acoustic wins out. A digital piano is reliant on the speakers to produce the sound, but an acoustic can truly fill a room and can literally be *felt* by the audience as hammer strikes string. I do feel that this can at least be replicated with a digital piano given a good enough sound system, however a piano can do this all on it's own, and that I believe is part of the magic. 

So, that's my take on the matter, but as I've said, I'm no professional, and would love to hear different perspectives purely out of curiosity. ",piano,Do you prefer digital pianos or acoustic? Why?,https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/3x2grd/do_you_prefer_digital_pianos_or_acoustic_why/
