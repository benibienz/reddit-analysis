If I'd walked outta uni 5 years ago into a 30k job I'd have larger amounts taken off the overall balance which would reduce the interest, you meaning I'd pay back less.

Officially our number 2 is Darlow but he isn't fit at the moment so Eliott is filling in. He's done ok so far and if he continues McClaren might keep him there - worth keeping an eye on when Darlow is fully fit in the next few weeks.

332,"There is a round of international fixtures on the 5th of September so the next premier league game week isn't until the 12th. The games on the 12th are in game week 5 in fantasy PL. You can start making changes for ganeweek 5 now so if you were to play your wildcard today you would have unlimited transfers until the next deadline which probably is 11:45 on the 12th September. 

International break is interesting because you can assess a players form outside of the PL but also you need to be aware just in case a player of yours gets injured. But also from a FPL point of view if you buy in a player and his value rises, you can sell him for profit toward the end of the week despite never actually having him playing for your team.

This is a lot of waffle and I'm kinda tipsy but hopefully this makes sense / helps :) ",2015-08-29 21:34:22+00:00,cuk3kz0,4.0,t1_cujz9rb,8240.0,FantasyPL

352,"I usually cycle to work but I'd had a couple too many on a midweek night and had to get the tube in. I eventually got on a packed Central Line train at Mile End, and as if being on that line wasn't bad enough, some absolute morons phone alarm was beeping at full volume but they just didn't realise. 

It was so difficult to tell where the sound was coming from because the train was so packed. It was one of those journeys where every person was touching at least 4 other people. A lot of people were glancing around frustratingly but the owner wasn't stopping their alarm. I knew it wasn't me because I have one radio alarm and a song from a band I like, this was neither. This was the horrible alarm clock beeping noise that everyone knows. 

Eventually I'd scoured the train enough to find who Im sure was the culprit. It was a blond female in her 30s listening to music on an MP3 player. Her music was probably loud enough so she couldn't hear her phone. Everyone else was either directly on their phones or had no headphones in so they'd know if it was them. Of course British people being British, everyone was pissed off but no one voiced any concerns. 

After about 20 mins of commuting later at Chancery lane I decided to stop silently giving this women the evils and just play a game of my phone. I took my phone out of my jeans pocket only for my worst nightmares to be realised. IT WAS MY FUCKING PHONE THE WHOLE TIME. My stupid radio alarm must have been quietly playing radio 5 live in my pocket until I got into the underground at Mile End, where with no internet signal it defaults to an alarm noise that I didn't associate with my phone. I immediately stopped the alarm and 40 pairs of eyes immediately shot in my direction. I'm a pretty chilled out guy and generally don't get too embarrassed but fuck that was horrible. I thankfully only had one stop and 2 minutes till I got off. 

I spent those 2 minutes, like a true man, red faced, staring at the adverts and making eye contact with no one! ",2015-06-29 17:18:52+00:00,csmkbk3,1.0,t3_3bf1c9,86774.0,london
