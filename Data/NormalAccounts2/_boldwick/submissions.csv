NOPE. Overnight 3.5ks WhatsApp photos firmly jumbled themselves into my google photos. I now have all sorts of crap Whatsapp photos (incl some NSFW stuff, mems, screenshots etc) next to family photos and holiday pics with no way to delete en masse. :/

I used to love using google drive whereas now I feel like one setting change has ruined the whole product for me. Its incredibly frustrating as there is no way to undo what I have done other than manually deleting thousands of photos that I dont want backed up.

Sorry for the rant. Am I doing this wrong? Is there a better way to manage all my 3rd party app photos than this?
