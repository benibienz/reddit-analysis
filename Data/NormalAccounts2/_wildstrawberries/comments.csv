215,"I hope you can find an LGBT friendly therapist to help with this. Something I've struggled with is resentment and I've learned that its important to let go. To say yes and accept one’s decisions once they are made. to say yes without regret, even if the result might be frightening or painful. 

There's a text I'd like to quote to you if you don't mind. I think it fits to your situation.

""The will to redo things differently, to go back in time a few days or years ahead is one of the most common existential aspirations. It’s adjacent, very often, to regret, a missed opportunity, a mistake, an accident, etc. Such a sentiment or desire would be impossible if we did conceive the idea that our existence is perfect, necessary, and highly desirable as it is. To go back in time to operate a change is saying no to the status quo. For Friedrich Nietzsche, for example, the desire to rewind our existence is inseparable to resentment. The superhuman emerges through the exercise of saying yes to the past. Nietzsche advocates, in Ecce Homo, for a creative ‘Yes-saying [Jasagen] without reservation, even to suffering, even to guilt, even to everything questionable and strange about existence.’ It’s a form of responsibility rather than acceptance. Once we’ve said yes, as a recognition, it doesn’t mean we’re not going to try and change the situation in the future. Behind that ethical imperative, the ideal is that of a personality so unique and united that every decision and act is the pure reflection of what it is. If I were perfect, all my acts would be perfect and there would be no need to edit my past existence. I’d already, in every situation, make the perfect choice between infinite possibilities. Saying yes to the past is a means to train the will to say yes to the present and the future in a creative and active way. The only way to change the past is by changing the present and future, because the quality of the present is what gives value to the past.""

I just keep fighting thoughts that I'm not good enough or people won't find me attractive even though they have. Self confidence is so alien to me.

Interesting point of view. I kinda agree with you. Don't you think that [becoming the director you'll be able to shape the world in your fashion, avoiding disastrous results like that? And to me it seemed like the Institute was divided whether or not Synths were becoming sentient. I think they're obviously smart people and they'll be able to learn from their mistakes. Especially now that you've become the Director you'll be able to reign them in and pave the way for your eventual successor. ](/spoiler)",2015-12-12 21:58:02+00:00,cxwu00b,2.0,t1_cx4jyfl,2097397.0,Fallout

431,"I took this to heart.
&gt; For me, I wake up in a funk, or anxious, or I feel like I don't want to do anything that morning, or I'm in a bad mood and the thought of going to work is way worse than usual. There's a lot of overlap between pre-depression and real-depression, but it hasn't gotten that strong yet.

&gt; As SOON as I feel these symptoms I start my climb out - it's almost automatic now. For me, to feel better, I have 2 things I do almost immediately: clean / organize something that has been cluttered for a while and hit the gym for any decent amount of time - doesn't have to be a crazy day.

&gt; My depression generally sets in if I get lazy, spend too much time watching TV or playing games, etc.
