It is obvious that it lets us to understand how wiggling x effects f(x). We always have real function for f(x) like x^2 or sqrt(x) or x^3+x^2, etc. So, if x changed to x+h why we just cannot put it in our function and get result. For instanse, x+h=3+0.1 though ((x+h)^3)+((x+h)^2)=(3.01^3)+(3.01^2)=36,33.
