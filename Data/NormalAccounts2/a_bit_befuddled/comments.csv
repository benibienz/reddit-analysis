I don't have a lot of free time anymore anyway, I'm getting older and I have more responsibilities. A family, a full time job, etc. 


Dude, I just want the games to be good. That's all I want. And I don't want to keep letting these devs get away with not delivering the first time around. If someone plans your wedding for months and months and it all LOOKS great but in the end it turns out a bit shit, you can't just wait until next year for your wedding to get better. I know that's not the greatest analogy, but I'm sure you can see the point. I just want good games on release and I don't like publishers who can't manage that. So fuck the division and fuck ubisoft.
