4,"I lived in India when I was 17 and went to an Indian high school while I was there -- they might teach ww2 in detail at some schools, but the one I went to (which was a well established one in the city I lived in), there was definitely not a huge mention of it. The english and the history teacher both didn't know many details about the atrocities of the Holocaust, (however they did know it was a terrible terrible genocide). The students, however, really didn't understand the Holocaust very much at all, because they didn't really have a huge reason to like we do in Europe and the States.",2016-09-08 21:59:34+00:00,d7et6vp,6.0,t1_d7erxqm,1696.0,indianpeoplefacebook

I like it when lighting comes from a [single source](http://imgur.com/jTZ6A03) - that sort of lighting kind of reminds me of a [rembrandt](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/ae/2a/b6/ae2ab619b073eeae106cbc6304cc372a.jpg) so maybe thats why I like lamps at night. 

But to get that I wouldn't stand in front of it like I do in this gif. I just liked, when I shot this set, how the lamp made the background extremely bright white while I was wearing black. ",2016-09-06 14:58:29+00:00,d7bjel4,4.0,t1_d7bj29e,503.0,TittyDrop

**Thicker:** Makes you feel full as fuck when you're getting fucked by one

45,Have you ever had someone let you face fuck them when you're somewhat close? It might feel more similar to PiV sex and be easier for you to cum that way. I don't have a dick so I don't really know but it could be worth a try. Things to keep in mind if you haven't done it before though - 1.ask him/her before you just grab their face and go unless they've said they're into surprise ff-ing 2.be prepared for minor tooth contact because the recipient loses a lot of control as to where your dick is in their mouth/throat and sometimes teeth happen and 3. Have some sort of tap out system in place so you don't accidentally activate any gag reflexes without realizing it. ,2016-08-21 17:22:45+00:00,d6qru1o,2.0,t1_d6qmoym,8349.0,sex

The tentacles are very much out of proportion right now because they are just in rough sketch mode, but hopefully they'll make the creature look more roundish in shape rather than horizontally long, making the shorter wing span make more sense.

151,"I wasn't alive for either of the scandals, but how I see it is that Clinton was easier to forgive because he lied about something we consider to be a personal matter (his sexual engagements and whatnot). Even if his actions were immoral, they have to do with his personal relationships - his actions weren't an offense against his own people. Nixon's deception, however, involved participating in a variety of illegitimate practices to increase the likelihood of re-election. Some of which involved invading the privacy of the citizens he is in office to protect. This was an attack on our core values as a nation - a disregard for democracy. 

I'm not excusing Clinton for sexually harassing his interns or lying under oath - but the scandal in question was about something that many Americans felt wasn't their business in the first place. Nixon on the other hand really acted in a way that flew in the face of what it meant to be president. Thats why they each have the legacy that they have. 

There are certainly gender issues at play here as to why Clinton hasn't been more shamed for his history of sexual harassment but I think its more likely that Americans didn't see Bill Clinton's cheating on his wife and sexual harassment as an affront to *them* or the *values of this nation* whereas Nixon's campaign was deliberately trying to illegitamately tamper with the outcome of an election (and if voting is supposed to be the most important civic duty...). 

I get irked when I see people compare Clinton's scandal to Watergate and say that its due to sexism and rape culture alone that Clinton has been able to maintain his political leverage. Sexism/rape culture is a huge part of why Clinton got away with so much of what he did but from my perspective, the difference in public perception of the two politicians isn't that Clinton hurt a woman and women don't matter enough to care, but more that Nixon offended *me* and Clinton hurt *someone else.* ",2016-05-29 14:28:43+00:00,d3o1i2l,2.0,t1_d3nup4i,22196.0,Negareddit

Even being there voluntarily, you can suddenly feel trapped as decisions about when you will be released can take much longer than you would like them to. 

People who are on sanctioned suicide often value having agency over their lives highly. A psych ward is a hard place to feel like you have any control at all. 

I am just reaching out now because if you need someone to talk to after your release feel free to pm me.

195,"I cited $15/hr as my income earlier in one of the comments and I was being generous. I think I deserve that for the work I put in to be completely honest. I really try to read customers and get them what they need when they need it. Do customers realize they are one of anywhere from 3 to 7 or even more tables we are trying to accommodate at the same time? It's not as simple as just getting food from point A to point B when it comes out of the kitchen. I want some of them to play those online waitressing time-management games and then realize thats what we do but actually on our feet, while dealing with rude customers, day in and day out, while trying to please our managers, for what are usually 10 hour shifts where any few hours of that time can be spent waiting for business to pick up or doing side work where we are making effectively no money. Its a hard job, but I love it... largely because I'm rewarded with a livable wage and gracious customers (regardless of what they tip me). 

I'm not saying we need big money for that, it's not like this deeply important work to society or anything, but the $15 dollars an hour I make is livable for me comfortably and I'm just a single young adult with no child unlike the many mothers who are my co-workers who often have multiple children to support.

Time is a good way of going about it though in my opinion as long as its also taken into consideration the quality of service he/she provided as well. If you think she did a minimum wage job, then give her minimum wage. If you think she went above and beyond and you notice its especially busy (or especially slow god-forbid) then allow your tip to reflect that. I am appreciative to get a 15% tip, validated when I get a 20% tip, but if youre a regular and you have a rapport with your waitress, occasionally tipping a little extra makes up for assholes who stiffed him/her. At the end of the day we appreciate whatever you give as long as its not downright disrespectful of the work we did for you. ",2016-05-18 21:03:13+00:00,d3aqzqu,4.0,t1_d3aqkm7,543.0,Showerthoughts
201,"The way I see it is that if tipping were abolished, it would affect my livelihood, whereas the existence of tipping affects customers only when they go out to eat. 

I could point out that a customer really doesn't have to tip if they don't want to where-as they would *have* to pay more regardless of service under the ""no tip but increased food price"" model. I could point out that customers do genuinely get better service when wait-staff know that their service to that particular table affects how much they make from that particular table. 

But at the end of the day, and I've felt this from before I started waitressing and now that I've been waitressing for over a year, when wait-staff are saying ""protect the tipping system"" it's their income they are talking about whereas when customers are saying ""abolish the tipping system,"" its about 10 dollars required *maximum* they are talking about when they *choose* to go out to eat. 

I get why tipping is annoying, but really as both a customer and worker at restaurants - tipping isn't a huge deal considering how much it helps wait-staff make a livable wage in the States.

Edit: If you want evidence as to how tipping really does help customer service... think about a midprice chain restaurant and a midprice chain retail clothing store -- think about the difference in service you get at these two places. Think about the long lines, dead stares, and rude cash-outs you get at mall clothing stores vs. the attentive, friendly service you (should and likely are) getting from somewhere like Olive Garden or Applebees.

To those who say that anything more than a ""hi.. here are the specials... drink order... food order... check..."" is an intrusion on the meal, I get it, that's how I am when I go out to eat too, but you might not understand that we have managers looking over our shoulder making sure we try to up-sell you items and secret-shoppers reporting our service to our managers. We have to make a huge effort to read the table correctly so that we give the service our managers expect *and* the service you actually want as a customer.

1. The process of getting them pierced. I'm really into pain.

2. I like the look of them - i think they are super hot visually plus they keep nipples more erect which I also find hot

3. Along the lines of keeping nipples erect, a lot of women who have flat nipples and prefer the look of bigger ones will get nipple piercings to keep them looking more full

4. They definitely make your nipples more sensitive

5. There's a lot of cool fun jewelry you can put in from etsy and the like and i wish mine were still pierced so I could use it. Stuff like suns that go around the nipple, snakes that go through. There's way cooler stuff than the barbells that most people have.

6. Also its just kind of a kink thing too. Like I've gone with people I hook up with to get my nipples pierced and they find it hot.

225,"Thats a definite possibility, mostly what I was trying to point out is that a lot of people look at this with relief like its the end of a long struggle for this man when to those who feel chronically suicidal see this as the continuation of the seemingly endless struggle that is life. 

I really think its more likely that when someone is ""saved,"" by someone it is just that they now have a witness who would bear the weight of their death if they were to go through with it so they know they can't do it that night and then they have a motivation to get through crisis mode but it doesn't really *solve* any long term problems. 

I just don't look at these moments with relief like many people do. I look at them as I'm sorry you're hurting and will probably continue to cycle in and out of hurt until you reach the end one way or another. It is very meaningful when someone reaches out like this, but that connection wears off really fast and then you're left with yourself again.

But when you're all patched up and in the hospital and everything has quieted down, for me, I was 100 percent back in suicidal mode two fold. It was even worse than before because: 

a. I was angry with myself for not finishing the job 

b. I felt kind of a ""come down"" from all that adrenaline and a lot of guilt for getting myself and family into the situation to begin with 

&amp; c. now I knew how to successfully kill myself if I can anticipate and plan for that survival instinct. The first time you feel that survival instinct it feels intensely real, but then you remember that its just chemicals (just like depression is) and you make the calculation in your head that ""okay if our thoughts are just chemicals, I might as well make decisions based on the balance that is more often present in my head - the suicidal ones, and plan to kill myself in a way so that the less common survival instinct ""i want to live"" thoughts can't interfere.""",2016-04-27 14:18:44+00:00,d2jbpzh,4.0,t1_d2jbh27,375.0,gifs

A cop showing some compassion might help in the immediate moment, but there's a high liklihood that person is going to go to bed crying and wishing that that cop hadn't come so they could have finally just gotten it all over with.",2016-04-27 12:57:45+00:00,d2j8rvs,2.0,t1_d2j4qup,11092.0,gifs

275,"Think about it this way, if suicide is killing *yourself* then it has to be left completely up to you to make it happen. As someone who is extremely suicidal and has been for over half my life and wishes a medic wouldn't save me if they were called... it is not fair to ask another person to just watch me die and have to live with that later. It was my responsibility in the first place to be discreet and quick enough to die before anyone else is involved.

It is hard to kill yourself but the way I see it is that I can't manipulate people around me to make it happen, I can't make them feel like it was their fault, or involve them in any way. Suicide is a selfish thing to do - regardless of the amount of  pain I'm in, in my experience if I can think at all about what Im doing to my family and close friends then I'm not able to make the attempt. That doesn't mean it's necessarily the *wrong* thing to do, just because my family and friends will be hurt, but it *is* the selfish thing, I'm thinking of myself. And if I'm going to be selfish, I may as well be entirely self-reliant in the act and really embody the symbolism of taking your *own* life and making that *choice.* I'm saying this, because it is unfair to force a medic or doctor or anyone else to aid you in what is your choice.

277,"Snape died for Lily and Dumbledore died for the greater good of defeating Voldemort. I think Harry becomes an interesting character when you look at how much he has been used by the people in his life that you thought cared about him in the earlier books. Harry recognizes as he gets older that its not *him* its his place as the chosen one that makes everyone ""care."" EVEN DUMBLEDORE the benevolent old wizard is actually just recognizing that Harry is the only way to defeat the true evil that is Voldemort. I believe it becomes clear that Dumbledore would sacrifice Harry in a moment if it meant defeating Voldemort. For a children's book, especially, this is a very complex element and really captures the truly heart-wrenching desperation and confusion of war. Harry really has thought that people loved him and been proven wrong again and again. Its heartbreaking to read. 

TLDR when you look at the motivations behind why characters reacted to Harry as they did, maybe Harry *himself* doesn't become more interesting, but maybe thats because you start to see him as the object for use that everyone else in the older generation sees him as.

303,"This is good advice OP.
I also want to add that she may have a fascination with her own injuries because she started self-harming rather than the other way around, they've become a topic of interest to her and she shows them off. 

Or she may consider herself really good at handling physical pain and it makes her feel better about not being able to handle her emotional pain and wants to show that off. 

Or she feels compelled to self-harm independent of what attention she might get for it and figures she may as well get attention for the pain she goes through 

Or she doesn't feel like people empathize with her without her injuries and is asking for compassion in her own round about way. 

In short, there are a lot of reasons someone might self-harm and attention seeking may be part of it, but that doesn't mean someone's conscious motivation is manipulate *you.* They're just doing what they can to make their pain go away. I wish more people would stop worrying about someone's motivation to self-harm other than how that information can be used to help someone.

I ended up being transferred to another hospital where there were alas no oil pastels, but we were allowed pens (how I got to draw the octopus) which were banned in the hospital I did the two portraits in.

I've always hated pastels, but yeah for some reason being in the hospital completely changed my opinion on them. I hadn't used them since childhood either.

And yes you're correct that both of the portraits are in some way a self-portrait even if only one is labeled as such. They really were just overwhelmed scribbles of faces to get out emotion but I ended up liking how they came out. ",2016-02-10 02:25:50+00:00,czu9yjk,2.0,t1_czu8hul,2109.0,Art

323,"I can definitely relate. Its a really rough place to be when your life is arguably ""perfect"" (put in quotes because your life is obviously not perfect) but your brain for whatever reason won't react positively to it and you can't feel as inspired and renewed as you may have in years past.

Just know that no matter how ""perfect"" your life seems to you or others, your feelings are valid. You don't have to be happy about your life just because it seems good - to me it sounds like you've been through some serious things, and thats just from what you wrote here. I felt similarly and made myself feel numb instead of accepting that my anger at my family was valid and I wasn't an ungrateful bitch because of it. I have no idea if that is the case for you, but in case it helps, its okay to be angry at people who didn't mean to hurt you but did anyway. Allowing yourself negative reactions allows you to have that spectrum of emotion back, rather than just numbness.

That being said, mental health professionals can be way helpful for depression. Talk therapy and medication together can do really great things. Please take care of yourself, wishing the best for you.",2016-02-08 15:11:19+00:00,czs8qlv,1.0,t3_44q99o,19405.0,SuicideWatch

328,"For people who naturally have bouts of dissociation through psychosis or what-have-you, not sure that tripping is always a good idea. Just throwing that out there for other people with mental health issues like mine who feel oddly like a fuck up when people tell you that you are closed minded for not tripping. 

Glad psychadelics and dissociatives exist for people like /u/boinkface though because even though I wish I could control when my brain dissociates and when it doesn't, I'm glad I've had those experiences. Wholly agree with your post. People need to have some experience like that outside of sober or sane. ",2016-02-02 16:23:36+00:00,czl3opj,3.0,t1_czl0pl7,4767.0,news

331,"Totally agree. Thats why when I rolled it was great, was with a super understanding person who I felt comfortable with to be both incredibly silly and incredibly sad. I just know that during the comedown everything good can seem fake and you have to make sure you created the right environment to come down in. Like you said it's largely a matter of making sure you are with the right friends. 

I just worry sometimes that if I were to experience a come down with someone I've known for a long time it could ruin the friendship because I would remember things about our past or how I feel about them that I wouldn't be able to shake  -- totally unreasonable stuff but I've learned overtime that I don't have the most reasonable brain.

Sounds like a really good system you have though. Maybe in a more healthy mindset that would be a good system for me as well. ",2016-02-02 15:57:25+00:00,czl2nqx,6.0,t1_czl2cca,492.0,news

333,"Look, I really didn't mean to offend you, I just said what I said before to dissuade anyone who might want to kill themselves by letting them know there is a chance they can survive with horrible damage. I've tried a couple of methods and have some actual damage from them. I'm not talking out of my ass and if what I'm saying can dissuade someone from trying then I'm going to say it. 

Unfortunately, I tend to be willing to take (some of) those risks and it sounds like you are too. Hope you're doing okay so that you don't do anything like that. ",2016-02-02 15:36:43+00:00,czl1va0,12.0,t1_czl1mzz,378.0,news
334,"See what I posted to /u/feeling-better-yay. There are lots of things that can go wrong when you are ""under the gun"" so to speak - mainly nerves and a lack of planning due to the impulsivity of the act. Lots of people think these things wont get in the way of their attempt - some people are right and some people are wrong. There's no guaranteed suicide method because no one can accurately predict how they're going to act in a situation like that, that being said, 80 percent of people who successfully kill themselves had a previous attempt - but that doesn't mean its guaranteed if not for the reason that someone may find you while you're preparing/executing your chosen method.",2016-02-02 15:32:57+00:00,czl1qcm,10.0,t1_czl1beg,685.0,news

In a 100 percent perfect, clean world, yeah a gun would always kill you but in real life lots of things can get in the way from perfect execution (distasteful, lame pun kind of intended).

336,"I have high hopes for MDMA... it very much helped with my severe depression for about a month or so after rolling a couple of times. The only problem is that you have to be incredibly prepared, and preparing, for the comedown while you are still high. There are times that I would be worried someone who was doing a treatment with MDMA would experience a comedown that could leave them more depressed than before, or if they weren't supervised, killing themselves.

337,(kinda) fun fact: Anything that can kill you can always also leave you a drooling veggie. There is no guaranteed suicide method - generally the higher lethality (like a gun as you mentioned) the higher the likelihood is that if you survive you are looking at some serious permanent damage.,2016-02-02 15:13:54+00:00,czl11nj,8.0,t1_czl0h0t,1009.0,news
