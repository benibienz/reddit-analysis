the only reason why they get away with this shit is because they have a lot of oil

7,"you really think all soldiers join the army because their evil sociopaths ? 

you know a lot of people join because it's either that or living on the street 

some people need to go to college and the army is pretty much the place where you can get it for free (unless you count scholarships which can be hard to get unless you're a freaking genius) 

what about the soldiers during the vietnam draft?(or any draft for that mater) did they have a choice in joining ?",2015-09-27 20:08:04+00:00,cvg4hf3,6,t1_cva9eld,448334,socialism
