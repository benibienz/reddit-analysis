69,"It depends on how your team is set up, but TA (test associate) is mostly focused on execution of predetermined test cases, test tours, and scenarios along with adhoc and directed session based tests.   STE (software test engineers) author test cases, test tours, and scenarios along with attending project team meetings and standup. their roles aren't strictly execution. test engineers can also perform automation, scripting, and can analyze the information from crashes and logs to provide relevant data for more robust bugs and reports.  often times the engineers are made feature area owners so they work with dev to collect the appropriate requirements to become black box and sometimes white box experts for their owned areas through test specifications and the like. MS games is kind of a crapshoot because they often try to make senior Test Associates do the work of STEs and that's not ok but no one complains because you're likely a contractor and who cares, you can be replaced. That being said, testing at MS is great for learning the ropes but these days getting out of that TA tier depends on your drive and ability to play the social game more so than raw ability. I've seen great testers never progress past the TA role even though they find great bugs because they just are lumps when it comes to everything else.  I've seen STEs just sit idle in their careers because they aren't willing to step up their game and go for those analyst and leadership roles or they never leave a team to learn other areas of the company's larger program. testing windows phone 6.0 was a far cry from working on Halo but it definitely opened my world up to more methods and people to network with.

71,"Honestly dude (or dudette), the best thing you can do is hit up agencies like TekSystems and Volt and tell them you want to explore TA roles at Microsoft in the game studios.  Get yourself a copy of Exploratory Testing by James Whittaker. Read up and do some practice interviews. Most of the folks hiring there are looking for passion for gaming and the ability to learn.  Write a really good resume that is not a cookie cutter format. Name the file something to set you apart from all the other firstnamelastname.doc's they'll be slogging through. I named my resume achemejedidadisgreatattestingyourshouldhirehim.doc for the most recent round of job searching I did and several recruiters specifically called out that my use of a nonstandard format and file name bubbled me up for jobs.  google a few resume dos and donts articles and read up. if you are truly passionate about testing, your biggest hurdle is just getting into the interview. Your unique, non-cookie cutter resume goes a long way.  If you want to not commute and explore things in the city, it's a bit more challenging and you compromise.  Do you want to work on garbage mobile games and not commute? Big Fish is ALWAYS hiring testers.  Use this time while you're young to work that overtime and do those silly 70 hour weeks with time and a half.  If you do game testing for life, focus on where you want to go. PM, Producer, managment, etc. Don't just be a tester forever. Strive to get out of those Test associate roles and into those Test Engineer roles and beyond.

169,"one of the parents should have a cell phone. they just need to make a google voice account and show the kids how to use it on the computer, then they can receive incoming calls and make outgoing calls as needed for free. the one caveat is that google voice, you can't dial 911.

174,"I was using agenda more as an action item list rather than sensationalized headline. you know like step 1. show viewer pride flags. step 2. show viewer intolerance is bad. step 3. hiding it is bad. etc.  I guess being in a progressive part of the USA, i often forget intolerance is a big issue for a lot of folks still. It's all good Bonjouratous, cheers to you for remaining passionate and civil at the same time. Uncommon sight to see around here. ",2015-06-18 04:43:43+00:00,csae5p9,11.0,t1_csab5ly,6258,scifi
175,"I do appreciate where you are coming from. Different folks have different feelings about the world and you are totally entitled to your opinion. Sorry if that came across to you as gay hate or homophobia.  In the circle of friends we watched this with, several people took issue with the over-the-top and brazen approach. Gay people included.

176,you are incorrect in your assumption. plenty of entertainment portrays LGBT folks much better without shoving the sounding board down your throat. you seem to be confusing my distaste for shitty writing with people. ,2015-06-18 02:12:19+00:00,csa9oj8,7.0,t1_csa99oq,795,scifi

179,"No. I don't complain about gay agendas in other programs that feature people with different sexual preferences. Just over-compensating ones with Sayid in them. 

How is the new Entourage? I thought it kind of strange to make a movie about a show that was cancelled a few years ago. I don't know that I would pay money to watch a movie version of it. ",2015-06-18 01:17:59+00:00,csa80vy,3.0,t1_csa523s,5785,scifi
180,"Two episodes into Sense 8 and I am like, damn, can you stop beating me over the head with the LGBT agenda already? We get it, one of the wachowski's is proud to be a trans. Treating people differently based on their gender and sexual preference is bad. Hiding it is also bad.

Maybe I'll give EP3 a shot since it sounds like it stops being so preachy and starts with the scifi.

But hey, if you ever wanted to see [spoiler](/s ""one of the Doctor's companions fuck a transwoman with a strap-on""), this is right up your alley.",2015-06-17 19:44:47+00:00,cs9wlb9,1.0,t3_3a5gga,30458,scifi
