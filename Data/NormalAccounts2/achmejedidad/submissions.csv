However, even though I insisted I'd be in to clear the file, I went in last week and the owner had sold variants and limited issues like BTTF out of my file.

Since I am not doing business there anymore, I am now stuck without any of my books Jan 5-last week.  I have a massive list of stuff and I am looking for a recommended online shop I can submit the list to and hopefully get most of the issues i've missed still.

This is my 2012 build.  It worked great for awhile but the Video card fried last year, been getting by with onboard since I've just been playing WOW on PC. Would like to play Ark but don't want to build a new machine. I'd like to stream to my Xbox One. I think I just need a few video card recommendations.
