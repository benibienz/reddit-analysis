&gt; *If you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand).* 

Terrortop's summon does not start a chain. We know this, since in the relevant lines of text there's neither a semicolon or a colon. If you want to know whether or not an effect starts a chain, look for these two little characters. When the summoning condition does not use the chain you have no opportunity to chain to it (makes sense!). A few examples: 

&gt; *If you control no Spell/Trap Cards: You can Special Summon this card from your hand.* (typical BA clause)

Colon? Check. Maxx C possible? Check.

&gt; *If your opponent controls a monster and you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand).* (Cyber Dragon)

No (semi)colons, no chaining of maxx c.

&gt; *You can send 1 other LIGHT monster from your hand to the Graveyard; Special Summon this card from your hand in Defense Position.* (Galaxy Soldier)

59,"Congrats for the invite! 

I'm judging myself and sadly this issue comes up quite a lot in recent times - **however** it's the first time I've seen a judge rule in favor of a re-roll.

Neither the policy documents nor the rulebook do even state that both players have to agree on a random method (this is only specifically mentioned when determining who goes first).

You could also argue by using the card text: 

&gt; [...] **your opponent** randomly picks 1 [...]

And you did that. Meaning that as long as the method was sufficiently random there should have been no problem (even though it wasn't communicated correctly - which, to be clear, you should have been doing a better job at).

 The last few times I saw this come up at recent events it either ended with

***a)*** the judge dismissing a re-roll **or**

***b)*** the judge dismissing a re-roll and giving a UC-minor for rule-sharking

Apart from that - I don't know. Eyeballing the proportions is a thing that comes with practice but that doesn't mean that I don't mess it up when I draw 3 minute portraits with weird angles or so. When starting off you make nearly every mistake possible, I personally just try really hard not to make mistakes twice, or three times, or even four times. There's still things I struggle with, for example drawing teeth in these quick sketches. For me it's super difficult to not make them look completely crooked in such a small timespan.

&gt; Did you find it hard transferring to digital?

This is more or less the first really time consuming thing I have done digitally. Ive drawn some smaller things in the past (for example there was a thread called ""draw your favorite card in mspaint"", so I decided to contribute something there. I liked it, so I decided to pick up mspaint again). 
It actually was a really calming and relaxing experience. I don't mind spending a lot of time on one particular drawing and the only immediate difference I noticed was that I had to draw really, really slowly.

&gt;  The foil, air mass, and packing are not consistent so there is always a margin of error you're working with [...]

That's also the reason why it wasn't really possible to scale for ultimate rares before even though they were a little bit lighter than other cards: they were not light enough to make sure if it wasn't just because of pack weight inconsistencies.

It's simply no longer possible to determine which packs continue better cards via scaling.

118,"That depends on what kind of interruption we're talking about here.

The really great thing about neptabyss is that it's

* a immediate +2 if it goes through

* a super heavy OTK and combo enabler

* BUT it also is a great card to bait out backrow.

The main traps played after bosh are vanity's and the solemn cards. None of which do any harm to neptabyss, because he's great at baiting them out. Let's say your opponent has a set Solemn Notice.

You summon Neptabyss and activate its effect sending Dragoons. That leaves your opponent in a bit of a dilemma: If he negates Neptabyss, you're just going to get the Dragoons search anyways. If he negates Dragoons you're going to get the Nepta search. 

If you have a full combo in hand you can just use nepta to send marksman which your opponent will have to answer with notice (because if he wouldn't, marksman would destroy notice and you'd get another free plus).

It only really becomes tricky when you're dealing with multiple backrow, but if you have a decent hand you can play around most threats. For example you can always bait a backrow with an instant fusion play - either getting back Dragoons (threatening a plus by detaching it from a water xyz or getting out a card that removes one of their threats, eg Castel) or getting back a card like Abysspike. Even though Pike's effect is negated you can still pay the cost to discard an Atlantean.

119,"Another really popular first turn combo with Diva is:

* Diva summons Neptabyss
* Neptabyass sends Dragoons and searches Marksman
* Dragoons searches for Mouli
* Diva + Nepta -&gt; Tatsunoko
* Tatsunoko + Marksman in Hand -&gt; Dewloren
* Summon Moulinglacia
* Activate Dewloren to bounce Mouli back for next turn
* Leaving you with: Dragoons, Marksman, Tatsunoko, Diva, Neptabyss in Grave, Dewloren on board and 3 cards + Mouli in hand (if you started with 5 cards) - Counting in the two cards your opponent lost you're now at a +2.
* This play is very good if you're holding on to an instant fusion, because you always have to anticipate your opponent getting rid of Dewloren, therefore leaving you with 6 waters in grave. Norden however can get you one back, enabling your second Mouli drop. If your opponent can't get over Dewloren, even better: You just drop Mouli and give it back once again as soon as youre done. Dewloren also bounces cards like your abyss-scale, abyss-sphere or even vanity's.

---

The combo you mentioned leaves you with Tatsunoko, Megalo, Mouli and 4 cards in hand. Counting in the two cards your opponent lost you're now at a +4. 

* Usually you want to follow up with Megalo + Tatsunoko -&gt; Leo, leaving you with a slightly more secure board.

* This play has some advantages and disadvantages: It leaves you with more immediate plus and a potentially better board (Leo can be tricky for some decks) but also with more risk: When your board gets wiped, all you have for your next turn are 5 cards in hand and both your dragoons are already in grave, so it's really difficult to get to another Megalo if you don't have one.

* As you guys know, in today's/post-BOSH meta you always have to anticipate your opponent getting rid of every monster you have on board and a board-wipe is probably gonna happen, especially since most decks have maindecked outs for Dark Destroyer, most of which also work against Leo.

Another thing I want to bring up is the abyss-scale. You may want to switch to Cetus after Bosh. Mizuchi does nothing against pendulum decks and gets disabled for no compensation.

___

&gt;Can you help me find my first *real* deck?

Sure, that's why I'm here!

&gt;What do you think of buying 2 Synchron Extremes and build a core deck out of that?

Generally building decks from structure decks is a very good idea to get a decent deck for a low price, *however* you should get three structure decks. Most of the times you need certain things as 3-ofs. 

Synchron Extreme is a good choice, but I'm not sure if building a Quickdraw-Synchron-Type deck is the best idea for a beginner - these decks are known to take quite a lot of skill and general game knowledge. 
That's because you have a looot of options and of course you always want to make the best move - determining which move/combo is the best however - is very difficult. Other structure decks you may want to consider are:

* Geargia Rampage

* Hero's Strike

* **Master of Pendulum** (!) - releases in a few days

&gt;What do you think of incorporating the Winged Dragon of Ra + Sphere mode into any deck (I don't mind experimenting; I want to have fun)?

I personally am a competitve player and am not too found of ideas like this - but feel free to just try it for yourself! If it works for you and it turns out to be a strategy that wins you games, go with it! The main issue with these cards is: They're inconsistent. The board needs to be in a very specific state for you to be able to play these cards - and if it isn't, you're holding on to dead cards in your hands.

&gt;I can get the 2014 Mega-tins for a good price. Is it worth buying one?

The Mega-Tins have lots of good cards and it's very fun to open them. However - as with all yugioh products: It's seldom really ""worth"" to open them to get value and make profit. However, if you want to build a collection, the Mega-Tins are a very fine choice, since they have quite a few meta-relevant cards in 'em (e.g. tellarknights and Yang Zings, both of which are very strong decks if built properly!)

&gt;Any booster packs/structure decks/tins for my collection/new deck?

Generally you should always stick to the newer products. The newer cards are always ""hot"" and always somewhat competitive. There's a good chance you'll find a deck or archetype in the newer sets that you like - and even if you don't you can jst trade the cards you pulled for the things you actually want (as I said, the newer cards are ""hot"", so it will be easy to trade them for other stuff)

___

So, now let's take a look at decks (apart from ones built from structure decks) you may want to build:

* Constellars - you have a few of their cards and that might be a nice base for a deck. Constellars focus on Rank 4 and Rank 5 xyz summons and they can be very fun. Their main deck is pretty budget friendly, but as with most decks, their extra deck isn't really.

* Tellarknights - a super strong contender. They are a little pricey though.

* Deskbots - my personal suggestion. They're a super strong deck that can compete with basically everything right now if played properly. And what's the best part about them? You can get the deck core (all the main monsters + 3 machine duplications)... for less than 2 bucks. You should also get a naturia beast and some other extra deck cards, but it's not going to get any cheaper.

217,"Well, I don't know what you'd consider as ""pricey"", but I guess madolche falls more into the ""budget"" category.

Actually, with the newer meta Madolches got a little bit of a boost since they're one of only a few decks that have cards that inherently work against the meta. Well, when I say ""the meta"", I'm specifically talking about Kozmo (probably the most dominant deck for a little while) and Majespecter (also Tier 1/1.5). Majespecter's can't be targeted or destroyed by card effects (that means they're basically ""hexproof"", har har xD) while Kozmos can't be targeted either and when destroyed just float into other big beaters. You probably see why that's good for madolche since their bossmonster tiaramisu neither targets nor destroys. 

Uhm, for staying up-to-date I really recommend r/yugioh and [the org](http://ygorganization.com/). There's also quite a few youtubers out there that have informative content about what's going on in the meta, the well known probably being lithium2300, azneyeswhitedragon and MegaCapitalG.

Uhm. Which decks are actually good right now? That's an interesting question, because you picked a time to get into the game right after a new banlist got announced. Basically a new format is just about to begin. IMO it's gonna be something like this:

Tier 1:

* Kozmo (really heavy otk potential and untargetable boss monsters that float.)

Tier 1.5:

* Majespecter variants (untargetable, indestructible, really strong themed traps/spells)

* Performage variants (rank4 xyz spam and abuse of the pendulum mechanic)

* Satellarknights (generates a lot of advantage and focuses on rank4 plays with strong bossmonsters)

Other strong contenders:

* Yang Zing (inherently good matchup against Kozmo since they're the definition of a deck with floating monsters - everything floats)

* Burning Abyss (they're a spam deck of level 3 dark fiend-type monsters with a lot of floating abilitys and a heavy trap line up)

For the sake of information here are my two cents about the other strong decks according to yugiohtopdecks and tell you why they're not as viable anymore with the new cards and the updated banlist:

* Nekroz (they're a ritual based archetype and every monster is also a handtrap. they dominated the meta for the last year or so. they got hit really hard on the last list and to keep relevant they'd have to change their playstyle completely.)

* Shaddoll (flip monsters and fusions. they try to mill cards to get effects. their bossmonster got hit)

* Qliphort (probably still a strong contender, but their bossmonster also got hit because it was super OP and their main searcher got limited which comes with a huge decrease in consistency)

* Infernoid (probably a strong contender. they mill themselves to the graveyard and then banish themselves from there to special summon themselves. their monsters are super strong and have good effects. they're definitely viable.)

* HERO ({{Masked HERO Dark Law}} is a stupid card and shuts some decks down completely.)

* Volcanic (mostly used as an engine. theyre fire monsters that manipulate the graveyard.)

* Yosenju (the normal summon deck. they don't special summon at all (except if they're going for a rank4 play) and therefore can afford to run super antimeta cards like {{Lose 1 turn}}. however they dont really have non target removal and are relatively outclassed IMO)

Uhm, regarding tips for your deck.. Uh.. I guess if you settle with madolche for the start, you want to keep in mind that the deck is heavily combo based and therefore weak to any kind of disruption. Therefore run cards like {{Trap Stun}}, {{Royal Decree}} or even {{Wiretap}}. Handtraps like Maxx C, Effect Veiler or DD Crow are exceptionally strong in this deck, since you can discard them to have resources for your hootcake. 

Uhm, yeah, if you have any questions left, just ask.

218,"When you summon Tiger Dragon and you choose to activate it's effect, you target up to two facedown spells/traps your opponent controls. ~~Keep in mind, that if your opponent only controls 1 you can't even activate the effect.~~ (/edit: I somehow got the card text wrong.) Notice the semicolon(;) in Tiger Dragons text? That means that everything before it has to be done at activation. 

So, you summon Tiger Dragon and activate it's effect to target two cards of your opponent. Since Tiger Dragon is a Spellspeed 1 effect, your opponent can now chain to it with spellspeed 2 or higher effects (quick-spells, traps, ...). That means, that if you targeted two of your opponents trap cards, lets say {{Bottomless Trap Hole}} and {{Ordeal of a Traveler}}, he can chain them. So, let's say your opponent activates Bottomless Trap Hole as Chain Link 2 and Ordeal of a Traveler as Chain Link 3.

Now let's resolve the chain backwards as usual. Ordeal of a Traveler is now active. Bottomless Trap Hole now resolves and destroys and banishes your Tiger Dragon. Now Tiger Dragon resolves, but ""oh!"", let's read it's text again.

""You can target up to 2 face-down Spell/Trap Cards your opponent controls; destroy those targets.""

Do you see how the requirement says ""facedown"" and after the semicolon it still specifys ""those targets""? That means, if the targets no longer meet the specifications, they're not destroyed. In that case Ordeal of Traveler would stay faceup on the field (since it's no longer facedown) and bottomless would go to the graveyard, as traps usually do after they successfully resolved.

TL;DR: Yes, your opponent can chain Spellspeed 2 effects to your effect. If one of the cards targeted is chained, it's not destroyed, since it's no longer facedown. You cannot switch your target to other cards now, since you already targeted at activation.",2015-11-10 06:29:14+00:00,cwv309f,2,t1_cwv1uie,3006,yugioh

220,"Prophecy got a little bit of their power back since on the most recent banlist Fate got restored to 3 (even though you'd probably want to run only 2 anyways). I myself am not a very enthustiastic prophecy player but I have friends who are/were, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.

In general, what I can say is: Probably the best pure variant is still 3x priestess, 3x blue boy, 3x Justice. You can always switch to Temperance and world (1 world, two high priestess). You could also try Shaddoll Spellbooks (they're all spellcaster and winda + fate is a heav lockdown. in close situations fate also let's you reuse some of your shaddolls flip effects), however I'm not sure about how viable of an idea that would be, considering Shaddoll's boss monster got banned (El-shaddoll construct).

For monsters I can really recommend Kycoo. He's really good against certain decks (e.g. Kozmo).

A really fun idea might be Majespecter Spellbooks (they're all spellcasters too, woohoo!). That would also fix most of your trap problems since they come with a lot of really good themed backrow (-&gt; {{Majespecter Tempest}}!)

Somehow the reaper of prophecy variant gained a lot of popularity lately. It uses cards like the fool and reasoning to have a lot of OTK power. I'm quite sceptical about it.

Trap wise, I suggest you keep the amount of targeting and destruction based cards low, since neither targeting nor destroying are really good in todays meta (majespecter/kozmo . . .). That's also one of the main reasons why I think the Priestess variant is atm better than the world variant, since the world variant usually runs discard-traps that target. I'd probably run the usual staples: Vanity's emptiness, bottomless trap hole, torrential tribute, solemn warning. If you need effect negation I'd go with breakthrough skill. If you feel like you need battle traps, don't run mirror force but storming mirror force.

I'm not really sure about the clown engine. Yeah, it's a really really strong engine that utilizes rank 4 plays for days, but I'm not sure if splashing a rank 4 engine into every deck is a good idea (well, if you play kycoo, you probably have enough rank 4s for a viable engine.. hm.). Most important cards are damage juggler, trick clown and hattricker. 

If you're settling on something pendulum based you might try out {{Magical Abductor}}. In a spellbook deck she could search out your pendulum engine with ease. Well, and uh.. For her monster effect, I'm not really sure, but I guess she serches fool and effect veiler.
