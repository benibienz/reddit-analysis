Ich bin ein engagierter Sammelkartenspieler und hab vor kurzem mit 'nem Ami Karten getauscht. Von ihm hab ich 'n riesiges Paket voller Karten bekommen - plus 100$ Cash in besagtem Paket.

Jedenfalls hat der Zoll das einkassiert (kein großes Drama). Ich frage mich jetzt, ob ich auf die 100$ Cash nun noch Zoll nachzahlen muss (auf die Sammelkarten brauch ich das erfahrungsgemäß nämlich nicht). Wäre toll, falls mir jemand weiterhelfen könnte :)",FragReddit,Muss man auf Bargeld Zoll zahlen?

* Hideo Kojima's most recent game *Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain* won an award for ""Best Action Adventure""

* Hideo (who was vice president of Konami for quite some time) recently had some disagreements with Konami and is leaving their development team soon

* Konami banned him from picking up the award for his own game (they allegedly threatened to sue him)

* the gaming community is outraged

Some comments from relevant reddit threads:

&gt; I've decided I'm not going to buy any more of their games, this is beyond dirty and they don't deserve my money. [...]

&gt; FUCKONAMI

&gt; /r/yugioh has always disliked konami but this takes the cake.

&gt; Hey EA lost the worst company award. Guess who won? YOU WON!!!

---
&gt; I'm not going to buy any more stuff from them, be it console games, be it yugioh cards (and I was a tournament player until now) or be it their stupid slot machines.

And so on and so forth. 

I thought that the yugioh community probably has a good chance of ""exploiting"" this situation and put more pressure on Konami (by e.g. demanding that Konami at least makes transparent announcements and explanations regarding the TCG banlist or make transparent efforts to at least balance the game a little bit better) because atm a majority of players feel like Konami is just seeing them as a way to make profit.

Maybe we could organize something, and if it's just something small like a little petition or even a *""When you don't fix something, we may not be attending your next sneak peek.""*

I'm not trying to invoke some kind of boycott - we all know that would be counter productive. It's just that yugioh players have been complaining for a long time but no one is really making an effort to change something.

I really hope the author got something mixed up and it was a Pendulum Summon, otherwise someone at that desk was sleeping xD

{{Summoned Lord Exodia}}

{{Exod Flame}}

Both of them are quite good in my opinion. **Summoned Lord Exodia** acts as an alternative win condition for exodia decks since it's a nice beater thats unaffected by everything. It also searches your pieces back from the grave, and when destroyed let's you draw quite a bit. 

However, IMO **Exod Flame** seems like it's the real MVP here. It sends your pieces to the grave - where they're much easier to get to - while also getting rid of problem monsters. Even better, when your opponent finally destroys it you can add one of your pieces or even **Summoned Lord Exodia** back.

At this point, I suggest you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPIStmPL8A8) to see how these cards work as an engine.

Now, to the actual point of this post. I feel like this theme is worthy to be more than just a random splashable engine. There's quite a few cards you could throw together to make this somewhat of a viable (pendulum based) deck. I'm going to list a few of the obvious contenders:

* {{Magical Abductor}} : Is nice if you're heading for a pendulum engine, especially since exodia decks generally play a lot of spells anyways. The funny part about this though **is the monster effect** which lets you search exodia pieces, since 4/5 are lv1 spellcasters. Notably, it also  searches effect veiler and droll &amp; lock bird, both of them probably being good counters against EmEm/PePe.
* {{Dark Factory of Mass Production}} : Gets your pieces back from the grave.
* {{Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer}} : Works exceptionally well with Magical Abductor.

I'm not too sure about other cards we ould use to make this a ""good"" deck, so let's get some suggestions and discussions going!
