That right there speaks volumes. You NEVER have to keep toxic people in your life just because you're related to them. 

You know that saying about blood and water? Well, the full quote is actually ""the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb."" Yep. Means the exact opposite of how people use it. 

My dad straight up told me that he never wanted me. And he ended up marrying an emotionally abusive psychopath. I've pretty much written him off and only deal with seeing him once or twice a year at holidays. I do still feel that intrinsic need for him to be the parent I needed, but those feelings have died down quite a bit over time. 

It's always going to hurt a bit, but eventually you'll reach a point that you accept that they'll never be who you need them to be. 

Go out in to the world and make your own family out of your friends. You may end up with some people who you can look up to as parental figures. I'm supremely lucky in that regard. My neighbors have become another set of parents to me and it has made it easier to deal with my own biological parents. ",2016-08-02 14:29:20+00:00,d611dm1,1.0,t3_4vsgs1,3060.0,AskTrollX

146,"CW: Food talk and child abuse. 

My dad's wife didn't believe that children needed three meals a day, would commonly refuse to buy breakfast food, and would forbid any snacking at all. Add in the fact that she couldn't bloody cook and you have children that regularly went hungry. She would also like to point out that I was a fat ass and should barely be eating anything. (Did I mention she was a nursing student? One that took 10 years to do a 2 year program...) We only had to put up with them every Tuesday and every other weekend, but it was still enough to fuck my sister and I up. 

I ended up with a sort of food aggression thing similar to a dog. I would get upset if anyone's portions weren't even or if anyone took food off of my plate. I would have to try and sneak food for my little sister and I as often as possible when we were there.  Eating became a comfort thing, but I would feel so guilty, even after I cut them out of my life. I ended up regularly sneaking food into the bathroom to eat at home (mom's house). And I would refuse to eat when I felt like I needed to be punished. 

I'm better about the food aggression now. And you better damn well believe I learned how to cook amazing foods. Which I regularly share with a bunch of my friends because I don't ever want anyone around me to go hungry. 

I'm far from happy and healthy, though. Anxiety, depression, and some residual anger issues. We won't even get into the self-esteem issues I have from both parents. But I will say that I have an amazing husband who understands my issues and has been helping me through them for the past decade.

We just celebrated our 10 year anniversary in February and our 5 year wedding anniversary is coming up next month. We are still both very happy and very much in love. He compliments me all the time because he learned that's something I need. He's also super affectionate and we are always hugging each other or giving each other a quick kiss or grabbing each other's butts (that's super important to daily life!). He's also missed work to stay home and take care of me after I've had a night of severe panic attacks that have kept us both awake. He's a great guy and takes amazing care of me. 

We didn't start out this way, though. We've had our bumps and there have been times when I didn't think we'd work. But we learned and adapted. Our relationship is still strong because as we grew and changed, so did the relationship.

One was his previous crush. I graduated in the same class as her little sister. While I like her sister well enough, ex-crush is just weird with a mean streak. She's hyper religious (dad's a minister, mom's a christian author) and from what I've been told by the people she has said it to, she went about the school and told various kids that they were going to hell. 

I don't think much about her, though I occasionally do wonder what my husband's life would have been like if he ended up with her. Especially seeing as she's still hyper religious and in the army, while my husband is a liberal atheist with a side of pacifism. 

The other girl was the person my husband emotionally cheated on me with. Whenever I think about her, I still get the fear and loathing feelings. She was trying to use my husband as a rebound when she was taking a break from her now-husband. Even though she knew my husband was seeing someone. 

I mean, this was clear back in the first two or three years of our relationship. We're celebrating our 10 year dating anniversary this Friday. I suppose it's time to let those feelings go. ",2016-02-17 18:15:12+00:00,d03gc1g,1.0,t3_465q75,60946.0,AskTrollX

He's so focused on making up for lost time and always is researching. Astronomy seems to be his passion now. 

He's also incredibly dedicated to his secular human values. He was anti-LGBT before. He looked down at anyone that was outside his church's doctrine. He almost didn't start dating me simply because I wasn't baptized. He's done a complete 180 and is always looking for ways to help out whoever he can. He's incredibly supportive of LGBT and minority groups.

258,"Our's is pretty pathetic. 

I met my husband the summer before my freshman year of high school. He would be entering his senior year. We were both in marching band and I found out that he was the ex-boyfriend of my best friend at the time's sister. They had only dated for like a month and had no physical contact whatsoever. He was a supremely religious person, but super sweet.

I was infatuated with him and wrote him a note about 4 months down the road, offering to be his girlfriend in name only. I quickly backed up after giving it to him and said that someone else made me write it. 

We became best friends over that year and I even tried to help him get with another girl, but it never went anywhere. My family adored him, though, and he was the only teenager I was ever allowed to ride in a car with. 

He went off to college almost an hour away, but we remained close. I dated someone else for about 4ish months before I was really honest with myself and realized that I was totally, truly, deeply in love with him. So, I broke up with the other guy and decided to start pursuing my friend full time. 

He came over to my house for New Year's Eve that year, along with some of my other friends. We sat on a love seat together and he leaned against me almost the whole night. 

In January, I was supposed to go to homecoming with some friends, but drama happened and instead ended up going out to dinner with my parents, my best friend, and another one of my friends. My bestie did the whole leaning on me again. He also kept putting his hand over mine. When we got back to the house, we decided to watch Phantom of the Opera and he held my hand. But he left soon after because he had a curfew. 

On February 12th, I had a band concert and he came down to watch. When we got back to the house, we tried to finish the movie. We laid on my bed and held hands the entire time. We also cuddled in the back seat of the car when we took him back to university. That night, we admitted that we liked each other, but we weren't sure how to proceed. Remember that extremely religious part? Yeah, his parents didn't want him with me even though I had started going to youth group with him to make them happy. 

I went up to stay with him for the day the following Saturday. More cuddling. The next day, I asked him what we were. He said that we were dating and that was that. 

Cue a complete world view change (both extremely liberal atheists now), a discovery of me being bisexual, and that polyamoury is a good fit for our relationship. We own a home, we're raising my little sister, and are still completely, stupidly in love with one another. We'll be celebrating our 10 year anniversary next month and our 5 year wedding anniversary in May. We are both completely different people from where we started, but we've stuck together through it all. I think we turned out alright. :) ",2016-01-18 15:26:30+00:00,cz2r2w2,1.0,t3_41hvxr,29278.0,TrollXChromosomes

I, being the insane person that I am, decided that I ***HAD*** to make myself a lace shawl to wear to my husband's 10 year class reunion. In 2 weeks. In the middle of Christmas knitting. And I am not a fast knitter.

But, somehow, I got it done! Early, in fact! And I'm still on track for getting all of my Christmas presents done. The wool gods have blessed me mightily.

I've been doing this since my mom was pregnant with me. A bunch of people basically have what amounts to a week or weekend of drinking, socializing, and historical re-enactment. 

A lot of the campers sell their historical wares to the public that comes in. Some people (like me and my husband) aren't trying to make any money. We just do it for the fun and for the family. I have quite a few relatives that also go to rendezvous (ron-day-voo, for those who may not have encountered this word before). 

For most of the day, the public breezes in and out, taking pictures of all of us in our finery and asking questions. They buy trinkets and food and then leave. 

The real fun starts, though, after the public is gone. Then, the lanterns are lit, people go visiting, the instruments come out at certain camps, and you are completely serenaded by the low rumble of voices, bursts of laughter, and the most heart-wrenchingly sweet music you've ever heard. There are no sounds of cars rushing by, no glares from from electric lighting, and the stars, oh the stars! You can see so much beautiful night sky. It's breathtaking. My husband and I joke that we don't sneak off for adult activities, we sneak off to stargaze.

It's an amazingly fun time, but it is an expensive hobby. You're looking at $800+ just for the tent. Then you add in a fly, ropes and stakes, all of your furniture that has to be as historically accurate as possible, clothing to match... it adds up fast. The only reason why my husband and I can do it at all is because my grandparents seem to have a canvas addiction and own three tents, plus my family gives us their old stuff or makes us things for holidays.

All in all, though, I absolutely adore doing it. And I can't wait until I have some children of my own to introduce them to it. :D",2015-10-27 15:00:42+00:00,cwemsm2,4.0,t1_cwelw38,1400.0,weddingplanning

I rescued her from falling in a storm drain when she was only 6 weeks-ish old. That was last September. She was so tiny she could fit on my shoulder. 

I don't think she was quite ready to be away from mom because she completely latched on to me and follows me everywhere about the house. She knows her name, too, and if I yell for her, she'll usually come running. She also likes to jump from our tall window on to my shoulder and ride there like I'm her own personal carriage.

540,"I'm sorry you feel like that. But look at this way: if someone posts a picture of their pet, it leads to everyone posting a picture of their pets. Which leads to all the top posts of the subreddit (so usually the entire front page) being nothing but pet pictures. When stuff like this happens, actual crochet posts are largely ignored, and sometimes even downvoted. We've seen this happen mutiple times with various topics. So we try to keep the subreddit relevant, which means some posting rules. 

If anyone is confused by them, here's the schedule: Finished Objects, questions, discussion topics, and crochet related news items are welcome to be posted every day of the week. 

WIP posts are generally restricted to Wednesday. We're not going to be upset if you miss the day by a few hours, but please don't post on a Monday, claiming that you can't wait 2 more days. 

You're allowed to promote your etsy shops, etc. on Tuesday's Buy/Sell/Trade/Promote post. A lot of craft subreddits won't let you promote at all, which we don't agree with. But we also don't want a bunch of shop posts flooding the subreddit, hence why we have this thread every week. 

If people want to dicuss how to run their shops, they're welcome to do so on Saturday's thread. 

Stash pictures are welcome on Sunday's Stash Flash thread. 

And, obviously, Fursday Friends is posted every Thursday. 

Everything is located in the sidebar, including links to all of the threads. I do my best to keep them up to date, but I'm only human. I have a life outside of reddit that occasionally demands my attention and sometimes can't update every day. And as dickschlapperXVI will tell you, it's a pain in the ass to try and update and fiddle with things from mobile devices. 

I do hope you change your mind and post your work. We're all interested in seeing it.

Sister 1 is a 13 year old human rogue assassin who was taken in by a dwarven baker. The baker is a member of an assassin guild and specializes in poisoned baked goods. He's been teaching my sister's character everything he knows. He also wears a frilly pink apron.

Sister 2 is a elven druid who was raised by gay werewolf parents. Yes, werewolves are actually civilized in my world. 

Husband is a human ranger raised in the woods by nomadic monks. He has a pet hawk he has raised from birth. He also has mysterious origins that we're going to be exploring soon. (Hi, honey! I know you'll be reading this! :D)

Besty 1 is a elven cleric and my character's half-sister. They don't know this yet, though. Her character was raised by hobbits, so she refuses to wear armor on her feet and automatically ducks walking into any structure.

Besty 2 is a dwarven bard. She also has some mysterious origins that will be coming out soon. She's trying to regain something precious that she lost.",2015-07-16 03:49:20+00:00,ct4zhyc,4.0,t1_ct4wm7a,5343.0,AskTrollX

So he wants to see his maternal grandma as much as possible, as do I. She just turned 101. Realistically, she's probably not going to live another 5 years. She's important enough to both of us to go for holidays, even if we have to deal with the bad people. 

And there are some family members who don't hate us. Actually, I'd be so bold to say they like us. But 5 people out of 50+ isn't enough to make me feel welcome. 

So, we'll keep going as long as grandma is around. And I'll just keep a smile plastered on my face until I can get in the car and unleash the stream of swearing that I've held in throughout the visit. Haha.

632,"I wish I had done it sooner. Though to be fair, I severely underestimated just how ridiculously stupid and cruel my mil's family can be. 

I posted the annual Cyanide &amp; Happiness Zombie Jesus Day comic *on my own facebook wall*. I did not call anyone out, I did not make any remarks. Just posted because it made me laugh. Didn't think about it again, really. 

His family *blew up*. Saying all these horrible things about me and telling my husband that he basically married Satan's handmaiden. They purposefully ruined our wedding because of this. And the majority of them still won't talk to me (aside from snide remarks just out of earshot), 4 years later. 

And this wasn't before they got to know me, mind you. My husband and I had been together for 5 years already and were engaged. I had been to countless family gatherings by this point. 

I want to say it doesn't effect me, but when you have to go sit out in the garage by yourself during Christmas dinner just so you can have a moment where no one glares at you, it can wear you down. I also have terrible panic attacks even thinking about seeing them. 

And now one of the worst offenders is pregnant, which hurts me because my husband and I want nothing more than to have our own child, but are waiting until we are in a better financial situation. I know this person is going to rub it in our face. We aren't good, god fearin' catholics because we don't have 10 children running around already. Also because we're atheists, but that's besides the point. 

Oh, yeah, they claim that I am the one who damned my husband to hell because I led him out of christianity. In reality, it was the other way around. But they don't want to see me as anything other than a villan. 

I try and be as polite as possible when I'm forced into going over. They can't ever do the same. And not going isn't an option, because I am my husband's only ally there. Though, like I said, since I'm the evil one, most of them will talk to him. 

I guess I also keep going because I want to stand my ground. I'm my husband's partner. I'm not going anywhere. And you can't bully him into leaving me. 

Needless to say, after that fiasco, I did what I refer to as 'the great purge' on facebook. Went from 300+ people down to 50. I've only added about 20 people in these last 4 years. 

We're also planning our great revenge. Next year we're doing a vow renewal and having the wedding we really wanted. And we're only inviting the people we want to be there. :)
