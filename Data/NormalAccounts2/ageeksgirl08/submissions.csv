I saw a family walking around carrying 2 female bettas and a 1 gallon plastic container. I stopped them and told them that if they put those fish in that container, they would end up miserable and dying younger than they should. They said that the clerk at the fish counter told them 2 females are fine together. I said that she was wrong and reiterated that bettas need room to swim, and a heated, filtered tank. Mind you, I wasn't being snotty. I spoke in a calm and polite manner. They got mad at me and said that they weren't willing to spend money on aquariums for the ""stupid fish"" and they didn't care if they died. They walked away from me at that point.

I was so frustrated that I was practically in tears. I wouldn't even go near the checkout line until they were gone. I told the cashier about them and will also be contacting the manager of the store (who happens to be my husband's cousin). But it still hurt knowing that those 2 beautiful fish were going to a home where they were just seen as a disposable toy for the kids. :(",bettafish,[Rant] Stupid people and stupid pet store worker.,http://www.reddit.com/r/bettafish/comments/3hg6k7/rant_stupid_people_and_stupid_pet_store_worker/

Our original wedding was not everything we dreamed of. Certain family members went out of their way to ruin it. Also, my MIL took over and invited people who had no business of being there, forcing me to leave most of my friends off the guest list. She also bought a bunch of stuff in white without asking, even though I wanted to have an ivory dress and decorations. There's a lot more to the story, but let's just say I didn't have any say in my own wedding. It was a disaster. 

Well, next year is our 5 year anniversary. So we've decided to do Wedding 2.0! Smaller guest list! Better decorations! And I actually get to have a bachelorette-ish party this time! :D

Pinterest wasn't on my radar when we had our wedding, and I didn't even think about reddit! So I'm looking forward to seeing all you lovely people's beautiful days while planning my own! 

Cheers!

Rather than picking one pattern to use, we want as many different mandalas as possible. A vibrant crocheted rainbow in honor of such a wonderful person.

Please consider purchasing one of Wink's mandala patterns from ravelry. You can do so by going [**here**](http://www.ravelry.com/designers/marinke-slump). Or feel free to use any other pattern that you wish.

There will be two threads for posting your mandalas in: A WIP thread and a FO thread. Please keep your posts to these two threads. We want them all in one place.

Also, instead of giving out prizes for the mandalas at the end of the month, I will personally be donating to two different charities that specialize in mental health: The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and The Trevor Project. I encourage you all to donate to your own charities as well.

Other CAL's in Wink's memory are also taking place alongside ours. So when sharing on social media, please include the hashtag #MandalasforMarinke.

Thank you so much to everyone who will be participating in this CAL.

As some of you may have heard, the person behind the craft blog ""A Creative Being"" took her own life over the weekend. She had a long history with depression, something many of us can relate to. Crochet was helping her manage her depression, and indeed, her little sister said it had ""saved her life."" Unfortunately, depression is a lifetime of struggle. And sometimes it wins.

[Here's the post by her little sister, talking about what happened.](http://www.acreativebeing.com/)

[And a memorial page set up for her.](http://wink.muchloved.com/)

I know many of you, myself included, are struggling with depression, anxiety, and other overwhelming mental illness. When events like this happen, it can make you feel lost and alone. 

I just want each and every single one of you to know, *you are not alone in this.* There are people out there, willing to help. Here are some resources for you, or maybe even someone else that you know and love, who are struggling.

* /r/Anxiety

* /r/BipolarReddit
