2,"Okay, I think where we are in conflict here is putting blame on the other party.

What I'm saying is that someone can be raped without the other person involved doing something wrong.  If you are unable to consent, and have sex, you are raped.  That doesn't mean the other person committed rape, either legally or morally.  Of course, say you say, the other person bears no responsibility.

That doesn't mean the other person consented.  That doesn't mean it's okay to call them stupid.  I am not saying the other person is necessarily liable -- I am saying they did not consent to have sex.  

Now, the other person might have known the OP couldn't consent.  We don't know.  We do know that they were blackout drunk at a strip club, and that an employee there had sex with them.  To assume that the OP is at fault and to shit on them, as what happened in that thread, is messed up.

It is really weird that everyone is making the assumption that the stripper didn't rape him.  The scenario presented doesn't make it clear one way or the other, but to assume that she didn't really speaks to underlying biases.",2016-11-19 05:11:10+00:00,da6nn30,14.0,t1_da6mn3x,2092.0,legaladviceinaction

I do not think it's a crime, or morally wrong, to have sex with someone like that.  It would be nuts to put blame on someone for doing that.  

I just really think it's shitty to tell someone who was too incapacited to consent that they are stupid for it.  It strikes me in the same way of telling a woman she was dressed like she was asking for it.",2016-11-19 02:02:32+00:00,da6hqco,5.0,t1_da6h22y,1184.0,legaladviceinaction

6,"""Too intoxicated"", legally, falls under the ""what's reasonable"" test.  It's kind of a cop out, but you see it all the time in pretty much every area of law.

Other examples are ""was this a reasonable use of force"", or ""was this a reasonable action to take after the other party breached the contract"", or "" was it reasonable to fire them.""

When it comes to capacity to consent to sex, there is no bright line demarcating a person being too intoxicated.

In this case, the OP was too intoxicated to consent.  They were way over that line -- they were black out drunk.  If it came to a legal action, the test would be ""would a reasonable person know they lacked capacity.""

I know that it kind of comes across as a non-answer, but that's how the law works.  Pretty much every issue comes down to ""is that reasonable,"" and whether it's reasonable or not is determined by the trier of fact (jury decides this, or if there isn't, the judge).",2016-11-19 00:02:19+00:00,da6dgc1,3.0,t1_da6cjml,1408.0,legaladviceinaction
7,"Of course.  Someone can have sex without consenting to it (I call that rape), without the other person reasonably know that they couldn't consent.

Here's a situation where that happens:

* A person lacks the capacity to consent.  In this hypothetical, they are too drunk to consent -- they can't legally make decisions.

* The other person has no reason to know they can't consent.  The first person seems to be acting rationally.

* They have sex.

* The first person did not consent to it.  They literally cannot consent to it.

* The second person had no idea that they couldn't consent.

If you think that someone who has sex without them consenting to it is rape (I'm not sure if you do), then they were raped.  It doesn't mean the other person is morally or legally cupable.   But that doesn't mean that first person wasn't raped.

You might disagree with calling that rape.  The term rape brings up connotations of a violent physical overpowering of the victim.  I think that rape simply means having sex without consent.

Edit to add: I don't think the second person did anything wrong.  If they didn't know, or a reasonable person wouldn't know, that the other person can't consent, then of course there isn't anything wrong with it morally.

Not might be.  If you have sex with a person who is too drunk to consent, and you know that, that is rape.

&gt; You didnt answer the question earlier. Two people go drinking. Both are black out drunk. Neither remembers. Were they both raped??

I didn't mean to dodge the question.  If both are black out drunk, then yes, they both raped each other.  Would they be criminally responsible?  Depends on whether that jurisdiction allows a defense of self-induced intoxication as a way of voiding mens rea.  I don't know if any American ones do that.  I do know that is isn't a valid defense in Canada.

Would a prosecutor bring those charges? Well, probably not.

I get your position.  You think that having sex with a person who is black out drunk is fine (if you don't, I'm sorry for misunderstanding).  I'm saying that legally that is not true.

I believe that people who have sex, and lack the capacity to have sex, have been raped.  Lacking capacity covers many issues, but in this case, he was too intoxicated to have capacity.

Maybe you disagree with this.  I am fine with debating that point.

I am not saying this is necesarily a crime.  Most North American jurisdictions say that if you have sex with someone, and you are aware that they cannot consent, or a reasonable person in that situation would know that they cannot consent, then that is rape or sexual assault.

  I think that is line with what is morally okay -- it's fine if you are a little buzzed or whatever, but if you are literally black out drunk, you can't consent.  And if the other person knows you are that drunk, they shouldn't have sex with you.

He was raped. There is a difference between being raped, and that rape being a crime. If the stripper did not know he was that drunk (or a reasonable person in the same situation would not know), then it isn't a crime.  But that does not change the fact that he was raped.

Okay, listen, Ontario landlord-tenant law has a very extensive statutory framework.

Don't give advice in it if you're not familiar with it, as you can do serious harm to real, live people.

Anyways, the problem at hand.  The duties the landlord might be breaching are s 20 (fit for habitation / good state of repair) and s 22 (LL not interfere with reasonable enjoyment, this is incredibly broad and applies to a lot more than you'd think).  One stick you can shake at the Landlord is:  move me (or let me break my lease), and I won't make an application to the Landlord &amp; Tenant Board for a rent abatement / damages / order you actually have to fix this (which could be really expensive).

A bit of a wrinkle is your roommate.  If you moved in at the same time and both are on the lease, it's probably a joint tenancy.  The Landlord &amp; Tenant Board is a complete crapshoot when it comes to how it handles joint tenancies.

321,"&gt; Can you elaborate on how you consider the reasons to be very different?

His first reply was solely about apologizing about how the pose made someone feel underappreciated and uncomfortable.  The second reason said they shared the same concerns, but mostly was about how they had been working on a better, less generic pose.

I do see a difference between (paraphrasing) ""we're sorry for hurting your feelings"" vs ""we were working on a better pose and we  had similar concerns"".


&gt; Since the second reply is disputed, what else would convince you that Jeff was speaking his mind?

I actually didn't mean to give the impression that I personally don't believe the reasoning given in the second post, I just think that people have a valid reason to do so as I think the two posts are inconsistent.

I personally think the first post is dishonest.  I think they were planning on ditching it already, someone made the complaint, and Kaplan thought he could get some easy credit.

&gt;You're suggesting that the on-the-noise, direct, literal meaning is inaccurate, and citing his earlier words (that don't contradict his later ones) against his later words. That to me is suggestive of selective quoting, which I consider to be twisting words.

The subjective state of mind element means it gives people an extra layer of protection.  You can say ""No, I wasn't harassed, we were just joking around.""",2016-01-23 19:01:11+00:00,cz96adh,4.0,t1_cz95wj5,627.0,KotakuInAction

One interesting thing is that I think there's a better case for criminal harassment by Guthrie and Reilly than there was for Elliott.  Not only were they inciting others to harass Elliott, but they were also spreading a (knowingly) false accusation that he was a pedophile.  And they had successfully harassed someone in the ""real world"" before, costing him his job.  Elliott certainly had better reasons for a reasonable fear for hsi safety than they did.

He also has a shoo-in defamation case.  Guthrie knowingly spread false accusations that he was a pedophile, with the admitted specific intent to harm him. That actually falls under two of the categories for defamation per se (criminal behaviour, sexual perversion), so he doesn't even have to prove damages.

The tradition is that sex is something that men do to women, that it's a transaction where men gain something of value and women lose.  So women's sexual positivity focuses on their agency and enjoyment of sex.

Men's sex positivity is about realizing that your consent isn't something women are entitled to, and that your sex has value.  A women having sex with you isn't her doing you a favour, it's both of you mutually enjoying each other.  It's okay to not always want sex, and your worth isn't dependent on ""how lucky"" you get. 

It's like you say, everyone assumes men are sex driven and always up for anything.  Being assumed to always wanting to have sex isn't liberated, it's just as confined as assuming someone doesn't want sex.

821,"Okay, there's a lot of people making jokes at the legal reasoning, the lack of evidence, the ""shell companies"", etc.

I'm a lawyer that practices in Ontario, so my jurisdiction is pretty similar.  The whole multiple company setup is very common.  There's probably valid reasons for it.  The strange thing is that the opposing counsel didn't pick up the phone and explain the mistake regarding comapny names.  Generally the law is a very collegial profession, even when you're arguing different sides.  There's always little things like this that add to the complexity of trials and waste everybody's time, so you always try to show professional courtesy.

As far as the pleadings go, arguing in the alternative and not presenting evidence is completely normal.  The point of pleadings (HB Statement of Claim, and the Expo Statement of Defence) is to establish the scope of the trial.  

You set up the exact boundaries of what you are going to argue about, and then spend a lot of time developing and exchanging evidence, refining your legal arugments, making motions and negotiating to settle as many of the issues as you can without going to trial.  Remember that most cases are settled without going through a full trial, and even if you do go through with it, things are often narrowed down to a handful of issues by then.

So yeah, at the moment, the Expo's argument might be: 

A. We didn't have a contract;

B. but even if we did, you breached it first; 

C. but even if you didn't breach first, we were allowed to kick you out;

D. but even if we weren't allowed to kick you out, you didn't suffer damages.""

But by the time of trial, the HB will have made a motion to add the proper defendant, and maybe win a summary judgment on them being allowed to be kicke dout, and then after dsicovery the Expo realizes they can't prove the HB were disruptive.  So they negotiate a settlement and the damn thing doesn't go to trial anyways. :P",2015-11-30 10:40:11+00:00,cxhsj3y,1.0,t3_3usux5,26730.0,KotakuInAction

1021,"VIOLENCE

Yep, if you go by police reported.  For example, police reported domestic violence is about 80% female victimization.

StatsCan went and asked people back in 2005, rather than relying on police reports.  They found 7% of women and 6% of men had experienced spousal violence in the past 5 years.

http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/050714/dq050714a-eng.htm

I don't have any sources on sexual assault that don't use police reported, although I'd be glad to see them.  Note that in the US, recent changes to question methodology in the CDC studies on IPV has dramatically changed the rate of male victims report sexual assault, putting them at rates just a hair under female victims.

Other forms of police reported violence are vastly titled towards men, as your link demonstrates.  Starting around 2 to 1 for assault and going up from there.

EDUCATION

It's well known that girls are given biased grading in comparison to boys, even in subjects with ""objective"" answers.
http://people.terry.uga.edu/cornwl/research/cmvp.genderdiffs.pdf

Boys are far more likely to be removed or drop out of school.
http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/r15504/pdf/GenderGap_Tables_october_09.pdf

Women are far more likely to attend post secondary education, with current rates near 60/40.

HEALTHCARE

I'm not at all surprised women's pain is taken less seriously (I don't think this is a good thing).  Men are far less inclined to seek medical aid at all.

HOMELESSNESS

Well yeah men are far more noticeable as homeless.  As pointed out, there's far more of them using shelters, rather than staying in someone else's home.  More specifically, there's WAY more ""rough sleepers"", ie ones living on the streets.  

Even after accounting for this (by deliberately skewing their gender selection process in favor of women, see the methods section), men make the overwhelming amount of homeless.

http://www.streethealth.ca/downloads/the-street-health-report-2007.pdf



On a personal note, I find your constant victim blaming disgusting.  Men are homeless?  LOL, cause of their drug problems and mental health.

Men are disproportionately targeted by police and given harsher sentences?  Well, more men are judges, so obviously it's their fault.

Those studies are a joke.  But hey, there are also studies that show that FGM cuts HIV rates dramatically (look at Stallings et al 2005 for one).  So that's justification, right?

The UTI thing is on even shakier ground.  The original studies that found the strongest evidence was a retrospective study done by looking at patient records, not actually on patients.  The researcher colelcted a bunch of UTI charts from VA hospitals.  If the chart said they were circumcised, he put them in one pile.  If it said they weren't, or didn't say either way, he assumed they weren't circumcised, and put them in the other pile.  A wee bit flawed methodology.  Not to mention that UTIs are treatable withotu cutting flesh off.

1277,"&gt; more men are killed by other men, usually because of gang violence.

Straight to the victim blaming.  Men are far, far more often the victims of violence from strangers.  Men make up roughly 80% of homicide victims and 75% of assaults.  Tossing that aside because it's gang-related or other people of the same demographic doing it is the EXACT SAME tactic people use to dismiss black people being  victims of crime.

Men are actually more oftne the victim of domestic violence, but assaults against women are more serious.  Again, you exclude a type of vicitm (""non prison assaul"") for some reason.  But yeah, including those, men are more often the victim of sexual assault.

It's only not comparable because you make up reasons not to.  Men are victims of violence far, far more often than women are.",2015-10-04 23:10:47+00:00,cvobqm9,13.0,t1_cvob6w3,931.0,AskReddit
