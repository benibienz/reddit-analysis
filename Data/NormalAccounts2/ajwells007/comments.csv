6,"Heyo, I have connected with someone I would call my twin flame. I would say that before you think of jumping down that rabbit hole, it's important to recognize a few things: 

Twin flames are not always a romantic relationship. I go through ebbs and flows where my twin and are are madly in love, and then distant as all get out.. Just like any relationship, I suppose, although the swings are much more intense. If you are ready to tangle yourself up in such an experience and so is she, go for it. It will be a roller coaster like any other long-term investment, but it will pull from you your greatest output and your worst inner drama.

Twin flames are everywhere. I am not a believer that there is but one twin flame for any given person. I believe that we're all descendant of the same consciousness and therefore we're ALL twin flames. However, if a soul split recently then that overwhelming feeling of home is felt stronger due to the proximity of separation. 

Don't intervene! If your twin is happy, let them be happy. Your soul separated for a reason, and perhaps this lifetime you are supposed to be apart. Even if the dude is a douche, it's ok to let her learn her lessons through that experience. We all came here to learn crap so to adjust the flow to suit your desires really just hinders the whole process in the long-term. You guys will always have another chance to reconnect even if it's in another lifetime.

Find your purpose... Like for real. If you're with a girl that you'll do anything for, yet feel within yourself a masculine urge to plunge into the universe and discover its secrets, then you need to come to terms with one or the other. When we look at the world through the lense of the masculine and feminine, we find a force that desires to penetrate the universe and explore; that finds solace in its own brooding, and that pursues its passions relentlessly. We also find another force that flows with time; that speaks infinite wisdom and exudes peace through every action. These are the forces of the divine masculine and the divine feminine. Disclaimer: Women are not always feminine and men are not always masculine; this is completely ok. The thing to understand here is polarity. When talking about a romantic partner, you generally want someone who is polarized with you or else there won't be any sexual polartiy (which will stem from all other self-realizing acts of polarity). If you find yourself wanting to do anything for her, chances are you haven't found out what YOU want to do with your life. If you're a person who sways more toward the masculine, I would highly recommend pursuing the divine/ God/ purpose first and then channeling that energy toward her to help assist her in producing her greatest form of wisdom goddess possible and if she sides with the feminine then she will excel at helping to ground you into the moment and stop worrying. If you are both polarized by being in the middle, you will help each other balance by centering both of your energies so that you are not attached to either wisdom or success, but are synthesized into a state of well-being where neither is important to you. If you identify most with the feminine, you can find your own well-being by flowing with the moment, accepting divine intuition, and ""coaching"" your partner on wise ways to spend their energy; if she identifies with the masculine, she will have a clear sense of direction and be a solid foundation for you to return to when times get tough. You will be the tumultous sea that is both calm and raging, and she will be the ship that has charted a course to ride on you. This all hinges on both of you feeling deeply into your primal urges and knowing what drives you the most. Keep in mind that NEITHER is wrong to identify with. Society has built up stereotypes about the masculine and feminine by placing these ""expectations"" on people based on whether they have a penis or vagina although everyone can fall into one category or the other.

Your greatest gift to her is to encourage and be happy for wherever she is. If you can find within yourself to genuinely appreciate the beauty of her finding her own beauty, then whatever relationship you have will never fail. Keep admiring her from afar if that's appropriate, admire her close up if that works out. Whatever happens, remember that there are most likely multiple twins and you will encounter them sooner or later in this lifetime or the next :) Twins are ""special"" because they push you in weird ways... But if you're looking for straight love, that's everywhere.",2016-10-28 06:52:51+00:00,d9b4whr,1.0,t3_59slqt,9240.0,spirituality

I think that all souls split from the same source, but TFs specifically just split from a less distilled form of the eternal source and they split more recently which is why they ""recognize"" one another. Imagine the parable of Adam and Eve. They would have known right away that they were supposed to be together; that they came from the same source. That's why the polarity was so strong.

With each breath out, focus on relaxing deeper into your body. Also worth noting is that no one method works for everyone everytime.

59,"Something to keep in mind is that there is a chance that you have many twin flames in this lifetime. We are all part of the same eternal source and essentially we are all ""twin flames."" How recently a particular soul split, however, changes the intensity of the recognition and the bond is stronger.

Also, when I first started learning about twins and such, I was very picky about the verbage. Who's the chaser? Am I running? Is she running? Who's running the show?? haha. The more I felt into it, however, the more I realized that it's just like any other relationship. Both chase, and both run. With twins, the motivation just tends to be because they're freaked out by it. Typically, one will be less freaked out than the other leading to a general runner and chaser, but that's not always the case. 

If your goal is not to break up the relationship, then I would suggest learning how to love their relationship first before trying to contact him again. Truly, truly love her and him together. See how beautiful it is and how right she is for him and vice versa. If you can't do that, then it may be best to talk to your closest friends about how to ""grieve the loss."" I would personally view it more as a growing pain, but not all bad. You've grown from this. You've been opened to a REALLY cool concept of soul-splitting! Of being one with everything! That's something most people don't get woken up to :) My theory is that the sleepwalkers just kind of fizzle back into the universal consciousness, but those who've woken up will be able to reincarnate and continue to learn and grow closer to Source.

Have you tried finding your completion by yourself alone? I feel that if you achieved Nirvana in your own well-being, the roles of chaser and runner may very well be reversed back to ""normal"" for you guys ;) 

Based on what you said, though, the relationship did seem a little rocky /: The comfort, at least, is that our twin is not always meant to be with us. For some reason, the soul split and needed to learn different lessons in this life time.. So recognizing that he IS you and you ARE him, you're really just helping yourself by letting him run his own game. Your souls know what's best for themselves. Someday, we will all rejoin as one in the end anyway. The trick is letting the process happen and not attaching to outcome. We will have pain, yes, and pleasure, yes. But attaching or resisting either of these only causes suffering.

I don't know if this helped at all, but in any case keep you're chin up! There's thousands of fish in the sea, and honestly there's probably a twin or two out there just waiting to encounter you! :) Be open to the new flow! It could be an entirely new ride that will take you to incredible new realms! Enjoy the journey ",2016-08-28 04:16:43+00:00,d6zm1qq,1.0,t3_4zsusi,82825.0,twinflames

I was very skeptical about the whole twin flame concept as well. I met this girl who showed up out of the blue at seemingly the most opportune time (you can find my whole tf/ sc post if you go to the twin flame sub and look for my user). It has been an extremely interesting ride with that one, let me tell you. She pushes me in ways I couldn't have dreamt up, yet gives me pleasure beyond my wildest imagination. We have some strange effect on one another where sometimes we're in sync and can read into the other, while other times we're all out of whack and our communication breaks down. My theory on the latter is that because we are romantically invested, a whole other aspect of ourselves is being formed and molded. Our disagreements always end up bringing us closer.

I would say just keep on keeping on :) Learn how to channel your attraction to her. Let's be honest, there's got to be some level of attraction... She sounds amazing to you! And if she's beautiful, then there's that to deal with as well. Clearly you don't want to hurt your wife, but then again you can have an attraction to an individual and still exercise self-control. This is NOT to be confused with self-restraint. She is a fountain of feminine energy in your life and you COULD just full on swim in that fountain, but that has its own consequences, obviously. OR (recommended) you can use that oh so special twin flame feminine energy and channel it into your own creative purpose in life. She can, in a way, serve as a tool to help you reach your fullest potential. Channel that passion into your family, your career, your endeavors; all while maintaining a healthy relationship with her and adding to her life as well.

86,"Heyo, brother! First of all, way to listen to yourself. You're feeling into your most constant voice: your feelings. That's how God/ the universe/ purpose/ whateveridc communicates to us humans. I have a few suggestions, some take more discipline than others.

Read Conversations With God by Neale Doald Walsch. Written by a dude who claims to have had a dictation from God. Whether you believe the man or not, the book is still loaded with wisdom.

Read David Deida's ""The Way of the Superior Man"" This book helped me reconnect to my masculine side and is always good to revisit if you need to remember that your purpose is the most important goal for you. If you don't know your purpose on this planet yet, there's your first goal: find that out!

Pour a glass of water in the toilet every morning and just notice yourself doing that. Doing anything to break the system can pull us out of a rut.

Make work a meditation. Really be mindful about the cleaning. Notice the toilets. What are they made out of? HOW were they made? What does your body feel like while you clean? Sing while you clean! Dance while you clean! I work a job where I have to cook and clean (in a group home) and I just randomly felt like dancing while I did my chores; it actually really livened my spirit. 

Yoga! Not just for chicks. Yoga connects your body and spirit, making it easier for you to preemptively feel into your spirit before depressive waves.

Meditate. 10 mins a day. Not a huge commitment, but be careful because it can get addicting, haha (I wouldn't know... Haven't been too good about that practice yet...)

Start some hobbies if you haven't already. If you haven't heard it yet, you should have 3 hobbies: one for money, one for exercise, one for fun. That's only 3 out of your 7 days if you choose to spend a bigger chunk of time each week on said hobbies.

Listen to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour for interesting convos; Listen to Jack Kornfield's Heart Wisdom podcast when you're feeling down; read Ram Dass/ listen to his podcasts when you want to reconnect to your spirit.

Also, it's not like you have to do ALL of these tomorrow. Start with baby steps. The way I got into adopting better habits was to first discipline myself to brush my teeth twice a day and floss once a day whether or not I felt like it. Might seem like a small feat, but once I got that down the new habits became ""stackable."" It was as if I could more easily adopt new habits and a better lifestyle.

You're going to accomplish much in this life. Your will is your way. Tell yourself every morning that you love yourself and that you love life, then watch that actually be the case. Sounds cheesy, but that's the way our neurons work. They fire off easier the more they are used. Make the positive ones work, and they will take less to make them work in the long run. But all in all, feel into your soul and let it guide you. It knows the way to life and love, all you have to do is let it take the reigns.

97,"For sure, man. I would say it goes in waves. Sometimes sexual passion is overwhelming and, as such, needs to be channeled into positive creative energy. This doesn't always mean doing the deed.. With the right intentions and setting, having a sexual interaction is the perfect way to encounter the passion. Although, there are far more sexually stimulating things in the world than there are sexual fantasies actually played out. That being said, I want to reiterate my point about positively channeling the energy. This is how people will stop hurting one another over sexual interactions; it starts with the individual. 

On the flip side, there will be times when sex is not at the front of your mind. This is something to keep in mind if you are considering marrying someone, because there may come a day when your partner wants you like they never have before and you just... aren't feeling it. That's great, if you actually have some other productive thing you are accomplishing. But if your partner wants to engage, and the only interaction you are giving them is a quick hug and a back rub, you're not doing your job. It may take practice, but it is possible to delve into that passionate spirit of sex even when the moment doesn't seem right to you. This all has to do with your mindset of what a sexual encounter is. If, to you, it is a loving, giving act (as is often the case from masculine to feminine), and pushes each individual in the direction of growth, then it should be little struggle to muster up the passion to engage with your partner. If sex is still a self-pleasing act to you, it may be difficult to find that arousal.

I recently had the same experience and when several weeks just completely not wanting any sort of sexual encounter. Eventually, that mindset no longer served me but I still had the ""not into it"" feeling. I had to learn to channel that energy into a different form in order to desire the engagement with my partner.

This is not to say that relationships and sex are bad. It's just very natural to lose many desires when you pursue the spiritual path, and maintaining relationships is still important despite the urge to just hike up a mountain and chill out with some monks forever. I guess that's what they mean by karma :P",2016-07-14 09:07:12+00:00,d5bqnbz,1.0,t3_4sppt5,40433.0,spirituality

112,"There is a broader way to analyze this. According to the Christian religion, Jesus Christ came as humanity's salvation. According to Gnosticism, this salvation was in the form of detaching from the ego and loving your neighbor as yourself; something they believed very strongly to be the ultimate message of Christ. To ""believe"" in Christ is to accept him and his way of life as true. Many Buddhists and other spiritual beings are unknowingly also Christians by the very definition of what it means to be one: a follower of Christ. While they may not deliberately follow him, many of his instructions are also upheld in other religions. Assuming that God is just pure consciousness and that we as the human experiencer are dimmer shades of that wider consciousness, then it will be fulfilled simply in the sense that those her pursue happiness will find happiness. ""The kingdom of Heaven is within you."" - Ye old J.C. In order to answer this question, we also have to understand what it means to have everlasting life. Does that mean that I get to keep all memories when I die? Do I remember my name? Do I still attach to it? Will I be self-aware? Will I act more in line to my instincts, or make decisions based off of previous situations? Further, what is life? Is this everlasting fountain of life attainable in this realm or ONLY once we die and are faced with the opportunity to cross the threshold into whatever is next (if anything).",2016-06-09 05:49:57+00:00,d41z3xn,1.0,t3_4n8ucz,11766.0,spirituality

117,"Your story is great :) Glad to see so many people waking up, and thankful everyday for all the teachers around us to show us the way. I remember not too long ago, I received a vision during a meditation. I won't go into the whole vision because it's pretty long :P but suffice it to say, there were a lot of bizarre and fascinating things that corralated to the journey I was on at that point. Naturally, I got very excited because it was my first ever vision! I told my best friend, and while he was happy for me he reminded me of the non-attachment aspect of the whole game. If we seek to have ""signs"" (could be visions, could be muscle spasms, could be good fortune, etc) then we could be led astray. Buddha was shown visions of the beautiful daughters of Mara in order to tempt him and lull him off track. If he'd have succumbed to the signs shown to him, he would not have been able to reach his highest manifestation. It's not that the signs are bad or good. They just are. When we start classifying things as bad and good, we tend to cling to the good and flee from the bad. We forget very easily that it is all suffering (or not) depending on how you look at it. A ""good"" thing is one that brings us pleasure while it is there, and brings suffering when it is gone. A ""bad"" thing is one that brings us suffering while it's there and relief when it is gone. The signs can also leave us feeling this way.. If we had amazing and clear signs consistently for a year and a half, and then none for a decade, we'd naturally feel like we're doing something wrong. But then it's just part of the game. We suffer through our joys. Or we chuckle at the suffering and say, ""Oh yeah! You're just here to remind me how happy I am when you're gone!"" Non-attachment..

126,"Dude here, checking in. I would say that across the board, the overall idea of what you're saying rings true. While these men are responsible for their actions, it is not without causal events. If we take a look at Western culture in particular, there is currently a strong push for men to get more in touch with their feminine side. I believe that this is a very positive push, but doesn't provide any guidance on how to deal with our inert masculine desires, urges, and impulses. I've got a few things to say, so I'll break it down into a few categories:

Masculine and feminine energy/ balance: Every single human being on this planet is born with masculine and feminine energy. Most men identify more with their masculine, and most women identify more with their feminine. The goal of self-mastery is to achieve harmony with the universe, and that starts with harmony within the self. This includes the understanding and balance of the masculine and feminine energies. To find this balance, one must find within him or herself where they fall on the masculine/ feminine spectrum. It is ok to be a masculine person, while understanding your feminine side and vice versa. This does not always mean an even 50/50 for each force, but understanding and coming into harmony with them will bring out the strongest, most authentically beautiful higher self. With these ideas in mind, many men who identify with their masculine side are told by culture to be ""feminine."" Either that, or they are encouraged to further pursue the darker edges of their masculine instincts by their peers or television shows. There doesn't seem to be a lot of room for balance.  Women on the other hand, are being pushed further and further into more masculine positions (office jobs, businesses, etc). Women are just as capable at carrying out these tasks as men, and in some instances even do better. But if they are doing the mundane, gritty jobs they may lose touch with their feminine side by forgetting how to flow with their being and become bitter and stressed. I think the core root of the issue is balance. What's happening currently is an overcompensation for the imbalance of the past. Men are becoming more like women, and feel bad for having masculine impulses. And women are becoming more like men, and feel subdued and unequal for having feminine impulses. This balance must come from the people spreading these ideas; not some government interested in our income tax.

Beauty everywhere: Part of the masculine urge is to dive head first into life. Men and women both have this urge at times, as we have both forces within us, but to stay on you topic, OP, I will just discuss the man's side from here on out and I hope anyone reading this will be able to discern how these forces are applicable to their own gender, and society as a whole. Men typically get swept up in their heads. Thinking too much, working too much, trying to get a piece of bubble-booty too much, etc. I believe part of this is to do with the frustration of how to displace their masculine energy. When raised in a society of being scolded for checking out sexy women, or being called a pig for cat calling, from a very young age we men are conditioned that viewing women sexually from the get-go is wrong. Yet most men will admit to thinking women strangers are sexy! What to do with this energy built up inside of you? Do you slink away to the bathroom and spurt out an unattainable wish? Do you hit up the club every weekend to try and pick up hot chicks? No societal option that I have come across has offered insight into this dilemma. However, it is possible to recognize this ""sexiness"" and not feed your ape-like sexual urges. By understanding that this universe IS beauty, and that it is made up of a wide range of energies (masculine, feminine, balanced) you begin to see not only women, but people, forests, traffic, society, politics, stars, EVERYTHING as something that eminates a particular force. Now, if a woman is surpassingly gorgeous you can actually reach a much more long-term solution to feeding your soul joy. There is joy to be found in beautiful women. They radiate feminine energy, and as men we are very attracted to feminine energy (the outdoors is a great example). Women happen to be the most condensed, vibrant form of this energy so when men raised in a confused society are confronted with so much condensed beauty everywhere and no real solution in site, instead of cultivating the energy and using it to propel them into their purpose, they either abuse the women by mistreating them or they abuse their own higher selves sexually by masturbating without intent or callousing themselves to sexual activity. The key is to realize that beauty is everywhere and it always deserves respect. The work is on the self.

Women don't want womanly men: Lastly, most feminine women typically do not want a feminine man. I realize that while this is not true for ALL women, most women would agree that a balanced, driven, loving man is more deserving of her love and support than a starry-eyed, lovestruck, worshipper of her. There are some women who are more identified with their masculine who would like to have a man who's dream it is to simply love life and support her goals while doing that. Those men may not have a great purpose that drives them, but instead simply enjoy living in the moment at any given time. However, speaking in generalities, most women would prefer the kind of man who says that it will be ok no matter what, and then takes the initiative to make that a reality. A man who meets her in her darkest moments and her lightest moments and loves watching her dance. She can wail, scream, love, and shine. No matter what, he's still there unconditionally to provide a solid, non-ego focused return to happiness, joy, and eternal bliss. A man who lives in the present moment without succumbing to his body's sexual urges just to please his genitals for a few fleeting moments. These type of men will be confident in their purpose on this planet, love her for the support she offers, praise her for the beautiful work she does, make love THROUGH her not merely WITH her, and remind her everyday that happiness is always right where they're at together. 

TLDR: 

1. Men in today's society have difficulty mastering their masculine and feminine balance. They may not understand what to do with natural, pent-up desires toward women. This does not excuse actions; merely explains them.

2. There is beauty everywhere, and women are no exception. Understanding how to gaze upon beauty while respecting the individual is a process of cultivating your self-awareness. Respecting the individual does not mean disrespecting yourself by ""abstaining"" or ""stifling"" your own urges, but rather implies a reframe on how you are allowing their radiant energy to affect your well-being.

3. Love the masculine/ feminine balance inside of you and everyone else.

131,"Step one: Look up Twin Flames/ soul connections. You don't have to adopt all of the new-agey terminology, but those frames might give you a good ground to at least build off of. When I met the girl who fit similar descriptions of what you're going through, a random YouTube video popped up (either a synchronicity, or get out of my head YouTube....) that talked about twin flames. Like I said, you don't have to adopt EVERYTHING that everyone says about them, but some things will help you. Just take what will help your soul grow.

Also, before trying to move forward in any relationship, read ""The Way of the Superior Man"" by David Deida. The book changed my outlook profoundly and gave me a clear, driven outlook on how to ""deal"" with women and your libido. There is also a SoundsTrue recording of David Deida speaking on similar points that the book brings up. I'm sure you could find some online source to download it.

Also, there's a Twin Flame subreddit, so if you have more specific questions you can head over there. Very open, loving community. I got a lot of help when I was first going through the opening phases of meeting my TF/ SC. If she is your soul connection, hang on tight! It's gonna be a fun, twirly, sometimes stressful rollercoaster of adventures where you'll each grow deeper and stronger together. If she is your flame, it's very important to treat it like any normal relationship. In other words, just because she's your flame doesn't mean one of you couldn't screw the whole thing up. Cherish her, don't smother her. It's also important to note that flames don't always reunite during the same lifetime they've met. You may meet your flame on the street, be SO sure of it, and then she's gone forever. Your souls are doing growth apart from each other before coming back together.

Don't make her your everything. Remember your life's purpose, and she will love you for it. If you don't know your life's purpose, find that out before trying to offer up anything less to her. ",2016-05-03 05:18:46+00:00,d2qou4q,1.0,t3_4hjv5o,28734.0,spirituality
132,"Your brain only receives positive input, in a way. So telling yourself, ""Don't do [anything]"" and your brain only hears, ""[anything]."" This will just prolong the process of getting rid of the muck. It's just an active process of staying positive and finding your inner peace (most important aspect, in my opinion). You can ""program"" your neurons, so to speak, to instinctively respond to a stimulus by seeing the positive. Right now, most people are running the negative system, unfortuntately. Instead of getting up in the morning saying, ah, gee, it sure is early, I feel slow... that means it's gonna be a slow day... yesterday sucked, so today will, too.. Instead of all those negative brain-preoccupations, tell yourself, ""MMM, baby, I'm gonna eat some GOOOOOD breakfast this morning.

At first, it might seem kind of silly and like you're over-appreciating all of the small things, but eventually your brain just sort of reprograms its general instincts and you're just a generally more positive, motivated person.

135,"A few things. First off, beings exist on certain planes, and they don't on others. I have had a few run-ins with odd entities who then fizzle out of my life never to be heard from again. I've also had prolonged contact with some entity, but when you shift your plane, framework, or acceptance, rather, of the universe the interactions and presence of these things could shift as well. Imagine you've got a bully who bullies you strictly because you have a reaction. Well, find your inner peace, eh? Become your higher self and just be happy. Next thing you know, the bully can't get a reaction out of you. You're just... you. You're just a happy little elf and no matter how much that mosquito tries to bite you, you just go, ""Ha! Little mosquito. There you are playing that part."" 

I don't know if you are into chakral energy at all, but if you are I'll just leave this tid-bit here. Perhaps there's some built-up unconscious preoccupation with your first chakra. Not saying your sex life is lacking or anything, but if there's some primal urges stored there, then work may have to be done. Since the astral plane is fairly undocumented, we can only speculate to some extent what these beings are, what they're doing, and how they act. Perhaps she is a helper? Maybe showing you what you need to work on, and getting increasingly ""upset"" when you resist growth? Perhaps she's just a malicious being out to make your life miserable! Heck if I know!

All this said, I experienced something similar while on my own astral attempt (never completely left my body, but getting there.... ooof). Basically I was laying in my bed and did my astral meditation yadayadayada, and next thing I know there's definitely some feeling of something starting to ride me. I'm like, uh..... what? This went on for some time and she eventually left (it was a clearly feminine presence, but I could never see her). So out she goes and I'm just confused. But she's gone, now. I guess I just said, ""Heh, thanks hun, but no thanks. We'll be seeing you."" In some sense, you decide what plane of existence you're on. Maybe the Zeus archetype resounds and he exists within you and performs miracles of lightning bolts, maybe Jesus performs miracles through the use of your body. Whatever plane you're running, things will happen. For now, it seems you're on the plane where she repeatedly comes to you. Maybe try enjoying it? As weird as that sounds, maybe give it a shot. Perhaps she DESIRES to see you resist. To not let go, to relinquish your natural craving to surrender (not in a sexual way, but on the universal level of surrendering to all). Who knows?

Buddha said something along the lines of, if you recieve visions don't give them your own interpretation and meaning. It's the art of letting go. When you pursue this path (away from consensus reality, that is) odd things are bound to happen! Take 'em as they come. You've probably got some growing to do from it.

It's almost like a system reboot for your brain and really helps to reframe your outlook to realign your true purpose here. There's a lot of New-Agey talk in the book, but if you're cool with that he has a lot of wisdom to share. There's also a lecture series from SoundsTrue.com that I'm sure you could torrent somewhere. 

One thing that I do when I lose focus on what's important is to practice austerity. This takes a certain level of self-discipline d/t it's very nature. Currently I am not eating sweets, no cuddling with my s/o (unless it's just to fall asleep. Cuddling for the sake of cuddling is out during this period of austerity), no sex, no television, no reading or playing anything while using the toilet or eating, no tv, no magazines. Basically just limiting the ""distractions"" helps you to get down to the real ""you."" Typically, this will make an individual very sad for a while. When we're ""just ourselves"" we are forced to either be ecstatic about who we are, or face the emptiness that we've created ourselves to be, which in turn inspires us to improve.

That being said, if you are a woman gamer these things still apply but they are much more effective with people who identify as a masculine energy.

The commune is actually only a short distance from a small town with lots of local traders, and I will be interacting with said community often so that's a green light for economics as far as I'm concerned!

Do you know if they germinate vegetables? Or marijuana? They have lots of garden crops and they are thinking of starting a small hemp farm. I would like to tell them how my idea can be a contribution to the community they're starting.

Do you recommend wearing a bee suit? Or just going all in? Do they typically sting? Do you just get used to it?

How much time does it take up? Is it possible to have a separate investment as my ""career"" and take this up more as a financial-sustaining hobby?

I would prefer bees that make honey so I can give it to my family as well as trade some of it away. Is there a minimum-level maintenance/ beginner's bee for honey-making? 

My family lives on ~12 acres. Is this enough space to put the hive somewhere distant enough so it won't disrupt the humans? I wouldn't want the place swarming with bees...

167,"I met my twin flame about 1.5 months ago. I was dating this girl, we'll call her Sammy. Well, Sammy and I had started dating in the late summer of 2015. I was a defined Christian and so was she. The relationship was very respectful and healthy. However, recently I started going through some extreme spiritual realizations that I simply couldn't ignore. I told her I could no longer label myself a Christian as she did. This obviously caused a negative response from her and essentially we had to break up because of it. Before the break-up I told myself that if we did break up then I would need to be on my own for awhile. I needed to grow and learn etc. and I was set in my ways about that. Anyway, a day before we broke up with her, I meet ""Kayla."" Kayla and I are hanging out all night with mutual friends and we keep making eye contact on accident. You know when you looked at your twin flame for the first time? It's like lightning or something... Like you've known them forever. Well anyway, since I was in a relationship I dismissed it and went on but I couldn't help but think, ""Who the frick IS this girl??"" So Sammy and I break up and Kayla came back to go on a date with my best friend who was my roommate back then. I come back to the house from wherever I was, and I was so content to just be by myself and on my own after going through the breakup. Well, I hung out with my bestie and her and a few other pals all night. My bestie went to bed and he thought that she was going to leave, but she ended up staying up all night with me and my other pal. I had to go into work fairly early in the morning and she decided to wait at my house until I got back. We had talked at length for most of the night and it was just this incredible knowing... This ""coming home"" feeling. I didn't even know what a twin flame was, but that was how I felt and that's how we had described it. So to answer your question, I met my twin flame completely on accident, and at a point in my life where I felt like I was going to be taking complete control of everything only to have the universe tell me that its plan trumps mine. There have been a whole slew of synchronicities between the two of us that will take too long to type.. :P Recently I had my very first vision and she was the subject. It's been a lot of fun!

I could see a flickering from within my room and when I finally got inside, I could see that the walls were lined with candles lighting the whole room. I looked over into the corner where my bed was, and noticed that my body was in bed sleeping. The next thing I noticed was a hulking, haunched-shouldered creature wearing tattered robes and who had shaggy hair. It was just standing there staring and breathing and watching my body sleep. I tried to yell at it to make it go away, but no voice would come out. After I tried, it turned and looked directly at me.

It doesn't matter if spirituality isn't ""about"" having those experiences. Who gets to decide what spirituality is ""about?"" In my opinion, pursuing the spiritual path just comes with having those experiences or at least being open to their possibility. Frankly, you have no idea what I ""want"" so by sighing and saying you know makes it seem like you think you have some extra power and insight into people's life. Why is there even a need or want to feel more spiritual? Heck if I know, or care. I'm just watching the world turn, kicking back, and enjoying the view. Not attaching, not reacting, just consistently saying, ""Hm. I wonder"" and pointing out patterns (coincidences, synchronicities, whatever you want to call them) when they bubble up because why not? It's fun and enjoyable to realize that you're just part of the universe's process, and this is a process that happens to make patterns. Us humans are not outside of this, we're just capable of consciously choosing to observe. And when we choose to observe, we're going to see the patterns. It's inevitable. We evolved to recognize patterns.

Now onto the ""bad"" events. Yep. I know. Got those, too. My roommate moved out and I was really sad because he's like my best friend of 7 years and we talk about all the same philosophers and what books we're reading etc. Lo and behold, the roommate that replaced him (which was a gamble off of Craigslist) is into, or at least heard of, LITERALLY all the same people, philosophies, and has similar hobbies. Coincidence? Whatever, man. You decide. And another thing, I was in love with a woman a few months ago. Thought I was going to marry her. She didn't think we could line up spiritually, because I was more open to observing the truth through multiple facets. She wanted to express her spirituality through Christianity, which is fine. She just couldn't come to terms with it, whereas I was ok with making it work. She broke up with me in the end because of it, and do you think this was some huzzah moment in my life? Of course not! I was heartbroken. I told myself, I said, ""Self? You're taking some time on your own, mkay? You're gonna grow big and strong. No more ladies to distract you, at least not for awhile!"" And then, of course, I'm not in control again and I meet this woman who is my mirror. I don't know if you've met someone like that (male, female, doesn't matter) but it was very clear that when we looked at each other it was as if we'd known each other forever without having to verbally express that this was the case. Now what kind of a pickle am I in? Surely ""I"" decided that ""I"" needed to grow and that ""I"" needed to stay away from women, yet in the same moment I'm met with a woman I've never had this experience with. Do I pass it up, or just ride the wave? Well, to resist the wave is futile. Anyone who thinks they're going to control the happenings is fooling themselves.

 I see it as waves. ""Bad"" things happen, and then ""good"" things happen. It's when we attach that we start losing our way. I think it's best to not even consider the world in terms of good and evil, but just happenings. Sometimes something brings you pain during it's existence (a ""bad"" thing) and sometimes something brings you pain after it leaves (a ""good"" thing). You can't have either indefinitely, and they will inevitably give you both sensations so how can you possibly perceive something as inertly good or bad?

Onto competition. Who's competing? Me? Certainly not. Who is that guy, even? How is it remotely possible for me to compete, when I can't have the slightest impact on how everything is supposed to go down? I don't know if you were introduced to spirituality as if it was a competitive thing about who can do the coolest crap and who knows the most about occult things or whatever, but it's not fair to project that assumption on others. I grew up in a Christian Assemblies of God setting, so boy have I been jaded to the concept of spiritual competitiveness from the start. From a young age, I felt pressured to speak in tongues. Lots of other kids could, why couldn't I? The concept of elevating oneself above another has never resounded with me, and this is ingrained from a young age. I'm not telling you I'm some more enlightened being since having these experiences. Far from it. I'm a worm, yeah? We all are. Nobody's anybody! So why don't we all just play? Anything's possible! Maybe not, but why not? At the end of you're life, are you going to look back and say, ""My, what a wonderful time I had trying to make sense of it all."" Or are you going to say, ""Dudebro.

Ram Dass has a lot of lectures on YouTube. He is fun to listen to, sounds just like a real buddy, and has a lot of wisdom. If you're a reader, check out his book ""Be Here Now""

188,"Well firstly for me, I try to stay away from definitive words like ""belief"" and ""religion."" Both of these are very dim explanation of a very vast reality. To believe something is to attach to it to a certain degree. When we disattach to the ego, we are left with the watcher or the knower. At that point, we can then move away from believing in things to simply knowing them to be so. Perhaps these truths are not known to the subject in the same way that their neighbor or coworker knows their own truths. When it comes to astral projection, I wouldn't be surprised if it is entirely legit. A person crossing through some dimension into the ""dream realm"" and able to view things straight from their spirit body. 

As far as ""fake"" things that aren't actually fake, I personally really like crystals. They're fun to hold and catch the light. Numerology is also an interesting subject matter to take up. Astrology is pretty sweet too.

Idk too much about beings. I've seen one in my lifetime. There was a guy on YouTube who claims to have been possessed by a succubus.

212,"/u/Rhodinia talked about discipline, which is interesting because I literally JUST talked to my uncle about how to invoke a higher sense of discipline. Rhodinia got it right, though. Discipline is where it's at. The philosopher Alan Watts mentioned in one of his lectures that you can't change yourself. Trying to do so will only make life hard. What we can realize is that we're experiencing suchness and only by fully experiencing the moment can we enjoy life. Deciding to be disciplined in the moment consistently shines through. We can never be who we're going to be; we can only be who we are now. So it's really a decision of who you want to be RIGHT NOW. I'll leave this quote here, because it's helpful in general, although not strictly applicable:

""The whole problem [of resisting the fact that you will die] is that there really is no other problem for human beings than to go over that waterfall when it comes. Just as you go over any other waterfall, just as you go on from day-to-day, just as you go to sleep at night, be absolutely willing to die. Now, I’m not preaching. I’m not saying you ought to be willing to die, and that you should muscle up your courage and somehow put on a good front when the terrible thing comes. That’s not the idea at all. The point is that you can only die well if you understand this system of waves. If you understand that you’re disappearance as the form in which you think you are you—your disappearance as this particular organism is simply seasonal. That you are just as much the dark space beyond death as you are the light interval called life. These are just two sides of you, because YOU is the total wave. You see, we can’t have half a wave. Nobody ever saw waves which just had crests, and no troughs. So you can’t have half a human being, who is born but doesn’t die—half a thing. That would be only half a thing. But the propagation of the vibrations of life is vibration—it simply goes on an on, but its cycles are long cycles and short cycles. So don’t resist change. We are liberated by the very fact of not being able to stop changing. You can’t hang on to yourself. You don’t have to try not to hang on to yourself. It can’t be done, and that is salvation. ‘Memento Mori,’ ‘be mindful of death.’ The most important thing for anyone to realize is that you and every person you see will soon be dead. It sounds so gloomy to us because we have devised a culture fundamentally resisting death. From the first standpoint, the worst is going to happen: you’re all going to die. And don’t just put it off in the back of your mind and say ‘I’ll consider that later.’ It’s the most important thing to consider NOW, because it is the mercy of nature, because it’s going to enable you to let go and not defend yourself all the time, waste all energies in self-defense. There is a wonderful quote that says: ‘I pray that death will not come and find me still unannihilated.’ In other words, man dies happy if there is no one to die which means the ego has disappeared before death caught up to him. But you see, the knowledge of death helps the ego to disappear because it tells you that you can’t hang on. So what we need is to go out with a bang instead of a whimper."" ~Alan Watts

Also, if God were to exercise this teaching, wouldn't he allow all righteous people (those who grew toward betterment, perhaps without comprehending the terminology and laws of the Bible) into heaven? It seems that He would be acting more on the side of justness, but then to follow God more acutely wouldn't we also have to emphasize justness over righteousness?

2. What are the criteria to be chosen by God? How will we know if we are the chosen ones?

3. With that logic, aren't we all under the affect of the truth of salvation and doesn't that essentially guarantee salvation for everyone regardless of life experience? What is the well of life? Do you mean the essence of existence; the idea that there's a ""me"" in my head?

4. (responding to 5) I have identified as a christian for 22 years and have definitely had spiritual encounters with a benevolent, loving, comforting being. Any and all negativity was rendered mute  during said encounters. Now I'm certain these encounters existed, yet I've been told on more than one occasion that once you've experience the love of the father you can never leave the faith, and if you can leave then you never actually experienced His love to begin with. How can I have felt something so pure and loving, yet be completely indifferent towards keeping the Christian faith?",2016-01-25 08:10:39+00:00,czb1e4m,4.0,t1_czb0xsx,1556.0,Christianity
239,"First off, thank you for the response! I really appreciate it :) Just have a few more questions as I am very intrigued by all things spiritual and want to have a wide understanding of Christianity.

1. Perhaps more personally, is faith enough? Many Muslims, Jews, and other religions alike, have complete faith that what they've been taught is in fact the correct way of thinking. Is Christianity different from this (again without using the Bible for reasoning, as that is at some level circular logic)?

2. As somewhat of an addition to the previous text, is it our responsibility to choose the correct faith? The Quran is just as Holy and divinely inspired to a Muslim as the Bible is to a Christian, and if all we have to go off of is another man's word that what they have is indeed the word of God, then how are we to place our faith? Let's say we chose a different faith because it made more sense to us, or brought us closer to whom we consider God to be. Further, let's consider the notion that whatever faith we chose (Christianity included) wasn't the ""right"" one, and we stood before the God of an ""opposing"" religion on judgement day. Will this God eternally damn to Hell for not picking correctly, even though at your core you were following your heart (i.e. the Holy Spirit, that still small voice, or the consciousness in us all that tells us what 'good' and 'bad' mean)?

3. What is the truth of salvation? If Christ hadn't come, would that mean that we would have to continue sacrificing animals for atonement? What is the grace of God?

4. Strictly from a speculative sense, I suppose. Of course it's impossible to say for sure what God will do, but due to what the Bible says about Him, we have a pretty good guess. 

5. It's important to me because I am wondering if the burden of choosing the 'right' God rests on my shoulders. Am I going to be punished forever if I just did my best my entire life to grow closer to whomever or whatever God is?",2016-01-25 07:16:51+00:00,czb0f3a,2.0,t1_czb029z,1086.0,Christianity

243,"Hello again! Thank you for the very insightful responses :) Definitely some good things in there to bring up to her.

Now about that off-the-grid business. I should clarify, that it's as ""off-the-grid"" as it can be on this particular property, but we'll still be very close to civilization. There's a town less than 15 minutes away and a city less than 45 (driving). So obviously, unless I want to rent an oil rig.. I'll have to have some supplementary income to keep my car going if I wish to make those trips.

As far as advancing my knowledge, I really hope that the libraries remain open. However, I've still got 6 years to acquire heaps of books by ancient and modern philosophers which should keep me going for awhile. Also, religious texts are valuable for multiple reads and I'm sure I could keep busy just learning through the books.

As far as health reasons, I believe in preventative measures. I believe that the majority of illnesses can be prevented by eating the right foods. Simplified: don't give cancer a reason to start. My aunt is also somewhat of an herbalist and I've used her ointments and medicines before and they work great. There are many chiropractors and health nuts in the area, so as far as routine checkups, we should be good. Not too concerned about dentistry. Take care of your mouth and it'll take care of itself, right? Immunizations is something I hadn't really considered yet. Thanks for bringing that up.

The land may or may not be in my name, not too sure. But I'll be using my supplemented income to help them pay off the mortgage on their property until it's taken care of.

If what you say about taxes is true, then I suppose I'll just have to fake my death... Haha, just kidding. I'll probably just have to let that be one area that I'll have to compromise in. No sense in having the U.S. government track me down.

Lastly, the area is prime for people with this mindset. There's actually a lot of information on ""intentional living communities"" that you can find online. I believe West Virginia has a lot of these ""communes"" and they actually pay people to live there? Or something like that? Not too sure, and don't quote me. I only heard that from a friend who heard that from a friend. Suffice it to say, lots of people with this same idea are making plans to move to that area. Maybe not the exact same property, but walking or hiking distance at least.

Again, thanks for your answers and your interest, stranger! May your days be filled with love :)",2016-01-12 20:42:27+00:00,cyvqzd4,4.0,t1_cyvaox1,23757.0,relationship_advice
244,"First of all, many many thanks for your response! I wasn't sure anyone would actually respond to this, so thank you. You seem like a level-headed person who is willing to share what's on your mind.

Let me begin by clearing a few things up so as to communicate the situation better, as I have clearly left things out. 

1. I used to want a girlfriend who could fit all roles, but in maturing I am finding I am a very independent person. She just so happens to naturally fit a wide variety of roles, which is part of what makes this decision so much harder. She doesn't (and hasn't) provoked me intellectually, but I don't mind that. I have books and friends who challenge my viewpoints and prod my growth in that sense. When I look at my own life, two things are very important: growth spiritually (and this means in a very broad sense. I am very open and curious about all sorts of developing this particular aspect of my life), and sharing that growth with an intimate partner. I understand that women (as a generality) prefer stability, but I am consistently seeking out new ways of looking at things and adapting my world-view whereas she is more grounded.

2. I do seek spiritual challenges elsewhere, and am very excited to share them with her, but she responds in a way that makes me believe she is concerned about the direction I'm headed. I feel this can cause resentment later on in the relationship on her end, but I'm just not sure. While I do not voice to her that I've considered her notions, it is possible that she picks up on that vibration as she is an intuitive woman. To answer the question, though, we are not particularly intellectually compatible. She's smarter than the average person, but I'm definitely the smarter one in the relationship. I know she looks up to me and also looks for guidance on logical paths, which I readily provide. I'm not trying to sound conceited or anything, but it is fairly obvious within the relationship. Don't get me wrong, she definitely provides me with wisdom in other aspects on how to handle my interactions with others. She always has a bit of wisdom to offer, which is attractive to me. I'm not saying it's a bad thing that she doesn't intellectually challenge me. I would almost prefer to be in a relationship where my partner is looking to me for council in intellectual/ logistical affairs.

3. I am very happy and satisfied within the relationship. Part of my newfound philosophies include being content to be by yourself, which I am. I don't rely on her to make me happy. I make my own genuine happiness and project that to her whenever I can, and I can tell she enjoys being around a genuinely positive masculinity. I worry for her, instead, that she will be displeased. She seems to be concerned about my salvation and our children, although she makes it clear that she still wants the relationship.

4. Yes, that is exactly what I mean to say. However, I should add that I plan to incur a small amount of income as well as form strong bonds with locals in the town so as to move toward a trading currency (my skill for your good. My good for your good. etc) as opposed to a federal note currency. Being a crafty man, I know I could make this lifestyle work and still provide for a family. Internet is not extremely important to have in my future, but I suppose it's something to consider. However, I am trying to phase it out of my life. 

In response to your last few questions, she has voiced several concerns about that lifestyle:

-Moving away from family and friends would mean ""starting over."" A problem for her (an introvert) but not for me (an extrovert). We would also be moving to a location owned by some of my family, which makes the move even more comfortable for me, but not so much for her.
-Living off the grid would involve a lot of change. Lots of the comforts she previously enjoyed would be sacrificed. To me, this is the preferred method because of my opinions about climate, humanity, etc. (not asking you to adopt these opinions, merely offering them to help you better understand the situation).
-Christian community is important to her and the location we'd be moving to doesn't exactly cater to that. It is not as important to me, and I've voiced this to her. I think she wants me to change or something, but I can't bring myself to pretend a certain spirituality which no longer stimulates my spiritual growth.

Again, I really appreciate the response and I look forward to hearing from you again! It's a strange situation!

265,"It was a calm night. I slowly turned the  knob on my oil lamp until my cabin was dimly lit. The men were tired and strained for having labored without reward, yet the promise of tomorrow's catch and the warm beds that awaited us upon making harbor next fortnight filled us with hope. I rested my weary eyes, wishing to gather at least a few hours rest before that shining slaver rose low in the sky and bid us wake. Not a moment later, I heard it... The low, resounding bellow. I knew my men had heard it, too.. For how could they have not.. Yet I told myself that, nay, this was just another trick of that vast sea. Another challenge, another mockery of my tired soul. And then, as if to confront my very sanity, it came again... If a volcano could yawn, and a demon roar, and God himself send thunder down; all of these could not compete with the sound that bid me dress again and climb from my chambers. The waters were calm. The sky was still. And then it came again.. Louder, still. The men were beginning to stir.

""Captain, is that what I think it is?"" Said my first mate, Donovan. He was fumbling with his pipe, and looking toward the horizon. ""Are we come to meet our maker, now?"" He turned to look at me.

""Aye.""

I faced eternally forward. For how could I look him in the eye? How could I look at any of them, lest I riddle myself with guilt? Surely, I had damned them all... And such a fate to meet, at last. Collapsing in our own fatigue. Raised from our slumber for the fetid musk of death was upon us. It bellowed again, and this time the ship revered the call. We began to sway with the sea, as the ship became increasingly subjected to the creature's sound.

And then I saw it. Dim, at first, but certainly the creature that had made the call. It appeared as a light of solemn ruby on the horizon, flickering beneath the waters. I saw it approach our lady fair, and the men who hadn't joined me on the deck before were surely there now asking about the commotion.

Some manned the harpoons, and readied the cannons. 

""Make your peace,"" said Donovan, ""for the beast has chosen us, and try as we might, its call must be met.""

The men unwillingly stowed the equipment and joined the rest in still, quiet reflection.

The red light was bigger, now, and approaching faster. No one knew for certain what we were about to face, only that it bridged the gap between this life and the next. I closed my eyes and entered a trance, within of which I saw my life. Those I loved. My beautiful wife and children eagerly awaiting my return home. The letters I'd written that will never be sent. The failures and successes over the years..

I was rudely awoken from my peaceful leave when the creature struck our ship at last. Several men were surely dead from the impact. I found myself gasping for air, and plunging into inky depths. I swam toward what I thought was up, determined to see the sky once more before embracing that eternal darkness. Instead, mine eyes perceived a sorry sight of blood, and wreck, and  graveness. Our fair lady stood no chance against the mighty beast with crimson eyes.

It was the first time I'd seen it clearly, and I knew it would be the last. Everything had happened quickly. The beast turned its great, gnarled head to meet my gaze. I swam in place, helpless and infantile before the mighty, abhorrent sight. It's eyes were nearly half the size of our ship, and its snout larger still. Rows and rows of dripping teeth extended forever backwards into its throat. It reeked of death, and the charred remains of burning flesh. Its great tentacled arms approached my helpless body. I was wrapped up tightly and felt the air proclaim its final departure from my body. I looked the creature directly in the eyes. Satan himself couldn't wish for a more fearful pet. Soon, my vision was filled with darkness and terror. And then.. A lasting peace.

Whenever I pooped I liked to play my Gameboy. However, this time I had left it at home. I started observing the bathroom to pass the time instead. Right next to me, I saw a string that looked like one of those strings on a window to lower and raise the shades. Like any other 8 year old kid would do, I yanked on that thing. A soft ding followed the pull and within 2 min I heard 2 voices I hadn't heard before pounding on the door and shouting. I was like, ""dafuuuuuu."" Then I looked down and and saw a piece of paper above the string that said, ""Pull for assistance."" Then I heard some keys working on the lock and not a moment too soon proclaimed, ""No! I'm ok! Don't come!""

305,"On mobile. Idk if these are the best examples of where to start, but this youtuber mentions thermal weaponry at some point. Not sure if it's in these. Most conspiracy videos can seem a bit silly and over the top, but if you just humor it and approach with an open mind you may be able to take valuable info away. I think these videos are more easily accepted if you already have a fundamental belief that the free masons, rockefellers, higher malevolent power, etc are running and controlling the world behind the scenes. I rejected this belief system for a very long time because it was easier. But honestly the more I read, watched, discussed, etc the more it just made sense that something bigger is happening. I knew someone who was making a documentary trying to expose some things about the economy and who runs it (but he wasn't quiet and secretive or anything) and he died under ""unresolved circumstances"" before the completion. My best friends dad had a website dedicated to exposing these things as well as how to prepare and he also died from an apparent heart attack. Perfectly healthy. I know it can be difficult to believe a complete stranger, so I won't try and convince you that these things happened in my life. Anyway, these videos may be a good place to start. Let me know if you have more questions and I will see if I can dig something up for you.
