I said I needed time and space, but definitely recognized the connection and wanted to pursue a longer relationship with this individual. We keep hanging out, keep talking. I am a very busy person and have a lot of projects I enjoy working on. I also work the awake night at work, which limits the amount of time we get to spend just lying next to one another. We've had lots of ups and downs, but overall it has been the healthiest relationship I've been a part of and we each push the other to grow in weird ways. We've been keeping things on the open-ended side of things (we can cuddle others, go on dates with others, but only have sexual relations with one another). I have been less inclined to define the relationship because it tends to lose the spark after that, however we recently decided we wanted to be partners. I like the term because it's not gender-exclusive and it manifests an idea of a team in my mind. I really like this person and I really enjoy thinking about her as a team-mate. 

Some more backstory: Been friends with this dude from high school for about 7 or 8 years now. We're basically best friends and have been through a lot. When I met my partner, he had actually already taken her on a date but she decided she was interested in me as far as long-term goes. 

So here's the stitch: we all live together (about 9 people total; we're a creative collective). I'm never there at night, my partner is, and so is my bestie. She has been cuddling with him who knows how often, but I'm assuming fairly often. This does not bother me, but recently I was approached by my pal and he asked if I would be interested in a poly-relationship. He said she had expressed interest (later she told me that when they talked she had told him she'd think about it) and he wanted to know what I thought.

Some things to keep in mind is that in her past relationships she was used for sex. Our sexual relationship has been more intentionally focused on love, growth, and tantric principles. I know for a fact that my bud does not want to nurture anything with her and just wants the sex. She has voiced (to me, at least) that she does not want sex with him, but just wants to cuddle. Personally, that sounds like BS to me because why consider the poly-relationship if it adds nothing more to your life..? But anywayyyyy...

So we have this kind of weird situation going on where I know she's into my bestie, he's into her, and I'm just kind of sulking and feeling sorry for myself. I want to just hold her and tell her I love her, but I also want to distance myself as much as possible and just start the healing process of getting over her. I want her to be happy. I know that sex for the sake of sex is not going to make her happy, but I also don't want to hold her back from what she wants. She says she wants to be with me. She wants more of my time, but I feel like I'm giving so much of it to her already. Maybe I'm not, but I will need to sincerely look at my time and see where I can improve. I want to run away, I want to scream into a pillow, and I want to just curl up and cry. I'm not always like this!! I'm so often the light of the room, the guy you go to when you need some advice. But this really shook me... I feel like I'm not enough for this girl... I feel exhausted, but feel like I need to be giving more...

I've been building on this relationship with her for months. Only recently did I decide to open up to her, become vulnerable, and commit, and only recently did this all go down /: Any advice is helpful. Thanks.

But who's to say that ""the powers that be"" just picked Hillary and Trump in a raging effort to get the people pushed so far that they can put in the puppet who they really want (Bernie?)? He does support the war in Afghanistan, btw, just behind the press.. So his progressive actions kind of lose their shimmer to me because I wonder who is really paying these people? Is the whole thing just made up? Who do you trust? Do you just go crazy and feel like the gov. is out to make your life miserable and take over the world if they can? Have they already taken over? How do we ever trust anything ever? Couldn't /r/conspiracy be driven by a group of people thrusting disinformation out there? Can I even trust the responses people give me in this thread? While these thoughts are not swarming in my head 24/7 I find them bubbling up every now and then. They don't control my actions, as I am a very loving, trusting person. But I still don't like the sense of fear and mistrust that comes along with going deeper and deeper into the conspiracy realm...

Usually, the sensations are not all over my body at the same time. I typically will get sensations maybe in my legs or lower back. I get tingles on my spine as well as my scalp, neck, and arms. They are frequent (at least 2-4 in an hour; lasting at least 5 mins each). There is no numbness associated with the tingling. Have you ever listened to a song that just struck you and you got goosebumps all over? It's like that, but isolated and pretty ongoing. A little background is that I have been meditating fairly frequently and sometime recently had an experience where it felt like my body was vibrating even though I was completely motionless and relaxed. It was like sitting on one of those vibrating massage chairs except it was just me and my body in silence. And these vibrational sensations felt just as authentic and real as if I were sitting in that massage chair. It wasn't as if there was some imagined sensation that COULD be called a vibrational feeling. It feels like someone is massaging my scalp all the time.

A bit about a ""soul connection"" or ""twin flame."" I met my twin flame about 1.5 months ago. I was dating this girl, we'll call her Sammy. Well, Sammy and I had started dating in the late summer of 2015. I was a defined Christian and so was she. The relationship was very respectful and healthy. However, recently I started going through some extreme spiritual realizations that I simply couldn't ignore. I told her I could no longer label myself a Christian as she did. This obviously caused a negative response from her and essentially we had to break up because of it. Before the break-up I told myself that if we did break up then I would need to be on my own for awhile. I needed to grow and learn etc. and I was set in my ways about that. Anyway, a day before we broke up with her, I meet ""Kayla."" Kayla and I are hanging out all night with mutual friends and we keep making eye contact on accident. You know when you looked at your twin flame for the first time? It's like lightning or something... Like you've known them forever. Well anyway, since I was in a relationship I dismissed it and went on but I couldn't help but think, ""Who the frick IS this girl??"" So Sammy and I break up and Kayla came back to go on a date with my best friend who was my roommate back then. I come back to the house from wherever I was, and I was so content to just be by myself and on my own after going through the breakup. Well, I hung out with my bestie and her and a few other pals all night. My bestie went to bed and he thought that she was going to leave, but she ended up staying up all night with me and my other pal. I had to go into work fairly early in the morning and she decided to wait at my house until I got back. We had talked at length for most of the night and it was just this incredible knowing... This ""coming home"" feeling. I didn't even know what a twin flame was, but that was how I felt and that's how we had described it.

 I was meditating in my room because I found that I couldn't sleep and I wanted to be productive with my awareness. I eventually got those same ASMR/ goosebump sensations on my body, but I got them all over my body and they were very intense. It wasn't as if I was vibrating like before. These sensations were very distinctly different. Anyway, I started to see flashes of yellow light that grew and grew until my field of vision was completely obscured in a vibrant, welcoming yellow. I passed through some barrier and entered into a space where clouds surrounded me on all sides. I remember being fully aware of my physical body, but in no way attached to ""being"" my physical body. The clouds were lit by the sun in the most beautiful way imaginable. I looked around for the sun, but could not find the light source (it was later suggested to me by Kayla that perhaps I was the sun in the vision). Within the vision, I had a sense of all-knowingness and I could sense the abstract natures of the vision. Anyway, as I was looking around at the clouds I noticed something start to emerge from them, and as it emerged I saw that it was Kayla and she was fully nude. Recently, I have been very invested in discovering how sexuality serves its purpose in my spiritual growth. What I've found is that my spiritual self is not ready to explore the beauty of a giving sexual relationship yet. In the past, I didn't really listen to this internal knowing, and my pursuits of lust only led to guilt and shame which is nothing that I want to feed my spirit. In other words, I've been more focused on spiritual growth recently than exploring a sexual relationship and it has been extremely fulfilling. Anyway, Kayla had come through the clouds nude and I felt no distinct physical desire for her, but rather an overwhelming appreciation for her beauty. Her eyes were closed, but in the knowingness of the vision, I knew she was looking at me not with eyes, but with presence, affection, and intention. Back in my physical body, I sensed my root chakra was spinning very fast. Then I noticed Kayla start glowing as if she was made of light. The light got more and more intense, until it reached a point where it was hard to look at her. Eventually the flare collapsed back into itself, and Kayla was floating there but she was middle aged now. Her hair was a dark brown, and long. She was wearing white robes, and she was facing me with a position of complete surrender, much like Jesus' position on the cross. She had a brass waxing moon crescent on her forehead, and she had six wings (which I later learn is similar to that of the seraphim concept. Kayla later informed me that twin flames can come as seraphim). The wings on her left side were completely visible, while the wings on her right side were completely invisible. While I looked at her in her surrender, I knew she was not just surrendering to me; she was surrendering to all. To everything that is. It's like the universe was telling me there's this unspeakably precious being that made a choice to surrender to me, but that I only fully acknowledged that surrendering because she was surrendering to not only me but to all that is. The vision ended there and I wrote down as much as I could but could not remember everything. While this vision is very encouraging to me, I am not allowing it to overwhelm my focus. I feel as if I was given a very special present by seeing this vivid display, and I acknowledge and accept it with open arms, but I don't let it dictate my future actions.

I adjusted it for my height and started walking with it. I noticed it was incredibly wobbly. Not suitable for holding the weight of anyone who would actually need to rely on it.

His eyes were piercing blue and seemed to illuminate whatever was in front of him. My eyes were closed after I'd seen him, but I could hear him come right up to me. I could literally feel him looking at me and somehow just kept my eyes closed, and kept completely still thinking, ""if I can't see him, he can't see me.""

Neither of us go to school there in real life. She was with two girls that I'd never met. For some reason they didn't want to take a car back to my house so we walked. We were going to meet up with my mom at my house and then get some pizza luce afterwards. When we got pretty close to my house, it started drizzling a little. In the dream, this was enough to cause us to seek shelter. There were only two buildings near us, and both were freemason lodges with people in them. As far as I could tell, all the guests were women and were very very wealthy. I pointed out that these buildings were freemason lodges and my SO gave me a look like, ""yeah I know."" Anyway, I don't particularly remember what led up to the next part. I found myself inside the building without my previous group. Instead, I was with my grandmother and a male friend who's identity I cannot recall in my waking life. I found an impractically long wooden cane, but it could collapse and become shorter. I adjusted it for my height and started walking with it. I noticed it was incredibly wobbly. Not suitable for holding the weight of anyone who would actually need to rely on it. Anyway, I found some stairs and started descending into the basement. I set the cane by a door leading to the outside world on my way down. The basement was cluttered with all sorts of things. Clothes, beds, metal shelves with items on them. It was a large enough room with several wooden posts for pillars, and the lighting was very dim; only being lit by 2 fluorescent bulbs. My grandmother had made her way down as well and indicated to me to follow her. We made our way through the mess to a corner that had a pile of clothes. We began sifting through them and she said, ""Better only take one or two. Less conspicuous that way."" She was talking about the clothes of course. It was as if we were shopping at a thrift stire or something, but we were really stealing which was understood later in the dream. As we were finding some clothes for me, my male friend found me and tried to scare me in the dark by shouting. Just after he'd done that, the first person from the party to address us (a female voice) shouted down the stairs, ""who's acting like that?! Don't you know... *mumble mumble mumble* What are you doing here in the first place? You don't belong here!!!"" Then I heard footsteps start coming down the stairs. My friend took off and I followed my grandma stealthily to a mattress leaning against a wall further along. She hid herself quite effectively and swiftly. I had more difficulty and the footsteps were getting louder and closer. There was plastic on the mattress so I was also making a bit of noise trying to get behind it. Eventually, my body was hidden, but my head was exposed. It was too late to try and hide anymore as I could see the person who'd come down the stairs and moving would just attract his attention.

Things I couldn't have known about in the past, but are now catching up to me. Or things that I wasn't expecting, but come out of nowhere. For example, I was in 6th grade the year that it was 666. My phone number has 666 in it. My license plate has 696 (I know, the 9 is upside down if we're going to call it 666 but it's still strange). I graduated high school (12th grade) in 2012, which was supposedly the end of a particular Mayan cycle. Throughout elementary school, I was alphabetically the 27th child in the class (27 is the number associated with death). I had never been afraid of death growing up, and was more-so welcoming it. Not that I wanted to die, but I have always thought of death as positive. My life path according to numerology is a 7 (spiritual growth), which I discovered after creating my username (no secret agent pun intended). I had also discovered my life path number after I had been dating this girl for sometime, but recently awoke to some really strange/ familiar spiritual energy. I expressed these overwhelming compulsions and feelings that growth must be pursued no matter what. She had been very dedicated to the Christian faith, and ultimately we had to break up. I had decided that I was just going to be alone for awhile. Take some time on my own and just grow. But literally the same week I broke up with my gf, I was introduced to a woman whom I later discovered I had a soul connection with. That's an entirely different line of synchronicities that confirm the soul connection, which I'd be more than happy to go into if anyone is interested. Also, months ago my roommate (who recently moved out) burned all of his occult books and items in a sort of fear after he rediscovered his Christian faith. Since then, he had let go of attaching to belief systems and became open to occult things once again. However, the bin that he burned everything in hadn't been cleaned out for the months since he burned everything and he only recently emptied it. At the bottom he found a corner of ""The Hermit"" card from his tarot deck that he burned. Everything else was ash but this tiny little corner that only says ""The Hermit."" He moved out recently and left that pinned up on my cork board before he left. He doesn't know about my username (which has seven in it) or my life path 7 (spiritual growth). I find it interesting that The Hermit is ""Soul-searching, introspection, being alone, inner guidance"" and he felt compelled to give me that without knowing 7's repetitiveness in my life. I am also one of 7 children. I have been seeing pentagrams, hexagons (apparently the shape of the singularity), 666, and other assorted signs everywhere. I've only recently started getting into meditation, and found somewhat of this ""zone"" you can get to where you start vibrating and these, like, light essences surge up and down your spine. I also snagged a free book from the library several years ago because I thought it had a funny name. I recently found that book, and it's incredibly applicable to where I'm at in life and what I'm interested it. I have no idea what any of these things mean, but just that they have happened. I have had experiences throughout my life of viewing spirits, and recently things have been moving/ falling on their own in my house AND at work. I'm not afraid of whatever is happening, because, like I said, I'm actually kind of excited to die. So if some cataclysmic event is on the horizon, I'm ready.

I was just enjoying the ride. I had been dating this girl, we'll call her Sally. Sally and I were both Christians about a year ago. However, once I found the spiritual path it resonated with me almost immediately and we no longer clicked. This disharmony had been going on for a few weeks and we decided we needed to talk. The breakup was as pleasant as breakups can be and we said our final goodbyes. I felt complete peace about the situation and was excited to keep growing. Then I met this other girl, Kasey. She had come over to my house with a friend of mine. We had been making eye contact on accident the whole night and never spoke a word, but something inside of me was like, ""What the heck... who IS this woman? Do you know her? It sure seems like you do... Is that even possible? Look, she's looking at you like she's having the EXACT SAME THOUGHTS...."" Well anyway, we spent some time together and never even had to verbally communicate that there was a deep connection going on that neither of us really understood. While I was working the awake night shift, I was listening to some Rupert Sheldrake lectures and YouTube had their suggested recommended videos on the right side of the screen. There was a bunch of science-type stuff (naturally, as Rupert is a scientist), but then this other video caught my eye. It was about twin flames. Something like, ""How to tell if you've met your twin flame."" I'd never heard of or used the phrase in my life and thought it odd that it should be included in the particular suggested video grouping so I thought, heh better check it out. Sure enough, the woman in the video described exactly what Kasey and I were going through.... I don't know it's all very exciting and intriguing. Like I'm talking to myself, but getting a whole extra unique perspective on things. I don't typically fall in love fast, and this is more than a love. It's this really indescribable knowing. My heart space feels like it's constantly whirring and my solar plexus has been increasingly active. Idk if those pertain to twin flames at all, but any guidance in this realm is helpful! Not sure how to handle the next few weeks/ months/ etc. Do we just let the flame connection flow or take it slow? I don't really feel any connection to my ex, either, which is strange. I don't typically move on so fast. I know it's not a rebound because I was so content after the breakup. And it's not even about just this crazy romance, either. I feel like Kasey and I have been friends for lifetimes upon lifetimes. It's really hard to describe and I've really never felt this way before",spirituality,I think I might have met my twin flame..

I have not been shy about where I stand, and she has voiced to me that she does not agree. She has expressed concerns about raising children when both of us do not agree on a spiritual path, and I have told her she has valid concerns. I really can't tell if this is going to be a long-term issue within the relationship. We haven't argued about it at all, but we have had several lengthy discussions where each party respectfully provides their input. We have a very healthy relationship overall. Another thing is that I want to live out of state and make steps to have my home be completely self-reliant (Alternate power sources, grow my own food, etc) and I am very adamant about making this happen. She still has an attachment to the Federal Note, which I am taking steps in my life to move away from, and is voicing a preference to live near a city and still be attached to the system in place (which I would also like, but to a lesser degree). 

On the plus side, out of all the women I've dated, she is by far the most exquisite. She is respectful and doting. I can tell she admires me, and I ensure she knows that I admire her as well. We are both very physically attracted to each other, and conversation flows easy. This decision is difficult because while both of us see nothing really wrong about the other person's personality and the way they carry themselves, neither of us can fully encourage the other spiritually. Where I encourage her, she disagrees (possibly due to an ingrained up-bringing). Where she encourages me, I have already considered her notions and don't feel like I'm learning or growing. 

Another thing is that recently we have been talking about marriage. We already have a venue planned for September (which cost $500 deposit) and I was planning on proposing within the next 3 months. I haven't bought a ring yet, but its purchase is currently planned into my budget. However, my philosophies have changed even more recently.

So that's where Reddit comes in, I suppose. What should I ask her to consider? What do I need to consider myself? What sorts of things should I bring up in our next conversation?

I just wanted to know more about this particular, arguably heavenly plant. Has anyone had a mescaline trip? What is it like? Does anyone harvest their own or grow the cactus for a hobby? How hard is this cactus to grow? What is the most efficient way that individuals consume this drug? 

I've read a little bit about the preparation, but I was wondering if anyone would know all of the ways this is prepared? I met someone from a small country who grows this. His particular method is to grind it into a small, fine powder after dehydrating the cactus. Do people find this method more or less potent than the traditional boil method? Do people normally just consume the powder outright? Is it smokeable? Would boiling the powder to infuse it into a tea (for 8+ hours, according to my research) lessen any potency the cactus had carried?",Drugs,Some questions about mescaline/ san pedro/ huachuma.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3szkfs/some_questions_about_mescaline_san_pedro_huachuma/
