0,"&gt; **How do they support that round-the-clock cloud infrastructure with so little income?**

AstroPrint makes money by licensing their software with printer manufacturers. Meaning, there are printers out there that contain 'plug and play wireless capabilities' with their own branding that actually run Astroprint. This is one way they make money. The other way is via their API / app store. If you create a 3D Printing app on their app store and decide to charge people for it, they'll take a 30% cut (like the apple app store). That's the gist of their business model. 

&gt; **Should I be worried about AstroPrint phoning home often?** 

Welcome to 2016. Do you use the Internet? Do you have a smartphone? Do you use Google? all of those know much more about you than your closest friends or family. If you are against this, might as well not use technology. 

&gt;**How can I secure it so that it doesn't get brute forced from the WAN?**

You can password protect the Astrobox to prevent unauthorized access. 

&gt;**I'm not inclined to like or trust IoT enabled devices. I like to play with fun things on my LAN. And it sounds like if I decide to block AstroPrint from the world, it won't be able to do it's job any longer. That being the case, can you quell some of my concerns?**

You can still use the Astrobox locally (without it's cloud) -- but then you'd have to upload pre-sliced GCODE file(s) directly to the Astrobox instead of using the cloud slicer. 

I think your perception of life being private is completely overblown. It's like people who are afraid of going Sky Diving but drive to work everyday, even when driving is statistically
far more dangerous than Sky Diving (adjusted per capita).


If you are a geek that likes to tinker around, configure and geek out, go for Octoprint. If you want a simple, plug and play solution with a nice interface, go with Astroprint :)",2016-11-21 21:23:09+00:00,daa2935,3.0,t1_da9x4fo,6062.0,3Dprinting
1,"I use Astroprint. 

A lot of people compare Astroprint with Octoprint without realizing some subtle differences between the two..

For example...Astroprint has:

1.) **Faster Slicing**: Once the file is up in the cloud you can re-slice the file (for higher/lower quality) with any combination of settings you'd like as preferences change. Why would someone want to do this? Many people end up tweaking and experimenting with various settings that require re-slicing. AstroPrint has powerful dedicated machines reserved JUST for high-speed slicing, machines that are many many times faster and powerful than home computers or laptops. You can also do this from anywhere around the world without the need for software

2.) **Custom Manufacturer Presets**: The AstroPrint slicer has fine-tuned settings for most printer manufacturers PRE-BUILT into the system so that you don't have to worry about googling and tweaking settings to match the best configuration. Not only that, AstroPrint works with manufacturers directly in obtaining these settings and allow them to tweak settings directly. Also, if these optimal settings change in the future, no worries, AstroPrint automatically updates those settings so you can focus on printing cool stuff.

3.) **Remote File Management**: Once the file is in the cloud, you can slice the file remotely from anywhere. As a bonus, you can also monitor the print live (with a camera) and also start/stop the print if necessary.

4.) **Simpler to use**: It's super accessible for non-technical users. Advanced settings are still accessible for advanced users, but there's nothing simpler than AstroPrint in terms of UI/UX and it will only get easier to use.

5.) **Automatic Updates**: Software &amp; security updates are done automatically. The average user does not have time to worry about software/slicer updates &amp; security issues. When critical updates are available for the slicer, AstroPrint takes care of all of that so users can focus on printing stuff.

6.) **Plug &amp; Play Slicing Engines**: The slicing engine is modular. Meaning, with a click of a button you can use Cura or Slic3r and in the future, other slicing engines can be added easily like lego blocks.

7.) **app store / API**: AstroPrint has an app store. When the API is open, anyone can submit apps to the APP store that interacts with the AstroPrint cloud platform. This gives you the option of enhancing your 3D Printer at will, with one click. Work in a library and want an app that will help you manage users and access to a single 3D Printer? There's an app for that. Need a premium app with a cutlery kit designed by a french chef? There's an app for that. You get the idea.

With that said, Octoprint is still great -- *especially* if you are a geek that likes to tinker around with stuff. 

If you have kids who'd like to get into 3D Printing OR you are a non-technical person interested in having a plug and play solution with a simple interface, AstroPrint is the way to go.

56,"Yup, you absolutely can. Happiness, like misery, is 100% a choice. (with the rare exception of folks who have serious chemical imbalances). 

No need to ""force"" anything, you can be happy for absolutely no reason whatsoever. 

**Example**: One could be in a really tough position in life with nothing to be happy about, yet just being aware of the simple fact that you have defied odds to have been born human and are currently alive in arguably the best time in the history of mankind is enough of a reason to laugh out loud.

If you are one of those folks who don't believe that *you can be happy ""for no apparent reason""* - I urge you to think about it a bit more. 

If you still can't come to the conclusion that happiness requires no special conditions, please read a book or watch an interview by any holocaust survivor (like [Elie Wiesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Wiesel) or [Viktor Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl)) -- and you will find that 'unconditonal happiness' is always an option.

For example, Viktor Frankl has said that, while he was in a concentration camp, when most folks were in dire straits, he managed to find happiness even in a single blade of grass. 

As for OP's post, I wholeheartedly disagree about this: 

&gt; The days really start to fly by when you're working full time and you're going to have fewer and fewer opportunities to see your buddies from school or college **as the number of responsibilities you have increase**.

Why increase the number of responsibilities, to begin with? I have zero interest in doing that. Life is much more flexible and I have much more mobility when I have engineered my life to have as few responsibilities as possible. 

There was a woman working in hospice/palliative care once, and she interviewed many many folks who were just about to die what their regrets were, and one of the biggest regrets were: **I wish I hadn't worked so much**.

It's a good reminder for all of us. ([See other regrets](http://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/))

**Bonus**: I also recommend studying folks like [Edward Bernays](https://www.amazon.com/Edward-Bernays/e/B004MPHV92/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1470607117&amp;sr=1-1), [the field of evolutionary psychology](https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/RK3XLI47G2FY), and watching the documentary [Century of the Self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s) for getting a broader understanding of human nature.

At the end of the day, don't fool yourself by giving yourself false confidence about your social engineering skills because you studied any of the above. Social engineering, by definition, requires social interaction -- the list above is designed to act as a complimentary study guide if anything. If given the chance between social interaction or reading a book about it, always take the former option. 

There are plenty of great social engineers/folks who understand human nature at a very deep level without having read anything because they've spent so much time interacting, observing and thinking about their experience(s).

It's a lifelong pursuit, really.

65,"Well, I've personally learned A LOT about sales and social engineering through hanging out with mormons. I sort of went undercover pretending to be curious about Mormonism and spent about 6 months (of once or twice a week) of hanging out with their missionaries. Keep in mind that I had already read (and applied) a lot of classics in social engineering prior to this experiment -- Like Kevin Mitnick's stuff, Cialdini, Spy the Lie etc, so one could say I had a decent framework of analysis of behavior. 

Even with this knowledge, I found my self in situations where these missionaries were able to gain compliance and overcome resistance with me. This would always baffle me because, I could SEE what they were doing, but still complied because their tactics were so effective. Another reason this baffled me was because, these were 21-23 year old women who were NOT that sophisticated. A lot of them grew up in small towns and in a tiny bubble and here they are (in California, where I live) doing a fantastic job with converting folks into Mormonism. 


Long story short, after a lot of research, I found out that before their 'mission', they get sent to a place called the Missionary Training Center (MTC) where much older folks teach them really sophisticated/effective techniques on overcoming objections/resistance. They've done it for so long that they've managed to distill down the best techniques into a polished, refined framework that they teach these missionaries. It's social psychology at it's finest in my opinion. 

One of my favorite techniques they use is something called the 'Commitment Pattern'. If you do decide to go this route, never give them your real phone # or address as they will hound you forever.

82,"Actually, I disagree. I use Instagress on ~8 different accounts with great results.

Here's my advice:

1.) For the first two weeks, make sure it's on SLOW MODE

2.) Have 10-20 NEUTRAL comments that would work on any picture (Great!, Thumbs Up etc..)

3.) Don't follow anyone through Instagress. Because this could get out of control. If you want to follow highly relevant accounts, do so manually.

4.) Make sure you have an extensively researched, and relevant list of hashtags in your instagress bot

5.) DO NOT interact with any account that doesn't have a profile name, profile picture or a decent amount of pictures. (There's a setting for this)

6.) After 1-2 weeks of SLOW MODE, increase it to NORMAL MODE. Then never speed it up to FAST, always keep it in NORMAL.

7.) Post new content at least 2-3 times per week. Experiment with video and the Boomerang app. 

8.) Every 3-4 months. Stop activity and add in more hashtags to your database.

9.) Finally, when people comment or ask questions, engage with them. Also, tag other relevant accounts with relevant content and ask to cross collaborate. 

This is essentially how I use Instagress and I have no complaints.",2016-07-12 22:14:34+00:00,d59t677,5.0,t1_d59jk9l,12571.0,Entrepreneur

92,"&gt; The submission and review process is basically a big ""FUCK YOU"" thrown by them into every willing developer's face.

All the frustrated/angry comments on this post fail to realize the obvious motivation of Instagram to take care of their own users.

Think about this: Having developers build APPS on top of Instagram is actually VERY beneficial to Instagram in terms of expanding their reach, so developers, by definition are THEIR FRIENDS.

So, why would they do things like this? (i.e: Kill off certain functionality on the API or certain types of APPS).

It's simple. **It's in the best interest of their userbase**.

Just because you cannot think of a reason why your APP would get killed, don't dismiss the fact that it's likely due to the best interests of their own users. 

For example, A couple of years back, Facebook users started to complain about various gaming apps sending them (most of whom were NON-GAMERS) notification(s). This actually decreased engagement ON FACEBOOK by these users -- so, in the interest of sustaining engagement on Facebook, they increased the restriction(s) of these APPS.

I know it can be frustrating, but you have to think about this whole thing from THEIR perspective. 

There are **EXCEPTIONS** to this rule, however. For example, at the time of this writing, APPLE is increasing restriction(s) on the SPOTIFY APP by forcing them to use their own in-app payment system where APPLE gets a cut (among other restrictions). Spotify wants users to set up payment information on their website so it's cheaper for them and they keep most of the profit. APPLE is using all sorts of other restrictions on Spotify. This is **NOT OK** as APPLE MUSIC is a direct competitor to SPOTIFY.",2016-07-05 15:30:06+00:00,d502oj9,2.0,t1_d4zsmhj,22949.0,webdev

Absolutely! Please let me know anything and everything :) I want to make it as helpful as possible!

- **Arthur Schopenhauer**

Most of our lives are so mundane and boring that, our voyeuristic tendencies get stimulated to an insane degree (at the breakneck speed gossip travels through the internet). We like to be entertained, and let's be honest, there's some entertainment value in seeing Kim Kardashian Twerking versus [Peter Higgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Higgs) talking about quantum mechanics. The former is a bit like the Fast Food version of entertainment -- it's perfect for the average consumer: easy to digest, can get addicted etc.. The latter (i.e: Peter Higgs) would be like a super high end steak house (i.e: [Peter Lugers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Luger_Steak_House)) -- it requires a certain degree of sophistication etc.

1.) A considerable number *How To's* require videos at a very minimum. (i.e: How to Swim, How to Bench Press, etc..). Therefore, having a database of How To's in text format makes it very challenging for the end users learn stuff. Including me.

2.) I maybe in the minority, but I rarely waste time Googling for stuff. I find most things fairly quickly. Also, I can **literally learn almost anything** from YouTube. This will only improve in the future (i.e: number of videos)

3.) The problem is **discovery**. For example, there's a fuck ton of YouTube videos and Podcasts. Most of my favorite creators on both mediums are *unknown* because I have *no idea* how to find any of them. The only way I find podcasts or YouTubers is if someone refers me to them. What I am trying to say is that, there's a HUGE **DISCOVERY PROBLEM** on the internet. And it will only get much worse as times goes forward. If you could solve this problem instead of just compiling a database of How To Do Stuff, I think I would personally find it much more helpful. 

Also, I personally would *never* read a couple of pages from a How To website to do serious shit like *How to raise a seed round* etc.. I would just get a book written by someone who's done that many times (i.e: Brad Feld etc.)

260,"&gt; but a podcast takes a *bit more* effort

That doesn't negate the fact that the internet will be *saturated* with podcasts like blogs. Keep in mind that majority of the people in the world are *not even on the internet* yet.

Also, with the ubiquitous nature of cell phones, it won't be that hard to produce a podcast at all. 

I would argue that blogs are HARDER to produce because you don't have the benefit of having a 'regular conversation'. You actually have to THINK about what you are going to write and type it all out in a cohesive manner. 

Overall, this is good for the internet. More competition = higher quality of shows.

Here's why: It's extremely difficult and time consuming to build an engaging facebook following and it is nearly impossible to gain organic traffic to your posts -- unless you pay for *boosts* or *run ads*. The other thing is, even if you spend money on ADS and gain a ton of ""likes"" -- engagement is likely going to be low. We've spend $15K on facebook to gain new users for a SaaS product (which works OK), but out of the 7-8K people that have 'liked' our page, very few engage.

289,"&gt;It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use it. - **Seneca**, [*On The Shortness of Life*](http://www.amazon.com/Shortness-Life-Penguin-Great-Ideas/dp/0143036327)",2015-12-27 22:32:46+00:00,cyd5t1m,1.0,t3_3yfznr,1804.0,Entrepreneur

291,"Here's what I do ...

1.) Find an IG account you want to model -- not necessarily by followers, but by *engagement*. Then make a list of the top #hashtags used *by them*. The more you do this, the more accurate &amp; relevant your list of keywords will become. Remember, you are going after *engagement* &amp; *relevancy* to what you are doing.

2.) Seed your account with at least 20-30 super high quality pictures. Things that are actually useful to people. Then use the maximum amount of relevant keywords on each picture. You can use the list you generated previously for inspiration. The maximum amount of #hashtags should be fine, but if you are feeling frisky, you can actually comment on your own post and add more #hashtags.

3.) Sign up for an account on [Instagress](http://instagress.com) and upload the list of keywords you compiled earlier. Set the speed to *Normal*. *Disable* following. *Disable* interacting with the same users. These will all help you prevent getting flagged as spam etc. 

Instagress basically interacts with highly targeted users 24/7. A small percentage of these users will come check your profile out, then follow you -- which is what you want because growth will look organic and it will be relevant to the users that follow you, which in turn will increase engagement. 

As for the #hashtags: it should be refined/improved every few weeks -- so pay attention to the most relevant #hashtags. Also, the more specific a #hashtag, the better. Keep it hyper specific. For example: *#SingleDadsWhoLoveCats* is much better than *#Cats*.

In any case, here are my top 3 recommendations:

1.) [The Essential Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Writings-Emerson-Library-Classics/dp/0679783229/)

2.) [The 48 Laws of Power](http://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197/)

3.) [The Autobiography of Malcolm X](http://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Malcolm-Told-Alex-Haley/dp/0345350685/)

Also, *Influence* by Robert Cialdini is *excellent*. One of my favorites.

A little cautionary warning about asking people for recommendations though: Be careful about following other people's lists because those book won't vibe with you the same way. Each of us had our own unique life experiences, so you should be ideally choosing your own books. Lists are good for clues/inspiration though. Frequently, books choose *me*, not the other way around.

Also, try to keep track of the books (and knowledge) you read. I keep a single page HTML page with all the books I read along with a short note in reverse chronological order.

321,"Congrats man. One of the things that BJJ forces one to do is *be present*. Yoga, Buddhism, Meditation, and countless other spiritual avenues make *being present* one of the central tenants for a reason -- except those are A LOT more fucking difficult than something like BJJ because, you can't help but be present when a grown man is manhandling you. 

When you first start BJJ, you don't really have much of a grip on the Fight or Flight response, but after a while, pattern recognition kicks in -- then, you being to slowly adapt and actually enjoy the process. 

Then it becomes a never ending game that's impossible to master.

Each door you open leads you to another door. *Indefinitely*.

It is very analogous to life and the adversity we will all experience in our short time on this little blue planet.

Also, humans are hardwired to belong to a community. This is why lonely/lost people often make great targets for cult leaders. The interesting thing is that, with all the technological advancements, a lot of us are *simulating community* via social networking sites and the internet. It's still not enough.

Think about your cell phone for a second. If you stare at your phone (in it's default state, while it's off or on stand by), what do you see? you *see yourself*. Every time you hit that power button to communicate with someone or browse the web, you are metaphorically escaping that reflection --- escaping yourself.

This is why one of the reasons why BJJ has a powerful effect on people. It satisfies a hardwired *need for community*, it *gives purpose* to the purposeless and finally, *it proves without a doubt* that you can overcome adversity. When you do BJJ long enough, all of these factors begin to reinforce themselves and snowball -- leading to a genuinely improved human being.

It's not Kim's fault she's drawing $45M/Year -- rather, that's just a reflection of the product's (i.e: Kim) consumers (i.e: us). Good for Kim.

438,"I've used both Octoprint and AstroPrint. They are both solid, but I settled on AstroPrint for these reasons:

1.) **Faster Slicing**: Once the file is up in the cloud you can re-slice the file (for higher/lower quality) with any combination of settings you'd like as preferences change. Why would someone want to do this? Many people end up tweaking and experimenting with various settings that require re-slicing. They have powerful dedicated machines reserved JUST for high speed slicing, machines that are many many many times faster and powerful than home computers or laptops.

2.) **Custom Manufacturer Presets**: The AstroPrint slicer has fine tuned settings for most printer manufacturers PRE-BUILT into the system so that you don't have to worry about googling and tweaking settings to match the best configuration. Not only that, They (AP) works with manufacturers directly in obtaining these settings and allow them to tweak settings directly. Also, if these optimal settings change in the future, no worries, they automatically update those settings so you can focus on printing cool stuff.

3.) **Remote File Management**: Once the file is in the cloud, you can slice the file remotely from anywhere. As a bonus, you can also monitor the print live (with a camera) and also start/stop the print if necessary.

4.) **Simpler to use**: It's super accessible for non-technical users. Advanced settings are still accessible for advanced users, but there's nothing simpler than AstroPrint in terms of UI/UX and it will only get easier to use.

5.) **Automatic Updates**: Software &amp; security updates are done automatically. The average user does not have time to worry about software/slicer updates &amp; security issues. When critical updates are available for the slicer, AstroPrint takes care of all of that so users can focus on printing stuff.

6.) **Plug &amp; Play Slicing Engines**: The slicing engine is modular. Meaning, with a click of a button you can use Cura or Slic3r and in the future, other slicing engines can be added easily like lego blocks.

Pick your poison though, can't really go wrong with either ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

473,"&gt; Why? What advantages does cloud slicing have over local slicing?

Hey /u/PuffThePed!

Great question!

Most people on /r/3DPrinting are more technical than the average user (they are also early adopters etc.), so it maybe confusing to see the benefits of a cloud slicer like AstroPrint as opposed to using a slicer offline.

Here are some benefits of AstroPrint over running a local slicer.

1.) **Faster Slicing**: Once the file is up in the cloud you can re-slice the file (for higher/lower quality) with any combination of settings you'd like as preferences change. Why would someone want to do this? Many people end up tweaking and experimenting with various settings that require re-slicing. We have powerful dedicated machines reserved JUST for high speed slicing, machines that are many many many times faster and powerful than home computers or laptops.

2.) **Custom Manufacturer Presets**: Our slicer has fine tuned settings for most printer manufacturers PRE-BUILT into the system so that you don't have to worry about googling and tweaking settings to match the best configuration. Not only that, we work with manufacturers directly in obtaining these settings and allow them to tweak settings directly. Also, if these optimal settings change in the future, no worries, we automatically update those settings so you can focus on printing cool stuff.

3.) **Remote File Management**: Once the file is in the cloud, you can slice the file remotely from anywhere. As a bonus, you can also monitor the print live (with a camera) and also start/stop the print if necessary.

4.) **Simpler to use**: We want 3D Printers to be accessible for anyone (i.e: my grandma, dad etc..). Advanced settings are still accessible for advanced users, but there's nothing simpler than AstroPrint in terms of UI/UX and it will only get easier to use.

5.) **Automatic Updates**: Software &amp; security updates are done automatically. The average user does not have time to worry about software/slicer updates &amp; security issues. When critical updates are available for the slicer, we take care of all of that so users can focus on printing stuff.

6.) **Plug &amp; Play Slicing Engines**: The slicing engine is modular. Meaning, with a click of a button you can use Cura or Slic3r and in the future, other slicing engines can be added easily like lego blocks.
