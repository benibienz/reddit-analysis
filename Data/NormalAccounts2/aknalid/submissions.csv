Basically, I want to get a song called [Detour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GURA7a7g_tU) (by Patti Page) done as a cover...

The twist: It must be very close to the original rendition by Patti Page

With all sorts of audio effects, I figure it's possible to get that 'old sound' -- but the vocals might get tricky.

I just wanted to know how I should approach this? Where should I look for musicians that would match this criteria? How much would it cost?

The main reason I want to do this is because the Patti Page song is copyrighted and I want to use a 15-20 second segment of that song for a personal project without being afraid of a takedown notice.

A cover that I own would fix this problem (I think)

The show was GREAT.

I also bought a ticket for the Deathsquad show at 10:15 because I've seen their podcast (I watch/listen JRE exclusively) before...

Well, I was pretty damn disappointed. 

First of all, it wasn't a podcast, it was a bunch of 'deathsquad' comics doing individual sets. This is not necessarily a bad thing.

What made it bad is HOW BAD the show was. Out of 7 comics, 3 guys were pretty funny -- the rest were pretty much bombing.

My favorite part? *REDBAN*

I am only aware of REDBAN through JRE and seeing him in real life was an experience. First, He's a lot fatter and out of shape in person than on the podcast. You can FEEL how unhealthy he is..

Second, REDBAN's set was absolutely horrendous. I was literally sitting directly in front of him and cringing. He was likely trying new material, but he got zero laughs. When no one was laughing, he kept accusing the audience by saying ""*Wow, you guys so are tight..*"". He said this maybe 3-4 times. Granted, ANOTHER comic also said this later on -- but the Mexican guy had ZERO trouble getting everyone to laugh. I was howling. Also, it seemed like a expensive open mic than an actual 'special event' show. Finally, when all the jokes failed, REDBAN did his ""spider manning cum in hotel rooms"" bit to get a few shock laughs. I don't follow REDBAN at all and **I** know about this bit.

Overall, the ICE HOUSE was cool as fuck, but the whole experience went downhill pretty fast. Started out funny as hell, then ended up going to dog shit. 

The other downside is their TWO DRINK MINIMUM rule. I am all for it, but I bought tickets to 2 damn shows at once (~$30+) and had a great plate of food and two drinks on the first show (~$30) -- they shouldn't require me to buy another two fucking drinks on the next show (I bought two god damn water bottles for $10). That's a god damn stupid rule in my opinion. If a patron is buying tickets to multiple shows, you should NOT require them to adhere to a 4 DRINK MINIMUM.

1.) I would like to INVERT the two finger scrolling on my touchpad yet I don't see this option under SYSTEM SETTINGS. Ideas? The trackpad etc.. is not the smoothest it seems.

2.) I am switching from OS X (Yosemite) and have been using Truecrypt 7.0(a) extensively for years (Even with the PR scandal etc..). Can I get this exact version of Truecrypt on the software center?

3.) Anything I can do optimize battery, graphics/video performance etc...

4.) For a browser, I replaced Midori with Chromium (because all my Google Apps are tied to it) and plan on getting rid of most stock applications. I just need: VLC Media Player, A solid browser, a good photoshop alternative etc..

5.) Fingerprint reader -- how can use this thing?

6.) On chromium, how do I get rid of the title bar so I get more screen space?

So the original paper test can be [found online](http://www.mi-pte.org/sudppps2011/Shannon-PTSI.pdf).

It was originally designed by [Dr. Patrick Carnes](http://www.iitap.com/about-us/dr-patrick-carnes) and a guy named [David Delmonico](http://www.internetbehavior.com/services/consultants.htm).

I have found the test to be a pretty accurate indicator in terms of identifying areas of trauma in one's life. The test is 144 questions.

I basically took the [entire paper test](http://www.mi-pte.org/sudppps2011/Shannon-PTSI.pdf) and made an online version of it so people could easily take it and share it with people they care about.

I JUST got done with version 1 of the test.

You can find it at [traumatest.com](http://traumatest.com).

So far the actual accuracy of the test seems fine (based on a few rudimentary tests), but the User Interface/User Experience needs a lot of work/tweaking. This is fine because it's just version 1 :)

Can you guys help me improve this? Taking the entire 144 question test would be super helpful.

Keep in mind that the way it's setup right now, if you start the test, you cannot re-start it until you clear you cookies. I am going to add a ""reset test"" button later this week.

Is there a subreddit where users post local/international stories (or leads) that are compelling/important but haven't gained steam/mainstream attention for some reason?

In 1854 there was a physician named [John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow_(physician) who risked his own life by going into neighborhoods that were infected with cholera. He was hoping to test his hypothesis that *cholera was caused by unclean water* instead of *pungent smells or dirty air* as most doctors at the time believed. He plotted all the cholera related deaths on a map after going door to door and asking people. After studying his map with all the data plots, he found an anomaly: *a beer brewery without any cholera related deaths*. This is because the beer brewing process kills germs (an unknown fact at the time) and beer was heavily consumed by the brewery workers instead of water. This forced further investigation into the beer making process and fermentation, which eventually led to the discovery of germ theory.

Back then (Victorian London), it was safer to drink beer than water and it wasn't uncommon for people to drink 6-7 pints of beer *per* day.

Interesting huh?

We have a Purple Belt that allegedly came from a Gracie School. His skill level is that of a *high level white belt*. This has been confirmed over and over again.

Furthermore, he really believes that he is a Purple Belt. A few weeks ago, he entered into a tournament as a Purple Belt and got destroyed fairly quickly...in all 3 matches.

I am not sure if some gym/coach made a mistake and gave him a belt or if something is wrong with the guy.

3D Printing is getting popular fairly quickly.

I work with 3D Printing and I just realized there's only 1(!) BJJ related 3D Printable design on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=bjj&amp;sa=) (which is the most popular site for these types of designs).

Unfortunately, I don't really have CAD skills, but I *CAN* print them out. [This is what some of the prints look like](http://imgur.com/XDTHRIV). And here's a [time lapse of the actual print process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gaC5BpXljU).
