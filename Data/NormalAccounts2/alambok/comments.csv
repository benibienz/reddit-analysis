16,thanks! decided to get the tecnifibre. xamsa looks great but shipping was too ex to bite the bullet. helped me make my choice clearer i guess :),2016-01-24 18:57:53+00:00,cza8r9w,2,t1_cza6teb,3188,squash
17,to be honest it looks pretty good from all the positive reviews but I actually live in SEA region so the shipping seems to be a turn off from me. price diff from the prince is only about 10 bucks although I'm unsure about whether they provide free shipping internationally,2016-01-24 15:31:59+00:00,cza1pco,2,t1_cza13pc,1362,squash

Watch was given to me years ago and has been dumped in my drawer for almost a decade before I decided to take it out recently. Was thinking about doing a maintenance on it when it just chanced upon me that it might not be authentic at all heh.",2015-07-03 07:35:11+00:00,csqt5vq,1,t3_3byw4g,103,Watches
