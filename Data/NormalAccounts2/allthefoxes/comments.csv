The reality of the situation is that people are protesting because of Trump's promised right-wing policies that are anti-LGBT, anti-abortion, anti-climate change, etc...

Trump's position on issues is confusing, to say the least. The right wing does not highly value LGBT and womens rights, and is fairly anti-climate change issues. One of Trump's candidates for Supreme Court thinks that people who have gay sex should be imprisoned.

People are protesting to hopefully force Trump's hand (and to, well, protest. Who doesn't love a good riot sometimes) to move more toward the middle and get him to hopefully take a more central/left policy on the issues that matter to these people.

A lot of people here are going to downplay this, and I won't really comment on the methods of protest. But this is a protest after all, there isn't a wrong way to do it. People want to force Trump's hand.

I don't think it will work, but thats my own personal opinion.

A protest gets attention. Doing so makes people, and Trump, aware. Hopefully forcing his hand to stop the protests",2016-11-16 20:14:33+00:00,da377yc,2.0,t1_da31lk7,6784.0,pics

We also wanted to use this system to better handle sensitive information on a lower level. Modmail literally can never be deleted, making it not great for sensitive info. A very determined person could attack one of our many mod accounts and dig through quietly (2fa pls admins). While unlikely, its good to take forward steps.

To this end, the takedown team is just three trusted /r/pics moderators. Myself (I trust myself) and two others.

All takedowns go through an email which only I know the password to, and I technically don't know what it is, its over 100 characters long and the only way someone could get access to it is by [beating me with a wrench until I give them my master password to my password manager](https://xkcd.com/538/).

However, while Russia gets prepared, you also know the Americans and the French both want a piece of you. 

Russia is scary though, and you really want to hold China.

So, you could move ALL your troops to the Russian front to hold them off. That means everything else is left Undefended. Congrats, you held China but America scooped up literally everything else. 

You could move..half your troops to the Russian front   They get steamrolled and you're worse off than you started. 

Lastly, you could simply forget china. Let it get sacked, manage your troops , and grab it back when Russia gets distracted. 

Moderation is kind of like risk, in the sense that managing your moderators time (your troops) is really important. 

Some threads are just so moderation heavy that it's taking moderation time away from other important things. It's best to take a loss, lock the thread, and get back to the important stuff. ",2016-10-25 15:55:51+00:00,d975lza,1.0,t3_599zp7,26423.0,AskModerators

I simply don't have the people around my local area for this sort of thing. I browse roll20 for games that welcome new players, but I find 3 scenarios seem to happen:

1. The group welcomes new players, but is extremely ""hardcore"" into it. The description page is 16 pages long, requires you to sign up on some other website, have a certain book and knowledge of a certain edition.

2. The group welcomes new players yet the description page is 3 lines with zero capital letters and punctuation.

3. They welcome ""newer players"" and not ""brand spanking new"" players.

I've done plenty of research. I know DnD is not a very good ""sit down and play"" game..but thats what I would like to do.

2. The subreddit they are posting in has custom CSS that has a workaround adding subscript. This would only work on the desktop reddit site with CSS enabled. This is common in math subreddits and things of that nature.",2016-10-10 21:53:32+00:00,d8mgpnh,1.0,t3_56u6cj,5229.0,help

well, it wouldn't go on this list, the idea here is specifically against titles, but its been under some consideration as a seperate rule / change to rule one

939,"When I was in fourth grade, a classmate died in a tragic freak accident.

He was in the passenger seat of his dads pickup, they were driving back from a place that sold supplies, like wood, metal bars, that kind of thing.

As they drove down the street a block off from the school, a guy had his trailer lifted up on a jack. Right as they turned down, keep in mind this was..maybe a 35mph or 25mph zone. Jack falls and trailer kind of leaps out into the road a little. 

Dad slams on the brakes and hits the trailer a moment later.

In all the chaos, the unsecured wood in the back of the pickup flung forward, through the window in the back of the truck, and struck my classmate. Very hard. 

The little rumor was that he was beheaded, but I don't think thats true, I think it just sailed through the gap in the headrest and seat and cracked his skull or something.

The dad survived too with just some bruises, which is both good and really, really sad

968,"Hi everyone, I have to lock this thread. Most of our mods are asleep right now and we can't spend all our time babysitting one thread.

This kind of post is not against our current ruleset, though we are discussing our options.

*However* it is strongly strongly advised people consider posting to /r/petloss instead of /r/pics - This is something we are likely going to put in the sidebar while we discuss.

Regardless of all this information, we do happen to have a basic rule on civility. Not likeing the post (and commenting that you don't like it) is generally no issue. However we do ask that you not decide to call OP some pretty vile things, tell him to kill himself, etc.. 

On the other side of every screen, there is another human being.

---

As moderators, yes, we hear you. We also hear our silent majority. We are discussing some options however I cannot promise any results at this time. 

In the mean time, you can use a tool like [RES](/r/enhancement) to filter out any posts with a ""backstory"" flair

1031,"No actually, you didn't

The post that got you banned had nothing to do with what a moderator said.

A person posted in /r/modhelp saying that a moderator would not remove a post that had some personal information in it. Rather than tell the user to report this to the proper channels like /r/reddit.com, you decided to post this:

&gt;You deleted the account but if you see this post again, feel free to call the mod out on /r/[redacted] or /r/[redacted] or /r/[redacted].

Basically, you told that user that because a mod did something they didn't like, the proper way to handle it was to have them post to a few subreddits about how much this mod sucks. Literally the definition of inciting a witchhunt

---

So when you modmailed us, you said:

&gt;Was that this comment? I wasn't inciting a witch hunt, I was saying OP is free to document whatever the mod did on those subreddits I mentioned. Would adding a warning, that I don't condone harassment or direct contact of those mods, help?

and our reply was: 

&gt;&gt;I'm not the moderator who banned you, so here's my second opinion: ""feel free to call the mod out"" is almost a text-book case of inciting a witch-hunt. It's basically advising the OP to publicly name and shame the moderator in question (even if they are small low-traffic subreddits). It doesn't help that two of the subreddits you recommend are subreddits that you yourself have created for the express purpose of naming and shaming moderators (and which you're taking the opportunity to promote here?).
Adding a warning to not harass the moderator while retaining the advice to name-and-shame the moderator would be kind of contradictory: ""Name the moderator in these subreddits where other people can see their name and possibly harass them, but don't harass them!"" Yeah... nah.

---

Now, you are adult human being and are, for the most part, free to do as you wish. But in a help oriented subreddit, saying ""Go post here about how shitty this guy is"" is not an appropriate answer, nor appropriate behavior in /modhelp or any reddit help subreddit.",2016-10-02 19:48:17+00:00,d8b5wm7,5.0,t1_d8b2qio,3934.0,ModSupport

I have little interest to participate in this because its yet another subreddit I have to keep track of and yet another different project I might get to watch die.

Reddit is one large community all working together. Get everyone involved. Work with them, not for them. I feel like I talk about this so so often with every admin post.

Reddit behaves extremely traditionally. Let's make a product, put it on a plate, and serve it to the people! On Facebook that works, on Spotify, that works. On reddit..well it works, but it doesn't work well.

Don't be a 5 star french restaurant that brings us our food on a silver platter. 

Make the hypothetical food with us. Invite us into the kitchen. Not just mods. Everyone. Don't make reddit *for us* make reddit *with us*

1208,"Seriously though, this announcement is really vague. Why does there need to be yet another subreddit ^^^TM for this?

You have the platform right here. ModSupport is barely used for anything anyways.

I'm glad to hear the newbies are getting up to the job, but my issue kind of lies here:

* We’ve doubled our team size in the past 5 months

20 * 2 is 40

200 * 2 is 400

but both are double.

---

I've said this before and I will say it a million more times, in order for reddit to be more effective with its policies, you guys either need to higher way more people, which may not be possible (I'm not a businessman) or figure out some kind of *Global Moderator* system.

I've pitched this to a few people on the team and posted in IFTA a few times, I hope its at least on someones ""stuff.txt"" file. 

Your workforce is not enough to meet demands. Response times are getting better, I appreciate that. I usually get one within 72 hours. That is alright! But so so many admins tasks are incredibly trivial and minor. Just like reddit has split the idea of moderating communities into a large, distributed network of volunteers, the tools admins have need to be split further as well and distributed.

That, or hire more people I suppose.

1380,"I guess this all comes back to the now top comment on this thread. Why don't you guys let us try things, or announce things before doing them as much? 

Facebook and Twitter are **bad influcences** - I don't see why a site like reddit can't strive for better. Give people the chance and oppertunity to know whats coming. 

I can understand that you guys don't want the whole ""don't change it the old one looks better"" but reddit often just updates it like how Facebook writes their updates ""Thanks for updating, we write updates to make Facebook better for you""

Reddit has the oppertunity to step above that, be a role model in community interaction and site development. But reddit chooses to be yet another great silicon valley company that rarely interacts with its community. I apprciate that we get heads up about things that will inevitably cause things to break, but what about everything else. Keep people up to date, get feedback. Work alongside and with the community, not apart from them.

Reddit develops a product, and presents it to the users like a waiter serving a meal...I wish more sites would take the alternate idea. Come bring your users into the kitchen. Let us watch you make something. Let us tell you what tastes good or if something might not come out right. Don't make something for us, make something with us.

&gt;Why couldn't you just have left it alone?

Un fortunately, this is not the way the world works. Many volunteers work hard to improve the experience. No one can just work on something, call it finished, and forget it ever existed. That isn't how anything really works except ancient banking systems.

&gt;Or at least preserved backward compatibility?

Actually, most things work pretty well! However the problem lies here:

&gt;Updating Chrome beyond 49 just isn't a reasonable option for many.

This, this is the issue.

And I can sympathize, I really can. At work you may not be able to update chrome, you may have a computer that can't run it.

And I'm sorry, but realistically, in this day an age you need to stay up to date. Chrome 49 is over 4 releases back from the current. That's very far.

Now, chrome updates very rapidly, this SUCKS for a business environment..which is another problem itself. Newer versions of Chrome offer better security, new features, features which are being taken advantage of.

Things are being worked on, I promise

However, **you need things to be balanced** - If you would like new and modern software, you need to have the required up to date components. This rings true for cars, computers, software, anything really.

This can depend, but things like typos, small issues, anything that can just be easily corrected without much loss can be flaired. Things that are simply false are removed.

Yep, we have some ideas

&gt;What kind of automation, and to what extent?

This is more of a moderator thing than a public facing thing, but better tools for our Slack channel is helpful

Very high

You don't use much punctuaton, capital letters and sentence structure are not your thing. The way you word your sentences is definitely indicative to a ESL speaker, which you said you are. I believe that, I also believe your native tongue is possibly Urdu, Hindi, something along those lines.

However your title was **perfect** structure. Proper capitalization too.

 you then come to **my** subreddit /r/pics and posted:

Let's say you start on ""page one"", reddit.com

You read those posts, scroll down, and hit ""next""

You don't actually go to ""page 2"" -- What actually happens is that reddit takes the *last* post on ""page 1"" and calculates the next 25 posts to show you based on that last post.

And so on and so on. Doing this is what makes the Hot algorithim work, and also means there is far less server stress on reddit. Instead of calculating a whole bunch at once, it just does 25, takes the 25th post, does some math, and uses the 25th post to determine posts 26-50

I will admit I know little about marketing, but if you sell a product by angering a userbase, I don't see how that gets things done. Surely a few bridges have to get burnt, but I don't really see this as being effective enough to warrant this kind of blaze.

This all concerns me, since it either makes me think:

1. Reddit is desperate (so why are they starting an image service, growing staff, etc)

2. Reddit doesn't actually know *what* to do

3. Incompetency

4. I'm just not seeing this properly myself.

Has reddit outgrown traditional ads this much? 

Hell, I remember when the gold options got switched to completely blocking ads, rather than choosing which ads to block. I posted in IFTA that it should be opened back up since I and many others clicked on and didn't mind certain ads. And that was shot down. Reddit was offered more clicks by a dedicated userbase and shot it down.

Granted, this was a while ago. I just don't understand.

I don't really want to be the guy that says ""There has to be a better way"" without offering an alternative solution, but..There has to be a better way

I do that in a minor sense, since it is far far easier to follow labels, rather than follow artists.

I moderate a *lot* of subreddits. And the cabal I am apart of wouldn't even call it a lot. But I do.

When I was newer to moderating, I got a big stick up my butt about how things were run, how things are acted out, etc etc.

**And I still have that huge stick up my butt**

But one of the best things I learned that has helped me a lot in reddit moderation, in life, and well just about everything..is that it is okay to let someone else handle something.

Thank you for updating us and I am sure everyone apprciates it. This post will probably stop the 300 ""WHERE IS RELEASE"" posts that will be sure to follow.

You have made yourself known to make these threads and I know you take it up as your responsibility.

But, you gotta relax and not make it your responsibility **too much** - I'm not trying to shag on you here really at all.

But just because something is your responsibility doesn't mean it has to be a big deal all  the time.

I'm sounding like an asshole here and I really don't mean it this way, but whenever I see a meta post like this it always stops me for a minute.

alternatively, realize that people are cunts on the internet and sometimes its not worth getting your panties in a bunch over. But report any comments you feel that do break our rules and we can look. Though someone being a cunt isn't generally a removal reason. People have opinions that may not line up with yours, thats a beauty of reddit. 

I hate using this word, but I don't really believe in censoring people just because they have opinions that you or I think really suck. But apparantly some people with shitty opinions deserve to be ""censored"" and if the aren't censored you are going to just leave a shit on everyone's bed.

#FAQ

##Why isn't the One Link Rule in the sidebar?

###It's a niche case we work with content creators over. However it likely should be there

---

##Can you give some example posts?

###I would rather not, due to the sensitive nature of this content. 

---

##What do you mean manipulation?

###Vote manipulation specifically is doing things like using multiple accounts to upvote a post. Manipulation in general means..well..manipulation

---

You buy the card like you would any other PC component. Newegg, amazon, your local microcenter, etc..they just might be sold out a while at first

---

As for how the aftermarket works...basically..

AMD makes a GPU. Its got the chip on it, all its memory, the displays, a heatsink, a cooler, etc..Thats called a reference model

Companies like XFX, Sapphire, ASUS, etc. They buy many, many of these GPUs - But instead of using that cooler and heatsink that came with the card, they put their own on it.

In adition, they do thier own tests and overclock the good cards, and make a new ""version"" of them. Those chips can be overclocked out of the box to a stable place already, you don't have to do it yourself.

2421,"To detect a users account age, here is how it works:

1. You go to the comments page, of 200 comments

2. RES looks at each user and asks reddit, for each user, how old the accounts are

3. RES applies the filter, removes the comments, and the page is displayed

---

So, for 200 comments, we need to ask reddit 200 different things. how old each account is.

---

As for tagging, it goes like this:

1. You load the comments page

2. RES looks through its own database, and checks it against the usernames on the page

3. Any relevant tags are applied

---

So, when we want to know the age of a user, we have to ask reddit how old the user is

When we want to tag a user, we don't need to ask reddit anything

---

RES can only ask for something from reddit 30 times in one minute. (very simplified) We ask anymore, and everything breaks. 

Therefore, to detect the age of 200 users, we would need 200 requests. Since we can only do 30 requests a minute, we need 6.667 minutes to complete 200 requests

So, in order for this to work, every page would take 6.667 minutes to load, plus another .1 seconds for everything else. 

---

2. It's not! Compatability is rarely an issue if you know how to read! http://pcpartpicker.com offers full compatability checks

3. This doesn't really make sense to me, sorry. 

4. As I said above, pcpartpicker offers a pretty comprehensive compatability check. And no, opening the box doesn't mean your screwed. Pretty much all companies are willing to do exchanges if the hardware doesnt work, and my merchants like amazon or newegg do take returns. 

5. Kind of, yes. However you just posted to a community of 360,000 people ready to help!

6. Very unlikely. In fact, here is how you do this. First, plug you power-supply into the wall. Second, turn the power supply switch to on. Third, touch the power supply. Do this every now and then and you are good. You have to try to kill a build with ESD these days

7. Nope, not at all. The only risk of buying one at a time is that its possible your return periods will run out by the time you put it together. But thats not a big deal

As in, can you click a link on reddit.com, pass through a viglink server (for the affiliate code), and then go to the link you wanted. Then,

Yes, thats what they have said a few times. I'm fine with transparency, don't get me wrong..but it seems you are completely ignoring or misunderstanding what they are saying.

You asked:

&gt;If X happens, will situation Y occur?

They replied,

&gt;&gt;No, situation Y will not occur

Then again you just ask

&gt;&gt;&gt;But will situation Y occur?

They have clearly stated that Situation Y, in this case, the storing of cookies, will not happen. If you choose to believe it..thats up to you.

2580,"Semi-unrelated storytime! (copypasting this from chatlogs so pardon bad formatting)

I found a security vulnerability in a large retailers website.

I went to report this vulnerability

For those that don't know, the proper way to report security vulnerabilities is generally through email to a security team or developer

For example, security@reddit.com

You don't tell others (this doesn't count) - You don't tweet it out, you don't call customer service, etc   
Since god knows how that will go

So, I look around on this retailers website


Try and find something about bugs / reporting


Nothing, which is understandable

 
So I dig through their support database. Nothing even about reporting issues, let alone security

Same with their ""forums""


At a loss, I decide to call their 1-800 and just see if I can get trasferred to someone, or if someone knows the email


I get through a robo-thing, and some dude with an accent is on the other end

So I tell him, in the easiest way I can ""I need to report a security vulnerability, how would I do that""

He didn't quite understand, so I rephrased, ""I need to talk to someone who can help me with a security issue""

mistake #1


He replies ""Absolutely sir I will transfer you""


and I'm like..great!


New person picks up. Female, different accent


Basically asks me a few questions about me. Name, etc


And then she asks what makes me think my account was hijacked. was it an order, etc?


And I'm like, ""oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh..no thats not what I meant""

I again try and explain what I need


""I need to get an email address so I can report a security bug"" (they seemed to understand what I meant when I said bug)


She tells me to hold, and again I am transferred


Except its a bounceback

So , ""How can I help you today""


I just hang up


New strategy

Whois the domain, and call the tech contact!


This seems to work better! The person sounds super professional. When I was talking to ""Matt from corporate"", I really was!

Matt seems to understand what I mean, and he tells me he will look into it

I am transferred

And the person on the other end again assumes my account was hacked / fraud, etc

so i cri

I ask again, just to see what happens

and im on hold

for about 20 minutes

I just hang up

At this point im grumpy

So I do what always works, take it to social media

I tweet this company, ""Hey @Company, whats the correct contact to report a security vulnerability""

They reply, ""@company: @allthefoxes: Can you elaborate""

""Sure @company, I found an issue in your website that compromises user security! Can you DM me an email address I can contact""

""@company @allthefoxes: I see, you can contact Twitter@example.com and I will make sure it gets to the right people""!

So, im closer now, but I'm like uuh, no, not sending this to a multi person customer support email
 
The person assures me its monitored only by them at their corporate offices

I just want to strangle this guy at this point ""THATS NOT HOW IT WORKS YOU FUCK""

SO. I do not give up so easily, I went to find my own path

I found the careers page for this company and found they were hiring developers

There I found a link in the bottom right to their twitter account about thier web services

I follow this link, its not @company, its @companyapi, And I tweeted them, waited 20 minutes, no reply

but I saw they followed a lot of people for a corporate account

I looked at who they were following

And scrolled through a few pages, and saw @personA, Sr. Developer at example.com
 
and im like YES, SOMEONE WHO WILL UNDERSTAND

I look the person up to confirm who they claimed to be and tweeted them

30 minutes later he replies, we DM back and forth

and i finally get my god damn email",2016-05-26 16:25:20+00:00,d3klbpz,2.0,t1_d3kk7gc,1444.0,announcements

2. Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/ncrna/about/flair/#link_templates - These will be the templates that will show up in the selector. To make a template, simply add text in the ""flair text"" box and hit save. Leave the css class empty for now. If you want non moderators to be able to edit the TEXT of the flair, check user can edit. Probably don't want this checked. 

3. Make sure everything is saved, and go back to your subreddit, and do a force refresh (press shift and F5)

With the tech we have, there was no realistic way to get someone up there to take Jeb home - He tried his best to push his craft, but there was no luck

Jeb stared out, and started to burn retrograde

https://www.allthefoxes.me/img/04/s-09-7e55.png

He stared off as he fell https://www.allthefoxes.me/img/04/s-09-d8ef.jpg - He had no choice. Doing this, the media could report he simply didn't make it back through re-entry. The program could save face, and he would be remembered a hero.

But he was happy https://www.allthefoxes.me/img/04/s-09-617a.png - After all, first kerbin in space? He would die for his planet. For science. For the future of all Kerbin

Things began to get warmer and warmer still as the atmosphere surrounded him.

Warmer and warmer, unbearably hot. And he began to slow down.

https://www.allthefoxes.me/img/04/s-09-c6e9.png

But he had no way to cushion his fall

Jeb closed his eyes

It wouldn't be long now...

---

BANG

and it all went black

---

But not three moments passed before it all came back again. After all, the terminal velocity of a Kerbin was quite low.

Not today. Not today. He swam toward the surface, lit his flare, and waited. He was going home after all.

3000,"To explain the section at the bottom:

We get a lot of takedown requests. By this, I do not mean ""This posts breaks rules remove it"" or ""I hate this post remove it"" - I generally mean literal takedown requests, such as copyright issues, or no consent issues

* **Copyright** - A photographer has had their picture posted here and they don't want it posted here

* **No consent** - A human that is *in* a  photograph, even if they did not take the picture, does not want the picture on /r/pics - This often happens with things like Facebook posts that a friend posts to /r/pics 

---

In both cases, we either can action these or just send them to reddit, based on the situation

---

**Unactionable** cases are generally completely invalid claims, sometimes trolls, or no proof was provided on ask.

**Actionable by us** - There will be times when things like this are very open and shut - These tend to be very easily resolved issues such as quick and easily provable copyvio issues or quick and easy no consent issues. All takedowns require proof. The exact kind of proof depends on the situation - 

**Forwarded to reddit** - The most common action by us - at /r/pics it is not our duty (nor our desire) to field most of these requests. *Anything* that goes beyond a very basic, open and shut case, is forwarded to the reddit administrators. We cannot represent reddit legally, handle DCMAs, etc...

In the last year, we have received under 100 mod-actionable requests - Out of those, none were incorrect. We only make those actions when there is no sliver of a doubt that we are making the right call. Anything more involved is sent to the people who handle that kind of thing.

NSFW means not safe for work, meaning if you look at this at work, you probably will lose your job, such as tits or a person being decapitated. 

From what I understand, reddit has been quite firm on this for a while now.

3095,"The ""you are doing that too much"" has nothing to do with post deletion, and there would not be a super easy way to implement that

The ""you are doing that too much"" only cares about one thing: rate

Your post got deleted, so you quickly need to post again, however, you have low karma in the subreddit, so reddit steps in and says ""woah there"" and makes you wait your turn, just to be safe. 

Having this ability could create some serious possible abuse, and I would be against it. Yes, the wait is slightly annoying, good thing we are on reddit where there is plenty of content in the mean time to browse

I think a real and better solution to this would be to have automod do checks right at the submit button being pressed, not even making the post if a rule would be violated.",2016-03-27 21:15:52+00:00,d1fm0xo,1.0,t3_4c6ckh,13821.0,ideasfortheadmins

PSCP wasn't doing much better, but the pi is a bit busy right now and I don't want to intterupt it, so I will try this when I can

---

&gt;If you login to the RPi3 and use dd to write a large file to the drive, is there any difference?

Again, to be fair to it I need to wait for this transfer to finish up, but yes:

3136,"&gt;Wait there is a hardcoded limit of 10 for the rule entries? WTF admins..

YUP!!!

&gt;1) Does every image host has to go through this approval process you outlined, before pics from it can be submitted to your sub? (like its more of an whitelist than a blacklist)

More or less, with some exceptions

1. Established image hosts get a pass, for the most part.

2. Verified photographers or artists (see the current sticky) are allowed to use thier own site, assuming they follow certain guidelines

A list could be considered, but for the most part, we like imgur, flickr, or pixabay",2016-03-22 01:56:22+00:00,d18nbko,6.0,t1_d18n89s,143.0,subredditcancer
3137,"And yes, https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/about/rules/ is limited by space, we can only have 10 entries (super depressing)

So, to be an approved image host on /r/pics:

1. Generally, the creator of maintainer of the site needs to reach out to us and ask for approval. This is not always the case, but we do require so from *new* image hosts (which slimg is)

2. We need to ask a few questions about what the site can actually handle, as well as check with the site owner that they should be prepared to get slammed by heavy, heavy bandwidth. We have cost people a lot of money in the past.

3. We as moderators discuss this internally if we should approve them or not.

---

Currently, slimg is not even eligible, because again, last I checked, the domain is flat out soft-banned on reddit, meaning that any posts using the domain automatically go to the spam filter. We could fish them out, of course, and approve them, but that isn't something that we really want to add on for a new image host, since its a huge pain in the ass

Including the FPH stigma, and etc, we have no interest in having slimg as an approved host

---

As far as the grasping for straws shit, I didn't think we would really need to break down our process this far, but if that is what satisfies the hivemind then its fine with me.

In addition, I'm not a huge fan of releasing info on what domains are soft or hard banned on reddit (even though Its mostly common knowledge)",2016-03-22 01:38:41+00:00,d18mn2v,4.0,t1_d18ljp7,1666.0,subredditcancer

For a lot of people, reddit is a big community, and they do want to share that here, with us. And that is something that we as moderators allow. You are free to downvote posts as you see fit, however, personal attacks and general assholery won't be tolerated. 

If you don't like these kinds of posts, they are always flaired and you can use your client of choice to filter out any posts with this flair. Thanks!

Issues with this article:

1. No references whatsoever - The most glaring one. Especially because this is a living person, and there are no references what so ever, hammers will be dropped.

2. No claim to notability. I love 7MD, but notability on Wikipedia means that the artist has been covered by multiple, reliable, independant sources. Since there are no references, there is no notability, and no claim to notability was made either

But, say, I posted a comment saying ""all blacks should die!!"", that would be removable. Or posting a picture of a black person, with the title ""Look at this monkey!"" , that would likely get removed.

3507,"Hi there. We never changed our rules actually!

The qyb post was a pretty bad timing. Reddit had just a few days back introduced that new rules page, which we made. We had always removed posts for that, but we had forgotten to put it in the new page. You can choose to not believe it, but I promise its the truth. When we saw what happened, we remembered to add it back in. Screenshotting it as ""proof"" was in  bad taste and a mistake

&gt;lie and ban users that submit pics/comments that offend your political views?

exmaples?

&gt;Why is it that you allows all the pro Bernie Sanders and pro left wing content/comment and then censor like crazy when people express right wing views (like during the whole Cologne refugee story)?

**No**

Sorry for going anonymous but just wanted to provide some information and others can take it however they'd like.

So far it looks like we've built a great new group of mods that will hopefully help keep this sub moving during slow times. However, I believe that to become a mod here, there needs to be a certain level of maturity and understanding of not only the written rules but the ""understood"" rules of PictureGame.

With that being said, I've witnessed a lack of understanding of some of various rules by /u/Boomdrop. It's not a knock on their character, etc. but something that only comes through experiencing all different kinds of situations PictureGame may throw at you.

At this time, I personally feel like /u/Boomdrop does not have the same level of experience that other nominees have. While I appreciate him as a player and creator of rounds, I don't believe it's enough to make a mod.",2016-02-02 23:47:49+00:00,czlmr0h,1.0,t3_43plqr,108016.0,Picturegame_Mod

That was caused by something called the vote cap.

At a certain point ,reddit limits it so that no more points can come in. Since a lot of points are added in by reddit itself to stop abuse, at this point, reddit removes a lot of the fake votes, as well as cutting down the actual point number.

**All throught the day. I don't browse TIFU too often, whenever I see it on /r/all I binge a few pages though.**

2. What do you like about /r/tifu? Your answer can refer to the content of the subreddit or the way it is run.  
**I just like reading personal stories, always cool to see people talk about their lives**

3. An angry user comes into modmail. How do you treat the situation?  
**~~mute them~~ See what I can do to solve the issue, if possible, and offer up solutions**

4. A very popular post with thousands of upvotes is at the front page of reddit. You notice that it breaks the rules. What actions do you take?  
**Remove it and leave a comment. Offer condolences to OP for the lost karma**

5. Do you think a reddit moderator should ever “let the upvotes decide?” Why or why not?  
**Sometimes yes, sometimes no. For posts that follow the rules, and are in all means a fine post, then absolutely. However, letting the upvotes decide are not an appropriate replacement for rules**

6. What hobbies do you do in your spare time? Gaming, reading, macaroni art, etc.  
**I edit Wikipeda, moderate reddit, play some video games, and go on early morning runs, sometimes.**

7. Do you have any experience with CSS, Automod, or Toolbox?  
**No, yes, yes. I also am a team member on the RES project**

8. Do you have any experience with moderating? It doesn’t necessarily have to be through reddit.  
**Yeah, I am kinda a big deal**

9. What timezone are you in, and when are you available?  
**EST**

10. What’s your favorite movie?  
**No comment, not a big movie guy**

11. Do you have any ideas for /r/tifu that you’d like to undertake or start as a moderator (It’s totally fine if you say “no”!).  
**nope**

12. If you could have an ice cream sundae with whatever ice cream or topping you wanted, what would you put on it?  
**I am a prety plain guy. Vanilla, some chocolate syrup. Maybe M&amp;Ms...maybe**

13. Is there anything you’d want us to be aware of before adding you?  
**No**

14. Can you give a commitment to help out the subreddit?  
**Yep**

Moving, hiring, training, and keeping employees is damn expensive.

I have been mildly following Oculus, and it has been cool to watch it grow. Don't know if getting one is possible right now, but down the line I am excited.

Anyways, everyone is all upset about pricing and things like that, so my question is somewhat related.

Why wait until the last moment? I suppose pricing is a good thing to bring up when pre-orders are available, but I feel like things like that should've been released far beforehand, yeah? Any other piece of tech, when showed off, tells you what it is, when you can pre-order it, and the price.

You said you didn't want to give a ""price while in a vaccum"" and that "" a lot would be happening the 6th"", but...it doesn't seem like anything happened but pre-orders opening.",2016-01-07 02:24:14+00:00,cyout2w,1.0,t3_3zt7ul,1234.0,IAmA

I was underwater and when I came up, I brushed against some big guy (but still, early / mid teens) and, I don't really know, just bumped into him.

So he grabbed me and held me under water. He held me under for a long time, I didn't pass out, but it was bad. I have shitty lungs, so I've never been able to hold my breath long, and I was a kid and panicking.

I was doing everything I could to get away, but there was nothing I could really do.

The pool was pretty crowded. Apparently, no one really noticed for the first..30 seconds or so, then a lifeguard finally noticed that something wasn't right here, and ran over. 

A few other adults, and our supervisor, managed to pull him away. I got pulled out of the pool and the kid got kicked out and banned.  I was fine and just was pretty shaken up. Still like swiming, but not around other people",2015-12-17 22:00:27+00:00,cy2pjgl,2.0,t1_cy23mog,39976.0,AskReddit

For many cases, yes, I don't think lying is okay. But yes we will continue to mute users and remove posts.

You're still a shithead.

&gt;Why do you cover for Islam and which one of the mods does it? Which one of the mods deleted the gilded comment and which one of the mods decided to lock the topic? How was it justified?

To be honest I don't know exactly what you are asking here.


&gt;How many of the mods agreed with that decision?

Things like that are not put up to tribunals. And just as an aside, the score of a comment, and if it has reddit gold or not, plays no role into our moderation.

Whats your point? You are right, so that somehow stops mods from removing posts or something?

4670,"&gt;Nothing is said about if there exists the ability of the Reddit admins' to view my PMs without my permission.

Everything on reddit is a 'thing'

Comments, posts, users, messages, subreddits, etc.

'Things' have various permissions, each thing may have a different set of permissions, but all 'things' have a permission that says what ranks can view it.

Admins have the ability to view every 'thing', no matter the type.

This includes:

Comments, posts, subreddits, messages, and more.

So yes, admins have the technical ability to read your PMs.

---

As for when they actually do this, they probably aren't going through them for lulz, but I have had admins look into and view PMs sent to me that were harassing, threatening, or those shitty shock images.

If this happened every month, every other month, we would stop making such a big deal out of it.

Its not about certain lives being more privileged, its literally about newsworthyness.

This is a huge tradgedy that is a lot more close to home for people, in a place where something like this rarely happens. Its a really big fucking deal.

If this happened again next month, it would lose a lot of this coverage, and so on and so forth.

The world doesn't work the way you are trying to describe it to me. It simply doesn't, and its naive to think or even suggest that it should. That is treating human lives as human lives.

In the eye of the world, certain events are more important than others. The idea that every single tradgedy should be on some sort of same level just makes it all a lot less important in general.

Having a ""world tragedy"" section in our local newspaper every day would just make *all* these events less important.

Correct

What do you mean? Something like an r9 390 would run pretty much anything at steady 60 @ 1080p

The i5-6600 comes with a stock cooler, which will be more than enough since you can't overclock!

5186,"Hey! 

A little while back, /r/pics was suffering from some very intense spamming coming from imgur links in descriptions. We contacted imgur and you guys soon helped us out and we definitely have noticed less and less spam. 

Ever since a recent automod update (thanks based /u/deimorz), we are actually able to use it to check if a post has a link in its description, and remove it before it even hits /new ! So that is pretty cool.

Recently, imgur has also been faced with two major security vulnerabilities. The whole 4chan thing, and a code execution issue. It's been a bit crazy but you guys have it on lock.

However, sometimes /r/pics does have times where we have had to restrict imgur post. Both times with the security issues, and the spam even once forced us to just direct links until things were sorted out.

I guess my question is, imgur seems so big, it rules the house when it comes to picture sharing on reddit. I am aware of a few other hosting sites, but many redditors aren't. Are you ever worried about this kind of stuff? When imgur goes down, reddit basically slows to a grinding halt.

When would you ever need more than 8? Youll have slots open to upgrade down the line. Chances are you wont ever get above using 6 gigs of ram in normal usage. Unused ram is wasted ram.

Another fun fact about front pages: The top X posts in your front page, where X is the number of subreddits you are subscribed to, but is no greater than 50, should be all from different subreddits! 

This doesn't always work out, thanks to some reddit fudgy-ness, but I am subscribed to 60ish subreddits, the top 47 posts on my front page are from different subreddits. 

The post that gets shown in this part of the front page is the top post in each subreddit.

Download the media creation tool, then yes, point it toward a flash drive.

&gt;If I get a new motherboard, does that mean I need to re-buy Windows again?

Windows 10, yes.

&gt;Or can I use my original Windows 8.1?

You can use your old 8.1 key, and if the free upgrade is still being done, you should be able to upgrade as well.",2015-10-13 17:11:51+00:00,cvybq00,3.0,t1_cvy9rsx,2809.0,buildapc

5421,"&gt;How do I put my OS onto the SSD and remove it from my HDD?

Insert your Windows install media and choose to install on the SSD. On the same screen, you can click advanced and ""delete"" the partitions on the HDD. This will delete your data on that hard drive.

&gt;And do I need a Product Key?

If you did a free upgrade to windows 10, no. The upgrade was registered to your motherboard, so as long as you have the mobo you used when you upgraded, just press ""skip"" when it asks for a key. If you get a new motherboard and install windows again, you will need a product key.

&gt; Does the motherboard need to install the OS or something?

Nope, the only way they are related is that your windows 10 free upgrade is tied to the motherboard. Replacing that means you would need to pay for a windows 10 product key.

Take all the subreddits you are subscribed to. Lets say you are subscribed to sixty.

If you do not have reddit gold, the top X posts on your front page will be the top post from each subreddit you subscribe to (up to the max allowed.)

So, you are subbed to 60 subreddits. Only 50 can be put on the front page, so 50 random subreddits out of your sixty are chosen.

Now look at your front page. As you go down, only one post should be present per subreddit in the first 50 subreddits.

We also need to account for fuzz, and the fact that posts older than 1 day can't be on the front page.

So accounting for that, the top 1-40 or so of your front page will all be form different subreddits.",2015-10-07 15:30:23+00:00,cvrcls1,2.0,t1_cvqtcvt,49702.0,blog

5813,"So, lets say automod rule says posts can't have the word triangle in them.

When a post is, well, posted. The post is scanned fairly quickly for that match and other rules. This happens in milliseconds. If its in violation of the rule, the post is removed.

What is the difference between reddit doing this, or doing it when the submit button is pressed?

There is none. At the cost of posts taking another 1-2 seconds to actually post, you can detect rulebreaks before they even get posted. 

there is literally no difference in resources weather you do it before or after.

---

You are right, doing that while typing is a bit silly and could be more stressful on reddit, so if thats what you were meaning, I understand now. But say, checking at the time of the submit button being pressed, wouldn't make any difference. 

Sorry for a misunderstanding there.

6047,"&gt;I put 16 Gb DDR3 (2x8Gb) to take outright advantage of the double data rate of the paired memory - instead of buying a single 8 Gb bar now and another 8 Gb later. Is it a correct reasoning ?

This rarely matters. 16gb now won't hurt though if you can afford it!

&gt;Is the GPU a good choice ? I was not convinced I needed those 400$+ GPU (eg: R9 390) for the kind of use I was planning and instead went to a cheaper, yet capable one.

The 750ti is great, but I imagine it will start to struggle when you get those 3 monitors going.

6053,"&gt;First, will these parts fit together in the case I have chosen?

Yes

&gt;Second, is the 520W PSU sufficient to power the build?

mmmmh. Should be, but it might not hurt to up a little bit.

&gt;Third, am I missing any necessary parts or materials?

The motherboard you listed is an H series, meaning you cannot overclock the processor on it. You will need a mobo that has a Z in place of the H if you want to overclock.

If you don't want to overclock, then you have listed an unlocked processor, which would hoestly be a waste if you arent going to overclock.

6196,"Fun fact ! 

Reddit barfing like that when you get down to those pages (assuming we aren't talking about 503s :( ) are caused because every 30 minutes, reddit changes your front page and this breaks the page sorting!

What do they change? Glad you asked! If you don't have reddit gold, the front page can only show you 50 subreddits at once (100 if you have gold). So to keep things fresh, every 30 minutes the 50 subreddits you can see get changed. It's random so you won't get all the ones you didn't see earlier, but it works quite well!

The side effect of this though is that the front page sorting breaks once you change the pool of subreddits it draws from. 

---

Another common cause of this is when you try to go to the next page, but the last post on your current page is deleted, things get messy. ",2015-09-10 20:44:04+00:00,cux5s98,7.0,t1_cux5j1a,394.0,explainlikeimfive

6200,"Your second edit is sorta right! If you don't have reddit gold, your front page will only show you 50 out of all your subreddits!

If you have gold, this limit is 100. 

The subreddits that get shown cycle every half hour. 

This is also why the front page sometimes ""runs out"" and you get a ""there doesn't seem to be anything here"" after you scroll for a while. When you go to the next page after its cycled the subreddits, things break and reddit says there is nothing there. 

---

Other front page fun facts:

The first part of your front page is always the top post on each subreddit you are subscribed to at the current moment. 

Meaning if you subscribe to 50 subreddits, your first 50 posts (2 pages) *should* be 1 from each subreddit, and that post you see will be the at the top of the subreddit. Once you pass those posts, the sorting algorithm kicks in. 

Edit: it usually works out this way but once you get toward the end of your subreddits things get muddy. But try it yourself! I just went through my front page. I'm subscribed to 63 ish subreddits and I have reddit gold. My first 48 posts were from all different subreddits ! Then the sorting kicked in

When a creator post is made, automod will flair it as ""pending approval""

6904,"You know, when I was 6, I had a really abusive father. This wasn't as much of a thing when I wasn't born, but these behaviors started coming out of him a bit after I was born.

He was an asshole, and beat my mom, abused her, and when I was a bit older (6 or 7 ish) took it out on me too.

Its a very conflicting thing, because he was my dad, and I knew he cared about me..in some way, but at the same time he brought a lot of pain to my family.

Sometimes he would go away for days, where even my mom didnt know.

He would take all our money too, so sometimes we literally had to work with what we had. He would come back eventually, pay some bills, we would have some money again. 

Eventually, we were able to run off, and get away. We moved to Colorado when I was 8 or so, with nothing. We had some family assistance, and were able to rent a small house in the middle of nowhere pretty much. I ended up growing up in the area, until around high school.

---

There were many times when we could not even afford power. Pen and paper were simply out of the question. 

---

In addition, I just paid $600 to fix my cars bumper. I woke up one morning a few days ago, and someone sideswiped my car and ripped off some of the bumper.

---

Maybe you have never had to deal with this before, but sometimes, accidents in life can happen. You can get blindsided by something and realize that you can't spend $200 on all the supplies you need for a year. 

You alywas try and roll with the punches, but its rough.

7042,"I lived in a really small town. Not much changed in elementary school. So it was kind of cool when we got a new kid. I was the new kid before him, so two new kinds within 6 months was a big deal for the school. 

Anyways, one day that other new kid, call him B, he didn't show up. Okay, no big deal. The next day though there were rumors. A lot of police cars on a street near the school. Like, 5 or 6. B had something to do with it. 

Later we were all told he died. He didn't go to school because he was helping his dad with some project. His dad was driving the pickup with some wood planks in the bed of the truck. 

He was driving down this road, while on the side of it, some guy was working on his trailer, and it was jacked up. Right before Bs dad drove by, the jack failed, and the trailer swung out a bit. 

He braked hard but they collided anyways, and when they did, a plank in the truck went through the back window and into B s neck. Instantly dead. 

I learned all these details at the funeral, at school they just told us it was an accident. 

It was a freak accident and it was just terrible. I still have his picture from the year book. He was a great guy.

He is right, use automod

---

So you want mod approval for links, but not self posts.

So, make sure your subreddit is set to allow both. Then, in automod, do:

    type: link submission
    action: filter

This still removes the post, but it treats it like its in the spam filter, so when you approve it, it goes to the top of /new (I think) as well as being sent to /r/mod/about/modqueue, which most mods use to see filtered posts and reported stuff!

5. I dont even know how that subreddit works so dont ask me

6. You cant hide your post history, but no one can see what you are subscribed to.

So, multis.

Firstly, you can see what subreddits you are subscribed to at https://reddit.com/subreddits/mine - There, you can unsubscribe to any of them if you dont want to see them on https://reddit.com (the front page)

You can see *all* subreddits at https://reddit.com/subreddits

As for multis, you dont need to be subscribed to them to place them in a multi reddit.

To create one, just go to the front page, and there is a little bar to the left

8104,"UD, you know I am wishy washy on some of the stuff we allow here, but moderating based on opinion is bad, and you know that. 

An approach with proper regulation may be possible, but we aren't just going to remove things because we don't like them.

Better objectives about how to handle things like this is what needs to change. Its not about wanting. When you have a subreddit that has such a broad topic range, everyone will think differently on certain things.

But even you know, if I were to look at this post and say ""You know, this is bad to me, I don't like it"", and remove it, I should not be a moderater here or anywhere.

If we ever get moving on better polices and setting our rules that have minimal moderator opinion being a part of it, maybe we can improve on this front, and its something we are always talking about. 

And just about no one on this team is for a complete ban on personal stories (which would be a possible outcome thats not totally opinion based). We don't want this to be a cut and dry /r/eathporn type subreddit. We want a community. But some of our community doesn't want a community, which makes things a bit rough on that end.

8108,"We do not moderate content that some people don't like. It's not right and its not sustainable. This is not the bastion for quality photography.

I would be happy to point you in the right direction if that is what you are after.

If you do not think a post is good, then you, the user, should downvote it. And maybe you have. When a community gets this large, and the topic is as broad as ""pics"", some people are going to like something that you don't. Places like /r/PCMasterRace or /r/apple (usually) have a much more narrow topic, and quality can be ""higher""

---

So, yeah, I'm sorry we are not removing stuff you don't like, but thats just not something we do. If that is a bad thing and we are bad mods for that, so be it. We are a simple community based around the idea of *sharing*, not photography. The rest is up to the community (and our few rules).

In the end, the community is voting this stuff up.

Your 3 possible solutions are basically:

1. Deal with it. People like some stuff you don't. Downvote, move on

2. Be the change you want to see. Post pics that you think people *should* be putting on this subreddit. Spend lots of time in /new and make a difference

3. Unsub, and subscribe to subreddits that you may enjoy more. Thats fine and honestly I would love to help you find the right community for you.

---

We don't moderate on what we think is good or bad, or what other people think is good or bad. 

It doesn't make much sense to me in a community like this, if someone reports any post and says ""This is bad"", we shouldn't be removing it.",2015-07-12 17:35:14+00:00,ct0tm9a,2.0,t1_ct0namr,13729.0,pics

My issue is, when you come up with things like this, it becomes very ""admin decsion"" oriented. What you guys feel like staying can stay, and what doesn't gets the boot.

You guys *can* do that, but its not fair to the community, the people who want those subs gone, or the people who are apart of the community.

Thats why I am interested in seeing your take on this, if its just a rehashed way of saying ""banning behavior, not ideas"", then nothing will change, and people will be mad. Criteria should be formed, and these should be outlayed.

This comes back to the whole of reddits rules. No offence to anyone who wrote them, but they are terrible.

The rules themselves? They are fine, but how they are written is just bad. Its a old timey ""See, we are cool internet people because our rules are easy to understand and short""

You guys can still create readable, sensible rules that cut the crap, but still get into details.

Thats something I think reddit truly needs. The rules need to be rewritten. No more hidden rules, no more unspoken crimes.

* Even if reports are ignored / a post is actioned, it would be nice to see the reports anyways. I guess that somewhat defeats the purpose, but once ignore is pressed, its impossible to see them at all. Not sure how to approach this one, but yeah. Just thinking out loud.

* Super low priority: The moderator box is just plain inconsistent sometimes. It would be nice to simply have the ability to tell the side box how many mods to show before having to press ""show more"" - I am sure this is possible with CSS though, so eh.

Slightly bigger stuff I can think of:

* If you could create an endpoint for ""submit distinguished"" rather than having to make 2 calls, I would be the happiest camper in the world.

* Modmail needs block button :( - One day.

* Anyone know why modqueue takes so long to load compared to other pages? (And I mean load, not cuz of extensions)

She has been involved in a questionable lawsuit where she claimed her last employer would not promote her because they were sexist, while the company argues that she was not promoted because, well, she didn't deserve one.

Ellen is also married to a guy who had some stuff to do with some ponzi schemes. I don't have all the details on this.

Ellen invested in reddit in 2013 (2012?) and then came to work for reddit soon after as a legal consultant, helping create the new privacy policy and user agreement for reddit.

Later, when CEO of reddit Yishan Wong abruptly resigned, the board of reddit (Alexis Ohanian (/u/kn0thing), Reddits CEO (so, at the time, /u/yishan), and some people from Advanced Publications (Reddit's parent company)) brought in Ellen as a temporary CEO

Since then, reddit has made a number of questionable business decisions, and decisions around the site.

&gt;The scandals surrounding Pao

Had literally nothing to do with any of this

&gt;the disconnect of leadership from the community at large

I agree, and thats something they have agreed they need to do better.

&gt;other mis-handlings/inconsistencies of sub-reddit banning

Lets break this down

&gt;Mishandling

Honestly, they didnt mis handle anything. They removed subreddits, told us why, and were extremely transparent about it

&gt;inconsistencies 

I tend to agree with you here. 

&gt;are all dysfunctional patterns that unquestionably need to be addressed.

And that does not mean we as moderators will take our subreddits down again. MNone of us really like doing that kind of thing in the first place.

If you have issues with Pao as CEO, thats fine, you are allowed to be concerned. However, most of us believe that Ellen, while not the best, is not nearly worthy of all the hate she gets.

&gt;just more promises

That was **Exactly the point** -- they talked to us, and the ball is now in their court. This is 100% the goal. Now they act on it.

---

&gt;hould you have demanded Victoria to be rehired or Ellen to resign?

No, absolutely not, thats between Victoria and reddit

&gt;No, but you should have pledged to remain dark until someone responsible for the debacle resigns

Why? No one needs to resign because an employee got fired. Thats business.

---

&gt;and at the very least until reddit releases Victoria from any NDAs or other instruments so SHE can tell us what happened.

Well, like you were told, this wasn't even about Victoria. In addition, these NDAs are for both reddit and Victoria. Maybe she did something really bad, or maybe this is something that deserves to be private.

We as users have absolutely no right to know what happened, and demanding to know would simply be stupid. 

---

&gt;All you've done is give them six months to prepare for replacing you all the next time you try to shut down

Maybe, we will have to see.

---

&gt;The admins didn't agree to accept any ""consequences"" of missing the deadline.

You are right and they don't need to accept anything. They can figure out what they want to do.

8615,"&gt;If you feel strongly about the issue make a sticky.

Last time hundreds of large sub mods coordinated a sticky, it went, basically, to shit. 

---

&gt;Or find another website.

But thats the thing, none of us really **want** to go to another website. We **like** (usually) moderating. We **like** reddit. 

And when the people who run the show on this site that we all deeply care for won't listen, we had to use the only power we have that might just make them listen.

---

&gt;Strictly speaking, you're not that special.

No, we aren't, but we have this power, and are using it to try and make a better site for everyone.

---

I honestly suggest, if you don't care anyways, then you should continue to do just that if the subs go down, and just not care. Its clearly not a big deal if you don't care in the first place.

Yes, We all love victoria, but shes not coming bacj. She was a catalyst.

/r/pics and many other subreddits went dark because we were upset about reddits chronic inability to communicate, and its general poor management.

All we asked for was that the admins come and talk to us. Make a plan, tell us whats up, and be willing to communicate. And they did just that around midnight last night.

Many of you think its not enough (those who read it), or whatever, but for /r/pics, and many other defaults who will be public soon, its  exactly what we wanted. Now we go public, we hold them up to these promises, and we give them a chance to show that they are ready to communicate.

I can't really say, but its been thrown all over the internet already so you could find it. I summerized it in the post above anyways

eh, kinda. Its vague, but all I really wanted was to hear from the admins. Its a start

* What aren't the other subs public

idk im not their mom

* Is it all Ellen Pao's fault?

Nah, sorry guys. I mean maybe a bit, but generally no. Even the chairman has come to talk to us.

For when this inevitably hits /r/all

Hey guys! This is a subreddit for the game [DotA 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/) made by Valve (the company behind Steam, Half-Life, Portal, all that)

DotA 2 is a multiplayer game where 2 teams of 5 fight against each other in an effort to destroy the enemy team's ancient, a building in the center of their base. But those 5 heroes are defending their ancient, just like you defend your own, and they won't go down without a fight. You must become stronger by killing little guys called creeps for gold or experience, or even killing the enemy heroes for even more gold or experience. You can use this gold to buy in game items, and your experience is used to level up, making your skills or stats better.  

Like an MMO in that sense, but every game, every starts at level 1 with a small amount of gold. 

This game can get **really** competitive, and is played at a professional level.

Every year, Valve hosts a big tournament called **The International** in Seattle. 

The prizepool for this event is crowdfunded by us, the players. Valve seeded the pool with 1.6 million dollars, and allowed us players to purchase a compendium, a virtual book that gave us cool hats. 25% of the proceeds of this $10 virtual book went to the prizepool.

We just hit $15,000,000 dollars for this prizepool, which is by far the largest prize-pool in esports history (The runner up being the last International), and we get the last of our stretch goals for raising it!",2015-07-01 20:24:54+00:00,csp3gxa,1.0,t3_3bsj1o,834.0,DotA2

9029,"Sure it should.

np is a subdomain.

A subdomain is something that goes before an actual domain.

So, reddit.com is the domain

www.reddit.com - www. is the subdomain, reddit.com is the domain.

---

So what are subdomains used for? Subdomains can be used for a lot of different things. sometimes, subdomains are used to just completely take you to a different page. 

However the most common use for subdomains is *internationalization* (i18n)

---

So as a logged in user (to just about any website), you can go ahead and tell that website what language to use. You make an account at reddit.com, and you can go to your prefs, and tell it to be in french. Cool.

Google does the same. You can make a google account, and tell google that any time you go to google.com, serve it to me in french.

---

But lets say we have a user that *doesn't want to make an account*, or, lets say, does have an account, but can't read english, and needs to operate the site without the account.

How do we do that?

There are a few options here, but the way reddit does it is with *subdomain language codes*

You can tell reddit to serve you a certain language by changing the www in www.reddit.com to a 2 letter language code.

Whats a language code? Well, es = spanish, fr = french, de = german. And many many more.

So if I want to go see reddit.com in spanish, I can hop on over to https://es.reddit.com

Now, at this point, we can see why we **need es to stick**, or need whatever language code to stick. Do you want someone to be constantly changing the url to es.reddit.com every time they click anything? No.

---

Okay, so where does np tie in?

Good question. 

Moderators of subreddits (not admins, moderators) have the ability to edit the **CSS** of their subreddit. CSS is Cascading Style Sheets - A type of ""programming language"" that tells web browsers how to make a page look. 

Something you can do with CSS is *specify styles based on the language code entered as a subdomain*

Quite easily, you can make a statement that says ""When a user is on es.example.com, show THIS""

And this is exactly how np works. Its using a language code that reddit doesnt use (np), and moderators can add statements to their stylesheet that, when a user is in np, change the page to look like THIS.

---

Here is an example of something we use language codes for in /r/theydidthemath:

    html:lang(or) .link:not(.linkflair-request) { display: none; }

That says, ""When someone goes to http://or.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath, if a link flair on a post is **not** ""request"", don't display it""

This has the effect of saying ""Only show request posts"" (hence or)

---

So its not a bug, because language codes are specifically meant to stick.",2015-07-01 19:31:36+00:00,csp19t6,3.0,t1_csozude,2080.0,bugs

We were about to do it. We finally cracked. We were going to ban sob stories, add 15 more moderators, enforce a resolution standard, ban vertical pictures, disallow signs, disallow pictures of people's crappy parking.

We were going to filter every post and have a team of 6 people review a post before approving it (Anyone who did not submit a good enough picture would be sentenced to 25 minutes with Ellen ""Chairman"" Pao).

We were finally going to be the best damn default out there.

But then, I was approached by an alien.

I was scared at first, but this alien just had an aura of calm.

It leaned in close, next to my ear and whispered something I will never ever forget...

It does not begin or end with video games and if you don't fight you are going to lose so much more than just a hobby. This is the end of the war, they have been winning it for years. Gamergate was a surprise resistance that popped up after our ""forces"" had been routed and slaughtered on the altar of social justice for decades.

I hope this will open up some people's eyes a little bit.

So often I hear 

""Reddit is going the way of digg"" - 

""Reddit is dying""  - 

""It used to be better"" -

""It used to not be so shitty"" -

You know what, reddit could be losing numbers (I doubt it), and even then, people still need to take a freaking step back.

Yes, reddit will one day fall out. Its inevitable. Could be in a year, could be in 30 more years.

I just hope that a few people will take these stupid rose colored glasses off, and at the very least **enjoy the ride** -- That is what we do for our life anyways, right? Bad shit is gonna happen, doesn't mean we can't enjoy it.

With cloudflare, there is a middleman.

So when you go to reddit.com , you look for that IP address, but cloudflare comes in and says ""Hey, its me, I am reddit.com""

Your computer says sure and starts connecting to cloudflare's computer.
