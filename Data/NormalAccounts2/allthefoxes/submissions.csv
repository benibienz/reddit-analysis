A few weeks back, we ran a 1 week trial of some new rules on titles. They were generally well recieved and the data we gathered pushed support for the new rules.

We took some time to discuss and look at what worked and what didn't. We took feedback from mods and users alike, and we worked in suggested changes and feedback into the new ruleset. 

With that in mind, we settled on some guidelines and are ready to  update our ruleset with these rules in mind.

In a nutshell, we have replaced rule 4 and removed rule 5, since both rules have been combined into one.

These rules are guidelines on *titles* and not content. Anything removed under this new rule is for the title. Meaning that any user can repost their picture with a fixed up title. 

Here are our title guidelines:

1. must convey accurate information

2. must not ask for votes

3. must not be about a ""cake day""

4. must not request a photoshop/edit

10. must not ask for general information or feedback

11. must not be ""designed to elicit sympathy""

13. must not be cliched/forbidden title, located at /r/pics/w/titles/forbidden

With these new wordings, we have cut the trial ruleset down from 13 to its present state of 7. You may also notice that we have removed the restriction on reply posts. Ultimately, we deicided that reply posts were best left out of these guidelines, since it often related to the content rather than the title. We also realized that some of the most treasured posts in /r/pics history were reply posts.

We will look at reply posts another time, for now, they come through unscathed.

You will also notice we have changed the way we handle cliched titles. A bit point of feedback was that the cliched title rule was unclear and could be twisted by a rouge moderator to basically remove anything. We have solved this by making it an explicit list, rather than a general catch-all. We will update this list regularly. We may update it without announcement, but ill be sure to cover it in monthly transparecny reports if we do.

You can see the list of forbidden titles at /r/pics/w/titles/forbidden 

You can see the general rules on titles at /r/pics/w/titles

---

I also wanted to touch on a few notes about guideline 6 - This is a broad rule, but we will work hard to make sure we enfore this fairly and transparently.

One thing I want to highlight is that mentioning loss or death on its own does not qualify a title to be removed. Statements of fact are generally accepted. For example:

*My late grandfather left me his watch*

This would not be considered a violation. Just mentioning loss does not qualify someone for removal. In addition, general statements of fact on current events are fine as well.

*City block leveled in Syria after bombing run*

is a statement of fact about current events, and would not be considered a rule violation.

As an example of titles that do violate the rule:

*My old border collie can't run anymore. But after all this time she still loves her toy even though she can't play with it.*

I would consider this one a bit borderline, but there are many, many better ways to write this title.

*My brother loved going to conventions. RIP, buddy.*

Again, a rewrite would be good here.

We understand this will inevitably rub some people the wrong way, so we will be working hard with users to make sure they understand posts can be re-posted, and these rules are a step toward a higher quality subreddit. We will make people angry no matter what we do, but we feel this is the best step in the right direction.

There comes moments where we have to remove a post for a reason outside our normal set of rules. While these takedowns are extremely rare, there was not set process for handling them.

Due to the sometimes sensitive nature of these takedowns, it was hard to properly manage and often led to estranged users struggling with how to get something done.

To clarify, we use the term ""takedowns"" to refer to removing a post outside our normal ruleset in cases of copyright infringement and personal information infringement. 

I keep how many takedowns we get in the monthly transparency report. It's pretty low, rarely more than 2 a month. Even then, we get so few simply because people don't know what to do for the process. 

---

To make things smoother for everyone involved, we have introduced a proper takedown system, allowing for users to quickly understand the scope of takedowns and what is required from them. We will be improving the process as time goes on. Let me know if you have any questions.

**The takedown process information and instuctions can be found at /r/pics/w/takedown**

##FAQ

* Why did you do this?

 * Previously, a ""takedown"" at /r/pics was not a defined process. This often caused a lot of hassle for us and for the users involved.

* Is a /r/pics takedown a legal matter?

 * No. This is just an informal method of getting a thread removed for copyright or personal reasons. We can deny any takedown for any reason. Anyone looking for a more formal and legal process should contact legal@reddit.com

* What if you don't accept my takedown?

 * There are many reasons we might not accept a takedown. Please contact the image host and legal@reddit.com to go through a more formal and thorough process of getting an image and thread removed.

* Can you remove the image?

 * No, we can only remove the thread for showing on listing pages or search. People with the direct link will be able to access the post and the image. If you would like the image removed, you must contact the host of the image. **We highly suggest any user to go through the image host first/alongside a /r/pics takedown**

* Can I request takedown on comments?

 * No, use modmail or the normal reddit report system

* Can I request takedown on rule breaking posts?

 * Unless the issue is copyright or personal information, please use the reddit report function underneath every post.

* Can I file a takedown on someone elses behalf?

 * No

* Why is this such a big deal / big process?

 * It's actually very informal, but dealing with sensitive information can be a bit of a big deal. Reddit modmail is not an appropriate avenue for private information.

* Are takedowns logged?

 * From here on, yes, at /r/picstakedown

Hundreds of posts to various subreddits a day on extremely low-effort and sometimes stolen content.

---

So, why do they try to do this? Well, money of course.

People *do* click on spam. Not that many people, but plenty do. If you can spam quickly, and all over the place, you are bound to make something.

In areas where this spam is common, a little USD in their pocket can go a long way. If you are making just $5 a day, then a nice $20 check from YouTube is a big bonus.

---

Why do I mention this? Well, I had my experience with low effort.

Last night the Cubs won their first world series in 108 years. It is a pretty big deal. Right outside the cubs home field in Chicago, a large crowd gathered, watched, and when the Cubs one, they broke into massive celebration.

I wasn't there. I was at my home a good handfull of miles away. 

But there was a webcam on the side of the block, pointing right at Wrigley. I watched from this webcam, and once the Cubs were close to win, I started recording it.

the cubs won, I recorded about a minute of celebration. I popped my clip into Premiere, compressed it, and sent it off to youtube.

With a little good timing, a few submissions to reddit, I gained over 180,000 views in one night.

For 2 minutes of work

From a video source that was not my own.

Ofcourse, spammers don't get that many clicks! People want to watch my video, not some spammers video!

Well, there are two factors here.

First, Spammers have quantity of quality. I only had to make about 6 posts all over reddit to get my traction. After that (since people did want to watch it) they started sharing it, and the people sharing it started sharing it, and so forth. 

Spammers don't get that, so instead of posting 6 times and letting the momentum take over, the spammers post **600** times and don't bother with momentum (usually). Scale this up, and you've got yourself some views.

Secondly, lots of spam can be watchable. I go back to ""vine compilations"" that have millions of views from obvious spam accounts. If the video content is good and *not* your own, you *can* get that momentum *along with* the quantity of posting. This is not foolproof and is basically a ""cross your fingers and pray"" for the spammers, but it can work.

Lastly, lots of spammers also have click-rings. I won't go too deep into those, but lots of groups of other spammers sharing and clicking on videos is the gist of it.

---

So how much money could I have made? 

Well, I am at 381,000 views as I type this. Assuming a comfortably low CPM estimate, I would have recieved $500 bucks, possibly more, probably less ($300 is a very safe low estimate)

For 2 minutes of work and a little good timing.

Anyways, the month of October is always an interesting one at /r/pics – for some, it’s the best time of the year. For others, the worst. This time around we did not offer any filtering, we simply directed any users to consider posting in our contest alongside or instead of in the main subreddit. This was impressively effective in terms of the contest, but not so much for reducing traffic of the subreddit. Next time we hope to have our flair filtering expended a bit farther, but a year from now is a long time, so we will get there when we get there.

Anyways, lets chat about the month.

| Total Actions       | 42493 | Up ~ 7000  | This was a very, very busy month for us, especially automod. There are   multiple factors contributing to this factor, looking at it from a small   investigation - This month it mostly comes down to automod - Basically,   /r/pics has restrictions on new accounts. We are not a subreddit that   outright bans new users from using our subreddit, however posts from new   users requires moderator approval. This process is completely automated and   requires nothing for the user, it just means they won't see their post in   /new for a few minutes. A moderator comes by, checks for rules and other   checks to make sure the account is not malicious. If these checks pass, the   post is approved and the user is good to go. Doing this is extremely   effective at stopping spam, and a necessary evil for a subreddit this size.   Keeping this in mind, what brings new users in the most? Holidays and   halloween of course, because everyone has a picture to post, users are   creating new accounts, and their posts are getting approved after being filtered   out. Combine this with slightly increased spam, and numbers shoot up by 7k |   |

| Comment Removals    | 10710 | Up ~ 2000  | As for the comments, this was a more diverse increase. Along with   halloween comes a lot of unsavory comments. /r/pics does have basic   commenting guidelines and these were enforced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   |
| Posts Approved      | 3720  | Up ~ 400   | If so many submissions were removed, how was there such a smaller   increase of approvals?

* 2 moderators had 1 or less action.

* Despite all the craziness, we keep our steady ratio of 36% of all actions done this month being done by automation. This number just fascinates me

* Reddit admins made no actions

* We recieved no takedown requests

Welcome to Uber, &lt;name&gt;.

Sorry about this poor Uber experience - I did check the route you took and it wasn't ideal. It seems that your driver took a couple of wrong turns, which extended the trip unnecessarily.

According to our estimates, your trip should've cost you about $51.51. Therefore, I have adjusted the fare and reimbursed the difference to your credit card. Please allow 1-3 business days for the money to be back in your account. 

Our goal is to connect you to a reliable ride no matter where you are going. As we aim to provide a comfortable trip to all our riders, it's really disappointing to know that the partner driver failed to meet our standards on this trip. Feedback like this helps us support and educate drivers.

Recently, /r/pics presented a small essay on how bans are used in our subreddit. This essay was hosted on the subreddits own website, mods.pics. Our own website is not mostly a result of boredom from myself as well as a helpful repository of information. HTML is also much more powerful than reddits own markdown, but thats just me being a grump.

That aside, the other reason that makes having a website is sweet, sweet data. Analytical tools simply aren’t possible on reddit, but on your own site, the world is your oyster. Almost every site will have some form of analytics, and mods.pics is no exception. We personally use Google Analytics which gives us access to some awesome data.

So, just how many people clicked on our sticky? Well, keep in mind these numbers aren’t fully accurate. Plenty of people block tracking scripts, myself included.

From October 18th (day of the sticky) to October 24th, mods.pics had a total of 28,257 users connect with a total of 29,354 sessions being made. For reference, the 14th to the 18th had 26 users with 29 sessions.

The 18th, the first day of the sticky, was the most popular with 6,690 sessions

The 19th had 5,349 sessions and 4,185 on the 20th. Traffic at this point was fairly constant.

Sessions rarely explored the rest of the site, with an average pages/session of 1.05. Bounce rate was a very sad 96.23%. (However, the page was simply text anyways, which leads to a higher bounce rate itself)

Out of these 29,354 sessions, 75.51% had their language code set to en-us. 9.18% were set to en-gb and 3.58% to en-ca. After this, the highest non en language was German, with with about 2%

This doesn’t quite match up with estimate of actual country, which cuts down the people from the States and distributes them a little farther out. 62.58% United States, 8.6% Canada (set your language code correctly, eh?), 7.4% UK, 3.5% Australia, 3% Germany, 1.5% Sweden.

Among sessions who also had a City set, New York was the most popular with 2.16% of all sessions. London was close behind with 1.7%

When it comes to mobile, out of all sessions, 15,646 (53%) came from a mobile client, 11,336 (38%) came from a desktop, and 2,372 (8%) came from a tablet.

In terms of browser, 17,262 (58%) came from Chrome. 6,816 came from mobile Safari and 2,769 came from desktop Safari. After this, Firefox had 1,583 sessions and IE had 419 sessions. Poor Microsoft Edge couldn’t quite get there, with 235 sessions. At least it isn’t Opera Mini, (10 sessions)

When it comes to mobile, out of units that had a device ID set and passed to google, 7,079 Users came from Apple iPhone, 1,883 from Apple iPad. Past that, 293 came from a Nexus 6P and 236 came from a Nexus 5X. Samsung phones use different device identifiers per model and that makes it hard to track how many exactly visited. 37 sessions from the HTC M9, and don’t worry, I see you, 24 users with a Microsoft Lumia 950 XL.

Shame to the ~40 Sessions from Galaxy Note 7 users.

All in all, 9,005 sessions came from iOS and 8,732 sessions came from Android. 99% of all users. Windows phone made up the remaining .99% with 150 sessions. 5 sessions came from Blackberry. 1 from Firefox OS...and somehow, someone also visited from the Playstation Vita browser.

Of desktop clients, 8,309 came from Windows and 2,669 from Mac OS. 337 came from a flavor of Linux and 128 from Chrome OS. And 6 from the Xbox operating system. 

Of all these sessions, 28,033 were completely new, whereas 1,321 were return visitors. Less than 2% stayed on the page longer than 30 seconds, and 23 sessions stayed longer than 1,800 seconds, for some reason.

We have a very large rule change to announce today.

This is the largest change we have made to our ruleset in a long long time. It’s important we involve you in the process and get your feedback.

However, because it is such a large change, we need to run a trial. There is no other way for us to get the data we need to really decide on this. Will it generate too many mod actions? How will the loud minority react? How will the silent majority react? What volume of posts are we looking at? Things like these have no simple answer without just trying it.

Starting from the time of this post, we will be doing a **7-day trial** of the following changes. Once these 7 days are up, the rules will be reverted. We will then take some time to reflect over our internal data and what we as moderators think as well as what you the community think, and what the people affected by these changes think.

Without further ado, here are the **temporary changes**:

* Remove Rule 4 and 5
* Add Rule 8

---

Rule 8 is as follows:

* All titles must follow the title guidelines listed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/wiki/titles)

The title guidelines are as follows:

1. must convey accurate information

2. must not ask for votes

3. must not ask ""does anybody else?""

4. must not be about a ""cake day""

5. must not request a photoshop

6. must not address a specific redditor

7. must not be of the kind ""fuck you if you do this”

8. must not be a [fixed] version of a previous post  

9. must not be a ""reply”

10. must not ask for general information

11. must not be a sob story

12. must not ask for feedback

13. must not be cliche'd

---

Woah there champ, that is a lot of guidelines! 

*Guidelines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 were all pre-existing rules* under Rule 4 and 5. *That leaves 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 are new rules.* (13 was only flaired before, now they face removal.)

---

Here are some examples of titles that would break the new guidelines:

**Guideline 7, “must not be of the kind ""fuck you if you do this”""**

* “Fuck you if you park like this”

Restructuring a title is an easy way to get around this, just like all title guidelines. They are not meant to be content restrictions, just title restrictions. The new title could be ""Why would you park like this?"" and would be acceptable.

**Guideline 9, ""must not be a ""reply""""**

Many posts are ""replies"" to other posts. While we disallow calling out specific people, we have always been relaxed when it comes to replies. We admit some of our coolest posts have come from reply posting (dae cabshots) - However in general these happen all too often, when people could just be posting comments and making one awesome thread, rather than a few ""eh"" threads. 

* ""To the guy with the cool swing, check out my awesome slide!""

This is one of the few titles guidelines that is a content restriction, almost any reply post will get deleted under this. ^I ^think ^it ^would ^be ^a ^good ^idea ^to ^just ^make ^this ^a ^separate ^rule, ^but ^time ^will ^tell. 

**Guideline 10, ""must not ask for general information""**

Not all questions are asking for general information, but many are! 

* Just found this watch in my attic, anyone know what its worth?

* Who took this picture?

* Where is this building?

There are many, many ways to get answers on reddit. /r/whatisthisthing and /r/tipofmytongue are 2 great examples. 

**Guidelines 11, ""must not be a sob story""**

This one is ultimately very subjective, and something we are going to monitor closely and be as fair as possible with. A few things out of the way

* Not all posts with backstory will qualify as a sob story.

* Just because something is ""uninteresting"" or ""sentimental"" does not make the post a sob story.

We are going to be fairly strict on the definition of this. 

*things that will be removed will be posts that grieve losts love ones or pets, ""starving artist"" type claims, etc...*

This is a title restriction and *not* a content restriction.

* My grandmother just died, wanted to show the world the best photo of her.

* I'll miss my best friend forever.

Both of these titles can be reworded easily to fit and would be perfectly acceptable.

* Best picture of my grandmother

* Favorite shot of my dog

Some things worth nothing, *mentioning loss or death does not make a sob story.* - For example, ""Crazy picture of my late-grandmother"" is **not** considered a sob story. 

This is something we will ultimately need your feedback on. **please comment with thoughts, including examples, feel free to link to posts or ask questions** - We are giving this a go, so bear with us.

**Guideline 12, ""must not ask for feedback""**

* My girlfriend just painted this and thought it was awful, hope reddit could show her some love!

* I don't think my paintings are very good, what do you think?

Specifically titles that ask for feedback on the *content itself* - Am I ugly/sexy/fat included. Both posts  would be fine with titles that did not ask for feedback. **Asking for feedback in the comments is fine.**

**Guideline 13, must not be cliched**

We have some CSS that flags titles that are extremely overused - Here it is actually: https://www.allthefoxes.me/img/10/09-ae6c.png Those posts will be removed now.

^^Luckily, ^^so ^^will ^^that ^^css, ^^its ^^from ^^a ^^time ^^far ^^before ^^automod ^^was ^^in ^^wide ^^use.

We have been working hard this month on a few different things, most notably getting our new mods up to date with the processes of modding /r/pics - They are coming along well.

---

#What we did

* Updated some internal notes to a better system (thanks /u/bytester and /u/adeadhead)

* Re-defined our standards for active moderators. Created a system to handle inactive moderators.

#What we are discussing now

This is a small section I would like to include that just contains things we are in the process of discussing.

**Just because something is here does not mean it will come to pass. Sometimes results don't come after discussion until many months later.**

* Consideration of expanding rule 5 to include removing any request for information

* In discussion of creating a much better and smoother process for user requested copyright and personal takedowns

* Evergrowing discussion on the possible expansion of rule 1 to include any scans.

* More flair stuff

---

I also personally have created a better ""To-Do list"" of smaller items that all mods can access, hopefully enabling a little better productivity.

#Contests

One thing we are also talking about is potential contests. Monthly photography contests are being considered, however to start, a Halloween content may be considered. Just want some general feedback on this, let me know what you think.

Do not use the report button as a super downvote, a way to pitch your comedy routine to mods, or for shitposting.

Abusing reports will get your account suspended from all of reddit. Very quickly. 

It's time to stop.

* Watching /r/pics/new to remove rulebreaking posts

* Answering user modmail

And other general mod duties.

A few notes: 

* You should become comfortable with our rules and the way we enforce them. I highly suggest new mods simply watch for a while, see how we repond in modmail before trying to respond themselves. See how and what we remove before you go and start enforcing the rules. 

* You do not have access to our own backroom subreddit for 60 days

* You *do* have access to our slack channel. PM me with an email address that you wouldn't mind 300ish other moderators having access to get an invite.

* You do not have the ability to ban for 30 days (Ask full mods in slack for anything that needs done. In most cases, banning is not needed to resolve an issue.)

* [RES](/r/enhancement) and [toolbox](/r/toolbox) are required extensions. Please install them.

Account farming

The interesting part about modding /r/pics is the weird spam we get. Yes, we do indeed get the run of the mill hot sexy grills in your area spam, and we expect you to take care of that. However, we also get a unique type of spam we call account farming (af). It's worth reading [this general information post](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/) for a little more detail on spammers if you aren't familiar with the type already, and our own /r/pics tutorial on spotting them even if you are. ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/wiki/modonly/account_farming))

Account farmers typically have broken english, overuse punctuation, etc and tend to post low quality stock images typically with shitty titles (Beautify City New York ... Wow ...). These accounts can be very hard to pick out sometimes though, and we don't have very good guidelines in effect to give you to help stop these accounts

Because of that, I don't really expect you to. Things in our modqueue that have the filter reason of ""Young Account"" should probably just be left to sit there until another mod checks it out. If you approve account farming submissions, ill probably give you shit in PM, and I can be cranky, so try not to do that.
tl;dr - [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/wiki/modonly/account_farming)

Questions:

Well, there isn't really much to say here, you have 30 days of basically learning and getting into it, and after that, we will hold you up to an activity standard. Its not much, usually just within the amount of reason, but you should be striving for ***at least 100*** actions a month, and that's absolutely nothing here. 

Have issues? Questions? Concerns? 

You have two new mod liasons you can contact for any help! They are /u/siouxsie_siouxv2 and /u/mattythedog. If you have questions about spam, they are likely best directed to /u/cwenham, our in-house spam expert. 

If you have questions about policy, modship, or anything a bit more meta, then I would be the one to ask. 

However, *all questions* can always be asked in modmail, or better yet, our Slack channel.

The sheet currently has the user paste in the output of another application which shows us metrics and data. 

The sheet then takes this data, put it down below, pulling the data we want, color coding it, giving them ranks, etc.

[Like this](https://www.allthefoxes.me/img/08/28-8371.png)

Currently, we want to use all this data to give everyone a final ""score"" and we also want to weigh certain metrics above others.

---

##The problem

Currently, score is calculated via rank. If there are 4 categories and person A is rank 1 in them all, his score is 4. Lower score wins. A rank of 2, 1, 2, 2 = total score of 7. We can weigh some highly by simply dividing by two for double weight. If the first category is worth ""double"" then a rank of 1, 1, 1, 1 means the final score is 3.5

This is not super helpful or reliable, and there is an obvious problem here.

Let's say that person A has 50 more of X than person B. person A is rank 1 and gets 1 point

If person A now is only **1** ahead of person B...then he still gets just one point.

So the score really cannot scale well.

The other issue is the data is mixed. Certain things are percantage to goals, (100%= meeting goal) where some percentages are just rates of something (i.e. attach rates) where some are just raw numbers (40 of X)

---

The idea currently is to really just roll with what we have and call it a feature, but this doesn't seem ideal. Can anyone think of a better solution?

Hello! July was a pretty big month for us internally. A lot of our projects are really kicking off and we have some exciting things to share in the coming months, and I want to share what I can with you today.

Some of these upcoming changes may not be user-facing. We are restructuring and rewriting our various policies, and anything that affects the end user will be posted as a sticky. 

---
#What we did this month

We worked on quite a few things this months, notably:

##New mod search
Just yesterday, applications for modship were closed, and we have just begun the process of narrowing down who will be in the batch of upcoming moderators. We expect all new mods to be added by the end of August. You will not be contacted if we do not select you. Please hang tight, don’t PM us endlessly about it.

##Banned misleading titles

Deciding what to do with misleading titles has always been a bit hard for us. Initially, we just flaired them. Then, we decided to add a “three strikes you’re out” rule for them. After observing what happened with this new policy, we decided to take the next step and simply remove any posts that are misleading. 

Minor things can always be corrected by flair, we are more concerned about flat out lies or misleading posts, not little mistakes.

##Exchange

We partnered with RedditGifts to create an awesome photography exchange!  It isn’t too late to check it out and sign up! [Click me!]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4vms8m/announcing_the_rpics_photography_exchange_on/)

##Imgur

Some of you remember our discussion about Imgur. At this moment in time, we have opted to take no action, however we may decide on a different path, and we will keep you up to date as things develop.

---
#Internal Changes

So, I also wanted to let you folks know about what we are doing internally with /r/pics. 

Moderation on reddit is a bit messy, a lot of tools are essentially ancient code that simply can’t keep up with our usage, and we rely on many external tools to do what we need to do.

In addition, policy, structure, and all that is not a simple task. Keeping things “in order” is not great when you use a platform you don’t actually control. Other sites I do moderation work on, for example, have a very clear tree structure of command, policies, etc. On reddit, our hierarchy is an unreadable blob and while we have policy, it can be intimidating to get started, and be consistent.

This isn’t just a pics or a default problem, but a reddit problem itself and it is not a problem Reddit the company can solve.

With this in mind, /r/pics is taking the time to create a more welcoming environment for our moderators and a more consistent environment for our users by refreshing the subreddit, its policies, and creating what is essentially, **the** /r/pics SOP. 

We called it “Make Pics Great” (no again). The goal is to make the subreddit a better place to moderate, give our policies a facelift, and create a better experience for our users. 

This process will be mostly internal, and you the end user may not see too much, but we are working on improving at the very least and we want you to know that.

We plan on refreshing and doing the following:

* Refresh and official-ize our internal voting process for new policy -- **In progress**

* Update moderator activity requirements, enforcement policy, and all the ""meta mod"" stuff

* Create a ""project"" system and policy, allowing moderators to work on internal projects more effectively, and giving them a central point of co-ordination and direction.

* Rewrite our sidebar, compress our rules. 

* Make the /r/pics wiki actually do something, create a full rule index there. Few other ideas

* Create a **real** ban policy and mute policy -- Such as use, duration, and more

* Create a **real** modmail policy -- Use, responses, how much can we actually circlejerk in one thread? -- **On hold**

* Create a better /r/toolbox usage and note policy, including standardizing notes, colors, etc

* Make the /r/pics wiki cool, as well as our own internal subreddit wiki

* In line with the sidebar re-write, update and reword our rules.

* Clean up our internal mod notes (not looking forward to this one)

* Better policies, and welcoming for new moderators

* More integrations into our slack, automation is the future

* Document it all

* Create a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document set for internal use and referral. (We are also considering making these documents public so other subreddits may use them, as well as for transparency.)

* CSS updates for /r/pics as well as internal subreddit

* Anything else we forget

---

These items are in no particular order

##Why am I telling you all this?

Well, for one, transparency. That's the point. We want those who are interested to know what we are doing

Secondly, one of the goals of this project is to make the subreddit more consistent and better for our users. Not involving the users would be silly. 

##Why are we doing this?

Well, I don't think /r/pics is broken. I don't think we NEED to fix ourselves. Most of us are all happy with the way things are.

However, reddit doesn't give us much of a platform, we need to take the only steps we can to improve it further. Since we can't change reddit itself, we have to change how we do things.

It can always be better. Lots of defaults are a *mess* - /r/pics wants to strive to be the best in terms of moderation, consistancy, transparency, etc. We want to be *the* default to mod. We want to do it right. 

This is not an easy thing to do with such an established moderation team as well as twelve million subscribers. But we want to try.

##You care too much about meaningless internet things

Only me, I'm just dragging everyone else along.

#Our problems with Imgur

Before we go any further, it is important you understand why we have issues with imgur currently

##**1.** Clickjacking

By and large the biggest issue here is that imgur clickjacks direct links. You might have not even noticed! Most (but not all) mobile clicks (and sometimes desktop too) to a DIRECT imgur link (i.e. http://i.imgur.com/eYltdWW.png ) **ARE REDIRECTED** to http://imgur.com/eYltdWW

###Who cares?

Well we do for one, and we know a lot of users care too. This is called clickjacking and is pretty bad. When you click on a link, you should generally be taken to the link you clicked on, not a different one?

It's quite clear that imgur does this for two reasons: 1. They want you to see the ""Open in App"" button which will get you to download their app -- And of course 2. They need the ad money.

I will elaborate more on this in a moment

##2. Social

Imgur has far outgrown reddit. It is its own social community with its own norms and their own (bad IMO) memes, and so on. While this isn't particularly a bad thing, it doesn't line up with what /r/pics needs, which is just a fast imagehost. Not an image sharing social media site

##If any new site were to come up today and it does what Imgur currently does, we would not allow the new site

Imgur gets its pass through its history.

---

#Elaborating

What Imgur is doing is good for their business, and I can't really get particularly mad at that. However as I said above, it doesn't line up with what /r/pics is looking for.

Imgur needs the ad revenue, Imgur needs to grow its userbase, but we feel they are taking advantage of our users to do so. 

---

#Contact

We have had some minor contact with Imgur, which is rare, but it happens. We had to make a big fuss just about a bit over a year ago (I think) when spam was a much bigger problem. They were mostly able to solve our issue, and things continued on. We finally had Imgur reach out to us the other day. While it was good to chat, it confirmed that we do believe its time we look for alternative solutions. I will not share our conversation as I believe it would be a violation of the expected privacy.

---

#Alternate solutions

Over the past few months, a lot of new options have come up, and we have a lot of possible ""solutions"" to our issue.

Reddit has built in image hosting now. Its fast, works well, most of the kinks have been worked out. It even has added features I didn't even know I wanted until it came around, such as having images be deleted when the post is deleted (by OP)

We also recently introduced our Verified Photographer program, which allows both professional and amateur photographers to link to their own websites (with some restrictions)

With these in place, we have a lot more breathing room we can work with.

Understand that we as a modteam are still talking about this, nothing is set in stone, I just want to hear what you have to think.

##1. Do Nothing

While I doubt personally this will happen, its a valid outcome. Maybe Imgur address our concerns and we can continue on happily ever after.

##2. Direct links only (except albums)

Full disclousure, this was our original plan. We had done it before and we could break it open again. The problem is that when you upload to imgur, the default link is now a single image album. Since AutoMod would be used for this rule, it would be incredibly hard to enforce (since even single image albums are still albums)

This also doesn't really solve the clickjacking issue, but starts us in the right direction

##3. The Final Solution: Ban Imgur entirely

I don't really know if anyone wants to push this button, but it is valid. We have a multitude of great image hosts out there we can use, as well as our verified system. Doing this solves every issue, but is rather nuclear.

This also means we wil need to find a good alternative to albums, and I havn't really found a good one yet

##4. Option X

Basically a placeholder for any alternative solution you or we can think of, the above 3 aren't our only options. We would love to hear from you

---

#Note

Imgur is a business. Imgur needs to make money, I can't blame them for that. However that doesn't mean our goals for an image host at /r/pics needs to line up with that.

#Why though?

To be honest, I can give you a list of bad reasons or I can just say that I think its important that the people who work for reddit understand what *the people who work for reddit* actually do. Understanding how the site runs, what makes it run, what users do, and what moderators do is exceptionally important

No, I am not snarkposting this as a ""Mods are special give us things"" type post.

I legitmately think that Reddit does need to focus itself down a bit. Get every member of the team **IN THE COMMUNITY** - So many admins have blank profiles, just lurkers, or anything like that. Nothing wrong with a lurker, but the first step to ""fixing"" something is getting knee deep in it.",ideasfortheadmins,"All reddit administrators should take some amount of time ""off"" to experience large, small, and new subreddit moderation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/4u72so/all_reddit_administrators_should_take_some_amount/

Mostly in June we worked on a few things that laid groundwork for some future updates

##Survey 2016

We fished up a survey, had you all answer it, and gave all survey takers a special flair. Data is avalible for public use, see http://mods.pics/survey2016/

##Continued growth of verified users

We offer verification! Users who verify themselves as artists or photographers get better posting rights to their own content. With this system, we are going to be able to do a lot of cool things

##A few other things for future updates

We are working on some updates, notably to how we host and link to content. You will get to hear more about this soon!

---

#Basically...

/r/pics gets hundred of submissions a day, and a post on the front page gets thousands if not millions of clicks. 

This is an interesting situation for us. We love seeing amazing and new original content, and the stories of redditors. It inspires many of us, and its not uncommon to see us chatting about our favorite posts of the day when not spamming /r/partyparrot gifs

---

I'm sure you've seen it before, but we often get a lot of posts about a redditors new business, or success story, or something along those lines, and we recently have been discussing these posts.

#The pros

* these posts are often cool and unique, and offer insight to a lot of redditors on the creation of product in a unique way

* It's OC

* They are highly upvoted, usually

* They are personal, and are a cool way to connect with our community!

---

#The cons

* Many of these posts are not exactly natural. We see many, many of these posts ended up being a purposeful advertising tactic, though we don't learn until months later. This makes us feel as if you were deceived.

* In extreme cases, vote manipulation occurs

* At the end of the day, it can be considered spam in many situations

* No one really likes underhanded ads

* Content is very blog like - While we don't mind captions, there is often more text than image. We remove blogs, but ""blogs"" in an imgur album get a de-facto pass

---

#Grey-area

* Special deals / discounts for redditors

* Funding (talented?) redditors

* Not technically against reddit rules

* We wish to encourage OC, but don't want to allow self-promotion. Both go hand in hand

---

Before going on, I also want to explain something else

#The one link ""rule""

We don't have it in the sidebar, but generally, we only allow any content creator, like photographers, artists, or small business owners, to post just a single link to their content in a top level comment. The link must also be at least one click away from an actual shopping page.

##What this means

Creators cannot reply to everyone with links to their site

Creators cannot link directly to a storefront

Creators can only have one comment with their site / source in it, and it must be top level

##Why?

This greatly curbs spam and is general attitude toward all the above posts. As long as the one link rule is met, we are happy.

---

#The solution...?

And that is why we come here, simply because we want input from the community itself on this issue. Should we just keep on keeping on? Should we be more strict? Perhaps more loose?

---

#Option A

##Ban these posts entirely

###Pros

* Completely eliminates the issue

###Cons

* Can punish content creators

* Is really strict 

* Not all of these posts are malicious, this heavily punishes the non-mal posts

* Difficult to fairly enforce

---

#Option B

##Just keep doing what we are doing

###Pros / Cons

* Well, this is what led us to this discussion

---

#Option C

##Remove the restrictions entirely

###Pros

* More content creation

###Cons

* Greatly increased spam

* Greatly increased manipulation

* Everyone and their mother might just try

* Reddit spam rules require some enforcement

---

#Option X

##You help us decide

And this is where you come in. We have our 2 extremes and our do nothing option. Now we need help figuring out how to proceed. Please, tell us your ideas, this is an open forum. Feel free to just discuss as well

##link to previous post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/4mb4ps/new_build_old_gpu_everything_was_fine_at/

##TL;DR:

Basically, I was having bluescreens while doing any graphically intensive applications. Games, AIDA, furmark. etc. The error was 0x124, WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_HARDWARE_ERROR - Specifically,analysis said it was device : ""8086:2f08 - AKA, ""Xeon E7 v3/Xeon E5 v3/Core i7 PCI Express Root Port 3"""" - the error also confirmed it was PCI related

I tried many, many different things. Different slots for GPU, reinstall drivers, try old drivers, reinstall Windows, etc. Nothing really did the trick. Same issues, no matter what. Stress tests killed it, though furmark killed it very fast, under 3 minutes, whereas it lasted an hour of AIDA64. Sometimes i couldnt play a game of overwatch, sometimes I could get through 2-3

Eventually, I bought a very cheap GTX 710, and it ran furmark fine for at least 2 hours, far longer than the 390 made it.

I tried a few more things, like different PSU cables, and nothing did the trick, so I went and sent the graphics card in for RMA

**In the mean time, I have been using a friends 6850, and have had ZERO issues**

Today, XFX told me they couldnt find a single issue, and I really just don't know. It really doesn't seem to be the motherboard, since the 6850 is doing so well. 

My only thought now is maybe its the PSU? I should be using well under 750 watts

I don't know..

I don't have the 390 back yet to do any testing. What might be happening here?",buildapc,"After lots and lots of troubleshooting, I was sure my graphics card was going bad.

#We changed our passwords

Subreddit and mod account takeovers are prevalent right now, and always an issue. One of our moderators had their account taken over and vandalized the subreddit. Since then, most mods did a password update as we wait for 2FA. Use a password manager.

Well, that was really it, actually. Slow month for us. I would be lying if I said we had a bunch of cool things we are finishing up. But we are discussing a few things as we go along, and hopefully you will see more soon

I am closing my ZNC service :( There are far too many things that suddenly popped into my life, and I need to cut back on projects. The ZNC project is rarely used, and I can't justify running it or paying for it anymore.

I am really sorry about this, I know I had plans for SSL. I just can't support it at this time. Its not just money, its simply being able to manage things at this time. Running a tiny znc for myself is fine. Running it for many people is a project..one I just can't dedicate to anymore.

**What is your parts list? **

http://pcpartpicker.com/list/3qRmPs

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

**edit: Further update after the below**

I bought a cheap GT 710, and 1 hour of furmark later and my system was totally fine. the r9 390 never made it past 3 minutes. However, the 390 still does okay in real world situations, such as playing Dota. Right now im letting it spectate games and just seeing howlong it takes to die. This kind of thing is really frustrating because I know the issue still exists but FurMark seems to be the only thing pushing it hard enough to kill the system quickly. But enough of anything brings it down, anything graphically intensive.

I contacted XFX 2 days ago and am waiting for a reply from them. Really not much I think I can do at this point. I did re-install windows, which seemed promising at first, but in the end nothing changed. All my temps still read as fine, I really don't know whats going on :/

Day 0: The computer is built at a friends house. Everything goes pretty smoothly. Didn't turn on the first time..forgot to plug it in. Everything else went well. Installed windows, applications, etc. 0 issues, no overclock

Day 1: Some overclocking starts to happen as well as gaming. Nothing too intense, a few matches of Overwatch. The CPU is now at 4.2ghz@1.2volts. Uneventful...except for one bluescreen on startup. Since this was the first issue, I basically dismissed it. No other issues.

Day 2 (today): In the morning, thigns are well. Machine was on overnight just fine, installing a few other games and programs. Life went on as normal. I got home, browsed the internets for a long while, and then tonight I finally sat down and played some games. I got into some overwatch..watched for about, say, 8 minutes. Right as I went to play, dead. Black screen. Now is when things get real. I sigh, restart, and take a look at the dump file, though I don't look into it deeply

The bugcheck was 0x124 - AKA a hardware error. I automatically assume its my overclock, and I actually give it some more voltage. Which is usually what that can mean. I'm now at 4.2ghz@1.3v

I try overwatch again, and get through a whole game. Black screen. 

I immdietly take off my overclock and start investigating.

I analyzed the the minidump, and it showed that it was an 0x124, with paramater one being 0x4...A PCI-E related failure. Graphics card related. Doing a bit more digging however showed that the device that supposedly caused the issue was 8086:2f08 - AKA, ""Xeon E7 v3/Xeon E5 v3/Core i7 PCI Express Root Port 3""

At this point, I at least know its my graphics card / PCI / This pci specifically. I decide to verify, and with no overclock on the CPU, I furmark the graphics card, and get my black screen again in about 1.5 minutes. 

For the most part, at least this narrows down the issue.

So I decided I would try a new PCI slot. I reboot, use DDU to remove my drivers, pull out the card, and put it in the next slot down. Reboot and install the new drivers. Except they failed. AMD installer had no good explanation for me and it simply said ""Driver Install Failed"" - Retrying this yielded no luck

I reseated the card in the 2nd slot, and it bluescreened on attempted install of drivers. Though didnt make it long enough to give me a dump.

I despertey tried the third slot too and had the same issues.

So the question is..what now? Its my motherboard or my graphics card..right? I am assuming I should buy a super cheap 20$ graphics card, try it in my system, stress test it, and if it fails, its my mobo, if it works, its my GPU? Am I missing something?

I just bought this board from Microcenter, do I still need to RMA or should I just take it back to Microcenter if it is the board? The card is a transplant from the old build.

#Background Information

To understand this drama, we need to understand exactly what we are talking about. The drama here mostly relates to Counter Strike: Global Offensive. CS:GO is a tactical first person shooter made by Valve. 

Valve is *very* hands off with their communities, and tends not to interfere with CSGO outside updating it, and sponsoring the Majors, quarterly tournaments for the best of the best.

These Majors and any other Counter Strike tournaments are not actually run by Valve, but they are run by a tournament organizing group or league. Examples include MLG (Major League Gaming), CEVO, and ESL

ESL is our focus here. ESL is by far the most well known of these companies in E-sports (perhaps behind MLG)

##Rumor spreads of WESA

A while ago, we start hearing about WESA. What it is, no one is really sure. Rumors spread that it may be some kind of exclusivity league, or things of that nature, which would not be good for the CS competitve scene. 

/r/globaloffensive is cautious and worried about WESA, but life marches on

#WESA is formed

WESA. the World Esports Association is formed. WESA states thier mission is:

&gt;In an effort to further professionalize esports, ESL has been working closely with some of the most renowned, industry-leading esports teams to create an open and inclusive organisation to oversee standardized tournament regulations, player representation as well as revenue sharing for teams.

While at a first glance, this does seem like a very good idea, especially due to Valves hands off nature with CS, alarm bells start to ring in /r/GlobalOffensive

https://np.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4j6g1o/announcing_the_foundation_of_wesa_the_world/?

The most noatable thing about WESA you should know is that ESL has founded it, and it has a board of 5 members. 2 are always going to be people from ESL. 2 will be voted in by players, and one will be voted in by the four board members above. 

/r/GlobalOffensive is very concerned about this, stating issues with non-competition, greed, and a not so sly attempt at basically [taking over the world](https://np.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4j7to6/wesa_reassures_esports_world_with_plans_to/)

##Comments

https://np.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4j6g1o/announcing_the_foundation_of_wesa_the_world/d34530a

&gt;permanent board positions for ESL and 3 year long terms. this has to be a joke.

Oh, also worth mentioning the head of this new WESA used to work for FIFA

https://np.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4j6g1o/announcing_the_foundation_of_wesa_the_world/d341ck0

&gt;I'm really curious what Valve, Blizzard or Riot are going to say about this. Also ESL deciding which tournaments are good and which are bad is not exactly a good thing, not in a long run.

https://np.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4j6g1o/announcing_the_foundation_of_wesa_the_world/d345cci

&gt;So open and inclusive this only includes a one game, a few teams, and has been discussed behind closed doors for 15 months.

#Thigns heat up in a dramatic AMA

As the confusion and anger grow, the newly formed WESA decides to hole an AMA. It goes poorly

Hard to sum up but worth a read. Salt so intense not even /r/Dota2 can compare

#A dark truth revealed

Something said in the AMA very often in response to the question of ""Why aren't any other organizations / tournament organizers involved?"" is that WESA ""Talked with companies.."" ""...18 month long process..."" ""...reached out to..."" etc etc..

But just as it always does, it truly began to backfire as both MLG and CEVO, two big names in this industry, reveal [they were never contacted in the first place, ever](https://twitter.com/MrAdamAp/status/731185882867306496)

https://np.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4j7rum/cevo_hasnt_been_contacted_about_the_wesa_either/

#GlobalOffensive turns

The subreddit was at first concerned. Then they were very cautious. And now there is no other way to describe it - /r/GlobalOffensive has turned. Boycotts called, accusations flying, but in the end, not a soul seems to be left standing that trusts WESA and ESL, and readers are simply left wondering ""What the hell is even happening""

The largest question still unanswered is ""What exactly is WESA doing?""

And that can only be answered with time.

#Password Security

So I want to take this time to talk about password security. Reddit moderator or not. Until 2fa is supported here, it is VERY important that your password on reddit be strong, unique, and not social.

Even if you think you would have no reasons to be hacked, you never know. Spammers are always fishing for accounts to grab.

So this is a message to you, readers. My fellow mods, and anyone else

Don't be dumb with passwords. No password should be used across multiple sites. All passwords should be strong, avoid repetition, etc.

Most importantly, don't make your password *social*! Password cracking is not efficiant. Most of the time, people get passwords with ""social hacking"" - Don't use your birthday, name, moms name, etc in your password! Don't click fishy looking links! NEVER enter a password somewhere unless you are confident of the site you are entering it on, and always double check

I have a 2000 Honda Civic that has 149,945 miles on it. I bought it used not too long ago around December. It was in pretty good shape, a little bit noisy. I got it on a great deal.

A few days ago, I was idling while snacking on some food in the parking lot outside my work. I looked at the temperature gauge and saw it was much higher than normal.

Normally it sits about half way up when warm, never seen it get higher than that: http://i.imgur.com/BE1yPuF.png

But it looked like this: http://i.imgur.com/hP4ELH4.png

I was a bit scared, so I turned my car off for a minute. Turned it back on and the temperature went down slightly.

Then I started driving and it very rapidly went down to the normal temperature.

I am able to pretty consistently reproduce this issue.  Last night as I was driving home, my Check Engine light came on as well. (My Check Engine light is not very reliable though)

I manage many many projects. I'm constantly busy. I like it that way.

To do this, a re-install of the ZNC software is needed, and while the actual act of doing this is fairly small, there are many considerations.

In order for you to be ready for the change, and for me to make sure everything goes well with minimal downtime,

#SSL support will be added this summer

Likely in June, more fine dates will be announced

#What do you need to do?

If you are currently connecting to znc.allthefoxes.me by IP address, change the server address to znc.allthefoxes.me - This way you will (hopefully) not need to change anything when the switch happens

#What is actually being done?

To make the transition as seamless as possible, a new server is being started and all user configurations will be moved over to it, but this time, SSL (Secure Socket Layer) support will be added, meaning all connections will be encrypted. In addition, all server connections will be changed to SSL (so you don't need to do anything). Its very likely I will ONLY support SSL.

If for any reason you need a connection that is NOT encrypted, you need to email me BEFORE JUNE!

/r/pics gets hundreds and hundreds of posts a day. Many of these posts will get upvoted, and the select few will be put on our front page, and on the front page of reddit itself.

/r/pics is one of the faces a new user to reddit sees and we are a community based on sharing pictures. Anything from professional grade takes to that picture you took of your friend last night with your old iPhone 4 you have been really meaning to trade in.

Because of all this, title accuracy is important. For this reason we created the ""misleading title"" tag a long time ago to indicate to the reader that the title was misleading or wrong, and that they should look to the comments for more info.

---

In /r/pics, we also have many users who heavily post content from many other sources, such as imgur, instagram, tumblr, etc... We do welcome this (with some small restrictions) - But we also recognize that these users are the most likely to take an image and use its title without even bothering to check if its actually correct or not. 

We  ***ALSO*** recognize that this just happens sometimes as an honest mistake.

When we take all this knowledge and put it together, we came up with a simple solution.

If a user has three posts in /r/pics tagged as misleading, they will be banned. The ban will be temporary, and the user will be given One More Chance (c) - Futher infrations will result in a longer or even perma ban.

I don't want to dump the trace here, but I am finding basically nothing that would cause the computer to have these delays in startup. 

Disk Usage is low. CPU usage is low. Memory is fine, everything looks great, it just takes a long time to get going

There are strange gaps in usage that make no sense.

Was logged in at about 16 seconds and got to the desktop by 45-55. The computer had finished post-boot and started everything at 90

Note there is hardly any usage.

Storage is the same story, as well as memory. 

The only thing that is interesting is this view:

https://www.allthefoxes.me/img/04/s19-8454.png

Which shows that even while doing little, the CPUs clock was maxed. Temperatures were fine so it wasn't that

What do I do? What should I look for when there is nothing obvious.

Sorry about the title, /u/BritishEnglishPolice INSISTED on it.

---

Let's talk about the month of March for pics. Not *too* much actually changed this month, but we had some foundations worked out which will better help us make changes in the future.

---

#Verified Photographer flair!

Our largest change in the month of March, we added a new process and flair for people to become verified on /r/pics - Verification allows photographers and artists to post directly from their site (assuming they follow reddit spam guidelines). With this, we hope to urge photographers to share their work with /r/pics, as well as show our subscribers some of the best! If you are interested in this flair, please read more in the sticky below this one!

#Automod refresh

Our automod config got a bit smarter. Nothing much to say here, but hopefully less false positives and better spam stopping

#New mods - Unlimited power

After working with our new moderators, all have been ""promoted"" to a full moderator. Each even got their own banhammer! We didn't need to share this time!

#Continued work on flair

Again, not too much happened public facing in the month of March, but we did manage to work a bit more on our flair, and there should be more to say about this in the upcoming months.

---

We expect to have one new rule addition out in the month of April, with more coming soon.

---

Now let's get to the part everyone cares about:

#Stats

In March 2016 we:

* Made 42680 moderator actions (Up about 3000 from last month)

* Removed a total of 14709 (Up only 300 or so from last month)

* Removed a total of 8276 comments

* Banned a total of 604 people (This includes temporary and permanent bans)

* Manually unbanned 41 people. (This does not include temp bans expiring)

* Ignored 953 of your reports (Compared to the thousands we get, keep reporting!)

* Stickied 25 posts or comments

* Locked 3 posts (and unlocked one)

In the month of March, reddit administrators made ***ZERO*** actions

In the month of March, we received a total of 1 post takedown requests.   
1 was completely unactionable  
0 were actioned by us  
0 were forwarded to reddit and no action was taken on our part",pics,"/r/pics March 2016 moderation report - Pics Mods: The New Gods? Science Says: ""Yes!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4dbw7h/rpics_march_2016_moderation_report_pics_mods_the/

Solving this issue is no simple task. We brainstormed, came up with ideas, and voted on them. Nothing would really pass, something would come up, or another idea would just not be possible on the reddit platform.

So we reached back

What have other subreddits done to increase quality?

Some tighten up on rules

Some create a poster whitelist

Most became selfpost only

---

At that last point, when we finally came up with the idea it was clear then. The best way to increase the quality of /r/pics was to make it self-post only.

---

Starting right now, /r/pics will only allow self posts. 

We are doing this to help stop and even reverse the decline of the sub. 

---

#Banning links

In addition, self promotion and spam has been a big problem lately. We have been absolutely flooded by run of the mill spam, as well as karma farmers - new accounts that steal comments and pictures in order to gain karma and sell their accounts. 

This kind of spam is incredibly hard to deal with. We decided along with self post only, we would just ban all links entirely.

Thank you.

I've decided I'll make one of these every month in the efforts of transparency and because everyone likes stats!

Here is the overview of our moderation and what we did over the month of Feburary

#New moderators

We added five new moderators just a few days ago! Thank you to all who applied, and ""congrats"" to the new mods as follows:

* /u/BANGEXPLOSIVE

#Flair improvements

We have changed up a bit of flair. 

We are still working on deciding if we want to just use ""politics"" and drop the election 2016 or keep both. 

We have added some new CSS classes to make flair a bit prettier, less scary and red

We have also expirimented a bit with raw content flairing (like ""people"" and ""scenery""). This is just something we are playing with right now.

---

And well that is really it, most of our focus this month was on the new mod search and dealing with spam

---

#Feb 2016 statistics:

In Feburary 2016, we:

1. Made a total of 39793 moderator actions (Up about 5k from last month)

2. Removed 14,206 submissions

3. Removed 8019 comments

4. Banned 686 people

5. Unbanned 36 of them (temp bans expiring don't add to this number, while temp bans do add to the number of bans)

6. Ignored 1023 of your reports

7. Made 31 sticky posts/comments

8. Locked 2 posts

9. Made 2777 of our comments green

---

1. Automoderator made 32% of all actions, including 6800 post removals and 6200 comment removals

2. Not including Automod, 6 moderators made 90% of all actions

3. 4 moderators made no actions. 

4. Reddit administrators made **two** moderator actions in /r/pics - Both were to remove more serious spam before we saw it. ",pics,/r/pics Feb 2016 moderation report,https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/48ewv8/rpics_feb_2016_moderation_report/

If you saw yesterday, we actually tried a bit of actual content flairing, things like ""people"" and ""scenery"". this was just a small test, to see how it would go and to test some fancy new flair css

---

This is great, and we do plan on adding more and more flairs to the roster

---

There is a problem that is arising though, and that is priority.

What do I mean by priority?

Let us say that 2 different flairs are applicable for a post. Which one of those flairs gets applied?

We can't ""combine"" them, since that would break the filters in most applications.

---

Currently, we only have this priority set:

1.**Removal flairs**

2. **Everything else**

Flairs higher on the list have a higher priority, and will get placed on a post instead of the ones below it.

The removal flairs are posts that are removed, and a flair is applied with the relevant rule broken. This flair will always have the highest priority, and thats okay since the posts can't be seen anyways.

---

But lets say a post is both a picture of text, and misleading. Which one ""wins?""

Picture of text wins, then we can't flair misleading

If misleading wins, then people filtering pictures of text will see a picture of text unless misleading is also filtered.

This causes issues, and is already.

---

Currently, our full flair roster is:

1. Removal flairs

2. politics (replaced Election 2016)

3. Picture of text

4. misleading

5. backstory

6. a few content flairs

---

This really isn't too much, but as we grow the flair system, how to prioritize them becomes an issue

---

So, I want some input. What do you think we should do, what we could do? how would you prioritize things? How would you solve this problem?~~Will NA dota win the major?~~ ",pics,Let's discuss flair priority,https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/480q8y/lets_discuss_flair_priority/

We added you to our mod-team because we thought you would be the best choice for our subreddit.

Your duties include:

* Cleaning out the modqueue (/r/pics/about/modqueue)

* Watching /r/pics/new to remove rulebreaking posts

* Answering user modmail

And other general mod duties.

---

A few notes: 

* You should become comfortable with our rules and the way we enforce them. I highly suggest new mods simply watch for a while, see how we repond in modmail before trying to respond themselves. See how and what we remove before you go and start enforcing the rules. 

* You do not have access to our own backroom subreddit for 60 days

* You *do* have access to our slack channel. PM me with an email address that you wouldn't mind 200ish other moderators having access to get an invite.

* You do not have the ability to ban for 30 days (Ask full mods in slack for anything that needs done)

* If you don't have them already, you should get RES from /r/enhancement and toolbox from /r/toolbox. It's possible to moderate without these, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Account farming

The interesting part about modding /r/pics is the weird spam we get. Yes, we do indeed get the run of the mill hot sexy grills in your area spam, and we expect you to take care of that. However, we also get a unique type of spam we call account farming (af). It's worth reading [this general information post](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/) for a little more detail on spammers if you aren't familiar with the type already, and our own /r/pics tutorial on spotting them even if you are. ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/wiki/modonly/account_farming))

Account farmers typically have broken english, overuse punctuation, etc and tend to post low quality stock images typically with shitty titles (Beautify City New York ... Wow ...). These accounts can be very hard to pick out sometimes though, and we don't have very good guidelines in effect to give you to help stop these accounts

Because of that, I don't really expect you to. Things in our modqueue that have the filter reason of ""Young Account"" should probably just be left to sit there until another mod checks it out. If you approve account farming submissions, ill probably give you shit in PM, and I can be cranky, so try not to do that, lel  
tl;dr - [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/wiki/modonly/account_farming)

Questions:

Well, there isn't really much to say here, you have 30 days of basically learning and getting into it, and after that, we will hold you up to an activity standard. Its not much, usually just within the amount of reason, but you should be striving for ***at least 100*** actions a month, and thats absolutely nothing.

Questions can be directed to our modmail at /r/pics, pm'd to me at /u/allthefoxes or in this thread, additional details will be provided on slack

Thank you for subscribing to /r/pics, and for reading this post

We are one of the most active subreddits on the entire site, and are nearly the highest (damn you askreddit) in terms of subscribers!

However, we are far from perfect. Our subreddit still has a lot of places to grow, and there are many things we have learned as moderators here.

---

#2016

We are a bit into 2016, but are talking a lot on ways to improve

##New moderators

Thank you for everyone who applied. We just finished our first round of going through the applications, and you can expect new moderators to be added around the start of March. Going through and reviewing all the applications take us a while, so thank you for your patience! Chances are, we will not contact you if you are not accepted, but thank you for applying! 

Keep an eye out, and again, I expect to add the new mods around March 1st.

##Flair

We have ben quickly adding more and more flairs to make is easier for users to filter out what they don't want to see. We have some more ideas for this, and expect it to be expanded in the future! We always like suggestions, so feel free to send us a modmail!

On desktop, the easiest way to do this is with [RES](/r/enhancement). On mobile, it depends on your client, check the subreddit for your mobile client.

#New rules

This is the slow front, but we are working on it. Just recently, we have added a ""no photoshop requests"" rule to rule 5, and we have some more ideas we are excited to show you in 2016.

---

#2015

Now, I did want to share some cool data about our year in 2015 with you.

In 2015, we had about 850 MILLION pageviews! We grew to 10,000,000 subscribers. We are getting about 100,000 pageviews every hour. That's insane. 

##Moderator actions

Now, unfortunately I wasn't able to keep consistant data on our moderator actions in 2015. The log only goes so far back :(

Instead, I will share with you some information about our moderations from January 2016 - February 2016, jus so you get an idea of what we are doing! 

In January 2016, we:

1. Made a total of 34,456 moderator actions. (Fairly low for a subreddit of this size!)

2. Removed 12,800 submissions

3. Removed 6,900 comments

4. Banned 647 people

5. Unbanned 45 of them ^

5. Ignored 1266 of your post reports! (This does not include multiple reports on one post)

6. Made 35 stickies

7. Locked 6 posts

8. Automoderator made 32% of all moderator actions. Including 6,100 post removals and 4000 comment removals

9. Not including Autmoderator, 5 moderators made 90% of all the moderator actions

10. Four moderators had no actions the whole month, nine more moderators had less than 100 actions.

11. Transparency - Reddit administrators made **one** moderator action in /r/pics in January.

First of all, please read https://www.reddit.com/r/Fox/comments/40kgpx/new_rpicturegame_moderation_system/

This has a listing of the official announcements, and the guidelines of being a picturegame moderator

---

Please keep those guidelines handy. If you break them (minus some minor mistakes..maybe), then you will be instantly removed.

Im going to be very strict about it. Only because this is a position where fucking up, well, really fucks everything up, so don't fuck up.

---

A couple of notes you should also be aware of:

1. **You cannot participate in game mod duties where you have a conflict of interest** - This means you cannot play the round if the OP messaged the answer to the mods. It also means you cannot correct yourself, or just decide to start a new round without follow guidelines

2. Assuming guidelines are followed, all you need to do to correct someone who needs it, is to just use +correct

3. Do not use +correct in the same thread if its already been used. This should be obvious, but just being sure

4. To start a new round, you must be the one to make the round. Do not ""give away"" the round to a willing participant (unless the other person is a game-mod as well)

5. In any situation where there is doubt if you are making the right action, just don't make it, even if it means stalling the game. Just PM me or ask in IRC and ill get back to you.

6. Speaking of IRC, I expect you to be the IRC chat. I don't expect you to be there all the time, but if you are free, and playing the game, I'd like it if you were in the chat to coordinate with other game-mods. More details below

---

#IRC

There is a picturegame moderator channel I would like you to be in.

The network is irc.snoonet.org, and the channel is #picturegame-mod

Please, register your nick as well, before joining. For now, the channel is public cause im too lazy to do an invite system

---

Have experience with IRC? Cool, you should know how to get there and how to register a nick if you dont have one on snoonet. 

No experience? 

1. https://snoonet.org/webchat Go here

2. Set ""Nickname"" to your reddit username

3. Set the ""Channel"" to nothing (literally, empty box)

4. Uncheck ""I have a password""

5. in the text box, type without quotes the following ""/ns register password email"" where password is the password you want, and email is your email address

6. You will get an email, follow the instructions there

7. Congrats, you are now registed

8. Whenever you log into IRC, you will need to log in by just doing ""/ns identify password"" where password is the password you created. 

9. next type ""/join #picturegame-mod"" and you will be in our channel. Say hi.

10. That's it. Get used to IRC, and consider downloading a true desktop client rather than using a webchat

If you are well aquainted with IRC and are interested, I do run a znc service [here](https://www.allthefoxes.me/znc/)

TDTMBot has been migrated to OAuth to save us from the OAuth-mageddon approaching in March!

This is good!

Doing this (a few days ago) resulted in some downtime but eh, not a big deal, it only took about 2 hours.

However, OAuth support was built up on a slightly older version of the code, oops.

These issues should have been addressed now, and tdtmbot is catching back up from the backlog.

Now that 2015 is in the books, it’s a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of dankness; to rebuild our relationship with our users and meme makers; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of our memes. Circlejerk's mission is to help people discover places where they can be meme and to empower the community to meme.

2015 was a big year for /r/circlejerk. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Meme Policy, GIFs Policy, and posting terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from powermods and /u/warlizard. Prior to my return, /r/circlejerk took an industry-changing stance on bad memes.

/r/circlejerk is a collection of Sanders and Trump supporters, and the memers play a critical role shepherding these sheeple. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a number of improvements to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten /r/circlejerk's users. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is ""Look Forward."" /r/circlejerk has a long history, and it’s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the /r/circlejerk product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. **Our new Android app is going into beta ~~today~~**, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and /u/warlizard. We take our stewardship of your memes seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a MEME Report. This will be available in March.

As always, /r/circlejerk would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

Things are smoothing out, woo

But still, reddit seems to embrace the idea of less is more, and in a site of this size growing at this rate, its not true.

I know reddit likely doesnt want to hire more then they need. Thats cool.

There are a crazy amount of people who are willing to do more thatn what they already do, for no extra cost. Someone who might not have the words on a paper that makes them right for a CM job at reddit. Moving people to SF is expenseive, training is expensive.

Reddit needs something more though. 

So a global moderator type system might be the ""easy"" solution. Giving willing and qualified volunteers with shown expirence an ""admin lite"" type deal, could help the site greatly, when it comes to dealing with user inquiries, dealing with spam, and just helping reddit overall.

Here is what GoN had to say about why he wants to be a game mod and why you should make him one.

---

I've been actively playing the PictureGame for about 8 months now. I think I can confidently say that since the beginning of my time here, I've been the most consistently present player out of everyone, including the players who have been here since the start.  
I've seen countless hints, a metric ton of stalled rounds, plenty of drama, lots of milestone rounds, a plethora of lighthouses and other architectural doodads, the rise and fall of plug.dj, the rise and fall of some of my favourite players (sometimes just the fall), the dankest of memes, etc. ad infinitum.  
Through the time I've spent here, I feel like I've gotten to know the community in a way that is rarely possible on Reddit. Heck, a whole lot of the time, I think of Reddit and PictureGame as seperate entities. Anyway, I really do value all of the interactions I've made here and I hope to keep making those interactions in the future. I don't plan on leaving anytime soon (I'm looking at you, /u/al_qeal_yall). Seriously, it must be really frustrating for those of you who aren't so fond of me, because I'll never leave. :)  
I remember when /u/tara1 put out a mod-post asking for people to help run the plug.dj chatroom, I was the first to join and I kept that running and it the community's awareness. It's a real shame that service went down. Recently, I've set up a Slack channel that a handful of players have signed up for (let's be honest, though, plug.dj was way cooler).  
My point is that I know PictureGame. I've put a lot of time and effort into this subreddit and I've spent a lot of sleepless nights here playing with you (thanks to /u/bjkman and /u/liveintokyo for spending some with me when I first started playing here). I deeply care about this place and keeping it going, so nothing makes me more frustrated than seeing a round that's been up for hours without end with 7 hints and no answers. My heart goes out to all the lonely posters out there. I've been complaining and groaning about this for months and months and I'm very very excited that this problem is *finally* being fixed with these game modships, which I am even more excited to receive along with some of the other players. Thanks to all of you who nominated me and my alts. ;)  
The current mods haven't always been able to keep the game running smoothly, and as a result, there are often long stalls in the game. It's fine from one perspective, because I totally understand that you mods have lives outside of PictureGame and can't focus all of your attention on it 24/7. But as for the rest of us who do, it isn't fine. It decreases overall activity, from old players to new players alike. I've always thought that game stalls only cause more game stalls, which just isn't fair for those of us that try to keep the game running. This is the reason that these game modships excite me so much. Finally, there's a better way to deal with game stalls.  
Seriously, thanks to the mods for doing this (/u/allthefoxes seems to be the driving force behind it, but thanks also to /u/Ewulkevoli, /u/TheLamestUsername, /u/tara1, and /u/vxx for your efforts).

In short, I'm happy to be able to help the game in such a direct way, and I'm thankful to the sub mods for making it happen (even if I did have to wait for half a year, it was worth ;P).

Now all we have to wait for are those Tournaments from /u/Ewulkevoli. :)

&gt;Q3.8: Can I use Excel to fetch numbers from RANDOM.ORG?   

&gt;Yes. Not being Excel macro wizards ourselves, we're not sure this is the easiest way, but it should work.  

&gt;Excel needs a URL to RANDOM.ORG that it can use to fetch the numbers. Check out the [HTTP API](https://www.random.org/clients/http/) to create the URL that'll give you the numbers you need. Most likely it will look something like [this](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=10&amp;min=1&amp;max=6&amp;col=1&amp;base=10&amp;format=plain&amp;rnd=new).

&gt;Follow Microsoft's instructions on [Different Ways of Using Web Queries in Excel](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa203721%28v=office.11%29.aspx) to create a macro that will fetch the numbers from your URL.

After some thought, and inspiration from Wikipedia, the new system is unveiled.

Introducing 2 types of moderators:

* Subreddit moderators

* Game moderators

All mods of /r/picturegame as of the time of posting are Subreddit Moderators. They have full control over the subreddit, including banning users, removing posts, changing rules and policy, etc. They are also game moderators (but are exempt from GM rules)

---

#Game Moderators

Game moderators are moderators of /r/picturegame that have less rights, more aimed at handling the game and how it runs. 

Game moderators can award points, and start a new round, or correct answers when OP leaves, and things like that. **Game moderators cannot ban users, or handle subreddit affairs**. All they are here to do is manage the game. To be specific, here is everything a game mod can do:

---

**Game moderators:**

* Are moderators according to reddit. They can distinguish thier posts, and are listed in the sidebar

* Have *mail* permissions on reddit, and none other. This means they can read and respond to reddit modmail.

* Game mods cannot: Ban or unban users, remove or approve posts/comments, edit flair, edit wiki, add or remove moderators, change rules, vote in rule changes.

* May use +correct, even if they are not OP

* May start a new round

---

#Rules gamemods must abide by:

* Can only award a ""+correct"" if one of the following is met:  
 * OP of the post has given the answer to the round in modmail
 * The correct answer has been posted **WITHOUT ANY DOUBT**, and OP has not given the point within one hour. (The answer must be unquestionably correct)

* Can only start a new round if one of the following has been met:
 * **ONE HOUR** has passed after a ""+correct"" has been given, and no new round has been posted
 * No correct answer has been given / there is doubt over the correctness of an answer, and OP of the round has not been active on reddit(posting/commenting) in the last **TWO HOURS**
 * *Clause to the above* - After 2 hours of no activity from OP, and no correct answer has been given, a game mod must give a **30 minutes** notice before starting a new round. This 30 minutes must be given after the intial 2 hours of no activity occurs. (Total time, 2.5 hours). This notice *cannot* be skipped, no matter how much time has passed since OPs activity - Note this is only for the second rule and not the first. 

* Any action a game mod makes must include the relevant usernames in the action so they are notified. (ie. Starting a new round in 30 minutes since /u/example is inactive | or +correct to /u/example since /u/example2 is inactive)

* Are expected to be polite at all times

* Are expected to follow all posted rules of the subreddit

* When possible, must be online a dedicated IRC channel

* Cannot reply to modmails where they are not relevant, meaning, game mods may not reply to ban inquieries, unban requests, policy suggestions, etc. They are only to answer modmails that are directly relevant, such as questions about how to play, when OP gives us the answer, etc..

* Are only to use distinguish when carrying out game mod duties.

* Any violation of the above will result in the immediate removal of game moderator status.

#How are game mods picked

Game mods are picked **by the community, fully**. 

That means that all gamemods are elected by community members, and are not handpicked by subreddit moderators. The only input subreddit moderators will have is opening / closing nominations and adding/removing the new game moderators

#How that works

For a user to be a gamemod, they must first be nominated. **No self nominations**, but any user with a 30 day+ account and some activity in /r/picturegame may nominate any other user that meets the same guideline

The nominee must accept the nomination.

After this, a process will be started where the community may ask questions and then vote to support or oppose the user becoming a game moderator.

**Voting is not a numbers game, it is looking for consensus** - so reasoning must be included. Raw Yes/No votes will generally be thrown away. 

If the community accepts the user to be a gamemod, they will be added for a 6 month term. After 6 months, a small thread will be made to see if the community still wishes the user to be a game moderator.

#Reasoning

We feel like the posts do not really reflect the nature of the subreddit. Many ps requests are also fairly low effort.

#Full rule

Rule 5 now reads:

No DAE, ""[FIXED]"", ""cake day"", or ""photoshop this"" posts, nor posts addressed to a specific redditor. ""[FIXED]"" posts should be added as a comment to the original image. Photopshop requests should be directed to /r/PhotoshopRequest

However, we get very, very little space for our sidebar. A bit above 5000 characters (And formatting things like tables eat up a lot of it).

Because of this, before today, we only allowed subreddits with above 10000 subscribers to be placed on our sidebar, so space wasn't wasted. 

---

However, this really punished new and upcoming subreddits, which need all the help they can get to succeed. 

We want to help people discover subreddits. /r/pics is a very broad topic, and we want people to find subreddits that may be a bit more tailored to them. Sometimes, these places can be found in the small communities.

---

#The solution

To remedy this, we have done a few things.

1. We cleaned out the crap in the sidebar.  
There were a lot of inactive subreddits in the list. We removed those and freed up some space. In addition, we plan to be more on top of the list as time goes on

2. We have created a new section for randomly chosen topics  
These topics are chosen by us, but can be nominated by the community! You can nominate topics **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fox/comments/3y79pf/rpics_topic_request_thread/)**. Once we have a topic, we find some good relevant subreddits, and list them in the sidebar until we decide to change the topics. The subreddits do not need to meet any subscriber number to be featured

3. We have created a rising subreddits section.  
These are subreddits that have under 10000 subscribers, but over 1000 subscribers. They are active, newer, and growing. Subreddits can be put here by applying for a spot by the subreddit moderators in **[this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fox/comments/3y78q5/rpics_new_subreddit_sidebar_request_thread/)**. Subreddits put here get their spot for one month before being switched out. After that time, they cannot be in the list again for a month, but after that cooldown period, they can reapply for a spot.

---

I think this system is a bit more fair to smaller subreddits, and can help everyone find some cool new subreddits.

Howdy! I'm /u/allthefoxes! /u/allthefoxes the redditor!

Anyways, I have a copy of [Undertale](http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/) to give away!

This has been absolutely my GOTY, and probably one of my favorite games ever, period.

The indie scene on PC is amazing, and produces a lot of fun. And sometimes, the best games ever made.

However, I will warn you, dont read the comments. This is genuinely a game that gets better the less you know about it going in.

In the comments below, I need your best pun! About whatever you want. Just a good, solid pun.

Example:

**What does a skeleton tile his roof with?**

***Shin-gles***

My favorite gets the game.

Will give it away on Steam sometime tomorrow. So you have at least 10-11 hours to think of a good, solid pun.

---

All our rules still apply. We understand that you are wanting to show solidarity, share something you saw or made, ^^^or ^^^maybe ^^^earn ^^^some ^^^karma, but we still do not allow screenshots, superimposed text, gifs, etc..

---

Extraordinarily low quality posts will be removed. For example, a picture of the french flag by itself.

---

Images that have been posted *heavily* in the past few hours will be removed. This is based on images, not concepts. 

For example, yes, wtc one is lit up with french flag colors. That would be removed. A new building or picture would be allowed though

---

Racism will not be tolerated in comments. Feel free to talk and get out your thoughts, but crossing the line will result in removal.

Shitty / innapropriate jokes will not be removed, but will be responded with many looks of disapproval. 

---

Lastly, our thoughts go out to anyone and everyone. Those in france, friend, familes, strangers.

One trip to Advanced Display Settings later, and it turns out, yep, I was at 60hz the whole time",buildapc,Today I learned: You actually need to tell Windows you want your monitors to use 144hz...,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3rygs5/today_i_learned_you_actually_need_to_tell_windows/

Anyways, I also need some new monitors. I know for a fact I would like one 1440@144 for games and such as my main monitor, but I definitely want a second monitor.

My problem:

**I really fucking hate how different resolutions work in Windows**, (with the whole mouse not being able to ""go over"" in certain places) so I would like to have another monitor, it should be 1440p as well.

In addition, I only have enough desk space for a 23"" monitor after the 27"" 1440@144. And if possible I would like it to be as TALL as the 1440@144.

Does that make sense?

Am I boned? Am I going to have to suck it up and deal with it?",buildapc,"[Build Help] Building my new machine Soon(tm), but can't decide on monitors.

Moderating this subreddit is a lot of effort, in fact its probably the subreddit that gets most of my time, and its not even close in size to some other subreddits.

But the thing is, we have a pretty inactive mod-team other than me and maybe 2 others, and I have lost a lot of passion for this sub. Its just a chore, and when something like this is getting so much of my time, I have to start to ask myself if its worth it.

this place needs a lot more mods, and if you are interested in modding it, you should message the mods with the link in the sidebar.

I just have burned myself way too much on this subreddit, and am not getting the kind of help I need in moderating it. I would look for new mods myself, but like I said, I've just lost a lot of interest in this subreddit. 

Unless other mods become a bit more active, /new probably won't look very pretty, but you can do your best by downvoting the shit and upvoting the good stuff.

We added you to our mod-team because we thought you would be the best choice for our subreddit.

Your duties include:

* Cleaning out the modqueue (/r/pics/about/modqueue)

* Watching /r/pics/new to remove rulebreaking posts

* Answering user modmail

And other general mod duties.

---

A few notes: 

* You should become comfortable with our rules and the way we enforce them. I highly suggest new mods simply watch for a while, see how we repond in modmail before trying to respond themselves. See how and what we remove before you go and start enforcing the rules

* You do not have access to our own backroom subreddit for 60 days

* You *do* have access to our IRC channel on snoonet. PM me for details and to get an invite. This is a good way to contact me.

* You do not have the ability to ban for 60 days (modmail /r/pics if someone really needs it though)

---

Account farming

The interesting part about modding /r/pics is the weird spam we get. Yes, we do indeed get the run of the mill hot sexy grills in your area spam, and we expect you to take care of that. However, we also get a unique type of spam we call account farming (af).

Account farmers typically have broken english, overuse punctuation, etc and tend to post low quality stock images typically with shitty titles (Beautify City New York ... Wow ...). These accounts can be very hard to pick out sometimes though, and we don't have very good guidelines in effect to give you to help stop these accounts

Because of that, I don't really expect you to. Things in our modqueue that have the filter reason of ""Young Account"" should probably just be left to sit there until another mod checks it out. If you approve account farming submissions, ill probably give you shit in PM, and I can be cranky, so try not to do that, lel

---

Questions:

Well, there isn't really much to say here, you have 30 days of basically learning and getting into it, and after that, we will hold you up to an activity standard. Its not much, usually just within the amount of reason, but you should be striving for ***at least 100*** actions a month, and thats absolutely nothing.

Questions can be directed to our modmail at /r/pics, pm'd to me at /u/allthefoxes or allthefoxes on snoonet, or even in this thread.

There are two kinds of requests:

1. **Subreddit request** - This is a request for the comment counter to track your subreddit. **You must be a moderator of the subreddit you want tracked.** - *Simply comment the name of the subreddit and nothing else*, and I will reply when you are up and running.

2. **Data Request** - This is a request for output from your subreddit database. **You must be a moderator of the subreddit you want data from**. Syntax is below:

To request data, I need a few parameters. 

1. *Subreddit name*:

2. *Unit of time* (Accepted: hour, day, week, month, year):

3. *Value* (How many of the units you want):

4. *Count* (how many names to return)

5. *PM or Modmail*:

---

Example:

1. Subreddit name: /r/fox 

2. Unit: days

3. Value: 5

4. Count: 100

5. PM

---

This means I will reply to you with the top 100 commenters of /r/fox from the last 5 days.

Please note I am still working on securely automating this, so there may be time delays of a few hours for a response.

* Gaming. Dota, CS, TF2, Skyrim, Minecraft, Fallout 4, Battlefield, Idk, just whatever I get my hands on! General usage, web browsing, stuff like that

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$1500 or so

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Probably not for a few months, but I would love to get an idea if I got it now

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

The computer and OS, nothing else needed.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

US. Microcenter an hour away, so, sure.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Razer blackwidow chroma, Logitech mouse. 

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

PROBABLY NOT BUT HEY IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT...

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I want an Enthoo Pro case. Or something like it. I like the ennthoo pro

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

ATX is neat

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Yes, win10

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

I have a more than capable system now, but I want something comfy at 1440p, probably a 980ti.

Getting new monitors soon so those are not part of the budget.

Today, I wanted to talk about one of the things worth considering changing.

---

AutoClearChanBuffer is an option you can set on a per channel, per network, or per user basis that does exactly what it says it does, Automatically Clear the Channel Buffer.

---

But atf what is a channel buffer?

GREAT QUESTION. 

The channel buffer is buffer that holds your messages and replays them back to you when you connect. You have a buffer for every channel you are in. When you connect to my server, everything inside that buffer is ""played back"".

---

AutoClearChanBuffer is an option you can set that flushes this buffer out whenever you connect to that channel and the buffer is played back to you. 

---

Got it? Cool! So why does it matter?

Another great question.

When you have this on, and are currently connected to a channel, this buffer stays empty until you leave, the buffer is bypassed in its entirety. This means that, for example, if you leave your desktop connected, and then connect on your laptop on later, you will not get *any* playback on connect, meaning you will have ""missed"" some messages.

However, lets say you did turn the auto clear off. This means that, whenever you connect, you will always get a full face of playback, even if youve seen it before!

There are pros and cons here, and its totally up to you. I have some channels clear and some not (where i want to see everything.)

---

Note: PMs also have a buffer, and I highly recommend you leave the auto clear on for these. ",Fox,Understanding Auto Clear Buffers. Why you may or may not want to turn it off.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fox/comments/3oio4h/understanding_auto_clear_buffers_why_you_may_or/

Its late and I feel pretty lost so this might not be helpful, but heres the tldr

* This morning I ran ccleaner 

* After running ccleaner, I opened chrome and it threw a nasty error. I just decided to restart my machine because who cares I have an ssd and it would fix the issue

* Big mistake

* Computer would get all the way past the windows loading screen, but where it would display the login screen, it was just an ever present black screen. Nothing happened here. Responded to no input.

* Tried a lot of different ways to removery. sfc said it found corrupted files but couldnt fix them. chkdsk said im good. dism is confusing so  fuck that. 

* Finally decided to use the windows 10 reset tool

* After it resets, I log in, problem seems to be solved. Install a bunch of my old applications

* Now, some applications on startup give me `The application was unable to start correct (0xc0000022)...`

* Namely screencloud and Google Drive

* I also use YNAB to keep track of my money. 

* YNAB says it needs adobe air

* I try to install adobe air

I recently got an XFX r9 390. No issues, performs amazing. I really like it. Benching it, it gets right where it should be.

You can see my issue here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3lndvy/troubleshooting_after_upgrading_to_a_r9_390_when/

Bascally, I had one issue.

---

Windows is set to turn off my displays after 10 minutes, and never go to sleep. 

It worked pretty well until I got this card.

After installing the r9 390, anytime my monitors turned off in this fashion (not manually, or anything like that), my CPU, RAM, and pagefile usage would *skyrocket* to the point of, if left alone long enough, would lock up the computer, as I had no ram and my pagefile full. Getting to this point took about 5-6 minutes.

---

Doing some investigating, I learned that it was csrss.exe causing this incredibly high usage. I thought it could be a virus, and it turns out its nothing but legit.

I tried everything, reinstalled windows. Everything. Everything but an RMA. Nothing worked. I was about to.

Until today.

---

this afternoon, I read some of the Simple Questions thread, and saw a thing about the Gigabyte r9 390 memory clock not idling while using an HDMI port.

I took this info and threw it away. Didnt even think about it.

A little bit later I finally got my hands on 3dmark Fire Strike. I opened up afterburner and then ran the test. The card did great and was exactly where it should perform!

As I was scrolling through the afterburner monitor. I came across the memory clock graph.

I remembered the post. I closed 3dmark and watched the graph.

It didnt go down.

I opened my afterburner logs. It was always at 1500. Always.

I was honestly shocked that I completely overlooked this. I unplugged my HDMI monitor. The clock went down to 300 MHZ and the temperatures instantly dropped. (I had always assumed the slightly high temps were just a result of poor cable management).

---

Then it hit me to try it again. I changed my settings back to what I usually use and waited for the monitors to turn off. Once they did, my hdd indicator light started lighting up and I was heartbroken. It didnt help at all.

But I let it do its thing and waited a minute. The light stopped and I woke up the computer. Whatever csrss.exe was doing, it stopped after about 20 seconds into the sleep.

I waited again to see if it was a fluke and it wasnt. It didnt even do anything this second time.

---

So, I don't know how the two issues are exactly related, but they are. And now I know what to fix.

MY computer is set to never sleep, but to turn off the display after 10 minutes.

So, it does this, no issues, love the new card.

However, once the displays are asleep, things get bad

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

2 days ago, I got myself a R9 390 (upgraded from a 7970)

I reinstalled the correct AMD drivers and played some games, love the card so far, no issues but this one.

However, leaving my desk for more than 20-30 minutes will result in me having to restart my machine the hard way, smothering the power button with my finger until it finally dies only to be revived. 

The machine is on, fans running, and not asleep. However my monitors are off (as expected) but do not return with any input. Key presses, mouse movement, nothing will bring the display back. Turning on the monitors manually just results in a face of ""no signal""

I then need to restart my computer.

I have also noticed that booting takes a bit longer.

Normally, I would see a small ""9C"" in the corner of each screen for just a moment, then another code (A2) I think, before getting greeted by the BIOS. This is completely normal and has been doing this forever. 

With the new card though, it sat on that ""9C"" code for much longer than normal. 5 or so seconds compared to the normal under 1 second.

The machine is set to put the displays off at 10 minutes of no activity, and is set to never sleep, never hibernate, or never hybrid sleep.

Its not an exact science here, sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesnt. the machine has no other outstanding issues.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Don't really know where to start here.

http://np.reddit.com/r/Dota2 is the subreddit for the popular Valve made ASSFAGGOTS (Aeon of Strife Style Fortress Assault Game Going On Two Sides) game Dota 2.

Dota 2 has a lot of popular personalities, pro players, ex pro players, memelords, etc.. and many of these people stream on Twitch.tv, a site where anyone can go and stream their games to the public.

Many high profile streamers such as Arteezy, SingSing, AdmiralBulldog, etc get over 10000 viewers during their streams (I get 2)

So this is all well and good.

Often times, there will be high moments in these streams, worthy of a highlight. Something cool, funny, interesting, etc..

Twitch.tv does save videos of broadcasts, but between you and me, the player and system is atrocious, including muting the whole stream when certain music is detected.

---

So where are we now?

NoobfromUA is a person from Ukraine who runs a very popular youtube channel here: 

https://www.youtube.com/user/noobfromua

Noobfromua is popular for basically one reason: His videos are simple and only contain his name at the very start. They are these highlights, highlight reals, and more from streams, tournaments, and matches, and he is damn fast too. From what I understand, its actually what he does for a living.

---

Can you see where this is going?

---

Since everyone knows that pro gamers and streamers know how to professionally act on social media...ah fuck it.

The gloves came off on twitter again as Zai, pro player and sometimes a streamer calls out NFUA on twitter:

The discussion ( [first thread full link here](https://np.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3jw8er/mad_grill/) ) heats up quick, and reddit takes its side.

Hey everyone.

Its 2 am so I will keep it a bit on the quick side.

---

Within the next 12-72 hours, this sub will change a little bit.


---

#Addition of Rule 14

Rule 14:

No links to anything on our [Restricted Content list](Link will go here)

---

We are going to be developing a Restricted Content list for SUATMM

This list will contain ""non specific items"" that you cannot post.

When we say non specific, we mean a general item, not a specific one. (example below)

Every month, on the 1st, we will update our restricted items list to add or remove items from it. What gets added or removed will be determined by community feedback, and how we feel the sub is going.

Updates will only be done at the start of the month. We as moderators promise not to suddenly add something to the list without notifying you, and we will not do so when not in the proper time (First of the month,maybe the second, cmon I am human here).

Of course, we still have our discretion, but entire categories of items will only be put on the list in the right ways.

---

So whats on the list?

Well, we are still finishing it up, but the current solidified entry is:

* ""Mail your _____ an _____"" items

We feel these items are low quality cash grabs, and not worthy for a spot on the subreddit at this time.

---

We are thinking about putting tshirts on this list, for at least a month. Like I said, we can also remove things on this list at the start of the month, to give these items another chance down the line.

What do you think of this?

Tshirts should be on this list?

---

#Change to the creator system

Soon, the Creator flair will be turned off for users to assign, and we will require the use of a title tag [Creator]

All creator posts will need to be manually approved by a moderator. This process can take up to 12-24 hours.

This allows us to better handle spam, without letting it sit on the subreddit for hours on end.

This is not to punish content creators, but to make sure that only the good stuff gets through and not the crap. Our creator system is so redditors can post what they made, not what some dude is trying to sell you.

The system of requireing approval is already in place for certain domains (such as Etsy) and has been for a while

What do you think about this?

---

Rule 5 would likely be deprciated as well, since it will be put on the Rule 14 list.

So I dont need to fuck with any configs, rule 5 will become ""dont be a dick""

We have noticed that you guys have been a bit more active when talking about self promotion on the subreddit, so I thought I wold make a quick post about how we handle that.

SUATMM allows creators of products to post here, but only once a month. In addition, they muse follow all our strict rules, and follow reddit guidelines for appropriate self promotion.

At SUATMM, we have one of the most extensive domain banlists to handle the bad spam.

---

We allow this because we want SUATMM to be a cool place for you guys to find things, but also give creators incentive to post and to make good stuff. We dont plan currently on changing our rules on allowing some self promotion

#BUT

We notice that you guys are sick of some low quality content. T shirts, ""Mail your X's Y"", etc..as for handling these, we are working on a solution to this. Stay tuned.


---

One of our goals is to allow good redditors who created something cool a place to share it, but thats being dragged down by low quality crap, and I dont think any of us like it.

Stay tuned for more

Always love feedback.

---

#So what exactly do you do?

Besides shitposting, I run a hosting service for reddit bots

#What does that mean?

It means that I will operate the code for an automated reddit account.

#You will run any bot?

No, I have standards. I will not run:

*Spam bots

*PM bots (Either spam PMs, or things that send invites/PMs based on certain criteria)

*Bots that do not meet /r/BotWatchman standards for an ""appropriate"" bot. Feel free to ask me about this.

#Will you write/edit/fix my bot?

No, I am not a programmer. I will make attempts to fix any problems I am aware of, but those attempts won't go far.

However, I will always keep your code up to date. Just PM me when the code needs an update, and I will pull it through github

#Other than meeting your crazy high standards, what else do I need to do for you to run my bot?

1. Please host it on github

2. Ask nicely

#What languages?

Technically, any, but python (PRAW) makes this easy on everyone involved.

#Whats your uptime? How reliable is this service?

Its pretty fucking reliable. I make sure to have as little downtime as possible. Accidents do happen, and I will do my best to resolve them. You can see incident history [here](https://www.allthefoxes.me/bot/) as well as uptime and stats.

#So how much will it cost me?

$0

#Really?

Yes. Unless you want your bot to be on its own server (with no other bots on it), in which case it costs $5 a month. No, I will not take reddit gold, bitcoin, pocket lint, or anything else that isn't paypal

#Can't I just host the bot myself?

Yeah knock yourself out. Either you need to have your machine on 24/7 or pay some money though.

https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/3ejz4b/requesthow_stable_is_this/

This is an absolutely great example of exactly what theydidthemath is **not for.**

We have very minimal rules, which kinda sucks for you guys sometimes, since its up to you,and its also up to us to use our discretion.

So as a reminder, all posts:

* Must be simply calculable.

 Taking guesses on certain things are fine, this is a fun subreddit. Guessing entirely is not. If your post requires **more guesswork than math**, then it does not belong.

*  Must be clear in what is being requested (or shown) in the title.

 Broad titles aren't cool, and extremely broad questions are not cool either, and this is something we will be cracking down on. Like the post above, it requires more guessing than math, and it is extremely broad.

---

So what I am getting at?

I'm trying to say that the quality of this subreddit is up to you guys. We are doing our best, but we need your help too.

Firstly, posting good content helps, but mostly what this whole post is about.

#If you see posts that you think do not meet the two points I made above, let us know!

This means either pressing **report** and leaving a detailed message in the ""other"" field, or **Send us a message**

If you have a gut feeling that a post is not clear, too broad, or not simply calculable (or requires more guessing than math), then just tell us thats what you think. I dont care if you are wrong, just let us know so we can take a closer look

---

#Uptime

My uptime goal is always 3 (or 4) nines, since bots often need a few minutes, but thanks to my service provider and my own self being unprepared, the 30 day uptime is down to 98%.

Thats really low, and hopefully it should be back to 99.9 soon.

You can see the uptime on https://www.allthefoxes.me/bot

The /up page on my website is actually the webserver, not the bot server. They were separated. I plan on changing the way /up works soon, maybe using the bot server instead.

---

#Moving

The bots have moved over to a new service provider, Digital Ocean, about a month ago. Since then, they have moved around New York a bit, but have settled down, now that some hardware issues were sorted out.

---

#Moving again?

This peace may not last. The bots are a bit crowded right now. I will let this speak for itself:

    root@FoxNYC3:~# uptime
    20:15:11 up 8 days, 22:30,  1 user,  load average: 0.95, 0.95,0.89

With only 1 CPU, and many bots not being the most optimized things on the planet, space is tight.

Movement to a server with 2 CPUs or even 4 may have to come soon, and this will double my cost for this server. Money is no problem at this time however.

I am looking on seeing what I can do to better optimize code for some of these bots. TDTM is very small, but some others are not

---

#Oauth

oh god. Preperation is beginning. I am on vacation right now, so no serious work is being done, but soon it will be coming.

/r/dota2 has one, and its account is /u/Dota2_SS

We haven't meme'd well, and we have surprised you with ""fite me irl's"". We have apologized and made promises to you, the users and the memers, over many years, but time and again, we havn't delivered on them.

When you've had new dank memes or theme requests, we have often failed to provide concrete results. The memers have lost trust in memes, and in us, the top minds of reddit.

Today, we acknowledge this long history of mistakes. We are grateful for all you do for circlejerk, and the buck stops with us. We are taking three concrete steps:

**Memes:** We will improve memes, not just promise improvements, building on work already underway. Recently, /u/Unidan has been primarily developing new memes for reddit that are largely un-dank. Effective immediately, he will be shifting to work full time on the issues the memers have raised. In addition, many memers are familiar with /u/BarbatisCollum's work, as he previously asked for feedback on memes and other dank projects. He will use your past and future input to create and improve memes all around reddit. Together they will be working as a team for you, the memers, on what memes to make and then delivering them.

**Communication:** /u/GodOfAtheism is trying out the new role of memer advocate. He will be the contact for memers with reddit. We need to figure out how to better communicate with them, and /u/GodOfAtheism will work with you to figure out the best way to talk more often.

**Search:** Will continue to be a flaming pile of shit.

I know these are just words, and it may be hard for you to believe us. I don't have all the answers, and it will take time for us to deliver dank results. I mean it when I say we screwed up, and we want to have a meaningful ongoing discussion.

Thank you for listening. Please share memes here. Our team is ready to respond.",circlejerk,We apologize,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/3ccys7/we_apologize/

/r/pics is not going private, but we are restricting submissions. 

---

#Dude what the hell is going on

A lot of subreddits are currently set to private or restricted as an outcry against the admins

#But why

Today, a reddit admin named Victoria was let go from reddit, we don't know any other details than that. Victoria was a key part of subreddits like /r/IamA. She helped do these IamAs with people who maybe didnt know how to use reddit, or understand what reddit was. 

She was key in getting a lot of famous and well known people to come to our community and talk to us, giving us some really cool opportunities. In addition, Victoria is truly a nice, awesome person, and was one of the few contacts any redditor had to really get closer to the admins.

---

#So what does that have to do with it?

Well, the admins have a pretty long standing history of not communicating very well with moderators and users. Their actions are mysteries wrapped in enigmas clouded in confusion. This was no exception. The moderators of /r/Iama were blindsided, and with so much of their subreddit relying on Victoria, they had to go private to figure stuff out.

---

# So why are other subreddits shutting down? 

Well, this is where it gets a bit more complicated, but reddit letting go of Victoria, whatever reason may be, was another very clear lack of communication on the admins parts. We understand that they cant share why shes gone, and that they could not tell us beforehand, but they could have at the least taken some time to figure out what to do with the key roles that Victoria does for these subreddits

#So this is all about Victoria?

No, its not. Most people are saying that Victoria leaving was the straw that broke the camels back. Reddits failing at communication with moderators (and users) goes so far back, even to when I wasn't on this site.

A lot of mods are frustrated, us included. We have been talking, whining, doing what we could to get our voices out there to the admins, but things like this happen again and again and again, and nothing really changes. People got fed up, and subreddits started to go dark.

Reddit is a community website, and much of the communities out there that you love are still alive and running well due to countless man hours by these moderators, who do it in their free time because they really do care about this site. Not to mention you, the users, who are lucky to hear about *anything* if you aren;t following the right channels. 

What you guys hear from the admins is what we here. We don't get much, and many of us don't expect much, just some communication.

---

#So why go private/restrict, can't you do X or Y

Honestly, options have ran out. This need for communication has been dire for many years.

#So you are punishing us?!

In a sense, yes, and I am sorry. Many moderators have literally no other options. Its either ""Deal with it"", ""Keep whining"", or ""Do somehting"", and mods are finally doing something this time.

#So this is all about mods? Wow, assholes

In a sense, yes, but this is for everyone. I can't speak for every mod, but many of us know that the admins blatant incompetence and communication hurts us all, as community members. Not just subreddit moderators

---

We know that many of you will probably be pretty mad at us. But I hope you will try and see it from our point of view. A lot of us are doing this so we can get heard, and make this site a better place for all of us to use.

---

#allthefoxes dude I don't care, shut up, go to hell, etc..

Thats fine. I am sorry. We kept the sub open, so you can still browse. Maybe you can find something to do at /r/internetisbeautiful

---

#So when will this be over

Pretty soon I imagine.

#and update your steamdb script

TLDR: A bunch of people from reddit decided to leave the number 1 room in favor of trying new rooms with the WH strat. This left Room 1 bleeding people.

Those in SteamDB decided it would be best to merge into Reddit room 3 (43166) - Since bleeding people from room 1 hurts the chances, and joining room 3 will give us a chance to add wormholes to the already powerful force there.

It is expected that the new SteamDB room will overtake the old one. 

If you were in room 1, join room 43166 and lets blow through 300k like nobodies business",SteamMonsterGame,"SteamDB and Reddit #3 join forces - Since Room 1 was bleeding, Many in SteamDB took up the 200 spots in Reddit #3 to give extra wormholes and click power",http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamMonsterGame/comments/3a3etg/steamdb_and_reddit_3_join_forces_since_room_1_was/
