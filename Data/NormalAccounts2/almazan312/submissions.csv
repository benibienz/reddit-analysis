""If the Court grants final approval of the Settlements at the Final Approval hearing on October 18, 2016, then the claims process will begin. **At that time, Volkswagen will review proof of eligibility documents submitted by consumers. If a consumer is deemed eligible, Volkswagen will send a final offer packet to the consumer.** The consumer must accept the offer and return a signed offer packet to Volkswagen before he or she can schedule an appointment.

I did a quick wash immediately after I noticed them and tried to wipe some of them off with some quick detailer. I stopped after I noticed they were not going away. Have they etched into my clear coat? The car is only a few months old and would hate to already need some paint correction.

Here's a picture of the spots:

I would like to achieve a clean headlight look similar to the all LED conversions that I have seen online. I do not want to remove the front bumper or headlight housing.

What do y'all think? Should I move forward with the guide or try something else?
