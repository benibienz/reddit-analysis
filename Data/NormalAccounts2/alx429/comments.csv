0,"I didn't watch the game so this is coming from the box score, but it looks like the mavs are leading or keeping it close in a number of these losses. Of course we can't finish games when our bench has been stripped to compensate for our injured starting lineup. This team is not as bad the record indicates.",2016-11-20 04:36:00+00:00,da7txlp,1,t3_5dw23f,6621,Mavericks
1,"This is killer analysis, but I'm really hesitant about investing too heavily in any PG that can't offer reliable scoring. There's not really a contender in the West that is led by a below average scoring PG. 

I also don't want to make any decisions for the future factoring Dirk in. We've got under two more seasons of his scoring, and maybe less if he can't stay healthy. It's pretty obvious that without Dirk in the lineup, this team struggles to match the offensive output of other teams. 

We have to remember that this is the guy that's going to be up against Curry, Westbrook, Paul, Lillard, Parker, etc... and if he can't hope to keep up with their scoring pace, I damn well want him to be able to slow them down defensively. From what you're saying, it doesn't seem like we could count on him to do either. What do you think? Am I missing something?",2016-11-19 01:09:24+00:00,da6fw32,1,t3_5dois0,18233,Mavericks
2,Boo? I'm happy he's gone. How can you build a team around a player who's constantly hurt? A commitment to him would've been a mistake. Looks more like he's the one that's mad. ,2016-11-19 00:47:34+00:00,da6f499,1,t3_5dlttt,49839,Mavericks
3,"Our whole team is struggling because injuries have screwed up our lineups royally. Guys like Anderson and Powell are being asked to do too much because we're suddenly without about 30pts per game with Dirk and Deron sidelined. If/when we are healthier, those guys' games can continue to develop normally and I really expect them to excel in their roles like they were last year. 

We're in a bit of an identity crisis at the moment and should be careful not to panic.",2016-11-17 20:40:32+00:00,da4p3ax,1,t3_5ddi5b,64056,Mavericks

5,"Honestly, it's just that this is his first time playing in the NBA and despite limited offensive production, he was solid on defense. He resembled a Jae Crowder sort of player. One of those guys that doesn't light up the stat sheet but makes your team play better somehow.",2016-11-07 17:36:18+00:00,d9psptt,3,t1_d9pcepr,31368,Mavericks

Harrison Barnes is the real deal. Barea haters gtfo. This is a glimpse of what a Dirkless team would look like and for the first time this season I'm feeling optimistic about the future. Barnes showed he can be a leader. Let's not panic about this year yet. ",2016-11-07 02:41:31+00:00,d9p1cza,1,t3_5bjruw,240,Mavericks

Not really surprised though that Rick opted to go with the vets off the bat to start the playoffs. I have a feeling that strategy has gone out the window fast with that last game though.

14,"I'm tired of all this Charlie V hate. This guy is NOT the problem. Honestly, we don't even have a solvable ""problem"". We're riding Dirk's last year without having our ""next in line star"" (Parsons) playing enough due to injury. Not an ideal comparison, but how good could you expect the Spurs to be if Leonard was hurt all the time? They'd be better than us because they've done a better job of creating a stable core, but you get the idea. This team is FINALLY moving in the right direction. The truth is they overperformed like crazy this year and I'm really excited to see what we'll look like as Mejri, Simba, and Powell really start coming into their own. My hope is that we come back from that terrible fucking loss and show everyone we've got balls of steel, regardless of if we win.
