2,"A couple of things should be taken into account.

There's a lot of benefit to having applicable programming experience over a degree.  I've seen a lot of people graduate, but didn't have any idea how to practically apply what they'd learned.  Having someone teach you programming and being paid for it is an opportunity not a lot of people get.

That being said, it also depends on the quality of the apprenticeship.  A self taught programmer usually tends to not adhere to proper methodology all the time and has a good chance of passing those habits to a tutee.

Lastly, it also depends on how old you are and what opportunities are available.  If you're fresh out of school, you have some educational grants that are only available for so long (LIFE scholarship, for one).  If you have the option, I would try out the apprenticeship for at least a year, because having prior experience in programming will help make your assignments a lot easier.  The biggest hurdles when learning programming are overcoming logical problems and solving them efficiently.  Just try to analyze how good the apprenticeship is, because I would feel terrible if you missed an opportunity for a good education on an apprenticeship that didn't pan out.",2016-08-10 13:49:32+00:00,d6bs533,1.0,t3_4x251k,830.0,learnprogramming

4,"Well, instead of giving a decisive answer on this, I'll give you my reasoning behind my suspicion.

I first noticed these posts when Reddit made their change because they were showing up in undeleteShadow, but weren't actually deleted.  This is because undelete checks the top 1000 posts if something disappears off the front page, whereas my bot only checked the top 110 or so.  I wrote the algorithm based on how normal posts behave when getting ranked.

While researching these false deletes, I noticed that they were moving outside the top 100 positions at speeds that cannot be accounted for by user votes.  I modified my algorithm to check up into the 250 post range, and everything is running smoothly.  

Except for the_donald posts. They're showing up in undeleteShadow, still, because they can move from the top 100 to 350 in less to a minute. I'm hesitant to say they are specifically targeting the_donald, because there might be some specifics behind the algorithm about how fast and how many posts are coming up from a specific subreddit.",2016-06-29 16:47:17+00:00,d4sr92r,6.0,t1_d4sm842,5900.0,undelete
5,"Hey, mod and bot coder for undeleteShadow, here.

It's actually a little more interesting than that.  I noticed them tweaking the algorithm throughout the day during the change.

Here's how the new algorithm works.  They haven't changed how things move from the start.  The only change they've made is when something enters the top 100 positions, it checks to see how many submissions in the top 100 are from that subreddit.  If it's too many, it selects one (still not sure what the criteria on this selection is), then bumps it down, hard.  Usually from Rank 80 to 120.  Sometimes they'll be bumped down to 250.

I feel like it's a little unfair to those who's post gets bumped, but this is also creating a pretty stale /r/all.  Yes, it's more diverse, but because Reddit trends a lot, it had previously been normal for a popular subreddit to show up in the top 100 a lot.  

This is why we are seeing a lot less news.  Worldnews and news would have numerous articles on the front page, but now they are limited to a number of slots that are chosen by the algorithm.

I would like to note, however, that the_donald does get special treatment.  It's the only subreddit that gets a bump from rank positions 25-40 down to 350.  It doesn't tip off the people in the subreddit, because it looks entirely normal on their subreddit's front page.

The only reason I noticed all of this is because my bot works a little differently than Frontpagebot.  I had to spend a couple of hours reworking my bot.

6,"That's because the algorithm doesn't stop anything getting to the top.

10,"I don't think r/undelete will be affected.  The undelete bot checks against the subreddit that a post was deleted from to make sure it was deleted.  When the new algorithm pushes something out of /r/all (because that's what is doing), the undelete bot notices but checks the subreddit it came from (which is unaffected by this).

I only notice this because what I was mistaking for false deletes in undeleteShadow were posts that would move unnaturally in rank.  It's not normal to drop from the 1-100 rank to the 250-375th in a few minutes. I see the most frequent shift being in a post ranking in the 80's immediately hit 125 after 2 minutes.

I changed the code to check well into the 200's, so a lot of the posts have been filtered out.  There are some that still come in because they're bumped to the 300's drastically, which seems unfair to the poster. ",2016-06-17 04:58:04+00:00,d4co7px,1.0,t3_4ohh7b,2988.0,undelete

It might be difficult to balance without affecting how other subreddits get to /r/all, as well.  They might just do a cop out by adding a weight to a specific subreddit to reduce the chance of it gaining traction and it would be difficult to prove they are doing it.

I didn't ask him what the change was, because whatever the change was, it didn't affect the shadow bot.

No worries, though.  If IAAAC is alerted to the issue and it will take a while to fix, there will be bots that can fill in during the meantime.
