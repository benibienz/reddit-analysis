Dark Zone Gear Score clarification

There has been some confusion regarding Gear Score and the new Dark Zone bracket. Many people are being placed in the 201+ bracket but their visible Gear Score is below that. This is because there is an invisible Gear Score that is used to calculate the Dark Zone bracket you are placed in. This hidden Gear Score takes into account:

 

    Equipped Gear (Chest, Mask, Kneepads, Backpack, Gloves, and Holster)
    Gear in your inventory (Chest, Mask, Kneepads, Backpack, Gloves, and Holster)
    Gear in your Stash (Chest, Mask, Kneepads, Backpack, Gloves, and Holster)
    The weapon you have with the highest Gear Score. This can be any weapon you have equipped, in your inventory, or in your Stash.

344,"Uplay PC Client – March Update
Hello Folks, We're back again with another update for you all. This month we're making it a little more facile to find incipient friends as well as visually perceive what your current friends have been playing and we're making some other ameliorations to game pages. Check below for more info on what this update includes.
 Transmutations in this relinquishment:

        Friend Suggestions have been integrated to the friend list in the in-game overlay
        A notification is now exhibited when sending a friend request to a suggested friend
        Videos exhibited in the “Videos” section of a game page will now be played inside the client rather than opening a browser
        Fortified games pages now show friends that additionally play that game
        Uplay will now apply updates to games in a “preload” or “preloaded” state when available. This will be categorically propitious in cognation to day 1 patches and ascertaining that you’re able to get in game in the shortest time possible on launch day



    Bug fine-tunes:

        Fine-tuned an issue whereby incipiently engendered accounts could not be found by other users nor would their friend requests show for others
        Fine-tuned an erraticism regarding the Download/Play button not exhibiting the correct state when a game fortifying progressive download has an update pending
        Fine-tuned chat notifications displaying multiple times after a friend had ceased sending messages
        Fine-tuned a client crash that sometimes occurred when launching Might &amp; Magic: Heroes VI from Steam on Windows 10 (64-Bit)
        Fine-tuned 3rd party games evanescent from the Notification Tray icon menu when switching from Online to Offline mode (and vice versa)
        Fine-tuned an issue in which re-mastered games would exhibit a “Verify File” option when the game is not installed
        Fine-tuned an issue that sanctioned interaction with Download buttons while the client is in offline mode
        Fine-tuned an issue when utilizing the client in Russian that caused the context menu for pending friend requests to appear cut off
        Fine-tuned an issue which caused the most recently consummated Club Action to not exhibit as localized



    That’s all for now. Keep the suggestions and feedback, we're always looking to amend Uplay and we'll have some more good stuff for you in the future.

803,matchmaking is double edge sword.if done correctly it help if it don't its gonna leave you and devs in the very bad spot.if they didn't fix this game issues before the full game release then this game will not survive more than 4-5 months.we haven't seen any client patch since the closed beta started how we know what are they fixing on the client side(technical beta patch was too add terrorist hunt nothing more).,2015-10-02 05:37:03+00:00,cvlfec4,2.0,t1_cvlf7kw,553.0,Rainbow6

820,http://www.gamestheshop.com/Tom-Clancy-s-Rainbow-Six-Siege-for-PC/1249 this is the local online retail i bought the game from.in India our currency is inr(indian rupees) here is the conversion http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1499&amp;From=INR&amp;To=USD.,2015-09-29 15:26:39+00:00,cvi5f4i,3.0,t1_cvi55qa,403.0,Rainbow6
821,i got the game for just 22.65 us dollar(standard edition disc). so i won't call it expensive.,2015-09-29 15:16:52+00:00,cvi51gs,1.0,t3_3muabg,724.0,Rainbow6
822,so this is the first time they are testing the match making or whichever architecture you are talking about?. i hope they fixed it before launch.i have pre-order the game and after unity this game will decide whether i continue buying ubisoft games or or not(note to those who think i am going to pirate their games:-no i am not gonna pirate their game i always buy games that i like).best of luck i have very high hope for this.don't disappoint me.,2015-09-29 14:47:01+00:00,cvi3wzc,5.0,t1_cvi3kqp,548.0,Rainbow6
823,so you are saying ubisoft never tested the online architecture before?i am not angry just confuse and titalnfall beta is just for comparison nothing more.relax everyone gonna compare this beta to something.why so serious.,2015-09-29 14:26:46+00:00,cvi3685,3.0,t1_cvi2tmf,601.0,Rainbow6

829,i am not saying anything about movement bro.i am just its possible to equip it.practice make perfect.i knew what you are trying to say.yeah shield+pistol combo need some nerf but we haven't seen all classes in beta.maybe there is a class that can take down shield guy with ease.we have to wait and see.,2015-09-29 12:09:31+00:00,cvhzbrs,3.0,t1_cvhz7kd,346.0,Rainbow6
830,pistol are that accurate in real life and pistol can be fired with shield equipped.i think ubisoft is going for a team based game where you need to coordinate with team mates.you can use gas bomb or nitro to kill them.,2015-09-29 11:43:06+00:00,cvhytf2,1.0,t3_3mtlv6,306.0,Rainbow6

852,ping and frame rates is the most important thing in competitive fps games.game can be balanced even after the games launch.changes that came from bf4 cte to bf4 is living proof of that.as far as in my beta play time classes are balanced(excluding shield guy). right now they should try to fix the connectivity and disconnection issues.there is open beta coming where they can fix other problem https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/3mogl9/next_open_beta_or_confusion/cvgpqn7 .,2015-09-28 11:41:39+00:00,cvgrwpv,5.0,t1_cvgrn3q,944.0,Rainbow6
853,good thing about server browser is that you can see the server ping before jumping into a game and as i said before it will be faster.no one has to wait 15-20 minutes just find a game.,2015-09-28 11:24:46+00:00,cvgrmec,3.0,t1_cvgrkth,163.0,Rainbow6
