campaign:-story is good but not great it has no impact on me.most likely i just wanted to kill the doctor cause the way she talks in the dollar bills mission.after finishing all campaign me and friends included doesn't want to play those challenging mission cause the story is boring if played over and over again.that's why me and most of my friends has stopped playing pve cause there is nothing left to do there that interest us.challenging mode is just same thing more shotgunners in it.especially in warrengate amd russian consulate.they are not op but overused.after playing games like dragon age inquisition and witcher 3 i found this game story is average.1 of the big reason even angryjoe had said in his review videos is that if there is a virus infection in this game why we don't see any infected people.where are they.don't tell me that we have to pay to see a single infected person.
pvp:-it's boring and servers are always empty most of the time whenever i go in dark zone i found basically no one in there.if i got lucky i see 5 players at best.i think 24 player limits is one of the reason.most of the time me and my friend go to dark zone as a group then leave the group so we can go rogue on each other cause there is nobody else.
loot and crafting:-loot is useless.most of the time i just pick anything so i can deconstruct it make high end weapon or armor.most of the boss drops useless stuffs like kneepad and advanced mods for my gears.the only weapon the i got from killing a named boss short fuse that dropped a purple custom p416 g3.crafting is also boring when comparing it to other rpg games like witcher 3.in witcher 3 you knew what you are crafting in here it's all rng.which make it frustrating for me.as i said before these my opinion and mine alone.your maybe different and i would love to knew it.",thedivision,after playing 200 hours of this game.all i can say this game is average at best.,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/4c68db/after_playing_200_hours_of_this_gameall_i_can_say/

1st:-you can't see you friends outside of groups.not even in dark zone.as i have more than 10 friends playing beta and group limit is 4 i can't help them extract loots as they are just showing as orange dots in the game.i hope this got fixed by the release.
2nd:-loots are not very interested.you can get better weapons fron vendors(mostly from the vendor in morgan library if you want elite weapons).even killing elites in the game just drop blue weapons that i already have from pve.
3rd:-too much grinding.as you earn too low as you kill npc and loose more when you die.even more when you become rogue(by accidents included).i think this system will make buying weapons from vendors with real world cash much easier than grinding and finding loots then extracting.
these are the things that i didn't like about the game.i knew this is beta but these things are going unchanged in the full game.as these are my opnion other may or may not agree with me.let me know in the comment section why you agree and disagree with me.i have pre-order the game not gonna cancel dispite those 3 disappointment i have with the game doesn't take away the fun i have in both closed and open beta.i hope these 3 problems got addressed in the full game.",thedivision,disappointing things i noticed in the game.,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/46zkmz/disappointing_things_i_noticed_in_the_game/
