Point is still the fact that it's the biggest day of the year for the company who pays you all year long, and this is the major day they need people.

Secondly, Management doesn't get bonuses around black Friday, shit, most all black Friday comes in at a loss, so we aren't making anything.  You sir, however, would qualify for a my share in the final quarter and if you have big sales in November, that will help your bonus.

You don't have to be a company man to simply show up, do your time, help the customer and leave.  Meanwhie, this management team you think so highly of will essentially spend their ENTIRE day in Walmart ON Thanksgiving and NOT see their family at all.  Last year, 9am-10pm.

2.  Look at your TtlMD column.  This is your Total Markdowns.  This number should be somewhat consistent.  If you see spikes, it's due to people not doing markdowns, then on the spike day, they are all done at once.  Make sure Markdowns are done daily.

A.  On the wire, get the Detail Department Markdown Report.  This will show you the week prior ONLY.

107,"I have to say, I don't believe anything in the Bible is impertinent,  and therefore numbers do have meaning.  I believe the current teachings of the bible avoid these numbers either through ignorance or deception.  

You mentioned the number 12, but given what we know about history by facts, it's clear 12 was a magical and mystical number long before the Bible, example the Zodiac.  I might also point out that 12 in Numerology reduces to 3.... a powerful number in mystical teachings and the basis of the ""Trinity"".

It's also worth noting that 144000 reduces to 9 in Numerology and mystical numerical usage, by 1+4+4+0+0+0=9.  So does the 666 by 6+6+6=18= 1+8 = 9.  To draw the connection, 9 in Mystical writing was used to represent Conciousness.   And would then clue the adept reader that what they were to understand had to do with Conciousness in the teaching.

I don't know why there was such a divergence from teaching every aspect of the Bible and how it relates to us internally, with our core soul and Conciousness.   Seek ye first the Kingdom WITHIN.  ",2016-02-04 01:43:28+00:00,czn1khw,2.0,t1_czmcgod,35272.0,Bible

Problem is it isn't good enough and it's having an opposite affect.  Look at the RNC and them already planning a split convention,  where they can vote, have no majority, then put their candidate in the race.  If they can't do that, the RNC is prepared to loose to Hillary as long as they maintain control of the Republican Party, control of that money and their role in the process which ultimately serves to grow government,  enslave the population, and take all the wealth from America. That's why there is such a push for gun control.  Outlaw all guns at some point, confiscate and stop production by private companies. When the population is disarmed, you can easily make them submit to authority.

I will do all the notes myself because associates are not there for us to get them done anymore.  I will eat, sleep, breathe, consume, and shit Walmart for the entire time I'm an ASM.

166,"Just got info at a shrink meeting.

No more ims 1st shift.  2 second shift ims leads who will work 4 10hr shifts. 4on, 3off.  They will be responsible for 2 teams.  One unloading the gm truck, another strategically stocking grocery. When a Cart fills up from the gm truck for grocery,  it's pulled to the floor and stocked.  Same shift for Unloaders, 4-1, but depending on store, something like 14 2nd shift ims.  

1st shift ims will be like 5am-2pm.  They will continue to prep overstock and place in the bins.  No binning, just label prepped and put in bin.  They will also be responsible for helping to work the consumable bins during their shift.  Meaning, they will scan bins with consumable DM to get stockable freight from bin to floor.  Expectation is to scan through ALL BINS.

Can't remember much on third shift ims and their duties.  

No more system picks.   No more binning.  No more bin audits no more bin accuracy.  DM owns that freight in the backroom.   Bottom line.  No notes should take away from CAP routine, period.  Market managers were in there too.
