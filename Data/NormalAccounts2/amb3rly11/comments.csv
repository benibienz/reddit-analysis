3,"I am a visual learner as well, and I struggled to enjoy audiobooks for a long while because of it. In addition, I am a very poor auditory learner. I found that I had trouble focusing for long periods of listening to books without the text to occupy my eyes.

HOWEVER, I went from reading maybe one book every two months to reading 5-6 books a month after I finished my first audiobook. I began with the Harry Potter audiobooks (the hard copies are a personal favorite) and fell in love. Because I already had a template of the characters and universe in my head, it was a much smoother experience for me.

Now? I'm addicted. I'm starting to pick out my favorite narrators and listen to books I normally wouldn't listen to because of the phenomenal performances. New books are sometimes a struggle but I find my listening ability and attention span are improving markedly with time. As long as I busy myself with a secondary task (cleaning, driving, walking, folding clothes) to engage me visually, I am able to focus and enjoy.

9,"OP. DO NOT do this. Don't. In medical school, we call a person who does this a gunner (someone who deliberately circulates wrong information so that their peers perform lower). It will make it SEEM like you're cutting your classmate's legs out from under them so that you can effortlessly rise to the top.

Once it gets to the graduate level, Engineering will become an intimate field of study. Everyone will know someone who knows another person at a different school and NO ONE LIKES A GUNNER. If you do this, you'll be remembered as the gunner. People will shut you out, inform people already established in the career about you. Depending on who you potentially fuck over on this undergrad exam, a stunt like circulating the wrong information in such a competitive area of study would ruin you. People who go into engineering or medicine or law remember this stuff, and they will make damn sure it'll never be forgotten.


I truly KNOW how much it sucks for your notes to be shared without your permission. I used to hate it, too. But now, as a third year medical student, people from OTHER schools heard about my flash cards I made as a first and second year student and ask for them, and I will share them. That is a much more meaningful and fulfilling interaction than being deliberately isolated and shut out for being a gunner. 


I'm not saying share your notes with everyone. I'm just saying DON'T SHARE WRONG NOTES. Some universities (especially grad programs) even have a no tolerance policy on gunners that could get you flagged by the admin OR EXPELLED. Peers, younger students, employers--NO ONE LIKES A GUNNER.

Where the first book feels very claustrophobic, the second book really opens up and the writer finds his footing and starts to really explore the expanses of the galaxy.

36,"* **Red Rising Trilogy** by Pierce Brown. Really fast paced, excellent narration. It is a space opera with a lot ancient roman imagery. Starts a bit slow so it can do some world building, but picks up pretty quick after the first hour. Guy does a lot of different accents really well. I'm currently finish up the last book and it's been a wild ride!

* **The Girl with all the Gifts** (can't recall the author at the moment.) A fresh spin on Post Apoc fiction that dabbles with a bit of science and gets it *right* (love me some accurate science woven into my narrative).  Female British narrator keeps a crisp pace and the narrative itself is emotionally charged and full of vivid description and action. I can't tell you much more because half the fun is in the discovery, here.

* **Dresden Files** by Jim Butcher. Already been mentioned by a few others here. Noir/Detective fiction set in and Urban Fantasy universe. These are excellent, narrator really breathes life into the Noir aspect. Super moody. However, the first one is really tropey/hokey. A lot of fans of the series seem to forget that (because the later installments are SO good, and so worth wading through the first one.) 

* **Iron Druid Chronicles** By Kevin Hearne. I don't see these recommended here a lot, but boy are they a hoot. Don't get turned off by the cheesy harlequin like covers because these are not romances. Immortal Irish Druid dude with a really dry sense of humor keeps getting his life interrupted by various ghoulish things/other immortals. He has an Irish wolfhound companion and the voice/attitude of the protagonist is hilarious. Pretty cheap if you do the kindle book+whispersync deal on Amazon. 

* **A song of ice and fire** George RR Martin. I hesitate to suggest these for your exact purpose because after the first they become pretty long winded and convoluted. The first is fairly straightforward and action packed, though.

Best of luck! Currently going on a bit of a heroes journey myself :)

37,"Screenshots of My Fitness Pal recipe and macros included.

This made 8 servings (the large baking dish in the center holds three servings. I already ate one and it was a-ok)

Note: I tend to only eat breakfast and an early dinner, so these servings are quite large. You might want to make this 9 or 10 servings instead.

Instructions:

* Brown beef in large/deep skillet. I like to pour half a cup of water in with the beef and stir frequently to make sure beef cooks up finer instead of chunkier. Start the beef cooking on medium low so you can chop your veggies while it browns.

* Once beef is nearly browned, add in the onion, finely chopped. Cook until onions are clear and beef is fully browned. You can add a bit of garlic powder/Italian seasoning here as desired (I did. Yum.) 

* Pour in canned spaghetti sauce of choice (or homemade, if you're feeling industrious). I used a big ol jar of traditional prego from Sams club, 7.5 cups or so. I like saucey spaghetti, so use your own judgement here.

* bring to boil then reduce to simmer.

* Zoodle your zucchini. This was my first time adding the zucchini again, and honestly I could've doubled or tripled it.

* salt and sear your zucchini in a pan. Drain out water. Set to the side.

* Cook your noodles as per their directions. Drain em.

* Mix your zoodles with your noodles.

* I have 5 individual serve, bakable pyrex. I got these on sale about a year ago and they've been incredible. Whatever cook wear you are using, spread the noodles on the bottom, layer the sauce on top of that.

* top all of it off with a layer of mozzarella cheese.

* Bake at 400 degrees F for around 20 minutes until brown.

* allow to cool.

* I freeze whatever meals I won't eat within 3 days, then move meals from the freezer to the fridge the day before I eat them, but you do you.

40,"This surgery followed the procedure of any other transplant surgery I had done. I allowed my mind to numb so that my subconscious could direct the precise, practiced motions in my hands. 

*Ten blade*

*Lap pads*

*Retractor*

*More than that now, student doctor Avery. Really open her up.*

*Suction*

*Clamps*

During a few moments my focus faltered: the first incision, removing the worn out wad of necrotic tissue from the patient, placing the alien flesh into the body cavity. During those fragile seconds I reigned the wild thoughts back in and took a few breaths to isolate my mind again. I could easily kill this patient if I questioned my moral stance while she was open on the table. One tremble of my hands and I could slice open an artery or a ureter and an easy procedure would rapidly devolve into a desperate attempt to save this patient's life.

When it came time to close her, I became aware of the spectators in the viewing room--Dozens of them packed so tightly that only the ones in front could actually see my performance. The others were only here so that they could go back to their respective workplaces with claims that they were a part of this unprecedented event. ""I helped make history today,"" they would say.

I removed my blood slicked hands from her abdomen, stepped back, pressed my lips together until they tingled and breathed through my nose what was probably the only full breath of air that I'd drawn into my lungs in hours. I rolled my shoulders. I cracked my neck reveling in the way my body creaked and sighed after standing so stiff for so long.

""Student doctor Avery, would you like to close?"" I asked. 

His eyes widened above his surgical mask. ""Me?""

""Yes. You do know how to suture, don't you?""

""Yes, of course Dr. Janson. I would be honored.""

What we had done here today couldn't be undone. I made to exit the OR, feeling dizzy. The chief of surgery caught me by the shoulder before I could leave. I couldn't look him in the eye.

""Celebrate, brother, for we have changed the world!"" He whispered, his voice fierce. Hungry.

""Yes, but was it for the better?"" I muttered, shoving the door open with my shoulder and peeling my gown and gloves from my body as I did so. I navigated the hospital halls as easily as a rat that'd run a maze one-thousand times to get to her room.

When I arrived, no one was there but her. Why would there be? I wasn't surprised.

She lay unconscious on the hospital bed, still under the effects of the anesthesia. Her small chest rose and fell in the distinct rhythm that said *I am alive.* One of her hands curled around the nasal cannula. As light and discrete as only a surgeon could be, I slid my fingers beneath hers and re-positioned her fist under her chin so she wouldn't pull the tubing out. My skin brushed her porcelain cheek in the process. 

She left whispers of warmth across my knuckles.

Six years old and her entire life spent in a medical building. She had thoughts and feelings and desires that no one acknowledged. According to the law, she was not human. Someone owned her in a way that no other living creature could be owned. A serial number stamped her very DNA.

Today, six years in the making, I performed the first clone-to-original kidney transplant surgery and the hospital broadcasted the event live to billions of viewers across the globe.

Yes, I'd changed the world. 

I don't think it was for the better.

46,"/u/malachor708 gave you strong advice, so I'm going to go for a chronological critique of things that stood out to me

**A few specific edits to start out**

&gt; Standing outside the tube station at six forty am with fish nibbling his toes,  Espen Stengard knew that today was the last day he would ever spend at his desk.

Because he never actually spends any time at his desk (that I noticed) maybe use this line to say something like ""... knew that today was the last day that would keep him from the open water.""

&gt; Darwin, hunched over a microscope, trying to figure out why these organisms were acting so hopelessly,

Darwin isn't widely renowned for his microscopic observations. Instead, is he famous for his macroscopic observation of evolution. This is large scale observation. Darwin was in the field far more than in a lab. Something like ""Darwin, hunched over a notebook, scribbling as he tried to figure out why these organisms were acting so hopelessly."" If you're referring to specific work Darwin did with a microscope, illustrate it here. Otherwise you'll snap readers out of their immersion.

&gt;said Lilly, the pink-haired, part-time journalist.

This is more show than tell. What about her would make readers know she is a journalist? Maybe she has a camera around her and a nice messenger bag, from which she takes several notebooks and folders full of news clippings. Maybe she has a foreign accent. 

&gt; If she had enough people reading her stories, she’d remain immortal, and, because everyone was reading her stories, she presumed all her readers were all sublime

This line of text paired with the inclusion of a few more details I suggested above constitutes a strike through of part-time journalist description. Your readers will figure it out.

&gt; She said: “Have you seen this picture?”

Instead, do: She said, ""Have you...

&gt;Espen **beg** the question, “Why?” There was no one there to answer. He was **begging** on

A bit of distracting word repetition here that I noticed. I'd change one or the other.

What is this? I googled it and no definition came up.

&gt;No one seemed to care. People splashed around in the muddy flood-water in their new trainers.

""No one seemed to care"" is a bit redundant here. If they're splashing around floodwaters in their new trainers, they either don't care or view the act as a necessary evil, given the current state of things.

&gt;crooned Dean “Duck” Carter, who saw the email over Espen's shoulder.

This intro seems clumsy. Just call him Duck if that's what Espen knows him as! If another character comes along that knows Duck as Dean, worry about calling him Dean at that point. Not necessary here.

&gt;A slow decay: the potato in the cupboard, growing arms and hairs, but still edible, only just.

Brilliant. I adore this. I also love the character description of the boss and how he meticulously measures his cocaine and wipes his seat. Beautiful characterization.

&gt;Darwin over the microscope, frustrated with the little mites

You're drawing certain parallels between Darwin and Espen. Espen just bought a boat, right? Darwin actually did quite a bit of sailing on the *HMS Beagle's* second expedition. It even launched from the Thames. If this is whe're you're heading with the paralell, awesome! Just keep in mind Darwin is famous for his macro observations, not his micro ones (esp. Darwin's finches on the Galapagos)

&gt;cocaine-addict eyes

What do cocaine addict eyes look like? Cocaine is a stimulant, so his pupils will be dilated. Maybe the sclerae are also red from ruptured blood vessels. He may also be nervous or agitated, his eyelids may twitch and his focus may dart from place to place due to his hyperactivity.

&gt;Espen did see himself out. Right out of the office.

Is this supposed to imply that he will never return, like you mentioned in the beginning? If so, it needs to have a little more finality and also a lot more excitement. It seems like he is about to start an adventure!

___

**Overall**

I feel like you have a strong hold on your prose and your voice. The above are the only details that distracted me. One of your biggest strengths is your characterization. Dialogue seems natural and Espen's mind and thoughts give him a unique voice. I would love to read more when you write it.",2016-09-06 02:05:45+00:00,d7azx3w,1.0,t3_51aytz,25319.0,DestructiveReaders
47,"**Was it entertaining to read?**

I enjoy your voice. If anything, the voice in your writing is the only thing that offers any service to help the chemistry metaphor succeed. Sentence fragments imply partial thoughts and string together well into complex thoughts. It gives the writing a ""thinking out loud."" 

___

**Was the prose any good?**

* Overall: I think this has promise, but the chemistry metaphor is weak and distracting. I will touch on that later. That said, I think that the contrast between the girls and their friendship in spite of their differences is a lovely story waiting to be told.

* Phrases I loved:

&gt;Names are exchanged, and a friendship is formed. Looking back, relationships in elementary school seem simpler. They are not. We simply remember less, and nostalgia fills in the rest.

I adore the truth to this statement. It is lovely.

&gt;One girl has warm food and hugs and words when she walks home, and the other has a house.

Absolutely beautiful. This is a perfect illustration of how lack of description in contrast to provided description can achieve the desired emotional impact on the reader.

* Specific edits: 

&gt; The first mother helps with homework, takes into consideration needs and wants and tears, and her hands are soft with kindness. The second mother has nicotine stains on the corner of her lips and red lipstick to cover it.
The first girl has good grades and good food and good behavior. The second girl has sex and drugs and scars.

Okay. Remember how I loved the ""other has a house,"" part? I this block of text that follows robs the house statement of its power. I know that this information is needed in the story, but I dont think it needs to go here. It weakens the thing that you said moments before. Plus, you already mentioned food in the previous paragraph. Maybe change it to read something like: ""One girl has warm food and hugs and words when she walks home to a mother whose hands are soft with kindness. The other has a house.""

I do enjoy the imagery of the nicotine stained lips and lipstick and the other girl having sex and using drugs, but I'm not sure where it needs to go in the narrative. ""The other has a house"" is such a powerful statement that I don't want to detract from it.

&gt;bad poetry

I know what you mean here, but I think you know stronger words to describe their poetry in the place of ""bad."" Bad is bland. Bad is show, not tell. What kind of poetry does your typical teenage girl write? I can think of a few ways to describe it: cliched, melodramatic

&gt;Her friend mentions her newest boyfriend and her mother’s newest boyfriend.

Vary the text a bit here. Maybe describe the mother's boyfriend as her ""newest man."" Repetition can strengthen your prose but it doesn't do so in this particular instance.


___

**Was it confusing? If so, which part?**

&gt;She is not athletic enough to *hit* her peers

I might change the focus of this statement to the weakness of her throws. In dodge ball, catching an opponent's ball gets the one who threw it out of the game but the person who catches it actually gets to call another team member sitting on the bench back into the game. This can truly turn the tide of the game if the opposing team brings a strong player (previously taken out) back into the game. Her weak throws would be easily caught and would put her team at a distinct disadvantage.

Or is it that she isn't in the game at all? If this is the case, picking up balls and handing them back to her team would be an illegal move on her team's part.

&gt;A shy, nerdy girl... A freckled girl, with glasses and a bright smile

I was confused at first that these two were the same people. After all, freckles and glasses are also connotative nerdy and shy. Give them more descriptive modifiers to distinguish them from one another. Perhaps shy, nerdy girl could have her hair down and freckle girl could have her hair in a ponytail. 

&gt;About her future child—though she is just a child—dead before she could care about it.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean here. Was she pregnant and aborted the child? Did she miscarry? ""Future child"" implies that she was excited about it, which means that she didn't abort willingly, if she was pregnant in the first place. Clarify what you mean. 

&gt;It is a chemical reaction that starts with *one*

The intro in parenthesis felt awkward, probably because of my chemistry and biology background. Chemical reactions never start with one element (ions and free radicals may be different, but generally speaking) You have to have at least two for a reaction to happen. The element sodium (Na+) is actually an incredibly volatile element *if* it comes into contact with water. The reaction that ensues is violently explosive. That explosion will never happen if the elemental sodium remains isolated from water. This is why it is stored under oil, to displace any water that might come into contact with the sodium.

I understand what you were trying to achieve here. You wanted the violent imagery of a rapidly spreading, volatile chemical reaction. Perhaps changing the phrase to ""It is a chemical reaction that spreads. It always spreads,"" will do the trick.

&gt;(Chemiluminescence: and then there was light.)

&gt;(Catalysis: and it goes faster and faster and faster)

&gt;(Solvent: from the Latin solvo, meaning “I loosen, untie, and solve.”)

I think I understand what you intended to do with these things, but I don't think it gives the effect that you desired. If you're going to parallel your story to a chemical reaction, then the parallels need to follow the structure of a chemical reaction. This doesn't, and it actually does more to prevent your readers from immersing themselves in the story than it does to strengthn what your narrative is saying. 

The only common practice of Chemiluminescence is when CSIs use luminol and hydrogen peroxide to detect the presence of, among other things, bodily fluid (blood, semen, etc) in a crime scene. Most readers wont know what this is and it only offers to confuse them. I can appreciate you trying to parallel the second girl with the practice of using chemiluminescece to aid a crime scene investigation, but again, it only distracts your reader. 

I think the strongest parallel that you draw between chemistry and the girls is the one of catalysis. Good girl serves as a catalyst to hurry the process of bringing the mistreated girls' misfortune into the light. If you do decide to continue with the chemistry metaphor, use this catalysis as a backbone.

Solvent, though correctly defined in Latin, serves to DISSOLVE things in chemistry. Water is a common and excellent solvent due to its properties of polarity. To be a solvent, there also needs to be a solute, or thing that needs to be dissolved. Note: not all solvents are liquid. Who here are you saying is the solvent? The good girl, trying to dissolve the other girl's problems (solute)? It is a weak parallel to draw, and it seems clumsy. 

__

**Did you think the format was alright? Was too gimmicky?**

I appreciate you trying to use a chemistry metaphor to emphasize aspects of these girl's lives, but it doesn't work as it stands. You will alienate readers with a science background. I think that there is a powerful story to be told here and that a chemistry metaphor **can** be achieved. I am a firm believer that science and science allegory and metaphor has a lot to offer literature. It is almost an entirely untapped resource in the literary world. For science to be successful in literature is an incredibly delicate process. Do you go all out and science the shit out of some literature? Maybe that's what it takes to work. Andy Weir's ""Martian"" delves earnestly into some entry level chemistry and botany and the book was wildly successful because of it.

For it to work in your story, a few things need to happen:

1) one of the girls, or both of the girls, need to love chemistry. Chemistry needs to be their passion. Have the girls write poetry about chemistry. Tie parallels between actual chemistry and the chemistry between people and chemistry used in real life (chemiluminescene is in crime scene investigations and in the mechanism fireflies use to light up. That's romantic.) Think about contrasting the dodgeball scene, where one girl was awkward and the other wasn't, with a chemistry scene where the grace of the girl's is reversed. Or, Make them both clumsy at dodge ball and graceful at chemistry. 

2) Build on your metaphor. Most readers don't know the terminology. Find a way to incorporate definitions into your work (but in witty ways. Don't straight out define things. Work it into the narrative and dialogue.) Also, Don't define things in latin if you're going for the chemistry metaphor.

3) Your science has to be accurate. If not, people who don't know science will walk away with inaccurate knowledge and people who DO know science will walk away. Period. 

I'm rooting you on with this one :) Give it your best.

48,"**Overall** you set the tone well and it has the potential to become an excellent short story.

**Word Choice** 

&gt;She nodded blankly

I feel like you could give us more here. After all, her blank quality is a self affliction intended to mask her ugliness and it is, along with the the beauty, her major characterization. Perhaps she ""Nodded, eyes vacant but undeniably alive."" Or maybe she ""Nodded, face as expressive as marble."" Think of words that have a blank, sterile connotation and describe her. Maybe she isn't blank to this man; maybe he notices cracks in her mask and sees the profound sadness that shrouds her soul. 

&gt;He spoke plenty and *even* with his mouth full.

*Even* is the offender, here. Just as the girl's most profound characterization is her sadness/blankness, his major characterization is the fact that he speaks with his mouth full more frequently than when it is empty. Perhaps you should say he ""spoke plenty and especially with his mouth full,"" or ""spoke plenty and only when his mouth was full."" 

&gt;albeit a *very pretty* discontent mask

Usually, the word *very* offers little to readers. I recommend reviewing all the *verys* in your story and asking yourself how else you could describe things. Instead of *very pretty* you could say *gorgeous* or you could say ""mask of flawless, porcelain skin and scarlet stained cheeks."" Etc. 

&gt;Just the mask

Just and very. The word *just* implies a *lack of something the reader hopes for.* To achieve this *lack* describe things in contrast to the reader's hope. When the man turns around to face his wife, the reader is caught up anticipating her smile and the detriment that will follow. Instead of saying ""just the mask"" you can either describe her lack of smile or what her expression actually is. 

&gt;regarded her *strangely*

How does someone do this? Think of their actions of a person *strangely* regarding someone. You might say he ""appraised her for an uncomfortable amount of time"" or ""His eyes attempted to strip her of the mask, unrelenting in its blandness.""

&gt;Silence again, except for the *chewing*

Describe the chewing. This sound should unsettle readers and frustrate them. Who enjoys it when someone chews large quantities of food with poor manners? No one. Exploit this knowledge. The potential here is absolutely lovely. ""It was silent, except for the three spoonfuls of mashed potatoes and another of beef churning in the man's mouth.""

**Character Girl** you say that the girl is pretty often, but you don't explain in what way she is pretty. What are her movements like, what does she smell like, what do people see when they look at her face? Her beauty and silence are the focus of the story so expand on it!

**I will pick up here later** something unexpected came up so I can't finish my critique yet. I promise I will come back because I want to see this story grow! Some things I will touch on next:

**the girl's ugliness**

**Character Man** his chewing. I love it.

**Character of the town** the end of the story witnesses the girl after he downfall, but she is beautiful. I want to hear more reactions from the town because the town can be seen as a third character.",2016-09-04 16:16:37+00:00,d797swf,1.0,t3_512syn,36903.0,DestructiveReaders

I genuinely believe it is the unfamiliarity of it. It took a while for me to settle in to my first present tense book. It is a distracting tense to use and it has inherent obstacles to overcome in that readers aren't widely versed in reading the present tense. That's not to say it doesn't also have a unique set of advantages to relaying a narrative of readers can get past it.",2016-09-03 22:35:00+00:00,d78henn,4.0,t1_d78g5o8,2209.0,writing
50,"Rachel stiffened. Mr. Fox's mask mocked her with wide, black framed eyes. The fox's nose concealed the man's. All that Rachel could see of his face was his clean shaven chin and his thin lips. Mr. Fox's mouth twitched into the slightest of smiles. 

""Shall we begin?"" He said, gesturing to the contents of his bag, which were arranged along the table top of the first row in a sterile, calculated line. Rachel noticed her iPad, charger, and stylus to Mr. Fox's immediate right. A flash drive, an older model iphone that was not hers, a manila folder, and a single capped syringe of clear fluid followed.

Rachel dove across the desk top behind her and scrambled through the row of chairs. She clawed at them, desperately trying to clear a path to the exit at the back of the lecture hall. Her breaths tore from her lungs in panicked gasps. She was distantly aware that'd she'd slammed her naked toes into something, but the pain was silenced by her frenzied body.

""Surely,"" Said Mr. Fox, his voice unruffled, ""You must recognize these clothes. The tie was a gift from you to Caleb, after all. A gift for Caleb to wear to the white coat ceremony when you both started medical school.""

Rachel made it to the isle and the exit was only a short sprint away. She whipped around to face Mr. Fox, back pressed against the wall. Her eyes fixed on Caleb's yellow floral bow tie. Rachel's could feel her heart pounding in her throat. She swallowed.

""Didn't you,"" Mr. Fox began before pinching either side of the bow tie with his fingers to straighten it, ""Make it yourself? To give to him."" 

The silence that followed demanded Rachel's answer. ""Yes,"" her whisper echoed into the high ceilings.

""What a thoughtful--"" Mr. Fox tidied the already straight flash drive. ""--Loving--"" He picked up the unfamiliar phone. ""--Selfless--"" he slid his gloved fingers along the desk to the last item of the row. ""--Sister,"" He tapped the syringe with one hand and tilted his head, studying Rachel, a slight smile traced along his lips.

Rachel pressed her mouth into a thin line and edged towards the exit.

""Being the intelligent young woman that you are, you must be thinking, 'How do I know you didn't steal the tie and Caleb is safe in his apartment, asleep in his bed right now?'"" Mr. Fox said. He pursed his lips before he began to navigate menus of the old iPhone. ""Marvelous things, these smart gloves,"" he said, placing the phone onto the desk again. Its screen was bright in the dark room. ""Keeps things tidy."" He punctuated his sentence with one final tap to the screen.""

""--Rachel? What have you done to her? Where am I? Oh, god. What did you do to Amy? Amy. She's bleeding. What did you do? Amy, wake up. God, Babe, wake up,"" Caleb's said. His words were overcome by a wave of soul crushing sobs. Rachel pressed cold fingertips to her mouth to hold in her gasp and, trembling, slid down the wall until she was sitting on the ground. 

""Nearly 6AM. 22 hours remain to prepare yourself for the exam. As long as you cooperate, regardless of if you pass or fail, I will not kill your brother. Amy,"" He said, bowing his head and frowning, ""Amy was an unnecessary accident.""

Delicate notes of unfamiliar classic music pierced the room. A blinding white screen lit up in the front of the room that read, ""Classical Music Series Part One of Ten: Fundamentals.""",2016-09-03 20:48:25+00:00,d78dpjf,2.0,t1_d78947z,7474.0,WritingPrompts

You must correctly answer 56 of the 80 questions, scoring an overall 70%, to exit this classroom with your life,"" the man wearing the fox mask said in a digitally distorted voice. He was garbed in a professionally tailored navy suit. A yellow floral bow tie kept his pressed, white color tight around his neck.

The lecture hall yawned. It was dim and empty save for Rachel and the well-dressed man in the fox mask. Silence permeated the room for a handful of seconds, timed by the old wall clock behind him. The laugh that burst from Rachel was a genuine one. It rolled up and out of her lips from below her chest. Rachel lifted her glasses from her nose and blotted the tears from the corners of her eyes with the neck of the over-sized t-shirt she'd worn to bed. ""When I told you to make sure I was up early to study, I thought I'd get a phone call at 6AM or, if you were feeling frisky, you'd show up on my doorstep with an iced coffee at the ass crack of dawn. Forcing me into your car--you wearing that costume-- and dragging me to lecture hall? I can't deny it's effectiveness. You can cut the shit, though, Caleb. What time is it, anyway?""

Caleb's watch caught a beam of light and its face flashed as he whipped it around  to note the time. ""5:25 AM,"" He said and pulled once at the front of his suit jacket to straighten it.

Rachel groaned. She wrapped her arms across her chest, shivering. ""Okay. I need to go back to my place and get my iPad."" She stood up, stretching her arms above her for a few moments and delighting in the stiffness of sleep easing from her back.

""I brought everything you will need for the day here. You need to get started right away. The introductory hour is almost over."" Caleb ducked under the leather strap across his chest and placed his briefcase on the lecture podium. He tidied his carefully styled hair with a flat, gloved palm before He began to rifle through its contents.

Rachel settled back into her seat. She allowed her head to tip backwards, resting on the upper edge of the chair, and stared at the tiled ceiling. She spun left and right, her bare toes dragging along the carpeted floor. ""Turn off that voice thing. It's creeping me out in a serious way,"" she murmured. She was trying to fend off the fingers of sleep that tantalizingly brushed her cheeks. ""You didn't happen to stuff a blanket in there, did you? Oh, nice bag, by the way. Did Amy get it for you as a birthday gift? Sorry I didn't stop by your party the other day. The fucking brachial plexus turned me into a monster that evening. Think I finally got it though. I know a cool memory tool to help you remember winged scapula if you haven't heard it already.""

The voice that responded, unaltered by the device that was now off, was entirely unfamiliar to Rachel. It was soft and faintly accented, as though the speaker's first language had not been english. ""You may refer to me as Mr. Fox. Some people call me ""The Educator."" I do intend to. Educate you. My success depends on you. I think that would be best achieved without,"" he said, plucking a strand of hair from the arm of his suit and inhaling sharply, ""A blanket.""

64,"Sergeant Clark lifted his wrist to look at the band wrapped around it. It was no different than the fitness trackers people wore, except that it was reinforced by thick ropes of steel. It looked boring, actually. Black, some kind of supple rubber. A little digital heart pulsed consistently beside of a number that read 96. A cold blade of panic pierced his back, shooting a chill up his neck and across his scalp. He swallowed against an entirely too-dry throat, feeling the tissue scrape across itself like sandpaper. The sensation gagged him and he had to suppress his body's reflex to retch.

He managed to tear his eyes from his own wrist to a face concealed by a mask without contour or color. ""You have 60 seconds. If your heart still beats after, the nuclear bombs will launch. It doesn't matter what countries will be hit. What matters is the one that fired them. The USA."" 

It was strange where his mind went as he targeted the stranger with the barrel of his gun. He thought of how he'd never have a dog. His parents would never let him have one of his own growing up and life had never given him the opportunity to bring one into his life as an adult, between never having an apartment that allowed him as he failed out of college, and all of the travel required by his secret career. He didn't think of Lucy or his mom. He thought of this dog, that probably would have been brown and white or something and ate its own vomit. He would've named it Daniels, because Jack would've raised some brows with the reputation Sergeant Clark had made for himself.

Hands numb, he lowered the barrel of his gun. The number on the wristband was nearing 200. He felt disconnected from his body other than his nose, which was ice cold. He closed his eyes and smiled. He didn't know what was funny, but he couldn't deny that something was. He relaxed his shoulders, let the rifle fall slack on its strap across his chest, and pulled his pistol from its holster on his hip. The metal should've been cold against his temple, but he wouldn't have noticed it had it not been for the determined pressure of it. Almost forgetting them, Sergeant Clark turned to face his squad. Why? He wasn't sure. Maybe to say he was sorry. Maybe to thank them for his time with them the last five years. Maybe it was so the last thing he saw before he died was a familiar face, if not a friend.

Instead, what he saw was the barrels of five guns with highly trained fingers on the triggers. He was glad he couldn't see their eyes.

Sergeant Clark holstered his pistol in a practiced, mechanical movement and gave a short nod that was both an order, a pardon, and an apology all at the same time.

74,"""I'll have a grande skinny iced mocha with coconut milk,"" the slender brunette said from the other side of the counter.

Janice's hands were clammy. Her stomach was a hot coil below her chest. ""Are you sure?""

The woman gazed at Janice for a few seconds before offering her a mild smile, ""Yes.""

Janice pressed her paling lips together and rang the woman up with trembling fingers. She pressed the back of one hand to her mouth. ""That'll be $4.21,"" Janice gasped behind her hand.

The woman's expression grew concerned. ""Are you okay?"" she asked.

Janice nodded, averted her gaze, and gestured toward the card reader. ""You can swipe it."" Janice was able to distract herself from the mental images and suppressed another wave of nausea.

""Are you sure that you're alright?"" the customer had taken a step back from the counter.

""Absolutely,"" said Janice. She straightened the hem of her green smock. ""It'll be just one moment on your drink. I am the only one working at the moment.""

""Take your time.""

Janice's heart was flinging itself desperately into her throat. She took a few deep breaths to collect herself and wiped the sweat from her forehead with the sleeve of her shirt. *Just focus on the coffee. Think only about the coffee.*

She poured some coldbrew coffee into a cup and couldn't help but notice the soggy splattering noises that it made when it touched the plastic. *Just like,* Janice rounded her back to conceal a gag.

*Don't think of that. Think about the glass of the window. That's innocent. It couldn't possibly remind me of--* Janice's mouth filled with saliva and her stomach stomach attempted to evacuate her body through her esophagus. *Thank god I didn't have* **breakfast.**  Janice's body heaved, her mouth agape. A string of drool hung from her lower lip and she swatted it away before the customer could notice.

""Should I call someone?"" The customer's voice wavered.

Janice waved her question away. *Coconut milk, a couple of pumps of mocha, and ice.*

Janice opened the refrigerator and the door seal squelched from **moisture.** Janice sank to her knees as she clawed for the coconut milk inside. Her stomach was a roiling and inflamed. She poured a wave of white liquid and it mixed with the dark coffee. Janice could imagine it curdling after a couple of hours, chunks of it separating from the acidic cold brew. 

Janice pulled the neck of her smock over her nose, as if it would shield her from the bombardment of invasive thoughts. She could feel the tissue on the inside of her throat rubbing against itself. It gagged her. Desperately, she slapped her hand down three times on the pump of skinny mocha. Even though she tried to tear her eyes away from the jets of thick, brown syrup, she couldn't. It slogged into the coffee-coconut milk mixture and settled in ropes of itself at the bottom.

Janice sank to the floor and pressed her cheek against the cool tile there. Just before losing consciousness in a pool of her own spit she said, ""The ice is in that thing over there.""

75,"Hi! I'm coming here from your CC thread. Good stuff, overall! I'm going to jump right in with the critique, though.

&gt;I've seen many things throughout my adventures; hordes of undead, terrible beasts and some of the most wicked demons imaginable. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw in the stockade of dread.

&gt;I am Aurius The Pure, a 10th level paladin dreamed up by a 20 year old art student from Maine. As a defender of the weak, I felt it was my duty to keep the horrors of the stockade from ever escaping

This is good information that readers need. Think about removing it from the beginning and weaving it into the rest of your story and begin with: 

&gt;It was my first night on guard; 

and so on. Sprinkle the rest of the information in. 

Also, instead of saying

&gt;an indescribable horror! So many horrific visages, so many appendages

Jump into describing, similar to this that you wrote, which is excellent: 

&gt;mass of interwoven flesh and limbs

The reader will have some questions: what does it smell like? What did it feel like when it pulled the protagonist toward it? How did it pull the protagonist? Did it wrap a clammy tentacle around him, or did spew a warm web around his body.

Finally, avoid ALL cliche phrases. You did a good job at this, the only one I noticed was:

I hope that helps :)

76,"The young woman’s face was tinted blue from the light of her phone. The bar, dim and screened in smoke, was unusually crowded that night. “I’m not going to ask you if you want me to buy you a drink. I already did,” Jackson said, voice raised over the noise of dozens of conversations. He slid into the booth beside of her despite the seat across the table being empty.

Her eyes, framed with dark liner and thick lashes, snapped away from her phone. She looked him up and down before giving him a thin smile. She placed her phone on the top of the table, crossed her arms, and leaned against the wall beside of the booth. “What makes you think I’m going to drink it?”

“Because you’re a first year law student and you just had exams today and you don’t already have a drink,” he said.  

Her shoulders softened. “You’re Jackson James, aren’t you?”

“So they say.” His eyes skimmed the bar before returning to hers. He ran a hand through his dark hair. 

“You know they also say your study guides are legendary. I would love to get my hands on those. What did you order me?” she was grinning now. She picked her phone up off of the table, mischief in her eyes. 

“I asked the bartender to give you what you usually order.”

“How do you know I am here often enough to have a ‘usual order?’”

He gave her a look. “I was a first year a year ago.”

She met his eyes before she began to type a message on her phone. “Okay, so I have a usual order.”

“Mhmm,” He tipped his beer bottle against his lips. “What is holding up your friends?” He began to shrug out of his blazer. 

“They’re claiming all of the ubers are busy,” She said. Her mouth became a thin line but she uncrossed her arms. “Why are you here, anyway? Don’t you have exams tomorrow?”

He rested his arm across the top of the booth behind her. “I can never study the night before. I feel like studying so close to an exam can only confuse information. If you’re twenty-four hours out, you either know it or you don’t.”

Her eyes appraised him carefully. “Interesting philosophy but, well, most of us are too human to execute that tactic with much precision.”

A waitress waded through the crowd and deposited a bright blue martini on their table before diving back towards the bar. “Keep the tab open,” Jackson called after her. A thumbs up broke free from the masses. “A cotton candy martini?” Jackson remarked, eyebrows high. 

“What? Were you hoping I had more refined tastes, Jackson?,” she held his gaze, “Am I less of a catch now that I don’t drink local brews? So basic of me.” She cupped the martini in her palm and brought it to her mouth. Her throat bobbed three--no four-- times before she returned it to its coaster. It was more than half gone. Jackson’s smile carved dimples into his cheeks. He loosened his tie and waved at the bar for another martini.

“So it’s true,” she murmured before finishing the martini. She began to lick the pink sugar from the rim. Chewing her lips thoughtfully, she gave a resolute, “Okay.” 

“Okay, what?” Jackson began to run a finger along the back of her neck.

She tossed her carefully curled hair over her shoulder.“Okay, get me drunk. I’ve gone nearly 36 hours without any sleep and a week without decent sleep. I’m going to get drunk regardless of you. At least this way I won’t have to pay for my drinks.” She glared at her phone, “and this way I won’t be drinking alone. Oh, and since you’re not going to ask, my name is Amy.”

“Consider me at your service, Amy.”

.

They stumbled into his apartment a tangle of clumsy limbs. Jackson walked Amy backwards to the couch. Her knees caught on the arm and she landed with her back on the cushions. He pulled his shirt over his head, dropped it, and climbed on top of her. Her mouth found his. She giggled through the kiss and her breath was thick with the smell of vodka. Jackson grabbed a fistful of her hair to bring her attention back to him.

“So serious,” she slurred. She flung her arms around his neck and pulled his face towards hers. Her hand was on the waistband of his pants. She sank her teeth into his lip and pulled.

Jackson cried out and recoiled from her.

“Sorry,” she said, but her lips curled into an unapologetic smile.

Jackson tasted blood. He placed a palm flat on the center of her chest, pushed her onto her back, and dropped to his elbows on top of her.

“Olive,” he whispered into her neck. 

Amy stiffened beneath him. “Who?”

Jackson recognized his mistake. He pressed his forehead into the couch beside of her. “Fuck, Amy. I--”

“Get off.” Jackson rolled to the side and she sat up, clasping her shirt together in the front with a white-knuckled fist.

“Amy, I didn’t mean--” he pleaded, but her expression was unrelenting. “I’m drunk. I--”

“Yeah, and I’m not drunk enough,” she said. She was next to the door, staggering into her heels. She slid into her coat as she slammed the door behind her.

.

After his exam, Jackson collapsed onto his unmade bed, staring at his phone. He opened up the dropbox app and navigated to a file of flashcards labeled “First year, spring, exam two, to share.” He opened the spreadsheet and spent the better part of his afternoon changing one hundred and twenty-two of the five hundred and sixty five cards to have answers that were believable, but wrong. He attached it in an email to Amy Anderson.

“Amy. Sorry I was an ass. Here’s a file of flashcards that I made for the second exam of the spring of first year. I aced that one, and you will, too, if you decide to use them.” He read this over a few times before adding his phone number and “Text me sometime.”

78,"""The Perks of being a Wallflower""

I recently read the book and it hit me in a profound way--not because I directly relate to the protagonist, but because he reminded me of one of my friends in particular. Both my friend and the protagonist are painfully shy and have extreme difficulty in social situations; both, behind that shyness, are wonderful and interesting people that have a lot to offer the world. 

I think this book should be given to all students because the author does an excellent job at capturing how hard it is to be in that kind of situation. Even if someone has no problem making new friends, like me, they know someone who does or have seen someone walking alone in the halls or on campus. Reading this could give someone the courage to go to an event that they normally wouldn't, or it could prompt someone social to invite someone shy to go to an event with them. This could change someone's entire high school or college experience. ",2016-08-23 13:12:50+00:00,d6t68bm,1.0,t3_4z695p,1875.0,books

82,"This is my personal soapbox, and it has been for a few years now. In my opinion, higher education, as it stands in the USA, is deeply, *deeply* flawed. Classrooms are often run by dictators, not teachers. **Adult learners** are made to feel like children by the demeaning rules that are forced on them: two in excused absences and and you fail the course; in-class quizzes worth enough of your grade that you might fail the course if you miss enough of them; huge research assignments way outside the scope of the course; arbitrary grading of essays; failing more than half of the students in a class to ""weed them out,"" because ""you all can't become doctors."" Pulling ridiculously difficult exam questions from outside sources so that more students fail than pass. I could continue?

And why does this happen? Because the higher education system pumps out more doctorates than there are jobs. Once you become so specifically qualified, you can only research or teach. One of the most common ways to get funding for research is to be a teacher at a large university. So, here we are--students forced to endure the narcissistic regime of professors that don't want to be in front of a classroom anyway.

The inherent issue here is that being a professor isn't the top of the career pyramid. Instead, it is only a necessary stepping stone on the path to becoming an esteemed researcher or a politician in that particular field of study. It is corrupt, it is disturbing, and it is degrading to students. Students have *no* rights; they are entirely at the mercy of their professors and their school's administration. No one has our backs but us.

And you know what is even more twisted? We fund this perpetual narcissism. Without us, they don't have jobs. We're in a position of power, but if we use it the whole system could come crumbling down.

Instead, we endure it. We eat their stupid rules by the fistful so that we can get a degree in an oversaturated job market and can't get a job at Walmart because we're overqualified.

It is astounding, really.

107,"A lot of replies are hung up on ""financial reluctance"" when it is very apparent that you are aware of the costs of owning a dog and those costs are not a concern for you. You simply don't want the additional cost of a walker. I get that. A walker would probably quadruple your dog-related expenses.

I do feel like if you got a dog at this stage in your life, it would need to be a breed deliberately suited for apartment life. Here are some different options that might work for you:

* **The dog needs to be an adult.** Research shelters/rescues within a reasonable distance for you to travel to adopt a dog. Many rescues foster dogs and housebreak them. You could even find a dog already accustomed to your lifestyle. Put in applications and communicate with shelters exactly what you are looking for, they can match you with a dog appropriate for you. Be patient, look for dogs on allpaws.com and specify house trained to limit searches.

* **Big dog vs. little dog.** a lot of users on this sub are totally against wee-pad training. I absolutely agree if the dog in question is a larger dog. I feel that many people own mini/teacup/toy dogs and train them to a wee-pad just fine, and that is the primary method of potty for those animals. It works when the dog is small because the amount of waste is small. Keep in mind that a smaller dog trained to a wee-pad, an indoor grass-patch, or a doggy litter box (search these other options on Amazon) may be better suited for you at this time in your life. That is not to say a large dog won't work, though.

* **Consider a walker for the dog's transition and gradually fade out.** If you go the route of a larger dog that is not wee-pad trained, think about a temporary walker. It would be best for the dog if you and your partner could stagger some vacation days so that someone is with the dog round the clock the first couple of weeks. After that time, it might be best for the dog if you hire a walker for the next couple of weeks/a month after. Throughout the course of that month, the walker could at first come midday, and then gradually push back the walk towards the end of the day and eventually stop the walks altogether. It would be absolutely essential that the dog get a long walk/exercise in the morning and evening both.

.

I think that a dog for you is a possibility, but it needs to be a very specific dog and the coming months after getting the dog will need to be deliberate. Also, you will need to make up for days worked with extra love and attention on days off. I hope these ideas help!",2016-06-16 03:59:32+00:00,d4b66fz,1.0,t3_4o7nsm,47504.0,Dogtraining

113,"Everyone is saying to make your mundane tasks more meaningful, but many people (including myself and maybe you as well, OP) literally may not have enough time to dedicate in a day to both the things you would like to do and the things you have to do.

My suggestion: 

* Work/School: get it done early, fast, and without distraction. Work for a set length of time and take regular breaks. [See 50:10 or Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/get-started/). If you procrastinate work it invades and often ruins free time.

* Mundane Tasks: if your life is like mine, you don't have much time to spare for these. I think you're on the right track by trying to make them more enjoyable/streamline them. See /r/mealprepsunday to prepare bulk meals for yourself/family or consider crockpot meals (dump everything in, only the crockpot and plates to clean up after. Minimal time actually cooking). I would continue to listen to podcasts, music, etc when tidying up, walking/driving, showering and exercising. I would feel guilty allowing myself to *only* sit and listen to a podcast for an hour; combining these tasks makes the task more enjoyable and the podcast guilt free.",2016-05-14 11:13:26+00:00,d3552nl,1.0,t3_4iyahf,208170.0,minimalism

Even though they are complex, once you understand the basics of either game, the mechanisms are extremely fast paced and refreshing and the class systems are fun to tinker with and have a lot of depth.

Xenoblade is really slow to start off, and I set it aside for the time being for that very reason. That's not to say it is a bad game by any means. I will definitely pick it up again someday when I have a bit more patience for the lengthy ""tutorial/intro"" phase.

Instead of seeing this as a failure, try to look at it as an opportunity to do all of the things you couldn't do in college--free spirited learning. Try to teach yourself an artisan craft like leather working or pottery just for the hell of it--beautiful arts like that are dying out because we're being funneled into a higher education system that doesn't value them.

* JRPGs (Bravely default, Shin Megami Tensei IV, Fantasy Life, Fire Emblem Awakening)

* Resident Evil Revelations (since been remastered to PS3, though)

* Moon Chronicles 

* Dementium Remastered

240,"Hi, friend. I'm right there with you. All my life I've been funneled into becoming s Doctor. I'm two years into medical school and I'm fed up. I'm not fed up with the idea of becoming a Doctor, though, I'm fed up with disenchanted professors and paying 60k a year to teach myself from a textbook that costs a fraction of that.

Your dad may mean well, but I think he is misguided. Working a job and going to school are different monsters entirely. I worked at a pharmacy in undergrad and I LOVED it. There was real tangibility to working. You put in the hours and you get paid for them. Going to school offers no immediate reward; no short term gratification. In fact, YOU'RE paying someone else for the hours you put in. The longer I'm in school and the more debt that I accrue, the worse that tastes to me. Some say the grades are the reward but there's nothing physical about that, and doing well on something never made me happy. 

I can only offer you a little bit of advice: small steps towards a larger goal.

.

If you do want to stop going to university, what is your plan after? Maybe secure a small job before you withdraw to assure yourself that you do have a backup plan. See if you enjoy working, getting paid for your hours.

.

If you think you might be interested in continuing university, my suggestion is to just start. I'm aware how hard it is to open a book. There's even resentment there, I know. Just sit down and start. Set a timer for 30 minutes. After that, take a break for 30. Do something productive during your break: take a walk or a shower or tidy up your place a bit. After about 4 sets of this take an extended break to eat. Gradually work your way from 30:30 to 40:20 then 45:15 and maybe 50:10. Put away your phone, turn off the TV and only have your study material in front of you. Find a work:break schedule that works for you. 

Don't think too long about the entire amount of work that you have to get done. Set small goals, get as much done in the work timers as you can. Repeat the next day.

Most importantly, have a time that you are allowed to stop each day. My cut off time is 5:00 PM. After that, I can do what I want. If I ever extend beyond that, it's never for more than 20 minutes.

I hope that there is some help to be found in my ramblings. ",2016-01-25 12:28:11+00:00,czb577a,1.0,t3_42kzd3,2210.0,depression

As far as your strategy complaints go, I have a suggestion that you can try to liven things up a bit if you decide to jump back in: try switching between characters, throwing a specific familiar out, selecting a move, then switching to another character and repeat. This method keeps me on my toes the entire battle. I also destroy all bosses haha. Also, nearly every familiar has a branched final evolution, so you can plan out your party and each character's role. 

The joy of this game is in the environments, the music,  the collectibles, and the side quests. I was disappointed that the story and characters weren't as charming, but it was something that I gradually let go of. I hope you'll consider giving the game another go :) if it still doesn't turn out to be your thing, that's totally cool.",2016-01-22 20:13:31+00:00,cz85jcx,3.0,t1_cz84c8y,1707.0,JRPG

247,"FINALLY getting around to **Ni No Kuni.** The game has its flaws but I am not disappointed. Combat is quick paced and refreshing, the story is lighthearted and moves the game forward steadily, the environments are beautifully rendered and the art style is crisp and very reminiscent of Studio Ghibli. I am about 80% through the game. I'm unsure if I'm going to platinum at this point due to frustrations in farming alchemy materials--all of the other trophies seem readily attainable, though. I am excited to finish the main story and see what the postgame has to offer.

Some complaints that I have about the game that I dearly hope they address in the future:

* Clunky character switching during combat/getting stuck during a cool-down phase after a move leaves you unable to defend and has led to some sticky situations. For a game so focused on hopping from attack to defense, this creaky mechanic needs oiled.

* Esther is constantly running out of mana. I've had to set her to ""Do not use abilities"" just so that I can save her mana for when I really need it.

* Taming familiars is exhausting. There really needs to be some items (even if they are rare) that increase the chances of taming a familiar.

* Cut scenes of animations are few and far between. They were heavier in the beginning, but almost non existent in late to mid-game. Same for voice acting. 

*Swaine is wearing rags. Put some decent clothes on him.

Hopefully I will be able to finish the last chunk of the game, soon!",2016-01-22 17:36:12+00:00,cz7yr2z,1.0,t3_4252bi,23551.0,JRPG

To piggyback off of this comment: Once OP has played those, here are some solid options to follow up with:

* Bravely Default (The sequel arrives soon, and there is an awesome demo on the e-shop for free)

* Fantasy Life (difficult to explain, best to just watch a trailer haha)

* Rune Factory 4 (harvest moon + dungeons and combat)

* Yokai Watch (in the same vein as Pokemon)

* Fire Emblem: Awakening (A strategy RPG that can be difficult. The next installment comes out soon)

* Shin Megami Tensei IV (known for its difficulty, but has an excellent story and atmosphere)

* Xenoblade Chronicles 3D (New3DS Exclusive; also can be played on the Wii)

* **Zelda**: many categorize these at adventure games, as there is no real leveling involved, but they do have RPG elements. If OP hasn't played these we need to have another discussion!

257,"I'll throw my thoughts out there:

I prefer the XL for two main reasons.

Firstly, the larger screen. Some argue that it muddies the resolution, and though that is true to a point, the larger screen is easier on my eyes. When trying out the smaller unit, I found myself leaning in a squinting involuntarily. 

Secondly, it feels better in my hands. The regular n3DS cramps my hands and I cannot play for extended periods. Paired with an outer shell like the hori TPU and a circle pad extender, the XL is the most comfortable experience by far.

.

If the XL offered cover plates, it would be the perfect device. Unfortunately it does not. I'm not sure what the reason for that choice was. Some accessory manufacturers offer XL cases with designs, so you can look into those. I know hori makes a couple of Yokai TPU cases and PDP offers a pretty nice looking Zelda shell. I've seen more of these popping up lately, too. There are also many companies that recreate the regular n3DS cover plates into decals that fit the XL, so there's that option, too.

Hope that helps!

Since you love all things FF, you might consider looking in to **Bravely Default** on the 3DS. It is an INCREDIBLE game; and I would argue the definitive RPG experience on the 3DS. Some people complain about the late/midgame, but I don't think it puts too much of a damper on the GAME. The second installment of the series releases spring 2016!

Also, to unwind my day, I've been playing **Yokai Watch** on 3DS a bit. It has a very Pokemon-like vibe and is super lighthearted and fun. It might be something for you to check out :)

* **Xenoblade Chronicles X** on Wii U (massive FF XII-like experience), 

* **Dark Cloud** PS2 Classic for PS4 (Rogue-like dungeon crawler/world builder RPG. Incredible game)

* In the same vein: **Rogue Galaxy** PS2 Classic on PS4 (open world action RPG, futuristic space travel, a lot of fun.) 

* If you have an XBOX ONE: **Rise of the Tomb Raider** is getting some solid 9+/10 reviews. Sadly, I have not played it yet because I don't own the console, but I adored the first title of the reboot and it has some kick-ass female characters.

303,"Some new info about Linkle can be found in this old article :P

She is described as being sister-like and is described NOT to be Link's daughter, which got confused in translation. 

.

Finding out that she was in the original Wii U game and that she got scrapped brings up some points:

First, Nintendo deliberately chose to scrap her concept on the Wii U title.

Second, and with *equal intention*, they are bringing her back.

.

So what does that mean for us, as girl gamers? *We need to be in support of this active choice to include brand new female playable characters in longstanding Nintendo IP.*

Love or hate the name Linkle (and I hate it, though I'm trying to love it), there's no denying that Linkle's design is very tasteful. No, you don't have to buy the game, but we can all publicly gush over her on social media.

Maybe we can make Linkle playable in Zelda Wii U :) ",2015-11-13 10:53:16+00:00,cwyrpxb,1.0,t3_3snduk,447.0,GirlGamers

I feel like I'm faking it. 

I *shouldn't* be depressed, if depression weren't based on my physiology--my husband is wonderful and I love him dearly, I do well in my classes, I have two cats and a comfortable life--but the chemicals in my brain are imbalanced. They have been for years, since middle school probably. 

I'm in graduate school now and just accepted that I had depression last year. **I realized that I was faking it, but it wasn't depression that I was faking** and I reached out for help from my doctor to be put on medication.

It'll be hard for you to trust your therapist, especially if you've only recently come to this point together. Take it one step at a time and follow their guidance.

474,"Medical school is a huge time commitment, and residency even more so (to my understanding.) I was newly married in the fall and my husband works a full time job, but I feel that we had plenty of time together after work/school to allow our marriage to grow strong. 

I think, though, if we brought a child into that equation, my husband would have to cut back on work or quit all-together to make sure enough care and attention was given. I know lots of medical students with children, but all of their spouses are stay-at-home dads or moms. Also, something I've considered as a female medical student is *when* I am going to have a child. Being pregnant during rotations does not seem like fun! So, if you are a woman and go the Dr. route, timing of starting a family is a bit different and could be postponed for 4 years or so.

TLDR: being a parent in medical school is doable, you would just need a spouse that is willing to become a stay-at-home mom/dad. 

Oh! I also DONT work during school. It's entirely impossible. If someone in the world does work during, they are 1000x the person that I am haha. But I have picked up doing some odd jobs this summer between first and second year. ",2015-06-24 12:38:52+00:00,csgz89g,3.0,t1_csgsep2,25138.0,infj
