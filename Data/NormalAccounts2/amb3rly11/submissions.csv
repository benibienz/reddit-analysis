I love scifi and fantasy and I am not bored with the genre, I just feel like I'm missing out on other books in genres such as historical fiction, regular fiction, thriller, etc! 

I deeply enjoy character driven narrative and the art of storytelling. Competence of prose is also important, but is secondary to strong characters. Below are some of my favorites:

* Kingkiller Chronicles by Pat Rothfuss

* Girl With All the Gifts by M R Carey

* A Song of Ice and Fire by GRRM

* Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes

* Red Rising Trilogy by Pierce Brown

* Wool Omnibus by Hugh Howey

* Stardust by Neil Gaiman 

I also want to note that, even though I have tried several of Stephen King's books, I just don't resonate with his writing style, so no King recommendations please :)

**Edit: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write me out recommendations! I am adding these to my goodreads and I will report back to you once I've read some!**

She NEEDS to drink when the other dog drinks. Four or five dogs? She has to accompany them all to the water bowl. This is true even in cooler weather, so overheating from play isn't the cause. On a couple of occasions she's vomited because she drank so much water. 

My husband and I play bouncer to the communal water bowl to limit her intake, but she still manages to drink too much. When she's in the park alone she only takes a couple of drinks of water or drinks no water. She also only takes drinks as needed when at home, so I don't think this is signifying an underlying medical condition such as SIADH or Diabetes.

I'm kind of at a loss with this one. How can I teach my dog that she doesn't have to drink EVERY time someone else does.

She digs restlessly on the bed, digs at the carpet in the living room, and has even torn a hole in our sheets. I can't really find any info on how to get her to sleep without this behavior. She does fine napping in her crate throughout the day (she will NOT sleep in her crate at night, she wants to be in the bed with us; we tried to crate her a night for two weeks and she was starting to regress with daytime crating so we brought her to the bed and those issues resolved). She shows these frustrated behaviors in the living room before bed and once in bed.

I feel like my husband and I do a really good job of giving her enough exercise and mental stimulation. She gets a romp/fetch in the fenced in dog park off leash in the morning (alone) and the evening (with other trusted dogs); I do about four 10min training sessions with her a day and walk her every two hours or so to potty. I give her half of her food in a bowl and the other half in a kong toy to keep her busy. I have treats in a Gatorade bottle that she can roll around. 

Is this something she will grow out of? It's a little cute but she can be pretty obnoxious/shrill when it happens. I don't want this to be something that persists into her adulthood, so hopefully you guys can help me out.

You've been an invaluable resource to me in training my standard poodle puppy that I got a couple of weeks ago.

She's awesome at loose leash unless (a) she sees another human to greet or (b) when we start heading to the door she immediately flops to the ground and refuses to move. I'm not quite sure how to approach this since I used treats to convince my childhood dog to come in and she quickly learned to ask to go out as many times as possible so that she could get as many treats as possible and even learned how to pretend to go to the bathroom for treats.

Any pointers here are greatly appreciated!

I'm not saying that being a morning person really has anything to do with INFJ, but I wanted to express my love for the early mornings.

I woke up a 3AM today. No alarm. I just ended a grueling 3rd semester of medical school and the earlier I can wake up, the more productive I can be. My body is now used to the 3AM to 7PM rhythm that I'd been putting it through. I didn't fight waking up, And without a looming wall of information to study, I remembered why I love 3AM.

It is like everything's been covered in dust and hushed. Muffled. Pipes drip and central air kicks on and off and sleeping people take consistent breaths and my mind can wander wherever it wants, without much of the previous day's worry intruding. 3AM has no obligations. I can lay in bed and indulge in meandering thoughts. 

At least until 7AM, when most people wake up.

This is a desperate plea for advice. I am a second year medical student, and my life consists of studying and sitting in class for nearly all of my waking hours. 

I'm 23 years old and a lifelong migraine sufferer, but I only had a handful of triggers up to this point (onions, garlic, perfumes). My school provides an iPad with tuition for all of our schoolwork, but I don't think this itself is a trigger because I used one throughout the last two years of my undergrad without issue.

The first semester of my first year wasn't really a problem because I was in class less and had active labs more and I studied at a standing desk. Second semester it started to become a serious issue, and this year even more so. I consulted my neurologist and he said that I wasn't a good candidate for preventatives because my migraines were environmentally triggered. I take abortive meds but as we all know theres a limit to how many of those I can take. 

I'm now in class 8AM to 4 or 5PM most days, and when I get done I have a minimum of 5 hours of studying to do. When I get finished with class I am terrified to study because I either already have a migraine at that point or It never fails that studying triggers a migraine. This is creating a situation where I literally get panicked at the thought of studying or going to class because it is directly linked to the misery I am going to be experiencing as a result.

I am a good student and perform well, but the past few weeks I have studied very little (an hour or less a day) and I have missed multiple classes because of these migraines, and my exam in the next two weeks will be reflective of that.

My school has a very sophisticated lecture capture system and I can take advantage of that as an alternative to going to class. However, some professors still mandate attendance (at least two of my classes a day) and the school requires attendance for all graded activities (which are taken on iPad), so theres no way of really getting around that. This leaves me with mandated attendance in at least half of my classes a day.

TLDR: daily migraines caused by sitting in class all day are going to begin adversely impacting my grades.

My question to you: What rights do I have as a student for accommodations? I feel that If i could study at my standing desk all day in a well lit room the problem would resolve itself. How do I go about seeking these? For those of you with sedentary jobs, do you have any recommendation for things I can buy to make going to class more comfortable (cushions, back support, etc). What additional supplements do you take as preventatives? I would be grateful for any and all advice.

A bit of backstory: My husband and I have been researching dependable AWD crossovers, and decided on a rav4. We researched WHOLESALE trade value on his car and determined it to be around 5,000. (So this is not a question of trade value, but the actual MECHANICS of the trading process). We researched invoice price of a 2015 Rav4 XLE and made a walk away point of 25,500. Good to go, if all goes well we should end up somewhere around a 20,000 out the door price. Right?

We walk onto a dealership today that advertised a price of 25,700 for an XLE rav. **Mentioned the advertised price to the sales lady, she verified that the advertised price was accurate** We test drove and everything was going awesome.

We settle down for paperwork and she walks back and forth gathering papers and making us wait. My parents were with us to cosign. We were going to negotiate at 0% and at other rates to see what would give us the best out the door price. We were upfront with her about being educated buyers, knowing both the value of his car and the invoice of the rav4.

She offered 4500 for his car, which was pretty close to wholesale trade value that we'd calculated ourself, so my husband and I settled for that. 25,700-4500 = 21200, right?? We ALL AGREED on the 4500 trade.

The sales lady then says if we're doing a trade in, she can only work with us from MSRP. She says: 28,000-4500 = 23,500. **UM WHAT?** She knew about our intent to trade in his car HOURS ago, when we first walked on to the lot. **Is this an actual rule car dealerships have??** 

I told her no, they need to honor the advertised price and to subtract the trade value of the car from it. She said she couldn't do that. I mentioned that I also qualified for a $750 grad rebate from toyota also. She said if I did that, she would only be able to offer 2500 on the car. This leaves us at 28000 - 750 - 2500 = 24750. 

I was so baffled that I wasn't sure how to approach the negotiation from this point. I felt that she was blatantly trying to take advantage of what she percieved to be an oblivious, young, newly-wed couple. I had intended to buy this car at 25,700 - 4500 - 750 =20450 before taxes, etc and I explained this to her. She countered with 28,000 - 2500 - 750 = 24750... She refused to work with us and tried to explain that this is how ""wholesale trade"" worked and that we were expecing ""retail."" She told us to ""go sell the car ourself."" Clearly, we were expecting the wholesale 4500 that we agreed upon, and that being deducted from the rav's 25,500 advertised price. Not ""retail"" price for his car.

My husband and I eventually got up and walked away very frustrated and confused. My parents agreed that she was trying to pull a quick one on us. What exactly happened here? 

**TLDR** Shouldn't Car trade-in be taken off of the bottom dollar of the new car? I intend to buy a rav4 in the immediate future, and I want to make sure I 100% understand the trading process.
