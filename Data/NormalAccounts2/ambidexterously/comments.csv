21,"Thanks for the website. Definitely helpful. I think we're going to look at/buy paint this weekend. 

(I'm glad you're enjoying this. Makes me feel better about asking so many questions.)

Okay, so let's talk about sunroom trim. I ""highlighted"" [this](http://imgur.com/tLkY07B) picture of the sunroom. (I guess my dog never leaves that spot...) Do I paint everything I colored in? I assume that blue and red go together, as it's kind of the ""front"". I assume that I at least paint all the pink. If I painted everything that I highlighted, would the break at the bottom right, where the ""sunroom"" meets the main room baseboards look weird, going from black to wood?",2016-03-24 22:38:06+00:00,d1cdh5g,6,t1_d1bubr3,26137,DesignMyRoom
22,"The room faces south, so I guess there are no rules about color. That being said, I LOVE that Parma Grey 27. I think it goes with our couches/accents beautifully, and will really brighten up the room. It i a little expensive, though ($99/gallon), and it looks like I can't just pick it up at Home Depot on a whim. Are there any colors in the Behr/Valspar (or similar style) range that look similar/almost identical? Also, what sheen would you recommend for this room.

My wife's eyes also lit up when you mentioned painting the trim black. I wonder if we're brave enough to try it...

We're looking into ceiling lamps now that you mentioned it. I think a nice three-lamped fixture might actually fit better into our room than recessed lighting (plus, it's cheaper). We found [this](https://www.allmodern.com/Dolan-Designs-Monaco-3-Light-Semi-Flush-Mount-1885-09-1885-40-DDI3894.html) one, but it's got candelabra base bulbs, and is only 180 total watts (a quick online calculator says we need about 280 to light up the room). Know of anything that might fit in the room and would be a similar vein (not a dome...looking for something with arms, I think)?",2016-03-24 12:59:15+00:00,d1bovm4,4,t1_d1aknik,76533,DesignMyRoom
23,"Hmm. I get what you're saying about the lighting, but we're really not a fan of wall sconces. Our big problem with the room is lighting...it gets very dark in there at night, and we spend a majority of our time in that room. We want it bright and inviting, and I'm not sure if we can get there with wall sconces. 

The ceiling is only 7.5', so yes, it's low. It's a drop ceiling, and there may be room above it to raise it and replace with drywall, but it's hard to check. The tiles aren't removable, but we're having a contractor come and look soon anyway. 

It is a very tough space, but I'm not sure how we feel about a sofa in the sun room. We could always try it...maybe one of them fits in that area, but I'm not sure. The layout works for us now, though of course, there can always be better things.",2016-03-23 14:23:04+00:00,d1ah77y,2,t1_d1a2gu0,38312,DesignMyRoom
24,"Thanks for the art advice. I'm glad you get the HIMYM reference. It was a wedding gift for my wife.

I totally get the close-together look. When we repaint, it'll give us an opportunity to really lay everything out and make it work better.

Crayon heart...we're not really sure. We happened to have a nail or two there already, so we just put a few more up and dropped the heart there. We're open to moving pretty much everything around. The pawprints are just hanging out, too, but will hopefully find a place in the new room as well.

Looking at the art that we have, do you have a suggestion for a wall paint color?",2016-03-23 14:17:43+00:00,d1agzx0,2,t1_d1aez5w,3441,DesignMyRoom
25,"Hi! 

My wife and I are finally ready to redesign our main (11'x17') living room! When we moved in, it had (still has) ugly carpet, ugly greenish walls, and no overhead lighting (lots of natural light, though).

There are oak floors under the carpet, and we're getting those done in May. Before then, we're installing recessed lighting above, and want to paint the walls, look into area rugs, and probably wall-mount our TV and get a new, more ""adult"" under TV cabinet. 

I have some questions, though:

-With all the wood in the room (door, baseboard moulding, ""alcove"" as we call it, and window trim, what color should we aim for our floors? Should we stain to match maybe the door? Should we aim for light or dark? Should we just leave it as is, put a few coats of poly on it and be done with it?

-Hitching off of that...what can we do with the walls? We don't like the green as it is now. Were thinking maybe a neutral gray, but there are SO MANY shades! Anything that would tie the room together better?

Anything else that I'm not thinking of? This is a big project, but I  know we're going to love the room so much better when it's brighter and more ""modern"".

Thanks for all your help!",2016-03-22 22:49:26+00:00,d19r7vp,1,t3_4bjtx1,337,DesignMyRoom

34,"I've never been to any sort of trade show before, let alone NAB, but I'd say, from what I've seen, it's like ""NAB Lite"". There are a lot of vendors, most in the broadcast media realm. CDNs, Cloud Storage, Live Streaming Solutions, etc. It's also SATCONN, so a lot of satellite providers that I don't have any business being around. There's also the staples: Blackmagic, JVC, Canon, Atomos, B&amp;H, Adorama, Sony, Panasonic, etc. Lots of things to play with. Lots of people to talk to. 

Being in the corporate videography world, I find some of the seminars interesting as well. Tomorrow I'm very excited for an advertising and content trends workshop.

Overall, it's an interesting conference, and the price (free) can't be beat. I'm excited to see how it grows over the next few years now that the cat's out of the bag and they can sell it as NAB Show New York instead of pulling the cover off (literally) during the opening keynote session.",2015-11-12 02:59:47+00:00,cwxa9rp,2,t1_cwx1mj2,15152,videography
