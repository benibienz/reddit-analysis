It's budgeting season here at my office, and I'm looking to upgrade my editing computer. Currently, I have a pretty-well souped up Mid 2012 Mac Pro. 

&amp;nbsp;

* 2x2.4 GHz 6-Core Intel Xenon
* 64GB 1333 MHz DDR3 Ram
* ATI Radeon HD 5770 1024MB Graphics
* Apple 27-inch LED Cinema Display with an additional 18-inch monitor as well
* 5TB Internal RAID 5 Storage, plus (basically) unlimited storage on our server (more storage than I could possibly use in the coming years at our output level)

&amp;nbsp;

This computer definitely works, but it does slow down during some rendering projects, and when doing any complicated After Effects work. That, and every three years, everyone at my company gets new computers so...here we are.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm the only one at the company who runs MacOS, so that would be one reason to change operating systems, and I work in Adobe CC, so I don't believe any software I use is Mac-only. I'm comfortable with Mac or PC, so don't mind switching if I'll get more bang for my buck.

&amp;nbsp;

I know nothing about the current state of computers so I'm turning to you for help. Given a budget of $8000 (hard cap, and of course the company would appreciate if I came in under budget), what would you buy to have the best editing rig for at least the next 3-4 years? Mac Pro (trash can)? Surface Studio? Build my own? Can I repurpose any of my current hardware/peripherals?

Went to a dealership on Saturday and got a quote of $20,991 OTD for an automatic iSport hatchback with the preferred package.

Etching (going to try and remove this) - $299

I love the way the new car drives, and it has so many new features over what I currently have, but I just don't want to regret my decision.

Am I missing out on so much if I don't get the iTouring? It looks like the big differences are a moonroof and fog lights. I've never had a moonroof, so I doubt I'd miss it, and I rarely use the fog lights on my Subaru...are they important? Is there anything else I'm missing?

Same for the Preferred Equipment Package. Is it worth the price, and will I eventually regret it if I don't get it?

My wife and I are looking to buy two new cars to replace our current ones. We're looking to get:

* 2012 or newer Subaru Forester 
* 2014 or newer Mazda3 hatchback  

We're also looking to trade in our old cars. We have:

* 1999 Subaru Forester - 170,000 miles
* 2004 Subaru Forester - 130,000 miles

&amp;nbsp;

We know that we won't be able to get much for our trades, but are hoping to get at least a little bit out of them. I was thinking--as a negotiating tactic--of trying to use both trades together to get more than I would've gotten with one trade at a time. Does this sound plausible? If I did that, it would mean that I'd have to trade both cars into the same dealership, and I doubt I'll be able to find a dealership with both cars that we want. 

&amp;nbsp;

Assuming I went this route, which dealership do you think would offer me a better deal--try to trade both cars into a Mazda dealer, or try to trade both cars to a Subaru dealer? Any tactics for trading in two cars at once that you can share? Am I making the right decision trying to trade both cars in at the same time, as opposed to two separate trades?

I'm meeting someone this weekend to buy an approximately 1.5 year old GH4. He claims it's only been used a handful of times, and pictures make it look like it's in excellent condition. Package also includes a battery grip, extra batteries, and Metabones XL. I think I'm getting a great deal on it.

One of my concerns, though, is that he says it was purchased in Australia. After doing some research, it looks like there's no issue with 30-minute recording limit with that model, but does anyone here have first-hand knowledge on this? Any other quirks about an international version I should know about?

My wife and I currently drive a 1999 Subaru Forester with 180,000 miles, and a 2004 Subaru Forester with 140,000 miles. Both have minor mechanical issues, but are in decent working order. They're just both getting up there in both age and mileage, and it's time for a change. PLUS, we have our first child on the way, so want to make sure we're in the best possible position when he/she arrives.

Mileage-wise, I drive about 200 miles per week commuting, plus currently, we typically use my car for longer travel on the weekends, though that could change with two new cars. My wife puts on only about 50 miles/week commuting.

My wife would love to get another Forester. We love the cargo room and the way it handles in the winder (live in the northeast, so we can get some good snow here). I guess we could technically go new on that one, but a used 2012+ would probably also fit the bill.

As for me, I don't want/need a Forester, but want a good, relatively inexpensive family car, and trunk space is a plus. Again, I can go used or new, depending on how price works out. Currently I'm looking at a Ford Focus hatchback, Honda Civic, or Toyota Camry. I can also be convinced to go the hybrid route, save a bit on gas, etc. 

I don't know if we'll get anything on our trade-in for the old Foresters...maybe we will? 

We can afford a small (few thousand) down payment combined, but will definitely be taking on auto loans. We both have excellent credit. 

I guess what I'm looking for from this post is: 

-What year should we be looking at in a Forester? Should we go new over used/CPO?

-Any advice on a Ford Focus hatchback? I think it'd be a good family car with some nice trunk space. Again, any specific model year to look for? Or features?

-Anything else you think I should look at? Like I mentioned, Honda Civic, Toyota Camry have both come up. Any hybrids to investigate?

I'm a groomsman (technically a bridesman, since I'm on the bride's side, but whatever) in a wedding on October 1st of this year. The bride has put me in charge of helping with wardrobe. The wedding, however, isn't your traditional dress and tux/suit wedding. 

Here are a few samples from the bride's pinterest page: http://imgur.com/a/7O7VS

The bride will obviously be in a wedding dress. She wants her girls to all wear whatever grey dress they want. Style/shade of grey doesn't matter to her...whatever is comfortable. She wants her flowers to be multi-colored, similar to the final picture in that album.

What she needs help with is groom clothing and groomsmen attire.  The groom is very picky with what he wants to wear. He's got a unique style and personality, and wants to wear light colored khakis, a white shirt, some sort of tie, is open to a vest...maybe, and sandals. That's what he wants, and he's very adamant about not changing his mind, though colors could be modified.

For the groomsmen, the bride was thinking khaki pants, white shirts, and grey ties, to pseudo-match the bridesmaids. Would this work? Do grey and khaki go together? I had mentioned maybe changing the ties to match the flowers instead...maybe every guy could wear a different colored tie? I also mentioned possibly changing the khaki pants to grey pants.

The wedding is not on a beach or anything, but it's still a very relaxed vibe. I'll be around to answer any other questions you have about details, but I'm really curious to hear your thoughts on this casual-ish wedding.

I recently started working at a small non-profit (around 40 people) as the sole videographer. We are a membership organization (15,000+ members) and we deal with larger corporations often (think big banks/firms/companies) and have partnership/sponsorship deals with them. They pay us in exchange for being advertised to our membership base--they also provide member services at discounted rates.

My boss would like to start selling video sponsorship as part of the package, or as a stand-alone perk. Our videos don't get many views (currently we have nothing over 1,000 views), but the audience is very targeted. We would offer many packages: 5 second title card, 15-30 second end card, lower third logo, full corner watermark, etc. 

The question is: what do we charge? Does anyone have experience selling sponsorship to corporations? In doing research, it looks like a lot of these deals are based on views, but that may not work for us, as we get small views but with a targeted and interested audience. Any advice is much appreciated.
