425,"&gt; As long as you have 2 programs running on that .Net runtime, it saves space.

That's an oversimplification. The .NET framework 4.5 x64 can take up to 2GB to install ([source](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718&amp;e6b34bbe-475b-1abd-2c51-b5034bcdd6d2=True)). Let's just say x64 is around 900MB on disk. If I have 2 programs that ship their own libs that are ~35MB each -- a generous estimate -- that still won't save disk space if they use a common library and cut down to 3 MB, since 67MB &lt; 906MB.

Disk space is also not the point of shared libraries. The point is less time spent doing low-level work, and fewer bugs in common routines. For instance, if you want to use a btree to sort a `List&lt;string&gt;`, you can use `List.Sort` instead of rolling your own sorting routine and dealing with bugs.",2016-09-14 19:37:16+00:00,d7mtnnn,5.0,t1_d7mstsd,984.0,Windows10

Beyond that, I'd suggest just setting up an environment where you can tinker around. Linux or OpenBSD environments are great for that since they come loaded with language support, and the programs you run on them are largely open source so if you're interested in how a program works, you can find the source code online easily.

Beyond even that, some advice regarding contributions:

* Don't worry too much about contributing. Even a bug report is useful.

691,"Here in the US at least, the Places tab is technically an ""Instant Answer"" provided by a Yelp API.

If you do a network trace, you will see that the request for all Yelp assets are actually done by a request to DDG's server; your computer doesn't actually talk to Yelp directly.

Furthermore, it's trivial to make DDG think you're somewhere else in the world by using a proxy. This leads me to believe that it uses some form of IP =&gt; city lookup like GeoIP.

Put it all together and it happens like this:

1. You: DDG, show me search results for ""John Lewis""
2. DDG: Okay, looks like you're interested in a place, and it looks like your IP is coming from the UK.
3. DDG: Yelp, can you tell me anything about John Lewis in the UK?
4. Yelp: Here are the results, DDG.
5. DDG: User, here are the search results as well as what Yelp thinks of John Lewises in the UK.

Looking at the installer script, it looks like it--among other configs--appends a udev rule:

    echo 'ACTION==""add"", SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", ATTR{idVendor}==""17e9"", ATTR{bNumInterfaces}==""*5"", GROUP=""plugdev"", MODE=""0660""' &gt; /etc/udev/rules.d/99-displaylink.rules

But then, he never claimed not to be a god.  Circumstances being what they were, neither admission could be of any benefit. Silence, though, could.  It was in the days of the rains that their prayers went up, not from the fingering of knotted prayer cords or the spinning of prayer wheels, but from the great pray-machine in the monastery of Ratri, goddess of the Night.  The high-frequency prayers were directed upward through the atmosphere and out beyond it, passing into that golden cloud called the Bridge of the Gods, which circles the entire world, is seen as a bronze rainbow at night and is the place where the red sun becomes orange at midday. Some of the monks doubted the orthodoxy of this prayer technique...

1416,"Part of SSL certificates' security is providing some confidence that the server you're connecting to is actually what the server's certificate claims it is. The server's DNS name is encoded into the SSL certificate in a way that can't be changed. This is to essentially ensure stolen certificates can't be used on a different server.

For example if you connect to yahoo.com and its SSL certificate says ""For use with google.com"" the browser throws an error.

If you go to yahoo.com and the cert says ""For use with google.com, yahoo.com, and bing.com"" it won't (and shouldn't) throw an error because yahoo.com **is** on the approved list of DNS names.

The crux of the problem with riseup.net's SSL certificate is that it (I'm guessing) identifies itself as ""For use with riseup.net, and mail.riseup.net"" and doesn't give any mention of the .onion address. Even though the .onion address might resolve to the exact same IP address as the mail server, the DNS name used to get there isn't encoded into the SSL cert.",2015-08-29 19:03:47+00:00,cujyuuk,3.0,t1_cujy9bq,1151.0,commandline

**Insecure answer:** Add the server's certificate to the list of certificates mutt implicitly trusts.

If you add this to your ~/.mutt/muttrc file, it'll set up a common place where mutt will save certificates that are on the ""approved"" list.

    # where to save SSL certificates (for (imaps|pops):// connections)
    set certificate_file=~/.mutt/certificates

You might have to run `touch ~/.mutt/certificates` to make mutt start using it.

The reason many shell multiplexers hijack this is because setting the window title on an xterm with multiple shells is probably not what you want - if you set the title to say ""ssh@devmachine"" and switch back to your local machine, the window would still say ""ssh@devmachine"" or whatever set the window title last.",2015-07-07 14:45:07+00:00,csuzydi,1.0,t3_3cezd2,10571.0,commandline
