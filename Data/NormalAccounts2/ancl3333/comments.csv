38,"The first time I played I struggled a lot. The 2nd play through I think I lost two game the entire time (and played every merchant and gwent quest). The key is spies, medics, decoys, biting frost and more spies. It doesn't matter if the spy gives them 9 or the medic gives you 0. Play spies, wait for them to decoy and play them, then decoy them your self and play again. If you're out of decoys just use medics (or Nilfgaards special ability to revive from enemy deck) and play more spies. I have 3 biting frosts in my deck. By the time you've used all the spies the enemy will most likely of passed and used half their cards (If they have a big lead they will pass - which they will as you played spies). Then you use biting frost, play one or two cards and win. I normally finish games with around 6-8 cards in my hand. It gets to a point where gwent isn't fun as you know you will win every round and every game.",2016-07-29 09:41:05+00:00,d5voxzm,2.0,t1_d5ulzsr,62180.0,witcher
39,"Definitely agree that the item progression and 'loot' in general was one of the bigger weak points in this game. I've never obtained a single piece of Witcher gear. It's just not worth the trouble IMO, even obtaining any other special weapon or investing in runes are not worth it. You seem to find a better sword every quest. The weapon stats scale with level as you find them (I think) so seeking out particular relic or named swords is pointless. There are many times where a simple 'Novigrad Longsword' will have better stats your fancy sword. The loot system is probably the worst part of the game so I wouldn't try and base a run through on it.

44,"I think it was like $30 for a year when I bought it but definitely well worth it if you buy from them several times. When I refer to ASOS I'm mostly talking about the ASOS branded clothes.

Welcome the nightmare of cheap plain t shirts in Australia. You can get the Uniqlo packaged tees for like $8 which is why I like them the most and they are okay quality but pretty of thin. I normally wear them most under a jacket or jumper. I believe the best value tees we can get are the AS color staple tees. They are about $20 each on their website, but you can buy a 4-pack from culture kings for $50. I'd recommend going for the 4-pack given your situation but check your sizing on the AS color website.

ASOS can be amazing but there is definitely some variance in quality between different pieces of the same item (So don't be discouraged if you get a weird fitting item, just send it back). With the premier service I normally order 2 or 3 of the same item and send back the dodgy ones.

98,"People on here are not giving great advice. If you want to pk at cb 35-40 you'll be around 60 range. So probably will be using dbow as spec/ko weapon (or even mbow (i) if you're cheap) or just a rune cbow. Don't get prayer as it's a waste of cb levels. No pures around 35-45 have prayer. You could use mbow as main weapon but rune knives will be more effective. 

IMO training cannon is not worth it unless doing slayer. At 35-45 there will be a heap of obby maulers that will pretty much be 1 hitting you if you have low hp. If you do train magic though do it without hp to balance out your range hp.

Be sure to explore other pure types. Range pures can work and a good place to start but you can also build it into a gmauler  or something else more fun/effective. Just be careful of not getting your range too high if you don't want to spend too much time training melee.

As for training, if you have no gp then chaos druids will probably be your best bet. If just want fastest xp then rock crabs.

My main tip is just go looting on W318 for a while. Earn some starting gp and look at the other pures and there stats to see what works.",2016-06-07 15:40:50+00:00,d3zjwri,1.0,t3_4myczo,19100.0,2007scape

Most people will say the wiser choice would be to study mechanical or chemical if you're looking into O&amp;G, especially in this climate. O&amp;G companies hire many Mech and Chem engineers along with Petroleum engineers for the same roles. Although the different disiplines seem to overlap quite a bit when it comes to O&amp;G, in general Mech guys tend to be more upstream and Chem downstream.

From a different perspective you could argue that the 'radicals' are just the ones following the religion the way it was intended and the non radicals are just picking and choosing what they like. From that perspective religion is the major factor. While there are obviously other factors and there will always be violence, do you really think that with out religion groups like these would still amass the same size of followings and carry out their attacks with the same conviction? People are always using the argument that ""people are always going to be violent"", that's really not true. People will be violent when they have something they believe is worth fighting for and that's exactly what religions provide. 

I don't think the answer is educating people to become less radical religious people, but to educate people to not become religious at all. If religion exists there will be people who read the passages you pointed out and as they've been taught to follow the religion they will do what the text says.",2015-11-16 04:25:25+00:00,cx1qqcw,10.0,t1_cx0yqjb,46446.0,videos

241,"I guess there is just a difference in mindset here. For me I find no benefit in killing bots for aim prac (in this setting). People play DM to practice their aim against real people and in my view having any bots in the server takes away from that. Maybe other people value having a full server more than having an opponent that is actually worth practicing against, but I don't. 

I get that the main point of bots is so you have something to do while the server fills up, but a lot of the time the server won't fill up quickly enough and people will just leave as they don't want to play with bots - which makes the idea redundant when their whole purpose was to help fill the server. If there were no bots, people would stick around longer as playing low pop DM can be fun in it's own way and allowing to server to fill up.
