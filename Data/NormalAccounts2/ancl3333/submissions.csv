Went to train at chaos druids which I've been doing for a while to find that every world has a bot wearing the exact same thing with the exact same stats.

How is it possible for so many bots to get these levels without being banned? How is that after 15 years Jagex still cannot do anything against bots, go to catherby and you will see many fishing bots nearing 99.

Just remembered why I stopped playing.

I was playing on a GBA emulator when I started to get screen tearing across the screen. Even when I exited the app I still had some screen tearing for several minutes on the home screen. Went back into the game and played for about 15 more minutes with no problems.

Has anyone else had this problem and know of the cause (is it zenfone 2 hardware related or app/android related) or any fixes? 

Thanks.
