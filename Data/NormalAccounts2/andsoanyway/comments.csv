3537,"Let me first start by saying that I enjoyed it a lot. Depp was killer and so was Edgerton. That being said I feel like they left a lot of things out that would've also made for good scenes that would have fit the movie and shown Whitey's power and how the ""alliance"" truly was shifted in Whitey's favor. (I read the book.) Some of the characters were skewed and not so much true to the book (but favored to move the movie along so I forgive it). For example, I dont know why they portrayed Stevie ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi as such a downtrodden character. He was Whitey's number 2 and had a reputation as a killer. (Also he's the one that suggests killing his step-daughter, dont know why they made it seem like he didnt want to.) This next one is just a little gripe but Kevin Weeks doesnt really come into play till the 80s but thats beside the point. John Morris' character was waaaaaaaaaay more into it than they showed in the movie. He took money and gifts from Bulger and held dinners at his house as well. I feel like they could've made more of a statement with how both the Johns pumped up the info that Whitey gave them (or didn't give them). Or how they helped thwart several investigations into the Winter Hill Gang. Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan plays a bigger role in the book, actually plays quite a big role but for some reason is only in the movie for that offhand scene; for pacing reasons no doubt (the director has said that the original runtime was closer to 3 hours, so here's to hoping for a directors cut!). They left out Whitey's girlfriend, Catherine Greig, but from what I understand Sienna Miller's scenes were cut. 

All in all I liked it a lot and understand some of the reasons they made the choices they did but feel as though they couldve fleshed out the book in maybe a miniseries or something to that effect. I will be buying the BluRay tho, thats for sure.  Johnny Depp was chilling and several scenes were suuuuper uncomfortable.. in a good way. Many times Depp was unsettling with his stare and mannerisms. Overall, the acting and directing and script was great.
