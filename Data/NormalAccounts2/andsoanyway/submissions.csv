THROWING STATS:
he made every throw that was mid and short for me no problem but the deep ball he struggled in. if the reciever was way downfield he would end up throwing it yards short so youd have to click on and come back for it. the 98 throw power is godly too since he can zip it in quickly.

his throw on the run is amazing too. its almost like he throws better on the run tbh.

all in all is he worth a million coins? FUCK NO YOU JABRONI, max he is worth what UF cunningham is going for which is around 400-450k.
