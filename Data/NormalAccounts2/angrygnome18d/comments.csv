0,True. But that is showing how skilled Vegetto is. Despite using so much ki he is able to concentrate and control most of it onto Zamasu forcing him to use his own ki to defend himself. ,2016-11-21 02:20:06+00:00,da8z6fl,3.0,t1_da8ylej,840.0,dbz

Why would Vegetto use a full powered attack that could destroy the world that he's trying to protect and not control it?

12,"I get your point and I agree, but I disagree on the methodology. Vegeta had a clear advantage on Black until he began to bring forth those duplicates. When he did, Vegeta and Goku were unable to destroy them fast enough to get to Zamasu or Black, but I believe that if at that point Vegeta had been able to bypass the clones and fight Black, he would have still  controlled the pace of the fight as he was doing before. I say that because if Black had indeed become stronger than Vegeta, I think he would have engaged Vegeta himself as he had done before. Instead, Black chose to use his abilities to get them to raise their power. I say that because it has been shown since Black had appeared that his Saiyan body is indeed influencing him, causing him to fight more and enjoy it. On more than one occasion Black has said that he enjoys fighting, once Goku said that he and Black shared an enjoyment for battle and Black said it himself when Zamasu claimed Goku was his kill, Black said his body desired it and that he needed to do it. All this to say Black would not shy away from a good fight unless he couldn't win, and I think he recognized that Vegeta and Goku could indeed use their Saiyan bodies to power up more than the Gods.",2016-11-19 00:54:48+00:00,da6fdis,7.0,t1_da67rgu,11537.0,dbz

I think it's safe to say Vegeta had weakened Black quite a bit to where he had to pull out some random abilities to get out of the epic beat down. Further, Vegeta and Trunks' beam attack no doubt took a lot of stamina from all of those involved. All the while Goku had been holding off Zamasu, who was by far the weakest of anyone there. I'd say the order of raw power goes Vegeta&gt;Black&gt;=Goku. However, when you take into account abilities (Black's creation abilities) the order would be Black&gt;&gt;&gt;Vegeta=Goku.

15,"Vegetto would not defeat Beerus. Whis himself stated to the Oracle Fish that Goku and Vegeta are nothing compared to Beerus. He does tell Goku and Vegeta that if they were to fight together they might be able to take Lord Beerus, but I suspect he said this to motivate them as he was genuinely surprised and excited by their progress. Additionally, when Goku went SSBKKx10 against Hit he was at his most powerful and he matched evenly with Hit who was holding back. This means Hit is at least as strong as Goku SSBKKx10. We later see Champa upset at his team and prepares to destroy them all and we see Hit is visibly terrified, as is Cabba and the rest of the team, and Champa was said by Vados to be weaker than Beerus. I'd say Beerus would have a lot of fun with Vegetto, but unless Vegetto went SSBKKx10, I don't think he'd have any chance of beating Lord Beerus. Even consider the fact that Black and Zamasu did not dare challenge him and instead killed the Kaioshin and they had the option of fusing. Bear in mind Zamasu was a Kaio, not even a Kaioshin (didn't finish his training with Gowasu). He then fused with Black, a Saiyan with a Kaio heart. Lord Beerus is a true Hakaishin. There is no way even Merged Zamasu was near Beerus' true strength and further I think Vegetto would have the fight of his life against Lord Beerus.

No matter what the species, characters often gain power through anger, particularly Saiyans and humans. Trunks', being a hybrid of the two, already has immense potential. Combine that potential with the strength of his emotion at the time and he was able to unlock great power. I suppose some people might think that is dumb, but that's the story, that traumatic experiences and great struggle forge us into the people we are. We learn, grow, and gain strength from struggle and Trunks' transformation is a representation of that. He has been fighting Black for over a year after growing up in a wasteland ravaged by Androids. Those closest to him have been killed and everything he's fought for is about to be lost. Worst of all, he's seen what his life could have been, what his mother would have been like had there not been genocidal maniacs tearing up the world. He was finally able to meet his father, live with him, grow with him, come to understand him. He's seen his master find love, happiness, and joy rather than have to fight day in and day out for survival.

54,"Interesting perspective, though I suppose my response would be that is the exact reason for setups, which I think is the same as map control. For example, in Halo 3 on the Pit a setup would consist of something like sniper on tower, one guy sword room, one guy rotating between green/rocket hall and sword bridge, and one guy rotating between green hall and long hall. Now rockets would respawn every 3 minutes and overshield, if I'm not mistaken, 2 minutes (sniper was 2:30). The point was to hold your ground and pick kills until the rockets or overshield would respawn and then make a push on the enemy team. With that advantage you can push out from sword, control their tower, push in from sword bridge, plat, and flag to force them to spawn at mauler and needler. Once they did, you control the tower and force them to push in through long hall and green hall where they'd get hit by a team member on the other side with sniper support. In Halo 5 the maps are bigger so the areas of control are a bit bigger but i believe the same concepts should apply. Or is there something I'm not seeing? For example on Truth, wait for invis and fuel rod to make a push for a flag cap. The point in either scenario is map control until the power ups/weapons are ready to be used. Otherwise the only advantage you have is territory and in that regard you want to be aggressive and maintain a flow, control the pace of the game. I think a lot of players also don't realize that if you get 3 pistol shots on a guy that is usually good enough. At that point they're out of the fight, they need to hide to regain shield, meaning it becomes a 4 vs 3. With proper map control you can get the right angles in the right spots to turn it into a 4v2 and so on and so forth. ",2016-10-23 23:23:07+00:00,d94vkyi,2.0,t1_d94ttb9,2616.0,halo

In regards to Frieza and Vegetto, I understand that people hype him up a lot, deservedly so, but bear in mind that who Vegetto is made up from, Goku and Vegeta, are still only Saiyans. Now I'm not trying to imply they are weak or anything, but again, look at Goku's jump from Raditz to SSJ which was a relatively short time, a matter of weeks. Frieza, again, had a PL (just to try and give a quantifiable measure) of 120 million and knew so little about the usage of ki that he didn't even know how to sense it, so his combat training was purely instinctual and natural talent. Additionally, the fact that he unlocked a transformation of his own that rivals SSJ does provide an adequate explanation of how he was able to get so strong so fast (Goku did, relatively, the same thing in early DBZ and even mid to end DBZ). But can you explain further about what rules of early DB it broke? I'll admit, DB is the DB series I'm least familiar with. ",2016-10-22 16:02:00+00:00,d934mjw,2.0,t1_d9313yg,6371.0,dbz

106,"This is a great post and the right answer. I think one of the strongest points is that when Beerus saw Goku in base the first time, he was surprised that Goku could have defeated Frieza. Fast forward to when Goku fought Frieza after Frieza had trained, Goku in base was able to keep up with and even have a slight edge against Final Form Frieza. His base has increased greatly and SSB compounds that increase in base power. 

This next part is my own theory. I think the suggestion with Golden Frieza was that SSB is not as crazy of a multiplier as SSJ. I say this because Frieza went with gold to prove a point, that his form was superior. As such, I think it was meant to be a direct comparison to SSJ. SSB, on the other hand, is a much more calm and controlled transformation than SSJ. So considering Frieza and Goku were about even in base and Golden Frieza had the initial edge, but lost it as time went on, I believe that the fight was meant to show that precision and control are more important than raw power and destructive capability. All that to show just how far Goku has come in his training and from experience.

109,"Honestly, thanks for asking, I love talking about DB/Z/S. 

I think, using the Super Dragon Balls, Zamasu will wish for a copy of Goku's body in addition to immortality, but I think he'll want to fuse some of his Ki with Goku's, which is why they're not the same, but rather kindred spirits. Black does seem to have characteristics of Goku and Zamasu, even his style of fighting is a mix of the two, he's using the knife hand technique, a la Zamasu, while still trying to milk the fight for enjoyment, a la Goku. Black could even be the result of a wish wherein Zamasu wished for a Saiyan God, that way Black would have his own unique transformation (rose). 

All of this is to say, honestly, I'm no where near sure about this theory nor do I know the specifics, but I feel like they've been laying down the groundwork for something like this. 

/u/got_lost_again the only reason why I do not think he's a Hakaishin, which I considered as well, is due to the fact that he can use the time ring, as Beerus, Whis, and Gowasu said only Kaioshin can use the time ring, so if anything, I think he's a Kaioshin. Although I wonder if one can be both, a Hakaishin and a Kaioshin? Also I wonder why he had a time ring in the first place? Quite odd.

205,"I disagree with a lot of people here. Broly certainly is highly skilled, bear in mind he was restricted by Paragus and so he was unable to transform fully for quite awhile so all of his fights for awhile were either in base form or restricted SSJ (purple hair form). When Broly was finally released he quickly transformed into LSSJ and SSJ in the second movie. Broly's ability to transform and maintain SSJ after years of being trapped in a small ship is a testament to his natural talents, however, he is not as skilled as Vegeta or Goku. Goku was raised by martial artists ranging from Grandpa Gohan to Master Roshi to King Kai to Whis, Goku has learned from literally the best. Vegeta, while not having as many teachers as Goku, still learned from King Vegeta, Nappa, Whis, and has a ton of personal battle experience. Broly, on the other hand, is a fighting prodigy, above even Goku. His abilities are innate and his skill, were he to be taught and mentored, could arguably surpass Goku, Vegeta, and any other Saiyan or half breed. However, Broly was never taught and thus learned everything he knew from actual combat and therefore never lived up to his possible potential. IMO if Broly had been switched with Goku (sent to earth, hit his head, etc) he would have had no problems with any opponent up until Babidi and Buu showed up and even then, with a bit of training from King Kai, would have made short work of Buu.

The thing is SSJ3 is a lot more draining and taxing on the body than SSJ so SSJ3 is not as efficient, but certainly is more powerful than SSJ. The reason why they don't ascend to SSB2 or 3 is for that same reason, efficiency. Goku himself stated he couldn't hold SSB for too much longer in his fight with Hit which means it takes up quite a bit of stamina. Going SSB2 or 3 might give a huge boost in power, but it would be only for a fraction of the time Goku and Vegeta can hold SSB. My own personal theory is Gohan and the other hybrids might be able to ascend to SSB2 seeing as how they are naturally gifted prodigies, but they would have to train as intensely as Goku and Vegeta.

217,"I wouldn't say it ended in DBZ. In DBS, after undergoing the SSG ritual, Goku was able to harness the power of God Ki to which Beerus stated Goku was indeed a rare prodigy. Additionally, Vegeta himself was a prodigy, surpassing his father, the King of Saiyans, as a child. In regards to those techniques, I'm positive that Goku can replicate those attacks you listed but he doesn't because they don't fit his style, as he said to Perfect Cell; simply mimicking a technique isn't enough to be good at utilizing it. Lastly, in regards to Hit's abilities and Goku's counter, that absolutely is impressive. In DB characters were FTE and had intricate fights within the blink of an eye. Goku is far more powerful and far faster than he ever was, and Hit's technique of skipping .1 seconds is a huge amount of time in DBS. Goku's counter was impressive not just for the amount of time that was being skipped, but Goku also analyzed and predicted the way Hit would fight simply based on his stance. And bear in mind everyone in DB is able to utilize Ki, even humans. It took Master Roshi, literally the best human martial artist, 50 years to master the Kamehameha. Goku learned the Kamehameha by just watching Roshi. Goku is of a warrior race, fighting/martial arts/ki comes naturally to them. To say Goku isn't a genius, especially by earth standards is just plain wrong. Even to say Goku isn't a fighting genius by Saiyan standards is blatantly false. Vegeta, the most powerful warrior within a warrior race admitted Goku is simply better.

303,"Agreed with points 1 and 3. The threat will reveal itself. For now, I'm just enjoying having new Dragon Ball content. Vegeta has been doing so well and his character has grown so much. He actually did better than Goku in the tournament. The only reason why Goku is doing well now is due to the King and Jaco. Without them, Goku would've gotten his ass beat same as Vegeta. Hell, Vegeta might've even done better than Goku is now. He's shown in DBS he doesn't mess around. 

About point 2, the muscles. It's true fighters don't have to be jacked, but then again McGregor is a fairly lean 170 at what, like 5'8? 5'9? Jon Jones is what, 6'1 or 2 and 205 and pretty lean. Compared to the average guy they are large, well proportioned dudes. Why? Because they train, as does Goku. I get that Goku's power doesn't come directly from his muscles, but his muscles are far more powerful than any human. The dude did 50,000 1 finger handstand push-ups in a weighted suit in excess of 300x gravity. Their bodies should reflect that. And as other people have said as well, this is a cartoon show. This isn't real life. It just looks cooler, same reason why people loved Brock Lesnar, though I don't think Gokh should be drawn that large, just more like his Buu Saga self. His look in the final fight vs Kid Buu was the best drawn and animated Goku IMO. That's the look Super should try and bring back. That level of detail, choreography, colors, everything was fantastic.

There are many things that they naturally master from a young age, such as the ordinarily arduous transformation into a Super Saiyan.

People should realize Goku was raised a mountainous farm boy so rather than being dumb or stupid he's just simple. He likes to live a simple life, that's not idiotic and is in many ways an amiable endeavor. I'm sure if you showed Goku how to play chess and related it to fighting/strategy/tactics Goku would do well. He's good at reading his opponent and feeling them out. I'm sure he could get a good read on Superman and his personality type and if not win, give Supes a run for his money. In fact, Goku might end up enjoying chess quite a bit.

If the objective of A and B is to produce the most of Y and Z then if A is better at producing Y and B is better at producing Z, A will produce Y while B will produce Z. The reason? A and B can simply trade Y and Z as demands need. A and B can still spend time/resources producing the other product, but for optimal production an entity would spend most of its time/resources producing what it is comparatively better at. This is simplifying it a lot but married couples are essentially specializing, which is economically sound. ",2015-10-21 04:39:32+00:00,cw7ao95,8.0,t1_cw74t7i,10778.0,science

I don't understand why people assume Goku has bad fighting technique when in the DB universe, Ki and much of the other techniques Goku utilizes are an extension of martial arts. Simple punching and kicking is not that difficult to master, but knowing how to utilize different techniques the way Goku does is. Even if people make the argument Goku is a Saiyan so he's stronger, it doesn't necessarily make sense since the writer did not even know he was a Saiyan until DBZ came about. Goku is just an incredible fighting prodigy, and that extends to being able to see techniques once and use them. Master Roshi, a master martial artist spent 50 years learning how to gather his Ki to make the Kamehameha, Goku learned it after seeing Roshi do it once. That's not just strength, that's being a genius. What you're saying is like saying Mozart wasn't necessarily a great composer because he didn't have formal training.

595,"No they wouldn't just as any male wouldn't. Any more than a 2v1 fight would favor the numbers side heavily despite training unless you're talking about people trained in fighting styles such as Krav Maga. What Rousey is trained in is sport martial arts, meant to hurt others but not in the same way as more modern styles like Krav Maga which is, by design, meant to take out people as fast as possible. Additionally, men tend to have more muscle at similar weight than females, and while I know skill is meant to be used on people who are bigger and stronger, if two 165lb guys thought tactically and attacked Rousey at the same time she'd fall to at least one giving the other a chance to jump in and finish her off. If she knew something like Krav Maga and was an expert in it then I could see her fighting maybe, and that's a big maybe, 2 guys and winning, anymore than that and I'd give the group the better odds. A male similarly trained, in Krav Maga, might be able to take on 3 guys and win but it'd be a Pyrrhic victory. There's an article where I believe 4 Pakistani SSG (Special Forces) soldiers were captured in a clandestine operation by the Taliban. Their weapons and equipment were taken away, not that they had much to take away, and were set to be executed. The 4 of them waited for the opportune moment and then attacked their captors killing 8 of them, wounding a couple more, but were eventually killed.

When Goku fought Buu as SSJ3 is sapped his power fast and he was unable to gauge how much power he had left and how much was required to destroy Buu. Compare that to his fight with Cell, where Goku was not necessarily strained at all and did not run out of ki, but was able to hang with Cell through the entirety of their fight. SSJ is a multiplier of power, so Goku's theory on fighting now is to get his base as powerful as possible so he only needs to ascend to SSJ to fight more powerful opponents, rather than having to resort to SSJ2 or SSJ3 which would be his last resorts if you will. It makes sense when you think about it, especially considering how the ascended SSJ forms were each shown to have some sort of inherent fault with SSJ being the most reliable out of all the transformations.
