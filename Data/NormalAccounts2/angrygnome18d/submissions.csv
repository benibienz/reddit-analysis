1,2016-10-23 19:20:29+00:00,self.halo,https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/5907jn/multiplayer_tips/,False,"I created this thread to give some basic tips that I've learned from playing Halo for over ten years. Some of them might seem obvious, but then it would seem that people tend to ignore the  obvious. From what I've noticed, most people, of course, want to just get kills in halo rather than win the game, however, they fail to realize that by winning you'll end up getting more kills. Now how to win? I see players often times running around, seemingly randomly, in an attempt to find anyone they can to kill. This is horrible and will only frustrate you as at best you'll go 1 for 1 against anyone who knows what they're doing. 


Now I'm not familiar with the strategies for these Halo 5 maps as I haven't watched competitive Halo in awhile, but in Halo 3 I was a 50 in MLG and in Reach I ranked around 1800 onyx on average. This is to say that I know the basic mechanics from Halo that has been passed over and that will still help you win today.

So the first point is a set up, every map is made to have a setup. Since I played a lot of Halo 3 I'll talk about Truth as its a Midship/Zealoy remake. The basic setup for this map, as I see it in Halo 5, is to hold Pink Tower. If you hold Pink Tower you have direct control over camo (which spawns every 2 minutes) as well as top middle from where, if you have one guy, he can put shots on anyone. Now here is the setup I feel would work best for Truth, one guy Pink 3 (top Pink Tower), one guy P2, one guy top Mid, and one guy to hold off Carbine side. 

Now that we've established a setup, let's get into spawns and the spawn system. Let's say we are playing capture the flag on Truth and we have the setup above established, how do we go about capturing the flag? Well it needs to be a concentrated, cooperative effort. The way the spawns seem to work in Halo 5 is to spawn you nearby a teammate, so your positioning affects where your team res pawns. Now this has some pretty big implications, if you stay in a shitty position, your team will continue to spawn in that shitty location. Therefore, you need to be in a good place consistently to give your team the upper hand. How does this apply to flag caps? Well this applies to the enemy team as well. Spawns can be blocked by tossing grenades and being in that general vicinity. For example, if you begin to throw grenades at bottom red base, the enemy will not spawn there. This means you can dictate the location of he enemy teams spawns. This has huge applications to flag caps. In our example, we should wait for the enemy team to be at least 3 down when we begin our flag grab. Once there are three down, one player should push flag while the other players give him cover and attempt to force the enemy team to spawn on the opposite side of where we are to run the flag. In my opinion, flag should be run on pink side as it provides the most cover and will give the best opportunity for a cap (unless you're a pro and can go top mid for a quick cap), therefore, once your team begins to run the flag pink side, the team should begin to toss grenades to top and bottom base so the enemy team spawns at carbine, opposite of pink tower and boom, flag captured. Then begin to fight for control again, rinse and repeat. 

It is easier said than done, but hopefully if people are aware of information like this they can learn to cooperate a bit better and have funner, more competitive games. Lastly, please use your mics or at least try to play as a team. It really can make all the difference. 

Have fun out there guys. ",halo,Multiplayer Tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/5907jn/multiplayer_tips/

Let me begin with Goku. Goku has always had to work for his strength, training with martial arts masters, gods, and whatever the hell Popo is. Through Goku's intense training, he was able to unlock absurd amounts of power. In the time it took Goku to go from Earth to Namek his strength increased tenfold. When he was on Namek, Goku's power increased even further, ramping up to something like 3 million. Then he unlocked a new legendary transformation which increased his power by literally 50x. Goku's leap in power was gigantic. 


Now let's look at Frieza. This is a being so powerful that he had to do the opposite of Goku, rather than look to grow stronger, he sought to reduce his power to be able to simply interact with some weaker beings. Frieza was never challenged, save Beerus which made sense in the grand scheme of things. Once Frieza was bested by Goku and resurrected it would only make sense for him to train to defeat Goku. 


Now here is where I get to the main point of my post. I know a lot of people like to shit on Frieza's 4 month growth, but they fail to realize this is as if someone like Superman learned to utilize ki. Hell, Frieza didn't even know how to sense ki. Frieza in his base was equal to SSJ Goku, who was the strongest saiyan to ever exist by dozens, hundreds of times even without his SSJ form. Now Frieza is clearly a prodigy, his base is equals SSJ Goku. For him to devote 4 months to training, being a prodigy of his level means it would far more fruitful than if someone like, say, Piccolo or even Gohan trained for the same time period. Frieza is just on another level, he always was and would have been if he hadn't had such a horrendous personality. That was his true downfall. Where as Goku pushes forward always trying to improve, Frieza considered himself above all else and never sought to improve himself. In a way, Frieza lacks the vision and ambition of Goku. Where as I feel Frieza was content to be forever weaker than Lord Beerus but stronger than literally everyone else, Goku seeks to reach the level of the Hakaishin and thoroughly believes it's possible, as seen in his discussion with Hit. 


All of this to say that I think Frieza's comeback was not the best arc in DB, but it certainly makes sense in universe because Frieza is just on a whole other level. I would find it amazing if Lord Beerus used the dragon balls to resurrect Frieza for the universal tournament only to have Goku, or hopefully Vegeta, kill him off afterwards, a nice bit of karma. Frieza is also a great foil for Goku as he is the complete opposite, whereas Goku always sought to increase his power, Frieza actually sought to suppress his own. Anyway. There's my rant.

It was a character defining trait that was built up over sagas and arcs that really gave his character depth and grew on us as viewers. What I loved about episode 62 of Super was the characterization of Lord Beerus. When he was first shown it could not be emphasized enough how Goku must be formal and respectful to Lord Beerus, the destroyer. Fast forward to today and we have Bulma openly calling Lord Beerus out on his bad wisdom in regards to changing space time. My favorite part about the episode is how Beerus is really sticking to his guns, essentially saying to the mortals my job is done, you do as you please, let's go Whis, only for him to turn around and visit Gowasu as to how he can resolve this issue, saying how it is taboo for a Hakaishin to go back in time. Now this could be written off as Lord Beerus just wanting to establish his godliness to the Z fighters, but I don't think that is the case otherwise he would have vaporized Bulma. No, I think Lord Beerus is beginning to care for Goku, Vegeta, Bulma and the rest of the Z fighters. I think Lord Beerus genuinely wants to resolve this issue for his new ""friends"" (more like playthings that he really really cares for). It was a slow episode and the animation wasn't as good as some of the recent episodes, but I'm loving the characterization and the story, I'm really glad Dragon Ball is back and I'm so curious to see how this gets resolved. I have a feeling the mafuba will fail, Goku and Vegeta will resort to fusion, that will fail, and then right in their most desperate hour, Lord Beerus with arrive with Gowasu and Whis in tow and defeat a fused Black and Zamasu.",dbz,My Favorite Part of Episode 62,https://www.reddit.com/r/dbz/comments/57snz6/my_favorite_part_of_episode_62/

In his first battle with Black, Goku commented that Black was like him, that Black held back his power in the beginning of the fight to test his opponent and that Black enjoys fighting strong opponents. Black even went so far as to tell Goku not to rush the fight, and we all know Goku is not one to rush a fight. Goku will draw out a fight to get every last bit of enjoyment that he can. Now fast forward to Goku's second encounter with Black. Zamasu tells Black that Goku is his prey, not Black's to which Black replies that this body (Goku) wants to fight Goku. Clearly Black still has some of Goku's tendencies. That being said, recall how Whis stated that Goku is too relaxed in battle and needs to address his problem. I have a feeling Black's fondness for battle is going to land him in a lot of trouble. I'm not sure how, but I am certain that personality trait will factor into the way Black will be defeated. 

My own crazy theory, Black gains power from pain, apparently, and Zamasu is immortal. It would be funny to see Black eventually want to fight Zamasu which results in a battle wherein Black can never destroy Zamasu, and Zamasu cannot seem to get away from being beaten endlessly by the image of the person he hates the most. It would balance, in a way, and call back to Gowasu's lesson to Zamasu.

Does anyone else suspect that this is one of Black's objectives? From the last episode, specifically Zamasu and Gowasu's conversation, he believes the God's are slacking in their duty. Now the Hakaishin might be too much for him to handle, so killing the Kaioshin would have the same effect, both of whom he believes have a corrupt sense of justice. 


Now here's where things get a bit weird in my theory, and you guys will probably agree (that it's a weird theory). Now as we've seen, there are hierarchies in DB and they're all connected. Kill the Kaioshin and the associated Hakaishin will die as well. Now the Omni-King seems to be untouchable, but I think he's not. I believe that if all Hakaishin and all Kaioshin are killed, then something might happen to the Omni-King, and I mean every single Hakaishin and Kaioshin. From all universes. Now this is obviously seemingly far fetched, but is it? Gowasu was just explaining the meaning of balance and justice to Zamasu, which Zamasu still does not understand and he will do something stupid. Additionally, why else would Zamasu be in Universe 7? Not just to kill Humans but Kaioshin as well since he sees them as flawed. 

So I believe Black is aiming for more than just eliminating Humans, he has something else on his mind as well. And in his mind he is doing the right thing, but has no realization that he is completely misguided and attempting something incredibly dangerous.

To explain some of the occurrences in DBS using this makes sense, for example, when Goku goes SSJ after being SSG and Beerus comments that Goku could be a rare prodigy, Goku could have been not allowing some of his ki to leak, but some does which why he's still regular SSJ. Later on when Goku goes SSJ, SSJ2, or SSJ3 he's powering up but allowing his ki to leak, but when he goes SSB he is going SSJ but not allowing any ki to leak, causing immense pressure in the body that Vegeta and Goku are skilled enough to control. Beerus and Whis have been doing this for millennia so to them this comes naturally, that's why you can't sense their ki.

As a result, when the particle accelerator went off, he was granted immense speed, as was his father, Jay Garrick. However, Zoom was far younger and far faster. Jay tried his hardest to battle Zoom but was unable to keep up with his speed and thus captured, essentially the same way Zoom states it occurred. However, this was not enough for Zoom. He needed to humiliate his father as his father had done to him by sending him to a psychiatric ward, so Zoom went back in time and framed his father for the murder of his mother. The result, Jay Garrick was wrongly sent to prison while Zolomon was sent off to live in foster care. This is the time remnant Zolomon Zoom retrieved only to kill off; he also never told this Zolomon he would be killed. He needed it to look dramatic.

To be honest, I think this could work quite well. It would require a lot of team work, be fast paced, and to be honest I love the Breakout UI. Knowing how many players left on your team is an extremely important metric and I like the lack of radar as well as the quick TTK (meaning bad plays are punished more heavily).

I've gotten a ton of seemingly random spawns in Halo 5 in which I'm either right in the open for players to shoot me immediately or I spawn in the middle of a fight. However, I'm not here to complain. I just want to hear people's theories as to how the spawn system functions. In Halo 3 there were specific spawn areas that would be weighted positively based off of whether team mates were there as well as whether team mates had  been spawned there, essentially how safe the spawn was. Spawns would also be negatively influenced if grenades were exploding nearby, enemies were nearby, teammates had been killed there, and/or whether shots were being fired in that direction. Based off of those criteria, the game would choose a, relatively, safe spawn for the player and it functioned very well. 

Now, I know we can't know all the exact spawn locations until forge is released, but has anyone figured out the spawn system yet? I haven't had enough time to go in and experiment yet but I plan on doing so soon. If anyone wants to help out, message me and I'll give you my GT so we can figure something out. Also, one complaint, never been a fan of neutral spawns. Giving teams a side adds to the whole control/competitive aspect of Halo, ie fighting for Turf.

What I want to talk about are strategies and how this subreddit can help the Halo community. Let me just preface this by saying I subscribe to r/bodybuilding as well and they have daily discussion threads about various topics in bodybuilding. I propose that r/halo do the same except with map, shooting, positioning, tips, tricks, strategies, tactics, etc. While the topics we choose to discuss are still open to what players deem the most important, I think this could really help out the community by making it tighter, more connected, and more aware. By this, I mean if general tactics and strategies are spread and players made aware of them, I feel like the online Halo community would benefit as well. I've seen a lot of posts about players not playing the objective and focusing on slaying, but if we made daily discussions about maps and game types I'm sure we could find a way to allow players a more strategic method of play. I've seen this sort of thing happen as far back as Halo 2 and 3 where players did not know how to play certain game types more so out of ignorance than selfishness. I think Halo generally has a fairly mature community - tea bagging aside - and I would love to see more players aware of how to play the game as a team to win.
