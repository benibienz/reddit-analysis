447,"It's particularly good at blocking neutron radiation. Since neutrons lose energy by 'recoiling' i.e. elastic collisions, when they hit a particle close to their weight, they will lose close to half their energy with each collision. Water has lots of hydrogen, meaning lots of protons which weigh as much as neutrons. So there's many chances for high energy neutrons to 'slow down'. 

Conversely if neutrons collide with and recoil off a heavy element (say iron), they will retain most of their energy. Think of it as a billiard ball bouncing off another billiard ball vs billiard ball bouncing off a boulder.

As for gamma radiation, the best way is to put as much material between you and the source. That's why lead is used for medical Xrays (less energetic than gammas but same type of radiation) ",2016-08-09 09:59:02+00:00,d6a6ykx,7.0,t1_d6a6d2b,2105.0,todayilearned

I take advantage of the AMOLED and pull down the shade when I'm not actively looking around (ie just walking to hatch). I'm sure that helps the battery a bit.

On that note, the battery would last about 2.5h which is similar to that youtube comparison. Not too bad, but a bit soon compared to the time it takes to get tired walking

574,"Here's[ a good video that addresses the 'what if question'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZpJ7yUPwdU). Its specifically targeting Pascal's Wager but it is applicable to any belief that's unprovable. Bottom line is, Believing 'just in case' is futile. What if Allah only saved Alawites and sent all other 'Muslims' to hell? 

What if Muʿtazila was the only real interpretation of Islam and every Muslim living today is doomed to hell? You can play the 'what if' game forever *even within the Islamic faith* and all permutations of 'what if' would send you to hell even for the smallest transgression. 

In the end, nobody can prove to you that what you're doing right now is concordant with 'God's will' (whatever that means), so you have no proof that you're going to 'heaven'. To know that for sure, you'd have to have complete knowledge of god's plan, ie you'd have to be Allah herself. 

So I understand the fear you're going through but remember, that fear is there to keep you in line, to make you blindly follow your faith. After a bit of thought, all those 'rules' and 'promises' just evaporate away, they're paper tigers that stop you thinking for yourself. 

This is why people who consider dogmatic religion emotionally traumatic have a point. If you're in such pain just for thinking something that 'you shouldn't think', I don't see any other way to call indoctirnation other than emotional abuse of children.

771,"I figured I'd ballpark the crossection to see if it even would interact. 

I approximated a human as a bag of water (meatbag), and the particle as  Barium at 300 GeV.

Used[ cross-section equation for elementary particles](http://journals.aps.org/prc/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevC.10.167),  ~5 millibarns (yes it's a real unit for an area, something something broad-side of barn door)
number density of protons in water: 1 cm^-3 of it would contain 6x10^23 /18 ~ 3x10^22

[n*σ=μ
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_\(physics\))

3.33x10^22 *5.39x10^-27 = 0.00018 cm^-1

So you either need roughly a thousand particles to pass through you for roughly one to interact or you put a thousand people in a line and one of them will statistically interact with the nucleus.

Give me a should if I did a blunder in this here math

1161,"&gt; For dectecting non plane aligned planets

Neither of the two replies answered your question. 

The answer is: It's just as hard. The wobble (*radial* velocity method of detection) can only detect the component of the 'wobble' in our direction. In other words a planet of M_J will have a maximum effect when its orbital plane is perpendicular to the plane of the sky. However if its orbital plane is in the plane of the sky, this planet will be invisible to us (both to Kepler-style telescopes and to the RV, or 'wobble' method).

Also there lies a degeneracy between inclination and mass. A more massive planet whose orbit is inclined will have the same orbital profile as a less massive planet that is head on. If they both have a circular orbit, it would be impossible to tell them apart. An eccentric orbit can help split this degeneracy. Trouble is life probably won't like planets with too eccentric of an orbit

EDIT: 
&gt;I imagine the resolution needed for either would be large

Nope! My previous faculty has detected planets with a 1.2 m telescope, the Mercator telescope at La Palma. What you *do* need is a very precise spectrograph, an instrument that splits light and detects the shift of spectral lines towards the red and blue (THIS is what is meant by 'wobble'). 

Visually detecting the planet is trickier. It needs to be far enough to not be flooded by the parent star's light (And you need a good coronograph). This is usually done in the infrared where stars are dimmer and planets are brighter to help even out the ratios. Incidentally, I worked a summer term on the GPI project, the Gemini Planet Imager is on a slightly larger telescope but it has [already imaged a couple of planets](http://planetimager.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Fig1_HR8799_image_Ingraham2014.jpg)",2016-05-10 22:08:45+00:00,d30j61o,2.0,t1_d30aqrn,10755.0,space

1164,"The inline twist may be high enough to not be a problem but doing an unbanked twist after two steep sections is almost always a bad idea, *especially* if the train enters the steep sections with some velocity already.

Edit: Had a second look, The inline twist is way after the double corkscrew, the train should be slow enough there that it won't be a problem. I'll need to see the height values (in units) to be sure though:)",2016-05-10 20:40:19+00:00,d30f5kg,3.0,t1_d3060gl,11478.0,rct

I've recently started getting into mindfulness and meditation, mostly listening to podcasts, reading and trying out guided meditation. This part of your post really resonated with me, because it probably applies to a lot more going on in your mind than just 'looking at other girls'. 

I think a lot of our intrusive thoughts and instinctive reactions are biologically bred into us. This is neither a good thing or a bad thing, but just a fact of nature. I think learning how to calm your mind will go a long way for you and not just in this subset of occasions. But I think the first step is to accept these actions as your animal mind looking to mate.

1651,"It's no real surprise when you see the abundance of elements in the [Solar System](http://www.nucastro.ph.tum.de/fileadmin/tuphena/www/_migrated_pics/solar-system-abundances-of-the-chemical-elements.1.jpg) , which is representative of the universe as a whole, however there's a small bias. (NB: The plot is logarithmic so each tick means 10 times more abundant)

So naturally H and He are the most common elements. (Almost) all the H in fact remnants from the big bang that still haven't been fused into heavier elements and most of the Helium comes from the same source. You may notice C, N and O being the three following elements by abaundance. This is mostly because they act as catalysts in the CNO cycle that stars 3+ times the Sun's mass use to burn hydrogen. So partly because of the CNO cycle, O ends up being the third most common element in the Universe. 

Now what molecules can you make out of the most abundant elements? Well H2 is an obvious one, and it's indeed the most common element in the universe. Let hydrogen cool down far away from UV light and it'll end up H2. He doesn't form molecules as it's a noble gas, so its valence shell is filled, so the next candidate is O. Since there's more H than O, a free O ion is more likely to encounter two H ions than another O, making H2O the second most abundant molecule throughout the Universe.

1703,"The search space is defined as all possible outcomes from the current game state. Of course it is impossible (for both chess and Go) to traverse the entire search space because, and I assume you meant to say this, each step means the number of possible game states grows. This growth depends on the type of game, chess doesn't have many different possible moves so its search space grows relatively slowly. Because in Go, the player is free to place a stone on any point, from each game state, even two iterations create prohibitively many states to brute force. 

With a 19x19 grid, just the first 5 moves are already (19^2 x(19^2 -1)x(19^2 -2)x(19^2 -3)x(19^2 -4)=6.0x10^12 ) possible outcomes, and that's for a game that usually takes 200+ iterations to complete. So each path needs to be evaluated deep enough to be sure we're not making a wrong move, but enough paths need to be evaluated to make sure we're not missing any moves. This is basically what the MCTS, Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm is. It traverses a tree (in this case the 'game state tree') and searches based on a specific criterion (which by the way is probably difficult to define in Go at least in terms of code).

My PhD supervisor works with MCTS and I'll definitely be asking him more about this development!",2016-01-27 22:52:07+00:00,czefs4z,6.0,t1_czee2n7,2485.0,Futurology

The reason a metal pitcher *feels* colder is because it's a heat conductor so when you touch it, heat from your finger propagates through the metal and you *feel* it being colder. Anyways it's a common misconception.

1890,"We don't have statistics outside of our Solar System, but we have pretty good theory to describe axial tilt, or rather the lack thereof. 

If you look at the [Axial tilt](http://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tablesb.htm) of the planets in the Solar System, you'll notice that only Mercury and Jupiter have close to zero axial tilt (And Venus, kind of, since it's almost tilted the whole other way, more on that later). 

Mercury is pretty easy to explain, and it generalizes to bodies that orbit close to other massive bodies. Because the distance between the two bodies is small enough compared to the size of the planet, the insides of the planet get differentially stretched enough to match the orbit of the planet with respect to the star (think of the tides, except it's happening inside the centre of the planet, so think molten magma tides). Because this molten mass moves with respect to the planet's rotation, the friction basically slows down the planet until it's ""tidally locked"" with the star; ie it only has one side that faces the star at all times. The Moon is tidally locked with the Earth for example (The moon is tilted 1.5 degrees with respect to its orbit so it *does* have a slight inclination). Anyways because of the symmetry of these tidal effects, they act differentially with respect to the spin axis creating torques that eventually diminish the tilt to zero. Think about how a spinning top 'rights itself' immediately after it's been spun even if you do a wobbly job. EDIT: [paper on this, check out Figs 8,9](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4544v2.pdf)

This effect applies to planets close to their stars, but also it applies [Pretty accurately to Jupiter's moons too!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons#Members), something I TIL'd researching this. 

Now Jupiter is an interesting case. I'm still searching for a theory but my guess would be that it just grew too heavy too quickly to be affected by collisions. The smaller planets grew slower and thus were smaller during the late heavy bombardment. With so many comets and asteroids flying around chaotically, the pummeling made the other planets gain an arbitrary tilt. In Venus' case it's theorized that massive impacts basically flipped the planet over. Anyways since there's no tilt-dampening effects for planets far from their stars, the rest of the planets got stuck with their arbitrary tilts. It's my guess that Jupiter just grew too fast to be affected by collisions by smaller bodies and thus it has a ~3 degree tilt wrt to its orbit. 

As for the rest of the galaxy, ~~I'm not aware of us measuring the exact tilt of planets~~ EDIT: They exist, for example [here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6813v1.pdf), or [here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.6289v2.pdf). We can infer them based on the tidally locked scenario, ~~however I don't think we have direct measurements of the tilt of a planet with respect to its orbit~~. Nevertheless our theory is pretty sound when talking about planets close to their parent stars. 

PS, seasons also need an atmosphere!

PPS: [This Paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05570v2.pdf) Suggests that planets with an orbital period longer than 30 days are essentially randomly aligned (statistically speaking). If you're thinking 'Hey, what about Mercury, it has a period of 88 days' you're a good scientist, always doubt conclusions! The caveat here is that they study cooler stars which are less massive than the sun, and thus have a weaker gravitational hold on their planets. That may or may not be enough to justify their conclusions, so always be cautious of the conclusion of papers!",2015-12-13 22:03:48+00:00,cxxxotq,1.0,t3_3wooz2,7616.0,askscience

Probably some, yes. Islam is an ideology that can be easily radicalized, especially in poor and socially excluded humans. The problem however is that there's no way of knowing what's going on in the head of any follower of Islam. People's minds are black boxes and it's very easy to act all fine and dandy while having very sinister ideas brewing in your head. 

That's what makes this so insidious. Bottom line is as long as you identify with Islam, and as long as Islam can be used to make people strap on dynamite and go in a crowded theater, people who don't know you *really* well will be afraid.

If I come to you and ask for $1000 and tell you that I'll give it to you in 5 years, you'd want some money to compensate you for being down $1000 half a decade. If I'm some unknown person on the street you'd ask for a lot of money back (or some collateral to ensure you won't bail). If I'm your super rich brother maybe you'd ask for just a little more back or not even charge interest: I would be trustworthy and the repayment would be sure.

Now the good news is that Apple has some pretty good hardware design. The hardware quality and reliability is on par with flagships from other manufacturers. Also the fact that their devices are expensive is a way for their users to [praise them more after purchase even when they criticize them before release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization).

The elegance of the solar sail is that acceleration and deceleration are done without fuel, and using the same hardware (of course supposing it survives the ISM: It can of course be stowed during the cruising stage).

This is true in our Solar System as well. Look at Pluto for example. We were able to accelerate a probe to reach it in 9 years, however it was going too fast to enter orbit. I'm not even sure a Pluto orbiter would be possible with current technology in less than 20-30 years between launch and injection. 

Now look at Mercury. It's much closer to us than Pluto, however the MESSENGER orbiter took 7 years from launch to orbital injection. Almost the same length as it took us to reach Pluto!

I don't think that's how distributions work

Edit: Also if your car cannot pass emission testing etc, etc. it is *illegal*. Just do a cursory search on used cars and see how many model 90's you find. It will be less than 5-10%

2599,"It *sounds* crazy, but that would mean that in 16 years this technology is effectively perfect and ubiquitous. And there are two essential obstacles to overcome: The technological one and the policy/business model one. 

The technological obstacle is largely overcome: Humans are objectively worse and more dangerous drivers than even today's models. Fast forward 16 years and it's a no-brainer that no human will ever be able to reach an automated car's performance and safety. 

The policy and business model side is more tricky, but Uber is a great example how disruptive new services can be and how quickly they can get adopted. Likewise, the states are interested in staying competitive with the rest of the world so it's in their interest to allow for these innovations to flourish. 

Overall in 16 years I don't see anyone ever having to operate a vehicle unless it's at a private race track, or a specific area for human drivers. ",2015-06-28 11:10:48+00:00,cslbm01,2.0,t1_cskj184,71657.0,Futurology
