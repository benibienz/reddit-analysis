I was hoping to start a conversation with believers on how to solve this issue. I was banned within minutes. Here is my piece for all to see, I don't care about the fame, I don't care about the karma, but if we continue as we have in the past, innocent humans will continue to die

------------

&gt; Dear follower of Islam. I know who you are. You grew up in a middle class family. Your friends are college educated. You watch western movies and listen to Rock and Roll. You may even enjoy the occasional craft brew. And you don't think you're part of the problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, you posted that Facebook picture, maybe even wrote a heartbroken status. But this will blow over and you won't change a thing. And because you won't change a thing, people will continue to murder in the name of your religion. 
&gt; 
&gt; And you can stop this, but you will not. Your life is too comfortable. You're not brave enough. You value your faith more than the life of others. You can stop this but you will not. 
&gt; 
&gt; There are people braver than you. There are people who renounced their religion and publicly spoke against it trying to stop this madness. Brave humans like Salaman Rushde and Ayaan Hirsi Ali have. They've put their lives at risk, but they've sent a message: ""The life of others is more sacred to me than Islam"". You're not brave, you're afraid and Islam means more to you than anyone else's life. 
&gt; 
&gt; One day you'll change back your Facebook picture, start tweeting about your breakfast and go on as if nothing has happened. You will not leave your religion and speak out. Muslims will continue to murder in your name. You will continue to be the silent majority. You can stop this but you will not. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear follower of Islam. I extend my hand and invite you to stop thinking yourself as a Muslim, and start thinking of yourself as a human. And the rest of the world shall too.
