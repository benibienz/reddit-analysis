Yesterday I started researching the local amendment on the Madison County ballots. I read the language on the ballot. I read a couple of summaries.

What does that have to do with the constitution of the state? Well the language of the amendment (and the language of the bill) both point to a section of the state constitution that is terrifically vague (it's, like, two lines long).

43,"Since my other post was getting yuuuge, I figured I'd post this (final) opinion in a new comment.

I talked to a couple of friends who work in law here locally. It seems like the issue this amendment is attempting to correct is that judges appointed in non-election years sometimes do not have enough time to qualify for the primary that would allow them to run for the seat in the following year's election. This is a problem because 1) the Alabama primary was moved up to March and 2) our state is backwards and makes judges run on partisan tickets. So any judge appointed by the committee might have a hard time qualifying for the next election as it stands right now. This amendment proposes to change that.

Madison Co currently has a dearth of judges, so anything that can be done to help keep a judge in a seat would be good for the caseload and backlog at the courthouse. That said, I'm still worried about the OpenStates reading, which indicates that the appointed judges would be allowed to bypass one general election and serve a full six year term on top of their vacancy appointment term. I've got a line out trying to get clarification on that.

So I understand the ""why"". I'm still not totally clear on the ""how"".

I also emailed Rep. Whorton, who originally sponsored HB472, to see if he could tell me why I should vote for his amendment. No response yet :-)",2016-11-07 21:18:46+00:00,d9q42m7,2.0,t1_d9pn1d9,20332.0,HuntsvilleAlabama

45,"That's a great question. I didn't even realize we had a local amendment. For what it's worth, the language on the ballot is

&gt; PROPOSED LOCAL
AMENDMENT NUMBER ONE (1)
Relating to Madison County, proposing an
amendment to Amendment 334 to the
Constitution of Alabama of 1901, to revise the
term of office of a person appointed to fill a
vacancy in the office of circuit or district judge
in Madison County so that the term will
correspond with the general provisions of
Section 153 of the Constitution. (Proposed by
Act No. 2016-272)

And here's Section 153

&gt; **SECTION 153 Election or appointment of judges of inferior courts.** The judges of such inferior courts of law and equity as may be by law established, shall be elected or appointed in such mode as the legislature may prescribe.

So that's not very helpful. I'll see if I can't get an explanation.

edit: This is the bill ([HB472](http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/ALISON/SearchableInstruments/2016rs/PrintFiles/HB472-enr.pdf)) that generated the amendment.

edit2: Okay. So I've done some digging and I *think* I have the amendment figured out. Full disclosure - I am not an elected official or in any way a legal authority. I just think that researching/knowing your amendments is really important. 

This is the salient change that HB472 (and the amendment) would ratify:

&gt;~~The appointee shall hold
11 such office until the next general election for any state
12 officer held at least six months after the vacancy occurs and
13 until a successor is elected and qualified. At the general
14 election, the judicial office shall be filled for a full term
15 of office to commence on the first Monday after the second
16 Tuesday in January following the general election.~~ The term of
17 office of a judge appointed to fill a vacancy shall be as
18 otherwise provided in the Constitution of Alabama of 1901.""

As it stands now, if a vacancy appears in a district or circuit judge seat in a non-election year there is a committee whose job it is to submit nominees to the governor for persons to fill said vacancy. Once the governor accepts a nominee that person will fill the vacant seat until the next general election, where they will have to run for election just like everyone else. This bill alters that language so that the person appointed to fill the vacancy would serve a full six year term. **I could be wrong about this and, if I am, I would like someone to clarify**. 

My *totally partisan* view of this is that it's a power grab by the committee to gain the authority to appoint judges to full terms in non-election years. One thing that I'm unsure of is how this would effect the term of office, because it would seem like being appointed to a six year term in an off-election year would guarantee that your term would end in another off-election year, thereby perpetuating the off-election year appointment of judges. I really have a hard time believing that's the result of this change, but I can't think of another way to read it. It seems too obvious, right?

edit3: The summary on [OpenStates](http://openstates.org/al/bills/2016rs/HB472/) says that the full term appointment will begin at the end of the vacancy appointment. That's not *as* bad, but it still seems kinda shady. Why bypass the general election even once?

edit4: [This is the WHNT breakdown of the amendment](http://whnt.com/2016/10/31/breakdown-of-madison-county-proposed-local-amendment-1/), which reads *completely* differently than my interpretation.",2016-11-07 16:39:48+00:00,d9ppw39,2.0,t1_d9pn1d9,3594.0,HuntsvilleAlabama

The issue the ABC has right now is that there is no trackable way to enforce the limit set upon breweries for direct sales. You're only allowed to buy 128 oz (I think?) from a brewery a day. That's in the Growler law that passed last year. But there is currently nothing in place to even track the amount of those sales.

The truth is that Sharia law is *derived* from the Quran and the Hadiths but not in any way central to it.

The issue I've found is that Shipping &amp; Handling on one bottle usually adds enough to the cost to make it no longer worth it.

342,"Buffalo Trace is aged longer, you're right. The master distiller of Buffalo Trace (Harlan Wheatley) believes the 'sweet spot' for most whiskeys is between 6-8 years in 55 gallon barrels. Opinions vary on how long Buffalo Trace is aged, although Wheatley has apparently mentioned that it's around 9 years in the barrel. I'd be surprised if that was the case, honestly. As long as it's more than 2 years old it isn't legally required to state its age on the bottle, so it's all speculation unless you pick the barrel yourself.

Personally I don't think it's all that close to Buffalo Trace, but some might disagree. I think it tastes pretty young and kinda hot (read - it still tastes sorta grassy and underdeveloped and has more of an alcohol 'burn' than I enjoy). That's not at all surprising considering how little time it spent on oak. But for a brand new distillery I think they're doing good things and I was there on the day they started selling to buy my bottle. They have a lot of potential. I'll be interested to see what it tastes like a few years from now.

You should go by the distillery and have a taste or maybe even pick up a bottle. Then, if you're feeling froggy, go pick up a bottle of Buffalo Trace and try them side by side.",2016-06-17 19:32:24+00:00,d4dfuuj,6.0,t1_d4danwv,6562.0,HuntsvilleAlabama

344,"Short answer - yes.

Longer whiskey nerd answer - Jack Daniels* ages their whiskey in 55 gallon barrels. Irons One (and a lot of small, new distilleries) age in 5 gallon barrels (and Jeff told me they have 10 gallon barrels now, too). Since exposure to the charred oak staves is a major factor in flavoring the whiskey, using a smaller barrel means you get more exposure in less time because of the simple surface area to volume ratio. A lot of craft distillers like to think of this as 'rapid aging' of the whiskey because you get more oak and wood-sugar flavors into the whiskey more quickly. There's no real hard and fast conversion or anything, but you can get a pretty good amount of flavor into a whiskey in a small barrel in 6-8 months, like Jeff is doing. I had a craft distiller tell me that 1 year in a 1 gallon barrel was the same as 15 years in a 55 gallon barrel. That, of course, is complete bullshit. One thing that a small barrel is incapable of replicating is the actual *time* affect of the extended aging. That much is obvious when you taste ""slow-aged"" whiskeys next to ""rapid-aged"" whiskeys. But small craft distilleries have to get a product to market and can't afford to wait 4-6 years aging whiskey in big damn barrels before they can sell their product. So small barrels it is.

\* One note about Jack Daniels - they also filter all their whiskey through maple charcoal after it's been aged which has the effect of 'smoothing' out the flavors by adding some more sugars and removing some of the finer esters from the whiskey. This is called the ""Lincoln County Process"" and I think it makes whiskey taste like shit.",2016-06-17 17:00:13+00:00,d4d8mg5,4.0,t1_d4d700t,2064.0,HuntsvilleAlabama

Here's what he had to say:

&gt;We are a truly independent and veteran owned businesses who gave up our day jobs to get behind this concept that we wholeheartedly believe in. My wife and I have put EVERYTHING on the line to make this business successful, and only we can make the difficult decisions that most others can sit on the sidelines and second guess without risk of failure either way. I promise you the decision to move was not made without lots of sleepless nights and constant second guessing. That never ends when you own a small business. This is how we make a living and take care of our children after all. I'm sorry if it makes people in Madison angry with us, but we have to do what is best for our business for the long haul.

&gt;I am not going to get into a lot of detail, but let's just say the future of WYWB was not all that rosy in our current location and the decision to move was absolutely necessary. Our original plan was to stay in Madison. We scouted for a suitable location in Madison first and foremost. Unfortunately we could not find one at this time. With the lease running out by year's end, we had to either hunker down and weather the storm on Highway 72 or find a new place that would offer us our best chance of long-term success.

&gt;And we definitely love Madison and hope to return very soon. Our goal is to get the Campus No. 805 location up and running and revisit a second location for the Madison sometime in 2017. In the meantime, sure, check out Tim and Fresh Spirits. He's an old friend and fellow SR Butler High alumnus who I've know since I was about 12 years old. Or support Stem &amp; Stein. We love Ali and Jess over there! And of course, visit the breweries themselves that are in Madison. I don't expect you all to visit us as much as when we were in your backyard, but hope you will come see us when you can. We think you will love the new spot and Campus No. 805 will be awesome!

I'll copypasta his response here.

&gt;Remember last year when we battled to get Carly's law passed to allow a study by UAB on the use of CBD oil for pediatric epilepsy patients? That law did not decriminalize the possession of CBD oil, it only provided the ability for a patient or parent of a patient to say that they were in possession of the controlled substance prescribed by a physician involved in the UAB study and that a judge could allow that statement to be held as a affirmable defense in the case, thus rendering a not-guilty verdict.

&gt;The issue with Carly's law is that when the UAB trial was finally approved many of the families who had lobbied the government for it's passage were not allowed in the trail because the patients needed to meet some very strict medical parameters due to the narrow scope of the trial. Leni is one of the kids who was not accepted.

&gt;The bill would allow other patients who have certain conditions diagnosed by a physician that they have a bona-fide doctor-patient relationship with (not just someone who writes prescriptions) to use that same defense, as well as the parent or guardian of said patient. It does not make the possession of CBD oil legal, not does it authorize a physician in Alabama to write a prescription for CBD oil outside of the UAB study. The governor has mentioned that he wants to require a prescription by a physician, but as prescriptions require dosage instructions and there is no agreed upon dosage schedule since there have not been many studies on CBD usage for these various conditions it would potentially make it difficult for a physician to write a prescription.",2016-05-05 20:39:38+00:00,d2uaa20,5.0,t1_d2u7gn3,3668.0,Alabama

519,"**I know this is kind of a long shot and I'm not sure if there's a better community out there for this, but I figure it's worth a shot.**

My wife and I recently honeymooned in St Lucia at the Windjammer resort. That is where we found [these chairs](https://imgur.com/a/bGNgc). She fell in love with the design and has been trying to locate them ever since but we've had no luck. Nothing about them gave the impression that they were one-offs or handmade or anything, so I'm assuming they're just produced by some furniture company somewhere. I'd love to have a set for our home, so I'm hoping the master sleuths of Reddit can help me identify the manufacturer (it wasn't on the chairs anywhere) or even the exact model.

TL;DR - I want to find out where I can buy [these chairs](https://imgur.com/a/bGNgc) and need help identifying them.",2016-03-24 15:38:24+00:00,d1bv0y9,1.0,t3_4bs2ii,18.0,pics

590,"Data caps were only a small reason I left Comcast, but it's the reason I told them (because I do think they're terrible and wanted them to believe they were losing lots of customers for it). Really it was because their customer service was utterly useless (though the people were nice enough) and their pricing structure was needlessly confusing. I spent *hours* on the phone with Comcast just trying to get a basic, internet-only plan. They couldn't fathom it. So I got what they told me was an internet-only plan only to find out months later that I'd been paying for TV service the whole time anyway — a ""package deal"" of some sort that they *promised* me was my cheapest option... until it wasn't — despite the fact that I had never once used it. WTF? And when I told them I owned my own modem that threw them into a tizzy, too. They wanted me to rent all their sub-standard equipment. It was maddening.

Alternatively, it took me a two minute conversation with the WOW customer service people to find out how much their various plans cost without any up-selling or bullshit salesmanship rigmarole. I switched service *that day* and have been happy as a clam ever since.

The fact that it primarily affects older people, people in rural areas, people in poverty, and people of color just makes it low-hanging fruit for parties interested in disenfranchising those groups.

So before anyone starts throwing around data and arguments one way or the other, know that the consensus is still up in the air even among the experts.

Also, that website is really interesting if you're into expert opinion on things. ",2016-01-20 15:30:26+00:00,cz59bbo,1.0,t3_41suop,37150.0,HuntsvilleAlabama

It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.
