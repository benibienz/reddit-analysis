Where the hell are Theon and Asha/Yara going with all those ships? I kind of imagine that the Ironborn are persona non grata in most of Westeros. Is there any chance they'll try heading north to meet up with and support Sansa &amp; Jon? If Sansa &amp; Jon are trying to rally northern houses they could feasibly end up on Bear Island with the Mormonts, which might make sense considering the Mormont's more immediate ties to the Night's Watch. (The important question here really is whether or not they'll find Gendry the Rower...)

I have a 1.5 year old corgi. He used to bark a lot and pace a lot while we were just watching TV but we've been able to (mostly) break him of that habit. He'll still bark when there's a loud noise or another dog on TV, but it doesn't seem to bother him nearly as much as it used to. For some reason, though, whenever I'm playing video games (like Fallout 4 or Shadows of Mordor) on the PS4 he just cannot stop himself pacing around nervously and barking at every small noise on the screen. It's obnoxious and I can't figure out why video games would bother him more than regular television, but signs seem to indicate that they do. Have any of you dealt with pets doing this before?

The speculation (I emphasize that this is *speculation*) is that their battle to remain a smoking establishment finally came to a head with the property owners. 

I'm upset because the Goose is the best, closest bar to my house in 5 Points and I'm there at least once a week.
