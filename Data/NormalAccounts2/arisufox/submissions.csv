this is all well and good, untill one of my co-workers . X, reads it, And he starts saying ""Oh It's probably ""me"" (he used my name) who is doing it it"".

I ask him to stop saying what he was. But he persists. and I just Snapped and yelled at him.

I tried to bite my tounge but He had no respect to the fact that I asked him to stop Joking around. This is a serious issue. since it comes to Money and possible Identity theft compromising the trust of our franchise.

I step outside to try to calm myself down, but it doesn't work. So I try to gall our GM. she was havin dinner with her family at the time, but I explained to her the situation. She asked if we had any customers In the store when it happened, To which  I told her I believe there wasn't anyone.

Which Makes me afraid of what Disciplinary action she will decide to take. If I lose my job I don't know what I'm going to do. If i try to apply anywhere else and they ask why I was released. I have to be honest  And it's likely I won't be hired.

I blame the fact that I thought I would be OK without taking the medication my doctor gave me for my anxiety. I'm still tryign to figure out what dosing works best, as he gives me  42 tablets, which are suppoed to be a 3 months supply. but My anxiety is so severe, but the label says ""daily as needed"" I can't tell when it is ""as needed"" is.  Or maybe I was a bit more on edge because of how much cafiene I drank that morning. I don't know.

like waves on the white sand beach.
Event of yore best forgotten,
mysteriously re-appearing

To haunt us all,
like a spirit lost and confused.
We all try to move on,
only to run in place.

Hiding our feelings,
so that none may see injured.
Tearing us apart piece by piece
from the inside out.

When i was younger. In Elementary school. there was an accident that both my older brother Charles and I were involved in, Where the driver was 30 over when he hit us. Leaving us both in the hospital for at least a week. I don't recall to many details of the incident, but, my brother says, he was half way across when he saw the driver coming as he was in the middle of the crossing. He warned me not to come across, but I didn't listen. and we both were hit.

And also. there have been 2 times. the house that I've been living in at the time. have been victim of fires. Details I'd rather not go into.

What is following is a free write this morning, since i was waiting I got to work early, deciding to free write.

The people i refer to. andy is my room mate that iv'e lived with for about 7 or 8 years, natalie is my counselor, elizabeth is one of my sisters, and charles is my older brother who was involved in the same accident. I started by thinking about, why it is that I spend so much time at my computer when I'm at home for entertainment.

Part of the reason why, I spend so often at my computer, is Because I want to be home. A place where I know I have somewhere to return to. I need to realize that both times, I had nothing to do with the cause of the fires. If anything were to happen at the den, I don't know how I would handle it. Or where I would have to go. I might be able to couch surf with a brother Possibly, But that would only be temporary. I have no clue where I could find work, or what I could afford to rent.

But in the time I've lived wtih Andy, it hasn't happen, So why am I still so... Anxious, nervous about the Past repeating itself?

what is holding me back for getting my Driver's lisence. Andy &amp; Natalie both know of what had happened to you and Charles, and both, Say the same thing. As a result that you would be a more cautious driver. But the one time I was Behind the wheel with Elizabeth. when she was trying to teach me how to operate a Car, I was finding I didn't have an/a (?) ((not sure which applies))
focus.

I'm still not sure If it's the right Idea for me to have a lisence, But at the same time There is so much that openes up to me once I do. I'm no longer limited to ""where can I walk to get to work"". But I still can't Aleviate the anxiety no matter how much I try, that I could Possibly Cause an accident similiar to what happened back when my brother and I were in elementry school.

I feel like an oddity Compaired to the others around me, close friends like Andy Mike Frank chris. Each of them. Have.
NO!!!!
I need to stop compairing myself to the other around me. RIGHT NOW!!!!

I need to set a new, Reasonable Goal for myself to mee(a)t. (I purposefully wrote in an a) and start trying to change (and was crossed out) to listen to A what Andy has said for so long and Get my drivers lisence.

That will be my next new goal.

Since, I had only had 1 set for myself, 6 years ago when I first started with Subway. to be able to hold it down for stable employment.

Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees F

Bring together the seasonings meats eggs and oats in a mixing bowl to combine until egg is no longer visible. (for me the oats can usually be seen about 20% compared to visible meat)

Place in a gently greased 9 x 5 in loaf pan and wait 45 minutes approximately.

At this time. take the pan out and drain the fat that accrues at the bottom of the pan as best as possible.

Repeat in another 15 minutes

The meatloaf will be finished cooking once it reaches a safe temperature for beef and pork (160? i believe it is) on the inside which for my oven is about 1hr 10min to 1 hr 15.

Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes before attempting to cut.
