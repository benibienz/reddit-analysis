5,"I think Microsoft is no longer worried about Windows Phone numbers (neither should we) as they are really targeting Windows a universal platform: form-factor independent experience. What matters is 'how many windows devices' (which is growing) and not just 'how many Windows Phones'. So, as long as windows devices are increasing in numbers, you'll get to see more and more UWP apps. ",2016-08-20 02:46:09+00:00,d6oxuov,1,t3_4yjp2j,39001,windowsphone
6,"I've got a 640XL for now about a year, and it is real good. Running insider version of W10M now, but find everything good about it. The large screen, double-tap to wake (confirms it works on mine), easy accessibility to all external keys, camera quality (with reasonably good zoom), etc. Of course, W10M adds to its effectiveness big time.

7,"I also got this in an old laptop. No idea why. Self-healed - just restarted, and it was ok. Never saw it in my Lenovo Yoga laptop bought about 6 months back. Probably some incompatible driver failed in the old-laptop. Did not bother to even check it via the QR code displayed.

I was, but, amazed by the idea of displaying the QR code for quickly getting to know more when I saw that as an insider, months back!",2016-08-13 01:28:47+00:00,d6fdmtl,1,t3_4xggm8,7666,Windows10

9,"WhatsApp is definitely safe, no doubt. It is great for simple, no-frills messaging. It is, of course, going to stay fixed on my phone! I like hike for it's USP: localized content and regional stickers, but I guess it is not sustainable for them to maintain same quality of app in all platforms that they are in. Surprisingly, they don't even have a web-based app or a desktop app - both of which are available for WhatsApp!",2016-08-12 03:41:28+00:00,d6e3t8f,4,t1_d6dzuhd,6085,windowsphone

12,"I find nothing in this post that substantiates what is claimed except for links that shows old news. MS was that way - and may be still is - but i can't figure out that 'still is' part.

Remember, all companies are for business (especially the listed ones), and if MS finds that it can do business while being friendly with FOSS, I don't find any reason why you think that it really loves Linux only publically, and not so internally.

All i find in this post is that some sentences have been repeated multiple times just to convince readers (and self) that what is claimed in the title of the post is indeed true.",2016-04-05 10:22:13+00:00,d1qilvo,1,t3_4dawtv,77648,linux

19,"I wonder why we keep hearing this kind of news, and sometimes wonder what i am really missing in Windows phone that android and iOS offer, besides that app gap of those apps that i never really need. I like the live tiles, Cortana, as a user, and the fact that I never need to stick to a specific programing language as a developer. The prospect of seeing apps in all Windows 10 devices when developed only once as a UWP is for me enough reason to do something for WP, although i have no prior experience working/developing apps on a Windows platform ever. Seriously, i don't know. Blame it, of course, on the fact that I never used an android or an iPhone â˜º ",2016-01-29 05:46:59+00:00,czg3n1q,1,t3_436nzg,13346,microsoft

26,"I wanted something that is different. All iPhones like the same (grid-like icon arrangement) and android copied iphones to a large extent. WP was brave, completely different, and a good experiment. I suddenly saw the utility of live tiles, and this was better than having crazy widgets on my screen. Plus, android sucked battery badly, and wp was a welcome change (i don't know if android is any better now regarding battery usage because i moved to wp about 4 years back, and never looked back). I like W10M (running tech preview on my 640XL), and really not complaining about 'app gap' - at least i have all apps i use on daily basis.",2015-12-13 01:45:18+00:00,cxx1cmb,1,t3_3wk45f,18054,windowsphone
27,"I am also a huge fan of Windows phone, so much do that my first phone was Lumia 800, with WP7.5. You'll not believe, but i wanted to actually grab the first phone that landed at the local store, and was on the queue at 11:30pm to get that :-) Things have come a long way since then, and I am now with 640XL. And am running the technical preview of Windows 10 mobile. 

Personally, i have no cribs with the so called 'app gap' as all apps i want are already in there: Flipboard, nextgen reader, WhatsApp, Facebook, twitter, Wunderlist, vine, etc. - well, almost all. Only two cribs: Some of the apps are not as advanced as their android/ios siblings, and, really nothing (including HERE maps) that is anywhere close to google maps. I hope ms does something about this. 

And, actually, i am happy that project Astoria is dead (or at least seeming dead) because i think Windows developers must be respected, and really, app developers must develop native Windows store apps. The concept of universal apps is fantastic, goes well with continuum, but project Astoria goes against it! I believe islandwood's approach of conversion is better than Astoria approach of directly running android apps. My two cents.",2015-12-12 15:21:25+00:00,cxwhg73,1,t3_3wgcku,51947,windowsphone
