3,"Could they have packed in the original look along with the game? Yeah, but they chose not to. No one will know the reason but if I had to guess it'd be because they chose to put more resources into the new graphics which was going to work in more people's PCs rather than the graphics option that only 1% of gamers can run. Btw another graphics option adds significant amount of Dev time. There's so much testing and QA that goes into this (especially a game as huge as witcher 3). It's just not worth it for them.

They have no obligation to cover anything they don't want to. The fact that they aren't covering the PS4 Pro isn't because 'Sony didn't send them one', it's because they have no interest for it and don't really believe in the product. 

Guys - Greg and Colin are two of the biggest PS4 fanboys in the world. Literally any other thing released by Playstation they would be all over, but they're not all over this which speaks to just how disappointed they are with the PS4 Pro, and hence them not getting one.

223,"Well I just keep comparing it to the battle system from Trails of Cold Steel since I just finished that right before starting Digimon. Cold Steel has all sorts of mechanics that made battles deep. 

* Characters has a positional system so you couldn't hit enemies that are too far away and vice versa. 
* Spells has an area of effect and delay before they fire, so you can dodge them by moving your character outside the area - instead of just '1 target ' or 'all targets' 
* There's an 'S-Break' mechanic where you could give yourself a free turn to do heavy damage right in between enemy turns
* Combat Links - characters can pair up and help get an extra hit at some points, so you have to choose who to pair who with and what combat link actions you want to do
* Weapon types - some weapon types have a higher chance to 'unbalance' certain enemies

There's also all sorts of things you have to do to prepare for fights: 

* More robust equipment system - Weapon, armor, leg armor, accessories - instead of just the one 'Equipment' slot
* Quartz system that gives you extra skills as well as extra stats (kind of like materia from FF7)

297,"Hard to say as it totally depends on your definition of a 'decently high rank'. You can be decently high rank in any of the leagues, and it would be a totally different story for each league.

If you don't know how the league/rank system works in SC2 (disclaimer: the system is going through a bit of a change in the soon) the SC2 ladder system is divided between 7 Leagues, in order of skill:

* Bronze
* Silver
* Gold
* Platinum
* Diamond
* Master
* Grandmaster

You can be Rank 1 in any of these 7 leagues, however reaching Rank 1 in Silver isn't better than Rank 20 in Gold, for example.

You start the game with 5 'placement matches' and depending on how many of the 5 you win, you are placed in one of 5 leagues (I don't think you can be placed in Master or Grandmaster straight away). If you win enough games you can be promoted to the next league, and if you lose too much you can be demoted. 

So how long would it take to get from Bronze to Silver for example? Well.... that's really hard to answer as it really depends on how natural you are. There are people who have never touched an RTS before who can do it within 1 week, and then there are people who spend over a month doing it. Really the only way to know how long it'll take you is to just try it!

* Constant Worker Production (stop appropriately though) 
* Keep your resources low, always spend
* Expand whenever possible
* Don't get supply blocked
* Upgrades, upgrades, upgrades
* When your opponent attacks you defend. 
* When he defends you expand. 
* When he expands you attack!

Get in a game and focus on only **ONE** of these things. Don't even worry if you lose, you are only interested in improving that one aspect. For example, play a game where you are only focused on making workers constantly. Still make units and buildings and play as you would normally, but give most of your focus into making workers 100% of the time.

While it's true doing patches or updates in Unity is not simple, and is a feature that is missing from the engine, [it is still possible](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/21014/how-can-i-update-my-game-client-after-release.html).

The reason why there are no 'patches' for Hearthstone on Android here is with the way the Google Play Store handles games/app packages. There is no such feature in the Play Store called updates. You simply upload a brand new version of your app's .apk file, and the players' Play Store client on their phones recognise there is a new .apk file version available, and downloads it. 

Really it's not actually such a huge problem for the Android ecosystem. Most apps in the store are quite small in size. There's only a handful of apps or games that are as large as Hearthstone, so redownloading entire new versions of MOST apps or games is not a problem 98% of the time.

edit: Apparently [there is a thing called 'Smart App Updates'](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12877791). Not sure how this works, but this is not the same as a game 'patch'",2015-10-21 14:08:10+00:00,cw7lida,2.0,t1_cw7kxye,1016.0,hearthstone
