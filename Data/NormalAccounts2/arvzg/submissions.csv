Just trying to understand how Starbound treats Players and Universes across different installations/servers. 


1. Do all characters within the same server/local installation share the same universe? 

1. It seems that Players are able to move around to different Universes (by using Join Game in the main menu) but Universes stay within the server - so if you join another server you only carry your character with you, not your Universe too.

3. At home I've just been playing on my main PC, but I want to set up a dedicated server on my media server so my friends can join my Universe. If I just copy over the Universe folder from my PC to the server, will I be able to continue playing as my character in the same Universe?

Sure, they look different and play differently to a degree, but they all have 1 major thing in common. 

**At any given point, every map has just 1 single area of contest** 

All 12 maps and 4 game modes will either have a payload as an area of contention or a capture point. In either case the game wants you to go to a certain area and fight it out in that area. I think this severely limits complexity of the game.

Now I'm not saying that Overwatch should mimic other games, but it's worth having a look at other games. 

Take for example CS:Go. Bomb defusal maps will have 2 bombsites, A or B. The attacking team can choose to go to either one, or possibly even fake going to A, but swing back around to B. 

Another comparison we can make is with MOBAs. There are 3 lanes and fights are happening all over the map 

*""But the game is oriented around the synergy of attack, defense, tank and support! We can't be splitting teams up!""* 

So are MOBAs. The idea is you're supposed to know where your enemies are and react to where they're going. 

The important thing to note is I'm not suggesting that every map/game mode becomes like this. I'm just suggesting we add a bit more variety to the maps/game modes. Hence:

**My Idea:**

Hybrid maps are supposed to be both Assault and Escort right? Instead of making it just Assault first, then Escort, let's make it both Assault and Escort *at the same time*. One team escorts a payload from area X to area Z, and another team must secure area Y. The payload can only reach Z if Y is taken (it keeps the door open or something)

tl;dr: I wish the game didn't always just have 1 area where 1 giant fight happens, why not have 2 different areas that you have to be at so we have a bit more variety in what we can do every game?",Overwatch,We need maps that don't always feature a single area of contention,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4i2n7n/we_need_maps_that_dont_always_feature_a_single/

I just finished it last night and I really wish Colin/Greg would play it as I really want to hear what Greg in particular would have to say about it.

We all know he loves Persona 4. Trails of Cold Steel also does so many things that Persona 4 does, and in some ways it does it even better. The battle system in particular is far better. 

Where it really shines though is in places where Persona 4 also shines. Characters, and character development. Relationships between the characters. It's got a lot of those sweet memorable moments that just grip you. 

It's also just got a lot of smaller similar things, like a social-links, 'free time', school setting, the fast travel menu system, etc. 

If you're reading, Greg, play this game. It's so ridiculously underrated and underhyped

For instance - Skellige itself is pronounced 'Skell-e-ga', and Spikeroog is pronounced 'Speak-a-roog' It seems to me the Skelligans tend to clearly pronounce their vowels. 

Seems to me that Kaer Trolde really should be pronounced 'Kayre Troll-Duh'

I'm clearly nitpicking on a fictional language/accent but the Skelligans were based on real historic cultures (Vikings?) so the way words are pronounced ought to be at least based on something real. 

Then again, all languages are full of inconsistencies. Anyway, it's just something that I've been thinking about since I first heard it - That's the magic of this game really, I'm so balls deep in its lore that I'm even thinking about something as dull and meaningless as word pronounciation",witcher,Pronounciation of 'Kaer Trolde' and the Skelligan 'language',http://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/3c9ng2/pronounciation_of_kaer_trolde_and_the_skelligan/

My question is: Are they ever told afterwards that they were wrong? Do they have meetings with their supervisors where they are told they have been making wrong calls?

It's from the new Dissidia Final Fantasy game that's coming out for Arcade in Japan. 

Just imagine a Cloud vs Sephiroth battle where you get to fight like they did in Advent Children, navigating freely in 360 degrees of movement, dashing around with fully destructible environments 

Just think back to this: https://youtu.be/WyPlwtBTXpk?t=153 

We can literally have that in game now

I'm working on a (sort of) fighting game and need to write an input system that can handle multi player controls (2x game controllers - for multiplayer game sessions) but also be able to switch one (or both) of the 'players' into AI controlled players.

I just subscribed to Maya LT as the price has dropped down low enough now that I can justify having it even if I don't plan to use it all the time.

The other reason I got it was that the breadth of content and tutorial for Maya as far as I can see is by far the best for Maya than for any other 3D packages. Having said that those content are for Maya, and not Maya LT.

**tl;dr**: So is Maya LT similar enough to Maya that I should be able to follow along at least 80-90% of Maya tutorials comfortably? 

I understand some features are not available on LT - and that it can vary from tutorial to tutorial, but in terms of where everything is menu wise, keyboard shortcuts wise, etc, am I going to have a hard time?
