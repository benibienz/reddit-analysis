She seemed to think it was a Spanish invention but I can't remember what she called it.

30ml Sweet Vermouth
Top up with IPA
Garnish with Grapefruit rind

Not sure why, but it has a creamy mouthfeel that none of the single ingredients alone has.

51," No one would have believed, in the last years
of the nineteenth century, that human affairs were being
watched from the timeless worlds of space.

No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized, as
someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm
and multiply in a drop of water. Few men even considered 
the possibility of life on other planets and yet, across
the gulf of space, minds immeasurably superior to ours
regarded this Earth with envious eyes, 
and slowly and surely, they drew their plans against us.

At midnight, on the twelfth of August, a huge mass of
luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth.
Across two hundred million miles of void, invisibly hurtling
towards us, came the first of the missiles that were to
bring so much calamity to Earth. As I watched, there was
another jet of gas. It was another missile, starting on its way.

**And that's how it was for the next ten nights. 
A flare, spurting out from Mars - bright green,
drawing a green mist behind it - a beautiful,
but somehow disturbing sight. 
Ogilvy, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger.**

**He was convinced there could be no living thing,
on that remote, forbidding planet.**

'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million
to one,' he said.

&gt; Australia's first biscuit company was founded in 1854 by Thomas Swallow. Within five years he had taken in a partner, T.H. Ariell. After Ariell died in 1875, F.T. Derham was appointed partner and managing director in 1877, a position held by several generations of his descendants. By the early 1880s the Port Melbourne factory extended to 3 acres (1.2 ha), and the company owned flourmills and sugar plantations in the Goulburn Valley and Northern Queensland. With no equal outside Great Britain, Swallow &amp; Ariell was the fifth largest biscuit company in the world, manufacturing over 100 varieties, including the common ship biscuit (an original product) and meat biscuits (apparently taken by Burke and Wills on their ill-fated expedition). The company also boasted popular sideline products, including cakes, plum puddings, ice-cream and dried fruit. Renowned for its patriotic fundraising campaigns during both world wars, it diverted most of its biscuits and plum puddings to the Australian and US services in World War II. Company employees were filmed leaving work in 1905 in the Salvation Army film unit's first sponsored industrial documentary film. The surviving opening sequences are held by ScreenSound Australia. The company was delisted on 5 August 1964 following acquisition of more than 95% of its capital by the Australian Biscuit Co. The factory was later registered by the National Trust and converted into units.

404,"Tor or ""The Onion Router"" is an anonymity network. It is one of a number of networks which make up the deepweb or darknet.

Although it would be possible to use Tor for bittorrent, it would be less than optimal. The Tor network works by nodes encrypting and transporting between one another. This is very time insensitive. Yes your traffic will be anonymised, however it will be VERY slow as well.

Tor isn't optimised for large file downloads, so the issue of rights holders coming after OP is unlikely. More likely would be lower volume malicious traffic, (e.g.: hackers on SSH using Tor for anonymisation, botnet hearders, or child pornographers)

Not to say its beyond the realm of posibilities, but Tor isn't really used for what you are suggesting.

416,"Net Neutrality is about prioritising speed of delivery, not cost of delivery. iiNet (and all its subsidiaries which include Internode) offer unmetered access as they colocate with content mirrors specifically for Netflix. It is in iiNet's interest as they don't need to pay for transit links to America to cover the volume for their customer. (You could make a case that this is a form of net neutrality I guess, in that the traffic will be faster as it is colocated, and doen't need to traverse the Internet, only the iiNet core network, but I think that is a misnomer)

When you have ISP's shaping traffic (i.e.: reducing speeds) to certain sites, then you go into the field of Net Neutrality. That is when the ISP is making decisions on which traffic is more important than others (i.e.: rate shaping torrent traffic as opposed to HTTP) or when a company is attempting to squeeze a competitor (i.e.: in America where Comcast, who are a media company are rate limiting to competitors like Netflix, or blackmailing them to make them pay a premium to boost speeds)

What a company like iiNet is doing is value adding, not negatively impacting traffic flow.

Australias internet landscape is quite different to that of the United States or mainland Europe. If you want to read iiNets views on Net Neutrality, they can be found [here.](http://blog.iinet.net.au/net-neutrality-debate-rages/)

Transcontinental submarine links are significantly more expensive than fibre interconnects. Also considering the majority of content is hosted in the United States, large volumes of traffic are required to 
traverse these links. It is for this reason cost of internet traffic are higher for Australia. (Although CDN's like Akamai do reduce the amount of traffic required to transit these links, it doesn't guarantee traffic won't, and ISP's need to be able to cover these needs) 

I can also see a need for content shaping in a network in peak times. Traffic which is delay sensitive should be prioritised over traffic that isn't. HOWEVER this does not mean an ISP should use this to limit costs by not investing in enough transit (or backhaul, which is more often the bottleneck). However a company has to straddle having enough bandwidth free to support network use, but not so much to leave large amounts underutilised.

&gt; When he was still young, Read was already an accomplished street fighter and the leader of the Surrey Road gang. He began his criminal career by robbing drug dealers, based in massage parlours in the Prahran area. He later graduated to kidnapping and torturing members of the criminal underworld, often using a blowtorch or bolt cutters to remove the toes of his victims as an incentive for them to produce enough money so that Read would leave them alive.[1]

&gt; Read spent only 13 months outside prison between the ages of 20 and 38, having been convicted of crimes including armed robbery, firearm offences, assault, arson, impersonating a police officer and kidnapping.[2] While in Pentridge Prison's H division in the late 1970s, Read launched a prison war. His gang, dubbed ""The Overcoat Gang"" because they wore long coats all year round to conceal their weapons, were involved in several hundred acts of violence against a larger opposing gang during this period. Around this time, Read had a fellow inmate cut both of his (Read's) ears off in order to be able to leave H division temporarily. While in his early biographies Read claimed this was to avoid an ambush by other inmates, by being transferred to the mental health wing, his later works state that he did so to ""win a bet"".[citation needed] The nickname ""Chopper"" was given to him long before this, from a childhood cartoon character.[citation needed]

&gt; Read was ambushed and stabbed by members of his own gang in a sneak attack when they felt that his plan to cripple every other inmate in the entire division and win the gang war in one fell swoop was going too far. Another theory is that James ""Jimmy"" Loughnan, a longtime friend of Read, with Patrick ""Blue"" Barnes, wished to benefit from a contract put on Read's head by the Painters' and Dockers' Union. Read lost several feet of intestine in the attack.[3] At the time Read was serving a 16 and a half-year sentence after attacking a judge in an effort to get Loughnan released from prison.[4] Loughnan would later die in the Jika Jika fire at Pentridge in 1987.[5]

&gt; In 1992, Read was convicted of shooting Sidney Michael Edward Collins in the chest. The incident took place in Read's car, which was in the driveway of Collins's residence at Evandale, Tasmania. The bullet was recovered from the backseat of the vehicle, and Collins named Read as the shooter. Pleading not guilty, Read was found guilty of grievous bodily harm, a downgraded charge from attempted murder, and sentenced as a ""dangerous criminal"" to indefinite detention. He walked free early in 1998. In 2002, Read was again questioned over the disappearance of Sidney Collins, who is still on the Australian Missing Person list after going missing under suspicious circumstances. Read admitted to murdering Collins in his last broadcast interview before death on the Australian 60 Minutes program aired on 20 October 2013. Read rejected any sense of remorse for killing Collins alleging he was ""stupid"" for being shot by Read on two separate occasions with Collins's own gun.

&gt; Read claimed to be involved in the killing of 19 people and the attempted murder of 11 others. In an April 2013 interview with the New York Times, Read said ""Look, honestly, I haven't killed that many people, probably about four or seven, depending on how you look at it.""[6]

&gt; Read also spoke of his mid-1980s to early 1990s rivalry with Alphonse Gangitano in the TV series Tough Nuts. Read explained that he had a disagreement with Gangitano regarding an elderly neighbourhood hero whom Gangitano admired. It is alleged[by whom?] that Gangitano burst open the toilet cubicle door[where?] with a number of associates and began a serious assault on Read who made his escape but not before spreading his faeces into Gangitano's face.[7]",2015-06-30 04:15:45+00:00,csn7k9o,6.0,t1_csn7b9g,537.0,australia

450,"When you connect via HTTPS, the server (Google) and the client (your web browser) will determine which protocols they both speak so they can communicate.

HTTPS supports a number of different protocols these include SSL version 2 and 3 as well as. TLS version 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.

Many of these are considered cryptographically insecure and as a result the web server (Google) will not accept them, but they are configuredwithin the web server for backwards compatibility, but not accepted.

With the discovery of the POODLE vulnerability, web servers are much more stringent in the protocols which they will accept, as there is the possibility of a downgrade vulnerability.

For some reason you web browser is attempting to connect using a non cryptographically secure protocol.

Check that TLS 1.1 and above is supported and this issue should not reoccur.

If gay marriage was legal and on the books, and they turned around I could see your point.

Lets say that the ACT passed a law which instated Primae Noctis, a law which I am sure you would disagree with, and would truly benefit Tony Abbott (cause he gets to sleep with all the new brides in Canberra), this law would also get put before the High Court.
