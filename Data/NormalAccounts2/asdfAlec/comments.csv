Same with his version of the doc. He kept saying ""by my birthday"" and then he suddenly changed it to ""by Christmas.""

I really liked Jesse after the series ended. He seemed nice, his family was cool, everything was calm and relaxing and honest and genuine. 

Now, he's just trying too hard. It's either pranks, drama, clickbait, and the occasional role reversal (about the last thing on his channel I like). 

I'm at my wits end with Jesse. I have some faith that soon this will all be over and he'll move on, because he is good at telling stories (Rule 19, The G.A.M.E., Psycho Series, ect.) I just really don't like this story :(",2016-09-14 06:48:30+00:00,d7m4a49,1,t3_52p7cs,1465,McJuggerNuggets

As for the ""drama"" going on, I think it's great. He said in the video ""PSYCHO SERIES CHANNEL &amp; FUTURE OF MCJUGGERNUGGETS"" that he wanted to wait until Fall to release BTS, so people got mad at him, so now Brian is the reason Jesse can't release BTS.

86,"I have to side with Brian with this one. As much as I loved the Psycho Series and the people who were involved with it, Jesse does seem to be ""freaking out"" (to quote Brian) about things that seem pretty standard when making a film. To be honest, excluding providing a temporary place for Jesse to live for a week, Aunt Jackie never really had any major roles in the series, and I'm sure her interview in the documentary wasn't as astounding as Jesse's playing it up to be. Plus, I'm almost positive the documentary will have plenty of Jesse's dad. Plus, I agree with Brian that making a feature length film is much more difficult than Jesse and his family thinks. I believe Jesse's finished documentary (if they finish it, which I doubt they will) will be rushed, plus I think he's forgetting the fact that if he releases his own doc, he'll be releasing the BTS in it, and royally, legally fucking himself. 

And that's all I have to say about that. ",2016-09-10 05:04:55+00:00,d7gmyoa,1,t3_520y4o,11792,McJuggerNuggets

90,"Episode 6: Everything is quiet and solemn. Everybody from the series (excluding) Jesse is at the funeral. As the service goes on, you can hear the beep of the backhoe in the distance. Suddenly, Jesse bursts in on the back hoe. Head shaved bald, laughing like a maniac. He uses the backhoe to crush Psycho Dad's casket, then his dad would proceed to haunt him into another haunted series.
