Corn was the perfect cameraman for recording what was needed while also maintaining the silence of a friend awkwardly watching his other friend's life fall to shit. 



Parker was brought in to record ""real life"" vlogs, which Jesse has countlessly expressed boredom towards. He needed a cameraman who could not only keep a conversation going, but also one who will be interactive, engaging, comical, and also dedicated. Although Parker has only been in a few videos, he has already managed to accomplish all of those things. He and Jesse have very good chemistry, and I personally enjoy his style of humor.
