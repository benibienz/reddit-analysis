And since it was so flat bottomed it was inpossible to keep pointed straight in any wind higher than 2 or 3 mph. I mean if you fish in a place where wind and waves dont exist then by all means this kayak is perfect! Thats why i went and got that perception. And its incredibly stable, cuts through waves like butter, and takes wind like a champ.

416,"(Legit True Story) I once chopped down a tree. First time all on my own, and this was a big fucker. I decided that to establish dominance over my aging father, i wasnt going to use the chainsaw, jsut the old, dull, rusty axe. This tree was at least 45 tall, with a base around 40"" across. I swung the axe into it, deep for the first time. I got excited, and each swing grew stronger. Slowly but surely getting my way through. The axe blade growing more dull with every swing. Around 80% of the way through, i realize how badly i wanted this moment captured on tape. So i gave my mom my phone, showed her how to hit record. Now im on film, gotta show off the guns now. Started going ape-shit on that fucker. I was swinging harder and faster than ever before. I was a mad man, on a mission. I grew closer and closer. 90%. 95%. 97%. 99%. I thought this is it. This is my big finish. I was drenched in sweat from the 99°f, 90% humidity South Florida Sunshine. I took my last swing with the most intensity ive ever put into anything in my life. It cut through and the trunk began to groan. Suddenly a gust of wind hit it just right, and it began to sway, and crack, and sway, and crack more. When finally, after jumping out of the way, the tree falls the exact direction we were aiming for, and it was awesome. I reveled in the moment, and fueled by testosterone and adrenaline, i raised up the axe with one hand and did my best war yell. It felt amazing. Afterwards after cleaning everything up, i ask my mom to see my awesome video. She had me axing the tree for like 5 minutes straight. Dead on, perfect shot. As soon as it gets to the last 2 hits, apparantly she forgot about filming and looked up to watch the tree fall, and moved her hands down. So for the last 30 seconds of it chopping through, of the tree falling, you hear a thump, you hear me war cry, and it pans up to me walking away and the tree on the ground. Way to go mom. Now how am i going to post this to facebook and get likes? /s",2016-04-26 04:11:43+00:00,d2hj5eu,6.0,t1_d2hgiu9,4246.0,videos

We drove all the way there, we ginally get to the mountain we were going to be staying at, we get a call saying my grandmother had an accident and hit her head, and is unconcious. Tl;DR it turns out she has a traumatic brain injury. So were worried about her for our entire vacation, we get home, find out our house got broken into while we were gone, we drove up to find the front door wide open and all of our shit gone with everything flipped and tossed around. We then find out about a week later that my grandpa on my moms side has stage 4 esophageal cancer, and that it had spread to his lymph nodes. Due to carelessness at the hospital my grandma was at, she developed an infection inside her organs because they had accidentally ripped out her feeding tube, even though her memory and everything was getting so much better, she died from complications with the infection. A week later, my grandpa died from the cancer. The entire time i was surrounded by pastors and ministers (my family is pretty religious), telling me that everything happens for a reason, and its all part of gods plan.

768,"Think of everything in relative terms. Yes a composer will write in loud on the music. But loud according to who? One section thinks 50% is loud enough but the conductor is in the front hearing the entire orchestra as a whole, and decides that to balance the sound, that the trumpet section is playing too softly and needs to be at 90% loudness to balance it, so he motions to them that he wants more from them. Also, yes these are professional musicians, yes they all have immaculate timing at keeping pace, but humans can make mistakes. As an 8 year long musician, it is very easy to fall out of time. Even as a whole all it takes is one section to start dragging, and the section next to them picks up on it and starts dragging too. Now all of a sudden half the orchestra is playing too slow making everything out of sync with the other side. If you have one main source of information for time, that everybody can watch, and follow. Then everybody will be on the same page. If not its very easy for everything to go out of whack.",2016-02-07 04:46:07+00:00,czqrb6y,6.0,t1_czqqfpw,1739.0,videos
