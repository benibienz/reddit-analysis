Just a little backstory of our current situation. My girlfriend is 19, im 21. Im basically the boyfriend that treats her like a queen, people tell her all the time they wish they had a boyfriend like me. I do so much for her. She usually has her moments during times of bad stress. Right now things for us are kind of a shit show. Were supposed to be moving in 2 weeks, and the people we were supposed to be renting from fucked us over and sold the house out from under us. She already has her job transfer set up and now we have nowhere to live. Shes been working alot, and ive been working alot to make sure we have more than enough money as a backup. Shits scary right now. Were both stressing over the same things. The biggest issue is she gets super irrational when she feels her anxiety coming on and theres basically no alking to her, or convincing her any differently from how she feels. But today she was talking to me telling me how stressed out she is over everything and how scared she is of not finding a place. I tried reassuring her and reminding her of what little we do have going for us. And she basically just starts attacking me, saying that i dont give a shit about the situation because she has more to lose (bad home life), telling me that im not helping her as far as finding a place (ive been doing as much as i can given that i work 12 hours a day). And at first i try just taking it, and just gently reminding her how much ive been doing to help, and that i would help more if i wasnt working so much. And she basically gets even more upset. Being more aggressive with her accusations, which upsets me, and i tell her gently (never raise my voice or say anything against her directly), that i dont appreciate the way shes accusing me of these things when she knows how much ive been doing for us. At this point shes crying and telling me that im attacking her and just making her feel worse. I try telling her that im not attacking her, and i understand how much shes going through, and how scared she is but that she shouldnt be bringing me down because were both stressing iver the same things. At this point shes hardcore crying, and screaming at me to stop, just stop, that im giving her an attack and that m being mean and unfair to her. I just dont know how to handle situations like this. Like i try to be as understanding as i can, but i cant handle constant unending attacks without getting upset and offended by them. I never ever turn it around and try attacking her, because obviously thats no way to defuse the situation, but theres only so much i can take before i start getting mad. This is a pretty common problem with us, and she just tells me how bad i am for not being understanding of her anxiety issues, and that im horrible at handling her situations. I just dont know what to do in situations like this.

I was using half of a little snapper i caught as bait, on a ocean rod, with a penn fierce 6000 reel, with 40 lb braid, and a steel leader at the end. The reel performed amazingly and held its own, this was my first time catching anything big on it. It was about a 5 minute fight before i got it close to me. It was a 5 foot nurse shark. It was so awesome, id never been so excited before! We were on rocks about 3 feet above the water, and the shark was still very energetic so we werent going to risk pulling it out for a picture like that. We decided to let it swim around to try and tire it out so we could pull it out, but he eventually shook the hook out after a good 3 or 4 minutes like that. I didnt care though, i was so happy and so excited. After that it was my buddys turn, same set up, new steel leader. This time the spool starts screaming, i mean twice as hard as mine, even with the drag cranked up he was still taking line out fast, i thought he was going to spool it. This guy was insanely strong. Much more so than mine. Then all of a sudden, all the tension was off. We were bummed a little, we thought the line snapped, but when we got to the end, we actually saw that the fucker CHEWED THROUGH THE STEEL CABLE. This guy had to be a monster, were guessing a 6-7' nurse. It was so awesome, just seeing that gave us shivers. We both caught our fishing bug again hardcore.
