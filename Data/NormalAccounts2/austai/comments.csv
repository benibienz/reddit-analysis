From http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/in-depth/car-seat-safety/art-20043939

""The safest place for your child's car seat is the back seat, away from active air bags. If the car seat is placed in the front seat and the air bag inflates, it could hit the back of a rear-facing car seat â€” right where your child's head is â€” and cause a serious or fatal injury. A child who rides in a forward-facing car seat could also be harmed by an air bag.

If it's necessary for a child to travel in a vehicle with only one row of seats, deactivate the front air bags or install a power switch to prevent air bag deployment during a crash.

If you're placing only one car seat in the back seat, install it in the center of the seat â€” if a good fit is possible â€” rather than next to a door to minimize the risk of injury during a crash.""

Edit: Found this http://thecarseatlady.com/using-latch-in-the-center-overview/. Interesting.
