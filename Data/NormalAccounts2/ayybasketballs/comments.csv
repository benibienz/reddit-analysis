Do you have to go 4K? 1440p ultrawide is imo a much better gaming experience. For either however your budget is too low as you need at least 2 980tis to drive either at high or ultra settings. for 1440p ultrawide at medium settings a single 980ti should be capable of driving it. I've gone with a 850W PSU and an SLI capable motherboard so you will be able to upgrade to SLI 980tis in the future, or wait for the new generation of GPUs.",2016-05-02 03:00:59+00:00,d2p7k4f,1.0,t3_4hdlyj,1708,buildapcforme

If you downgrade a couple parts you can go dual GPU now. Of course if you really want the i7 just have a single GPU for now and upgrade later, but what really is unnecessary is the CPU cooler, RAM, and PSU. The NH-D15 is one of the best air coolers out there, and it is definetly not a ""light overclock"" cooler. For your light OC, the H7 will be more than fine. Even though 32gb of RAM may seem tempting, its highly unnecessary. I have never ever even used over around 12gb of ram while playing games and listening to music and having web browsers open at the same time. 1200W PSU is even more unnecessary. You only need 1200W for triple SLI or crossfire, definetly not 2-way.",2016-04-12 06:40:28+00:00,d1ziwtv,1.0,t3_4eevou,1450,buildapc

I strongly recommend spending an extra £15 to get the 950, it'll last you much longer. The pentium is also on the newest skylake LGA 1151 socket which should allow you to easily upgrade to an i5 or even i7 in the future.",2016-04-05 13:29:48+00:00,d1qn2d2,1.0,t3_4dgc64,1130,buildapc
232,Just go for the single fan card. The 950 runs extremely cool and doesnt need some kind of amazing dual fan cooler to cool it. Its cheaper than the other 2 as well.,2016-04-05 13:25:29+00:00,d1qmwwh,1.0,t3_4dg49c,4555,buildapc

Easily upgradable system, the cpu can be upgraded all the way up to a high end i7-6700, you can upgrade ram up to 16gb by adding 8gb stick. The pentium however should be more than enough for csgo and h1z1 for now and the video card should be able to handle modern AAA titles at decent settings.",2016-03-04 07:27:37+00:00,d0n47pm,1.0,t3_48wcmx,974,buildmeapc

Reuse your RAM, cpu cooler, case and HDD. I've also included an SSD which will greatly improve boot up time and game loading time. I highly suggest this, however you did state that you want a new monitor as well, in that case remove the SSD and power supply (dont do too much overclocking in the meantime) and you should have more than enough for a new monitor.",2016-03-04 01:59:39+00:00,d0mthzh,1.0,t3_48v84m,279,buildapcforme

fury x will scale a lot better than 980ti. even then it wont be able to drive 4k. acer 34inch ultrawide is great gaming monitor, freesync and 75hz. you can always go for a cheaper ssd (m.2). 6700k is also really expensive right now so i suggest you buy when it's at least under $350.",2016-02-07 04:12:18+00:00,czqqac8,1.0,t3_44ju60,1454,buildapcforme

2. I'm sure a 850w is great for overclocking 2 980tis!

4. Super dooper motherboard? Probably the cheapest motherboard that supports SLI that i could find. Unless you're getting an nvme ssd, i dont see the point of m.2.

5. Yeah i'd hope it would create a bbq. My 390s only got 2 degrees hotter when I put them in CF (msi twin frozr)

Note that ive gone with a blower cooler gtx 970 instead of a standard one. Blower coolers generally work better inside small cases due to exhausting the heat straight outside the back and not back into the case.

Z170 motherboard is so you can overclock in the future just by adding a CPU cooler (i5-6500 can be OCd), GTX 970 from MSi is a great GPU for resolutions up to 1440p, as you wanted a nvidia GPU. If you are willing to switch to AMD, the r9 390 is slightly faster. the 8gb ram is easily upgradeable to 16gb. 750w PSU is there incase you wish to add another GTX 970 in SLI, which is why ive gone for a Z170 board and SLI capable board. 


For windows, i suggest you ""ask"" some people on how to get it for cheap ;)
