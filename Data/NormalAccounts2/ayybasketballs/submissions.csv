Edit: Traded for GMK carbon w/ novelties 1:1


[TIMESTAMP](http://imgur.com/a/742cH)

&amp;nbsp;

Hey everyone,

I've had this set of Carbon SA for a month or so that was bought from another redditor a while ago. The set itself is in almost new condition with barely any shine (in terms of SA at least). Even though I found myself staring at it and admiring it for hours on end I never really used it at all. The set also comes with a spare 1.75u shift from a grab bag.

&amp;nbsp;

Right now I am mostly interested in trades for **OTHER** **KEYSETS**. I **don't** want any artisans. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am specifically looking for:

- GMK Carbon w/ Novelties (1:1)

- GMK 9009 (1:1)

- DSA Skull Squadron (? idk what its worth)

- DSA Hyperfuse (I add $150)

- Other interesting keysets

&amp;nbsp;

Please comment below before PMing. Also note that I am in Australia, not the US. Shipping will cost more.

Cheers :)

Background: Well, I had some money in my PayPal and was bored so I went on eBay and decided to see if I could build a cheap web browsing pc for $100 AUD at all. 



Motherboard: I started off with the motherboard. I had some problems finding anything mini-itx under $80 unless it was a 15 year old VIA CPU with 256mb of RAM, but after some foraging I found the jackpot. A LGA 775 mITX motherboard externally powered using a DC power brick and supported Core 2 Quad CPUs. It also came with a CPU heatsink, which was quite nice. All for just $15. What a deal. 



CPU: I then went on an adventure for the CPU. I was originally thinking of buying a cheap $5 C2D but found a low power C2Q instead for a measly $25. Snagged it right away, and that was the CPU. 



Others: For the RAM the motherboard supports 800mhz ddr2 sodimm ram. I went ahead and found 2x2 sticks, so 4gb total ram. More than enough for general web browsing, emailing and 720p video playback. The motherboard came with integrated graphics so I didn't need a GPU. (would have taken up too much space anyways.) It took me a while to find the power requirements of the DC jack on the motherboard, but eventually I found a detailed page on a chinese forum (thank lord I can understand chinese) and found out you could use a 19V toshiba laptop AC adapter. Finally, the storage. I thought a small size SSD would be perfect for the build, so back onto eBay i went. Found a guy trying to get rid of his horrible 120GB Kingston V300 for just $30. Yes it's a shit SSD. But it's still extremely fast for web browsing and general use. And for $30, you can't complain. Then came the LEGO case. I spent a nice rainy afternoon building my case from LEGO i had in my giant pile in the corner. It took me around 3 hours to get it to the way I wanted it to, but I think that everything turned out great and I think it looks pretty darn good for a LEGO case too. It plays 720p video (monitor is 1366x768), can open a heap of chrome tabs without lagging, and starts up applications in a dash. For $100, I don't think you can get much better. 


In the future, I might upgrade the mobo+cpu+ram to a more modern Pentium J1900 (also integrated CPU), which might allow me to play some basic games as well as the integrated GPU on the motherboard is quite shit.",buildapc,[Build Complete] $100 LEGO Mini Web Browsing PC,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/43irtg/build_complete_100_lego_mini_web_browsing_pc/

This was a build I had been contemplating for months, and started out as an upgrade from an aging i7-920. At first I had only bought a Z170-AR and a i7-6700k, but as I started playing some newer AAA titles I realised my GTX 960 wasn't exactly up to task. Then came the next upgrade of my new case- the Fractal Define S. It was a great case, but I felt like it was a couple cm too short for my desk. (i know...) I kept on looking around, and found the ultimate case. The Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ATX - IMO the best ATX case out there today. So I started ordering WC parts, and also got in contact with a friend that was willing to sell me his r9 290x waterblock and backplate both for only $80 AUD. The parts all arrived, and sat on my desk for a couple weeks as I couldn't make up my mind. I ended up purchasing a new motherboard as well (Gigabyte Z170X-Gaming 7) as I couldn't stand the poo brown PCB of the Z170-AR and also loved the look of the new board. So the board and case arrived, and I finally got to work assembling the WC loop. Everything went fairly smoothly, and it looks great.


The SSDs and PSU are from my previous build. Yes, I know it's overkill for this build, but I was running CF HD 7950s on the previous machine.


But - Would I do it again? Probably not. I feel like the effort, time, and money that went into the project was not worth it and an AIO and quality air-cooled card could have provided similar results. But in the end, at least it looks nice. After all, A E S T H E T I C &gt; performance amirite?

-Rendering station

-NOT A NAS, I already have one with 4x 500gb drives built from dad's old c2duo pc.

Which one of these would make the most out of the parts? (I'll list them below) Of course I would get a couple new hard drives as a single 120gb ssd is a bit far from enough. 

I would also be interested in what I could use it for (I do quite a bit of video and photography, and I travel quite a bit).
