193,Wyverns aren't very good till higher cb. I recommend doing barrows. After you have a couple mill from barrows start putting it towards range and magic. Iron knives at sand crabs till 75 then 75-80 blowpipe at nmz. For magic you can alch till 80 then at 80 stun alch to 85. Once you hit 85-90 in melee stats or 80 range with void that's when you do wyverns.,2016-05-26 02:35:36+00:00,d3jxztb,,t1_d3jxgmm,849,2007scape
