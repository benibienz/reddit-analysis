First time ever building a pc, buy all my parts, everything is ready. I finish building it after about 3 hours and this was during the beginning of August. My fans aren't spinning, I don't know what to do. Asked my cousins friend to come and rebuild it for me. Found out I didn't make a standoff for the motherboard and I had some wires not hooked up. So then we take it to my room to test it out. Everything powers up but there is no display through dvi or hdmi on the gpu. BIOS pulls up on integrated graphics and we went through every setting to try and figure it out. We decide it's probably the video card so I sent it back. A week later instead of sending me a new card they just refund me. I was confused so I talked to customer support and they said they can't put me on a backlog. I waited for 3 weeks total for it to come back in stock. Nope didn't come in stock even once and it was just some r9 380 on newegg. Decided to just spend $45 extra and get this card. This is now in the middle of September. I get the card and put it in my motherboard. No display again... I figure it must be my motherboard but it's out of warranty. Have to spend another $60 on that. Motherboard gets hear, I completely rebuild the computer but nothing turns on now, no lights, fans, nothing. At this point I'm so annoyed, sad, and pissed off with this computer. I hit my cousins friend up again and he gives me like 7 steps. None of those work so I bring it to him. Turns out my PSU was just being weird and he shook it and everything comes on. Get the computer back yesterday and now my hard drive disk isn't showing up. Ended up having to take my old hdd out of my old computer and replacing it. Then I'm trying to install windows 10 but it's giving me an error about it has a mbr partion. After an hour of trying to figure it out I just went to bed. Wake up, go to school, get back from work. Turn on my computer and launched cmd up from the windows installation menu thing. End up accidentally formatting my usb drive with windows 10 on it. So I had to wait till 11:00pm for my internet to go above 15kbps since I have satellite and we have some type of unrestricted internet after 11:00pm till 5:00am. Waited for the internet modem to restart, attempt to download it on my mac but it's an exe file and I couldn't be bothered downloading wine. Then I grab my moms laptop and it says the disk only has 200mb of data on it even though it's supposed to have 4gb. I reformat it again and now it's giving me a error code saying something like 'Please insert removable disk (D:)'. Look online and nothing worked to fix it. Now I'm sitting here just ready to tear this shit apart.

I was pretty nooby to the game still (started right before restricted trade) but my favorite skill was woodcutting. So here I am chopping maples at 59 woodcutting trying to get 60 over in seers village to chop those dank yew trees. I decided since people have 99 parties why don't I throw a level 60 party! That's what I did, I found 3 people in seers village and I said I'd give them each 5k. They follow me as I walk a little bit north to a lone maple tree and I cut it down. Bam 60 woodcutting! Too bad the phone rang right as they were wishing me congrats on my astounding achievement. There went the internet and I was so upset because I couldn't give these people their well deserved 5k. I rushed to my aunt and told her I needed her to get off the phone. Of course that didn't work but after she finally hung up I hopped straight back on only to find one guy left. I kept apologizing over and over and I gave him his 5k. I asked him where the other guys went, he said he didn't know and they were upset. I never got to give them their 5k.

Back before EoC I was quite young and didn't really train stats or do quests. So now I have my account 'Thu' and have no clue what to do. I recently wanted to try out rs3 instead of just playing osrs. I attempted to play today and swapped some gp over but I have no clue what to do. I'm sitting here with 20m cash in full mithril armor and no clue where to start. I know everything about osrs if that helps any.

tl;dr Basically have the knowledge of 2001-2007 runescape and need help advancing through the game.",runescape,"Haven't played runescape in awhile, need help",https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/3odwns/havent_played_runescape_in_awhile_need_help/
