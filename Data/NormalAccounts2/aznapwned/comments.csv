For the general population (around low gold), Zen shotcalling his orbs is a basic necessity since at that level you're not going to have dedicated shotcallers. High diamond &amp; up, whether or not your Zen needs to call out his orbs is up to debate depending on your team's playstyle.

Just because you couldn't choose what happened doesn't mean you lost your immersion. Just because the VN didn't go the way you expected with its choices doesn't mean your immersion was broken. If anything, not being interrupted with choices kept me more immersed in the VN because it played out like a movie/novel where the story unfolded without an abrupt stops. From an interactive, game perspective though, I could see why you'd be upset that Alternative left practically no impactful choices in regards to the ending. But I guess the creators wanted to end it with a canon ending and none other. Plus, ever since Sumika was introduced as a character in Alternative, it was pretty clear which heroine was going to be chosen and the story didn't sudden push you onto her. 

Sure, Meiya received a lot more interaction with Takeru, but how could she have not if Sumika wasn't introduced until much later on? The story was designed with this purpose as far as I know. Meiya is supposed to be the tragic heroine who, at the end of the day, was unable to receive the things she truly wished for. We do love Meiya more than Sumika, but that doesn't mean everything we love turns out well in the end, especially for such a tragic story. The VN was designed in this way for us to feel bad for her in the end.

Also, he only really kept his memory from one of his loops. He did not discover the fact that he had died many times before until much later on.

64,"I agree with you. 

Sumika not being a part of Unlimited (unless you count the brain) makes complete sense story-wise, and if she was included in Unlimited from the start simply to make the reader have more connectable screentime with her would change the story drastically.

Also, I don't believe she was a forced romantic choice for Takeru at all. He helped MLA version of her because he cared about her. The fact that he ends up falling in love of her through this assistance is his choice. And although he may have well been tasked to become acquainted with MLA Sumika, his romantic feelings were justified. He fell in love with real world Sumika for good reasons as well and those reasons transferred to MLA Sumika. I'm not exactly certain on how all this was delivered, but his feelings for her were far from forced.",2016-05-17 10:25:39+00:00,d38mgv3,2.0,t1_d38mdas,363.0,visualnovels

Cuarto: This is the one I lived in Freshman year and to be honest it is not that bad as people say. Pros include: (1) having your own personal common area and bathroom shared between anywhere from 4-6 people (the bathroom is cleaned on a biweekly basis), (2) pretty good DC food with REAL ice cream and shorter lines that any of the other two DC's, close distance to some local grocery stores like Trader Joe's, and having a communal pool. Cons include: a slightly farther distance from campus (~2-4 minutes extra biking to get onto the main campus), less socialization due to the layout of the dorms (most of my friends I've made through clubs and classes instead), and possibly bad suitemates that you cannot personally pick. Keep in mind I lived in one of the worser dorms in Cuarto (Webster).
