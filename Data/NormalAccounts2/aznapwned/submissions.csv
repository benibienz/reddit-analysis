My roommates &amp; I (7 total) are looking to sign up for Comcast's Blast Pro internet-only plan (200 MBPS download &amp; 10 MBPS upload for $59.99) soon for our new apartment, &amp; we we're looking for recommendations for modems + routers for that plan that aren't too expensive for college students. Overall, looking to spend less than $200 for both combined. Please tell me if you think this would be too little to spend.

Some of us game &amp; pratically all of us stream video if that makes a difference to know.

Also, is it ever a good idea to buy a second router (so one for upstairs &amp; downstairs)?

Thank you!

EDIT: Here are the ones we're planning to buy. Please let me know what you think!
