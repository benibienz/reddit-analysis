From /u/Rebirdhk 

On the Control Center map of Lijiang Tower, the name ""宏宇"" (Hongyu) is added to one of the space suit on the red side.
The phrase ""英雄不朽"" (Heroes never die) is also added to the background behind it. 


This is to honor the death of a young Chinese Overwatch player, Hongyu Wu (吴宏宇), who unfortunately sacrificed his life when he bravely chased after a motorbike thief on the 23th of May, 2016.


The criminal was arrested eventually, but we lost a brave young soul forever.
May he rest in peace.
