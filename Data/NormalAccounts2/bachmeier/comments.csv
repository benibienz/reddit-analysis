&gt; I want to point out that communities are increasingly using Slack, and many of them are also in the thousands of users. Slack does nothing to discourage this, aside from posting warnings about archiving messages.

&gt; The real problem is that they have an undocumented user limit. Like I said, I'm pretty sure we're the first community to hit this limit.

&gt; Big online courses, for example, routinely draw 100,000s of students, and might make the same mistake we did (Harvard's CS50 class did).

&gt; Slack may be able to fix its sluggishness for these other communities, and someone might build integrations that routinely export then delete messages so as to stay below the 10,000 message limit and remove the warnings. But it's too late for us. We can't pause our community growth while we wait for Slack to engineer around their undisclosed user limit. So we have no alternative but to switch.

So you understand my point then. It's a serious thing when you vote to close a question.

93,"The main problem with the site for years has been a lack of checks and balances on the high reputation users. Most of them are good, but a small percentage use the power they've been given to vandalize the site. The problem is that they can act however they want with no negative consequences. A few ideas for how that can be fixed:

* Three votes to close questions that are later reopened means you are suspended from the site for 30 days.
* Put info by the question as soon as someone has voted to close it, and an option to vote to not close it. Add a waiting period before closing so that others have a chance to argue.
* Hide users' points. That will make others less reluctant to downvote something or to comment on their rudeness.
* Automatic 30-day suspension for making rude comments to new users.
* 30-day suspension for marking something as a duplicate if it's not. That noise gets old fast. And for the life of me, I can't figure out why that crap never gets removed.
* 30-day suspension for requesting further information about something that's already in the question, or more generally for anything that indicates you're commenting but haven't bothered to read the question.

Downvotes don't much affect high reputation users (even in the few cases that they currently happen) but giving them a timeout will keep them in line, just as it does with a six year old, or at least it will prevent them from further vandalizing the site.
