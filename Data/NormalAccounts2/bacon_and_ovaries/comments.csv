1200,"At the risk of you not liking my critism... it seems you think no one's listening because we aren't applauding your shield idea. 5E is simplified. The armor is the way it is because there is specific balances to how it affects your Dex bonuses vs your AC. Accounting for light, medium, and heavy proficiencies, which prevent wizards running around in full-plate, allows ranger and bards to decide on speed over protection in their equipment, as well as armor limitations like druids using no metal...etc. So yes it stands to be varied.

The shield's are super simplified; you either get a big piece of metal, which is heavy but high protection so a -2 to dex, while being +4 to AC, which averages to +2 on your sheet. Or it's light, allowing +2 AC.  While variables could have been added, and made it complicated, they found a shiny median. it really is designed easier to simply slap on +2.

1206,"Don't they? They want to feel normal. Not society's normal. Not a genders normal. Their normal. They don't fit their body. They are genetically incorrect for what their mind wants them to be. 

So, they are unhappy being their gender. They feel wrong. They decide they hate their penis, breasts testicales vagina, because they don't feel like it's what they should have. It's a simple example I portrayed, but I think when they feel wrong their whole life, trapped in that husk of the wrong gender, or so they think....

So they make the changes. Outside of the difficulty with the faux Pau society makes it, what if that wasn't what was wrong? That they need psychological help as well but they think it MUST be the gender. And they make this drastic change, and it's not normal afterward. They still feel off. What do you do then? 

Most suicidal people try to make a very drastic change before an attempt, hoping it's the thing they needed to feel OK...but when they notice that the haircut, shaving, the clothes, the drugs, the alcohol doesn't make them happy...why wouldn't they possibly take their lives feeling like they have no other way to feel normal?

I don't see how bad it would be to push a little to see how badly they want to fix things, or if they simply take the fast money. Druggies want money. Laziness doesn't want to learn, they want free stuff. Someone who wants to succeed from the bottom will rise given the chance.

My advice. Leave her alone. Move on like she's asked and focus on you. Don't chase her again. Even if she messages you just say hi, talk about light things and don't discuss anything relationship related. Let her make all the moves.

1941,"Contracting aids usually boils down to a choice. It's either unsafe sex with an untested partner, unsafe sex with a cheating partner, or unsafe drug use. VERY rarely is it contracted outside of these by accidental exposure, or contamination.

 Skin color or race itself is not a factor, but what is evident to me by this, is excessive risky behavior. If this is happening more in black gay communities, it speaks of other possible risky behaviors outside of sex. The most bizarre part of this is anyone who isn't black or gay mentioning this risk would simply be called racist or homophobic and that's where the communication breaks down.

 Ultimately, dating as a black gay man must be nerve wracking. Considering 25% of the dating pool is possibly infected",2015-10-25 15:35:16+00:00,cwc8bm2,1.0,t3_3q44m4,40963.0,todayilearned

If you two can't compromise, and your health is a concern, then sadly on a physical level you two are incompatible. He likes what he likes, you dislike what you dislike, and both are seemingly un-negotiable.
