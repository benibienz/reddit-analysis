While I'm not a very skilled player, I've had great results with the slow new meta with this deck. However I'm hoping for some feedback.

The card choices were based off control warrior,and just to use some of the new cards to increase our survival. While also being standard legal.

**Execute**: cheap removal that uses our combos damage minions like ravaging ghoul and cthuns disciple to remove threats.

**shield slam**: effective late game removal as well as flexible enough with the shifting meta to destroy new legendaries and bombs.

**Fiery win axe**: its in the name. Removing early game threats is a must to maintain tempo. This is also our only weapon.

**bash** with the slow meta shift, most minions can be removed with this, or combos with other damage to remove the minions.

**shield block** I'm not sure about this one, but if we're running shield slams I figure the armor is nice early boon in the slow games. And that final push to remove late game threats.

**brann bronze beard** this deck is all about battle cries. This guy helps us clear small minions with ravaging ghoul, remove a single 4 minion with extra value with disciple...my personal favorite is on turn 10, paired with ancient shield bearer for a whopping 20 armor turn with 6/6 body. And if not removed can be comboed into c'thun for a massive push or even a second shield bearer to seal the win through fatigue.

**disciple of c'thun** 2 damage to ping for execute, pop a divine shield, that little extra reach your FWA can't clean off. Paired with a 2/1 body and a 2/2 Cthun boost to get that massive armor drop.

**Ravaging ghoul** a 3/3 body on tempo that can remove left over minions or kill tokens? Also a threat that can compete with most turn 3 minions with the ping.

**c'thuns chosen** this is our shredder. It's sticky, got that high threat 4 damage, and can't be killed by a single source usually. Also buffs cthun.

**Brawl** :this is the panic button. I've added two to surprise people who got to use to only seeing one. This may shrink to 1 as the meta speeds up.

**Big game hunter**: well, he's here in case we missed something on the brawl, and with the recent nerf he's still a surprise. Usually best when your hand is low.

**Crazed worshipper** cthun boosting taunt? Yes please. Like an acolyte of pain the enemy is too worried to hack him down, so at the very least he eats up a big hit.

**Justicar trueheart** :more armor. Need more armor!

**Sylvanas** Yogg, C'thun...and shes just sitting there to play catch and steal something. Also a fair drop to follow with brawl on the next turn.

**The black knight** : dark arakkoas, twin emperor veklor, this guy always finds a fresh target.

**Ancient shieldbearer:** this is the one. While a 5/5 body with 5 armor was a staple in the wild version, this one shines bright with a massive ten armor to shield slam something into oblivion and survive the next onslaught. Also insane with brann for 20 armor instead on turn 10.

**Twin emperor veklor** two taunts for one? And we're already playing cthun? Why not? 

**Soggoth the slitherer** I pulled him from a pack, and so far with silences being sparce, this guy is finding huge value in soaking up minions, and baiting mass removals. Leaving turn 10 usually wide open.

**Cthun** well we added all those worshippers for a reason. This guy clears, he kills, and with the other huge threats in the deck more often than not they are out of removals.

Any advice or feedback is appreciated.
Thanks for reading.

My issue is, why is my captain black aromatic so much more pleasureable to smoke than my more expensive Orlik? Has anyone else had this issue where the higher rated tobaccos seem to pale in comparison to cheaper ones? Is it the difference in one being an aromatic and one not? Am I smoking it incorrectly?
