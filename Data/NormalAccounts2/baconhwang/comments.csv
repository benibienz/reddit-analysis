79,"Seba is officially now a mainstay name in jazzhop. He molded a very niche genre and helped bring it to a bigger audience by creating some amazing pieces of music that really create a tone and atmosphere. Like /u/mucus said, a mood. While I'm not going to pretend that I like every song off of Modal Soul, Nujabes' most popular album really left a mark on me in many ways. I think the popularity of Feather and Luv(sic) pt. 3 transcended the usual Nujabes fans and introduced the genre to the ears of many who had never heard jazzhop before. And yes, many artists such as Kondor, Ta-Ku, DJ Okawari, LJones, and the like have tried to imitate Nujabes' sound to the best of their musical ability, but Seba had a gift for making music that cannot be perfectly replicated. What I think Nujabes excelled in was pouring soul into his music. You can feel the artist's effort into making something that he truly loved to produce and I really think about that every time I listen to a Nujabes track.

223,"To be fair, Splatoon is a great and wildly creative game. There's no denying that. But Mario Maker is a questionable one. It's just allowing people to edit Mario levels for themselves. There's no creativity to that. It's selling well, but I don't think it took Nintendo much effort on their part to produce it.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I just expected a little more from Nintendo's usual hits. Although they're just spinoffs, Animal Crossing and Mario Tennis has always done well in their creative and selling aspects. Maybe not on par with their main Mario line, but at least allowing people to have a great time with these games. These new additions look honestly terrible. I'm leaving Yoshi's Woolly World out now because that's another topic for another day. Mario Tennis, Animal Crossing, and Mario Party have all gone to crap with their latest installments, and it's really sad that Nintendo has allowed for this to happen to some of their most unique spinoffs.",2015-11-20 20:42:09+00:00,cx7acvo,4.0,t1_cx79thf,830,amiibo

236,"Honestly with Woolly World I was expecting at least a LITTLE more challenge. It's a cutesy version of Yoshi, even more cute than the average Yoshi platformer. I think it was really directed towards a younger audience, which is why I don't really care for it.

Mario Maker is something I found to be creative, but definitely doesn't need the Amiibo support. It just has it. Splatoon I agree is a great game, but I feel like aside from Smash Splatoon is Nintendo's definitive game for this year. I guess I'm just really disappointed with Nintendo right now, which is why I knew I would get wrecked for putting out this post.

And honestly, I expected something halfway decent with a Mario Party-esque Animal Crossing game. I didn't think Nintendo could screw up this badly. Same goes for Mario Party and Ultra Smash, they're just so lackluster compared to a lot of the previous installments. I feel like Nintendo is losing its creative spark.

I agree with what you're saying though about me cherrypicking. I think I placed YWW in the wrong category for me to talk about it so negatively. I made an edit to the main post to better accurately reflect my opinion of that game.",2015-11-20 20:03:53+00:00,cx78v8q,2.0,t1_cx6qnu0,38342,amiibo

I came into the Amiibo scene between waves 3 and 4, and when I started to collect them I noticed that people were doing batshit crazy things to get their hands on them. So I imported and bought some from resellers for a hefty price, but I didn't mind since I didn't have to wait two hours for these plastic figures out in the cold.

I think the real reason why wave 4 was so chaotic is that the Amiibo craze started to gain traction. Many people were now really into collecting these and it got to a point where Nintendo's atrocious stock couldn't keep up with the insane demand, and people were up in arms over it. Hopefully it never happens again, but I can say that it was truly something to remember. Amiibo are nothing to joke about as the thirst for them is so real.",2015-11-10 20:34:04+00:00,cwvpkj9,1.0,t3_3s8fir,56847,amiibo

Worst three (in no particular order): Yoshi, Robin, and Donkey Kong. Yoshi spams his eggs too much to do anything productive, Robin is just too darn slow, and Donkey Kong is kind of a klutz overall.

She's now at level 50 and still doesn't really use Sun Salutation properly unless you're really far away from her and give her space. She barely uses Deep Breathing which is really disappointing because it's really handy for her to have activated.

676,"Hey, so I know this thread is like 5 months old, but I still wanna comment and give you my feedback because it's been helping me a lot with training my Amiibo better. First off, WII FIT TRAINER CAN ACTUALLY RAPID UP B! I don't know how she learned it, but my WFT suddenly started doing it every time I hit her off the ledge at level 26 while I was facing her 1v1 with my Pikachu (which is pure ass btw, but I just wanted to see how I'd do because of this site link here: http://www.eventhubs.com/tiers/ssb4/character/wii-fit-trainer/). Anyways, what helped me to allow my WFT to spam Up B properly is this Amiibo training guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/2na8xb/very_basic_tips_on_training_your_amiibo/. This guide is possibly how my WFT learned to effectively use Up B. Make sure to mirror match her during her levels 11-20 to teach her what you know about WFT. And... that's really all I had to say! Thank you for your guide, as I've trained my Pit, Ness, and Little Mac Amiibo off of it (I see you don't have King Dedede on here yet, I would put him probably middle mid tier as he is a complete monster in a good handful of matchups but doesn't fare too well against characters like ZSS, Ness, and Lucas who require proper spacing and projectiles). Once again awesome guide and hope to hear your feedback soon!

EDIT: So my Wii Fit Trainer is now level 40 and I've noticed some things about her. She never properly uses Sun Salutation (by this I mean she jumps and shoots it before charging it up at all; this may be because I configured her from the beginning to have the Enriched Sun Salutation custom, but idk I've changed it and still no better results) and she never uses her Deep Breathing technique. Kinda unsettling because you didn't mention it in your guide either. Last but not least, she has been able to perform the jab to pitfall down smash without me teaching her, so that's a plus. I don't think that the negligence of the Sun Salutation and Deep Breathing is a deal breaker because she's still very good so far at only level 40, but I do agree that she shouldn't be moved above low tier.",2015-07-10 00:16:52+00:00,csy1jp1,1.0,t3_2uwzmg,13314268,amiibo

687,"Some changes to be made:
G&amp;W should be B tier at least, his bells are trollsy af.
ALL of ZSS's taunts are deliciously salt-inducing, should be a bit higher.
PALUTENA'S STRIPPER POLE DANCE? HELLO? S rank at the very least.
Pac-Man's taunts are so disrespectful, especially when he daydreams about ghosts.
And as many have mentioned, GANONDORF. Jesus Christ GANONDORF. True NaCl inducer right there",2015-07-03 07:50:55+00:00,csqtg02,1.0,t3_3bx8ra,34369,smashbros

691,"Interesting... my Link Amiibo rarely uses projectiles, probably only the boomerang (custom side B), so he's mainly a swordsman even though that's probably not the best way he should be played. Somehow though he still destroys everything I've tried so far... thanks though, I'll try Falco out",2015-07-03 03:49:46+00:00,csqnmay,2.0,t1_csqni27,247,amiibo
692,"Idk, are Amiibo supposed to literally get better than you no matter what? I feel like pros should be able to defeat them even if they train them themselves correctly haha. But still, my Link Amiibo is pretty solid and doesn't do silly things yet, so he's still a huge threat to my Little Mac",2015-07-03 03:38:21+00:00,csqna7e,2.0,t1_csqmy80,666,amiibo

695,"For training all my Amiibo to 50, I either mirror matched them up to 50 one on one and then used different characters afterwards or played with my friends using basically the whole cast on them. So my Amiibo know a decent amount of what they're supposed to do and understand basically all matchups. But this Link Amiibo is still giving me huge trouble (he's probably in my top 3 Amiibo). I'll try Ness out since I'm better with him, thanks for the input",2015-07-03 03:35:06+00:00,csqn6qq,2.0,t1_csqn0vt,325,amiibo
696,He spams it I think only because he realizes it's a powerful option and he is pretty successful at using it at all the right times. Got any characters in mind who can decently counter Link then?,2015-07-03 03:27:03+00:00,csqmy0b,2.0,t1_csqmw43,104,amiibo
