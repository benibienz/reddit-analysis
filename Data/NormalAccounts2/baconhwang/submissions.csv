I have been collecting Amiibo since wave 4, and I really enjoyed it until I had a full Smash collection (obviously besides Cloud/Corrin/Bayo). Once I got the full collection I thought a bit and really analyzed my situation. Do I really need this many Amiibo? I like them, sure, but half the Amiibo cast I don't even really play with or use much, let alone do I even like some of the characters such as Duck Hunt and Dr. Mario (seriously, does anyone ever pick Doc over regular Mario?). I came to the realization that I simply wanted a complete collection for the sake of having a complete collection. This can apply to anything really, but it hit me hard with Amiibo since it was one collection I actually completed. I realized just how much money was spent on these things, and I slowly regretted the investment. So I decided to sell a majority of my collection for about a third of what they all cost me. Did I like selling them away? Not really, but I knew it was the best thing to do at that point. I realize now that something as silly as Amiibo can become a true addiction, and that's where my life was at by that point. I kept a few Amiibo, the ones I really liked and use extensively, and now I'm much happier. Amiibo really were my shopping addiction, and I'm really glad I put an end to it and now have a clearer mindset when it comes to purchasing things. I feel that something like Amiibo really put things into perspective as far as what moderation means.

I've come to browse and frequent this sub on a daily basis now, and because of it I got every single Amiibo out so far in the US. I came in between waves 3 and 4 so obviously I had to buy a few from resellers, but I'm really happy with my collection and wouldn't have gotten probably half of them without the help of this sub.
