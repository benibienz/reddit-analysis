There are various sources of wi-fi: router, wi-fi emitted by your laptop and other devices, some models of smart meters and internet of things. Other models of smart meters use broadband over power line which produces dirty electricity.

Manufacturers have designed new routers stronger for wi-fi to be transmitted throughout the home for the internet of things. See the wi-fi: routers wiki:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/5a72rw/wiki_wifi_routers/

There are several android wifi radiation apps which measure the power density of routers:

Wifi Radiation Meter app uses the Russian unit microwatts per centimeter square (uW/cm2) for the total power density of nearby routers. Wifi Radiation Meter uses nano watts per centimeter square (nW/cm2 unit for the power density of each router.  Convert nano watts to microwatts. 1000 nanowatt = 1 microwatt.

Quanta Monitor by Cellraid uses microwatts per meter (uW/m2) unit. To compare them, convert one unit to the other unit. The developer is Finnish. Western Europe uses ICNIRP safety standards which is not as safe as Russia's. ICNIRP uses meter square. The ICNIRP based power density measurement uses per meter square (m2).  Meter square needs to be converted to centimeter square (cm2) to compare safety standards and to compare exposures of cell phones and routers. See the safety standards wikis in /r/electromagnetics.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/59rn2g/meter_reports_sar_4g_power_density_readings_of_my/

Ten months ago, I wrote instructions on how to destroy the larger Qualcomm chip:

https://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/4353f1/how_to_partially_mitigate_a_mobile_phone_from/

On October 27, 2016, via wi-fi I just downloaded Quanta Monitor app. With airplane mode on and wi-fi on and connected to the internet, SAR fluctuated between 0 to 1.5. Power density fluctuated between 16,736 to 855,536 uW. Outrageously high.

These phones I had never activated. I purchased them used on eBay as back up phones. The Motorola Droid 4 was the last smartphone with a great qwerty keyboard so I wanted back ups.

I had activated a Motorola Droid 3 which had enormous SAR and power density. I bricked it by destroying the Qualcomm chip. Had I known to root and install cyanogenmod first, I would have done so. 

This unactivated Droid 4 phone has CyanogenMod operating system. Despite no SIM card and I had never activated the phone, I was able to turn on the mobile network switch. SAR is 0. Power density is 16,736 uW. 

With mobile networks, wi-fi and airplane mode off, power density remained at 16,736 uW. Turning mobile network on and off and turning on airplane mode on and off did not alter power density. Power density remained at 16,736.

My analysis:

(1)  Airplane mode on or off.  Destroying the 4G chip had the same measurements as destroying the larger Qualcomm chip. SAR was zero.  Quanta Monitoring app cannot detect extremely low level SAR.  0.0004 W/Kg permeates the blood brain barrier and causes leaky brain.

http://www.emfwise.com/tableofeffects.php

Airplane mode on or off power density was 16,736 uW.

(3) Wi-Fi connected to the internet.  Destroying the 4G LTE chip attenuated more power density for wi-fi than destroying the larger Qualcomm chip.  Wi-fi's power density of phone without 4G LTE chip was. Power density of phone without Qualcomm chip was 855,556 uW.

(4)  Destroying the larger Qualcomm chip on this rooted phone and the 4G LTE chip on the unrooted phone did reduce some SAR and power density. How much I don't know as I discovered this app after I discarded the SIM card and stopped renewing my cell phone plan.  

I had tested SAR while making phone calls using Tawkon app. Tawkon alerted high SAR every time I made or answered a call. I uninstalled Tawkon because it used battery power. The difference Quanta Monitor and Tawkon is Tawkon tested SAR only during phone calls. 

Why is the power density of wi-fi connected to the internet dependent on what other chips are on the motherboard? The phones' wi-fi feels like the same microwaves as 4G has though less strong. In other words, wi-fi on my unactivated phones biologically felt like 4G on my activated phone. However, my laptops' wi-fi and my PocketCHIP PDA do not feel like 4G.  The modulation and power density are different. 

Can anyone explain this discrepancy? How could perps and hackers remotely blast modulation and power density on smartphones but not on other wifi devices? 

That is not to say my laptops' wifi is harmless. Wi-fi is harmful. See the wi-fi wiki in /r/electromagnetics. 4G and wi-fi have mind controlled me. They caused me to become addicted to the internet. My family has no addiction problem. I never had an addiction problem until I switched from a Palm 3G phone to an Android 3G phone. I don't do internet gaming or social media. I do not stream movies or music. Yet, when I turned on wi-fi on my phones or laptops, my eyes are addicted to the screen. My eyes have difficulty looking away from the screen I don't look at my hand written notes or print outs of my plain text files. Thereby, my ability to type up my notes and to write letters and self posts have suffered. 

I use an ethernet cable when not travelling. Being forced to use wi-fi while traveling ruins my travel plans. For example, this week I went out of town to have thermal imaging and to see my environmental medicine physician. I booked a bed at a hostel. Wi-fi addiction kept me from doing most of my travel plans.

Charging these phones even in a different room zaps me. I have to charge the phones while I am away. I can sit next to people while they are using their mobile phone. Perps have the ability to elevate SAR of nearby phones to zap me. The perps don't. Not because they give a damn about other people. Perps utilize other methods of brain zapping. Ultrasonic hum, pulsed ultrasound and electrical stimulation.

Only one person's use of their phone zapped me. I gave a neighbor who is a targeted individual a ride to the motor vehicles department. His looking up the address and directions zapped me. Had I known about this app then, I would have asked him to test his phone.

I do not miss using a smartphone. Landline phones have the best voice quality. 

Despite submitting research on brain injury treatments and taking the herbs and supplements, my brain has just partially recovered. What a tragedy! 

I will destroy the 4G LTE chip in my rooted phone and retest. Will destruction of both the larger Qualcomm chip and the 4G LTE chip attenuate power density?

&gt;Why are negative ions important? They protect you from radiation. Radiation is positively charged. Electrons are negatively charged. The ozone layer,  which protects us from the sun's radiation,  is full of negatively charged ions. You know what else protects you from radiation?  Magnetic fields. Try adding some powerful neodymium magnets to your orgonite. This will tremendously increase the benefits. Also, use metal powder if possible.Try it.

&gt;How B-17 works (a tale of two enzymes):
Rhodanese is an enzyme found everywhere in the body except for cancer cells.
Beta-Glucosidase is an enzyme found only in and around cancer cells.

&gt;Hold that thought. Vitamin B-17 is a molecule made up of four parts:

&gt;-2 parts Glucose

&gt;-1 part Benzaldahyde

&gt;-1 part Hydrogen Cyanide

&gt;I know what you’re thinking. Cyanide? Yikes! Don’t worry, cyanide in this form is non-toxic, just like it is in this form of B-12 (Cyanocobalamin).

&gt;Normal healthy cells contain the enzyme Rhodanese which neutralizes the Benzaldahyde and Hydrogen Cyanide in B-17. It converts them to the useful nutrient compounds Thyiocyanate and Benzoic acid.

&gt;Here’s the amazing part: The glucose delivers B-17 to the cancer cells, but cancer cells do not have the enzyme Rhodanese to neutralize the cyanide. Instead they have a unique enzyme called Beta-Glucosidase. This “unlocking enzyme”, found only in cancer cells, releases the Benzaldahyde and Cyanide from the glucose and each other creating a targeted poison that kills the cancer cell. It’s kind of like “natural chemo”.

www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/6/9/3777/pdf

&gt;4.1.2. Brassica Family Vegetables and Organosulfides
Organosulfides are among the most potent Nrf2 activating phytochemicals. Plants in the Brassica family (broccoli, cabbage, brussel sprouts, turnip, collard greens) are a particularly rich source of organosulfides, primarily glucosinolates and their derivatives. However, different Brassica species
present diverse phytochemical profiles. Sulforaphane was the most bioavailable glucosinolate in a broccoli-based diet, while neoglucobrassicin was the main glucosinolate in a pak choi-based diet [73].
Both diets increased NQO1 activity and expression in the colon of azoxymethane (AOM)-treated mice, but only the broccoli diet increased TrxR; however pak choi was more effective at attenuating colonic
inflammation than broccoli [73]. Even method of preparation can alter the health effects. Both steamed and cooked broccoli-based diets were protective against ischemic cardiac injury in rats, upregulating
Nrf2, SOD1, and SOD2, however only steamed broccoli had any effect on Trx and TrxR expression [74].
The most well studied phytochemical among the glucosinolates is the isothiocyanate, sulforaphane.

&gt;Nine of the ten current clinical trials evaluating compounds affecting the Nrf2 pathway are focused on sulforaphane [75]. Acute sulforaphane treatment upregulated hepatic GST, GCLC expression and activity along with increased NQO1 mRNA [76]. Longer-term treatment was required to increase NQO1 activity [76]. In rat cardiomyocytes, sulforaphane increased the activation of Nrf2 and increased expression and activity of GSR, GST, TrxR and NQO1 in a PI3K/Akt dependent manner [77]. Mice with induced diabetes received three months of sulforaphane treatment and were either sacrificed immediately or after six months with no further treatment after the initial three-month period. Sulforaphane nearly completely abrogated all signs of oxidative stress and inflammation in the aorta, and this effect persisted strongly even three months after treatment ceased. The authors propose that in
addition to the immediate effects on the Nrf2 pathway, the upregulated “program” may be set by
epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, conferring a protection that goes beyond transient
upregulation of antioxidant enzymes [78]. Interestingly, in a similar study, zinc alone completely
blocked inflammation and tissue remodeling associated with T1D in the aorta. Zinc strongly upregulated
Nrf2 expression and ARE target NQO1 [79]. In neural tissues, glucoraphanin, a sulforaphane precursor,
upregulated Nrf2, and reduced ROS in an induced murine model of Parkinson’s disease, reducing the severity of symptoms [80]. The same compound administered after spinal cord injury protected against cell death, in part by suppressing NFκB activation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine
production [81]. Notably, the same pattern appeared in both transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of both sulforaphane-treated, and Keap1 siRNA-treated breast epithelial cells, highlighting that the primary
mechanism for the effect of glucosinolates is via the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway [33].",2016-09-15 02:18:22+00:00,d7nawpx,1.0,t3_52ty7c,2097.0,Electromagnetics

Do you have a source regarding nootropics requiring choline? Herbal nootropics, such as bacopa, calamus, ashwagandha, gotu kola, rhodiola (Tibetan ginseng), shankpushpi, etc, do not effect acetylcholine.

Several synthetic nootropics elevate acetylcholine. I have never taken synthetic nootropics.:

&gt;Many of the most popular nootropics are acetylcholine agonists or cholinergic supplements. Piracetam, Aniracetam, Pramiracetam, Oxiraetam and Noopept all work this way – stimulating your acetylcholine receptors to release more of the stored neurotransmitter.

Neurologists treat brain zapping (pulsing like electro shock), cognitive decline and mental fatigue (mitochondria dysfunction). Not psychiatrists. These are neurological symptoms, not psychological symptoms. 

Allopathic psychiatrists do not order neurotransmitter tests nor acetylcholinestrase tests. Holistic psychiatrists, holistic MDs, environmental medicine practitioners and naturopaths order neurotransmitter tests.

Allopathic psychiatrists can do more damage than good by prescribing drugs that are anticholinergics.  Neurologists and psychiatrists fail to warn taking anticholinergics can induce early dementia by depleting acetylcholine. 

http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/18/health/otc-anticholinergic-drugs-dementia/

I do not take anticholinergics. Anticholinergics dry up the body. They also induce dry eye syndrome, dry mouth, constipation, dry skin and sleepiness. During a first doctor appointment when asked what drugs I am allergic to, I reply anticholinergics. Either the nurses never heard of anticholinergics or they ask me for the name of a specific drug. I reply the entire family of anticholinergics and resist identifying one drug as I do not want them to write down that drug.  Some of the nurses ask what symptoms I sustain. I explain dry eyes, dry sinuses, dry mouth, constipation, dry skin and sleepiness. One nurse reply that is not an allergy. The nurse is right. I am not allergic to anticholinergic drugs. I sustain side effects from anticholinergic drugs.

After obtaining a copy of my medical records,  I discover what drugs I am allergic to is blank. I complain to the doctors' nurses who refuse to make the correction. I complain to the medical centers' complaint departments. No correction. I will complain to the state Board of Medical Examiners.

There is a huge allopathic bias against acknowledging side effects of medications. No nurse ever asked me what drugs I have side effects to. Only what drugs I am allergic to. 

Several years ago, I went to urgent care for an allergic reaction. I asked for hydrocortisone. There was no MD at the urgent are. Just a physician's assistant. Subsequently, I learned to call urgent cares ahead of time to ask if they have a MD on duty. If they have a physician's assistant, I call other urgent cares.

Despite my informing the nurse that I cannot take anticholinergics, the physician's assistant prescribed benadryl. I explained benadryl is an anticholingeric. I get side effects anticholingerics. I again asked for hydrocortisol which I can tolerate. The PA refused. I asked to see another practitioner. I was told there was no other practitioner. Against my better judgment, I took the benadryl. I got one block away before I became suddenly so drowsy, I could not go any further and fell asleep. Several hours later, I woke up, returned to the urgent care and demanded hydrocortisol. A MD was on duty and prescribed hydrocortisol.

Psychiatrists are not taught what is healthy and not healthy for your brain. They do not even recognize the papers on acetylcholine inducing depression and anxiety. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4umacm/j_depression_anxiety_neurotransmitter/

Allopathic psychiatrists do not test for acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase. They don't prescribe choline. They naively follow big pharma by prescribing drugs some of which cause the exact problems they are supposedly treating by depleting acetylcholine.

132,"OSHA lowered its threshold limit value (TLV) for formaldehyde due to workers becoming ill.  However, EPA employees are currently sick from formaldehyde. The State of California OSHA has not conducted an eight hour test.

http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/San-Francisco-EPA-Workers-Claim-Office-is-a-Sick-Building-369331961.html

The problem is not merely inadequate air flow. The problem is mostly toxic building materials that emit formaldehyde and other toxins. Formaldehyde has a twenty year half life.

Since the early 1960s, people have become poisoned from formaldehyde from baseboard, particle board and insulation in mobile homes and travel trailers. Since the 1970's, people have become poisoned from formaldehyde in urea foam insulation in houses.

HUD continues to fail to set a TLV for housing.  HUD merely requires a warning label be posted inside brand new mobile homes but not travel trailers. Pathetic that the poisoned families did not demand HUD to set a TLV.

ImmunoSciences Lab in Beverly Hills, California was the first lab and I believe the only lab that created a formaldehyde antibody test. Biomarker tests are important for toxic tort litigation, workers compensation cases as well as to obtain disability.  

ImmunoSciences Lab also created the first silicon antibody test. Manufacturers of breast implants pressured the FDA to pressure ImmunoSciences Lab to cease offering the silicon antibody test. ImmunoSciences Lab chose to close down. Several years later, they reopened but can no longer offer the silicon antibody test. They no longer offer the formaldehyde antibody test. 

Catch 22. Without biomarker tests, poisoned people are not diagnosed, treated and compensated.

Formaldehyde is a known sensitizer. Formaldehyde poisoning can cause multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). Further exposures can permanently exacerbate MCS and become disabling. /r/electromagnetics is the only sub that covers MCS.

In the 1980s, EPA employees got sick building syndrome and MCS from new carpet. The EPA tested and identified the chemical emitted by the carpet that was poisoning. The EPA removed the carpet and reinstalled the carpet in another building. The EPA did not adopt guidelines to limit the chemical. EPA merely required the carpet industry to have a warning label on new carpet. Only people who see the warning label are the carpet purchasers and installers. Not occupants of buildings and homeowners.

168,"Could you please cite a reference for vitamin C and inositol therapy? I could not find any papers on vitamin C and inositol deficiency being biomarkers of OCD or on vitamin C and inositol being a treatment. No deficiency would imply no treatment.

Vitamin E, not vitamin C, is a biomarker of OCD:

&gt;In a single study that evaluated the total oxidant and antioxidant status in serum, there was increased oxidant status and lower antioxidant status, with a resulting high oxidative stress index in children with OCD.95 Another study in adults with OCD measured erythrocyte malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation, and found that OCD was associated with higher levels of malondialdehyde, suggesting that a higher oxidation level was present. In this study, the antioxidant vitamin E, but not vitamin C, was also significantly lower in patients with OCD.96 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425334/

Vitamin B12 deficiency and elevated homocysteine are other biomarkers of OCD:

&gt;In the current study, it was found that vitamin B12 levels were decreased and homocysteine levels were increased in at least some of the patients with OCD. Among the OCD patients, the rate of vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher compared to the control group while folate deficiency was not found in either group.

Serotonin deficiency is a biomarker:

&gt;administration of 5HTP restored 5HT to wild-type levels in several brain regions implicated in compulsive and impulsive behaviors including hippocampus, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, and tegmentum (Fig. 4d–g, respectively), indicating both neurochemical and behavioral rescue in Tph2−/− mice.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3371128/

Surprisingly, this sub never recommends lab tests to ascertain deficiencies. Deficiencies could cause OCD. Treating deficiencies may be a better tactic than taking prescription drugs. Medical insurance reimburses costs of lab tests.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4339ag/brain_zapping_biomarkers_quinolinic_acid_test/

A high quinolinic acid ratio would indicate a problem of tryptophan being converted to 5-HTP.  Supplementing with 5-HTP is not a complete solution as quinolinic acid ratio would remain high. Treating quinolinic acid is important:

To reset your biological clock, place bed by window. Preferably facing east. Keep curtains open. Allow rising sun to wake you up. Alternatively, sleep on the grass in the back yard facing east. Rising sun and earthing help reset the biological clock.

Waking up at 2 pm would give you vitamin D deficiency, serotonin deficiency and melatonin deficiency. Vitamin D is a recently discovered cofactor of serotonin.

Are  your files infected and/or your hard drives? If you do not know whether your hard hard drive is infected, see the wiki on hidden partitions and Kaspersky discovering firmware of hard drives being flashed by a nation state Kaspersky suspects to be NSA. 

The wiki needs to be updated and revised to make it easier to find posts. Any volunteers to preserve the newer posts by copying their title and permalink into the wki?

If your files are infected with typical malware (not state level), converting your files to plain text text files would remove the malware. Convert word files infected with macros and objects to text. Convert rich text files infected with malicious strings to text. Convert nongraphical PDF files infected with objects to plain text files.  Document Viewer makes this easy.

It used to be true that text files were incapable of being infected. I was advised to convert my files. I converted thousands of files. Inserting my removable media into a replacement laptop infected the laptop. Two years ago, one of my very first posts was on infected text files. Last year, I posting  'Additional Information' by VirusTotal of my infected DOCs, PDF and JPEG files. My plain text files were infected but 'Additional Information' did not show it. I posted screenshots of hex editor dumps. This week was the first time 'Additional Information' did.

You could test converting your files into plain text, burning the files to a CD and inserting the CD in a replacement computer. If you have a portable DVD writer, you could boot to a live linux DVD and burn your files using the second DVD writer. Burning CDs used to be a secure method of transferring files. There were only a few malware that were written to infect burning of CDs. BadBIOS does.

http://superuser.com/questions/814004/is-it-safe-to-download-and-burn-a-disc-image-on-an-infected-pc

The firmware of the DVD writer is vulnerable to being flashed.

Do not copy the files you cannot convert such as graphical PDF and JPEG. Did your files text infect the replacement computer?  If so either your plain text files are infected or your infected computer infected the burning of the CD.

Secure Copy is a method of copying files without copying the infected media:

Misconduct by one out of thousands of licensed naturopaths does not discredit naturopathy. Disciplinary action was taken:

""From October 2013 to April 2014, a licensed naturopath in Tucson, Arizona, Michael Uzick, was using ukrain in his practice to treat cancer patients; he was given a letter of reprimand by the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board as he obtained the ukrain not from a manufacturer registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which was likely imported from abroad.[10]"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrain

I am surprised one naturopath in the United States prescribed ukrain. Ukrain is derived from the herb chelidonium majus. Lawfully, he could have prescribed the herb in the United States. The herb chelidonium majus is not a controlled substance.

Prescribing chelidonium majus is not quakery.

Proapoptotic activity of Ukrain is based on Chelidonium majus L. alkaloids and mediated via a mitochondrial death pathway

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1379651/

'In vitro and in vivo investigations on the antitumour activity of Chelidonium majus.'

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26626193

Many papers found ukrain to be effective. The most recent paper is 'Anticancer agent ukrain and bortezomib combination is synergistic in 4T1 breast cancer cells.'

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919744

""Yet, because Bastyr’s clinic generally gets patients with a limited range of minor problems, we could gain competency by giving oral presentations to other students on diseases we had not seen.""

There are five accredited naturopathic colleges in the United States: New Hampshire, Washington, Oregon, California and Arizona. They all have student clinics. The clinics do not see ""a limited range of minor problems.""

California and Arizona have recently licensed naturopaths. Their residents are unaware of naturopathy. The states do not educate their residents that naturopathy exists. Even in states that have long had licensing of naturopaths, majority of residents of Washington and Oregon do not know naturopathy exists.

The clinics tend to get patients who want holistic medicine and patients with major health conditions allopathic medicine has not been unable to cure are seen by the clinic.

Lack of medical insurance restricts low income patients from attending the clinics and purchasing medicine. Medicare does not reimburse naturopathic visits. Patients with medicaid have refused to ask medicaid whether naturopathy and medicine are covered.

Prior to treatment, auto insurance companies refuse to disclose their policy of paying naturopathic visits and medicine to treat injuries. Patients take the risk as they do not know. Insurance companies do indeed pay for naturopathic visits and medicine in states that license naturopaths.

""Instructors would commonly discuss a patient’s “vital force” as if this could magically be detected."" Vital force, also known as prana, chi and biophotons, is detected by biofield devices such as gas discharge visualization. In 2015, I attended all three days of the Cancer Control Society convention and the Doctors Symposium. Diacom NLS Analysis and another machine detecting vital force were exhibited at a booth. www.diacom-nls.com. www.diacomsoft.com.

The biofield wiki is at:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/43j6zu/wiki_biofield_measuring_body_emf_exposure_using/

""Frequently, patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms were diagnosed with dubious food allergies, chronic Lyme disease, adrenal fatigue, or yeast overgrowth."" Naturopaths diagnose by ordering lab tests. Insurance that pays naturopathic visits, pays for lab tests. Great Plains Lab organic acid test for candida. IGeneX Lab and Fry Lab for lyme and their coinfections. wwwigenex.com. http://frylabs.com. Timed cortisol test and DHEA test for adrenal fatigue. Naturopaths do not diagnosis by guessing.

""Patients would be prescribed an assortment of herbs and supplements, conveniently sold at the clinic’s dispensary, and handed a superbill for insurance reimbursement."" ""....old-timey practices""

This implies herbs and supplements are folk lore and not effective. There are thousands of papers on the effectiveness of herbs and supplements. I have submitted numerous posts linking to recent papers on herbs, supplement and diet treating many health conditions: parkinson's, alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, remyelination, candida, adrenal fatigue, cancer, blood brain barrier permeability, traumatic brain injury, blood retinal barrier permeability, insomnia, radio wave sickness, immune, neurotransmitters, etc.

Naturopaths, holistic doctors including environmental medicine physicians and chinese medicine practitioners prescribe herbs. President Nixon's trip to China introduced chinese medicine to the United States. Thanks to President Nixon, more states license chinese medicine practitioners than naturopaths. Had he visited India, ayurveda could have been introduced to the United States. Ayurveda practitioners are not licensed in the United States.

Herb stores are rare. Health food stores and pharmacies sell a small percentage of herbs. Of the herbs health food store sell, the majority is pills and tablets of dried herbs. Pharmacies do not sell herbal tinctures. Tinctures of fresh herbs are more potent than tinctures of dried herbs and much more potent than pills and tablets of dried herbs. Of the few herbal tinctures health food stores sell, few are fresh tinctures.

Naturopaths often prescribe a herbal remedy of various herbs. The medicinary at naturopathic clinics makes the remedy. Alternatively, patients could spend more money by special ordering individual tinctures of dried herbs at health food stores, wait for the order and blend the herbs themselves. Either way, medical insurance reimburses the cost of medicine if the insurance covers medicine and naturopathic care.

Edit: /u/lymphocyte deleted his reply. My reply is:

Germany was the first country to research alternative cancer therapies and establish clinics. Cancer clinics in Mexico were created due to persecution of doctors in the United States starting with Dr. Gerson and traveling to Mexico is less expensive than traveling to Germany. The Mexican clinic fees are comparable to German clinic fees.

The Cancer Control Society is based in Los Angeles. Their annual convention is in Los Angeles. I traveled to Los Angeles to attend the convention. The fee to charter a bus to Mexico departing from the convention is reasonable. A bus cannot be chartered to Germany.

Doctors from the Mexican clinics travel to the Cancer Control Society's convention every year. They lecture and have booths. It is not necessary to take the inexpensive chartered trip to Mexico to be introduced to therapies and specialized lab tests. The convention is international. Doctors and researchers from europe and Britain spoke.

Quick to get to Mexico even without a chartered bus. From Los Angeles light rail Metrolink train connects to a San Diego light rail Coaster train which connects to a trolley ending across the street from the border. Pharmacies are a block from the border. The pharmacies are a few of the stores in Mexico having english speaking employees. The pharmacies cater to Americans who commute to Mexico to purchase medicine. Medicine purchased in Mexico is less expensive than medicine purchased in United States and Germany. Michael Moore's documentary 'Sicko' features Americans traveling to Canada and Cuba to drugs because the prices are cheaper. Mexican pharmacies do not require a prescription for the same pharmaceutical drugs pharmacies in the United States are required to require a prescription for.

Medicine not licensed by the FDA may be lawfully purchased in foreign countries. Patients can lawfully pack their medicine in their suitcases and return to the United States. Ukrain was not discussed at the 2015 Cancer Control Society convention. I doubt Ukrain is prescribed or sold in Mexico and Germany.

/u/lymphocyte, you asked me about a different therapy, vitamin C. Other therapies is off topic. Please submit a post but not in /r/cancer.

Gas companies add an additive to natural gas to give gas an odor so leaks can be smelled. The additive is toxic.

Bowel Biofilm Therapy:

To weaken/ remove the intestinal biofilm
1. NaEDTA ½ -1 tsp (25-50mg/kg/day) 2x per day between
meals

2. Lumbrokinase: an enzyme that effectively breaks down the
biofilm protective matrix

3. MMS as antimicrobial

4. Chlorella to clean up the bowel wall and detox the
neurotoxins of the microbes, whose home is being
eliminated

5. Ecklonia Cava:   2-4 caps twice daily

6. Others to weaken/ remove the bowel biofilm: charcoal,
pectin, clay, fiber

To restore the healthy biofilm at the same time:

1. Eat lacto-fermented foods (Body Ecology Diet)

2. Supplement with Beta Glucan probiotics (good bacteria plus
their healthy matrix to grow).

Biofilm supplements:

Ecklonia Cava Extract

• Sea based polyphenols 10-1000 times stronger than land based
ones (green tea, resveratrol). Ocean polyphenols pass blood
brain barrier.
• Long ½ life 12 hours, land based ones 30 min.
• Strong anti-oxidant, lipid and cholesterol lowering
• Calcium scavenger (from endothelium), which helps in the
biofilm removal
• Anti-plasmin effect: increase of micro-circulation.
• Anti-inflammatory, Inhibition of NF-kB
• Supports healthy blood glucose levels, very good for
uncontrolled blood sugar
• Down regulate of DGAT enzyme (turns food into fat) by 60%:
significant in weight loss (for weight loss – 4 caps 2x/day
• Pain relieving effect by inhibition of COX enzymes
• Inhibition and reversal of beta-amyloid plaque formation
(Alzheimer’s)

Clinical effects: improves sleep, weight loss, reduced blood
pressure, anti-arthritic, significant reduction in Fibromyalgia pain,
increase in memory and cognitive function, more potent than
Viagra is ED, reversal of arterial plaque and vascular inflammation
, anti-aging

**MMS- Miracle Mineral Solution Protocols**

To constitute the MMS

Citric acid; at pharmacy of Whole foods; 
make a 10% solution with 1 tbsp citric acid to 9 tbsp of water

Sources: Whole foods, www.miraclemineral.org

Mix each drop MMS with 5 drops citric acid solution, swirl
in large glass with dropper. Wait 3 min then add to water of non-Vit C juice and drink

MMS can be applied straight of diluted to skin, eruptions, cancer,
age spots, keratotic lesions, etc.

Start 2 drops MMS twice daily. Increase slowly to 15 drops 3
times/ day. Or maintain on 6 drops twice daily and spike once weekly to 15
drops twice daily exactly one hour apart – after diner; follow
protocol with 30-40 drops of Rizols. It is best to use both doses of MMS between dinner and bedtime.
Follow with high dose of chlorella (20-30 tabs) and again as close
to bedtime as possible with a dose of probiotics. Use probiotics
during the day: after breakfast and lunch.

• Side effect: die off effects (nausea for a few hours most common).
Tends to disappear after the job id finished (days).

• MMS works mostly in the blood stream, less effective in deeper
tissues. Excellent for Babesia and acute stages of any infection.""

(2) Discussion of autism in this post is threadjacking. Arguing about a paper on autism is further threadjacking. Previously, I objected to being forced to threadjack in this post. Iff you want to debunk a paper, debunk it in the post that links to it.

(3) You asked why I repeated your accusation: ""My asking for substantiation that impact factor correlates with credibility is silly."" Because you neither explain nor substantiate. Impact factor does not correlate to credibility.

(4)  None of the posts in /r/electromagnetics heavily upvoted and few posts in /r/electromagnetics are commented in /r/electromagnetics. Note that you are commenting in a different subreddit. /r/electromagnetics is a new sub and a small sub.

(5) Why did you accuse me of repeating my discussion on /r/electromagnetic? I did not repeat it. 

/r/electromagnetic is almost a four year old sub. It was abandoned, taken over by shills and abandoned again. /r/electromagnetic is not humorous. It always was on the physical science of electromagnetic fields. /r/electromagnetics and /r/emfeffects are on the biological effects of electromagnetic fields.  

I do not push pseudoscience at my two subs: /r/electromagnetics and /r/badBIOS.

In your prior comment, you misrepresented no one reads /r/electromagnetics. I directed you to the traffic statistics. Now you are criticizing /r/electromagnetics gets only 15 - 40 pageviews. You need to apologize for misrepresenting no one reads /r/electromagnetics.

You debunk traffic statistics by alleging half the pageviews are bots reading reddit. Evidence bots read reddit?

You need to acknowledge the low interest in EMF as evidenced by the low number of subscribers and pageviews of subs on EMF including /r/electromagnetic and /r/emfeffects.

(6) I do not bury my posts beneath crosslinks and it takes not take 2-3 clicks to get to sources.

If you are referring to 'Autism and EMF' by oscillatorium, do you actually click on the links to identify the journals? Journals are not rated as low impact or high impact. Papers are rated low impact or high impact.

(7) I typed my username in TMOR's search bar. Nothing came up. TotesMessenger bot automatically posts notification of cross-posting. /r/electromagnetics does not have a comment from TotesMessenger bot notifying a post has been cross-posted in TMOR. 

You refuse to identify my posts in /r/electromagnetics that have been cross-posted in TMOR. Therefore, you cannot use any comments in TMOR to back up your misrepresentations.



How did you come from TMOR to /r/itsnotbullshit to comment in the identical post I am commenting in?

(3)  My asking for substantiation that impact factor correlates with credibility is silly;

(3)  No one is finding and reading my posts. Whereas, the link to traffic statistics is in the sidebar.

(4)  I pointed to two people who have commented in your subs as proof that your posts are being read. Whereas, I pointed to two other OPs to counter your misrepresentation that /r/electromagnetics has only two OPs.  OPs do not indicate whether posts are read. Traffic statistics discloses this. 

(5)   No one is searching for your subs, which is evidenced by your low viewership. Redditors do search, find and read /r/electromagnetics as evidenced by traffic statistics. /r/electromagnetics has more subscribers, uniques, pageviews, posts and comments than the other two subs on EMF: /r/emfeffects and /r/electromagnetic.

(6) In this comment thread, the person a few posts up states that you are crosslinking and source burying.  Virtually every post you make is crosslinked, which is burying your sources. Your sources require at a minimum two clicks to find, because you aren't linking them directly. Whereas, I have submitted many link posts to /r/electromagnetics and other subs.

The Autism and EMF chart has numerous links to research papers. It does not matter who oscillatorium is who created the chart. What matters is for the links not to be broken and link to research which it does. 

Likewise, I have designated a [J]  tag for my self posts in which I linked to papers published in medical journals. It does not matter who I am. Just that the links work and link to the papers.

Why the wikis do not link directly to papers is because reddit is all about comments. Redditors would not see the comments.

No need to designate: 'reviews, reports, and meta analyses' and 'primary research'. All are important. [J]  tag includes them all. However, if you would like to adopt a wiki, I will make you an approved contributor so you can create new tags or tag hundreds of posts with [J].  /t/electromagnetics needs wiki volunteers.

366,"""To date, studies of humans exposed to ultrasound have shown the following possible adverse effects: growth retardation, dyslexia, and delayed speech development. (17) But only one effect, a higher rate of left-handedness among boys exposed to neonatal ultrasound, has been observed in at least three separate studies.

Why Worry about Left-handed Boys?

If the only demonstrated result of neonatal ultrasound is more left-handed boys, why be concerned? The answer is twofold. First, left-handedness is statistically linked to many cognitive and developmental problems ranging from learning difficulties to autism to epilepsy.

Second, many researchers view a rising rate of left-handedness as the neurological equivalent a “canary in a coal mine,” a suggestion that other types of minor brain damage may also arise. According to medical reporter Robert Matthews, the increase in left-handedness associated with neonatal ultrasound exposure could be the result of subtle brain damage causing people who ought genetically to be right-handed to become left-handed. (18)

The left-handedness findings were based on health data from children whose mothers underwent lower-voltage scanning in the late 1970s and early 1980s. But by the mid-1990s, average exposure levels had risen significantly. In 2003, the ECMUS Safety Committee noted that time-averaged values of intensity in the most common ultrasound scanning mode, “are now up to 1000 times greater than those reported in the 1970s.” (19) Scientists need to repeat the left-handedness studies, as well as studies of other possible effects, on this younger, more intensively exposed population. To date, such follow-up studies have not been done. (20) Thus, claims that “there has never been a harmful effect shown” simply do not apply to today’s ultrasound equipment.

FDA Reduces Oversight While Increasing Risk Levels

A milestone came in 1993 when the FDA raised the maximum output of ultrasound machines used in obstetrics eightfold, from 94 up to 720 milliwatts per square centimeter. (21) The FDA was persuaded that operators needed greater flexibility, especially when confronting life-and-death situations such as determining blood flows in tiny coronary arteries in the midst of an ongoing heart attack.""

www.askquestions.org/articles/ultrasound/

""Researchers have explored the idea that left-handedness is produced by a brain abnormality, such as a neural defect, perhaps caused by a diminished blood supply to the left hemisphere during fetal growth. Early brain damage in the left hemisphere can result in a shift of language and dominant limb function to the right hemisphere. There does seem to be a correlation between premature birth, prolonged labor, breech births, and the tendency toward left-handedness.""

The Ayurvedic treatment of Guillain-Barre Syndrome consists of treating the nerve damage and the resulting numbness or paralysis. Medicines like Yograj-Guggulu, Kaishor-Guggulu, Trayodashang-Guggulu, Panch-Tikta-Ghrut-Guggulu, Mahavat-Vidhwans-Ras, Vata-Gajankush-Ras, Tapyadi-Loh-Ras and Dashmoolarishta are usually used to treat nerve damage. Herbal medicines like Yashtimadhuk (Glycerrhiza glabra), Manjishtha (Rubia cordifolia), Mandukparni (Centella asiatica), Nirgundi (Vitex negundo) and Dashmool (Ten Roots) are also very useful in this condition.
Medicines which act on the 'Majja' dhatu (tissue) of the body are also very effective in treating this condition and include medicines like Panch-Tikta-Ghrut-Gugggulu, Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia), Amalaki (Emblica officinalis) and Musta (Cyperus rotundus). In addition, localized therapy can also be used in this condition. In the acute phase, lasting for the first 3 to 6 weeks, only medicated steam fomentation is done. After this period, medicated oils are used to massage the body, followed by medicated steam fomentation. Medicines used for these procedures are: Mahanarayan oil, Mahamash oil, Mahasaindhav oil, Dashamool qadha (decoction) and Nirgundi qadha. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), Yashtimadhuk, Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum), and Bhrungraj (Eclipta alba) are used to correct immune dysfunction in the body.

Unani treatment
Paralysis is a general term used to describe the loss of movements and/or sensation following damage to the nervous system. Knowing the precise level of the injury is helpful in predicting which parts of the body will be affected by paralysis and loss of function. Paraplegia describes complete or incomplete paralysis affecting the legs and possibly also the trunk, but not the arms. The extent to which the trunk is affected depends on the level of spinal cord injury. Attempting this form of walking is normally a decision taken in a medical environment. It takes a lot of determination and strength to achieve any success with this sort of walking. It isn't for everyone, indeed many complete paraplegics won't even want to try it.

Use of herbs
Cowhage: Cowhage (Mucuna pruriens) seeds have been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to treat Parkinson's disease. Traditional Ayurvedic medicine and preliminary evidence suggests that cowhage contains 3.6-4.2% levodopa, the same chemical used in several Parkinson's disease drugs. Cowhage treatments have yielded positive results in early studies. However, more research should be conducted to determine the treatment that is most effective.
Ginseng: A clinical study found that patients with neurological disorders may improve when taking Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng). This supports research findings that report Panax ginseng improving cognitive function. More research is needed in this area.
Avoid with known allergy to plants in the Araliaceae family. There has been a report of a serious life-threatening skin reaction, possibly caused by contaminants in ginseng formulations.
Ashwagandha: Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is widely cultivated in India and the Middle East for its medicinal properties, and it is also found in parts of Africa. Ashwagandha is a safe and effective treatment for Parkinson's disease.
Safflower: In clinical research, safflower (Carthamus tinctoria) decreased deterioration caused by Friedreich's ataxia. More high-quality studies with larger sample sizes are needed to establish safflower's effect on neurological conditions.
Avoid if allergic/hypersensitive to safflower, Carthamus tinctorius, safflower oil, daisies, ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, or any related constituents. Use parenteral safflower oil emulsions cautiously in newborns. Use cautiously if taking anticoagulants (blood thinners) or anti-platelet drugs, immunodepressants or pentobarbital. Use cautiously with diabetes, low blood pressure, liver problems, bleeding disorders, or skin pigmentation conditions. Use cautiously if pregnant or breastfeeding.
Belladonna: Belladonna has been used for centuries to treat many medical conditions. To date, human studies have shown a lack of benefit from belladonna in treating autonomic nervous system disorders.
Avoid if allergic to belladonna or plants of the Solanaceae(nightshade) family (bell peppers, potatoes, eggplants). Avoid with a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, heart attack, abnormal heartbeat, congestive heart failure, stomach ulcers, constipation, stomach acid reflux (serious heartburn), hiatal hernia, gastrointestinal disease, ileostomy, colostomy, fever, bowel obstruction, benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, narrow angle glaucoma, psychotic illness, Sjögren's syndrome, dry mouth, neuromuscular disorders, (such as myasthenia gravis), or Down syndrome. Avoid if pregnant or breastfeeding. n

Last year, I submitted many posts on hidden partitions in my hard drives, flashdrives, SD cards and smartphones and Sansa MP3 players. BadBIOS hides in the hidden partitions. I suspect badBIOS also hides in the flashed firmware too. 

I posted inquiring what cloning software can clone the hidden partitions as /u/sloshnmosh was unable to clone them.

It is unknown how to clone the flashed firmware.

If /u/Broncos1994 or you are in the United States or Canada, I can ship:

1. Libreboot X200 laptop.

2.  X200 laptop hackers bricked the BIOS. Won't boot.

3. 10 inch netbook

4.  Motorola Droid 3 smartphones. This month, I rented a car. Connecting my phones to rental car's USB port automatically turned on my phone and the car's media player. The media player's screen says 'scanning for media'. It does not find any on my phone and turns the radio on. I turn my phones off and the radio off. They automatically turn back on.

5. Hard drives, flashdrives, SD cards, Sansa MP3 players and CDs.

Moreover, to conceal documented injuries from the electronic harasment. To make me waste time and keep me from doing things I need to do.

The medical directory also contained contact information of my health practitioners, medical insurance information, etc. Time consuming having to start from scratch by researching online to get contact information.

Noticed all the speeds in everything converging? 3g or whatever it actually is? then int multiples of that? factorize the annoying clock speeds finding gcf and thats your culprit. remember if 432hz = a then 864 hz is a plus an octave (notefreq2n) always an octave up.

458,"**To answer your question regarding deletion of my posts:**

 The majority of my posts contain research. Hackers have repeatedly circumvented my performing research. The wifi of my unactivated Motorola Droid 4 smartphones do not auto connect though the box is ticked. 

Hackers often prevent my devices connecting to wifi. They repeatedly turn wifi off on my devices. 

They frequently log me out of wifi gateways. The wifi password is not saved. I have to manually enter the password each time.

Hackers changed the password to my first account, /u/badbiosvictim. Requests to reset my password resulted in temporary passwords that timed out. Admins did not respond to my requests for help. I created a second account.

On the days I log into reddit, several times per day, hackers log me out of reddit.

After up voting posts and comments, hackers remove my upvotes. I re upvote. They remove my votes.

For months, I was forced to commute to libraries to use libraries computers. Since time is limited on library computers, I skimmed articles and copied and pasted the articles into plain text files on my micro SD cards. I read the articles off line on my 'air gapped' laptops. Hackers deleted the articles or emptied the files.

Last year, I wrote many of my posts off line and commuted to the library to post them. Sometimes, hackers made my micro SD card read only. I could not copy the draft of my plain text files from my 'air gapped' laptops' hard drives. When I wrote the draft and saved to a micro SD card instead of the hard drive, hackers sometimes made my SD card read only to circumvent me from saving my draft.

After posting at the library, I copied and pasted the URL of my posts into the plain text files. Majority of my posts are immediately down voted by a down vote brigade. Several days later, some are removed from the new clique of the front page. Hence, we removed the downvote arrow in /r/badBIOS and /r/electromagnetics.

The removed posts I saved the the URL of, I could bring up in reddit's archive. The posts I had not made a back up of as a plain text file or did not save the URL, were permanently deleted.

Hence, I created a wiki in /r/badbios and /r/electromagnetics to preserve the URLs. While working on /r/badBIOS wiki, I realized more posts than I had realized were removed from the new clique. I reposted what I could.

This week, I was severely hacked creating /r/electromagnetics wiki. After clicking on save, the wiki was saved. However, the additional information was not saved. Refreshing the browser directed to the prior edit of the wiki. The additional information I had entered had not been saved. I had to copy and paste into a plain text file and use a library computer to add more to the text file and copy from text file to the wiki. 

At the library, hackers caused one of my unactivated Motorola Droid 4 smartphones to sound an alarm. The alarm is not of a notification sound that I had chosen. I could not turn the alarm off as it was not a notification that I had set up. Turning the volume down did not turn the volume down. I could not turn off the phone. I had to depart the library to retrieve a T5 torx screwdriver from my car to unscrew the battery cable to remove the battery. To date, I have lost four T5 screws. They jump off the table and I cannot find them on the floor. No one sells T5 screws. I sacrifice T5 screws from my Droid 3 smartphones. They are slightly longer.

Similarly, hackers have sounded an alarm when I try to make a call from my activated Motorola Droid 3 smartphone. I can neither turn off the alarm, nor lower the volume nor turn off the phone nor do a soft reboot by holding the power button and volume button down simultaneously. I keep a spudger in my car to remove the rubberized hard case to get to the battery. Droid 3 batteries are easily removable. I asked the other mods of /r/electromagnetics to work on the wikis.

Hackers who objected to my drafts, circumvented my posting in /r/badbios. I messaged /u/sometree, the founder of /r/badbios for help. He did not help. After becoming a mod of /r/badbios, I discovered they were in the spam filter. The spam filter is a plausible deniability.

Hackers attempt to circumvent me from adding information to my posts and comments. They create a pop up window that says 'Submit Content.' The pop up partially blocks my view.

When I click on my posts, the browser directs to the original post, not the last edited post. If I do not check to see whether it is my last edited post, I inadvertently edit the original post. Thereby, deleting the last information I had inserted. My style of writing is to write long posts. Later, if I come across pertinent information, I may edit a post to include it instead of creating many new posts on the same topic.

Search engines often bring up videos. Hackers circumvented me from watching youtube videos on my laptops and my smartphones. I tried several youtube downloaders to download the videos and watch them off line. The youtube downloaders do not work. Watching videos using library computers is time consuming and uses up my library time.

This is why I rarely link to a video. The few I have linked to are because I read and copied the written introduction and comments. However, hackers often hack youtube to prevent the introduction and comments from loading.

These are inside my RFID shielding money belt that I always wear around my waist.

How the hackers are deleting my files since using the holders is as follows:

(1) They delete or corrupt some of my new plain text files before I have a chance to make back ups.

(2) Before I can copy new files from my devices, hackers brick my devices and/or batteries. In 2015, the hackers remotely bricked three Droid 4 batteries and two Droid 4 phones. In 2014, hackers bricked one Droid 4 battery, four Droid 4 phones, my Droid X phone, HP Compaq laptop and Toshiba Portege R205. They will not boot.

(2) I insert the micro SD card into my 'air gapped' laptop to back up new files from my laptop. I also insert a micro SD card into my phone. Hackers slow the copying and often stop the copying. While I am waiting for the copying and doing other things, they delete files. I look back at the file manager and see copying was stopped. They notice I am looking at the file manager and resume the copying

(3) Hackers almost always prematurely terminate the copying. They close the file manager window. I have to examine the number of files by right clicking on the folder and selecting properties. Times when I have not done so and had not realize copying was incomplete, I relied on the incomplete back ups. I deleted the older back ups. Then when I realize the new back up is incomplete. I cannot retrieve the files from the older back up because I has deleted it.

(4) Hackers hack my droid 3 and droid 4 phones causing the micro sd card not to mount.

(5) Hackers unmount the internal storage of my droid 3 and droid 4 phones. i can neither read nor copy the files. Unfortunately, performing a factory reset erases my new files I could not make a back up of.

(6) To make it less noticeable that they deleted my files, the hackers empty many of my plain text files, PDF files, jpg files. Zero bytes.",2015-08-03 19:39:58+00:00,ctq8qdq,4.0,t1_ctm86re,327803.0,badBIOS
460,"Blogs have replaced forums partly because people want their own website and partly because they do not have knowledge of forums. Search engines brought up blogs and very rarely threads in forums. Majority of the links to the blogs are broken. Else where, OPs complained their blogs were hacked. Yet, they did not cross-post in forums to preserve their  blogs. Forums are not fail proof archives. Three forums were closed down and not cross-posted.

Some OPs may have been suicided. Some OPs could not afford their website and let it go instead of cross-posting. Some OPs complained zombie zapping intensified due to their posting.  Adversion learning. Are articles and blogs not preserved because of subliminal messages #2 and #3?

The majority of the few blogs and threads search engines brought up are written by people who are dumbed down (cognitive decline). They have no interest in ultrasound shielding, zombie zapping shielding, what meters and antennas to purchase to evidence subliminal hearing and zombie zapping or how to become safe. I had expected others would have researched these topics. I had not expected that I would have to conduct research from scratch. 

After five months of research, I found few credible articles to post in /r/badBIOS. Entering one search word in a search engine brought up only several pages of results.  Whereas, it should have brought up many pages.


Credible articles were brought up by entering two search terms. For example, ""HAARP"" and ""frequency"" brought up an article on 
Radio Hypnotic Inter Cerebral Control (RHIC)

https://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/3eub53/us_government_electromagnetic_mind_control/

Whereas, entering just ""HAARP"", which I did months earlier, should have brought it up. 

Entering ""Dr. Milton Zaret""  and ""project PANDORA"" brought up an article I linked to at:

 https://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/3f8c4g/ross_adey_induces_calcium_efflux_in_brain_tissue/

Whereas, entering just ""Project Pandora"", which I did months earlier, did not bring up the article. Search engines censor.


There is slightly more articles and self posts on voice to skull (V2K) than subliminal messages though microwave auditory effect can induce both. Yet, few OPs actually disclose the auditory messages.

I came across only one self post on subliminal messages. The OP wrote he was nothing but did not elaborate. He actually used the word nothing. I copied the URL into a plain text file but cannot find the file. 

I am ""nothing"" directs attention away from one's self. This is disassociation.  CIA's Project MONARCH created disassociation in its subjects. Disassociation rendered subjects more susceptible to hypnotic suggestions. Subliminal messages and zombie zapping have a hypnotic effect and replaced formal hypnosis. 

Disassociation can create objective evidence that could be used to institutionalize targets.  Such as not taking care of one's physical needs. Inducing disassociation makes suicided easier. Suicided means covertly forcing the target to commit suicide instead of overly assassinating the target.

Martin Bott explained the technology of suicided and subliminal messages in 'Torture, Brainwashing &amp; Murder in Germany'. Click on English in the upper left hand column. The link to download the PDF article will appear.  http://www.totalitaer.de/ Subliminal messages starts on page 4. Suicided starts on page 11.

I do not have disassociation. I do not have an inferiority complex. For the past 1 ½ years, I have defended myself on reddit. Were I had an inferiority complex, I would not have done so. 

I do not have a history of mental illness. I do not have the biochemistry of mental illness. I am not depressed. I am not suicidal. 

Prior to my devices being infected with badBIOS, I have previously successfully eluded, relocated, found safe housing, removed my wifi card and hard drive, purchased new USB network adapters to change MAC address, booted my infected netbooks to live linux DVDs and safely connected to the internet. After my devices were infected with badBIOS, I had successfully relocated. 

Unlike /u/ BadBiosSavior, I cannot turn on my devices or insert my removable media into a clean computer without getting tracked. If I purchase an older device, air gap it and refrain from plugging it into an outlet, I could become and remain safe again. I have an inverter plugged into the cigarette lighter of my car and a surge protector plugged into the inverter. Locations of automated license plate readers need to be ascertained and avoided.



I am resisting the subliminal messages. Removing the speakers from my devices, refraining from listening to my infected music, taking medicinal herbs and wearing an iron pot while sleeping helps. So does earthing daily by waking barefoot on early morning dew in parks and walking barefoot in ocean waves in dog beaches. Moisture increases conductivity. /r/electromagnetics wiki has posts on earthing.

I take some of the medicinal herbs listed in:

https://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/2yuy2b/ultrasound_and_emr_suppress_pineal_glands/

Passion flower tincture and syrian rue tincture for pineal gland. I eat shitaki and maitake mushrooms. The ayurvedic herbs brahmi tincture, cumin, turmeric tincture, sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) tincture and Indian cardamon tea. I will purchased the ayurvedic herbs tulsi and shankapushpi (Convolvulus pluricaulis) which is in the morning glory family. Starting this week, I resumed blending and drinking raw somagenic and soma-enhancing food. 

Zombie zapping causes snow blindness (sensitivity to light). I had relinquished driving and stored my car. During the day time, sunlight was too bright. At night, headlights, reflector strips in highway lanes, street lights, traffic lights, etc. were too bright. Wearing an iron pot while sleeping partially shields zombie zapping.  Sensitivity to light lessens. I am able to drive again, get a sun tan and earth barefoot in bright sunshine. 

This protocol helps for how long? The zombie zapping started when I started researching online for alternatives to live linux DVDs. 

The buzzing briefly started in April 2014 the next morning after talking to a plaintiff who commented in a blog on badBIOS. Her defendant, a former employer in the United States, hired hackers and electronic harassment. She stated she was being electronically harassed with buzzing and shocks and believes the shocks caused MS. Electromagnetic fields demylinate sheaths. 

After ceasing communication with her, the buzzing stopped. Buzzing resumed a year ago, in summer of 2014 because I continued posting in /r/badBIOS. A year later, in April 2015, I contacted the plaintiff again. Despite, the electronic harassment, she did not settle or dismiss her lawsuit.

'The Hum' started four months ago, in April 2015, as retaliation for posting on buzzing in /r/badBIOS.   

Hearing simultaneously buzzing and humming is like the Squawk Box:

""Acoustic, Squawk Box. Crowd dispersal weapon field tested by the British Army in Ireland in 1973. This directional device emits two ultrasonic frequencies which when mixed in the human ear become intolerable. It produces giddiness, nausea or fainting. The beam is so small that is can be directed at specific individuals in a riot situation""

http://infrakshun.blogspot.com/2011/04/sound-wave-part-iii.html?m=1

More years of buzzing, humming and zombie zapping will force me to relocate and stay safe.

The fact that I haven't tried to do so this year could indicate ""you can do nothing"" is having an effect on me. Few people would self sacrifice themselves by being a sitting duck to warn others. If there were enough people adequately warning others, I would not need to do so. I would link post to their articles and elude. We need several Edward Snowden.

On the other hand, if my subconscious fully believed ""I could do nothing"" I would not spend my time warning others. 

Yet, by warning others, ""I can do nothing."" Meaning, I am not relocating and being safe.


/u/BadBiosSavior and I posted on ultrasonic cyber warfare to warn other hacked victims. We did not post a report of our meters measurements. I will be buying meters and posting reports.  Whether you believe we were hacked and electronically assaulted is not vital. Be aware the technology exists and is being used by nation-states, oligarchy corporate-states and organized crime.

The /var/logs were saved to for forensics.  Hackers deleted many of these back up /var/logs. I cannot replace most of them because most of my netbooks and laptops I had discarded, donated or sold. My HP Compaq Presario laptop and Toshiba Portege R205 were bricked by the hackers.

Because the back up /var/logs were deleted, I could go back only as far as the last compressed /var/log/sys.log. I unzipped it. I compared it with the new plain text sys.log.

The iron pot is thick and heavy but only partially shields.

To choose which fabric to buy, you need to test what you are being exposed to electric and/or magnetic or ultrasound, their frequency and strength.

Iron, steel, nickle, cobalt, molybdenum and magnets shield magnetic fields.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)

Silver and copper shield electric fields. Lesseremf's hats will partially shield electric fields but not magnetic fields nor ultrasound.

Ultrasound shielding needs further research and a post of its own.

Which ever you buy, wear two simultaneously. For example, steel for magnetic fields. Silver for electric fields. Alternatively, two silver hats.

If you buy the hats, please advise whether they help.",2015-07-20 18:59:53+00:00,ct9zwxe,2.0,t1_ct9ygxr,2115.0,badBIOS

You are right  an iron cookie box would make a great fornsic bag. I looked for an iron cookie box on Amazon and eBay in United States but none for sale. I never seen   them at antique stores. 

Your recommendation of an external keyboard would be fine for work on a desk. I carry my laptop around in my backpack and often use it on my lap. I will try the iron griddle on my lap. If that does not provide adequate protection, I will use a desk and external keyboard.

I apologize for the delay in responding. I wanted to retest with a hand held gauss meter. Good DC gauss meters are over $300. Since a body volt meter, AC gauss meters and/or a RF meter are higher priorities, I searched for a more accurate Android gauss meter app.

Magnetic stud finder app by GoldSequence offers recalibratation.

To find the location of the magnetic sensor in my Motorola Droid 4 smartphone, I rotated it next to a brand new 10.5 inch cast iron griddle. The magnetic sensor is in the top center of the phone.

Base reading outside on a first floor balcony is 44 uT.

I removed the battery from my Lenovo X200 battery. Unplugged.

I placed the top of the phone on the left hand central edge of the Lenovo X200 laptop where the tab key is. 1,265 uT

I moved the phone up to the left hand upper edge of the laptop where the F1 key is. 1,484 uT

Middle of left bezel of screen screen is 257 uT.
Upper left hand corner of screen bezel is 149 uT.

I flipped over the laptop. The top of laptop (exterior screen) 210 uT.
Back of bottom of laptop 1,480 uT

In comparison, I placed the smartphone on top of the iron griddle 111 uT.

For the measurements to be so high, there must be a magnet behind the keyboard and a magnet on the screen.

In comparison, I placed the phone on a refrigerator magnet. 324 uT. The refrigerator magnet is weak compared to the laptop magnets.

Neodymium is the strongest magnet. Are lid closure sensors made of neodymium magnets?

On his own, fragglet cyberstalked, bullied and threadjacked me in three subreddits: /r/rfelectronics, /r/hacking and /r/outoftheloop. 


Previously, neither fragglet nor xandercruise had posted in the above mentioned 24 subreddits except xandercruise had posted in /r/conspiracy. Xandercruise is an antisemite. He bullied Jews cultivated a 'reptilian brain' by 'inbreeding with other psychopathic 'noble' bloodlines.
https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/e58tp/dvid_ickes_newest_book_human_race_get_off_your/c15eqzo 

Through the present date, they commented in these subreddits solely regarding me except xandercruise posted on another matter in /r/hacking.

Prior to April 2014, Fragget had not previously posted nor commented on computer security and spyware. Prior to April 2014, Xandercruise had not posted on spyware but had previously posted in /r/netsec. 

Fragget and Xandercruise cyberstalked me to /r/badBIOS. All their comments in /r/badBIOS regarded me. They complained I was the main OP but Fragglet posted only one post. His post was on discrediting me. 

Their intent is to debunk badBIOS and all the topics I am commenting on and posting on in all of reddit.com and to discredit me. They post numerous comments in my posts in nineteen subreddits. They unduly influencing redditors to parrot what they are writing and downvote. They created downvote brigades to immediately downvote my posts to zero. They caused some of my posts to be quicky removed from the new queue. 

To conceal their voting brigade, fragglet and xandercruise deleted most of their earlier discrediting comments. They even deleted comments in archived posts.  Xandercruise  he edited his comments in /r/snowden and /r/badbios AFTER he was banned.

Typically, I include the redditor's name in my reply. Examing my comments in the entire year evidences their vote brigading.

Fragglet gaslighted by criticizing my complaint regarding posts being removed from the new queue as paranoia.

/m/sometree, founder and moderator of /r/badBIOS, warned fragglet not to bully. Fragglet refused to comply with rules. He promised to leave /r/badBIOS. On September 14, 2014, fragglet created /r/truebadbios. Fragglet breached his promise. He returned to /r/badBIOS to continuing bullying me and was banned.

Xandercruise and pure60 commented they were defecting to /r/truebadbios. They lied. They continued to bully in /r/badBIOS and were banned. Their attempt to draw subscribers away from /r/badBIOS failed. No subscribers defected who had not been banned in /r/badBIOS.

By the end of the sixth month, in March 2015, /r/truebadbios had a mere 19 subscribers and fragglet and xandercruise were the sole OPs. They improperly cross-posted from /r/badBIOS without acknowledging /r/badBIOS. 

/r/truebadbios' stated purpose in the sidebar is to discuss badBIOS. Whereas, the actual intention was a subreddit to post bullying comments that was not independently moderated. Xandercruise had been banned in /r/modhelp, banned and unbanned in /r/snowden and banned twice in /r/badbios. Xandercruise was banned from digg.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/pd3jv/the_antifree_speech_squad_is_at_it_again_trying/c3omwod

They posted link posts and threadjacked their own posts by writing bullying comments about me. I defended myself. Fragglet banned me and removed my comments. I could no longer defend myself. 

Their bullying intensified. Xandercruise again attempted to doxx me. I PM fragglet. Fragglet removed the comments but refused to remove the links he created using archivetoday which contained attempted doxxing. Thereby, Fragglet deceptively continued to be complicit in attempted doxxing. 

Fragglet and Xandercruise bully behind my back. Fragglet refers to me as BBV. In /r/undelete, I requested fragglet to call me by my moniker, badbiosvictim, to enable reddit to send notices when redditors refer to my moniker. Fragglet refused. 

Instead of directly posting a comment to my post so reddit would notify me, Xandercruise randomly replies to any commentor in my posts. His reply has nothing to do with the commentors' comment. His reply is discrediting. Xandercruise does not refer to me by my name. Reddit does not notify me. 

In /r/truebadbios, Htilonom defended /r/badBIOS and me. Fragglet banned him. Fragglet banned us from /r/truebadbios though we did not violate any rules.

In March 2015, fragglet invited cojoco to be a mod. Cojoco is a mod of over 140 subreddits. Cojoco promoted his new subreddit by placing /r/truebadbios on the top of the list of relevant subreddits in /r/snowden's sidebar and posting propaganda in /r/snowden, a subreddit he mods. Cojoco misrepresented in the title of his post that /r/truebadbios is unique and in a comment debunked /r/badBIOS.

https://www.reddit.com/r/snowden/comments/301ylm/this_sub_unqiue_on_reddit_aims_to_track_bios/

The propaganda increased subscribers to /r/truebadBIOS from 19 to a mere 36 subscribers. The number of OPs grew from 2 to 3. TheGhostofDusty posted one link post after he was banned from /r/badBIOS. Presently, /r/truebadBIOS has a mere 21 posts after Fragglet removed two of his posts. The majority of the posts are not on badBIOS. Three of the posts attempted to debunk /r/badBIOS and me. 

/r/truebadbios had a mere seven commentors including fragglet and xandercruise less htilonom who fragglet banned = six commentors.

Whereas, after /r/truebadbios was created in September 14, 2014, /r/badBIOS grew by over 200 new subscribers. 

On April 19, 2014, when I subscribed to /r/badBIOS, there were 36 subscribers. Presently, /r/badBIOS has 374 subscribers. The URL to traffic is in /r/badBIOS' sidebar. 

Due to banning fragglet and xandercruise, the number of OPs grew to twelve plus anonymous submissions. If redditors had believed the propaganda created by Fragglet, Xandercruise and Cojoco, /r/truebadbios would have gained more subscribers and OPs and /r/badBIOS would have lost subscribers OPs. Whereas, /r/badBIOS significantly increased in subscribers, OPs and commentors.

In the past year, xandercruise wrote over 200 bullying comments. Fragglet wrote over 150 bullying comments. If they held full time outside jobs, they would not have the time to debunk badBIOS and discredit me. Obviously, they are shills and /r/truebadBIOS is a front.

I suspect you are an alt account of xandercruise. He commented in this post and subsequently deleted his comment. Xandercruise deleted numerous comments over more than a year in numerous subreddits he cyberstalked and bullied me in.

Part 1 of response to FAQ:

The fragglet, xandercruise and telnet cyberstalking gang prevent me from being automatically notified of their bullying by:

(1) Replying to a commenter instead of directly commenting to my post; and

(2) Using a nickname they made up instead of referring to my moniker.

The BadBIOSVictim FAQ was written by Fragglet who was banned from /r/badBIOS.  Fragglet refused to disclose that the links in the BadBiosvictim FAQ and Truebadbios FAQ contain links to archivetoday webpages he created. Fragglet intentionally led redditors to believe they are URLS of reddit.com. He refused to use actual reddit URLs. 

Fragglet created more than one archivetoday webpage allegedly of the identical reddit webpage. In numerous subreddits, Fragglet and Xandercruise link to the various different archivetoday webpages of the allegedly identical reddit webpage. For example, Fragglet's link to his open letter has two different URLs: 
(1) https://archive.today/bNNZX and 
(2) https://archive.today/TkPHB 

Fragglet's fake webpages neither contain new comments nor any editing of the post and comments. If a mod removes a comment or a redditor deletes his comment, the comments should not be reposted or linked to. Fragglet violated reddit's rule prohibiting reposting deleted or removed material.

Fragglet refused to remove /u/xandercruise's attempted doxxing of me in the FAQ. As a mod, I removed xandercruise's doxxing. However, by repeatedly referring the archivetoday webpage, they repeatedly attempt to dox. 

In TruebadBios FAQ, Fragglet links to an archivetoday webpage he created. 
https://archive.today/iSpBl 

Fragglet led redditors to believe it was an actual /r/OutOfTheLoop wepage. Fragglet concealed that his archivetoday webpage contains his three comments that were removed by mods of /r/OutOfTheLoop. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2pva69/what_is_badbios_actually_and_whats/ 

By reposting his comments that had been removed by mods, fragglet is violating reddit rules.

In September 2014, Fragglet posted TrueBadBios FAQ and Badbiosvictim FAQ. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBadBios/comments/2gcvz9/badbiosvictim_faq/ 

After six months, Reddit archives posts. Archived posts can no longer be edited. However, at any time the comments in archived posts can be edited or deleted. 

Fragglet reposted his two FAQs and deleted the original FAQs. Fragglet: ""I actually wrote this months ago. I'm just reposting it now because it was coming up to the 6 months mark and I want to be able to keep updating it in the future.""

https:/www.reddit.com/r/TrueBadBios/comments/2vpkzs/badviousvictim_faw/colldnx

In the two FAQs, Fragglet intentionally mispresented what I had written. His facts are erroneous. For example, he wrote I became a mod of /r/badBIOS in January 2014 whereas, I became a mod in 2015.

In TrueBadBios FAQ, Fragglet misrepresented that I expressed a desire to ban 'naysayers' who disagree with him.Fragglet linked to an archivetoday page he created from my post on naysayers. Whereas, my post had chronicled the bullying of subscribers who were forced to stop posting. All the bullies were from other subreddits who had cyberstalked me to /r/badBIOS and bullied other subscribers and me. Fragglet complained I was the main OP. This was od their doing as their gang intimidated  subscribers.

I never banned redditors who disagreed with me. Rules of /r/badBIOS prohibit bullying. I banned bullies. Xandercruise was extremely vicious. /u/xandercruise swore: ""cease misrepresenting and threadjacking my cock. Do not swear or bully my asshole.""

In Badbiosvictim FAQ, Fragglet misrepresented: "" ""He drilled through a chip on his computer's motherboard, and when the computer stopped working, ""hackers"" must again be to blame."" Whereas, I had written: ""I had a hole drilled in the ethernet chip of my R205 since I could not remove the ethernet chip. Afterwards, R205 booted OK. That week, hackers bricked my R205.""

Likewise,  drilling a hole in the ethernet chip of my Lenovo X200 laptop # did not impair its function.

Fragglet misrepresented I have 'simulated' hallucinations. Whereas, hearing buzzing and humming is not a hallucation.

Both FAQs debunk badBIOS and discredit /r/badBIOS, other subscribers and me:  ""The subreddit has recently begun to attract other users who show signs of paranoid mental disorders, some of whom even describe having been diagnosed as such (example). So it has essentially become something akin to an echo chamber for mentally ill people to feed off each others' paranoid delusions."" His example was one of /u/snoshnmosh's posts. Snoshnmosh is not mentally ill.

Fragglet resides in the same country as /u/snoshnmosh and I. Fragglet refused to conduct forensics on laptops, removable media and hard drives I had offered to ship to him. Forensics is the evidence that hacking victims are truly being hacked. 

Throughout the year, I have offered to donate my laptops, removable media, hard drives and smartphones to forensics. Fragglet and Xandercruise bullied to discourage redditors from volunteering to conduct forensics. Nonetheless, they ignored the forensics others performed.

Fragglet ignored the forensics /u/snoshnmosh conducted. He completely ignored the forensics I conducted on my infected personal files (txt, doc, .pdf, jpg and thumb.db) and hidden partitions in my removable media and hard drives. See /r/BadBIOS' wiki for my forensics. 

In the Badbiosvictim FAQ, Fragglet linked to an archivetoday webpage he created from an open letter he posted on August 29, 2014 in /r/badBIOS.  The majority of redditors he quoted were from comments in my older posts in other subreddits in which he or xandercruise had instigated the bullying. The redditors were merely parroting them. 

Months later, they concealed evidence of vote brigading by deleting most of their comments. Comments in archived posts, removed posts and deleted posts can be edited or deleted at any time if the redditor saved the URL of the post. 

Fragglet and Xandercruise deleted most of their comments from my posts on the front page, my archived posts, my posts that were removed from the front page and my posts I had deleted due to their vote brigading and attempted doxxing. 

Xandercruised lied about deleting comments in /r/onion and his post in /r/conspiratard: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/25ui7i/badbiosvictim_obsessed_with_posting_proof_that/ 

After I posted messages from the two mods who had removed his post, Xandercruise admitted writing the post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/33cs8k/enigmabox_obfuscates_metadata_and_shields_pc/cqk96j9 

Within the same week, Xandercruise misrepresented in /r/linux that his gang uses archivetoday to circumvent me from removing or deleting a post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/33u9ny/intel_me_power_line_hacking_can_be_active_even/ 

Whereas, xandercruise acknowleged in /r/onions that his post which was removed by mods of /r/conspiratard was still in his submission history. From his submission history, I posted the URL in /r/onions. Xandercruise deleted his removed post. Because 	I saved the URL, it can be brought up any time:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/25ui7i/badbiosvictim_obsessed_with_posting_proof_that/ 

There is no need to use archivetoday to preserve posts.Xandercruise deleted his comment in /r/linux.

Fragglet posted his open letter before volunteers conducted forensics and before I conducted forensics starting in September 2014. 

Exactly a year ago, in April 2014, fragglet and xandercruise formed a gang. They commenced gang cyberstalking, bullying and threadjacking my first account, /u/badbiosvictim, in /r/onions. Previously, they had never posted in /r/onions. Subsequently, they posted solely regarding me in /r/onions.

Together, fragget and xandercruise gang cyberstalked, bullied and threadjacked me from /r/onions to six reddits: /r/privacy, /r/snowden, /r/RESissues, /r/badBIOS, /r/undelete and /r/nolibsWatch. Previously, they had never posted nor commented in these subreddits. Subsequently, they commented solely regarding me except xandercruise commented regarding another matter in /r/privacy.

They drilled one screw into the keyboard partly damaging the keyboard. They returned my laptop in a different place than where I had stored it in a sleeve.

553,"""Electromagnetic pollution (EMP) falls into 4 categories that differ but are related. They include:

1. power frequency (50/60 Hz) electromagnetic fields (EMFs)

2. dirty electricity (DE): high frequency spikes on electrical wires (transients, harmonics, etc.)

3. ground current and contact current problems (GC/CC): both 50/60 Hz as well as higher frequency events (similar to dirty electricity)

4. radio frequency radiation: MHz and GHz range from wireless technology.

People react to some combination of the EMP I mention above and there are different ways of dealing with each of these problems.

The Graham Stetzer filters are designed to remove frequencies primarily in the 4 to 100 kHz range that ride on electrical wires. They do not affect ground current, the 50/60 Hz fields, or RFR. These filters can make a significant difference in health as our studies have shown.

However, the filters are NOT the complete answer for people with electrical hypersensitivity (EHS) if they are exposed to other forms of EMP.

If they live near cell phone antennas then they have to shield themselves from RFR. Some of this can come into the home along wires.
Dave Stetzer and I measured this in Bermuda and found a radio station (103 FM) coming in through the wiring in a guest house where we were staying. We were able to measure it on a brass lamp next to my bed and also on my bed. When we unplug the lamp the radiation on the wire disappeared but we were still measuring RFR in the air from the radio antenna. We did these measurements because Dave is sensitive and he began to feel ill when he sat in a chair next to the lamp. The brass acted like an antenna because when we measured a different lamp the readings were much lower. So shielding a window, wall or roof may not eliminate the problem entirely if it is on the wire.

If people have serious ground current problems, the GS filters are not going to solve that either. The utility has to put the current back on the wire where it belongs.""

1.  Turn all lights and appliances on in house or office.

2.  Measure each wall outlet with the Stetzer Micro-Surge Meter and record readings on paper.

3.  Place filters at the highest meter reading locations first which will be at the locations of the largest internal generators of DE inside your house.

4.  As you place filters readings over the entire house will begin to go lower.

5.  Repeat this process until all Stetzer Meter readings are below 50 GS units.

6.  You will not need a filter for every outlet and you want to use a few as necessary
