&gt;146)  Sesamum indicum 
The seeds of S. indicum (sesame) are used as a demulcent in respiratory affections, infantile cholera, diarrhea, dysentery and other bowel affections and bladder diseases. The seed powder is known to be benefit in amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, ulcers and bleeding piles. The active component sesaminol is reported to its antioxidative, neuroprotective effects. Other lignan from sesamne, sesamol, has been offered protection against increased blood pressure, hyperlipidaemia [249]. Recently, Harikumar et al [250] found that sesamin, lignan from S. indicum, inhibited the proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the colon, prostate, breast, pancreas, and lung. Sesamin also potentiated TNF-induced apoptosis and this correlated with the suppression of gene products linked to cell survival (Bcl-2 and survivin), proliferation (cyclin D1), inflammation (COX-2), invasion (MMP-9, ICAM-1), and angiogenesis (VEGF). Sesamin downregulated constitutive and inducible NF-κB activation induced by various inflammatory stimuli and carcinogens, and inhibited the degradation of IκBα, through the suppression of phosphorylation of IκBα and inhibition of activation of IκB kinase, thus resulting in the suppression of p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.

My doctor prescribed a refill of nystatin. Its a high dose. 1,000,000 units per pill three times per day compounded by a compound pharmacy. I will further research candida treatments before taking nystatin again. I submitted a post on borax which I will take with nystatin but am looking for more antifungals.

Important to identify which amino acid deficiencies are biomarkers of radio wave sickness.  Examining the amino acids wikis, lysine and serine deficiencies are biomarkers. They were low in my past amino acids test and are low in my current test. Elevated quinolinic acid ratio depletes serine. My repeat organic acid test found I still have an elevated quinolinic acid ratio.  Serine protects the brain. Serine deficiency renders the brain vulnerable to brain zapping.

There are other deficiencies but volunteers need to find papers to ascertain whether they too are biomarkers of RWS.

I am puzzled why I am high in taurine. Prior to the test, I have been taking glutathione, carnitine and n-acetylcysteine.

I would like to compare the current and past tests and research the results. However, my navel continues to be lasered every night while I sleep.

It is found that AT&amp;T set the U-verse router's wireless network transmitter at full power, which is 400,000 uW/m2!!! even at 3 meter away from the router, the radiation detected by the device is as high as 4000 uW/m2. According the Bau-Biologie exposure standards, safe RF radiation for human in sleep should be below 1 uW/m2 (microWatts per square meter) and below 0.1 uW/m2 for digital pulsed radiation signals.

Page 5:

&gt;Vinogradov et al. [1987] reviewed the results of  these  immunological  studies  and  concluded that exposure to UHF fields at a power density
of  500 mW/cm2 irreversibly  damages  organisms; 50 mW/cm2 induces  some  effects,  often  non-pathogenic; and 10 mW/cm2 does not affect any
immunological parameters.

Page 6:

&gt;When determining the limit values for mobile
telecommunications technology, the RNCNIRP de-
cided to leave the limit value of 10mW/cm2 for the
general public unchanged, as it was set in 1984
and this value was well justified by previous research
so there was no need for change. Thus, base stations
should not expose the public to more than 10mW/cm2.

&gt;To set the limit value for mobile phone users, an assessment of domestic and foreign studies was made by the RNCNIRP, and limits were set based on
the results of an animal study performed earlier in
the Research Institute of Occupational Medicine in
Moscow, Russia by Rubtsova and Paltsev, but only
published in 2006, (110 rats, Global System for
Mobile Communications (GSM) 900 and 1800 MHz
at 0.5 and 2 mW/cm2 for 1 h/day for 40 days) [Rubtsova and Paltsev, 2006]. They reported changes in the immune status of animals exposed to 500mW/cm2. The results of this study were in general agreement with  earlier  studies  indicating  that  exposure  to 500mW/cm2 produced immune system changes con-
sidered pathogenic to the organism. A safety factor of 5 was applied to this power density, leading to a limit value of 100 uW/cm2 recommended for mobile
phone users [Russian Standard, 2003]. This Russian
standard regulates mobile phones and their base
stations and was approved by Russia’s Chief Health
Physician  under  federal  law  (‘‘On  the  sanitary
and epidemiological welfare of the population’’,
30 March 1999, No. 52-FZ). However, as indicated
to the RNCNIRP by Repacholi [2006], there are
dosimetric concerns about compliance with these
standards for mobile phones when a power density
limit for mobile phone handsets is used for near-field exposures.

While I was converting centimeter per square to meter per square, hackers altered the standard in the text that I had copied and pasted from uW to mW. I corrected it. 

uW/cm2 is microwatt per square centimeter.  Quanta Monitor app by Cellraid uses uW/m which is microwatts per square meter. The conversion from microwatts per square centimeter (uW/cm2) to microwatts per square meter (uW/m2) is:
1,000,000 μW/m² = 100 uW/cm2. The Russian standard of 100 uW/cm2 = 1,000,000 uW/m2.

Page 11:

&gt;The various USSR and Russian standards com-
mittees considered that chronic exposure to non-
thermal levels of RF fields was potentially hazardous
to human health. Further, the key philosophy used to
set limit values in the Russian standards was that RF
exposure should not produce any effect that had to
be  compensated  for  by  people  because  it  was
believed that this would lead to pathologic effects
over the long term [Grigoriev et al., 2003b,c]. As
noted above, this was not the philosophy for setting
limit values adopted by other national standards com-
mittees or by either the ICNIRP or the IEEE. Fur-
thermore, the USSR and Russian committees did not
consider dosimetry in their standard setting. It was
not recognized that for the same power density, the
absorption in mice and rats can be orders of magni-
tude higher than in humans.
There are concerns about the assessment of
compliance with the limits for mobile handsets in the
mobile phone and base station standard [Russian
Standard, 2003] because it is not valid to just have
power density limits for near-field exposures. Compliance with the head exposure limit of 100 uW/cm2 is assessed by ensuring that the power density is not
more than 3 uW/cm2 at a distance of 37 cm from
the phone. This is not a measurement in the near
field where exposures to the head occur. Because
compliance is assessed in the far field, higher specific
absorption rate (SAR) phones measured in the near
field can give a lower power density at 37 cm than
lower SAR phones [Repacholi, 2006].
The philosophy of protection of the public—
that RF exposure of individuals should not cause any
compensatory response—is not used in standards out-
side of Russia. National authorities in most countries
want to know what health effects they are protecting
against and not make assumptions about what effects
may occur. This is the philosophy of the ICNIRP and
IEEE committees.",Electromagnetics,[J] [Standards: Eastern European] [Power Density] Scientific basis for the Soviet and Russian radiofrequency standards for the general public,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/5a0wx5/j_standards_eastern_european_power_density/

Applicable RF Exposure Standards 

Several guidelines or standards exist that recommend safe upper limits for human exposure to RF fields.  These include limits 
developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers  (IEEE,  1999),  guideline  published  by  the  International Commission  on  Non-ionizing  Radiation  Protection  (ICNIRP,  1998)  and  those 
promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC, 1997) relative to human exposure to RF fields 2 Of these, the exposure guidelines of the FCC  are most relevant to the evaluation of potential exposure because the AMR system equipment is regulated by the FCC.  The FCC maximum permissible exposure (MPE) values are tabulated in Appendix  A  and  are usually  expressed  in  terms  of  the  plane  wave  equivalent  power density of the RF field or the strength of the electric and/or magnetic field components of 
the RF field.  Power density is expressed as power per unit area 
and is most commonly given in units of milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2) or watts per square meter (W/m2).    Electric  field  strength  is  specified 
in  units  of  volts  per  meter  (V/m)  or, sometimes, microvolts per meter (μV/m), or in decibels relative to a microvolt per meter (dBμV/m)
.    
The  FCC  exposure  limits  are,  strictly,  applied  to  FCC  licensees  such  as operators  of  radio  and  television  broadcast  stations, 
two-way  radio  communications systems, cellular telephone base stations, etc. 

Page 8:

Therefore, the decibels are compared to the MPE limit; for example, a va
lue of 0 dB means an RF power density (RF field) value equal to the MPE.  A value of -10 dB means the AMR device produces an RF 
field that is one-tenth of the MPE, -20 dB is 1/100 
of the MPE, -30 db is 1/1000 of the MPE, and so forth. The results are also provide
d as power density in units of microwatts 
per  square  centimeter  (μW/cm2)

APPENDIX A - LIMITS FOR MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE (MPE) 
Adopted by the Federal Communications Commission 
(Reference = Table 1. Title 47 CFR) 

The United States Federal Communications Commi
ssion (FCC) first adopted guidelines to be 
used for human exposure to RF emissions in 1985. The FCC revised and updated their guidelines 
August 1, 1996, as a result of a rule-making pr
oceeding initiated in 1993.  The FCC Office of 
Engineering and Technology issued a new Evaluating Compliance document OET-Bulletin 65 in 
August 1997. The new guidelines incorporate limits
 for maximum permissible exposure (MPE) in 
terms of electric and magnetic 
field strength and power density 
for transmitters operating between 
300 kHz And 100 GHz.

The unrooted phones with Android operating system turned on and automatically turned on. They were bricked. I discarded them after saving the T5 screws and battery. 

The rooted phone with CyangenMod operating system stayed on after turning the phone on. However, merely turning my phone on or charging it still zapped my brain. 

I had one back up phone left. I destroyed the 4G LTE chip on my other Verizon Motorola Droid 4.  Skyworks 77483 700MHz LTE PA module is depicted in step #15.

Underneath the black silicon is a shiny mirror with an icon of the state of Texas. Texas Instruments uses this icon. Using a screwdriver, this chip can be scraped off.

This phone only had its 4G LTE destroyed. I didn't destroy its larger Qualcomm chip because the phone is not rooted. Destroying the 4G chip didn't block microwaves either. 

Thereafter, I use the two phones to take photos. I use a landline phone, a battery operated alarm clock and laptop for everything else. Being brain zapped while taking photos has discourage me from taking photos.

I downloaded Quanta Monitor by Cellraid.

I conducted this test using the phone with a destroyed 4G LTE chip. The test was performed in my room on October 27, 2106. I removed the SIM card in the beginning of 2016. Hence, there is no option to turn on 4G or call 911. Airplane mode is on. Wifi and bluetooth are off. SAR is at 0 W/kg. Power density is at 16,736 uW/m2. It is in the red zone of the dial.

These readings are extremely high! My brain is zapped much stronger than when I use wi-fi on my laptop. The modulation is worse than the power density. The modulation impedes with concentration and attention.

Turning bluetooth on and off did not effect the measurements.

Airplane mode off, wifi off and bluetooth off. SAR is zero W/kg. However, power density is 16,736 to 16,753 uW. This is very high.

Turning airplane mode back on did not effect power density. The power density remained at 16,736. 

Power Density is the measure of the power of an electromagnetic wave crossing an area at a right angle to the direction of wave propagation. Measured in watts per square metre.

Google Play requires a Google account which I do not have. The newest version is at:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kr.sira.vibration&amp;hl=en

I held my unactivated Motorola Droid 4 phone by my right ear and left ear. The speaker was emitting a medium pitch humming sound which vibrated my ear drum. This is the first time I was able to confirm my phone is infected with a spyware that uses ultrasound. In addition to the humming emitted by my phone, there is much louder and vibrational lower pitch humming attacking my ears.

I cleared the meter between taking new measurements. Pushing down the off button and lower volume button to take a screenshot increases the vibration measurement by 0.1.  Moving the phone from my ears or head to see the measurement slightly increases the reading.  The test would be more accurate if someone held the phone next to my head and ears and looked at the  measurement without moving the phone. Nonetheless, readings above my brain shielding are the highest. Ultrasound power is increased when I wear brain shielding. The next highest reading is above my bare head. Then my ears. Lowest reading is when the phone is on a table by my office chair or away from me.

An environmental medicine practitioner #1 prescribed B12 injections. I gave myself B12 injections. When I discovered B12 was available in sublingual form, I stopped the injections.

A neurologist ordered a methylmalonic acid test. My level was high which indicated B12 deficiency. I increased the sublinguall dosage and started taking sublingual methylcobalamin B12.

Subsequently, a holistic doctor ordered a vitamin and mineral panel from SpectraCell Lab.

https://www.spectracell.com/patients/patient-micronutrient-testing/

My B12 serum was within range. Despite my B12 serum test being within range, my environmental medicine practitioner #4 prescribed high dosages of sublingual methylcobalamin B12 manufactured by Perque and liquid folic acid for methylation. I didn't notice a difference.

A SpectraCell Lab vitamin and mineral panel reported my B12 was high. I erroneously assumed my environmental medicine practitioner #4 was wrong. I decreased the dosage of B12 and folic acid.

Subsequently, another SpectraCell Lab test reported my B12 within range. However, I learned today tht a methylmalonic acid (MMA) test is more accurate than a serum B12 test.

&gt;The standard measurement of total serum B12 alone is inadequate for identifying patients with insufficient levels of metabolically active B12.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17474859

&gt;The measurement of B12 is a poor marker of B12 deficiency, whereas homocysteine is more sensitive [21]. This may partly explain the lack of correlation we found between CSF NFL and plasma vitamin B12. The inhibition of crucial enzymes, or the lack of adequate forms of B12/folate, may also explain disturbances in the homocysteine metabolism, even when there are sufficient levels of B12 and folate. The homocysteine lowering effect of B vitamin treatment supports the presence of functional B12 and/or folate deficiency in the HIV-negative population. The limited data available indicates that this is also the case in HIV-positive individuals [22].

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4956037/

http://www.naturalnews.com/027027_vitamin_B12_deficiency_B.html

Were my B12 serum tests misleading? Before applying methyl B12 mixed with DMSO on my skin, I will ask for a repeat methylmalonic acid test.

Last year, my homocysteine test was within range. Yet, I benefited from a methyl B12 injection. I think a methylmalonic acid test is more accurate than a homocysteine test for B12.

High quality supplement manufacturers will package supplements in glass bottles. I reuse the glass bottles and throw out plastic bottles. Though I transferred my B12 into a glass bottle, I packed plastic pill boxes with Perque B12. One box was inside my backpack. The other box was inside my car. The B12 tablets disintegrated inside the pill box quicker than the rest of the supplements I took. I swallowed the B12 powder. I changed brands to Protocol For Life Balance. This brand quickly disintegrated too. I changed brands to Douglas Lab. They haven't disintegrated. Douglas Lab's methyl B12 also contains methylfolate.

I told environmental medicine practitioner #2 I was more physically and mentally fatigued. He prescribed a methyl B12 injection. After wards, I asked what the dosage was. The dosage was only 2,000 mcg. I take more than 2,000 mcg subliminally. I asked the staff to bill my medical insurance. I was told vitamin injections are not covered. I paid $45 for the injection and was disappointed I had not asked for 5,000 mcg.

To my surprise, my physical and mental energy increased for an entire week. I had more clarity of mind. Why? If I were not absorbing the subliminal methyl B12, SpectraCell Lab would have reported a B12 deficiency. Why would injecting methyl B12 have such a significant improvement over subliminal methyl B12?

A partial answer is:

http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/01/02/dmso-and-vitamin-b12.aspx

Other reasons to take DMSO are DMSO is radioprotective, anti inflammatory, dissolves plaque in the brain and prevents cancer and treats cancer. See the DMSO wiki:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/574jbz/wiki_dmso_radioprotective_prevents_and_treats/

I went to a health food coop and then a large health food store. They don't sell DMSO. Health food stores used to.

Last week, I reported the effects of the B12 injection and asked environmental medicine practitioner #2 to prescribe methyl B12 injections. The staff obtains their B12 from a compound pharmacy.

La Vita Pharmacy 866-507-1990 or 858-453-2500. 3978 Sorrento Valley Blvd, Suite 300, San Diego, California 92121. Methyl B12 10 ml 1,000 mcg per ml. $30. Shelf life 4 months. $3 shipping.

I asked La Vita pharmacy whether they sell DMSO. They do but require a prescription. I don't want to make another appointment just to ask for a prescription for DMSO. I will purchase DMSO from Archie Scott, the lecturer at the Cancer Control Society's convention.

The rest of the answer is radiation and noise (""the hum"") decrease B12 and elevate homocysteine. Brain zapping causes leaky brain. B12 protects the blood brain barrier and the brain more than is acknowledged by medical professionals. See the methylation section of the cognitive impairments: treatments wiki:

The hackers deprive me of relaxation and pleasure. They disabled the speaker and headphone jack of my replacement Toshiba Portege R205 laptop. Since I ceased using a smartphone, I exclusively give my faxaway voicemail phone number out. Faxaway emails the voicemails an attachment. I could not listen to my voicemails.  The perps attempted to force me to use my smartphone. 

Nor could I listen to music or play a movie on my computer. I air gapped a replacement Toshiba Portege R100 laptop. The hackers disabled the headphone jack. I had to go to the library to use the library computer to listen to my voicemails.

Last month, I got some new music and copied it to my  MP3 player. The hackers stole my MP3 player. I purchased a replacement. I copied new music and old music from my computer  The music played OK on my computer but only a few songs would play on the MP3 player. I connected the MP3 player to my computer to delete the songs but the hackers made my  MP3 player read only.  I used the library computer to delete the songs. Windows could not delete the old duet folder. I opened the folder to discover infected music. 

Some music on my Toshiba R100 were emptied. The size of the files are zero bytes. Had the hackers deleted the songs, it would have been obvious. Emptying songs isn't obvious until I open the album folder to listen to them.

I downloaded the disassembly instructions for Toshiba R205. I remarked that I would disassemble my laptop to troubleshoot the speaker and headphone problem. The hackers enabled the speaker and headphone. I believe they had changed a chip on the motherboard. They control my computer when I do not connect to the internet and on battery power.  The question whether connecting the power adapter to a dirty electricity filter circumvents power line hacking is unanswerable as the hackers hack my computer on battery power.

Online photographs of the motherboard are not clear enough to identify the main chips. The bottom of the motherboard of the Toshiba R100 and R205 laptops had a large square chip had black vinyl on top of it. Removing the thick vinyl revealed copper underneath the vinyl.  Very strange. Is this OEM? Removing the copper did not circumvent the hacking.   

Examining the top of the motherboard would involve disassembling the touch pad which I didn't want to risk breaking.

If I destroy the chip to test whether it is the cause of the hacking, my laptop may be bricked. On the other hand, if I can identify the chip the hackers replace, perhaps they will stop replacing chips.

I purchased these two old computers to test whether their videocard chipset was preinstalled with an embedded FM radio transceiver, wi-fi or bluetooth or 2G.  I don't think they were. I believe the hackers interdicted my laptops to flash the BIOS and exchange a chip.

Edit:

An environmental medicine practitioner #1 prescribed B12 injections. I gave myself B12 injections. When I discovered B12 was available in sublingual form, I stopped the injections. 

A neurologist ordered a methylmalonic acid test. My level was high which indicated B12 deficiency. I increased the sublinguall dosage and started taking sublingual methylcobalamin B12.

Subsequently, a holistic doctor ordered a vitamin and mineral panel from SpectraCell Lab.  

https://www.spectracell.com/patients/patient-micronutrient-testing/

My B12 serum was within range. Despite my B12 serum test being within range, my environmental medicine practitioner #4 prescribed high dosages of sublingual methylcobalamin B12 manufactured by Perque and liquid folic acid for methylation. I didn't notice a difference.

A SpectraCell Lab vitamin and mineral panel reported my B12 was high. I erroneously assumed my environmental medicine practitioner #4 was wrong. I decreased the dosage of B12 and folic acid. 

Subsequently, another SpectraCell Lab test reported my B12 within range.  However, I learned today tht a methylmalonic acid (MMA) test is more accurate than a serum B12 test. 

&gt;The standard measurement of total serum B12 alone is inadequate for identifying patients with insufficient levels of metabolically active B12. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17474859

&gt;The measurement of B12 is a poor marker of B12 deficiency, whereas homocysteine is more sensitive [21]. This may partly explain the lack of correlation we found between CSF NFL and plasma vitamin B12. The inhibition of crucial enzymes, or the lack of adequate forms of B12/folate, may also explain disturbances in the homocysteine metabolism, even when there are sufficient levels of B12 and folate. The homocysteine lowering effect of B vitamin treatment supports the presence of functional B12 and/or folate deficiency in the HIV-negative population. The limited data available indicates that this is also the case in HIV-positive individuals [22].

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4956037/

http://www.naturalnews.com/027027_vitamin_B12_deficiency_B.html

Were my B12 serum tests misleading? Before applying methyl B12 mixed with DMSO on my skin, I will ask for a repeat methylmalonic acid test.

Last year, my homocysteine test was within range. Yet, I benefited from a methyl B12 injection. I think a methylmalonic acid test is more accurate than a homocysteine test for B12.

High quality supplement manufacturers will package supplements in glass bottles. I reuse the glass bottles and throw out plastic bottles. Though I transferred my B12 into a glass bottle, I packed plastic pill boxes with Perque B12. One box was inside my backpack. The other box was inside my car. The B12 tablets disintegrated inside the pill box quicker than the rest of the supplements I took. I swallowed the B12 powder. I changed brands to   Protocol For Life Balance.  This brand quickly disintegrated too. I changed brands to Douglas Lab. They haven't disintegrated. Douglas Lab's methyl B12 also contains methylfolate. 

I told environmental medicine practitioner #2 I was more physically and mentally fatigued. He prescribed a methyl B12 injection. After wards, I asked what the dosage was. The dosage was only 2,000 mcg. I take more than 2,000 mcg subliminally. I asked the staff to bill my medical insurance. I was told vitamin injections are not covered. I paid $45 for the injection and was disappointed I had not asked for 5,000 mcg.

To my surprise, my physical and mental energy increased for an entire week. I had more clarity of mind. Why? If I were not absorbing the subliminal methyl B12, SpectraCell Lab would have reported a B12 deficiency. Why would injecting methyl B12 have such a significant improvement over subliminal methyl B12?

A partial answer is:

http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/01/02/dmso-and-vitamin-b12.aspx

Other reasons to take DMSO are DMSO is radioprotective, anti inflammatory, dissolves plaque in the brain and prevents cancer and treats cancer. See the DMSO wiki:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/574jbz/wiki_dmso_radioprotective_prevents_and_treats/

I went to a health food coop and then a large health food store. They don't sell DMSO. Health food stores used to.

Last week, I reported the effects of the B12 injection and asked environmental medicine practitioner #2 to prescribe methyl B12 injections. The staff obtains their B12 from a compound pharmacy.

La Vita Pharmacy 866-507-1990 or 858-453-2500.
3978 Sorrento Valley Blvd,  Suite 300, San Diego, California 92121. Methyl B12 10 ml 1,000 mcg per ml. $30. Shelf life 4 months. $3 shipping. 

I asked La Vita pharmacy whether they sell DMSO. They do but require a prescription. I don't want to make another appointment just to ask for a prescription for DMSO. I will purchase DMSO from Archie Scott, the lecturer at the Cancer Control Society's convention.

The rest of the answer is radiation and noise (""the hum"") decrease B12 and elevate homocysteine. Brain zapping causes leaky brain. B12 protects the blood brain barrier and the brain more than is acknowledged by medical professionals. See the methylation section of the cognitive impairments: treatments wiki:

His selling pitch was testing attendees' mobile phones with a Chinese made radiofrequency meter with and without the sticker. I asked for the specifications of the RF meter. He didn't have the specs. The meter did not have the manufacturer's logo or website on it.

I don't talk or go on the internet with my phones. I turn on my unactivated smart phones to take photographs. The Motorola Droid 4 phones brain zap despite destroying the larger Qualcomm chip on the first phone and the LTE 4G chip on the second phone. The vendor's RF meter measured high RF emitted by both phones.  I will be destroying the LTE 4G chip on the first phone too.

I asked him what the sticker contained. He replied carbon and a magnet. The website stated ceramics.

which links to:

http://www.millennium-products.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SAR-Cell-Shield-Report.pdf

The report did not discuss immune levels. The report discussed Cell Shield reducing SAR by approximately 52%.

At the convention, I did not have time to read the website. $20 wasn't much to spend to test it out. However, I wanted to see other vendors' stickers and pendants to decide which to buy. 

Last year and this year, Elizabeth Plourde lectured and sold a SmartDot sticker.

I purchased a shungite sticker. Not because the vendor offered testing of attendants' phones or cited a report they conducted. They didn't. I purchased it because I have been wanting to test shungite and this rectangular stone with a sticker on the back is thin enough to tape to my body with medical tape. Since I posted on cancer biomarkers, lasering of my navel wakes me up at night. I will tape the shungite to my navel. 

I will test the shungite sticker on my unactivated smartphones too. I found an article on shungite stickers:

Japanese biostones are ceramic tourmaline balls to add directly to a glass of water. The Japanese do not add it to a water filter pitcher.

http://www.n-ion.com/e/product/bath-products/tb-1.html

Biostones sold to add to water filter pitchers contain the ceramic tourmaline balls and maifan stones. However, tourmaline, not maifan, emits negative ions and alkalizes the water.

https://www.consciouswater.ca/alkaline-water/alkaline-water-filter/

Tourmaline, as used in water ionizer filter, naturally transforms water into mild alkaline water, reduces water clustering (what happens to our stored water) and has anti-bacterial and deodorant qualities. Also treated water applied to the skin gives an excellent effect of moisturizing and absorption.

In addition, Tourmaline generates FIR that purifies the water and acts like a 'supercharger', assisting the water ionizer to ionize and alkalize.

Tourmaline has been researched and found to activate animal and plant metabolism.

The Tourmaline in a filter, has an immediate and powerful effect on the surfactant effect (makes water wetter) of tap water, producing an increase of about 100%. Tourmaline negatively ionizes water and thus supports extra negative ionization in IonLife water ionizers. (24,140/cc) / FIR (96%)

Enhances taste

Assists alkalization

Minimizes water odor

Also the far infrared (FIR) energy that Tourmaline naturally emits causes a resonance in the body at the same frequency as water.

The following is a Japanese method of decreasing EMF. They probably mean increasing negative ions which lowers positive ions emitted by computers and appliances. Research is needed to substantiate whether charcoal emits negative ions in a room or in bath water. Feel free to experiment with a meter and submit your findings.  Binchotan is white charcoal from oak trees.

&gt; “All odors are positively charged gases that float in the air like dust particles. The ZeOdor Volcanic Crystals have a negative charge that traps positively charged odor particles. The process is similar to a piece of metal being attracted to a magnet.

&gt;After 3 months place the pouch in the sunlight for 6 hours, this procedure recharges ZeOdor making it a wonderful odor-controlling tool that can be used over and over.

&gt;The 2 lb. pouches are effective in a room up to 500 square feet and the 4 oz. pouches are effective in rooms of up to 100 square feet.”

ZeOdor Eliminates Odor Moisture / Fundraiser

Findings

&gt;""A computer room will have roughly six times as many positive ions as negative ones at the end of the day even if the room was aired in the morning, unless it is aired frequently during the day.

&gt;Binchotan and bamboo charcoals not only dissipate 'hazardous' electromagnetic waves from computer monitors but also generate negative ions. More accurately, the infrared rays emitted constantly from charcoals reduce moisture in the air into fine particles that naturally change into negative ions. This means that a certain amount of moisture must be present in the computer room if charcoal is used to increase the room's negative ion ratio. The ideal degree of humidity in computer rooms is between 45 and 55%. In winter, when houses are heated, the computer room tends to be too dry. Of course, we can install a humidifier capable of controlling the degree of humidity in the air, but a few wet towels may be sufficient.

&gt;In order to keep a room 10 ft x 10 ft (3.2 m x 3.2 m) in an ideal ionic state, we need 9 lbs. (4 kg) of binchotan or 7 lbs. (3 kg) of bamboo charcoal [about $80 US]. According to our charcoal prices, it costs the same whether we use binchotan charcoal or bamboo charcoal.

&gt;An important difference between binchotan charcoal and bamboo charcoal is that the latter tends to break easily as it is a lot more fragile.

&gt;One important thing, however, is that once charcoal is placed in a room, it keeps working forever.""

Testing for biomarkers enables patients to treat the biomarkers instead of getting cancer. The biomarkers interferon-gamma, neopterin and kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio (KTR) are treatable. Vitamin B6 deficiency elevates interferon-gamma.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22757621

Vitamin B6 is a cofactor of the antioxidant glutathione.  B6 becomes depleted by oxidative stress induced by toxic chemicals, heavy metals and electromagnetic fields. Vitamin B6 also becomes depleted by kryptopyrrole which binds to it.

New papers on laetrile inhibiting cancer is in a comment below.

Two vendors sold raw bitter apricot kernels. Bitter apricots are wild food. Sweet apricots are hybridized so do not contain laetrile. I purchased a bag from http://apricotpower.

Apricot kernels look like almonds but are harder. To soften them, I soak the kernels over night. Soaking instigates germination which elevates enzymes and phytochemicals.

I eat five soaked kernels every day to help prevent getting cancer. The kernels leave a bitter taste in the mouth. I wash away the bitter taste with kombucha tea made with white tea.

Paleo foods containing laetrile:  Scroll down the page at http://vitaminb17.org and click on 'Foods Containing B17 (Nitrilosides).'

Fava sprouts med. Fava beans contain the neurotransmitter dopamine. Fava bean (mucana) is an Ayurveda medicine.

Alfalfa sprouts are medium. Mix alfalfa sprouts with broccoli sprouts. The latter is high in NRF2 activator.

Does heat destroy laetrile?

No, cooking doesn't destroy the Vitamin B17. Almost every food that we eat is better eaten raw. And when we cook a fruit we destroy the enzymes and wherever we have Vitamin B17 we have the accompanying enzyme B-glucosidase naturally. B-glucosidase is destroyed by heat, but Vitamin B17 is not destroyed by heat. Is there any way in which a person may be deficient in the enzyme rhodanese? The enzyme rhodanese is a normally occurring enzyme that converts cyanide to the non-toxic compound neocyanate and we evolved with the Rhodes because the Vitamin B17 containing cyanide originally was so large a part of our diet. So far as we know there is no development of rhodanese deficiencies.

For those that don't want to eat foods containing laetrile, laetrile does penetrate the skin. Cold pressed apricot kernel oil is not available. Apricot Kernel Skin Care Oil 4 oz by Aura Cacia and apricot Kernel Oil by NOW do not specify cold pressed so it can be assumed the oil was heated during extraction process. If it is not rancid, applying apricot kernel oil on the skin may be a method.

Apricot kernel oil Prunus Armeniaca. An extremely desirable moisturizer rich in vitamins A and E, apricot kernel oil is extracted from the inedible kernels found in the apricot pit. The oil helps skin retain elasticity and suppleness without feeling greasy. It is especially effective when used on dry or mature skin.

Second most important NRF2 activator is broccoli sprouts. See comment below on effectiveness of broccoli as a NRF2 activator.  I will be posting my notes on a lecture on broccoli sprouts at the cancer convention. Broccoli sprouts do not taste good. Juicing them along with beets and carrots will mask their taste.

&gt;A recent evaluation of the chemopreventive effect of various phytochemicals
(chlorophyllin, blueberry, ellagic acid, astaxanthin, and tea polyphenols in order of effectiveness) demonstrated that not only did they upregulate Nrf2 and ARE-target enzymes (GST, NQO1, SOD, catalase, GPx), but also various DNA repair enzymes (OGG1, XPD, XPG, XRCC1) and downregulated specific isoforms of CYP450 responsible for the activation of DMBA [101].

&gt;Carnosic acid, a compound found in herbs, such as rosemary and sage, can cross the blood-brain barrier to support neuronal growth, and upregulates the production of neural protection factors in an Nrf2-dependent manner [106,107].

See citation in comment below.  Ellagic acid is in raspberries and is anticancer.

I will bring NRF2 activators into my diet. I already eat lots of berries. I will buy broccoli sprouts, fresh rosemary and astaxanthin, increase intake of herbs, retest and write a report for my doctors.

I consolidated this post with a post from two months ago:

I scanned this two page article by Lucinda Grant from an out of print self published book 'Remedies for Electromagnetic Pollution' by 'Betsy' Elizabeth Russell-Manning. This may have been the first book written in the United States on EHS, shielding and mitigation. I purchased the book from the author.

Lucinda Grant discussed Russian research finding microwaves deplete cholinesterase thereby elevating the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. elevated acetylcholine can induce depression and anxiety.

Yet, this year's study found microwaves elevate acetylcholinestrase which inhibit acetylcholine. Which is correct?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4tmhnr/j_alzheimers_neurotransmitters_acetylcholine/

Lucinda Grant is director of the national support group Electrical Sensitivity Network and author of the books The Electrical Sensitivity Handbook and Workstation Radiation. In 1997, she also wrote 'Electrical Sensitivity as an Emerging Illness'

Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients published the article. Townsend is an excellent progressive magazine on alternative therapies written for patients to comprehend and follow the treatments if practitioners are not nearby but with sufficient details to be highly useful for health practitioners. My posts on probiotics producing glutathione, N-acetylcysteine reducing cytokines and memon were based on information in Townsend.

http://imgur.com/a/hQNRf

In May 2016, one of my neurologists ordered a hearing test. I had a hearing test on May 18, 2016. The audiologist did not go over the test results other than to tell me I have more hearing loss in my left ear than my right ear. 

The office staff refused to email or fax the test results. Took over a month to receive it in the mail. The hearing test is the only test I had that was basically all abbreviations. I informed the staff that doctors of various specialities of medicine would not know what the abbreviations meant. Office staff lied that all doctors in all specialities know what the abbreviations mean. I asked the office staff to write the meaning of the abbreviations on the test report. Office staff refused. I asked office staff to email me the meaning of the abbreviations. Office staff breached promise. I asked for a follow up appointment so I could obtain the meaning of the abbreviations. Office staff refused to make the appointment based on medical insurance companies would not pay for two appointments in the same year unless the second appointment was ordered by an otolaryngologist (nose, ears and throat doctor). 

I made an appointment with an otolaryngologist. He didn't know what WRS and THI meant. Ironically, he orders hearing tests and has an audiologist in his office. He should know how to interpret audiograms. 

I searched on the internet. I typed up the meaning of the abbreviations to attach to my hearing test to give to my other doctors.

SNHL is sensorineural hearing loss.

AD is right ear.

AS is left ear.

AU is both ears.

WRS is word recognition score. 

THI is tinnitus handicap inventory.

I rewrote the test results substituting the abbreviations for the meaning of the abbreviations:

Mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in right ear.
Moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss in left ear.
Word recognition score were 80% both ears.
HL; AS &gt; AD means hearing loss in left ear greater than right ear.
Tinnitis handicap inventory is moderate grade 3.

The audiologist's written report was incomplete. The audiologist did not specify in writing whether the hearing loss is high frequency or low frequency. Unfortunately, this is depicted in the graphs but not in words. 

Nor did the otolaryngologist inform me despite my asking him to interpret the audiogram. The oth just pressured me to make an appointment for a hearing aid. My medical insurance does not cover hearing aids. I will find a better otolaryngologist.

Fortunately, I found an article 'How Do I Understand My Hearing Loss From My Audiogram?'

https://www.audicus.com/how-to-read-an-audiogram/

My left ear has ""profound"" high frequency hearing loss as the final X is at 90 decibels at 8,000 hertz. Ultrasound is high frequency which makes sense that it would cause high frequency hearing loss.

My right ear has ""moderately-severe"" high frequency loss as the final 0 at 60 decibels at 8,000 hertz. http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hearing/hearing_testing/understanding_audiogram.html

&gt;As the number gets bigger, so does your hearing loss. Example: Reading the above audiogram from left to right, the final O (right ear) hits about 68 db or so.  This means that anything below 68 db. (Whispered conversations, leaves rustling, birds chirping) will not be heard.  

https://www.audicus.com/how-to-read-an-audiogram/

&gt;Sensorineural deafness is a type of hearing loss. It occurs from damage to the inner ear, the nerve that runs from the ear to the brain (auditory nerve), or the brain........Other symptoms include ..... ringing or buzzing sound in the ears (tinnitus). 

https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003291.htm

The humming and buzzing are external though by now they might be both external and internal. Sources of external humming are my unactivated smartphones. Holding them to my ear, I can hear humming and its remarkably strong vibration actually vibrates my ear drum. See ultrasonic spyware in /r/badbios' ultrasound weapons wiki. Smart meters have caused people to hear humming. I believe spy satellites torture their targets via humming. 

My hearing loss was not gradual. It was rapid. It took time finding a neurologist to order a hearing test. That neurologist referred an audiologist in the same medical center which was a full day round trip for me. I could not find an audiologist closer to where I reside because I didn't know the term ""audiologist"" to search for. I searched for ""hearing test"" which didn't bring up audiologists. I went to another neurologist who ordered a hearing test and referred an audiologist closer by.

The ancient greeks swirled copper vessel to ionize water (produce negative ions).

Reverse osmosis is acidic and positively charged.

Tap water is typically neutral at 7.0. My tap water is slightly acidic at 6.0. 

There are several methods to alkalize water.

**(1) Making coral water**

At the cancer convention, I purchased coral sachets from the vendor Coral LCC called Alkalizing Water Treatment. 

https://coralcalcium.com/coral-llc-products/water-treatment-product/coral-alkaline-water-sachets/

Soak sachet in one quart of water in a glass jar. I use wide mouth canning jars.

I picked up a free sample of Coal EcoPure powder which is ground up coral to mix with water and drink.  Alkalizes the water and provides trace minerals.

https://coralcalcium.com/coral-llc-products/powder-products/

Alternatively, I have placed coral I picked up while earthing barefoot in the waves into glass jars of water. The water tastes alkaline. Over the time, the coral dissolves a small percentage of itself into the water. Since there is no sachet over the coral, the water needs to be finely screened to block the particles. StarWest sells cotton draw string tea bags. Three sizes. Alternatively, use a large stainless steel tea ball. Place coral inside the cotton tea bags.

I tested a sachet in a quart canning jar. My tap water is 6.0. The coral sachet increased the alkalinity by .5 to 6.5. I used EnzymaMedica PH strips. 

**(2) Alkalizing water filter**

At the convention, a vendor lectured on alkaline water and sold alkalizing water filters that he designed.  I asked Peter how his water filter removes fluoride as water filters contain a carbon filter and carbon filters do not remove fluoride. Peter simply answered alka without explaining alka. His website explains a little more. The water filter has three filters: carbon, alkalizing stone filter containing various small rocks and an  exchange mineral filter.  Scroll down the webpage to replacement filters at:

http://waterworks4u.com/product.php?cat=3

The packaging has more information than the website. I had not written down the ingredients from the packaging. From memory shungite, coral, carbon, tourmaline.

Replacement Biostone Filter for the Ionic Oasis -- Biostone

&gt;This filter provides 1 micron particulate filtration, carbon filtration and tourmaline which provides negative ions and a
mild ionization to the water before it runs over the electrodes.

http://waterworks4u.com/ionic-oasis.html

The water stick may have the same biostones as the water filter though the water filter also has shungite. At a prior cancer convention, I purchased both the water filter and the water stick. The water stick contains:

&gt; Water-Soluble Calcium Carbonate Ore (calcium content: 95.75%)
 Produced in the Futamata Hot Spring, Hokkaido, Japan. Absorption and decomposition of toxic substances. 
    
  *Specifically Manufactured Tourmaline Ceramics from Brazil*
 Generates electrolysis, producing negative ions and far infrared rays. It provides antibacterial properties, increases dissolved oxygen and ionizes water molecules by decreasing their size (micro-clustering). 
    
  *Coral Fossil (Weathered Coral)*
 Mined in Hokkaido, Japan from a 20 million-year-old seabed layer which has been uplifted to ground level. It emits 25% of the mineral contents in water, making it milder. 
    
  *Binchotan Charcoal*
 With the same absorbtion abilities as activated charcoal, it absorbs chlorine, heavy metals and impurities, emits Far Infrared Rays while making the water cleaner, safer and better tasting. 
    
  *Maifanshi Stone*
 It releases mineral contents and activates water to decompose impurities. It was approved in Japan as a food additive in 1976. Superior sterilization effects. 
    
  *Dechlorinating Ceramics*
 It quickly decomposes and removes chlorine and other unpleasant odors of chlorinated water 

http://waterworks4u.com/portable-ti-stick.html

I tested my used old water stick with an EnzymaMedica PH strips. The water stick did not raise the alkalinity. The water stick did when it was new.  The water stick has a stainless steel casing perforated with holes. There is a cap on the ends. Using an utility knife poking under the cap in several places, a cap can be loosened. When the water stick no longer alkalizes water, open the cap and replace the biostones with new biostones or small tourmalines. 
Testing with a PH strip, tourmaline did not alter alkalinity. Tourmaline has different benefits. See posts on tourmaline in the vibrational medicine: crystals wiki.

For people on a budget, buy grounded up tourmaline or small pieces of tourmaline. Pack into a cotton draw string tea bag with coral. Place into a wide mouth canning jar. Also place shungite into jar. Shake. See the instructions for the water stick.

**ORP (Oxidation-reduction potential)**

&gt;When talking about water, its pH value is related directly to the ratio of positively charged hydrogen ions [H+] and negatively charged hydroxyl ions [OH-]....... Oxidation-reduction potential, or ORP, is a measurement that indicates the degree to which a substance is capable of oxidizing or reducing another substance.   ORP is measured in millivolts (mv) using an ORP meter..... A negative ORP reading indicates that a substance is a reducing agent.  The lower the reading, the more anti-oxidizing it is.  As such, a substance with an ORP reading of -400 mv is 4 times more anti-oxidizing than a substance with an ORP reading of -100 mv. Most types of water, including tap water and bottled water, are oxidizing agents as their ORP value is positive. Alkaline ionized water is an anti-oxidizing agent, as it has a negative ORP value and it is able to donate extra electrons to neutralize the harmful effects of free radicals on the body.

Agent orange was aerially sprayed in Vietnam, US Forest land and commercial timberland. Chlordane also was contaminated with dioxin. EPA delayed banning the sale of chlordane in the USA until a substitute, Dursban, was approved. Since the EPA merely banned the sale in the USA of DDT, chlordane and other organochlorinated insectides, they were stock piled and used after the ban. DDT is lawfully manufactured in Texas and lawfully sold to foreign countries. Half life of dioxin and organochlorinated insecticides is 40 years? 

Dursban was used as a termiticide, flea dip, lice hair dip, garden spray, etc. The active ingredient in dursban and a cholinesterase test could detect organophosphate insecticide poisoning. PON1 test can detect deficiency of liver enzyme to detoxify organophosphate insecticides. 

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6690/full/394284a0.html

A PON1 deficiency is a biomarker of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS).

Half life of Dursban is approximately 15 years. EPA banned the sale of Dursban in the USA approximately 2000. Stores advertised stock piling dursban as use of dursban after the ban is legal.

Organochlorinated pesticides are endocrine disrupters. EU is considering several endocrine disrupters:

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/03/150305-chemicals-endocrine-disruptors-diabetes-toxic-environment-ngfood/

Majority of people with MCS reported that they became chemically sensitive due to insecticide exposure. Fortunately, the youngest generation is not exposed to contaminated housing as the banned pesticides possibly have finally off gassed. Fewer people now develop MCS. Aerial spraying of Naled may reverse this trend.

Will more people develop PON1 deficiency due to the organophosphate insecticide Naled being aerially sprayed as mosquito abatement? Once PON1 deficiency is acquired, will their children inherit PON1 deficiency? they will be kept ignorant. Commercial labs don't offer PON1 testing. Only the Genetics Department of the University of Washington in Seattle, WA offers PON1 testing to civilians. 


Naled is one of a class of insecticides referred to as organophosphates. These chemicals act by interfering with the activities of cholinesterase, an enzyme that is essential for the proper working of the nervous systems of both humans and insects.

Naled is one of a class of insecticides referred to as organophosphates. These chemicals act by interfering with the activities of cholinesterase, an enzyme that is essential for the proper working of the nervous systems of both humans and insects.

Organophosphates and electromagnetic fields interfere with acetylcholinesterase. Doubly whammy. People are kept ignorant as only one lab offers the correct acetylcholineterase test -- Mayo Lab. 

Acetylcholinesterase can cause Alzheimer's disease.

https://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/35qr22/finally_an_open_source_pda_pocketchip_has_a/?

I funded, waited and waited. Three days ago, PocketC.H.I.P. was delivered! Much more full featured and advanced than the raspberry pi yet only $50. Equipped with a clear molded shell case on the back. 

The PDA could be easily air gapped by removing the case and destroying the wifi/bluetooth chip. Since there is neither a preinstalled browser nor a synaptic package manager, I would not be using the wifi. If there were a browser, I would use the wifi only while traveling. I mitigate wifi exposure by using an ethernet cable.

The PocketC.H.I.P has a preinstalled terminal. PocketCHIP Browser Installer Script 

https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/pocketchip-browser-installer-script/4832

The plastic film on the 4.3"" screen is not an useable screen protector. I removed it and immediately covered the screen with a Motorola Droid 3 screen protector. Same height but Droid 3 screen protector is longer. I cut the screen protector with a scissors to 4 inches long. I packed some screen protectors in my car to cut with a cutting board at FedEx.

Write, the plain text editor, has a tiny menu on the top.  I took out a thin tip stylus I had purchased two years ago for a tablet:

https://www.amazon.com/Precision-Universal-Capacitive-Replaceable-Detachable/dp/B0092KRAXO/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471900153&amp;sr=8-14&amp;keywords=thin+tip+stylus

The thin tip was not narrow enough for a 7"" inch tablet and would not be narrow enough for the PDA. The finest point stylus is needed.

The PocketC.H.I.P could be an ebook reader if it had a preinstalled PDF viewer app or epub viewer app. Ebooks formats could be converted to PDF.

The PocketC.H.I.P. has a headphone jack but no preinstalled music player app. My backpack has a MP3 pocket larger enough to fit the PocketC.H.I.P with a hole for the headphone cord. I have been listening to music with a Sansa Clip Plus MP3 player but it has a FM transceiver chip which neither can be disabled in the software nor destroyed. FM emits a tracking beacon. I want to stop being geolocated by listening to music. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/24vh22/geolocated_tracked_eavesdropped_on_by_fm_radio/?

Two years ago, the only MP3 player I could find that did not have FM was a cheap Chinese MP3 player that had a weak battery and who's software did not feature playing whole albums. Just individual songs. PocketC.H.I.P. does not have FM. I hope more apps will be written for it.

PocketC.H.i.P. has a hole punched in two corners for a pencil or pen to go through to make a stand. I attached a key ring to the hole and the lanier which came with the stylus. 

The keys are uniquely situated. It would take time to get adjust to the keyboard. The keyboard renders the PDA more for reading and editing files than typing for hours.

The brightness control offers excellent light outdoors. Since I refrained from using smartphones, I had to copy and paste driving directions, address book, shopping list, etc. into plain text files, save them for future times, print them and keep them in my car. Though I keep a laptop in my car, the brightness control of laptops is inadequate outdoors in the sun. This is true for all my laptops.  To read files on my laptop, I had to drive to go inside a cafe. I researched locations of cafes in cities that I travel to, copied them into plain text files, printed the files out and kept the files in file folders in a briefcase in my car. Laptops were not designed to be used outdoors. PocketC.H.I.P. was.

A seven inch tablet sleeve is too large but would do.  8 3/4"" L x 6 3/4"" H.  I used a small men's toiletry bag which is smaller than a sleeve. 6 1/2"" H x 8' L. The PocketC.H.I.lP is 6 1/2' H x 4 1/2' L.  The toiletry bag fits the stylus, short micro USB cable. charger and a 15 foot micro USB cable to be able to use the PDA while charging at a cafe. I charged the PDA and stored it in the toiletry bag.

Today, I was planning on copying my plain text files to the PDA. I took the toiletry bag out to place it next to my laptop. Two hours later, the bag went missing. PocketC.H.I.P. was the only item stolen.

Yet, three days ago, Friday, August 19, 2016, my microSD card was stolen from my gym bag in my car. The perps have stolen so many flashdrives and SD cards, that one reason why I switched to microSD cards is that they fit inside a microSD card holder the size of a credit card which fits inside a money belt. 

https://www.amazon.com/DiMeCard-micro8-microSD-Memory-writable/dp/B005SPQ8XK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471911721&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=microSD+card+holder

Yes, I have had to resort to wearing a money belt to keep my data and firmware safe. Before showering at the gym, I removed the microSD card to put it inside my gym bag inside a locked locker. Unfortunately, after showering I had forgotten to put it back into my money belt. Locker rooms don't have windows but radar sees through walls.

I will purchase a replacement at https://getchip.com/pages/store, a finest narrowest point stylus and a case.

Highlights

◾•First in vivo electrophysiological recordings with neural dust motes
◾•Passive, wireless, and battery-less EMG and ENG recording with mm-scale devices
◾•Recorded signals transmitted via ultrasonic backscatter from implanted neural dust motes
◾•Ultrasound as a scalable means of providing wireless power and communication


Summary

The emerging field of bioelectronic medicine seeks methods for deciphering and modulating electrophysiological activity in the body to attain therapeutic effects at target organs. Current approaches to interfacing with peripheral nerves and muscles rely heavily on wires, creating problems for chronic use, while emerging wireless approaches lack the size scalability necessary to interrogate small-diameter nerves. Furthermore, conventional electrode-based technologies lack the capability to record from nerves with high spatial resolution or to record independently from many discrete sites within a nerve bundle. Here, we demonstrate neural dust, a wireless and scalable ultrasonic backscatter system for powering and communicating with implanted bioelectronics. We show that ultrasound is effective at delivering power to mm-scale devices in tissue; likewise, passive, battery-less communication using backscatter enables high-fidelity transmission of electromyogram (EMG) and electroneurogram (ENG) signals from anesthetized rats. These results highlight the potential for an ultrasound-based neural interface system for advancing future bioelectronics-based therapies.

Introduction


Figure1Recent technological advances (Boretius et al., 2010, Delivopoulos et al., 2012) and fundamental discoveries (Bhadra and Kilgore, 2005, Pavlov and Tracey, 2012, Rosas-Ballina et al., 2011) have renewed interest in implantable systems for interfacing with the peripheral nervous system. Early clinical successes with peripheral neurostimulation devices, such as those used to treat sleep apnea (Strollo et al., 2014) or control bladder function in paraplegics (Creasey et al., 2001) have led clinicians and researchers to propose new disease targets ranging from diabetes to rheumatoid arthritis (Famm et al., 2013). A recently proposed roadmap for the field of bioelectronic medicines highlights the need for new electrode-based recording technologies that can detect abnormalities in physiological signals and be used to update stimulation parameters in real time. Key features of such technologies include high-density, stable recordings of up to 100 channels in single nerves, wireless and implantable modules to enable characterization of functionally specific neural and electromyographic signals, and scalable device platforms that can interface with small nerves of 100 μm diameter or less (Birmingham et al., 2014) as well as specific muscle fibers. Current approaches to recording peripheral nerve activity fall short of this goal; for example, cuff electrodes provide stable chronic performance but are limited to recording compound activity from the entire nerve. Single-lead intrafascicular electrodes can record from multiple sites within a single fascicle but do not enable high-density recording from discrete sites in multiple fascicles (Lefurge et al., 1991). Similarly, surface EMG arraysFigure2 allow for very-high-density recording (Lapatki et al., 2004, Martinez-Valdes et al., 2016) but do not capture fine details of deep or small muscles. Recently, wireless devices to enable untethered recording in rodents (Lee et al., 2013, Szuts et al., 2011) and nonhuman primates (Foster et al., 2014, Schwarz et al., 2014, Yin et al., 2014), as well as mm-scale integrated circuits for neurosensing applications have been developed (Biederman et al., 2015, Denison et al., 2007, Muller et al., 2015). However, most wireless systems use electromagnetic (EM) energy coupling and communication, which becomes extremely inefficient in systems smaller than ∼5 mm due to the inefficiency of coupling radio waves at these scales within tissue (Rabaey et al., 2011, Seo et al., 2013; see also Size Scaling and Electromagnetics in the Supplemental Information). Further miniaturization of wireless electronics platforms that can effectively interface with small-diameter nerves will require new approaches.

Figure4In contrast to EM, ultrasound offers an attractive alternative for wirelessly powering and communicating with sub-mm implantable devices (Charthad et al., 2015, Larson and Towe, 2011, Meng and Sahin, 2013, Ozeri and Shmilovitz, 2010, Seo et al., 2014). Ultrasound has two advantages. First, the speed of sound is 105 × lower than the speed of light in water, leading to much smaller wavelengths at similar frequencies; this yields excellent spatial resolution at these lower frequencies as compared to radio waves. Second, ultrasonic energy attenuates far less in tissue than EM radiation; this not only results in much higher penetration depths for a given power, but also significantly decreases the amount of unwanted power introduced into tissue due to scattering or absorption. In fact, for most frequencies and power levels, ultrasound is safe in the human body. These limits are well defined, and ultrasound technologies have long been used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. As a rough guide, about 72× more power is allowable into the human body when using ultrasound as compared to radio waves (Food and Drug Administration, 2008, International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety, 2006).Figure3

We previously introduced the neural dust ultrasonic backscattering concept to harness the potential advantages of ultrasound and showed that, theoretically, such a system could be scaled well below the mm-scale when used for wireless electrophysiological neural recording (Seo et al., 2013, Seo et al., 2014). Here, we present the first experimental validation of a neural dust system in vivo in the rat peripheral nervous system (PNS) and skeletal muscle, reporting both electroneurogram (ENG) recordings from the sciatic nerve and electromyographic (EMG) recordings from the gastrocnemius muscle. The neural dust system consists of an external ultrasonic transceiver board which powers and communicates with a millimeter-scale sensor implanted into either a nerve or muscle (Figure 1A). The implanted mote consists of a piezoelectric crystal, a single custom transistor, and a pair of recording electrodes (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1).


During operation, the external transducer alternates between (1) emitting a series of six 540-ns pulses every 100 μs and (2) listening for any reflected pulses. The entire sequence of transmit, receive, and reconstruction events are detailed…

The main biomarker of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is low glutathione. Glutathione is required to detoxify heavy metals, chemicals and EMF. Low glutathione renders people vulnerable to toxins. They become at risk of sustaining chemical injuries, injuring their liver and permanently becoming chemically sensitive. Glutathione is depleted in people with RWS, EHS, HPU, ADHD, ALS, alzheimer's, autism, MCS and parkinson's.

See the glutathione wiki.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3vy50f/wiki_glutathione_biomarker_glutathione_protects/

There have been posts on significant percentage of people with MCS have EHS and vice versa and acetylcholinesterase playing a factor. Acetylcholinesterase and permanently low glutathione are a double whammy!

I encourage people with EHS or radio wave sickness (RWS) to get a glutathione test. If deficient, increase glutathione and its cofactors. If you have not mitigated EMF even if you are not deficient, it would be wise to increase glutathione.

&gt;Jodie Donnelly says

&gt;September 11, 2015 at 10:38 pm

&gt;I worked in a Water Damaged Building (WDB) which led to mould hyphae and fungus spore inhalation. Upon realisation it was the building causing my horrid symptoms, I left. Symptoms such as chronic coughing, etc. dissipated almost immediately. However, I was left with hypersensitivities, in particular to EMF/Low ironising radiation, electrical hypersensitivity (EHS) of which I had no doubt had been induced by the mould/fungus inhalation. Firsthand experience followed by common sense told me there was a link. This was met with ignorance and denial. Over time I found many others who’s EHS began following mould/fungus spore exposure. While attempting to recover I moved into a brand new building that made us and most of the new arriving tenants sick with radiation type symptoms. Just after we all moved in earlier this year, many apartments in the building quickly went putrid with mould and fungus spores following wet weather and storms. Radiation type symptoms as well as mould and fungus spore proliferation got worse as each new tenant moved in. After several months and going through a long list, process of elimination of what could be causing this, it was realised that the block was littered with dozens of smart meters. Each new tenant moving in meant another one of these very dangerous devices was fired up. This explained why each new arrival caused symptoms to flare and further proliferation so quickly of mould and fungus. Experience and logic led me to find research confirming the unhealthy alliance of these two dangerous things. Those making squillions on these death devices don’t care about the babies, children, adults and families health this is ruining. But perhaps when property owners and investors, home owners, landlords, etc. get wind of the fact that their properties are rancid with mould, leading to either very expensive and/or irreversible damage, tenants, etc. moving out. All that will eventually be followed by many lawsuits being thrown at them.

Meanwhile, brain zapping is worse. I had ceased using smartphones due to their SAR being remotely manipulated to a high level. Since smartphones no longer were zapping my brain, the perpetrators brain zapped me more via satellite during the day. They have already been brain zapping me via satellite while I slept.

The perpetrators not only work for big pharma censoring alternative cancer treatments, they work for industry too. Industries that manufacture toxic carcinogenic products.

I will bring papers on acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase to my doctor. I will request an acetylcholineterase test. I would like to also request an acetylcholine test but it appears medical insurance companies do not pay for it. 

In the past year, I have seen three neurologists. None offered to order an acetylcholine test or a acetylcholinesterase test. Why? All three neurologists offered to order a MRI which I declined.  My neurologists ordered a standard MRI. The papers in /r/electromagnetics are on findings using a functional MRI (fMRI) test. My neurologists have never ordered a fMRI. The imaging centers they refer do not offer fMRI. I asked one of the imaging centers who does offer a fMRI. I was referred to the local university medical school.

Why do they have a  preference for imaging over a serum test? Do they have knowledge of the acetylcholinesterase test? Only Mayo Lab offers the test. Do they have knowledge of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine tests? Few allopathic physicians order neurotransmitter tests. Holistic doctors, environmental medicine doctors and naturopaths order neurotransmitter tests. I suspect big pharma brain washes allopathic doctors to forego neurotransmitter testing and blindly prescribe antipsychotic drugs and alzheimer's drugs.

A neurotransmitter test would detect whether I am deficient in acetylcholine. If I am, I would take choline. An acetylcholinesterase test would detect whether I am high in acetylcholinesterase. If I am, I would take hemp seeds.

To summarize my brain lab tests so far:

Yet, this year's study found microwaves elevate acetylcholinestrase which inhibit acetylcholine. Which is correct?

Subjects: One hundred clinically healthy volunteers (75 females, 25 males, age 40-65 years) were recruited into a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study. For various reasons, 25 people in the control group and 2 in the treated group dropped out. Hence, the results are based on 48 treated subjects and 25 controls. 

Study Design: This study utilized kefir with ME-3 added as the test agent and kefir without any probiotic as the control agent. Both kefir solutions were identical nutrient composition, color, taste, and caloric value. Volunteers all consumed an identical standard meal. Testing: After a 2-week introductory period, baseline blood and urine samples were obtained 2.5 hours after ingestion of the standard meal. Then volunteers also ingested 200 ml of kefir with ME-3 or control kefir daily for two weeks and were then re-tested. 

Results: Volunteers ingesting kefir containing ME-3 exhibited the following: 

a) -16% in oxidized LDL-cholesterol (reduces cardiovascular disease risks) b) -20% in 8-isoprostanes (reduction in free radical damage) 

c) 10% increase in HDL-cholesterol (not shown on graph) 

d) 18% increase in paraoxonase enzyme activity (PON1) which regulates detoxification of pesticides and provides antioxidant activity (not on graph) e) 10% decline in triglycerides (not shown on graph) - 

The Genetics Department of the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington is the only way to be tested for PON1. Contact Clement Furlong.

I can't take enough sublingual glutathione and liquid glutathione. EMF and toxic chemicals deplete glutathione.

I previously posted on difficulty in finding probiotics that colonize and can resist electromagnetic fields. The hardiest I found was a probiotics mixture by Garden of Life. They did not culture well in raw milk as some of the probiotics were soil based organisms. After finishing the bottle, EMF killed them in my gut.

Lactobaccilus fermentum ME-3 has been found to colonize and resist oxidative stress. EMF and toxic chemicals induce oxidative stress. It also can be cultured in raw milk to make kefir. One bottle will last a long time if refrigerated and a starter culture is used to make kefir and replenished in the refrigerator. I will test it.

'Antioxidative probiotic fermented goats’ milk decreases oxidative stress-mediated atherogenicity in human subjects' 

Journal: British Journal of Nutrition. 2003; Vol. 90; pp.449-456. 

Authors: Tiiu Kullisaar, Epp Songisepp, Marika Mikelsaar, Kersti Zilmer, Tiiu Vihalemm, and Mihkel Zilmer 

Subjects: 

Twenty-one healthy subjects (aged 35-65) divided into 2 groups. Study Design: during the 3-week study, 16 participants consumed 150 grams of goats’ milk fermented with Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3 (test group) while 5 participants ingested 150 g fresh goats’ milk without probiotics (control group). 

Testing: 

Blood and urine samples were initially tested and then again at the end of the 3-week trial. Blood was analyzed for total antioxidant activity (TAA), total antioxidant status (TAS), ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione, oxidized LDL-cholesterol and 8- isoprostanes (measure of free radical damage to unsaturated fatty acids). Also, fecal samples were collected at the beginning (day 0) and again at the end of the trial (day 21). 

Results: 
 Survivability &amp; Gastrointestinal Persistence: Initial testing reported that Lactobacillus fermentum was present in the intestinal tract of only 4 of the 16 test subjects. At the end of the trial, fecal samples revealed that the GI tract of all 16 test subjects were colonized with ME-3. Furthermore, testing also revealed that ingesting goats’ milk fermented with Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3 resulted in a doubling of live ME-3 bacteria in the intestinal tract. 

 These results provide two important pieces of data: 

 a) When taken orally, ME-3 survives transit through stomach, which means it does not get killed when exposed to strong stomach acids. 

 b) When orally ingested ME-3 arrives in the intestinal tract, the bacteria are able to adhere to the mucosal lining and grow/multiply as evidenced by doubling the concentration of live ME-3 bacteria after 21 days. Reduction of Cardiovascular Risks: Free radical damage to lipoproteins (oxidized LDL-cholesterol) can ultimately damage cells that line the arteries, resulting in plaque build-up and atherosclerosis, which is one of the primary causes of cardiovascular disease. ME-3’s antioxidant activity resulted in a substantial decrease in oxidized LDL- cholesterol. 

Increased Antioxidant Protection: 

a) The ME-3 test subjects exhibited a substantial reduction in urinary levels of 8- isoprostanes (8-EPI) which is recognized as one of the most reliable ways of measuring oxidative stress. 

b) One of the most significant findings was that oral ingestion of ME-3 resulted in a substantial improvement in the systemic ratio of reduced (active) glutathione to oxidized (inactive) glutathione, which indicates a significant improvement in antioxidant protection throughout the entire body. 

c) Significant increase in Total Antioxidant Activity (TAA), which also indicates an improvement in both cellular and whole body antioxidant activity.

Swedes Find GSM Radiation Causes Nerve Damage at Very Low Doses Leakage Through the Blood-Brain Barrier

Microwave News: January/February 2003

In a new paper that is sure to reignite concerns over the safety of mobile phones, Drs. Leif Salford and Bertil Persson have shown that extremely low doses of GSM radiation can cause brain damage in rats.

Salford, a neurosurgeon, and Persson, a biophysicist, both at Swedens University of Lund, report that they see nerve damage following a single two-hour exposure at a specific absorption rate (SAR) of 0.002W/Kg. The effect becomes statistically significant at 0.02W/Kg. These nonthermal levels are a hundred to a thousand times lower than the 2W/Kg exposure standard recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).

Salford and Persson first showed that low-level microwave radiation can cause leakage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) over ten years ago (see MWN, J/F92 and J/A92). In this latest work, they again show that microwave radiation can impair the BBB, but they now add that the chemicals that leak through the BBB probably damage neurons in the cortex, the hippocampus and the basal ganglia of the brain. The cortex is close to the surface of the skull, while the basal ganglia are much deeper.

Salford and Persson write that the damaged neurons they observed may in fact be dead brain cells.

Perhaps their most surprising observation is that leakage through the BBB was still evident eight weeks after a single two-hour exposure even at these low doses.

Salford and Persson close their paper with this warning:

Neuronal damage of the kind here described may not have immediately demonstrable consequences, even if repeated. It may, however, in the long run, result in reduced brain reserve capacity that might be unveiled by other later neuronal disease or even the wear and tear of aging. We cannot exclude that after some decades of (often) daily use, a whole generation of users may suffer negative effects may-be already in their middle age.

Salford and Persson exposed three groups of eight rats to digital 915MHz microwaves at 0.002, 0.02 and 0.2W/Kg, and another eight served as controls. They note that, We realize that our study comprises few animals, but the combined results are highly significant and exhibit a clear dose-response relationship.

They used enough animals that it would be hard to say that what they saw is an artifact, said Dr. Henry Lai of the University of Washington, Seattle. Lai has previously reported that microwaves can cause DNA breaks in the brains of rats (see MWN, N/D94). DNA breaks could lead to cell death, and this would look like what Salford is reporting, Lai said.

Salford and Persson exposed rats that were 12 to 26 weeks old in order to simulate the level of development of human mobile-phone-addicted teenagers. The rats were allowed to live on for about 50 days after their exposures before they were sacrificed and their brains examined.

Dr. Yngve Hamnerius of Chalmers University of Technology in Gteborg, Sweden, had suggested this delay before examining the rats brains. Some 20 years ago, he and other researchers at Chalmers found damage in the brains of rabbits that had been exposed to pulsed microwaves similar to those from radar for one hour a day for three days. The Chalmers team told the 1984 annual meeting of the Bioelectromagnetics Society that no acute effects were seen, but that morphological and biochemical changes became apparent three to four months later.

The implications of this observation were never pursued until now. People very rarely wait before looking for an effect, Hamnerius told Microwave News. He believes that Salford and Perssons new work should be taken seriously. 

In the summer of 2001, Drs. Pierre Aubineau and Fatma Tre of the University of Bordeaux reported leakage from blood vessels in the brains of rats, including the BBB, exposed to non-thermal levels of microwaves (see MWN, N/D01).

The ability of microwaves to cause leakage through the BBB was first demonstrated by U.S. scientists in the mid-1970s, but research was later cut off by the U.S. military funding agencies. Over the years, sporadic reports have briefly rekindled interest in the area. 

Salford and Perssons own reports of BBB leakage have not been followed up. For instance, not a single study was undertaken by the U.S. mobile phone industrys six-year research effort directed by Dr. George Carlo and its lobbying arm, the CTIA.

This is yet another instance in which a long-standing observation has been ignored for too long, said Dr. Ross Adey, who has been doing brain research for more than 50 years. Adey is based in Redlands, CA.

Combined exposures to extremely-low-frequency electromagnetic
fields (ELF EMFs) and certain types of toxic chemicals
can act synergistically to increase brain cancer risks, according
to a new study of Swedish workers led by Dr. Marina
Pollán of Spain’s National Center for Epidemiology in Madrid.
But, interestingly, this finding holds only for gliomas—tumors
that develop in the glial cells, or supportive tissue, of the
brain—and not for meningiomas, which grow in the membrane
that surrounds the brain. While gliomas are malignant, meningiomas are usually benign,

“Our study is the first to try to assess a possible interactive
effect—that is, whether the effects of ELF EMFs vary when
workers are also exposed to chemicals,” Pollán told Microwave
News.
Pollán’s team, which includes Dr. Birgitta Floderus of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, analyzed cancer incidence among Swedish men who had held jobs between 1970 and 1989—a cohort of more than 1.5 million. Their results appear in the December 2002 issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention (11, pp.1678-1683).

In jobs likely to entail exposure to solvents, the glioma risk
was more than 50% higher among those also exposed to EMFs
above 2mG. For men exposed to pesticides or herbicides, the
risk was approximately doubled when combined with similar
ELFEMF exposures, and for lead the combined risk was nearly
four times greater.

All three associations are statistically significant. There was
a trend of increasing risk with higher EMF exposure for both
pesticides/herbicides and lead. The association for lead is based
on only a handful of cases.

No increase in the risk of glioma or meningioma was seen
for EMF exposures in the absence of chemical agents.
Although very few epidemiological studies have looked for
synergies between EMFs and other agents linked to cancer, Pollán
points out that such a combined analysis makes sense because
“there is consensus” that if EMFs do play a role in cancer, they
act as a promoter, requiring the presence of initiators such as
chemical carcinogens.

Others—for instance, Dr. Susan Preston-Martin of the University
of Southern California—have previously reported higher
risks for gliomas than for meningiomas among those exposed to
EMFs (see MWN,M/A90). And in a 1996 meta-analysis of brain
tumors among EMF-exposed workers, Dr. Leeka Kheifets, then
at EPRI and now at the WHO in Geneva, found that the risk
increased about 25% when the analysis was narrowed from all
brain tumors to only gliomas (see MWN, J/F96).

“You see a clearer picture when you exclude the non-gliomas,”
said Dr. Samuel Milham, an epidemiologist and consultant
based in Olympia, WA. “It’s basic epidemiology that you’re
better off not lumping different types of tumors together if there
are differences in etiology.”

Dr. David Savitz of the University of North Carolina, Chapel
Hill, who in recent years has expressed a great deal of skepticism
over the value for continuing to do EMF epidemiological studies
(see p.14 and MWN, M/J01 and S/O01), agreed that distinguishing among cancer types “is a very logical thing to do when you have the data to do it.” But he noted that the link between brain cancer and chemicals “is just as murky” as the link with EMFs. “How promising is it to put together two murky areas of research?” he wondered in an interview.
In his own study of workers at five electric utilities, Savitz
was unable to look at specific types of brain cancer because he
used death certificates that lacked such information (see MWN,
J/F95).",Electromagnetics,[Cancer] [MCS] EMFs and Chemicals Together Increase Brain Cancer Risk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4tsz68/cancer_mcs_emfs_and_chemicals_together_increase/

Updated August 1, 2012

Probably everyone is affected by EMF's to some degree. In the great majority of persons most of the effects, including increased rates of cancer, occur only after years of exposure. The general population may also be affected in the short term in subliminal ways such as:

difficulty concentrating,
attention deficits or memory problems
hyperactivity,
anxiety or irritability,
depression,
insomnia or less restful sleep. 

But in a minority of persons, the effects of EMF exposure are drastic, pronounced and clearly correlated to EMF exposure, can include any of the latter symptoms, and typically also:

burning skin,
burning/itching sensations inside the body,
chest pains, heart palpitations and arrhythmias,
tingling/numbness in a hand or foot (peripheral neuropathy),
pronounced tinnitus,
headaches,
inability to sleep,
seizures,
increased chemical and food sensitivities,
plus a whole range of other immune and neurological effects.

These symptoms can occur either immediately upon exposure, or some hours later. Why is this minority more sensitive than the general population? In many cases, we do not know. But we do know that having chemical sensitivities predisposes people to developing EMF sensitivity - approximately half of persons with MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivities) eventually develop EMF sensitivity/ES/EHS (Electrical Hypersensitivity). And a significant percentage of persons with EHS develop MCS later. In some cases the sudden induction of MCS or EHS correlates with the occurrence of Candida overgrowth. In other cases MCS is triggered by a major chemical exposure, and likewise, EHS can be first triggered by a stronger than usual exposure to EMF's. In both MCS and EHS, once a person has become sensitized, repeated exposure to the same sources that initially triggered the sensitivity then re-triggers the symptoms. Then what almost inevitably happens is that lower and lower intensities of exposure to these same sources begins to trigger the same symptoms, and the sensitivity begins to spread to wide variety of sources. In MCS, a person becomes more and more sensitive to lower and lower levels of a wider variety of chemicals, and in EHS to lower and lower levels of EMF from more types of electronic equipment and a wider range of frequencies.

Different people are sensitive to different frequencies, usually the ones that they are exposed to the most. At low frequencies, the problem is more often magnetic fields, but some people may be more sensitive to the voltage field. Shielding is only sometimes effective, can be expensive, and is a very complex subject. It all depends on frequency, and whether one is attempting to shield magnetic and/or voltage fields. Most low frequency fields from a small source fall off rapidly with distance, and so distance often helps, but not in cases where the frequencies are re-radiating throughout a home via the AC wiring. Proper grounding is also a complex subject.

In order to cool off EMF sensitivities, AVOIDANCE of exposure is absolutely necessary (also see ""EMF Solutions"") Pendants and protective devices do not work (see: EMF SCAMS). Avoidance requires reducing or eliminating as many triggers as possible. The longer one avoids exposure, the lower one's sensitivity tends to go. Then, if you get a lot of exposure again, your sensitivity will probably go up. It is important to avoid exceeding a certain threshold of exposure so that things don't start accelerating again. If you can keep your exposure low, and as soon as you begin to feel symptoms, turn off equipment or run out of that environment, you have a chance of not having your sensitivity increase to as high a level as before. It can be dangerous to become complacent. Be careful.

A LIST OF TRIGGERS / RE-TRIGGERS OF EMF SENSITIVITY:
(these can be initial triggers, and also re-trigger symptoms later and keep sensitivities elevated; 1) through 5) on the list below are the very worst, being very powerful direct emitters of RF energy that also contaminate all the power lines they are plugged into with a wide frequency range of dirty power, up to hundreds of feet away. The most common triggers are smart meters, other wireless devices and computer equipment)

1) Smart Meters APPEAR TO BE THE MOST COMMON INITIAL TRIGGER OF EMF SENSITIVITY. SEE MY SEPARATE ARTICLE: SMART METERS.

2) ""Induction-type"" cooktops (induction cooktops/stovetops are powerful transmitters of RF energy - that is how they work - the radio frequency heats the metal of the pots directly). Standing in front of one for only 15 seconds has caused severe EMF sensitivity. Each induction ""burner"" is a 1 to 2 kilowatt radiofrequency generator operating at about 27 KiloHertz, which is in the range to easily sensitize people to EMF. It is one of the very worst EMF sources that could be found in the home; hundreds of times stronger than any computer, etc. I have talked to someone whose electrical sensitivities were greatly exacerbated by standing in front of one for only a few seconds. Don't even consider any type of induction cooking. On the other hand, glass cook-tops with standard resistance heating elements underneath (the kind that glow red in a very fine double spiral) usually have a relatively low magnetic field, and no radio frequency emission at all.

3) Inverters - these are the devices that are used to convert DC battery power into AC power, commonly used in trailers and in solar systems - most photovolatic systems include inverters that contaminate the powerlines throughout the house and even the powerlines of neighboring homes. 

4) Welding machines.

5) Ultrasound machines. These emit powerful EMF from the scanning probe - that is what induces the crystal in the probe to emit ultrasound. Getting an ultrasound scan has been devastating for people with EHS, and appears to have been responsible for the death of one electrically sensitive woman after she had a mammogram ultrasound. Echocardiograms are done with a powerful ultrasound machine, and baby ultrasound scans are also. Most of them do not have adequate shielding.

6) A high magnetic field in the home or workplace (60 Hz magnetic field above 3 milligauss), caused for example by errors (crossed neutrals, crossed neutral and ground, or by power being returned to neutral or ground on water pipes) in AC wiring in the walls, by sleeping next to the AC power entrance/meter, or by power lines outside. Most persons with EHS need their environment to have a field under 0.3 milligauss, and for some, less than 0.1 milligauss. For using a gaussmeter to measure the magnetic fields in your home, see my article: Gaussmeters, and also the excellent, easily understandable book by Karl Riley: ""Tracing EMF's in Building Wiring and Grounding"" which is available from: 

http://www.magneticsciences.com/TracingEMFsBook.html "" rel=""external""&gt;http://www.magneticsciences.com/TracingEMFsBook.html 

7) Dirty power in the AC wiring of the home, either from an EMF source within the home (see 8 through 14 below) , or coming from outside from neighbors, a faulty street lamp, or elsewhere. If the problem disappears when you turn off all the the circuit breakers or the main breaker, it may be coming from inside the home. If turning of all the breakers does not solve the problem, the dirty power may be coming in on the neutral line or ground (which are not broken by turning off breakers).

8) Living near a cell-phone tower or Wi-Fi hub.

9) Wi-Fi in the home or building. Cell phones. Do not use anything wireless in the home. Especially not wireless baby monitors. Many home security/alarm systems use wireless, as do some intercom systems. Some transmit their signals through the house AC wiring - this is not good either. Be sure that your computer's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are turned completely off.

10) Excessive time working in front of a computer, particularly if a main-frame/desk-top unit is within a few feet. CRTs, LCDs, and TVs are common triggers/sensitizers. Once sensitized, many people with EHS cannot use a computer for more than a few minutes without debilitating symptoms, and many cannot use a computer at all. TV cable boxes, modems, DVD players and DVR's can also be a problem. Some types of radios, hi-fi/stereo/surround-sound amplifiers, or FM tuners are problematic and others may be ok. Most speakers radiate an intense magnetic field for some distance when producing loud sounds, particularly at low frequencies. Use both a gaussmeter and the AM radio to help evaluate these devices (see paragraph at the bottom).

11) Any type of switching power supply (see LOW EMF COMPUTING for an explanation of what a switching power supply is) that is on for a considerable time, including UPS computer back-up units, computer power supplies, the power supply inside a projector, and most types of battery chargers. Low voltage halogen lights are usually powered by a switching power supply. Almost any electronic device can include a switching power supply that generates EMF. Almost all ""wall-wart"" and ""brick"" types of power supplies are now of the high EMF switching type. So are the power supplies/electronic ballasts of all fluorescent lights and compact fluorescents, and the power supplies of almost all LED lamps (although with a custom linear current-controlled supply, LED's could be powered by DC without generating any EMF).

12) Dimmer switches, some types of motor/variable speed controls, mosquito zappers, electrostatic air purifiers and ultrasonic vaporizers (including a popular battery-powered ultrasonic inhaler that is held up to the face and commonly used for inhaling glutathione by persons with MCS). Hair dryers, most electric blankets and heating pads and even electric shavers and electric toothbrushes can be triggers. Of course microwave ovens are leaky, and dangerous for persons with EHS, unless they are at a considerable distance. I put mine in the far corner of the garage and I use a special $200. line filter on its AC line (call me if you want to know how to order this filter). I turn on the power to the microwave oven using a power strip only just before use, push the oven timer buttons with a 4 foot long wooden dowel, and run. I call it ""hit and run"". But I rarely use it, and usually defrost food in a steamer basket instead.

13) EMF from motors: the worst are brushless DC motors (often running on AC via a switching-type power supply). AC or DC motors with brushes are not as bad, because their emissions are not at one narrow frequency, but instead are spread out like white noise or static; but their RF emissions, and their magnetic field, can cause symptoms in some people. AC induction motors are very quiet in terms of RF, and the closed-frame type has only a local magnetic field. The cheaper type, open-frame AC induction motors can have a much stronger magnetic field, but are also quiet as far as RF goes. Thus the best motor type to have is closed-frame AC induction.

14) EMF can come from electronic thermostats or fan speed controls in heating or air conditioning systems, or from GFI's, smoke detectors/alarms, or carbon monoxide detectors, either when operating normally, or due to a malfunction. Faulty street lights, even hundreds of feet from a home, can generate large amounts of radio frequency that propagates into a home via the AC wiring (due to an intermittent lamp starter or power supply or bad lamp or photocell).

15) The speaker in the earpiece of a telephone, earphone, or headset generates an AC magnetic field while it is making sound. Some telephones are powered by a switching power supply, either internal or external. Phones usually incorporate microprocessors, and the caller ID screens generate some EMF. Often a lot of radio frequency noise is carried into a home on a phone line. TV Cable carries very high frequencies, that may or may not be a problem for some persons. Sometimes ground loops occur between a ground rod grounding a house, and a ground rod grounding the shield of an incoming TV Cable. Sometimes large amounts of radio frequency noise is detectable on an AM radio (see AM Radio as HF Sensor) when the phone line and the TV Cable are both connected, but disappears when either one is disconnected. 

16) Chemical exposures can initially trigger and later re-trigger EHS and its symptoms. Examples are toxic off-gassing from electronic devices, pesticide or herbicide exposure, heavy metal toxicity, VOC's or solvents in ""sick buildings"" or from remodeling, exposure to fragrances, air fresheners, and laundry dryer exhaust. (All of these can also initiate and retrigger MCS symptoms.) Any inflammatory conditions, such as infections or reactions to foods that one is allergic to can increase sensitivity to both electrical and chemical exposures.

Most of the devices listed above also send dirty power back onto the AC power line throughout the home, especially 1) through 

4). Some of these devices will register on a gaussmeter (see article: GAUSSMETERS), but some will only register on a device that is sensitive to higher radio frequencies such as a RF meter, or particular AM radios (see AM Radio as Inexpensive High Frequency Sensor).",Electromagnetics,[EHS] Triggers of Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4tmliw/ehs_triggers_of_electromagnetic_hypersensitivity/

&gt;My goodness, that’s a lot to respond to. I have of course heard Nixon’s name during my Hum research; in fact he seems to be revered in some circles. I seem to also recall there are several folks out there who have written that he was “killed by the Hum”. I’d certainly like to see evidence in that regard.

&gt;But perhaps for my benefit and for those who read this space, would you be so kind as to direct us to a summary of his Hum hypothesis? I’d like to look over it before I comment further. Cheers, Glen.

SueGrid answered:

&gt;Hi Glen, I only found your site today &amp; will definitely be saving your blog link!

&gt;This will be long, but mostly as an FYI, so no need for any big reply.

&gt;In late April/early May 2014 I unknowingly (at that time) became a member of the “World Hum Club.” It took me 5-months to stumble upon “hum” people online because I was researching VIBRATIONS first &amp; foremost (thinking ground vibrations, dredging, machinery, concrete floors, building construction, etc.) since the “vibes” are most miserable! However, the deep low droning rumbling drumming hum is none too fun either, especially when louder &amp; the ear/head pressure increases, plus staggering around, eyes get buggy/can’t read, head gets too tired/spacy, etc. (I never knew I could hear LF’s until this began. Didn’t know beans about any of this stuff!)

&gt;Above you asked the other commenter re Victor Nixon. I never knew him but when I finally found Hum sites/people, his info came up shortly thereafter (I included a few links further below which I had found of his info &amp;/or about him). Fascinating explanations re BPL/B-PLC &amp; what I call the “goons” in the Smart Grid Control Rooms who, per Victor, are the ones “ramping up the amps” (=my description) when they don’t get the Smart Meter readings they expect (he explains it more technically; this is my simpleton’s version); hence, the fluctuations in INTENSITY of the vibes &amp; hum. He said those people are “DANGEROUS” (&amp; too lazy &amp;/or greedy to waste time going into the field to fix the hold-up/problems at source).

&gt;I would agree re the danger. The mostly non-stop Vibes/Hum fluctuate between Nil-Low-Medium-Strong as a rule. BUT 3 x late Summer/Fall, the Vibes/Hum increased to “through the roof” level &gt; LOUD ROARING with what felt like VIOLENT vibrations of whole bldg. with violent vibrations of entire bed/body/chest/internal organs; plus an intense feeling of being “swarmed” by deadly “waves” (microwaves? emfs? soundwaves?). I was wiped out for a week after the 3rd episode that lasted 2.5-Hours at that extremely high Roaring intensity. I think it’s all very deadly &amp; not just a “sound” or just a “vibe” (both definitely miserable, very true), but feeling “waved” (microwaved?) is even more freaky!

&gt;Victor says events like that are due to [the goons ramping up the “amps”(?) which then leads to] massive leakage of MWR from the UNSHIELDED power lines (1930’s USA Power Grid not built for “data transmissions,” hence, not shielded as, for example, a “modern” shielded ethernet cable would be).

&gt;I don’t know if I have this right (not an engineer) but it would seem (if BPL/PLC is the culprit): –Power Lines leak MWR; –Power Lines &amp; MWR are both known to emit LFs on their own accounts; –Double-LFs = Droning Rumbling Hum; –LFs/Hum then create the Vibrations. –All Together a Deadly Mixture… especially if/when the Vibes/Hum are increased to “through the roof” intensity!

&gt;Building Construction sites had said vibrations are a big problem in contemporary life due to lesser quality residential &amp; commercial buildings. They also said USA Bldg. Standards were lowered in the 1970’s &amp; hence, concrete is now “thinner” &amp; “lighter” &amp; that support beams are now farther apart (40-ft. vs. 25-ft. previously). Also, that the “speed of sound through concrete is 10,600 FPS which is 8x faster than airborne 1129 FPS.” Wood, on the other hand, will “transmit vibration and sound 12x faster than airborne noise.” (I wonder what it is through Metal!?) Lastly, &amp; this connects to the LF-Vibes/Hum:

&gt;“Floor Vibration Control” – DEICON: http://www.deicon.com/floor-vibration-control/ […] “People are known to be very sensitive to floor vibration, e.g. vibration with an amplitude as small as 0.004 inch (0.1 mm) can cause aggravation. Floors that are most disturbing to the occupants often have low resonant frequencies; residential and office building floors having their fundamental frequency usually in the range of 3.5 to 8 Hz, fall in this category. This might be because the natural frequencies of the INTERNAL HUMAN ORGANS are also in the same frequency range, i.e., 4 to 8 Hz. That is, floor resonance [vibrations] can cause the INTERNAL ORGANS of the occupants to RESONATE [vibrate] resulting in an uneasy and irritating feeling.” […]

&gt;That’s an understatement! ....

&gt;Anyway, below are the only links I had found so far of letters/info/docs by &amp;/or about Victor Nixon. Maybe they will help.

~~~

&gt;2012 “About Author”: “Victor Nixon, a decorated Army veteran [SS: Special Services], holds a M.Sc. [Master of Science degree in] Computer Systems (Automation) Engineering and has over 30 years global experience in SCADA [Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition] systems design and installation relating to electrical power generation, distribution, and industrial use. Presently he lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.”

&gt;In one of Victor’s letters to govt. officials, he wrote that he was extremely healthy with six-pack-abs when he first began hearing the hum in 2009, I believe, which he tracked to a transformer 4.2 miles from his house (which he then asked himself, How/Why is it that I can hear that from so far away? &amp; his journey therein began).

&gt;Author is now Deceased 9/17/12, age 59, “heart attack” alone while staying at his Idaho cabin (subsequent to his public letter to the DOJ approximately 28 days earlier wherein he challenged them for infringing upon his civil rights by radiating him via the Smart Grid without his permission).

&gt;Pardon my tin foil hat but Allan Frey’s 1960’s experiments of stopping the hearts of rodents with pulsed microwave radiation comes to mind.

And that’s it. Not much but, then again, I learned a lot from those few writings.

Side Notes:

–Since I could not find an obit for Mr. Nixon (nor any photos), I went to check the SSA Death Index &amp; was surprised to learn the Govt. had passed a law 12/26/13 (1-year 12-days after Sandy Hoax) that no one can access the SSDI any longer until THREE YEARS have passed beyond the decedent’s date of death. They won’t even fill FOIA requests, it says. They blame it on “budgeting.” Oh sure. Your only option is to jump through Govt. red tape hoops &amp; become “certified” to access the SSDI.

—Definition: “SCADA generally refers to an industrial computer system that monitors and controls a process. In the case of the transmission and distribution elements of electrical utilities, SCADA will monitor substations, transformers and other electrical assets.”

So Mr. Nixon certainly seemed to have the perfectly matching credentials to be able to track down the BPL problem. Too good to be true? Too perfect of a match? Was he the ONLY one to ever figure it out? Maybe it’s the LF-SOUND (if increased too high) that we need to worry about more than the MWR? (Nay, BOTH are bad news!)

–Mr. Nixon mentioned in one of his above writings the company (&amp; its parent companies) that invented the BPL/PLC technology &amp; said they were an Israeli company (yet USA locations/incorporated that I could find).

When visiting their site I noticed they changed their company name end of 2013/beginning of 2014. Company name was AMPERION (Ampere + Ion. Ion being Hebrew for Eye. So, “Eye on the Amps”! Maybe it was too obvious!)

New Name: GRID EDGE. After seeing their “High Voltage” photo/graphics at their old/new sites, I wondered, Do they plan to push the Grid to the Edge of its non-data-transmission ability? (Israel also invented the cellphone, btw.)

Surely all involved, from inventors to local power companies, their engineers, techies, etc., must know that pushing wireless MWR data through a grid not built for that would cause horrendous problems!? Were they all that shortsighted? It’s hard to imagine. These are things I wonder about while being Vibed &amp; Drone-Hummed 24/7!

277,2016-07-08 05:07:22+00:00,self.Electromagnetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4rt1t2/auditory_brainstem_power_grid_smart_grid_the_hum/,False,"&gt;Experience of the vibrations: I have stated before that the Hum induces electrical-like vibrations in my body (plus clicking and popping in the head, ears and sinuses). The stronger the Hum, the worse the vibrations are. The strongest vibrations on the body I have when it rains or it is very humid and foggy. I would start hearing the Hum getting stronger and have strong vibrations moments before it would start raining! I have become EHS from the constant Hum, so much that I would get charged by static electricity (the more I would listen to the Hum, the more static in my body), which would get discharged every time I touch a pedestrian button of the traffic lights, I also feel body vibrations next to the traffic lights (all fitted with wireless remote viewing cameras, part of the smart grid technology). I feel vibrations in the grocery shops coming from the motors of their fridges or bakery ovens. Also, near every ATM (cash point) and pay till (all with wireless connection) – and I cannot use self-checking till for that reason and can barely wait on a queue at the tills to pay for my grocery due to the vibrations felt in my feet, guts and chest.

&gt;A reminder: I have heard the Hum while walking 2 m away from the Low and Medium Voltage overhead power lines, and about 10 m away from the HV power lines, also 50 m away from the electricity transformer and power lines pole and this have happened in 2 different locations, in two, other than UK, countries. On both locations the power line poles were fitted with many other wires and boxes. In one location, a small volcanic island (no active volcano though), there are no trains, no airport, no any gas pipelines (gas is transported in tanks), no heavy industry and the nearest continental land is 40 km away. There are however, satellite and microwave dishes, TV transmitter tower, ADLS internet connection but also BPL on this island. The Hum there is terrific by night; it can be heard outside the buildings as the classic diesel engine idling. While trying to video record it at that time, my camera would get lots of interference like dots and moving horizontal lines on the screen, and lots of hissing as a sound.

&gt;THE FACTS:

&gt;Usage of the 40 MHz. Many may wonder why I link the 40 MHz frequency (a quite high frequency) with the Hum (very low frequency).

&gt;This is a frequency used by the BPL systems, mobile phone operators (see Verizon, for instance: http://www.droid-life.com/2013/12/06/verizon-boosts-4g-lte-network-capacity-expands-to-40mhz-in-major-cities/), WLAN (Wireless LAN) internet and the 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz Wireless Internet (they all use 20 and 40 MHz as a channel bandwidth) – or the so-called 802.11n networking.
Please refer to the table of the Smart Grid frequencies, attached below.

&gt;Victor Nixon mentioned in one of his emails that while measuring the Hum, I should look for MESH Frequencies. I did not understand that at the time as I have done a very little research. Now I know, the 40 MHz is one of the so-called MESH Frequencies. In Victor Nixon’s paper about the Smart Grid, one can get more information and see how the interaction of the Power Grid frequencies (50 Hz and 60 Hz) and the wireless communications (which use the power lines and of course, the repeater antennas), produce the Hum’s low frequency and RF leaking radiation (the static noise heard in Hum places).

&gt;40 MHz and the 4G – is there any link? Apart from Verizon example, there is more:

&gt;http://www.nujira.com/nujira-delivers-world-record-40-mhz-bandwidth-for-4g-envelope-tracking-pa-i-386.php

&gt;Since 2012, when I first heard the Hum, there was an ongoing upgrade of the 4G mobile signal in my area. I have noticed that the Freeview signal at home gets severely disturbed when the Hum gets strong. Meanwhile, I got an apologetic flyer saying that there is a small chance that the 4G activation may cause disruption to the Freeview (the television which is received through an aerial) in my area. The 4G at 800 MHz was to be the culprit and they offered a free of charge filter to fix the problem. So, now with the filter, the signal does not get disrupted, but if I don’t switch on the BT box but only switch on the TV, on the screen I can see the white noise (like in the old analog TVs), but this time more structured (digitalized). Every time the Hum gets strong, through the screen’s white and black dots of the digitalized white noise, there are also many flashing lines and these are caused by the Hum electromagnetic interference. Their movement on the screen is in a perfect synchrony with what I hear in my ears as a microwave-induced tinnitus (hissing, static, shushing etc.)

&gt;The equation: Power Grid + Smart Grid = The Hum

&gt;By the way, in Windsor Hum case, the very source of the Hum there is, as Victor Nixon mentioned, a large BPL Control Center, situated just between Zug Island and Windsor.

&gt;P.S. Ways to cope: The only way (working for me, though not perfectly; and I hope it can help others) to reduce vibrations feelings in the body and to attenuate the Hum hearing, is to fill the ear canal with olive oil drops and close it gently with a small piece of cotton wool – I have been sleeping with this for the last 10 months. I can mostly hear the static noise from the Hum, and with time, it got reduced to a bearable level (though much stronger during the Hum storms), shifting from one ear to another. If the static noise ringing gets off completely in both ears, then one would not hear the Hum – I have experienced it twice upon wakening in the night, and it lasted about a minute – a complete, blissful silence.

&gt;To Danyele: I will finally get my test (long impedance tympanometry) done to establish whether or not I have MEM (middle ear myoclonus) – a condition which is being induced by the Hum and one of the main reasons I believe we hear the Hum. I will keep you updated for the results and my decision of how to manage it.

&gt;Regards,

&gt;Lidia

Fortunately, I was able to find the wiki and put back the URL.

There is little research on nutritional deficiencies of internet addicts and phone addicts. There is little research on treatments. Does addiction have the identical biochemistry of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)?

People with OCD have elevated glutamate:

&gt;Neuroimaging studies have confirmed that glutamatergic projections between the various frontal sub-regions and the striatum play a key role in the regulation of compulsive behaviours in humans ([10, 11]. Compulsivity has been associated with increased glutamatergic activity in the striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex in clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies [11].

'Glutamate abnormalities in obsessive compulsive disorder: Neurobiology, pathophysiology and treatment'

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3205262/

High glutamate is excitotoxic which can lead to neuron death.

People with OCD have low cortical GABA:

'In vivo effects of ketamine on glutamate-glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Proof of concept.'

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26104826

'Graduating' from a dumb phone to a smartphone caused my internet addiction. I could find only one paper researching effect of  mobile phones on glutamate and GABA:

&gt;it has been shown that intracortical excitability of the motor cortex was modified by acute exposure to GSM 900 (Ferreri et al. 2006). Intracortical inhibition/facilitation (ICI/ICF) curves were investigated, and results showed that ICI is reduced and ICF is enhanced after exposure to GSM signal (Ferreri et al. 2006). It has been suggested that ICI is mediated by GABA-A receptors (Hanajima et al. 1998), ICF is mediated by glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) (Ziemann et al. 1998), and an imbalance between ICI and ICF may lead to changes in the intracortical excitability (Sanger et al. 2001). It has also been suggested that oxidative stress may play a role in this phenomenon, since it reduces the release of GABA and the activity of GABA-A receptors at presynaptic and postsynaptic sites (Sah et al. 1999, 2002), which correlates with the observed decrease in EEG amplitude.

**Treatments**

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an essential amino acid. NAC reduces glutamate. NAC is an effective treatment for OCD:

My three Genova Diagnostics amino acid tests found an average level of cysteine. My Great Plains organic acid test found zero. I was surprised the two tests would have such a wide range. Great Plains is more accurate.  A long time ago when it was believed that glutathione cannot be orally absorbed, environmental medicine practitioners prescribed cysteine for detoxing. Cysteine is a cofactor of glutathione. My Genova Diagnostic's oxidative stress test found glutathione was low. I took cysteine and did not feel any improvement. I had a dumb phone at the time. 

Subsequently, manufacturers developed sublingual glutathione, lipoglutathione and glutathione IVs. I purchased sublingual glutathione and lipoglutathione and felt an improvement. I could tell glutathione was orally absorbed. 

When I discovered Great Plains reported my NAC level was zero, I erroneously assumed I did not need to take cysteine because I am taking glutathione. Cysteine is item #56 in the test in the category 'nutritional markers.' My cysteine was 0. Reference range is &lt;0.28.

It was not until I read papers on cysteine treating OCD that I purchased a bottle of 1,000 mg tablets of cysteine. One tablet per day. Cysteine acted quickly. Using land line phones, land line phone cards and when I absolutely have to a dumb phone which I keep off unless I need to make a call, greatly decreased my internet addiction. Yet, I was still slightly addicted. Taking cysteine eradicated the addiction.

Prior to learning about cysteine, I read inositol treats OCD. My SpectraCell vitamin and mineral test found my level of inositol was within reference range. Nonetheless, I took two large bottles of powder inositol. No improvement. I took valerian, saffron and ashwagandha. No improvement for addiction but improvement in other areas. See the herbal treatments section of the OCD wiki:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4745rn/wiki_obsessive_compulsive_disorder_ocd/

Carnitine prevents high glutamate:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/45ikme/wiki_neurotransmitter_glutamate_induces/

My Great Plains organic acid test found I had carnitine deficiency. Supplementing with carnitine did not reduce my internet addiction. Perhaps I didn't take enough carnitine? I will find out as environmental medicine practitioner #2 ordered a retest.

If you are addicted and have medical insurance, ask a holistic practitioner or an environmental medicine practitioner to order a Great Plains organic acid test. If you are deficient in cysteine, take it. 

If you do not have medical insurance, try cysteine. It is cheap.
Cysteine is an essential amino acid, a cofactor of glutathione and reduces nitric oxide. EMF increases nitric oxide. See the nitric oxide wikis.

Several months later, if cysteine is helping, get retested to ascertain if you are taking enough. If cysteine is not helping, your body may not need it.

Alternatively, a neurotransmitter test will detect glutamate and GABA. My Pharmasan Lab's neurotransmitter test when I was using a dumb phone found my glutamate and GABA were average. After switching to a smartphone, Pharmasan Lab's neurotransmitter found high glutamate. At the time, I had not figured out why.

**Lab Tests**

Great Plains complete organic acid test is covered by medical insurance.

Environmental medicine practitioner #2 had referred me to an otoneurologist. Otoneurologists are neurologist with an otoneurology speciality. Vertigo, lightheadedness and tinnitus.

Today, I had a follow up visit. The otoneurologist prescribed a tinnitus cocktail:

Niacin 100 mg once per day

L-lysine 500 mg once per day

Lipoflavonoid twice per day.

My Genova Lab amino acid test found I was deficient in lysine. A person with radio wave sickness posted on a forum that he suspects EMF causes a lysine deficiency. Has any one been tested?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3i5yff/llysine_has_been_shown_to_inhibit_the_production/


Niacin is a treatment for a high quinolinic acid ratio. See the two brain zapping wikis on quinolinic acid. I purchased niacin but have not taken it. There is a limit to the number of pills and tablets I can digest.

Lipoflavonoid is proprietary and contains: 

&gt;The product is actually a formula consisting of several ingredients.  The main ingredient is a lemon flavonoid extract containing eriodictyol glycoside and other flavonoids.  The product also contains several B vitamins, vitamin C, choline, and inositol.

https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/What+is+Lipo-flavonoid+and+does+it+work+for+tinnitus+or+other+ear+problems%3F/lipoflavinoid/

Last year, I took two large bottles of powered inositol. No improvement. I am taking liquid choline, vitamin C chewable tablets and B vitamins. No reduction in humming. I will take the niacin and lysine.

My otoneurologist ordered a hearing test. Today, I was told I have loss of hearing in low, medium and high pitch. 65% loss in my left ear and 50% in my right ear. Microwaves do damage hearing:

Sometimes when I am being zombie zapped, the blood in my brain feels like it is rushing to another region of my brain when I arise or look down. I asked my otoneurologist to order a hypofusion test. Brain hypofusion has been reported as a biomarker of radio wave sickness. He replied he does not do hypofusion tests. He ordered a MRI. I replied MRI are not sensitive enough to detect mild traumatic brain injury. I asked for a connectome test. He does not do it but referred me to a speciality clinic that might.

The appointment was supposed to be an office visit. My brain was strongly directed energy weapon attacked. I missed the Amtrak train to my first appointment with a new pulmologist and to my naturopath. 

Thus, the naturopath's office visit was turned into a Skype call. Hackers hacked Skype, so I had to quickly pay for one month's air time for mobile phone I had ceased using. Afterwards, I purchased transfer factor by Source Naturals. I reschedule my pulmologist visit.

Two weeks later, I commuted to my pulmologist office and to my naturopath's office for another visit and to purchase the brand she prescribed.  ResearchedNutritionals.com manufactures several brands of transfer factor. I purchased Transfer Factor Sensitive which does not have any other ingredient. The ingredients in the other brands of transfer factor can be purchased at a lower price elsewhere.

While I had bronchitis from January through March 2016, I had made an appointment with a new pulmologist. I gave me him IgA and IgM test from November 2015 and asked him to reorder the test. I waited to take the test until I took 1 to 2 capsules per day for one month of transfer factor by Source Natural to ascertain its effectiveness. I continued taking the immune herbs in the immune treatments wiki and eating maitaki and shitaki mushrooms. While taking transfer factor, I got bronchitis again. 

Yesterday, my pulmologist was very kind to squeeze me in. He ordered a chest x-ray and another pulmonary function test which was worse than the first. He told me my lungs are inflamed and prescribed Advair and ProAir RespiClick. 

He went over the second immunoglobulin test by Labcorp. He advised to see an immunologist but did not know of one to refer me to. My IgA and IgM were almost as well low as they were in November 2015.  I reported my first test at:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/40l264/immune_my_immunoglobin_a_g_and_m_tests/?

IgA &lt; 15. Reference range 87 - 352

IgM 12. Reference range 26 - 217

My test in November just had a total IgG.  Therefore, my pulmologist ordered IgG subclass 1, 2, 3 and 4. My IgG subclass 2 and 3 were low.

IgG subclass 2 was 69. Reference range 117 - 747.

IgG subclass 3 was 2. Reference range 41 - 129.

To rule out an allergy, my pulmologist had ordered an IgE test. My IgE was 17 which is within the reference range of 0 to 100. 

Transfer factor possibly could have elevated my immunoglobulin if my EMF exposure had not increased.  Though I had barely used my mobile phone, my brain was repeatedly attacked day and night by directed energy weapons to compensate for keeping my phone off when I was not making calls. Mobile phones' modulation is being used as an energy weapon. Researched Nutritionals transfer factor prescribed by my naturopath may be more potent than Source Naturals. I have not started taking it as I would like to finish Source Naturals first.

Yesterday afternoon, I purchased low dose naltrexone (LDN) at a compound pharmacy. The compound pharmacist told me other off label uses for LDN is pain relief and nicotine addiction and that he fills prescriptions up to 5 mg. I wonder whether LDN reduces internet addiction. LDN has a calming effect on my body. My breathing is less fast and shallow. My sore throat and coughing have decreased. Quick effect for one day!

The prescription is to start with 1.5 mg before bed time. Build up to 3 mg.  I will ask my pulmologist to reorder the immunologulin test to ascertain whether low dose naltrexone elevated my immunologulins.

The essential oils my naturopath prescribed is dōTERRA On Guard. 

http://doterra.com/en/ourProducts/essentialOils/proprietaryBlends

It is a proprietary combination of wild orange, clove, cinnamon, eucalyptus, and rosemary essential oils. Two drops of doTERRA On Guard into boiling water. Inhale steam. Two drops on soles of feet at night.

I am too ill to research papers on these essential oils. There are no papers on transfer factor and low dose naltrextone. Typically, I would have linked to articles on essential oils, transfer factor and low dose naltrexone with this post but I am too ill. Volunteers?

Transfer factor is sold at health food stores. Naltrexone requires a prescription. Has any one else taken transfer factor or low dose naltrexone for their compromised immune system? Has any one asked for immunoglobulin tests?

When either NO2 or ONOO- nitrate the amino acid Tyrosine, the resulting product is Nitrotyrosine. Nitrotyrosine is found in a number of pathological conditions and is considered a marker for NO-dependent oxidative stress.

&gt;Antioxidant molecules that react and neutralise the Carbonate Radicals and Nitrogen Dioxide radicals formed from Peroxynitrite, rather than Peroxynitrite itself directly, can also be termed Peroxynitrite Scavengers.

&gt;Dr Paul Cheney stresses the importance of Glutathione and Selenium (an antioxidant metal and constituent of Glutathione) as a defence against ONOO- and in this he is correct, as Glutathione is the body's main intracellular and extracellular antioxidant enzyme, particularly with regards to controlling free radical damage. However, whilst both Glutathione and SOD help to prevent oxidative damage to the mitochondrial membranes, SOD is directly responsible for containing Superoxide, which is arguably of most primarly importance, Glutathione being a secondary line of defence.

&gt;The nutritional element Selenium and the mitochondrial cofactors CoEnyzme Q10 and Lipoic Acid also offer a degree of protection. Selenium is an antioxidant metal and forms part of the Glutathione enzyme. The mitochondrial cofactors can help to neutralise ONOO- and also recycle Glutathione.

&gt;However, in the presence of Mercury, Selenium is not able to bind with Glutathione Peroxidase, and so it is not able to assist SOD in breaking down Superoxide. In addition, most CFS patients (if not all) do not produce enough Glutathione on account on methylation problems. Inadequate levels of Glutathione can result in intra- and extra-cellular oxidative damage.

&gt;Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) is the protective antioxidant enzyme against free radical damage caused by Superoxide produced inside the mitochondrial membranes. Whilst not protection against ONOO- per se, it does prevent the formation of ONOO- inside the mitochondria by reacting with the Superoxide (O2-) formed, so that it cannot combine with any Nitric Oxide produced inside the mitochondria. Of course, most of the ONOO- produced is probably formed outside of the mitochondria, as discussed above.

&gt;The presence of external antioxidants, i.e. those present in antioxidant rich foods that are ingested, will also help to minimise oxidative stress cause by elevated Peroxynitrite levels to some degree, but the internal antioxidants, i.e. those produced by the body, are of primary importance. Dr Martin Pall argues that these are not generally that effective as single agents in preventing ONOO- mediated damage to cells and tissues, but that combinations of them may be somewhat more effective overall.......

&gt;I would also add the following things to avoid:

&gt;◾Avoid raising one's L-Arginine levels above normal, as this may result in increased NO production - this might include either L-Arginine supplements or consuming Arginine-rich foods. However, if L-Arginine levels are low, then one may benefit from L-Arginine supplementation boosting its role in neurotransmitter production in general. An Amino Acid Profile would confirm one's present L-Arginine level.

&gt;◾Exposure to strong electromagnetic fields.

&gt;Dr Paul Cheney (in 2004) has suggested a number of means of fighting high Peroxynitrite levels. 

&gt;Increasing Uric Acid levels. Uric acid is a powerful scavenger of peroxynitrite. Cheney has found uric acid levels in the CFS patients he has examined to be extremely low. Uric acid is formed from RNA and DNA metabolism within the body - through apoptosis (the programmed death of cells and their consumption by the body) or by fasting (by consuming the body's own cells). In terms of external sources of RNA, some excellent sources include Spirulina algae, uncontaminated raw meats or fish (such as Sushi) - cooking destroying RNA and DNA, raw milk, non-denatured whey protein, eggs, fresh/young foods (nuts, seeds, sprouts, baby lettuce etc.). Clearly many sources of raw meat and fish are contaminated and may contain elevated levels of parasites. However, one should also consider that many raw vegetables also contain parasites which can be problematic if they are not washed properly. Excessive raw vegetable intake may also be problematic from a 'cold energy' perspective. If vegetables are to be cooked steaming is preferable, but microwaving should be avoided (for a variety of reasons!) as it damages the RNA more than any other cooking method. Please see the Digestive Disorders page for information on Spirulina and also non-denatured whey protein drinks.

I never felt a need to immediately respond to text notifications and email notifications. Android's default visual notification was too tiny and android's sound notification was too short. I researched and downloaded open source notification apps with a larger visual notification and a longer sound. 

Visual notifications were ignored until I finished whatever I was doing. The long audio notification interrupted my concentration but did not compel me to immediately respond. I created several email accounts to identify where the junk email were originating from. I complained to Paypal that they disclose the actual email addresses of buyers to its sellers and that their sellers were reselling the email addresses. PayPal did not care. eBay and Amazon do not disclose buyers' email addresses. I canceled my Paypal account and resumed using my credit card. Lots of junk mail from Alibaba's sellers and minibox.

Criticism of the interpretation of the LTE mobile study - Better Business Bureau diagnostic radio expect more than doubling the radiation exposure 

As pure whitewashing criticized the Better Business Bureau diagnostic Funk eV reporting this IZMF, the PR agency of mobile operators that through the construction of the new LTE mobile networks, the radiation exposure would only increase ""low level"" is. After IZMF opinion the radiation exposure has increased by 40% on average. And, although the sites studied, with one exception, only one of the four network operators have LTE system was in operation. ""If only all operators have built their LTE networks, we expect on average a doubling of the radiation exposure,"" said Joern Gutbier, Board of diagnostic radio.

The IZMF report clearly shows that 20 of the 91 measurement points yielded a radiation exposure of more than 10 mW / m Of some with extreme values, such as 88 mW / m International expert bodies, the Austrian doctors and Commerce, calling 1mW / m2 as the limit of exposure.

The mobile operators also conceal that LTE was developed without a single investigation of the impact on the environment and health, the consumer protection agency. Even the Federal Government confirmed this in the printed matter 17/1709: ""The Federal Government has no concrete studies on LTE before."" And even the Federal Office for Radiation Protection provides in LTE ""Further research is needed on possible effects on children and in the long

""It could be confirmed by studies that children are at risk but also long Nevertheless, the population is exposed to an uncontrolled field experiment with ever-increasing radiation exposure, ""criticized Gutbier.

According to the state of international knowledge, so Gutbier further, the limits are far too high and ""in every respect protection unfit"". This is again impressively by the second report of the group of scientists, BioInitiative debuff which auswertete 1,800 current studies on the subject. They also call for a limit of 1 mW / m

In this sense, diagnostic radio calls for a policy of reconnaissance and radiation minimization. "" ""In any case, we do not need 12 parallel operating mobile networks. This energy, radio technical and economic nonsense beyond compare, ""said Gutbier, should actually recognize any politicians and no longer accept.

**Calling cards for pay phones**

I researched calling cards to use at pay phones. Hackers deleted the file from my hard drive. I went to Walmart and Dollar Tree. They no longer sell calling cards. I went to 99 Cent Store. Their phone card has $1 on it. There is a pay phone surcharge of $1. The employee did not know how to put more value on the card. I resumed researching calling cards and typed up a replacement plain text file.

I purchased a TocaTel calling card at Alberton's grocery store. $.03 per minute. No monthly maintenance fees but it detracts $1 surcharge for each call at a pay phone. eBay sells used calling cards. Calling cards are not popular. There is little competition for them. I paid $5 for a Verizon card with $25 on it. Fortunately, Verizon does not recognize the pay phone in the hall of a library as a pay phone. No $1 surcharge. 

In January 2016, I retrieved my netbook and computer bag from storage to keep in my car. I copied my contacts and appointments from my Droid 4 phone and updated my plain text files. Since 2002, I have saved my contacts and my appointments as plain text files.  In January 2016, hackers circumvented the power settings of my MSI netbook. My battery would not charge. I charged both batteries using my second MSI netbook.

In January 2016, I had stopped using the Droid's wi-fi and stopped using it as a PDA. I used the Droid only to make phone calls until I researched VoIP apps. 

When I travel, I pack a folding lawn chair in my car. I carried the chair to the pay phone at the library. I turned on my netbook to retrieve a phone number.  The battery was charged. An EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack immediately shut down my netbook. I turned it back on. Another EMP attack shut it down. I turned my netbook back on. The third EMP attack bricked my battery. 

I inserted my SD card into a library computer to print out my contacts and calling list. I returned to the pay phone to make calls.  I replaced the battery with the battery from my second MSI netbook. At pay phones, I use the print outs and not my netbook.  I take hand written notes while talking. I type up the notes. This is time consuming.  In lieu of using a smartphone as a PDA, I  print out my appointments, to do list, shopping list, driving directions, etc. I updated my lists on my netbook. I inserted a microSD card to copy the lists to print them using a library's computer. Hackers circumvented copying by making my microSD card read only.

I am looking forward to receiving in June a PocketC.H.I.P PDA.

[Mitigation: Mobile Phone] Finally, an open source PDA! PocketC.H.I.P has a qwerty keyboard, 4.3"" touchscreen, 3,000 mAH LiPo battery and Debian preinstalled. Allwinner A13 CPU, 512MB of DDR3 and 4 GB NAND for $49 plus $20 shipping.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4f9epo/mitigation_mobile_phone_finally_an_open_source/

**Skype**

I purchased a Skype phone number and a 90 day calling plan. I made a test call. I made a few calls. Several days after Easter, I had a telephone conference with a renown naturopath. The naturopath skypes. Hackers hacked my Skype. Being charged at $485 per hour, I quickly took out my Droid 4 phone from a steel child's lunch box in my car, called 661 and paid $49 including tax for an one month prepaid plan. I called the naturopath. During the one month, I rarely used the phone. More hacking of Skype, Skype's customer service chat and the internet connection. I uninstalled Skype. Hackers circumvented redownloading Skype.  A possible solution would be to reinstall AntiX MX linux. First, I would need to back up my personal files from my hard drive. Hackers circumventing backing up by making my micro SD card read and flashdrive only.

**3G phones have less modulation and SAR than 4G phones**

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4ia0ix/wiki_mitigation_mobile_phones_3g_800_900_mhz/

Hence, I purchased a Palm Pre 2 3G phone and Selectel Wireless' $75/per year dumb phone plan. Two thousands air time minutes and no data. 

http://www.selectelwireless.com/product-category/plans/

Page Plus Cellular has a similar plan, $85/per year for 2,000 minutes and 10 MB but does not sell the plan on its website. Page Plus refused to refer their resellers who do sell it on their website. Selectel has the same excellent voice quality as Page Plus and Verizon. Verizon uses CDMA. CDMA does not get reduced in quality when sold to resellers as GSM does. CDMA operates in 800 MHz and 1900 MHz.

In 2012, I had not reacted to my first smartphone, a Palm Pre2. I hoped the same would be true now. As I described in my EEG test post, I did react a little to my Palm phone. Less so than Android 3G and 4G phones.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4hwllp/rws_biomarkers_my_ambulatory_24_hour_eeg_brain/

I encourage redditor's to post their meter reports comparing their 3G phones with their 4G phones.

The eBay seller had restored the phone to factory settings which require a Palm account. Palm went bankrupt and is not setting up accounts. I can call out and can dial *86 to retrieve voicemails. The phone does not ring or turn off. I remove the battery to turn off the phone. I cannot access the home page or settings. No access to voicemail notification, browser, etc.

The benefit of not being able to set up a Palm account is that the used battery lasts a very long time. Palm and apps are not running in the background.  Though when I had set up a Palm account on my first Palm Pre 2 and Palm Treo, the batteries still lasted much longer than Motorola Droid X, 3 and 4 batteries despite my not setting up a Google account. SAR uses battery. Palm Pre 2 emits less SAR.

I will be researching 3G Blackberries that have a removable battery to buy.

**Watches and alarm clocks**

I replaced the battery in an old watch. I missed wearing a watch when I used Androids. One and a half years ago, I purchased alarm clocks.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3w9ed6/wiki_brain_zapping_eeg/

Altered EEG is a biomarker of RWS.

Last month, my environmental medicine practitioner referred me to a large neurology clinic. The clinic has several neurologists specializing in concussions and epilepsy. I do not have epilepsy but have sustained leaky brain from brain zapping and sustained numerous mild blast induced traumatic brain injuries from remote laser induced blasts. 

The neurologist believed in radio wave sickness and directed energy weapons. He advised to relocate to a rural third world country.

I requested an EEG test and brain zapping biomarkers VEGF test and neuron-specific enolase test. He ordered them. Two days ago, Labcorp took the blood tests:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/44hi66/wiki_brain_zapping_biomarkers_offered_by_labs_but/

Because I would get EEG tested the next morning, I didn't sleep with a vintage cast iron kettle on my head. I searched for my post on iron kettles in /r/badBIOS but my post had been removed.

In the early morning of Monday, May 2, 2016 while I was sleeping, directed energy weapons applied heavy pressure on the top of my head and gave me a swollen eyes and a stiff neck.  At Labcorp, directed energy weapons attack gave me a headache. The neuro tech applied too much pressure scrubbing my head, marking my head with a pencil, applying the electrodes and applying tape over the electrodes. Over my objections, he heavily pressed on the electrodes up to nine times. I interrupted the session to ask to speak to a supervisor. I informed the supervisor the neuro tech was a sadist and asked what the protocol was. How many times does an electrode need to be pressed down. She did not know. The supervisor scheduled me for the following day with a different neuro tech. The neuro tech pulled my hair removing the electrodes. He did not wash off the red pencil from my forehead. He did not notify me that I had red marks on my forehead. At 3:30 in the afternoon I happened to look in a mirror and noticed the red marks. I left a voicemail with the supervisor.

The second neuro tech was gentle. She pressed twice. Once to lay the electrodes on the lotion and a second time to tape the electrodes down. The electrodes were taped to my head, forehead and below my collar bone. 

Written instructions included limiting cell phone usage and texting. I did the opposite. I want a diagnosis of radio wave sickness and blood brain barrier permeability (leaky brain). During the EEG test, I tested my replacement Palm Pre 2 3G phone and a Motorola Droid 4 4G phone. 4G has stronger modulation and SAR than 3G. My Motorola Droid 3 3G phone has stronger modulation and SAR than the Palm Pre 2 phone I regrettably donated.  

[J] [Mobile phones] [Brain Zapping: Modulations] Frequency modulations, pulsed or repeated signals, are bioactive. The collective papers on modulation appear to be omitted from consideration in the recent WHO and IEEE science reviews.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4bpt3j/j_mobile_phones_brain_zapping_modulations/?


Last month, I purchased an used Palm Pre 2 replacement phone on eBay. Making calls with it verified that the Palm definitely has less modulation and SAR. Why? The used battery lasts a long time. Whereas, my brand new extended Droid 4 batteries die after talking for one hour. SAR uses the battery.

I am fortunate that I used dumb phones for calls only and my computer for everything else up till 2012. In 2012, I purchased my first smartphone. A brand new Palm Pre 2 from Amazon. Terrific voice quality. Terrible browser. Very long lasting battery. I used it with a Page Plus Cellular dumb phone plan and continued using my computer for everything else.

Regrettably in December 2013, I found an used Motorola Droid X. I never activated it. The following month, in January 2014, I learned Android OS and how to use the phone as a PDA. In July 2014, two EMP attacks destroyed the screen. While searching for a replacement, I discovered Motorola manufactured a slider keyboard. I purchased a Droid 3 to use as a PDA. Had I realized then that I had became addicted to the SAR and modulation of android phones, the Droid X would have been my first and last Android phone.

A stingray had been and continues to intercept my cell phone calls and reducing the reception down to one bar or zero bar regardless where I was located. Volume was too low. I researched and purchased an older Palm with an external antenna. The Palm Treo increased the bar by one. I could not feel its modulation and SAR. I tolerated the phone fine even though it had a large external antenna. 

The Palm Treo required an unique charger which took up space in my backpack. I mistakenly decided to donate the Palm phones and activate a Motorola Droid 3. I remained on the dumb phone plan. I kept the 3G off. I barely ever used 3G. I mostly used wifi. I made few phone calls. I sent few text messages. I sent mostly emails. The android phones brain zapped me. I was not addicted to the phone itself. I did not frequently check to see whether I had voicemails, text messages or emails. 

I became addicted to the internet. In 2013 and 2014, I didn't use the phone's wi-fi much. I mostly used computers. Having the phone on inside my backpack induced internet addiction. I became addicted to using online computers be they hard wired or wi-fi. In 2015, I regrettably switched to a smartphone plan for Motorola Droid 4 4G, used mostly the Android's wi-fi and used my computers very little.

Neither my family nor me have ever been addicted to smoking, alcohol, drugs or gaming. I did not have an addictive personality. Microwave modulation causes internet addiction.

Due to brain injury caused by Droids and directed energy weapons, my body is reacting to the replacement Palm Pre 2. Reaction is mild compared to Androids. More information on 3G phones emitting less radiation than 4G is at:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4i257t/mitigation_mobile_phones_my_mitigation_from/

I recorded the time I put on my copper cap and the time I removed it. I wanted the EEG test to detect whether the copper cap shielded the phones. I applied four layers of copper foil to the inside of the cap.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3r0vn5/shielding_brain_copper_foil_lined_wool_watch_cap/?

I was instructed to keep an EEG diary of when I eat, take medications, sleep, arise and have an event.  The medical device has a red beeper to press for an event. Events are described in its own column in the diary titled Push Button Log. An event for me was headache, pressure on the top of my head, dizziness, getting knocked out (sleepiness), sleep paralysis, head shaking, and difficulty concentrating.

Initially, I hand wrote the diary in the one page hand out. I had copied the hand out so I could continue on page two. I needed three pages so I typed my diary and emailed it along with a list of my medications to the neuro tech. This morning, the electrodes were removed.

My follow up appointment is next month. After I receive the test results, I will write part two.

Medical insurance pays for an ambulatory 24 hour EEG test. Medical insurance will not pay for a VEGF and 
neuron-specific enolase test. Hence, it is important for subscribers to anonymously report their lab tests. We need to identify biomarkers. 

I already paid for two labs my medical insurance will not pay for that turned out not to be biomarkers for me. Great Plains PLA2 test and Cyrex Lab's blood brain barrier permeability test. The neopterin test, which medical insurance does not pay for, was a biomarker for me. Therefore, the biopterin test would probably be so. I wanted a biopterin test but medical insurance does not pay for it. If these tests are biomarkers for you, please advise.

Rocephin helped but I needed a second injection. I returned to the urgent care. A different doctor saw me and refused to prescribe rocephin.

I called pulmonologists. The next available appointment was in two months. This Tuesday is my appointment. I discovered hackers deleted the train schedule. I tried to redownload the train schedule but hackers terminated my internet. I drove to FedEx Office to pay to use their computer to complete this post.

While earthing at a dog beach with my dog, two toes on my right foot some how got infected. After 1 1/2 weeks, the infection spread to two more toes. An ER physician prescribed rocephin. Th antibiotic slightly helped my bronchitis and infected toes. 

I looked on the internet for an immunologist who was not an allergist but could not find one. The immunologist/allergist I saw refused to look at my infected toes because he does not treat feet and recommended I make an appointment with a podiatrist. Podiatrists do not treat skin infections.

The doctor explained low immunoglobulin could be a symptom of rheumatoid arthritis. He told me he was ordering a rheumatoid arthritis test. I replied mine was negative. He ordered the test any way. 

After the appointment, I searched for papers on immunoglobulin A or M and rheumatoid arthritis. I did find a paper on rheumatoid arthritis has elevated circulating immune complexes (CICs),  tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-17, IgG and IgE.  'The Pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis is Associated with Milk or Egg Allergy'

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4784182/

I reported in this post that my interleukin-1 is normal. I have not had the other labs.

The doctor wrote Labcorp test code 164962 (ANA) on Labcorp's test order. I went on Labcorp's website to look up the test. It is for Sjögren's disease. 

https://www.labcorp.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hACzO_QCM_IwMLXyM3AyNjMycDU2dXQwN3M6B8JG55AwMCuv088nNT9QtyI8oBPK_DWA!!/dl2/d1/L0

I had told the doctor my sjogren's test was negative. He had not told me he was ordering a sjogren's test. Good that I looked up the test. I will not waste my time repeating tests and commuting to see him to get the results.

I had given the doctor my sensory  motor neuropathy complete antibody panel test by Quest.  I had the test on December 25, 2015, just three months before seeing him. This panel includes immunoglobulin A and M, rheumatoid arthritis, sjogren's and other tests.  He had not taken the time to review the labs I brought with me. My sensory motor neuropathy complete antibody panel test results:

My rheumatoid  factor was 9. Reference range is less than 14.
My sjorgen's antiboddy (SS-A) was less than 1. Reference range is less than 1.
Sjogren's antibody (SS-b) was less than 1. Reference range is less than 1.

I asked the doctor to order a comprehensive immune panel. He denied my request.

The doctor told me he is ordering allergy testing. I replied I had few allergies, that I am not exposed to the few allergens I am allergic to, that I would give him my old allergy tests and that radio wave sickness was compromising my immune system. I told him my Great Plains test found I have a mold infection, that mold is no longer in my environment and that I cannot breathe through my sinuses. I asked him for a nasal culture to test for a sinus mold infection. I asked for four blood brain barrier tests. He denied my requests. Over my objections, he ordered allergy testing. Of course, he profits by ordering allergy testing performed by his employees.

The doctor charged $200 for a 20 minute appointment. I complained the appointment was too short for a first appointment and that I needed treatment. My request for additional time was denied.

My request for a follow up appointment to get treatment was denied. Follow up appointments are scheduled after all testing is performed. I informed staff I would fax my old allergy tests. Staff refused to make a follow up appointment. I asked for a referral to an immunologist. No referral. I will resume searching for an immunologist who is not an allergist. 

I retrieved old antibiotic cream from my storage unit. Antibiotic cream applied on my toes eradicated the infection. I still have bronchitis though I am taking the immune tinctures in the immune: treatments wiki and lung tinctures such as lungwort and american ginseng. My Great Plains organic acid test found zero vitamin C. I am taking vitamin C and sunbathe while earthing with my dog.

This immunologist is the third physician who does not know why my immunoglobulin A and M are low.

Manufacturers should conduct a study and upload the study on their website. Whether the Safe Connect Plus strengthens a mobile phone user's biofield can be tested with biofield equipment:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/43j6zu/wiki_biofield_measuring_body_emf_exposure_using/

Manufacturers should include specifications of their products. Description: ""our proprietary formula includes the natural earth’s grounding frequency, which is about 7.8 hertz. This frequency provides a constant state of grounding for your entire being. Energetically, you are not independent, running only on the energy of your own Biofield.""

The description sounds like an Aulterra shield which contains paramagnetic and diagmagnetic ground up rocks. A paper found it does shield.

There are several species of albizia. The only available tincture is of albizia julibrissin flower and bark manufactured by Planetary Herbals. Chinese herb stores sell albizia bark pieces to make tea. Albizia trees grow in chinese neighborhoods in the United States. The tree produces pink flowers in the spring to early summer.

The pineal gland produces melatonin, biopterin and harmine. There is speculation the pineal gland produces DMT. The pineal: melatonin wiki and the pineal: biopterin has papers on EMF suppressing them. There are no papers whether EMF suppresses harmine and DMT. Nonetheless, we shall take a precautionary measure by researching whether microdosing herbs having harmine and DMT are worth while for their medicinal properties.

Harmine is a MOAI (MAO inhibitor). MAOI's inhibit the liver from breaking down seratonin and dopamine. Syrian rue is higher in MOAI than passionflower. Depending on the microdosage, harmine can be dangerous when combined with certain foods:

Probably, because I have been posting my labs in /r/electromagnetics. I had copied driving directions to a light rail station and bus information from the downtown light rail station to the medical center. I typed the date, time and address of my doctors' appointments in my appointment text file. During and after doctors appointments, I type of notes. I created the files using OI Notepad or Turbo Text open source android apps. Hackers inserted a white space in between the letters rendering the above files illegible.

This morning I planned on uploading several of these files. Using my laptop which has AntiX MX linux, I cut the personally identifiable information and pasted it into a brand new text file I created using LibreOffice. I saved the emptied LibreOffice file. I uploaded the emptied LibreOffice text file to VirusTotal. VirusTotal detected this brand new file is connected to Microsoft SkyDrive. I never used SkyDrive. 

VirusTotal Analysis tab: ""Trusted source! This file belongs to the Microsoft Corporation software catalogue."" 

VirusTotal 'Additional Information' tab:

""This file belongs to the Microsoft Corporation software catalogue. The file is often found with (Image27030)_Program Files_WindowsApps_microsoft.microsoftskydrive_16.4.4204.712_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe_ModernSkyDrive_product_SkyDrive_resources_css_rootFragment.css as its name. The file belongs to the Windows 8 product, it can be found, for example, in SW DVD5 NTRL Win 8 64BIT Latvian Win/Pro.""

VirusTotal identified the file as belonging to Windows 8. My computers do not have Windows 8. The library computers have Windows 7.

Microsoft changed their brand name of SkyDrive to OneDrive. ""OneDrive is pre-installed on Windows 10, enabling your documents and photos to be saved to OneDrive automatically.""

""Collaborate with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote from your desktop, mobile device, and the web."" 

https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/

I use Word only when using library computers because they do not have Notepad. I save the documents as .txt. I have never used OneNote. I did not use Word to create or edit this file. I used an android app to create the file and LibreOffice to edit it.

I suspected LIbreOffice was infected. In the evening, I created two brand new text files using LibreOffice. I uploaded the files to VirusTotal. They are not infected with Microsoft SkyDrive.  The plain text files I created on my android smartphones had embedded SkyDrive that is detectable only by cutting the text and pasting them into a new text file?

Apparently, hackers downloaded SkyDrive (OneDrive) on my smartphones. Perhaps they altered my plain text files into OneNote? Would VirusTotal identify OneNote as OneNote?

Hackers performed EMP attacks on my laptop. Immediate shutdown four times. I commuted to the library to type this and to upload the files. Ran out of computer time at the library. I uploaded one file and will upload the other files.

I updated my post on destroying the 4G chip from my Motorola Droid 4 phones. After I successfully used my unactivated rooted phone that had the Qualcomm 4G destroyed, hackers remotely bricked it. The red Motorola icon displays but the phone will not complete booting up. I had used the phone's wi-fi. Either the hackers bricked the phone via wi-fi or they used the smaller Qualcomm 4G chip. Destroying both the smaller Qualcomm 4G chip and the larger 4G chip destroyed one phone. The other two phones had their larger Qualcomm 4G chip destroyed. The unrooted phone would not complete booting up. The rooted phone booted up and worked fine for the first several days.  

I resumed using my activated phone until my Verizon plan expired. I kept my phone off and stored inside an aluminum box inside a vintage child's steel lunch box. I turned the phone on only to check voicemails and to make calls. Last year, I submitted a post on Tawkon radiation app. Tawkon always alerted that radiation was too high and not to hold the phone against my head. I switched to using the speaker. Hackers increased the SAR radiation. I used to charge the phone by my bed. Hackers increased the SAR radiation during charging. I switched to charging the phone in the bathroom. Hackers substantially increased the SAR radiation. I moved charging the phone to the dining room which was the room furthest from my bedroom. Charging zaps me while I am in the kitchen or living room. 

After my Verizon plan expired last week. I switched to Pringer text message app. I am looking for a Skype app that does not require a google account to download.

I turn the phone on solely to text. Texting and charging the phone in another room zombie zaps me. My brain becomes more fatigued month after month. Brain cell death.

Other people using their cell phones and charging their cell phones do not effect me. When traveling, I book a bed in a hostel. My roommates using and charging their cell phones does not effect me. I do not have electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS). Likewise, I do not feel an effect being in crowded buses and trains full of smartphones that are on.

Last year, I had purchased an USB keyboard to use with a tablet I purchased. No OTG support though I had checked the specifications before purchasing and the specs included OTG. Today, I will go to my storage unit to retrieve the USB keyboard. I will take the keyboard to Best Buy to test tablets. I will use the tablet as a phone when not at home. Alternatively, I will buy a Skype wi-fi phone.

The past half year, I researched herbs that are radioprotective, cerebroprotective, protect against leaky brain and are neuroregenerative. Papers on the herbs are in the brain zapping treatments wikis in /r/electromagnetics.

I order herbs from a wholesale supplement company. Hackers deleted my shopping cart.

I try to take the herbal tinctures several times per day. I increased the dosage. The herbs are effective but no match for increased SAR.

I downloaded android alarm apps from f-droid.org and installed them on my unactivated smartphones. Hacked muted the alarms. I set up two alarms. Hackers hacked both of them.

AntiX MX linux is on my laptop. Its panel list of apps include an alarm. I set up the alarm. Hackers removed the alarm from the panel and from the panel list. The screen brightness setting was removed from settings preferences. Zombie zapping causes snow blindness (sensitivity to light). The brightest was too bright and hurt my eyes. Several days ago, hackers altered the brightness to the lowest. So dim, it is difficult to read the screen even with 100 watt rough ready incandescent light bulbs.

I booted up to the live AntiX MX DVD to reinstall the OS. As I reported two years ago, my computers do not finish booting to live DVDs. They boot to a shadow ISO. The live DVD booted to a tampered ISO that did not have an alarm in its panel list nor a screen brightness setting in its settings preferences. 

Hackers have actively interfered with alarms to notify me to take medicine. They jammed the radio station my radio alarm clock was set at. I replaced it. They jammed the replacement.

I purchased a digital radio alarm that also offered the option of buzzing as an alarm. The volume control is solely for the radio and not for the buzzing. I sleep through the buzzing as it is not loud enough. I had placed the alarm clock as far away from my bed as possible as electric alarm clocks emit considerable EMF. I moved the alarm clock to my nightstand. The buzzing still did not wake me up. I wish I had promptly returned the clock.

I purchased two battery operated alarm clocks with a loud buzzer. They can be set for only one time. I use them to wake me up in the morning. They did. I got up or tried to get up. When the zombie zapping is strong, my body won't move. I struggle to rock my lower body back and forth which will rock my upper body back and forth. Then I can upright my upper body. If I cannot rock back and forth, the persistent zombie zapping knocks me out.

To prevent me from rocking back and forth to arise, my lower spine or hips are zapped.  The lower spine zapping is excruciating painful. I can no longer earth with my dog in a park in the early morning.

Zombie zapping intensifies several hours before getting up. I have set the alarms at 4 am to wake up and get up before zombie zapping intensifies. Initially, this worked. Hackers intensified the zombie zapping earlier to circumvent the two alarms from waking me up. The zombie zapping lasts for hours causing me to over sleep. I will sleep 9 hours but wake up sleepier and more brain dead than before I went to sleep.

This is a heavy induced stupor. The battery alarms' buzzing is louder than the third radio alarm clock that had buzzed. The battery operated alarm clocks are so loud my roommate in the adjacent bedroom complained the alarms wake him up. I will buy battery alarm clocks to set for medicine.

I wish I could say that my cognitive impairment was temporary and I can always remember to take the herbs. But often I do not remember or I remember but delay taking the herbs because I am doing something and after finishing forget to take the herbs.

Other people using their cell phones and charging their cell phones do not effect me. When traveling, I book a bed in a hostel. I traveled again this week. My roommates using and charging their cell phones does not effect me. I do not have electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS). 

My symptoms from my activated smartphones and unactivated smartphones without destroying the Qualcom chip are mental fatigue, permanent cognitive decline, dizziness, lightheadedness, impaired problem solving and creative thinking.

There is not much research on electromagnetic fields inducing mental fatigue. I was glad to find this paper on brain fatigue and brain cell death.

I posted this paper to alert victims of smart phone hacking that the amount of SAR radiation emitted by their smart phones can also be hacked.

Those who are not being hacked, never ever place a smartphone on your ear. FCC regulations on radiofrequency were set with smartphones and laptops not touching the body.

Low neopterin could be interpreted as low biopterin. Parkinson's patients have lower biopterin and neopterin. Cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-2 , IL-6, EGF, TGF-α, TGF-β1) were found to be increased in the striatum and/or in cerebrospinal fluid.

My environmental medicine practitioner who agreed to order the neopterin test does not know how to treat neopterin deficiency. Though I do not have parkinson's, I will ask my neurologist to prescribe biopterin. I doubt he will. Biopterin isn't even a treatment for parkinsons. It should be. There is abundant recent research on biopter/neopterin, inflammatory biomarkers, radio wave sickness, etc. that doctors do not have the time to keep up with. 

It also seems doctors are reluctant to order tests medical insurance does not pay for. Are they concerned medical insurance will not pay for the doctor visits and treatment?

Combination of increased NOS activity (by kynurenines) with decreased formation of BH4 leads to the uncoupling of NOS with consequent shift of arginine metabolism from biosynthesis of NO to formation of superoxide anion and other free radicals, and exacerbation of depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment caused by kynurenines.

Polymorphism of IFNG (+874) T/A gene, that encodes production of IFNG protein, impacts the IDO and GTPCH activity that might be assessed in humans by KYN/TRY ratio and neopterin concentrations in biological fluids (e.g., blood, urine and spinal fluid). The hypothesis of IFNG inducible IDO/GTPCH inflammation cascade helps to understand the increased association between aging, inflammation and aging-associated psychiatric and medical (insulin resistance, obesity) disorders. Evaluation of markers of IFNG-inducible inflammation cascade might be used to assess the severity of corresponding behavioral and cognitive changes and the efficacy of pharmacological interventions (e.g., IDO inhibitors).""

Interferon-gamma and interferon-alpha (IFN-α) elevate IDO and quinolinic acid. 

**Interferon-gamma (IFN-y elevates IDO inducing anxiety**

""interferon-gamma (IFNG), transcriptionally induces the rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan (TRY) – kynurenine (KYN) pathway, indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase (IDO). Activation of IDO shunts TRY metabolism from production of serotonin (substrate of antidepressant effect) and its derivatives: N-acetylserotonin (an agonist to the receptors of brain derived neurotropic factor), and melatonin (regulator of sleep and other circadian rhythms), towards production of KYN and its derivatives (anxiogenic, neurotoxic and pro-oxidant factors)""

'Interferon-gamma – Inducible Inflammation: Contribution to Aging and Aging-Associated Psychiatric Disorders'

http://www.aginganddisease.org/CN/Y2011/V2/I6/474

**Interferon-alpha (IFN-a) elevates IDO and quinolinic acid**

""Even in patients with acute depression not induced by IFN-α, many studies show a specific increase of monocyte-derived cytokines (Il-1, Il-6, TNF-α) and abnormalities of lymphocytes and natural killer cells in the peripheral blood. These neuroinflammatory responses also show up in specific regions of the brain through increased density of microglial cells, which represent the mononuclear phagocyte system of the brain [30,31]. Corresponding with these findings Steiner et al. [30] reported an upregulated production of quinolinic acid by microglia in specific brain regions like the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior midcingulate cortex in postmortem brains of acutely depressed patients who had committed suicide. These results might support the immuno- and neurodegeneration hypotheses of depression [30,31].

Quinolinic acid can cause acute or chronic neuronal dysfunction through nine already known mechanisms. (a.) Quinolinic acid is an agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and activates the NMDA receptor in pathophysiological concentrations. The consequence is massive calcium entry into neurons. Neurons in the hippocampus, striatum and neocortex are especially sensitive to quinolinic acid, and these brain areas contain a particularly high number of NMDA receptors [32–35]. (b.) Quinolinic acid could cause disruption of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier [30]. (c.) Quinolinic acid can cause greater glutamate release by neurons and inhibits its reuptake by astrocytes. Excessive microenvironment glutamate concentrations cause neurotoxicity [36, 37]. (d.) A complex of quinolinic acid and iron transfers an electron to oxygen. Thus, reactive oxygen types are formed which mediate lipid peroxidation [38–43]. (e.) Quinolinic acid can potentiate the toxicity of other excitotoxins (e.g. glutamate, glycin and NMDA). The result is progressive mitochondrial dysfunction [44]. (f.) Quinolinic acid may impair autophagy [45]. (g.) Quinolinic acid may lead to cytoskeleton destabilization, causing intermediate filament hyperphosphorylation [46–48]. h.) Quinolinic acid is involved in the dysregulation of astroglial function and gliotoxicity [49, 50]. In addition Guillemin et al. [45] showed that quinolinic acid selectively induces apoptosis of human astrocytes. Astrocytes are known to produce neuroprotective kynurenic acid. As a consequence the apoptosis of astrocytes might lead to lower neuroprotective action against neurotoxic quinolinic acid [51, 52]. (i.) Finally, the neuronal nitric oxide synthase and the inducible nitric oxide synthase may be induced by quinolinic acid. As a consequence, free radical production and oxidative stress are the result of quinolinic acid-induced NOS activity in astrocytes [45, 51]..........Subsequently, our exploratory study results support the inflammatory hypothesis of depression.""

Internet addiction disorder  is not caused by hard wired ethernet. The exception is internet gaming addiction. People with internet gaming disorder would want to use ethernet for the fastest connection. Internet gaming disorder is distinctly different than internet addiction disorder.

Internet addiction disorder is caused by the adverse effects of wi-fi and cellular data. 

RF elevates opioids and alters neurotransmitters including norepinephrine which has been found to cause addiction and anxiety. EMF has been found to cause anxiety and depression. RF alters EEG. Research on internet addicts found they sustain anxiety and depression when not using the internet. Type of internet is not defined.

The neuroimaging findings in the above referenced internet study may be time dependent. Those spending more time using wi-fi or cellular data may have more severe symptoms.

Airplane mode does not turn off mobile phones' base station. Escheon requires mobile phones to remain trackable and remotely controllable. SAR from cellular transmission is emitted. Turning on wifi after turning on airplane mode exposes users and nearby occupants to SAR from cellular and wi-fi. Turning off data does not actually turn off Eshelon's data. Researchers need to consider this factor when studying wi-fi addiction. Wi-fi is not just wi-fi when the wi-fi device is a mobile phone or a 3G or 4G tablet.

I suspect majority of internet addicts do not use a computer with an ethernet cable. They use a mobile phone and/or tablet. By so doing, they unknowingly expose themselves **simultaneously** to wifi and cellular.

Surveys on internet addiction need to include the questions what is the source of the network (ethernet, wifi or cellular data) the addicts are using and are there wi-fi, mobile phones and smart meters using wifi at home, work and/or school. Smart meters use either wi-fi or broadband over power line.

What percentage of the population was addicted versus what percentage of the population owned a networked device or used a networked device at work?

In 1995, 14% of U.S. adults used the Internet; this had risen to 36% by 1998.

Pew Internet and American Life Project. Internet adoption, 1995-2012, Trend Data (Adults) 2012 Retrieved Feb 4, 2013, from http://www.pewinternet.org/Trend-Data-(Adults)/Internet-Adoption.aspx.

In the 1980's, companies purchased main frame computers for word processors to use. Very few secretaries and professionals had access to main frame computers.

In the 1980's, personal computers were very expensive. Few people purchased them for home use or high school. In the 1980's, only corporations could afford dial up.
 
In the 1990s, mainframe computers were replaced with smaller computers. The price of personal computers decreased but was affordable for only the upper class and upper middle class in europe and third world countries.  Laptops were expensive, too large and heavy for a backpack and lacked a preinstalled wi-fi card.

Statistics on wi-fi hotspots in the 1990s? Libraries had not yet offered wifi. Few coffeehouses and they lacked wi-fi.

No data for 2G phones. 

In the early 1990's, dial up became available to consumers. Dial up was the sole source of internet. Dial up is ethernet. In the 1990s, a small percentage of people had internet at home. 

When broadband was introduced, it was too expensive for majority of the world's population. Broadband remained expensive for some time. Internet cafes renting computers by the minute or hour became popular. They remained popular in europe even in the mid 2000's because computers, internet and cellular data were expensive.
People paying to use a computer and wired ethernet at an internet cafe could not afford to become an addict. Nor did wired ethernet cause addiction.

when evaluating the readings in each case: duration of exposure, exposure during the night or the day, multiple exposure to different EMF sources, additional exposure to noise, chemicals etc., patient’s individual regulation capacity status. Based on epidemiological studies (BioInitiative 2007, Kundi and Hutter 2009) and measurements relevant in practice (Standard of Building Biology Testing Methods, SBM 2008), the Austrian Medical Association ’s EMF Working Group has recommended preliminary benchmarks. 

Irrespective of the ICNIRP recommendations for acute effects, the following benchmarks apply to regular exposure of more than f
our hours per day. 

**High-frequency electromagnetic radiation (as power 
flow density)** 

≥1000 TW/m² (≥1 mW/m²)                       very far above normal 

10!1000 TW/m² (0.01!1 mW/m²)              far above normal 

1!10 TW/m² (0.001!0.01 mW/m²)            slightly above norma

≤1 TW/m² (≤0.001 mW/m²)                      within normal limits 

The benchmarks listed are intended to be applied to individual types of radiation, e.g. GSM, UMTS, WiMAX, TETRA, radio, TV, DECT or WLAN, and refer to peak levels. The benchmarks do 
not apply to radar, which must be evaluated separately. Highly critical types of radiation, such as periodic signals (mobile telephony, DECT, WLAN, digital broadcasting...), should be critically evaluated, especially if levels are far above normal, while less critical types, such as non!pulsed or non!periodic signals (USW, shortwave, medium and long wave, analogue broadcasting), may be considered more leniently. 

**Low-frequency alternating magnetic fields** 

≥400 nT (≥0.4 TT)                                         very far above normal 

100!400 nT (0.1!0.4 TT)                               far above normal 
10

20!100 nT (0.02!0.1 TT)                               slightly above normal 

≤20 nT (≤0.02 TT)                                         within normal limits 

The benchmarks are intended to be applied to the range up to and around 50 Hz; higher frequencies and distinct harmonics should be more critically evaluated. Mains current (50 Hz) and traction current (16.7 Hz) should be assessed separately. Long!term measurements should be carried out – also and especially during the night – if intense and frequent field variations occur over time; in such cases, evaluation should be based on the arithmetic mean over the period of exposure.
 
**Low-frequency alternating electric fields** 

≥10 V/m                                                       very far above normal 

1.5!10 V/m                                                   far above normal 

0.3!1.5 V/m                                                  slightly above normal 

≤0.3 V/m                                                      within normal limits 

The benchmarks (potential free measurement) are intended to be applied to the range up to and around 50 Hz; higher frequencies and distinct harmonics should be more critically evaluated.""

""EMF Exposure Guidelines in Canada are under the jurisdiction of Health Canada who has not independently established guidelines for magnetic field or electric field exposure. When pressed, they will state that Canada follows the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection “ICNIRP” guidelines of 830 mG or 83,000 nT (Magnetic Field) or 5000 V/m (Electric Field) for a 24-hr period. Since these guidelines are based on short-term acute exposure we still do not have guidelines that protect the public from long-term low level exposure, which is the case with the distribution of electricity. Associations based on epidemiological studies and cause-effect relationships which are in turn based on laboratory experiments suggest that exposure to magnetic fields and electric fields should be thousands of times lower. The same approximate levels and reasoning is used in the USA as well.""

Internet addiction did not in the 1990s as all internet was ethernet. Internet addiction did not exist prior to wifi cards being preinstalled in laptops (approximately 2002) and in smartphones (approximately in ?). 2G was extremely slow and timed out. 2G and 3G data were extremely expensive until recently and not used much. 

Internet addiction is not caused by hard wired ethernet. Internet addiction is caused by the adverse effects of wi-fi and cellular data. The neuroimaging findings in the above referenced internet study may be time dependent. Those spending more time using wi-fi or cellular data have more severe symptoms.

Airplane mode does not turn off mobile phones' base station. Escheon requires mobile phones to remain trackable and remotely controllable. SAR from cellular transmission is emitted. Turning on wifi after turning on airplane mode exposes users and nearby occupants to SAR from cellular and wi-fi. Turning off data does not actually turn off Eshelon's data. Researchers need to consider this factor when studying wi-fi addiction. Wi-fi is not just wi-fi when the wi-fi device is a mobile phone or a 3G or 4G tablet.

I suspect majority of internet addicts do not use a computer. They use a mobile phone and/or tablet. By so doing, they unknowingly expose themselves simultaneously to wifi and cellular.

Modding has been a revolving door of researching, submitting, preserving, restoring if possible, restoring again if possible, reresearching if cannot restore, resubmitting, represerving, etc.

We need to problem solve how to make back ups of posts, wikis and the wiki index and how to keep them safe from being deleted by hackers. We need volunteers. Until then, I will finish several posts I had started a draft on and then stop researching and posting.

I have been growing them off and on since. Last year, trial and error killed all but one baby. 

In 1995, people used a glass cookie jar or an one gallon ice tea jar to grow kombuchas in. Cookie jars are too wide to pick up comfortably, heavy when filled and need to be covered with cheese cloth to keep out insects attracted to sugar.

In 2013, I attended a party. A guest gave the host a kombucha in a quart canning jar. I asked how did he downsize the kombucha to fit in a quart jar. The guest explained the mother gives birth to babies that fit the dimensions of the jar. 

I placed my kombucha into a half gallon Ball canning jar. The mother gave birth to a baby the size of the dimension of the jar. I separated baby from mother. Mother gave birth to more babies. I gifted the mother to someone. Hence forth, I used wide mouth quart size and half gallon size Ball canning jars.

To keep insects out, I ordered steel screens designed for wide mouth canning jars for sprouting.  Much easier to use than cheese cloth. I kept the screens on while pouring the filtered tea out of the jar. Kombuchas turn brown upon contact with metal. My kombucha turned brown.

I purchased a set of plastic screens designed for wide mouth canning jars. The set has three different size holes. Insects laid eggs through the holes of even the smallest screen. Worms were crawling in my raw kefir jar. Worms crawled on the kombucha. The kombucha turned black and were dying. Waah! I saved two babies. One did not make it. Waah!

I resumed using steel screens for kefir and kombucha. The plastic screens are usable for sprouting truly raw almonds and peanuts.

Because it is winter and kombucha grow slowly in cold weather, it has been taking months to build up my kombucha farm to be able to drink enough kombucha tea.

Commercial kombucha tea companies use oolong tea. Oolong is in between a green tea and a black tea.  Oolong tea is sold at chinese markets.

White tea has the highest EGCG, followed by green tea.

Drinking green tea, but not white tea or lapsang soochung black tea, on an empty stomach makes me nauseous. My stomach tolerates drinking kombucha tea made from green tea.

I harvest the tea after it no longer tastes sugary sweet. I do not wait for kombucha tea to turn more acidic like vinegar.

I mix kombucha tea with raw pomegrante juice from a local farmers market. Today, I will be mixing kombucha tea with raw key lime juice. Hibiscus flower mix is delicious.

I pour it into recycled 16 ounce glass kombucha bottles. While shopping at health food stores, I liberate kombucha bottles from the stores' recycle bin. To sterilize, I boil the bottles and lids in a large pot of hot water. Find a bottle without a lid or lose a lid? Lids from small bottles of supplements are the identical size.

Insulated sleeves are designed to protect glass water bottles. Sleeves come in various sizes. The tallest size, 550 ml, is slightly too tall for an 16 ounce bottle. Cut an inch from the top of the sleeve. Alternatively, the second tallest size, 420 ml, would fit but is shorter than after cutting one inch from the tallest size:

Why drink kombucha? More energy than black tea. Kombucha protects from electromagnetic fields:

Connecting inflammation with glutamate agonism in suicidality
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671988/

""Increased levels of QUIN, which is also produced by macrophages and monocytes, have already been found in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of subjects with cytokine-induced depression or MDD [1,21,22]. Thus, our result of increased microglial QUIN expression in suicidal MDD patients is in line with the hypothesis of a systemic MPS activation during acute disease phases of depression [2-9,14]. Due to the excitotoxic properties of QUIN, our findings are also supporting the neurodegeneration hypothesis of depression [15]. Therefore, our study provides insight into why immune- and glutamate-modulating therapies may be helpful for acutely ill suicidal patients suffering from depression. Potential candidate drugs include the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline, which inhibits microglial activation by blocking NF-kappa B nuclear translocation [39-42] or anti-inflammatory inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 [43,44]. Furthermore, severely depressed suicidal patients may benefit from the administration of glutamate-modulating drugs, such as the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine [28,45,46].""

**EGCG in white tea and green tea**

When you supplement 5-HTP, you want to make sure it gets converted to 5-HT in your brain and not your periphery. The enzyme that converts 5-HTP to 5-HT is aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. It is found in your stomach and periphery, as well as your brain. This means that we have to inhibit it, so that your 5-HTP has time to pass your blood brain barrier. EGCG is an inhibitor of L-amino acid decarboxylase (Also known as DOPA decarboxylase). ALWAYS take EGCG with your 5-HTP to ensure that your brain is getting the serotonin, and not your periphery. Excess 5-HT in the periphery can cause heart valve damage.

This phosphorylation is mediated through Ak thymoma/protein kinase B and is necessary for antidepressant-like effects in model rodents [Beurel et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2014]. The combination of low (subeffective) dose NMDA receptor antagonists (including ketamine) and lithium also has synergistic antidepressant effects on the forced swim test in rodents [Ghasemi et al. 2010]. Finally, GSK-3 inhibition by lithium and a selective GSK-3 inhibitor (SB 216763) potentiates the antidepressant, synaptogenic and electrophysiological effects of subthreshold dose (1 mg/kg) ketamine, for example, mTOR activation, increased excitatory postsynaptic currents and dendritic spine morphogenesis [Liu et al. 2013].""

Thus, our result of increased microglial QUIN expression in suicidal MDD patients is in line with the hypothesis of a systemic MPS activation during acute disease phases of depression [2-9,14]. Due to the excitotoxic properties of QUIN, our findings are also supporting the neurodegeneration hypothesis of depression [15]. Therefore, our study provides insight into why immune- and glutamate-modulating therapies may be helpful for acutely ill suicidal patients suffering from depression. Potential candidate drugs include the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline, which inhibits microglial activation by blocking NF-kappa B nuclear translocation [39-42] or anti-inflammatory inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 [43,44]. Furthermore, severely depressed suicidal patients may benefit from the administration of glutamate-modulating drugs, such as the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine [28,45,46].""

""Lithium directly inhibits GSK-3 by binding to the magnesium-sensitive site of the enzyme,33,34 and indirectly inhibits GSK-3 by enhancing phosphorylation to specific serine residues. The first evidence that lithium indirectly inhibits GSK-3 came from studies noting its ability to act on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway and elevate phosphorylation of GSK-3α at Ser21.35 Lithium can also indirectly inhibit the GSK-3β isoform by phosphorylation at Ser9.36 It was further shown to increase GSK-3 serine phosphorylation by disrupting β-arrestin 2/protein phosphatase 2A/Akt complex formation, which dephosphorylates and inactivates Akt.37 Phosphorylation of GSK-3 by activating upstream Akt and protein kinases A or C (PKA, PKC) then can result in effects on diverse biological processes (for a review, see refs (15−19, 36, and 38−43)). Notably, GSK-3 can phosphorylate various nuclear factors such as Wnt/β-catenin and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (for a review, see refs (16 and 39)). In addition, lithium by inhibiting GSK-3 can also activate the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1) and cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB),44 as well as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway;45 for a review, see ref (17). GSK-3 also has the ability to promote self-activation through enhancing phosphatase activity which removes its own N-terminal inhibitory phosphate groups,46 as well as through stabilization of the Akt/βArr2/PP2A signaling complex which results in Akt dephosphorylation, as mentioned above.37,47 Lithium can block both of these mechanisms as part of its role in GSK-3 inhibition.48""

""...Lithium can also increase the activity of the antiapoptotic serine-threonine Akt-1 kinase and its upstream PI3K in primary cerebellar neurons.35 Cerebellar neurons cultured with serum respond with higher levels of phosphorylated/active Akt-1. The PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 blocked Akt-1 activity causing neuronal death, and this neuronal apoptosis was prevented by chronic lithium exposure. PI3K activity as well as Akt-1 phosphorylation and kinase activity were rapidly, but transiently, increased by lithium, thus reversing glutamate-induced loss of Akt-1 activity and cell viability.""

One of the often-ignored excitotoxins linked to the neurodegeneration of CTE is QUIN, a metabolic product of kynurenine metabolism. Kynurenine is a tryptophan metabolite that breaks down into kyurenic acid and picolinic acid, both of which are neuroprotective, as well as neurodestructive QUIN.[93] Activated microglia can secrete large amounts of QUIN, which acts on the NMDA receptor to initiate excitotoxicity.[101] Under conditions of brain inflammation, indolamine-2,3-deoxygenase (IDO) is upregulated and this shifts kynurenine metabolism toward QUIN generation, which is especially driven by INF-gamma.[183] Elevations in QUIN can increase the generation of hyperphosphorylated tau, as do other excitotoxins.[131,188] Excitotoxins can also increase APP processing, resulting in an increase deposition of A beta in traumatized brain.[105] It has also been shown that INF- strongly induces IDO in primed microglia surrounding amyloid plaque, thus increasing the generation of QUIN.[254] QUIN has been shown to induce IL-1ß, a key cytokine in AD pathogenesis.[90,233]

Because chronic inflammation appears to be involved in CTE, one must consider the effect of excitotoxicity caused by QUIN accumulation. The kynurenine pathway is activated in the AD brain and other neurodegenerative diseases, leading to an accumulation of QUIN.[91,94] QUIN can be produced by microglia, astrocytes, and macrophages and immunostaining studies have shown high levels of QUIN reactivity in the perimeter of senile plagues and NFTs.[91] Both low and high levels of QUIN can cause structural changes in neurons.[117] For example, chronic exposure of human neurons to QUIN even in concentrations of 100 nM can lead to dendrite beading, microtubule disruption, and a reduction in organelles.[117,253] In the AD brain, QUIN has been shown to accumulate in neurons, with high uptake in the entorhinal area and hippocampus.[91,92] It also co-localized with tau in cortical sections from AD patients. QUIN is found in significantly lower levels in the normal aging brain.

In vitro treatment of human fetal neurons with submicromolar concentrations of QUIN significantly increase Tau phosphorylation at multiple phosphorylation sites [Figure 10]. Rahman et al. demonstrated that QUIN causes a decrease in expression of serine/threonine protein phosphatases and this leads to tau hyperphosphorylation.[188] They also found that QUIN in concentrations of 500 nM and 1 200 nM significantly increased, not only total tau, but also tau phosphorylation at Tau-8 and Tau-180 epitopes. QUIN increased phosphorylation of serine 199/202 and threonine 231 in a dose-dependent manner. They also found that all concentrations of QUIN tested decreased phosphatase activity by approximately 30% and was not dose-dependent. QUIN also inhibits glutamate uptake and significantly inhibits glutamine synthetase activity in a dose-dependent manner, both of which enhance excitotoxicity.[227,233]
Figure 10
Figure 10
Elevated glutamate and subsequent excitotoxicity is essential to neurodegeneration induced by elevated proinflammatory cytokines. With chronic brain inflammation, tryptophan metabolism by the kynurenine pathway shifts toward quinolinic acid generation, ...

Glutamate and NMDA at equimolar concentrations (500 nM) also increased tau phosphorylation in a manner similar to QUIN. Various NMDA receptor blockers have been shown to selectively inhibit Tau phosphorylation (memantine, MK-801, and AP-5).[130,160] This suggest that QUIN-induced tau phosphorylation involves NMDA receptor activity.

Hyperphosphorylation of tau has been shown to disrupt and disassemble microtubules and lead to neurodegeneration and memory loss. It is known that several neuroinflammatory mediators can activate the kynurenine pathway, leading to production of QUIN by activated microglia and invading macrophages. Microglial activation is also known to occur early in models of tauopathies and immune suppression attenuates tau pathology.[259] The LPP 4-hydroxynonenal has been shown to prevent dephosphorylation of tau and promote tau crosslinking.[154] High levels of 4-HNE (4-hydroxynononeal) are generated by immunoexcitotoxicity.

There is growing evidence that AD, autism, and other dementing disorders involve connectivity problems secondary to white matter injury.[48,218] Although most pathological studies, both clinical and experimental, are concerned with severe TBI, some relate to minor injury. DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) studies have demonstrated occult white matter injury in cases of mild TBI (mTBI) not seen with typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning techniques.[109] Experimental studies have shown a progressive loss of axon integrity following TBI. For example, Rodriguez-Paez et al., using a moderate parasagittal fluid-percussion injury model, found chronic axonal changes accumulating as late as 6 months after injury.[195] They examined the fimbria, external capsule, thalamus, and cerebral cortex, ipsilateral to the injury, using electron microscopy (EM) and light microscopy and found a progressive loss of axons over time with significant macrophage/microglial infiltration as late as 6 months postinjury.
Diffuse Axonal Injury with Traumatic Brain Injury

Kraus et al. found, using DTI studies, that the white matter load index was strongly correlated with cognitive function.[121] Kumar et al. tracked serial changes in white matter using DTI scanning in moderate TBI and found that fractional anisotrophy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in the genu of the corpus callosum appear early and persisted at 6 months as a secondary injury with microgliosis.[123] Inglese et al. examined 46 patients with mTBI and 29 healthy volunteers utilizing MRI and DTI imagining and found significant abnormalities (FA) in the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and centrum semiovale and increases in MD in the corpus callosum and internal capsule.[109]""

One tablespoon of oil equals approximately 12 capsules. Buy liquid oil.

Piping Rock Health Products, Oakmont Labatories, Sweet Sunnah, Oleador and Amazing Herbs manufacture cold pressed black cumin seed oil to drink.

**Insulated sleeve to protect the glass bottle**

Store all types of oil in the refrigerator. Manufacturer should package oil in amber glass bottle to protect from oxidation by light.

Insulated sleeves designed to protect glass water bottles come in various sizes. The smallest size, 280 ml, is slightly too tall for an eight ounce bottle. Cut an inch from the top of the sleeve:

Misconduct by one out of thousands of licensed naturopaths does not discredit naturopathy. Disciplinary action was taken:

""From October 2013 to April 2014, a licensed naturopath in Tucson, Arizona, Michael Uzick, was using ukrain in his practice to treat cancer patients; he was given a letter of reprimand by the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board as he obtained the ukrain not from a manufacturer registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which was likely imported from abroad.[10]"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrain

I am surprised one naturopath in the United States prescribed ukrain. Ukrain is derived from the herb chelidonium majus. Lawfully, he could have prescribed the herb in the United States. The herb chelidonium majus is not a controlled substance.

Prescribing chelidonium majus is not quakery.

Proapoptotic activity of Ukrain is based on Chelidonium majus L. alkaloids and mediated via a mitochondrial death pathway

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1379651/

'In vitro and in vivo investigations on the antitumour activity of Chelidonium majus.'

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26626193

Many papers found ukrain to be effective. The most recent paper is 'Anticancer agent ukrain and bortezomib combination is synergistic in 4T1 breast cancer cells.'

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919744

""Yet, because Bastyr’s clinic generally gets patients with a limited range of minor problems, we could gain competency by giving oral presentations to other students on diseases we had not seen.""

There are five accredited naturopathic colleges in the United States: New Hampshire, Washington, Oregon, California and Arizona. They all have student clinics. The clinics do not see ""a limited range of minor problems.""

California and Arizona have recently licensed naturopaths. Their residents are unaware of naturopathy. The states do not educate their residents that naturopathy exists. Even in states that have long had licensing of naturopaths, majority of residents of Washington and Oregon do not know naturopathy exists.

The clinics tend to get patients who want holistic medicine and patients with major health conditions allopathic medicine has not been unable to cure are seen by the clinic.

Lack of medical insurance restricts low income patients from attending the clinics and purchasing medicine. Medicare does not reimburse naturopathic visits. Patients with medicaid have refused to ask medicaid whether naturopathy and medicine are covered.

Prior to treatment, auto insurance companies refuse to disclose their policy of paying naturopathic visits and medicine to treat injuries. Patients take the risk as they do not know. Insurance companies do indeed pay for naturopathic visits and medicine in states that license naturopaths.

""Instructors would commonly discuss a patient’s “vital force” as if this could magically be detected."" Vital force, also known as prana, chi and biophotons, is detected by biofield devices such as gas discharge visualization.  In 2015, I attended all three days of the Cancer Control Society convention and the Doctors Symposium. Diacom NLS Analysis and another machine detecting vital force were exhibited at a booth. www.diacom-nls.com. www.diacomsoft.com. 

The biofield wiki is at:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/43j6zu/wiki_biofield_measuring_body_emf_exposure_using/

""Frequently, patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms were diagnosed with dubious food allergies, chronic Lyme disease, adrenal fatigue, or yeast overgrowth."" Naturopaths diagnose by ordering lab tests. Insurance that pays naturopathic visits, pays for lab tests. Great Plains Lab organic acid test for candida. IGeneX Lab and Fry Lab for lyme and their coinfections. wwwigenex.com. http://frylabs.com. Timed cortisol test and DHEA test for adrenal fatigue. Naturopaths do not diagnosis by guessing.

""Patients would be prescribed an assortment of herbs and supplements, conveniently sold at the clinic’s dispensary, and handed a superbill for insurance reimbursement."" ""....old-timey practices""

This implies herbs and supplements are folk lore and not effective. There are thousands of papers on the effectiveness of herbs and supplements. I have submitted numerous posts linking to recent papers on herbs, supplement and diet treating many health conditions: parkinson's, alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, remyelination, candida, adrenal fatigue, cancer, blood brain barrier permeability, traumatic brain injury, blood retinal barrier permeability, insomnia, radio wave sickness, immune, neurotransmitters, etc.

Naturopaths, holistic doctors including environmental medicine physicians and chinese medicine practitioners prescribe herbs. President Nixon's trip to China introduced chinese medicine to the United States. Thanks to President Nixon, more states license chinese medicine practitioners than naturopaths. Had he visited India, ayurveda could have been introduced to the United States. Ayurveda practitioners are not licensed in the United States.

Herb stores are rare. Health food stores and pharmacies sell a small percentage of herbs. Of the herbs health food store sell, the majority is pills and tablets of dried herbs. Pharmacies do not sell herbal tinctures. Tinctures of fresh herbs are more potent than tinctures of dried herbs and much more potent than pills and tablets of dried herbs. Of the few herbal tinctures health food stores sell, few are fresh tinctures.

Naturopaths often prescribe a herbal remedy of various herbs. The medicinary at naturopathic clinics makes the remedy. Alternatively, patients could spend more money by special ordering individual tinctures of dried herbs at health food stores, wait for the order and blend the herbs themselves. Either way, medical insurance reimburses the cost of medicine if the insurance covers medicine and naturopathic care.

Edit: /u/lymphocyte deleted his reply. My reply is:

Germany was the first country to research alternative cancer therapies and establish clinics. Cancer clinics in Mexico were created due to persecution of doctors in the United States starting with Dr. Gerson and traveling to Mexico is less expensive than traveling to Germany. The Mexican clinic fees are comparable to German clinic fees.

The Cancer Control Society is based in Los Angeles. Their annual convention is in Los Angeles. I traveled to Los Angeles to attend the convention. The fee to charter a bus to Mexico departing from the convention is reasonable. A bus cannot be chartered to Germany.

Doctors from the Mexican clinics travel to the Cancer Control Society's convention every year. They lecture and have booths. It is not necessary to take the inexpensive chartered trip to Mexico to be introduced to therapies and specialized lab tests. The convention is international. Doctors and researchers from europe and Britain spoke.

Quick to get to Mexico even without a chartered bus. From Los Angeles light rail Metrolink train connects to a San Diego light rail Coaster train which connects to a trolley ending across the street from the border. Pharmacies are a block from the border. The pharmacies are a few of the stores in Mexico having english speaking employees. The pharmacies cater to Americans who commute to Mexico to purchase medicine. Medicine purchased in Mexico is less expensive than medicine purchased in United States and Germany. Michael Moore's documentary 'Sicko' features Americans traveling to Canada and Cuba to drugs because the prices are cheaper. Mexican pharmacies do not require a prescription for the same pharmaceutical drugs pharmacies in the United States are required to require a prescription for.

Medicine not licensed by the FDA may be lawfully purchased in foreign countries. Patients can lawfully pack their medicine in their suitcases and return to the United States. Ukrain was not discussed at the 2015 Cancer Control Society convention. I doubt Ukrain is prescribed or sold in Mexico and Germany.

Ionising radiation consists of highly energetic particles which can generate ROS. These ROS can either be generated primarily via radiolysis of water or they may be formed by secondary reactions. Extensive doses of ionizing radiation have been shown to have a mutating effect; for example, Sperati et al. [84] concluded that indoor radioactivity appears to affect the urinary excretion of 8-OHdG among females, who are estimated to exhibit a higher occupancy in the dwellings measured than males (Table 2). Many compounds have been demonstrated to protect against cell injury caused by radiation-induced ROS formation. One of these compounds is ebselen, a selenoorganic compound [85]. Another compound is N-acetylcysteine, which reduces nitrosative damage during radiotherapy [86] as well as oxidative damage [87]. The radioprotective effects of quercetin and the ethanolic extract of propolis in gamma-irradiated mice were also detected [88]. The radioprotective and radiosensitising activities of curcumin were demonstrated in a study by Jagetia [89].
Table 2
Table 2
Studies demonstrating increased oxidative stress/damage due to ionising and nonionising radiation exposure and the protective effects of antioxidants.

Aside from ionising radiation, nonionising radiation also causes oxidative stress. Magnetic fields can affect biological systems by increasing the release of free radicals. There are several studies that indicate a relationship between electromagnetic fields, ROS levels, and OS to exert toxic effects on living organisms [90]. Because it is unlikely that electromagnetic fields can induce DNA damage directly due to their low energy levels, most studies have examined their effects on the cell membrane, general and specific gene expression levels, and signal transduction pathways [91]. Musaev et al. [92] indicated that decimetric microwaves exert oxidant effects at a high intensity of irradiation (specific absorption rate of 15 mW/kg) and antioxidant effects at a low intensity (specific absorption rate of 5 mW/kg) (Table 2). The protective effects of melatonin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester against retinal oxidative stress during the long-term use of mobile phones were reported [93]. Jajte et al. [94] concluded that melatonin provides protection against DNA damage to rat lymphocytes. Another investigation revealed that Ginkgo biloba prevents mobile phone-induced oxidative stress [95]. Guney et al. [96] found that vitamins E and C reduce phone-induced endometrial damage.""

Noise is a disturbing and unwanted sound. Exposure to noise causes many health problems such as hearing loss, sleep disturbance, and impairs performance as well as effecting cognitive performance. It also increases aggression and reduces the processing of social cues seen as irrelevant to task performance, as well as leading to coronary heart disease, hypertension, higher blood pressure, increased mortality risk, serious psychological effects, headache, anxiety, and nausea ([230] and references within). Prolonged exposure to noise can also cause oxidative stress in the cochlea which results in the loss (via apoptotic pathways) of the outer hair cells of the organ of Corti. Increased noise exposure results in increased levels of reactive oxygen species formation that play a significant role in noise-induced hair cell death [231]. Acute as well as long-term exposure to noise can produce excessive free radicals alter endogenous antioxidative enzymes as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase [232, 233].

In a study by Demirel et al. [230] the effect of noise on oxidative stress parameters in rats was analyzed by measuring malondialdehyde, nitric oxide levels, and glutathione peroxidase activity. The results showed an elevation in MDA level, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, as well as NO level and GSH-Px activity through noise exposure, suggesting that the presence of oxidative stress may have led to various degrees of damages in the cells. Additionally, increases in oxidative stress parameters, such as MDA level, and decreases in CAT and SOD activities in textile workers exposed to elevated levels of noise supports the hypothesis that noise causes oxidative stress [234]. It seems that noise might cause damage not only in the ears but also across the entire body, leading to oxidative stress [230]. In a study by van Campen et al. [235], the time course of ROS damage following exposure was assessed. Based upon oxidative DNA damage present in the cochlea following intense noise, the researchers postulate that the first 8 h following exposure might be a critical period for antioxidant treatment. Thus, the ROS quenching properties of antioxidants and medicinal plants are attracting more and more research to counteract noise-induced oxidative stress. Manikandan and Devi [232] investigated the antioxidant property of alpha-asarone against noise stress induced changes in different regions of the rat brain and their data proved that the antioxidant property of alpha-asarone acts against noise stress induced damage. The aim of a study performed by Manikandan et al. [233] was to evaluate the protective effect of both ethyl acetate and methanolic extract of Acorus calamus against noise stress induced changes in the rat brain. Both the ethyl acetate and methanolic extract of Acorus calamus protected most of the changes in the rat brain induced by noise stress. N-acetyl-cysteine also offered protection against noise-induced hearing loss in the Sprague Dawley rat [236]. The study by Ewert et al. [237] determined if administration of a combination of antioxidants 2,4-disulfonyl α-phenyl tertiary butyl nitrone (HPN-07) and N-acetylcysteine could reduce both temporary and permanent hearing loss. The results showed that a combination of antioxidants HPN-07 and NAC can both enhance the temporary threshold shift recovery and prevent permanent threshold shift by reducing damage to the mechanical and neural components of the auditory system when administered shortly after blast exposure. Additionally, arboxy alkyl esters (esters of quinic acid found in fruits and vegetables) have been shown to improve DNA repair capacity of spiral ganglion neurons in response to noise stress [238].

The problem of oxidative stress in the production of hearing loss is even worse when the synergistic effects takes place since a broad range of environmental and occupational contaminants can interact with noise to enhance noise-induced hearing loss, for example, through carbon monoxide and by acrylonitrile [239].""

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4490422/

""6.8. Lithium Used for TBI Treatment

Neuroprotective in nature, and acting across multiple pathways, lithium serves as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of neurological deficits and damage, as well as neuronal protection and functional recovery after TBI [379]. Patients with TBI often suffer from depression, a disease found to reduce brain levels of BDNF [380,381], but lithium is able to increase BDNF levels in the brain [381,382,383,384]. Lithium increases nerve growth factor (NGF) in the rat frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and forebrain [382,383,385,386,387], as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), throttling an increase in the number of astrocytes, oligodendroglia, neurons, and decreasing the size of the lesion thereby improving functional outcomes [388,389,390]. Lithium prevents stress-induced reductions in VEGF levels, thereby stimulating neurogenesis and angiogenesis. In preclinical studies, both chronic [391,392] and short-term uses of lithium have been found to activate neurogenesis [393]. In addition, therapeutic levels of lithium stimulate proliferation of nestin-positive progenitor cells in brain neurons [394], as proliferation of adult hippocampal progenitor cells involving Wnt/beta-catenin activation occurred after GSK-3-beta-inhibition [395]. TNF-alpha directly disturbs BBB integrity, leading to secondary injuries including cerebral edema and leukocyte infiltration [396]. A study performed investigating the effects of etanercept and lithium chloride found decreased TNF-alpha activity with subsequent decrease in cerebral damage after administration of the therapeutic agents [396].

TBI often leads to not only acute injury but also long-term neurodegeneration, and is one of the major risk factors for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A strong indication of AD or neurodegeneration includes the presence of Beta amyloid (AB) peptide deposits, and these deposits increase after TBI in animal models and in patients with head trauma [396]. Because of lithium’s ability to inhibit GSK-3 activity, it can reduce beta amyloid peptide deposits [397]. In a study on an animal model of TBI, mice were treated with lithium after TBI and there was a reduction in beta amyloid load through B-secretase inhibition. BACE1 is the major B-secretase involved in production of beta amyloid in neurons [398], and BACE1 levels increase after TBI in both human and rat models [399,400,401]. The use of lithium after TBI blocked BACE1 expression, thereby reduced the AB load. This, in part, contributed to improved spatial learning and memory with increased hippocampal preservation as determined by improved neurobehavioral testing compared to TBI and sham groups [397].

Regulation of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition regulation is neuroprotective in nature through its ability to restore histone acetylation levels and correct transcriptional deficits in various models of brain disorders, specifically TBI rodent models [402,403,404,405]. A recent study in 2013 by Fengshan and colleagues indicated that the effects of combined subtherapeutic valproate (VPA)–another mood stabilizing drug–and lithium in a mouse model of TBI [406]. Both lithium and VPA maintain the BBB through inhibition of both HDAC and TBI-induced MMP-9 overexpression [407,408]. The combined treatment of sub-effective doses of both lithium and VPA significantly reduced lesion volume while preserving BBB integrity three days post TBI. This was not observed in the groups with lithium or VPA alone. However, lithium alone showed improvements in fine motor neurobehavior at days 14 and 21, while combined treatment had more profound effects with significantly fewer Fluoro-Jade B (FJB)–a dye used to label degenerating neurons-positive cells at days 7, 14, and 21 [406]. The advantage of subtherapeutic levels of both drugs causes less side effects, improves tolerance to long term use, and targets the different cell pathways involved in the complex pathophysiology of TBI [409].""",Electromagnetics,[J] [Brain Zapping: Treatment] [mTBI] Lithium Used for TBI Treatment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4373jt/j_brain_zapping_treatment_mtbi_lithium_used_for/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3j1s7b/rws_and_ehs_biomarker_series_s100b_protein/

ARUP does not have its own draw stations. ARUP contracts with local labs. My brain zapping decreased for two days prior to the test. While driving back from Labcorp, the brain zapping increased. Though my doctor's office wrote ARUP's test code on the lab order, Labcorp did not send my blood out. Labcorp noticing the word 'protein' in 'S100B protein', performed a protein test.

I complained to Labcorp's supervisor that the wrong test was performed. She told me Labcorp does not send out all ARUP tests to ARUP. S100B is a test they do not send out. Labcorp should have rejected the lab order.

I asked my doctor if he has an account at a local lab that sends out to ARUP. He did but I did not want to commute eight hours round trip just for a lab test. I waited two months to combine the lab test with another doctor visit with him.

I try to find out whether my medical insurance company will pay for a test before I have the test. My medical insurance would not pay for the test based on the initial ICD-10 diagnosis codes. My doctor's office sent more ICD-10 diagnosis codes. My insurance paid for the test.

Like the first time, my brain zapping decreased for several days prior to the second blood draw. I wish I could have the test without advance notice.

A day prior to the test, I stopped sleeping with brain shielding and stopped taking the leaky brain remedy.  I did not want the herbs to effect a biomarker. I deprived myself of tea and home made kombucha tea.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3xqtbd/brain_zapping_treatment_leaky_brain_herbal/

Two months after the test, while further researching S100B, I found a paper that indicated the COX-2 inhibitor herbs and NRF2 activator herbs would decrease S100B. 

[J] [Brain Zapping Biomarkers] [Nitric Oxide] [COX-2] Elevated glycine elevates S100B biomarker causing neuronal apoptosis (cell death), elevated nitric oxide, elevated COX-2, neuroinflammation, schizophrenia and paranoia. Do NRF2 activators and herbal COX-2 inhibitors decrease S100B?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/42frhr/j_brain_zapping_biomarkers_nitric_oxide_cox2/

Great the herbs are protective. Wise I temporarily stopped taking the herbs but had I read this paper before the test, I would have stopped taking the leaky brain remedy a week before the test.

My S100B level is 71 which is within range. Reference range is 0 - 96.
I was dumbfounded. At least I can prove to shills I do not have a biomarker for schizophrenia or paranoia. Elevated S100B is a biomarker for schizophrenia and paranoia.

There must be a more sensitive biomarker of brain zapping. Today, I found a paper that S100B by itself is not that sensitive of a biomarker. I submitted a post on it. The post was removed. Researching to find the identical paper will be time consuming. While searching for the first paper, I found an older paper:

""The combined use of serum S100B and apoA-I values maximizes classification accuracy for mTBI as well as the proportion of subjects that can be classified as either having or not having mTBI."" 

'Classification Accuracy of Serum Apo A-I and S100B for the Diagnosis of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Prediction of Abnormal Initial Head Computed Tomography Scan'

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4047844/

mTBI means mild traumatic brain injury.  ARUP lab is the only lab offering S100B. ARUP offers it as a single test, not in a panel. apoA-1 is an apolipoprotein. ARUP offers apoA-1.  CPT Code 82172

http://ltd.aruplab.com/Tests/Pub/0050030

I will print out the papers on apoA-1 and ARUP's test code to bring to my new neurologist. Will insurance pay for the test? How to interpret two separate tests as a panel?

Is a panel o biomarkers more sensitive than an individual biomarker?

""Unfavorable neurological outcome was associated with elevations in s100B, GFAP, and MCP-1. .....The multi-marker panel of TBI-related biomarkers performed well in discriminating unfavorable and favorable outcomes in the acute period after moderate-to-severe TBI. However, the combination of these biomarkers did not outperform s100B alone.""

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4443732/

Extremely strong brain zapping can cause mTBI and bTBI. Mild to moderate to strong brain zapping may cause chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).  Recently, the United States government has spent millions researching mTBI and bTBI to treat the military. The United States government has not funded research on CTE.  Athletes have been the popular patients sustaining CTE. How can the military not sustain some CTE injuries? Does the United States not research CTE because of fewer incidents, or CTE is milder than mTBI or because CTE is not being recognized even by the military as a brain injury? 

CTE was censored by the football industry:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/40j5cc/brain_zapping_cte_does_thousands_of_subconcussive/

As of yet, there is no ICD-10 diagnosis code for CTE:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/426p5h/brain_zapping_cte_chronic_traumatic/

Is there less incentive to research, order lab tests and diagnose a medical condition that has no ICD-10 diagnosis code? Follow the money. ICD-10 codes are required by medical insurance.

Does S100B detect chronic traumatic encephalopathy? What biomarkers do? What blood biomarkers other than quinolinic acid can detect CTE or the mildest repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)? 

EMF elevates quinolinic acid. My quinolinic acid ratio is high:

Power settings does not display percentage of battery life. Unplugging the power adapter from the dirty electricity filter immediately shuts down the netbook.

After rebooting, the screen brightness goes back up to maximum. I set the brightness back to medium. Last year, I reported this occurring my Toshiba laptops. Bright screens quickly deplete batteries. Though the batteries are not charging in my MSI netbooks, it appears that part of the power management hacking has not changed.

After shutting down my netbooks, they automatically turn back on. To keep them off, I unplug the power adapter.

Update:

I downloaded MX linux. Boot splash of the live DVD:

Battery-1: Unknown 0

Power setting indicates battery has 0 charge. MX cannot charge the battery. Switching batteries does not charge the other battery. A hacker changed the password of my badbiosvictim imgur account. I created a new imgur account with the username badbiosvictim1. Screenshot of power setting:

Today, I discovered the post had been removed from /r/badBIOS. I wish I had included it in the wiki. The app was Tawkon.

The warning occurred every time I placed my mobile phone next to my head. I uninstalled the app because I learned from it to always use a speaker and because it was running in the background depleting the battery.

Hackers remotely increased the SAR to zap my brain while I was using the speaker phone, surfing and typing on the phone's qwerty keyboard. Prior zombie zapping was pulsing during sleep. The frequently woke me up and gave me a headache.

Hackers remotely increased the SAR  (specific absorption rate) while charging. Charging turns phones on. Phones remain on while charging. Last month, I stopped charging my hacked activated Motorola Droid 4 and hacked unactivated Motorola Droid 4 phones in the bedroom and in my car. Mobile phones were charged in the bathroom. The bathroom is adjacent to my bedroom. My brain could feel the charging. I do not have electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS). I can be in a crowded room full of people with mobile phones and not feel brain zapping.

I use the unactivated phones as PDAs. Though they are not activated and do not have a SIM card, using them and charging them were zapping my brain.

I followed the teardown tutorial for Motorola Droid 3 phones on ifixit.com:

https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Motorola+Droid+3+Teardown/6108

I was going to drill out the Qualcomm chip with a drill but was concerned the tiny motherboard would get bricked. Method used was a large flat head screwdriver at a 90 degree angle and tapping the screwdriver with a hammer. The chip was chiseled off. Edit: Removing the Qualcomm chip on the front of the motherboard bricked the qwerty keyboard. I saved the T5 screws as no retailer sells them and discarded the phone.

I followed teardown tutorial for Motorola Droid 4 phones:

https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Motorola+Droid+4+Teardown/7759

Removing both Qualcomm chips bricked a phone. I should have removed one chip at a time and tested the phone. Just the larger Qualcomm chip was removed on the next Droid 4 phones. Access to the larger Qualcomm chip was easy by merely removing the battery with a torx T5 screwdriver. No need to remove the back frame and keyboard. 

The phone turned on. A charger could charge the battery. The larger Qualcomm chip was removed from two more phones. I wish I had tried to use the phones. The two unrooted phones stayed on for one minute. Rebooted. After one minute, rebooted again. They could not be charged as they continued to reboot.

Edit: My rooted Droid 4 with CM ROM would not boot and would not charge its battery. I unscrewed the batteries from my 3 unactivated phones and put them in my activated phone one at a time. My activated phone would not charge the batteries. The battery I removed from my activated phone would not boot up or charge the rooted phone. The unrooted phones continued to reboot every minute regardless what battery is in in them.  

I screwed my activated phone's battery back in my activated phone. My activated phone would not boot. A red Motorola icon appeared and then disappeared. I ordered a replacement battery and more replacement T5 screwdrivers. The hackers had stole my replacement T5 screwdrivers and last year my first screwdrivers.

I went for one and a half weeks without use of a phone. My brain improved though zombie zapping still occurred while sleeping! I screwed the replacement battery in my activated phone and charged it. The phone booted. 

I switched batteries. The new battery charged the unactivated rooted phone with CM ROM. My activated phone charged the battery from the unactivated phone. With the new battery, my two unrooted phones reboot every minute. In between reboots, I took screenshots of the home screen, apps using battery and apps running. There is a question mark inside the battery icon in the system tray on the home screen:

I can now safely resume charging the unactivated rooted phone in my bedroom and in my car using an inverter. When I use the phone I feel slight tingling and pins and needles. I do not feel pins and needles while using my air gapped Lenovo X200 laptop on battery power even when using an USB wifi adapter. Wifi is not safe but wifi is not causing the severe brain zapping.

The pins and needles is from the smaller Qualcomm chip. Removing the larger Qualcomm chip circumvented calling 911. The phones received error messages of no service. There is some cellular connection remaining and emitting EMF from the smaller Qualcomm chip.

I know my mobile phones connect to a stingray and that the stingray is increasing SAR emitted by my phones. Stingrays are the size of a briefcase but stronger than a cell tower:

""Stingrays emit a signal that is stronger than that of other cell towers in the vicinity in order to force devices to establish a connection with them. Stingrays don’t just pick up the IDs of targeted devices, however. Every phone within range will contact the system, revealing their ID.""

I have to charge the activated phone in the dining room which is the farthest room from my bedroom. When I am in the kitchen or living room, the charging zaps my brain. There is no outdoor outlet. I will buy a long extension cord to charge my activated phone in the back yard.

After charging, my hacked activated phone does not stay off. I store it inside an aluminum box inside a vintage 1980 steel child's lunch box I purchased at a yard sale next to the vintage car show I attended. Children's lunch boxes are now made of aluminum instead of steel.

The aluminum box did not shield. The aluminum box inside another aluminum box did not shield. The steel lunch box did not shield. I opened the lunch box to make a call to discover the fully recharged battery was depleted. An aluminum box box inside a steel box adequately shields. Possibly a heavy duty man's lunch box would suffice. I considered purchasing one but it is heavier and larger than a child's light weight steel lunch box.

The lunch box is too wide to store in my backpack. I keep it in my car so I can make a call when not at home.

I will resume researching good voice quality VoIP apps to make phone calls using the wifi on my unactivated phones. There are plenty of wifi hot spots on the road. I miss pay phones!

""Especially notable is the brain blood reperfusion observed in nearly 80 % of our cases after receiving the standard treatment.....

Cerebral hypoperfusion: All included patients showed brain hypoperfusion, mainly in the capsulo-thalamic area of one and/or of the two temporal lobes. The fermented papaya preparation normalized hypoperfusion in nearly 90 % of the cases. In one case where Ginko Biloba (Tanakan ®) revealed to be inefficient, the fermented papaya preparation proved to be effective. In another case, the reverse was observed. There might be therefore no cross-resistance between the two natural product preparation. This remains to be confirmed in a further clinical study.

Antioxidant defenses: The level of antioxidant defenses in the blood of EHS patients was carefully evaluated before and after treatment. Several patients expressed lower antioxidant defenses, as evidenced in particular by an increase in nitrotyrosine blood levels. Unexpectedly, the fermented papaya preparation did not correct the antioxidant defense deficiency. Research continues by testing the antioxidant effect of other products, such as L -carnosine, a dipeptide which seems to be associated with antioxidant and heavy metal detoxifying effects.

Vitamin D deficiency: A strong vitamin D2 - D3 deficiency has been observed before treatment in many patients. The fermented papaya preparation did not correct such a deficiency. The action mechanisms of the deficiency still remain unknown, since a lack of sun exposure is not an issue here.

Micronutrient and other vitamin deficiency: No vitamin deficiency other than vitamin D2 - D3 was observed. Only a zinc deficiency was observed, not corrected by fermented papaya; the mechanism of which is also unknown..ARTAC’s current research now focuses on zinc supplementation.

In summary, although fermented papaya appears to be an effective cerebral revasculator, therefore improving patient clinical condition (decrease in headache and cognitive impairment), when used alone it does not usually give a complete clinical response nor leads to a normalization of biological parameters such as antioxidant defense levels, vitamin D and zinc blood levels. This leads ARTAC and ECERI to study the effects of fermented papaya in combination with other products such as vitamin D, zinc and L-carnosine in the framework of a randomized comparative clinical trial testing this combination neuro therapy compared with our current standard EHS-MCS treatment protocol.""

miRNAs are small RNA (~22 nts) molecules that are expressed intrinsically and play an key role in regulating gene expression. miRNAs have proven to be important mediators of the massive molecular and cellular changes that occur in both short and long-term periods post TBI. In a study of rodent TBI models, deep sequencing identified eight upregulated and thirteen downregulated miRNAs at 24 h post-injury, whereas three were upregulated and thirteen downregulated at day 7 post-injury [16]. Microarray analyses in rat models of TBI revealed dynamic temporal regulation of miRNA expression within the cortex, with the numbers of downregulated and upregulated miRNAs peaking at 24 h and 72 h post-injury respectively [17,18]. In the mouse hippocampus, 50 miRNAs were decreased, whereas thirty-five miRNAs were increased after TBI [19]. Bioinformatic analysis of the predicted targets for validated miRNAs regulated by TBI (miR-107, -130a, -223, -292-5p, -433-3p, -451, -541, and -711) revealed an overrepresentation of proteins involved in several biological processes and functions initiated after injury, including signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, proliferation, and differentiation. Redell and colleagues further observed how miR-21 was upregulated in hippocampus, particularly in the dentate gyrus and CA3 region in a TBI model [20]. Expression of cell death protein 4 as a target of miR-21 decreased in these regions, denoting a potential survival mechanism mediated by miR-21in TBI-affected cells [21].

Mechanical force is one of important determinants in TBI, and Weber and colleagues proposed how mechanical shear stresses could modulate vascular homeostasis through microRNA regulation of target molecules, like phosphatase and tensin homologprotein (PTEN) [22]. They conducted a study on human endothelial cells subjected to unidirectional shear stress, and data showed 13 microRNAs with increased expressions; among them miR-21 was expressed the most. miR-21 targets phosphatase and PTEN. Further studies in human vascular endothelial cells exposed to shear stress or transfected with miR-21 showed downregulation of PTEN, whereas cells overexpressing miR-21 had decreased apoptosis, increased phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and nitric oxide production [22]. Together, they concluded shear stress could regulate microRNA expression in endothelial cells, thereby suggesting potential roles of microRNAs on mechanotransduction and injury response [23]. In addition Redell and colleagues [24], firstly reported plasma miRNA levels altered in TBI patients compared to age-, gender-, and race-matched healthy volunteers. Based on quantitative analysis of RT-PCR data, they suggested that plasma miR-16, miR-92a, and miR-765 be used as early circulating markers which will be discussed more detail in the subsequent section.""

""3.1. miRNAs as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers

As discussed above, miRNAs expression pattern altered significantly in response to TBI, and miRNAs play key roles in signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, mechanotransduction, proliferation, and differentiation initiated by TBI. These altered miRNAs thus seem to be good candidate biomarkers for TBI. Redell and colleagues compared the plasma miRNA profiles between severe TBI patients (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8) and healthy volunteers. They concluded that decreases in the levels of miR-16 and miR-92a, and increased levels of miR-765, were good markers of severe TBI at 25–48 h after injury [27]. A simplified technique for miRNA measurement in biofluids could provide rapid diagnosis and allow for efficient treatment decisions [28].

Studies of CSF from TBI rats found a significant increase in levels of miR-let-7i as early as 3 h post-injury [29]. Prediction analysis revealed that miR-let-7i targets S100B and UCH-L1 which are TBI-related proteins, suggesting a possible role for miR-let-7i in regulating TBI pathology [30]. Three other miRNAs—miR-16, miR-92a, and miR-765 have been identified to serve as diagnostic biomarkers for severe brain injury in TBI patients. Plasma levels of miR-16 and miR-92a are also increased notably in patients with mild TBI [24]. These studies highlighted how the miRNA-based biomarkers in the serum and CSF could serve as promising diagnostic tools in TBI [18].

In addition, miRNA levels also change following TBI treatment, suggesting the use of miRNA as a prognostic biomarker. As will be discussed in the treatment section, hypothermia is one of the most promising treatments for TBI due to its ability to attenuate prolonged neurological deficits and improve functional outcomes [31,32,33]. Interestingly, some miRNAs that show altered expression after TBI are also sensitive to temperature change. In a rat fluid-percussion model of TBI, the levels of many upregulated miRNAs after TBI decreased under hypothermic conditions [34]. Among the miRNAs, miR-9 is predicted to reduce expression of proteins known to interact with actin-binding proteins and basal plasma membranes, indicating that an increase in miR-9 levels after TBI would disrupt cytoskeleton and cell-adhesion properties, thereby increasing cell death. Therefore, decreased expression of miR-9 may enhanced cell survival and help in explaining the treatment efficacy of hypothermia therapy [18].""

""Conclusion. According to the information that has been reviewed, the mechanisms by which QUIN produces neurotoxicity include overactivation of the NMDA receptor, energy deficit, oxidative stress, and cell death. A sequence of these events is described in Figure 2. Far from being excluding, all these factors are somehow closely related and also act synergistically to induce neurodegeneration. Taking into account that QUIN has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and some of their toxic mechanisms are still unknown, the challenges for the future research should be directed to clarify all the possible routes that can promote or contribute to the damage induced by this metabolite. This may help to explain the physiopathological events occurring in several neurodegenerative diseases in which the levels of QUIN are increased.""

Quinolinic acid is an excitotoxic stimulant of certain brain cells that have NMDA-type receptors. Over stimulated nerve cells may die. Brain toxicity due to quinolinic acid has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, autism, Huntington’s disease, stroke, dementia of old age, depression, HIV-associated dementia, and schizophrenia.

How to write a report on meters measurements to ascertain whether one has RSW or EHS

Take measurements using different meters of total body burden at home, work and vehicle. EHS is total body burden lower than your government safety standard. RWS is total body burden higher than your government safety standards. Governments' standards vary from country to country, state to state. See government safety standards.

S100B is a 10 kDa calcium-binding protein produced by astroglia, oligodendroglia, and choroid plexus ependymal cells [196]. It mediates its effects on the surrounding neurons and glia via the receptor for advanced glycation end-product [196]. Nanomolar extracellular S100B levels provide beneficial neurotrophic effects, limit stress-related neuronal injury, inhibit microglial TNF-α release, and increase astroglial glutamate reuptake [196]. Micromolar S100B concentrations, predominantly produced by activated astroglia and lymphocytes [196,197], have harmful effects transduced by receptor for advanced glycation end product that include neuronal apoptosis, production of COX-2/PGE-2, IL-1β and inducible nitric oxide species, and upregulation of monocytic/microglial TNF-α secretion [21,196,198].

Serum and, particularly, CSF and brain tissue S100B levels are indicators of glial (predominantly astroglial) activation [199]. In MDD and psychosis, serum S100B levels positively correlate with the severity of suicidality, independent of psychiatric diagnosis [200]. Post-mortem analysis of S100B showed decreased levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of MDD and BPD, and increased levels in the parietal cortex of BPD [196].

Meta-analysis (193 mood disorder, 132 healthy controls) confirmed elevated serum and CSF S100B levels in mood disorders, particularly during acute depressive episodes and mania [201].

In schizophrenia, brain, CSF and serum S100B levels are elevated [199,202]. Meta-analysis (12 studies, 380 schizophrenia, 358 healthy controls) confirmed elevated serum S100B levels in schizophrenia [203]. In post-mortem brains of schizophrenia subjects, S100B-immunoreactive astroglia are found in areas implicated in schizophrenia, including anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampi [154]. Elevated S100B levels correlate with paranoid [154] and negativistic psychosis [204], impaired cognition, poor therapeutic response and duration of illness [202]. Genetic polymorphisms in S100B [32] and receptor for advanced glycation end-product genes in schizophrenia cohorts (Table 2) [32,33,205] suggest these abnormalities are likely primary/pathogenic rather than secondary/biomarkers. Indeed, the decrease in serum S100B levels following treatment with antidepressants [201] and antipsychotics [196] suggests some clinical relevance of S100B to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.""

Today, environmental medicine practitioner #2 discussed the results of my Acylcarnitine test by Quest Diagnostics. He looked at the first component on the test which is acetylcarnitine, C2 and told me my test was negative. My level was 4.91. Reference range is 4.04 to 12.19. 

As always, I request a copy of my labs. After I left the office, I read the entire test results. My isovaleryl-2/-methylbut C5 was high. My level was .34. Reference range is below .30.

There is no interpretation on the test. On Quest Diagnostics' website, there is:

ISOVALERYL/2-METHYLBUT, C5
30531-8 is an abbreviation for Isovalerylcarnitine+Methylbutyrylcarnitine (C5)

""Clinical Significance. Elevation of one or more acylcarnitines is diagnostic for an organic aciduria or a fatty disorder.""

I may have glutaric aciduria type 2. I definitely do not have type 1. I suspect my carnitine deficiency was acquired in my life time from EMF and ultrasound and is not genetic.  EMF affects the immune system. Carnitine becomes deficient protecting the immune system:

Ultrasound hearing and microwave auditory effect can cause tinnitis. Carnitine treats tinnitis.

Carnitine protects dopamine. Thereby, carnitine helps prevent parkinson's disease. See carnitine wiki. I have low dopamine. My father and my father's mother died from parkinson's disease. EMF and dirty electricity deplete dopamine. EMF can deplete carnitine and glutathione. My hypothesis is EMF and dirty electricity can cause parkinson's.

A further sensitive site of action in synthesis to the cofactor BH4 concerns the function of the dihydropteridin-reductase, which recycles qBH2 to BH4.

Consequently, agents that lower nitric oxide synthase activity, like anesthetic agents, are quite effective in mitigating excessive EMF exposure risks.....Have a look at Brain Gut 9 again and see how we linked fake light, EMF and the gut flora together...

Superoxide (O2·−) reacts avidly with vascular NO· to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). The cofactor tetrahydro-L-biopterin (BH4) is highly sensitive to oxidation by ONOO−. Tetrahydrobiopterin is a naturally occurring essential cofactor of the three aromatic amino acid hydroxylase enzymes, used in the degradation of amino acid phenylalanine and in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), melatonin, dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), and is a cofactor for the production of nitric oxide (NO) by the nitric oxide synthetase. This ties it to most of the neurotransmitters involved in feeding and in circadian signaling as I laid out in Brain gut 11. It also directly links food to abnormal prolactin signaling, too.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases represent major sources of this reactive oxygen species. NADPH oxidase generates superoxide by transferring electrons from NADPH inside the cell across the membrane and coupling these to molecular oxygen to produce superoxide anion, a reactive free-radical. Superoxide can be produced in phagosomes, which contain ingested bacteria and fungi, or it can be produced outside of the cell. In a phagosome, superoxide can spontaneously form hydrogen peroxide that will undergo further reactions to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide kills bacteria and fungi by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood, (but we know it kills them) but may inactivate critical metabolic enzymes, initiate lipid peroxidation, and liberates redox-active iron, which allows the generation of indiscriminate oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical. Superoxide anion is particularly important as the product of the one-electron reduction of dioxygen O2, which occurs widely in nature. Both dioxygen and superoxide ion are free radicals that exhibit paramagnetism.

Key Point: The generation of superoxide requires NADPH and thus ties the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) to this reducing co-factor to mitigate the risks of EMF. This means that a high fat diet is the preferred diet to mitigate an excessive man made EMF risk to biology. This means that what we have believed to constitute a healthy diet can no longer be true in an altered field. It implies that most of the nutrition research is null and void because it never controls for an altered field effect. I laid these foundations out in the EMF 4 and Quantum Biology 8 blog; the current of flow of electrons becomes massively important to increasing energy generation for life to survive. This sounds very similar to what a star faces as it is dying, doesn’t it? Quantum physics describes what happens in the macrocosm and microcsm congruently because both must follow the laws of nature. Our beliefs do not allows us to side step this relationship.

Geeks and Non-Geeks: Diminished levels of BH4 promote elevations of superoxide. Glucose metabolism also happens to lower BH4 and NADPH levels extremely quickly. Chemical agents that raise superoxide dismutases (SODs), the enzymes that degrade superoxide) such as phenolics and other Nrf2 activators that induce SOD activity, as well as calcium channel blockers may be useful in mitigating EMF risks in an altered field. The NRF2 pathway regulates the production of important molecules that impart antioxidant activity, such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD). It also regulates the production of phase 2 detoxification enzymes in the liver, including glutathione S-transferase, and down regulates signaling factors such as NF-kappaBeta for a healthy response to inflammation. Many chemically diverse NRF2 activators have already been identified in foods, including the glutathione peroxidase-1 mimetic ebselen, sulforaphane found in cruciferous vegetables, caffeic acid phenethylester from the bee product propolis, cinnamic aldehyde (found in cinnamon bark). It seems the scientific literature is just ignoring what is becoming substantial scientific data. The facts are known, but no one is connecting these dots to excessive EMF!

These cellular effects eventually all lead to calcium efflux from the cell and this ultimately alters transmembrane resting potential. This is where the environment meets the life within the cell. It is the battle line of where epigenetics occurs. All of these thing affect the ability of water to properly electrically charge RNA and DNA, and thus, alter genetic expression. This is what is causing all neolithic disease generation, in my opinion.""

**Melatonin and Vitamin D**

It is best to take the cofactors to make your own melatonin and remove what interferes with melatonin production. Do not take melatonin unless a timed melatonin test found melatonin deficiency or your health practitioner prescribed melatonin. If you are taking melatonin, take 2 to 3 hours before bedtime.

'Melatonin: Not a Magic Bullet for Sleep'

http://huffpost.com/us/entry/820426

Melatonin cofactors:

""One also needs to be aware of the precursors of melatonin, as if these are deficient then this will lead to low melatonin levels. Serotonin is a precursor to melatonin. As a result, if someone has depressed levels of this neurotransmitter, then they are likely to have low melatonin. So if someone has low melatonin levels, this very well might be due to low serotonin levels. But why would someone have low serotonin levels? Well, you also need to consider the precursors of serotonin. This includes the amino acid tryptophan, but also requires certain nutrients such as iron, magnesium, folic acid, and vitamin B12. If someone has one or more of these nutrient deficiencies, this in turn can cause low serotonin, which in turn can lead to low melatonin.

So let’s look at an example of someone who has difficulty sleeping, and for a different reason they obtain an iron panel which shows a low ferritin and iron saturation. They might not link the iron deficiency to the low melatonin levels, and thus the problems with sleep, but the low iron levels might be responsible for the decreased production of melatonin. Similarly, if someone is deficient in magnesium this can also be the culprit, and is a reason why sometimes taking magnesium at night will help someone to sleep better. On the other hand, if someone has sufficient levels of magnesium but has a methylation problem which is causing a folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiency, then in this situation taking magnesium probably won’t help with the sleep, but having the person supplement with natural folate and/or vitamin B12 while addressing the methylation issue would be warranted.

Speaking of methylation, when serotonin is converted to melatonin, methyl donors are required for this conversion process as well. As a result, if someone has low melatonin levels due to problems with methylation, while taking melatonin might help, it’s also important to focus on the methylation problem. Keep in mind that I’m not opposed to people taking melatonin, as there are times when I will recommend melatonin supplementation to my patients. But at the same time it’s also important to figure out why someone has low melatonin levels.""

""When you expose your skin to sunshine, your skin synthesizes vitamin D3 sulfate. This form of vitamin D is water soluble, unlike oral vitamin D3 supplements, which is unsulfated. The water soluble form can travel freely in your blood stream, whereas the unsulfated form needs LDL (the so-called ""bad"" cholesterol) as a vehicle of transport.

Her suspicion is that the simple oral non-sulfated form of vitamin D likely will not provide the same benefits as the vitamin D created in your skin from sun exposure, because it cannot be converted to vitamin D sulfate. This is yet another reason to really make a concerted effort to get ALL your vitamin D requirements from exposure to sunshine!""

""This protocol is still being developed and is not fully defined. Theye have only been using this tretament for a couple of years This takes time and the process is slow. It took years for some ou, it may take time to reverse. This is the repert she did at the DAn conferance

Dr Usman presented her Biofilm theory at the last DAN conference. Basically she believes that there are viruses and bacteria which are encased in the gut of our kids that regular anti fungals and meds cannot get to becasue of the biofilm that surrounds them, so you have to use EDTA to break down the biofilm which protects them and then kill them off with anti fungals or antibiotics.

""True Health Medical Center:

""Potential Implication of Biofilm Formation in Patients with ASD"", Presented to the Defeat Autism Now Think Tank, Oct. 11, 2007

I presented a theory about the implications of biofilm production by resistant strains of bacteria/fungus in our ASD patients who have persistent dysbiosis. The literature search that I conducted with the help of Teresa Conrick , MS and Sonja Hintz , RN was quite convincing. The abnormal production of biofilm by resistant strains of microorganisms may be a possible etiology of why many of our patients who do not have positive stool cultures for yeast or pathogenic bacteria do well when placed on antifungals and antibiotics, yet relapse when they stop. The biofilm produced by these resistant organisms can only be seen by electron microscopy and makes it difficult to culture these bugs. This theory might also explain subtypes of our ASD subpopulation who have abnormal behaviors, such as head banging or agitation, that seem to be gut pain related, yet again have negative studies. The third subset that this seems relevant for is the group of children that have recurrent strep infections, OCD, perseverative, or repetitive behaviors who get worse in the spring and fall, yet may not test positive for strep.

Why do so many of our ASD kids have persistent dysbiosis? This is my theory. We all know that the quality of our air, water and food is not ideal and contains numerous toxins and pollutants. Our children have a genetic susceptibility in their ability to handle this toxic burden. Research shows us that resistant organisms tend to grow in toxic, hostile environments, and after numerous rounds of antibiotics. They maintain their viability by producing a polysaccharide matrix that protects them from the hostile environment in which they are trying to survive. This extracellular matrix is called biofilm. Our normal flora also produce a natural biofilm, but resistant organisms produce their own biofilm which then takes over, preventing the normal flora from flourishing. Experiments done in vitro show that this polysaccharide matrix is negatively charged, and that it is held together by positively charged ions such as Ca, Mg, and Fe. Iron seems to play a big role in how these bacteria evade the immune system. Further work on VRSA/MRSA and pseudomonas biofilms in vitro indicate that this biofilm may be penetrated by using a combination of EDTA and an antibiotic; the studies used Vancomycin for Staph and Gentamicin for Pseudomonas.

The protocol that my staff and I developed was presented in its infancy at the October 2007 Think Tank. The Defeat Autism Now Think Tank is usually a forum where ideas are presented for discussion and further research. This protocol was not discussed in great detail (15 minutes was allotted for this discussion), and it was not meant for wide distribution at this time. However, Dr. Bradstreet presented it in his talk on New Advancements and clinicians and patients from all over the world are now asking for our protocol.
However, let me start with a few caveats. First of all, this is brand new. We have used this approach on about 60 patients. The first two were Teresa 's and Sonja 's children - one with ASD/self injurious behavior and one with colitis, no ASD. Both initial patients are doing well. However, this treatment has to be individualized for each patient's unique constitution and ability to handle both die-off and detox type reactions. From our other patients we are seeing a variety of responses from decreased hyperactivity and stimming, to increased agitation, to no response. Of course we may have a few bumps along our journey to recovery. The big bumps with this approach are related to awakening the immune system to these organisms which it has not been recognizing. The body finally sees the bacteria or the candida that has been there creating other types of havoc all along. Acutely, patients may experience vomiting, diarrhea, high temps. Rashes may appear, especially if the die off is sudden. The other theoretical issue is that the biofilm may be holding on to toxic metals such as aluminum and lead. As this toxic biofilm degrades heavy metals may be released into the gastrointestinal tract for excretion. Our protocol was developed to address this possibility.

I urge all of you to have patience and wait for us to gather more data on this approach so that you are presented with the safest, most effective protocol. Remember, your doctor should implement this approach gradually with the unique needs of your child in mind. Because of the possibility for negative side effects, and the need to closely monitor the patients, and the possible use of pharmaceuticals, this treatment plan should be implemented only with the help of your physician.

This is what Dr Usman wrote...

'True Health Gut Biofilm Protocol™'

Step One: Lysis and Detachment of the Polysaccharide Matrix (empty stomach, 30-60 min prior to Step 2) -Use of specific enzymes. (these are being refined and developed, as the enzymes we have available at this moment are not ideal) -Use of a chelator that can grab hold of minerals in the Matrix. (if not implemented appropriately this may cause mineral depletion in the body - do not attempt chelation without proper medical supervision)

Step Two: Target the Microbe - Consider using antibiotics, herbals, or homeopathics. (our office has had extensive experience with all three modalities, and have found that the choice ""depends upon the kid"". We are also researching a fourth modality that looks quite promising for eradicating these pesty organisms.

Step Three: Clean Up (This is the most crucial of all the steps. DO NOT SKIP!!! Give 1-2 hrs after Step 2 if possible or at night) -Here we use anything that can bind up the matrix (mucus), by products of die off, and potential metals in the gut. Products include activated charcoal, alginate, clays, algaes, zeolites,.... we like pectin the best. Sometimes we use all of the above.

Other important factors -Probiotics, of course. -Anti-inflammatory agents such as EFA's, antioxidants, curcumin... -Natural fermented foods such as kefir, kombucha... -Healthful, non toxic foods (hormone- free, antibiotic-free, organic)

This is a short-term treatment plan, we are using it for about 2-3 months.""

'Many children on the autism spectrum have an overgrowth of certain Clostridia species, which produces a compound called HPHPA (3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)- 3-hydroxypropionic acid).[2] HPHPA may disrupt dopamine metabolism by interfering with the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase. HPHPA is a potent toxin with profound neurological effects in autism...""

I have cognitive decline.

**My brain is still being zombie zapped via ultrasound and EMF**

Update: While I slept the morning of Friday, December 18, zombie zapping was Increased. I slept through two alarms. I woke up with a swollen head, eyes and sinuses, headache, stiff neck.  Previously, the perps also zapped my lower spine causing excruciating pain and difficulty arising. Now they switched from zapping lower spine to zapping my stomach. Feels like my stomach and head have been punched thousands of times while I slept. 

The zapping did not decrease after arising. Twice, I vomited tea. I cannot eat or take medicine in the form of capsules and pills. I have the chills and crave soaking in a hot epsom salts bath.  I had hoped the zombie and spine zapping would decrease after the perps learned of the greater extent that are causing injury. Just the opposite. Retaliation for posting. Exacerbated leaky gut causing exacerbated leaky brain and cognitive decline.

Update: Day after Christmas. A week later and I still have a stomach cramp.  The last several days, turning my head in bed or arising makes me dizzy. Each day, I am getting dizzier.

Update:  More than a month later, my stomach ache persists. I reduced the number of pills of supplements I take and nuts I eat due to impaired digestion. Not being able to take all my supplements has been one cause of my declining health.",badBIOS,"Part 4.

Anti-mold strategies: fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, rizols, MMS and propolis vaporizer.

Rizol Gamma: treats most parasites, all mold and yeasts, Bartonella, Ehrlichia and most Borrelia species: up to 20 drops t.i.d.

What is a rizol? Rizols are ozonated plant oils. The ozonides transfer oxygen and change the environment in which anaerobic pathogenic germs live, making it aerobic. This prevents anaerobic germs, such as Clostridia, from multiplying. The oil is surface-active and, with its active substances, moistens the intestinal mucous membrane where nests of fungi and bacteria and parasites might be located.
 
Freeze dried garlic: allicin is effective against Borrelia, Bartonella, HHV-6, mold. The many sulfur compounds detoxify mercury and many environmental toxins dissolve in water – up to 3 caps q.i.d.
 
Acidified sodium chlorite (MMS) is very effective for Babesia, mold, viruses and many other microbes. (More information on MMS is in comment below.)

**Component 2: remove biotoxins and biofilm**

Gut biofilm and persistent toxins in bowel wall: Clay: ½-1 tsp b.i.d for 4-6 weeks always with large amount non-psyllium fiber product or large dose chlorella. Follow with Dr Usman’s biofilm protocol.
 
Chlorella: 20 tbl 10 min after rizoles or MMS and 30 min before meals

Biotoxins respond to the same elimination agents as other toxins do!

Cilantro: up to 15 drops t.i.d. in hot water

Nanonized chlorella: Matrix Metals (BioPure): 2 sprays into nostrils 1-2 times per day

Get melatonin levels up. Sleep in the dark, turn off the fuses. Turquoise
light 1 hr after sunset

Other options: nanonized chitosan, apple pectin (grated apple, wait till
light brown), reed grass from Russia
 
Lymph drainage massage, body-vibration, conventional detox agents (DMSA, DMPS, EDTA, Penicillamine, i.v. Vit C/glutathione/NAC etc.)""

L-lysine has been shown to inhibit the production of nitric oxide (while L-arginine stimulates it) via the enzyme nitric oxidase, taking this supplement or eating food high in it might very well be helpful in alleviating symptoms of ES, EHS, MCS

My amino acids test by Genova found I was deficient in lysine.

**Vitamin C**

EMF depletes vitamin C. See vitamin wiki.

My vitamin and mineral blood test by SpectraCell found normal level of vitamin C. Therefore, I did not supplement with vitamin C. My organic acids test by Great Plains found vitamin C deficiency.  Reference range is 10 - 200. My level is 0.72.  An organic acids test is more accurate than a blood test.

**Acetyl-L-carnitine is better absorbed than L-carnitine**

""Bioavailability of L-carnitine from oral supplements (0.5-6 gram dosage) ranges from 14%-18% of the total dose (5). Less is known regarding the metabolism of the acetylated form of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR); however, bioavailability of ALCAR is thought to be higher than L-carnitine. The results of in vitro experiments suggest that ALCAR is partially hydrolyzed upon intestinal absorption (10). In humans, administration of 2 grams of ALCAR per day for 50 days increased plasma ALCAR levels by 43%, suggesting that some acetyl-L-carnitine is absorbed without hydrolysis or that L-carnitine is reacetylated in the enterocyte (5).""

Carlson Labs, NOW and Vital Nutrients manufacture acetyl-L-carnitine powder.

RBC Glutathione

""GSH levels are thousands of times higher in cells than in plasma. Plasma GSH represents primarily that synthesized and exported from the liver. Reduced GSH (rGSH) is the active form of the tripeptide and the ratio of rGSH: oxidized GSH (GSSH) is normally about 9:1. Once a blood sample is obtained, erythrocyte rGSH is very susceptible to oxidation and the rGSH:GSSH ratio drops rapidly. Specimen handling to prevent the ex vivo oxidation of rGSH is impractical, and direct measurement of rGSH in vivo is not feasible outside of a research setting. However, research clearly indicates that undesirable ratios of rGSH:GSSH are equally associated with abnormally low levels of total cellular GSH. Therefore, it is clinically meaningful to assess the level of total erythrocyte GSH as an indicator of GSH status and metabolism.""

I have high tricarballylic acid which is from fumonisin mycotoxin produced by fusarium fungi. My tricarballylic acid level was 0.56. The reference range is less than .44. From my test results:

""High tricarballylic acid (propane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid) (Marker 9) could be caused by the intake of corn or corn-based food contaminated with fumonisins, a group of mycotoxins produced primarily by F. verticillioides, and other related species. Tricarballylic acid is released from fumonisins during passage through the gastrointestinal tract.

Tricarballylic acid is an inhibitor of the enzyme aconitase and therefore interferes with the Krebs cycle . The main symptoms of aconitase deficiency are myopathy and exercise intolerance. It may also act as a magnesium chelator. Tricarballylic acid is also metabolite of a component of a substance in modified corn starch, octenylsuccinic acid, found in a number of infant formulas such as Nutramigen, Vivonex, and Pregestimil. In addition, tricarballylic acid is a byproduct of beet sugar and maple sugar refining and might appear after ingestion of these sugars. Tricarballylic acid is also released from fumonisins upon certain food processing conditions. Clinical syndromes due to the intact mycotoxin are rare and characterized by abdominal pain and diarrhea. A specific role for fumonisins in the development of neural tube defects was suggested after the appearance of a cluster of such defects in Texas associated with consumption of corn from the heavily fumonisin-contaminated 1989 corn crop. More recent studies have shown that fumonisin B1 inhibits folate metabolism in cultured cells.""

Inhibition of folate metabolism by fumonism B1 would inhibit methylation and synthesis of SAM-e. See the methylation wiki:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3wsfv0/wiki_methylation_folate_mthfr_vitamin_b12/

Fortunately, I am not deficient in folate.

Vitamin B12 is a methyl donor. Fumonisin mycotoxins may explain why I am deficient in vitamin B12, my need to take B12 and possibly an inhibited methylation cycle:

""Vitamin B12 deficiency in mycotoxicity. The overall functions of vitamin B12 as a source of coenzymes, in intracellular recycling of methionine, in methionine synthase reaction, in the prevention of chromosome breakage, in methylation, and in maintaining a one-carbon metabolic balance are well established. Signs, symptoms, and clinical neurological indications of vitamin B12 deficiency are also been known [28. Consistent vitamin B12 deficiency in chronic toxigenic mold exposures has been observed in patients exposed to chronic toxigenic molds and mycotoxins [11].""

Fusarium grows on grains and indoors in carpet, mattresses, walls, wallpaper, etc. Fusarium secrets the mycotoxins trichothecenes (T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol), zearalenone and fumonisins:

The mycotoxins are neurotoxic, carcinogenic and cross the blood-brain barrier.

""When Candida grows out of balance, it can disrupt areas of the intestinal wall, producing toxins and leading to leaky gut syndrome. Candida toxins can depress the immune system. An inflammatory immune response and multiple food sensitivities can result from the leaky gut."" 

In 2008, Dr. Klinghardt wrote:

""Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) drives the growth of microbes: molds
increase their growth rate and put out far more virulent mycotoxins.
They feel attacked and fight back. The same appears to be true on all
levels of the microbiome: under the influence of man-made EMR -
viruses, spirochetes, mycoplasma, streptococci, staph etc increase
their individual self- defenses - while the host immune system (of
higher mammals) is severely compromised

Infants do not have a blood brain barrier (BBB) until 18 months of age:
they are completely vulnerable. Even teenagers are far more sensitive
to EMR then adults.  Astrocytes are responsible for creating the blood brain barrier. Past the
BBB the brain has a poor immune system: astrocytes and microglia are

""High 3-hydroxyglutaric (Marker 31) is a metabolite associated with the genetic disease glutaric aciduria type I, which is due to a deficiency of glutaryl CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan. Other elevated organic acids may include glutaric and glutaconic acids. This disease has been associated with clinical symptoms ranging from near normal to encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and other neurological abnormalities. Some individuals with glutaric acidemia have developed bleeding in the brain or eyes that may be mistaken for the effects of child abuse. This abnormality should be confirmed by additional testing of enzyme deficiencies and/or DNA at a pediatric medical genetics center (Morton et al., Am J. Med. Genetics 41: 89-95, 1991).

Elevated values may also be found in hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency, short-chain acyl dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD), or ketosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by glutaric acid metabolites causes astrocytes to adopt a proliferative phenotype, which may underlie neuronal loss, white matter abnormalities and macrocephalia.

Values in glutaric aciduria type I range from 60-3000 mmol/mol creatinine. Values higher than normal but less than 60 mmol/mol creatinine may be due to mild glutaric acidemia type I or to the other causes indicated above. 

Treatment of this disorder includes special diets low in lysine and supplementation with carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine (1000-2000 mg/day).""

**My amino acid test**

I do not need to go on a low lysine diet. My amino acid test by Genova found I was low in lysine. I was going to purchase lysine. My carnitine level was average.

**How acquired before becoming genetic?**

Glutaric aciduria is a new disease. Glutaric aciduria was discovered only forty years ago.
""Glutaric aciduria type I (GA-I) is a rare inherited disorder of L-lysine, L-hydroxylysine and L-tryptophan metabolism first described in 1975 [1], with an overall estimated prevalence of 1 in 100,000 newborns [2,3].""

'Newborn Screening for Glutaric Aciduria Type I: Benefits and limitations'

www.mdpi.com/2409-515X/1/2/57/htm

How did glutaric aciduria come? Does any mutagenic environmental factors cause it? Once acquired, does it become genetic? Multiple chemical sensitivity and porphria are medical conditions that once acquired in parents, becomes genetic in their offspring.

""The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern: mutated copies of the gene ""GCDH"" must be provided by both parents to cause glutaric acidemia type 1.""

""Alternative methods for high-risk population screening Clusters of affected patients from genetic isolates with high carrier frequencies have been identified. The Amish, Irish travellers and Lumbees have a high excretor phenotype (Basinger et al. 2006; Naughten et al. 2004; Strauss et al. 2003), whereas the Oji-Cree natives are low excretors (Greenberg et al. 2002). High-risk screening in the Amish and the Irish travellers was first performed by organic acid analysis but detection of C5DC in DBS is now used. There have been no documented false negatives in the Amish and the Irish travellers populations, whereas false negatives in the Oji-Cree natives were common when MS/MS was used. As a consequence, high-risk screening using DBS and a DNA-based technique specific for the DNA mutation present in this population has been implemented (Greenberg et al. 2002).""

If my parents were alive or if I had children, I would ask them to be tested to rule out genetically caused.

**Physical Description**

**Macrocephaly** ""Babies with glutaric acidemia type 1 often are born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Macrocephaly is amongst the earliest signs of GA1.""  

""Macrocephaly is found in 75% of patients during infancy (Bjugstad et al.2000), but is non-specific. Therefore GA-I has been included in the disease panel of newborn screening in some countries.""

Environmental medicine physician #1 disagreed that a ten day prescription of diflucan would suffice. He explained it takes at least three months to eradicate fungus. He offered to refill physcian #2's ten day prescription for a total of three months if my liver can tolerate the first ten days. Diflucan is mildly toxic to the liver.

Environmental medicine physician #1 also prescribed three months olf a starch free diet and Yeast-Ease by Dr. Jernigan:

Dr. Jernigan recommends molybdenum for detoxifying the toxin aldehyde from the die-off of candida-type yeast.

On my own, I will also be:

(1) eating raw sauerkraut fermented with saccharomyces and bacillus coagulans; 

(2)  swallowing baking soda. See posts on baking soda treating fungus and cancer.

(3) making an antifungal herbal tincture blend.

""Biophotons - probably one of the most groundbreaking discoveries of the 20th century. The highly ordered (Coherent) photons of light found in all living organisms are extremely Coherent in foods grown in the wild which are twice as Coherent as organically grown foods and 10 times that of conventionally grown foods. Foods grown in their most natural state contain the highest Coherency of all foods and contribute that Coherency to the consumer. Having access to freshly picked produce is of prime importance - either growing it yourself, frequenting a u-pick farm or joining a CSA (community supported agriculture). The sooner foods are consumed after harvest the higher the Coherency. A diet of fresh fruits, vegetables, berries and herbs is the simplest and easiest way for us to begin the process of healing ourselves and our planet as well as strengthening our bond with the Creator.""

Much of the produce sold at farmers markets is freshly picked. 

""We might be buying attractive fruits and veggies, but their bio-photon energy content may actually be close to zero. For example, avocados may be heat treated in order to speed up ripening. Heat treatment above 40 C or 110 F not only kills enzymes, but also eliminates bio-photons. The heat kills the life force of the cells. Even ""raw"" almonds may actually have been pasteurized.""

Hand wash, sparingly.

**My answer**

Lessemf's website lacks complete specifications on a majority of their products. lessemf has no warranty. Just a 30 day return policy. I wanted to buy a RF meter and a body volt meter before purchasing EMF clothes. Thereby, I would be able to immediately test them.

The first lessemf hat you referred to is made of Silverell. Silverell is 10% silver. The second hat is made of Swiss Shield fabric which is a silver/copper blend. Percentages are not disclosed.

Sieldon Fabrics:

""The inside lining cloth is a SHIELDON 240 © RF blocking cloth with metal fibers, the SHIELDON 040 © RF EMF/EMR Blocking net fabric with silver coated fibers or the SHIELDON 138 © RF EMF/EMR Blocking Cloth with silver fibers...."" ""The SHIELDON 240 © cloth is very durable and does not ware off. It is most likely the hat itself will ware off before the SHIELDON inside will. So after the hat will ware off you can remove the inside and sew it to a new hat. In order to make this solution as cheap, compact, easy to use and last for long time. The SHIELDON 040 © is a net fabric based on polyester and silver coated fibers. It is very flexible, more delicate and it feels better on the skin. For people that are sensitive to metal and for warmer temperatures, The SHIELDON 040 © based hats and lining are recommended.

The SHIELDON 138 © is very flexible, more delicate and it feels better on the skin. For people that are sensitive to metal , The SHIELDON 138 © based hats and lining are recommended.

Both SHIELDON 040 © &amp; SHIELDON 138 © are very delicate and we recommend a 300c hand wash only without any detergents. Please note that The RF protection layer is stitched to the hat with a visible wire across the hat base, which can sometimes change the hat's look.""

Shieldon 240 is made of steel fiber. www.4ehsbyehs.com/rf-blocking-fabrics/shieldon-240

The other Shieldon fabrics are made of silver. Shieldon 138 is 17% silver. Shieldon 138 has more silver than Silverell.

4ehsbyehs' design of a liner hat inside of a hat is brilliant and essential. Double, preferably triple protection is necessary. Zombie zapping (remote transcranial magnetic stimulation) is high power magnetic. I am considering buying an Australian style liner hat and hat for double protection during the day time and to wear the liner inside the antique iron pot I wear in bed at night. The iron pot is thick and heavy but only partially shields.

To choose which fabric to buy, you need to test what you are being exposed to electric and/or magnetic or ultrasound, their frequency and strength. Iron, steel, nickle, cobalt, molybdenum and magnets shield magnetic fields.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)

Silver and copper shield electric fields. Lesseremf's hats will partially shield electric fields but not magnetic fields nor ultrasound.

Ultrasound shielding needs further research and a post of its own. Which ever you buy, wear two simultaneously. For example, steel for magnetic fields. Silver for electric fields. Alternatively, two silver hats.

If you buy the hats, please advise whether they help.",Electromagnetics,[SHIELDING BRAIN] Hats and RF shielding fabrics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3vxn0d/shielding_brain_hats_and_rf_shielding_fabrics/

JDM commented:

""I got this to shield my head from cell towers and wifi. I wore it the first day because I actually do like the style, I think most people thought I had cancer, which did not bother me because I thought it was helping. Then I decided to do some tests to see if it works. My idea was to wrap my cell phone in it and see if it reduced/eliminated the signal. On five tests, it reduced the cell signal from a 5/4 to a 2/1, so that seemed good, but test calls to the phone went right through. Wifi signal was virtually unchanged, it wavered between full strength and one less than full strength, but that seems like normal variation, and it certainly did not stop any emails from coming in when I had the phone on wifi only mode. And all this was with the phone wrapped up with at least 4 layers of the fabric on each side! Because tests with one layer did nothing. So the one layer around my head apparently does nothing.""

I rescheduled earthing with my dog from first thing in the morning to the warmest time of the day at noon. The grass is dry. I miss early morning walking on dew. Then winter came making the hottest time of the day too cold.

Solution? Leather sole earthing shoes or wool slipper socks. If testing earthing with a body voltage meter, wool does not decrease earthing while leather partially does.

**Wool sole**

Wear with thick wool socks or sheepskin insole. Together, the wool sock or sheepskin insole and wool slipper sock may give adequate thickness for earthing on grass and beach sand. Sheepskin Insoles:

After several weeks of taking, Garden of Life's Raw Probiotics Women seem to have colonized.  Environmental medicine physician #1 ordered a GI Effects test by Genova Diagnostics. The test instructions are to cease taking probiotics for 14 days. 
While waiting to take the test I could tell the probiotics ceased colonizing. Is EMF and/or fungus killing my colonized probiotics?

Why? This is where the iron and copper are located in the CNS and glia cells are known to metabolically support neuron function. This is also where most brain tumors come from as well. And we know that these cells control the BBB, and that EMF has been associated with making brain tumors and causing the BBB to leak in Allan Frey’s studies with methylene blue. Fenton reactions all reduce levels of melatonin. Melatonin is the major antioxidant in the brain. Melatonin also protects the brain by stimulating glutathione peroxidase in all neurons. Glutathione peroxidase converts reduced glutathione to its oxidized form and in doing so converts hydrogen peroxide from H2O2 to H2o (water). The generation of water is what stops the generation of dangerous hydroxyl radicals in its tracks chemically. This immediately prevents cell degeneration and cell death in neurons. The generation of water from H2O2 reverses dehydration caused by this mechanism of action.

Copper-Zinc Imbalance: Unrecognized Consequence of Plant-Based Diets and a Contributor to Chronic Fatigue

http://www.westonaprice.org/modern-diseases/copper-zinc-imbalance-unrecognized-consequence-of-plant-based-diets-and-a-contributor-to-chronic-fatigue/#sthash.oFjXand5.dpuf

""Research suggests that these dynamic minerals are most compatible when hovering in the range of an 8:1 to 12:1 zinc-copper ratio. For example, someone consuming about 15 mg of zinc per day would require around 1.5 mg of copper.  In nature this correlation is almost flawlessly observed in sources of animal protein, where levels of zinc and copper occur in balanced quantities.....

Zinc is actually present in a wide variety of protein containing foods from animal products- such as red meat, egg yolk, organ meats, and seafood- to certain nuts, seeds, beans and cereal grains. The recommended daily allowance for zinc is currently set at 8-11 mg, which is certainly achievable from food sources. Yet, the issue lies not simply with crude zinc intake, but also in how accessible the sources are by the body. Plant sources of zinc are bound by anti-nutrients like phytic acid and therefore not easily absorbed. While irritating phytates can be neutralized by the processes of soaking and sprouting nuts nuts, legumes and grains (as was practiced in many traditional cultures), your average handful of granola, slice of bread, or dollop of hummus have certainly not been prepared with such virtuous care. Beef/lamb liver and oysters are by far the best sources of this powerful mineral, with four times the absorption rate of their plant counterparts, and a balanced ratio of other trace minerals. However in our fat-phobic, grain-chomping society, people have been wrongfully shooed away from incorporating these sacred, zinc-rich foods. Some experts even estimate that during the paleolithic era humans consumed an average of 50 mg of zinc per day from whole food sources. What's more, all-too common struggles such as excess sugar intake, alcohol, stress, heart disease, and infection further suppress levels of this critical nutrient.

""Lithium for Peak Brain Functioning
Q: I have a question regarding the recommended dose of elemental lithium you recommend for daily use for those who wish to use it as a preventive measure. You recommend 10-20 milligrams of lithium aspartate or orotate. However, on the bottle of lithium orotate it states that each tablet contains 125 mg of lithium orotate, yielding 5 mg elemental lithium. Does this mean that in order to get the 10 milligrams needed one would need to take two tablets?…Thanks for your clarification. 

Jonathon V. Wright, MD: You’re entirely correct! To obtain 10 to 20 milligrams of elemental lithium that research indicates can help keep your brain functioning at peak performance, you would need two to four tablets or capsules, each containing 5 milligrams of elemental lithium.

Low histamine causes over methylation and elevated serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine.

Pursuant to Dr. Dominique Belpomme, a biomarker of RWS and EHS  is high histamine. However, pursuant to Dr. Walsh, high histamine causes under methylation and low serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. Whereas, electromagnetic fields are known to cause low serotonin and dopamine but high norepinephrine.

Pursuant to Dr. Dominique Belpomme, a biomarker for MCS is high histamine. However, pursuant to Dr. Walsh, chemically sensitive people have low histamine, over methylation and elevated norepinephrine. Treat for elevated norepinephrine is choline, phosphatidyl choline and DMAE. DMAE synthesizes into choline. They elevate the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which decreases norepinephrine. Warning: acetylcholine also decreases dopamine. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3tti37/hpu_mcs_nitric_oxide_dr_klinghardt_found_hpu/

Further research is needed for both RWS and EHS and MCS to resolve the contradiction of whether low histamine or high histamine is a biomarker of RWS, EHS and MCS and which neurotransmitters are deficient or elevated.

I drove four hours to environmental medicine physician #2 to discover the send out lab sent out my blood to ARUP instead of Labcorp. The test requisition form specified Labcorp, the name of the test and test code #. This is clearly the send out lab's mistake. 

ARUP Lab performed Immune Complex Panel test code 0050667. This panel did not include basophils, CD3, CD4, CD8, etc. I complained to the send out lab's supervisor. The alibi was the lab did not draw enough blood. However, the lab did draw enough blood but sent it to the wrong lab. I complained to ARUP Lab as they should not have performed the test. 

The send out lab's supervisor sent back my physician's test requisition form to their lab to draw more blood. I will ask them to be sure to send to Labcorp, not ARUP. I went off SAM-e due to it causing irritability. My test results may have been different had the send out lab took adequate blood then while I was still taking SAM-e.

﻿**My biochemistry does not match Dr. Walsh's over methylation description**

Environmental medicine physician #2 ordered a whole blood histamine test at Labcorp. My histamine level is 25. Labcorp's reference is 12 - 127.

According to Dr. Walsh's research, my histamine level is low (below 40) which would make me over methylated and have high serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. Whereas, my serotonin and dopamine are not high but my norepinephrine is. 

Is my dopamine low because too much dopamine is being converted to norepinephrine? Excessive copper and depleted zinc can lower dopamine and elevate norepinephrine:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3tbfki/parkinsons_elevated_copper_lowers_dopamine_levels/

My SpectraCell Lab test reported normal copper and zinc levels. My copper and zinc levels are normal possibly due to being on an epi-paleo diet and for many years I was on a paleo diet. A plant based diet is deficient in zinc:

""The brain is picky about omega-3’s

The brain’s favorite omega-3 fatty acid is called DHA.  There are 3 types of omega-3 fatty acids: ALA, DHA, and EPA. ALA is found in both plant and animal foods. Popular vegetarian sources of ALA include flaxseed, walnuts, and chia seeds. ALA is often called the “parent” omega-3 because of this pathway:

ALA       →           EPA          →          DHA

From looking at this pathway, you might think that if you eat enough ALA, you’re all set. But here’s the problem–the body has a very hard time converting ALA to EPA and DHA, so about 95% of it remains stuck in the form of ALA.  However, we convert EPA to DHA very easily. This means that in order to be sure our brain gets enough DHA, we need to eat EPA.  Plant foods do not contain any EPA or DHA.  EPA and DHA are hard to find in the typical American diet, because the best sources are wild animal foods, such as cold-water, fatty fish (like salmon and mackerel), and naturally-raised animals, such as grass-fed cows and pasture-raised chickens. This is why public health officials sometimes recommend omega-3 supplements. These supplements are typically in the form of fish oil, but there are also new vegan-friendly supplements available which are made from algae.

Omega-3’s and ADHD

There have been many studies of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of ADHD, but most have shown no benefit or only modest improvement compared to medications. However, many experts seem to agree with this conclusion, quoted from a recent review [Bloch 2011]:

“Based on the currently available evidence, using omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in lieu of traditional pharmacologic treatments is not recommended in children with significant ADHD symptoms. However, given the evidence of modest efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and its relatively benign side-effect profile, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, particularly with higher doses of EPA, is a reasonable treatment strategy as augmentation to traditional pharmacotherapy or for those families reticent to use psychopharmacologic agents.”

The bottom line is that medications seemed to work much better than omega-3 supplements.  In the studies that did show a modest benefit from omega-3’s, the doses of EPA that seemed to work best were between 300 and 600 mg per day. But wait…doesn’t the brain prefer DHA?  Yes.  Even though the brain loves and needs lots of DHA to work properly, researchers find that EPA supplements seem to work much better than DHA supplements. This suggests that the body prefers to make DHA out of EPA on demand, rather than having lots of ready-made DHA hanging around–this is probably because DHA is very unstable and can’t be stored.""

**My methylation**

My father and my father's mother died from parkinson's disease. I have dopamine deficiency. Yet, I have normal levels of dopamine cofactors: 

Genova Lab amino acid test detected normal level of tyrosine and methionine.

SpectraCell Lab detected normal levels of vitamin B6.

How about my methyl cycle?  B12 is not a cofactor of dopamine. B12 plays a vital role in the methyl cycle. True Health Diagnostics lab found a normal level of folic acid but a low level of vitamin B12. Despite taking methyl B12, folic acid and very low dose (20 mg) lithium orotate which enhances absorption of B12 and folic acid ehances absorption of lithium, I remain deficient in B12. Environmental medicine #1 had referred environmental medicine physician #3 who had prescribed very low dose lithium because lithium is neuroprotective.  Doctor #1 advised me to read Jonathan Wright's ground breaking article on lithium:

www.michaelmooney.net/Lithium.html

My environmental medicine physician #4 had prescribed Perque Activated B-12 Guard 5,000 mcg sublingual tablets along with liquid folic acid several times per day because I was deficient in B12 but not folic acid. My doctor #4 explained proper B12/folic acid ratio is important, supplementing with SAM-e would not be needed and could dangerously elevate homocysteine.

True Health Diagnostics lab detected I do not have a MTHFR mutation. I can convert folate into L-methylfolate.

My environmental medicine physicians #1 and #2 offered to order a methyl test. I declined the test due to my medical insurance not covering the test. The methyl tests are described in part 1. The methyl test includes B12, folic acid, methionine and MTHFR which my medical insurance separately paid for. What my medical insurance would not pay for is a SAM-e test which is in the methyl test.

Environmental medicine physician #1 prescribed SAM-e to ascertain whether SAM-e can elevate dopamine. Last two months,  I took one Jarrow sublingual 400 mg tablet. Two days ago, I retook a neurotransmitter test.

I do not feel any improvement on SAM-e. This week, I have begun to feel irritable. Excessive SAM-e can cause irritability. 

http://forums.phoenixrising.me/index.php?threads/irritability-with-sam-e-or-maybe-tmg.11626/

Brain cells that release dopamine out into the “synapse” (space between cells where communication occurs) vacuum it back up using a dopamine transporter. This crucial transporter is regulated by zinc. Zinc binds to the dopamine transporter and slows it down, allowing dopamine to remain active in the synapse for a longer period of time before being pulled back into the cell to be recycled. It is essentially a natural “dopamine reuptake inhibitor.” Interestingly, this is also one of the ways in which stimulant medications work to improve dopamine activity.

There have been two clinical trials of zinc supplements in the treatment of ADHD, both of which noted some benefit. An Iranian study found that Ritalin + (15 mg of elemental) zinc given for 6 weeks worked twice as well as Ritalin + a sugar pill. A Turkish study found that (40 mg of elemental) zinc given for 12 weeks worked twice as well as a sugar pill.

Zinc and iron supplements can be hard to stomach. Zinc frequently causes nausea, and iron supplements can cause constipation and other gastrointestinal problems. Are there alternatives to supplements for people who have mineral deficiencies? What is causing these deficiencies in the first place? Are there dietary changes we can make that can improve our mineral status?

Plant foods are very low in zinc, whereas animal foods are excellent sources of zinc.

While both plant and animal foods contain iron, the type of iron found in animal foods (called “heme” iron) is 8 times more bioavailable (useful) to us than the type found in plant foods.

Seed foods (which include grains, beans, and nuts) contain phytic acid, which interferes with our ability to absorb essential minerals. For more information, please see my grains/beans/nuts/seeds page.

Improve zinc status by reducing phytic acid intake (minimize grains, beans, nuts, and seeds), and including animal foods in your diet.  Zinc supplements may also be helpful.""

My comment:

I agree with author's advice to reduce grains. There is ample literature on why to eliminate  grains from diet. See paleo and epi-paleo diets. I disagree with: ""Reduce omega-6 intake by minimizing vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds."" Whereas, soaking nuts and seeds over night and straining the water off or sprouting nuts and seeds and eating fresh or low heat dehydrated decreases phytic acid and omega 6. Sprouted nuts and seeds are high density nutrient antioxidant foods and anticancer.

Cofactors are amino acids and vitamins that synthesize neurotransmitters.  Tyrosine and B6 are cofactors of dopamine. Phenylalanine and B6 are cofactors of PEA. 

My doctor answered probiotics synthesize neurotransmitters. He did not know which neurotransmitters. He ordered a Genova Lab stool test and a Genova Lab Intestinal Permeability test:

https://www.gdx.net/product/comprehensive-digestive-stool-analysis-cdsa

https://www.gdx.net/product/intestinal-permeability-assessment-urine

One cause of intestinal permeability is food allergies. Years ago, I had an ELISE blood food allergy test which indicated very few food allergies. My father had celiac disease. In the 1990s, my celiac test was negative. Since I was on a Weston A Price diet (paleo), I refrained from grains any how. This year, I switched to an epi-paleo diet.

In 2013, a doctor ordered a timed cortisol test panel which included a gluten intolerance test. I had low cortisol in the morning when cortisol should be peaking. I tested positive for gluten intolerance. I have been on a grain free diet for years. Food allergies and gluten intolerance are not the cause of my intestinal permeability.

Environmental medicine doctor prescribed GI-Revive by Designs for Health. Powder contains L-glutamine, N-acetyl-glucosamine, MSM, DGL, slippery elm, marshmallow, chamomile, okra, TOA-free cat’s claw, quercitin, mucin, licorice and stevia. It made me nauseous. It wasn't until I took other supplements that made me nauseous that I read the ingredients. Stevia was the common ingredient. I now read ingredients prior to purchasing. I took one of the ingredients, cat's claw, as a tincture. 

Glutamine deficiency can cause intestinal permeability. Glutamine is an amino acid that is prescribed to treat intestinal permeability. However, my amino acid test indicated I am not deficient in glutamine. 

Another cause of intestinal permeability is lack of probiotics. My Genova Lab stool test indicated no probiotics. My intestinal permeability test indicated permeability. I had attempted to restore probiotics by:

(1) Opening acidopholous capsules, pouring the powder into raw cow milk in a wide mouth quart canning jar, fermenting on a shelf, refrigerating and drinking.

(2)  buying raw organic goat milk and live kefir grains directly from a goat farmer. I made raw goat kefir. I moved. I could no longer buy raw goat milk. Cow milk slowly killed the kefir. Goat kefir prefers goat milk. Cow milk kefir prefer cow milk. Cow milk kefir is harder to find.

(3)  Fermenting raw organic grass fed cow milk without adding probiotics powder or kefir grains

(4)  Fermenting kombucha in half gallon wide mouth canning jars of tea with steel sprout lids.

(5) Fermenting raw cabbage into raw sauerkraut.

(6)  Swallowing pills of various strains of probiotics that are known to be able to colonize in humans. I did not want to take pills forever. I took Jarrow and Garden of Life Primal Defense and Garden of Life Primal Defense:

www.gardenoflife.com/ProductsforLife/DigestiveHealth/PrimalDefensesupsup/tabid/638/Default.aspx

www.gardenoflife.com/ProductsforLife/DigestiveHealth/PrimalDefensesupsupULTRA/tabid/639/Default.aspx

Yet, repeat tests indicated intestinal permeability and probiotics did not colonized. Is lack of probiotics causing my intestinal permeability and what is killing my probiotics?

I further researched strains of probiotics. Townsend Letter published one of the first articles on the health benefits of probiotics. The featured patient was Jordan Rubin. 'From Tragedy to Triumph: One Man's Journey Back to Health' by Paul Goldberg, PhD, DC, DACBN

www.townsendletter.com/AugSept2003/AugSept2003.htm

Jordan Rubin conducted ground breaking research on probiotics and founded Garden of Life. How does Jordan Rubin get his probiotics to colonize? He drinks organic grass fed raw milk from cows he owns. He founded a second company, Beyound Organics to sell raw cheese and milk. Does he make his own kefir? I went back to read the description of the 32 strains in Garden of Life Raw Probiotics Women. Previously, I had been put off because it was marketed to women. 

""Father of Probiotics, Elie Metchnikoff, RAW Probiotics™ provides probiotic strains found in Bulgarian Yogurt and Eastern European Wild Kefir—as recommended by Metchnikoff based on his study of Bulgarian longevity in the early 1900s and the probiotic-rich cultured dairy they consumed.""

www.gardenoflife.com/Products-for-Life/RAW-Digestion/RAW-Probiotics-Women.aspx

What peaked my interest was the Eastern European Wild Kefir. Could this freeze dried powdered kefir grow into living kefir grains? Is this cow milk kefir a more potent strain than goat kefir? I opened pills of Raw Probiotics Women and poured them into raw organic grass fed cow milk. Fermented on a shelf. The powder grew into kefir grains. Larger and thicker curds than the goat kefir. Kefir grains look like cottage cheese. This kefir is more difficult to separate from the milk. This kefir is not just kefir. It is symbiotic. Other strains of probiotics are in it.

I made another new fresh starter in raw milk. It does not make good kefir. There are too many soil microorganisms in the probiotic. I will add the probiotic to raw cabbage to ferment into raw sauerkraut.

It was the most potent probiotic. It had the most long lasting effect after discontinuing consumption. It seemed to colonize. But alas, the probiotics stopped colonizing. I resumed taking Raw Probiotics Women. As I write this, I am repeating a neurotransmitter test. Will taking probiotics while conducting the test elevate neurotransmitter levels?

Since my doctor did not know which neurotransmitters are synthesized by probiotics,  I conducted an online search for 'probiotics and dopamine' and 'probiotics and neurotransmitters.' No results. It was not until I read a post on 'gut flora' in /r/alternativehealth that I tried 'gut flora' as a search term. Furthermore, the post mentioned gut flora can synthesize serotonin and dopamine. I posted the significant part:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3pkxcn/neurotransmitters_parkinsons_gut_flora_make/

There is not much information on this topic. 'Gut Bacteria Regulate Happiness'

http://neurosciencenews.com/gut-bacteria-regulate-happiness-hippocampus-serotonin/

If probiotics cannot remain colonized, there are other treatments for intestinal permeability:

""repairing the gut can also help to repair the brain barrier. Supplements that can be recommended include probiotics, curcumin, resveratrol, glutamine, n-acetyl-cysteine, vitamin A, vitamin D, omega 3, or omega 6 essential fatty acids. These are all nutrients that can help to repair the barriers.""

'Blood-Brain Barrier Damage and Neuroautoimmunity'
Aristo Vojdani, PhD, MSc

www.townsendletter.com/Oct2014/bloodbrain1014_2.html

For several years,I have been taking curcumin tincture. This month, I finished a 16 oz bottle of primrose oil. I will switch from primrose oil to black cumin seed oil. In addition, I take liquid fish oil. 

Cystein is a precursor of glutathione. I take glutathione. SpectraCell vitamin test indicated I am not deficient in vitamin A. I was deficient in vitamin D but when the weather warmed up, I frequently sunbathed while earthing. I will ask for a repeat intestinal permeability test.

""We investigated the alteration of pteridine levels in mouse tissues under the exposure to 50Hz circularly and linearly polarized magnetic fields. Neopterin (NP), biopterin (BP), tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), pterin (AHP) and GTP-CHI activity were measured. Five week-old mice were exposed continuously in the period of 1,3 and 6 weeks. The circularly polarized magnetic fields may affect the immune system and biosynthetic pathway from q-BH2 to BH4 in mouse due to both changes of NP level and BH4/BP ratio. In horizontally polarized fields, almost the same results were obtained. From these results, magnetic field may affect the pteridine levels in mouse which indicate the indirect estimate of the degree of stress emerging during immune response.""

""Moreover, as Norseen suggests in his discussion of a satellite downlink producing the witch hallucination, semiotics do not even need to be encoded within a sensory medium, such as a television program or internet broadcast, but can instead be transmitted directly into the brain via electromagnetic radiation or ultrasound. As Norseen put it, the human brain has an ""extremely keen sensitivity to both internal and external signals, from sight, sound, smell, touch, memory, ultrasound, EMF (electromagnetic frequency), etc."" (emphasis added), which can make ""...the human brain ... in essence, a sex, violence, religious pump"" Norseen describes a technology that can literally control one's thoughts.

Ultrasound is high-frequency sound that is inaudible (i.e., cannot be heard) by the human ear. However, it still might affect hearing and produce other health effects. For more information, see Appendix C.

Factors to consider regarding ultrasonics include:

The upper frequency of audibility of the human ear is approximately 15 to 20 kilohertz (kHz). This is not a set limit: some individuals may have higher or lower (usually lower) limits. The frequency limit normally declines with age.

Most of the audible noise associated with ultrasonic sources, such as ultrasonic welders or ultrasonic cleaners, consists of subharmonics of the machine's major ultrasonic frequencies.

Example: Many ultrasonic welders have a fundamental operating frequency of 20 kHz, a sound that is at the upper frequency of audibility of the human ear. However, a good deal of noise may be present at 10 kHz, the first subharmonic frequency of the 20-kHz operating frequency, which is audible to most people.

https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/new_noise/#ultrasonics

APPENDIX C--ULTRASOUND (PDF)

Ultrasound is any sound whose frequency is too high for the human ear to hear. (The upper frequency that the human ear can detect is approximately 15 to 20 kilohertz, or kHz, although some people can detect higher frequencies, and the highest frequency a person can detect normally declines with age.) Most of the audible noise associated with ultrasonic sources, such as ultrasonic welders or ultrasonic cleaners, consists of subharmonics. Even though the ultrasound itself is inaudible, the subharmonics it generates can affect hearing and produce other health effects.

C.1 Health Effects and Threshold Limit Values (TLVs®)

Research indicates that ultrasonic noise has little effect on general health unless there is direct body contact with a radiating ultrasonic source. Reported cases of headache and nausea associated with airborne ultrasonic exposures appear to have been caused by high levels of audible noise from source subharmonics.

Subharmonics are sound waves with frequencies that are a fraction (e.g., one-half, one-quarter) of the original ultrasound frequency. Because they are lower than the ultrasound, the human ear can detect them.

The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH®) has established permissible ultrasound exposure levels. These recommended limits (set at the middle frequencies of the one-third octave bands from 10 kHz to 100 kHz) are designed to prevent possible hearing loss caused by the subharmonics of the set frequencies, rather than the ultrasound itself. These exposure levels represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed without adverse effects on their ability to hear and understand normal speech. (Table C-1)

ACGIH also offers recommendations for measuring or verifying ultrasound levels, which requires a precision sound level meter equipped with a suitable microphone of adequate frequency response and a third-octave filter. CSHOs considering evaluating ultrasound levels should consult the CTC for assistance in selecting a suitable instrument.

ACGIH also notes that:

Subjective annoyance and discomfort may occur at levels between 75 and 105 dB for the frequencies from 10 kHz to 20 kHz especially if they are tonal in nature. Hearing protection or engineering controls may be needed to prevent subjective effects. Tonal sounds in frequencies below 10 kHz might also need to be reduced to 80 dB. (ACGHI, 2012)

Table C-1. Select Examples of Threshold Limit Values for Ultrasound Measured in Air

For additional information on ultrasound exposure levels, ceiling values, and 8-hour TWAs that apply to other frequencies, as well as ceiling values measured underwater, refer to the complete ACGIH TLV for ultrasound (see ACGIH. 2012. Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents &amp; Biological Exposure Indices. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists).

C.2 Controls

High-frequency noise is highly directional and is associated with short wavelengths. This means that it is easily reflected or blocked by any type of barrier. The wavelength of a 16-kHz tone, for example, is about 3/4 inch. A modest barrier, extending just 1 to 2 inches beyond the source, is generally sufficient to reflect noise of approximately the same frequency away from a nearby worker. High-frequency audible noise is also easily absorbed by many acoustical materials, such as glass fiber or foam.

C.3 International Ultrasound Exposure Limit Recommendations

Over the past decades, several countries have set exposure limits or recommended levels for ultrasound at various frequencies. The differences in limits are great and reflect differences in the interpretation and analysis of studies on ultrasound and human health. Table C-2 lists ceiling values measured in air in dB, as opposed to 8-hour TWAs or ceiling values measured in water in dB. Though ultrasonic frequencies are not audible to the human ear, it is clear that the international community is concerned about the effects that subharmonic frequencies have on human health.

""The Lilly Wave called a balanced bidirectional pulse pair invented by John Cunningham Lilly is a carrier waveform that bypasses the mind’s subconscious defense systems. It has been monitored via oscilloscopes connected to homes A/C ground and neutral of power lines. It can be used to transmit mind control via ultrasonic (1 – 10MHz) and electromagnetic wavelengths (600m to 1e-15m).  •Electromagnetic wavelengths transmit long/short/FM wavelength radio waves, and TV/telephone/wireless signals or energies. They are also responsible for transmitting energy in the form of microwaves, infrared radiation (IR), visible light (VIS), ultraviolet light (UV), X-rays, and gamma rays (1996)  • The Lilly wave can be neutralized via pink or white noise generators connecting to the non-voltage A/C ground and neutral of the homes power grid.

The goal was to find an electric current waveform with which animals could be stimulated through implanted electrodes for several hours per day for several months without causing irreversible changes in threshold by the passage of current through the tissue.

Many waveforms, including 60-cps. sine-wave current could apparently be used safely for these limited schedules of stimulation. They could not be used for the intensive, long-term schedule of chronic stimulation. Electric current passed through the brain can cause at least two distinct types of injury: thermal and electrolytic.

The technical problem in chronic brain stimulation is to stay above the excitatory threshold and below the injury threshold in the neuronal system under consideration. This result can be achieved most easily by the proper choice of waveforms and their time courses; and less easily by the choice of the range of repetition frequencies and train durations.

The previous wave forms used in neurophysiology and in neurosurgery injured the neurons when unidirectional current passed through the brain. Dr. Lilly developed a new electrical wave form to balance the current, first in one direction and then, after a brief interval, in the other. Thus ions moving in the neurons would first be pushed one way and then quickly the other way, stimulating the neurons and leaving the ions in their former positions within the neurons. This new wave form was called a balanced bidirectional pulse pair, or the Lilly Wave. Microscopic studies of brains stimulated with this balanced pulse pair showed that there was no injury of the neuronai networks from this kind Waveform of stimulating current: pulse pairs of current resulting from quasi-differentiation, with passive electrical elements, of a rectangular pulse. Measured at 2 percent of the peak, the duration of the positive pulse (upward) is 34 µsec, and the duration of the negative pulse (downward) is 28 µsec. stimulation.""

Around 100 MHz the usual FM stuff.

 •
Around 200 MHz - maybe DAB - digital audio broadcasting.

 •
230 - 350 MHz - unsure. Maybe partly military stuff.

 •
380-400 TETRA-BOS, i.e. digital police radio etc.

 •
Around 480 MHz USB noise, overload caused by that.

 •
Around 720 MHz - USB noise?

 •
800+ LTE800 - mobile phones.

 •
900+ GSM - mobile phones.

 •
Around 960 MHz USB noise (most probably), and overload.

 
Yes, that are a lot of guesses.

""Their results have been consistent and alarming: not only does radiation from a cell phone damage the blood-brain barrier, but it does so at even when the exposure level is reduced a thousandfold. Even more disturbingly, and contrary to what was expected, the damage to the blood-brain barrier worsened when the experimenters reduced the exposure level. The implies that SAR ratings for cell phones may be worthless and that it may not be possible to make cell phones safer by reducing their power.

In laboratory rats, Salford’s team has demonstrated that blood-brain barrier leakage occurs after only two minutes of exposure. Further, a single two-hour exposure to a cell phone, even at reduced power, was shown to damage or destroy up to two percent of an animal’s brain cells.""

A permeable blood brain barrier would enable bacteria and viruses to cross the BBB. Only antibiotics and antivirals that could cross the BBB would be able to treat the infections.

A permeable blood brain barrier would make it easier for biological warfare, which was developed to penetrate the brain, to do so. Bacterial, such as the Nazi and later CIA developed lyme and viruses, such as AIDS, do cross the BBB.

Lyme was initially developed by Nazis and later CIA with Nazi assistance:

Deficiency of glutathione reduces protection from EMR, toxic chemicals and heavy metals. People with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) sustain chemical injuries from toxic chemicals below EPA's Permissible Exposure Level (PEL) and OSHA's Threshold Limit Value (TLV). People with MCS have glutathione deficiency and liver enzyme deficiency including PON1 deficiency. Their liver's ability to detoxify is compromised.

Toxic exposures can permanently inhibit synthesis of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and liver enzymes. Once acquired, 50% change offspring inherits MCS. Genova Lab offers a genetic DetoxiGenomic test.

The day I started making travel arrangements to attend the convention, zombie zapping increased. Zombie zapping is attacking the brain with a directed energy weapon. Enroute to Los Angeles, zombie zapping increased. During the four days of the convention, my brain was zapped while I was taking notes. During breaks, visiting booths and while eating at the convention, zombie zapping stopped. Zombie zapping resumed during lectures. After the convention ended, zombie zapping during the day has not resumed. Zombie zapping the entire time I am sleeping is stronger than prior to making travel arrangements to the convention.

I do not have electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS). I have radio wave sickness (RWS). Being around typical levels of EMF does not cause noticeable effects. I can go to internet cafes, libraries, hotels, etc. Directed energy weapons beam EMF at much higher levels than what is typical. Zombie zapping increased every evening of the four days of the cancer convention. All night long while I was sleeping.

I woke up feeling like my head was beaten over a thousand times. concussion pain, swollen pulsing head, stiff neck, foggy headedness, swollen eyes, snow blindness. Eyes feel like they have been punched. Temporary paralysis. Difficulty arising. Burning stiff spine and painful hips are crippling. Waking up hyperventilating. I do not hyperventilate during the day or before going to sleep. I suspect I hyperventilate while sleeping and after awaking because zombie zapping is decreasing the blood flow (hypoperfusion) in the brain which impedes oxygen. Hypoperfusion can cause brain injury and cognitive decline. Zombie zapping causes over sleeping. Zombie zapping caused me to arrive late to the convention each morning.

Sleeping with my head inside an iron pot and an iron griddle over my spine did not provide sufficient shielding. The iron pot stayed on my head because its handle is underneath my chin as chin strap. The iron griddle falls off my lower spine due to my changing position while sleeping. 

The four day convention ended. Zombie zapping continued to discourage me from submitting my notes on reddit as I promised to do.

I will be researching and writing on more biomarkers of brain injury and which labs prefer the tests. Some of the biomarkers are:

I used my activated Motorola Droid 3 and unactivated Motorola Droid 4 smartphones to take notes. The day after the convention, hackers tampered with the USB setting to prevent me from copying files from my phone to a computer via an USB cable. I inserted a SD card in my phone. The SD card would not mount. I searched for my notes to email them to myself but hackers had deleted the file.

Brain injury. Further cognitive decline.

""The Hum"" is louder and has more vibration. ""The Hum"" is ultrasound. The large iron pot covers my ears. Sleeping with my head and ears inside the iron pot does not shield ultrasound. The ultrasound is just as loud and vibrational while I am falling asleep as it is after waking up.

Another Motorola battery was bricked. Motorola Droid 3 boots to a red Motorola M icon but will not finish booting up. Battery will not charge. I switched batteries with a back up Droid 3. The phones are charging the switched batteries.

In June, I purchased a heavy duty Bosc car battery so I can leave my car on while charging my laptops and phones without getting a dead battery.  Hackers circumvented battery charging by causing my laptop to immediately turn on while charging. If I do not remember to unplug the power adapter after charging, the battery will completely drain.
 
Simply connecting a power adapter to an outlet immediately turns on my laptop even though the lid is closed. This drains the battery as hackers tamper with the smart meter to prevent the wall outlet from charging my laptop. 

Likewise, charging my phones turns them on. Charging the batteries takes much longer because the laptop and phones are on. If I do not remember to promptly remove the battery after unplugging the power adapter, the battery discharges.

After the convention ended, my CyberPower car inverter was damaged. EMP attack? I purchased a replacement inverter.

Is ultrasound capable of helping neural dust to penetrate the BBB?

'The Hum"" is ultrasound hearing, not microwave auditory effect. Strong beaming of ultrasound increases the vibration of 'The Hum.' A strong 'Hum', especially if beamed at the brain, can induce BBB opening. 

Cytokines,  heavy metals and pathogens could be able to penetrate the BBB. Cytokines are inflammatory proteins. These could induce brain inflammation.  It would be more difficult to chelte heavy metals and eradicate pathogens. For example, lyme and HIV can penetrate the BBB which is why they are more difficult to eradicate. Lyme and HIV were developed as biological warfare:

**Lipoic acid reduces demyelination**

""Lipoic acid (LA) is a dietary supplement with antioxidant properties and has been studied specifically in MS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated primarily by immune cells, are implicated as mediators of demyelination and nerve damage (Ortiz, 2009; Miller, 2009). Known to cross the blood-brain barrier, LA decreases the activity of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. It is believed that ICAM-1 and other adhesion molecules are responsible for allowing certain pro-inflammatory immune cells, like T-lymphocytes, to enter the CNS, paving the way for induction or exacerbation of inflammation and tissue damage (Biernacki 2004; Cournu-Rebeix 2003; Dedrick 2003).

In an animal MS model, LA produced a significant reduction of demyelination and infiltration of the CNS by T lymphocytes (Marracci 2002; Morini 2004; Schreibelt 2006). Other researchers have followed up on these studies. In a pilot clinical trial, thirty-seven patients with MS were randomly assigned to receive various doses of LA (up to 2400 mg/day) or placebo. After two weeks, patients were assessed for levels of ICAM-1 and tolerability of high-dose LA. In addition to being well tolerated by patients, LA treatment was associated with reduced ICAM-1 levels and reduced T-cell migration into the CNS (Yadav 2005).""

**Lipoic acid prevents and cures cancer**

Labor Day weekend at the Cancer Control Society convention, physicians and recovered patients discussed how poly-mva cures cancer. Recovered patients testified taking poly-mva and eating a raw vegan diet or on the Gerson Therapy diet cured their cancer. They remained on this protocol. They remained cancer free.

Hydrogen peroxide has an oxidizing effect on the body, which functions to kill off yeast. To implement this protocol, begin with just one drop of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide in a large glass of distilled water. Take up to three glasses a day, slowly increasing the number of drops of hydrogen to 10.""

**Sources of Lion's Mane**

Thanks to /u/realmushrooms for advice:

""There is a lot of research on Lion's Mane and the compounds in Lion's Mane in regards to many different brain related functions (search ""hericium"" on pubmed). The big thing to note when looking at these studies is how the mushrooms are prepared. The majority of mushrooms studies all use fruiting body extracts, either hot water extracted, alcohol extracted, or both. What many people don't realize is that a lot of products are not made from mushrooms, they're made from mycelium on grain. These products pose as mushroom products and make claims based off research from fruiting body extracts when in fact they have much less active compounds and much higher amounts of starch (filler) than a fruiting body extract.

Good example:

www.rewildthyself.com/regenerate-brain-cells/

While this is good info, the product recommended at the bottom is a mycelium on grain product. See the supplements panel for ""mycelium"" and other ingredients ""myceliated brown rice"". FYI Host Defense is made with both mycelium on grain and fruiting body and they don't say how much of each. The bulk of their products are made from mycelium on grain. Just read the supplements panel.""

Tinctures made from fresh herbs are more potent than tinctures made from dried herbs. 
Companies making fresh lion's mane tincture of fruiting body: 

Host Defense's tincture is made of fresh and dried lion's mane.

Iodine outside of seafood DOES NOT OFFER THIS BENEFIT TO HUMANS. This group won't like that bit of news but it is true. You need all your iodine in seafood sources. Iodine also protects DHA from oxidation in neural synapses. Selenium, zinc, magnesium and B vitamins help iodine absorption.

Just saying use iodine is not enough............YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW AND WHY. What you currently believe is likely not true.

""You might be shocked to learn that artificial blue light in your environment destroys iodine absorption due to poor melatonin signaling in the brain.  When iodine is low in nerves over time it causes lower levels of vitamin D and vitamin K2 and atherosclerosis usually develops in the blood vessels that feed the vascular supply to nerves.   You  might be shocked to learn loss of melatonin signaling in the brain and in nerves also increases estrogen levels and,  this in turn,  further lowers iodine absorption from the gut in both sexes to cause peripheral neuropathy.  This is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy I see in my medical clinic.""

**My Zombie Zapping**

The day I started making travel arrangements to attend the convention, zombie zapping increased. Zombie zapping is attacking the brain with a directed energy weapon.

Enroute to Los Angeles, zombie zapping increased. During the four days of the convention, my brain was zapped while I was taking notes. Zombie zapping increased every evening, all night long while I was sleeping. 

I woke up feeling like my head was beaten over a thousand times. concussion pain, swollen pulsing head, stiff neck, foggy headedness, swollen eyes, snow blindness. Eyes feel like they have been punched.  Temporary paralysis. Difficulty arising. Burning stiff spine and painful hips are crippling. Zombie zapping caused me to arrive late to the convention each morning.

Sleeping with an iron pot over my head and an iron griddle over my spine did not provide sufficient shielding. 

The four day convention ended yesterday. I departed Los Angeles. Last night, zombie zapping continued to discourage me from submitting my notes on reddit as I promised to do.

I will be researching and writing on more biomarkers of brain injury and which labs prefer the tests. The biomarkers I already submitted are:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3kbs6w/rws_ehs_biomarkers_series_cerebral_hypoperfusion/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3j1s7b/rws_and_ehs_biomarker_series_s100b_protein/

Zombie zapping increased when I made travel arrangements, traveling enroute, during the convention and after the convention. During breaks, visiting booths and while eating at the convention, zombie zapping stopped. Zombie zapping resumed during lectures. After the convention ended, zombie zapping during the day has not resumed. Zombie zapping the entire time I am sleeping is stronger than prior to making travel arrangements to the convention.

I do not have EHS. I have RWS. My being around typical levels of EMF does not cause noticeable effects. I can go to internet cafes, libraries, hotels, etc. Directed energy weapons beam EMF at much higher levels than what is typical. 

**Reporting meter measurements of zombie zapping**

A body voltage meter may be able to measure zombie zapping. Typically, zombie zapping occurs the entire time I am sleeping but not when I am awake. The exception was the first week I wore an iron pot on my bed in bed. My brain was zapped during the day time to discourage me from wearing the iron pot. I continued wearing the iron pot in bed. Daytime zombie zapping stopped. It would be impossible for me to take measurements while I am sleeping.

Last month, I purchased an used Fluke 115 multimeter to make into a body voltage meter. Fluke has the best reputation. The model was TRMS. I returned the Fluke 115 because it widely fluctuated during readings. When I retested, the readings were not identical. Perhaps it needed to be recalibrated. Two weeks ago, I wrote a report of measurements earthed and unearthed having a laptop on my lap. I will post it. I did not try to measure zombie zapping because it was occuring while I was sleeping. 

I am waiting delivery of a brand new TRMS eM860T multimeter by ennoLogic and a grounding cord to connect to it:

www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MNP1I3I/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A1PYXZA5A4NQ66

If zombie zapping resumes during the daytime, I will try to measure it with the body voltage meter and/or the new RF Explorer spectrum analyzer and an antenna I purchased. I have not had time to open the box and watch the tutorials on how to use the RF Explorer:

**Hacking and deletion of 2/3 of my notes**

Today, a hacker prevented me from making a back up copy of two plain test files. A hacker deleted my main file. Tonight, I had intended to start posting my notes on reddit.

Hackers further tampered with the power management of my Lenovo X200 laptop. The BIOS was flashed with libreboot due to being infected with badBIOS. Simply connecting a power adapter to an outlet immediately turns on my laptop even though the lid is closed. Likewise, charging my phones turns them on. Charging the batteries takes much longer because the laptop and phones are on. If I do not remember to promptly remove the battery after unplugging the power adapter, the battery discharges.

Hackers have been power line hacking. I need to use my laptop solely on battery power. I do not drive that much. I purchased a heavy duty Bosc car battery so I can leave my car on while charging my laptops and phones without getting a dead battery. 

I did not drive to the cancer convention. Somehow my laptop battery and extended battery had not been charged though they were plugged in an outlet for several hours. Connecting a power adapter to an outlet is not charging the battery. Yellow battery indicator light is blinking. I opened the lid and entered my passwords. The battery icon in the system tray does not indicate percentage charged. Power settings in system settings does not indicate the battery is charging. Power line hacking can effectively prevent an outlet from charging a device. I have written on prior incidents of power line hacking and control of outlets in /r/badBIOS.

I used my activated Motorola Droid 3 and unactivated Motorola Droid 4 smartphones to take notes.  Previously, hackers had tampered with their power management. The phones never charge when connected to a computer. The phones freeze when I try to use them while charging. Charging takes a long time as the phones automatically turn on when connected to a charger. If I do not immediately turn the phones off after charging, the battery dissipates. Hackers remotely turn on my phones to geolocate me ad to discharge the batteries. To prevent this, I store my phones inside a metal box inside my backpack. At night, I store the phones inside a metal box next to my battery operated alarm clock. 

The day after the convention, hackers tampered with the USB setting to prevent me from copying files from my phone to a computer via an USB cable. I inserted a SD card in my phone. The SD card would not mount.  I searched for my notes to email them to myself but hackers had deleted the file.   

I will submit notes from the second plain text file, a few hand written notes, what I remembered and information from hand outs.

**Retaliation for submitting this post**

Another Motorola battery is bricked. Droid 3 boots to red Motorola M icon but will not finish booting up. Battery will not charge. I switched batteries with a back up Droid 3. The phones are charging the switched batteries.

My CyberPower car inverter no longer charges my laptop and smartphones though the CyberPower green indicator light is on. EMP attack? I purchased a replacement inverter.

http://emfrefugee.blogspot.nl/2015/07/treatments-recommended-by-dr-belpomme.html

""Especially notable is the brain blood reperfusion observed in nearly 80 % of our cases after receiving the standard treatment.....

Cerebral hypoperfusion: All included patients showed brain hypoperfusion, mainly in the capsulo-thalamic area of one and/or of the two temporal lobes. The fermented papaya preparation normalized hypoperfusion in nearly 90 % of the cases. In one case where Ginko Biloba (Tanakan ®) revealed to be inefficient, the fermented papaya preparation proved to be effective. In another case, the reverse was observed. There might be therefore no cross-resistance between the two natural product preparation. This remains to be confirmed in a further clinical study.

Antioxidant defenses: The level of antioxidant defenses in the blood of EHS patients was carefully evaluated before and after treatment. Several patients expressed lower antioxidant defenses, as evidenced in particular by an increase in nitrotyrosine blood levels. Unexpectedly, the fermented papaya preparation did not correct the antioxidant defense deficiency. Research continues by testing the antioxidant effect of other products, such as L -carnosine, a dipeptide which seems to be associated with antioxidant and heavy metal detoxifying effects.

Vitamin D deficiency: A strong vitamin D2 - D3 deficiency has been observed before treatment in many patients. The fermented papaya preparation did not correct such a deficiency. The action mechanisms of the deficiency still remain unknown, since a lack of sun exposure is not an issue here.

Micronutrient and other vitamin deficiency: No vitamin deficiency other than vitamin D2 - D3 was observed. Only a zinc deficiency was observed, not corrected by fermented papaya; the mechanism of which is also unknown..ARTAC’s current research now focuses on zinc supplementation.

In summary, although fermented papaya appears to be an effective cerebral revasculator, therefore improving patient clinical condition (decrease in headache and cognitive impairment), when used alone it does not usually give a complete clinical response nor leads to a normalization of biological parameters such as antioxidant defense levels, vitamin D and zinc blood levels. This leads ARTAC and ECERI to study the effects of fermented papaya in combination with other products such as vitamin D, zinc and L-carnosine in the framework of a randomized comparative clinical trial testing this combination neuro therapy compared with our current standard EHS-MCS treatment protocol.""

400 mg of SAM-e costs almost as much as 200 mg of SAM-e. It would be less expensive to buy 400 mg SAM-e, cut the tablets in half if you need a lower dose and buy the cofactors separately. The cofactors are inexpensive.

SAMe 400 mg by Jarrow:

A forum member commented on taking creatine.

Freddd commented:

""I have found that to have myelin repair that I need active b12s (methylb12, adb12), methylfolate, omega 3 fish oils, the full range of vitamins and minerals and several critical cofactors supplements. The most variable factor is if the problem is in the brain and spinal cord, ie subacute combined degeration. This is really my only continuing problem and it is very response to sufficient quantities of mb12. For me it takes 10mg of methylb12 subcutaneous injection 3 times a day and then only certain batches of methylb12 work. People with CFS/FMS/Alzheimer's have been found to have very depressed CSF/CNS cobalamin levels compared to the rest of the population and generally require larger doses to penetrate the cerebral spinal fluid and induce healing. Right now I am trying to trace down what makes the mb12 so variable. I have actual experience in this type of healing. This thread will be informative.""

""How to interpret the increase in anti-O-myelin, anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp27 auto-antibodies?
Protein can be modified by oxidation. Extensive oxidative leads to denaturation and loss of biological activity, while initial step of oxidation may change their specificity due to the chemical alteration of the paratope*.

Our hypothesis is that under the influence of electric and/or electromagnetic fields and/or chemicals, oxidation of cerebral proteins may progress to auto-immunoreactivity leading to the occurence of auto-antibodies against O-myelin and the chaper one proteins Hsp70 and Hsp27, which therefore lose their cell defensive properties.

**Anti-HSP27**

""Heat shock proteins (HSP) are expressed in response to various biological stresses, including high temperatures. There are several major families of HSPs including HSP70, HSP90 and HSP100. HSP27 also referred to as the Estrogen-Regulated 24K protein and HSP28, is one of several small heat shock proteins (HSP) produced by all organisms studied. HSP27 synthesis is induced by elevated temperature, as well as estrogen in hormone responsive cells.""

Below is an excerpt from Dr. Belpomme’s May 18, 2015 opening talk at the 5th Paris Appeal Conference on MCS and EHS in Brussels, where he identified certain bio markers for EHS.

Dr. Belpomme:

“… I suggest that we distinguish at the clinicobiological and nosological level, as shown on Table 1, what falls under intolerance and susceptibility, whether genetic and/or epigenetic, of hypersensitivity itself, the latter being considered as a separate entity. It is undoubtedly for these different reasons that an international consensus, taken up in parts by WHO6, has proposed to use the more general term, idiopathic environmental intolerance7, although, as David Gee told me, the term “idiopathic” is inconsistent with that of “environmental”. In an attempt to correct this antagonism, ECERI and ISDE decided to organize this international congress focusing on electrohypersensitivity and multiple chemical sensitivity so that WHO may size up the delay in not recognizing this pathology at a medical and scientific level. Indeed, both conditions, and more particularly, as shown in Figure 1, electrohypersensitivity, constitute a growing global problem, and it would be irresponsible not to take them into consideration in terms of public health and more particularly, in terms of their nosological insertion in the international classification of diseases, taking into account scientific advances over recent years.

“For there is no doubt that the causal links resulting from epidemiological case-control studies only or from provocation trials can never provide the solution because in both cases, patients suffer from severe cognitive impairment. This explains why any study based on interviews or questionnaires can only be of little objective scientific value. And, from WHO’s perspective, this is probably where the problem comes from, a problem that can only be circumvented by the highlighting of biomarkers in both animals and humans.

“This is the challenge we face in this congress, whose objectives are threefold: (1) to create an independent international working group intended to develop the nosological framework of idiopathic environmental intolerance, in order for it to shed its empty shell, deprived of clinical and biological meaning, and therefore integrate what electrohypersensitivity and multiple chemical sensitivity really are; (2) to draft for WHO an international declaration offering to put results of this working group at their disposal and inviting them to specify where they stand based on the new scientific data currently available; (3) and finally to relay to international authorities and media the international appeal coordinated by Elizabeth Kelley, entitled “Scientists Call for Protection from Non-Ionizing Electromagnetic Field Exposure”, an appeal which will be presented and discussed here by Magda Havas9.”

Clinical and biological description of the electromagnetic field intolerance syndrome (EMFIS)

Between May 2008 and March 2010, 425 patients reporting hypersensitivity to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) were examined in a clinical and biological setting.

Ninety-five per cent of them clearly reported the repeated occurrence and disappearance of symptoms linked to the presence or absence of EMFs.

Three clinical phases were distinguished:

an initial stage during which EMF exposure can induce headaches, a [u]sensation of heating in the ear and other parts of the body, especially the upper part of the body, tinnitus, ocular abnormalities, myalgia, and, in some cases, dermatitis and symptoms such as chest tightness, palpitations, tachycardia and nausea. [/u]

A second phase is characterized by insomnia, chronic fatigue and depressive tendencies, attention deficit, troubles with concentration, immediate memory loss, behavioral problems, and anxiety, during which the initial symptoms may occur every time the patient is exposed to EMF sources.

In addition to the detection of brain vascular hypo-perfusion (decreased blood flow in certain areas of the brain), predominantly in the limbic area, blood tests revealed increased histamine levels in 36% of patients, an increase in heat shock proteins in 45%, a decreased level of melatonin in 33%, and vitamin D deficiency in 70% of patients.

Specific observations and tests were also included, proving that cerebral suffering was due to EMFs.

There is a third phase, suggesting that an EMF intolerance syndrome may correspond to a pre-Alzheimer?s disease state.

In a recent interview (September 2010), Pr Belpomme stated that 'there is an important link between electromagnetic fields and neuro-degenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer s.

The risk of Alzheimer s, which can arise in young persons from age 45, is moreover much more important than the risk of cancer.'

The therapy for treating persons suffering from EMFIS includes prescription of omega 3 s, anti-oxidants, vitamin D, and anti-histamines.

Excerpts from Metro-France interview with Prof. Dominique Belpomme, President, ARTAC, September 2010

There is a proven link between electromagnetic fields, cancer and leukemia.

We (ARTAC and our Swedish colleagues) also studied an important link to neuro-degenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer s. The risk of Alzheimer s, which can appear in young persons from age 45, is much greater than the cancer risk.

Since last year, in my consultations in environmental medicine, I have been seeing between 10-20 sick persons every week. More and more parents are coming to see me for their children who have headaches, memory, concentration and language problems, and dyslexia.

This is a major public health risk. There is a neuro-generative pathology probably linked to the opening of the blood-brain barrier through EM waves and/or toxic substances. These troubles can be minor, such as headaches, or much more serious such as the beginning of Alzheimer s.

Based on the more than 400 persons who have consulted me, we have established a diagnostic test which rests essentially on a cerebral pulsed echodoppler technique and on blood tests.

These permit us to see evidence of an increase in certain stress proteins which translate into the existence of brain pathology.

We have established treatment to make these symptoms regress, however this does not prevent a recurrence.

Thus, there is the necessity of adding protective measures to this treatment: creation of 'white zones', notably in public establishments and in public transport.

We must do as for smoking: forbid Wi-Fi in certain zones, as in libraries.

We must forbid installation of relay antennas near nurseries and schools.

These are urgent protective measures to be taken, but are unfortunately not being applied.

My discourse goes against financial and economic interests, but one should not sacrifice the well-being of these sick persons for the interests of political and public authorities.

A major public health risk exists. Studies show that from 10 to 50% of the population could be affected by intolerance to EM fields in the next 25-50 years.

We will have to pay the consequences if we do not take precautionary and preventive measures now.

There are many doctors who do not recognize this pathology and thus, deny the evidence. But a growing number understand that something is happening and refer sick persons to me.

It is they whom we should rely on and that is why I am organizing in April 2011, the Third Colloquium of the Paris Appeal at UNESCO, which will be followed by an intensive course to train professionals in environmental pathologies.

(Note: 300 doctors, researchers and health professionals attended the Colloquium on 'Children's Health and the Environment' and 43 doctors and health professionals followed the course in environmental medicine.)

http://www.csn-deutschland.de/blog/en/tags/multiple-chemical-sensitivity/
 
In several countries EHS, MCS and fibromyalgia are already classified as functional disabilities
 
Several experts from different European countries agree that Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity is a real, physical illness and for some of them this condition seems to be strictly related to Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS). This is what came out of the congress **Mobile Telephony, Wi-Fi, Wi-Max: Are there Health Risks?**  

http://international-emf-alliance.org/images/pdf/Congress_EMF_AMICA_2011.pdf, 

held at Palazzo Marini – Chamber of Deputees in Rome on 14 June 2011. The event, organized by the Association for Environmental and Chronic Toxic Injury (A.M.I.C.A.), was meant to give an overview on the health dangers linked to the use of wireless devices
 
VIDEO
Prof. Belpomme speaks  about MCS  and  EI
 
Prof. Dominique Belpomme, Oncologist, Professor of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Necker-Enfants Malades, Chairman of Research for Anti-Cancer Therapeutics (ARTAC), in his lecture **Diagnostic and Therapeutic Protocols for Electromagnetic Fields Intolerance**, showed the results of a clinical observation on more than 450 patients enrolled from 2008 to 2011. He and his team use a new technique to make the diagnosis to people reporting reactions to electromagnetic fields, a condition that he prefers to define as **Electromagnetic Fields Intolerance* or **EFI Syndrome** rather than 
**Electromagnetic Hyper-Sensitivity**.
 
The new technique is the **Pulsed Eco-Doppler”**of the brain that combines the eco-doppler with a computer to evaluate brain perfusion. Unlike some other methods, this one is not dangerous and it does not involve any ionizing radiation. The results show that people with Electromagnetic Fields Intolerance have a reduced perfusion in the brain, particularly in the left part of the limbic area of the brain, compared to the control group. This is a very particular area, because it is the **ancient** part of the brain that controls many body functions.
 
**These results are very important – Belpomme said at the congress – because for the first time we are able to define the Electromagnetic Fields Intolerance as a physical illness based on objective tests**.
 
His team uses also other tests, such as the dosage of histamine, of protein S100B, and of heat shock proteins hsp70 and hsp27 in the blood. The 70% of the group of patients observed showed a serious reduction of vitamin D, about 1-2% of the patients showed an increase of proteins hsp27 and hsp70, while more than the 40% of the sample had increased histamine, a fact that is fully compatible with a physiological interpretation of this syndrome.
 
About 10% of the patients had an increased protein S100B, which is a marker for Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability. In one third of the sample, a reduction of melatonin in urine was found, and this can explain symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia and depression in these patients.
 
These alterations are quite similar to the ones found in patients with  Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS)  http://www.csn-deutschland.de/DIMDI_MCS_2008_de-en.pdf,  particularly regarding the brain perfusion reduction, the neurogenic inflammation, the oxidative stress increase, and the reduction of the defense mechanism. The fact that EMF induces the opening of the BBB may interfere with the brain protection from toxic chemicals. It is not uncommon, in fact, that patients with EFI Syndrome have MCS symptoms, while many patients with MCS also react to EMF.
 
The increase of oxidative stress in electrosensitive patients was found also by Dr. Valeria Pacifico, who lectured in Rome about **Metabolic biomarkers of oxidation-reduction imbalance and susceptibility to non-ionizing radiation**. She works in the team of Dr. Chiara De Luca at the Experimental Laboratory BILARA at Istituto Dermopatico of Immaculata in Rome that published several works on the role of oxidative stress in environmental sensitivities. (1, 2)
 
**To make a diagnosis of this syndrome we need to listen first to patients and we need to verify if the symptoms improve or disappear when they stay away from EMF sources**, Prof. Belpomme explained. In order to demonstrate if the electromagnetic fields were the real cause of the alterations found in these patients, the patients had to repeat the tests before and after a period of avoidance of EMF for three months. The results show that after the period of avoidance the levels tend toward the normal standard.
 
Given the strong correlation found by six epidemiologic studies on EMF exposure and Alzheimer Disease (AD), Prof. Belpomme believes that any electrosensitive patient with memory dysfunctions should be evaluated also for AD. He stresses the fact that AD is a loss of long term memory while EFI Syndrome often involves the loss of short term memory, but this symptom may be considered as a pre-Alzheimer condition.
 
Prof. Olle Johansson, Assoc. Prof., The Experimental Dermatology Unit, Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute; Professor, The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, talked in Rome about **The precautionary principle: from Bioinititive to the Seletun consensus**. He dedicated his lecture to people affected by EHS and MCS because **they have a very difficult life**.
 
He is one of the most dedicated scientists in the promotion of new biologically-based safety guidelines for EMF. He was in Benevento for the ICEMS resolution in 2006, then in London in 2007 for a new resolution, and he was also member of the group of independent scientists that published the famous Bioinitiative Report in 2007, which had strong ecological concern in the political agenda. Thanks to this report, in fact, the European Parliament signed a resolution on September 4, 2008 to state that the actual safety limits for EMF are obsolete and to warn EU governments about the increase of new environmental illnesses such as EHS, MCS and Dental Amalgam Mercury Syndrome.
 
More recently, Prof. Johansson was part of the group of scientists who prepared the Seletun Consensus, published last February in Reviews on Environmental Health (3). It states that present standards do not protect global human population from electromagnetic fields and all EMF should be reduced now instead of waiting for a definitive proof of danger. It also states that people reporting EHS symptoms should be considered as having a functional disability.
 
In Sweden, for example, EHS, MCS and fibromyalgia are already classified as functional disabilities. This means that people affected by these conditions are not considered patients, but it’s the environment that creates limitations for them so it’s the environment that has to be changed. This kind of classification represents the full concretization of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed by governments on March 30, 2007. This convention should be enough to push all governments to find the right accommodation and the best welfare strategies for people with environmental sensitivities, and put an end to discrimination.

Dopamine deficiency also leads to elevated cytotoxic glutamate levels.

-We see and will continue to see a trend of disease explosion - especially of the brain, immune system and heart.

-The paleo and ancestral people -Chris Kresser, Rob Wolf, Matt Lalonde and Jimmy Moore don't focus on the important things. 

-We get too much blue light.

-We need more DHA if we get less sun.

-We need more DHA and 'good' water if we're exposed to EMFs.

Until such requirement is passed by law the manufactures will not do this “because a couple of dollars extra” could cause loss of corporate profits.

Please remember that air pollution is much less now than before we required catalytic converters on all autos and trucks. The sophisticated pollution control systems on modern vehicles actually reduced performance, mileage and increased the vehicle cost but it was worth it to get cleaner air for all of us. The same must be done for all electronic devices and the standards must be based on human health instead of corporate profits.

Sam Milham found reduced levels of the neurotransmitters phenylethylamine (PEA) and dopamine in librarians. After measuring dirty electricity and installing dirty electricity filters, PEA and dopamine levels increased.

**My Dopamine Levels**

My father and my father's mother died from parkinson's disease. People with parkinson's disease have deficient dopamine. 

I was concerned I was at risk of parkinson's disease. In 2005, I started asking my holistic physician for neurotransmitter tests.

From 2005 through the present, Pharmasan Lab's optimal range for dopamine in the day time is 125 - 175. Night time 80 - 120.

September 2005  84.3 Below optimal level.

Rhodiola and St. Johnswort increase dopamine. I started taking the tinctures. 

April 2009 157.8  Optimal. Taking rhodiola and St Johnswort tinctures increased my dopamine level from 84.3 to 157.8.

May 2013 170.8. Optimal. Continued taking rhodiola and St Johnswort tinctures.

July 2015 123.7  Dropped below optimal level. 
Continued taking rhodiola tincture and St Johnswort tincture. 

From 2013 to 2015, my dopamine level declined from 170.8 to 123.7. This increases risk of parkinson's disease. 

Does EMF deplete dopamine due to dopamine protecting from EMF?

**Synthesis of dopamine**

The amino acid tyrosine creates dopamine. July 2015 Genova Diagnostics amino acid test reported my tyrosine level was 51. Reference range is 33 - 124. My dopamine deficiency is not due to tyrosine.

Cofactors that aid tyrosine to create dopamine are vitamin B6. SpectraCell Lab reported my B6 is normal.  My dopamine deficiency is not due to cofactors.

**Deficiency of Omega 3 causes dopamine deficiency**

'Polyunsaturated fatty acid associations with dopaminergic indices'

http://ijnp.oxfordjournals.org/content/ijnp/17/3/383.full.pdf

""Low omega-3 fatty acid diets diminish dopamine levels, a monoaminegeric neurotransmitter. In 2000, a study by Zimmer et al. observed rats fed an n-3 fatty acid poor diet had a 90% reduction of dopamine released in their brains and mild damage to the dopaminergic synaptic vesicles (2). The neurotransmitter was unable to trigger communication signals to the next neuron. Similarly in a 1998 article in the Journal of Nutrition by Chalon, S. et al., rats fed a fish oil diet had a great grain capacity than those fed a control diet. The rats consuming higher quantities of fish oil had 40% greater dopamine levels in the frontal lobes (2). Scarce dopamine levels in human brain frontal lobes induce neurocognitive functions such as memory, problem solving, and attention are negatively affected.....Chronic dietary deficiencies in n-3 fatty acids have also found a 40-75% decrease in dopamine levels (2, DeLion et al).""

http://parkinsonsinstitutesarasota.com/dopamine-and-dha/ 

www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071126110453.htm

Cognitive decline can be induced by deficiency in omega 3 which causes deficiency of dopamine: 

""The n-3 fatty acid-deficient rats had reduced tissue levels of dopamine in the ventral striatum and enhanced levels of the metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in frontal cortex and hypothalamus. In summary, this study demonstrates that rats with low brain DHA have a deficit in spatial reversal learning that could be related to changes in dopamine transmission in critical brain circuits. ""

People with parkinson's have decreased reduced glutathione (GSH):

Magnetic fields have not been found to cause parkinson's.  No studies have been performed on electrical fields and dirty electricity and parkinson's.

Computers emit dirty electricity. ""Computer programmers had a younger age at PD diagnosis, and risk of diagnosis &lt; or =50 was greater in computer programmers and technicians."" From 'Occupation and parkinsonism in three movement disorder clinics'

www.neurology.org/content/65/9/1430

Parkinson's may also be caused by the blue light emitted by LCD screens. Blue light reduces melatonin and tyrosine. Tyrosine and B6 synthesize dopamine:

""prolonged bright light exposure of rats induces production of neuromelanin and reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the substantia nigra......Given that the average person may work or look at a computer display for hours on a daily basis, it is possible that some light could reach the substantia nigra. As a matter of fact, computer programmers tend to be diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at a younger age compared to other patients, and risk of diagnosis in patient 50 years old or younger is greater in computer programmers [15]. The peak at 706 nm in the LCD monitor analysed is very small; nonetheless, it should be considered that other LCD monitor, which are manufactured with back fluorescent light, a special light source necessary to produce a visible image, have a higher peak in this wavelength range [16].

Important to stop looking at blue light after sunset.

This month, Pharmasan Lab performed a timed melatonin test. My melatonin levels are normal. Possibly because I take rhodiola and St johnswort tinctures? Possibly because I am sunbathing and earthing barefoot. 

**My glutathione tests**

I have had several glutathione tests performed by Genova Lab and SpectraCell Lab. I am deficient in glutathione. Supplementing with cysteine, a precursor of glutathione, and B6, which is a cofactor, did not raise my glutathione levels. 

Supplementing with glutathione capsules did not. Supplementing with glutathione sublingual tablets by Douglas Labs did.  Liquid liposomal glutathione has a greater absorption rate. The sublingual glutathione or the liquid glutathione raised my glutathione to normal. If I go off glutathione, my level drops. I continue to take glutathione. Last month's SpectraCell test reported normal glutathione level. the past month, i was applying glutathione dermally.

**Treatment**

Some of the herbs ayurvedic practitioners prescribe for EMF are the same they prescribe for parkinson's: jatamansi and brahmi.

http://zamorins.com/Parkinson-ayurvedic-treatment.html

My doctor prescribed liquid liposomal glutathione because it has better absorption than dermal and sublingual.

Take omega 3.  Continue taking rhodiola and St. johnswort tinctures. Take mucana pruriens. L-DOPA is found in significant concentrations in mucuna pruriens. Take jatmansi and brahmi.

Continue sun bathing and earthing barefoot.

Sam Milham found reduced levels of the neurotransmitters PEA and dopamine in librarians. Installing dirty electricity filters reduced dirty electricity and elevated PEA and dopamine in librarians.

Living near cell phone towers reduce PEA and dopamine:

""The levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine dropped by 50 percent during the first six months and never recovered to base level.

 Phenylethylamine (PEA) increased some during the first six months and then dropped to 50 percent of the original level by the 18 month mark.  Especially the children and chronically ill adults were the most affected.  PEA is made in our bodies from dopamine, noradrenalin, adrenalin and other compounds.  
When more of the stress hormones adrenalin and noradrenalin are secreted, it can cause the PEA level to go down.  PEA is very fat soluble and thus can easily pass through the blood-brain barrier, so the levels in the blood and the brain are similar.  PEA is important for psychological illnesses.  Depressed patients tend to have low PEA levels while manic patients tend to have high PEA levels in their blood.  PEA has an effect similar to amphetamine.  Children with ADD or ADHD usually have low levels of PEA.  Children with ADHD are sometimes prescribed drugs with amphetamine-like effects to normalize the PEA levels in their urine.""

In 2005, Pharmasan stated optimal levels for PEA in daytime are 175 - 350.  At night 150 - 300.

Sam Milham discussed there is no study of what average neurotransmitters levels are in populations not exposed to EMF. We do not know what truly are optimal levels and average levels.

In 2009, Pharmasan lowered the optimal levels. Why? Did the levels for norm decrease due to an increase of EMF? 

2009 optimal levels of PEA in the daytime are 30 - 70. Night is 21 - 50. Reference range of PEA is 15 - 87.

I have had four urine neurotransmitter tests by Pharmasan Labs. My PEA levels in the morning were:

September 2005  122.2
Dumb phone. I used a laptop to connect to the internet. No wifi at home.


April 2009  45.6 
Dumb phone. I used a netbook to connect to internet. No wifi and no smart meter at home. Before power line hacking and zombie zapping.


May 2013  44.0 
In 2012, I purchased my first 3G smartphone, a Palm Pre 2 but continued using a dumb phone plan without data. I rarely had the wifi or 3G turned on. I had used my netbook, laptop, raspberry pi or a wired library computer to connect to the internet. No wifi and no smart meter at home. After commencement of power line hacking and zombie zapping.



July 2015   6.7 
In beginning of 2014, I started using an unactivated Android's wifi to connect to the internet. My HP Compaq laptop, Toshiba Presario laptop and Android were being hacked so severely, I was forced to use wired library computers. I continued using an activated Palm Pre 2 as a dumb phone. 

In September 2014, I started purchasing Motorola Droid 3 phones and Droid 4 phones to use wifi. I purchased a data plan. Wifi and smart meter at home. Online hacking decreased. I stopped using netbooks or laptops or wired library computers to connect to the internet.  Before using a dirty electricity filter and an iron griddle underneath my laptop. A month after wearing an iron pot to protect my brain while sleeping and eating dark chocolate which contains PEA.



From 2005 through 2013, I had a normal level of PEA. In 2015, 
my PEA sharply decreased from 44 to 6.7 which is below optimal.



**PEA protects brain**

PEA becomes depleted by protecting from EMF. PEA protects the brain:

**Biomarkers of inflammation**

The cognitive decline that EMF, dirty electricity and zombie zapping induce could possibly be early alzheimer's disease. How to test whether the cognitive decline I sustained is early alzheimer's? The biomarkers of alzheimer's disease involves a spinal tap which I am not willing to do.

Alzheimer's is caused by inflammation of the brain. EMF causes inflammation of the brain. Tests for systemic inflammation are C reactive protein and fibrinogen. These tests are not specific for alzheimer's but do indicate over all inflammation in the body.

These tests were included in a panel by Health Diagnostics Lab. In July 2015, my C-reactive protein was 2.1. Optimal range is less than 1. My level is in the intermediate risk of 1.0 - 2.9.

My fibrinogen level is 496. Optimal range is 126 - 437. My fibrinogen is in the intermediate risk range of 438 - 517.

**Anti inflammatory herbs**

Ayurvedic medicine practitioners prescribe several ayurvedic herbs to treat EMF, including turmeric and holy basil. They are anti inflammatory.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/3i5y56/vitamin_d_curcumin_turmeric_support_clearing_of/


Taking turmeric tincture is not enough.  I will increase turmeric and start taking holy basil tincture.


**Vitamin D clears amyloid plaque.**

For the first time in my life, I am deficient in vitamin D. For years, I walked my dog several times a day every day around the neighborhood. In the beginning of July 2015, I started driving to dog parks and dog beaches to sit in the sun and to earth by walking barefoot win ocean waves and dew hile my dog played with other dogs.




Yet, my vitamin D level was ? Optimal level is?. I will ask my physician to retest me the end of Indian summer.


**Synthesis of PEA**

The amino acid phenylalanine synthesizes PEA. In July 2015, I had an amino acid test by Genova Labs. My phenylalanine level was 46.  Reference range is 26 - 71. My phenylalanine level was normal. My PEA deficiency is not due to phenylalanine.

B6 is a cofactor required in addition to phenylalanine to synthesize PEA.  ""Phenylethylamine 2 PEA is a biogenic amine obtained by decarboxylation of phenylalanine. The coenzyme of this reaction is vitamin B6.""

www.encognitive.com/node/11425

EMF depletes B6:


""Exposure of rats to 570 µW/cm 2, 2 GHz, for 15 days (3 hr./day) led to a decrease in vitamin B6 levels in blood, brain, liver, kidney, and heart; the levels of the vitamin in skeletal muscle increased"".

www.biotele.com/EL/EL8/Intermed.html

B6 protects from alzheimer's. Depletion of B6 is another way EMF can cause alzheimer's disease:

Last week, I started taking 50 mg of B6. My physician prescribed pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6.


**Treatment Plan**

After taking the rest of the bottle of B6, switch to pyridoxal phosphate. Buy PEA. Increase turmeric tincture. Start holy basil tincture.

Cease using unactivated android phones as PDAs. Return to using my old netbooks. Remove the battery from my activated Droid 3 3G phone. Reinsert battery to make phone calls.

Wear an EMF shielding hat during the daytime. Continue wearing iron pot in bed. Construct an EMF shielding canopy over my bed.
After summer ends, eat foods that have vitamin D.
Get retested in several months.

In 1996, the FCC adopted the IEEE 1991[11] standard with some details from the 1986 NCRP Report [12] as exposure limits in the United States. Nineteen years after the FCC exposure limits were published, based on documents published 24 and 29 years previously, the legal exposure limit has remained unchanged. Yet during these decades an enormous body of scientific studies was published reporting risk well below the legal exposure limit.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) is an industry professional organization, as is the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP). Neither organization had medical or public health expertise.

In European countries and a few other countries, the exposure limits are based on the 1998 “Guidelines” of the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) [13]. These “Guidelines” were based on publications from 1984, 1987, 1991, and 1993 [page 494]. That is the “Guidelines” were based on publications up to 31 years ago, Similar to the IEEE and NCRP, ICNIRP is an organization without medical or public health expertise. It is accountable to no government and its funding sources are not transparent.

1.4.1 The 19 year old IEEE and 17 year old ICNIRP exposure limits are based on a false premise

The exposure limits are premised on an assumption that the only biological effect from MWR exposure is acute (short-term) heating sufficient to cause tissue damage. There is no consideration of the effects from chronic (long-term) exposures. There are many scientific papers that report biological impacts tied with non-thermal (no measurable temperature change) effects. Indeed, the 480-page IARC Monograph 102 that documents the science that led to the declaration that MWR is a Class 2B (possible) carcinogen is a virtual compendium of such papers [14].

1.4.2 FCC compliance requirements do not comport with current testing systems

The FCC requires “For purposes of evaluating compliance with localized SAR guidelines, portable devices should be tested or evaluated based on normal operating positions or conditions” [15]. But phones are not tested in pants or shirt pockets. As a result every cellphone manual has warnings that the phone should be kept at various distances from the body otherwise the human exposure limits can be exceeded.

Here are two of many examples:

(1) The BlackBerry Torch 9800 Smart Phone warns, “keep the BlackBerry device at least 0.98 in. (25 mm) from your body (including the abdomen of pregnant women and the lower abdomen of teenagers).” “Lower abdomen” is an oblique reference to testicles and “abdomen of pregnant women” is an oblique reference to the fetus.

(2) The iPhone 5's manual is embedded within the phone: Users must go to “Settings,” and scroll down to “General,” then scroll to the bottom to “About,” go to “Legal,” scroll down to “RF [MWR] Exposure” where it reads, “To reduce exposure to RF energy, use a hands-free option, such as the built-in speakerphone, the supplied headphones, or other similar accessories. Carry iPhone at least 10 mm away from your body to ensure exposure levels remain at or below the as-tested [exposure limit] levels.”

1.4.3 There is a 20cm distance rule for tablets and laptop computers
“For purposes of these requirements mobile1 devices are defined by the FCC as transmitters designed to be used in other than fixed locations and to generally be used in such a way that a separation distance of at least 20 cm is normally maintained between radiating structures and the body of the user or nearby persons” [16].

Clearly, this 20 cm rule contradicts the “normal operating position” regulation in the description “a separation distance of at least 20 cm is normally maintained.” Indeed, “laptop” computer directly implies that it is to be placed on a lap which is not 20 cm distant from the user.

The growing use of tablets by young children in schools contradicts these normal tested conditions as well, as these children have shorter arms that do not allow them to hold devices 20 cm from their bodies.""

""Boosting the level of PEA Some of the literature suggests that oral administration of PEA will be rather ineffective, since not much will reach the brain. On the other hand there are plenty of studies showing PEA is more effective than conventional pain killers, so it must be reaching the brain.

Research indicates that PEA is deactivated by a special protein (N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase) and it is possible to block the action of this protein and hence raise the level of PEA. 
The full paper is here:-

Selective N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acidamidase inhibition reveals a key role for endogenous palmitoylethanolamide in inflammation
A cynic would point out that since PEA cannot be patented – it is naturally occurring substance – the pharmaceutical industry would prefer to find a patentable substance, to be the adopted therapy, rather than PEA itself. In the meantime the logical way forward would be just to eat some. Well, dark chocolate is rich in PEA, but you might have to eat quite a lot of it. The alternative is a pill. There is quite a choice.""

""Their results have been consistent and alarming: not only does radiation from a cell phone damage the blood-brain barrier, but it does so at even when the exposure level is reduced a thousandfold. Even more disturbingly, and contrary to what was expected, the damage to the blood-brain barrier worsened when the experimenters reduced the exposure level. The implies that SAR ratings for cell phones may be worthless and that it may not be possible to make cell phones safer by reducing their power.

In laboratory rats, Salford’s team has demonstrated that blood-brain barrier leakage occurs after only two minutes of exposure. Further, a single two-hour exposure to a cell phone, even at reduced power, was shown to damage or destroy up to two percent of an animal’s brain cells.""

A permeable blood brain barrier would enable bacteria and viruses to cross the BBB. Only antibiotics and antivirals that can cross the BBB would be able to treat the infections.

A permeable blood brain barrier would make it easier for biological warfare, which was developed to penetrate the brain, to do so. Bacterial, such as the Nazi and later CIA developed lyme and viruses, such as AIDS, do cross the BBB.

""confirming MCS altered (P &lt; 0.05-0.0001) glutathione-(GSH), GSH-peroxidase/S-transferase, and catalase erythrocyte activities. We first described comparable-though milder-metabolic pro-oxidant/proinflammatory alterations in EHS with distinctively increased plasma coenzyme-Q10 oxidation ratio. Severe depletion of erythrocyte membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids with increased ω 6/ ω 3 ratio was confirmed in MCS, but not in EHS. We also identified significantly (P = 0.003) altered distribution-versus-control of the CYP2C19∗1/∗2 SNP variants in EHS, and a 9.7-fold increased risk (OR: 95% C.I. = 1.3-74.5) of developing EHS for the haplotype (null)GSTT1 + (null)GSTM1 variants. Altogether, results on MCS and EHS strengthen our proposal to adopt this blood metabolic/genetic biomarkers' panel as suitable diagnostic tool for SRI.""

Magnesium is a co-factor of glutatione. Gluthatione requires magnesium for its synthesis. www.life-enthusiast.com/magnesium-and-glutathione-a-4695.html

www.lampoflife1.blogspot.com/p/glutathione-and-magnesium.html

Deficiency of glutathione reduces protection from EMR, toxic chemicals and heavy metals. People with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) sustain chemical injuries from toxic chemicals below EPA's Permissible Exposure Level (PEL) and OSHA's Threshold Limit Value (TLV). People with MCS have glutathione deficiency and liver enzyme deficiency including PON1 deficiency. 

Their liver's ability to detoxify is compromised.

Toxic exposures can permanently inhibit synthesis of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and liver enzymes. Once acquired, 50% change offspring inherits MCS. Genova Lab offers a genetic DetoxiGenomic test. https://www.gdx.net/product/detoxigenomic-genomic-testing-saliva

A significant percentage of MCS people are EMF sensitive. Perhaps because they are already deficient in magnesium and glutathione which toxic chemicals deplete and EMF further deplete.

**EMF INDUCE MIGRAINES**

EMF is known to cause headaches and insomnia. EMR alters brain proteins which can cause headaches: ""This study is anticipated to throw light in the understanding of such health effects like headaches, dizziness, sleep disorders, memory disorders, brain tumors, all of them related to the function of the altered brain proteins,"" and which ""permanently destroys…the manufacturing of these proteins [and] completely changes the human organism.""

1½ years ago, /u/BadBiosSavior was being hacked. He found a thread I wrote in a forum using my first account /u/badbiosvictim. Hackers changed my password and the temporary passwords I requested to reset my password timed out. Thus, I created a second account.

For two months, /u/BadBiosSavior stopped posting. When he returned, I private messaged him welcome back. He replied he had successfully eluded, relocated, found safe housing and was able to connect to the internet without being tracked. I asked how. I hope to do likewise. /u/BadBiosSavior was wary disclosing his methods would enable him to be tracked.

Last year, I posted that my music and MP3 players were infected. My music sounds like white noise is in the background. I posted forensics that my jpeg files had an audio file. /u/BadBiosSavior and I posted that word documents and PDF files can have an embedded audio object. I posted forensics on a thumbs file that had an embedded word file which probably had an embedded audio file. 

Five months ago, /u/BadBiosSavior, suggested that the buzzing I was hearing may be masked ultrasonic subliminal messages. He recommended meditating and psilocybin mushrooms to get in touch with the subliminal messages. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/2yir9p/ultrasonic_subliminal_messages/ 

/u/BadBiosSavior advice is substantiated. Psilocybin mushrooms regrow damaged brain cells. ""normally unconnected brain regions showed brain activity that was synchronized tightly in time.”  Even more interesting is the fact that this “hyperconnected” communication appears to be very stable and organized and not erratic in nature.""

www.learning-mind.com/magic-mushrooms-can-actually-rewire-and-change-your-brain/

I will grow my own magic mushrooms as I do not want to risk prosecution for violating a penal code.

I stared at a candle flame and tried to meditate. I earthed by sitting in a lawn chair with bare feet on the grass. 

None of the above counter acted the dumbing down from the nightly zombie zapping. I could not meditate.
 
In a post on the pineal gland, I cited the Ayurveda medicine article 'Electromagnetic Toxins' by Vaidya R.K. Mishra: 

""Lay down on the ground (clean sand or clay soil is the most powerful).

Walk near water (lakes or rivers) or spend time under big, green trees.""

www.layogamagazine.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=744:electromagnetic-toxins&amp;catid=169:november-2010-issue

I walked in the woods to a natural pond. I laid down on the clay soil by the pond.  Whole body earthing helped. 

Best is whole body earthing while getting a sun tan. Sunshine is much brighter than a candle flame. Sun shining on skin is more potent than being next to a sunny window. Like Zonker in Doonesbury, I have a great sun tan.


I got ""nothing."" I asked my subconscious for the meaning of ""nothing.""
""Nothing"" meant (1) I am nothing; and (2) I can do nothing.

The answers were not a voice. I do not hear voices. I do not have voice to skull (V2K), also known as Voice of God. The answers were an intuitive knowing.


1 1/2 months ago, I started wearing an iron pot over my head while sleeping to shield zombie zapping. The iron pot does partially shields zombie zapping.  Wearing an iron pot does not reduce the buzzing and 'The Hum.' Being outside does reduces the loudness and vibrational intensity of buzzing and 'The Hum.' I suspect smart meters and wiring inside walls contributes to the volume and vibrational intensity.

Last week, while wearing the iron pot, I asked if there were other subliminal messages. 

Answer: ""Nothing"" also means after I am assassinated, my work will be ""nothing."" Zombie zapping is not merely brain washing and dumbing down. Over time, zombie zapping is murder. I felt there were more subliminal messages, but I had to arise. 

(1) I am ""nothing""means my life does not matter to any one. My life is not worth living.

(2) ""I can do nothing"" means there is nothing I can do about stopping the cyber warfare and energy weapons. I cannot prevent badBIOS from infecting my new devices and storage media. I cannot successfully elude and stay safe.

Warning others does nothing. I cannot help others from being hacked, spied on and injured. No underground train to help each other to safely relocate. My posts are nothing. My posts do not incite petitions for investigations and new legislation.

(3)  After I am assassinated, my work will be ""nothing."" My posts will disappear. Websites will be hacked or taken over to be closed.  Search engine will censor my posts. My researching and posting is futile. No lasting effect. No one will benefit. Give up. Resistance is futile.

The very next day, some of my posts were removed. Precognition? The posts in /r/emfeffects were removed and a ham radio redditor requested taking over the sub. I had cross-posted my posts from /r/bad BIOS to /r/emfeffects on power line hacking and computer EMF emissions and shielding. 

A request by /u/heimeyer72 and I were rejected by /r/redditrequest. Mods confirmed first come, first serve. We created a replacement subreddit /r/electromagnetics. I cross-posted my posts. 

I am being severely hacked creating the EMF wiki in /r/electromagnetics. I discovered first hand the cover up of adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields. I asked the other mods to work on the three wikis. I am seeking more mods to safe guard the posts and help the new sub thrive as my higher priority is /r/badBIOS. I am concerned with the longevity of the posts in /r/badBIOS and /r/electromagnetics. Any recommendations?

What took me five months to write this post was conducting research. I was concerned that this post would be misconstrued as mental illness. I intended to find blogs or threads by others who explained how they got in touch with subliminal messages and analyze the subliminal messages to ascertain whether there was an over all pattern. If my subliminal messages were identical or similar, that would verify I did accurately interpret the subliminal messages.  If mine were different, I would state so. 

I also intended to find research identifying RF frequencies of ultrasound hearing and microwave audio effect and reports identifying meters that measured them.  I would buy the meters and write a report of their measurements.

After five months of research, I do not know whether my interpretation of the subliminal messages are identical or different from others' interpretation of their subliminal messages. There are very few personal articles, blogs or threads on subliminal messages.  I cannot conclude that the reason is they are not aware of ultrasonic subliminal messages as there is also  very little information on zombie zapping, meters to measure ultrasound hearing, microwave auditory effect and zombie zapping and shielding the brain and ears.

Project Artichoke functional basis was Electronic Dissolution of Memory (E.D.O.M).

Project MK-Delta ""Transmission and Reception: Television antennae, radio antennae, power lines, mattress spring coils, modulation on 60 Hz wiring.""
Since the 1960's, the US government researched and developed zombie zapping via power lines and mattress spring coils. Prior to smart meters.

Steel mattress coils and steel bed frames can emit residue magnetism after being hit by a strong magnetic field. Use of magnet spring coils implies US government zombie zapped while its citizens slept.

**Radio Hypnotic Inter Cerebral Control (RHIC)**

Project MK-Delta's pseudonym is ""Deep Sleep"", R.H.I.C.""

""In 1962, a CIA manual focused on Radio Hypnotic Inter Cerebral Control--RHIC--which was developed by the pentagon. Quote, ""when a part of your brain receives a tiny electrical impulse from outside sources such as vision, hearing, et cetera, an emotion is produced: anger at the sight of a gang of boys beating an old woman for example. The same emotions of anger can be created by artificial radio signals sent to your brain by a controller. You can instantly feel the same white-hot anger without any apparent reason."" Endquote.

Another term, Electronic Dissolution of Memory EDOM, refers to the the ability to erase memory at a distance.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3epq00/project_mkoften_was_an_attempt_by_the_cia_to/

""the CIA has developed a mind control technology they refer to as RHIC-EDOM. The acronym stands for Radio Hypnotic Intra cerebral Control - Electronic Dissolution of Memory, and refers to the ability to induce a hypnotic state from remote locations, impart hypnotic commands, and erase the memory of the programming and the period of time that it took place in This technology allegedly includes electromagnetic broadcasting as well as intramuscular implants The erasure of memory is reportedly accomplished by the electromagnetic stimulation of the chemical acetylcholine in the brain.

The first mention of RHIC-EDOM was in the 1969 book Were We Controlled? By the pseudonymous Lincoln Lawrence. Lawrence describes RHIS-EDOM in this manner:

""It is the ultra-sophisticated application of post-hypnotic suggestion triggered at will by radio transmission It is a recurring hypnotic state, reinduced automatically at intervals by the same radio control An individual is brought under hypnosis This can be done either with his knowledge - or without it by use of narco-hypnosis, which can be brought into play under many guises He is then programmed to perform certain actions and maintain certain attitudes upon radio signal.""

From 'CIA Radio Hypnotic InterCerebral Control (RHIC)' by 911InvestigationVids

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4osOLZKKae8

""Narco-hypnosis, as its name implies, is the use of various narcotics to induce various types of hypnotic states."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcosynthesis

""Applications of microwave technology in espionage were available for over 25 years. In a meeting in Berkeley of the American Association for the Advancement of Science as early as 1965, Professor J. Anthony Deutsch of New York University, provided an important segment of research in the field of memory control. In layman terms, Professor Deutsch indicated that the mind is a transmitter and if too much information is received, like too many vehicles on a crowded freeway, the brain ceases to transmit. The Professor indicated that an excess of acetyl choline in the brain can interfere with the memory process and control. He indicated excess amounts of acetyl choline can be artificially produced, through both the administration of drugs or through the use of radio waves. The process is called Electronic Dissolution of Memory (EDOM). The memory transmission can be stopped for as long as the radio signal continues.

As a result, the awareness of the person skips over those minutes during which he is subjected to the radio signal. Memory is distorted, and time-orientation is destroyed.

According to Lincoln Lawrence, author of Were We Controlled, EDOM is now operational. ""There is already in use a small EDOM generator/transmitter which can be concealed on the body of the person. Contact with this person, a casual handshake or even just a touch, transmits a tiny electronic charge plus an ultra-sonic signal tone which for a short period will disturb the time-orientation of the person affected....it can be a potent weapon for hopelessly confusing evidence in the investigation of a crime.""

www.barefootwithnature.com/2012/03/26/grounding/

""A Connection to our Bare Skin. The best way to connect to our bare skin is to use grounding mats and/or grounding sheets, however these are not cheap, they are effective but the cost could be prohibitive. Alternatives include an anti-static band, which is a strap that can be placed around your wrist or ankle, and again is effective and far more cost efficient; although it must be in connection with your bare skin to work.

An even cheap option is just a bare wire or small metal plate that you can put your foot or hand on when you want to earth yourself, for example while your sat at your computer or watching the television.""

www.barefootwithnature.com/2012/04/04/how-to-ground-yourself/

A copper plate and copper wire are best but not for sale as a kit. Copper wire or body band cord should go through an open window to be connected to a grounding rod directly in the earth instead of connected to ground port of a wall outlet.

Chris' first option of 'A Connection to the Earth':

""The first method is via a grounding rod. A grounding rod is a metal, normally copper bonded, rod that is around 1.3 metres in length (the longer the better). This is hammered into the ground so that the majority of the rod is below ground level, ideally almost all of the rod should be hammered into the ground. This is a simple, cheap and effective way or creating an electrical earth. However in order for the grounding rod to be effective it must be hammered into mud or ideally clay, it must not be hammered into or through rubble, hardcore or anything else that is not soil or clay. To do so will effectively render it useless and a good earth will not be made.

Also you must keep the rod and ground around it wet, which means that during the dry months you will have to tip a bucket of water over your grounding rod every day. If the ground around the rod becomes dry it loses its effectiveness and a good earth will not gained.

.... Once in place, your linking wire (Bridging the Gap above) is then connected to the top of the rod and run into the house to the spot where you want to ground yourself.""

www.barefootwithnature.com/2012/04/04/how-to-ground-yourself/

Likewise, earthing.com instructs to keep its rod moist:
""If you live in a dry area, such as a desert, soak the Earth around the ground rod from time to time for maximum conductivity.""

https://www.earthing.com/ground-rod-with-40-cord.html

Placing the rod on the wet edge of a water garden with a natural mud bottom, instead of a concrete bottom, would keep the rod wet. Situate water garden near your office but far from a smart meter.

To get sunshine, ground your body, meditate and absorb the vibrational remedies of water plants, soak your feet in the water garden. Lotus, blue water lily and calamus are medicinal ayurvedic and chinese herbs.
How to prevent being electrocuted by the grounding rod?

A Strokes commented:

""I would add to the pitfalls using ungrounded devices while using grounding products. An example would be using a two prong power source for your laptop instead of three with a grounding/earthing mat under your feet.
This setup cause me to be the ground for the laptop which was not good for health as you can imagine.

It took a consult from a Building Biologist (Oram Miller) in November of 2013 to identify this as a health risk for EMF exposure.

To fix the problem I properly connected the three prong power source and stopped using the grounding mat until my symptoms of heart palpitations and sounds in my ears stopped after 15 days.

Safe computing 101: Grounding products should have a warnings about using ungrounded devices such as laptops.""

http://www.electricsense.com/9616/earthing-grounding-science/#sthash.tke5LSr6.dpuf

Oram Miller's website is www.createhealthyhomes.com.

Grounding a two prong laptop by connecting it to the ground port in a wall outlet suffices only if the ground has been tested for dirty electricity and stray voltage. If the ground is not safe, use option #1 above or connect laptop to a dirty electricity filter.

**Anti-Static Bands**

An alternative to a copper plate and copper wire is an anti-static wrist band. EDS means electric-static discharge. earthing.com manufactures an 8 inch anti-static body band that is long enough to strap on the wrist or ankle and has a 20 foot coiled cord. Specifications are inadequate. No disclosure of what type of metal wire is used and what the maximum resistance is in ohms.

Earthing.com instructions:

""Insert one end of Earthing cord into ground port of a properly grounded wall outlet (third hole) or connect to cord of an Earthing ground rod placed in the Earth outside.""

https://www.earthing.com/small-orange-body-band-kit.html

Rod with 40 foot cord that connects to body band cord and instructions are at:
https://www.earthing.com/ground-rod-with-40-cord.html

A 40 foot rod cord and a 20 foot body coiled cord may not be long enough to go through a window to a desk.

Eric W commented:

""The grounding rod won't work because 40ft is too short. Plus, as is indicated on the video, if it's too close to the electrical system, it is dangerous a well. What are your thoughts on this and what the video has to say? Are you in a rural environment?""

Several months ago, I read a complaint that earthing.com refused to replace a laptop earthing pad that stopped working. Customer tested laptop earthing pad with a meter.

There is no warranty information on earthing.com. Return policy is 30 days. https://www.earthing.com/returns/
Thus, I am wary of recommending earthing.com's products. It is time consuming and difficult to find customers' complaints and reviews. Consumer Reports magazine is excellent and needs to review more products.
Here is a complaint on earthing.com's body band. Customer did not mention whether she asked earthing.com to replace it. Instead she purchased and likes the ESDProduct anti-static band:

Connie C commented:

""I bought the original wrist bands (the orange ones) from earthing.com that worked for about 1 week. Then I checked it with a body volt meter and found that it lost its earthing ability quickly- the reading was 3-4 times higher. I have been careful when using it, no oil or lotion but it is just not lasting. I now understand why so many people complaint about their earthing sheets. The build in materials are just not lasting. I tried this wrist strap. It fits and works all the time and it can be clean over and over again. One strap will last forever.""

C. Glenn commented on ESDProduct wrist strap:

""...The description indicates the wire resistance is 160 ohms Max, but also says it has a 1Megohm resistor built in. I measured 0.99 Megohms from the snap to the banana plug. As I plan to use this for earthing my body at night, I would actually like to find (or make) a replacement coiled wire without the megohm resistor. I also do some electronics work and this seems very suitable for an antistatic workstation. I like it.""

""It is uses highly conductive copper sulfide nylon thread for conductivity and it has a maximum resistance of 160 ohms.""

-- ""Lyme disease leads to demyelination - that means the nerves lose some of their protection – the nerves become much more readily affected by electromagnetic radiation""

-- ""There is a huge epidemic of chronic infections - #1 being Lyme""

-- ""Every patient I ever tested who had a diagnosis of electro-sensitivity turned out to test positive for Lyme""

Attach a long ethernet cable from modem to ethernet port on computer. Long ethernet cables are inexpensive. Disable wifi and bluetooth settings in BIOS and in software.

Do not use wifi or a router. If must use a router, unscrew antennas on router. If antennaes are not detachable, wrap with several layers of heavy duty aluminum foil.

Alternatively, air gap computer. See /r/BadBIOS` wiki for posts on how to air gap computers.

Use air gap computer to compose reddit posts, long comments, long emails, etc. Save to micro SD card. Insert Micro SD card into networked device. Turn on networked device. Post or send. Turn off networked device. Remove micro SD card and reinsert into computer.

Turn on networked device for the internet, copy long emails into a plain text file. Copy webpages to read offline as a plain test file, PDF file or html file. Download e-books and PDF files to a micro SD card. Turn off networked device. Move SD card back to air gapped computer to read emails, ebooks, PDF files and webpages.

**PDAs and tablets**

Unactivated Motorola Droid 3 and Droid 4 smartphones have a slider qwerty keyboard. They do not require a SIM card. They are terrific PDAs.
Make sure tablet supports OTG host mode to use an USB keyboard. Download mountie app from open source reposiotry f-droid.org.

Always disable bluetooth.

Always keep airplane mode on even if smartphones are not activated.

Turn wifi on when needed but keep airplane mode on. Wifi has less EMR than 3G and 4G.

Disable data. Turn airplane mode off and data on only when there is no wifi hot spot. Immediately when finished using data, turn off data and turn airplane mode back on. Another benefit is battery lasts considerably longer.

**Activated Smartphones**

Research models that emit lower EMR and buy one. Samsung models have lower EMR.

Advise for PDAs and tablets applies for smartphones.

Wifi has less EMR than cellular service. Keep airplane mode on unless expecting a phone call or need to make a call. Set up youmail. Youmail.com offers missed call and voicemail notifications via email. Keep wifi on to retrieve youmail notifications via email.

Disable vibration notification and haptic settings to decrease exposure to ultrasound.

http://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/2y1gtw/ultrasonic_shocking/

Do not wear phone on body. Store phone in backpack or purse. Increase notification volume to enaable hearing notification through a purse or backpack.

Choose a longer sound alert for notifications. Klaxon pager will repeat sound notifications of missed calls and text messages. Download Klaxon from open source repository f-droid.org.

If have to wear in pocket, place phone in Silent Pocket which shields EMR from body to protect semen and bladder. EMR causes bladder cancer and reduces sperm mobility.

Use an EMR shielding case or a forensic bag. However, they merely partially shield. See /r/badBIOS' wiki for posts on forensic bags under section titled faraday.

Do not use hard wired earbud or ear clips. The cord acts as an antenna increasing EMR up to ten times as much.

http://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/2tnjso/wired_headset_connected_to_smartphone_acts_as_an/

Do not use Bluetooth ear buds. Use hard wired earbuds with a MP3 music player that does not have wifi and bluetooth such as a Sansa Clip MP3 player. Or play music on an air gapped computer.

Instead of streaming music, rip music from CDS or download music. Ditto videos.

""The most probable brain source which might serve as the primary modulatory of these biochemical oscillators would involve structures within the thalamus (Steriade &amp; Deschenes, 1984). Neuronal aggregates with surprisingly fixed (within 0.1-Hz) oscillations are found within this structure and depend primarily upon neurons that require gamma amino butyric acid or GABA (von Krosigk, Bal, &amp; McCormick, 1993). This inhibitory amino acid is specially derived from the normal, temperature-sensitive degradation of glucose by the GABA shunt (Delorey &amp; Olsen, 1994).""

The MAC address of the ethernet chip should not be visible. How can the ethernet carrier be detected?


I unplugged the power cord to copy and paste outputs while on battery power. I plugged the power cord back in and unplugged the Greenwave dirty electricity filter. All three outputs were identical.


The OP of the ubuntu forum post outputs differ from mine. Most noteably, Ella_Bella  did not have the plugin 'ofono' after 'keyfile' in her output of /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf.

""oFono is a free software project for mobile telephony (GSM/UMTS) applications. It is built on 3GPP standards and uses a high-level D-Bus API for use by telephony applications."" 

http://dbpedia.org/page/OFono

In 2009, Intel and Nokia jointly developed ofono. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFono

In mid 2008, Lenovo introduced X200. This was half a year before 2009. Lenovo X200 should not have ofono even if it is a select X200 model that has 3G.

http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/pd013529

My two X200 laptops were not one of the select models that had one of the four 3G cards.

""oFono is sponsored by Intel and most of the project maintainers work....This project is optimized through open source for the Intel® Atom™ processors and Intel® Core™ processors."" https://01.org/ofono

Intel Atom does not have vPro. Why did Intel develop 3G VoIP for a non vPro processor?

Almost all netbooks had an Atom. In 2008, Asus introduced the concept of netbooks with their first netbook Asus 700. In the same year 2008, Asus introduced the Asus 900 netbook with an Intel 915 chipset. I could not successfully air gap my two Asus 900HA netbooks. Thus, I hypothesized commencing with Intel's 915 series chipset, Intel embedded a secret bluetooth or FM transmitter:

https://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/35m8gh/does_libreboot_removing_intel_me_deactivate/

https://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/2me1sc/does_intel_gma_915_chipset_have_a_secret/

https://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/2k1938/intel_chipsets_secret_bluetooth_in_linux_logs/

Trisquel has an ofono package. Trisquel's webpage lists Ofono's dependencies, one being bluetooth stack. Ofono uses the bluetooth stack. So does FM radio. Previously, I wrote several posts that the bluetooth stack is active and I continue to be hacked and geolocated even though I had removed or destroyed bluetooth and wifi.

http://packages.trisquel.info/en/belenos/admin/ofono

Based on ofono, I am changing my hypothesis to a secret embedded 3G chip. Did Intel start embedding 3G long before the rumor?  Does this mean the rumor that Intel Atom and Core chipsets have a secret GSM is true?  /u/SoCo_cpp and /u/Ferrofluid suggested Intel's 3G could use the ground wire as an antenna like a cave-link radio while the computer is plugged in.

https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/2dvwu4/intel_cpus_really_do_have_secret_3g_chip/

https://www.reddit.com/r/badBIOS/comments/2e3yuv/badbios_transmits_ultrasound_via_piezo_can/

Initially, I did not remove the wifi antenna when I removed the wifi and bluetooth from my netbooks. Yet, my netbooks continued to be hacked. I disassembled the screen of my Asus 1015PE netbook to remove the wifi antenna. This helped but at the time I did not understand why as the wifi antenna was no longer connected to anything. The screen bezel would not snap back together. I shipped my netbook to Asus for repair. That discouraged me from removing antennas of other netbooks and discouraged me from recommending removal the antenna in my air gapping posts.

Due to the microphone and bluetooth being situated in the bezel of Lenovo X200 laptop, I had to remove the bezel. Thus, the antenna was also removed. X200 bezel easily snapped back together. I will update air gapping post to recommend removal of the antenna.

Removal of the antenna may explain why hackers have complete control of my computers when plugged in and no control on battery power. However, on battery power within line of sight of a window or in a room with an exterior wall, they beam a MASER at my laptop to exfiltrate data.

Or did hackers implant 3G in my laptops, infect the BIOS and install ofono?

Ofono is not preinstalled in synaptic package manager.

Did Trisquel preinstall ofono? Where is Trisquel's list of preinstalled packages? It is not at 
https://trisquel.info/en/wiki/all-manuals

Does any one else have ofone in their output of etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf?

Had Intel developed ofono for its customers to use, Intel would have advertised it and we would be using it. A 3G VoIP could covertly transmit microphone and webcam feed as well as ultrasonic feed generated by badBIOS.

I am donating two air gapped lenovo X200 laptops for forsenic research. Please PM an address in United States or Canada.

""Also to have an influx of negative ions into your body, you should be positively charged. To check that, you should also measure your body voltage in DC mode and touching the probes with the correct polarity (negative to the ground, positive on you.

A copper plate and copper wire are best but not for sale as a kit. Copper wire or body band cord should go through an open window to be connected to a grounding rod directly in the earth instead of connected to ground port of a wall outlet. 

Chris' first option of 'A Connection to the Earth':

""The first method is via a grounding rod. A grounding rod is a metal, normally copper bonded, rod that is around 1.3 metres in length (the longer the better). This is hammered into the ground so that the majority of the rod is below ground level, ideally almost all of the rod should be hammered into the ground. This is a simple, cheap and effective way or creating an electrical earth. However in order for the grounding rod to be effective it must be hammered into mud or ideally clay, it must not be hammered into or through rubble, hardcore or anything else that is not soil or clay. To do so will effectively render it useless and a good earth will not be made. 

Also you must keep the rod and ground around it wet, which means that during the dry months you will have to tip a bucket of water over your grounding rod every day. If the ground around the rod becomes dry it loses its effectiveness and a good earth will not gained. 

.... Once in place, your linking wire (Bridging the Gap above) is then connected to the top of the rod and run into the house to the spot where you want to ground yourself.""

www.barefootwithnature.com/2012/04/04/how-to-ground-yourself/

Likewise, earthing.com  instructs to keep its rod moist:

""If you live in a dry area, such as a desert, soak the Earth around the ground rod from time to time for maximum conductivity.""

https://www.earthing.com/ground-rod-with-40-cord.html

Placing the rod on the wet edge of a water garden with a natural mud bottom, instead of a concrete bottom, would keep the rod wet. Situate water garden near your office but far from a smart meter.

To get sunshine,  ground your body, meditate and absorb the vibrational remedies of water plants, soak your feet in the water garden. Lotus, blue water lily and calamus are medicinal ayurvedic and chinese herbs. 

How to prevent being electrocuted by the grounding rod?

A Strokes commented:

""I would add to the pitfalls using ungrounded devices while using grounding products. An example would be using a two prong power source for your laptop instead of three with a grounding/earthing mat under your feet.

This setup cause me to be the ground for the laptop which was not good for health as you can imagine.

It took a consult from a Building Biologist (Oram Miller) in November of 2013 to identify this as a health risk for EMF exposure.

To fix the problem I properly connected the three prong power source and stopped using the grounding mat until my symptoms of heart palpitations and sounds in my ears stopped after 15 days.

Safe computing 101: Grounding products should have a warnings about using ungrounded devices such as laptops.""

Oram Miller's website is www.createhealthyhomes.com.

Grounding a two prong laptop by connecting it to the ground port in a wall outlet suffices only if the ground has been tested for dirty electricity and stray voltage.  If the ground is not safe, use option #1 above or connect laptop to a dirty electricity filter.

**Anti-Static Bands**

An alternative to a copper plate and copper wire is an anti-static wrist band. EDS means electric-static discharge. earthing.com manufactures an 8 inch anti-static body band that is long enough to strap on the wrist or ankle and has a 20 foot coiled cord. Specifications are inadequate. No disclosure of what type of metal wire is used and what the maximum resistance is in ohms.


Earthing.com instructions:

""Insert one end of Earthing cord into ground port of a properly grounded wall outlet (third hole) or connect to cord of an Earthing ground rod placed in the Earth outside."" 

https://www.earthing.com/small-orange-body-band-kit.html

Rod with 40 foot cord that connects to body band cord and instructions are at:

https://www.earthing.com/ground-rod-with-40-cord.html

A 40 foot rod cord and a 20 foot body coiled cord are not long enough to go through a window to a desk.

Eric W commented:

""The grounding rod won't work because 40ft is too short. Plus, as is indicated on the video, if it's too close to the electrical system, it is dangerous a well. What are your thoughts on this and what the video has to say? Are you in a rural environment?""

Several months ago, I read a complaint that earthing.com refused to replace a laptop earthing pad that stopped working. Customer tested laptop earthing pad with a meter. 

There is no warranty information on earthing.com. Return policy is 30 days. https://www.earthing.com/returns/

Thus, I am wary of  recommending earthing.com's products.  It is time consuming and difficult to find customers' complaints and reviews. Consumer Reports magazine is excellent and needs to review more products.

Here is a complaint on earthing.com's body band. Customer did not mention whether she asked earthing.com to replace it. Instead she purchased and likes the ESDProduct anti-static band: 

Connie C commented:

""I bought the original wrist bands (the orange ones) from earthing.com that worked for about 1 week. Then I checked it with a body volt meter and found that it lost its earthing ability quickly- the reading was 3-4 times higher. I have been careful when using it, no oil or lotion but it is just not lasting. I now understand why so many people complaint about their earthing sheets. The build in materials are just not lasting. I tried this wrist strap. It fits and works all the time and it can be clean over and over again. One strap will last forever.""


C. Glenn commented on ESDProduct wrist strap:

""...The description indicates the wire resistance is 160 ohms Max, but also says it has a 1Megohm resistor built in. I measured 0.99 Megohms from the snap to the banana plug. As I plan to use this for earthing my body at night, I would actually like to find (or make) a replacement coiled wire without the megohm resistor. I also do some electronics work and this seems very suitable for an antistatic workstation. I like it.""

""It is uses highly conductive copper sulfide nylon thread for conductivity and it has a maximum resistance of 160 ohms.""

Earthing.com's eight inch body band is long enough to strap around an ankle. I cannot find another anti-static band that is.

""Electric fields are especially a problem when you are in the vicinity of laptops and other devices when they are plugged in but ungrounded, as most laptops are (there is no problem when every cord is pulled out and you are just on the battery). Readings in excess of four to five thousand milliVolts are not uncommon when plugged in, especially when you touch the keyboard. I have several clients who feel utterly drained after sitting at such computers all day (desktop computers are always grounded, on the other hand -- provided they are plugged into a properly working grounded outlet. NO cheater plugs allowed! Get that ungrounded outlet grounded if you plug a computer into it!)""

""...We also ground ungrounded laptops, not the person, to reduce daytime electric field exposure when you use your laptop computer and similar electronic devices.

""I continue to suggest strategies to reduce electric fields for my clients in the first place. At their computer work station, this can include grounding their laptop through a printer cable to a printer with a grounded AC plug, or if they're lucky enough to have a laptop transformer with a grounded AC plug, use that.

Another solution is to plug a printer cable into a USB port on your laptop and then grab the other end (that would usually be plugged into a printer) with an alligator clip on one end of a grounding cord. Plug the other end of the cord directly into the ground socket of a properly grounded electric outlet. Most everyone has a spare printer cable, and you can purchase a grounding cable for $6 from Less EMF in Albany, New York (ask for a ""Plug to Gator""; Cat. Number F295-3; 888-537-7363).

These are the strategies that we use as building biologists. Doing these things alone will bring the body voltage down from 4-5,000 milliVolts around an ungrounded laptop to a healthy few hundred mV or less, which is usually healthy enough for daytime exposure. This residual comes from plastic AC power cords around you (replace them if you can or move them several feet away if you can't -- see Safer Use of Computers on this website) and from plastic circuits in your walls. This is without use of a grounding pad.""

There are tiny metal pieces inside the triangular heat sink. What are they? There is an aluminum plate on top of the motherboard. Aluminum is not a ferro metal. On the back of the heat sink is copper. Copper is not a ferro metal so should not increase DC magnetic readings.

I put my laptop on my lap. I plugged the power supply into laptop.  No increase. Libreboot has a bug which automatically turns laptop on when connected to AC power. A few minutes later, I can feel waves from the laptop through my thighs, down my legs to my toes. 

I place the phone back on top of the power supply. Increased to 1649 uT. This is outrageosuly high!  Power supply is extremely hot. Exact measurement needs to be verified with a hand held DC gauss meter.

Magnetometers do not measure AC magnetic fields. They measure DC magnetic fields. How are DC magnetic fields increasing?

Stray voltage and dirty electricity magnetizes the metal in furniture, phones, computers, etc.;

""DC magnetic fields can develop in many steel or iron objects if they have been exposed to magnetic fields, current, or friction.

Is there metal in a power supply?

Power supply are also referred to as transformers. 

""There are also magnetic fields around every transformer that you have plugged into the power strip. The field extends out about 1-2 feet. The solution is to move the power strip away from your feet by at least three or four feet. A little distance makes a big difference.

...Finally, if you have a laptop computer, there will be a magnetic field around the in-line transformer. Just move it as far away as the cord will allow and you should be fine.""

Oram Miller is probably referring to AC magnetic fields, not DC magnetic fields. How can DC magnetic fields be increased if there is no ferro metal? Does power supply have ferro metal?

**Readings using a three prong outlet and power strip in kitchen**

I moved to the kitchen because it is the only room in the house with three prong outlets. My phone on the dining table reads 49 uT. On top of the Trip-Lite mini power strip/ surge protector 38 uT. After waiting for the power supply to cool off, I plugged it directly into the wall. 46 uT.

I plug the power supply into surge protector. 45 uT. I plug the power supply into my laptop which is on the dining table. Reading is rapidly fluctuating between 29 - 71.
I plug power supply directly into wall. 27-63 uT. I suspect the perpetrators are refraining from assaulting because they know i am conducting this test.


USB wall charger and the USB cable in my bedroom have a high uT even when it is not connected to my smartphone. Almost a month ago, i moved into this house. Electronic assault occurred in other homes regardless whether the outlets are grounded and regardless whether I use a power strip/surge protector.

""Yes, as my tests show magnetic radiation is lower when the laptop is running on the battery as opposed to the mains power supply.  As to exactly how much worse, at what distance its difficult to say. The important thing to understand is that you can significantly reduce your exposure to emfs by using your laptop on the battery.""

""basically laptop on battery produces less radiation then whens its plugged in? you said radiation on battery is 350 then on mains is 1500 so is it 5x worse plugged in?

**Dr. Mercola cited evidence not to use laptops while plugged in**

""What's worse is that computer-charging devices are ungrounded, so ideally you'll only want to use a laptop when it's running on battery -- not when it's plugged into an outlet and charging. The same goes for iPads, Kindle's and even cell phones. Pregnant women should be especially careful using these types of technologies while plugged in.  According to Vickie Warren, former executive director of the Bau-Biologie Group for the United States, the amount of EMF you're exposed to from a laptop that is plugged in compared to a laptop that is running on battery is about 100 times higher!

The current Archives of Environmental and Occupational Health study also suggested that the power supply from a laptop induces strong electric current densities in the fetus when the laptop is used at close contact with a woman's womb, so taken together the research suggests that both men and women should use due care when considering whether or not to use a laptop, especially in close proximity to their bodies.""

""An estimated 1 out of every 5 people experiences some degree of tinnitus. Of the more than 50 million Americans who experience tinnitus, 12 million seek medical attention, and two million are so seriously debilitated that they cannot function on a ""normal,"" day-to-day basis. There is no known cure for tinnitus and treatments range from biofeedback, to drugs, to cochlear implants. Family doctors may also refer patients, who have no obvious physical damage, to psychiatrists.

Several individuals with tinnitus who have tested the G/S filters have reported a significant reduction in the volume of the sound they hear. Some have noticed that when the buzzing is loud, the dirty electricity in their home is high. If some tinnitus sufferers are able to perceive dirty electricity as noise then the removal of the dirty electricity may help alleviate their symptoms. The mechanism for this hearing is not known.

The human auditory response to pulses of radio frequency energy, referred to as RF hearing, is well established for frequencies in the MHz range (2.4 10,000 MHz) (Elder and Chou 2003). Evidence supports a heating effect, whereby audible sounds are produced by rapid thermal expansion of tissue resulting in a clicking, buzzing, or chirping sound. For this reason, the hearing phenomenon depends on the dimensions of the head and on the energy in a single pulse and not on average power density. In our study, exposure was to frequencies in the kHz range that are not associated with a heating phenomenon, so it is possible that some other mechanism is involved in producing the sounds heard.""

You can see a video tutorial in which I show how to use the buzz stick by scrolling down below the item at EMF Help Center.

You can also purchase the exact same merchandise at a local Radio Shack store. Ask for: Removable Telephone Pick Up, SKU 44-533, and Mini Amplifier-Speaker, Catalogue # 277-1008C. They will also have an earphone.

Attach the magnetic field pick-up to the end of a three-foot dowl stick, wind the cord around the stick, and plug it into the input jack of the battery-operated amplifier. Use it like a metal detector at the beach, sweeping it back and forth along the floor and walls to hear the precise location of magnetic fields, such as electric current on water pipes or grounding conductors that run under floors and in walls. This tool is also invaluable in the hunting and fixing of wiring errors on circuits in walls.

As with the Tri-Field meter mentioned above, be aware that the pick-up will also buzz in the presence of the magnetic field component of harmonic frequencies of dirty electricity produced by dimmer switches and other sources. Thus you do need to distinquish between a source of dirty electricity versus a wiring error when you measure and hear the presence of magnetic fields. Again, call me if you encounter this problem and I can walk you through differentiating between these two types of EMFs.""

I’ve used Sola line products for many years, and there are several other commercial companies that supply similar products. The CVS series would work fine in most household settings.

**(1) Stetzerizer line filter**

Would plugging a computer into the same outlet a Stetzerizer filter is plugged into circumvent power line hacking?

The Stetzerizer has an ungrounded two prong plug. ""They can be used in both grounded and ungrounded outlets operating at 110V, 50/60Hz without issue."" FAQ at www.stetzerelectric.com/stetzerizer/faq/

Installation instructions:

**(2) Greenwave Spectrum Filter and Broadband Filter**

Would plugging a computer directly into ONE Greenwave Filter circumvent power line hacking? Which type of Greenwave filter: spectrum or broadband?

""Greenwave® Spectrum 2000 Series filters (2400G and 2500G models) target low and mid-range frequencies and the Greenwave® Broadband 1500G filter targets mid-range and high frequencies. When you buy Greenwave filters from us, we provide a mix of these filters for optimal dirty electricity (EMI) reduction.""

""They can also help stop dirty electricity at its sources â the electronics and other electrical devices that create it. When a device is plugged into the base of a Greenwave filter rather than directly into a wall outlet, dirty electricity created by the device will be filtered before it reaches the internal wiring of the building.""

Photo conceals that the filters are three prongs. Gene at Greenwave stated two prong filters are available upon requested. Gene said two prong filters are as effective if they are as well connected to the outlet as a three prong filter. The ground prong holds the filter tighter in the outlet. 

Gene stated a customer complained his computer could not connect to broadband over power line due to the filters.  Eureka!

**(3) DNA line filter $2,400:**

**Evaluation of Line Meters**

Comparisons between Stetzernizer and Greenwave filter:

The testers did not disclose which Greenwave filter they tested: Spectrum or broadband.

www.christopherbradshaw.net/Health_Knowledge/dirty electricity page 2.html

""I have measured Greenwave filters side-by-side against the Stetzer filter, another popular dirty electricity filter, and found the Greenwave filter to be 12-15% more effective at reducing the dirty electricity reading on the microsurge meter, as well as the dirty electricity as shown on my oscilloscope.""

www.createhealthyhomes.com/dirty_electricity.php

Would out performance of a Greenwave filter be reduced by plugging it into a three prong to two prong adapter into a two prong outlet? Would it  then be the ewuivalent of a stetzernizer?

""Two Greenwave filters are typically needed to reduce dirty electricity within an averaged-sized room.  Rooms with heavy concentrations of electronics, appliances, energy-efficient lights, and/or other electrical devices may require more than two filters (usually 3). Small rooms, such as bathrooms, usually need only one.""

""05-15-2012 This is a partial installation modification which enables the specific type of targeting that frequently takes place certain areas such as Southern and Central California. Transformers are also modified. This takes place at each target's residence. Failure to perform these modifications results in melt downs of wiring at pedestals and homes and signal interference of all customers associated with the same central installation. 

Also, observations have shown that a remote control device is installed and signal codes are entered for daily precisely timed high frequency targeting. S. Cal times for brief blasting include 7PM, 7AM, and other rescheduled times. At 10PM, the system is changed over for the entire night of high frequency electromagnetic bathing of a target.""

(2) Meter showing extreme levels of electromagnetic radiation in a house by TruthaboutTargeting

""This is a video recording of a professional Graham  Stetzer microsurge meter. Please note: this meter measures radiation running through your electrical system. I retrieved the video camera during an attack of unknown origin that registered extremely high electromagnetic radiation levels that surged in waves of extremely high radiation lasting many minutes and then quickly dropped low briefly, and repeated this The range for normal is less than 50. This registered on camera in the 900 levels then quickly dropped to approximately 70. 

To put the readings into perspective, the nation of Kazakhstan mandates than no building can have wiring that transmits any level above 50 Graham Seltzer units at 50 htz AC. I and my animals become very sick during these attacks, which only occur when no one else is at my location. Constant video surveillance of this meter has shown that these levels never rise when anyone else is present.""
