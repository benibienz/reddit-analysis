They started exporting buffalo meat.&gt;**This is absolute racism. In India, 75% of milk is buffalo milk. Yet, you kill the buffalo because it is a black animal. American racism once upon a time destroyed the buffalo population there. The RSS’ racism will lead to the killing of buffaloes. You see, the buffalo has always been present in India.

308,"&gt; Jawaharlal Nehru ""declined a United States offer"" to India to ""take the permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council"" around 1953 and suggested that it be given to China, according to the United Nations Under-Secretary General, Sashi Tharoor.

&gt; http://www.thehindu.com/2004/01/10/stories/2004011004021200.htm

-----

&gt; Despite Nehru’s denial then, and online debates now, the 1955 offer from the Soviets is in fact well-documented, although perhaps not widely known. The angst over these rumors merges history and contemporary politics, with those arguing that such offers existed, and were refused, keen to ram what they consider to be another nail into the coffin of Jawaharlal Nehru’s reputation, India’s sometime socialist and avowedly secular first Prime Minister, who it is argued, in his idealism, failed to secure India’s national interest

&gt; That the 1955 incident was publicly discussed in 2002 in print by AG Noorani, a major scholar  of modern Indian history and politics, has not ended the rumor-mongering.[3] However, new evidence of an even earlier offer—by the US in August 1950—to assist India in assuming a permanent seat at the UN Security Council has recently emerged, adding substantially to what Noorani earlier wrote. Nehru’s rejection of the US offer underlined the consistency of his conviction that the PRC’s legitimate interests must be acknowledged in order to reduce international tensions

399,"Why interest rates are so high is a topic for different discussion, but i just did a quick lookup for tractor loans by SBI. Got 2 schemes

1) http://www.sbi.co.in/portal/web/agriculture-banking/new-tractor-loan-scheme

12% p.a. + prompt repayment concessions

2) http://www.sbi.co.in/portal/web/agriculture-banking/stree-shakti-tractor-loan

Base Rate (9.70%) + 1.75% = 11.45%

Therefore i was a bit surprised when you said you pay 18%, since i dont think priority sector loans would ever be this high

Now i am not aware what bank are you dealing with or when did you get the loan, but may be you can ask your nearest SBI bank if your loan could be transferred or renegotiated. Bank employees, especially PSU banks are not really helpful, but still you could try.

Edit: I asked my dad who works in PSU bank and has handled rural branch, he says, unless your tractor was for commercial purposes (not agriculture) there is no way it could be 18%. The max that an agri loan can go for is 14%",2015-09-17 15:09:44+00:00,cv4qmec,1,t3_3lb2bf,1814,india

&gt; The Ashokavadana Massacre

&gt; The Ashokavadana Massacre according to ancient text, Ashokavadana, was a massacre of Jains by King Ashoka in which around 18,000 followers of Jainism were killed. These ancient texts mention that a non-Buddhist in Pundravardhana drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of Nirgrantha Jnatiputra (identified with Mahavira, the founder of Jainism). On complaint from a Buddhist devotee, Ashoka, an emperor of the Maurya Dynasty, issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the Ajivikas in Pundravardhana. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order.[1] Sometime later, another Nirgrantha follower in Pataliputra drew a similar picture. Ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house.[2] He also announced an award of one dinara (silver coin) to anyone who brought him the head of a Nirgrantha heretic. According to Ashokavadana, as a result of this order, his own brother, Vitashoka, was mistaken for a heretic and killed by a cowherd. Their ministers advised that ""this is an example of the suffering that is being inflicted even on those who are free from desire"" and that he ""should guarantee the security of all beings"". After this, Ashoka stopped giving orders for executions",2015-09-05 20:15:26+00:00,curszs6,5,t1_curlpvn,13844,indianews

Compare that with NEFT, you get money at your account on the same day. Way ahead of competition. Not many countries by then had an electronic fund transfer infrastructure let alone netbanking.

So cut to today, around 24 countries have infra for *near* real-time payments. Therefore, due to pressure from regulators and businesses. Banks have now started commissioning 24/7 payment mechanism. They are either called IMPS (Immediate Payment systems) or Faster Payments. The one in India is called IMPS. The one in Singapore (2014) and UK (2008) is called Faster Payments.

&gt; He writes that India's households increased by 60 million - from 187 million to 247 million - between 2001 and 2011. The number of houses went up by 81 million - from 250 million to 331 million - over the same period. In urban areas, there were 38 million new homes for 24 million new households.

716,"&gt; Smoking was largely a male preserve until the World War I era in the west. Women appeared in tobacco advertisements prior to this time, but they were depicted as serving cigarettes to men. During World War I, however, as women grew more assertive and visible in public life, ads targeting women as smokers began to appear.By the mid-1920s, market-seeking tobacco companies set out more purposefully to attract women smokers. . To vanquish cultural taboos, they appropriated individualist and feminist messages and presented smoking as a way for women to demonstrate their liberation from confining traditions. They called the cigarettes the women’s “torches of freedom.”

My dear, BASEL 3 is yet to be implemented. This invalidates your entire argument.

&gt; Furthermore Basel 2 to Basel 3 the capital adqueacy and liquidty stress tests have seen nominal change.

so you are saying a TIER-1 capital change from 4.5% to 6% is nominal?

759,"I agree with the general sense of our statement but the specifics are wrong

Firstly there is a legitimate reason for 75k crore injection in PSU banks. Indian banks will implement BASEL-3 soon and more capital needs to be allocated to adhere to those norms. Although i am not sure what actual amount is required to upgrade from BASEL-2 to BASEL-3

&gt; That money is just going to flow into same mal-investments that caused the problems in the first place or new ones.

Rajan has tightened norms for recognition,provisioning and asset securitization of NPAs. So this number will ultimately go down.

&gt; It was Emergency time then, arguably the lowest that Indian democracy has ever hit. An arrest warrant was issued in Delhi against Dr.Swamy, a resident of Delhi then. To escape 'political' imprisonment, Swamy disguised himself as a Sikh, escaped out of Delhi, came down to Chennai, escaped to Sri Lanka &amp; then on to the US and stayed there for 6 months!
Oh wait, this is where it really gets interesting. He was a MP when he escaped out of India and was to face dis-qualification by law, if he failed to show up in the parliament for 6 months. On one hand parliament seat, on the other, imminent arrest if he shows up in India. What does he do?
Swamy came back from the US and cooly walked into the Indian parliament and sat for the 1st session. In line with tradition, the 1st session started off with obituaries to the dead MPs. Our man abruptly stood up and demanded to include 'Indian Democracy' in the obituary list! (democracy having been battered to death by Emergency). In the hue &amp; cry that instantly followed, he quietly slipped out of the parliament knowing well that he had very visibly registered his 'attendance' but cannot stay any longer!

1) It has seen 39 strikes over its existence. With *issues* ranging from changing course structure to opposition to facilities upgrade. ^[1](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/FTII-has-seen-39-strikes-in-its-55-year-existence/articleshow/47932780.cms)

2) Average cost of a student is aboive 10 lakhs. Much above what govt spends on IIT student (about 5 lakhs).^[2](https://www.quora.com/How-much-subsidy-is-provided-by-the-government-per-student-to-universities-IITs-NITs-IIMs-IIITs-state-universities-etc-in-India) . IIMs run profit.

3) The students at FTII don't even pay their subsidised fees. The recovery through fees/hostel rent has decreased from 25% in 2006-07 to as low as 11% in 2010-11. ^[3](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-07-06/news/64142664_1_ftii-student-ib-minister-arun-jaitley-ib-report)

1272,"where is the secretary of MEA involved in the article? The appointments if done would have been done under the recommendation of Sen who was the chairmen and chancellor.

&gt; Former President APJ Abdul Kalam's letter, which he sent to Foreign Minister S M Krishna in July last year, has now come into public domain, slamming Nobel Laureate economist Amartya Sen for forcing him out of his brainchild project of the Nalanda University in Bihar as its first visitor.

&gt; The paragraph reads, ""Having been involved in various academic and administrative proceedings of the Nalanda University since August 2007, I believe that the candidates to be selected/appointed to the post of chancellor and vice chancellor should be of extraordinary intellect with academic and management expertise."" ""Both the chancellor and vice chancellor have to personally involve themselves full-time in Bihar, so that a robust and strong international institution is built,"" it read.

...

&gt; **Kalam felt frustrated with the people at helm of affairs and his resignation was a rebuff to Sen and his protégé Dr Gopa Sabharwal, 'smuggled' in as the vice chancellor-designate without his knowledge**

.. 
from the first article 

&gt; The controversy, however, erupted with the appointment of a ‘Vice Chancellor-designate’of the new university even before the Act was notified for its establishment and that too at a fantastic monthly salary of Rs 5 lakhs plus, which is more than double the salary of the Delhi University vice-chancellor. 

&gt; The incumbent Gopa Sabharwal, appointed through an order issued by a secretary in MEA on the recommendation of the mentor group, is just a reader in the department of sociology in the Lady Sri Ram College and has nothing to do with the Buddhist studies for which the university is to be set up. She did not meet the mandatory qualification set by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for the vice-chancellors of the central and state universities to be distinguished academicians with a minimum ten years of experience as a professor in a university system.

&gt; Ignoring the government’s recruitment rules that require public notice, Dr Sabharwal picked up her friend Dr Anjana Sharma, an associate professor in Delhi University, as the Officer-on-Special Duty (OSD) on deputation, with gross monthly salary of Rs 3.30 lakhs, which is more than the salary of a Vice-Chancellor in the rest of the country. 
....

&gt; The NDA-modified Land Acquisition Act is intended to make acquisitions easier for specific purposes (industrial corridors, rural roads, homes, etc), but the fact is more than two-thirds of rural households – nearly 70 percent – do not derive major incomes from cultivation or land ownership. They will not be affected by any changes in the land acquisition act, unless the impact is directly on farm labour employment.

&gt; Put another way, 70 percent of rural India needs jobs rather than land for its well-being. And these jobs will not come unless land is used for building infrastructure, homesteads, and social infrastructure like schools and hospitals.",2015-07-03 09:37:16+00:00,csqv31r,1,t3_3bz5al,438,india
