While I'm not sure about Infinite Warfare, but I think it's safe to assume that there will be dumb skins and silly dances.

They've done nothing to change the series for the past several games. And their not going to as long as people keep buying it.

I haven't played the game so for all I know it's the best Call of Duty yet, but I played BLOPs 3 and that was a joke of a game.

I don't like dividing the player base, people like what they like and if they want to buy every new call of duty, it's their money and they can do what they want with it, but I miss the days of as some people have put it ""boots on the ground"".

Modern Warfare 3 was the last call of duty I enjoyed. It was after that we started getting ridiculous killstreaks that cover the map in napalm, and these weird class things they have now. Now att the end of round you can show off your dab emote, Mt. Dew camo, and bacon weapon skin.

Ive heard that Titan fall 2 is the game Infinite Warfare should have been. But my allegiance lies with Battlefield.

""What you are hearing is the tensor tympani muscle. This is a small muscle in your ear that acts as a dampener of external sound. It attaches to a small bone in the ear and prevents it from oscillating, particularly when chewing. This is why you can also hear it if you move your jaw in certain positions, it also tends to contract when you close your eyes tightly and quickly. You'll notice the sound will only last briefly. This is because the initial contraction of the muscle causes the bone to move creating a rumbling sound. Interestingly, some people have the ability to contract this muscle voluntarily.""

Right now I play Doom and R6 Siege.

In rainbow six I have gadget use on upper right, crouch(b) and upper left and lean right/left on the lower to.

This has made the game a lot easier. I can move around much more streamlined.

A defender that can close drone holes. I know its not that useful, but it would be nice to have a new operator to pick from

Either attacker or defender that has a decoy grenade that simulates footsteps or gunfire. Maybe the defender could have a Kapkan type thing where it makes a loud sound when an attacker walks over it.

A new attacker that has a submachine gun, but is really fast and quite

A defender that can place  gadgets similar to Valkyrie, but they produce a blinding light.

Traps that have a flashbang effect.

An attacker with increased explosive resistance, but is super slow. A bomb squad outfit for instance.

Some new grenades like incendiary or shrapnel. Not frags. They have increased blast radius but does less damage.

A defender that has a counter to Thatcher. Maybe its like rook where he places a bag down and inside are containers or something that make gadgets immune to emps.

Another idea that would just spice up the game is that each operator would get a variant. There for I stance could be three Thermites to pick from, but they would all have different speed, armor and weapons.

958,"DO NOT BUY IT!

I own it and I %99 percent regret buying it. The %1 is me hoping they will make this game what they marketed it to be.

Its fun for the first few hours but then it just gets awful. The game is in a worse state now than it was at launch. There is no good way to get good loot. The crafting is impossible. And the Dark Zone, the selling point for this game is a waste of time. I would say wait a month or two, honestly. 

The next update is rumored to drop at the end of may. That being said, that could be a bad thing. The last update turned the game into the steaming pile of shit it is now. Before people call me out, this game is broken. For instance, a perk says it is supposed to protect you from elite enemies by decreasing the amount of damage received. After some testing by a fellow reddit user, it was discovered that this perk actually increases the damage received. That is just one of the many lazy mistakes in this game.

Saying all of this bums me out, but I don't want anybody else falling into this trap.

I wanted so much for this game to be good. And it was at the beginning. It had promise. But then some dimwit thought it would be a good idea to change how the whole game worked. They had plenty of examples from other extremely successful games to learn from. And what do they do? They ignore them and destroy what made this game fun, which was finding new and better gear.

There is no endgame. There is no reason to keep playing after you reach max level which only takes you a few hours.

Do not buy this game. Check out the subredddit now and you will see what I'm talking about. Its a shit show.

 I'm just saying the game released with a decent launch, and what do they do?

They make the game boring. They ruin it. The whole point of this game is to get loot. That's where the player gets their satisfaction. That's where the addiction takes place. 

When they made the only way to get decent loot a boring survival in a room, they ruined the game. The missions get boring really fast, and playing the same challenge mission over and over again is pretty annoying.

What I was most excited for was the dark zone. That was their main selling point for this game. ""The DZ is where you will find the best and rarest loot"". Look how that turned out.

There are some good aspects. The game is beautiful, the visuals and sounds are amazing. The world is truly a piece of art. But it is completely wasted.

This game is disappointing. It is nothing it was said to be. The things they said and showed are not what we have now.

You beat a raid and get some sweet gear. Then what? You do the same thing over and over again of course!

I stopped playing destiny because I realized I  was actually wasting my time. Well, you might say ""all video games are a waste of time"". True, but not if you are with friends or are having fun. 

I realized that I wasn't having fun playing the same mission over and over again only in hopes of getting a rifle with a few more hit points.

Destiny is lacking in so many areas. Very little gear.

All missions are the same.

Still a bad story with major plot holes.

Lacking in lore.

And there is no sense of fear in the game. Not once when I played did I feel like I was playing a part in saving the last city. All fights happen across the solar system. 

When Taken King was  announced I  was so excited.  Maybe oryx with attack the last city and we will have to take refuge on mercury or Neptune. Nope. Same missions. Same raid. Except with the release of TTK, all previous content became pointless. The game was in a worse state than when it released.

I just hope the division doesn't turn out like destiny.

I could go on for pages, but whatever.

I know some people don't care and will always enjoy destiny, and I don't blame them. Its a fun game. Its just not full though. It feels like its still in alpha.

Maybe some will read this and realise they dont enjoy destiny either anymore, and they will be free of the burden.

The game is in a worse place than when it released. The content is scarce. There are a few new weapons. But they get old quick, and the customization is next to none.
