For instance, I got my vex mythoclast very late, and now its just taking up vault space. My PoE weapons which I think are some of the coolest guns in the game are also useless.

Same thing goes for everything else year one in Destiny. Why did Budgie cut out most of the game?

I feel like the new car smell will wear off and people will realize that we are in the same situation as we were when Destiny first came out.

I just fail to see the standpoint of not updating Y1 items and activities. I would love to do VoG and get a 280 Vision of Confluence cause that is the gun I used since like the first month of Destiny.

When House of Wolves came out I had the weekly, nightfall, both raids, and Prison of Elders. Now its the raid(which is already too easy, WHERE IS HARD MODE??), a pointless nightfall, and the court.

This is the exact same thing as Y1 pre Dark Below. Striking every day trying to get cool gear to do the raid. House of Wolves did it right in letting us choose which gear we wanted to make us max level. It made each Guardian unique and look the way they wanted. Now, if you dont like the new raid gear, you can infuse it into some of the horrendous legendary armor pieces we have (Im looking at you samsara!) 

I could go on for a long time, but there is my rant.

Thoughts?

The two charging cables and battery packs I bought only cause the controller to turn off and on.

Is there anything I can do to get a replacement for any of these products without spending more money?
