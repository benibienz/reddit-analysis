2,"Hello fellow redditor,

i've been unable to find much information regarding this game are you aware of how to build stairs chance by any chance? I need to connect a coasters entrance that is off the ground. 
I've looked for PC, but I can't see the equivalent here.

4,"That'd be great to co op. 
I have had a few post on here but never seem to get people to do more than add me as a friend. 

My psn is BarrieGibb if you want to play. 

I've started a new build with the cane whip and I'm finding it effective, it leaves me more of a option to use a gun. 

Edit: you added me the other day. 
Let's have at it. ",2015-08-11 05:40:46+00:00,ctyvh2b,1,t3_3gffd2,90500,gaymers
5,"Ha, well shit! That doesn't leave me with much hope at all. 

Those were 40 hours of hard slog with me just trying to adapt. Not that much progress at all. 
Pretty sure I missed whole areas aswell and not in a good sneaky way. üò≥",2015-08-09 05:18:34+00:00,ctwmcvr,4,t1_ctwm8pr,289,gaymers
6,"Pretty aggressive without using guns for much more than luring. 
In the 40 or so hours I used the extendable scythe/axe. (can't recall it's name). I can look later. I liked it, fitted my style well. 

I have started a new build a few days ago and I picked the stick/whip and am trying to use guns more effectively in combat. 

I'm pretty keen to do some high level chalices. 

See you soon. üëç
