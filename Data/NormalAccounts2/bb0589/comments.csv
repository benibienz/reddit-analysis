1,I get so fucking tired using children as a cover for your racist and bigot rants. The only way children could have fears is if you instill that in them or do not correct it when they hear it from others. Fuck you Van Jones you should be ashamed of yourself!!! ,2016-11-20 14:38:26+00:00,da86b0f,1,t3_5dy97b,172,The_Donald

3,Liberals say their just exercising their 1st amendment rights. Yes but we have the right to express our 1st amendment to express our viewpoint. And mine is it was not the right forum to do that at all. Jackass said that they were having a discussion. Well if you wanted to have a discussion why didn't you invite VP-elect Pence on stage and have a discussion? Give him an opportunity to address you concerns!!! One-way conversations are called a lecture. If the shoe was turned the fallout would have been much worse!!!  ,2016-11-20 14:33:33+00:00,da866fb,1,t3_5dvj3b,50205,The_Donald
4,I love our madman is still going to call the insanity of the left and not allow their crap to go unchecked. Was not the right forum to lecture VP-elect Pence and disrespectful to his family. He went there to enjoy a night out with his family and should have been exposed. What would happened if when HRC went there they lectured her about her misdeeds? The cast would probably been fired!!!,2016-11-20 11:43:37+00:00,da82rib,1,t3_5dvj3b,40009,The_Donald
5,"Comparing President-elect Trump's win to the day after 9/11 is so disgusting and disgraceful to all the families who lost loved ones that day. NOTHING can be compared to that day. I lived that day, I know the devastation and emotion of that day. Even if HRC won I could not compared it to that day. DeNiro is a piece of shit and owes a apology to all the families who lost loved ones on 9/11. ",2016-11-20 11:29:04+00:00,da82jut,1,t3_5dxn2k,269,The_Donald

- They come out and say there was no ""Quid pro Quo"" so case closed. Say Kennedy did nothing wrong and keeps his job. Case closed.

- HRC says she don't remember just about anything related to her emails so in their eyes the case is closed.

- Says that election cannot be fixed so case closed. On the other hand says the Russians are influencing the election so that's the truth.

- Says O'Keef's is a criminal with a history of doctoring videos so these are fake and refuses to respond to them.

- Says the Podesta emails have been doctored so they refuse to comment on them. Case closed.

- Says Mr. Trump committed sexual assault so that is the truth.

I have a issue with her because she ruined Michigan and one of the reasons we in a mess so I always get irate when I see her. SO I tracked her down a while ago and knew she was getting paid by CTR.

I have never been able to find these two but wonder if they are getting paid somewhere along the food chain. They are Angela Rye and Anna Navarro. Swear they are getting paid.

Problem is the Left does not recognize ILLEGAL and refers to them as undocumented.

BTW, no one ever brings up HRC ""box car"" comments to which she has NEVER apologized for.

867,"There are lots of strange things in her address. First, she did it remotely, is she hiding her sickness yet again? 

It was a strange non-answer why she was behind in the polls and almost yet another insult for ""working"" families. Does she mean that she only has non-working families support? 

Just the other day she said yet again that she was going to stop the insults against Mr. Trump yet she accused him of “stiffing small businesses and contractors.”

Her words about staging an intervention is an insult for all us who have a real problem that requires help and it is serious business and should be used lightly and as a sarcastic joke.

Last one is when she said ” Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done.” Well what you have done is lied, cheated and stole. You have failed at every level. You are a quitter as you quit as SOS. So what you have done should disqualify you to be president of the United States.

897,"Yes I do, I happen to have a minor in mathematics. First off I never said that these were per capita stats.
 
So the stats were simple percentages based on the number of people killed by police broken down by ethnicity. 

But if want to do it per capita say per 1,000 it is a big difference. 2 people killed per thousand for whites and 6 people killed per thousand for blacks.

If you want to look at as a % of population which is the number of people killed by police by total population broken down into the same groups it comes out to .2% for whites, .7% for blacks, .6% for Hispanics and .4% for others. 

So in answer to your question statistically speaking on a per capita basis you are more likely to killed by police if your black than white. However there is under a 1% chance to be killed by police for all groups.

1006,"The 1st paragraph ""Donald Trump launched his campaign for president calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “criminals” (“and some, I assume, are good people”)."" is factually incorrect since he NEVER said that.

They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.""

But why I agree with the SCP Union is the 49ers are allowing him to use their facilities to complain about the treatment of blacks by the police, which is a biased and untrue statement. More whites are killed by police than blacks and that is a fact. So by allowing him to use the facility with a microphone that has the NFL logo wrapped around it, SF 49ers logo and their sponsors SAP and Levis in the background they are all saying they support his racist and bigot views. And by the NFL supporting him that means all their sponsors support him as well. While I disagree with his views it is his 1st amendment right to say what we wants OUTSIDE of the 49er facility. 

Think about this for a minute, If you called a press conference at your employers facility and their logo was clearly prevalent in the background what would happen to you. Yes, you would be arrested and fired.

I have written letters to the SF 49ers, NFL, SAP and Levis asking them to issue a statement that they do support or condone Colin Kaepernick's view and that they do not allow him to use their facilities for political purposes but have not heard back.

And this grandstanding that every time a black man walks into a store they are looked at liked they are going to steal something. I was a Manager at a major chain in the US and while I can not speak for every store let me tell you the employees on the floor have nothing to do with store security and do not treat anyone like a shoplifter. You don't even see a security person because they are in a secure room monitoring with cameras and believe me they are watching everyone. I go into my local Popeye's whose staff is 100% black and could accuse them of racism because of my skin color if I wanted too. I could visit a local burger joint whose staff is 100% Arab descent and could accuse them of racism because of my skin color. 

And then this issue with Kaepernick, Beyoncé &amp; BLM say that they are being gunned down by police and forget the facts that out of the 990 people killed by the police in 2015, 50% were white 26% were black and 17% were Hispanics. No liberal wants to look at the underlying core issues which one of them is Democratic rule.

Have a black man who was more mad about he was allegedly treated at the police station yet he says nothing about the black man who robbed him which led him to go to the police station. A innocent mother is gunned down in the streets and instead of an outrage over the two gangbangers they focus their angry on a ""insensitive"" tweet.

Mr. Trump is trying to have a conversation about the problems and the liberals call him racist and a bigot. Criticized because he doesn't go to the black community so he goes to the black community and instead of having his voice heard and be a part of the solution a pastor choose to stand outside and protest. Then I hear some criticize he because he is only going to a black church and that he's not going on the street.
