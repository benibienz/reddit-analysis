She recites that her ""friend"" Michelle said the now very tired they go low we go high bullshit. Not sure what the fuck that means but fucking hate it. Oh and BTW Michelle is no friend of hers. Listen to some prior speeches of hers!!!

Then the funniest part where she says she wants to be a president for everyone. What about the irredeemable deplorables, rednecks insults. All the insults against Catholics, Evangelicals. About the only faith she hasn't insulted are the Muslims.

Proud of all her endorsements from newspapers. We know those endorsements are bought and paid for!!!!

NBA, MLB &amp; NFL players say they don't have locker room talk like Mr. Trump. Well no of course they are too busy talking about hating police!!!

Talks about immigration reform which is public talk for open borders! Goes on to say how children are scared of Mr. Trump. Repeats the story about the Ethiopian adopted boy and how scared he is that Trump will send him. Don't believe that story at all!!!

Goes on about how her tax plan will reduce taxes and Mr. Trump will raise taxes. We know the opposite is the truth and the private talk is she would never raise taxes on the top 1%.

Lies about Mr. Trump getting $14 from his Dad. The real loan he got was $1 million.

Talks about always being a children's advocate since she graduated from law school. Fails to mention she got a child rapist off and then laughed about it.

Tell the big lie about college being free. We know the private story which is that this will never be done.

Talks about being a advocate for equal pay for women for years and years. If that's true than why hasn't she done it????

Many just refer to themselves as Latinos. Aren't we all just Americans??? I believe that is part of the problem is that it divides us into groups and promotes cultural segregation. 

Second problem is also having to identify the color of our skin in front of American. Like a white American. Again aren't we all just Americans?

 Like Obama referring to himself as African American. Which half is he referring to. He's biracial and not 100% black. So when he insults whites as he does a lot isn't he insulting himself????

It tells HRC surrogates how to respond to any questions regarding the ""basket of deplorables"" Raises a couple of points:

1) Did HRC drop this two days before 9/11 so it would be buried by the tragic day?
2) Are HRC surrogates ALL paid by her???
3) I now understand why HRC surrogates say the exact thing.
4) Kreepy Kaine's comments are deplorable.
5) It was not an apology and we will not forget this.
6) It was not the first time she said this
7) Keep this in mind when you hear her surrogates respond.

Here's the unedited article:

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is advising fellow Democrats who speak on her behalf to chastise the press for applying a different standard to her if pressed by interviewers about Clinton’s characterization of half of Donald Trump’s supporters as “deplorables.”

The advice is contained in a memo — titled “‘Deplorable’ Comment Talking Points” — sent out Saturday afternoon to Clinton surrogates preparing for television interviews or other appearances in support of the former secretary of state. 

During a Friday night fundraiser in New York, the Democratic presidential nominee said that “half” of Trump’s supporters can be placed in a “basket of deplorables,” meaning that they are racist, homophobic or xenophobic.

In a statement Saturday, Clinton expressed “regret” for being “grossly generalistic” and using the characterization of “half” but also said — as she has several times before — that the Republican nominee is amplifying views of the alt-right and white supremacists.

The guidance issued to surrogates says that Clinton has “apologized” — a word she did not use — for saying “most” rather than “some” and notes that “obviously not everyone supporting Trump is part of the alt right.” But, the guidance says, “it is deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices.”

The memo goes on to say “IF PUSHED,” surrogates should raise concerns about media fairness.

“I think we can all agree that if Donald Trump said something controversial about Clinton supporters, it wouldn’t have been in his top ten list of offensive statements in day,” the advice reads. “It’s well past time the press stopped grading Trump on a curve. So is the press going to cover this story in the right [context], or are they going to hold Hillary to a different standard again? Are they going to make more out of this story than they made out of the racist, misogynistic Trump comments that got us here in the first place?”

The guidance also includes suggested comments — “only if asked” — on what to say about Clinton and her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, being “on different pages” about whether Clinton should have apologized for the episode.

Shortly after Clinton issued a statement on the matter Saturday, Kaine, a senator from Virginia, said in an interview with The WP that he didn’t see a need for her to apologize.

The suggested response to surrogates: “Tim Kaine was making the point that she didn’t need to apologize for calling out that Donald Trump has given a platform to the alt-right and its deplorable views. And the campaign has made clear that they will continue to call out the bigotry and racist values that Donald Trump has championed in this campaign.”

I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy, and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.""

No one talks about her open border plan and the danger it presents to the sovereignty of our great nation. So I decided to post it here so read and get real scared.

As president, Hillary will:
1. Introduce comprehensive immigration reform. Hillary will introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within her first 100 days in office. 

2. It will treat every person with dignity, fix the family visa backlog, uphold the rule of law, protect our borders and national security, and bring millions of hardworking people into the formal economy.

3. End the three- and 10-year bars. The three- and 10-year bars force families—especially those whose members have different citizenship or immigration statuses—into a heartbreaking dilemma: remain in the shadows, or pursue a green card by leaving the country and loved ones behind.

3. Defend President Obama’s executive actions—known as DACA and DAPA—against partisan attacks. The Supreme Court’s deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. Hillary believes DAPA is squarely within the president’s authority and won’t stop fighting until we see it through. The estimated 5 million people eligible for DAPA—including DREAMers and parents of Americans and lawful residents—should be protected under the executive actions.

4. Do everything possible under the law to protect families. If Congress keeps failing to act on comprehensive immigration reform, Hillary will enact a simple system for those with sympathetic cases—such as parents of DREAMers, those with a history of service and contribution to their communities, or those who experience extreme labor violations—to make their case and be eligible for deferred action.

5. Enforce immigration laws humanely. Immigration enforcement must be humane, targeted, and effective. Hillary will focus resources on detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety, and ensure refugees who seek asylum in the U.S. have a fair chance to tell their stories.

6. End family detention and close private immigration detention centers. Hillary will end family detention for parents and children who arrive at our border in desperate situations and close private immigrant detention centers.

7. Expand access to affordable health care to all families. We should let families—regardless of immigration status—buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Families who want to purchase health insurance should be able to do so.

8. Promote naturalization. Hillary will work to expand fee waivers to alleviate naturalization costs, increase access to language programs to encourage English proficiency, and increase outreach and education to help more people navigate the process.

9. Support immigrant integration. Hillary will create a national Office of Immigrant Affairs, support affordable integration services through $15 million in new grant funding for community navigators and similar organizations, and significantly increase federal resources for adult English language education and citizenship education. 

Most of her plan violates the Constitution. The one part that she wants to eliminate is the vetting process (#3). #4 says she will violate the Constitution if Congress doesn't support her plan, something Obama did over and over with Executive Actions. It's even further to the left of Obama and will serve notice to all countries to dump their prisons and send all their trash here.

After the game yesterday in the background was the SF49er's logo along with their sponsors Levis and SAP. So by allowing this to continue it implies that the 49ers, Levis, SAP, and any other sponsors of the 49ers, the NFL and any of their sponsors, and since the locker room was in their stadium the Chargers support the cause of police brutality against blacks. The NFL is so hypocritical because they would not allow the Dallas Cowboys to honor the police officers that were killed but support a player speaking out against police officers. 

I happen to have a business relationship with one of those companies and already have had a few of my clients already ask me if my company supports the police brutality against blacks movement.

When asked about the comments he offered the following:

“They’re sending us not their finest people,” Trump reiterated. “And it’s people from countries other than Mexico also. We have drug dealers coming across, we have rapists, we have killers, we have murderers. I mean it’s common sense, what do you think they’re going to send us their best people, their finest people?

The cost of the oil per barrel from rail is $30 as opposed to an estimated $10 per barrel via the pipeline. So brace yourself to why she is really opposed to the pipeline.

Jesse Jackson: Chicago is desperate for action

From:pressdepartment@rainbowpush.org 
To:  mirandal@dnc.org  
Date: 2016-05-10 11:49 
Subject: Jesse Jackson: Chicago is desperate for action 
 
Chicago, America’s third largest city, is plagued by violence and poverty, made worse by racial and class divisions. A poll just released by the Kaiser Foundation and the New York Times depicts a city that is losing faith in its basic public institutions from the police to the mayor’s office. The vast majority think the city is on the wrong track, with the greatest unity found in their unfavorable opinion about the job Mayor Rahm Emanuel is doing.

Chicago has nearly equal numbers of black, Hispanic and white residents, but they live largely in separate sides of town and in separate realities. African-Americans and Latinos are far unhappier with basic aspects of their neighborhoods, from parks to public schools. Crime and violence is the biggest issue for all Chicagoans, but while 41 percent of blacks think their neighborhoods are not safe or not too safe, only 17 percent of whites share their fears. In the wake of the Laquan McDonald shooting — where a teenager was shot 16 times and killed by a white Chicago policeman, Chicagoans believe the police are biased, unaccountable and badly in need of reform.

On the poverty-ridden south and west sides of town, parents fear for the young. Among African-Americans, overwhelming majorities worry that it is likely or very likely that a young person in their neighborhood will end up in a gang (75 percent), abuse alcohol or drugs (83 percent), got to jail (81 percent) or be a victim of violence (86 percent). These are measures of despair.

The Kaiser/NYT poll only documents what we already knew. It details the “whereas.” Any statement of action begins with the whereas — whereas this is true, and this is true — detailing the conditions that demand action. 

What is missing in Chicago isn’t evidence of the whereas, it is the plan for the “therefore.” Whereas these conditions are unjust and unsustainable, therefore we will take the following actions. On police reform, Chicago is beginning to see the first stirrings of reform, although nothing close to the comprehensive reforms demanded by the mayor’s own independent commission.

But on violence, crime, jobs, housing, public schools, parks, trash removal, violence and drugs, there is no plan for action, no “therefore” to address the wretched whereas. In Chicago, 60 percent of whites think their neighborhood is a good or excellent place to raise children. Seventy percent of blacks think their neighborhood is only fair or poor (nearly half — 44 percent — say poor). More than two-thirds would rather live somewhere else.
Blacks and Latinos in Chicago believe that the mayor does not care about people like them. While a majority of whites believe he cares, nearly two-thirds of black think he does not. The lack of action is assumed to express a lack of concern.
Look across the country at our major cities: Chicago is not alone. The problems of racial isolation, entrenched poverty, bad schools and lousy services, dangerous streets, guns and drugs plague many of our cities. The “therefore” ought to be a national initiative, driving state and local activity, on jobs and urban development. But Washington is dysfunctional, with even minor reforms held hostage by the obstructionist Congress. President Obama has chosen not to put this high on his priorities. And the rich and entrenched interests that dominate our politics continue to ignore the misery.
But a whereas without a therefore isn’t a stable reality. Trapped people with no hope are like dry kindling, susceptible to any spark. If the powerful don’t leave people with hope, people will express their despair. Real action — a serious plan for reform with the resources needed to provide it — is long past due.

There also another loud mouth Latino that is a frequent guest that always screams and never says anything factual. It outraged me how taken out of context Mr. Trump's words were taken out of context with regards to the illegals coming into the country.

The original statement on June 16, 2015 was “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists and some, I assume, are good people.”

In a follow-up interview MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt he said it wasn't just Mexicans either. No where did he say all Mexicans are rapists as some loud mouths are saying. Here's that quote:

“They’re sending us not their finest people,” Trump reiterated. “And it’s people from countries other than Mexico also. We have drug dealers coming across, we have rapists, we have killers, we have murderers. I mean it’s common sense, what do you think they’re going to send us their best people, their finest people? The answer is no.” 

Fact is that he is right.  Googling this topic and here is an example:

In the fall of 1999 five Asian gang members, illegal aliens as it was reported many years latter, kidnapped and gang raped a University of Colorado coed. Initiation rites were involved and they specifically targeted a ""white woman."" 

In a Testimony of District Attorney John M. Morganelli before the House Subcommittee on immigration, Border, Security and Claims he stated:

""Unfortunately, the majority of illegal aliens who are here are engaged in criminal activity. Identity theft, use of fraudulent social security numbers and green cards, tax evasion, driving without licenses represent some of the crimes that are engaged in by the majority of illegal aliens on a daily basis merely to maintain and hide their illegal status. 

In addition, violent crime and drug distribution and possession is also prevalent among illegal aliens. Over 25% of today's federal prison population are illegal aliens. In some areas of the country, 12% of felonies, 25% of burglaries and 34% of thefts are committed by illegal aliens.""


Ignoring the ""minor crime"" such as ID theft and property crimes being committed by illegal aliens, here is a summary on some of the collateral damage reaped in crimes as a result of tolerating illegal aliens in the USA:

•In Los Angeles, 95% of some 1,500 outstanding warrants for homicides are for illegal aliens. About 67% of the 17,000 outstanding fugitive felony warrants are for illegal aliens.

•There are currently over 400,000 unaccounted for illegal alien criminals with outstanding deportation orders. At least one fourth of these are hard core criminals.

•80,000 to 100,000 illegal aliens who have been convicted of serious crimes are walking the streets. Based on studies they will commit an average of 13 serious crimes per perpetrator.

•Illegal aliens are involved in criminal activities at a rate that is 2-5 times their representative proportion of the population.

•In 1980, our Federal and state facilities held fewer than 9,000 criminal aliens but at the end of 2003, approximately 267,000 illegal aliens were incarcerated in U.S. correctional facilities at a cost of about $6.8 billion per year. 

•At least 4.5 million pounds of cocaine with a street value of at least $72 billion is smuggled across the southern border every year. ..

•56% of illegal aliens charged with a reentry offense had previously been convicted on at least 5 prior occasions. 

•Illegal aliens charged with unlawful reentry had the most extensive criminal histories. 90% had been previously arrested. Of those with a prior arrest, 50% had been arrested for violent or drug-related felonies.

•Illegal aliens commit between 700,000 to 1,289,000 or more crimes per year. 

•Illegal aliens commit at least 2,158 murders each year – a number that represents three times greater participation than their proportion of the population.

•Illegal alien sexual predators commit an estimated 130,909 sexual crimes each year.

•There may be as many as 240,000 illegal alien sex offenders circulating throughout America. Based on studies, they will commit an average of 8 sex crimes per perpetrator before being caught.

•Nearly 63% of illegal alien sex offenders had been deported on another offense prior to committing the sex crime.

•Only 2% of the illegal alien sex offenders in one study had no history of criminal behavior, beyond crossing the border illegally.

•In Operation Predator, ICE arrested and deported 6,085 illegal alien pedophiles. Some studies suggest each pedophile molests average of 148 children. If so, that could be as many as 900,580 victims.

•Nobody knows how big the Sex Slave problem is but it is enormous.

•The very brutal MS-13 gang has over 15,000 members and associates in at least 115 different cliques in 33 states.

•The overall financial impact of illegal alien crimes is estimated at between $14.4 and $81 billion or more per year. Factor in the crime as a result of the cocaine and other drugs being smuggled in and the number may reach $150 billion per year.

So Mr. Trump's comments were indeed correct and not a statement on all Mexicans. Out of all the lies and people taking a piece of a statement Mr. Trump makes this one is so damaging and slanderous.
