0,"The biggest mistake that cultural Marxist make is that they believe that ""oppressed"" people are only acting the way they act due to ""oppression"" and not at all due to their own values and beliefs. Thus when an immigrant or asylum seekers commits a crime, or are inciting violence, there is always an external reason that made them due so. The external reason can range from bad food at asylum center to usual socio-economics reasons or to ""they act so because we are there are"". Problem with this whole charade is that it is actually very racist. It is ethno-centrism that puts them, the others, to be in second class where they can only react to action and not initiate action.

But then again, this isn't some new phenomenon. I have lately been reading a book about history of Iran and in there in 60s and 70s, leftist intelligentsia acted totally illogically. First they accused shah on not modernizing the country and society, and when he did enact reforms, leftist intelligentsia blamed him on abandoning Iranian culture and turned back to roots, to Islam. There is a term for this, Gharbzadegi. Let me quote the book that I am reading...

*""Many of the most secular intellectuals - virtually all leftist, and most of them Marxist-Leninists - began to discover the virtues of the country's religious culture and traditions, decry Weststruckness, and advocate cultural authenticity and 'nativism'. The terms gharbzadegi and gharbzadeh (variously translated, respectively, into 'Westoxication' and 'Westoxicated', 'Westruckness' and 'Weststruck'), which Jalal Al-e Ahmad had used to attack the cultural and politico-economic influence of the West, became everyday words used by members of virtually all classes to denounce state projects and decisions as well as anyone or anything they did not like.""*

When I read that chapter in the book, I had a genuine oh my god, I can't believe what I am reading. Of course situation in Iran isn't comparable to situation in West, but it does shed some very worrying thoughts when you read online for example of some fringe hardcore feminists or gays converting to Islam due to belief that true Islam is tolerant and accepting. Luckily in the West there is very hard backlash going on against regressive left so things will turn to better.",2016-01-13 09:23:26+00:00,cywgfin,3,t1_cywc3vh,12886,Israel
1,"Christians and Jews have always been second class citizens in Muslim countries. If Jewish or Christian communities became too prosperous and gained political power there was soon a pogrom that with ransacking and murdering of that communities members. The only way a Jewish or Christian community could live in a Muslim country was to be subservient to the ruler in hope that he would protect the community.

In case of Iran and Saudi Arabia, you have to understand that there are de-jure and de-facto laws. The law book may say that as a Jew or Christian, you are allowed to produce and consume alcohol for your own communities needs, but de-facto situation is that when the religious police comes to knocking your door, they dictate what the law is. Case in point, my mother-in-laws car was once stopped in Teheran in the 80s because she the police saw that she had finger paint in her finger nails. She tried to bleed to them that as Jew she was allowed to put it, and that anyways it was an accident because she was in wedding yesterday. Police was going to take her away, but she kept her foot out of the police car and refused to close the door. In the end they settled that she removed finger paint at that moment. If they would have taken her to police station, there is no knowing what would have happened, they executed thousand in those days.",2016-01-13 08:48:45+00:00,cywfvl7,7,t1_cywf8dx,2254,europe
2,"&gt; It's really convenient to paint a narrative of ungrateful immigrants and I'm sure there are some who turn up and expect the moon on a plate, but I imagine most people just want to find a real place to live, get a job and take care of their families. Instead they are placed in a makeshift ""camp"" which is, as I said, a prison and then told ""we'll let you leave eventually""

Where do you think that they could get a job? Finland already has unemployment rate of 9.4%. If you don't have university degree from renounced university from STEM with years of experience working for leading companies in the field, then your chance to find work is very low. If you aim to do manual work, you still need a vocational degree and ability to speak good Finnish. The thing is that Finland is post-industrial service economy that has specialized on high tech and high spec work, for native Finnish it is harder and harder to keep up with ever accelerating demands of the economy. That is largely why unemployment of immigrants is around 50%... Now a place to live, in Helsinki and other big cities a single room apartment costs from 500 to 1000â‚¬ with few months safety deposit demanded. As immigrant you are not qualified for assistance. 

The fact of the matter is that if for a person the choice is between life and death then he will be happy even the harsh reality of Finland.

12,"&gt; I am aware that Sweden has a de jure obligation to join the euro. However, having a de jure obligation does not mean that it is enforceable, particularly as the de jure obligation has no deadline and thus it is impossible to prove a breach.

That is under question mark. The EU Commission hasn't brought the case of Sweden to ECJ. If it would, I believe it would judge against Sweden and there would be consequences on breach of the accession treaty.

&gt; Irrespective of the legal question, there is also a political question and a democratic question and an economic question. And the answer to each of these is that Sweden should not join the euro. This is why the Commission has refrained from legal proceedings.

The problem is that a single market can't work without single currency. The reason why the Maastrict treaty envisioned both the single market and the currency was to ensure that the market truly would be leveled and states couldn't anymore support their own industries with competitive devaluations. Finland for example already has suffered from Sweden's decision on not joining the Euro, during the financial crisis the Swedish Kruna devalued sharply against the Euro making the Swedish pulp&amp;paper mills more profitable than the Finnish ones thus leading the pulp&amp;paper companies closing their units in Finland and not in Sweden. If both Sweden and Finland would be using Euro, the companies would have had to close units based on real cost factors, on where it is more efficient to produce pulp&amp;paper.

If part of the EU members don't have any intent on joining the single currency, then it is absolutely necessary for the EU Commission to start proceedings against these countries. If even after proceedings these countries don't want to join the single currency, the EU should seriously start to work the union on two different organizations, one that is dedicated on basic free trade, and a one that compromises Euro countries that want more closer union and who want to part take to the single market.",2015-09-17 11:53:44+00:00,cv4kqvj,7,t1_cv4kaw4,1459,europe
13,"Poland as a sovereign country has the right to hold an referendum on joining the Euro or not. However this right doesn't free the country from consequences of the said referendum in case the vote would be No.

When Poland joined the EU, it also accepted the Maastricht treaty that included obligation to join the common currency. Holding a referendum that would produce a No-vote for joining the Eurozone would be a clear violation of the accession treaty. One could try to make defense on the fact that Sweden has done the same, however that really doesn't work as A) Sweden is in violation of its accession treaty; B) While when Sweden joined the EU, there was no single currency, but when Poland joined the single currency was already formed. Furthermore in 2002 the ECB took the line that it would react against countries not joining the common currency. To this point eastern member states that have not joined the currency union have done so by stating that they will join in the future when factor X-has become better. If Poland would organize an referendum and the answer would be No, there would be no denying that Poland isn't joining the Euro.

Personally I think that ECB and Commission should start proceedings against Sweden on not joining the currency union. If Poland has a referendum and the answer is no, then too against it a legal proceeding should start.",2015-09-17 08:58:28+00:00,cv4i6r8,3,t1_cv4fozu,9717,europe

15,"&gt; But that is besides the point that I was making. It is dehumanizing to treat refugees like a piece of meat that can be distributed to countries to which they did not even apply.

It is not dehumanizing at all. They broke the law already by entering the EU area illegally. If the European states would act like other countries in the world, they would ship them back. However what they are now doing is offering these people safe place inside Europe. If they don't want to, they can always return on where they came from.

19,"&gt; Lots of level headed common folk from big cities like Damascus and Cairo who are no more muslim than you are Christian.

I think the problem is that these people left their homes and now as they are in a strange new country with a strange culture, strange language and strange people, many people are so much struggling that instead of assimilating, they embrace their culture and ways even more than they would ever done in their home country. A good example of this is the Iranian community in the USA where people, both Muslim and Jewish descant, prefer to marry other Iranian immigrants thus keeping their culture and language alive. However the Iranian community in USA is a special case as the reason why they had to leave was the Islamic revolution in Iran, thus embracing religion or fundamentalist interpretation of it would be a sign of giving up against the enemy in their old home country. If the Arab immigrants would only try to keep up their language and culture alive, but would not embrace religion, there would be no big discussion about immigration.

Another thing to note is that most people who left Syria will not ever get the same societal position that they previously had. Europe is a post-industrial economy where automation is killing jobs in the middle and the only new ones are those that either need high value high knowledge/know-how or those that provide low value and low skills. Entrepreneurs, lawyers, civil servants, nurses, engineers and even doctors are in danger of not being able to practice their old profession, either because they don't know the language, their accreditation are not accepted, their education has no practical value, or their experience doesn't make them able to work in highly competitive global companies.   While materially they might get more living in Germany, for most of them, they will have to settle to accept being part of the working class/lower income classes which might also work against them wanting to assimilate to the society.",2015-08-31 08:07:55+00:00,culmmh4,3,t1_culiy9u,11758,europe

Finland

&gt; Years which really matter (e.g. if the invasion of Poland kicks it off, or Czechoslovakia, or operation Barbarossa to the surrender of Japan or surrender of Germany): ?

1939, Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact, Soviet invasion of Baltic countries and Poland. Winter war.
1940 - 1944 Continuation war to reclaim Karelia
1944 - 1945 War in Lapland, forced by Soviet demands to remove German army from Finnish territory
1944 - 1948 Years of danger, Fear of Soviet organized revolution, fear of Soviet invasion. Hiding of weapons in case of occupation.

&gt; Noun associated with the warfare period

Fear, Survival... If Soviet Union would have succeeded to invade Finland, the fear was that Finnish as a nation would cease to exist. At best case scenario the intelligentsia of the country would be destroyed either by mass executions or by sending them to Siberia. At worst case scenario the whole nation would be moved to Siberia and Russian settlers would be settled into Finland, thus annihilating the nation.

&gt; Noun associated with the end of the war

Survival, defensive victory... The Soviet Union couldn't invade and occupy Finland. The country was free from foreign occupier and stayed as democracy.

&gt; The role of your country in the war (e.g. pulling power, battlefield, punching bag): ?

Battlefield against its will. Defensive wars.

&gt; The perception of your country-men who fought within the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS (e.g. forced, traitors, nazis): ?

Neutral. Men who free willingly joined Waffen SS, 80% was motivated by patriotism, and 70% motivated by anti-Communism.

&gt; The role of national partisans within your country (e.g. miniscule, patriotic, necessary): ?

Which essentially shuts out more than half of the population on deciding how to run the society.

Europe is doing more than enough. Actually Europe is doing too much.

They come from cultures that are totally alien to European cultures, from societies that are totally alien to ours.

There are 60 million refugees in the world. If Europe would take them all, we would have to declare martial law just to keep up the rule of law.

30,"This conversation will drift from the original topic, but why not...

&gt; This isn't a problem, look up the definition of an ethno-religious group. This only appears to be a problem from the perspective of universalist religions but historically most religions were not universalist and arguably even in universalist religions in truth religion has a great impact on nationality

&gt; This has throughout history been the view of the majority of Jews and the nations they presided in, it's kind of the basic assumption of Zionism.

Jews were an ethno-religious group after the destruction of the Second Temple, but things started to change with emancipation in 19th-century, and a definitive break happened when the state of Israel was established in 1948. After the establishment of Israel, any person who didn't feel like belonging to the nation and society where they lived at that moment emigrated to Israel. Hence it is not a big jump to make a claim that those persons who staid in Western countries out of their free will, are nationals of the countries where they live, Judaism is just a religion or religious background to them.

What I think is that Israelis haven't really cough up with the fact that Israelis form now their own nation that is bound together not by religion but by common language and culture. This is manifested clearly with [Hofstede dimensions](http://geert-hofstede.com/israel.html). Another thing that Israelis haven't cough up is that their society is not multicultural anymore, it was before in 40s and 50s, but nowadays there is a monoculture where people who make the Aliyah are expected to assimilate into.

The problem I see is in the individual level. People with Jewish roots who have staid in Western countries clearly have made a decision on who they are - they are Finnish, German, American, etc... They may observe Judaism, or they may not. They are not Jewish as national. That should be respected. Currently there are two groups who don't respect this, the Israeli state and the anti-semitic/Israel crowd, both invoke the claim of double loyalties.

However person to become a Jewish-as-in-national they have to apply citizenship, citizenship is not granted automatically. The fact that Matisyahu hasn't applied for right of return makes a case that he shouldn't be treated as a Jewish-national, but as an American. He may belief to Judaism, but that only makes him Jewish-as-in-religion, which doesn't make him any less American.",2015-08-17 06:23:30+00:00,cu5n4v9,7,t1_cu5fgzh,17495,europe
32,"The problem is that the term Jew can refer both to a person with Jewish religion, and to a person whose nationality is Jewish. It hasn't helped that many in Israel don't want to even acknowledge the difference - a Jew is a Jew. It was only a couple of years ago when Jewish nationals in Israel could start to register themselves as non-religious and still keep Jewish as their nationality. Not to mention the Israeli state wants to treat the Jewish diaspora as Jewish nationals.

However Israel or Jewish religious traditions shouldn't have anything to do in this case as this case. In Western world people have freedom of religion and freedom of self identification. If Matisyahu practices Judaism, then he is Jew-as-in-religion, and if not, then he is not. In both of the cases he should be treated like any other American would be treated.

Unfortunately the organizers of the event had clearly strong bias against Israel &amp; Jewish-nationals thus he was treated very unfairly. I would use the term anti-semitic as the organizers identified him due to his religion/background and applied different treatment due to it.

* It is not your responsibility to provide. She is a Finnish citizen, she will have free degree, she will have student benefits (450e with housing benefits) and the government will guarantee her student loans (300e per month). The only one of whose survival you have to take care is yourself.
* As Finnish get their degrees for free, the first years that people study, they usually go out and party a lot, as they don't have that much things invested on getting their degree. If you are not studying too and enjoying the same life where you go out in Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, etc.. and instead work, then it might start to eat you out. You work, she parties, you are alone at home, she is with her new friends.
* You will not find a job from Finland that matches your education, especially not if you don't learn the language to a point where people can barely recognize that you aren't native. If you have a degree from prestigious world class university, then maybe you could get a position from some of the Finnish corporation, or if your specialization is something that is really special, then you might get a job. Please look jobs from the LinkedIn, but consider yourself warned.
* Think about your career, calculate your potential losses. If you don't work, or you don't work at position that matches your education and skills, you will have a black spot in your CV for that time period. Think about the alternative. What will happen if you continue working in your job? How much money you will be making by the time you are 25? Have you been promoted? Have you specialized more? Calculate the alternative, because that is the cost that you are going pay if you are not working and practicing your profession.

Essentially, I would really question your girlfriends decision study in Finland. Why not study in UK, or in Ireland? What I am saying, look for the alternatives, because if you don't go and study in Finland, then I am really afraid that you might be dealt with really bad cards. I am sure that your girlfriend is a lovely person and you two have great relationship and everything will go fine, but... what if you one day after 3 years of working in Finland in a menial job come back home and find it empty, with only a letter in the table... *""thanks Heisenbaker for all these years, you have been the best partner ever and I love you so much, the most I have ever loved, but I feel that I have changed during these years, and I think I need space to rediscover myself and restart my life, it's not you, it's me, love you so much, take care, XOXO""*

And don't get me wrong, I am not a bitter man who hates women or foreigners, I actually last weekend married the love of my life, an Israeli woman who serves here as diplomat, and we are moving at the end of next year to Israel. We have talked a lot about what it means that I move with her to Israel, and in the future we move together where her posts will be. Our compromise has been that she can pursue her diplomatic career, but she can only work in places where I can work too, namely north-western Europe, and in case I have a good things going on career wise, either in Israel or in any other country, we will stay there extra years if I say so. And in case I want to start-up my own company or pursue a Ph.D. while we are in foreign post, she will support me, while in Israel I will support her.

54,"&gt; And automatic stabilizers and solidarity.

The problem with automatic stabilizers is that if you construct them wrong, what you will create is disincentive for local politicians to fix things. For example many have suggested that Eurozone should have common unemployment insurance. The problem with this is that different countries have different level of natural unemployment. Southern countries have for decades had higher unemployment due to rigid labor and business legislation. In contrast eastern and northern states have very dynamic labor and business legislation that have enabled their economies faster to generate new companies and new work opportunities thus enabling the countries in question to have in general much lower unemployment and higher total workforce participation numbers than those in south.

Not to mention that the whole system would be prone to corruption. In countries were the black economy is bigger, there would be huge incentives for politicians and states to give blind eye on people falsely claiming unemployment benefits as the money that pay the benefits comes from outside the country. 

The only way you can set up pan-European systems like this is that if you also have supervision and surveillance mechanisms backed up by European courts and police force independent and above member states. If for example European supervisors think that there is fraud going over anywhere, they can just their police force and investigators, lock up government offices, confiscate all evidence, apprehend and question civil service and political leadership freely, and in case crimes are committed, throw the offenders for life. For example all the Greek prime ministers and finance ministers since the country joined the Euro should be now under trial on their involvement to fraud.

&gt; The banking crisis started in 2007, with the resulting economic slump causing trouble in addition to the bank guarantees.

The banking crisis started in 2007 in the USA. It expanded to Europe later, and in some countries like Ireland troubles came from the government giving unilateral guarantee for all bank deposit. In Greece that never happened. The Greek banks were okey. The problem was the government that had hidden debt and deficit for the last decade, essentially defrauding investors. The case of Greece was essentially the same as the case of Enron, however in case of Enron its chief officers got jail sentences ranging from decade to few decades, no one in Greece has been sent to jail.",2015-07-29 10:07:39+00:00,ctk3com,9,t1_ctk33vx,968,europe
55,"&gt; No it doesn't. The ECB is at the process of printing a few trillions atm and none of that went towards Greece.

ECB doesn't hand over directly money to member states, nor does it directly buy bonds. What the ECB has done is to increase buying of bonds from the secondary markets. The effect of this has been that the interest rates have fallen very low and been kept there. However what ever loans member states now take, they must pay them back later. With current interest rates paying the loans back or taking care of interest payments is not a problem, however there is no guarantees that this would continue forever. If a member state becomes too heavily indebted, sooner or later it will see its bond rates increase and its refinancing position coming worse.

Monetization or wiping of the debt is out of question. Current treaties don't give any option to this and thus would need a treaty revision. Any treaty revision that would make the ECB print money, or monetize debt, would be vetoed by northern states, not to mention it isn't sustainable financial policy as it easily leads member state governments to be irresponsible on their finances. Just think if the German government would have engaged into same policies as the Greek state did in the 00s.

56,"Any stimulus needs to be paid by the rest of the Eurozone countries. ESM works by being guaranteed by Eurozone countries. Any debt that is taken by it is calculated to be part of the debt of guarantee countries. If Greece is to receive any money either from ESM or from possible European Investment Fund then it needs to be paid by other countries. Essentially other countries need enact austerity home so that money can be sent to Greece. That is politically and economically non-functional suggestion.

Another thing is that just pushing money doesn't work. Pushing money to economy only works if that money is invested productively so that it starts to produce profit. The Greek state did this before the financial crisis by loaning money and pushing it to the economy. The only thing it achieved was bleeding money out of Greece faster.

Not to forget that global financial markets are open. The reason why individuals and companies are not investing into Greece, on why it doesn't receive for example venture capital is because it has a very hostile business environment. If you want stimulus to Greece it needs to happen via liberating private sector to function by cutting red tape and government mandated restrictions. This doesn't make Greece a neoliberal hell hole, but just makes it function like the Nordic states that combine one of the most free markets on earth with social protections.",2015-07-28 12:30:03+00:00,ctiw80s,5,t1_ctivzbs,623,europe
57,"&gt; After 2007? Yes. They only did so because their only other option was default, since there were no emergency liquidity options in the eurozone until the creation of the EFSF and later the ESM, when it became clear that the bond rates of all eurozone countries would continue to rise until the eurozone shattered without it.

That is just the first step. If Europe wants a fiscal union then it also needs policy union that align spending to be balanced.

&gt; Before 2007 Greek debt was relatively stable around 100%. Higher than commendable, but not a crime. What really triggered their crisis was the extra debt they had to take on to bail out their banks, something almost every EU government did and accepted as necessary. Now the banks, they were really overleveraged and they collapsed through their own excessive credit, yes. Not Greece.

Before the revelations of 2010, the Greek state had hidden the true financial position it had. Lets look at numbers...

* 2006 / 100% / -5.2%
* 2007 / 106.1% / -5.7%
* 2008 / 105.4% / -6.5%
* 2009 / 112.9% / -9.8%

The Greek financial position was going towards the hell in 2006 and fast. The situation deteriorated even more in 2007 and 2008, and at the end of 2009 the financial crisis reached Europe. And the reason why the Greek financial position worsened wasn't because the Greek state had to bail banks, the banks were fine till 2012 when the Greek state made restructuring of bonds, the Greek financial position collapsed because the state was bleeding money in accelerating pace.

61,"&gt; Austerity measures or better known as decimating your GDP so your debt-to-GDP ratio can get out of control. Greece can't cut its way out of debt.

If you build your GDP growth on ever continuing amount of debt, then there has to be a stop at some point. In 2010 the Greek state needed to take the amount of 10% of GDP of new debt to cover the budget. The natural stop came when the markets priced the Greek state out of the debt market.

What we both agree is that Greece can't cut its way out of debt, however it can cut its way out of overspending. This is something the creditors have tried to make Greece to do. To stop overspending. After overspending is cut, then Greece needs to either enact reforms that make government spending very dynamic allowing temporary cuts in case of budget shortfall, or by running high budget surplus. The Troika preferred Greece to have strong budget surplus as then it could start paying back debt, but also it would have some buffer in case of a financial downturn or shortfall in revenue.

&gt; The haircut wouldn't have been 100%, and we could have offered emergency assistance to private lenders. It would have cost us â‚¬50bn, according to some estimations.

How big do you think the riot would have been if Greece would have cut 30% of its budget spending? It is one thing to say that the debt should have been cut or restructured, it is another thing to live on the next day after the budget cuts have been made to make sure that Greek state runs a balanced budget.

&gt; The answer to that question is pretty simple: we won't.

62,"&gt; It's not Syriza that kept putting Greece's credit lines in doubt or unilaterally forbade the Greek citizens to acces their savings.

It definitely was. Greece had snap elections that brought into power a hard-line leftist-Marxist government that promised to roll back reforms, to kick out the Troika... Markets saw the writing in the wall. By rolling back reforms and getting out of the bailout program, the Greek state would run out of money and default. This caused a bank run. The only reason why Greek banks were not shutdown before was the ECB was willing to raise the ELA limit in hopes that the negotiations with Greece and the Troika would lead to Greece returning to the bailout program. That didn't happen thus ELA was frozen.

&gt; Yeah, sure, the banking crisis, the resulting economic slump, the asphyxiating austerity conditions for the temporary credit and the preceding mismanagement of the other Greek parties are just irrelevant. It's all Syriza's fault!

Yes it is. If you destabilize the market with your actions, then it is your fault.

&gt; Recognizing their mismanagement of the Eurozone financial institutions and taking responsibility for the debt snowball in the period 2007-2011

Hold on. Are you saying that the fault of Greek state running record high deficits and taking enormous amounts of debt was the fault of Eurozone financial institutions? ",2015-07-28 10:33:15+00:00,ctiu1ft,5,t1_ctitl8v,1838,europe
63,"&gt; Not push a state into social and economic collapse hoping to be repaid money that can never be repaid.

In 2009 the Greek primary budget deficit was -10% of GDP, translates to 30% to 40% of budget. Are you saying that the other Eurozone states should have just handed the money? How do you explain that to poorer Eurozone states like Estonia which enacted heavy austerity measures?

&gt; The solvency of Greek banks had nothing to do with the status of the negotiations. A private banking system should be insulated from Government decisions regarding its debt and negotiations with creditors over how to repay it.

Greek banks and pension funds own Greek state bonds. Those bonds are nearly worthless. The only reason why Greek banks have functioned to this date is that the ECB has made an exception and accepted them as collateral as long as the Greek state participated to the bailout program.

&gt; But when uncertainty about paying wages, the possibility of default, and other fears hit the populace, it was the ECBs primary responsibility to prevent a bankrun by making any and ALL necessary liquidity (banknotes) there to reassure people their funds were safe.

No. That is not the function of ECB. If you want to make that responsibility of the ECB then you need a treaty change which essentially translates on member states giving more of their sovereignty regarding banking and financial markets to the ECB.

&gt; Instead the ECB broke its mandate and added to the uncertainty by making strategic choices about when to review Greek collateral, when to extend or hold fast ELA levels, and when to force capital controls to force an agreement. If Greek banks were solvent--as the ECB obviously believes they were--there was no legal basis per mandate to withhold ELA from them.

ELA stands for Emergency Liquidity Assistance. It is exceptional that ELA funding has to be given to a bank or to a whole banking system of a country. If ECB would have followed strictly its own rules, they would have frozen and withdrawn ELA much before. The only reason why they continued ELA was that Greece was participating to the bailout program.

&gt; By the way, Greece did make all its repayments up until June without having a single euro given to them since 2014. But there's a limit to how far any state can stretch finances when its debt burdens are larger than it can service while still paying its internal obligations.

The markets saw early on that Greek state didn't have money to pay all the obligations it had without the help of the second bailout program. In addition to that the markets also saw that populist policies of Syriza would worsen the financial outlook of the state even more. All of these actions made the Grexit more probable thus markets reacted by pulling the money out. If Syriza instead would have continue to cut down state budget, enacted market friendly reforms, made sure to participate on the second bailout program, markets would have been ensured that Greece will stay in Euro and thus there would have been no bank run.

&gt; Realise that for every euro that gets taken out of the economy via cuts, tax raises, and wage reductions, thats one less euro to ensure domestic demand. That's lack of demand causes falling prices, and falling prices cause deflation. Deflation itself is indicative of increasing unemployment (as shops close because they can't stay profitable), a contraction of economic activity, and a loss of wealth.

The Greek primary deficit in 2009 was -10% of GDP. The whole economy of Greece was inflated by money flowing into the economy. There is no way that this would have continued for ever. What has happened to this point is normalization of the situation. Last year the Greek state was running a small primary surplus meaning that the state ran on the revenue that it gathered, not relying on loan money.

&gt; One more thing: Creditor countries need to stop hoarding money. German surplus this year will be ~ 8% this year. Illegally. Well in excess of the maximum legal limit of 6%.
This irrational culture of savings is creating a trade disparity that is hurting nations who need it to grow their own export industries. It is helping to push debtor nations into further debt because they can't find buyers for their products.

Germany has more or less balanced trade with other Eurozone countries. What sets Germany and Finland different is that they have balanced trace with China and surplus with many other non-Eurozone states. If German exports to China are cut down, that doesn't enhance the trade balance of Greece at all.

&gt; Creditors need to start talking right now about how they intend to level the trade playing field. Otherwise, there's no point in debtor nations staying in the EU, and the situation will resolve naturally when the devalued euro appreciates after they leave.

Greece has all the tools to level the playing field. It just needs to do the same that UK did in the 80s. Bust the union. Cut down public sector. Cut down red tape. Make business environment more friendly.",2015-07-28 09:59:33+00:00,ctitjl9,5,t1_ctit9gy,1189,europe

65,"&gt; To recognise that the austerity measures we are demanding are destructive and are making it more unlikely with each passing day that the Greek state will ever be able to repay a substantial amount back to us.

Austerity measures or better known as living by the money you have.

&gt; To recognise that we have colossally screwed up by lending to an insolvent Greece back in 2010 instead of restructuring its loans there and then.

The Greek primary deficit in 2099, deficit before interest payments and amortization, was -10.1% of the GDP. That translates to around 30-40% of the Greek state budget. Lets say that the Greek debt would have been restructured in 2009/2010. The Greek banks would have gone bust. The Greek pension funds would have gone bust. What do you think the result of this would have been? Just think of the amount of riots when budget is cut by 30% in a single night, banks are bust, pensions are not paid, etc... For Greek state not to collapse, even with debt restructuring, the state would have needed emergency loans and heavy austerity measures and reform.

&gt; And specifically from our leaders, I want them to own up to the fact that they have cost us billions by unloading banking losses and exposure onto our shoulders via Greece. I want them to own up to the fact that most of that money is gone forever. I want them to stop ""bailing out"" Greece in the hope that they somehow won't have to face up to their mistakes. I want them to finally grant Greece debt relief, and I want them to apologise to their electorates.

Most of the Eurozone leadership admits that money loaned to Greece will not be gotten back. The question now is will the Eurozone countries even get the money back in nominal amount. In case of debt relief, debt relief basically means loaning new money to Greece so that Greek state can pay to IMF and ECB. The loans that Eurozone has given aren't paid now, but with current schedule starting from 2020 ending up to 2050, and there is possibility that the maturities are extended even beyond these.",2015-07-28 09:40:15+00:00,ctit9q3,5,t1_ctisx78,1513,europe

Once a firm goes bust, most of the knowledge and operating processes, the intellectual property of the firm, is gone. This is a huge net loss to the Greek economy.

Another hit that the Greek private sector is taking is uncertainty of recapitalizing banks. If the Eurozone loans money for the Greek state to do it, then it will make the Greek state debt even more unbearable. If Eurozone doesn't loan the money, then banks needs to be recapitalized by doing a bail-in, essentially everybody that has more than 100k EUR as deposits will loose the money over that amount. This will cause private individuals and companies to go bankrupt or will put them into a tight spot for the next years to come.

This is another crisis and it was totally unavoidable. Syriza caused it 100% by its own action.",2015-07-28 08:27:01+00:00,ctis84d,5,t1_ctiruzl,1454,europe

68,"Just a small note...

&gt;  We have radical Muslim African American here in the US.

Americans make the distinction between themselves, identifying people to African Americans, Irish Americans, Hispans, but when Europeans make the distinction between natives of the country and with recent immigrants, then suddenly that is wrong.

For example in this case, we have a person that was born in Kosovo to Kosovan Albanian parents who immigrated to Germany as refugees. The native language of the child was Albanian and the culture where he was brought up was Kosovan Albanian culture. That upbringing didn't just end up when they moved to Germany, he was still with his parents and with the Kosovan Albanian community, while German culture and society were started introduce via education system and surrounding society.

Again against this background it is very hard to see how it is so wrong not to recognize him as German, but as an German Albanian or German Kosovan. Like I said before, you yourself make the distinction between people based on skin color. In here we don't make that distinction. If for example a German couple adopts a black baby from Africa, then that child is considered to be German, not African German or Black German, just a German. Or if an German and Zambian have a child, if that child is either brought up in Germany, or is introduced German culture from the birth, he or she is German.

The thing is that in America the nationality is based so much on the citizenship that you make distinction between different groups on the level of skin color that is then hidden under a brand of ethnic group. Why for example Barack Obama is seen as African American while his mother was white American, the family where he was brought up was a white, and his father was Kenyan? If you want to designate him as something, shouldn't the right designation be either mixed or mulatto.

I really have to wonder why it is so bad people make distinctions based on language and culture? Language and culture are something that a person has some control of, they can decide by themselves to embrace German language and culture, deciding to only speak German and deciding to follow cultural conventions of Germans. Skin color and ethnic background on the other hand are something that you can't change. So which society is better, the one who differentiates between language and culture, or one who differentiates between skin color and ethnic background?",2015-07-22 07:21:54+00:00,ctbvnji,7,t1_ctbf9q4,32645,worldnews

And yes, nationality isn't set on stone, but nationality also isn't just something that you can change when ever you want so.

72,"Americans have a different definition for nationality, the definition of who is an American and who is not is based largely on believing to the idea of United States and its Constitution, and the artifact that makes you an American is the citizenship that you either get on being born on the soil of USA or being naturalized as such. In the rest of the world things are much different. Nationality is not defined by citizenship, nationality is defined on identifying and being part of bigger group of people who identify each others as such. In Europe people nowadays identify largely based on language and shared culture, less on historical background. However there are other nationalities such as Jewish who have an ethno-religious based system of identifying on person being or not being a Jewish by nationality which is different than being a Jewish by religion.

The thing that I am alleviating is that US is a special case. You can't just take your values and views and apply them to the world as such. There are other views on what constitutes a nation and what defines person belonging to a that nation. Now if the article would have said ""ISIS executed German-Albanian kickboxing champion Valdet"" I would have had no problem with that title, but I do have a problem on liberal use of nationalities, because for me if you water down a nation and nationality, then you also water down the language and culture that is behind it.",2015-07-21 09:16:59+00:00,ctapjdc,7,t1_ctap7bo,1393,worldnews
73,"How do you define a nation? Let me quote...

&gt; According to Jughashvili's National Question: ""a nation is not a racial or tribal, but a historically constituted community of people;"" ""a nation is not a casual or ephemeral conglomeration, but a stable community of people""; ""a nation is formed only as a result of lengthy and systematic intercourse, as a result of people living together generation after generation""; or, in its entirety: ""a nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.""

In this case we have a person who was of an Albanian descent and who later joined ISIS. These things make me think that he wasn't a German. What we don't know is that did his parents talk German or Albanian in home? Did he talk German rather than Albanian as his native tongue? Did he identify on being an German? ... We don't know these things, but what we know is his descent, his decision in life, and that German young men are not joining ISIS in numbers, this all makes me think that he wasn't a German. 

Another thing to note that not being a German doesn't mean that he wouldn't have had right to stay in Germany. Germany welcomed his parents and he also had the right to stay there, however that doesn't make one a German, it can make a one a citizen of Germany if conditions are matched, but nothing more. Now you may think that there are no such things as nations, or that people should have the freedom to identify themselves, but at the end of the day what matter is how the rest see you. If you are not seen as belonging to a group of people, you are not part of that nation. If the thing would be otherwise then I would like to define myself as Jewish-Aryan-Muslim-Swedish-Arab-Chinese-African and if you don't think that I am not Jewish/Aryan/Muslim/Swedish/Arab/Chinese/African then I am offended and will think that you are a bigot.",2015-07-21 09:03:53+00:00,ctapcml,5,t1_ctap68h,729,worldnews

&gt; Intercommunal violence erupted on December 21, 1963, when two Turkish Cypriots were killed at an incident involving the Greek Cypriot police. The violence resulted in the death of 364 Turkish and 174 Greek Cypriots, destruction of 109 Turkish Cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000-30,000 Turkish Cypriots. The crisis resulted in the end of the Turkish Cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy; the nature of this event is still controversial. In some areas, Greek Cypriots prevented Turkish Cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings, while some Turkish Cypriots willingly refused to withdraw due to the calls of the Turkish Cypriot administration. Turkish Cypriots started living in enclaves; the republic's structure was changed unilaterally by Makarios and Nicosia was divided by the Green Line, with the deployment of UNFICYP troops.

&gt;  by 1964, enosis was a Greek policy that could not be abandoned; Makarios and the Greek prime minister Georgios Papandreou agreed that enosis should be the ultimate aim and King Constantine wished Cyprus ""a speedy union with the mother country"". Greece dispatched 10,000 troops to Cyprus to counter a possible Turkish invasion.

&gt; On 15 July 1974, the Greek military junta under Dimitrios Ioannides carried out a coup d'Ã©tat in Cyprus, to unite the island with Greece. The coup ousted president Makarios III and replaced him with pro-enosis nationalist Nikos Sampson. In response to the coup, five days later, on 20 July 1974, the Turkish army invaded the island, citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee. This justification has been rejected by the United Nations and the international community.

93,"&gt; If there was no austerity and no program i think the situation would have been much better, what do you think ?

In 2010 the primary budget deficit of Greece was 9.4% of GDP, meaning that before interest and debt payments Greek state was missing around 22,56 billion EUR. The total expenditure of the Greek state, not including interest payments, in 2010 was 64 billion EUR. If there wouldn't have been any bailouts, then the Greek state would have needed in 2010 to cut over 35% of its spending, the number would probably have been bigger due to cuts also depressing tax revenue, so without the bailout programs Greek state would have needed cut anywhere from 40% to 50% of all its expenditure. Can you imagine what that would have done?

Now the other option in 2010 would have been that Greece would have left the Euroarea and defaulted its loans. The estimates then and now would tell that the Drachma would loose half of its value compared to Euro. So the 1000e that you get now, would be only worth 500e. Actually could be even less, as if Greece would have defaulted and left the Euro, then they still would have needed to cut down spending to match it with tax revenue, or they would have needed to print money to match spending thus creating inflation, while this would have let your father to get his pension as it is, the real value of the pension would have gone down as printing of more Drachmas would have lowed the value of his pensions.

Then the best option is to think of an idea and create your own business.

96,"&gt; While i completely agree that what Tsipras did was foolish, there was also a real chance that Greece would be simply pushed out of the eurozone. My main problem with the agreement is that i can't really see unemployment dropping below 20% anytime soon.

Finland had major depression in the beginning of 90s and it took the economy around a decade and dot.com boom to recover fully. There are no short cuts to make the unemployment lower. It can only happen by enacting business friendly environment that fosters growth of new enterprises that grow and employ. Forcing unemployment down by hiring people to public sector will just make the state bleed money and make the public sector inefficient.

&gt; While I'm aware of the global tade imbalances, it would be a nice problem to have when we solve the internal imbalances problem first.

In a market economy you can't dictate the end result. Normally imbalances balance themselves automatically. If Greeks have trade deficit for too long, they soon ran into a situation where due to having less money they also buy less. The problem right now is that we have an edge case where corruption in a state lead to a situation where a whole country went too far.

&gt; I'll actually argue that the problem started actually a tad earlier - when Greece, Spain and Portugal joined EU, they also joined the global free market. And the free market worked in the way free markets do - older, more powerful northern companies won it over local ones and these countries were forced to 'specialize' itself in the industries with lower added value. Then they took another hit in 90' and 00' when Asian countries pushed prices of these commodities even lower.

When Greece, Spain and Portugal joined the EEC, there was no single market. Single market only become true in 1992. The global free market as we know it became true in 00s. The thing is that Greece, Spain and Portugal didn't in the 70s and 80s invest into R&amp;D. Compare these countries to Sweden and especially to Finland that then spend money and resources to industrial development programs that were modeled based on Japanese examples. Another thing to note is that many ex-Soviet countries like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have succeeded on generating high growth and go up in the industrial value chain. Estonia will over take both Greece and Portugal in few years in GDP per capita. The reason why they are succeeding and Greece, Portugal and Spain are failing is because ex-Soviet republic enacted business friendly environment to make sure that they will sooner or later have those home grown industries as after the collapse of the USSR they virtually didn't have anything.  

&gt; Which for Germany as a country makes perfect sense, but for the eurozone as whole and its own citizens not so much. Why not for the eurozone? This is an obvious one, because they become less competitve and in effect vulnerable on the structural faults of the EZ. Why not for its own citizens? Because a lion's share of the surplus goes to the companies and not to the households, thus while Germans enjoy a state close to full employment:

If wages in Germany would have risen more, the German companies would outsourced or moved their production into low cost countries, that would have essentially meant moving production to China or south-east Asia. In that case the whole Eurozone and EU would have lost due to this development.

In case of money, the problem in all developed countries is that automation is replacing middle income work which has driven the situation to point where there are only two segments of economy that are growing: low skilled low value jobs, and high know-how high value jobs. This is a global problem. Forcing wage increased will just force companies to outsource and automate jobs. The real solution on making people to earn more is to embrace life-time learning and having multiple careers during once working life. That is what Nordic countries have tried to do, they haven't perfectly succeeded in it, but the results are at least much better than what Germany and France, not to mention southern countries have done.

&gt; All what I wrote in the earlier post was that Spanish government did nothing wrong debt-wise, that is it didn't take loans to finance current activities.

Yes, but... Spanish government knew that the increase of tax revenue came from a construction bubble that would sooner or later burst, and when it would burst it would also decrease tax revenue. When the bubble burst, instead of accepting that, the Spanish government enacted a stimulus program that would stimulate construction industry by building new infrastructure. The problem was that the bubble that burst was too big, and the Spanish state couldn't invest money properly, thus creating huge amount of waste. That is why Spanish deficit ballooned and soon the country had taken lots of debt.
 
&gt;&gt; The banks that ran into trouble in Spain were the local savings banks that were run by local politicians.
&gt; Because the big ones possessed too much systemic risk and needed to be bailed out, and these costs greatly contributet to the increase in Spanish debt.

No. The big Spanish commercial banks like Santander Group didn't need any bailout because they had anticipated the burst of construction bubble. It was the small regional savings banks, the Cajas, that ran into trouble. The boards of these banks were usually manned with local politicians who used these banks to fund local construction projects. 

&gt; Of course it doesn't take off the responsibility from spanish politicians for the bubble. It's just these flows were creating additional incentives for banks and developers, what made the bubble worse. Sounds fair?

True. There would have been construction and property bubbles in Spain and Ireland. However the size and the impact were dictated not by available money, but local governments and politicians who didn't cool down the economy when they had the chance. Compare this for example to Finland where the government in the boom years of 00s postponed all public construction projects to cool down the construction industry that was in danger of overheating.",2015-07-16 12:54:48+00:00,ct5a9mw,9,t1_ct59fw2,2054,europe
97,"&gt; I understand the concerns but Bailout 3 isn't a good enough solution to the problem. That money will never be seen again, so they might as well forgive large quantities of it so that Greece can try and actually get back on its feet.

You make the same mistake that Syriza did. You insist that solution to debt must be given first. From the point of creditors, what Greece first must do is to prove that it can deliver surplus budgets, that it can enact policies that make the economy grow and don't put the country of brink of abyss. Because if the creditors first give the debt relief, the next Greek government can just renegade on the agreement and drive the country again to the same point and ask for further debt relief. No, debt relief is the carrot on behaving and governing well. Debt relief and structuring  were already mentioned in the 2012 package, if Greece would have continued in the second program, this wouldn't have never happened.

However if Grexit happen, the political turmoil will be so great that there is no certainty on what will happen, Greece could easily become Venezuela of Europe.

104,"&gt; What would you like to see as a plan B? If you see things as being a local Greek problem and not a structural of the eurozone, then sure, Greece have to start to live on its own taxes (they actually achieved it so far), and improve their tax collection, prevent tax evansion, improve means of ease of doing business (although i strongly disagree that it can successfully be achieved with removing workers' right). But keeping 4,5% primary surplus? Fire selling national assets? Didn't went it too far?

As long as you have time, you have hope. What Syriza should have enacted first is legislation that would have secured payment of debt in all conditions, for example enacting law that dictates priority of spending. This would have stabilized the market and there wouldn't have been massive bank run to the Greek banks that there was now. It would have been much better for the Greek economy to shut down parts of the government from functioning, or give public sector employees pay as Euros and IOU like California did. This would have been enough to create large public pressure for the Eurogroup to negotiate on restructuring the Greek debt. However what Syriza did was to destroy market confidence in instance and also any trust that there was in the Eurogroup - you don't want to give loans to an entity that is bleeding money.

&gt; And because there can't be surplus Germany without deficit Greece, or hossa and bessa in the same time in all EZ countries, it makes no sense to punish one side with an always painful internal devaluation.

There is the world beyond Eurozone and that is the problem. The problems of southern economies started in 90s with introduction of new global competition from manufacturers and producers in China and south-east Asia. Lets make an example of  textile industries, in 2005 the  [multi fibre agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Fibre_Arrangement) came to an end and opened European markets for new competition. What this meant was that huge number of textile manufacturers in southern countries either went out of business or downsized. The same happened in all sector of southern industries because they were lower in the value chain than northern industries. 

Of course in the north there were also problems with increased competition, in some countries like Germany the answer was to do structural reforms, in some countries like in the Nordics the answer was to put more money into R&amp;D so that there would be industrial transformation to achieve a higher place in the value chain. What happened in the southern countries was trying to hide from the problem. In Spain politicians decided to embrace the construction bubble, in Portugal and Italy governments did nothing, and in Greece the state decided to run even higher deficit and hide it to prop up the economy.

&gt; That's not only a Greek problem. Look at the Spanish case. Their govt did nothing wrong in terms of debt, but free capital movements from the surplus countries in the rush for better interest rates created a real estate bubble, which left Spain in not so much better condition than Greece.

No no no, like I said before, the Spanish politicians embraced the construction bubble. What that meant that instead of trying to cool down construction by decreasing public construction projects, by increasing taxes on new construction, by not giving new building permits, they instead did the opposite. The banks that ran into trouble in Spain were the local savings banks that were run by local politicians. Essentially what happened was collusion of politicians, developers and unions to create more and more new construction.Not to mention that it wasn't the surplus of northern countries, but US Fed and Japanese central bank that pushed cheap money to global markets after the 9/11.

&gt; EZ needs a fiscal transfers' system similar to American one. And by 'needs' I mean it MUST be implemented sooner or later if we want to think about euro in 10-, 20- years time as a european currency and not a failed project.

Fiscal union can only work if there is also sharing of sovereignty. If southern countries keep the same policies that they have to this day had, then the whole Eurozone makes a bankruptcy eventually. The reason why northern countries are so strict with finances is that they have more long term view. For example in Finland the government sees that pension will rise from 12% to 15.7% in 2030 to 2050 when the demographic situation becomes worse. Greece already spends more than 16% to pensions, and their demographic situation hasn't even started to decline. The problems of today are small compared to the problems of tomorrow if reforms are not enacted today. 

&gt; But you can't gamble with what you don't have in the first place. Where is well being when you have 25% unemployment, no industry, have cut much already but were told to cut more after 30% decline of economy, were told to keep 4,5% primary surplus? The 'destiny' is in a catch-22 situation, where the outcome of each decision depends entirely on your view and understanding of economics.

108,"&gt; But still a have a few problems with the quoted sentence itself. Syriza didn't cause the damage by its own decisions per se, it was rather because they stopped ""extending and pretending"", which caused this immediate halt. Ultimately now we can say it was stupid to act so because they finally signed the agreement, but at the time there were both economic and political premises to not sign and seek other forms of agreement. (and there still are economical premises, it's just what we learned that the political ones didn't exist)

Syriza stopped ""extend and pretend"" without having any plan-B or anything to offer for the Eurogroup. Lets look this from the other point of view...

If Eurogroup in January would have conceded to cut down the debt that they own, lets say they would have made a really deep cut and the debt would be now only 120% of GDP, then what? The debts that would have been cut were not a current problem as Greece starts to pay back then only in 2020 and in 2022. The debt to ECB and IMF can't be cut. And there would be no new loans coming to Greece because cutting Greek debts would lead huge political ramifications in central and northern European countries, if the Eurogroup would be not only cutting debt and then giving new money to Greece, there would be rioting in the north, citizens couldn't accept that ever. Not to forget that at the end of the day, Greece and Syriza would have come to this exact same point anyway, they wouldn't have had money to pay back IMF and then ECB.

What Tsipras and Varoufakis did was to gamble with the threat of saying no. What they thought would happen is chaos in the market that would at the end of the day force Eurogroup to surrender to Greek demands. However what happened is that market already had factored Syriza and Greek crisis in and thus the markets didn't react at all to OXI. The fault of driving Greece over the edge belongs totally to Syriza and especially to Tsipras and Varoufakis who gambled with the destiny and well being of the whole nation.

111,"&gt;&gt; The Greek debt has to be cut because Syriza lead government just caused immense damage to the Greek economy by walking out from the second bailout program and at the end causing the halt of the whole economy.

&gt; /s?

Not at all. The mistake the Syriza did was to walk out from the second bailout program at the beginning of this year. After that happened Troika stopped giving new payments to the Greek state. The Greek state had to survive with their budget surplus and pay with it loan payments back. This would have been barely possible if the Greek people wouldn't have become alarmed, first tax revenue went down when people stopped paying their taxes and then Greek savers started a slow bank run to get their money out of the banks while they could. This all started in January. Everything would have come to an halt earlier if the ECB wouldn't have continuously raised ELA limits, however after the second bailout program ended, there was no base anymore to rise the limit of ELA, actually it should have been denied but to limit damages ECB just froze it.

Now if Syriza would have continued to be inside the second bailout program, Troika would have given payments that they could have used to pay loans. Staying inside the second bailout program might also have increased trust of Greek people and they wouldn't have stopped paying taxes nor started to pull monies out of the banks.",2015-07-16 08:03:16+00:00,ct55c9d,3,t1_ct55607,631,europe

Another thing to think about is that cutting down government bureaucracy and corruption takes huge amount of time, it can easily take a decade or another to make the Greek civil services run as efficiently as they do in the Nordics, thus in the mean time it is best to just liberate and deregulate as much of the private sector as possible.

However just cutting the debt for example to 2/3 isn't the right way to do it. Any Greek debt cut should be done via dynamic debt restructuring where debt moratorium is attached to debt to GDP ratio. For example now it is useless to ask Greece to pay anything, the best that can be asked from Greece is to run surplus budgets and the Greek state to live with the money that it gathers. When the Greek economy rebounds again, economic growth is restored and Greece hits for example a certain target like debt to GDP ratio of 120% then Greece will start to repay and amortize part of the debt, when the ratio hits 100% another portion until Greece can handle all its debt.

Of course this kind of policy means that there has to be vigilant inspections to the finances of Greek state so that they don't funnel loaned money and that they account everything correctly.

[Historical GDP per capita](http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/Historical_Statistics/horizontal-file_02-2010.xls)

If we look at the year 1, GDP per capita based on regions of modern states

* 809$ in Italy
* 550$ in Turkey
* 550$ in Greece
* 473$ in France
* 408$ in Germany

In year 1000...

* 450$ in Italy
* 600$ in Turkey
* 400$ in Greece
* 425$ in France
* 410$ in Germany

In year 1500...

* 1100$ in Italy
* 600$ in Turkey
* 433$ in Greece
* 727$ in France
* 688$ in Germany

The point to make in here is that Rome and Byzantium were empires that enjoyed windfalls that their their large empires produced. When the Roman empire collapsed, the Italian GDP dropped until reorganization of its economy enabled it to produce more than at the high times of Rome. Now if you look at France and Germany, the core areas of Merovingian and Carolingian empires, they also suffered from the collapse of the Roman empire, but from 1000 to 1500 they were growing and producing more wealth. 

So definitely life in Byzantium was better after the collapse of the Roman empire, however the difference was not vast, and after western reorganization of kingdoms, administration and economy those new kingdom and countries grew very fast and rapidly.",2015-07-15 11:47:49+00:00,ct41ely,6,t1_ct40n9q,2708,europe
124,"&gt; For the time period that Byzantium existed, what was there in the west? Actually west got a kick start that lead to renaissance when Constantinople fell and many left for the west (Italy).

The reason why people make the mistake on thinking that there was nothing in the west during middle-ages is that there was no single empire and capital that would have been built with enormous monuments. However in the west what you had was enormous amount of distributed development. Most of the development happened in regional level and was concentrated on building castles, fortifying small towns, building cathedrals, water works, etc... In cases where kingdoms were more prosperous and had more resources, new grand monuments were build, for example [Norte Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris) in Paris. This huge amount of development that was achieved was darkened with the arrival of black plague that killed huge number of population, and took the next 150 years for the populations to recover.

135,"&gt; Then maybe the issue is the GDP getting murdered by the austerity (the income) and not the spending ?

The problem is that the Greek GDP was ballooned by sovereign debt bubble. In 2006 the budget deficit was 5.2%, in 2007 it was 5.7%, in 2008 it was 6.5%, in 2009 it was 9.8% and in 2010 it was 15.7% of GDP. In 2010 the primary deficit, that is deficit before interest payments 9.6%. What happened that Greek governments loaned more and more money to fuel the economy, but at the end of the day it became so badly indebted that markets wouldn't anymore loan money to it. The last 5 years the Greek economy has declined. Many estimate that the Greek economy had before Syriza took power to hit the point where it would have been without the debt bubble.

&gt; Because germany as a way bigger GDP. Per capita Germany spend WAYYYYYYY more money on every citizens.

And Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia, etc... all have smaller GDP per capita than Greece and they are not complaining. The reason why Greek are feeling pressure is that they are adjusting to a lower level of GDP where they would had naturally been without the debt bubble. 

&gt; Actually no, the Troika was deciding the conditions on that one ? People were saying Varoufakis tried to negociate with the results we all know; and they started at him for 5min without moving like he insulted them, then they started repeating their conditions for ""the only possible agreement"" ? Or did i got everything wrong ?

Varoufakis didn't want to cut pensions at all. The compromise that the Juncker and Institutions came up that no pensions would be cut but EKAS would be cut. I would put my blaming finger on this to Syriza. Do remember that if pensions would be cut, it would hurt mostly ex-public workers that are also voters of Syriza.

&gt; Sorry but the fact that some countries has it worse than greek doesn't make greece's situation any better. Whether you are loan sharking and harassing the guy for a 10% or 2.5% debt is still harassing them for a debt.

The interest rates that Eurozone countries pay are extremely low. But like I said before, if Greeks don't want to even pay interests, then they can default, but that will mean the rest of the Eurozone will not be loaning them any more new money.

&gt; So according to you one of the best way to a sustainable greece debt swapping with another debt with new interests piled on top of all the pasts ones (ie more debts in the end) ? Isn't that what killed a lot of third world countries like ressource rich african nations or in southern america ?

The interest rates that Greece pays are very low, if they would be high then yes, it would be bad for Greece. The idea has constantly been that when Greece gets its economy growing the debt will start to go decrease as the interest rates are so low that inflation itself will work to decrease loans.

&gt; That however can definitely help if no further debts pile on top of it

All Eurozone countries that have loaned money have already understood that Greece will not be able to pay back its debt in any short term future. That is why Greece got relief to interest rates and maturities of loans were extended. Because of political reasons debt haven't been nominally cut. If debt would be cut, then there would be backlash in other Eurozone states that would basically shut in any new emergency loans, not to mention that it would create moral hazard for the politicians of Greece to not reform the country as debt would be anyway be cut. The fine line that Eurozone politicians are trying to walk is to make sure that Greece doesn't go bankrupt and that it starts to grow, but get as much loaned money back as possible.",2015-07-14 13:18:55+00:00,ct2v7w6,12,t1_ct2uj4e,1534,europe
136,"&gt; But they couldn't without being kicked out of the EU and tsipras was elected to stay in. And germany openly used that to blackmail them into signing the most humiliating treaty they could get away with and that would maximise German money return.

They wouldn't be kicked, even SchÃ¤uble confirmed this. However if Greece would default its loans, then financially the best option for it would be to exit the Eurozone and thus the EU. However the Greeks could choose to say in the Eurozone as they would have had defaulted their loans, there would be no banks left in Greece, and there would be no Greek pensions funds left standing.

In case of humiliation, getting an 80 billion EUR loan from other Eurozone states is hardly humiliation. Should the other Eurozone state just gifted Tsipras with that 80 billion EUR? I don't think that would have gone so well with citizens of those Eurozone states.

&gt; If the golden dawn takes power, they won't give two shit. They'll probably even kill a few people from the get to go to earn themselves point at home. It's like trying negociating with putin while he's busy sending tank trains in Ukraine.

If people in Greece decide to vote for Golden Dawn, then they will. If Golden Dawn will default, then they will.

&gt; Neo liberalism and ""trickle down"" theory doesn't work. The living standard in free fall since 5y in Greece (despite enforced neoliberalism since 2007) are the exact proof of that. The GDP was ""rising"" but most of the population is living on 800/mo. Why ? Because the money all goes to the oligarchs and nothing moves.

Greece is hardly a paragon of neo liberalism. If you want to see liberal economic policies in action why not go the the Nordics, to Finland and Sweden. In these countries the people have understood that what isn't important is who owns production equipment, but on who income is redistributed in a manner that creates a fair and equal opportunity society for everybody. I would rather compare Greece to former Yugoslavia, it has a mixed economy, bloated public sector employees more people than it needs, publicly owned companies cause huge losses, etc... Let me make an example... Bank of Greece has 3000 employees. The Bank of Finland including financial authority has 600. Finnish economy is the size of Greek economy, even if you would scale the employee count of Bank of Greece by population, the Bank of Greece shouldn't have more than 1200 employees. This is the Greek model and it doesn't work. Just employing people in the public sector doesn't create value by itself, those people actually have to produce something to generate value.

&gt; Syriza was elected to change that. If you can't understand why people are tired of eating pastas for every meal, heating a day on two in winter, making do 20km without the car to save on gaz, ""forgetting"" 20% of their groceries at the register because they don't have enough money for it, and selling stuff lying at home to pay the rent month after month, then maybe you are a bit disconnected from the real situation in greece.

That is regrettable, but the situation is what it is. Maybe if the Greek state would redistribute money more fairly and not spend 16.2% of GDP to pensions, the situation would be better. Do remember that if pensions would be cut to 12% that Finland spend, it would free up to 9.9% billion USD that could be used for example assist people in need directly.

&gt; While that is definitely needed, stuff like ""let's sell the akropolis to germany"" is just completely bonkers. They'll fight you to the last before that happen. It's like if Germany decided to suddenly sell Berlin because of standing bills. That's never going to happen, Ever.

Nobody has suggested that to happen.

&gt; No they wouldn't. Germany makes ridiculous amounts of money on the poverty and lack of competitivity of southern countries like Italy or Greece. If their economy pick up again, germany loose money. So of course it's not popular in Germany to help them rebuild for example by letting them print Euros. Are you screams indicating i'm wrong ?

Varoufakis suggestion on creating an investment fund got positive feedback from many places, even from Finland. The idea wouldn't be on giving trouble economies to print money, but essentially starting a fund that would get money from the markets, essentially from QE, that would then be invested into financially sound project. The thing is that there are lots of opportunities in troubled countries for investments that currently don't happen because on political instability. For Germany and other creditor countries in the north, this kind of fund would be heaven sent as it would create work in the south, it would allow southern countries become more productive and thus ease up pressure for northern states to fund them either via bailout funds of via direct fiscal transfers.

In case of making south competitive, what you have to understand that countries have different industrial clusters and strengths. Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have lost competitiveness not against Germany or other northern countries but against Chinese and other manufacturers in developing countries. And if you look at Germany, most of its trade surplus is formed from exporting to non-EU/non-Eurozone countries, inside Europe it largely runs balanced trade. The problem is that only Germany and Finland have balanced trade with China. To make the situation better, troubled countries in south have to not only export more to other Eurozone countries, but they also have to work for their products and services on selling better around the world.

&gt; Paying they will; but if you touch the land i can already tell you they'll get 200 factory fresh reserve T72 tanks that were intended for Ukraine.

What do you do with tanks if you don't have money to fuel them? Not to mention that nobody actually wants Greece, it is just a place to go for a holiday, nothing more, nothing less.

137,"&gt; You think i'm exagerating ? FFS, they forced Syriza to start abolishing Ekas or no deal. What's EKAS ? A welfare subvention given to people who have to survive on pensions WELL below the poverty line (i'm talking people who make do with like 400â‚¬/mo). And apparently that too was part of ""Spending like a drunken Sailor"" (c).

Greece spend 16.2% of its GDP to pensions. Other countries such as Finland spend 12%, and Germany, Austria, etc.. spend over 10%. In the coming decades as the demographic status of European countries goes weaker, even more money is spend to pensions. In Finland that ages faster, at the peak in 2030 it is calculated that around 15% of the GDP is used to pensions. However the difference between Finland and Greece is that Finland has already long ago done cuts to pension and introduced age multiplier that cuts automatically pensions the longer people live, in addition to that pension funds have been funded better and longer time than Greeks have done. Fact of the matter is that Greek pension spending must be cut, there is no way around it.

The Greeks can either cut down EKAS or they can cut down pensions themselves. Something has to be done, if the Greeks won't do the cuts, then the Eurogroup will suggest cuts.

&gt; Well spoilers, how are they going to feed the population if all the money to do that is going back to germany ?

The Greeks pay less as interest payments (2.5%) than Spanish, Irish, Italians and Portuguese do. [source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11372369/Three-myths-about-Greeces-enormous-debt-mountain.html)  This is because loans given by Eurozone have given them loans with very low interest rates and with long maturity. The current financial crisis in Greece isn't because of the money loaned by Eurozone states, Greece is in trouble because it exited the second bailout program and thus couldn't refinance loans to be paid back to IMF and ECB. Debts that Greece has to other Eurozone states are not planned to be paid before 2020. If the Greek situation doesn't become better until that time, maturities of these bonds will further be extended.",2015-07-14 12:35:40+00:00,ct2u3fk,10,t1_ct2tpt4,1006,europe
138,"&gt; Most countries aren't forced 300B in debts.

Greece can at any time default their loans, that is their right as an sovereign. However what they don't have right is to think that after that the other Eurozone states or the IMF would give them loans. They wouldn't. The choice that successive Greek governments have made is to take loans and agree to do reforms that are intended to fix the issues plaguing the country.

&gt; And they aren't force dictated at debt point that they have to retroactivately revokate any and all spending passed by the elected governement since february.

If Greek governments don't want any new loans from the Eurozone or the IMF, then they can say OXI. But what the Greek governments can't do is to force other countries to give them new loans. As long as this is the situation, the Greek government has to follow the agreements that it has agreed to follow.

&gt; Nor they are held hostage by Germany because Germany as a personnal hate for Syriza &amp; friends because they refused to sell the country

The problem with Syriza is that they believed that they are vanguard of European economic revolution. They thought that with rhetoric and public relations work they could make masses to move in Spain, Italy and France so that these countries would also agree on moving against austerity and liberal economics. They failed in this. They also failed with their gamble against the rest of the Eurozone. They intended to cause havoc in financial markets by having an referendum of essentially Greece leaving the Eurozone if Institutions don't back out. However what happened is that the rest of the Eurozone called this bluff and after the OXI vote, there was no crisis, no panic in the markets. That is what Syriza did and that is where they failed.

If Syriza would instead of trying to go back to old statist ways of managing Greece would have made market liberalizations, would have cut excessive public spending and corruption, it would have gained political capital that it could have used to negotiate a real European Investment Fund that would stimulate growth especially in troubled economies. Unfortunately they didn't do this, they weren't constructive at all, and now everybody in Greece is paying for that now when the banks are closed for the third week in a row.

143,"The problem in here is that Finland in 1938, just before the second world war, was an agrarian state too. Farms were largely not mechanized because agricultural machinery costed too much, from the point of view of capital allocation, it wasn't profitable to buy and use tractors. Most of the population lived in the country side and not in the cities. Biggest city in the country was Helsinki that in 1944 had population of 275,000 inhabitants. Industrial development had started in the second half of 1800s and few cities such as Helsinki, Tampere, Viipuri and Turku had become major industrial centers.

The thing that made Finland different was that it had a working democracy and market based economy. While for example agriculture was not mechanized, capital was instead allocated to electricity production and electrification of country. In 1930 half of the rural homes and almost all urban homes had been electrified. In industry 90% of the work capacity was powered with electricity. Finnish companies of that time also invested into R&amp;D that later become leaders of their respective industries, such companies as Kone (elevators), WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ (diesel motors), StrÃ¶mberg (electric motors, now part of ABB), not to forget major paper-pulp companies that set up mills around Finland and generated huge amounts of exports.

If you look at GDP per capita figures, Finland in 1938 generated 3441 USD, which was still much behind old western countries such as Denmark (5668$), Great Britain (4685$), but was larger than Poland (1915) and Czechoslovakia (2882) from where the Polish economy would be more closer to Lithuanian economy. It should be remember that total USSR per capita GDP was then 2155$. However the Soviet GDP was largely formed from investing into military equipment and production faculties of military equipment while for example in Finland most of the GDP went to investments to civil society and consumption and armed forces only got a token.

Now compare 1938 to 2014... Finland has GDP per capita (nominal) of 49,497USD which is higher than that of 45,653 of United Kingdom, and much higher than that of Russia 12,926 USD which is largely formed from selling of commodities. While Baltic states have modernized heavily in the last 25 years and enjoyed high foreign investments, they are still far behind on what they would have had if they had staid independent and had working market economy... Lets see... Estonia 19,671$, Lithuania 16,386$ and Latvia 15,783$... As Finland could over take United Kingdom, France and Germany in productivity, so too could Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia too reached comparative results.  

The fact of the matter is that democracy with market economy is superior to planned economies, it is a fact. Soviet Union by invading, occupying and annexing Baltic countries to be part of USSR doomed Baltic countries to be poor and undeveloped for the next 60 years. That is a fact. If they could have kept their independence like Finland did, they could have followed their own path and become developed and prosperous.",2015-07-14 09:29:14+00:00,ct2qx3u,5,t1_ct2pt31,4497,worldnews
144,"&gt; 70s were only 30 years away from most devastating war in the history of Russia with huge, over 20 million loss in population. Do you really want to compare this two countries? They were absolutely different by their internal priorities and necessities. Its just different type of scale.

Point was that Baltic states before the the second world war had the same level of development and same level of GDP. Where as Finland stayed independent and democratic market economy after the war, Baltic states were annexed to become part of the Soviet Union and were forced to adopt Communism. Without Soviet annexation Baltic states would have the same level of development and prosperity as Finland does. That was my point.

In case of Soviet Union, after the second world war there were two countries who started from level zero, those were Germany and Soviet Union. West Germany become a powerfull first world economy thanks to integration into west and development of democratic market economy that became the engine of Europe. Communism instead failed miserably only barely matching what west could throw at it. For example the reason why Tshernobyl nuclear accident was so bad is that Soviet Union couldn't build the same number of nuclear reactors as western countries were building with the same safety features, thus Soviets build their nuclear reactors without proper containment buildings. The same happened in manufacturing industries, were as in West factories had to cut pollution, the only way Soviets could even try to imagine keeping up with the west was not do anything with pollution. Communism as an political and economic system utterly failed the country.

&gt; And i was born in USSR, and my family living in Lithuania for the last 300 years. I guess my word against yours. But anyway, 1989 is near end of USSR, Gorbachovs reforms in the economy and their miserable failure created massive shortage in the first need products.

The economy failed first. Reforms that Gorbachovs initiated were the last try to save the economy and the Soviet Union. Actually the Soviet economy should have already failed in the 60s. It was then saved by selling gas and oil to West Germany. The oil and gas revenues allowed the Soviet Union to buy commodities such as wheat from the world markets as it couldn't anymore feed its own population. The increase of oil and gas production and prices in the beginning of 70s fueled the Soviet economy further enabling the Soviet state to engage in big projects from Olympics to war in Afghanistan. However in the same time Soviets failed to invest on searching new oil and gas fields, the fields that they had were depleted faster than new capacity was brought in. This all culminated in 1985 when Soviet oil production was cut down in few years to half of what it was, not to mention that in 80s oil prices decreased because of Saudi-Arabia pumping record numbers of oil. This would not have collapsed Soviet Union if it had been self-sufficient, however it wasn't, it was importing huge number of food to feed its population. When the oil revenues went down, Soviet Union loaned money from the western financial markets until funding dried in 1989. That was the end of the Soviet Union.

[Book to recommend, Collapse of an Empire by Yegor Gaidar](http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Empire-Lessons-Modern-Russia/dp/0815731140)

In case of shortages, Soviets provided first to Moscow and St. Petersburg and other capitals and major cities in Soviet Union to keep up the appearances. However in small cities the shortages were epidemic.

151,"&gt; I see what you did there....Truth Truth Truth then totally unrelated conclusion. Also, you have omitted some vital facts.
&gt; Omitted relevant facts:
&gt; In 2007, Greek pensions were 11.7% of GDP so the issue was not that pensions were too high. The issue was that the ""reforms"" forced onto Greece from the first and second so-called ""bailout"" deals destroyed Greek GDP. The obvious way out of it is not to cut pensions but to restore and grow GDP.

The Greek state and economy was living in a sovereign debt bubble. In the good years of global economy, the Greek state had budget deficit of...

* 2006 - 5.2%
* 2007 - 5.7%
* 2008 - 6.5%
* 2009 - 9.8%
* 2010 - 15.7%

The Greek GDP has ballooned because of this reckless loaning of money. The day of reckoning came when the markets didn't want to anymore give any new loans to the Greek state. Now at this state the Greek state could have defaulted, but even their primary balance was -10.1% of the GDP. If Greece had defaulted then, they wouldn't have had any money to run the state, the situation comes even worse when you take into account that the Greek banks and pension funds had bought Greek bonds. Defaulting in 2009/2010 not only would have halted the Greek state, but also would have destroyed Greek banks and pension funds thus taking the rest of the economy out without their being anybody there to bail them out.

The fact of the matter is that there was a bubble of debt, and now Greek state has to balance it spending according to it. Pensions are not only in too high level compared to other Eurozone countries, they are also in very high level compared to made pension contributions and retirement age of the pensioners.

&gt; This is not true. Pensions are one of the few elements left in Greece actually driving money velocity though the economy. Cutting them would most likely reduce GDP even further, which by your logic would require more and more cuts - a death spiral.

The mistake you make is to only look at this from macro perspective when you really should be looking from micro perspective. Funneling money to pensioners only will make sure that the money goes to consumption. If instead the money would be used to start investments with EU structural funds, then you would generate real stimulus that would direct money to the productive sectors of the society.

In case of your points...

&gt; 1. The way the Euro is set up greatly benefits net exporting countries. 

Euro levels the playing field. In normally functioning market imbalances of trade will cause market reaction that will cause states to decrease their spending and banks to cut down their loaning. All the economies had bubbles that were permitted to be born by local politicians who against all warnings went and made a gamble with their countries long term well being.

&gt; 2. Austerity had pushed down their GDP and made their government budgets seem unsustainable.

Their GDP was totally untenable. What you are essentially saying is that for Greece it was normal to have a primary budget deficit of -10.1% and for Spain it was totally normal to have more construction than the rest of the Europe together. You also got it backwards. Greece and Spain had bubbles, markets burst these bubbles and the economies made return to normality, which to states reacted with austerity measures to stabilize their own functioning to tax revenue that they now gathered.

&gt; IMHO the correct solution to this problem is the introduction of a Europe-wide income transfer mechanism that shares the surplus wealth generated in net export countries with net import countries - the way a single country would handle this. Australia, for example does this through a national GST redistribution deal from net exporting states like WA, Victoria and NSW to SA and Tasmania.

Fiscal union will necessity increase of pooled sovereignty. The way southern countries are ran is inexcusable. If countries want to fiscal transfers, either as direct funds or via increased structural funds, they need to give more of their sovereignty to EU. Not to forget that any transfer of funds is not meant to be a permanent solution, but a solution that will create conditions for receiver countries to reform their economies so that they stop being net benefactors and become net contributors.",2015-07-14 05:22:01+00:00,ct2mgay,5,t1_ct2cijb,18188,worldnews

Another major issue with European unemployment insurance is the huge amount of money the system needs to handle and check. You have to create an IT-system that automatically retrieves data from tax officials, accesses the bank accounts of benefit retriever to make sure that they have actually received wages that they reported, they also make sure that the benefit receiver doesn't any other benefits or transactions that would show having other income. Beside these there would be need to be channels for people report on people who cheat with their benefits, then there would be strong collection and prosecution unit that punishes and retrieves money falsely claimed.

156,"&gt; Yes, that's why the Great Depression is a piece of historical fiction.

Did I say that states can't stimulate economy when needed? I didn't. I made specifically an example of Finland that in good times ran surplus budgets and during the downturn started to run deficit budgets to stimulate the economy. Running deficit budgets is good policy if the state has saved money in good times, and if there are no structural reasons on why the economy couldn't start to grow, however if the state hasn't saved in good times and if there are structural reasons on why the economy can't grow, then austerity and reforms are the correct policy to apply. In the case of Greece, it has run very high deficit budgets for the last decade while not doing any structural reforms at all, thus the cure for Greece is austerity, reforms and running surplus budgets.",2015-07-13 12:13:31+00:00,ct1mgko,9,t1_ct1m4xp,1051,worldnews

When governments run surplus budgets and pay their debts back, the credibility of the country increased and makes the investment environment more stable thus enabling private sector to have bigger confidence to invest. For example Finland ran surplus budgets from 1998 to 2008. In 2000s the budget surplus was over 6.5% of the GDP and in 2008 it again reached over 4.5%. During 1998 and 2008 the Finnish economy has grown enormously, and thanks to previous years of running surplus budgets and paying debt back, Finland could run budget deficit after the 2008 financial crisis. Running surplus budgets are essential for an economy that has just had an crisis, it is the way to recover confidence, and when debts have been paid back, surpluses can be used to lower taxation.",2015-07-13 11:47:07+00:00,ct1lz3u,7,t1_ct1ln6w,1137,worldnews
158,"&gt; Even in an ideal scenario where paying off those loans were possible, that implies 35 more years of harsh austerity and primary budget surpluses that are far beyond anything Greece has ever seen. Given the effects of austerity so far, it amounts to a promise to every working-age Greek that during his entire working life, things will continue to get worse, and worse still. And that's assuming an unrealistically optimistic scenario, which contains the rather bizarre assumption that Greece will be able to achieve a primary budget surplus of over 7% from 2020-30.

First of all, not all debts has to be paid off, that is not the purpose. The purpose is to return Greece to the financial markets where it can get new loans to finance old ones with interests that align with most of the Eurozone. Currently Greece pays around 2.6% of its GDP as interests, that is much lower than for example what Italy or Spain pays. [source](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6e5532c0-a310-11e4-ac1c-00144feab7de.html#axzz3flDZQl8K) With surplus budgets and structural reforms that make the economy grow again, like it did already at the end of 2014, we will see what level of debt restructuring Greece will need. Some like Pissarides have told that the maturities of current loans should be extended to 50 or 60 years. If Greece makes reforms and shows budget surplus, this might very well happen, thus meaning that the value of Greek debt in reality is cut by pushing its maturity.

&gt; Europe has the power to cut down on ECB debt repayments, although that would require overcoming some major legal obstacles.

The problem is that would be a treaty change, and treaty changes take years even if most of the members even agree about the content of the treaty change. Not to mention that cutting down ECB bonds from their face-value to market value or to the value that the ECB bought them from the markets will not solve the Greek debt problem.

&gt; More importantly, however, an explicit promise of debt relief contingent upon successful implementation of reforms would give Greeks the expectation of future improvements in their situation, and would give (relatively) moderate Greek governments something to show to the people in exchange for their suffering. The promise of debt relief creates some light at the end of the tunnel, and that's sorely neededâ€”if five years of Greek suffering without prospects put power Syriza in power, another five years might see Golden Dawn or the communists taking over.

The problem is that what ever the Institutions give in, they  have to keep it, while what ever Greece promises, they don't have to keep it. Why should the Institutions give debt relief when there is no trust that current or the future Greek governments would actually stick with program that their successors agreed. The thing is that if Greeks want the Institutions to give debt relief, they have to first earn the truest of the Institutions. 

&gt; Merely keeping their surplus would not have been enough. The primary budget surplus target for 2015 was 3%, and for 2016 it was a massive 4.5%â€”well beyond anything that could reasonably have been achieved with further large cuts which likely would have sent Greece into recession once more.

Greece has a problem of too high internal consumption, it has a trade deficit and balance of payments deficit, thus the Greek internal consumption must be cut. What will remedy the situation are private investments, but those will not happen without reforms and without the political stability that the Greeks don't just go crazy and elect Communists to power. As I said before, in 2014 the Greek economy already started to grow again. After Syriza was elected that growth trajectory was cut down because of the political instability that Syriza created - nobody wanted to invest, everybody wanted their money out.

&gt; Firstly, a large part of the reason that Greece spends such a large part of its GDP on pensions is the fact that its GDP has collapsed. Secondly, whereas nations like Germany and the Netherlands have relatively balanced welfare programs that focus on various groups, Greece's welfare system is almost entirely focused on pensions, with very few provisions for groups like the unemployed, lacking healthcare provisions, and so on. As a consequence of that, many of the unemployed have to live off their parents' pensions. So if Syriza cut down pensions to a level of GDP similar to that of Finland, thousands of people would literally die in poverty.

The problem is that with current demographic trends, the Greek pension spending will only increase in the coming decades. Pension spending must be cut. There is no other way around it. Another thing to note is that there is a huge structural problem with the Greek welfare system if money is funneled to adults via their parents that in pension. The correct thing would be to cut down pensions and use some of the money saved from those cuts to give further assistance to children, young people and adults in need. Do also remember that if Greece would leave the Euro, pensions would go down anyway as the Greek government would run printing presses to pay of salaries and benefits, and the problem here is that benefits and pensions are usually increased slower than what is the inflation.

&gt; A large part of the reason that Greece is in trouble is that it is in a monetary (but not fiscal) union with far more competitive economies that have been practicing austerity on themselves and thereby strengthening the euro, leaving Greece without good ways to increase its competitiveness.

That is incorrect. Greek export industries don't compete with countries such as Germany, Finland or Netherlands, Greek producers and service providers compete with Italian, Spanish, etc.. competitors. If you look at the Greek private sector, the thing is that it actually functions and fares adequately well. The problem in Greece is not the private sector, the problem in Greece is the public sector that is too large and has spent too much money since the 80s.

159,"&gt; So unless Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, etc. have changed their mind on the acceptability of major debt relief (which seems unlikely), the fundamentals remain unchanged, and a future crisis is all but unavoidable.

Loans given by Eurozone states, both bilateral and ESM loans, have very low interest rates and long maturities, Greece will start to pay them in 2020 and last of the loans will be paid in 2050. The loans that Greece can't payback now are loans to IMF, ECB and private investors. If Eurozone states would cut down loans that they have given to Greece, it would not help at all Greece to pay back the loans that are due now and in the coming years. What the third bailout package does is to reorganize Greek debts so that loans to IMF, ECB, etc.. are paid from the bailout package. The hope is that this time the Greek will make the reforms and make sure their budget stays in surplus. If it doesn't, if it isn't in 2020 in a level where Greece can start to pay back its debts to other Eurozone countries, what will happen is that maturities of those loans are extended again.

In the case of this crisis, this crisis was perfectly avoidable. If Syriza would have continued the second bailout program, then they would have kept their surplus and the second bailout fund would have funded the pay backs of IMF and ECB loans. And if Syriza would have done cuts that are needed to be done, especially then there would have been no crisis. In case of cuts, Greece spends 16.2% of its GDP to pensions while for example Finland spends 12% and Austria, Germany, Netherlands, etc.. spend little over 10%. If Syriza would have cut down pension spending to Finnish level relative to GDP then they wouldn't have needed neither the second bailout or the third bailout program at all. The thing that people forget is that Greece is not some third world state, it is quite wealthy and developed country, the reason why it is in the trouble is because how it internally works and spends its money.",2015-07-13 07:44:41+00:00,ct1idio,3,t1_ct1hx9v,1624,worldnews

162,"What is the alternative to austerity? What is the alternative to financial stifling? Lets make an example out of pensions...

Greece spends 16.2% of its GDP to pensions. Other Eurozone countries such as Finland spends 12%, and countries such as Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia spend more than 10%. [source](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/11/04/02/index.html?itemId=/content/chapter/factbook-2013-89-en). Clearly Greece spends too much to the pensions. If the Greek state would be running normally, as in it would have budget surplus and it could get funding from the markets, then there would  be no problem with pensions, that would be a Greek matter of what their level and funding is. However, as Greece is not in the position to fund itself then...

The options are...

* Get an bailout from other Eurozone countries, accept their demand on cutting pensions and every pensioner gets lets money.
* Return to Drachma, first the new currency is worthless (pensions make a huge drop), then it will gain value, however if the Greek states tax revenues don't match spending, then there will be inflation (pensions will go further down as they are raised slower than Drachma will loose value).

The fact of the matter is that the Greek state has to cut down spending, and it has to cut down spending on places where it looses more money than other comparable states. If Greece would cut its spending of pensions to the Finnish level, then it would annually save around 9,9 billion USD, enough money that Greece wouldn't need an bailout. What you as a Greek should ask is why isn't the Greek state doing these cuttings by itself? Like I pointed out, other countries spend much less on pensions. And cutting pensions doesn't necessarily has to happen from cutting from the smallest pensions, how about you cap the pensions to 1000â‚¬.

I was visiting Rome in the beginning of May. There was a Roma man playing accordion in the entrance of metro station. He had his little girl around 8-10 with her, begging for money from passers by. I felt little sorry for the girl, but then asked myself - why isn't she in the school, schools haven't ended yet. She was there begging money hour after hour. However one time I was going to metro, I saw that another girl changed position with the original girl - they were rotating girls to beg.

One time, just after Romania and Bulgaria had joined the EU. I was walking a street in Helsinki during a day, I was passing a restaurant with people eating in terrace. However all was not well, there was an old Romani Woman, in her 70s or 80s, begging from the people eating out. She refused to leave before they gave her money. That was just one of the examples.

In some countries people have refused to give money to beggars and social welfare officials have been actively taken custody of children begging money during parts of year when they should go to school, this has decreased the number of beggars immensely.

The thing that you have to understand is that these people are not begging because they are Romani, they are begging because they are part of an culture that despises working and living under the rules of an organized society.

The good thing is that we get the same content as /r/europe which is quite good, the problem is like you said that there are too many submissions.

I had few things on my mind on what could be done...

* Try to calculate on what kind of submissions get most upvotes and filter bot made submission based on these
* Try to use text clustering to see if there is a recurring topic like for example Greece and instead of individual submission, group new bot made submission under a self post.

At this moment I think that going to clustering of submission into self posts would be better because it would free space for other topics while allowing developing topics to be updated and concentrating discussion there.",2015-06-29 05:58:36+00:00,csm58wd,2,t1_cslnv1y,36566,besteurope
