22,"If you lose to rogue, play a lot of rogue with a mentality of finding out why you are a losing to it so much.  Paladin's greatest weakness is by far rogue (granted I haven't been playing hearthstone for a couple months so I don't know the current meta very well).  But rogue was my favorite class to play because everyone spams paladin and mage.  Rogue hero power counters paladin hero power and divine shields pretty hard.  Mages have a hard time against rogue too because weapon/buffweapon cards often give more value than spells in the early game (although mages have class minions that give rogue a lot of trouble).  It's hard to beat rogues early game because they use face damage to get the board and have cheap removal so make sure you draft 2/3 2 drops.  I used to draft with the intention on winning the early game and I would average ~7 wins.  But all in all, you are probably losing so much to rogue because you play too much paladin.",2016-08-16 01:26:43+00:00,d6j4bod,3,t1_d6j3140,1931,ArenaHS

90,"I think that's pretty broken.  In arena, rogue hero power is really strong because it is the best hero power (imo) to control the board.  You get 2 damage with 2 mana, with the only downside being that you get hurt every time you attack.  Weapons are already pretty overpowered in terms of how much damage they dish out, taking away the damage to face would be pretty broken.  That's why gladiator's longbow costs 7 mana for 5/2 and is a purple card whereas something like truesilver is a 4 mana 4/2 heal 2.

114,"Here's my take on MDMA.  I started going to raves when I was in high school, which was about 6 years ago.  I was obsessed with ecstasy and my life revolved around EDM.  My closest friends were made as a result from our mutual connections with drugs and EDM.  The best times of my life were these years of raving.  I ended up doing MDMA about twice a month and my pill count got in the triple digits.  It is difficult to progress in life while you are constantly cracked out.  I realized it was time to stop so I told my girlfriend we are going to quit doing drugs.  She couldn't quit and we broke up.  I was left to cope with quitting not only MDMA but also raves by myself.  The overuse of MDMA had noticeable affects on my ability to sleep and maintain emotional stability (MDMA causes your brain to release huge amounts of serotonin which causes the brain to be depleted of it in the long run).  I ended up severely depressed for a long time but I got over it.  Went to college and got my life together.  3 years later girlfriend is still raving and still in the same place in life.

TL;DR MDMA resulted in the best times of my life but also the worst, like most drugs.  Be careful when romanticizing it.      ",2015-08-28 20:36:03+00:00,cuj1jqm,1,t3_3iny38,73555,Drugs
