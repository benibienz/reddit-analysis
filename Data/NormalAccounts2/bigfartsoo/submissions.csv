All the LST guides and pictures I see are of 1-2 week old plants that have really long branches and aren't too bushy.  My plant is the opposite, 4 weeks into veg, short branches and extremely bushy.  I have to dig through leaves to find my branches.  So I tied my main branch down which didn't really bend, more so just tilted sideways in the dirt.  I feel like this is damaging my roots.  I can't pull the other branch in the opposite direction to expose the lower nodes because the branches are too short.  Also, the entire side of the plant that I pulled down is face down in the soil and not being exposed to sunlight, doesn't this just kill the side of your plant?

One more question, how many times do you guys usually top?  I only topped once about 3 weeks in which is pretty late so I didn't get that perfect 4 branch growth like in all the topping guides I see.  Should I top every top growth that pops up?

This is my first grow, thanks for the help.  I have done research but all the resources I find have plants that are not similar to mine.

I was under the assumption that this power supply was DC but I received it and it says AC on it.  I don't know much about electronic stuff but can I still use this adapter?  I think it takes AC input and switches it to DC output.  

I also have a power supply that came with my LED side lighting, can I just connect the side lights and 3 fans to the same power supply?

Here are the fans:
