0,My sales have been going down since last year. I'm not sure what's going on. Maybe Amazon changed their search algorithms without telling anyone or just no ones buying.

If you can't risk having your PL fail then you should definitely stick to RA/OA.

You can apply this method to online arbitrage as well but it could be a bit harder because online prices are already near what amazon has.
