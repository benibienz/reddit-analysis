And now I'm starting to look into getting some entry job some where, the problem is there are so many choices to pick from along with freelancing work that I've found online. 

My favorite language to use currently is Java, mainly JavaFX but there just doesn't seem to be that many JavaFX jobs around here along with freelance work as well. When it comes to desktop application, I assume that C++ with QT is more popular right? But I still see that Java itself still has the most jobs.. 

What part of Java actually has the most jobs here? Is it web development with Java EE? If anyone can point me in the right direction, that would be helpful :) so I can get to studying! ",cscareerquestions,Java jobs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/52k3rf/java_jobs/

They didn't even exist on Amazon so I created a new listing and got hit with the typical ""you need to be approved for this brand"" blah blah and thats fine, I've been through those before but now they're asking me to pay $1,000 AFTER I'm approved. 

Does amazon really believe they can ask resellers for that much money just to resell brand name products? I am not sure what to do from this point but I am pretty concerned now about any RA item I pick up. Am I just better off going back to Ebay to sell these kind of items?
