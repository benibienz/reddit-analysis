Well, the Traveler is mostly powerless, but not entirely. Even as it falls inert, it sends off tiny fragments of itself called Ghosts, with a mission to track down people of great strength, discipline, and intelligence that can be revived and made to protect humanity. 

That’s us!

Yep. That’s the guardians. The Ghosts spread out across Earth and use the transformative power of Light to bring special individuals back to fight the good fight. 

Wait a second, revive? As in, we were dead?

Exactly. 

So we’re like zombies? 

Well, not exactly. Guardians are infused with Light, life, and sentience. But some of our enemies don’t think about it that way. In one grimoire card, a Fallen even refers to us as “dead soldiers.” They think we’re the bad guys

If guardians are the stronger, more intelligent and disciplinary group why did we die, what killed a guardian and what caused all the light to be drawn from the guardian on the dark beyond mission on the moon? If the darkness absorbed all the light from the dead guardian on the moon why didn't it pull it from us (our character)?",DestinyTheGame,Guardian Question,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3icyjp/guardian_question/
