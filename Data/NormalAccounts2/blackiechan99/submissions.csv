**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

I switched out my graphics card from a 270x. the only difference between actually installing it was i had to use the 6+2 connector instead of just 6 pin, but other than that it was fine, when i booted up the LED's turned on and the fans spun on startup. The BIOS window came up(The resolution was screwed up tho) and the windows logo start up screen with the spinning circle came up, but after that it went to a black screen. It just wouldn't go to actual windows. after a lot of troubleshooting, i reinstalled windows and was able to go through to the desktop screen, but the resolution was, at the highest, 800x600 and it did not recognize my monitor and listed it as a Generic non PNP monitor, and my resolution was horrible. I tried to install drivers, but when i restarted my PC it went back to black screen after the windows logo/spinning logo thing. I have no clue what to do.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

I reinstalled my old graphics card after my new one didnt work at first, and the old graphics card worked fine. It may be a problem with my new card, but im not sure. I reinstalled windows just to get a fresh start since im on a PC with barely anything installed, but the resolution was horrible, didnt recognize my monitor, went back to the black screen when i restarted, ect.

Anyway, hello! As the title says, i am thinking about getting back together with my ex gf. We dated a little while my freshman/sophomore year (if that even really counts) and broke up because a past boyfriend of hers came over to her house to hang out, and he ended up kissing her, and she kissed him back. She was open with me about it and told me straight up. I told her no hard feelings, but we werent going to be a thing anymore. Anyways, fast forward through all that freshman BS to this year. 

We have been talking a lot this past year (we see each other almost every day in marching band) We have both matured in many ways. We have talked out our differences in the relationship because she felt AWFUL and never forgave herself for giving me up in the way she did. Anyways, we hung out on band contest days and have spent a reasonable amount of time with each other, and eventually we both told each other recently that we still have strong feelings for each other. I have heard mixed things from dating an ex, so does anyone have insight on dating an ex you can share with a fellow homie? Thanks in advance
