I have at other races, and it really comes down to training properly, and managing pain during races. I rank myself in the same tier u/fabianruns does. We are both high level-tier 3 elites. We need to podium with more frequency at other races, and finally get on a Spartan one to jump up to tier 2. (Classification system put fourth by Brakken Kraker).

1. I've had first place finishes in state/local OCR events. Lately those have been getting difficult because Texas is producing some good competition in this past year. Quite a few people have gotten serious about it. 

2. Most difficult race would be the 2013 Killington Ultra Beast, or Joe Deckers' ""The SUCK"". 

3. You've all seen workouts I post on here. Crap-tons of running, and strength lifts mixed in. I don't do any obstacle specific training other than a spear throw. That's the only way to keep skilled at it. Otherwise, I just make sure my fitness and grip is where it needs to be.

4. Fix your running form ASAP.

You have a solid sprint pace. To test Super and Beast, run for an hour and see what  your pace is able to stay with there. I never go for distance in training runs, it's always just maintaining pace over time. If you're able to even hold in the low 7's for an hour, you're in good shape.

How to test. Download an interval timer on your phone. Set one interval for 3 min, the second for 10 seconds. Repeat it 20 times. Run for 3 min, then drop and do three burpees as fast as possible. If you're done before the ten seconds, start running anyway. The point of this is to test yourself to get back into your running pace after hammering out a full body movement.

Really focus on jump form. Make sure you are driving forward with your hips while jumping, so you aren't losing any power by trapping it in your body if you are bending over forwards during the jump. ",2016-07-13 13:12:11+00:00,d5aisbd,1.0,t3_4sknf7,40916.0,spartanrace

I'll go price ranges here.

In the $200-$250 price range IMO the best is the TomTom Spark Cardio + Music

Pedometer, sleep tracker, heart rate on wrist (compatable with a TomTom heart strap if you want better results), Works with a biking power pod, slips out of the wrist strap really easily and you can buy other colors if you want. The GPS is accurate, the app works really well. It will connect view bluetooth to your phone, and has 4GB of music on it so you can just take some BT headphones on your workouts and no need to have your phone on you anymore. From just daily wear and go, I charge it once every week or more. When using GPS for runs during the week, once every few days. i'm sure more often if I get BT headphones and play music from it. Solid buy I can totally recommend to anyone.

$300-400 Suunto Ambit 2/3 Series - Garmin Fenix 2/3 Toss up between Suunto and Garmin. I personally prefer Suunto. They have a steeper learning curve, but seem to have a better track record of accuracy with GPS and their syncing app. Garmin does have more in the way of special features and social media things. Suunto is very tuned to track all of your vitals and get better as an athlete. The design of the site is utilitarian, but easily usable. Garmin is more user friendly, but the bugs kept me away. 

$450+ Same manufacturers, but here you will get the Sapphire version of the Ambit 2 series, or go for $600-ish to get the brand new Sapphire versions from either Suunto or Garmin. i have the Ambit 2 Sapphire, and this thing a a freaking BEAST. Worn it through a few Ultra Beasts, The SUCK and MANY other obstacle races. it's also my daily training watch. Plus, when you set GPS pings and data recording all the way down to 1 second for both, it still gets 16 hours out of a full charge. The Fenix 3 is also a beast of a watch, I just hear of a lot of software bugs. Not sure if those have been patched out though. Anyone with one, feel free to chime in and let me know about that.

The reason for this, your body goes into overdrive the first day producing red blood cells like mad. After that you body has to take a break and then you get into your actual acclimation period of about a month. So, going up days before, bad idea. I learned that the hard way in Tahoe.

As for training, I'd say first find your strengths and areas of improvement. Once you have those identified, we can get a better ides of what you would want to spend some extra time on. As for the distance. Twice a week, find some good hilly trails and go for a 45min - 1.5hr runs. Keep it at about 70% intensity. It's not an easy jog, but you can still turn it up if you need too, comfortably hard pace. Also known as ""Lydiard Pace"". Much easier to find if you have some kind of heart rate monitor.

I've been a fan of the Watermelon and Blueberry Pomegranate from them for the gummies. Gu also makes two kinds of energy gels. One is just branded as Gu, the other is called Roctane.

211,"I'll go price ranges here.

In the $200-$250 price range IMO the best is the TomTom Spark Cardio + Music

Pedometer, sleep tracker, heart rate on wrist (compatable with a TomTom heart strap if you want better results), Works with a biking power pod, slips out of the wrist strap really easily and you can buy other colors if you want. The GPS is accurate, the app works really well. It will connect view bluetooth to your phone, and has 4GB of music on it so you can just take some BT headphones on your workouts and no need to have your phone on you anymore. From just daily wear and go, I charge it once every week or more. When using GPS for runs during the week, once every few days. i'm sure more often if I get BT headphones and play music from it. Solid buy I can totally recommend to anyone.

$300-400 Suunto Ambit 2/3 Series - Garmin Fenix 2/3
Toss up between Suunto and Garmin. I personally prefer Suunto. They have a steeper learning curve, but seem to have a better track record of accuracy with GPS and their syncing app. Garmin does have more in the way of special features and social media things. Suunto is very tuned to track all of your vitals and get better as an athlete. The design of the site is utilitarian, but easily usable. Garmin is more user friendly, but the bugs kept me away. 

$450+ Same manufacturers, but here you will get the Sapphire version of the Ambit 2 series, or go for $600-ish to get the brand new Sapphire versions from either Suunto or Garmin. i have the Ambit 2 Sapphire, and this thing a a freaking BEAST. Worn it through a few Ultra Beasts, The SUCK and MANY other obstacle races. it's also my daily training watch. Plus, when you set GPS pings and data recording all the way down to 1 second for both, it still gets 16 hours out of a full charge. The Fenix 3 is also a beast of a watch, I just hear of a lot of software bugs. Not sure if those have been patched out though.

There is no way to train for altitude unless you are either in it, or you find a sports clinic that has a hypoxic respirator. That's it.

So, last year, most of my finishes where I was in good form and not injured, I was top 10 and top 5. I was rankled 38th Male in the US and 67th in the world, and I'm still not a full ""don't need to worry about it"" Cat 1. 

Elite heats have gotten huge, this Category system is going to be limiting the sizes of the elite heats down to about 100 people or so. Think the heat sizes at OCRWC, about that big. Competitive will be  larger because that's going to be filled with a lot of people in the hunt. NBC will have even smaller Elite heats. I'm thinking like 50 - 75 per, and those are all going to be people where none of the elite females will chick. 

Remember, points are NOT based on placement, but time behind first place. 

For standard races:

First place Total seconds/Your time Total Seconds * 300 * 1 for a beast, .98 for a Super or .96 for a sprint.

Example: You are an elite male, you finished the sprint race in 1:02:32. The first place male finished in 59:53.

280,"Here's some additional info regarding the competitive heats. The classification I'm giving below is the same classification for Triathlons, marathons and such you have been watching on TV since the 80's. 

The first one is going to be in Vegas (or Arizona, if you care about geography). Right now, it's for those who want to run in a highly competitive wave, but aren't in the full elite bracket. Next year, it's going to come into play. From some insider info I have, it's going to be broken down like this. 

There will be Category 1, 2 and 3 athletes.

Category 3 is anyone wanting to enter a competitive wave. This is everyone. If you have a high enough point value in competitive, it will promote you to Category 2.

Category 2 is eligible to enter elite heats in almost every race. You still must maintain a high enough point value to keep your Cat 2 ranking. If you have a high enough point value here, you are rated for Category 1.

Category 1 means you are eligible for elite entry in EVERY race, including NBC races. The reason for this is you have the Elite Men go off, then you have Amelia, Rose, K.K., etc... passing 250+ men, it's not a good look for TV. When you have Those women coming up, and right next to them is a nonathletic guy next to them on the herc hoist wearing a Def Leopard t-shirt, it's not making the cut to TV.

290,"**Battlefrog** Elite is going to give you the distance of a long super, but double the obstacles. It's two laps of an 8k course with usually about 35 obstacles, and if you want to keep your band, obstacle completion is required. So I would rank a BF Elite above that of a Spartan Super and even beast because of the sheer amount of obstacles you must complete. 

**BF Open** is one lap, about 30 obstacles, so on par with a usual Spartan Sprint. 

**Savage Race** - I love Savage. These people put on great events. Their start line amp up is IMO, the best in the business. They have top notch obstacle construction and their stance varies from 4.5-7.5 miles. Usually about 20-ish obstacles from the ones I've been in. This is a fun event, and it can be really fast depending who you are racing against. Plus, it's another band based obstacle completion race for the competitive wave.

**Warrior Dash**, is going to be easier than a Sprint, and hang their. it's a good opener. 

**Terrain Race** is a more out there, but creative OCR. I still rank it in the Sprint category, but their monkey bars are no joke. 

**Conquer The Gauntlet** is new smaller race series that has a great core behind it. They are the new Savage race. Innovative obstacles that provide a fresh challenge, and a great grassroots structure. I can't wait to run the event in Dallas this May. 

I put **The SUCK, BFX, BFX24 and WTM** in the same bucket. They are 12-24-36 hour endurance events. They focus on how much you can complete in the time limit. BFX24 has not happened yet, but it's looking to be rather interesting. WTM takes the crown still as the most difficult 24-hour race. In the 12 and 36 hour races, I give it up to The SUCK. It's not so much an OCR as it is an insane test of intense physical brutality that is put on by some of the coolest and most motivating people around. It's pure hell, and you're going to come back for more every year. 

The **Spartan Ultra Beast** is also in it's own category. It's a marathon plus distance with usually 90-100+ obstacles in a race. That's not the hard part. The hard part is that they are typically done through crazy mountain ranges. Your nemesis won't necessarily be the obstacles, it's going to be the terrain, hunger and exposure. This race has an average of a 17% completion. To put it in better perspective, most of the competitors in this race train literally, for an entire year for this one race, and 83% of them fail it every year. (Least years Hawaii not included) I'm really only counting the Ultra Beast the day after the Championship, because that's the big dog. 

Finally **OCR World Championships** this is, hands down, my favorite race. They bring the pain in every way. This past year I think it was 60+ obstacles in a 9 mile course, not including the natural obstacles they utilized through the trails. It's the defacto Obstacle Completion event. They really utilized the venue to it's greatest potential this past year. Then the next day for the Team Championship, they brought a brand new formula, and it was freaking amazing. 

So, there's no formal Ranking, but hopefully that puts some things into perspective. ",2016-02-17 17:22:23+00:00,d03dz06,1.0,t3_448iwe,1093789.0,ObstacleCourseRacing

307,"I have been summoned!  /u/dpkimsecks

Well, you have 14 weeks. That's actually quite good to get basic conditioning in place. You aren't going to be able to run the entire thing, but if you train hard, you can do it, and still feel pretty damn good. 

First, you do need to get your cardio in order. I saw /u/Ridgeback111 mention pose running. While this is something great to look in to, at this moment I would wager a good pair of running shoes for now. Go to a good athletic store where they can hopefully measure your pressure points, and have them watch you run. This way you can get shoes that will accommodate your current style. Here is a video I made on what to look for when choosing your shoe for the race. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp7foXfLgdk

Being a former athlete, you're going to get the muscle memory back from your athletic days in terms of your running form. Once you get a good base built up, running form can come next. Don't put it off for long, but I'd say in this 14-week span, you can focus on it after. 

With how you're beginning, do NOT focus on distance. I don't care how fast you can run a mile or three, you're focus needs to be on time and heart rate. Your distance is not a major concern until you start to want to really compete. At first you're going to do runs at what's called a Lydiard pace. Thing of it as Comfortably Hard. You're not doing an easy jog, but you can turn it up if you need to. This should get you to about 70%-75% heart rate. See how long you can go at this pace. 

I know what you're saying, I also hate just basic running. That's where yo need to start. You want to have three days of good cardio, and three days of warmup cardio with functional weight exercises followed by cooldown cardio. Here are a couple of my workouts as an example:

 &gt; 30min at high end Lydiard pace, sandbell bent rows x 30, sandbell box squat x 30, sandbell russian twist x 30, repeat all x 20 &amp; 10.  Finish w/10min high end Lydiard pace (start this run immediately after completing exercises and try to settle in to a comfortable pace asap.

 &gt; 30% incline x 1000' climb, pull-ups x max reps, burpees x 30 for time, pull-ups for max reps, continue repeating for 3 additional rounds.

Scale something like this back to where you are. For where you are starting, I'd cut everything in half and not do a high end pace. Don't do anything for time yet either. Just keep things constantly moving.  The reason for workouts like this is, I don't care how strong you are or get. The question is, how long can you maintain? In a Beast, Strength Endurance is what you go for. So what if you can lift the Atlas Ball at Mile 2, can you do it at Mile 13?

Food-wise, it's really just, clean proteins, carbs and fats. Don't go overboard on one of the three for more than a meal or two in a week. The three days before the race, that's when you want to carb up. 

If you have any other questions, ask away or shoot me a PM. ",2016-01-22 00:08:38+00:00,cz75zxa,1.0,t3_420bk4,32788.0,spartanrace

316,"Hey, glad anything I post could be of help. From your sign up, I'm guessing you did the regional pass and are going for the gusto on year one. Great goal, my friend! 

As for lifting, I rarely do any weight lifting. The most I do with weights are with my 50-60lb sandbells/wreckbag. Occasionally I do have a workout where I use a 65-70lb bar for thrusters in between running segments, but it's pretty much all body-weight with only slight augmentations. 

The thing to keep in mind with this sport is you do need some additional strength training for obstacles like the Herc Host, Atlas Carry and plate drag, but you don't need or want to go into excess. You need to have the right amount of strength, but more importantly, Strength Endurance. It doesn't matter if you can bench press a Buick, how long can you do it for? Can you pull a plate in the slogging mud while sitting on your ass after 10 miles and 27 obstacles already? That's what you want to focus on. With 14 weeks, you have plenty of time. Get your grind on, work hard and listen to your body. Know when you are comfortable, working hard and overdoing it. Working hard and overdoing it seem to overlap a lot. When I'm in a workout, I can tell you I'll feel like I'm dying for about 20 minutes. After that, at the same output, my heart rate will stabilize as will my breathing and it's smooth sailing.

As for your races coming up, I'll see you in Austin! I'm running both that weekend. For Breckenridge, don't worry about the altitude. If you're not going super competitive, slow your pace. Understand at elevation you are going to be going drastically slower. I recommend racing within 24 hours of arriving there. You body kinds of goes into a OH SHIT mode and produces a lot of red blood cells within the first day. Then it tapers off and slowly builds more through the next 3-5 weeks of being at altitude. So you're much better off racing immediately getting to that altitude than going there a few days in advance. 

Kick ass on your training. If you ever have a question or concern, feel free to PM me and I'll gladly help out however I can. ",2016-01-06 16:55:19+00:00,cyo6n6t,2.0,t1_cyns4gk,37852.0,spartanrace

335,"First off, from the 2104-2015 season, they increased the number of races in the US by 40%. That’s a huge increase.

Venues: Venues across the US have been increasing their prices year over year. Our sport is the fastest growing in the country, and venues know this. The cost for the vast majority have gone up year after year. Venues are not cheap. Venues that can host Supers are even more expensive. Then the ones large enough for beasts… super expensive. That’s why there were so many Trifecta Weekends and Beast/Sprint weekends. Spartan loses money most times there is a double beast at a location. So they have a beast and a Sprint for most everyone else, otherwise they lose money because not enough people run beasts.

Materials: While some obstacles are trucked in (which is its own huge cost), most obstacles are all built from locally sourced items. Think sand, gravel, dirt, lumber, bolts, riggings… etc. The list goes on. Now have enough stuff and enough STURDY stuff that you can have 5000-15,000 people in a weekend run up, over and through everything. That’s some serious coin. The kind of things you need to withstand that kind of stress is expensive, and a lot of it has to be bought at every venue, every time. 

The Uber Racers: What do I mean by that? I mean all of us that got annual passes in the first place so we could run as many races as we want. I personally run at least 18 Spartans a year. Most season pass holders run at least nine. While many argue this is the whole point of the pass, (which I agree with), that doesn’t mean that the cost shouldn’t reflect the value of it. If you owned a business, and people bought an unlimited pass for something, and they consumed so much you lost money, you would also increase the price of that pass to at least try to break even on them. That’s just basic economics. 

OMG THE INSURANCE FEE!!! Well, that never went away, and it’s not going away. It’s a fee paid to a third party, not to Spartan. As our sport grows, insurance costs will increase. More runners = more chances of catastrophic injuries happening where that insurance would be needed. So, if you want the sport to grow and get more people, understand there is a cost to you for that as well. 

OCR is something we are all passionate about, this is why the reactions like this come out with so much polarization, and in some cases, vitriol. It’s important to remember that while Spartan is a race series many of us love, it’s still a business. Businesses need to make money in order to expand. They can’t get bigger and better if they are losing money. If you can’t or won’t do the cost of the annual pass, volunteer your time to help build a course, or be there on race day to do something. That will help with their costs, which give you free races anyway.

Some weeks get really heavy with combined lifts and running, others are a lot more running. The thing you need to train for is strength endurance. Be able to have a consistent pace of intensity when running, and be able to do the obstacles at that same level, then get straight back to your running pace. 

* Yesterday: Fartlek: 48min Lydiard pace run (strong but comfortable).  Every 3min I want you to sprint for 8-10sec but make sure you do not exceed 10sec.

The solo elite didn't go off until 9:15am because of the dangerous water crossings (ran a 1:54.55 for anyone wondering). I was taking to Norm after the race and not only were he and a few other 6-7 foot staff members swept away by the currents in the morning, they even lost a gator ATV (pulled it out with a truck, but still).

So yeah, I was in the front of the pack and the virgin course mud was pretty crazy. I could only dream what it was like for the later waves. Then... Day two happened.

The full 14 mile course. We actually went off at 7:30. The mud was unreal. That ultra sticky, thick, tacky mud. I had around there pins of mud on my feet damn near the entire race. The atlas stone was miserable. The mud was not only caked on it, but it was pulling a vacuum on the stone. So I had to roll it directly on my arm, then dig the other one in next to it to even get it out of that suction pit from hell.

About a mile later, I did something to my right Achilles tendon. Reduced to a limping run or wall the entire race from then on. 

Later again in the race, the mud reared it's head again at the eight foot wall. A couple of my race veteran buddies were there, unable to jump up it. I tried a couple times, and the mud was so thick, it couldn't be done. Someone balanced to notice a rock on the second from the right side. Two guys in front of me tried and failed, I have it a go a barely got my fingers over the other side of the wall. Never had to fight so hard on one of the easier obstacles ever.

383,"Sure thing! It's hard to describe the physical act of an abstract concept... I'll do the best I can. 

Running and running uphill are both related to propulsion. Your stride is out and you are using your legs to push/pull you forward/up. Running downhill, that is now completely reversed. The majority of energy for most people is now being used to push back and slow themselves down. This can give you a greater degree of control in some conditions, but it puts an immense amount of stress on your knees and joints. 

Falling on your feet is a way of running downhill where all you are doing is following your momentum with your feet. You're doing no acceleration, and minimal (if any) braking. If the path is turning left, but your body is taking you wide right on that turn, do it. Don't try to cut it and make it a tighter turn. You're wasting energy and putting extra stress on your knees. 

The best way to try it is find a hill, stand there. Then just start to lean forward, until you need to put a foot out in front to not fall on your face. That's the start of your ""fall"". Continue that posture, specifically, that angle where you actually started to fall forward. It forces you to keep your legs going out, but since you are forward and not back, you won't be braking. You are literally falling down the hill, with your feet beneath you. I'm actually going to be filming that with some others here in the next couple of weeks to demonstrate it.

384,"As someone already stated, get it checked out. 

As for why, I'm betting it is from downhill impact. If you're running downhill and braking, you put a lot of impact on your knees with energy step. You're essentially halting acceleration, and the front of your knee takes the brunt of it every time.

How to avoid this is modify your downhill running. Rather than run downhill, you're going to be falling on your feet. Essentially, your legs and feet only help guide your momentum, rather than give you any acceleration or deceleration unless you REALLY need to slow down or stop. 

Anytime you are coming from a large drop, like off a wall or something, ride your weight down. If you just land on your feet and stay upright, that's hell on your knees. Ride that impact down bend your legs to a low squat while resisting, and bend forward some. On huge drops I'll sometimes end up in a full squat and slapping the ground, or just rolling to redirect my impact momentum. ",2015-10-29 19:20:38+00:00,cwhhx1i,1.0,t3_3qqa4l,6251.0,spartanrace

389,"You are going to want to train speed, endurance and strength endurance. 

For this, I'll recommend hybrid training. Meaning, you are going to do your lifts in between running sets. 

Alternate days where you do tempo runs (85%-90% heart rate) and Lydiard runs (70%-80% heart rate). Think of Lydiard as ""comfortably hard"" pace. You aren't taking it easy, but you can still turn it up if you need to. Some days, you're just going to do just a lydiard run for an hour. Try to keep a good pace where you can just keep going, at 75%-ish heart rate. 

Other days, you are going to combine those with lifts or bodyweight exercises. Here is an example of one of my workout sessions.

1. 90min trail run: Lydiard x 20min, tempo x 10min, lydiard x 20min, tempo x 10min, lydiard x 20min, tempo x 10min.   At each pace transition, complete the following: burpees x 10, push-ups x 10, split squats jumps x 20
1. Immediately transition to: pull-up x 1, 10sec hang, continue until forced to drop, burpees x 10, repeat pull-up hang until forced to drop, burpees x 9, continue repeating but drop burpees down to 8/7/6/5/4/3/2/1 for remaining sets

The point here is training yourself to be running for long distances, then tackle an obstacle with force, but then get right back into your running pace. Really learning how to control your heart rate and body output. ",2015-10-28 21:30:41+00:00,cwgdy7f,1.0,t3_3q9xc5,203079.0,spartanrace

The weather well either be cold, or eff your life cold. Two years ago snow was on the ground and ice covered every obstacle both days and we had a 23mph wind all day Saturday.

If it is stupid cold and windy, be careful what you wear. If you wear layers, or long parts/shirt, those wet clothes and wind can be your downfall. I recommend compression shorts and a thin long sleeve compression shirt. It's the best compromise of wind protection and not freezing your ass off from the water.

Norm is coming to design this course, but it is also done by committee. So, expect it to be 13 miles or longer, with about 28+ obstacles. Very likely two bucket brigades, plate drag, sandbag.

1. Grab far out at start
1. Lean back and get a good swing forward. Tuck those legs to your core.
1. Single hand grab your next grip.
1. With your back hand, still on your original grip, pull yourself BACK on the return swing.
1. Release, and grab ahead.

Best Buy used to have a CTO (Configure to Order) program. It was done away with because of the complexity involved with the process. The complexity being:

Part Selection and getting it to the vendor. Often when you have a CTO computer, it can take up to 2-3 weeks to have a vendor make the computer and have it sent out. Then if the computer is defective, we have to send it back and then it takes another week or so. It's a pretty shitty process.

Then you have to worry about returns. If it's returned, how do you price it and ring it up? Every single custom item on there was it's on individual SKU. Which SUCKED. Also, it would not qualify for any package because it was a custom computer. So you can't even bundle it with anything. 

That's why it isn't done anymore. It's a cumbersome process that takes forever and customers today don't care. They want a simple computer that fits their needs. Those of us that want to build our own computers, use Amazon and New Egg. ",2015-07-27 17:36:58+00:00,cthz0pl,4.0,t1_cthmpvc,23634.0,IAmA

523,"The night before, get to bed around 7pm or so. Depending on your body-weight, take 1-2 liquid cups of Zzzquil (or the pharmacy generic). I do this every night before a race since I always have to be at the venue by 6am anyway. (Note, I'm about 5'9"", 158-165, 11-12% body fat depending on the race, and I always take two cups.) Just be sure to take them an 45-min to an hour before bed, as they can take some time to kick in.

This should give you plenty of time to eat a good carb filled breakfast. Pancakes or something like that. While you are volunteering, do your best to be shaded from the heat. Have a hat on that covers your head face and neck in shade. Drink plenty of water, and have electrolytes on hand. I like Salt Stick capsules, or Gu Brew tablets to mix in your water. 

Protein bars are good, but I'd also recommend things to keep your glucose up. Think honey granola or Kind honey mix. High in carbs, good sugar content. That should keep you fueled through your morning shift and ready to take on the race later in the day. ",2015-07-13 21:14:50+00:00,ct25uqu,1.0,t3_3d62o9,2801.0,spartanrace

There are also WAY MORE lugs to spread your weight out. Again, they will wear faster because of pavement, and these are also minimalist shoes.

Really, don't get trail shoes and run on pavement. Get trail shoes, then go run on trails. Tray and get as many of those miles in your plan on trails. Trust me, it will help immensely.

I remember when David kids were all small guys, then by the time they were effing 12 they towered over me.

Steve Austin, just a cool ass dude. 

Shawn Michaels went to the same church as a boss of mine at the time, so I was chosen to sell them a laptop for their son. Ended up buying a $300 celeron based machine.

546,"It's a choice of management. When I was there, I was a DCI (Head of Geek Squad, Sleeper Agent 1943). I'm an enthusiast and I hired a mix of people. I also came from sales to Geek Squad initially. I just happened to have an enthusiast and engineering background before heading over int he first place. I made sure to have a couple crazy hardware guys, some software gurus, and others you'd never think. I had car audio, camera/imaging, and appliance specialists as well. Only a couple of the guys I hired were the typical, small personality/big intellect kind (not saying you are, just going with what our field is typically known for). 

The majority, I need people who are capable of communicating complicated concepts, to lay, and obstinate people. I had no problem bringing a couple sales minded people over, so long as they WANTED to learn about how to properly troubleshoot and diagnose tech. I can teach that to anyone. I can't teach personality.

At the end of the day, I had a 0% turnover for over three years (which I got in trouble for btw), the lowest NFF (No Fault Found) because I had enough varied talent to text everything before sending out, the highest sales and highest customer satisfaction in the territory. 

The thing my management knew (because I drilled it in to their skulls) is I can't have just sales people back there. I need capable people. It's way more than just the initial sale with Geek Squad. We built relationships with our customers. They would come over to Geek Squad to say Hi even if they came in to just buy a movie or something. That relationship can only be built by DELIVERING on the services our person sold to them. That's it. If more BBY Managers understood this concept, maybe Geek Squad would have an awesome name in the industry again. ",2015-06-23 14:39:14+00:00,csfx40r,5.0,t1_csfswb0,9049.0,GameDeals
