Salomon S-Lab 12 hydration vest

2x 70oz Camelback bladders (One pre-mixed that will stay in my drop bin overnight for lap 2)

2 boxes of Gu Energy gummies

Box of Gu Roctane gels (this way I have plenty of food for lap 1 and 2. I eat at least every 40 minutes)

Bottle of Gu Roctane drink power (not for my drop bin, just to mix into my hydration bladders at the hotel for prep)

Beet Elite packets (For lap 1 and drop bin lap 2)

Two pairs of X-Talon 200 shoes (one for lap 2)

Multiple pairs of socks, shirts and bandages if needed for blisters. Change into mostly dry clothes at the drop bin. just leaving on the shorts, because... decency. 

Emergency blanket in my hydration pack

Non breathing rain jacket (keep warm with the wind and rain. it's gonna suck even worse up there this year)

Waterproof steel pill holders for my Salt Stick tablets to keep from cramping

Wearing Athletics 8 compression shorts, and a thin, heat gear Under Armor long sleeve compression top.

And my Ambit3 Peak Sapphire to keep track of everything.


That's about all I can remember here at the office. Other things in my drop bin are going to be a can of easy open, instant campbells chicken noodle soup. 1500mg of sodium and it digests easily. Honey packets to restore glucose levels for brain function. A trash bag to put my wet shit into when I change shirts shoes and stuff. High calorie snacks that don't have too much sugar.

For some reason Computers inside my network all show ""No Internet connection"" on their network icon. This is not a big deal normally, but we moved to Office 365, and the Office Online capabilities base their connection status on whether or not the OS gets a ping back from Microsoft. After much investigating through packet caps on every port and device, it looks like we narrowed it down to the hard-line adapters not sending out request pings to MS. 

When I connect via outiide WiFi the network card sends 443 traffic to: 131.553.61.98, and 204.79.197.213. They both get ""Client Hello"" responses and then it shows that there is an active internet connection, and Office online/365 applications all work just fine. I also did a Traceroute from the ASA to those IPs and all went fine.

When I drop back to Hard line, NO pings to MS go out, at all. We even NATed my machine to a static IP, and my own outside IP, completely bypassing my web content filter, DNS and main gateway. Still, no outbound search pings to check for being online. 

So I started a new Wireshark capture and did a switch user to leave the cap running. When I logged on, I gave it a few moments, and it said ""No Internet"" again. Popped back over, and I saw Traffic going to 204.79.197.200. Same subnet grouping as the previous, and it checks out. However, it's packet behavior is different. Any idea what could be causing the No Internet only on connections behind my ASA?

The left is the WiFi connection that shows there is internet access, the right is hard line with nothing, going to the same MS subnet with the strange packet traffic.](http://i.imgur.com/B7T6dVx.png)",sysadmin,"Computers behind ASA show ""No Internet"".

Because of the Spartan Team Show, I scored an TomTom Spark Cardio + Music. I honestly really enjoy this watch. it's turned into my daily driver, but how does it compare to a MUCH more expensive and hardened watch?

Enter, my Suunto Ambit 2 Sapphire. I've had it for a couple years now, and it's been my go to for every race. I typically always ditch my TomTom for training because, I like the extreme granular data from the Suunto much more. The real question is... which is more accurate?

I took both on a light run last night (one on each wrist) and here is the data.

Suunto

TomTom

https://mysports.tomtom.com/app/activity/50909900/

https://www.strava.com/activities/567305090

So the strange thing is, they are all off. The Suunto movescount app showing the furthest distance and Strava barely behind it within a good margin of error. 

TomTom, wut happened? Not only was it off by almot 3/10 of a mile, but Strava even showed it being lower by another 0.15mi. That's both huge and strange. How could Strava, give a different distance on the same route at the same time?

Puzzled to say the least. 

Granted, I don't know the GPS ping time on the TomTom and it can't be adjusted. I was using 1 second pings on my Suunto for the best accuracy (I always do). So, I'm guessing the TomTom at 5-10 second pings just cut off a crap tome of cul-de-sacs and turns in the neighborhood I was running.

The day has finally come that I'm able to move out of an apartment and into a house. I'm having a new home built, so life is awesome right now. I just need some advice setting up my new media room because I have an existing setup and some additional in ceiling speakers that I was to setup for Dolby Atmos. I know I'm going to need a new receiver, here is what I have currently.

* Denon AVR 2807 (I know, It's old)
* Speakers are all Definitive Tech.
* 2xBP 2006 Towers
* CLR2002 Center channel 
* Supercube 2 Subwoofer
* 4xBP2X Surround wall speakers

I also have five Yamaha in ceiling home theater grade speakers I got from work, I just don't know the model of them off the top of my head. We upgraded our conference room to Speakercraft, and they let me take the old Pioneer receiver and speakers since there was no use for them anymore. 

The room I'm putting it in is about 13'x13'. I'm guessing that might be small for a 7.2.4, but I'd like to give it a try. If this is too small, and I need to step it down to a 5.2.4 or 7.2.2, I'd gladly like to hear why that might be a better solution.

From my research, I can only find two receivers that actually have 11 channel discrete amps in them. They are the Integra 70.6 and Onkyo TX-NR3030. Looking at their wiring in the rear from their websites, they look to be identical receivers. I'm thinking just a different facade on them. 

Does anyone have any experience with these brands? I've always been a Denon fan, but they don't have anything where I wouldn't have to buy a separate 2-channel amp. 

For video, I currently still have my Panasonic Plasma still going strong, and I love it to death. It's one of the models from Magnoila Home Theater in Best Buy, so it's very much one of the better panels, because black level. I'm going to run a projector upstairs once I can get it, but is waiting for a projector that is Dolby Vision certified worth it? I know it's going to be a more vivid picture because they actually specify the nits for every individual pixel, but how much difference will that really make on a 97-110"" screen that I'm about 12 feet from?",hometheater,Building a new house - building a media room in the upstairs loft.

I have a DL380 G7, and it will not take Server 2012 R2, I have tried so many things.

First, I downloaded the SmartStart service pack DVD that updated all of the Server ROMS and Firmware for all devices to the P67 ROM family, as stated in the HP guide.

From there, I created newRAID arrays in the controller and popped in the Server 2012 R2 disc. Once I boot up the Por-OS and try to install, I got this: 
&gt; ""We couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one. For more information, see the Setup log files.""

So I looked it up, and I needed to load the RAID drivers manually. So I rebooted, killed the arrays, made new ones, got the drivers for the RAID controller on a flash drive, loaded it up. Did the maual install and had it find the drivers for the controller on the flash drive, then it started the install. And it dies.

It dies by going from 0-100% immediately on Copying Windows Setup Files. So, it can't find anything, errors out, and I start the process all over again.

I come to you from my normal hovel of /r/SpartanRace, and MudRunGuide.com to ask you all some questions. I assume most, if not all, of you follow ANW and the contestants. I'm down in San Antonio Texas, and I'm starting a training series for every aspect of obstacle course racing, this includes ANW. As for the contestants I mentioned a second ago, I train and help coach at Power Park Fitness when available, with David and Vance Yarter (The father son duo that made the Houston finals, and David getting to Vegas). 

They have a 3,500 sq/ft training facility for ANW, and I'm wanting to know, what would be important for you all? What do you want to see. Are there specific obstacles you would want covered in terms of how to clear them, or specific training for parts of the course? How to train if you have an injury? Whatever ideas you have, or questions you want answered, I want to know! People always want to know, so I want to answer all the questions you all have, in video form, WITH established ANW competitors. I have five episodes already in the bag and I'm editing them together. 

I want to give ANW an equal focus to that of Spartan/Tough Mudder/Battlefrog... etc. These videos will all be posted on MudRunGuide.com, for free as well. Please, comment here, pm me or email me at   matt@mudrunguide.com with anything that's on your mind!",ANW,ANW/OCR Training Series,http://www.reddit.com/r/ANW/comments/3i81vm/anwocr_training_series/

I come here from my main haunt at /r/SpartanRace to ask you all some questions and such. I'm the new Crew Chief at MudRunGuide.com. I'm the guy you'd come to if you ever felt like writing articles about race/event recaps, or Op/Ed pieces on the sport. So first off, if you have any ideas about our sport as a whole, and you'd like to write about them, send me a PM and we can talk. 

On to the title of this post, I have started filming and creating an OCR specific video series. I'm covering specific obstacle tutorials, gear information, how to travel to races, beginner, intermediate and advanced techniques... Etc. Essentially, I'm trying to make a one stop shop for anyone who is new or wanting to improve in the sport. I'm also creating vids for ANW obstacles as where we train, father and son made the Houston city finals (David Yarter made it to Vegas). 

So, my question to you is... What do you want to see? What are things for Tough Mudder you want covered. Are there specific obstacles where I could go over different forms to clear them, methods to train for going over/under/though things? Do you guys have the same burning questions of what shoes should to wear and what hydration packs to get for a standard TM vs a WTM?

The bridges are configured, and I can see, ping, telnet and SSH in to both of them. The main bridge on the main site can see, and ping it's host trunked switch, and the switch can see and ping the main bridge. Both can also ping the remote bridge no problem, and it can also ping back.

Nothing, however, can ping or reach the switch that is trunked to the remote bridge in my warehouse. It also can't ping the bridge it is directly connected to. It's a basic trunk with my access and voice VLANs

So, I have some cool news. First, I took your suggestions for the video series in my previous thread, and I should be finishing the filming of the first few episodes this weekend. An idea that hit me today while training was also, how to rig your own obstacles. A friend and fellow racer is a rigger. So, we are going to show you some badass knots and the right kinds of ropes to get. That's also on the docket tomorrow. Keep any ideas coming. Even unorthodox ones. One of my favorites was from /u/Mechachrome about how to properly bail from an obstacle. 

Second, as of today I am the Crew Chief for MudRunGuide.com. You probably already know the site, but I'm the guy in charge of media requests for races and getting race recaps/reviews and op/ed's up. So, if any of you all have been wanting to write gear reviews, race recaps or even things completely outside of the box like interviewing the race directors and course designers.

The rest between each run will depend on distance it takes you to find an area to do your pull-ups. If there isn't a good bar to do them on, make sure you bring a towel or section of rope to drape over a limb. High tempo pace for the runs. I used my Grip Slings for it.

I'm making a video series that will progress through different obstacles. I'm going to progress through each obstacle with techniques used at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. I'm also going to be going over the basic exercises needed to strengthen one ability to perform the obstacle in the first place, or to get them through if they are only able to get part way (Think the multi/platinum rig). 

I'm going to be covering every obstacle I can, explaining and showing the techniques in each video. I'm going to cover not only Spartan, but ANW and other obstacles used at other race series as I'm able to get to them. 

So now, I have questions for you all. What are some of the obstacles you want to see first? Traverse wall, 7ft wall, tyrulian, multi-rig, rope climbs, warped wall, spider climb, unstable bridge....? Are you wanting to see more basic form instructional first, or wanting to just go whole hog into the obstacles?

I have three sites with five domain controllers total. One in each remote and two in my main. My Main site is running two Server 2008 R2 VMs, and the remote locations are all physical boxes.

One 2008 (Not R2), Two 2003. I'm trying to think of the best way to get all of them upgraded to 2012...

Right now, my plan is to get two new physical servers for the locations running 2003. Set them up locally, then ship them out to the locations. Once they are online, decommission the old ones by removing AD/DC from those machines, making sure they are stripped of everything before powering them off and saying good riddance. 

The 2008, I'm thinking I can do an in-place upgrade to 2012 R2 locally. That office is only a few hours away, so it shouldn't be a big deal. I just have to run the commands to upgrade the AD schema first, then do the server upgrade itself.

Here at my main site, since they are VMs, I can just spin up new ones. Make one of them the schema master, setup HA, file transfer and housekeeping, then decommission those VMs and get rid of them.

Does this sound like the best course of action and order of operations, or should I tackle this in a different order/method?",sysadmin,AD/DC Upgrade for multiple sites and OSes to 2012 R2,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3d9env/addc_upgrade_for_multiple_sites_and_oses_to_2012/
