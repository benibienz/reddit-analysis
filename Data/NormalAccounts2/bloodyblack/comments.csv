Every Pokemon has 2 attacks, 1 standard that you can spam and one that needs to charge. You can watch how much charge you got below your hp bar and use that attack by holding your finger on the screen.
These special attacks you can also dodge by swiping on your screen.

Also, you don't have infite potions, you need to be careful. Types also matter, try using a counter, it makes a huge difference. The cp points just seems for me as a stat to summarize how strong a pokemone is.
It also seems that XL pokemons have more hp and XS pokemon a higher cp cap(But I am not sure and these things are not confirmed,yet).

117,"Well, I am a Dota2 player. I never came to the Idea to compare both games. They are totally different and anyone who tries to compare MOBAs and Overwatch(on both sides) just has a small penis. 
Anyway I can say, large communities are always mostly toxic, but there slight differences depending on the game. LoL has a very young community, resulting in a lot of raging kiddies. Dota2 is a harder game, it has a more mature community, but there are still a lot of toxic people, they are just not raging but still very aggressive and the Dota2 community is a bit less toxic than LoL. CS:GO is a mix off both.
It would help Overwatch a lot if russians get their own servers. Russian people are not more toxic than others, but they are almost always speaking their own language and thats for many people so annoying, resulting in more toxic against them, which makes them more toxic against non-russian people.
I don't want  to be some kind of a racist. But in LoL they got their own server and believe me that is much better.
But I get to much off-topic.

The game will get same toxic community like all others, there will come toxic people from, FPS, MOBAS, RTS and there are even a lot of toxic people in this subreddit.",2015-10-18 09:05:13+00:00,cw3toq3,1.0,t3_3p6pij,22576.0,Overwatch
