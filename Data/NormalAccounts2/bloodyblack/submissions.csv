I played now almost 1000hours. But most of the time I play alone or with 2 other people(that are far above my elo). I want to change that. I would love to play as a 5 stack regulary.
Having 4 other reliable players with fixed roles would be great.
I am 2k support player, playing on Euw server and I am available at 16:00-21:00 MESZ MO-FR and most of the weekend. I can also offer a teamspeak server.

So I made this hero concept, It's not going into detail but I want to hear your opinion about the idea.
And if you got a name suggestion, tell me.


**General Design**: He is a young, small and thin guy, between 16-25 years old. He seems agil but not especially strong. And he wears a functional leather armor/uniform. His weapon is an electric glove on his right hand, more about that later. Also he got rocket boots.
This guy is friendly, but face to face to his enemies he is cold-blooded and kills with no mercy.
He got 200hp.

Abilities:

**Normal Attack**: While holding LMT he is charging an electric lightning bolt in his glove that fires when stop holding the button. The bolts damage and radius increases whith the charging time. The range is infite and there is no spread. 
But, if you charge to long, the glove gets a short-circuit and all abilities that are using the glove are blocked for 1-2 seconds.

**1. Ability**: He is releasing a thunderstorm in a low range in front of him. The ability has a wide cone and damage all enemies hit slightly and stuns for 0.5 seconds.

**2. Ability**: The hero places a shock mine, if an emeny triggers the mine, it's releasing 3 circle shock waves in an interval of 0.5 seconds that damages and slows all enemies hit.

**Movement-Ability**: When he is In-Air he can hold space or shift to activate his rocket boots, which moves him upward and forward, you can control your direction horizontal but not vertical. The time you can use them is limited, but you can use them every jump.

**Ultimate-Ability**: You charge a small distance, if you are next to an enemy while or immediately after the charge, you grab him with your glove and kill him instant.

**Melee Attack**: He slices the enemy with a knife that he quickly draws with his left hand.




His role will be to disable and kill enemies that pushed to far into your team, also he is able to give medium and long range fire support.",Overwatch,Hero Concept (No Name yet),https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/3r2h9g/hero_concept_no_name_yet/

All answers listed here were given official by the devs.

Q: Will there be many changes between this version being shown and the beta version?

A: Probably! This version you're watching now is what we call ""Show Mode."" so a lot of systems and settings are disabled (that will be available for beta).

-
Q: The card system after the end of the game, does it have any effect on player progression or rewards?

A: Not currently! We'll see how feedback goes in beta, though. :)

-
Q: What is that bar underneath the Health bar?

A: Is our current version of what we call our ""on fire bar"" (super technical term). If you start to pose enough of a threat, your portrait will catch on fire in the score screen and indicate to the other team that you're dangerous and probably should be murdered. :P

-
Q: Have you guys given any thought to player cosmetics? I saw you just mentioned portrait borders and what not, but what about skins or gear?

A: That's definitely be one of THE most popular requests we've had (skins). We think it could be a cool idea!

-
Q: How long will the Beta last?

A: Hard to say. It depends on how player feedback goes, as well as how our stress tests go. :)

-
Q: Do the characters have infinite ammo? It seems like her secondary ammo count isn't going down

A: Infinite ammo in that you don't have to pick up ammo as you go. You will need to reload periodically, however; the frequency depends on the hero and their gun's magazine size.

-
Q: Can we expect a founders pack like we did for the HoTS beta?

A: We haven't announced our business model yet.

-
Q: No beta for eu, why?

A: We're hoping to launch beta in our Europe and Asia gameplay regions are soon as possible. We're still working to get those regions ready!

-
Q: Will there be hero changing in the competive mode(s)?

A: We'd like to see how beta goes. Hero switching is a pretty core mechanic of the game and we want to see how the game fairs with a larger audience before we start adding any rules. (We'd like to avoid adding rules if possible. Overwatch is kind of defined by its ""unbound"" nature.)

-
Q: Has Blizz said if they are going to announce anymore heroes before the beta starts?

A: Blizzard has not said! However, the content you're seeing today (heroes and maps) will be what you'll see in beta when it launches!

-
Q: Is there a single player mode?

A: There isn't. We no plans for a single-player mode for 
Overwatch right now. It definitely is a multiplayer, PVP focus.

-
Q: Will we get the Junkrat and Roadhog gameplay previews?

A: We're more focused on getting the game ready for beta, but we hope to provide those gameplay previews as soon as possible.

-
Q: Is there controller support or is it better to play it with mouse + keyboard?

A: We're working to get controller support. Whether its better to play with one or the other is completely up to the individual player.

-
Q: How long is the average overwatch match ?

A: On the teams and how well matched they are. Typical matches last between 10 and 15 minutes, though.

-
Q: what is the min requirements for this baby?

A: Still working those out! We hope to share current min specs when beta begins.

Q: Can you get ""kill streaks"" when you get assist ""eliminations?"" That seems.... pretty lame.

A: It's a team game, so kill streaks do get awarded with assists as well. Your scoreboard will differentiate between eliminations (kills + assists) and killing blows, though.

And here 2 Answers where I missed the questions:

A: There definitely are ways to customize your settings (keybindings, FOV, mouse sensitivity, etc). Those aren't really available in this ""Show Mode,"" but will be available in the normal game.

A: For cosmetics, we are experimenting with a progression system that does award cosmetics like hero portrait borders. Our progression system is still in its infancy, though! You can see the beginnings of it here.

Also confirmed at the stream:
There will be a training mode with bots. You can set the difficulty and can also play with your friends to try out anything you want.",Overwatch,"(Almost) All Answers of the devs in the ""HayliNic"" Twitch Chat",https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/3ow5tt/almost_all_answers_of_the_devs_in_the_haylinic/
