One thing I have found is that you've got to know when to say no.  If you say yes to everything you won't get some of the most important things done like spending time with family.  You've also got to realize when you're not helping anyone by doing everything and take a time out so that you can come back refreshed and reenergized.


And on a practical level, Google calendar rocks.  I schedule everything even break times.  Putting important stuff on the calendar and then focusing on doing just that means I get a ton done.",2016-11-20 16:52:37+00:00,da8aqbq,1.0,t3_5dqfzx,137376.0,GetMotivated

Why would you sign up for this card? If you can identify one reason you personally would do it then you'll be able to sell it.  If not, you don't believe in your own product and you aren't likely to sell well, find something you do believe in to sell.

A good rule of thumb when giving feedback is to use the sandwich approach, one positive, one area for improvement, one positive.

I know this is going to sound selfish, but I've found it a lot harder over the years to do things that I don't enjoy just because others enjoy them (I'm almost 40).  I do those things too, but I've found it is easier to just find others that hold my same interests rather than trying to constantly do things I don't enjoy doing because someone else wants to.

That helped me quite a bit, because I tried to model my conversations and body language with people based on the way they conversed and acted.  People tend to like others who are like they are, and by mirroring a little you get that effect.


Bottom line, sometimes it is more efficient to take the extra time to learn the social nuances than it is to just get right to to the point.  Think through how the person is likely to receive what you are saying before you hit send, if they can't hear what you are saying because they are offended then the directness is not efficient.

Just then, two more coyotes of equal size appeared, they were walking along the edge of a small field.  I then spotted three more walking on the other side of the field, and a pair walking down the middle, they were hunting.


By now,  I was getting more than a bit concerned.  One I could probably deal with.  Two?  Maybe.  **Eight large ones?  Oh hell no.**


I sat as still as possible while the three on my side walked by, not more than 10 yards away.

Major changes in their life can certainly revert kids temporarily for awhile as well, I had that happen with one of my girls when going through a divorce.  She'll pull out of it though as long as her routine settles back down and she is getting consistent feedback.

The best way I've found to deal with the accidents is to simply take her to the bathroom at specific intervals.  Around this age kids tend to get busy playing and think they can hold it longer than they really can.  It can also be a way of getting attention.

For stealing, she's testing the boundaries or trying to get attention, again pretty normal.  I'd suggest telling her that we don't steal and ask her how she would feel if someone took her things?  Tell her that there will be consequences to her stealing in the future, then follow through.  Taking away a prized possession for a day or something like that generally worked well for me at that age.

For attention, try making sure you are doing things like taking her out to the park to play and such and actively trying to spend one on one time with her.

Earlier this year, my basement flooded, and after insurance it cost over $15,000 to repair.

I had another ER visit for one of my 5 kids at the end of last year, and that cost me around $3k out of pocket because of insurance changes at work.

Luckily I had emergency funds set up and was able to get these taken care of because I've been disciplined in my budget, but those are the types of things that destroy finances for most people.  

Once you get into a hole, you're paying money (interest) because you are in a hole.

The only answer I've found is to stop digging once you're in a hole, and to focus on whatever you can do to increase your income and reduce your expenses.

19 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, 20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, 21 envy,[d] drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 

22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. 24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. 26 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.",2016-08-19 14:22:17+00:00,d6o2e67,2.0,t1_d6mkr93,88114.0,Christians

134,"So you are hanging out with another woman often times well after 11PM, and you are surprised that your wife thinks there may be something going on?

Put yourself in her shoes for a moment.  If she was going out with friends several times a week, especially a single male, and not getting home until after 11PM, wouldn't you be a tiny bit concerned?

I get that her concerns are unwarranted in this circumstance as far as cheating goes, but people have a funny way of building up things in their minds.  She doesn't have a circle of friends of her own that she is going out with, so she is looking to you to provide her some companionship in the evening.  When you don't show up until after 11, she is staring at the wall imagining all sorts of things that you might be doing.

I think the answer is a little bit twofold.  First, spend some time making sure your wife knows she is a priority for you.  Make sure you are taking her out on dates and spending time with her.  Also encourage her to do her own things, and introduce her to people around town.  You have a circle of friends because you are in a familiar area, she is in a new area with no friends.  Help her make some friends and find some new hobbies.  And spend time with her, that's what she is wanting from you at the moment.

I do think you are thinking divorce way too early.  If a little jealousy from her because you are not spending enough time with your wife is the worst that comes along, you're probably doing pretty well.  

Continue going to counseling, no major breakthroughs usually happen in those sessions for at least a month or two, it takes time for everyone to get comfortable talking about issues and for the counselor to get a handle on what the underlying issues are.",2016-07-06 21:34:44+00:00,d51ywgp,1.0,t3_4rjd4k,17895.0,Divorce
135,"I'm in management, and KPI's are a good idea, but our company does not rely a lot on them.  Sales reps are financially incentivized by how much revenue they bring in to the bottom line, not how many dials they make or how they get those sales.  If they sell a lot of stuff, they'll make a lot of money.  If they don't, then they won't.  

The hard part as a manager is without focusing on activity, all you have to look at is the results.  You could have a great rep that had an off quarter, but without knowing what the activity was it is easy to say they were just slacking off.

The ideal use for KPI's is to identify what is important, and to give people a scoreboard that shows how they are doing.  If the KPI's identified don't reflect what is important to that position, then they are of little or no use.  For sales, the right type of dials are typically very important.  We don't go over those daily for our reps though, but we do talk about the importance of prospecting on a regular basis.  

Our reps tend to look at the stats themselves because they have figured out that if they want to increase their income by 10%, they'll have to increase their activity by at least that much or figure out a way to make their activities more productive.  The best reps pretty well manage themselves with just a little coaching from time to time, everyone needs a nudge at times.",2016-07-05 20:52:15+00:00,d50i0yb,1.0,t3_4rekx0,3056.0,sales

1.  Check out a 529 plan for your college savings if you are in the US.  That will provide tax advantages when you need to take out the money prior to retirement.  There are multiple funds available, do a google search on 529 plan reviews.
2.  Look at the Roth IRA plan.  The advantage there is that you pay taxes up front, but then can take out the money later tax free.  If you take it out prior to retirement age, then you can only take out as much as you invested originally before dealing with penalties though.  This can allow you to invest but then use the funds later if need be (I've personally had to do this a time or two).

First of all, your boyfriend doesn't sound like he has been around kids much, if he's breaking up with you because of something your kid said then that means he doesn't know how to handle them in my opinion.

Next, it is possible that you guys are trying too hard.  You are the one wanting this relationship to work, not your kid.  Give it time, cooking the relationship is best done in a slow cooker.  As much as you and he want it, he isn't his dad, and it will take time (years) for the kid to think of him as a father figure, if he ever does.

You need to reassure your kid that he will always be a priority in your life.  Talk to him and listen to what he has to say, at 8 kids are starting to get to the point where they can have some very startling and insightful conversations.  Right now my guess is he's probably feeling like he's being forced into this and that your priority is on your boyfriend.  Acting out and pushing back on the new thing that is taking all of mommy's attention is a natural reaction to something like that.

Part of that conversation should be that you realize that he may not like this guy, but that you expect him to behave in a respectful manner like he should towards any adult.  If he cannot then there will be consequences.  Take away some privilege for a day or two when he is being disrespectful.  Remember that you are the parent here, not your boyfriend or your child.

Show him how to be respectful by being respectful to him as well and truly listening to what he has to say.  You will likely have some interesting conversations.",2016-06-28 18:40:43+00:00,d4rj7i6,1.0,t3_4qavvl,1658.0,relationships

If your husband is not spending a lot of time with this woman alone, or suddenly working a lot of late nights, and it is not affecting your relationship with him then you are probably OK.  If his actions are starting to interfere with your time with him, then it may be time to say something to him like I'm a little concerned about how much time you are spending with April, it feels like it is starting to take away from the time we have together.

I recommend focusing on making sure that you are doing the things that are needed to keep your own relationship strong.  

Go out on dates with your husband.  Make yourself look good.  Do the things that are necessary to keep yourself healthy and happy.  Find some new groups during the day to get out of the house, maybe there are some mom groups or other ones that seem interesting nearby?
