Whee!  I thought?  Oh that can't be good...

It had been a long day at work, up at 5:30AM, it was now about 6 in the evening and I knew the hungry horde would be waiting for me when I got home.

I decided I didn't feel up to cooking tonight, and splurged on a rare treat.  I stopped at KFC, and picked up a bucket of chicken with a few sides.  Armed with food to distract the ravenous wolves, I headed home.

Arriving at home, I sat the bag down on the kitchen table, and headed back into back room to tell everyone that food was here.  I barely made it to the bedroom, and I heard it.

**""Whee!!!""**

My heart sank.  That's never a good sound unless we are at the amusement park.


I turned around and ran back to the kitchen, following the Whee's that were getting louder and louder.

""Lauren!!!"" I yelled, not quite believing what I was seeing.

Dodging flying gravy, I disarmed my 4 year old daughter who was standing in the middle of the table waving a now mostly empty tub of gravy.

Somehow she had managed to fling the majority of the gravy into the whirring ceiling fan above her.  Looking around, my heart sunk again as I realized the extent of the damage.  Every surface in the kitchen was dripping with dark gooey gravy.
Lauren was still giggling and was coated from head to toe in gravy as well.  Anger melted and I had a hard time not cracking up.

Putting on a stern face, I said, ""I'm very angry with you!""

I picked her up and carted her to the tub.  

A few hours of cleaning later, I wasn't cracking up anymore, but I couldn't really stay mad either.  We finally ate what was left, and after putting the kids to bed, I crashed in bed myself.
Another day of crazy down.  These are the adventures of fatherhood.  Crazy at times, but these days are those memories are made of.",thingsmykidsaid,"""**WHEE!!!**"" Parents...if you ever hear this coming from the kitchen, it probably isn't a good thing.
