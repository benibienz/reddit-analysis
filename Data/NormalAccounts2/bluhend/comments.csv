59,"found the others just now, got this by running my 23andme results through rhonda patricks webtool, i mean, i eat a TON of saturated fat but stuff like this is kind of concerning, not sure if I should take heed or just ignore it:

rs1121980(C;T)	1.67-fold increased risk for obesity particularly with saturated fat	The FTO gene is called fat mass and obesity-associated protein because it is the gene that is the major genetic risk factor for obesity. This particular polymorphism is one of many in this gene that influence genetic obesity risk. This genotype, rs1121980(C;T), is associated with a roughly 1.67-fold increased risk for obesity, particularly in the context of a high saturated fat and low polyunsaturated fat intake. Polyunsaturated fats are found in foods like fatty fish such as salmon, herring and polyunsaturated fat is also found in nuts. Saturated fat is found in fatty beef, pork, butter, cheese, and other dairy products. This suggests that individuals that are at high risk of obesity due to FTO polymorphisms, such as this one, may benefit by having a higher polyunsaturated fat intake and a lower saturated fat intake.


rs9939609(A;T)	possible increased risk for obesity and type-2 diabetes	The FTO gene is called fat mass and obesity-associated protein because it is the gene that is the major genetic risk factor for obesity. This particular polymorphism is one of many in this gene that influence genetic obesity risk. This genotype has an intermediate increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes due to high production of ghrelin. Higher ghrelin levels are associated with over-eating due to lack of satiation.  A possible way to bypass this defect may be to increases consumption of lauric acid, a medium-chain triglyceride found in coconut oil. Lauric acid has been shown to significantly decrease the production of ghrelin. This genotype has also been associated with obesity particularly in the context of a high saturated fat and low polyunsaturated fat intake. Polyunsaturated fats are found in foods like fatty fish such as salmon, herring and polyunsaturated fat is also found in nuts. Saturated fat is found in fatty beef, pork, butter, cheese, and other dairy products. This suggests that individuals that are at high risk of obesity due to FTO polymorphisms, such as this one, may benefit by having a higher polyunsaturated fat intake and a lower saturated fat intake.


rs17817449(G;T)	saturated fat may have a negative effect on blood glucose and insulin levels	The FTO gene is called fat mass and obesity-associated protein because it is the gene that is the major genetic risk factor for obesity. This particular genotype, rs17817449(G;T), is associated with a 1.3-fold increased obesity risk. Saturated fat may have a negative effect on blood glucose and insulin levels and increases type 2 diabetes risk in individuals with this genotype. Other gene polymorphisms in the FTO gene are also associated with obesity particularly in the context of a high saturated fat and low polyunsaturated fat intake. Polyunsaturated fats are found in foods like fatty fish such as salmon, herring and polyunsaturated fat is also found in nuts. Saturated fat is found in fatty beef, pork, butter, cheese, and other dairy products. This suggests that individuals that are at high risk due to FTO polymorphisms may benefit by having a higher polyunsaturated fat intake and a lower saturated fat intake.",2016-10-20 23:08:25+00:00,d910d12,,t1_d8uuf5z,,Paleo

""I stated it very, very poorly. I left out the word ""flavor"". A sign of a properly-fermented sauerkraut is NO SALT flavor. It has been shown that fermentation breaks down the salt.

Our Pickl-It recipe - which I see has crashed - is for every 5-lbs of threaded cabbage, you need 22 grams of salt.

We do have people with severe renal issues who are trying to cut their kraut down to 11 grams, but it, of course, isn't effective for pulling the water from the fibers. They do, however, do well at 22 grams, when they let the kraut ferment for at least 12-weeks.

115,"THANKS!  I wrote to them and this was their answer so I will try at least 12 weeks. :)

We recommend a 12-week fermentation. We've learned from researchers that a sign of great, authentic kraut is no salt, and only the flavor of great sauerkraut. Typically,
that happens at 12-weeks, but other Pickl-it customers prefer 16-week fermentation. Others like 20-week ferments. Often this depends on the type of cabbage, the soil
in which the cabbage was grown, and even temperature ranges.

The 4th stage of fermentation is at 12-weeks, is fully ""done"". However, fermentation continues for a very long time.

When you make and keep Pickl-It in the Pickl-It containers, you can expect them to be nutritionally beneficial 18-24 months.

Think long-term - Pickl-It is a food preservation tool. Does this help?",2016-09-15 11:23:52+00:00,d7nnqpf,,t1_d7k8b8m,,fermentation

Therefore, if both l-theanine and glycine were released immediately, l-theanine would lose the contest. Allowing glycine to quickly spike and be absorbed by our brain quickly, while l-theanine spends the rest of the night trickling in, allows us to get much more benefit from the l-theanine."" on here https://www.grc.com/health/sleep/healthy_sleep_formula.htm",2016-05-25 12:20:56+00:00,d3iytor,4.0,t1_d3ij6fy,37957.0,Nootropics

As an essential dietary mineral, magnesium plays many important roles which include: helping cells produce metabolic energy, supporting optimum nerve function, helping muscles relax properly and maintaining a healthy heartbeat. Glycine has been shown to be an efficient carrier for minerals that facilitate absorption in the intestine tract. Glycine is used by the body to form collagen, a key protein in cartilage and connective tissue.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply. We do not have any reports incorporating interleukin 15. Additionally, we do not have reports that would address your ability to build muscle.

To see all available reports, please visit: https://www.23andme.com/service/

Please let us know if you have any additional questions.

Beverly Meyer: So some supplement companies like Jarrow whatever make an MK7 and
then the MK4 is the one that generally is sourced from the animals-the
animal fats, the animal organs, the egg yolk, the ghee. The pastured ghee
has a little. So if you think animal and you're going to some MK4 but we
use it up so quickly that we just can't sustain it. So it doesn’t really matter
to me which you supplement it with. You don’t necessarily want to
overdo it although there're no reports of any overdosing on K2.",2016-04-02 17:16:36+00:00,d1n4yiz,,t1_d1n2qtb,3727.0,fermentation

1025,"Many people will incorporate a choline source along with a racetam. Choline can potentially increase the potency of racetams while reducing negative side effects. However, it is not a required addition to a racetam stack like many think. One should always try things in isolation, then add in other compounds to augment it once you get a feel for things. Also, certain foods are natural high in choline, like eggs, fish, cheese, and red meat.

1464,"that's great!  and thanks, the following is from a post someone write to me around xmas, it was HUGE for me, maybe it will help\;

My grand epiphany occurred reading Rational Recovery: The New Cure for Substance Addiction.
Until that book, I never really knew why I seemingly couldn't control or stop my alcohol consumption.
The basics are alcohol is not what you crave. It is the vehicle used to deliver the high you seek. It could very well be any substance, any drug that is used, but what is important is the high.
Take you and me, we've trained our brain to need this junk. Our brains were never suited to be in such a hyper-pleasurable state. For us, there's something that I guess gets turned on to where we start seeking the high out more and more and more and we then find ourselves addicted to whatever it may be.
That part of our brains wants that pleasure, needs it, and will stop at nothing to feel it. It doesn't care if it kills the body it's in. As long as the hyper-pleasurable state can be gotten everything is roses.
The book calls this THE BEAST.
So, it is you - the person that knows alcohol is poison and wants to stop - vs. THE BEAST.
The separation is important. You are not that desire. It is separate from you and you can control it. You are in control. This is something we forgot when we let alcohol take over our lives.
So, ok, say you tell yourself you are quitting. Fine, that part of your brain says. It can wait. It knows no concept of time. All it knows is that someday you will drink again and it will lay in wait for however long it takes.
During this time away though, it comes after you with thoughts and feelings and cravings. It whispers to you just how worthless and weak you are and you should just stop this foolish sobriety thing and go back to being the loser you know you are.
Yep, it doesn't fight fair.
See:
and EVERY CELL in my body says ""go to the bar (or liquor store) and CELEBRATE, you DESERVE (reward) it!!! Let's have some FUN!!
This is THE BEAST in all its glory.
You want to make it scared? Feel it's fear? Tell yourself that you will never drink again, ever. Pay attention to the feelings that brings to you. You feel that fight or flight response kicking in? Breathing kicks up, maybe you feel a knot in your throat. Something in you is screaming NOOOOOO! DON'T DO THAT!
You have brought THE BEAST out and shined a light on it. It really hates being known. It would rather hide behind your eyes whispering just the right things to get you to succumb again and drink. Pull it out in the sunlight it cowers.
So what can you do? This is the hard part. You have to tell it no. You have to stand up to it and tell it that you will not succumb no matter how hard it comes after you. This starts one day at a time. Or even one hour at a time. It means getting into some kind of treatment that works for you and working it openly and honestly. You have to do this for you. Doing it for anything else just won't work. This is all about you getting clean and sober, others need not apply.
Next on the agenda is to restructure your thinking about alcohol in general. Alcohol was my buddy and was always there for me when I needed to celebrate, relax, when I was angry, sad, whatever it was I could always work alcohol in. It always had a place at my table.
You have to change that 180 degrees. You need to start thinking about alcohol for what it is, poison. You can dress it up as fancy as you like, but when all is said and done it's a substance you shouldn't allow in your body at all. There are no positive effects, there are no benefits to this junk.
You have to hate it and I mean detest it so much that the thought of it or you drinking it turns your stomach. It's not your friend and never was. It is a life waster. It is a life taker. What have you gotten from your drinking? What good has come from it? When I answer that, I only have one word.
Nothing.
So none of this is easy, but you can do it. I did it and am doing it and I am nothing special. I am just like you and the rest of the people of the world, just trying to make it through and do the best I can with what I have. It's rough and tough. There's no doubt about that. The only thing alcohol does is make what's already rough and tough rougher and tougher. It doesn't solve anything. It's a lie.
There's got to be something else you do that brings you joy and happiness. Instead of ruining your holiday with alcohol, try doing that whatever it is. Or maybe you can think of something that you don't have time for now because of drinking that you enjoyed before. Whatever hobby that is pick it up and do it again. For me, I rediscovered my love of chess and playing the guitar. Maybe you can fix a favorite food or dessert. Anything is better than picking up another container of alcohol.
Promise yourself, just for the remainder of this day you will not drink. Tomorrow when you wake up promise yourself that today, that 24-hours, you will not drink.
Give yourself the best gift you can this holiday. Choose to be sober.
Merry Happy Christmas Holidays!",2016-01-14 01:23:39+00:00,cyxdx3q,4.0,t1_cyxd5u6,1285.0,stopdrinking

1. beware of euphoric recall/nostalgia/rose colored glasses about drinking - your brain will try to remind you of everything that was great about drinking and conveniently forget what was bad or what sucked - make a list of all the shit alcohol caused you, everything bad about it and remind yourself of this often

2. with every day that goes buy ask yourself - do I want to have to go through these 12 days again?  for me, the more days I had under my belt the higher the stakes got to quit

3. give yourself all the support you need to not drink, meetings, post here, etc...
