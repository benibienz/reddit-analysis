Your goal should be:


150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week (like jogging, yoga, or dancing); or,


75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per week (like running, Zumba, or playing sports); or,


30 sets of highest-intensity activity per week (like sprinting, jumping rope, or resistance training); or,


Some combination of the above Moderate, vigorous, and highest-intensity activity are defined as follows:

There are several polymorphisms in this gene make the NAT2 gene function very slowly. This genotype (gs140) is considered to be the slowest, meaning it does not inactivate heterocyclic amine carcinogens very well.""

1. Does this mean do not exceed an internal temperature of 300? Or does it mean do not cook it in an oven set at 300 or greater?


2. And is it actually saying do not eat any meat that has been fried or grilled?

3. What supplements or foods (in addition to cruciferous vegetables) would help inactivate heterocyclic amine carcinogens?  Is there a supplement that you can take that is the equivalent of eating a ton of cruciferous vegetables?

rs1801131(A;C)
Possibly impaired folate metabolism MTHFR rs1801131 (C) or MTHFR A1298C is a mutation in the folate pathway, specifically in the enzyme involved in converting 5-methylfolate (5MTHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF). Defects in folate metabolism can increase the risk of neural tube defects and possibly contribute to risk of stroke / heart attack. Unlike rs1801133 or MTHFR C677T, this mutation does not lead to elevated homocysteine levels, however some studies have suggested that there may be a synergistic effect in individuals heterozygous for both mutations.

""Still, if you time your exercise session to about 300 min after taking niacin you may have some extra benefits, because getting that peak growth hormone secretion at the time you are exercising may help boost some of the benefits of exercise.

For example, the excess growth hormone secretion may reduce muscle catabolism and increase muscle anabolism, at the same time, leading to an increase in muscle gain.

1. do I need to ""burp"" the stuff or not?  I am fermenting this:

I put a layer of olive oil on top to seal it, then the lid is saran wrap with the metal lid on top of it ... one theory said that the CO2 will escape out of the olive oil but not let air in ... is that true?  so i don't ever need to take the lid off?


2. put in fridge after about 7 days or 28 days??  Read these links and sounds like the most healing mix would be 28 days, is this true?

I am not 100% ketogenic but try to be as low carb as possible, with some occasional cheating (don't shoot!).  My main question is lifting related:

I have been doing the Body by Science approach for years now, my own homebrewed version which is legs every 2 weeks, chest (pushing) every 2 weeks and back (pulling) every 2 weeks staggered.  I know this sounds lame, i.e. like I'm not doing much and it's true!  But I am wondering what others might suggest in terms of a program to transition to that would lead to better gains in strength and size from where I'm at now?  I am not a beginning lifter, my body has adapted to the years of this BBS approach and the science seems to say that more FREQUENCY would be needed.  Any tips?



I should add that I'm 47 yrs old and am not looking to be in the gym every day or even 3 days a week, I play ice hockey and get exercise in other ways so am hoping for something that will be a LITTLE more frequency or volume than BBS ... IF POSSIBLE
