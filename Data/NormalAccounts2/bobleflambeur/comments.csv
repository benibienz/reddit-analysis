Check voiesvertes.com for routes. There are tons of long routes that you can take where you barely spend any time on busy roads. Lots of canals and country roads. The tourism offices usually have free maps that you can take.

The idea behind the mix was to squeeze a night out -- from sunset to the wee hours of the morning -- into an hour. Goes from more laidback sounds to guitar-driven house, with a couple of late-night tracks at the end. I know that the transition at 37 min. is a bit off. I welcome any other input on the mixing/selection. Traktor + a bit of vinyl.

There's a shop called La Belga in the Roma Norte neighborhood that stocks a really wide selection of beers. At night the bar next store (which is also worth a visit) lets you drink beers from the shop on their patio. There is also a brewpub right around the corner, but the name escapes me.

I don't know if they do tours, but there is a brewery in DF called La Chingoneria that makes really good beer.

There's a micro-brewery called 27 Cervezeria in the Centro that serves their beer at their own bar, El Andar. The food is overpriced but the beer isn't.

There's also a big beer bar on the square at Monumento a la Revolucion.

This TimeOut article lists some more places:
http://www.timeoutmexico.mx/df/antros-bares/cervecerias-en-el-df

I find El Deposito to be overpriced, but it still will be cheap by US standards. Have been meaning to go to Bosforo; have heard good things.

Try some beers from La Brü and Puerco Salvaje. Good stuff.
