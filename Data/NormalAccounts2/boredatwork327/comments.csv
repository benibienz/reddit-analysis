0,"Yea I think I can be a bit more assertive in coming up with ideas before someone asks me to.  That and being detail oriented, but ratings aside, it's still the nature of the work that my entire team does. 

Rating wise though, it's a lot about who you know and getting someone who will vouch for you, as well as how many analysts are on your team.  It's a lot harder on large accounts than it is on smaller accounts.  ",2015-08-26 15:22:44+00:00,cugbvck,8,t1_cufdes3,73559,consulting
1,"I partially agree, partially disagree.  Agreed in that analysts do a lot of grunt work/ stuff no one else wants to do, but you CAN make an assessment by looking at what the bigger picture of the team/ company is, and if you look at the consultants and senior consultants above you I think you can make sense of what they do and decide ifyou eventually want to be in their shoes.  

Also I don't know what companies you guys work for, but there were phases where I got an enormous amount of responsibility for my level, which was great.  A lot of my team (consultants and SCs) share grunt work (i.e. reviewing deliverable, testing, debugging) but that's basically 100% of the project.  I look at what they do at the SC level and decided that that's not the kind of position I Want to be in. ",2015-08-26 15:20:43+00:00,cugbsdc,8,t1_cufdewq,73433,consulting
2,"Yea i knew before I joined, but only on a very vague basis.  The job was framed as more of an analysis type job/ heavy client facing but it's mostly software testing.   I have friends who do some interesting stuff but most projects for non technical people are testing projects.",2015-08-25 18:49:14+00:00,cufd3zr,6,t1_cufcsuw,468,consulting
3,Yup! first position out of undergrad. I strongly want to develop more analytical skills but i'm not getting that here.  It feels like in a bigger firm it's way harder to chase down the few opportunities that pertain to you,2015-08-25 18:41:19+00:00,cufcsos,2,t1_cufcqt9,75,consulting
4,"I'm involved in a few initiatives firm wide - i enjoy them but still not developing the exact skills a lot.  People on my project do actually get a decent amount of ownership on a small scale at least, so I didn't know if there was anything that I could do to take initiative on my own.  It's kind of required to get above average ratings so when you dont' get it, you're screwed",2015-08-25 18:38:24+00:00,cufcofd,6,t1_cufcgbp,332,consulting
5,"So by leadership/ ownership i mean small things like - leading meetings, or owning a deliverable etc.   I See your point, but if you have any advice on how to develop the skills I want since I can't get them on my current project that would be helpful as well.

6,"So i actually finished a year of federal tech consulting, the above was a typo.  

In terms of letting people know that I am unhappy with my job, I've spoken with my manager and teammates about wanting more leadership/ ownership on the project, as well as told them the types of problems I like to solve and think about.  The thing is that in regards to the stuff i'm interested in, there's no scope for that on my project.  They make it pretty hard to leave too.  I've been trying to speak to people outside of my project to figure out other opportunities available but since i'm not going to roll off for a few months, it's been hard to figure out next steps/ people say they have nothing available.
