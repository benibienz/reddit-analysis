""A company controlled by Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, secretly conducted business in Communist Cuba during Fidel Castro’s presidency despite strict American trade bans that made such undertakings illegal, according to interviews with former Trump executives, internal company records and court filings.""

""Documents show that the Trump company spent a minimum of $68,000 for its 1998 foray into Cuba at a time when the corporate expenditure of even a penny in the Caribbean country was prohibited without U.S. government approval.""

""He did not disclose that, seven months earlier, Trump Hotels already had reimbursed its consultants for the money they spent on their secret business trip to Havana.
At the time, Americans traveling to Cuba had to receive specific U.S. government permission, which was granted only for an extremely limited number of purposes, such as humanitarian efforts. Neither an American nor a company based in the United States could spend any cash in Cuba; instead, a foreign charity or similar sponsoring entity needed to pay all expenses, including travel. Without obtaining a license from the federal Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) before the consultants went to Cuba, the undertaking by Trump Hotels would have been in violation of federal law, trade experts say.""

""Trump’s campaign manager, was asked about the allegations on the television program The View. She replied that, “They paid money, as I understand, in 1998,” but went on to say that Trump had never invested in the Caribbean nation. **In that statement, Conway has acknowledged that Trump broke the law.** Paying the money for the business trip and meetings in Cuba – regardless of whether it resulted in an additional investment or casino deal – would directly violate the law.""

""A former Trump executive who spoke on condition of anonymity says the company did not obtain a government license prior to the trip. Internal documents show that executives involved in the Cuba project were still discussing the need for federal approval after the trip had taken place.""

In rock music there are literally more than 50 sub-genres. Why can't hip hop just accept that as an art form, it is going to evolve; some variations are going to be good, some are going to be garbage.

To say that because its an art form it HAS TO follow the original ideas is just stupid.

To me, the real danger with this variation of hip hop is that it can become the *dominant* style. Then, it has the potential of becoming the most influential style for future styles which dilute the art form and make it even worse.

1004,"&gt; The mujahideen were definitely regarded as a terrorgroup at the time, the US just refused to recognize them as such at the time.

I am in not any way shape or form defending the fact that the US funded and supported them.

If you think that was the extent of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, you need to read a little history. Actually, quite a bit of history

US connection to Islamic terror groups (and they were NOT viewed as ""terror"" groups when the US started funding them ) started long after Soviet involvement.

Its more complicated than you think.

I suspect that because you don't like him for what happens outside the cage, that you are going to say negative things about him as a fighter. 

I also suspect that despite you describing his performances as ""horrifically disappointing"" you have watched A LOT of his fights and will continue to watch every single one of his fights. Why bother watching him if he is so terrible? Personally, i don't waste my time watching boring fighters.

How could you possibly say you watched the whole series and say this? 2 entire episodes focused on this.

&gt;You make documentaries about Hitler or Stalin to educate people about history

A good portion of the series focused on the history of race in the U.S. from the 60's to the 90's. *No matter what your views*, race is a part of American history.

I have not seen one single person on this thread ""defending"" OJ. Could you show me responses where people are actually doing this? I think the gen consensus is that it is a well made documentary.

In my opinion, I would suggest a few of these to get you started.

I am convinced that that brings up emotions for DC.... At that event a few days ago, It looked like DC was going to literally cry.This isn't to suggest that DC is scared of Jones, but that childhood shit stays with a lot of people.

2409,"If you have the freedom and means to go 2-3 weeks there is no way you should even consider going for just 10 days. There are an infinite number of things to explore, see and do. Japan is probably one of those destinations that disappoint very, very few travelers - it really is a special place. I loved it so much that before the trip was even over, i started seriously thinking about going back a second time the following year (but ended up going to Myanmar)

One thing i would strongly suggest is that you get a JR rail pass (which has to be bought before you get there). If you stay 2+ weeks, you can cover A LOT of ground with their super efficient rail system. While there, I spent the majority of my time in Tokyo and Kyoto with side trips to Nara, Kamakura and Hiroshima.

Personally, I'm no fan of the kid, but I have nothing against him either and I actually hope he bounces back from this and gets better. The attention the UFC is putting on him is no fault of his own - they are a business and they see him as a marketable product that they can push onto the public. He's young, he has an appealing (to some) look, he's super athletic, and despite his loss last night the kid does have skills. Will this translate into him becoming a great fighter? Who knows, but the UFC is willing to take their chances on the kid. 

Compare him to someone like Ferguson - the guy is clearly skilled but the fact is, he's fucking ugly, he's not particularly likable, he pulled that grimy shit on TUF and he comes off like an asshole in his interviews.

* 3) Folks there are INCREDIBLY polite towards me. I'm a Puerto Rican man born in the US and I had no issues whatsoever. The degree of politeness is so mind blowing that a few times i had to suppress an urge to laugh only because it didn't seem real. That isn't to say that it seemed fake at all, but rather that its just that i have never encountered so polite a culture as I did in Japan. It is pretty common knowledge that there is a xenophobia issue there, but i just did not experience that at all except for one time some man was giving me seriously dirty looks in an Onsen. Normally, I would ignore bs like that, but for some reason, it really annoyed me so, I stared right back at him with my best ""what the fuck are you staring at me for"" look, and naturally, he backed down and stopped looking at me.

What i suggest doing is just have a small bag ready of whatever you need to bring upstairs for the time you are there.

Try to stick to the instructions on how to find the hotel once you get to Ueno station. The stations in Tokyo are **absolutely massive** and in some cases, if you get out of the wrong exit you can end up more than 10 blocks away from where you are trying to go.

The comment about the baths was a poorly written sentence on my part. What i meant was that when i would wake up, i would go to the baths in the hotel and at the end of a day of walking around and exploring the city, i would go back to the baths again in the hotel to wash up and unwind. 

The public bath or *Sentō* in that hotel included a sauna, washing area, cold dipping pool and an indoor [Onsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen). Patrons also had access to massage and a big room with individual reclining chairs with individual televisions. The baths are very traditional and just a cool way to experience some Japanese culture. I fucking loved it and took advantage of it every single day.

I was in Japan a few years back and i stayed here for about 4 days while in Tokyo. Its reasonably priced and easy to get to but what may be the best thing about it are the baths. YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST CHECK THEM OUT if you stay there. I started and ended every day of exploring Tokyo in the baths and it was amazing, relaxing and rejuvenating. 

I reviewed this hotel on that site and it should be noted that  the directions in the booking email don’t really give good directions. The best way to find it is to take the Iriya exit in the Ueno station. If you don’t, you will end up very far away from the hotel. When you go through the turnstiles don’t go left down a long hallway, instead, go straight where you will see some stairs leading outside. Make another left going down til you hit the street. At the base of the stairs, you should be standing right in front of a very narrow street – cross this, walk one block and make your first left. The hotel is about ¾ of a block in on the left side. The building has a red brick front. Its super convenient location wise from the station once you figure it out.

On top of that, Conor is just to big and too skilled which adds to that equation. He needs to go up in weight and i think his fights will be much more competitive.

And how exactly is Aldo a stylistic nightmare for Conor? I think a stylistic nightmare for him would be someone who can take him down, keep him down and grind out a win. If Nurmagomedov didn't shatter a bone everytime he picked up a fucking pencil, he would absolutely dominate Conor. I also think that when he goes up in weight, he will lose the reach advantage he has over most in the FW division.

I'll have to admit that trying to imagine what you looked like trying to go back and forth made me laugh. 

Anyway, don't be discouraged. NO ONE starts off sounding decent, let alone great when they start to play in front of other people. Every now and then when i come across an old recording i made playing, i want to fucking CRINGE. When i first started to play out I FUCKING SUCKED, but you know what? that didn't matter because i loved just having that fucking guitar in my hand and working and searching and experimenting and having fun. 

It sounds like music has totally captured your heart like it did mine. Having that is what will make you eventually become good. What is important to remember is that you have to find your own voice. Its good to admire other great players, but unless you are just interested in being in a cover band, work on your own signature. 

Be patient.

Practice every day... if this is not possible, set aside a short time as many times a week you can for FOCUSED PRACTICING rather than 4 hours on a saturday and nothing for another whole week.

Take lessons. Finding a good teacher will help you immensely and prevent you from developing bad habits that once they are ingrained, are hard to get rid of. If money is an issue, instead of going weekly, go once a month.

If possible, try to play/jam with people that are better than you as much as you can

Years from now, your memory of your story from above will make you laugh too. Or maybe it will make you cringe!

He literally did a swan dive right into one of the most dangerous BJJ guards on the planet. The instant he did that shit, i KNEW he was in big fucking trouble. That shit worked against Big Nog, but that was when Fedor was at the height of his powers.

Kickboxing is not MMA. And LOL if you think beating Ishii 2x is impressive. I still don't call that a ""comeback"" And let me add that i loved Crocop in the PRIDE days, so i'm not just knocking the guy.

""Rewatch that fight""???!! Both Bigfoot and Fedor were gassing. In the 2nd and final round, Bigfoot was on top position and beating the shit out of Fedor for most of it. In what universe was there ANY indication that Fedor was about to knock him out? Seriously dude - YOU need to watch that shit again.

Fedor had a terrible strategy against Henderson. Had he focused on grappling, he probably would have won. Personally, he did not look good to me because didn't fight smart in the matchup.

Back in the day, Fedor WAS a ""savage killer"" but seriously - how long has it been since he really dominated and beat a top 10 dude?

* Anderson Silva fans need to accept that Weidman just had his number. It wasn't luck. This is coming from a MASSIVE Silva fan
* Brock Lesnar was an overhyped gorilla 
* To me, McGregor is the Adrien Broner/Floyd Mayweather of MMA in the sense that he is so over the top, with the flaunting of his money and the hyping bullshit. I ""get"" what he is doing but I find it funny that folks hate those two for the exact same reason they love Conor
* Unless you are under 13 years old, or slightly retarded, no one should be watching WWE
* I have always hated DC and its nice to see that over the last year or so, more folks have joined the club. Anytime he opens his mouth or tries to hype a fight, i cringe
*I don't know how Mike Goldberg still has a job
*I think Cerrone is a good fighter, but there is something about him that makes me think he is probably a closet racist. (And please don't tell me ""but he trains with black guys"" - that is equivalent to saying you have a black friend, so you cannot possibly be racist)
*Ryan Bader is a fucking meathead that has no chance in hell against DC
*Ronda has undeniable skills, but her fights are so predictable that there is almost no point in watching them. Now Joanna Jedrzejczyk on the other hand....
