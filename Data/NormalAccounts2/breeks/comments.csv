135,"That's the thing about football; you're judged on results at the end of the season not on what *should* have happened based on people's preconceptions of signings in the preceding August. 

The fact that it didn't work out **is** bad judgement; when you're the manager of a top flight side when you bring in a marquee player and he doesn't perform then that is on you and you alone. You're being paid a fortune and entrusted with a fuck tonne of cash to make sure that the players you bring in don't flop and in that LvG failed. Compound that with the fact that a reported £16million loss was made on di Maria then I don't see how you can say the transfer was anything other than bad judgment? 

Sure, di Maria may have contributed to his exit by being a petulant little bitch and he may have hated living in England but that's the nature of the game these days. In the modern game a lot more has to go in to scouting a transfer than their playing ability - *especially* - when you are paying £60million for your marquee signing.

Re: Falcao - I find it ludicrous that Manchester United fans can write off ~£15million as a ""gamble"". Other teams would *love* to have £15million lying around for a ""gamble"". He literally cost you just under £4million per goal for christ's sake.

152,"I'm sorry but I'm not familiar with the terms IMG and PGY.

Of the UK doctors that go to Aus or NZ many will go following their FY1 and FY2 years: these are the 2 years immediately following graduating. Often, they will go only for a year; you are not in any official training scheme but it is seen as an opportunity to gain more experience and enhance your CV before applying for higher specialty training as well as getting to experience life in another country. By no means does every UK graduate do this but there is a strong precedent for doing so and getting a job - for a year - shouldn't be too difficult if you put your mind to it.

Some doctors may wish to emigrate permanently, however, the ease of doing so is dependent on what stage of training you are currently at. I haven't looked in to this fully but I imagine it may be something like: if you are a consultant in a specialty where there is a shortage of doctors you may be actively recruited to emigrate. However, if you are looking to get into specialty training then I suspect it may be harder as you will be competing against graduates from the actual countries and you may only be eligible for jobs that are not filled by Aus/NZ nationals.",2015-07-16 22:26:59+00:00,ct5wqqy,6,t1_ct5vzc5,1259,medicine
