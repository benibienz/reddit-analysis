* underestimating how many bits of code a feature touches /has to touch. Something conceptually small may have much larger implications as far as implementation. This could be the case with a small change that requires an end to end change.
* underestimating the logic of a feature. Just because the initial concept seems easy, one off scenarios for the logic behind code can easily build up and cause complexity. 
* underestimating the refactoring of code. If you want to add a new feature to something existing, sometimes you realize that refactoring of old code is needed, which could cause the previous two issues.

The gist of all these is basically unless you have the entire codebase memorized, it's hard to say with certainty how long some features will take",2016-10-05 05:25:06+00:00,d8eo8dm,3.0,t1_d8enyks,586.0,webdev

Or, in say angular, you can request that info ONCE in a factory, and then use it everywhere else in the app at your leisure. It's kind of hard to come up with tons of examples off the top of my head as to why it's easier in the long run, but I'd say trust the general consensus of frameworks: they're awesome.

I don't have a degree in CS, I took two courses in school. No, you don't need to memorize algorithms for most front end jobs.

272,"A more specific solution is already occurring. The biggest companies in the world are energy companies. They are aware of something called Hubbert's Peak. Hubbert was a guy that predicted to the year, when oil would move from being massively exported in the US, to imported. Now, importation basically means ""we are making less than we need"". Exportation is the opposite, obviously. Anyway he predicted this at a time that it was crazy to think this. And he nailed it to the year. Evebtually, the entire world will stop being a world exporter of oil. We will eventually start using more than we can actually make. The truth is we will never run out of oil, virtually. Instead, it will simply become to much of a cost burden to find it. This is when climate change gets solved. A renewable energy source will fill the gap of oil (and coal and others yada yada) if and only if, it becomes a cheaper alternative. Every energy company thinks that we are about 15-25 years away from Hubbert's peak globally. And that's why the energy companies are the single largest investors in solving renewable energy, somethinh the left hates to ever even acknowledge. So the final sum is: energy is getting more expensive, we need to make something that eventually will be a cheaper source. Indirectly, this stops the effects of climate change, and removes any symptoms within like 100 years. As soon as I read about this, I on the spot stopped worrying about CC.",2016-07-23 19:25:55+00:00,d5nwwkn,8.0,t1_d5nwl20,545.0,The_Donald

They're told they need to act a certain way that isn't in line with how they think they should act. White men are a good example but there's more. 

White guys have been told for years now that they are the worst thing to ever happen to America. They've been told they can't say anything bad about any minority for fear of being called a racist. They've been told they can't approach women for fear of it being called sexual harassment. They've been told that their meer existence causes oppression to minorities. They've been told that their childhood tendencies of playing and getting into fights with other kids is abhorrent and cannot be condoned. They've been told that they shouldn't have the same chance to get to college because they were born with ""privilege"". They've been told that even if they do end up successful, that the credit does not go to their hard work, but just to the system since they're a beneficiary of them. On a political point, they've been told wanting to keep out people they don't trust in order to protect their families is bigoted. They've been told that manufacturing jobs are never coming back to this country. They've been told that not wanting to pander to minorities and instead judging people on their merit is racist. They're told that when people commit crimes it's the police force and the white racist men that make it up that are to blame for it. Just thing after thing and the voters are sick of it. 

Trump capitalized on this beautifully but I don't think he knew how much he could gain by acting like himself. He basically came out and said about all that stuff above ""fuck it, our country is shitty right now, and you people have right idea"". And liberals are still just trying to attack us without actually stopping and thinking ""hmm, *why* do all these people think this, and do they have a point""? The examples I gave were for white guys but similar things apply to every group. Women are sick of other women who are fat and unhappy telling them how they should live their lives, they see Trump as an admirable man to follow. Black republicans are sick of being told they're uncle toms just because they want to work hard and get jobs back in the US. All the tension and dividing is on the democratic side. 

Race was never an issue on the republican side. You had Ben Carson, the black esteemed neurosurgeon standing next to two Hispanic guys and a white billionaire, all running for president, and they really never pandered to the races (well, possibly here and there but it was very very scarce). They were just guys on their platforms talking about what they each thought they could help the country. Meanwhile, on the democratic circuit, every debate and rally and speech is about racial tensions and sexism and bigotry, and just talking to one of these groups at a time. And people are just getting sick of it.

If it was good enough / that person had enough drive, the could do something with it, but for the most part people with terrible ideas would be told they were terrible. Now, people with terrible ideas can find those other people with terrible ideas, and then think it's legitimate because other randoms online think so. A good example is healthy at every size. Bullying fat kids, while not the best or most polite thing to do, does prevent people from wanting to gain weight because of fear of ridicule, and sometimes gets the bullied kid to lose weight too. Because guess what, being fat is bad. But because the Internet allows such open discourse, which is great and I don't want that going away in any way, a downside is that fat people think that because other far people agree with them, that it's totally okay to be fat.",2016-05-08 01:00:00+00:00,d2wxwip,2.0,t1_d2wv6zh,5167.0,The_Donald

668,"Here's my explanation I give people:


I'm going to sort of high jack this to add. There's this thing called Hubbert's peak. Hubbert was a guy who predicted down to the year, when exactly the United States would become a net importer of oil, rather than exporter. He was laughed out of the room at first, because people thought that the US would never run out of oil. They were right. But our consumption needs outpaced our production rates, and eventually we were shipping in Saudi oil. That is why every oil company takes into consideration Hubbert's peak now. Most oil and energy analysts expect that Hubbert's peak will hit in the next 10 years or so for global production. We, as a planet, will out pace our energy needs of production of oil. So at that point oil will start getting more and more expensive. Eventually, it will become more expensive to produce oil, than whatever energy is going to be next. At that point, everyone will abandon oil, and jump on the new thing (this applies for all other fossil fuels as well). Now, why is this important? Because it means carbon emissions aren't going to be an issue forever rising, and will only be a problem for the next few decades. Every energy company on the planet knows all this. That's why they are the biggest investors in energy research. They all want to find out what comes next, and how they can make a profit from it faster than anyone else. This is where liberals who want to end climate change should fix their attention, but they don't. They focus on emissions ratings and dropping them down to levels that might not be sustainable for the auto industry, the oil companies, etc. Doing that is admirable, but it is more important to focus attention on the next energy source rather than just demonizing oil. Now, for the effects of our carbon emissions. All I ever here is how the planet is doomed, how everyone is going to die from carbon emissions. Well, wrong. I'm not saying climate change isn't real. But I am saying the effects of it are radicalized in order to garner environmental support. Ten years ago, I remember hearing how sea levels would rise so a much feet. They were totally off. I was told the polar ice caps would be melting at an increasing rate. The eastern Antarctic ice sheet has actually grown. The one thing that has been effected is the weather, but not nearly as bad as projected. And with the residual effects of climate change estimated to last another 100 years, climate change becomes a minor inconvenience for a bit. Nothing planet ending. The free market will end up fixing climate change, not unsustainably strict control over emissions. We know it's an issue. Fixing the source rather than the symptom is what will fix our issue

Hubbert was a guy who predicted down to the year, when exactly the United States would become a net importer of oil, rather than exporter. He was laughed out of the room at first, because people thought that the US would never run out of oil. They were right. But our consumption needs outpaced our production rates, and eventually we were shipping in Saudi oil. That is why every oil company takes into consideration Hubbert's peak now. Most oil and energy analysts expect that Hubbert's peak will hit in the next 10 years or so for **global production**. We, as a planet, will out pace our energy needs of production of oil. So at that point oil will start getting more and more expensive. Eventually, it will become more expensive to produce oil, than whatever energy is going to be next. At that point, everyone will abandon oil, and jump on the new thing (this applies for all other fossil fuels as well). Now, why is this important? Because it means carbon emissions aren't going to be an issue forever rising, and will only be a problem for the next few decades. Every energy company on the planet knows all this. That's why they are the biggest investors in energy research. They all want to find out what comes next, and how they can make a profit from it faster than anyone else. This is where liberals who want to end climate change should fix their attention, but they don't. They focus on emissions ratings and dropping them down to levels that might not be sustainable for the auto industry, the oil companies, etc. Doing that is admirable, but it is more important to focus attention on the next energy source rather than just demonizing oil. Now, for the effects of our carbon emissions. All I ever here is how the planet is doomed, how everyone is going to die from carbon emissions. Well, wrong. I'm not saying climate change isn't real. But I am saying the effects of it are radicalized in order to garner environmental support. Ten years ago, I remember hearing how sea levels would rise so a much feet. They were totally off. I was told the polar ice caps would be melting at an increasing rate. The eastern Antarctic ice sheet has actually grown. The one thing that has been effected is the weather, but not nearly as bad as projected. And with the residual effects of climate change estimated to last another 100 years, climate change becomes a minor inconvenience for a bit. Nothing planet ending. The free market will end up fixing climate change, not unsustainably strict control over emissions. We know it's an issue. Fixing the source rather than the symptom is what will fix our issue",2016-04-23 00:22:46+00:00,d2dr3cy,1.0,t3_4g16xg,1415.0,AskBernieSupporters

1000,"I'm telling you that while climate scientists have overestimated the impact of global warming (which they have), the guy who predicted oil exportation for the US got it nailed to the year, and it's predicted to hit Hubbert's peak again in 10-20 years. The free market, oil companies, none of them are against the environment. They're pro money. The market will determine oil prices based on ability to maintain currently global exportation levels, along with the ability to actually get oil. See we'll never run out of oil. It would take hundreds and hundreds of years to actually find every drop of oil and have it run out like the left says. The problem is that we'd have to find more and more oil, which is unsustainable, or will be in about 10 years. It will then start falling in value, until it crosses with whatever our next Energy source will be, and since pretty much every one is clean, that means less carbon emissions. Another 50 years after that, it's possible we'll have stable fusion on a wide scale, so we're basically set for life at that point. Now you said the market won't save us. Im telling you, there's nothing to be saved from. I'm not saying global warming isn't a problem. It is. But it's not a doomsday sentence. It's more of a mild inconvenience with more extreme weather for the next few decades. If we switch to sustainable energy in the next few decades (as Hubbert and energy analysts suggest we will), then the residual effects will last maybe another hundred years, which for environmental effects is not a long time at all.

I'm not saying that christians in the past did no wrong, but I will say that overall it was much much more of a boon to society than a hindrance.

Free market increases competition and lowers prices, gives citizens more options to have as far as providers, specialists. The exception that I think most people can get behind is there being a fund for those who can't afford healthcare, in order to prevent them from dying on the streets. Socialism, which this really isn't but whatever that was your point, might work for emergencies like that. I mean, we have socialist fire departments and police forces then, and sure maybe evens socialist military. But the same people that say we should have socialized healthcare also say we spend too much on the military. healthcare being socialized would only add to our spending, like crazy. Back to healthcare, before you say ""healthcare is an emergency situation too!"", there's plenty of doctors visits that are routine. I want the option to deal with those as a free market, where I pick the cheapest best option for myself. If you think healthcare is a ""right"", let me ask you this. Would you consider food to be a right? It's obviously more of a right than healthcare, you need it more regularly in order to live. But what if we had socialized food. We would have places that offered food, and people would go and get it for 'free'. Well, how would that food be paid for? The company that sells the food would foot the bill to the government. This is where the capitalist system does a much better job. If the guy buying the food isn't the same as the guy paying for the food, the company selling the food can bill the government whatever they want, and then that bill, much higher than it should be, gets passed to the tax payer. The same thing applies to healthcare, it's what's happening right now.

For example in tech listings, they will be required to list a job, but will do so at 50% what a competitive wage would be. It's not being used to find people for positions that won't be filled, it's being used to undercut American wages. The only case in which I think that migrant workers should be allowed with little surpervision is agricultural industry, where the US gives unlimited work visas to those that want to work in the US farming industry. But companies already get around that as well by just willing hiring illegal immigrants at a much lower than competitive price. Americans should be hired in America first.

EDIT: Also, it's not really like sit down and watch the whole thing through, it's more like you watch chunks multiple times, adding up to a time editing that is usually longer than the video. A let's play style video where the person editing is familiar with what's happening because they recorded it, and it's just their source (like rage quit) can easily be done quickly. It can even be as easy as just remembering where you said some funny stuff, and cutting any dead air bits.

&gt;INTENT REQUIREMENT


&gt;Intent is a required element of a simple battery charge.  To constitute a crime, there must be “either a specific voluntary act or something that is substantially certain to result from the act.” C.B. v. State, 810 So.2d 1072 (Fla. 4th DCA 2002). A defendant must intend to strike the person, or engage in conduct where he or she knows that a touch or strike “is substantially certain to result from his acts.” Id.

&gt;Thus, an accidental touching or a touching that is incidental to other conduct not aimed at making contact with another person, is insufficient to establish a battery. Beard v. State, 842 So.2d 174, 176-77 (Fla. 2d DCA 2003). Whether the accused had the requisite intent is a question for the jury to resolve by examining the surrounding facts and circumstances of the incident.

As I stated before, people can protest all they want, we just laugh at them. When protestors outside the event got violent, that's where the problems happened.

1446,"I was comparing Obama responding to the way that everyone attacked Trump on his protests. If we're the one that forgot the right to protest peacefully, why was the chicago protest the only violent example in this campaign, and by far the largest in recent years. And why did Obama sign an executive forbidding protests at events maintained by the Secret Service. No one here gave a fuck about protestors until they became violent. We would just laugh at them. 

The comparison of sending a message and not being responsible for the consequence *is* relatable. The media has been calling Trump a racist hate-mongerer comparable to Hitler. Is it any surprise people rioted against him in Chicago?

The riots were far and away caused by the media's portrayal of Trump, not because Trump said some people who were roughly disrupting his rallies should be hit for being retarded. The signs people had at the protest weren't ""let's not hit people"", they were ""trump is hitler"", ""Trump is a fascist"". 

And if saying something means it's appropriate to respond violently, which is stupid since saying something doesn't make you responsible for other people's actions, then why is it that like only 5 Trump supporters have ever been caught being violent, while there were dozens of instances of Bernie Supporters and BLM supporters engaging in violence in Chicago? Did these leftists just suddenly *decide* to listen to Trump on this one issue? Or is it more likely that the widespread portrayal of Trump caused people to think he's something he's not, and think they should respond radically.

This is where I say the fault lies with Obama. He perpetrated the myths that the police were doing something evil. That they were the bad guys. All that did was cause more tension and violence. He did the same thing the media is doing now, which is painting people as the bad guy for doing nothing wrong. The police did nothing wrong in trying to maintain rioters. Trump supporters did nothing wrong in trying to go to a rally for their candidate. Yet both instances ended in the opposition being violent.

The truth is that the left is more radical, violent, and hurtful to freedom of speech and right to protest than the right.",2016-03-15 19:17:43+00:00,d10yu0p,13.0,t1_d10xraf,1425.0,The_Donald

1567,"I don't give a fuck if your'e a racial anthropologist. If you say that race doesn't exist in this day and age, you're wrong. How is it racist to say that people are different? We are. The only way to actually have peace is to mend cultural wounds by accepting differences, rather than perpetrating a forced diversity. You mentioned a muslim community in Asia. The reason that communities like muslims in india don't hate us is because they are also a minority in india. Muslims in india get along with christians there just fine, because they are both religious minorities. We have drugs in this country largely due to influx from mexico, and central america. A big wall would put a damper in that. Unemployment isn't helped by illegal immigration. If all of those illegal immigrants were legal, no one would care about this. But they're shirking the system. Whites and blacks might take drugs at the same rate, idk I'm not going to look it up but I'll believe you. But black people also commit a disproportionate amount of gun violence in America. That's not racism, that is a fact. I'm more interested in trying and figuring out what the problem affecting communities that have issues rather than pretending everyone is being treated equally. If you're going to apologize for events that took place hundreds of years ago, that's your business. I'm well educated, have read Howard Zinn including that book, and what I'm telling you is that race is still a very real issue in this country.

He is, in my opinion, the most equality driven politician in that he thinks people should be determined by what they do, not who they are. He isn't racist. [Saying a fact is not racist, despite what you've been brought up to believe](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/year_end_2015_enforcement_report.pdf). The notion of transphobia suggests a wanton fear and aggression against trans people. The fact that he didn't use the correct pronouns doesn't mean he hates trans people. Frankly, he probably doesn't care. But the infatuation of the left bringing this up as a presidential talking point is ludicrous in itself. He didn't say a woman was disgusting for breastfeeding, he said it was unprofessional and disgusting to use a breastfeeding pump while being deposed by a lawyer. Quite frankly, I think that is more than reasonable. Going back to racism, he holds people to the standards of war they say and do not who they are. He hired many female executives for His companies back in the 70s, when it was very progressive to so. Attacking Hillary for not being able to satisfy her husband is not an attack on all women. And bill has been accused of numerous sexual assaults, so if anything she may have abetted abuse, not been the victim of it. I don't know the quote on the military and I won't trust it until I hear it come from his mouth in context. I'm personally for gay marriage but again, this notion that he's homophobic for disagreeing on a controversial issue is an attack on free speech, suggesting that any other world view is sham worthy. But, he was for civil unions all the way back in 2000, way before Hillary was for it, and has said that he wants it to be a state issue rather than a federal one.

2071,"Let me preface that while I'm not an expert on specific encryption techniques used by Apple, I am a developer who has built an encryption engine in the past, so I at least feel somewhat better prepared than most to talk about this. So apple uses an encryption technique for the information on their phone. This encryption basically scrambles the information in a specific, but ""secret"" way. While most modern encryption techniques are virtually impossible break by sheer brute force (since it would take too long) they can be broken once you know how the encryption is taking place, and have access to certain keys being used (if it's a cipher encryption which I'm really not certain about). So Apple is claiming they don't want to show the family secret as it were, because it could potentially cause insecurity in other phones. Now, apples not stupid. They didn't build a vault that they themselves can't break. Regardless of the fact that they probably (again, not certain) can update their encryption methods by patching, or even just changing keys, should be enough to say that Apple is kind of full of it and is acting the rebel whe they don't really have reason too. And to hammer this home, Apple has done exactly what the FBI is requesting like 70 times before. But this time, it's a marketing ploy. So now, the FBI is saying ""okay, fine, don't give us the keys to the vault. But can you make it so that the vault won't explode when we try to break into it?"" (Basically saying can you remove the auto erase function on it). This, while it would take much longer because it would essentially be a modified brute force, would not infringe on the general security of Apple or iOS, but instead just the security of that one phone. But Apple is still standing their ground, and the only sound reason to do such a thing is because it's a marketing ploy. This isn't a privacy issue, it's a terrorist one, and while I was on apples side before researching more, and privacy in technology is very important to me, it's a non issue that Apple is spinning to gain attention.

EDIT: to avoid confusion, the FBI wants to do a brute force technique on the password of the phone, rather than the key to the encryption. It's basically like instead of breaking in from the back of the vault, they'll just try the knob on the front again and again until it works, which will take far less time than if they were to try and solve the encryption.",2016-02-28 18:17:17+00:00,d0h2v4g,1.0,t3_484aul,1509.0,AskTrumpSupporters

2079,"1) he's anti illegal immigration, anti war, and want to bring jobs like manufacturing back to America. He's a nationalist. [Here are some of his positions but you're better off hearing him speak to know what he's about](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions)

2) literally no one has experience to be president of the US. The president who's leaving always leaves a note in the Oval Office for the next president giving some advice because literally no one is prepared. But as far as politicians go, being a senator is not a ton of experience. You basically show up and vote, maybe you write up and propose some stuff. Trump was the leader of a multi billion dollar company. There's politics that comes with that. He's used to being an executive.

3)He has no reason to be running other than the desire to make America great again. Just because he's a business man doesn't mean he has anterior motives and is shady. He's literally doing it all on his own. And his business is real estate, so he's basically tied to the US even with his business

3) he's not racist. Islam is a religion, that happens to not like us very much. It's not a race. Mexico is a country, not a race. Both groups are causing issues and he's proposed drastic but doable solutions. We've banned people from the Middle East numerous times. Eisenhower deported millions of illegal immigrants. Israel has a big wall. Hungary has a big wall and their illegal immigration basically dropped to 0. So despite what the media is telling you, these things have been done before.

5) the GOP is basically figuring out who is going to be the savior of their party right now. They've had it rough, with people hating them for awhile and all. So if Trump gets elected and the senate / congress doesn't side with him while the republicans are in power, it'll be the end of republicans.

Older music was more about enjoying it *with* people, since a lot of times people didn't have records but their friends would. I'm not saying that new music or old music is better, but the attitude towards it certainly has.

So let's brush aside the fact that those share holders are people with 401ks, IRAs, and other savings. Let's move on from the fact that evil insurance companies are employing thousands, and actually doing a public service for (gasp) a profit. What drives prices down is competition. Insurance companies competing to give the best product to consumers for the cheapest amount. Obamacare fucks with that entirely. Less choice for consumers means higher prices. Now talking about other countries. The comparison doesn't work because our poverty levels are not even close to any country you could compare our healthcare to.

2173,"Here's the problem I have with using what's consider offensive language, and PC language. It literally is just words. The meaning is something that changes over time. The sentiment will always be the same regardless of what word you use. Like, I won't go around saying someone is a horrible person for being gay, but I'll drop gay here and there just because it's what I grew up saying. I know it's not particularly correct but it's just the word. The origin has so little to do with it now. We say we got gypped on a deal and that's making fun of gypsies. Retarded used to be a more correct term, I think it replaced slow, then we had special, and now even that is considered non-PC i think. Differently-abled is the ""correct"" term now. My grandmother even talked about how it's crazy how the words for black people have changed. When she was growing up, black was considered offensive, or at the very least not very polite. Colored was considered more courteous. But say that now and you'll get racist thrown at you. The point is that the left will never be able to police every ""offensive"" word. There's just going to be more that people make up. I mean, cuck is a good example of a word that we use but hasn't caught on with the mainstream left enough for them to say how horrible and non PC it is, for those people in poly-amorous relationships (lol).

2296,"Alright, this is gonna get hate here, but I just saw the movie and wanted to post my thoughts

To start, I want to say I’ve been a fan of Rooster Teeth from Season 1 of RvB, but fell off watching a lot of their stuff maybe 2 years ago. I’m in my early 20s now, so that’s a pretty big chunk of time that I watched their stuff.  I saw the campaign for their movie, and donated $150 to it. I figured these guys made me laugh for a long time and the least I could do was give them some money, a decent amount I thought for a movie. I want to point out that I’m not bitter about giving money and being disappointed. I kind of forgot about it until recently, so I really had no expectations going in. 

Here’s my opinion. It’s not good. It’s bad. I feel bad saying that because I like the guys, but after not seeing a lot of their stuff for awhile and then seeing this, I was disappointed. A lot of people are giving the defense (from my quick scanning of views online) that it’s “quirky”, or a “charming B movie”. I don’t think so, I think it’s just bad. But just saying it’s bad isn’t really constructive. As far as I remember, these guys are funny. I figure they could make a good movie, and while this one is not it, that doesn’t mean that if they made one in the future it would be bad too. So let me break down my criticism.

**Acting** - To start off, I know that these guys aren’t all professional actors. I get that, but they’re also starring in the movie for fan service. And the acting isn’t great. It is wooden most of the time and pretty unbearable at others. There isn’t a lot of consistency to the acting level either. In some scenes, they act like they are reading from the script for the first time, and in others, its much more casual, almost apparent things are being ad-libbed. I think this lack of consistency is pretty odd, and not great. The one person I think who actually did a good job acting was Michael. He is consistent throughout the movie. His (along with many other’s) character is one dimensional, but he doesn’t falter from scene to scene with his acting. The closest thing I can compare his performance too would be something out of Superbad. It isn’t “traditional”, but as a result it is at least more natural. Also, I have no idea why they decided to make Gavin have an American accent when he can’t do it correctly. So, I’d give it a 3/10 for acting.

**Plot** - I think that this is one of the most immediate issues with Lazer Team. The plot is not meant for an independent movie. As soon as they decided that this was the film that they wanted to shoot, I think they were pretty much doomed to sub-mediocrity. I saw that Burnie made the point that comedy sci-fi was what they had done in the past, so they wanted to focus on their strong suit. But when they did comedy sci-fi in the past, all of the effects were already done for them. The thing that I think people really loved about RvB was that it was the comedy writing that shone through, not the plot driving it forward. I also get that they have a studio ready to do special effects and cgi for shorts and things like that. But it is not a production-level effects department. We’ve been so accustomed to amazing effects that it is hard to go back and see subpar ones and move past it. And sci-fi is a genre that is obviously riddled with special effects. I imagine that a big chunk of the time was spent on effects, and unfortunately, it doesn’t really show. Sci-fi with large effects shouldn’t be left up to independent films unless they know the limitations and work around those accordingly.

A good example I can think of is the film Monsters, about these giant alien monsters that are wreaking havoc in Mexico. It is a great film, that works around its own limitations by having the plot work around hiding from the monsters, rather than showing them all the time. Think Jaws. 

I think that they would have been much better off focusing on a film that is entirely writing focused. They’re funny guys. They can write funny interactions. Something closer to a Judd Apatow movie (which I’m not a huge fan of but whatever) would have served them better. Hell, it could have been set on a spaceship or a sci-fi setting, but focus on the interactions rather than the “boom” “wow” special effects that they tried to pull off. 

Besides biting off more than they could chew, I thought the plot was presented not well at all.  It was rushed through so quickly, with absolutely no set up at all. The setup for the movie was pretty much the lines of text at the beginning. 

I’d give the plot a 2 / 10

**Cinematography** - Unfortunately, cinematography wasn’t great either. There were many, many, uncomfortable shots, that were too close to the characters, or framed incorrectly. There was also way too much motion in the camera. Every time a static shot would’ve been fine, they decided to have a pan, or a pull, and every time an action sequence was shown, the camera work was way over the top. 

For lighting, I think that it looks pretty good. If you look at stills from the movie, it is pretty high quality. They give a fairly good feel to the tone of the movie. It’s lit somewhat seriously which I think mimics the fact that these guys are supposed to be a “serious” situation. That being said, they need to tone down the lens flares. Oh boy did they go J.J. Abrams. Rewatch the football scene to see what I mean.

There are also way too many cuts when dialogue is going on. Back forth, back forth. I think that most of the cuts they made should’ve been about half a second longer on average. it was too jostling to watch at times. The depth of feel was also a bit much at times. It did give more of a cinematic feel, but having things be so out of focus at times was unrealistic and jarring.

Overall, I think that the cinematography could’ve been improved immensely by simply being more subtle about it. If they did a lot less, it would’ve shown so much more. Sometimes, restraint can convey the story you want to tell so much better. 

I’d give the cinematography a 5.5 / 10, since a lot of what I criticized can be boiled down to artistic license, and like I said, it looked professional.

**Total Review** - Overall, I’d give it a 3 or 4 / 10. I feel bad giving such a low score but really, I think that’s what it deserves. It could have been so much better if they did a lot less. If they did a beautifully shot, but very funny movie, without the crazy sci-fi plot, without the bad cgi, and with only professional actors, I think that they could have made something that would’ve been considered a cult hit to people outside of Rooster Teeth. Imagine if they took all the budget spent on effects, settings, and extras, and instead just focused on comedy writing in some fairly easy setting. Hell, if it had writing like RvB Season 1, a simple Highschool movie could’ve been great. Instead, they bit off more than they could chew, tried to do way too much with it, and reached beyond their grasp. 

**Closing**- I want to close with this. It’s something I remember thinking about when I was younger. I think that Rooster Teeth doesn’t understand what their fans watch them for. I think they’ve gotten better at identifying why they are popular, but I don’t think they’ve fully grasped it yet. I haven’t watched them for a while like I said, but I at least have a gist of what they have been doing. They are personalities. Everyone on screen for their various productions is a personality. I would watch their stuff for them, more so than the actual content of what I was watching. I think that they see themselves as filmmakers. I’m not saying they aren’t. They made a movie that I certainly would not have been able to. They’ve done tons of shorts. But that’s not what made them famous. They became famous because RvB, and other works, gave off the aura of humor between friends, a band of buddies that could make people laugh just by them being themselves. I don’t think that translates well into complex storytelling. Look back at Season 1 of shorts and tell me I’m wrong. Unfortunately, that’s a hard thing to break free from, and I imagine it can be frustrating. Wanting to make movies while you are famous for something else is hard (like Paris Hilton trying to be a music star hard). 

But I think that they would have better success at it if they removed themselves from their movie equation all together. What do I mean by that? Well, if they simply wrote a movie, and shot it, without it being focused on being about Rooster Teeth, I think they would be able to have the support of their clearly loyal audience, and be able to branch out into even more mainstream ones.
Anyway, I didn’t like the movie but I still hope that they try and do more, since I think they have the potential to be much better than what they’ve shown.",2016-02-12 01:32:44+00:00,czwrnqv,1.0,t3_451i2a,153316.0,roosterteeth

But make no mistake, the reason that ISIS is going with the attacks it has so far is because of our strict policies, both in the US and European countries.",2016-02-03 19:53:48+00:00,czmmxar,2.0,t1_czmdbp1,13018.0,The_Donald

2355,"Alright well, I'm definitely not any of the things you just mentioned, and I'm actually fairly open about supporting Trump in my life. I'm not a racist, I definitely think gay people should have the same rights as us. Trump supported legal unions for gay people back in 2000. Granted, that's not marriages, but that was also way ahead of the curve for republicans. He's downplayed that stance for Iowa, and has actually said that he wants it to be left up to the states. I disagree with that, and I don't think it would get overturned. The one I might be able to see is xenophobic, since technically I am skeptical of other people coming to the US for nefarious purposes. Phobia suggests unwarranted fear. I don't think that being cautious now is unwarranted. Does that mean everyone that comes to the US? Of course not. Am I against Muslim people? I live across the street from a Mosque, and I'm really friendly with them. I have nothing against Muslims. I do have issue with the refugee crisis, but that's more of my view of isolationism than anything else. If you meant xenophobia against illegal immigrants, frankly I care less about that subject because I'm not in a border state. But I can say that I'm annoyed at the outcry of people that criticize Trump's stance. They're illegal. Criticizing people who broke the rules shouldn't be dismissed. To answer why I shouldn't act like Trump does in real life, I mean, I'm not a billionaire. I'm not trying to get the media's attention.

He outlined it in one of his books, how he thinks legal immigration is one of the best things for the country. As for getting the hispanic vote, you might be right. [But he has more hispanic vote than Romney did in 2012](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/11/poll-trump-gets-hispanic-support-romney-2012/).

Mexico is also not a race.

2423,"Trump's stance on deal making is by anchoring to a high point with hyperbole first and foremost. As a result, there really isn't any way to stop immigration for all muslims. However, the fact that it was brought up as both a talking point and a policy does 3 things. First it gives Trump the upperhand when talking to other people that are also against muslim immigration. No one else can one up him, and therefore may seem weaker. Second, he has essentially given the opening bid for a bargain that may ensue if he gets elected. He's anchored the deal already, and therefore has a stronger ground leading into any policy making should he be elected. And thirdly, he was able to make the press give him headlines for weeks. All of these are outlined in Art of the Deal. So to answer your point, there really isn't a way to restrict Muslim immigration completely if it is ruled constitutional. But right now he is trying to get elected rather than actually make the policy itself. People of the Muslim faith are allowed to lie about their faith to ""infidels"" anyway, especially if it is for the good of islam. It's not considered haram if you're lying to the US pretty much.

And I'm so for the idea of the wall and would like it up tomorrow. However, I think there are more pressing matters that if we had to order problems based on how imperative they are, dealing with ISIS should be number 1. That is a threat that could happen tomorrow, whereas illegal immigration is more of a prolonged issue. I think that the merit that Trump should have is in bringing it up as an issue, and stating very clearly how he would solve the issue regardless of how PC it was, and got people looking at it again. He showed from the get go (I think he brought up the wall either during his announcement or very early on, can't remember) how he could tackle hard issues and gave us a better look into why we should vote for him.

2450,"To briefly answer your question, the answer is pretty much yes. I assume it's a simple site, so you'll want to upload any html, css, js, and asset files you have to a hosting company. I'd suggest not using GoDaddy, or 1&amp;1, but pretty much any other hosting company should be fine enough. If the small business doesn't already have a domain name, you'll want to get one of those as well, so that you're audience will have an easy to remember address that they can use to reach your site. Most hosting companies are also domain registrars, so you'll have an option to buy a domain name during checkout usually. If the whole thing was developed locally, then it should pretty much work online, provided the links are formatted correctly, all assets are in the correct place, etc. However I will offer a word of caution for future projects. If you used any of the WYSIWYG features of dreamweaver, you might not have optimized code for a site. For something like a static small business site, it's not a big deal. But for anything larger, it's certainly not ideal. Dreamweaver isn't really the tool of choice anymore for developers. We use text editors that have no browser built in, and use other browsers instead.

The mobile version of your site should be the simplest.

It's generally bad to go the other way around, it's an optimization pain. Lastly, it focuses on what many are saying will be the largest demographic of users.

2518,"This is obviously a very personal question, and one that I don’t think is specific to web design / web development, though it does seem the case that a lot of people who are doing what we do seem to not be happy with what they are doing. The short answer to your titular question is no, and I really don’t feel like I have to. If you’re feeling that way, then that means that you’re probably doing something that you really don’t enjoy doing. That’s not to say that people who are taking medication to deal with stress, or depression should feel ashamed, obviously. Everyone has some problems, and sometimes medication is a necessary solution. But if you’ve gone from being happy and fulfilled with work to thinking about taking medication to deal with it, then chances are that there is something off with what you’re doing. 

So what you described for your job of rewriting other people’s code, I can’t even imagine how frustrating this is. I get annoyed when I have to rewrite chunks of my own code, let alone anyone else’s. So you’re definitely not crazy, or “not cut out for this” if you’re getting annoyed by that. I can imagine that if that is the only thing you are doing for web development, you’d start to hate it pretty quickly. You mention that you spend $300 on wordpress themes a month, so that you can tweak them. Have you considered building themes from scratch? It can be a bit daunting at first, but if you know HTML, CSS, and JS, adding a bit of PHP isn’t really that much of a leap, and it could get you into building something of your own. 

For the last part of your post, about feeling like a failure, that is something that I think can come with any job. Programming, in particular though,  can come with a feeling of being an [imposter](https://davidwalsh.name/impostor-syndrome). David Walsh talks about it in that link, and how he dealt with it. You shouldn’t feel like a failure all the time from the work that you do. If that’s the case, then maybe you should try and do some projects that you’re really interested in. I get that money can be an issue as far as devoting a lot of time to it, but you may find in the long run that working on projects you like will help you learn a lot more, and will actually gain you more experience / money in the future. 

The truth is that while you should be happy with what you do, that doesn’t mean that feeling like what you’re doing isn’t good enough is a bad thing. That seems like a stupid thing to say, but if what you build something, are incredibly proud of it, and that’s that, you won’t grow as a developer. Web development is very very hard, despite what people tell you. It takes a long time to get comfortable with building things. The learning curve of building things from code, rather than visuals, is incredibly steep. The important thing is to learn to recognize these shortcomings, and use them as an inspiration, rather than a roadblock to your success. Personally, I have a lot of projects I think are pretty horrible. I didn’t do a good job with them. I have freelance work that I think is garbage. I have side projects that didn’t pan out the way I wanted. The important thing is not to get hung up on the failure, and instead try and learn why it didn’t end up as well as it could have. 

There might also be things in your personal life that are affecting how you’re feeling about your work. I’m not a psychiatrist, and I don’t know you personally. But if you feel like you’re stuck at work, talking to a friend or family member about it might make you feel a lot better than anonymous people online. This community is really useful for gathering information and asking for advice, but someone that know’s you personally might be able to help you a lot more.

Almost entirely. I try and follow up with an email if there is one available, expressing interest to whoever you'll be working directly with, or who will be hiring

This is what a cover letter is for. Especially in this field, the specifics of each job vary greatly. Mentioning things like the particular language they are looking for, or experience with projects similar to the once you'd be working on, is really important. So yeah, resume can be the same for each submission, but cover letter should be different for each.

In my experience, recruiters do most of the job on behalf of the employers. A lot of the listings I see on indeed or cybercoders are from recruiters.

&gt;Sophomore in college with a pretty successful we design business

How many clients? How many employees? What were your profits like? I'm not trying to say that what you did isn't great, but as a sophomore in college, you might want to consider that as just freelance unless you had a company structure, payroll, etc. I suspect the latter.

&gt;Slowly growing for the last year or so

This isn't long enough to accurately say if a company is growing or not.

&gt;a CTO... would be in the oversight of hardware more than software/design

Does that mean it really just falls to you? What happens if software doesn't work as intended. Are you solely responsible?

&gt;I wouldn't be payed... but he told me to pick my title

You should be paid for your time. If you aren't being paid, you're just an unpaid intern.

&gt;I will be overseeing others in the development process and will be in charge of a team... they will not have a legitimate role in the business and will be through the university

So... 5 people doing all the development and none of them are being paid? And aren't ""legitimate""? Again, what happens when something goes wrong. Can the company claim it's all your work if it goes south?

&gt;I took the position because I'll be able to work with leaders in my area and hopefully gain a job after college or a good resume builder

This is great, but you should still be paid for your time, or else, again, you're just an intern.

&gt;I want to assume a role such as ""Web Development Manager"" however I know that if I put this on a resume, employers might think I am BSing and being pompous.

I don't mean this to come across as an insult, and more as advice. You kind of are being pompous. I know that you see that you are doing well, and the fact that you're looking for work is great. But it is far more important for someone your age to become very very good at development before worrying about any leadership roles.

&gt;I only have 2-3 years experience in the field and that experience is limited to Wordpress which most don't even consider experience.

Is this development experience, or just adding themes to sites? Do you know HTML and CSS, PHP and Javascript? 2 - 3 years experience implies full time work for 2 - 3 years.

 This whole thing sounds very fishy. At 20 years old, it's most definitely not too young to find work in development, but I think far too young for leadership roles. If I were you I would be worried far less about titles and more about gaining experience while learning, and getting paid. 

EDIT: 

I wanted to add something, since I feel kind of like a dick for being harsh on someone who is trying to get real world experience. When I was 19, I did web design with really rudimentary development. I was able to find a ""job"" during the summer for a very large company. I'll be honest, I mainly got this experience through nepotism, whereas you seem to have really been putting your feet to the pavement to find opportunities. Anyway, I put job in quotes because it was never really discussed if this was an internship, or what. It was unpaid, and remote. But I did have regular one on one conversations with the head of marketing for this large company.  I would basically make mockups and give web design critiques and information, get things ready for conference calls with developers and marketers. I think I did an alright job. Some of my designs ended up in the final project. But I remember thinking the same thing as far as ""what should my title be"". I (embarrassingly) would tell people who asked I was consulting. I thought in my mind, it seems close to what I'm doing. I was stupid, luckily never put it on a resume and officially declared that's what I was, because really I was just an unpaid intern. Not even one in the office at that. I'm still young, but I think I'm at least experienced enough to realize how much more someone needs to know for leadership positions. So I'm not saying that you shouldn't work for whoever and whatever you want, though I did give my advice. But I will say that saying you're an intern and just gaining experience might be a better, and more humbling, experience.",2015-11-05 18:42:50+00:00,cwpobmf,1.0,t3_3rnpy9,1174.0,web_design

This is a pretty static way to do this though, since your site will be tied directly to the database. Another popular pattern is called MVC, or Model View Controller, which is basically the pieces that you mentioned. The Model is the database, the view is the front end, and the controller is the programming logic that connects the two. One of the most popular ways companies use their databases now is by integrating them with an API. Rather than have the site connect directly to the database, the site will instead connect to an API, which will distribute data depending on what http call is made to the server. This is really popular since it gives a standard stream of data that only needs to be set up once. From there, future versions of the site, third party sites, and even things like desktop and phone applications can use the same data, without any additional set up to the database. You should look into MVC I think. There are tools in most languages that use this pattern, and it's exactly what you'd want to use for the site you described, with the possibility of having a simple API as well. As for picking a language, you should pick a combination that has been tried and tested by others. for example there are ""stacks"" (which is just a word to describe the front end, back end, and logic) like LAMP, MEAN, and countless others. LAMP uses Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. I like MEAN a lot since it only uses different javascript frameworks and applications. It stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node. But you will want to know your stack very well before diving too deep into it.

2598,"Maybe show some respect to all those ""male pale and stale"" people, since they are the reason you have a job in the first place, and the reason our industry is doing so well. If you want to make £100,000, take your lumps, sweat for a few years, and then you've earned it. This whole thing is such a naive fluff piece and sounds like it was written by an angsty 15 year old.

EDIT: This thing really annoyed me, which is funny because I usually only see stuff on /r/webdev get heated over languages, performance, and clients. So I'm going to go through and pick apart this article because I think it's detrimental to our community.

&gt;A lot of IT veterans are stuck in their way and out of touch with contemporary dev and design practices. Sadly, this can be frustrating for an experimental, young development team whose tech stack is restricted by decisions ‘higher up’.

I take this as ""I know more than my boss, I should be able to do what I want"". Believe it or not, there might actually be reasons to stick to old practices, even though your hip, coffee drinking, experimental self knows better than to trust the pale oligarchy.

&gt;23 year olds understand the concept of users. We are a generation that has grown up vainly publishing content publicly, whether it is msn, bebo, myspace, facebook, instagram, twitter or snapchat. We relish feedback. Social media and their public image intimidate most 53 year olds. This shyness is apparent in product development.

Just the fact that you're toting being 23 as if its some kind of advantage should be enough to stop this in its tracks, but saying you have experience with user interaction because you use social media, and saying that 53 year olds just don't get it, is pretty ridiculous. 

&gt;  A 23-year-old earning £100,000 would encourage a product team to build it, deploy it, learn from it and iterate it. A 53-year-old earning £100,000 nervously prods a product team to build it, think about it, wait a little, change that, fix that, remove that, check we all like it, release it and subsequently pull it. 

A successful 23 year old has been successful for 1 year. A successful 53 year old has been up and down, for decades, and has presumably wound up on top. You ever think that maybe that testing and ""fixing"" as you call it, has an actual reason for being there?

&gt; This concept ‘higher up’ should not exist within product development. It saddens me when analysts waste their life producing org charts. This is usually an egotistical pdf. I would be less critical if it were a living dashboard, built using d3 to exhibit each member’s contribution to the product. A simple github api integration would demonstrate that maximum contribution to the actual product originates from the developers, who you guessed it reside near the roots of most org trees. 

You don't need every piece of bleeding edge technology in every little piece of your life you know. If you want to become an analyst and change that though...

&gt;Now there is not much of football I respect.

Making more and more fans I see.

&gt;Nonetheless, It should not take x number of years to earn x amount of pounds. Instead, financial reward should be based on yield and individually gained. The fabled pay bracket is a restrictive and comfortable net; it segregates and aggregates. Wages should be individually attributed to reduce comparison and crying. 

If you really want to work with that system then you'd be making no money when you're trying to put kids through college. Things are the way they are because they often work pretty well. All those higher ups you see at one point were in the same seat as you, young and ambitious. 

&gt;Have you ever been asked the question how much do you earn? For me, the concept of earning a set amount of money per year is flawed. It maintains that every individuals output will be constant throughout the entire year. You and I know this is flamingo poo. I think this figure should be a variable, influenced by our quantified daily, hourly even minutely contribution.

Go work for a place with commission and bonuses then.

&gt;It is very easy to propose a concept but practically achieving it is another thing.

Like changing the world so that young people get paid more?

&gt;There is no reason this quantified approach cannot be applied professionally. A major advantage would be self-learning; gaining real time data on ones output would be motivational. It would also highlight the obscene amount of hours ‘higher ups’ spend shaking hands and waffling in meetings. Importantly, it would expose the unproductiveness of the typical 9-5 working regimes.

Time cards exist. But really, if you want to judge yourself on your own in a collaborative field like this, there isn't much that can be explained. You're standing on the shoulders of giants. All the work in this industry is based on the work of others. When you're in a work environment, it's not ""your"" work, it's ""our"" work.

&gt;Most notably, it would separate the clingers from the climbers and would guarantee that more 23 year olds rightfully earn £100,000.

If you think you're not paid enough, go work somewhere else. This whole thing just reminds me how important it is to add humility to your list of skills. There's nothing more off putting than some wannabe know-it-all, straight out of school kid that has ""big plans"". I guess I should end this with saying that I'm 22.

2604,"1) Exactly. Some small businesses use things like SquareSpace to get up and running, but that runs into the same problem as other WYSIWYG. You picked up on something I didn't even mention, which is previewing in the browser. It's pretty important to view your work in a browser, since that is the exact medium that your users will be looking at. It doesn't seem like a big deal, and you might not see a ton of differences between, say DreamWeaver's live view, and Chrome, but there are millions of little differences even across the major browsers used today, let alone a ""viewer"" that was built for just one application.

2) Reddit is made using a lot of different things. There are two main points in web development: Front End and Back End. Both sides require developers. Front End developers build everything that you can see. They usually focus on developing in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some client side logic in a server side scripting language of choice. You nailed it with the database thing. That requires back end developers. Big companies like Reddit maintain databases of all the info on their site, and it basically gets injected in the right place via server side scripting. This is a lot more complicated than it sounds, but it would be ridiculous to have to hand write every piece of information for a dynamic site like Reddit. I think that Reddit runs on Ruby, but I can't really remember

3) With HTML and CSS you'll be able to do basic front end work. So you'll be able to make static web sites.

2606,"Welcome to the world of Web Design. I really suggest, as will most of the people on this subreddit, not to use muse or dreamweaver. Muse is what's called a WYSIWYG editor (What You See Is What You Get), and these are strongly discouraged especially for production level sites. The code that they generate is pretty much unreadable, and you'll have a very hard time trying to make it work on multiple browsers, optimizing performance, etc. Dreamweaver is better but still not good. It's basically a text editor with a WYSIWYG built in, and as with Muse, that WYSIWYG part is garbage. The text editor is fine, but very uncustomizable, and is pretty bloated as far as text editors go. If you really want to learn how to make websites the correct way, you're going to need to learn how to code. That seems daunting right now, but I promise that it's not nearly as hard as it seems. HTML and CSS especially are easy to get a hang of. So if you decide to go down this route, you'll need some stuff. First off, is a way to learn HTML and CSS. I think most people here would recommend [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com). There are courses for learning HTML and CSS all over the place on that site, and are tailored for total beginners. Something you should know going in though, is that the things you are going to make at first are going to be static, and they won't look amazing. That's normal, it takes a lot of time to be able to translate good code into good design. Once you have the courses there down, you'll probably want to start making your own stuff right? You're going to need some tools first. Remember how I mentioned that the text editor in Dreamweaver is alright, but could be better? Well there are alternative text editors that most people in this industry use. The popular ones are:

* [Sublime Text 2 &amp; 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

There are countless others but those are the big ones I feel. These text editors are basically designed to help write code, and will make it a lot easier to do so, with things like autocomplete, formatting, and a host of other built in features. They all also come with packages that can be installed to custom the look and functionality of each. There's tons of articles online about what packages you should use with your text editor.

So let's say you're set up at that point. You can write HTML files and style them with CSS. The next thing you'll want to learn is JavaScript. If you have no prior programming experience, it might seem like a lot to handle, but if you practice at it, you'll be able to make interactive websites. You can use JQuery to make building sites easier too, which is a library of commonly used JavaScript, but I would suggest learning basic plain JS before learning JQuery as it can lead to bad writing practices. The list goes on and on as far as what you can learn next, but a list I can think of that would be helpful, would be:

* **Git** - A version control tool that makes it much easier to keep track of your code, and helps with collaboration. It's a gold standard for organization when it comes to web development

* **SASS** - Pretty much CSS on steroids. Anything that can and will annoy you about CSS is taken care of with this preprocessed language. It can be a pain to set up at first, but is really worth it

* **PHP** - A server side scripting language, PHP is one of the most popular languages on the web, with platforms such as WordPress and many other CMS's using it as a base.

That seems like a lot, but if you practice with it, you can really make some cool, good looking stuff

I haven't done a ton of research on testing ping, but would it be possible to mimic the client portion in something like JS, and then test it from the client side in the browser to wherever its getting sent in the app? That seems pretty sketchy though. So if we just have a browser in the current app instead, adding ads would be simply getting the markup that google provides for their ads and putting that in ""sidebars"" on the browser. Maybe even force the browser to ""wrap"" around your app, so it looks like actual banner ads? That would give you room for the other sections, the chat room, search and whatever else, and it would make it seem more like a web page for the user, so I doubt they would care too much about ads (I mean skype has banner ads!). It would limit your monetization to just app users though. I'm not sure if you have a download page right now, but you could also set up a web page for your app that has a download link that is pointed at a github repo, and will grab that setup file, or the whole app or whatever you want. You could put ads on that page as well. Kind of double dipping with your users, as far as ads go. ",2015-10-09 14:27:36+00:00,cvtpgku,5.0,t1_cvtokyo,1528.0,web_design

Then it would put the information back to the user on the client side, in the browser, via a view. I only bring up the server side stuff since C# is really only used as a server side language, and not client side. But if you have a traditional web app like this, then you would be able to monetize it easier. As for the other thing I saw you ask, about how analytics affects monetization, it doesn't directly, but you will be able to get more accurate analytics, seeing what users click on, how long they stay, what they use, etc., rather than just if they are using it or not. If you find out that more people do X rather than Y that might help you tailor your banner ads better.

2641,"JS is generally negligibly small compared to other assets, so concatenation is often enough to speed things up. Take all your JS, concatenate it into a single file using something like gulp or grunt, and then have your website link to that file. The main slow thing with JS is if you have multiple files, the browser will make multiple HTTP requests, and even if each of the files are small, it will take more time to request each one than to get it all in bulk at once. So I'd say unless you really really know that the JS you've written is so large that you only want it for parts of a page, there's no reason not to include it as one linked file across all pages. a few Kb isn't going to kill your site. And if you turn on browser caching then you have your site's JS saved for the client, even when they go to different pages. If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), I'd recommend checking them out just so you don't have to manually look up how to concatenate your javascript. You'd want to look into those, and a module called [grunt-contrib-concat](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat) for grunt, as well as [grunt-uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify). There are similar modules for gulp too, with very similar names.

2642,"I'm impressed. Made a cool app, and found a creative way to check and see how well its doing. Nice job! Now since it's a Windows app, I think it might be even more useful as a website, simply because new users will be able to hit it quicker. For example, I use [speedtest](http://speedtest.net) a lot, and I think it works great. I imagine your app is similar and targeted just for LoL players. If you already have the logic worked out in your app, and it's written in .NET, it shouldn't be too much pain to convert it to a website. I'm not a .NET developer, but I know that the way .NET works now with web projects is that they are very fluid with what types of projects you're working on, since it's all pretty much written in C#. So I think you'd just have to make some web based views in VS, and add them to a web-based project/version of your current app. I'm not a .NET developer but I've used it sparingly, so I know that that's possible. After that, I think banner ads are the way to go. For a free site like that, people won't be upset about banner ads (so long as they aren't crazy large). With your user base I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of them had adBlock, since gamers tend to have it a lot. But you could still get a little bit of income from your work, which is always awesome. Not a ton, but some. As a website you'll be able to track your analytics easier too.

2648,"How much does a car cost? Kind of a hard question to answer right? There are a lot of variables that need to be figured out, and unfortunately, you're the only one that can answer them. But as a rule of thumb, you'll want to start out with how much you think you should be paid hourly, if you were to be hired full time some place. Are you shooting for $40k a year? That's roughly $20 an hour. A very rough rule of thumb is what your yearly salary is divided by 2000. That's your hourly wage (rough but it works). But that's if you were to work at a place full time, with benefits, and guarantees of steady work. So to make up for this, freelancers usually mark up their hourly rate, sometimes by 50% or more. So let's say we're at $30 an hour. That might be considered high or low to you, so adjust it as you see fit. Remember that higher prices comes with higher expectations. Okay so we have an hourly rate. Now we want an estimate for how long it's going to take. Are you offering to do revisions to your work? How many? How many hours total do you suspect it to take. That's your estimate. Depending on how you plan on charging (I feel most freelance designers do it based on estimates, rather than hourly like other professions, but I'm sure some do hourly) you then multiply it by how long you think it will take. Let's say it'll be 10 hours total. That might be low, but that would be $300. That's assuming every other variable mentioned, but that's how I do freelance for web stuff. I also keep track of my work via [Toggl](http://www.toggl.com), to see if my estimates are right, and just for general book keeping. But I'd say that your first freelance experience is going to be not at all what it should be. It's a learning experience, and you'll find that you'll be able to estimate how much stuff will cost with time. One piece of advice is that I almost always think something will take LESS time than it ends up being, so you might want to factor that in as well. Also, it won't matter since you're just starting out with this one job, but you're going to want to keep track of things for tax purposes.",2015-10-08 18:03:52+00:00,cvsqgr3,1.0,t3_3nzx2m,1353.0,graphic_design

It is considered SEO friendly to have your navigation in a list like that, or better yet, an HTML5 nav element. So that part seems fine. But that's just the navigation section. Let's look at tabs used for just sections of a page, rather than full pages themselves. If you're talking about the content that will be on the different tabs, the problem is that depending on the technique you are using, content that is not on the active tab might not show up in the DOM, or it might. This can become a problem when you have things like multiple h1 elements across different tabs. There are also many different ways to do tabs. JQuery UI has one too. They use JS declaration to get theirs going. In my experience, tabs are often more trouble than they are worth. And that is just for content on a section of a page, rather than full pages themselves. Not to mention the fact that users don't often see tabs as main navigation, so its not very user friendly either. So to answer your question, I really don't think its a good idea. 

**How to fudge it if you really want to make it seem like tabs.**

If you want to have pages of content that look like they are all part of the same tabbed system, without having to worry about the SEO stuff, you could always build a Single Page Application using something like angular. This allows you to render views based on routing, so you can have content show up or not show up based on what ""tab"" is active, or what url is currently in the address. One of the benefits of SPA's is that you can avoid load time between content, which is also one of the highlights of tabs too.",2015-09-10 12:42:47+00:00,cuwo975,1.0,t3_3kdtpa,5211.0,web_design

2744,"&gt; Why shouldn't I use this in production?

I think there's a few reasons. Other people don't use this technique often. It seems really cool, as the disconnect between CSS and JS is a big bridge that needs to get filled, but it seems that the repo that you linked to might not be tested enough on for production environments. One of the reasons everyone uses JQuery is because they know it will work. Am I saying that this is garbage and you shouldn't use it? No, not necessarily, but I wouldn't bank something like a high traffic eCommerce site on having to rely on this somewhat experimental tool. There's also another reason why you should at least not implement it the way you seem to be doing. 

&gt;Is Sass even the appropriate place to determine whether or not my header should be fixed.

The answer is sort of. It seems that the most common and semantic ways to deal with issues like these is to have classes for specific states of elements, and then use some small amount of Javascript to switching between those states. So while you have that boolean that you switch on and off, it is much more common for people to add classes to elements when they want tit to change. This keeps all of their styles in the CSS, and all their logic in the JS. 

Now with all that said, and me being done playing devil's advocate, I feel like this is actually really cool and can be helpful for a lot of different instances.

2785,"Okay, lemme give a crash course of what you'll need to learn, and what tools you should use.


**What to Learn** - to start off, the things you'll want to learn are HTML and CSS. You'll want to learn these and become as proficient as you can before moving on to anything else. Lynda has a huge collection of learning both of these I'm sure. HTML is fairly easy to grasp and become good at quickly, while CSS is also easy, but takes more time. You also won't be able to learn everything about CSS. Even professionals don't know everything about CSS, and google solutions a ton. But learn as much as you can, and become very good at it. After you've gotten these two down, you'll want to learn Javascript. Javascript is the most popular scripting language for front end web applications and sites, which is basically a fancy way of saying that its the programming language you'll want to learn the most about if you're doing web design. Trust me, you'll want to get Javascript fundamentals down.


**A Text Editor** - You can think of these as fancy versions of Microsoft Word that are used specifically to write code. Any google search will return a bunch of options but I suggest Sublime Text 2 / 3.


**Other Tools** - version control software is an awesome tool for keeping track of the code you write. I suggest the new github application for people just starting out. I'm pretty sure there's a tutorial on the site of how it works, but basically it will keep a record of any change you make to your code, so that you can go back to other versions of your code in case you want to see changes or revert to a newer version. It also allows you to make branches so you can have several different versions of your code saved side by side so that you can work on different portions of code at the same time.",2015-08-21 19:07:21+00:00,cuazl14,1.0,t3_3hv998,8176.0,graphic_design

	    var item = list.pop();
