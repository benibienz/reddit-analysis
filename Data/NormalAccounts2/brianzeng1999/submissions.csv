This friction is supposed to point forward, causing the wheel to accelerate forward. What I don't get is, if the friction force points forward, then wouldn't the wheel turn counterclockwise because the force is being applied in the counterclockwise direction?

Imagine a bucket is suspended over a well by a winch and a rope. When the system is released from rest, the bucket falls down while the winch rotates. 

My textbook states that the rope does no net work, because at the bucket end, the force and the displacement are in the same direction, and at the winch end, they are in opposite directions.

I don't understand why this is true. Doesn't the tension exerted by the rope on the bucket go in the opposite direction of the motion? And doesn't the tension exerted by the rope on the winch go in the same direction of the motion?

That means I could predict with a 68% probability that another group recorded mean will be within .10 of my mean.

But what if I wanted to predict the average of the means of each group?

Would I then do this:

(9.9 * 68 + 9.8 * 32)/100= 9.86

(10.1*68 + 10.2 * 32)/100=10.13

Meaning that the mean of the means is going to be between 9.86 and 10.13?

If the average of group A's scores was 5 and group B's scores was 4.9, and the standard deviation for group A was 2 while the standard deviation for group B was 0.5, then which group did better?

My guess is group B since although it didn't hit 5 for the average, it's scores are more clustered around 4.9 because of its small standard deviation.

But is there a mathematical formula to take into account both the mean and the standard deviation to determine the best group? Thanks
