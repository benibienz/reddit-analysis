0,"High cost of living is what I'm worried about. Is it the same for every island? In the spring I'll be just graduating college and I'll soon have to start paying loans back. I've been on the hunt for jobs, but I don't know if they'll be able to sustain a liveable lifestyle. I have a low standard of living and I'm resourceful and minimal in lifestyle, but is that enough to be able to stay in the VI? ",2016-10-19 16:41:39+00:00,d8yxjz8,,t1_d8p3rxq,,IWantOut
1,"I know it will take a lot of effort to make a living for myself and it all depends on the pay of the jobs I can apply to. I already live on my own on Long Island, so I understand the difficulties of having little to no outside support. I love the idea of starting new and the challenges that are presented to me. Hopefully I can make an experience out of it, but I have to get there first. ",2016-10-12 17:17:19+00:00,d8p1428,2.0,t1_d8oykcx,2941.0,IWantOut
