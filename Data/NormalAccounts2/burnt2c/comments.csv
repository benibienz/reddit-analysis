1,"About 2 years ago I was laying in bed sleeping alone and I felt someone sit down next to me on the bed. I'm a very light sleeper so it woke me up.  I jumped up thinking maybe it was my dog so I turned on the light to see where she was and she was laying on the floor on her bed. I wrote it off as me dreaming and went back to sleep.  An hour or so later in awaken by a small dogs bark. My dog is huge so it wasn't her.  It went in for about 10 minutes before I finally got up and looked out my bedroom window and saw a tiny pomeranian sitting,  staring into my window barking.  My blinds and curtains were shut, it could not see in. They say dogs can sense the supernatural and for that to happen right after feeling something sit down on my bed fuckin freaked me out!

Once I realized things are beyond my control,  I reached out for help.  I told my parents what was going on and the scary,  uncontrollable thoughts I was having (I'm 33 years old).  Doing just that was a huge relief.  Knowing I was no longer in this alone and that I have a support system.  

I have since gone to my dr and have been put on Buspar which I take twice a day.  I've taken zoloft in the past and I hated how it made me feel like a zombie.  Buspar has had the opposite affect on me.  I feel normal again.  No longer numb to the world.  I hate that I'm taking medication but it's better than the alternative!

81,"You really need to go to your general doctor and describe your feelings and thoughts and get on some mediation to help with those.  I too was having thoughts of killing myself   when really I didn't want to but I just couldn't imagine living the rest of my life the way I felt while having the panic attacks.  I am now on 30mg of Buspar a day and it had helped tremendously and I no longer have those thoughts.  I never had those thoughts prior to these attacks but I do believe I have been suffering from depression for a few years now.  I think the depression finally took its toll on me and boiled over into these panic attacks. 

Buspar has greatly improved my quality of life in just the 2 weeks I have been on it.  I feel like myself again.  While I do still get the occasional attack,  they are no way near as strong as they once were and definitely not as often.  I was having them multiple times a day and they would last for hours at a time.  

See your doctor.  Don't hesitate.  You can regain control of your life again! ",2016-01-23 05:12:20+00:00,cz8o32b,1,t3_428cvk,18722,Anxiety

84,Yeah Xanax just helps calm the body down.  The Buspar is what has really made the biggest difference.  I too thought I was going insane and was actually starting to have really scary thoughts that I could not control.  I was actually hospitalized twice due to this.   Antidepressants sound scary just because it makes you think that you're having to take them because you're crazy.  You're not.  It's just a disconnect in your brain and the meds help fill in that disconnect.  It's something to do with lack of seratonin.  Research SSRI's.  Talk to your doctor about it and see if these are a good option for you!  ,2016-01-22 21:59:09+00:00,cz8a2lm,3,t1_cz89u0k,347,Anxiety

I felt this way for a solid two months, consistently having these attacks multiple times a day.  I finally got put on Buspar and Xanax.  Ever since taking the Buspar I feel like myself again.  I still get the occasional attack but they are much more mild than they used to be and very far between.  ",2016-01-22 21:48:02+00:00,cz89lvc,1,t3_427nz9,1434,Anxiety

89,"Hi there.  I've recently (last 3 months)  have been having pretty severe panic attacks that has put me in the hospital 2 times.  I was given Xanax which helps when I feel an attack coming on or in a full blown attack.  However, recently my GP put me on Buspar.  I have now been on it just shy of 2 weeks and it has made a world of a difference so far.  The attacks are few and far between now and much more mild than they were.  

I myself,  was like you where I was scared to go anywhere in case I were to have an attack.  I was afraid of being alone for that same reason.  The last 3 months I just genuinely felt out of it and my thoughts were very cloudy and at times very scary.  Buspar has made me feel normal again. Clear minded,  I don't harp on constantly feeling scared or worried.  I can function and feel like myself again.  

If you need anyone to talk to feel free to PM me.  I'll be happy to try and answer questions or just talk.  ",2016-01-19 01:48:44+00:00,cz3fl17,1,t3_41lh67,11267,Anxiety
