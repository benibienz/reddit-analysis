It's done it on multiple devices.  Any ideas as to why it would do this? ,GalaxyS7,Phone reboots when connected to Bluetooth,https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS7/comments/4fr5q1/phone_reboots_when_connected_to_bluetooth/

It made it...well simple to share large files such High Def videos.  Why would they not carry thar over to marshmallow?  That's disappointing.  Is there any other way too do this?  I know you can via Whatsapp but I'd rather not only be able to share videos with someone who also has Whatsapp. ,GalaxyS7,No Simple Sharing on Marshmallow?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS7/comments/4c3r2f/no_simple_sharing_on_marshmallow/

When connected via WiFi I've had zero issues.  I mainly use Iheartradio so I Uninstalled the app but when I went to the play store to install it again it said incompatible with my device.  

I'm on the T-Mobile variant and switched from the Note 5.  Currently switched back because I'm so damn frustrated with the S7 Edge.  Did I just get a phone with a bad radio?
