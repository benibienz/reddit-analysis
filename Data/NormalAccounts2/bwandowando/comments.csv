1. the custom built by the dentist where they use a mold against your teeth fits very well against your teeth, too well that i have a hard time pulling it out as it also gets covered with saliva and creates a vacuum when you pull it out. Material is made of rubber and is very comfortable. Best protection but will cost more and needs a few days to few weeks to make.

2. the ones you boil are more of trial and error, you boil it too long, it will be unusable. you boil it too fast then you wont get the mold you'd like. Also, you will need to trim it using scissors or a knife to remove the sharp edges... my gums bled and fitting it is painful as you try it again and again, i know someone who had a perfect fit on his first try, but for some of us, it took multiple tries and multiple silicone mouth guards.

74,"I agree with this, the source of your joint pain is the pounding  when you run on the treadmill and do skip rope. What you should try to do is to minimize the pounding by doing something else while you try to lose weight and also strengthen your legs at the same time. When you get lighter, start incorporating tread mill and/ or skip rope.

Most of us started at the Global release of the game and climbed the ladder at the same time. Around 1/5 of the clan sits at Legendary Arena and the others are closing in. 

Regarding kicking out people, we only kick thise who have been inactive for a while but can come back anytime, like those who we noticed that are not donating and changing trophies.

Regarding people who want to be co leader, well no one in the clan really wants to be one, we just give co leader to whoever we feel like deserves it.

181,"Im a programmer and working as one for around 15 years. I agree that some bugs are caused by changes that are seemingly unrelated to the one that caused it. Sometimes it is an existing bug that only surfaced when a new feature came out that made it easier to create the scenario for it to manifest. But as soon as a ""critical"" bug has reached production ( or the actual end users) we work round the clock to create a hotfix to patch it ASAP and do write (automated) tests to ensure it wont happen again. Sometimes we dont know the scenario on how to reproduce / replicate a bug that we simply have to observe and analyze how the bug happens. This can be by checking memory dumps, reading log files, capturing user inputs, etc, etc.

In the case of the miner being ""accidentally"" changed to 0.7, a hot fix can address that, it is simply changing an in game constant value of 0.7s to1s, but as we all know 3 weeks have passed already and they havent addressed it. Why?

Simple.

They also have stats of the Miner buy rate and they are cashing in on it.

They abuse an already powerful unit that was given a free upgrade to the point of being broken to win tournaments and cups. By abusing a broken unit, that is disrespectful to the other players.

i just wanna share my story.

I started playing since day 1 of worldwide release, then i got stuck at level 9 and was always a win away from Legendary Arena then i come crashing again down to 2500. I always come up against decks with legendaries while i have ZERO.

Then i was able to get lvl 10 RG, then started to push ... AGAIN... i remember the last battle before i reached 3ooo trophies, he was using a deck with legendaries but had a brain fart and misplayed which i capitalized.

For another month I was bouncing between 25oo- 31oo cups, always to lose against people with legendaries. I finally accepted that i will NEVER have a legendary. About 2 weeks ago, I started opening a GOLDEN CHEST and went to bed, when i woke up... PRINCESS WAS THERE! I was OMF6W7FBBQ!?!? That was Friday. I ad 13oo wins before i got my 1st Legendary , and the legendary that i REALLY WANT.

Two days later, Ice Wizard (IW) became available in the shop, having 2oooo gold already, i bought gems with real world money for the missing 2oooo gold and bought IW. Played for a few hours, got a giant chest. That was a Sunday.

Monday came, I opened giant chest while a colleague at work was watching and saying ""YOU ALREADY HAVE TWO, THE WORLD WOULD BE UNFAIR IF YOU GE..."" Before he was finished talking, LAVA HOUND popped out. In a span of 4 days i got 3 legendaries after having no legendaries since worldwide release.

So you see, you just have to keep on playing

I think it is also possible for Will Smith to be pulled into the 3rd film, like how he gets teleported into an alternate reality with an experimental fusion drive when everyone thought he was dead in case they can pay his $50M fee in the 3rd film.

536,"Hello fellow BH addict, i also play predominantly supp BH and i hover around 4.5k- 4.7k, we have almost the same play style but i proactively hunt couriers. I have around 600 courier kills with 2 accounts combined. Getting one or two in a game is enough, my record was 6 kills in a game.

Remember
* walking courier respawn: 2mins 20 sec
* flying courier: 3 mins

Try to position and guess where the courier will be going when it respawns, most likely it will try to deliver to the same hero, but this time he walks down. You can either try to kill courier much nearer to their base or try to go another lane.

A good trick is also to refill bottle of mid player, u TP in, windwalk before , then mid player hands you his bottle.

I also annoy the jungler by leeching xp from him and doing the last hit with Jinada.

Also, remember that a sentry has 3 mins duration, so if u cant deward a sentry, you can take note of the time and just return later.

U will also have to be a little creative in your warding, if they are actively dewarding your wards, you have to ward a little more creative or in unusual place but with less vision. 

You can also creep into their base while invi or blinking in while ally heroes TP in with lvl 2 BoT, we won some games with this when our ultra farmed carry TP'd and suddenly popped into their base.

I try to help win the game by pouring lots of gold to my teammates by way of track and have intel all the time. Warding deep in their territory and tracking heroes all the time.

When some goes linken, i toss shuriken then track, then blink out and force staff away. 

i go dagger + force staff + Aether, i track then blink + force staff out + invi, repeat rinse. The only times i get caught with this is only when enemy team has Disruptor / pudge eith aether and daggers, but very seldom to happen. when pushing high ground, because of aether and increased force staff range, i sometime force staff a turtling hero down and force a team fight. 

Ultra late game, i prefer getting Scythe of Vyse.

Some games i go greaves + solar crest, but im more of an intel / scouting BH .

* be wary of getting taxis, if possible, use uber

* while many peenoise are absolute douchebags online, they are generally friendly in real life. 

* for food, just dont try weird things like balut or dinuguan if ur not ready. Adobo and Sinigang are must tries.

* using the McDonalds BigMac gauge, a big mac costs 120 philippine pesos, around 3 USD. And a liter of gasoline costs around 1 USD..

* traffic is mind blowing and seeing people going down cars and beating each other into a bloody pulp is albeit normal..

* the weather will be really hot and humid

* white people will be beggar magnet, expect beggars and street children to LITERALLY tug your pants for cheap change

* internet is relatively very slow and expensive here. Ping to SG dota server will be around 50 to 100 ms. That is already the BEST the country can provide.

553,"BH is best played as a roaming support. I play him for almost a year now (4.7k mmr). U pick him 3rd or 4th. If someone picks bara or slardar be wary, u can still pick him but it will be very challenging. When enemy picks mirana, clinkz, weaver, and or SA u insta pick him. He is squishy and has minimal impact in group battles but he is great when getting intel and also because of the track bonus. 


U start with
- 1 tango, 1 orb of venom, 2 clarities, 1 gg brwnch , and 1 ward.

Now where u place the ward depends on teammates and enemies. But most of the time u place it at mid to lessen ganks. If ur mid hero has a lot of survivability u place it offlane, up to u if for camp block or intel, i prefer intel over creep block.

U leech xp til lvl 3, harassing every now and then. U dont have the mana to shuriken toss so twke 2 lvls of jinada and 1 lvl of invi. As soon u hit 3 visit mid. Look at enemy mid hero items and performance. If he still doesnt have items and ur ally mid player has upper hand u can harass and even kill, if he doing well he probably have items in courier coming soon. A lvl 2 BH can kill courier in 1 hit with jinada and orb, flying courier needs 2 hits, 1st hit with Jinada. Kill a courier once enemy team gets a setback, kill it wx in a row and they will get demoralized and sometimes even make enemy teams implode and start the blame game. 

If u kill walking courier it will revive in 2mins and 20 sec, if flying it needs 3 mins. Most players deliver courier as soon as it revives so u can position urself to kill it again. Courier kills give gold to allies as well. U can also use deduction here, feel where courier is going to.

First major item is Boots, u need mobility to run around. Afterwards, upgrade to arcane then, a single sobi mask that can be converted to urn later. Afterwards, Blink dagger is the next big item. From here up to u if u go Mek. I prefer going force staff and simply hound the enemy team and track them 24/7. After force staff i go Gem or I can go Aether lens. The extra range is great, u track enemy heroes the moment u see them and with relatively safe distance.

Very long games u go full supp, going greaves / lotus orb/ solar crest. Sometimes i have BoT, Greaves, Dagger, Aether lens, gem, force staff at end game. 

U just track all game lang, kill courier, make them paranoid. Force supps to spend gold for dust and wards. U track, u blink out, u force staff. Take note of heroes with Rad, u cant track them then blink out, rad will CD ur dagger.  U do intel, u scout, u are the eyes and ears of the team. U place wards deep in their territory, u break enemy smoke,  u just have to have good reflexes.

Sometimes they will hunt u down and put wards on top of ledges and wait for u , u just have to be unpredictable as well, taking long routes and even TPing on other side. Check items on supps if they have dust or wards, if they buy then just harass them a bit then as soon as they place wards u TP to other lanes",2016-02-23 12:18:27+00:00,d0ahs94,1.0,t3_475yjk,8219.0,DotA2
