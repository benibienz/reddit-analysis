The reason is that it seems to be a tad faster than a regular jab and tried to practice it over the weekend. 

I went to the boxing gym earlier today and my trainer told me to spar with him which I obliged. I mixed the regular jabs and feints in the feeling out process. Then threw vertical jabs. The vertical jabs would hit him in the face (im wearing 14 oz gloves and both of us have head gear).

We went 3 rounds and in the last round, when he was about to throw a punch i threw a vertical jab that landed flush in his face that stunned him and he just smiled and said ""nice straigt right"" when it was actually just a vertical jab. I guess it was a bit powerful because he went face first into the punch, but i was surprised that he thought it was a straight right.

Thanks to JT Van V and to the vertical jab.

I mean, ive been sparring lately against my trainer and I cant land my punches. It is as if my punches are telegraphed which i try my best not to be. Then i always get countered and stunned when i try to throw combinations.

Q2. How to see punches coming? Where should i look at? At the chest? Neck? Use peripheral vision?

Im getting frustrated. Maybe im just too green and still a newbie (6 months training, 3x a week). Any tips from the seasoned vets? Things i should focus on?

A first time poster here. A bit of background, im a middle-30's guy that has been boxing for around 4 months.

Ok, i've been starting sparring already and been doing it with my trainer. Around a month ago, while sparring, he hit me with a body shot that folded me and i dropped like a bag of bricks. To him maybe it was just a very weak punch, but i guess sometimes things like this happen and it was totally unintentional. At first i thought it was nothing but any kind of breathing, moving, coughing, sneezing, etc, would shoot up a sharp pain on my ribs.  

I took a month off and im back training again but im not doing any sparring any time soon. How much time would you recommend before i start sparring again?

* 1 x Blackwidow Chroma KB
* 1 x Blackwidow Chroma TOurnament edition KB
* 1 x Blackwidow KB

( aside from having a few mouse pads in the past)

____________________

9 Items

Out of these products the following have the ISSUES

* 1 x Chroma Mamba Wireless

Mouse suddenly becomes unresponsive when in wireless mode, dongle's chroma lights suddenly flickers, i said , OH IT MUST BE MY RIG, so i tested it on my office laptop. Same problem, cant use it on gaming while on wireless mode, it now has become my office mouse... in non-wireless mode

* 1 x Blackwidow

6 months into its life , suddenly some keys, when pressed, pressed some other keys. Like , when pressing letter ""b"" it also presses, a few more letters. I said, oh i must have recordded a macro! Downloaded Synapse, acording to Synapse, there was no macro. Totally unusable, it now sits on a box, getting covered by dust. 

* 1 x Blackwidow Chroma TOurnament edition KB

This is my current office Keyboard, starting from day 1, the ""letter"" C doesnt work at all from time to time but the LED behind is working and cycling colors ( i know totally unrelated). What do you mean time to time? It means, that for hour the key works, then suddenly it DIES. The letter ""C"" doesnt work at all for minutes. I tried changing ports, cables, testing against multiple laptops, but the issue persists. OH IT MUST BE THE DRIVER/ SYNAPSE! I restart WINDOWS and go directly to Command prompt, ""C"" doesnt work.

The worst part is it almost cost me my job a few times. I am a sort of a DBA and i sometimes COPY-and-PASTE scripts, but because CTRL-C doesnt work SOMETIMES and WITHOUT any warning, sometimes i get to run the same script twice because the copying fails, or i send misspelled words in email. I checked synapse, also no macro. The letter ""C"" works for HOURS, then suddenly, it WONT F*CKING WORK FOR 10 MINS, so i have to use the laptop's keyboard which have small keys.

NOTE: 

* I updated to latest drivers
* tested against multiple machines
* tested against different ports. 

3/9 problems that i bought from different stores, all have issues.. MAJOR ONES. 

I cant use it in gaming
I cant even use it on the office.

Disgruntled fan.

[Simple Rules]

* Final roster will depend on tourney bot's groupings
* Put a ""/TT/"" prefix to your IGN
* We push to the very 1st tie point (2700), then from there determine if we push higher or just sit it out til tourney end.
* If we can, secure top 10 position
* If we can't secure top 10, secure top 11-20
* In case we lose top 20 and drop to 21st+, members that can still push start doing so then agree with new tie points.
 
&amp;nbsp;

[Tie points]

* Stage 2700
* Then 2710
* Then increments of 5 (depends on ranking if we can push further)

* Lucius, The Divine- a somewhat avatar of man kind against the titans. A paladin-esque in appearance and has skills based on divinity and holiness.

* Ururu, the watcher- a being from the very 1st race that traveled through the cosmos and the ancestors of the titans attacking our hero's homeworld. He decided to help our hero when he saw that his descendants went rampaging and killing lesser beings. His appearance looks like a grey/ alien unit with lasers and mythril/ silvery armor

* Tyr, the DemiGod- a demi god that goes down to heed the calls of help of the people. She has a halo or a trident/ bident and floats in mid air with floating souls/ orbs. 

* Nikka, the Planeswalker- another being that just walks through planes but decided to intervene and help our hero repel the titans. Looks like a elvish-humanoid with greenish skin and summons purple/ dark matter fire.

* Chuck, he who waits- one of the strongest beings in the universe, looks like chuck norris. Kicks fireballs out of his feet.",TapTitans,Suggest names for the next set of heroes,http://www.reddit.com/r/TapTitans/comments/3axkmw/suggest_names_for_the_next_set_of_heroes/
