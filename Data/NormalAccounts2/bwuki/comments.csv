If you are doing PVE, something like health regen, damage buff, and defense buff are good. Keep in mind warrior doesn't need crit damage, because the two main skills are 100% crit. Red slash+ overhead whirl. 

PVP:

Because of the ping for me on KR server I would want to have -10% movement speed. I put it on my [overhead slash](http://i.imgur.com/Gjea0wJ.gif), [my long ranged poke](http://i.imgur.com/ZqtMmV5.gif), and [my dash](http://i.imgur.com/LUzdArq.gif). This gives me 3 chances for my main charges/ranged damages to hit the enemy and apply a 10% movement debuff. Making it easier to land CC's like the [big overhead smash](http://i.imgur.com/1jMVFME.gif), and a grab.
