I'm a beginner but want something I could keep playing for a while as I get better. I don't want something cheap I'd grow out of soon. 

So I've been thinking about a SG or a Strat. 

What do humbuckers do to the guitars sound?  Should I seek out or avoid humbuckers?

I've been thinking about an HSS strat assuming that would be a versatile compromise. 

But if I should seek out humbuckers an HH SG may be better for me.

But I wondered if an automatic would be good for timing my runs.  So I put my Seiko SKX007 on a Nato and started running in that.  I absolutely love it!  It's really comfortable.  And I use the bezel to time my runs and when ever I look down at the watch, it's so easy to read, much easier than the stop watch on my G-Shock.

So my question for other runners, what watch do you use for your runs?",Watches,[sports] What watch do you use for jogging?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/3mkszm/sports_what_watch_do_you_use_for_jogging/

But I'm now hearing about Kinetic Direct Drives.  These seem better in that you can manually wind them to power them.

If anyone owns a kinetic direct drive, what do you think?

I read the Tangomat GMT's dial has kind of a cream or off-white tint to the dial.    It sounds hard to see but if noticeable, I wouldn't want that color.

And I like the Ahoi but the crown guards seem out of place.

Also, how is the textured strap for the Ahoi?  Does it look and feel good or is it something you'd replace quickly?

What I really like is the Metro- http://www.nomos-glashuette.com/the-watches/metro/metro/.
