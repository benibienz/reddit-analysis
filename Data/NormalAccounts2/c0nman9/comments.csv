85,"Flipside went to OT with a very poor looking NiP. Also I feel if Mouz shows up and they all frag like they can they will win. 16-9 if niko and nex and chrisJ show up. Could be closer though 

I picked Faze because , well, I honestly don't see splyce winning any games even against a shaky Faze. I say 16-8 Faze. :(

Picked G2 because C9 still haven't figured their T side strats out and I feel that even though g2 got rekt today they can still come back and at least make the c9 game close. I assume it will be 16-12 for G2

I pick Envyus even after their extremely shaky game today because I honestly don't see them going out 0-2. I feel if they do lose to gambit it will be close and maybe even OT. 16-14 Envy Us

NiP because they are probably my favorite team. If GTR and Forest and Xist go insane their is a chance but I think with the handicap (threat) LG will come up on top. It will be a close game though 16-12 NiP / LG

Astralis because they don't choke until the playoffs. If CLG show up it could be a close game But I still see astralis winning. 16-8 astralis

Fnatic ( self explanatory). Even though my heart says Liquid , I don't see them winning this match. 16-10 Fnatic

Na'Vi because VP will either be Virtus.premier or Virtus.Plow. Today they were Virtus.Plow but who knows tomorrow. If VP show up it will be a very close game but I still see Na'Vi winning. 16-12 Navi

Tomorrow will definitely be harder and closer matches than today though because of some slumping teams.
