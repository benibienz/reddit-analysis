We have been a Counter Strike : Global Offensive team since 2014 and have hosted as well as participated in a number of leagues and tournaments and even winning a few of them. Recently, we have decided to start expanding the team into an organization. As of right now we are looking to pick up a variety of teams and players that would be willing to play under our org. If we get a lot of requests we will go through and pick a few that we believe will be best fit for our organization.

What we look for in a team:

We are looking for a dedicated team that practices daily and competes in tournaments and leagues. Not only are we looking for a team that is active in the game but we are looking for teams that are mature and helpful to others. As your actions in the game , and outside, would reflect on the organization as a whole. We will not tolerate disrespectful members at all.



What we can provide:

As we are a new organization as of right now, we do not have the funding we would like at this time. In the future, based on team results and a multitude of other factors, we would plan on being able to fund fees for tournaments, leagues as well as jerseys and other things. What we can provide right now is a teamspeak server with private channels as well as a respectful and fun community to hang out in and meet others. We are also in the middle of making a website.

If you have any questions or have any interest in being a part of this organization feel free to DM us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/_TeamCerberus or message me on steam at http://steamcommunity.com/id/Conman9",RecruitCS,[NA] Team Cerberus looking to pick up players / teams,https://www.reddit.com/r/RecruitCS/comments/598rug/na_team_cerberus_looking_to_pick_up_players_teams/
