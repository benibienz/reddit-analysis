Wrong answer. 

The right answer is to revoke the Federal rules that impede Exxon from helping Russia develop its arctic oil fields. That huge oil field coming onto the oil market would keep the price of oil under $70 bbl for the next twenty years. 

Right now the price of oil is low enough that Saudi is eating through its sovereign wealth fund and lowering the dole that it pays to its citizens. Flood the market, the price goes even lower and Saudi eats its whole sovereign wealth fund. The Royal family would be forced to cut people off from cradle to grave funding for everything.

134,"What does Hillary call the following?

Just how many Clinton sex assaults were there? Here is a list of other alleged rapes that are now coming back to haunt Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign:

* In 1972, a 22-year-old woman told campus police at Yale University that she was sexually assaulted by Clinton, a law student at the college. No charges were filed, but retired campus policemen contacted by Capitol Hill Blue confirmed the incident.

* In 1974, a female student at the University of Arkansas complained that then-law school instructor Bill Clinton tried to prevent her from leaving his office during a conference. She said he groped her and forced his hand inside her blouse. She complained to her faculty advisor who confronted Clinton, but Clinton claimed the student ”came on” to him. The student left the school shortly after the incident. Reached at her home in Texas, the former student confirmed the incident, but declined to go on the record with her account. Several former students at the University have confirmed the incident in confidential interviews and said there were other reports of Clinton attempting to force himself on female students;

*Broaddrick, a volunteer in Clinton’s gubernatorial campaign, said he raped her in 1978. Mrs. Broaddrick suffered a bruised and torn lip, which she said she suffered when Clinton bit her during the rape;

* From 1978-1980, during Clinton’s first term as governor of Arkansas, state troopers assigned to protect the governor were aware of at least seven complaints from women who said Clinton forced, or attempted to force, himself on them sexually. One retired state trooper said in an interview that the common joke among those assigned to protect Clinton was “who’s next?” One former state trooper said other troopers would often escort women to the governor’s hotel room after political events, often more than one an evening;

* Carolyn Moffet, a legal secretary in Little Rock in 1979, said she met then-governor Clinton at a political fundraiser and shortly thereafter received an invitation to meet the governor in his hotel room. “I was escorted there by a state trooper. When I went in, he was sitting on a couch, wearing only an undershirt. He pointed at his penis and told me to suck it. I told him I didn’t even do that for my boyfriend and he got mad, grabbed my head and shoved it into his lap. I pulled away from him and ran out of the room.”

* Elizabeth Ward, the Miss Arkansas who won the Miss America crown in 1982, told friends she was forced by Clinton to have sex with him shortly after she won her state crown. Last year, Ward, who is now married with the last name of Gracen (from her first marriage), told an interviewer she did have sex with Clinton but said it was consensual. Close friends of Ward, however, say she still maintains privately that Clinton forced himself on her.

* Paula Corbin, an Arkansas state worker, filed a sexual harassment case against Clinton after an encounter in a Little Rock hotel room where the then-governor exposed himself and demanded oral sex. Clinton settled the case with Jones recently with an $850,000 cash payment.

* Sandra Allen James, a former Washington, DC, political fundraiser says Presidential candidate-to-be Clinton invited her to his hotel room during a political trip to the nation’s capital in 1991, pinned her against the wall and stuck his hand up her dress. She says she screamed loud enough for the Arkansas State Trooper stationed outside the hotel suite to bang on the door and ask if everything was all right, at which point Clinton released her and she fled the room. When she reported the incident to her boss, he advised her to keep her mouth shut if she wanted to keep working. Miss James has since married and left Washington. Reached at her home last week, the former Miss James said she later learned that other women suffered the same fate at Clinton’s hands when he was in Washington during his Presidential run.

* Christy Zercher, a flight attendant on Clinton’s leased campaign plane in 1992, says Presidential candidate Clinton exposed himself to her, grabbed her breasts and made explicit remarks about oral sex. A video shot on board the plane by ABC News shows an obviously inebriated Clinton with his hand between another young flight attendant’s legs. Zercher said later in an interview that White House attorney Bruce Lindsey tried to pressure her into not going public about the assault.

* Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer, reported that Clinton grabbed her, fondled her breast and pressed her hand against his genitals during an Oval Office meeting in November, 1993. Willey, who told her story in a 60 Minutes interview, became a target of a White House-directed smear campaign after she went public.

139,"I think the left and right dichotomy no longer describes the divide between the promoters of a bellicose foreign policy and those who resist the rush to war. Actually I think that the left/right explanation of opposition and acceptance of war as a goal has never been a realistic description of the opponents and proponents of unnecessary war. 

The Vietnam War appears to be an exception because young college men were drafted to go kill and die pointlessly in Vietnam and therefore they were fervently opposed to the war. Most were left leaning (like most college students through the ages), so it appeared that being leftish was causal to the opposition to war. I think that it was just coincidental.


The real dichotomy that explains the rush to war is internationalism (globalism) versus nationalism. All the wars that the USA has entered since WWll have been globalist causes, (and even WWII, because you could argue that American globalists provoked Japan into attacking Pearl Harbor).

150,"I will address your concern. I am the person who started this subreddit many years ago, while George Dubya Bush was still bumbling around, igniting wars around the Mideast. 

My political motivation is primarily to assure individual freedom, which I consider impossible without a truly free market and without unnecessary foreign wars and foreign military treaty obligations. 

As to Trump, I believe that, his being a nationalist with no sense of an American responsibility to protect anyone who is not an American, and a pragmatic attitude towards foreign policy which would be subservient to his goal of improving the US economy means that he would not send us into war for any reason other than destroying ISIS. He would not take an antagonistic approach towards relations with Russia. 

As to his opposition to Muslim immigration to the USA, I think that is a sensible  position to take. You can oppose going to the Mideast to kill hundreds of thousands of Muslims without committing cultural suicide by inviting a mass immigration of Muslims into America.

They end up selling everything, it then gets bought up by a huge agribusiness corporation that pays NO estate tax, mechanizes everything and therefore doesn't even provide jobs for the community.

533,"Check out the sidebar. This subreddit has mostly been focused on America's role as protagonist, antagonist, victim and participant in what the Bush Administration called the Global War on Terror.

At this point, anyone who is not in the pay of Saudi Arabia or Israel will admit that ISIS is actually a clear and present danger to any country that does not have an Islamic government that practices Sharia law. 

By sticking enough straws into the wasps' nest, the USA and its hangers-on has managed to midwife a real danger into existence, as the events in Europe show quite clearly. That danger to the non-muslim countries is ISIS, an unintended consequence of the GWT, and to a lesser degree, al Qaeda (al Nusra).

&gt;...criticize someone from shifting their focus away from ISIS. 

The criticism of Hillary is not just to let ISIS off the hook, it is the fact that she continues to demand the assassination of Assad (there is no way that he would survive regime change) when his government is the only hope for maintaining enough security for the smaller, non-sunni populations in Syria. So Hillary means to destroy the Syrian state, thereby killing or forcing the exit of Druse, Alawites, Shiites and Christians, while perhaps unintentionally (and perhaps not) giving ISIS room and time to regroup. 

This subreddit is exactly the place to discuss these issues, because it is the stupid and erroneous American foreign policy (the Endlesswar) that has caused all this death and waste.

821,"&gt;Most of the former Mujahedeen became affiliates of Taliban (ie, Haqqani network, et. al). 

Exactly right, but after that statement your comment veers into neocon propaganda territory

&gt; ISIS, it's both a hybrid creation of Obama letting Iran have political hegemony over the Middle East by letting Assad have his way if anything as well as al-Maliki's overt antagonization of Sunni Muslims after Obamas cuck disgusting shit decision to withdraw from Iraq.

Nope. Assad had nothing at all to do with the creation of ISIS, nor did Iran. ISIS is a militant *sunni* organization. ISIS was born at Camp Bucca, an American prison for militants in the counterproductive Iraq War. The Americans, in their infinite wisdom, put jihadi Sunnis in the same giant prison camp with ex military officers from Saddam's army, and any number of other sunnis that the Shiite government of Iraq wanted to get out of circulation, thereby creating a giant pool of furious sunnis and created a monster. This was happening under the Bush administration and continued under Obama.

&gt;Don't forget that Obama wheezed and heaved at the cameras in the early stages of the Syrian civil war, exclaiming that if the Assad government uses chemical weapons, US forces would be on the ground.

Syrian forces Did Not use sarin gas.

846,"We are not fighting ISIS. US forces bomb something near Raqqa once in a while. We have not impaired ISIS' ability to hold territory and the reason is that Obama's real goal in Syria is to overthrow the secular Assad government, knowing full well that will lead to an al Qaeda government and the genocide of remaining Christians and Shiites, Druse and Yazidis. ISIS is supported by America's ""ally"", Turkey, as is al Nusra (AKA al Qaeda). There is a lot of talk, but there is no effort to defeat ISIS, and bombing won't do it, although it is part of the operation

Trump is right that ISIS needs to be destroyed, and that means surrounding Raqqa and contiguous ISIS held territory, blow up the perimeter and advance. Encounter resistance, blow up everything and advance. Don't let anyone but women and children get through the perimeter. Bomb and artillery and advance. Eliminate them. I think that this would best be done in conjunction with Russia.

Anything less will just allow ISIS to spread to other areas.

Erdogan needs his leash to be yanked and HARD. Turkey is the arms depot and oil buyer for ISIS. Turkey leads the al Nusra attacks to destroy secular government in Syria. Wake up and kick the renascent Ottoman Empire out of NATO. In like manner, the US should end its friendly diplomacy with Saudi Arabia and the GCC. We no longer need to kneel before the Saudis to guarantee our oil supply. There are dozens of new producers of oil. The Arabs can no longer control the oil market. If they tried to repeat the embargo of 1973, distribution would change to domestic sources, Canada, Venezuela, Brazil, Nigeria and Russia. 

Unfortunately, the idiot West has allowed Islamic jihadism to spread for many years. Its modern origin is Saudi Arabia, but there are cells all over Europe, and adherents all over the world, including the hometown of Disneyworld.

This will be a long fight, but if the US follows the example of Europe, it is a fight that western, liberal, Christian heritage society will lose. Islam will encompass the world.

The entire population depends on the dole. And Saudi is now selling off assets in its sovereign wealth fund. The kingdom is on its way down the drain. There is no longer any need for Saudi oil. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Brazil, Canada, Nigeria etc etc can make up for any oil that Saudi holds back in order to punish the U.S. The Saudis have no real leverage over the US any longer. They still buy Congressmen and Senators who are easy to identify. Anyone who defends Saudi in DC has been bought. Period. 

And don't worry about them selling their Treasuries because they have to sell them. Their oil sales are not covering the state budget. They have had to start liquidating assets in their sovereign wealth fund in order to keep paying their subjects a monthly wage. Once they can no longer pay the people, there will be a lot of the Saud family dangling from lampposts.

Real socialism, as in an economic system wherein a society holds all goods in common and they are distributed equitably among all members of the society is actually the original economic system among human beings. 

All tribal cultures are basically socialist, very little, if anything is owned personally. Everything is shared in ways that are decided by a council of elders or by the chief. 

Work is also signed by the same hierarchy that decides the distribution of goods, shelter and tools. Look at small pre-Columbian American Indian tribes. 

But the key to this successful socialism is that the group is limited in  number, all the members are related by genetics or by marriage, all members share exactly the same culture, religion and language. All members feel bound to each other, because a tribe or a clan is basically just a very large family. We share generously with family, we trust them, they trust us. 

However the distribution of goods and obligations does not work when the size and internal distinctions within the group increase. If, through war and conquest a number of tribes are forced to live together, it will not be peaceful. If the larger group is to hold together, it will require the threat and application of force by special group with close access to the leader or hierarchical council.

In other words, socialism only works when all members of the polity trust that the other members share their values and are honestly and diligently adding to the communal wealth.


Does that sound like the huge, populous, multicultural United States? LOL! The only way to make socialism work in a group that is larger and more divers than a tribe is at gunpoint.

So here's the deal. When the Saudis and the Russians and some big money oil speculators managed to game the oil market in London and send the price over $100 per bbl a whole lot of new projects came on line. 

Brazil's deep water wells in the Atlantic. Russian, Canadian and American arctic oil fields, fracking to extract oil from the huge oil field in the Dakotas, etc., etc.

The deal is that each of these huge new fields has their own cost per barrel to pump, but all the development is already there. So, for instance fracking in the Dakotas is break-even at $45 bbl. Deep water Brazilian extraction is break even at a little over $50 bbl. Arctic pumping is at break even at $65, etc. Get it?

So the price will not, cannot rise continuously.

Just try to treat people equally, based on their their honesty, their industry, their generosity, rather than having a certain set of criteria that you use for black people, for instance *they need my help*, or gay people, or straight white conservative middle class people.

I ask myself about someone with the mind and body to take care of himself, is he or she doing so? If not, why not? We are all in the same boat, if we can row, we ought to row. And that is a judgement taken at a personal level, not smearing your condescension over broad groups of people that you dislike, perhaps Christian white people, or that you champion (with great moral courage and insight) like people with non-traditional sexual practices.

Since about 1995, American military aircraft are designed for one primary purpose and that is to produce cost overruns by using unnecessary but very complex high technology. These planes are designed to milk the cow dry.

The post-modern US warplanes would be mostly useless in a shooting war with a real opponent because their complexity means that their scramble time is not measured in minutes, but rather in hours or days. Another article on this page gives credence to what I say. In a test of readiness that was announced with anticipation, only one out of 6 F-35s could get into the air.

From the point of view of military utility it was absolutely stupid to try to make the plane that does everything. We could have had an improved F-20 Tigershark that would have come off the assembly line at $20 million or less per plane. We could have built scads of them.

During the growth of America, universities unlocked the mysteries of the atom and evolution. They gave voice to serious discussions about economics and political theory. The era of great discoveries and freedom of thought in American (and Canadian and British) universities occurred during the rise and at the apex of American economic and political power. 

But America is now approaching a steepening slope in its decline. As the Roman Empire saw a collapse of intellectual thought concurrent with its political and economic descent, so are America and its satellites showing the effects of the collapse of America's ability to influence global affairs. The psychosis of the young gives testimony to the failure of American culture. 

Empires begin with one people who have a common history, language, culture and religion. They grow, absorbing other cultures along with their religions, customs, values until there is no definable people that populate the empire. There is a polyglot scattering of different peoples, mutually untrusting, mutually uncooperative. This is totally against the imposed new morality of ""political correctness"", but it is the reality.

1613,"&gt; Sorry, but how can you actually say something else - except you don't know what happened in countries like Libya and Egypt?

Well, first of all I didn't say anything about **Egypt**, did I? Egypt is a case where the US aided the Egyptian deep state against Muslim Brotherhood. Israel did not want the Brotherhood on the border of Gaza, so the US abandoned its usual refrain to support democracy and aided the Egyptian military to overthrow the legally elected government of Egypt, killing 2500 people in the process. When Israel is involved, the rules change. 

&gt;Nothing of this kind happened in Libya, just for example. 

Oh really? LMAO! Perhaps you haven't noticed the Daesh now controls a considerable part of Libya and the Libyan ""rebels"" that murdered the staff at the US Consulate in Bengazi were salafists collecting arms to send to Syria.

As for **Libya**, it fits the pattern to a T. A stable authoritarian government in an affluent Muslim country comes under the baleful glare of the masters of the world in France, Britain and the US of A. The authoritarian ruler of the country (with the highest standard of living in the continent of Africa, free university, etc) announces that he will no longer sell oil for dollars, but rather he wants to be paid in gold Dinars (or just in gold). Someone gets the tribes in Bengazi and Muzrata fired up and Gaddafi threatens them and moves to control the uprising. This is not something new and has happened in the past without attracting the Imperial eye, but now things are different and it is decided that Gaddafi must go. It probably doesn't have anything to do with his growing leadership in central and northern Africa. LOL

So the US and Europe bombed Gaddafi's forces into smithereens and armed salafist crazies following the program that you say the US is not using. LOL! The Salafists then proceeded to destroy everything that the people of Libya had constructed, setting the country back to zero and murdering thousands of people. The US also took advantage of the chaos in Libya to collect Libyan weapons by the jihadi crazies and send them to salafist crazies in Syria. 

&gt;And even in **Iraq**, where one could say that 'something roughly similar did happen',  it wasn't really the USA that caused such a development (although the US-led invasion was definitely a sort of 'catalysator'

Iraq is a very different case because unlike Libya and Syria and Somalia the Sunnis are a minority there. So the Sunni jihadists had to contend with the Iraqi army, the Iranians and Shiite militias. They were mostly pushed out of Iraq and into Syria where they became the Islamic State. The Islamic State would never have prospered if the US-Turkish-Saudi supported Sunni uprising against Assad had not kept the Syrian government from policing its easter provinces.

Does it look to you like the people of Syria are now free? How can you so blithely ignore the reality of the results of American policies and instead believe the fairytales that the criminals in the Federal government tell the people? Its one thing to believe them before the fact, for instance believing that W was really intent on freeing the Iraqi people and bringing them the benefits of Jeffersonian democracy. Its another thing to simply ignore the disasters that have followed every single US intervention in the Muslim world in the last 30 years.

Nope, but in every instance in which the US has become involved, the salafist organizations decapitate any other groups and take over the resistance. How many more times does this have to happen before you see the trend?

1622,"&gt; These are the reasons for limited intervention in Syria as listed in the e-mail:

The problem is that the reasons you reposted from the email are all wrong. The reasons are either in Israel's interests and not America's or they are not in either Israel or America's interests

1. The resulting regime in Syria will see the United States as a friend, not an enemy.

The result could not be a regime that is friendly to the United States, unless you think that al Qaeda is America's friend. The email makes no mention of the multicultural nature of Syria, nor the fact that the opposition to Assad was almost exclusively centered in the Sunni community. The regime in Syria that is the result of a civil war waged by Sunni fundamentalists against the Baathist multicultural government will only see the United States as a friend, not an enemy if it allows for the destruction of democracy and the destruction of the peaceful coexistence of different cultures and religions in Syria, giving power to Sunni radicals

2. Washington would gain substantial recognition as fighting for the people in the Arab world, not the corrupt regimes.

This is true and it means that Washington would continue to have close relations with Saudi and Turkey. I am not sure that is a goal that is in the interests of the American people. Of course the corrupt regimes bit has to be overlooked in the case of America's friends (Turkey and Saudi)

3. For Israel, the rationale for a bolt from the blue attack on Iran's nuclear facilities would be eased.

First of all, Israel was well aware that Iran had no nuclear weapons program given that Israel planted all the false evidence that was used to conjure up the Iranian nuclear scare. Secondly, if Iran had had a nuclear weapons program, why would the overthrow of their ally in Syria make it less likely that Iran would use a nuke against Israel? That make no sense whatsoever, in fact the inverse is more logical

4. And a new Syrian regime might well be open to early action on the frozen peace talks with Israel. 

Now we are getting to the reality. Overthrowing the Syrian government is a gift to Israel.

5. Hezbollah in Lebanon would be cut off from its Iranian sponsor since Syria would no longer be a transit point for Iranian training, assistance and missiles.

Again, the destruction of Syria was never about democracy in Syria, it was always about security concerns for the most heavily armed state in the Mideast.

&gt;Call me naive but I'm pretty sure aiding an ally tends to be a goal of nations.

An alliance is a relationship between two parties that is mutually beneficial. That is not the case in the Israel-US ""Alliance"". The US-Israel alliance is not in the interest of the US, and the ""alliance"" is sustained through the subornation of the US Congress by illegal Israel influence peddling.",2016-03-22 10:30:31+00:00,d18ywt8,2.0,t1_d189tkp,51020.0,EndlessWar

1721,"**The inestimable importance of strategic depth**



By Stephen Kinzer   MARCH 05, 2016
NO COUNTRY LIKES having enemies on its borders. Big powers seek to dominate their neighborhoods. Recognizing this drive is essential to understanding the world.

The United States assured its security in North America long ago. Native Americans were suppressed and big-power rivals faded. Vast oceans protect us from most adversaries. We are blessed with what geo-politicians call strategic depth.

Few countries appreciate the value of strategic depth — and the cost of its absence — better than Russia. It has long experience with European invaders, from Napoleon to Hitler. The desire to prevent further invasions led the Soviet Union to subjugate countries in Eastern Europe after World War II. Americans interpreted these moves as the beginning of a Soviet drive for global power. Above all, they were aimed at establishing a band of subservient buffer states to protect the Soviet Union from attack.

Russia still views the world through this lens. It saw NATO’s decision to position military forces along its borders in the 1990s as highly threatening. Today, more able to resist, Russia insists on preventing American troops and nuclear weapons from being deployed in other neighboring states. That is why it is ready to use all means necessary to prevent Ukraine and Georgia from joining NATO. Any Russian leader who did otherwise would be reviled for undermining national security and exposing his country to danger.

China also recognizes the importance of strategic depth. Its efforts to secure the South China Sea are aimed at giving it a corridor of power beyond its own mainland. The United States sees these efforts as aggressive and expansionist. We react by redoubling military support for China’s neighbors and helping them resist Chinese ambitions. That weakens those neighbors’ willingness to accommodate China’s interests, which they might feel inclined to do if we were not subsidizing their defense budgets.

Iran’s policies in the Middle East are another example of the strategic depth doctrine in action. Most Iranians are Shi’ite Muslims. Militant groups in Iraq and Syria consider Shi’ites to be infidels and want to kill every one. Waiting patiently until these groups — ISIS and Al Qaeda — approach the Iranian homeland would be unwise. That is why Iran supports groups fighting against militants in Iraq and Syria. Americans are told that this is part of an Iranian effort to take over the Middle East. It is better understood as forward defense against sworn enemies.

This is a classic security dilemma. Countries take steps to protect themselves, but those steps appear threatening to others. That sets off a spiral of escalating tension. Much of US-Russia, US-China, and US-Iran tension is a result of this spiral. Secure in our own neighborhood, with nothing on our borders but Mexico, Canada, and declining fish stocks, we do not always recognize other countries’ drive for strategic depth.

Machiavelli famously observed that enemies must be either conciliated or annihilated. Translated into modern terms, this means that countries may secure strategic depth by raw power where possible, but where it is not, they should seek to reduce threats by peaceful means. That requires negotiating with adversaries who exercise power on or near their borders.

Turkey and Israel face this challenge. Leaders of both countries see existential threats on their borders: Turkey from Kurdish nationalists, Israel from the Palestinians. Like leaders of all strong states, they want strategic depth. Years of conflict with Kurds and Palestinians, coupled with social and demographic reality, suggest that those threats cannot be suppressed by force. The best way for Turkey and Israel to guarantee their long-term security is through negotiation. Trapped in the paradigm of conflict, however, they pursue policies of confrontation that threaten the strategic depth they legitimately seek to secure.

In his corollary to the Monroe Doctrine more than a century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt declared that the United States would use “international police power” to crush any regime in the Western Hemisphere that defied the United States. Other countries act in accordance with the same principle. Rather than see them only as threatening global order, we should recognize that they have reasons to want to keep enemies away from their borders. The United States long ago secured its strategic depth. We should understand why others seek to do the same.

Don't blame the CIA, their message to the White House was that there was no credible evidence of an Iraqi wmd program. 

And I am sure that no one made it clear to the intellectually challenged W that he was not seeing CIA approved intelligence. That means that the Iraq War was not initiated on the basis of faulty intelligence, but rather it was based on constructed, false evidence.

But China and Chile and every country with VAT, extend a tax credit on all exports against VAT that the company owes the government. In other words, the competitors of the US ship their products to America with no corporate tax burden, while American companies are paying income taxes.

But that control is only in those countries that we call the ""west"", that is Western Europe and the ex-English colonies with the exception of India. Another thing that has happened is that Israel has managed to get the leaders of Saudi Arabia, and thereby the Gulf monarchies, as well as the criminal government of Egypt in its corner.

Obama is responsible for the destruction of Libya and Mali (a consequence of the destruction of Libya) and he has killed thousands of people with drones while deteriorating the security of the USA.

Obama is a fraud. The sooner that we elect a man who knows how to define a problem, design a solution and implement it rapidly and efficiently, the better.

The way things work in DC today, American foreign policy must first and foremost do whatever Israel wants. We all know how that works. [Many books](https://www.amazon.com/Israel-Lobby-U-S-Foreign-Policy/dp/0374531501/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455622548&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+israel+lobby) have been written on the subject. We know that Israel has a predominant influence on American foreign policy and that influence causes the US to do things that are not in America's interest. The US has done a series of counterproductive things, such as the invasion of Iraq, the US intervention to bring on a military coup of the elected Morsi govt. in Egypt and the plan do overthrow the Assad govt. in Syria among other actions that are counter to America's foreign policy interests, but which serve Israel's interests. 

Israel made a decision some years ago that it could triangulate between Riyadh and DC by advocating for Saudi in DC and that way came to an understanding with the Saudi Royal family, and thereby with all the Gulf monarchies. So Israel has taken the side of Sunnis in the millenarian war between Shiites and Sunnis, and what Israel does, DC is obliged to do. 

That is how we find the US stuck in an extremely dangerous situation in which an out-of-control fundamentalist Sunni, nationalist state, which is a NATO member is attacking groups supported by the US and Russia. Israel got the US into a tangle that may blow up the world.

They are wrong, but that is the idea that may cause Marco Rubio to launch on Russia and thereby blow up the earth.

3. Energy security - This has always been a fallacy. Oil is perfectly fungible and the countries that have it lack agriculture and industry. They have to sell it. So we buy it. All you have to have is money

4. Europe can defend itself from Russia, and besides, why would Russia invade Europe. Russia needs Europe as a market. And you're right that Europe's budgets are financed by the US military budget

5. As long as American politicians are elected by promising that the Federal govt. will take care of everything and rule the world the debt will continue to be the greatest danger to the USA.

People act in their best interests. They will not consider that it is in their interests to share with people who do not think like they, who are not related by family, tribe, language, religion, history. This is why socialism works well in very small societies that are not more than five or ten thousand people, closely related by family and culture. They will trust each other enough to share. 

People in a giant multilingual, multiethnic polity who do not share value systems or religion or anything else with many sectors of the population will not share voluntarily with people that they neither know nor trust. Therefore sharing can only happen involuntarily. And that means under the threat of state violence.

A state that has the authority and practical power to force the sharing that people will not do voluntarily will, perforce, come under the control of a cadre of people who will use the state to increase their own power and privilege.

How do you propose to take control of the country's future when everything that any opposition group might do or write or organize will be be vacuumed up and used to disarticulate your nascent movement before it can begin to gather enough momentum to enter into the vision of the American herd? There is no longer any hope of peacefully dislodging the current power groups from the positions of political and economic power in the USA. And there is even less hope of using violence to force change. The American state is armed to the teeth and well staffed with professional killers.

In my opinion, any hope for a return to sane governance in the United States depends on a deep economic and monetary collapse. That might wake up the herd while debilitating the existing power structure . . . but I am not hopeful.

Anyone who is willing to be honest and broad-minded and has read widely about what the US impact on what is happening in the Mideast, Africa and along the borders of Russia, will come to the conclusion that the American ""foreign policy"" is the trigger for most or all of the disasters that are covered here. 

The facts make one determine that the American input into the area in question has radicalized movements and overthrown stable governments that guaranteed order and rights to divers populations. The American ""foreign policy"" is a mishmash of disparate ad hoc actions whose only common ingredient is the killing of loads of innocent people and the destruction of peace and order.

2362,"It is an act of war to refuse to remove your soldiers from another sovereign state's territory when ordered to do so. So, how can the USA blithely ignore the de facto Turkish occupation of northern Iraq? 

Take into account Erdogan's real goal in Northern Iraq. Mosul is very close to Erbil, which is a Kurdish city and part of what is the de facto Kurdish state in Iraq. The Kurds are the perennial enemy of the Turkish state and the Iraqi Kurds almost certainly are aiding groups of downtrodden, embattled Kurds across the border in Turkey. 

Erdogan is not going to leave Mosul because from there he can interdict the flow of arms and other aid to the PKK and other Kurdish separatists in Turkey. 

So what is the USA doing about all this? Various things which are at cross-purposes. 

1. Working directly with the Iraqi Kurds out of Erbil. Read and listen to Mitchell Prothero's reporting from Erbil. 

2. Supporting Turkey in its aggressions against Russia. 

3. Supporting Kurdish resistance to ISIS in Syria.

2551,"&gt; ""Islamic radicals"" is a broad, and very sneaky, term you're using here. But like all uprisings in the Middle East, there will be a contingency of Islamic extremists looking to capitalize, but overall **it was the people**.

You don't know what you are talking about. At all. The opposition in Bengazi and Misurata to Gaddafi was a combination of radical Islamist veterans of Iraq insurgencies and tribes that opposed the domination of Libyan state organizations by the western tribes of Tripoli. Libya is a very new country, it has existed less than 100 years and it was cobbled together by European colonists. [The tribes](http://www.geopoliticalatlas.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/major_tribes_of_libya.png) do not get along with each other, which was the chief reason for the brutality of the Gaddafi regime. It was the only way to keep the European construct of Libya from blowing apart into its non-cooperative component pieces. The same is true of Syria, by the way. 

The Arab Spring was a western notion much more than an Arab reality. Its certain that some educated, urban Arabs took to the streets to demonstrate for more representation in government, but they were not armed and they were quickly supplanted in Libya and everywhere else by people with very different agendas. By not understanding this shift in the ""Arab Spring"", America and Europe ended up supporting the worst of the bad. 

The Iraq War was an evil ploy to get rid of a leader that did not kowtow to universal American hegemony

The Libyan war was the same thing.

In both cases the American Empire and its vassals murdered people by the boatload and destroyed the culture, the infrastructure and the peace. 

&gt; So which is it? Your initial claim that America is responsible for Libya, or is it the mysterious European oil producers?

As in any war waged by a coalition, there isn't one answer to who or what is responsible for the war. America is responsible for the war because it would not have happened without American participation. That does not mean that European oil producers and many other axes of influence did not coordinate to destroy the state with the second highest standard of living in Africa and the best rights and opportunites for women in the Muslim world. 

&gt; You didn't know what the fuck you were talking about and are googling to respond to each of these points, as your original argument falls apart in the face of facts.

...because European oil producers saw Gaddafi switching to Chinese companies

The entrenched power structures that together run the American state are actually quite impervious to change by a crusading executive. And this is especially true in foreign relations/military and intelligence (which are the same thing in 21st century Washington). 

The Services and Departments have a bureaucratic inertia that resists change, and a low key, timid President will not be able to change the direction of the ship of state. 

Obama could have made a difference, but he appointed Powers, Rice and Clinton to the key foreign policy position and they all howled for more war. As an example I give you Libya.

The information is redacted, not because its release could compromise American security, but rather because it shows that Saudi government officials were involved in the planning and operations of the 911 attack on DC and the WTC.

This information is secret because it would force the American state to re-align its foreign policy, distancing the USA from Saudi Arabia and Israel. Those two states have such an inordinate power over the movers in American politics, that they have been able to keep these conclusions secret for over ten years now, and that has made the US govt. chase after exactly the wrong people while supporting those that orchestrated the attack on America.

I imagine that most everyone in Congress knows or at least smells the truth, that Saudi Arabia was actively involved in 911 and that Israel was aware of the plan long before it went operational - and that is why the Senators and Congressmen don't read the 28 pages. I can't find the list of those who have read the famous 28 pages, but if memore serves me it is under ten of our public ""servants"".

Grammar aside, the article is important.

Among people who pay attention, it's been known for years that the huge, slow aircraft carriers would be destroyed in any war with either Russia or China long before they could inflict and serious damage on either. 

It is conceivable that Iranian missiles could hit and disable an American carrier. They keep building them because the arms industries control defense spending. 

Besides being a colossal waste of money the huge spending on aircraft carriers is very dangerous. If the U.S. were to push too hard against China in the South China Sea or against Russia in the Black Sea or the Baltic and shots were exchanged, that could easily end with a sunken aircraft carrier.

2944,"&gt; Rand is saying he doesn't like this particular deal, but he supports negotiating. That is a very reasonable opinion.

The point of what I wrote is obvious, but I will spell it out for you. 

The deal was not negotiated between the US and Iran. It was negotiated between [the P5+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5%2B1) and Iran. If the US reneges on the deal and tries to negotiate another deal, the rest of the negotiating countries will not take part. Russia, China, Germany, France and Great Britain are all satisfied with the deal as is and all of them have said that they will not renegotiate to satisfy Bibi Netanyahu and his acolytes in the US Congress. 

In other words, if the US backs out, there will be no deal, but Russia, France, China and Germany will unilaterally end sanctions against Iran. Britain might follow the US lead, or it might not. Either way, the U.S. CANNOT negotiate a new deal on its own. It would have no teeth because Iran can trade with everyone else in the world and it would not be party to a treaty that imposes IAEA oversight of its nuclear program.

Now do you understand? If so, please tell Dr. Paul, who seems to be Bibi's new acolyte.",2015-07-29 23:33:08+00:00,ctkx07i,5.0,t1_ctkw8pn,1264.0,randpaul

Have you heard what his father says about the deal? 
Do you realize that even if the Senate can force the US out of this deal with Iran, that the other five signatories will not go along? I guarantee that Rand knows that and that makes US backpedaling on this issue ridiculous. 

&gt; when even the democrats are struggling to pass something Obama wants you know the thing is terrible.

The ""thing"" is not terrible. And the democrats are almost as controlled by the Israel lobby as the republicans are.

What do you think will happen if the US government keeps Iran's money and keeps sanctions in place? 

1. Germany, France, China and Britain are not going to go along. They are all lined up for juicy contracts in Iran. 

2. Iran will be under no constraints about the development of a nuclear weapon. They negotiated in good faith and now the other party reneges after negotiating the deal. Do you think that the US should then help Israel bomb Iran when they do not allow IAEA inspectors into their nuclear facilities? Because that would mean another war for the USA and it would mean another loss. Or do you think that the US could reoccupy a country of 120 million people and impose order on those people?

That is true, but misleading. Israel has neither denied nor confirmed having a nuclear weapon https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2010-09-01/bringing-israels-bomb-out-basement

Iran does not have nuclear weapons and now will not be able to without first expelling the IAEA inspectors from the country, giving the world at least six months to decide what, if anything, needs to be done about an Iranian nuclear weapons program.

Israel's nukes are actually a much bigger problem, given that Israel has shown no hesitation to initiate hostilities with its neighbors and launch aggressive wars of conquest while gradually stealing the land of the people of Palestine. 

If Israel would join the NPT, then there would be a recognition of the number and type of Israel's weapons and also an evaluation of Israel's nuclear weapons protocols.

She had done the middle aged Internet romance thing with some American guy in Arizona. They had even talked about marriage, she had been a widow for ten years already. Then for some reason the internet romance ended. This happened months before she applied for a US Visa. When she went for her visa interview she was denied a Visa. The interviewer asked her about her intentions with the guy on the Internet, using his name. But that communication had ended months before she applied for the VISA.

3070,"Look into the [Sykes Picot Accord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes–Picot_Agreement), one of the more damaging stupid ideas to come out of the destructive WWI. Upon the demise of the Ottoman Empire, the French and British decided to divide the spoils of war and cut the mideast into two pieces: one that the French would administer and the other for the British. Syria was the greater part of the French portion of the spoils of war. Like the British part, the boundaries of these new polities took into no consideration the ethnicities, language groups and religious boundaries that had existed for centuries. That is where the problem of Syria and Iraq began.

Given the seething caldron of tribes, religions, etc. neither the British nor the French were able to maintain control of their ""Mandates"".

The Baathist Party, controlled by the Assads, led Syria from the time of its independence from France in 1946. The country that the Baathists took control of was ethnically, religiously and linguistically divers. Many of the tribes and ethnicities were perennial enemies. The only way to maintain peace and order and assure that the majority Sunnis didn't kill all the other tribes was through rigid order, imposed with brute force. With time the people accepted the Baathist rule more or less willingly because it assured security. The Christians, Druse, Alawites and Shiites understood that the Baathists made it possible for them to live in a country whose majority was Sunni. 

So, now I will answer your question. Given that the ethnicities in Syria no longer have physical boundaries that would allow each of them to have their own polity, the best alternative for Syria and Syrians was Bashar al Assad. But now, Syria is coming apart and there is no way to put it back together again. Even so, the Assad regime is basically the only hope for Syrian Christians, Druse, Alawites and Shiites. Assad will be overrun and the Sunnis will kill the other ethnicities or force them to emigrate, losing everything that they had ever worked for.",2015-07-08 18:53:27+00:00,cswhte1,6.0,t1_cswdep6,6284.0,randpaul

3129,"&gt; The latter option, favored by socialists, is to abolish private property in the capitalist sense by the working class simply taking control of the means of production for themselves and dispossessing the capitalist owners of their private property....

...until the workers who took over the company decide they need more workers, but decide that the new workers will not receive either the same wages or the ownership title of the company, in which case the first workers simply become the capitalists. The only way to avoid that is through state coercion and that leads you to state ownership of everything, poverty and oppression.
