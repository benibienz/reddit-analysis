However, Ted Cruz  does not live in magic fairyland like Bernie and he cannot be judged in the way that we might be lenient on the old crazy guy. When Ted Cruz blames MoveOn's violence on Donald, he knows exactly what is happening. Ted Cruz might even be privy to the discussions that took place at Sea Island Georgia last week and that certainly were the birthplace of this attack on Trump.

This was the means through which Athenian electors were selected for governmental positions. It would create a Congress that actually reflects the different political philosophies in the state, rather than the party system that eliminates any aspirants that don't cleave to orthodox political positions. 

People in ""democratic"" states are lambasted with propaganda that they are the critical piece in the machinery that selects lawmakers and administrators. But in any polity larger than a town, that is clearly false. In a gigantic, divers state, such as the USA, the idea that the government is selected democratically is absurd. The party system allows for the purchase of elected positions through massive expenditures in advertising, control of the news media and the support of the entire state bureaucracy. It is designed or has evolved to protect itself. 

On the other hand, a nation could institute a system of preselection by testing aspirants' knowledge of history, the legal code, the Constitution, the legislative process, etc. and then adding each aspirant that successfully completes the exam to the list of approved aspirants in each respective district. 

On the day in which people now waste a couple of hours in the charade of voting, random selection of legislators that had passed the exam would take place in each district. These men and women would reflect much more realistically the diversity of political ideas in the country than we have now. And even more importantly they would all arrive at their positions without having bonded themselves to special interests. They would not have acquired any debts, either monetary or otherwise to political parties or kingmakers. Sheldon Adelson would no longer have any influence over the state. 

Of course this would never occur in the USA without a revolution first because the entrenched powers depend on the current system to maintain power",PoliticalPhilosophy,Does the electoral system by organized parties really lead to democracy?
