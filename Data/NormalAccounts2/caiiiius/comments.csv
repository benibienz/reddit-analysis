8,"u/PurpleLugia 's comment is almost correct. Dark, Steel and Fairy moves/pokemon exist in Go, but not in Gen 1. Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff are Normal/Fairy in the main series games too, not just Go, and on Go Clefairy and Clefable are Fairy type, as they are in the main series. The sentence regarding Magnemite and Magnteon is correct.

The appraisal feature, and the fact that it doesn't tell you the exact stats, is faithfully imported from the main series games too, as you said.

Other additions are many of the moves, for example Dragon Breath (introduced Gen 2), Ice Shard (introduced Gen 4) and Play Rough (Gen 6). 

Another feature in Go that is not in Gen I are Pokémon Eggs, which were introduced in Gen 2. 

Go is Gen 1 Pokémon but all of the other features, besides abilities, suggest Gen 6. That's why it's expected, abilities are one of the only things that seem to be left out.",2016-09-13 00:00:29+00:00,d7kajjy,2.0,t1_d7k888w,3345,TheSilphRoad

His arm was limited too as he couldn't plant his feet to throw with much power.

If you're confident you can win your matchup without relying on Hilton to get 132 yards and a touchdown, then leave him on the bench, it's the safest play.

I don't think either Joel or Ahren can be considered part of metalcore's best vocalists, and I think a return/change to a style like that would hide some of their shortcomings (how many high/low notes does Joel hold on TCBH? His vocals are very same-y, and Ahren doesn't do much to utilise his vocal range). 

Additionally, see Dan's solo in I Bring The Weather With Me for evidence that he can play much more complex stuff than what they currently play, there's no barrier there. If you've not noticed Ryan's drumming, then I don't know what's wrong with you.

Firstly, this role suits Dragonite more as its power comes from his insane Attack stat, which can be utilised more easily when attacking. Additionally, while Dragonite is very powerful, even weaker Ice types like Dewgong can tear it to pieces. Being able to flat-out avoid matchups like this by using it on offense rather than defense allows Dragonite to pull its weight more.

There's also the point that the most effective strategy to gain pokecoins (for many people, the point of gyms) is to take numerous gyms within a short time period because holding gyms for a long time is close to impossible. A Dragon Breath Dragonite is far more useful here. 

There's reason enough to be disappointed with a Steel Wing Dragonite - while he can help you hold one gym, a Dragon Breath Dragonite is a versatile attacker that overpowers anything that isn't a specific counter.",2016-09-10 21:08:40+00:00,d7hdx9j,4.0,t1_d7hd71u,1145,TheSilphRoad

77,"1) You're right, I'm not in 'ELO Hell' because I was gaining ELO with every role when I first started Ranked, it's possible to even get a few NK victories when I was 1200-1300 as Town has a much lower win percentage than at high ELO. While I'm sure good players can get consistently unlucky enough to end up in 'ELO Hell', I'm not in 'ELO Hell' and so this doesn't affect me. 2) Whilst you usually have to wait a couple minutes for Ranked, with privately hosted lobbies you need to wait for a couple minutes for the lobby to fill up, *after* a host has appeared and set up a lobby etc. It's easy for a private lobby to take at least as long, or longer, than Ranked in reality. I'd be willing to wait if the games were worth it, though. I personally enjoy the Ranked role list, it's quite balanced (unless you're the NK) so that doesn't affect me too much. I'd rather stay away from the All Any etc. lobbies I saw being made. 3) Well then, can I ask what you did/are doing about these incidents that occurred yesterday (I know you were present in the discord group when they happened because you were talking at the time)? The incident with the blackmailer who AFK'd, the incident with the jailor who AFK'd, the Arsonist who gamethrew for the second Arsonist, the Medium who gamethrew by writing the name of another townie in their will to fake a disguiser. These four things were called out in the discord and the only response I saw from you throughout these incidents being brought up and complained about was ""don't AFK or I'll kill you"" followed by an emoji. Whatever your safeguards or deterrents are, they appear to be worse than that of Ranked, which is just another reason to keep playing Ranked.

One manager had had a total of 70+ points deducted, whilst on the other end of the spectrum another manager had never taken a hit. The average was 28 (or 7 total additional transfers). Over 34ish GWs that's taking a hit roughly every five gameweeks.

You can be successful with either strategy. Obviously, if you're going to be successful when taking hits, the player you transfer in must make up the points you've lost. I'm happy to take points deductions where it works and where it makes sense. Last week, for example, I took a -4 by transferring Hazard in for KDB (I'd started with KDB to allow myself to downgrade if Hazard started well). Hazard got 11 points whilst KDB got 6, and so I gained points despite taking the hit, and have a player I want to keep going forwards.",2016-09-03 19:13:56+00:00,d78a8wp,1.0,t3_50ymdg,23880,FantasyPL

Sure he could become good in Minnesota, but we've seen nothing to suggest that so far in his career, that's why multiple teams have been willing to move on from him.

96,"Bradford's contract expires after next season, and depending on how Wentz develops, Philly might've want to move on from him sooner due to his cap hit and if they could extract trade value from him. Bradford is a guy with zero medium to long term future in Philly. Everyone knows that Philly want him gone and would be willing to enter trade negotiations with anyone. Everything I've just said decreases Bradford's trade value, even if you consider him worth a 1st and a 4th in a vacuum (which may be a hard value considering his mediocre career metrics and his injury history). 

The Vikings overpaid, which suggests one of a couple things to me. Either the injury to Bridgewater (we've heard about how the actions of the trainers may have saved his leg from amputation) is worse than even some of the most pessimistic outlooks, and there's a very real chance he'll not be ready for 2017 either (if he's ready ever), or that the Vikings are willing to do anything to win this season. I feel the second scenario is unlikely, due to the general attitude of Minnesota's staff (redshirting draft picks, building a talented and stable roster for the future, generally conservative FA strategy etc.) and so I'm extremely worried for Bridgewater. You don't pay this much for a one year rental unless you think he'll win you the Super Bowl this year.

EDIT: I'll punctuate this with a few stats to show just how not-an-elite-QB Sam Bradford is. Credit to u/Wouesed56 for the first one. 

20 QBs have had 2000+ pass attempts since Bradford was drafted (eliminating the various draft busts and backups from these stats). This is where he ranks in several metrics: 

20th in Y/A, NY/A, ANY/A

20th in passer rating

20th in TD%

18th in completion %


May I remind you that the stats that most determine who wins a football game are turnover differential, followed by passer rating differential. QBs with a low passer rating do not win games. Bradford's career W/L is 25-37-1. You know, less than Matt Cassel, Derek Anderson, Brian Hoyer and only marginally above Christian Ponder. Even the guy he just replaced, Shaun Hill, wins more games than Bradford does. Remind me why he's worth a 1st and a 4th, please?",2016-09-03 16:59:17+00:00,d78570z,3.0,t1_d784p04,792,nfl
97,"Have a few thoughts on this regarding both teams.

Minnesota: How bad is Teddy's knee? There were reports that action by the trainers saved his leg from amputation, is there a serious and substantial risk he'll never play football again? There's no way you give up this much for Bradford unless you intend or expect him to start for more than just this year. Huge, and very intriguing implications on how they'll draft with Teddy's future (seemingly) so uncertain.

Philly: How do you get this much for Bradford? Drafting Wentz shows a clear intention to move on from Bradford to Wentz at some point in the short term - his contract expires after next season and it seemed pretty clear that the Eagles would never extend Bradford with Wentz waiting in the wings. This is a guy who's hitting free agency in a maximum of two years, perhaps even one if Philly is desperate for cap room and/or Wentz looks ready. His market value is not this high, Philly may have even been actively shopping him (which would only devalue him further). The Bradford/Foles trade has gone from somewhere in-between ""everyone loses"" and ""minor win for Philly"" to a clear win for Philly, in this light. They crippled themselves for Wentz but now have a chance to build a stronger team around him, can't wait to see how they use the pick. ",2016-09-03 16:49:18+00:00,d784te8,1.0,t3_50z4tb,6984,NFL_Draft

The worker's rights we so often hear about are less than that that already exist within UK law (though, granted, the meagre EU worker's rights are more entrenched). The EU is more committed to liberal, free market principles than the UK generally is, as evidenced by the fact that one of the key principles of the EU is to facilitate free trade, whereas in the UK privatisation and other free market principles are far less popular. 

Analysis of other measures of liberalism v socialism both within the EU and within the individual member states (e.g. rates of taxation) further serve to challenge the view of this being a case of ""rather liberal Brits"" opposing ""rather socialist continentals"". The EU is a generally liberal (and arguably, very liberal) organisation that is supported by the majority of both liberals generally, and the liberal right within both the UK and the EU.

[Option A](https://gyazo.com/3a12ef7cb1f4a5f7e7ce8cda2c1fb4c5.png): Valencia/Baines in for Funes Mori, Costa in for Aguero. Aguero returns after his ban. Could also avoid the 4 point hit and transfer out Funes Mori next week.

[Option B](https://gyazo.com/17e8becf561f459f58d54ed5c83bb005.png) or I can use my wildcard and bring in Ozil whilst still leaving enough to bring back Aguero, as well as remove an ineffective Tadic.

145,"I disagree with the notion that what works at high elo doesn't work at low elo. Whilst it's true for all games that good players can win easily at low elo, this effect can be exaggerated by claims that it's like playing a different game. The essence of this game is to claim a role and defend/prove your claim, and all players use their powers of deduction to work out whether or not their claim seems believable, some just do it with less skill than others. Voting for roles would ""work"" at low elo, the reason it isn't done is because of the players, not the strategy, who, as evidenced by this post and others, don't understand the strategy. 

I personally think VFR is far more fun than the games which are silent aside from accusations until a role call on day 5+, as it very much feels like TI v mafia and when I played ranked practice with friends and roll something like escort, I feel comparatively weak as I don't have role claims to inform my roleblocks. Whether I win or not is down to others, I can't convince town to lynch the Medium claim because he's only claimed that to the Jailor, or something similar. But I understand any personal preferences (though, once again, the post I was replying to was concerned primarily with the effectiveness of the strategy). 

BMG did actually limit the number of lynch attempts in a day to combat VFR because of its effectiveness. It was another 1.5 change. ",2016-08-24 17:46:01+00:00,d6ux78t,3.0,t1_d6uuwv1,3315,TownofSalemgame
146,"Voting For Roles is only criticised by people who haven't played high elo games or don't understand the reasoning behind it. 

I'd be quick to point out that in high elo games, voting for roles happens every game. In all video games played competitively, there is a meta followed at the highest level. Go watch a professional CS:GO game, or look at the construction of teams at high elo/in tournaments on Smogon, etc etc. I'm sure you can think of many more examples in games you know well. Certain unwritten rules are followed by everyone playing, there is a general acceptance of ""the best"" way to play the game, and this is always supported by compelling evidence, because many people (in certain games, at high levels) do it for a living and so their livelihood depends on them employing good in-game strategy. While no-one plays Salem competitively, the same logic applies. There are people at the top of the ladder who play for many hours a day, and play rigidly and mechanically - they know, through deduction and experience, the way you are ""supposed"" to play. 

So, as we've established, for some reason, the best Town of Salem players believe voting for roles, as often as possible, to be the best strategy. Rather than assuming that they are wrong, let's look at the best way to win a game of Town of Salem. 

As I'm sure you remember, the Mayor dominated Town of Salem. The Mayor has unique (in the form of not hearing whispers, inability to be healed by doctors) nerfs, before and after patch 1.5, because it was the most powerful role in the game, and the existence of a mayor improved the town's winning percentage by more than that of any other role. 

Why is that, exactly? Because the Mayor forced everyone to claim a role. There are fifteen players, and only a few roles possible to claim (when the town has a majority). Everyone who's ever been in a pre-1.5 mayor game knows the drill - as soon as everyone is forced to claim, the list of suspects reduced dramatically. Only one Jailor claim? Confirmed town. Only two TI claims? Confirmed town. Only one TK claim? Confirmed town. Scum are forced to claim a slot on the role list that another player already occupies. You know how mayor games worked and why they were successful, with everyone's claims you can just compare them to the role list and there is no scenario in which a mafia member can evade suspicion should the town claim appropriately because their only way to avoid being killed is to have town lynch the cc, confirming themselves as mafia. 

The same logic and reasoning is why voting for roles works. Everyone is forced to eventually claim. The remaining town can then simply use their powers of deduction to compare their claims to the role list. The game is not conducted on the back of the two TIs, instead the entire town is able to determine who is scum. Additionally, TP know who to protect and TI who to investigate, as, like with mayor games, scum are forced to claim a contested spot on the role list. 

Any strategy that forces role claims in a set role list will always be successful, because it forces scum to claim early and reveals information to the whole town, not just the TIs. Your post is not written with an understanding of the strategy itself, or with a particular understanding of the role list or the game itself. Information is key, not whether or not the jailor is alive (should it come to that). 

You as an individual (the ""why should I tell you my role"" defences are particularly poignant here) are not nearly as valuable as information allowing the town to lynch an evildoer. There are 2 TIs, 2 TS, 1 TK, 1 TP, an RT and an Any for the mafia/neutrals to claim (of which there are usually six). This means that you have up to 14 people trying to claim just seven confirmed town roles, and every person who is killed in the night, or is lynched, gives you more information with which to solve the puzzle. Voting for roles is an objectively effective strategy. ",2016-08-24 16:26:58+00:00,d6utsn7,1.0,t3_4zc5fk,16894,TownofSalemgame

187,"I think you've missed my point somewhat. The reason that 3-4-3 and 3-5-2 are such popular formations, and the reason this sub is so sold on cheap defenders, like Friend and Amat for example, is because defenders generally represent poor value for money. Even if Walker/Valencia are two of the highest scoring defenders this year, there will be defenders who cost 4.5 or 5.0 currently who will outperform them relative to their value - a good example is (m)any of the WHU, Southampton and Leicester defenders last year, who started out at £4.5m or £5m but went on to match or exceed (at least, relative to their value) the performances of big name, expensive defenders. A similar result can also be achieved by rotating £4.5m or £4m defenders who play for smaller clubs who have favourable fixtures.

Downgrading each of the players I mentioned could've given you up to or more than £3m to improve the rest of your team. Perhaps you're really sold on Deeney and Gray but you could've upgraded one of them to your choice of Lukaku/Costa/Rooney/Vardy, or even made further adjustments and acquired Kane or Ibra. Alternatively, you could've had your pick of every single midfielder in the league to replace one/more of Hazard, Mahrez and Eriksen.

Fischer is unproven in the PL and a new signing so he'll likely have to impress in training/limited action and benefit from a drop in form from a starter before he plays significant game time. My advice would be to ignore the Middlesbrough midfield outside of Ramirez until things look settled. Fischer will likely drop in price before you reap any rewards from him so if you're eyeing a £5.5m replacement then it may be advisable to transfer him out as I doubt he will start GW2 either.

259,"I don't dislike this squad but there's a few tweaks you could make (without overhauling the overall philosophy) that would really strengthen it. 

A 3-4-3 team works because high scoring midfielders and strikers are really high scoring. Yet DDG, Valencia and Walker are some of the more expensive defenders. Downgrading a couple (or all three) of these by £0.5m (or even £1m) would free up a significant amount of budget to invest in your midfield and attack. 

The obvious place to spend this extra budget is on your attack. The success of your team is reliant on Gray and Deeney outperforming their current value. Yet Burnley and Watford are both in the bottom six for [fixture difficulty](http://imgur.com/gallery/X852W) through the first five games. Alternative budget options with much more favourable fixtures over the period include Long and Negredo, the latter in particular.

I'd consider downgrading a couple of your defenders and using the money to upgrade Iwobi or Capoue into someone more deserving of playing time in your lineup.

The highlight was (as it has been since Chasing Ghosts) Ryan's drumming, his drumming remains stellar but as with every other instrument on the album, it felt very safe. I'm not asking for Marc Okubo-esque guitar work to come in but Youngbloods and Chasing Ghosts had some moments where the instruments were overpowering and punchy (Fire or Knife comes to mind immediately). Here everything quite easily melted together as there weren't really any defining or notable riffs/instrumental sections on the entire album.

It's pretty much what we've come to expect from Amity at this point - nothing new other than a few more poppy elements than the last album. All the same tropes rear their heads again (the mostly rigid structure, choirs, the same breakdown used again and again).

He did some pretty detailed track-by-track discussions on the lyrics of [Youngbloods](http://loudwire.com/amity-affliction-track-by-track-breakdown-contest/) and [Chasing Ghosts](http://us.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/amity-joel-20120924) a few years back and most of his lyrics are drawn from pre-Youngbloods, when things were at their worst but he was far less open about it. A running theme throughout Chasing Ghosts in particular is that no matter the extent of his depression, he will never commit suicide because he's moved past that and made progress, encouraging his listeners to do the same should they feel that way.

Whilst I have the greatest sympathy for Joel's struggles and wholly support the positive overall message and all the work he's done and is doing for people struggling with mental health issues, let's not pretend he's somehow unable to write about anything other than depression.

267,"I disagree, there's a lot more variation comparing LF//LT with All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us than when comparing Chasing Ghosts with LTOTM. 

First point to make is that this ignores why Architects can get away with it and Amity can't. Architects aren't generic overall, have more varied instrumentation (especially on LF//LT, which made use of lots of additional instruments, for example), have more unique vocals, a more diverse spectrum of lyrical themes and more than one breakdown, for starters. 

Whereas: Amity don't just rely on the same structure, it's an already overdone style in which they play the same riffs and the same breakdowns over and over. Ahren's choruses are particularly unimaginative. Similarly, they have essentially one lyrical theme and the vocal delivery of Ahren/Joel lacks any pitch or variety. 

More songs stand out as deviating from a core structure among the last two Architects albums (Colony Collapse, Youth Is Wasted On The Young, The Distant Blue, Nihilist, Gone With The Wind and Memento Mori probably being the best examples) compared to Chasing Ghosts/LTOTM (what do we really have here? I guess you can argue Life Underground simply because Ahren sings first, Death's Hand because the breakdown comes sooner, Give It All simply because it's not 3:30-4:30 long and so they clearly found some extra things to fill the song with? That's really it). 

I see the point you're making, and I think it's best evidenced when listening to, say, the first 5 songs on LF//LT, but I don't think it (the comparison, at least) stands up to much scrutiny.

310,"I don't know if that's necessarily the case. Personally, I always saw Miliband's Labour as Tory-lite. The 2015 election manifesto was remarkably similar to the Conservative manifesto, the only notable difference was the money the Tories said they'd raise from unspecified cuts - as such, that was the main thing Labour attacked the Conservatives from during the campaign.

This ""Tory-lite"" image was further exposed in one of the debates held by the party leaders sans the Tories and the Lib Dems, the governing parties. Debates with the SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru exposed just how far from the political left Labour's 2015 manifesto was, in which Miliband's only real counter to these parties was that Labour are not the Tories.

I think there was a big difference in how the media reported Labour's 2015 campaign, and the reality of Labour's 2015 campaign.",2016-07-22 13:52:20+00:00,d5mbm3w,7.0,t1_d5m92hw,4498,ukpolitics
311,"Firstly, your situation is entirely hypothetical because there will never be a means of preventing scams effectively. Niantic will never endorse this because it's against their ToS, and cannot endorse it because of the bad publicity it will bring (try looking at the reaction of the media/the general population to the sale of virtual items. Do you think Niantic will publicly endorse and allow it to occur?). 

Therefore, you will be relying on an outside, profit-driven organisation to manage your exchanges, with little legal recourse should things go wrong (many different countries have a lack of legal precedent with regards to the sale/trading of virtual items). This unregulated holding market would surely be exploitative (for an example of an exploitative, unregulated virtual item market, see all the gambling/betting/trading items for CS:GO skins that were recently closed/asked to close). Both the buyer and the seller would be at the mercy of this for-profit organisation in an area where few/no laws exist.

Even if we entertain the idea that this is possible, we encounter other problems. Unlike many F2P games with microtransactions, currently, people willing to spend vast amounts of money do not have as much of an advantage when compared to other popular mobile games like Clash of Clans, for example. You can level up faster, and find more pokemon, but you can never use money to completely bypass gameplay or obtain otherwise unobtainable items/pokemon. 

The ability to buy and sell pokemon being introduced would completely change this. Overnight, those willing to spend the requisite amount of money would have a team of max CP, perfect IV Vaporeon, Dragonite, Snorlax etc. with perfect movesets. Whilst the competitive aspect of this game is somewhat limited, this person would be better equipped to attack any gym in their area than anyone else, and more likely to perform a successful defence. Additionally, people would begin recognising their username and a further wall of defence would be constructed as people would begin avoiding their gyms. 

Currently, without the ability to obtain pokemon you did not catch yourself, all the money in the world won't get you a perfect IV Dragonite if you can't find enough Dratini/Dragonair/Dragonite in your area. With this feature added, you would be able to simply buy 125 Dratini to transfer so you can evolve your Dratini into a Dragonite. It encourages you not to go out and search for the pokemon you want, because this carries a considerable risk of failure. Instead, you can achieve a 100% success rate by using money. When teambuilding, buying pokemon online becomes a better option than searching for them or hatching eggs in 100% cases. It rather goes against the point of Pokemon Go for the best strategy to obtain high level pokemon to be sit-inside-on-eBay-or-another-similar-website-just-buying-them.

If the game ever becomes more competitive, or there are any kind of individual events dependent on your pokemon's ability, a team that is entirely perfect IVs will have a marked advantage over anyone else. Should these events become popular enough, or playable from home, the userbase will be enormous, and so the (best) participating trainers will all have a team of perfect IV pokemon that they bought. To allow the purchasing of pokemon could create a paywall on competitive/event play where it is necessary to spend money if you want to compete. Whilst a paywall on competitive play could be justified as a feature in a F2P game, this is a paywall created by the users/traders, from which Niantic would not profit from at all. Microtransactions allow Niantic to improve Go and potentially implement/organise competitive play/events, but outside transactions only have the potential to hurt these aspects of the game.

The purchasing of pokemon benefits no-one in game except the buyer, and has the potential to seriously damage the experience of everyone else, especially if they are playing F2P.",2016-07-22 11:14:01+00:00,d5m7117,7.0,t1_d5m5s90,3912,TheSilphRoad

Besides, they haven't been shy about directly countering broken mechanics, either.

Fairy types were introduced to counter Dark, Fighting and Dragon types, the most powerful and popular types in Gen V. Nerfing something in the name of game balance is not only the only sensible thing to do, there is actually precedent for it when looking at the main series games.

Secondly, I'm not even sure how you came to the conclusion that Vaporeon should be the best, regardless. I've no idea how you came up with that list of pokémon better than/comparable to Vaporeon - Dragon Dance wasn't even a thing in Gen I, and neither were abilities, so I don't know why you're referring to them as being reasons for Gyarados and Dragonite being good in Gen I. Gyarados wasn't even good in Gen I, because it is a physical attacker and this was prior to the physical/special split in Gen IV - until Gen IV Gyarados was practically useless. 

The best pokémon in Gen I were the (viable) Psychic types, most notably Alakazam, followed by Gengar, followed by special sweepers (due to the fact special attack and special defence were not separate stats yet). There is no need for Pokémon Go to deliberately handicap itself by adopting all of the aspects of Gen I that made it deeply flawed (none of which, by the way, are the things you actually referenced). 

To follow your advice would be to deliberately make the game worse in order to best represent a twenty year old game that does not stand the test of time and was far outclassed by its remake.

Picked up Paras at Mt. Moon and as soon as it was possible I raced down to pick up Venonat and Scyther respectively. Parasect and Beedrill are both absolutely awful and a huge handicap. I didn't have to overlevel myself too much to beat the game but it was very much a three man team reliant on Venomoth and Butterfree spamming sleep powder and relied on Scyther sweeping everything that couldn't be beaten in this way.

Points that were particularly hard included Blaine's gym (had to get lucky with sleep powder in order to stand a chance) and Lance/Bruno in the elite four due to the rock types and Aerodactyl's high speed shutting down sleep powder attempts.

Overall I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it.

393,"I think it largely depends on what type(s) normal is super effective against. Only being resisted/ineffective against rock, steel and ghost already make it decent coverage, especially for STAB. Considering the high damage moves like return etc. we see more normal moves as coverage, resulting in a meta that does slightly more damage (and therefore favours offense slightly more). 

Then of course there's the effect on normal type Pokemon that make an appearance in the meta. Pokes like m-Kanga and m-Lopunny are popular because they can do high neutral damage. They all naturally rise in viability a tiny bit but again the key is what type normal is super effective against. If it's super effective against a check or a counter to a viable normal type, that Pokemon's usage goes way up. 

I don't think it would be the most impactful change ever, but it's important to note that the normal type as it is is something that the meta is built around. The butterfly effect of a few Pokemon becoming more viable is then balanced out by a rise in usage of their checks and counters. I don't think the game overall changes massively, but what is popular and viable does change.  ",2016-06-22 10:09:37+00:00,d4j70ch,1.0,t3_4p9awt,12882,stunfisk

Speaking of causes for concern, what about RT? We've never seen D.J. Humphries play a regular season game and Arians was critical of him in the media last year. And, in the case of the offensive line, there are criticisms elsewhere, unlike in the secondary. Will Veldheer bounce back from his (comparative) down year in which he was called for holding seemingly every other drive? What about the center position? 

That's why other areas of the team are as bad/worse, because they have similar questions/concerns surrounding one or more of the positions, without the elite players we have elsewhere in the secondary.",2016-05-31 15:36:17+00:00,d3qhasc,5.0,t1_d3qfdr4,2715,AZCardinals

Why not add a filter for bands like these, then people who want to see these posts can see them, and people who don't want to, don't have to.

However, as many communists will rush to tell you, communism has NEVER been implemented in any country. Especially not the USSR, with regards to which there is debate as to whether it was even socialist at all - it has been labelled by many as 'state capitalist', as the power did not lie with the workers (as it would in a socialist society), rather, with the state.

Additionally, communism is not centralised at all. What many people see as communist (socialist states) is centralised, however communism is another section of the ideology entirely. Communism is anarchic in nature and therefore extremely decentralised.

492,"I don't think it's as clear cut as it's made out to be - if the ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" aspect was true as often as is sometimes claimed, almost every band could justifiably criticised in that regard, either for not progressing or for progressing.

Instead, I think it depends almost entirely on the band and the specific change/lack thereof in question. I'll reference a couple of examples that you mention in your post. Northlane could've gotten away with making another album that sounded like Discoveries, and/or another album that sounded like Singularity, because these albums were diverse, and creative, and each song had unique aspects. You weren't tired of Northlane's sound after listening to Discoveries because some tracks were heavier (like Dispossession), some were more ambient (like I Shook Hands With Death), they were almost all unique with regards to Adrian's vocals (tracks like Exposure showing his full range and his cleans, for example). They didn't need to change from Discoveries to Singularity (or from Singularity to Node) because the sound wasn't tired, or poorly done. If Northlane made Discoveries 2.0 we'd all lap it up. Fans criticised the change in style both from Discoveries to Singularity and from Singularity to Node because they hadn't yet fully explored each style, there was more they could've made and done within the style. Every song on both Discoveries and Singularity had some unique element to it.

Conversely, a band that should change is The Amity Affliction. Whilst the community is almost united in the criticism that at this point TAA have become very safe, very predictable and very unimaginative there is still lots of love for both Youngbloods and Chasing Ghosts (more so before LTOTM/the bonus tracks). This is because that whilst Chasing Ghosts sounds similar to Youngbloods, there are some elements of progression, the sound is darker and heavier, for example. Whilst it very much sounded like their previous work, there were aspects of the album that sounded new and inventive. On both albums there was varied song structures/vocal styles/interplay etc. LTOTM, though, lacks this. The most memorable songs are those where they tried something new (such as Pittsburgh), because songs like Skeletons you knew exactly what was coming the whole way through, it was a rehash of what you'd already heard. There was nothing new or inventive - at this point, even to dedicated fans nothing stands out. At this point they've already done everything they can do within the confines they've created for themselves, and that's why it's lacklustre. Bands like ADTR and ABR have never gone through dramatic stylistic changes, yet remain popular and release albums loved by their fans because whilst they retain many of their core principles, they are different enough that the criticism isn't levelled at them. There's a difference between not progressing and playing it safe to the extent that you hinder the artistic quality of your work.

I think it's much more complex than a simple ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" and it really depends on the artist and their work/s in question. Both criticisms are definitely valid in certain contexts. Shit, I wrote a bit much.",2016-04-22 00:23:07+00:00,d2cfo6o,1.0,t3_4fv1ze,12834,Metalcore
493,"If absolute poverty fell, then why, as referenced above, was there a decrease in the number of households that possessed simply the *necessities* expected in ordinary life?

I do not dispute that there were those who were positively affected by Thatcherite policy, or that absolute poverty is a greater evil than relative policy. If absolute poverty was eliminated by those who were in absolute poverty becoming simply relatively poor, then Thatcherism could perhaps be deemed as a success. 

However, there are two faults here. Firstly, the fact that 70% of the population became poorer, in relative terms. Whilst relative poverty is not as abhorrent as absolute poverty, there must be a justification for a reduction in quality of life for 70% of the population. This justification is the supposed elimination, or great reduction of, absolute poverty. As demonstrated by myself and others (and not directly challenged or disproved by you at any point in this thread, as far as I can see), this was not achieved. 

The practical reality is that relative poverty dramatically increased, with little measurable positive impact on anyone except the elite.",2016-04-18 11:13:03+00:00,d27dk7w,12.0,t1_d27d8ck,1101,ukpolitics
494,"Yes, and in considering the high cost of living in the UK in comparison to much of the world, referencing the international poverty line is not meaningless. Having your citizens defined as impoverished, regardless of the metric, can hardly be described as a success.

If living standards increased for those within reach of the policies, and those beyond the scope were unaffected, then why is research almost united with regards to the assertions that Thatcherism increased both poverty and inequality? [Figure 3](http://www.poverty.ac.uk/editorial/more-unequal-country) references living standards specifically, and states, ""These surveys find that using a measure of poverty based on the public’s perceptions of necessities, there has been a rise in the proportions of people falling below these publicly set minimum standards"". This is generally explained by the [highest unemployment levels ever recorded by the ONS](http://charts-datawrapper.s3.amazonaws.com/pUNSF/index.html?rev=94#embed) and that, as referenced by [Figure 1 here](http://www.poverty.ac.uk/editorial/more-unequal-country), between 1979 and 1997 the richest 20% got richer at the expense of the bottom 70%, in particular, the bottom 30%. 

Even those who seek to defend these claims levelled at Thatcherism concede that [There is no arguing with the fact that the UK became a more unequal society during and in the aftermath of Thatcherism.](http://www.iea.org.uk/blog/thatcherism-and-poverty-did-the-poor-get-poorer) If living standards for the poorest increased for those within reach of the policies, the policies surely had a very narrow reach. Unless previously unmentioned external factors had a dramatic effect on the rest of the population, evidence suggests that those ""beyond the scope"" certainly were affected, and negatively.

Whilst it can be said that living standards for the poorest increased, any suggestion that this was because of Thatcherism is unsubstantiated. Incomes and access to necessities did not rise compared to elsewhere. Any increase was independent of, or in spite of, Thatcherite policy, universally considered a force for inequality.",2016-04-18 10:43:49+00:00,d27d1mo,10.0,t1_d27aoxo,9235,ukpolitics

545,"This is exactly what I've been thinking. No-one was predicting Cam would be MVP prior to this season, and with good reason. Even despite his success he's still consistently weaker than the majority of starting quarterbacks with regards to stats like completion percentage, he's fairly average with regards to turnovers (especially if you include fumbles), and the only stat that's really eye-popping are his touchdown totals, which were far higher than in any year prior.

This leads us to question why his touchdown totals were so high last year. As has been referenced in this sub previously, Carolina's defense created an incredible amount of turnovers, particularly in opposing territory. He could get the same number of yards per drive as in years prior but score a lot more touchdowns, because of how favourable Carolina's average field position was, especially after a turnover.

I think he stepped up, and improved. Do I think he went from a good quarterback to the best in the league, though? No. I think if his defense struggles as much as it did in the early part of 2014 we'll see his numbers drop down back towards his career averages, rather than this current trajectory continue.",2016-04-04 14:42:05+00:00,d1pczsl,2.0,t1_d1pa1pj,4959,nfl

Remaining a part of the European free market despite not being a member state would essentially just be forfeiting our seats in the European parliament, as we'd still have to follow European directives. We'd simply be following rules that we hadn't had any say on with regards to implementation.

Beyond that, I disagree with many of the motives behind an exit. I don't like fear mongering, and I don't think that the narrative that each migrant should be treated as a potential threat to our safety is worth considering. I am very much in favour of immigration in general, and leaving the EU in order to better control our borders is not something I desire.

614,"As other people have said, the lyrics on Discoveries are some of my favourite in metalcore. Adrian draws on his personal philosophy and political views and expresses them in an inspiring way, rather than sounding preachy (see: I Shook Hands With Death, and with regards to the second idea, Corruption. Both convey a very clear message, yet do not come across as preachy in any manner). There is a lot of focus on the self, which makes it relatable. The themes are connected and intertwine well, focusing on various influences on the self such as love, imagination/aspirations, memories, perception, insecurity. There are also lots of individual lines that stand out ('I will become the answer to my own prayers' [Metamorphosis], or 'Cast aside the fear of reality//Face the fucking world' [Dispossession]) which transfer these feelings well and are memorable.

Vocally, it is Adrian's best performance. I don't know if this is me drawing a connection where there is none, but after hearing about Adrian's vocal issues I began to notice that his vocals sound weaker on Singularity. On Discoveries he shows more range, both in his highs (Exposure) and his lows (Abrasumente, Corruption, Solace, pretty much every song). His willingness to on occasion contrast each line, or each word, with the next is rare and makes for an interesting vocal performance. The vocals are more than just interesting though, as others will no doubt point out. His vocals also sound great, especially his lows.

Especially when you've listened to a lot of metalcore, everything in the genre sounds a little less ""heavy"" - you've heard all those 000-00000-00000--0000 breakdowns before, for example. Discoveries manages to sound heavy without sounding clichéd or overdone with regards to the guitar work. The breakdowns hit hard (Exposure) and the riffs are heavy and energetic (Metamorphosis). I wish I had more to say about the instrumental work (I'm not a musician myself). Every aspect sounds great.

658,"Have to say, I think your suggestions are rather off-base too. 

With regards to Washington there are obviously a lot of unknowns at play. However, whilst he remains suspended he doesn't count against the cap. Until we know for sure what his status will be next year, there's not a lot to say. If he comes back then we have something to talk about with regards to whether he's worth 7m.

Due to Niklas' injuries and his position on the depth chart, we're yet to see much from him, that's completely true. However you fail to mention he was a 2nd round pick as recently as 2014. Dude is 23. Gresham is a UFA and our other options at the position are Darren Fells and Ifeanyi Momah, no way you cut a 2nd rounder who's started 5 career games in that scenario. 

We just resigned Bethel mid-season, so before even considering anything else there's 0 chance he gets cut. But to address the points you've made - we run nickel and dime so often he'd see time as the 3rd or 4th DB regardless, and showed at least some promise considering that was his first year playing full-time corner. He also happens to be one of the best special teamers in the league, unless he was being paid more or the money would enable us to get a stud pass rusher there's no good reason to cut him - 3.5m isn't enough for us to make better use of the money somewhere else.

Regarding Stepfan Taylor, I'll be surprised if there's another player earning $725,000 mentioned in the comments. He doesn't fit the definition of a cap casualty, he's a 3rd/4th string RB fighting for a roster spot. The cap is a non-issue regarding his future.

689,"Short answer: Yes.

Firstly, the likes of Messi and Ronaldo are extremely high rated within the game, and therefore regens that come close to rivalling their ability are extremely rare. The problem of finding the best players later in the game is further exacerbated by the quality of your team - there's not a huge gap (in terms of recommended CA/PA) between good players and the best players anyway. but as star ratings are determined compared to the high quality of your squad, these players will appear even closer together (with regards to CA/PA). This is why many people (myself included) pay little attention to the star ratings, other than to assert whether or not the player still has the potential to grow - when dealing with such fine margins, the inaccuracies of staff members become even more significant.",2016-01-05 11:52:53+00:00,cymoarc,1.0,t3_3zjqra,2198,footballmanagergames

701,"Scenario 4 is a win for the team/organisation. If it turns out that this year was a Foles-esque fluke, it would be much better to be able to allow him to leave with no penalty following next season. If they sign him to a 5 year deal, as you suggest, and it turns out that he's not a reliable option, then the team is in a much worse situation.

You're right though to point out my explanation was rather simplistic. However, Cousins has expressed a desire to stay in DC and any sudden, unrealistic changes would throw off everyone's model - how often do teams let legitimate franchise QBs walk and allow him to end up somewhere else, as you described?

If he plays a year under the tag and then signs, say, a 4 year/80m deal rather than a 5 year/80m deal, then the overall value is around 5 years/100m compared to 5 years/80m. In exchange for around 4m a year (reasonable, imo, with the cap continuing to rise) over the next 5 years, Washington gets to find out whether or not he really is the guy. 

If you tag him and then reassess the situation, assuming Cousins and the FO don't spectacularly fall out, potential for reward is lower, but the risk is certainly much lower. Dedicating 5 years/80m to a guy only for him to turn out to be Foles is too much of a risk to justify it when the other scenario carries so little (relative) risk.",2015-12-30 17:15:28+00:00,cygai4e,7.0,t1_cyg9vdl,980,nfl

2. Sign a long-term contract now, doesn't live up to it.
3. Franchise tag, sign a long contract in 2017.
4. Franchise tag, let him walk.

The team wins in two scenarios (1 and 4), wins somewhat in another (3) and is crippled in the other (2). 

The risk of scenario 2 occurring is enough not to justify signing the contract now - if scenario 3 occurs, then the team is paying franchise QB money for a franchise QB. For a team without a franchise QB, this is still definitely a win.",2015-12-30 15:28:40+00:00,cyg6mrp,5.0,t1_cyfy4rh,27361,nfl

If he comes here then he's getting a good offensive line, a great receiver group, and for the first time he'll have a reliable running game. He reunites with a coach he knows and presumably enjoyed and steps into a system that utilises his talents and isn't afraid to let him throw the ball.

746,"Couple points to address here.

Firstly, I agree 3 starring TH9s has become too easy. I make the point in my post. Clans should expect to obtain 3 stars on all opposing TH9 bases. This in itself is a problem. There is less of a challenge. Individual attacks become less meaningful (OneHive had double figure TH9 attacks left in their most recent war). Success becomes less rare, and is therefore less rewarding. All of these culminate in a worse war experience.

I don't expect, or want, TH10 to become what TH9 is. There should be a level of challenge involved. Having access to high level troops and heroes should be a prerequisite to success. But success, without having to redefine what success is, should be possible. If I devise, objectively, the perfect plan, I should be rewarded for it. I shouldn't have to rely on luck to achieve success (if success is even possible), it should be dependent on my ability to plan and execute.

Finally, your experience is not like the experience of 99% of the people playing this game. Most people do not have 20 accounts. Most people only do 2 war attacks every 2 days, and their practice and experience results from that. You are doing up to 40 war attacks every 2 days. This means you inherently have a lot more experience attacking than any other player at your level, and have a more intimate knowledge of troop AI and general in-game awareness. This is akin to the advantage a modder has over someone who does not have access to mods. If you've had 20 accounts for 6 months, or a year, then you've had 10 or 20 years worth of war attacks. Don't be surprised that you're better than someone who has a year's worth of war attacks.",2015-12-14 21:17:58+00:00,cxz2t9w,2.0,t1_cxz0s4p,3186,ClashOfClans

Winning on All-Madden is possible, but not fun. The CPU will score on almost every possession, so the key to victory is scoring on almost every possession yourself, and controlling the clock. You want the ball at/around the two minute warning in the 2nd and the 4th so that you can score just as the half ends, without giving them time to reply. If you start winning games on All-Madden, (depending on the quarter length you play) you'll find they are generally 49-42 shootouts with touchdowns every drive.

[Parkway Drive - The River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5BDE3LPqck) (The cleans contrast superbly with the emotion in Winston's screams)

[Bring Me The Horizon - Suicide Season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOqmkhin4Dw) (nothing more needs to be said)

[Volumes - Vahle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eriXkm_EmnE) (Why the fuck couldn't you have left it in the driveway? :( )

[The Amity Affliction - Dr. Thunder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SEMFvoNHyQ) (Knowing the story behind this, and how Joel's inability to share and communicate his feelings effectively ended his marriage, this song is difficult to listen to.

930,"Now I can't draw much from my own experiences here as my main is a mid TH8, but based on everything I've seen/heard from people in the late TH9/10 range, the late game doesn't hold much interest, for these main reasons:

The TH10 war game is all about two stars. Attacks are formulaic and predictable. There's little to get excited about or to strive towards as you have little to no chance of getting 3 stars against others around your level. It's no fun for anyone.

The amount of loot required to upgrade buildings/troops/heroes increases exponentially compared to the amount of loot available. It begins to take many hours, or days, to save up for individual upgrades. Walls and heroes are the two best examples of this, as the cost required to max them at each town hall level becomes ridiculous at TH9/10, forcing players to spend months working on them if they intend to max them. This turns away not only casual players, but also every single player who does not want to spend hours farming every single day. It becomes a massive timesink where rewards become increasingly infrequent.

There's been a lack of (meaningful) new content lately. The most significant change since I started playing the game was the addition of dark spells, which haven't made much of a real change to the game. They're a nice tweak, but not a substitute to intriguing, game-changing content.

While the challenge of retaining high-level players months/years after they begin playing is far from unique and a situation faced by almost every game, it seems to me like an increasing number of TH9/10s are quitting the game due to the reasons described above. Unless there are changes made to the level of offensive/defensive powers of TH10s, efforts made to balance the economy at TH9/10 and more significant new content added, especially to the late game, I imagine the game will slowly die.",2015-08-26 17:19:40+00:00,cugglm1,1.0,t3_3ihd52,3962,ClashOfClans

Army composition: 10 dragons, 2 rage spell, 1 heal spell, 1 poison spell. 5x level 6 balloons in CC.

Place the first dragon on the gold mine on the right of your screen, just south-east of the elixir storage, next to the army camp.
Place the second dragon on the dark barracks on the left of your screen, just south-west of the cannon, next to the barracks.

The third dragon should be placed on the gold mine to the left of where the first dragon was placed, with the fourth placed on the dark barracks to right of where the second dragon was placed.

Continue this process inwards, creating a funnel for your dragons to attack the core of the base from the south. Once your dragons start taking damage from the two nearest air defences, drop the heal spell. Once the clan castle troops engage, drop the poison spell. Drop the first rage spell as your dragons engage the two nearest air defences.

Your remaining army should be your barbarian king, your 5 balloons, and your second rage spell. 

Once the final air defence begins attacking your dragons, drop your barbarian king on the army camp in the north-west, between the gold mine and elixir collector. This will ensure the archer tower locks onto your king and not your balloons. Immediately after, place your balloons between the two elixir collectors in the north, ensuring their target is the cannon. Place the final rage spell encompassing the area containing the air defence, the cannon and the clan castle. This should enrage your balloons and likely many of the remaining dragons. The final air defence will drop shortly after and you should have enough remaining troops to clean up effectively.

Level 6 air defences are very difficult to dragloon effectively but the levels of his point defences and his adequate walls mean that GoWiPe is even less reliable.

I'd rather settle for getting something like 75k/75k than trying and failing on a more lucrative base and ending up with 20k. Keep nexting and keep an eye out for how much loot is inside the collectors and every now and then you luck out and find 300k of each sitting in collectors.",2015-07-27 14:35:49+00:00,cthrxus,3.0,t1_cthrp00,435,ClashOfClans
974,"Barch is an effective farming tactic because the troops are cheap and take little time to train, NOT because the troops are powerful. If you can't get loot or 50%, then you're doing one of two things wrong:

1) You're attacking the wrong bases

2) You're trying to core dive with 120 barbs/80 archers.

With regards to the first problem, you're town hall 8, like me. If you want gold/elixir, then there's two types of bases you should be targeting. You should be targeting collector bases (bases with easily accessible resource collectors that are full/nearly full, if you look closely you can actually see how full each collector is), and you should be targeting town hall 7/weak town hall 8 bases. Against these bases, you're much more able to destroy the defences and gain a decent amount of loot.

Secondly, if you find you're ineffectively trying to break through to the core of bases, you can either attack different bases, as I described, or change your army composition. If you have upgraded your giants/wallbreakers to at least level 4 or 5, try adding a few giants and wallbreakers to your army. Your giants can distract the defences whilst your other troops collect loot, and the wallbreakers can clear a path to the core, where the best loot usually is.

Whichever route you decide to go down, I'd recommend you bring either 3 heal spells, or 2 heal spells and 1 rage spell (try both and see which you prefer). You want to use the heal spells to allow your barbarians/giants (whichever you're using to soak up damage) to soak up damage for as long as possible. Heal spells are especially useful if you have a large group of barbarians/giants attacking a wizard tower or if they're being targeted by mortars, that's when I'd recommend you use them.

When I want to farm I usually use a similar set up to you, and if I have spells cooked I'll try to reach the core of a town hall 7/8 using heal spells to keep my barbarians alive whilst my archers pick off defensive buildings. When my heal spells are cooking, I'll then next until I can find collector bases or a base that's set up poorly, making it easy.

The only musicians who earn enough from sales to fund their everyday lives are those selling millions of records, who earn even more from endorsement deals etc. - there is no musician who survives thanks to the sale of their product. This is why the people lobbying for stricter piracy controls are not artists, but the media companies that have them in a stranglehold. 

Musicians make their money from selling tickets to their shows, from selling merchandise, from endorsements. They are largely unaffected by piracy - You Me At Six's Josh Franceschi once proclaimed ""Fuck the record label"" and encouraged fans to pirate their albums, Asking Alexandria's Danny Worsnop once said something similar, and it is rumoured that it was Fall Out Boy themselves who leaked their 2013 release.

Warner ends up signing another contract after the 2009 season, our FO grateful for securing the team its first SB. He retires after the 2012 season following a down year as age and injuries catch up.
