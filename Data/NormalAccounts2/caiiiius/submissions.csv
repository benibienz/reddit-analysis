By this I mean players and clans who (try to) execute 3-star attacks, focus their upgrades around what will benefit them the most in war, and generally play this game for clan wars. While much of the community has been complaining about the changes to farming and the new personal break, I believe it is the war community who have been truly shafted by this update. 

First, in order to consider the impact of the update, it is necessary to look at the game prior to the update. Due to how little time players spend warring at these levels, and the fact that they are largely unaffected by the extra 30 seconds and dark spell donation, I have excluded everything below TH8. The effects of this update on war are at their most prominent for TH8 and above.

**This post will be lengthy, so I have made the conclusion of each point bold. For a more in-depth analysis, read the accompanying paragraph.**

TH8: Town Hall 8 had access to numerous strategies that could be considered viable. Dragloon, GoWiPe, GoHo and mass hog attacks all had the potential to 3 star bases, and niche success could also be had using hybrid-style attacks or using other troops, such as valkyries. Town Hall 8 encouraged players to learn and perfect a number of strategies and employ them based on the base they were facing, as poor execution or planning could easily result in lacking the troops required to 3-star the base due to running out of time. This Town Hall lacked balance, however. Air attacks were very strong, especially after the ability to zapquake an air defence was introduced. Level 4 Hogs were extremely powerful, as only giant bombs could be relied upon to take them out. A TH8 base lacked sufficient DPS to rely on doing anything more than slowing down an adequately executed GoWiPe - this attack was always dependent on time. 3-star attacks were plentiful, even on the first hit.

**Town Hall 8 was grossly unbalanced as TH8 bases lacked sufficient DPS. The majority of failed 3-star attempts were due to running out of time. Due to the lack of perceived difficulty, TH8 was little more than an introduction to strategies and troops used at TH9, and consequently many serious war clans do not accept TH8 members.**

TH9: Town Hall 9 was universally considered the most balanced Town Hall level. If you look at the rosters of many serious war clans, they are largely made up of TH9 players, including many players with maxed TH9 bases. These players did not want to move up, because the balance at TH9 was considered close to perfect. Attackers at Town Hall 9 would largely rely on hog or loon-based attacks, as the increase in defending DPS and lack of a pekka or wizard upgrade relegated GoWiPe to a 2-star strategy at this level. Attackers still had options, however, as valkyries or witches found their way into kill teams and ways to utilise dragons were found. Any Town Hall 9 could be 3-starred, **given the right strategy, planning and execution**. Those who planned and executed their attacks effectively were rewarded with 3-stars, whilst those who put the time and effort into building a great base were rewarded with defences. Whilst changes (such as the addition of dark spells) were made that altered the balance in favour of the attacker, Town Hall 9 remained the place to be for war-focused players.

**Town Hall 9 rewarded effective attacking and defending, with widespread balance. TH9 was loved and cherished by the war community as many players elected to stop upgrading their base in order to remain TH9. Town Hall 9 attackers would generally 3-star the opposing Town Hall 9s in serious wars, but not without effective planning and execution.**

TH10: Town Hall 10 was even more unbalanced than Town Hall 8 - but in the opposite direction. 3-star attacks on max defence TH10s were rare, and only occurred thanks to some combination of luck, poor base design and skill. Skill alone was not enough to secure regular or frequent 3-star attacks. At TH10 there was a lack of upgrades to core war troops such as hogs and loons, and the cumulative DPS of two infernos, three x-bows and cored teslas meant that all but the most bulky kill teams melted once they were in range. Many war-focused players who upgraded to TH10 became dissatisfied and often quit the game, such was the level of imbalance. The war community has, for some time, been requesting balance at TH10.

**Town Hall 10 bases, especially fully upgraded ones, were close to impossible to 3-star without the use of third-party applications that allowed attackers to attempt multiple attacks on the same base. Even those who meticulously planned and executed attacks were not often rewarded for their efforts. Town Hall 10 was so unplayable that many players would quit the game.**

**TL;DR:**

**Prior to the update, whilst the war community were dissatisfied with the level of balance at other Town Hall levels, the balance at Town Hall 9 was seen as almost perfect. There are players who warred at Town Hall 9 since clan wars were introduced, who still did not grow tired of it. The Town Hall 9 war balance was the sole reason much of the war community played the game.**

Post-update:

TH8: Town Hall 8 is now, largely, a joke. While not as unbalanced as Town Hall 7, the addition of a second dark spell allows any CC troop to be dealt with for close to 0 troop space and allows a poison to be brought along with a zapquake. Two regular spells may also be brought along in addition to 4 EQ spells. Attackers now have an extra 30 seconds. Not only do attackers now have more at their disposal, there is also more margin for error. A Town Hall 8 base defending even one attack will become rarer and rarer.

**Town Hall 8 has become even more unbalanced than before. Town Hall 8 will soon become as much of an afterthought as Town Hall 7 is, as attacks that run out of time (the primary reason for failed attacks at TH8) will be almost eliminated.**

TH9: Attackers at TH9 benefit similarly from the extra dark spell and additional 30 seconds. We are seeing attackers capable of eliminating all four air defences prior to dragon/loon deployment, making defence against these attacks almost impossible. Similarly, the CC, once the most valuable defence at TH9, is almost useless. A lava hound is now easily the most effective CC troop, reducing variety. Base design has been made more simplistic also, as it is no longer viable to try and slow down your opponent to the extent that they run out of time, thanks to the additional 30 seconds.

**At Town Hall 9, things have become easier and more simple. Whilst new and different attack strategies are developing, this is as a result of how easy it has become to exploit the weaknesses of TH9 bases. As a result of the additional time, attacks that never would have been 3 stars before, are now 3 stars. The balance is now firmly skewed in favour of the attacker, and the glory days of TH9 warring are well and truly dead.**

TH10: In our first war following the update, we had a perfect war thanks to a 3-star attack on a TH10. Thanks to changes as a result of the update, our attacker had a way to combat the ridiculous DPS of the meta TH10 core. Unfortunately, our attacker was a TH11. The attack was successful because of the Grand Warden. There is still not balance at TH10. The update did not add new troops, or new troop levels, to TH10. The extra dark spell is not enough of a game-changer at TH10 to lead to a significant increase in 3-star attacks.

**Town Hall 10 is still broken. TH10s still cannot expect to 3-star opposing TH10s with any sustained level of success. TH10 has been largely forgotten about by Supercell, as the response to TH10 issues appears to be ""Upgrade to TH11"". Town Hall 10s can be 3-starred now, but by TH11s. The impact of this is limited, as all Town Hall levels can expect to 3-star a lower Town Hall level.**

**I do not feel qualified to comment on the state of the TH11 war game as we don't yet know enough about it. This is largely irrelevant to the point of this post, regardless.**

The implications of this are fairly simple. Where do all war-focused players go now? What will be the new Town Hall 9? The answer to that is, right now, nowhere. We don't really know. What we do know is, Town Hall 9 will never be balanced again. Our best hope for balance is at TH10 or TH11. Which brings us on to the next point. Much of the war community spent months or years upgrading to TH9, maxing their heroes, enjoying the TH9 war game, etc. This is no longer the place to enjoy war. We're now being told that if we want to war, we should upgrade to TH10 or TH11. 

In order to enjoy the game as we enjoyed it before, we're going to need 40/40 heroes, perhaps a Grand Warden, and all the available troop upgrades. This will take months or even years for most people. It's as if the war community ran a marathon (the upgrade path). The community reached the finish line (Town Hall 9), stopped to enjoy it, only to be told shortly after that the race wasn't over. There's another 26.2 miles we have to run. Only then can we enjoy balance once again. We can either accept a substandard game, or we can chase balance again. Which will cost us months or years in terms of time, or lots of gems. Those who are max TH9 with 30/30 heroes can expect a grind worse than that of TH9, and those who aren't may never experience balance again as new updates will likely push back the point of balance further. It is likely that many, or perhaps, all of us, will never experience the same level of balance again.

If you watch or listen to those within the community who care about war, they've recognised it's the end. We're watching players leave the game left and right, and many of those who haven't left are planning to. If you watch the latest OneHive video, for example, you'll hear the resignation in Jake's voice. War has been neglected by Supercell for a long time, but this is the update that will finally kill it.

I (apparently, like many others) refrained from making alts as a result.

However, I've since discovered a way of making (multiple) alts using just a single iOS device, that is neither particularly complex or time consuming. All you need is your iOS device, a computer, and an additional email address for each account you want to create. I'll try to be as clear and concise as possible.

1) This method requires you to factory reset your device once for each alt you create, so the first step is to create a backup of all your data so that you'll be able to restore your data later. You can do this by simply opening iTunes and selecting your connected device. From the summary page, click the 'Back Up Now' option, [as highlighted](http://imgur.com/UtwrAiq). All your contacts, messages etc. are now safely stored on your computer.

2) Once all your data has been successfully backed up, you can begin the process of creating an alternate CoC account on your device. First, you'll need to factory reset your device, enabling you to create a new Game Center account, and with it, a new village. From your home screen, go to Settings, then [general settings](http://imgur.com/GiFjjgb), select ['Reset'](http://imgur.com/p0zfVPG) and choose 'Erase All Content And Settings'. Enter your passcode if you have one and select 'Erase iPhone/iPad/etc.'. You're now in possession of a device not linked to any CoC account.

3) Create a new Apple ID. If you have access to another Apple ID you can use, you may skip this step. If not, open iTunes and [sign out](http://imgur.com/FPT2mOX) of your Apple account. Click 'Sign In' and you'll be presented with the opportunity to sign in, or to create a new Apple ID. Click 'Create Apple ID'. You'll need access to another email account for each ID you create.

4) Turn your device back on and go through the initial setup, linking your device to the new Apple ID. Once setup is complete, go to the Game Center and create a profile. All you need is a nickname. Download Clash of Clans from the App Store and the tutorial will begin. You now have a second village.

5) Go once more to Settings, then [general settings](http://imgur.com/GiFjjgb), and select ['Reset'](http://imgur.com/p0zfVPG), choosing 'Erase All Content And Settings' again. Start your device up a second time.

6a) If you desire one alternate account, restore your device from the backup stored on your computer. All your contacts, messages, photos and everything else important will be restored onto your device, along with your original Game Center profile and CoC village. 

To switch between your old village and your new village, go to Settings, then Game Center. You can sign in/out of your Game Center profiles from [this](http://imgur.com/37lajX7) screen, enabling you to switch between villages. Each time you load up Clash of Clans after switching Game Center profiles and choose to load your other village, you will be greeted with [this](http://imgur.com/F42zMGR) scary looking screen. Don't worry, it's safe to type 'CONFIRM', **your village will not be deleted**. You can access it once again by simply switching back to the relevant Game Center profile.

6b) If you desire multiple alternate accounts, then upon starting up your device following the second factory reset, link your device to a third (or fourth, etc.) Apple ID. By following the steps described above you can create as many alternate accounts as you want. Once you're satisfied, follow step 6a to restore your device back to its previous state and allow you to access all your alts. 

----------------------------------------------------------

To any iOS users on this sub who previously found themselves unable to make an alt - I hope this helps you. You're unlikely to encounter any problems if you follow the steps as I described them, but should you need anyone to help you out, I (or perhaps another user) will be happy to oblige. I find this method to be very easy to follow and rather simple, the most time consuming aspect is waiting for the backup to be restored onto the device. 

Should you have any questions or queries, don't hesitate to ask down below. As I stated above, don't worry, **this process will not result in you losing any data from your device or your current CoC account. It's completely safe.**",ClashOfClans,"[MISC] How to make alternate accounts on a single iOS device, in six steps.",http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/3gs83o/misc_how_to_make_alternate_accounts_on_a_single/
