3,"Someone already pointed out it that it was Tripp not Archer in Enterprise that T'Pol had romantics interest in but they failed to point out some great episodes re: her marriage.  T'Pol was set for an arranged marriage with Koss since they were children. Several times she turned down returning to Vulcan to wed him and only agreed to do so in S4E3 after he told her he could help her Mother get her job back and T'Pol could resume her career after the first year.

While we have the books to look towards and TOS for reference as well as Tuvoks discussions about his wife I think the episodes with Koss show us that arranged marriages were in fact accepted and possibly early on up till a certain part considered normal in Vulcan culture, not unlike what we see in the Middle East today or what we saw in the past. It was a duty for them to fulfill these obligations less causing themselves to be frowned upon but society or their parents.",2016-10-24 04:23:18+00:00,d957662,1.0,t3_591636,21233.0,DaystromInstitute
4,"How to check for a Testicular Cancer. The prime age for men to be diagnosed with TC is 15-35. Guys need to be checking themselves post shower or bath once a month. Take it from a survivor, you don't want to lose one of the boys.

* If possible, stand in front of a mirror. Check for any swelling on the scrotal skin.


* Examine each testicle with both hands. Place the index and middle fingers under the testicle with the thumbs placed on top. Roll the testicle gently between the thumbs and fingers -- you shouldn't feel any pain when doing the exam. Don't be alarmed if one testicle seems slightly larger than the other, that's normal.


* Find the epididymis, the soft, tubelike structure behind the testicle that collects and carries sperm. If you are familiar with this structure, you won't mistake it for a suspicious lump. Cancerous lumps usually are found on the sides of the testicle but can also show up on the front. Lumps on or attached to the epididymis are not cancerous.


* If you find a lump on your testicle or any of the other signs of testicular cancer listed below, see a doctor, preferably a urologist, right away. The abnormality may not be cancer, but if it is testicular cancer, it will spread if it is not stopped by treatment. Even if it is something else like an infection, you are still going to need to see a doctor. Waiting and hoping will not fix anything. Please note that free floating lumps in the scrotum that are not attached in any way to a testicle are not testicular cancer. When in doubt, get it checked out - if only for peace of mind!",2016-10-23 05:18:45+00:00,d93xt7m,1.0,t3_58tsnw,47053.0,AskReddit

33,"While the Romulan Star Empire is certainly oppressive they have never barred Remans from service. In Enterprise we can see them being used as security for Senators and it is discussed in Nemesis that they served as frontline soldiers during the Dominion War and were exceptionally fierce. 

That said however, the Remans were essentially slaves and nothing more than canon fodder for the military. I think one thing we have to remember is that the Romulans and Klingons were both created to represent oppressive regimes from real world countries back when TOS aired. The Federation being like the UN wants to do whatever it can to maintain the peace and if that means turning a blind eye or bending over backwards they will just like the UN does in real life.It was this very peace at any cost nature that nearly caused the destruction of the Alpha Quadrant at the hands of the Dominion. 

As others have said we don't have a lot of information on the subjugated species of the Klingon Empire so it's very hard to judge them. I would however bet for them it is more of a pride and tradition factor with the warrior mentality rather than purposefully holding back their conquered subjects.

56,"You're sharing the exact story of what happened to me. The only problem was that the original Doctor wrote it off as an infection and it took six months for a diagnosis of TC and by then I was stage IIa and it had spread. What your Urologist was probably concerned about was if it was truly an infection the swelling would have been caused by it and could show which would make it harder to read a seen mass. 

I had the same issue and they just thought it was an infection and while there was one it was being caused by the TC. The mass was plain as day and only grew bigger. Also depending on the type of cancer, blood work shows as negative because again a certain type of cancer doesn't show in blood work speaking from experience. 

Surgery isn't taken lightly because they know the intensity of it and if they're recommending it I would highly follow through. Best of luck and let us know what happens. We'll be here to answer questions along the way. ",2016-07-27 14:01:13+00:00,d5sy1wu,1.0,t3_4uu7hh,7806.0,testicularcancer

It can effect his sex drive, mood, and more. He'll need an emotional anchor and someone willing to remind him his appeal isn't based off of one testicle. And send him here!

Firstly nausea and loss of appetite is not a common TC symptom, though radiation or chemo can cause it. However, extreme pain is known to cause both issues and sciatic nerve pain depending on the damaged nerve can cause an array of issues from your back down. 

If your pain has been getting progressively worse with no improvement and now your nauseas from it then I highly suggest viditng your nearest urgent care or er to be examined. Let them do a once over and they can also give you medicine like phenergen for the nausea or other medicines to control the pain and rerun x-rays, labs, etc.  Always take your health as a priority and don't suffer needlessly.

148,"Daredevil: The Man Without Fear

The classic Daredevil origin story by Frank Miller and John Romita, Jr. Many elements of this comic are used in the show.

Daredevil: Yellow

This series by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale is a look back at the days DD wore his yellow costume. It weaves its way around the original Stan Lee origin story from 1964.

Daredevil: Born Again

Considered to be one of the best graphic novels of all time, this tale by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli is a must-read. The Kingpin learns that Matt Murdock is Daredevil... and he shows him that a man without hope is a man without fear.

Daredevil: Guardian Devil

Considered the highlight of the Marvel Knights era, this story by Kevin Smith features a story about a would be child savior, classic Daredevil villan Bullseye, an appearance by another one of his past flames; Black Widow, and a shocking death that all tests Matt's faith.

Is it what makes him Daredevil though and in a certain context a hero with the moral high ground? Yup. That's why he's always been my favorite.

183,"The loss of testosterone after Testicular Cancer is radical for some men and causes an array of issues. As a thirty-one year old male I went from having over amped energy that got me through my ten hour work days and drove my employees through our their shifts to having the energy of a mid eight year old man who needed to nap twice a day and could barely make it through four hours of work. It's even worse when you're going through a month if radiation therapy five times a week and that is sapping away your energy too. 

Then again, that's not including the depression and majorly decreased sex drive. Everyone literally thought I had become a different person because of the cancer and not for the best, they just didn't understand it wasn't something in my control. The social stigma of cancer keeps people from wanting to understand.

There is a treatment though; testosterone replacement therapy. I get a pellet injection every three months, where they make an incision and place about four to seven dissolvable pellets into me. It takes two weeks to kick in though so a late appointment can screw you over if the testosterone replacement has waned off and your levels have dropped.",2016-02-10 06:31:51+00:00,czui62z,1.0,t3_44zq0j,24172.0,AskReddit

In my case I'm having to do the pellet therapy every three months which essentially means that a speciality pharmacy provides me with about four-six testosterone pellets and then the urologist makes a small incision in my upper side buttock and uses a medical funnel and stick to push them into the muscles of the butt. Afterwards I'm stitched up and the whole procedure lasts about fifteen minutes while the testosterone boost lasts the next three months. 

A bit painful and sore but well worth it compared to the loss of sexual drive and no energy what so ever that was making me want to nap twice a day and barely make it through an eight hour shift at work.

As for low testosterone it'll all depend on how the blood work goes and how much testosterone you lost post surgery. My experience is on the extreme side as I lost over 200 points of testosterone and require pellet injections once every three months. To be honest though, from what I've read most Oncologists and Urologist who specialize in TC will tell you that the gels don't help that much. If your TC has dropped low enough to need replacement you typically need either the shots or pellet replacement. The gel is typically for middle age guys who have low T and just need a sex drive boost but they come with a lot of risks and are under scrutiny from the FDA. 

Do your research online and name sure to ask exactly how low your testosterone is compared to what the baseline for your age should  be. If it's a huge gap shots or pellets will be the way to go.",2016-01-28 16:34:19+00:00,czf92s7,1.0,t3_432ttu,20200.0,testicularcancer

The lymph system of the testicles drain into the abdomen while the lymph system of the scrotum drains into the lower legs. By doing a biopsy through the scrotum, cancerous cells can be left in the scrotum and the lymph drainage can be altered. This means that any cancer can spread in a way that is not as predictable as normal testicular cancer spreads. This is why a Radical Orchiectomy is the recommended process by all medical professionals for biopsying the tumor.",2015-11-15 18:19:43+00:00,cx13vvz,1.0,t3_3sx1tx,1360.0,testicularcancer

387,"Personally I felt this was a very fun movie and had quite a few memorable moments from the briefcase fight scene to the training montage and more. Michael Pena was great in his role, even remembering to save the guard, and there were plenty of moments the audience was laughing out loud or all gasping together over Antony.

I felt it was a nice origins movie for the character and I think we’re just now setting ourselves up where every Marvel movie has to be this grand epic piece and so something like this which is great in its own right will be looked down upon by some. It’s one of the first Marvel movies my better half has said she has thoroughly enjoyed from beginning to end as a non-comic fan as well too. So there’s that.

Finally I’ll add in Hope getting her surprise from Hank at the end and the neat easter egg of what I swore was her mother in the micro verse scene along with Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas nailing their characters and I am and was sold.",2015-07-17 18:44:54+00:00,ct6uzh9,1.0,t3_3dmfh7,18752.0,marvelstudios
