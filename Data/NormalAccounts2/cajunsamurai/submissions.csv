I've been running into an issue though when it comes to the unlock mini games. When I attempt to unlock something and it shows the countdown timer and then four Xbox buttons nothing is lit up to guide me on what to press. Is this a bug or something I'm just forgetting?

As some of you may or may not know, November is also known as Movember in order to bring focus to men's health issues. All around the world Men grow out a mustache or shave their beards and replace it with a mustache in order to raise awareness for things like Prostate Cancer, Testicular Cancer, and Mental Health/Suicide Prevention. These are all hugely important topics that often go un-discussed with men and it leads to devastating results. I should know, last year I was diagnosed myself with Stage IIa Testicular Cancer and the first thing that hit me was shock. Most men don't even know that they should be performing a monthly self exam!

So what is the goal you ask? I've teamed up with the Movember Foundation in an effort to raise both awareness and funds to help bring education to men on these health issues, get my fellow man help where and when they need it, and hopefully find a cure for these terrible diseases. I'll be shaving my beard off tomorrow morning and sporting a sweet stache for all of November. Plus I'll be working towards a fitness goal to loose weight as well. Now what's in it for you by donating? The highest contributor to my cause will be able at the end of November to decide if I have to keep the stache, get to grow back my beard, or shave my face clean and end up rocking a baby face.

I'm stuck in a lease and obviously have to find a new job, the problem is finding something this time of year that matches what I was making and I need to make, and what my skill set is. I'm angry, lost, and confused. To make matters worse I called the state unemployment board this afternoon to get information as a worse case scenario and they require six months of paychecks in the state for you to qualify which means no unemployment for me.

**Current Openings:**

*Executive Officer:*  Mr. Spock, William Riker, Chakotay… all of these officers share one thing in common, they were great First Officers aboard their vessels. They provided counsel to the Captain during times of conflict, moral to the crew in times of uncertainty, and set an example that all looked up to. It is more than a position of trust and respect, the best Executive Officer is a driving force that without a Captain and her ship can find itself lost. Aboard the Ragnarök such an officer is being sought, if you have the leadership skills and desire then we want you!

*Echo Company:* The Ragnarok is home to the Starfleet Marine Corp's Echo Company from the 212th Battalion, which is apart of the 72nd Ranger Regiment. Currently we are seeking a Company Commander, Company XO, Platoon CO’s and more.

*Medical &amp; Counseling:* While the importance of doctors and counselors aboard any starship is unquestioned, it goes a step further with the Normandy due to her mission as a carrier class vessel. Always on the ready to provide humanitarian relief if needed our medical teams play a huge role in also keeping the citizens of the Federation and others in need healthy and safe as well.

I know, I didn't say I'm the best at what I do but then again Imid that were the case I wouldn't have needed to go about accepting this gig now would I? I'm still not one hundred percent sure what the job is which to be honest isn't how I normally operate but when one of largest organizations in the galaxy comes to you and offers to hire you and says for no questions asked if you fulfill one legitimate mission you'll earn enough credits to comfortably retire you don't say no. 

So here I am counting down the days, which as of today is t-minus 105 days until I do this job. My employer has ensured me that it will match up with my skills both from both past service and current occupation. I'm beginning to think that means the organization has a pirate problem. Why they're paying so much is beyond me but like I said, no complaints. After this I'm hanging up my hunters license and finding a nice quite place to retire that's home to a lot of pretty women. 

Here's to those 105 days getting here sooner than later.
